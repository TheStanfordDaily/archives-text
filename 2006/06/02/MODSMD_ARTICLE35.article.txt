# You need money... For a pimpin summer
## 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION TEMP 
If you're anything like me, you probably
have no idea what your going to do this sum
mer. There might be some of you out there who
(scored a wicked internship or some amazing
at a law firm or some other soul-sucking
place, but many of you have a pretty open sum
mer. Hell, even if you did land that sweet in
ternship at say, Warner Brothers, chances are
that they aren't paying you. So, since Intermis
sion is always looking out for its faithful read
ers, I've compiled a list of ways you can make
money without having to report it to the gov
ernment. (Editor's note: 1 am not promoting
tax evasion, fraud or anything of the sort. I also
love the IRS. God Bless America. Down with
Saddam.)
Yard work
This ain't for 12-year-olds anymore. Yup
pies will pay out the butt for you to mow their
lawns or trim their money-shaped topiaries.
They may even invite you in for lunch and a
chance to meet their single son or daughter.
Besides, there aren't many other jobs (except
those at The Daily) that allow you to drink on
the job, but when you're hefting those heavy
bales of cut grass, it's downright encouraged.
Cheers!
Start your own lemonade stand
Also a summer job previously considered
the domain of little children. It was adorable
then and it's adorable now—with one slight
change. Instead of selling regular lemonade,
try selling lemonade with a little something
extra ingredient—booze. Exhausted nine-to
five dads coming home from a long day at the
office will appreciate your little booth of heav
en before they have to brave the nagging wife
about how much he doesn't love her anymore.
You'll be soothing the pain of society while
raking in the dough.
Create your own crime ring
Chances are that you'll have some friends
that also don't know what they're going to do
with their summer—and ostensibly their lives
—so why not give them a little purpose? There
are plenty of houses in your neighborhood that
are just asking to be robbed. Gather up your
friends, put your mother's nylons over your
faces, choose the neighbor with the most an
noying habits and steal their prized possession.

I I
They say that possession is nine-tenths of the
law so once it's in your hands, you can sell that
other tenth for a hefty profit.
Become a pimp
You've watched plenty of rap videos to
know how this works, so I won't bother getting
into the "how tos." Needless to say. there is a lot
of money—or cheddar as it's called in the biz—
that will allow you to cruise down the street in
your new six-foh in style. Added bonus: ice—
and not the frozen water kind.
Become a political assassin
There are plenty of people in the politi
cal arena that are just asking for a bullet.
Just make sure you have three names (Lee
Harvey Oswald, John Wilkes Booth and
Jamie Lee Curtis are all prime examples)
and you're set. Call up your local disenfran
chised group of people (e.g. the Democratic
party) and they will gladly give you a list of po
tential targets. Make sure they pay in advance,
and in cash, otherwise they'll get you before
you can say, "Cheney shot in the face."
Become a nanny
Again, those yuppies will throw money at
you if you will raise their children. Sure, they
are spoiled, whiny little monsters, but if you
give it enough time, you will turn them
against their parents.They will love you and
only you. If you take enough nanny jobs,
you'll have enough children followers to
start your own cult. Believe you me, there is
money to made in the cult business. Yesiree,
toddler cults make bank.

Write for Intermission
We love it when people write for us. We
love it so much that, unlike the demon
spawned beasts known as bears, we don't

take a whole season off to sleep. I can
personally guarantee that if you want
to write an article on the benefits of

bear-o-cide, there is an enormous pos
sibility that it will be printed in the

summer issues of The Stanford
Weekly. If you happen to kill a bear

and mount its head, we will cut
you a check for a millions dol-

lars —or a lifetime supply of
honey, depending on your

tastes.
