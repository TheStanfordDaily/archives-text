# For Manship, there's no win like home
## Senior righty who ”love[s] to beat Texas" may need to do just that for the Card to survive 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
Heading into this weekend's NCAA Re
gional in Austin. Texas, with the possibility of
eventually facing the defending national
champion Longhorns, senior pitcher Matt
Manship will have an extra chip on his shoul
der — just like any time the Cardinal tackle
Texas.
"I love to beat Texas," Manship said.
"That's where a lot of my family and friends
go, so it's all I hear about while I'm at home."
Hailing from San Antonio, just one hour
outside of Austin, Manship's parents follow
Longhorn baseball religiously and never miss
a series — especially not the squad's three
game series at Stanford in February.
Manship pitched 4.2 innings against Texas
in the second game of that series, allowing just
one run and propelling the Cardinal to the 5-
1 victory. Stanford would end up taking the
rubber game as well, winning the series from
the heavily-favored Longhorns with Man
ship's folks sporting burnt orange in the
Sunken Diamond stands.
But while his parents may have rooted for
the enemy that weekend, Manship can thank
his parents for getting him started in the game
he loves. His father and uncle each pitched at
Arizona, and two of his family members have
played ball professionally.
"I played a little basketball here and there,
but baseball was always the focus of my fami
ly," Manship said. "It was the first sport I un-
derstood, so it was the first one I really felt comfortable
with. Our dad was always there to teach us and practice
ball with us."
The cul-de-sac where Manship grew up also helped
him get into the sport. He and his friends could easily con
vert it into a diamond and play pick-up ball any day of the
week. Manship's father later constructed a pitcher's
mound in the backyard for his son to focus on hurling.
After playing various positions through his childhood,
Manship began to focus on pitching during his junior
year of high school.
Now one of the veteran leaders of the Cardinal
bullpen, Manship has started 12 of his 17 appearances
this season, although his past four outings have been out
of the bullpen.
Manship currently ranks second in Stanford history
with 17 saves, having worked primarily in relief over the
past three seasons. He currently owns a 2-5 record to go
along with a 5.32 ERA in 55 innings this season.
After a tumultuous season for the entire team. Man
ship appreciates the leadership position he has taken on.
"I enjoy that the younger guys feel they can approach
me with any problems," Manship said."l've learned to be
a leader both on and off the field, though I haven't neces
sarily always showed it on the field, since I've struggled
here and there. But overall, it's been quite the learning
experience for me and the younger guys."
After four years on the Farm. Manship has come to
appreciate the Stanford atmosphere on the playing field
and off.
"There's a bit of everything at this university," he said.
"It's very diverse and there's a good mix of interesting
people. I'm playing with other intelligent athletes — it's
a different kind of athlete at Stanford relative to other
places."
Indeed, while he may be considered an outcast back
home for choosing to play at Stanford instead of Texas,
Manship is happy with his experience and wouldn't trade
it for the world.
"The four years that I've spent here have been some
of the best of my life," he said. "I'm going to miss it. If I
could. I'd start all over. The freshmen are very lucky be
cause their whole experience is in front of them."

Senior hurler Matt Manship hopes his season won't end in front of his hometown crowd. The San Antonio native and the Cardinal will
need to get past No. 5 Texas if they want to survive the double-elimination Regional and stay alive in the NCAA Tournament.
