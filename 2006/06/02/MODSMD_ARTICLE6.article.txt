# BASEBALL HEADS TO 13TH STRAIGHT NCAA TOURNAMENT
## Uphill battle as Card visit Austin Regional, host Horns North Carolina State, Texas-Arlington round out weekend 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball's four Texas natives
aren't the only ones excited about returning
to the Lone Star State this weekend. And it's

not just the fact that the Cardinal reached
the NCAA Regional Tournament for the
13th straight season that has the whole team
excited.
The squad is particularly excited about
playing in Austin, Texas, this year. For the
second straight year, the Cardinal will play
postseason ball inTexas, though this time it is
will be at Disch-Falk field (Stanford was
named to the Baylor Regional last season).
"I love the atmosphere in Austin," senior

shortstop and All-Pac-10 selection Chris Mi
naker (64 RBI, 11 HR) said. "(I've loved it]
ever since freshman year."
Stanford (30-25) earned a spot on Mon
day morning in the final NCAA Baseball re
gional announced, hosted by the No. 5 Long
horns (40-19).
"We knew the last regional was Texas,"
said junior righthander Greg Reynolds on
the morning of the selection. "We have such
a huge rivalry with that school it only seems

right to go there."
Before the Cardinal can think about a po
tential matchup against the Longhorns, how
ever, they must first focus their attention on
North Carolina State (38-21). In fact. Coach
Mark Marquess said he isn't planning to so
lidify his Saturday starter until after today's
game.
Stanford faces NC State today at 11 a.m.
CT. But, as Minaker noted earlier this week,
all the Cardinal needs to know about NC
State is that the No. 2 seeded Wolfpack has a
higher seeding than the No. 3 seeded Cardi
nal.
NC State is attending the NCAA tourna
ment for the fourth year in a row, but this
marks the first time they will meet the Cardi
nal. The Wolfpack have already had their
share of tough opponents this season, how
ever. They faced ranked opponents includ
ing No. 10 Nebraska. No. 4 Georgia Tech. No.
2 Clemson. Virginia and Florida State.
Though the Wolfpack have lost eight of
their last 15 games, they did place second be
hind Clemson in the Atlantic Coast Confer
ence. Matt Camp leads the team in batting
average with a .387 clip.
Gib Hobson (9-1, 4.60 ERA) takes the
mound for NC State today. I"he junior
righthander is 5-0 with a 2.98 ERA over his
last nine appearances, which included a com
plete game victory over North Carolina one
week ago.
The Cardinal start Reynolds (6-5, 3.47),
whose game has been spectacular over the
last month of play. The 6-foot-7 Pacifica,
Calif., native has tossed four complete games
in his last five starts, giving up a total of six
runs in those four games. Reynolds is ranked
fifth for this month's first-year player draft,
and he has mentioned this could be his last
hurrah with the Card.
"It could be my last start." Reynolds said
of his assignment against the Wolfpack. "I'll
do everything in my part to make sure it's
not."
Texas plays Texas-Arlington (29-34), the
Regional's four-seed, at 3 p.m. today. With a
win. Stanford could therefore meet Texas in
Saturday's Game 4. This weekend's regional


NOAH HAWTHORNE/The Stanford Daily
The Card hope the rally caps work better this weekend against Texas, North Carolina State and Texas-Arlington than they did last Saturday at
UC-Davis. The Aggies swept the teams' two-game series, claiming Saturday's finale 8-3.
