## Danish prince pays a royal visit Delegation promotes its new reusable energy firm, opening today in Palo Alto 
### CASSIE HARVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While U.S. politicians and analysts clamor for re
newable energy in the wake of skyrocketing oil
prices, the Royal Highness Prince Joachim of Den
mark took action yesterday by visiting Stanford to
promote the launch of the Innovation Center Den
mark — a bridge firm for developing alternative
energy sources.
The prince and his delegation met with Univer
sity President John Hennessy and faculty to listen in
on presentations given by Prof. Franklin Orr, direc
tor of the Global Climate and Energy Project, and
Rosamond Naylor, senior fellow at the Institute for
International Studies. The presentations addressed
issues ranging from greenhouse gas emissions to
new energy technologies.
Located in Palo Alto, the Innovation Center
Denmark aims to wed Danish ideas and firms with
the Silicon Valley's lucrative business potential.
Jointly funded by the Danish Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and the Danish Ministry of Science and
Technology, the Center opens at an opportune time
as concerns over conflict in the Middle East, high
gas prices and global warming have led President
George W. Bush to call for non-traditional energy
sources.

"ln a U.S. market eagerly looking
for fossil fuel alternatives, Denmark
has something to offer," stated the
Royal Danish Embassy in a press re
lease.
Its remarkable energy revolution
— progressing from 99 percent de
pendent on foreign oil to complete
ly independent, as well as 20 percent
wind powered, in only 32 years —
certainly shows Denmark has much
to offer in terms of energy models
for the U.S. Ilie country is also a net
exporter of energy, providing 40 per
cent of the world's wind energy. The
1973 oil embargo served as a wake
up call that motivated Danish offi
cials to develop alternative energy

technologies.
"[Denmark] leads the way in
using renewables in the energy mix."
Orr said. "They use lots of wind and
biomass [materials]."
Harnessing this knowledge is
only one of the goals of the new Cen
ter. Marianne Toftegaard Poulson,
the Center's director, envisions the
Center as an intermediary between
Danish-based companies and those
in the Silicon Valley.
"The opening of the center really
creates a win-win situation," Poulson
said. "Denmark has a lot to offer and
the Silicon Valley area is a perfect
market for the kind of technologies
Denmark specializes in."
Poulson also said she hopes the
Center will foster strong ties with the
Stanford community.
"University officials have been
very receptive," she said. "I view the
Center as building bridges. Hopeful

ly, by working closely with the Uni
versity we can create more opportu
nities for exchange between the two
countries, making it easier for re
searchers and students from both
countries to spend time working or
studying in Denmark and Silicon
Valley respectively."
Orr, who previously collaborated
with students and faculty from the
Technical University of Denmark,
reflected on the positive experience
and high quality research conduct
ed.
•'lliey've sent very capable PhD
students," Orr said." I've had two ab
solutely terrific post docs."
ITie grand opening of Innovation
Center Denmark will take place this
afternoon. Approximately 400
guests have been invited. Prince
Joachim will then head to Los Ange
les, where he will stay for two days
before flying to Beijing.
