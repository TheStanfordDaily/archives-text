## Danish prince pays a royal visit Delegation promotes its new reusable energy firm, opening today in Palo Alto 
### CASSIE HARVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While U.S. politicians and analysts clamor for re
newable energy in the wake of skyrocketing oil
prices, the Royal Highness Prince Joachim of Den
mark took action yesterday by visiting Stanford to
promote the launch of the Innovation Center Den
mark â€” a bridge firm for developing alternative
energy sources.
The prince and his delegation met with Univer
sity President John Hennessy and faculty to listen in
on presentations given by Prof. Franklin Orr, direc
tor of the Global Climate and Energy Project, and
Rosamond Naylor, senior fellow at the Institute for
International Studies. The presentations addressed
issues ranging from greenhouse gas emissions to
new energy technologies.
Located in Palo Alto, the Innovation Center
Denmark aims to wed Danish ideas and firms with
the Silicon Valley's lucrative business potential.
Jointly funded by the Danish Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and the Danish Ministry of Science and
Technology, the Center opens at an opportune time
as concerns over conflict in the Middle East, high
gas prices and global warming have led President
George W. Bush to call for non-traditional energy
sources.
