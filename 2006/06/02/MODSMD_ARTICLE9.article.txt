### ARAM HUR DESK EDITOR 
Stanford briefly went quiet yesterday morn
ing, as the University's phone service shut
down around campus and the hospital.The sys
tem blacked out at approximately 7:45 a.m. and
was restored shortly after two hours.
A flood in the communications closet at
Spruce Hall was the alleged cause, according an
email sent out to Rains Housing.
In the case of emergency, students were rec
ommended to reach 911 through personal cell
phones.
Stanford Hospital, which bore the brunt of
the technical glitch, sustained communication
through alternate phone lines for the emer
gency rooms.
No major accidents or inconveniences were
reported during the shutdown. The system was
back up and running by 11 a.m. Services to the
hospital were restored earlier, at approximate
ly 9:27 according to IT services.
