much as Stanford students love to whine about
dining hall food, they probably have less reason
to gripe than students at most other universities
in the nation. This year, Stanford Dining Enterprises
won the Ivy Award of Distinction and Dining Excel
lence, an annual award that the magazine "Restau
rants & Institutions" gives to six dining operations.
The magazine bases the award on votes from its
154,000 readers who want to recognize restaurants
and other dining enterprises that "demonstrate the
highest standards of excellence in food, service and
overall hospitality."
This year's other five winners were Boston College
in Chestnut Hill. Mass.; Commander's Palace,a restau
rant in Las Vegas, Nev.; mk the restaurant in Chicago,
Ill.;71ie Peabody, a hotel and restaurant in Orlando,
Fla.; and Trattoria dell'Arte, a restaurant in New York.
What underlies Stanford Dining's success is not
simply good food and friendly staff but also its com
mitment to the environment, according to Rafi
Taherian, executive director of Stanford Dining.
Indeed, in 2004 Santa Clara County granted uni
versity-wide Green Business Certification to Stan
ford University, which includes Stanford Dining. As
part of its certification, Stanford Dining "complies
with all applicable environmental regulations; con
serves energy, water, and other resources; imple
ments sound environmental practices that help pre
vent unnecessary pollution and waste generation;
and has environmentally responsible practices with
other businesses in our community," according to
Stanford Dining's Web site.
"We use composting for our food waste and we try
to be as energy efficient as possible," Taherian says.
"Whenever we renovate dining halls we try to add
vents and cooling systems that make sense and that
do not burn energy unnecessarily."
Stanford's is the first and only college dining oper

ation to obtain such certification, according to Eric
Montell, senior associate director of Student Dining,
Catering and Executive Services.
One perk resulting from Stanford's efforts to go
green is the plethora of organic food available in din
ing halls.
"We serve organic local produce during meal peri
ods," Montell says."The local aspect is most impor
tant to us so that we can reduce the amount of fuel
that is used in the transport of food."
Sometimes, Stanford Dining "features a produce
item that they buy from our local vendors," he contin
ues. "These have included heirloom tomatoes and va
rieties of apples, peas and carrots. Students have the
opportunity to try five or six different kinds of apples
or whatever it is we are featuring."
Many of these items appear at the salad bar, where
they are labeled so that students know where they
come from and who grows them, Montell says.
Other provisions that appear in dining halls in
clude local organic milk, meats and iced tea.
Another reason Stanford Dining is a stand out
among other college dining operations is that its staff
prioritizes service to the student community, the Uni
versity and surrounding areas,Taherian says. For ex
ample, the staff helps with community service proj
ects at Stanford such as Dance Marathon and volun
teers at several hunger alleviation programs in Menlo
Park and San Mateo.
Montell says that he has personally volunteered at
events such as these for a number of years.
"We care very much about the students here at
Stanford and work very hard at
what we do to make students lives better during their
time here," Montell says. "When you go
out into the community you are bringing that same
sense of caring and effort
to people that are in a less fortunate situation than
we. the Stanford community, are in. The joy and grat
itude that is shown to us at these events makes your

heart feel overwhelmed."
While the above initiatives often require signifi
cant effort, they do not detract from Stanford Din
ing's main function — providing lood to people on
the Farm. In fact, Taherian says they add to this goal.
"These dining halls are not just a place where stu
dents eat and leave," he explains. "We want it to be
their kitchen — a part of the Stanford experience —
just like when they go back home."
Taherian highlights Lakeside Dining as an exam
ple of the fact that the people make the dining expe
rience, attributing the turnaround of the food quality
at Lakeside to the new people working there.
"Jeannette Hayden, our new manager, has really
made a difference," he says.
Students at Lakeside Dining agree.
"Whenever I suggest some improvement or a pos
sible addition to the menu, Jeannette always tries to ac
commodate my requests," says junior Richard Norte.
Taherian also emphasizes the amount and quality
of food that students get for a relatively low price.
"You will not find a restaurant anywhere that
serves as much variety for eight dollars a meal,"
Taherian says. "In every one of our dining halls, we
will always have one red meat, white meat, vegetari
an and vegan dish prepared for each meal in addition
to our permanent grill, salad and fruit bars."
As for Stanford Dining's future plans?
"We want to add a late night diner in what is going
to be the new Old Union, where you can come and eat
burgers and such at 2 o'clock in the morning,"Taher
ian says.
All of these factors make Stanford Dining a role
model for the rest of the college dining industry.
"Universities and colleges from across the country
come and ask for tours so they can model our sys
tem," Taherian says. "At one point, we had so many
requests that we were thinking of creating a staff job
that would be solely responsible for providing tours
to various other collegiate dining operations staff."

ple of the fact that the people make the dining expe
rience, attributing the turnaround of the food quality
at Lakeside to the new people working there.
"Jeannette Hayden, our new manager, has really
made a difference," he says.
Students at Lakeside Dining agree.
"Whenever I suggest some improvement or a pos
sible addition to the menu, Jeannette always tries to ac
commodate my requests," says junior Richard Norte.
Taherian also emphasizes the amount and quality
of food that students get for a relatively low price.
"You will not find a restaurant anywhere that
serves as much variety for eight dollars a meal,"
Taherian says. "In every one of our dining halls, we
will always have one red meat, white meat, vegetari
an and vegan dish prepared for each meal in addition
to our permanent grill, salad and fruit bars."
As for Stanford Dining's future plans?
"We want to add a late night diner in what is going
to be the new Old Union, where you can come and eat
burgers and such at 2 o'clock in the morning,"Taher
ian says.
All of these factors make Stanford Dining a role
model for the rest of the college dining industry.
"Universities and colleges from across the country
come and ask for tours so they can model our sys
tem," Taherian says. "At one point, we had so many
requests that we were thinking of creating a staff job
that would be solely responsible for providing tours
to various other collegiate dining operations staff."
