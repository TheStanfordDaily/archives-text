# Cantor exhibit highlights conflict in art

Cantor Center for Visual Arts Co-Direc
tor Tom Seligman began his press speech
with an allusion to Pablo Picasso.
"We have graphs that show that mention
ing Picasso makes our public turnout sky
rocket," Seligman said cheekily.
The handful of intriguing Picasso pieces
that grace the walls at Cantor — especially
one that looks like a storyboard of emotive
Muppets, titled "Dreams and Lies of Fran
co" — fit seamlessly in with the theme of
conflict. But. those expecting merely an ex
hibit centered on Picasso's inner conflicts
will be blown away by the scope of the Can
tor's mind-boggling new collection.
Indeed there is nothing conflicting about
the madly diverse "Conflict and Art" exhib
it, which opened June 7 and runs through
August 27 at Cantor. Though the exhibit
notes declare that conflict is the "theme of
art in all forms." the brilliance of this exhibit
lies not in the shamelessly broad theme, but
in the sheer diversity of the pieces them
selves.
From stunningly ornate 18th-century
Japanese war dolls and a powerful image of
abolitionist John Brown (John Curry, 1934)
to photographs of sports players and a dark

ly humorous depiction of Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck in a bloodbath of decapitation
(by David Gilhooly, 1994), the exhibit strives
less for coherence and more a sneak peek at
the nearly 10,000 pieces that comprise Can
tor's full collection.
"I sometimes wonder why certain pieces
are here [in this collection] myself," Seligman
said during the exhibit's preview. "We own
things and we're proud of that. Conflict is a
subject that we all will interpret differently."
To be sure, the exhibit is very much a per
sonal experience; little is revealed about the
artists and the contexts of their work.
' The layout is loose and open ended,"
said Betsy Fryberger, who is Cantor's cura
tor and the co-creator of the exhibit. "We're
not trying to force you to have an opinion
one way or another. We want you to look at
the subject and think about that."
I'his is perhaps best reflected in the por
tion of the exhibit devoted to World War I
etchings. Patrons enter as though through a
trench tunnel with images hanging on both
sides: on the left wall, one finds English de
pictions of the war, and on the right. German
ones. The power of this display and the simi
larity between the pieces — an odd cloaked
skeleton appears in works from both nations
— is more unifying than polarizing. "Flut
ter." a piece created of brilliantly colorful

Korean Kozo paper, also embodies the ex
hibit's ambiguities of peace and war with its
intertwining cutout doves and fighter planes.
"It's unclear whether or not we've found
any positive results or solutions," Fryberger
said. "But that's our hope."
But war is far from the only subsection ex
plored in the exhibit. Another intriguing
piece, "Fighter Jet" (Rigo, 2001), remarkably
made only of pushpins, creates a staunch and
poignant portrait of a Native American. In
the collage "UtopianCannibal.org" (F.nrique
Chagoya, 2000), several folds cleverly com
ment on colonialism. In one powerful scene,
a white Barbie doll-looking figure gives birth
to a whole rainbow of stereotypes. The col
lection ends with a glass case of newspaper
clippings depicting conflict. Though tales of
conflict in newspapers might seem obvious
and ordinary, their inclusion reminds patrons
that the conflict is something that will follow
them out of the museum, for better or worse.
The Cantor Center for Visual Arts also
has its usual lineup of outdoor film screen
ings including "Chicken Run" (which are
rather tenuously tied to the theme of conflict,
but nice try. Cantor) and — slightly more rel
evant — lectures. For more information on
