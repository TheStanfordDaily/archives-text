## A 						note from the Editor in Chief The 						take away message 
### 
There's a fortune taped to the top of my
office's monitor, an artifact left over
from one of many takeout dinners —
a lost kernel of wisdom from my predecessor
and personal hero, Cynthia Cho. It reads:
"Everything will now come your way." At
first glance, this seemed a heartening fore
cast full of promise and, I dare say, inspira
tion. ITie dawn of a new day. And, for the
most part, it was.
I am writing to you from a Daily office
profoundly changed from the one I arrived
at in September. It is an office where bad UP
Jon covers play freely over the intercom and
editors swing golf clubs to brainstorm.
Where staffers drop by on their nights off
just to plop down on a futon and take in the
general hilarity that defines most days here,
our perennial home. Combine this with pro
fessionalism (not to mention responsibility)
beyond our years and the ability to truly
make a difference, and I'm convinced that
we Dailyites are among the luckiest students
at Stanford. 1 know, after everything that has
happened this year, this is the feeling I will
remember years from now.
Indeed, the fortune stuck true to its word
— everything did come my way, including the
bad. the ugly and the challenging. Every vol
ume has its share of hardships, and at the end
of it all, I believe that we navigated them the
best we could. The recent Editorial Board
willingly entered several minefields in hopes
of stirring campus dialogue, and the News
Department chipped away at a handful of
ambitious stories. Hut even when times got
tough, we never strayed from our purpose to
inform, and — with any luck — entertain our
readers. We stood firm whenever we could
and corrected ourselves when necessary. And
in this, we were ultimately successful.
In the past, departing editors in chief
have used this space to reflect on their expe
riences. the battles won and lost. And every
thing they wrote, I realize, applies to me as
well. I too was unable to reply to every email,
return every phone message and respond
personally to every concern. There are defi
nitely things I would have done differently if

given the chance, and I encountered my fair
share of technical difficulties and strong per
sonalities. These are simple truths of the
trade, and all any respectable editor in chief
can do is promise and strive to do better. I
wish my successors the best of luck in this en
deavor, and sincerely hope that you, our
sources, readers, classmates and teachers,
will help them along the way.
Phis gets at what I really want to say. Sit
ting here at my desk. 1 turn my head one way
and meet eyes with Business Manager and
former Editor in Chief Brendan Marten,
someone who has influenced me greatly and
buttressed my spirits on a rolling basis. I turn
the other way and see my heir. Patrick
Fitzgerald, a young Tom Friedman in the
making who I'm certain will take this paper
to even higher heights. And I realize that ties
like these, the kind that can make you so
overwhelmingly proud of a peer, exist few
other places at this age. I know that 1 will re
main forever in awe of those who came be
fore me, and that I will continue to read The
Daily for at least the next four years to wit
ness the ascent of the freshmen 1 have come
to know so well.
I thank you, staffers of volumes 228 and
229, for everything you have brought to this
paper and to my life. Congratulations on a
job beautifully done.
And even though it was Cynthia's thumb
that scotch-taped my fortune into Daily his
tory, I want to offer it up as a message to any
one who is reading this right now. whether
you are fated to sit in this chair or have never
even read this paper before. Everything will
now come your way, and as long as you have
the right people next to you. the world will
be yours for the taking.

Camille Ricketts
Editor in Chief, Volume 228-229
