# Could it be magic?
## 
### 
As a dedicated geek I read a lot of fan
tasy stories. You know, dragons,
swords,fairies, demons and above all
magic. Why magic? Well mostly because I'm
a miserable loser with no social life, but also
because 1 figure that being a physicist isn't
enough — I really need something more to
ensure no one responds to my J-date ad.
A shade more seriously, escapism is a
wonderful thing. Fantasy is, for all intents
and purposes, just like reality. Only better.
And of course, while I like the idea of
casting spells, of imposing my will on the
world, I do recognize that life doesn't really
work like that. You.on the other hand.don't.
Actually, it's not you per se (though this is
certainly a youth problem as well), rather it's
everyone who opens their mouth during grad
uation weekend and tries to say Something.
Advice (as I've mentioned recently) is
rarely as altruistic as one expects. Further
more, at such emotional events as your tran
sition from child to man(woman)-child, the
advice is usually wrong.
According to some large fraction of par
ents you can achieve whatever you want in
life. It just takes Will.
Ah. Will.The Will to succeed.The Will not
to fail. The Will to sleep with a model
(though 1 suppose that's not PGI3). With all
these Wills at your disposal, life and its ob
stacles will undoubtedly crumble before you
and ensure happiness and long life. If only.
A notion that Will can be made real lies at
the heart of magic. That is to say the thought
that wishes can come true operates at a sim
ilar level of rationality as fairies.
A cursor)' glance might mislead you into
thinking that my Will diatribe is somewhat
of a canard. In the end, if you can't hear in
spirational nonsense when you graduate,
when can you? Well, never would be more
appropriate.
After all, we frown upon fantasy in aca
demic life. You've spent four (or five or nine
plus) years learning how to think rationally;to
throw that intellectual rigor away for the fleet
ing pleasure of a pep talk seems a little cheap.

Absorbing (and dismissing) the nonsense
that gets thrown around at Significant Mo
ments is usually pretty easy.
Any practiced follower of politics should
have no trouble processing the junk that gets
spewed out during election season. And
(hopefully) everyone laughed at Bill Pull
man's Independence Day speech. Such dis
crimination is, however, harder to pull off
when you're no longer on the outside.
As a participant in the festivities (even
worse, as the centerpiece of them) it is quite
difficult to take a step back. In fact, it's al
most impossible not to lose yourself in the
magic...
"Abracadabra! Roll up. roll up! Come and
see how the world can be yours! Just believe
in yourself and nothing is beyond your reach!
A Want, and what you want will be yours.
A Wish, and your wishes are the world's com
mands. A Will and nothing can stop you."
A captivating pitch, to be sure. Who
wouldn't like to have their every desire ful
filled just by coveting it enough? Who
wouldn't want? Who wouldn't wish?
Alas, this is not the way it goes. Life will
not present you with your dreams. If you're
like the rest of us (and you are) it will kick
you in the teeth, stomp on your kneecaps
and leave you to perpetuate the noble falla
cy of destiny for the next generation.
Congratulations.
