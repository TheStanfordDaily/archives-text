In support of Joel Beinin

As students and colleagues of Professor
of History Joel Beinin. we are writing to ex
press our collective support for Beinin fol
lowing the publication of his photo on the
cover of David Horowitz's book, "Campus
Support for Terrorism." Suggesting that
Beinin supports terrorism is a ludicrous
and blatant attempt to destroy his reputa
tion. This act is an insult not only to Beinin.
his students and the University, but to every
American who believes in the right to
speak without intimidation and fear.
At this vital moment, as America's in
volvement in the Middle East has height
ened, we should be engaging in an informed
debate based on facts and experience in
order to find new solutions, not distracted
by personal attacks and conspiratorial in
nuendo. Sadly, we must first defend Beinin
and countless other Middle East scholars,
our greatest resources in this debate,
against such attacks.
One need look no further than Beinin's
former students to grasp his immeasurable
contribution to the Middle East. From
Fulbright scholars to NGO managers to
policy advisors to United Nations consult
ants, many of us have lived, or currently
work, in the Middle East. While not all of
us agree with Beinin's position on each
issue, we all strongly believe in the right to
hold an informed opinion and to voice that
opinion without being pilloried. Beinin is
a vital and respected contributor to the
ongoing debate on America's role in the
Middle East. His voice must continue to
be heard, not silenced by those who seek
to discredit him.
