# Commencement address
## 
### 
I have prepared a commencement speech
in the event that Mr. Brokaw calls in sick.
I'm no Katie Couric. which hopefully
means I'll be a welcomed replacement.
Welcome to Stanford, parents, friends
and alumni. I hope your trip here was pleas
ant. Unfortunately, due to construction, I
know many were disappointed that we had
to redirect parking from near Palm Drive to
just outside of Redwood City.The universi
ty assures us though that these buildings
will be completed by 2040. That's just in
time for your grandkids to apply! Pause for
applause.
In my time at Stanford, there are certain
ideals that I believe have embodied my per
sonal experience. If you don't mind, I'd like
to share them with you. Take sip from water

cup, make eyes at cute blond in front.
First of all, I'd like to talk to you about
resourcefulness. What 1 mean is, there is a
certain time of the year, that if you play
your cards right, you can absolutely corner
the used furniture racket. Every entering
freshman purchases practical, cheap Ikea
brand futons. By the end of their four years,
the graduating senior only sees the memo
ries of drunken hookups with their TA, the
time they broke up with their I-Hum TF,
etc. The student wants the futon now as
much Oasis wants to have their own reality
show. Apparently, students taking Gold
man Sachs internships don't need futons or
their refrigerator. At Goldman Sachs, you
do not sleep. You do not eat. You are the fu
ture of investment banking. Now go make

me coffee, bitch intern.
Sensitivity. 1 don't just mean when you go
to strip clubs, it takes "sensitivity" to realize
that throwing Sacagawea dollars at the strip
pers isn't preferred. In business, I've learned
that my customers demand high quality fu
tons and refrigerators, and thus I will proba
bly at my own convenience throw some
Febreze on the futons before I sell them. Lis
tening is also an important aspect of business.
I listen when my customers say "what's that
smell?" and I'll tell them "money."
I've also learned to listen to my readers.
When they say "you are a bigot/against reli
gious freedom/prejudiced towards specific
groups," what they mean is "you've made fun
of my group and I'm going to ignore the fact
that after 80 columns, you've made fun of ba
sically everyone. I'm going to ignore it be
cause I lack a sense of humor."
Dynamicisim. For the youngsters in the
crowd, I want to offer you some advice.
While you could invite your family to grad

uation to thank them for all of the money
they spent on your education, why not start
paying them back now by selling their tick
ets? At Stanford, I've learned a great deal
about supply and demand. Tickets are in
high demand these days, and how are the
cops going to tell one kid in a black clad
robe from another? How are they going to
know which one is scalping tickets? Here's a
hint: It'll be the one laughing his way to a
successful business future.
Discovery. At Stanford. I've learned to ex
pand my mind. I mean, I don't do drugs. But

every time Igo to Columbae or EBFI always
have great conversations with people. Like
just last week, we spent three hours dis
cussing whether French astronauts would be
called Hugonauts. Every time I go, they put
on that magic fog machine, burn some good
incense and play some really groovy tunes. I
always leave with peace of mind and for
some reason, the munchies. Before you and
your parents go. take the entire family to one
of these events.
Resourcefulness. Sensitivity. Dynami
cism. Discovery. Most of all. Stanford has af
forded me important Power Point presenta
tion skills that center on cliche words. This
will serve me well in my future career in mid
dle management.Thank you, and congratula
tions seniors. Your futons will help me build
my future.

At this point in his speech, Chris would sign the
shocker and holt before security caught him.
