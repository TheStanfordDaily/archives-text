# The 						sacredness of Nations

Throughout the centuries, men have adopted many different
forms of government, ranging from the most despotic to the most
egalitarian. Today, most countries have opted for a democratic
form, dial is, one elected by popular vote for one or oilier political
party. It is assumed diat the voting system used is fair, honest, free
from malpractice and fraud.
Unfortunately, -as recent history shows, this is often not die
case, even in those countries which lay great stress on the probity
of their election process. Deception and duplicity abound, men
and factions are brought to power by chicanery and guile.
More authoritarian are those one-party slates where deci
sions are made by a committee of 'strong men' backed by the army
and police. The people have little say in the laws which rule them
and often, as yet, do not feel the need to claim such rights.
Some countries are in the grip of cruel despots, hungry for
power and the wealth which comes with it. Some are ruled by
deluded zealots, sure that they and their followers are in the hands
of God and are carrying out His plans. Others are struggling to help
their people out of poverty and pain, and to fend off the demands
of their wealthy neighbors. Still odiers are fighting for their inde
pendence or are engulfed in chaos and civil war.
Men must take to heart the lesson from this evidence: many
are the ways of organizing the needs of different peoples. Greater
tolerance, therefore, is necessary in the approach to this vital mat
ter. The energies of the rays governing the nations are different and

require different structures in which to express their qualities. It is
not the evolutionary Plan that one form of government, democrat
ic or otherwise, should prevail. The needs of men are more real
and more important than ideologies. Tolerance of difference
unites, while ideologies divide.
When Maitreya* speaks openly, therefore, He will show that
unity in diversity is the key to future harmony. That all the nations
have a destiny, unique and sacred He will point the way to
achieve this blessed state and encourage men to open dieir hearts
to a wiser understanding of the Plan. Under Maitreya's guidance,
men will come to appreciate and value the richness of the achieve
ments of themselves and others. The urge to compete and to dom
inate will gradually subside and a new chapter will open for men
in brotherhood and peace.
