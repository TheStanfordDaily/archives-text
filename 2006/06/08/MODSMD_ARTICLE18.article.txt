## HORNS GET THE HOOK Cardinal advance out of Austin Regional with two wins over North Carolina State, victory over No. 3 national seed Texas 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
With a storied rivalry between the teams,
and with unranked Stanford having already
taken a series from defending national cham
pion Texas earlier this year. Saturday's Austin
NCAA Regional match-up between the Car
dinal and the Longhorns was already interest
ing enough. A grand slam from senior catcher
John Hester and a come-from-behind 12-8 win
only added to the excitement.
But even more fascinating was that by the
end of the weekend, Stanford (33-25) had
taken the Regional title game 17-7 to move on
to face Oregon State in the Super Regional in
Corvallis (check this on Tuesday). The mighty
Longhorns (41-21), the defending national
champions, the No. 3 ranked team in the coun
try and the clear favorite heading into the
Austin Regional, were eliminated from the
postseason after a 1-2 performance at their
home diamond.
After beating No. 2 seed North Carolina
State by a score of 7-2 on Friday, the Cardi
nal faced the Longhorns in front of 5,420
fans at Disch-Falk field in Austin, Tex.
Sophomore Nolan Gallagher took the ball
for the Cardinal, but the righthander faced
trouble in the first inning, scattering three
runs on four hits.
Down 3-0, Stanford came from behind in
the second inning to take the lead for good.
After three straight singles from sophomore
Michael Taylor, senior Chris Lewis and fresh
man Jason Castro, Hester — who missed nine
games in May due to a knee infection — saw a
pitch he liked and drove it to left-center for a
homerun.
"The fact that we were down by three and
then gained the lead with one swing of the bat
really turned the game around," Hester said.
"Most importantly, it wasn't just that one hit.
We stayed after it with the bats for the whole
game. 1 can't remember the last [grand slam] I
hit. It might have been before high school, but
I'll definitely remember this one."
The No. 3-seeded Cardinal got two more
runs off of Texas hurler Kyle McCulloch in the
game.
In the fifth,Taylor, Lewis, Castro and Hes

ter reached base consecutively again, scoring
Taylor. With the score at 6-4. Joseph Krebs
came on in relief of McCullough. After a
Randy Molina strikeout, an error by Texas'
first baseman led to two unearned Stanford
runs. A walk and a single that inning brought
in Stanford's ninth run of the game, which the
Cardinal would later need.
The Longhorns. Austin's No. 1 seed, had
added one run in the fourth, but they present
ed their largest threat in the seventh. A strike
out and groundout led off the Texas seventh,
but a single and walk set the stage for Texas'
leading hitter. Drew Stubbs. Stubbs doubled
down the leftfield line for two RBI. and. two
singles later, the Longhorns had two more
runs.
But Stanford righthander Erik Davis
stepped up to toss a one-two-three eighth.
Stanford added three more runs that inning,
and only Stubbs got on base with a walk in the
top of the ninth.
"That was a big outing for Erik Davis,"
Coach Mark Marquess said. "He's done that a
couple of other times this year, but nothing
bigger than this."
Hester finished 2-for-4 with four RBI,
while Stubbs also went 2-for-4 with two RBI.
Gallagher got the win while Davis earned the
save. Texas was eliminated in a 6-3 loss to the
Wolfpack on Sunday morning.
On Sunday afternoon, the Cardinal once
again faced NC-State (40-23), in just the sec
ond meeting of the two programs. The Wolf
pack kept the score close throughout the five
innings, but after that, the Cardinal offense ex
ploded.
"We knew about North Carolina State's of
fense, and we knew it was going to be a dog
fight," Taylor said. "We knew we had to keep
the pedal to the floor, keep grinding for some
runs and not let them get comfortable with
coming back."
Stanford scored 12 of their runs in the final
four frames, including six to shut the door in
the ninth. With the 17-7 win, Stanford — an
underdog in the Regional — moved on to the
next round of NCAA Tournament play.
"When you score 17 runs, you should win."
Marquess said.
Freshman Jeremy Bleich started for Stan

ford, and freshman Austin Yount got the win,
limiting the Wolfpack to one hit and two runs
in 3 1/3 innings of work. Davis added another
save to his record.
Minaker — who was named Most Out
standing Player of the Regional — had a ca
reer-day at the plate, scoring six runs. He also
had two RBI, two doubles,a triple and went 5-
for-5. Taylor was 4-for-4 with four RBI. while
junior Ryan Seawell was 4-6 with three RBI.
Eight NC-State pitchers took the mound
and the loss went to relief pitcher Chris Engle
(1 1/3 IP, 2 H,2 R). Aaron Bates led his team's
offense, scoring three runs and batting in an
other three in a 4-4 day at the plate.
Stanford last made it to a Super Regional in
20()3, which the team won en route to a runner
up finish in the College World Series.

the pedal to the floor, keep grinding for some
runs and not let them get comfortable with
coming back."
Stanford scored 12 of their runs in the final
four frames, including six to shut the door in
the ninth. With the 17-7 win, Stanford — an
