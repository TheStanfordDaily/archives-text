## Seven drafted, Card head for Corvallis 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal last visited Oregon State two
months ago in early April, but the outcome of
that weekend likely left the members of the
Stanford squad feeling that one trip to Cor
vallis, Ore., was more than enough for the
year.
In three games against the Beavers, the
Cardinal managed to collect only 10 hits and a
single run. Not surprisingly, Oregon State
swept the Cardinal out of town in convincing
fashion, taking the weekend's three games by
final scores of 3-0,1-0, and 12-1.
But Stanford's fortunes have since changed
for the better. And after knocking off defending

national champion Texas and North Carolina
State in last weekend's Austin Regional, the Car
dinal (33-25) will return to Corvallis this week
end to take on the Pac-10 champion Beavers
(42-14) in a best-of-three Super Regional series.
But despite their struggles against Oregon
State earlier this season, every member of the
Stanford squad is thrilled to be squaring off
with the Beavers for a berth in this year's Col
lege World Series.
"It's a great opportunity any time you get
another chance against a team that pretty
much embarrassed you," senior second base
man Chris Lewis said. "We're going to get the
best of what they've got, they're going to get
the best of what we've got, and we'll see who
comes out on top."

The Cardinal know that they will need to
be on top of their game on both sides of the
ball this weekend — but the team's offensive
outburst and solid pitching in Austin last
weekend have confidence running high.
"The difference has been day and night,"
sophomore outfielder Michael Taylor said in
reference to the change his team has undergone
since its last trip to OSU."Our series against [the
Beavers earlier this year] was pretty much rock
bottom. But we re a completely different team
now, and we're excited to be going up there."
Senior shortstop Chris Minaker empha
sized the challenge that the Cardinal will
face against Oregon State's tough pitching
corps.
"They're one of the best pitching staffs in

the country, so it'll be imperative to come out
swinging the bats and take a lead early," said
Minaker, who was a 1 Oth round draft pick of
the Seattle Mariners in this year's 2006 MLB
First-Year Player Draft. "As the old adage
goes, good pitching beats good hitting, and
their arms are second to none."
But the Cardinal will be sending a first
round draft pick to the mound in their Super
Regional series opener this Saturday
evening.
Junior righthander Greg Reynolds, the 6-
foot-7 ace of the Stanford pitching staff, was
taken second overall by the Colorado Rockies
on TUesday morning. The selection made
Reynolds one of only two Stanford players to
be taken No. 2 in the draft, tying him with
Steve Dunning (1970) as the highest draft pick
ever to come off the Farm.
Reynolds went 7-5 this season with a 3.36
ERA as the Cardinal's Friday night starter.The
righthander has shown his mettle down the
stretch, tossing complete games in five of his
last six starts with a 2.47 ERA during that
stretch.
"It's truly an honor to be up there with all
the other great players who have come through
here and to leave my mark on a program that
has such prestige and tradition," Reynolds said.
"But I'm still in a state of shock, and it won't
sink in for awhile. It's a dream come true."
Reynolds indicated that he hopes to resolve
all the contract matters in quick fashion and
close out his collegiate career on a strong note -
an effort which starts this weekend in Corvallis.
"I'll be a quick sign," he said."! don't believe
in holding out, and I think I'll be as happy as
they come."
Stanford had five other players taken in this
year's draft — senior catcher John Hester (13th
round. Arizona Diamondbacks), junior pitcher
Blake Holler (13th round, Los Angeles Angels
of Anaheim), Matt Manship (29th round, Oak
land Athletics), Chris Lewis (32nd round, Los
Angeles Angels of Anaheim) and Jim Rapoport
(35th round, St. Louis Cardinals).
