## University defends hire policy Texas paper reported Stanford janitor entered U.S. illegally 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The University vigorously defended its
employment verification process this week
after a Texas newspaper anonymously quoted
a Stanford janitor it reported had entered the
country illegally.
The Brownsville (Texas) Herald quoted an
illegal immigrant who has been working at
Stanford for five years.The man featured in the
May 26 story — who "asked to remain anony
mous for fear of discovery" — said he would
like to join the Army under a provision in the
Senate immigration bill passed last month.
The University defended its verification
process, with officials saying that it follows the
law and acts in good faith to hire only legal work
ers.
"I suppose it is always possible that someone
could forge documents, but we're very careful
about the process that we follow" said Diane
Peck, the director of Human Resources.
All U.S. employers are legally required to
have workers complete 1-9 forms — the stan
dard document that proves eligibility to work in
the United States. At Stanford, workers must
turn the forms in within three days of beginning
employment. The human resource officer or
the hiring supervisor checks the documents, ac
cording to Kate Chesley, the associate director
of University Communications.
Payroll staff members also review each 1-9
form. If a form is found to be expired, missing or
incomplete, the University communicates with
the worker. Paychecks are held until the re
quired documents are presented.
"Stanford takes the 1-9 process of validating
employment status very seriously and has a
number of procedures in place to en
sure that we act in good faith in com
pliance with the law." Chesley said.
"Falsification of any employment-re
lated information is grounds for termi
nation."
The University highlighted its par
ticipation in the Employment Verifica
tion Service program. Personnel offi
cials said that the University has been
carefully watching the development of
new programs.
"We can generate a file of names.
Social Security Numbers, gender, and
dates of birth and ask the federal gov
ernment to search for discrepancies
and inconsistencies," Chesley said.
There are no reliable estimates on
the number of undocumented workers
who could be employed on campus.
"I don't know that anyone's using
papers falsely," said local union leader
Greg Pullman, the staff director for
SEIU Local 715. "There are all sorts of
reasons why people's social security
numbers don't match."
Peck said the University has no
plans to investigate the story and at
tempt to discover who the worker
could have been.
"If it's a person quoted anony
mously, 1 don't know how we wouid
follow up," she said.

CONTRACTORS COULD BE
SOURCE OF ILLEGAL HIKINGS
The University's extensive use of
contractors on campus could be a po
tential source of any illegal immi
grants working on campus. Student
group coordinators, union leaders
and University officials each men
tioned contracting jobs as a likely
way an undocumented worker could
gain employment.
"The University holds itself more
accountable to its directly hired work
ers, but the majority of the low wage
workers are subcontracted out, which
allows the University to pass the re
sponsibility of worker rights to the
contracted company," said Immi
grants' Rights Coalition member
Frankie Preciado, a junior majoring in
political science and Chicano Studies.
Contractors are still required to
comply with federal, state and local
law.
"Most of the University's janitors
are employed through a subcontrac
tor," Chesley said. "Failing to comply
with those laws would be a breach of
contract."
Some union leaders take a different
position, criticizing laws that, they say,
make an essential activity illegal.
"We don't think work should be
criminalized," Pullman said. "There
are people here who just want to work
hard, pay taxes and contribute to soci
ety. And they should be able to do that.
It shouldn't be a criminal act to try to

feed your family."
Pullman said SEIU 715 does not
check immigration status when new
members join.
"If they work for one of our em
ployers. they are welcome into our
union." he commented. "We don't
think workers can win good wages and
benefits if they are divided between
legal and illegal."
TOUGHER EMPLOYER
SANCTIONS
The US. Citizenship and Immigra
tion Service (USCIS) requires that if
the documents presented by workers
"reasonably appear on their face to be
genuine and to relate to the person pre
senting them, you must accept them."
"To do otherwise," the USCIS Web
site cautions employers, "could be an
unfair immigration-related employ
ment practice."
The statute specifies that if the 1-9
form is properly completed and the
worker later turns out to have used
false documents, the employer has a
good faith defense against any penal
ties. The government must demon
strate that an employer had actual
knowledge of a worker's unauthorized
status to levy fines or punishment.
President George W. Bush said last
week that the penalties for "unscrupu
lous employers" who hire illegal
workers are too soft. Employers who
don't properly check paperwork for
new workers often face penalties as
small as $100. Employers caught in

tentionally hiring an illegal immigrant
face minimum fines of $250, which
critics deride as a slap on the wrist.
Bush, a staunch ally of the business
community, has said that the shadow
economy created by easy hiring en
courages more illegal immigration.
"You might as well pay a speeding
ticket," Bush told the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce last Thursday. "We got to
increase the penalties. If we want to be
smart about work site enforcement,
we got to say to somebody who's
breaking the law. there's going to be a
cost, and it's more than $250."
Peck said that the University will
fully comply with any new federal
rules pertaining to immigration and
employment checks.
"We take very seriously our respon
sibility to obey the law," she said. "If
there was a change, we would comply."
A union spokesman criticized
tougher penalties on employers and said
that Stanford should not be put in the
business of being the immigration police
when it comes to verifying paperwork.
"It's not the University's job," Pull
man said. "The University is not the
INS."
Preciado said the debate over em
ployer sanctions should be more about
the enforcement than the amount.
"The fastest growing economic sec
tor in the U.S. is the service sector, where
employers do not have the incentives to
thoroughly enforce the laws since their
economic well-being is supported by ex
ploited cheap labor." he said.
