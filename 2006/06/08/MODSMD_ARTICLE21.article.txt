## Saying adios to the Farm 
### 
This is my last column, and I
want to start by saying thank
you. Thank you to the Stan
ford Athletic community for allow
ing me to be a part of the greatest col
lege sports program in the country
for soon-to-be a 12th year in a row.
There is no other place in the
world like Stanford University. We
sit as a unique combination of elite
academics and unparalleled athlet
ics. We are half-NCAA Champions,
half-Nobel laureates.
In my four years here, I have pro
cured neither a Nobel nor a champi
onship (with the exception of IM soft
ball last year, no big deal). Most of us
haven't, and odds aren't in our favor.
Nonetheless, I've been a part of some
amazing victories, painful losses and
altogether remarkable moments.
My favorites? Nine team champi
onships are a good place to start. I
was lucky enough to cover one of
them (women's volleyball, 2004) for
the Daily, and attend another (men's
water polo, 2002). Among the others:
women's tennis (3), men's and
women's cross country, and women's
water polo. That doesn't even begin
to touch on the dozens of top-five
finishes over the last four years, or
any of the individual championships.
How about an incredible season?
Men's basketball during the 2004 sea
son was possibly the greatest season
I've ever seen that didn't end in a
championship. I got to cover the squad
through its 30-2 season for KZSU
radio. I was there for "The Shot",
when Nick Robinson broke the heart
of Arizona and kept us going. I was
there when the squad scored six points
in the last 10 seconds against Washing
ton State, capped off by Matt Lottich's
knockdown three as time expired. I
was there when the streak ended in
Seattle, and there when the Crimson
Tide put a premature end to what
would have been Stanford's first
men's basketball title since the 19405.
The bad? There's not much to com
plain about here, but let's be honest:
Buddy Teevins. That guy single-hand
edly took a strong football program
and turned us into a team that was the
first not to win the Axe in our four
years here. We're the first class to go
without a bowl appearance in nearly
20 years. The lowest of the low came
against No. 1 and undefeated USC in
the 2004 season, when the team
played out of its collective mind to
take a 28-17 lead at halftime. In the
second half, Buddyball took over
though,yielding zero offense in one of
the worst squanderings I've ever wit
nessed, as the Cardinal lost, 31-28...a1l
we needed was a friggin' field goal.
The heartbreak takes a bit longer
to sort out. Stanford has been on the
brink so many times only to have the
elusive championship slip away.
Take, for example, baseball's 2003
season, which ended with a champi
onship series loss to Rice. Why was
this so heartbreaking? Because until
Kodiak Quick threw the ball into
rightfield on a routine grounder,
Stanford looked poised to take the
first game of the series. They would
win the second, and ultimately be
crushed in the rubber game.
How about water polo? How
many years in a row can a team come
in second? In the past three seasons,
USC and UCLA have won the titles
in years that Stanford has beaten
them in the regular season, and their
championship wins have come on
one-goal victories all three times.
For me though, the best part about
the Stanford sports community is how
it pervades through the entire student
body. I've been on a varsity team,row
ing crew my freshman year (congrat
ulations on all the success this year,
guys â€” especially my good friend Je
remy Barton, who went out a champi
on). I've played club sports for the
past three years on the men's lacrosse
team. I've written about national
champions, broadcast three sports,
played at every level imaginable
(don't forget that IM championship
now), and loved every minute of it.
These are just the times I personal
ly remember.There are probably hun
dreds of other great moments that I
didn't get to see. So as my time at Stan
ford draws to a close, I consider myself
lucky to have been a part of something
so special. Nowhere else in the world is
like The Farm, and I want to thank
each and every one of you for doing
your part.
Go Stanford, Beat Cal.
