## New stadium progressing as planned 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
When Stanford kicks off its 2(X)6 home football
season on September 16, it will be in the brand-new
$90 million Stanford Stadium. A ten-month over
haul which began with the demolition of the 85-year
old stadium is slated to be completed just in time for
the Cardinal to take the field with Navy.
The teams had barely left the field on November
26 when the heavy machinery came out and the dem
olition began. It was the latest in a string of seasons to
forget and time for a new start for Stanford football.
In an open letter from September 2005, then-
Athletic Director Ted Leland said, "The new Stan
ford Stadium will be the single most important cap
ital project in the history of Stanford Athletics. A
new stadium means a solid financial future for the

Athletic Department as a whole, guaranteeing a re
liable source of annual revenue for the benefit of all
of Stanford's varsity sports."
Because of some delays related to an unusually
wet winter, the originally scheduled home opener
against San Jose State was moved to the Spartan s
home stadium.but the new stadium should be ready
to go for the Navy game and will welcome the stu
dent body at the first home game of the academic
year against Washington State on September 23.
When the plans were approved for the replace
ment of the old Stanford Stadium, the major goals
were to shrink the capacity of an 85,(XX)-seat stadium
that rarely sold out, to better sightlines and fan com
fort and to improve public safety and compliance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The planned 50,(XX)-seat capacity should elimi
nate the quiet and sparse fans that have character
ized Stanford football games for the past few years.
According to the website about the stadium project,
the average attendance over the past eight years is
just 39,(XX)-less than half the capacity of the old sta
dium-and Big Games have drawn an average of
60,(XX). The stadium will no longer be able to hold
these rare large crowds, but will likely be near capac
ity at every home game.
One of the biggest differences will be the elimina
tion of the track which went around the field, bring
ing the crowd closer to the action. The front row of
seats on the sideline will be 70 feet closer than they
were in the old stadium and the farthest seats will
move 85 feet closer. In the end zones, the difference
will be 75 feet from the front and 1(X) from the back.
The new stadium will have 502 disabled seats,
whereas the old stadium had only 67. Each seat will

be three inches wider than before and there will now
be seats with backs throughout the stadium, replac
ing the benches in the student section and else
where. The new plan also includes a scoreboard at
each end, rather than only in the north end zone, and
86 more women's restrooms.
The prime seats at midfield, reserved for mem
bers of the Buck/Cardinal Champions Fund, have
already sold out, as have the sections reserved for
faculty and alumni. More than 3500 seats in the
lower bowl are reserved for the Red Zone student
section, which is offering free tickets to every under
graduate and graduate student, thanks to an anony
mous donor who picked up the tab.
The original Stanford Stadium was constructed
in four months in 1921 on a $200,000 budget in a race
with cross-bay rival California. The Cardinal scored
the first touchdown in the new venue in the 1921 Big
Game, though Cal won that game 42-7.
The largest crowd ever in the old stadium was a
beyond-capacity 94,000 people who watched the
Cardinal shut out the Bears. 13-0, in the 1935 Big
Game, weeks before Stanford brought home a Rose
Bowl win.
Since then, the stadium has been home to Super
Bowl XIX — in which former Stanford coach Bill
Walsh led the San Francisco 49ers to a 38-16 victory
over the Miami Dolphins — and Olympic and
World Cup soccer matches. In 1999, the United
States beat Brazil in the semifinals of the Women's
World Cup en route to winning the tournament.
For many years, Stanford Commencement has
been held in that stadium and in 1928 it was the site
of Herbert Hoover's acceptance speech for the Re
publican presidential nomination.
