## Varsity eight out, still solid showing 
### JOHN CHOCK STAFF WRITER 
In a reversal of the events of 1849,
several Pac-10 crews went east for
gold last weekend. Plunging their
oars into the flooded waters of New
Jersey's Lake Mercer, a formidable
trio of West Coast crews came up
with six of the eight gold medals
awarded to heavyweight men in Sat
urday's Intercollegiate Rowing As
sociation championship regatta.
The Stanford men led the way
with three of the nuggets, while Wash
ington grabbed a pair and California
brought home the coveted varsity
eight title, ousting top-ranked Prince
ton by two seconds. The Bears also
laid claim to the team title after edg
ing three-time defending champion
Harvard by a single point, 196-195.
The Huskies finished third in the
team standings, two shy of the Crim
son.
But precious medals were no con
solation for the Cardinal, who after

winning three of their four events
had the displeasure of watching six
other teams vie for the varsity eight
crown.
Stanford's No. 3 ranked crew —
the only crew to defeat newly
crowned champion California this
year — withdrew from the event
prior to the championships following
an unresolved dispute with IRA or
ganizers over the eligibility of a first
year rower.The controversial official
ruling, which prohibited Cardinal
oarsmen Mark Murphy from com
peting due to his status as a first-year
student on the Farm, resulted from a
unique regulation of the Eastern
College Athletic Conference, the na
tional regatta's sponsor.
"We were dealt a pretty devastat
ing blow by the IRA," said junior
Donny Simkin, whose coxed varsity
four won Stanford's third gold medal
Saturday. "We work so hard, and we
sacrifice so much, and we've never
been as good as we were this year.
And to have that opportunity [to

race in the varsity eight] taken away
from us by what are supposed to be
the guardians of our sport and its ath
letes— the stewards of the IRA —
is a disappointment that burns with a
deep bitterness."
"Here at Stanford we are still con
vinced we belonged and earned the
right to race in the varsity eight race "
Coach Craig Amerkhanian said. "It
is a shame the politics of a few can af
fect so many."
But even the dispute couldn't take
all the shine off Stanford's hat trick.
"Stanford Crew was proud to
take gold medals in three of the four
events," coterm student Peter Fryk
man said. Frykman and senior Jere
my Barton raced in the pair competi
tion. trading leads twice with Cal be
fore taking control of the race at
1 ,(XX) meters.
The Cardinal pair finished three
seconds in front of Wisconsin, and 10
ahead of third-place Cornell.
The day's biggest margin of victo
ry in any event belonged to the Stan
ford varsity four with coxswain, who
finished seven seconds ahead of sil
ver medalist Cal. Junior Alex Garcia
coxed the crew of Simkin, sopho
more Silas Stafford and juniors
Kevin Baum and Nate Rooks.
Stanford's freshman four of
Peter Belisle, Charles Lilly, Mark
Murphy and Alex Osborne, coxed
by Graham Carroll, bested Wiscon
sin by more than three seconds to
win their event. The Cardinal varsi
ty four without coxswain finished
fifth.
Next stop for the Card will be the
foot of the Chiltern Hills in Henley
on-Thames, U.K.. where Stanford's
entire varsity eight will compete in
the Henley Royal Regatta, June 28-
July 3.
"We are excited to represent Stan
ford abroad," Amerkhanian said.
The No. 6 Cardinal lightweight
women also competed in the IRA re
gatta. riding season-best perform
ances in the preliminary heat and
repechage to lane one of the Petite
Final. But a strong current at the
course's edge put the peaking Cardi
nal at the back of the pack, behind
crews they had previously bested by
as much as 30 seconds. The Stanford
lightweights finished sixth in the Pe
tites and twelfth overall, while top
ranked Wisconsin won the event.
"All this aside, we felt like we
went to the national championships,
had our best race, and controlled the
things we can control." Coach A 1
Acosta said. "The unfavorable lane
draw and the head current were
clearly out of our control, and some
times in an outdoor sport these
things work against you."
