## 750 Pub to stay open for World Cup 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An online petition collected nearly 7(H) signatures in
just two days last week, convincing the Seven Fifty Pub's
manager to host all f>4 matches of this summer's FIFA
World Cup at the Graduate Student Center.
Pub manager Giuseppe Carrubba said he was origi
nally hesitant to host the games because their early start
times would make it difficult to operate the pub during
the broadcasts.
"We used to be open for breakfast and lunch, and we
never got any business," Carruba said. " We're typically
closed during the day, and we need at least three people
on staff to keep the business open. We weren't even sure
if there was a demand among students to watch the
games here in the first place."
Petition founder Yosem Companys, a PhD student,
first approached Carruba several weeks ago and was told
that the pub would air the games only if there v\ere a sig
nificant enough demand. Companys describes the peti
tion as a "spur of the moment" effort to convince Carru
ba of the students' willingness to frequent the pub for

each game.
Between I"hursday and Friday of last week, the peti
tion was signed by almost 7(H) Stanford-affiliated individ
uals, including graduate and undergraduate students,
staff, faculty and alumni.The actual petition said that the
only then-existing options for watching the Cup would be
at the Bechtel International Center or at an off-campus
location.
Carruba said he was very surprised and pleased to see
such a large demand.
"I was ecstatic," he said. "This place isn't about the
money. It's all about people getting together and having
a good time. I always hope for this place to be more so
cial, and this could be a good way to kick-start it."
Pub co-owner Maurice Corruba said he always had
the intent of hosting the World Cup games.
Companys said he expects a large turnout for each
match.
The Seven Fifty Pub will broadcast each Cup game,
beginning this Friday with Germany vs. Costa Rica at 9
a.m. Food and drink specials are planned to be offered,
including continental breakfast and coffee served during
the morning games.
