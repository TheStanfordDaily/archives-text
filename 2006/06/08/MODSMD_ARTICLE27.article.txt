## Track finals this weekend 21 athletes head to Sacramento for Outdoor Championships 
### ISRAEL ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every student wishes she had more time
to study for finals. But for 21 students this
year, studying will take a backseat to running,
jumping and throwing at this year's NCAA
Outdoor Division I Track and Field Champi
onships.
Ten men and 11 women have travelled to
Sacramento, Calif, for the event, which runs
through June 10. Last year the Cardinal
women finished fifth at NCAAs while the
Stanford men placed seventh.
The men will have a tough time improving
on their success, having lost key athletes to
graduation. Last year the men had two na
tional champions, seniors Ryan Hall and
Michael Robertson, in the S,(KM) meters and
discus, respectively.
Robertson is red-shirting this season, but
Hall graduated, along with lan Dobson, who
was a 2005 runner-up in the S(XK) meters. All
told, Stanford has just two athletes who rank
in the top-five in their event this year — and
just three in the top 10.
It looks a little better on the women's side.
The team will be hurt by the graduation of
Sara Bei. now Sara Hall after marriage, who
took second in the 5,000 meters last year.The
team has good distance depth but is disap
pointed with the loss of junior phenom Ari
anna Lambie,who injured her foot running at
the Pac-10 Championship meet.
"It was a quick change of plans that I can't
deny is tremendously disappointing," Lam
bie said. "Now I'm wishing the best for my
teammates as they prepare for NCAAs. I'll
be ready to go for cross country next fall."
Last season, Arkansas took the men's
team title and Texas claimed the women's
crown. This year, Texas is expected to repeat
on the women's side, but Florida State is the
heavy favorite to take home the men's title.
The Cardinal's greatest hopes for suc
cess lie with senior Sarah Hopping and
sophomores Neftalem Araia, Graeme
Hoste and Erica McLain. each of whom
rank in the top-five in their event. Hopping
goes into the meet with some momentum
after having broken her own school record
several times over during the last few weeks
of competition.

Junior Arianna Lambie will not be competing at this weekend's
Outdoor Championships after injuring her foot. Lambie will have
to wait until 2007 to get a crack at a championship.
