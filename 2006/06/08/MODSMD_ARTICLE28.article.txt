## Alum Booker elected mayor of Newark, N.J. 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
A former class president may be well on his
way to becoming president of the United States.
That's what many have said about Stanford grad
uate Cory Booker, the recently-elected mayor of
Newark. N.J.
Booker made headlines when,on May 8, he was
elected Newark's mayor with 72 percent of the
vote. It was Newark's first contested election since
1986 — former mayor Sharpe James has run un
opposed in the four elections since.
Terry Moe, professor of political science and
Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, recalled
Booker as one of his most successful students.
"He was a very sharp guy who participated ac
tively and was a great student." Moe said. "All
around, very impressive."
While at Stanford, Booker was much more than
an outstanding student who was acknowledged for
numerous awards at graduation. He was an All-
American tight end on the football team, as well as
a live-in, overnight counselor at The Bridge.
While Booker grew up in an affluent suburb in
New Jersey, Associate Professor of art, art history
and classics Jody Maxmin noted that this only en
couraged Booker's growing passion to improve
society.
"He talked about the disparity between the
rich and poor, as well as the problems of the inner
city," Maxmin said. "He had this great burden of
wanting to give back — and every step up the lad
der of his career, I think his purpose intensified."
Booker received a bachelor's degree in politi
cal science with honors in 1991 and a master's de
gree in sociology the following year. He then went
to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and received an
honors degree in modern history in 1994. He en
tered Yale Law School and received his law de

gree in 1997. Booker has also sought to maintain
his Stanford ties, serving on the University Board
of Trustees as a residing member.
After leaving school, Booker launched a career
in public service in his home state of New Jersey. In
1998 he served as a staff attorney for the Urban Jus
tice Center and as a program coordinator of the
Newark Youth Project. He was elected to the
Newark City Council where he earned a reputation
for being a strong leader with innovative ideas.
"He was so good at leading his peers and great
at breathing confidence into others," Maxmin said.
"He was destined to be a leader."
In 1998, Booker moved into Brick Towers, a no
torious public housing project in Newark, in order
to understand the tenants better and to help them
demand better living conditions. In 2000, Booker
lived in a motor home parked near locations
where drug trafficking was known to occur.
"He's done these amazing things to put himself
in the midst of troubled populations in an effort to
understand and lead them," Moe said.

In addition to his political accomplishments,
Booker is also a partner in a Newark law firm and
founded a nonprofit organization aimed at im
proving and empowering neighborhoods in
Newark.
For his extensive work in the public interest,
Booker has been recognized on a national level by
a number of publications, including Time Maga
zine, Esquire and The U.S. News and World Re
port.
"People have been comparing him to Barak
Obama," Maxmin said. "He too is a young, idealis
tic politician of color that has the ability to bring
the nation together. The future may very well rest
in the hands of people like Obama and Booker."
While Booker has an ambitious agenda for the
city of Newark, many familiar with Booker and his
accomplishments anticipate that he will continue
his impressive rise.
"He's had a remarkable career so far," Moe
said. "It won't be long before he runs for higher
office."
