## Group takes precautions in case of flu outbreak University prepares for highly unlikely avian flu pandemic 
### JULIE KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While international reports on
avian flu rate the possibility of a
pandemic as highly unlikely at
best, the University is taking pre
ventative measures if such an inci
dent were to occur. Stanford plans
to cancel all classes and evacuate
the campus in the event of an out
break.
Preparations are being led by an
emergency planning group, which
has been working on an avian flu
pandemic plan since last October.
The group is composed of officials
from various University depart
ments, including Vaden Health
Center. Environmental Health and
Safety, Public Safety, the Provost's
Office. Student Affairs and Human
Resources. Stanford Hospital and
Santa Clara County Public Health
officials also attend the group's
meetings, which take place every
two weeks.
The group is led by Larry Gibbs,
associate vice provost for Environ
mental Health and Safety, and Dr.
Ira Friedman, a health services ad
ministrator. Gibbs, who oversees
the Emergency Management pro
gram at Stanford, is in charge of all
campus emergencies, including
epidemics. While he says that the
most likely campus emergency is
an earthquake, Gibbs is also in
charge of preparing for fires, natu
ral disasters and infectious disease
outbreaks like avian flu.
Many group members original
ly convened in 2(X)3 under the
threat of a SARS outbreak; infec
tious disease planning has been
taking place at Stanford ever since.
"Emergency planning is an on
going process," Gibbs said. "It is
never-ending. We have been taking
steps at a time."
Sasha Madison, manager of the
infection control department at

Stanford Hospital, said the group is
constantly thinking ahead.
"There is always more planning
involved," Madison said. "We will
continue to plan as we get addition
al information."
The group's main sources for
this information are the World
Health Organization (WHO), the
Center for Disease Control
(CDC), the California State Health
Department and the Santa Clara
County Public Health Depart
ment.
This summer, nine smaller and
more specialized groups will work
on different aspects of the pan
demic plan. The plan's goal is to
identify how a pandemic would af
fect Stanford and how these im
pacts can be dealt with â€” or pre
vented.
"We hope to have the plan final
ized by late September," Gibbs
said.
While exact plans have not yet
been established, the group is nar
rowing the course of action it will
take.
"When we think through how
to best protect our students, we as
sume that it is possible to reduce
the number of influenza infections
by spreading our students out, so
called 'social distancing,"' Fried
man said. "That is because in closer
living and working situations, a
higher percent of individuals will
become infected."
The group is currently debating
the appropriate time to evacuate
students.
While the emergency planners
hope to conclude their efforts
soon, it is thankfully unlikely that
their plans will be needed. The few
cases of avian flu are isolated and
currently limited to Asia, but WHO
is advising all countries to monitor
the situation closely.
"Of course, we do not know if
the current influenza strain will
become a pandemic or not,"
Friedman said. "But we are taking
that possibility seriously; it is
much better to plan in advance
and be prepared. We are con
cerned, concerned enough to
begin to prepare."
