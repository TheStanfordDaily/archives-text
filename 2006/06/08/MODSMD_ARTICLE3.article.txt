# GSB to increase courses
## Evaluation points to need for more diverse, less rigid curriculum 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Beginning in fall 2007, MBA students at the Graduate
School of Business will see a marked increase in the num
ber of course offerings. Better yet, students will have much
more discretion over the combination of courses they
choose, allowing for tailor-made academic experiences.
Such flexibility is unprecedented in the nation's business
schools and departs from the educational model that the
GSB currently uses. It comes at the forefront of an overhaul
to the MBA program that was announced June 6 and will
take effect when the class of 2(X)9 arrives on the Farm.
Other changes to the program include assigning faculty
advisors to students and requiring first-year students to par
ticipate in an international exchange experience. The GSB
faculty approved the modifications "by an overwhelming
consensus vote " according to GSB Dean Robert Joss.
No specific problem prompted the overhaul, said GSB
Prof. Garth Saloner. Rather, it is normal for faculty mem

bers to evaluate the curriculum at the GSB every five to 10
years. 2(X)6 happened to be one of those years, and Saloner
chaired the effort. Over four months, he and 10 colleagues
sought feedback about the MBA program from more than
200 GSB students and alumni.
Saloner said that the interviewees expressed three main
concerns: the MBA curriculum is not designed to support
the diversity of students' educational and employment
backgrounds; rigid core requirements do not help all stu
dents learn effectively; and many GSB graduates feel un
prepared for the global business world. The changes to the
MBA program seek to resolve these issues.
The effort to facilitate individualized curricula will be
the most radical of the changes, according to Saloner. Most
MBA programs have strict course requirements on busi
ness basics for first-year students, while the second year is
comprised mainly of electives, he said. Under the new sys
tem at the GSB. this will no longer be the case. There will

still be requirements, but they will not
be as stiff.
"First-year students will start with
a fall quarter [of classes rich in mana
gerial context] that everyone has to
take together," Saloner said.
One of these courses will be titled
"Critical Analytical Thinking" and
will address issues such as corpora
tions' social responsibilities, accord
ing to GSB Prof. David Kreps.
In the second and third quarters,
students must take courses in specific
topic areas, but the GSB will "provide
a menu of courses in each area that
students will be able to choose from,"
Saloner explained. "One of the class
es in every area will be base-level, and
there will also be high-end courses."
This way, students who already
have strong business backgrounds
when they start the MBA program
can challenge themselves appropri
ately, while students with less experi
ence are not overwhelmed.
To help the students evaluate their
progress and navigate their options, the
GSB will assign each MBA student to fac
ulty advisor. This* too. Is atypical of most
MBA programs, according to Kreps

"MBA programs tend to be pretty
uniform in their first year, and students
are assumed to learn over the first year
what there is on offer for the second
Kreps said. "The new program will be
much more tailored to individual stu
dents, substantially increasing the need
for academic advice from the start."
Finally, first-year students will have
to participate in some kind of interna
tional exchange trip. This will "give stu
dents an educational experience that in
creases their ability to function in a truly
global economy," Kreps explained.
The international exchange can be
as short as a week, and some students
already organize 10-day trips abroad
to study between quarters, according
to Saloner. So the framework is in
place — the difference is that stu
dents will be required to go. They can
also participate in a two-week ex
change program, such as one that the
GSB has arranged with Tsinghua
University in China.
While much of the MBA program
overhaul pertains to first-year students,
it does not stop there. Second-year stu
dents will have to take a number of
week-long elective courses that com
bine lectures, discussions and panels to
delve into topics such as women and
entrepreneurship, Saloner said.
Second-year students will also have to
participate in a "Synthesis Seminar" that
"has students both sum up what they got

from the MBA program—intellectually
and personally — and to think thmugh
how what they did here will play forward
into the next stage of their lives,' 1 Kreps said
Enacting the new program will ne
cessitate hiring five to 10 percent
more faculty members, according to
Saloner. The GSB will also ask the
University for a new building with
more classrooms that can accommo
date small seminars. Saloner also said
he hopes the building will have an au
ditorium that can seat the entire first
year class for special events.The Uni
versity's Board of Trustees will review
the request in June, but whether or
not the board approves it, the GSB
will go through with the MBA pro
gram changes, Saloner said.
That the new program will come
to fruition pleases not only faculty
members, but also current GSB stu
dents— even though they won't be
here to capitalize on the perks.
"1 sort of wish 1 could start all over
again to take advantage of this new
program," said Katherine Boas, a first
year MBA student. "It's been thought
out well and takes into consideration
the needs and desires of the students,
as well as the needs of the market."
Boas continued,"The kind, quality
and caliber of person that comes to
the GSB won't change,but once those
people are here, they'll have a much
richer experience."

ing to GSB Prof. David Kreps.
In the second and third quarters,
students must take courses in specific
topic areas, but the GSB will "provide
a menu of courses in each area that
students will be able to choose from,"
Saloner explained. "One of the class
es in every area will be base-level, and
there will also be high-end courses."
This way, students who already
have strong business backgrounds
when they start the MBA program
can challenge themselves appropri
ately, while students with less experi
ence are not overwhelmed.
To help the students evaluate their
progress and navigate their options, the
GSB will assign each MBA student to fac
ulty advisor. This* too. Is atypical of most
MBA programs, according to Kreps

"MBA programs tend to be pretty
uniform in their first year, and students
are assumed to learn over the first year
what there is on offer for the second
Kreps said. "The new program will be
much more tailored to individual stu
dents, substantially increasing the need
for academic advice from the start."
Finally, first-year students will have
to participate in some kind of interna
tional exchange trip. This will "give stu
dents an educational experience that in
creases their ability to function in a truly
global economy," Kreps explained.
The international exchange can be
as short as a week, and some students
already organize 10-day trips abroad
to study between quarters, according
to Saloner. So the framework is in
place — the difference is that stu
dents will be required to go. They can
also participate in a two-week ex
change program, such as one that the
GSB has arranged with Tsinghua
University in China.
While much of the MBA program
overhaul pertains to first-year students,
it does not stop there. Second-year stu
dents will have to take a number of
week-long elective courses that com
bine lectures, discussions and panels to
delve into topics such as women and
entrepreneurship, Saloner said.
Second-year students will also have to
participate in a "Synthesis Seminar" that
"has students both sum up what they got

from the MBA program—intellectually
and personally — and to think thmugh
how what they did here will play forward
into the next stage of their lives,' 1 Kreps said
Enacting the new program will ne
cessitate hiring five to 10 percent
more faculty members, according to
Saloner. The GSB will also ask the
University for a new building with
more classrooms that can accommo
date small seminars. Saloner also said
he hopes the building will have an au
ditorium that can seat the entire first
year class for special events.The Uni
versity's Board of Trustees will review
the request in June, but whether or
not the board approves it, the GSB
will go through with the MBA pro
gram changes, Saloner said.
That the new program will come
to fruition pleases not only faculty
members, but also current GSB stu
dents— even though they won't be
here to capitalize on the perks.
"1 sort of wish 1 could start all over
again to take advantage of this new
program," said Katherine Boas, a first
year MBA student. "It's been thought
out well and takes into consideration
the needs and desires of the students,
as well as the needs of the market."
Boas continued,"The kind, quality
and caliber of person that comes to
the GSB won't change,but once those
people are here, they'll have a much
richer experience."
