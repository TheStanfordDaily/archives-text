# GSB to increase courses
## Evaluation points to need for more diverse, less rigid curriculum 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Beginning in fall 2007, MBA students at the Graduate
School of Business will see a marked increase in the num
ber of course offerings. Better yet, students will have much
more discretion over the combination of courses they
choose, allowing for tailor-made academic experiences.
Such flexibility is unprecedented in the nation's business
schools and departs from the educational model that the
GSB currently uses. It comes at the forefront of an overhaul
to the MBA program that was announced June 6 and will
take effect when the class of 2(X)9 arrives on the Farm.
Other changes to the program include assigning faculty
advisors to students and requiring first-year students to par
ticipate in an international exchange experience. The GSB
faculty approved the modifications "by an overwhelming
consensus vote " according to GSB Dean Robert Joss.
No specific problem prompted the overhaul, said GSB
Prof. Garth Saloner. Rather, it is normal for faculty mem

bers to evaluate the curriculum at the GSB every five to 10
years. 2(X)6 happened to be one of those years, and Saloner
chaired the effort. Over four months, he and 10 colleagues
sought feedback about the MBA program from more than
200 GSB students and alumni.
Saloner said that the interviewees expressed three main
concerns: the MBA curriculum is not designed to support
the diversity of students' educational and employment
backgrounds; rigid core requirements do not help all stu
dents learn effectively; and many GSB graduates feel un
prepared for the global business world. The changes to the
MBA program seek to resolve these issues.
The effort to facilitate individualized curricula will be
the most radical of the changes, according to Saloner. Most
MBA programs have strict course requirements on busi
ness basics for first-year students, while the second year is
comprised mainly of electives, he said. Under the new sys
tem at the GSB. this will no longer be the case. There will
