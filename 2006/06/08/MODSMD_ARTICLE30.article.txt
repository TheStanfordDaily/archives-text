## Commercial piracy replaced by Internet 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
In news that will likely disappoint litigation attorneys, new re
search suggests that it may be unwise for producers of digital
goods to sue file-sharing Internet networks and individuals who
trade copyrighted music, movies and software. A recent study by
Tunay Tunca, assistant professor of operations, information and
technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and
fifth-year doctoral candidate OiongWu, found that increased In
ternet piracy by individuals has reduced demand for commer
cially pirated products, like illegal copies of CDs and DVDs sold
on the black market.
Tunca and Wu argue that in the presence of Internet pira
cy, by strategic pricing, legal publishers can efficiently sup
press commercial piracy activity and acquire a larger market
segment and profit. This is because the damage done by
technologically-savvy individual pirates can be less than
commercial ones.
In recent years, with the emergence and growth of illegal file
sharing on the Internet, individual piracy of digital goods has
stirred substantial controversy, according to Wu.
"Threatened by this growth, the information goods indus
try took legal action by suing the file-sharing networks and the
consumers who illegally share copyrighted material on these
networks," Qiong said. "In our paper. Professor Tunca and 1
demonstrate that each one of these two actions aimed to fight
individual piracy can backfire by providing strategic disadvan
tage to legal publishers of information goods. In particular, we
show that in the presence of commercial piracy, a higher pop
ulation of consumers who are capable of individual piracy can
increase a legal publisher's profits and a higher detection and
prosecution rate for individual piracy can reduce a legal pub
lisher's profits."
Qiong emphasized that an analysis of digital piracy from an
economic perspective demonstrates that "over-restricting indi
vidual piracy can in fact reduce a legal publisher's profits by forc
ing her not to fully take advantage of potential strategic oppor
tunities.
"Globally, the greater enemy is third-party commercial pi
rates who vend illegal copies of CDs and DVDs filled with music,
movies and software," Qiong said."Legal digital goods producers
can benefit from strategically using the presence of individual file
sharers to reduce the damage from commercial pirates."
Qiong noted that Stanford students should not assume that
the findings of the study in any way endorse illegal file sharing of
copyright materials by individuals.
"Our research shows that tolerating individual piracy to some
extent in certain cases can make it easier to fight with commer
cial piracy and may benefit legal publishers." Qiong said. "How
ever. file sharing copyrighted materials is not justified among in
formation goods users in any market."
Qiong's future line of research will continue to probe the eco
nomic issues of digital goods piracy, but will focus specifically on
emerging markets.
