## Institute awards Biology Dept. $1.5 mil over four years 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford undergraduates pursuing studies in biol
ogy should thank the Howard Hughes Medical Insti
tute (HHMI). which has recently awarded the Uni
versity with a four-year grant, totaling $ 1.5 million, to
support undergraduate education in biology.
Prof, of Biological Sciences Craig Heller, who initiated
and sustained Stanford's involvement with HHMI. said
that the funding is "instrumental in a huge growth in the
involvement of undergraduates in research at Stanford."
On campus, the HHMI award supports competi
tive grants for undergraduate summer research as
well as laboratory equipment and student online in
teractive materials. According to Heller, the money
is also used to fund outreach programs, scientific
meetings and publications such as The Stanford Bi
ologist and Stanford Scientific.
According to the HHMI Web site, 214 research
universities were invited to apply for the awards. Of

the 158 applications received, 50 were selected to re
ceive between $1.5 million and $2.2 million in fund
ing. The total amount of funding doled out for the 50
grants was $86.4 million.
Stanford has received numerous benefits from
the HHMI grant since the program began in 1989.
Robert Simoni, chair of the of the Biological Sci
ences department, called the HHMI award "hugely
valuable," since it is the only grant the department
receives for undergraduate education.
He also highlighted the importance of the grant
money to the department's honors program, because
all honors candidates are required to do research.
"This year in biology. 65 of our students will graduate
with departmental honors." Simoni said. "This is approach
ing 50 percent of our students, so it's really quite successful."
The HHMI program has provided money for
about 50 undergraduate summer research grants
every year, according to Heller.
Simoni added that the research fellowships sup
port students "not just in biology but Human Biolo

gy, bioengineering and sometimes chemistry. [The
money] is broadly used for biology research, but not
just in the Biology Department."
Heller also discussed how the HHMI grant has
motivated the VPUE to make money available for
freshman and sophomore research experiences.
"That's not independent research — it's not a
competitive grants process — but what it does is it
helps prepare students and make them more aware
of what the opportunities are," he said.
Junior John Shen has participated in research in a
cancer biology lab since his freshman year. He says
that while the research experience itself is much
more valuable than the money he receives from
URP, the grant makes it easier for him to be able to
do research at Stanford over the summer.
Heller expressed hope that undergraduate stu
dents would be more aware of the HHMI grant.
"I think students should really appreciate and be
grateful for the Howard Hughes Foundation for
making [their research] possible," he said.
