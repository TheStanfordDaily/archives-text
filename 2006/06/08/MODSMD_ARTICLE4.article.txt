# CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
## Barber reflects on 50 years 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Newell Whitford has been a barber at Stanford
Hair for as long as anyone can remember.The ami
able, silver-haired gentleman will be 75 in January
and has seen the shop through many changes in lo
cation and hairstyles since he began cutting hair
there in 1951.
Growing up, Whitford cleaned the shop in the
evenings, and later attended barber school. When
he began work in 1951, the business was owned by
his uncles and had two locations: one in the old
Student Union and another across campus in

then-freshman residence Encina Hall. He served
in the Korean War shortly after starting to cut hair,
but returned to Stanford in 1953.
Whitford's business partner, Carmelo Coglian
dro, is another longtime Stanford personality. He
began to work at the Encina Hall location in 1961
and became a full partner with Whitford in 1975.
Both barbers said that working at Stanford pro
vided a unique experience.
"The difference is in (he clientele — students,
faculty and staff, the diversity," Cogliandro said.
"Honestly, it's a higher level; Stanford is unique.
You're dealing with the best of the best all the time."
Whitford added that one of his favorite aspects

of cutting hair at the University is working with
multiple generations of Stanford affiliates. He
cites Dennis Bark, now a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institute, whose hair he has been cutting
since 1951. when Bark was nine years old.
"I cut his father's hair, and Dennis and his broth
er's hair and his brother-in-law's hair for a long
time," Whitford reminisced.
"He knows everybody and his brother." Bark
said of Whitford. "He's a heck of a good barber
and a heck of a good guy. and that's a nice combi
nation."

Stanford Hair barber Newell Whitford gives co-worker Howard Conrad a quick trim. Whitford began cutting hair in 1951 and has seen the family business
through several different moves. Some customers, like Hoover Fellow Dennis Bark, have been coming to him for more than 50 years.
The shop has experienced its ups and
downs over the years through changes in
hairstyles, demographics and rentable
space around campus.
In the late 19605, Whitford said, "the
long hair came in" — with disastrous re
sults for the campus barbershop. The
business, previously consisting of ten em
ployees to service the clean-cut, short
haired looks of the 1950s and early 19605,
was reduced to just Whitford and
Cogliandro.
"It was worrisome." Whitford said.
"We didn't know what was going to hap
pen."
Fortunately for them, hairstyles even
tually reverted back to the shorter looks
of previous decades.
"It's like a pendulum," Cogliandro ob
served. "We go from long to short and
short to long, and in between."
Stanford Hair has diversified from its
origins as a barber shop in the 19205. Both
business owners note that today, it has be
come a "full service shop" employing four
workers year-round.
"We're a salon now," Whitford said.
'Hie nature of the shop is not the only
thing that has changed over the years.
Stanford 1 lair has had to deal with sever

al relocations during its long history'. The
Encina Hall location was moved to that
building's basement, then closed alto
gether. In l%2.the Old Student Union lo
cation was relocated to Tresidder Memo
rial Union, where it occupied the space
now held by Jamba Juice. When the
smoothie company moved in eight years
ago. the University relocated Stanford
Hair to its current, less visible location
across from Tresidder Fitness.
"You can't see him anymore, which is
too bad," Bark noted.
The loss of foot traffic incurred by the
most recent move has hurt business, Stan
ford Hair's proprietors say, but the shop
has been able to adjust to its new location.
"It worked out fine," Cogliandro said.
The shop continues to draw on a loyal
customer base, some of which comes from
outside the University.
"I come in here and it's quick, good
service, good haircut and I'm on my way,"
said Randy Raphael, a construction con
tractor who works throughout the penin
sula. "Plus, my dad probably dragged me
in here when I was a kid."
With the shop's patron loyalty, friend
ly staff and important service it provides,
the owners are confident that even after
they retire — which neither plans on
doing anytime soon — Stanford Hair will
remain a presence on campus.
"It'll always be here,"Cogliandro said.
"It's been here since the twenties, and it
will continue on."
