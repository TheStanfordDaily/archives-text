## Barber reflects on 50 years 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Newell Whitford has been a barber at Stanford
Hair for as long as anyone can remember.The ami
able, silver-haired gentleman will be 75 in January
and has seen the shop through many changes in lo
cation and hairstyles since he began cutting hair
there in 1951.
Growing up, Whitford cleaned the shop in the
evenings, and later attended barber school. When
he began work in 1951, the business was owned by
his uncles and had two locations: one in the old
Student Union and another across campus in

then-freshman residence Encina Hall. He served
in the Korean War shortly after starting to cut hair,
but returned to Stanford in 1953.
Whitford's business partner, Carmelo Coglian
dro, is another longtime Stanford personality. He
began to work at the Encina Hall location in 1961
and became a full partner with Whitford in 1975.
Both barbers said that working at Stanford pro
vided a unique experience.
"The difference is in (he clientele â€” students,
faculty and staff, the diversity," Cogliandro said.
"Honestly, it's a higher level; Stanford is unique.
You're dealing with the best of the best all the time."
Whitford added that one of his favorite aspects

of cutting hair at the University is working with
multiple generations of Stanford affiliates. He
cites Dennis Bark, now a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institute, whose hair he has been cutting
since 1951. when Bark was nine years old.
"I cut his father's hair, and Dennis and his broth
er's hair and his brother-in-law's hair for a long
time," Whitford reminisced.
"He knows everybody and his brother." Bark
said of Whitford. "He's a heck of a good barber
and a heck of a good guy. and that's a nice combi
nation."
