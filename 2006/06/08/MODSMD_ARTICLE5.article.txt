## Grad pub will show all World Cup matches Popular petition prompts The 750 to broadcast all 64 games live 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An online petition circulating for two days and signed by
661 graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral fel
lows, staff. faculty and alumni has persuaded Giusseppe Car
rubba. Co-owner of The 750 campus pub, to broadcast all 64
games of the 2(X)6 World Cup live, including games begin
ning at 6 a.m.
The only on-campus pub will offer special breakfast and
lunch menus for earlier games. It has also obtained a spon
sorship from Budweiser to offer promotions and discounts
on beer for the matches.
Even as the World Cup coincides with finals and the be
ginning of summer break, Carrubba is convinced that stu
dents will come to the pub to watch, especially graduate stu
dents who don't have as many finals and often stay on cam
pus for the summer.
"I would be surprised if there were less than 1 (K) people
here for the major games," Carrubba said.
The petition was organized by the World Cup at Stanford
Planning Committee (WCSPC), essentially a makeshift
group of students that came together to establish a central
game-viewing location on campus.
Organizers first considered Bechtel International Cen
ter, but decided it was too small and fans would have to bring
their own food and drinks. Going off campus would be a has
sle as well. The 750 owners initially expressed skepticism at
the demand for viewing the games, but were soon convinced
by the surprising number of student signatures on the peti
tion.
"You can't say no to that many people," Carrubba said.
"Hopefully, people will come and have a donut and coffee
and help us cover our costs."
The petition was only open to Stanford community mem
bers. And according to Yosem E. Companys, a fifth-year
doctoral student in management science and engineering
and a leader of the WCSPC. 90 percent of the signatures
came from students. Additionally, 167 people have joined a
Facebook.com group for 2006 World Cup fans.
