### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, Hillel at Stanford
held the groundbreaking ceremo
ny for the new Koret Pavilion —
"Phase Two" of the Harold and
Libby Ziff Center for Jewish Life.
The 9,500-square-foot facility.

opening in fall 2007, will provide
students with more programming
space and will include a wireless
cafe, dining hall and prayer room
for Hillel's weekly services.
At the groundbreaking celebra
tion. the featured attendees includ
ed Dr. Ruth Westheimer. sexolo
gist and honorary chair of Hillel's
"Love Is Real" campaign, and
guest speaker Arnold Eisen, pro
fessor of religion at Stanford and
chancellor-elect of the Jewish The
ological Seminary.
According to Adina Danzig, executive director of
Hillel at Stanford, the completed Koret Pavilion will
help bring the 13,000-sq.-ft. Ziff Center up to par with
Hillel facilities at peer institutions. The lead gift for the
center was provided by Stanford alum Lela Sarnat,
daughter of Libby Ziff and the late Harold Ziff, and her
husband Gerry Sarnat. Other benefactors include the
Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture and the
Koret Foundation.
"Phase One" of the Ziff Center was the renovation
of a historic home on Mayfield Avenue into the Taube
Hillel House, which opened about a year and a half ago.
This phase cost $4.8 million, and the fundraising for the
$6.5 million second phase of the campaign is 90 percent
complete. After completing Phase Two fundraising,
Hillel will pursue a $2 million endowment to support
programming,
"I remember our first Friday night dinner in the
Taube Hillel House last year — which was lovely, but
overflowing with about 100 people inside and outside
— students were excited to finally have a Jewish stu
dent center, but were already feeling crowded and
clamoring for additional space," Danzig said. "With
the limited space we have, there is little space that is
always available for students to come to Hillel to just
hang out. The additional space in the Koret Pavilion
will ensure that there will be space for students to
come to Hillel just to be with friends, study or get a
cup of coffee."
Danzig noted that both the Taube Hillel House and
the Koret Pavilion will be open to all Stanford students
to reserve and use for programming.
"We are thrilled that, with the completion of the
Koret Pavilion, the Ziff Center will have enough space
for the Jewish campus community's programs, and that
these spaces will be available to all students at Stanford,"
Danzig said. "As we all know, there is an ongoing short
age of program space on campus, and we're happy to
help alleviate this problem."
Jewish Leadership Council (JLC) Vice President An
drew Ehrich. a freshman, believes that the Koret Pavil
ion and the social, educational and cultural activities it
will house are essential for the Jewish community if it
hopes to reach out to more students on campus.
"In order for Jewish life on campus to grow. Hillel and
the Jewish Students Association (JSA) need a large
place to hold programs, host speakers and generally
house a type of Jewish life that is not based solely on re
ligious life." Ehrich said. "The Jewish community is con
fident that it can use the Koret Pavilion to make valuable
contributions to the Stanford community. My hope is
that all Stanford students will take advantage of the new
space, which will help foster relationships between many
multicultural groups."
Like Ehrich. JLC Chief Financial Officer and fresh
man Rebecca Tisdale views the Koret Pavilion as an op
portunity to expand JSA's presence on campus.
"The new building will allow Hillel and the Jewish
Student Association to greatly expand their cultural and
religious programming to hopefully attract a larger and
more diverse group of students," Tisdale said.
JLC Shabbat and Holiday Chair Rachel Friedman, a

sophomore, expressed excitement that Passover seders
and other events will now have a home.
"The Ziff Center has already been a great addition to
the Jewish Community on campus, so the Koret Pavilion
will only be adding to this," she said.
