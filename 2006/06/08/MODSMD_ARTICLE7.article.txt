# Editor's Note: Med School story misleading
## 
### 
Dear Readers
On May 25, The Daily ran an
article titled "Med School faculty
claim systematic discrimination."
Since its publication, the story has
drawn fire from administrators
and faculty members. As those re
sponsible for the article, we are
taking this opportunity to clarify
the issues it raised and to apolo
gize for any misleading informa
tion it contained. We do this first
and foremost for the benefit of

our readers, and secondly, to give
the University credit where cred
it is due.
When a newspaper runs such a
high-profile story, it has the re
sponsibility to carry the burden of
proof. We were not able to pres
ent enough solid evidence to jus
tify several of the stated allega
tions. While The Daily was shown
documents sufficiently demon
strating discrimination and unfair
hiring practices in a few isolated
cases, this evidence is not necessarily
enough to indicate a "systematic"
problem.
More importantly, we saw no
documented material backing up
anonymous sources' suspicions that
Stanford ties within the Bush ad
ministration prompted the U.S. De
partment of Labor to halt its dis
crimination investigation. The Uni
versity has categorically denied this
claim. In retrospect, we exercised
poor news judgment in including
this detail.
In addition, the number of docu
ments showing that certain job open
ings are filled before they are adver
tised is too limited to support any
broad claim. Our sources were con
strained due to fear of being identi
fied, but we should have required
them to present more specific evi

dence or refer us to others willing to
speak on the record.
Finally, we apologize for leaning
so heavily on unnamed sources to an
extent that prevented the University
from starting a constructive dia
logue with its accusers. In the future.
The Daily should approach similar
situations differently, making sure
that information provided by
anonymous sources can be verified
through other channels, and is not a
matter of opinion.
Past lawsuits against the Univer
sity alleging discrimination — sever
al of which have been settled out of
court, blocking plaintiffs from
speaking to the press — are well
covered in the media. The Depart
ment of Labor's investigation is cur
rently underway, and it has yet to
rule whether discrimination has oc
curred or not. Still, our handful of
testimonies from former and present
Medical School faculty members in
no way proves that these problems
are ongoing.
In fact, we have since spoken to
other Medical School sources who

say strong efforts are being made by
the school's leadership to improve
diversity and combat discrimina
tion. Chief among these efforts is the
creation of the Office of Diversity
and Leadership within the school
and the appointment of Hannah
Valantine to oversee it as the senior
associate dean.
Despite our errors in judgment,
the article was based on experi
ences related to us by high-ranking
members of the Medical School fac
ulty. Perhaps our readers would
have been better served by an arti
cle examining the merits of these
few complaints. Regardless, this ex
perience has offered many valuable
lessons, and we hope to continue
holding both The Daily and the
University to a high standard.
Sincerely.
