## Graduation, Stanford Single Style 
### 
Dear Readers,
It is with a heavy heart that 1 inform you that this is
my last original Stanford Single Daily column. I 'm plan
ning on keeping up the column and/or blog in some
form after 1 graduate. Be sure to check out www.stan
fordsingle.com for updates as well as information about
an awesome singles beach party hosted by The Stan
ford Club of Palo Alto and Stanford Singles Sensations
this summer.The event is open to Stanford alumni, fac
ulty and staff and sounds like it should be pretty rockin'.
And now, "Graduation, Stanford Single Style":
Do not call it "Commencement," because you will
sound pretentious. Do not call it something cutesy like
"Gradu-macation," because you will sound either men
tally challenged or drunk. Do not call it anything other
than what it is — and that is Graduation, also known as
the end of your career as a single college student. You
are now a single young professional, and single young
professionals know exactly what to say all the time. Sin
gle young professionals are on top of their game. And
they do not say words like "gradu-macation" unless
they want other single young professionals to punch
them in the face. Hard.
The graduation ceremony is a great time to sit quiet
ly with your classmates and reflect on your four years at
this university. It is not a good time to seduce the peo
ple sitting around you. No woman wants to hear "Nice
legs. What time do they open?" coming from a guy in a
robe and a funny hat. No woman wants to hear that
from anyone, ever. They only thing anyone wants to
hear at this ceremony is their name so they can rush the
stage, grab their diploma and shout SCREW YOU, DE
PARTMENT OF ECONOMICS, FOR TAKING
THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE without fear of
repercussion. After they return to their seat they will re
alize that they have been given a folder with a notice
saying that students must pick up their diplomas after
the ceremony at the registrar's office. And then they
will really not want to be hit on by a guy in a robe and a
funny hat. ......
Graduation is the beginning of a new chapter of
your life. This chapter will not — unless you are an ex
traordinarily desperate graduate student — include
keggers or panty raids;you are trading them in for cock
tail parties and black tie dinners. You will need to know
the difference between business casual and semi-for
mal. You will buy wine that does not come in a box. You
will realize that in the real world, people actually do
things like date and meet each other's parents and
sometimes they even get married.
But you do not need to worry about this right now.
You have other things to think about, like whether or
not that consulting gig you signed up for in October is
really what you want to do with the next five years of
your life. Sure, the pay is good and your parents are
happy, but are you happy? Or are you, like everyone
else, afraid, excited and feeling more than a
little...alone?
This is what it means to be single: to be alone, to be
free, to be open to all the exhilarating and terrifying
possibilities that might lie in the future; to be regarded
as separate from a group, to be something that is com
pletely and entirely one's own. Sometimes it is fabulous.
Sometimes it is scary. But mostly it is just okay, which is
good because you quickly learn that even if you never
find that storybook soul mate with whom to share your
fears and dreams, you will be okay too.
Just don't call it "Commencement." Call it "Gradu
ation." Acknowledge that you look like a doofus in your
robe and funny hat and savor every moment, because
you are now a single young professional and that is
what single young professionals do.

Marie would like to thank all of her readers for their sup
