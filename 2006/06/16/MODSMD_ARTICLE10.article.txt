# CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
## Campus renovations well under way Stadium and Old Union projects to be complete by Fall 2006 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
By the end of this year, the hard
hats will come off, according to the
Department of Project Manage
ment, which anticipates that the
Stanford Stadium and renovated
Old Union projects will be complet
ed by September 2(X)6 and Fall 2006,
respectively.
According to Jack Cleary, director
of Project Management, neither site
has experienced any significant
budgeting problems or scheduling
delays.
Since the Stanford Stadium's
press building and seats were demol
ished in November 2005, construc
tion crews have completed rough
grading, installed underground elec
trical and other utilities and built
structural columns, Cleary said. In
the next few months, all structural
work — including foundations, walls
and piers, as well as backfill mechan

ically-stabilized earth walls, a foun
dation for the press box and three
newly-dug tunnels — should be fin
ished.
With regard to Old Union, Cleary
said that all occupants have been re
located to allow for selected interior
demolition. Over the next few weeks,
construction fencing will be placed
around the building as the interior
demolition begins. Additional con
struction will occur with Board of
Trustees approval.

At the beginning of the 2(X)5-06
academic year, the ASSU worked
with the Office of Student Activities
to find space alternatives for individ
ual students and clubs that tradition
ally resided in Old Union.
"I'm really excited to see what the
new Old Union will look like be
cause I truly believe it has the poten
tial to become a central hotspot for
students, which is something I've
found to be lacking in my undergraduate ca
reer," said ASSU President Melanie Kan
nokada. a senior.
Since the recent site of Commencement
— Stanford Stadium — will not be avail
able in 2006 due to construction, the ASSU
has also partnered with Stanford seniors
and administrators to develop an alterna
tive solution. Graduation for the Class of
2006 will be held at the Stanford football
practice field.
"The relocation of 2006 commencement
discussions made it clear to me that the most
important part of the ceremony is not the lo
cation, but being able to share the experi
ence with my family and closest friends."
Kannokada said.
Many students said they have barely no
ticed the construction, but said they are gen
erally pleased with the University's pursuit
of both projects.

"I think construction is a good sign that
the University is constantly renewing itself,"
noted fourth-year electrical engineering
doctoral student Paul Gurney, who said that
he has not been affected by either project.
Graduate Student Council Co-Chair
Thomas Lee, a fourth-year electrical engi
neering doctoral student, is especially exited
about how the two projects will impact stu
dent life.
"In terms of Old Union, having more stu
dent space in the center of campus will be a
great thing for student life." Lee said.'i hope
that it will serve as a social center and bring
the campus closer together. Plus a smaller,
more intimate stadium will make for a better
football experience. I hope the new facility
translates into more wins for the Cardinal."
Stanford Student Enterprises Chief Ex
ecutive Officer Justin Fishner-Wolfson be
lieves that the renovation of Old Union is an
opportunity to revitalize space at the center
of campus, which will greatly benefit student
life.
"Space allocation is an incredibly compli
cated process, and while the University has
involved students during planning, they

must continue to work hard to ensure that
the plans are flexible as needs cliange," Fish
ner-Wolfson said. "Dean Boardman is rela
tively new to the current plan, but he has
been very responsive, and I expect the final
product to be a vibrant student center."
Students using the cultural centers also
expressed their satisfaction with the im
provements to Old Union.
"I'm glad to see that the University is cre
ating a central student services center in Old
Union." said first-year education doctoral
student Adam Bad Wound, who frequently
uses the Native American Cultural Center.
"Among all the innovative architectural de
signs around campus, it's nice tosee a histor
ical building like Old Union being restored
and its original presence preserved."
For her part, Kannokada said she plans to
return to see the new Stanford Stadium post
graduation.
"I have so many wonderful memories
from the old Stanford Stadium,"Kannokada
said.
