## Campus renovations well under way Stadium and Old Union projects to be complete by Fall 2006 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
By the end of this year, the hard
hats will come off, according to the
Department of Project Manage
ment, which anticipates that the
Stanford Stadium and renovated
Old Union projects will be complet
ed by September 2(X)6 and Fall 2006,
respectively.
According to Jack Cleary, director
of Project Management, neither site
has experienced any significant
budgeting problems or scheduling
delays.
Since the Stanford Stadium's
press building and seats were demol
ished in November 2005, construc
tion crews have completed rough
grading, installed underground elec
trical and other utilities and built
structural columns, Cleary said. In
the next few months, all structural
work — including foundations, walls
and piers, as well as backfill mechan

ically-stabilized earth walls, a foun
dation for the press box and three
newly-dug tunnels — should be fin
ished.
With regard to Old Union, Cleary
said that all occupants have been re
located to allow for selected interior
demolition. Over the next few weeks,
construction fencing will be placed
around the building as the interior
demolition begins. Additional con
struction will occur with Board of
Trustees approval.

students, which is something I've
