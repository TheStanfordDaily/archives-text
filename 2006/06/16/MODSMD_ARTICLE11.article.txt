## Edwards calls for poverty relief Former Senator and vice presidential candidate sees Democratic gains in November 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
Whether to regain the democratic idealism lost in the 2004
presidential election, or to catch a glimpse of one of People Mag
azine s "sexiest politicians," students and community members
packed into Kresge Auditorium last night to hear former senator
and vice presidential candidate John Edwards speak.
Co-sponsored by Stanford In Government (SIG) and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau, Edwards' talk focused primarily on
what he deems "the great moral issue of our time," namely, the
roughly 37 million Americans who wake up every day in poverty.
" rhere's a huge void of moral leadership in this country," he
told the audience in his charismatic twang. "There is a hunger in
America. A hunger to be inspired again. [Helping the poor] is not
something we do for them, it's something we do for us. It says
something about the character of America"
Highlighting his work as director of the University of North
Carolina's Center on Poverty, Work and Opportunity, the former
senator outlined his plan for politicians in Washington — as well
as students on college campuses — to aid the plight of the less for
tunate.
Hurricane Katrina brought the issue of poverty to the fore
front of American discourse, Edwards said, showing that "pover
ty does have a face in this country." That face is often a face of
color, he stressed, referring to the largely African American pop
ulation of New Orleans's Ninth Ward district decimated by the
hurricane and subsequent flooding.
First among his proposed remedies for poverty in America is
to end the "embarrassment" of the current national minimum
wage. Proving that he had not lost his knack for the political stump
speech, Edwards proposed raising the minimum wage to $7.50 per
hour and lobbying the states to make his plan work
"We're going to win," he asserted. "We're going to win them all."
Other propositions — which Edwards admitted ranged from
"modest" to "controversial" — included the unionization of all
service jobs; the creation of work bond accounts to remedy asset
debt; enlarging the scope of housing vouches; and modifying the
federal budget by removing tax cuts for the highest brackets and
subsidies for oil and gas industries.
"I don't know about you, but I'm not very worried about how
Exxon is doing," he said, drawing laughter and applause from the
audience.
Education was central to Edward's proposal.
"If America wants to be competitive in the long-run, education
is the single most important thing to do, "he said.
Finally, Edwards concluded his talk by calling on college stu
dents to remain active in the war against poverty.
"We're better than this," he said. "Now is the time for young
people to speak out. You can't wait for someone else to lead."
In an interview with The Daily after his speech, Edwards elab
orated on the role college students can play in the political arena.

"College students are principled," he said. "And they have the
courage to speak for their causes". When asked about the protests
at Stanford last Friday when President Bush was scheduled to
visit the Hoover Institute, Edwards simply said, "God bless you."
"You are the heart and soul of democracy," he added. "Ac
countability makes democracy work."
In the interview, Edwards also offered insight into the upcom
ing midterm elections in November, predicting that "the Democ
rats are going to clearly make gains."
Given the tumultuous nature of the political arena, Edwards
could not predict which issues will be prioritized in the fall, with
the notable exceptions of immigration reform and Iraq. While a
number of Democrats, including his former running mate John
Kerry, have offered different strategies for winning the war in
Iraq, Edwards told The Daily that the differences between plans
were "nuanced."
