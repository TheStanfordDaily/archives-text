# HURRICANE KATRINA
## University bands together for Katrina recovery 
### JENNY ALLEN SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITERS 
Whether it's the Office of Undergraduate
Admission or the Department of Athletics,
various University divisions have coordinat
ed an extensive relief effort to aid survivors
and recovery from the devastation of Hurri
cane Katrina.
The University has been working to con
tact all Stanford students from the hurri
cane-affected areas to provide assistance.
The Registrar's office generated a list of both
undergraduate and graduate students with
home addresses listed for Alabama, Missis
sippi and Louisiana, totaling 106. Since it in
cludes students from throughout the three
states, it is actually larger than the number of
students who may have been affected by
Hurricane Katrina, according to Lee Con
nor, special assistant to the dean of student
affairs.
There have been no reported casualties
or missing persons, although "communica
tion in the area has been very difficult and
sporadic," according to Dean of Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman.
The President's Office arranged a meet
ing of several senior administrators repre
senting different offices shortly after Katrina
struck.
"Stanford is committed to help," began a
statement released by University President
John Hennessy in response to the aftermath
of Hurricane Katrina. A Web site, hurri
canekatrina.stanford.edu, was also set up to
publicize University initiatives. Below is a
sampling of the Stanford efforts to assist hur
ricane survivors.
Admission and Financial Aid
Stanford is using an online application
process to admit academically-qualified stu
dents from colleges and universities that
have been closed due to the hurricane as part
of a one-quarter guest program.
The Office of Financial Aid is accepting
requests for assistance from Stanford stu
dents from the Gulf Coast, including those
who have not previously received financial
aid, as well as the non-degree guest students.
"Given the tragedy these young people
have faced, Stanford is being flexible in

terms of working with students and their
families to assess the level of need given the
change in circumstances," said Richard
Shaw, dean of undergraduate admission and
financial aid, who replaced Robin Mamlet in
June.
Stanford admitted 36 guest students be
fore closing the process on Sept. 14. Of the
students who were accepted, 28 will be en
rolling. including three freshmen, seven
sophomores, eight juniors and 10 seniors.
Although priority was given to those
from the Bay Area, Stanford accepted stu
dents from across the nation for the fall quar
ter. The students, who are coming from Tli
lane University, Loyola University of New
Orleans. Dillard University and Xavier Uni
versity of Louisiana, will be able to study tu
ition free.
"The concept is that those students who
attend Stanford this Fall Quarter will pay tu
ition to their home institutions to assist with
the rebuilding efforts," Shaw said." It seemed
obvious that [reaching out to students from
the Gulf Coast region] is something Stanford
would want to do after such an extraordinary
tragedy."
The guest student program will take ef
fect for one quarter only, Shaw emphasized.
Students will be expected to return to their
home campuses in the winter. Additionally,
students were evaluated based only on their
test scores and transcripts when offered ad
mission.
Housing and Residential Education
Current Stanford students from affected
Gulf Coast communities who needed to re
turn to housing at Stanford early were able
to do so at no charge, including a meal plan.
As of last week, only six to eight continuing
students had expressed interest in returning
to campus early, according to Todd Benson,
director of Housing Assignments Services.
"Resident fellows and college directors
received the names of all of their future resi
dents who were impacted by the hurricane
and the resulting dramatic weather follow
ing it," said Jane Camarillo. director of Resi
dential Education. "They offered support
and encouragement as well as the early hous-
