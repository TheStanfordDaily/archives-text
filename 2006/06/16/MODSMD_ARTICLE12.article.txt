# HURRICANE KATRINA
## University bands together for Katrina recovery 
### JENNY ALLEN SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITERS 
Whether it's the Office of Undergraduate
Admission or the Department of Athletics,
various University divisions have coordinat
ed an extensive relief effort to aid survivors
and recovery from the devastation of Hurri
cane Katrina.
The University has been working to con
tact all Stanford students from the hurri
cane-affected areas to provide assistance.
The Registrar's office generated a list of both
undergraduate and graduate students with
home addresses listed for Alabama, Missis
sippi and Louisiana, totaling 106. Since it in
cludes students from throughout the three
states, it is actually larger than the number of
students who may have been affected by
Hurricane Katrina, according to Lee Con
nor, special assistant to the dean of student
affairs.
There have been no reported casualties
or missing persons, although "communica
tion in the area has been very difficult and
sporadic," according to Dean of Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman.
The President's Office arranged a meet
ing of several senior administrators repre
senting different offices shortly after Katrina
struck.
"Stanford is committed to help," began a
statement released by University President
John Hennessy in response to the aftermath
of Hurricane Katrina. A Web site, hurri
canekatrina.stanford.edu, was also set up to
publicize University initiatives. Below is a
sampling of the Stanford efforts to assist hur
ricane survivors.
Admission and Financial Aid
Stanford is using an online application
process to admit academically-qualified stu
dents from colleges and universities that
have been closed due to the hurricane as part
of a one-quarter guest program.
The Office of Financial Aid is accepting
requests for assistance from Stanford stu
dents from the Gulf Coast, including those
who have not previously received financial
aid, as well as the non-degree guest students.
"Given the tragedy these young people
have faced, Stanford is being flexible in

terms of working with students and their
families to assess the level of need given the
change in circumstances," said Richard
Shaw, dean of undergraduate admission and
financial aid, who replaced Robin Mamlet in
June.
Stanford admitted 36 guest students be
fore closing the process on Sept. 14. Of the
students who were accepted, 28 will be en
rolling. including three freshmen, seven
sophomores, eight juniors and 10 seniors.
Although priority was given to those
from the Bay Area, Stanford accepted stu
dents from across the nation for the fall quar
ter. The students, who are coming from Tli
lane University, Loyola University of New
Orleans. Dillard University and Xavier Uni
versity of Louisiana, will be able to study tu
ition free.
"The concept is that those students who
attend Stanford this Fall Quarter will pay tu
ition to their home institutions to assist with
the rebuilding efforts," Shaw said." It seemed
obvious that [reaching out to students from
the Gulf Coast region] is something Stanford
would want to do after such an extraordinary
tragedy."
The guest student program will take ef
fect for one quarter only, Shaw emphasized.
Students will be expected to return to their
home campuses in the winter. Additionally,
students were evaluated based only on their
test scores and transcripts when offered ad
mission.
Housing and Residential Education
Current Stanford students from affected
Gulf Coast communities who needed to re
turn to housing at Stanford early were able
to do so at no charge, including a meal plan.
As of last week, only six to eight continuing
students had expressed interest in returning
to campus early, according to Todd Benson,
director of Housing Assignments Services.
"Resident fellows and college directors
received the names of all of their future resi
dents who were impacted by the hurricane
and the resulting dramatic weather follow
ing it," said Jane Camarillo. director of Resi
dential Education. "They offered support
and encouragement as well as the early hous-
ing if [students] needed it."
Undergraduate and graduate
guest students are eligible to fill va
cancies left by Stanford students
who are studying abroad — 45 un
dergraduate housing openings this
fall. Fifteen of those have been
awarded to guest students, who will
have to pay for room and board. But
there are alternatives for those who
are unable to do so.
"There have been some very gen
erous offers of housing support from
local community members and
many local Stanford alumni in sur
rounding areas who have offered
rooms in their homes to hurricane
affected students coming here as
needed," said Rodger Whitney, exec
utive director of Student Housing.
New Student Orientation
The Freshman Dean's Office has
been asked to help the visiting stu
dents make a smooth transition to
Stanford, and visiting students have
been invited to attend New Student
Orientation, or NSO, which started
yesterday.
"While we realize that most of
[the guest students] have been to ori
entation at their home institution,
[Stanford NSO] will provide them
with an opportunity to get acquaint
ed with Stanford's resources and the
community they will be joining," said
Krista Zizzo, director of outreach
and assessment in the Freshman
Dean's Office.
Visiting students are encouraged
to join the transfer community
events, which would enable them to
meet a smaller group of new stu
dents who are also coming to Stan
ford from another university, Zizzo
said.
"The Freshman Dean's Office
reached out to incoming freshmen
who live in areas that may have been
affected by the hurricane to make
sure they are okay, and to see if they
had any needs we could address,"
said Jim Kim, assistant dean of fresh
men.
Each guest student will be as
signed an undergraduate advisor
through Undergraduate Advising
Programs. The advisors of current
students affected by the hurricane
will also be notified of the special cir
cumstances.

Stanford Medical School
Professor Eric A. Weiss explained
on the Stanford School of Medicine
Web site last week that the Stanford
Medical Center and Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital are working
with the United States Department
of Health and Human Services to
help staff medical tents setup for vic
tims of the hurricane.
According to Weiss, over 100
physicians, nurses and ancillary staff
have signed up to help provide med
ical support, and the Medical School
plans to eventually provide "an en
tire cadre of health care providers
and ancillary help to staff one of
these tents" for two to four weeks.
"I have been very impressed with
the tremendous amount of support
and willingness to volunteer from all
of the staff at Stanford," Weiss stat
ed.
Stanford Law School
Stanford Law School opened its
doors to five displaced third-year
law students from Tlilane University
for the fall term. The law school has
waived tuition for these students, al
lowing their home schools to keep
tuition already paid to help compen
sate staff and faculty, all of which are
being kept on payroll, in hopes that
work will resume before the end of
the semester.
"Given the scale of the tragedy,
our efforts are small, but we hope
not meaningless," said Larry
Kramer, dean of the Law School.
"Students who were working to
ward their professional careers at
TUlane and Loyola were about to
have those careers disrupted and
delayed, with all the attendant
problems. Hopefully, we can help
them avoid that and enable them to
keep their lives on track."
Christian Dallman,one of the vis
iting students from Tlilane, said he
has been "humbled and amazed" by
the outpouring of support.
"Although the circumstances of
my arrival seem dire, I find myself in
a better place than many of those
who were affected by Hurricane Ka
trina, so 1 have little to complain
about," Dallman said. "Everyone at
Stanford Law has been incredibly
gracious and 1 look forward to
spending the semester here."
Graduate Schools
The Registrar's Office provided
assistance for graduate degree pro
grams in Earth Sciences, Educa

tion, Engineering and Humanities
and Sciences. The office received
eight applications from affected
graduate students. After reviewing
the students' qualifications, it for
warded the applications to the spe
cific departments for decisions, ac
cording to Kate Chesley, associate
director of University communica
tions.
The School of Earth Sciences has
heard from one student from Tlilane,
and they expect to hear from more.
The school is already housing the
chair of the Louisiana State Univer
sity Geology Department.
The School of Engineering has
not yet capped the number of gradu
ate students it will accept from the
region, but they will accept only dis
placed engineering students that
would normally qualify for admis
sion, Chesley explained.
Stanford Alumni Association
There are 251 Stanford alumni
currently living in the official disas
ter zone and 674 living in the Gulf re
gion, according to Stanford Alumni
Association President Howard Wolf,
class of 1980. The staff at the associa
tion has been trying for the past
week to get in touch with alumni in
the area to understand both their
status and needs.
On Thursday, Sept. 9, Wolf sent an
e-mail to over 110,000 Stanford
alumni around the world — the total
number for whom they have e-mail
addresses — informing them both of
Stanford's response to Hurricane
Katrina and of an online clearing
house designed to help Stanford
alumni affected.
The clearinghouse is located on
the association's Web site, www.stan
fordalumni.org, within the InCircle
virtual online community. To date,
there have been a multitude of posts
from both those in need and those
offering assistance.These needs have
included housing, work and profes
sional clothing.
"In one representative case, a re
quest for professional women's
clothing was met with eight offers of
assistance within minutes of the orig
inal posting," Wolf said. "Similar
matches have occurred for housing."
Various student groups, the ath
letic department and University em
ployees have all made contributions
to the Katrina relief efforts as well.
