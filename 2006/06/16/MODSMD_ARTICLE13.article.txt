## REPAIRING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS 
### SINI MATIKAINEN 
While most of their classmates fresh
man year were trying to navigate
their schedules and the intricacies of
dorm life, Yale University students
Ethan Hutt and Aaron Tang were
tnling to figure out how to reform the American educa
tioyl system. The two — who graduated in 2005 — dis-

covered a mutual interest in education reform
while they were freshmen and eventually start -

Ed Our Education, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to raising awareness and

support for higher-quality
and more equitable
ui:~

public education
in the United
States.

"The
more we
thought about

it, the more we
realized that seri-

ous changes were
needed in public

schools, which led us to
think about ways that young

people could have a say in edu
cation reform "Tang says.

Hutt and Tang have fo
cused specifically on building support

among the people that the education sys
tem affects most — students.

Our Education received the Echoing Green
grant, which provides funding for "Best Emerging

Social Change Entrepreneurs," according to Hutt and
Tang.
Additionally, U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.), and
Rep Chaka Fattah (D-Pa), have praised the organi
zation.

The nonprofit hopes to receive even more at
tention by launching a petition demanding that local,
state and federal legislators make improving public ed

ucation a higher priority. The organization aims to col
lect one million signatures from students age 13 to 24.
Tang and Hutt say they hope the petition will force
legislators to take students' concerns more seriously.
"Students are the primary stakeholders in educa
tion, but government representatives often don't see
them as constituents," Hutt says.
Tang adds,"lf you get a million young people — the
stakeholders themselves — to stand up and say that
they are tired of legislators not devoting the necessary
resources and common-sense policies to public school
ing, the potential for change is enormous."
More than 3,000 students have signed the petition,
including several from Stanford.
Steven Siger, a Stanford law student who was in
volved in Our Education while at Yale, says he signed
because he feels that students are not given enough of
a chance to provide input for education policy.
"While Our Education acknowledges that [school
boards, teachers' unions, legislators and interest
groups] have an important role to play in formulating
education policy. Our Education also believes that
students have equally important insights into what
improvements and changes our school system needs,"
Siger says.
Another supporter, sophomore Megan Hsu, says
that her involvement with East Palo Alto tutoring
sparked her interest in education reform.
"One of the most difficult things to do is to look a
child in the eyes and realize that he/she has so much
hope still and hasn't been hit by the harsh reality that
his/her situation is bad and the government isn't
doing enough to try to help," Hsu explains. "Children
should be able to have class in actual rooms, not trail
ers with no heaters or air conditioning. 1 don't under
stand how many things could possibly be more impor
tant than giving all kids a fair chance."
Stanford students who have signed the petition
study topics ranging from engineering to communica
tion, but are united by the common cause.
