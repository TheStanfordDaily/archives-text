Stanford word and
■ unfortunately, during
my earliest months
here, my first and only coffee source,
too. I dabbled in Peet's, the Bookstore and Moonbeans, of
course, but for the most part my reflex about where to go for
coffee? CoHo.
As my tastes matured, I longed for new experiences. 1
wanted variety, atmosphere culture — and I wanted better
tasting coffee.
So this week, I resolved — No Go CoHo. I will branch out
and explore other sources for my caffeine fix.
Olives
My first stop is Olives The cafe accommodates customers
with indoor and outdoor seating, a convenient location be
hind the history corner and — the big bonus — the fact that
you can use meal plan points. The staff will also modify any
drink on their menu.
"Students will say 'Hey, can you make this?' and we'll do
it; well do whatever it is to try to please the palate," says em
ployee Lupe Pena.
Pena cites sugar-free options as one very popular accom
modation and offers me a sugar-free, soy milk chai latte, so I
can see why for myself. It's delicious and tastes more like tea
than any sickly-sweet alternative I've had elsewhere.
The cafe teems with regulars, among them freshman
Sarah Vick.
"I have my scone and soy latte from Olives every single
day," she says."I don't think I could live without them."

The Cubberley Cafe outdoor seating is charming — gar

den path-style lights, delicate tables and old-fashioned
wastebaskets. Indoors, it is just as cozy.

On my visit, doctoral student Jong Lee sat in an
armchair with his usual-black coffee. He comes "al
most every day" for the comfortable atmosphere
anrl "inst rioht" <ti7ps

ana just rignt serving sizes.
"Cubberley's cups are smaller than other places',"
Lee says, indicating his own short coffee. "They're just
the right size."
Another draw:Torrefazione.
Manager Davennia Washington says their coffee
has "a different flavor."
"We carry Torrefazione Italia, and nobody else has
it on campus," she says.
cgiao!

Next, my thoughts turn to Italy, so I visit Ciao!. It's a
practical, quiet workspace, with shiny tables and a pool
like fountain outside. Customers buzz in and out. Ciao!, it
seems, is a dining oasis.
The specialty is LavAzza coffee latte.
"The latte is definitely our most popular drink." says em
ployee Hamilton Woods.
The enticing menu includes Tiramisu, gelato, Panini and
— of course — espresso.
"A lot of Italians come in; they love the coffee," Woods
says.
"And friendly people work here!" exclaims Violet
Rosario, another employee.

I reach Cafe DNA at "Happy Hour," the time between 8
and 10 a.m. when the cafe's low prices are further reduced.
"Our Happy Hour prices are the lowest on campus," says
employee Jose Bonilla, citing that a "single latte, from 8-10, is

$1.75."
Despite this

attraction, Bonil
la estimates that

only 5 percent of cus
tomers are students
"It's a secret place,"

he says.
The cafe is in a bright atrium. Potted plants are arranged
around wicker tables, couches and armchairs. It has a Tahiti
like atmosphere, except the scent wafting through is not co
conut, but rather Sodium Hypochlorite.
Drinking my Moschetti-brand coffee, I realize I don't
want to leave.
