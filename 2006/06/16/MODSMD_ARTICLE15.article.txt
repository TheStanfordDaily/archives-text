# Prince Charming: Beast, loser or rapist?
## 
### 
A few nights ago I watched one of my favorite
movies of all time — Disney's animated mas
terpiece, "Beauty and the Beast" — and it
brought back a lot of good memories. When I first saw
the film in a theater in 1991,1 was seven, and I imme
diately identified with the female protagonist. Belle al
ways had her nose in a book. Belle didn't really fit in
with the people around her. Belle spoke to inanimate
objects on a regular basis despite the objections of her
family.
I was so enamored with the movie that I would
wander around yelling "Bonjour! Bonjour! Bon
jour!" to the drug dealers, convicts and ne'er-do-wells
that roamed our neighborhood at that time. They
thought I was either possessed or retarded, so they left
me alone. Little town full of little people, I would sing
to myself happily, as someone got stabbed in the face
for talking to the po-po.
Anyway,"Beauty and the Beast"obviously provid
ed me with a magnificent technicolor escape that I still
find provocative, but acknowledging the important
role it played in my childhood made me wonder how
much the film influenced my perception of love and
romance. I mean, the Beast is a pretty huge bastard to
Belle,yet they fall in love anyway. And would she have
still stuck with him if he hadn't turned into David Has
selhoff at the end of the movie?
Now, don't get me wrong. I am not about to argue
that Disney is responsible for the dating scene on cam
pus any more that I am about to argue that the song
"Be Our Guest" is solely responsible for childhood
obesity (although, now that I think of it, the song does
contain the lyrics "tie your napkin 'round your neck
cherie/ and binge on Peeps because nobody likes
you"). But the bottom line is that if Disney movies are
the closest thing we have to a common cultural curren
cy, we should be cognizant of the messages we ab
sorbed as children. For example:
Peter Pan. Wendy and Tinkerbell both have the
hots for Peter, despite the fact that he flatly refuses to
grow up and spends most of his time with the infamous
street gang known as the Lost Boys. Wendy attempts
to win his heart by playing mother to the Lost Boys,
while Tinkerbell gives him copious amounts of hallu
cinogenic "fairy dust" that allows him to "fly." Peter
refuses to commit to either woman and instead occu
pies himself by fighting a disabled man with a hook for
a hand.
Sleeping Beauty. Thanks to some heavy partying
and an unfortunately-placed spinning wheel. Princess
Aurora passes out cold. Prince "Sleaze-o" Phillip, sens
ing his opportunity to finally get some ass, starts mak
ing out with Aurora in what is obviously a nonconsen
sual act. Aurora wakes up, the two get married and no
one ever presses charges.
The Little Mermaid. Prince Eric falls in love with a
freakish half-woman, half-fish mutant, begging the
question, "What exactly constitutes beastiality?" She
fails to tell him about her debilitating kleptomania,
which has compelled her to rent several caverns in
order to house her collections of stolen crap. In the
end, Ariel becomes a human, abandons her dreams of
becoming a singing sensation and presumably lives a
life of leisure uncomplicated by the fact that her hus
band has a thing for fins. Their marriage lasts until she
catches Eric in a compromising position with a can of
tuna fish.
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In one of the
most twisted stories of all time, a princess with a name
that sounds like she's the grand wizard of the KKK
runs away from her evil stepmother. She finds refuge
in the forest with seven men whose growth has been
severely stunted by their work in the mines. Seven
men. One woman. Either they're all gay or Dopey is
getting some pretty sloppy seconds. Anyway, Snow
White-Supremacist goes into anaphylactic shock after
eating an apple,only to be resurrected by a prince with
a severe case of necrophilia. How much acid was Walt
dropping when they made this movie?
