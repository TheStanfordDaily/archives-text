UT T onk if you're against genocide."
I I If you've had occasion to pass
JL JLthe intersection of El Camino
and Embarcadero over the past several
months, you're likely to have encountered a
sign calling for action against the violence in
Darfur, Sudan. It's sometimes held by an
elderly woman, once by a middle school girl,
but always by someone who makes you feel
that you're a poor user of the First Amend
ment. The sign tends to spark two reactions
in me.
The first is that I think genocide is bad,
and I want it to stop, so I honk. The second is
that I wonder why I bothered to. A critical
mass of honking does not cause peacekeep
ers to materialize in northern Africa. Always,
I leave frustrated, feeling moved by a call to
action but left impotent to effect change.
I imagine many of the 120-odd attendees
of former Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Carol Browner's talk on glob

al warming last night may have left feeling
the same way.
For an audience in the Graduate School
of Business, Browner came equipped with
convincing numbers, like 928 — the number
of peer-reviewed papers that the journal Sci
ence read to assess scholarly opinion on cli
mate change. Zero was the number of papers
that challenged the merits of the climate
change hypothesis.
Another convincing number: 11 — the
number of countries, including the United
States, whose national science academies
said in 2005 that the knowledge about cli
mate change is thorough enough to justify
immediate action.
Global warming is not a partisan issue,
Browner argued. Her conclusion: It's time
for Congress to pass national legislation im
plementing a cap-and-trade program for
greenhouse gas emissions. Like Time maga
zine, she's had enough of the nay-sayers and

science fiction authors like Michael Crichton
passing as expert scientific witnesses in the
U.S. Congress.
And she convinced me. But, Browner was
likely preaching to the choir — and the choir
may not have liked the chorus.
Browner acknowledged that environ
mental groups and activists have been calling
for action on climate change for years but
said that major action on environmental is
sues tends only to come when the govern
ment in successful at engaging the business
community. A constituency that craves pre
dictability and certainty, businesses dislike
inconsistent laws on carbon dioxide emis
sions and increased insurance premiums
prompted by fear of likely-catastrophic con
sequences. When the prospect of that world
approaches, they'd rather it be regulated to
ensure consistency, even if it costs a few extra
dollars.
When asked by an audience member

what individuals can do to help combat
global warming, Browner's answer was
simple: "Not all problems in society need
to focus on individual actions." That is, a
coal or aluminum plant is responsible for a
lot more greenhouse gas emissions than a
Palo Alto home, so let's focus on the forest
and not get bogged down in the trees. Busi
nesses, she claimed, are likely to act not be
cause of swells in public sentiment against
global warming, but because they have to.
So whither the role of the citizen, then,
standing on the corner, urging passers by to
"Honk if you're against global warming"?
Or, more appropriately, "Honk if you're bik
ing."
In part, Browner is right — history bears
out her point that legislative action on envi
ronmental issues proceeds much more easily
when businesses are on board, or can at least
envision a technological solution to the prob
lem at hand. The private sector, for example.

was largely ahead of the government when
concerns about stratospheric ozone deple
tion caused the phase-out of chlorofluoro
carbons (CFCs).
But, just as many Palo Alto residents re
fuse to feel too small to challenge genocide,
despite what Browner says, you shouldn't
feel like too minor of a player to affect move
ments to rein in climate change.
Some of the business imperatives Brown
er credited for eventually enabling regula
tion of greenhouse gases have necessarily
been the result of local rather than national
actions.
