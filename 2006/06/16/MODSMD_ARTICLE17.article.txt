yj / obody ever said being a
/\/ graduate student was
112 )/ 1/ easy. But add a tricky job
J market, becoming a
mom and raising a family to the equation and
you're looking at a life infinitely harder to
balance. That may be one reason why aca
demic posts in the sciences are overwhelm
ingly populated by men. Yes, even at Stan
ford.
"We call it the pipeline effect," explains
fourth-year chemistry doctoral candidate
Chrissy Brown. "At the undergraduate level
you've got about 50 percent of women going
into the sciences. In graduate school, that
number drops to about 35 percent. And after
graduation, the number of women faculty in
the sciences is about 12 percent." That means
a lot of women are dropping out in the

process, leaving school before they complete
their PhDs or abandoning their plans for an
academic career altogether.
Take the Chemistry Department at Stan
ford. It has had a grand total of three women
faculty — ever.
Brown wasn't going to let that slide. In
2(X)4,she and three other graduate students in
chemistry — Nahrain Kamber, Alice Lincoln
and Tracy Terry — founded the Stanford
Chemistry Women's Committee on Graduate
Life (WCGL) to address the imbalance of
women in the sciences. The University was
skeptical, as was the department, but the four
women managed to scrape together enough
funding to get the group off the ground.
One year later, WCGL brought home the
Dean of Students Outstanding Achievement
Award.

"Our goal was to create an environment
that's supportive of women," Brown says. By
organizing seminars and job panels, "we
hoped to contribute to graduate student life,
not just to criticize it," she explains.
And so the group began hosting events
and forums that would open channels of com
munication within the department, allowing
graduate students and faculty to address is
sues of work-life balance and the difficulties
of landing a job after graduation.
Today, WCGL sponsors quarterly semi
nars, dubbed "Perspectives." Women in the
field are invited to speak to science graduate
students, to share advice, anecdotes and inspi
ration.
Limited career choices seem to contribute
to the problem of dwindling female numbers
in the sciences, and WCGL plans their semi-

nars accordingly. The most recent seminars
include talks on government jobs in science,
non-traditional scientific careers and a dis
cussion with young faculty on life in acade
mia.
WCGL lobbied for Stanford's Distin
guished Women in Science Colloquia
(DWIS), which later received funding from
the Chemistry Department. At these collo
quia, significant women scientists are invited
to Stanford for two days of meetings and
talks. Past guests have included Mildred
Dresselhaus of the Physics Department at
MIT and Cynthia Friend, chair of the Chem
istry Department at Harvard.
The idea, according to the DWIS Web site,
is to give graduate students and recent post
doctoral students the chance to "interact with
prominent female role models."

But it's not just women who are concerned
about the gender imbalance and the overall
lack of female mentors in the sciences. Two of
WCGL's active members are men. That's be
cause we're about "diversity in general," ex
plains third-year PhD student and WCGL
Co-chair Meg Desko. "There are certainly
male graduate students and professors who
recognize the imbalance."
Prasad Ganesen is one such student. A
third-year graduate student studying bio
physical chemistry, he says he joined the
group after noticing the disparity between the
numbers of male and female faculty members
in the Chemistry Department.
