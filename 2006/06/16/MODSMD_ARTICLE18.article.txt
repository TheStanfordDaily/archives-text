# ROKR: New cell rings with mediocrity
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
On Sep 7, Motorola, Inc. and Apple ushered in a
new era of cell phone technology with the re
lease of the Motorola ROKR. the world's first
mobile phone to come bundled with the omnipresent
computer media player, iTUnes.
iiie ROKR (pronounced "rocker") allows users
to transfer up to 100 songs from their computer li
brary to their mobile device. At a time when sporting
white earbuds has become everyone's favorite fash
ion statement and iPods are de rigueur, the two tech
gurus' combined effort is expected to send shock
waves through the industry — stopping right at the
wallets of eager consumers.
Weighing in at a bantam 3.77 ounces, the light
weight ROKR counterpunches with a hefty $249
price tag — and that's when you sign a two-year con
tract with Cingular. Purchasing the phone without a
contract can run up to $400.
Ed Zander, chairman and chief executive officer
of Motorola, explained that Motorola's latest brain
child delivers an unprecedented service to merit the
phone's stifling cost.
"The Motorola ROKR represents the ultimate
convergence of mobile communications and music,"
Zander said in a recent press release. "Fusing iHines
with your always-with-you mobile phone, we're rev
olutionizing the way the world experiences mobile
self-expression and entertainment."
But in the two short weeks since ROKR's release,
professional critics and gadget enthusiasts have al
ready drafted a laundry list of complaints about the
phone. Whereas Motorola's other iconic product, the
half-inch-thin RAZR, received rave reviews for its
sleek design, the ROKR is being lambasted for its
unimaginative shape.
Because it is a stodgy, rectangular, non-flip phone,
the ROKR might be pegged as "so two years ago" by
its purportedly young target audience.
And Alfred Hermida, technology editor for BBC
News, points out the flashy lights adorning the
phone's boxy edges, strictly deeming them a "gim
mick designed to appeal to younger callers."
Whether the ROKR's simple light-emitting diode
(LED) patterns — which flicker in sync with the
music — can salvage both its aesthetic and function
al shortcomings remains to be seen.
Kent German and James Kim, editors for the pop
ular tech review Web site, cnet.com, also claimed the
new phone suffers from "several tedious limitations."
"It won't replace your iPod by any means," they
wrote in a Sep 7 article.
Transferring songs through the ROKR's sluggish
USB 1.1 interface is sure to frustrate users acclimat
ed to the current 2.0 standard.
Nowhere to be found is the plug-and-play ease of
iPod, as the ROKR's library can only be controlled
through a separate data transfer application. The
phone comes equipped with Bluetooth, a wireless
connection that enables devices to exchange infor
mation, but it does not support song delivery.
If 100 MB of storage space seems like a paltry
amount, further consider that it is an artificially-im
posed limit on the flash drive — Apple would not
want to detract from the success of its already estab
lished iPod line.
And while those white earbuds are an mp3 enthu
siast's badge of honor, they're also compulsory here.
Motorola plays to Apple-induced familiarity and
throws in a very similar pair of its own. but outside
headsets will need an adapter.
Those who give into pressure and purchase the
world's first phone with iTlines will be happy to know
that the ROKR adopts the nested menus used by
iPod.
Those unconvinced by Motorola's flawed output
might just side with Hermida, who hints at an Amer
ican willingness to jump at unnecessary and under
performing goods.
"By UK standards, the ROKR feels like yester
day's phone," Hermida wrote. "It may fare better in
the U.S., where handsets have tended to be somewhat
basic and lacking in the many functions taken for
granted in other parts of the world."
Oh well, there's always the iPod Nano.
