A Thile Stanford doctoral students
enjoy priceless academic re
▼ T sources, their small salaries have
them clipping coupons, learning to use a
stove and prioritizing simple pleasures.
"I feel like I live a comfortable life, hut
my standard of living is below what it was
when I was working in industry," says Kat
Murray, a second- year doctoral student in
communication."! don't go out to eat very
often...and I buy the cheapest stuff possi
ble for groceries. Going to Whole Foods is
a big splurge."
Stanford covers Murray's tuition and
benefits each quarter, and she makes an
additional $6,600 per quarter as a teach
ing assistant. But when asked whether
graduate student incomes are as sparse as
they're rumored to be, Murray says she
"thinks the short answer is 'yes."'
Physics doctoral student Matt Pyle
confirms this claim — his yearly salary of
$25,000 forces him to waste time out
smarting the baristas at upscale coffee
shops.
"If you're dying for a cappuccino, order
a macchiato," Pyle advises. "Real macchi
atos have only a dollop of froth, but in
America they butcher them by adding in
way too much milk as well. Effectively,you
end up with a cappuccino but about $1.50
cheaper."
Graduate students can get by on their
salaries, but because Bay Area living is ex
pensive and on-campus housing costs be
tween $650 and $900 per month, there's
not much room for extravagance. For ex
ample, many graduate students lack the
disposable income to pay for satisfying
vacations.
"It is a bit ironic, I think, that while in
school we do have the breaks between
quarters, but we don't tend to have the fi
nancial resources to take advantage of
this time," Murray says.

Pyle, however, has
adopted a scheme to
dodge this problem.

"Take vacations on your
adviser," he says."I feel that
this is the most important
way I squeeze every last bit of
enjoyment out of my meager

monetary means. I figure that a
two-week trip to Europe or Asia
usually costs about $2,000 to
$3,ooo...however, when your advis
er picks up the tab, it's almost free.'

Besides bleeding their advisers dry,
graduate students have devised other
tactics to keep themselves happy and sane
on a tight budget.

Fourth-year computer science doc
toral student Rachel Weinstein
hosts jewelry-making events
through Luxe Jewels, an organi
zation that helps women build

"profitable, flexible and fun V
businesses," according to its Web
site, http://www.luxejewels.com. We
instein purchases supplies from Luxe at
wholesale prices, and event attendees then
pay for the materials at retail prices. She
keeps the difference as a profit, brings all
the tools to the event and provides any nec
essary instruction.
"TTiat means [they get] as much instruc
tion as they need to make sure they walk
away with something they're proud to
show off to their friends," Weinstein says.
"There's many different kinds of events
from ones where you can design your own
piece to simply working from a kit. The
events make great girls' nights and unique
fundraisers. Because I hold parties when I
can and want to, everything revolves
around how much time I have. This flexi
bility, combined with a low start up cost
and, of course, fun was what attracted me
to it."
Murray says that besides trying to
make extra money, hanging out with other
graduate students can also help keep her

wal
let padded.
"[Graduate
students] all have the
same budget issues," she explains. "Thus
there tends to be less conflict over what
restaurant to choose or whether to go to a
concert because none of us can afford
these luxuries. I do run into these conflicts
when I want to spend time with friends
who are not graduate students because
they are living in a different income
bracket."
So what do these throngs of graduate
students do for low-cost kicks?
Murray and her friends like to hike and
spend time in Northern California's great
outdoors. They also gather at people's
homes and party.
"We do a lot of happy hours — this is
a way people can spend or not spend what
they want to," she says.

And Pyle chooses his
drinking binges carefully.
"Only get hammered at bars on spe
cial occasions," Pyle says. "Hey, I dropped
more than 2K on a bachelor party one
weekend in London for a friend, but hav
ing more than four drinks out on an un
eventful evening in which nothing will
probably happen is absurd. On the other
hand, if the girls at the table next to you
are dying for body shots or it's the first
time one of your friends has ever been
drunk, bring out the tequila."
Notably, second-year physics doctor
al student Surjeet Rajendran says he man
ages to "lead a fairly yuppie-ish lifestyle"
on a budget quite similar to that of Pyle.
