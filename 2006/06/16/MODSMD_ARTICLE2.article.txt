## CAMPUS CRIME Robberies burst the bubble Two students robbed at gunpoint within a week, campus reacts with shock 
### JAMES HOHMANN SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
For the second time in less than a
week, a student was robbed at gun
point on campus. At around 11:30
p.m. Monday outside of Crothers
Hall, a graduate student on the way to
his room was accosted by three men,
one armed with a black semi-auto
matic handgun, demanding his money
and cell phone.
Police suspect that the crime was
connected with three additional
armed robberies in the past week â€”
one on campus and two in Palo Alto.
The student victim, whose name
was not made public, was crossing Es
condido Road toward his room in
Crothers Memorial Hall when the
men stopped him to ask for directions,
said Deputy Kenneth Bates of the
Department of Public Safety (DPS).
Once held up, the victim readily
complied with the suspects' demands,
according to police.
The victim described the suspects
as clean-shaven black men in their
mid-20s, according to Bates. The sus
pect holding the gun was between 5
feet 5 inches and 5 feet 7 inches and
weighed between 240 and 250
pounds. He was last seen wearing a
hat,jean shorts or pants, and a white T
shirt.
A taller and skinner second sus
pect wore a hat with a dark flannel
shirt and dark, long baggy pants. The
third suspect had a medium build and
was also estimated to be between 5
feet 5 inches to 5 feet 7 inches.
The suspects fled in a newer-model
red sedan. Sergeant Hilary Karp of
DPS told reporters.
Just before 2 a.m. Monday, a man
wielding a revolver robbed a female
at an ATM at Middlefield Road and
Colorado Avenue in Palo Alto.
Last Wednesday around 10:30
p.m., two black males took $20 from a
female undergraduate at gunpoint in
the Toyon parking lot, only a few hun
dred yards away from Monday nights
robbery.
Forty-five minutes later, two men
with pistols held up a male victim in
Palo Alto's Johnson Park.
Bates could not confirm or rule out
the involvement of the red sedan in
last Wednesday's incidents. He noted
that the suspects in Monday's on
campus robbery demanded both the
victim's cell phone and wallet while
the men only took the victim's wallet
last week.
"Suspect descriptions [from the
two incidents last Wednesday] are
very similar," Bates said. "It was likely
the same people, but we don't know
for sure."
Neither Stanford student was
harmed.
Palo Alto Police Department
spokesman Agent Dan Ryan ex
pressed concern about future crimes.
"People could be reading the
paper for inspiration, so we might
have some copycats," he told The
Daily.
The University was on edge yes
terday as students, faculty and law en
forcement coped with the untypical
incident on one of the nation's safest
campuses, and pondered how to re
spond. Before last week, Stanford's
campus had not seen a robbery in
volving a handgun since 1998.
"There will be an increased uni
formed presence on campus tonight,"
said Bates, who declined to provide
details, except to say that police will
be circling student residential areas.
With the "Stanford bubble" bro
ken, students across campus ex
pressed fear for their safety.
"Given that there have been two
incidents, I'm a little more worried
and I might start being more careful,"
said Crothers resident Ben Gold
smith, a second-year master's student
in Aeronautics and Astronautics.
University leaders issued a state
ment yesterday reassuring students
that they are working to protect cam
pus safety but reminding them that,

even on a normally safe campus, they
need to be careful.
President John Hennessy sent an
email to all members of the Stanford
community explaining what hap
pened and offering seven safety sug
gestions provided by the DPS.
"Historically, Stanford has been a
very safe community, but we also rec
ognize that the University is part of
the larger world, and we remind stu
dents to walk and travel with friends,
use well-lighted routes at night and
carry cell phones," Hennessy said in a
separate statement.
Hennessy promised that adminis
trators would "communicate fre
quently and widely" going forward.
The robberies have drawn exten
sive coverage from local media.
Last night, NBC-11 KNTV broad
casted live from Escondido Road at
11 p.m.
Bates said the victim remained
shaken from the attention the case
has been receiving. Monday's victim
met with a sketch artist yesterday af
ternoon to create three new pictures
of the suspects. These sketches were
not available at press time.
Bates added that the police have
received a series of leads throughout
the day TUesday, but would not com
ment on the progress of the ongoing
investigation. The suspects remain at
large.
