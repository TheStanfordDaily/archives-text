### JAMES HOHMANN SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
For the second time in less than a
week, a student was robbed at gun
point on campus. At around 11:30
p.m. Monday outside of Crothers
Hall, a graduate student on the way to
his room was accosted by three men,
one armed with a black semi-auto
matic handgun, demanding his money
and cell phone.
Police suspect that the crime was
connected with three additional
armed robberies in the past week â€”
one on campus and two in Palo Alto.
The student victim, whose name
was not made public, was crossing Es
condido Road toward his room in
Crothers Memorial Hall when the
men stopped him to ask for directions,
said Deputy Kenneth Bates of the
Department of Public Safety (DPS).
Once held up, the victim readily
complied with the suspects' demands,
according to police.
The victim described the suspects
as clean-shaven black men in their
mid-20s, according to Bates. The sus
pect holding the gun was between 5
feet 5 inches and 5 feet 7 inches and
weighed between 240 and 250
pounds. He was last seen wearing a
hat,jean shorts or pants, and a white T
shirt.
A taller and skinner second sus
pect wore a hat with a dark flannel
shirt and dark, long baggy pants. The
third suspect had a medium build and
was also estimated to be between 5
feet 5 inches to 5 feet 7 inches.
The suspects fled in a newer-model
red sedan. Sergeant Hilary Karp of
DPS told reporters.
Just before 2 a.m. Monday, a man
wielding a revolver robbed a female
at an ATM at Middlefield Road and
Colorado Avenue in Palo Alto.
Last Wednesday around 10:30
p.m., two black males took $20 from a
female undergraduate at gunpoint in
the Toyon parking lot, only a few hun
dred yards away from Monday nights
robbery.
Forty-five minutes later, two men
with pistols held up a male victim in
Palo Alto's Johnson Park.
Bates could not confirm or rule out
the involvement of the red sedan in
last Wednesday's incidents. He noted
that the suspects in Monday's on
campus robbery demanded both the
victim's cell phone and wallet while
the men only took the victim's wallet
last week.
"Suspect descriptions [from the
two incidents last Wednesday] are
very similar," Bates said. "It was likely
the same people, but we don't know
for sure."
