# BANNED TURNED AWAY at the Bank
## 
### MARIE-JO HONT-REYNAUD 
If your interest was peaked by last
week's article on blood donation
and you ran to the nearest blood
bank ready to get poked, you might have
been turned away for a variety of health
reasons.
Particularly at Stanford, Donor Re
cruitment Manager John Williams notes,
many people are involved in travel to
areas where they may be at risk of con
tracting malaria or mad cow disease,
conditions that lead to denial of blood
donation.
Another major factor in refusal is low
iron, Williams says, suggesting Cream of
Wheat as one of the best ways to in
crease iron. "Even better than spinach,"
he quips.
One limitation, however — the ban
on donation by gay men — has stirred up
controversy and even prompted stu
dents to stage a protest in front of a
blood mobile a couple of months back.
When screened before donation, fe
males are asked if they have had sex with
any men who have had sex with men and
males if they have ever had sex with an
other man. If they answer yes, they are

turned away from donation. While many
gay men choose to lie during this screen
ing, many consider it a form of discrimi
nation.
The regulation was originally institut
ed by the Blood Product Advisory Com
mittee (BPAC). a part of the Food and
Drug Administration. In 1983, at the
height of the AIDS crisis when it was
considered a predominantly gay disease,
the BPAC recommended a ban on blood
donations by gay men. The restriction
prohibits any man who has had sex with
another man since 1977 from donating
blood for the rest of his life.
The ban was partly justified at the
time because the technology to test the
blood was not available, explains first
year law student Andrew Bruck, who
has done extensive research on the topic.
At the time, it would take months for the
antibodies to appear in the blood.
However, according to Bruck, "We
now have nucleic acid testing which de
tects the virus itself in the body. It is
much more accurate and can detect it
within 10 days," he says.
Bruck believes that this testing can
now significantly, if not completely, reduce

TERESA McWALTERS/The Stanford Daily I

the risk of transferring HIV in donated
blood, but that the FDA is not examining
the available medical data on this topic in
its consideration of the gay ban.
Setting aside the potentially legiti
mate public health concerns, the way in
which the FDA limits gay men from do
nating, as compared to other popula
tions, reveals certain inconsistencies.
"There is simply no rational basis for
denying men who have had sexual con
tact even once with another man, yet
anyone else, despite potentially far more
risky sexual behavior, is free to donate
— the policy only bans men who've had
sex with a prostitute in the last year,"
says Spencer Jones, a second year law
student and Co-president of OutLaw,
the law student group which focuses on
issues of gay rights. "From our perspec
tive, the policy remains in place solely
out of animus and misconceptions re
garding gay men or, just as bad. inade
quate research and science."
There is a light at the end of the tun
nel, however, for activists like Bruck and
Jones, thanks to the support of several
national organizations. In March, the
Red Cross, the American Association of

and America's
Blood Centers —
the three largest
blood banks in the U.S. — issued a joint
statement to the FDA recommending a
change to the current policy and declar
ing the current lifetime deferral for men
who have had sex with other men to be
"medically and scientifically unwarrant
ed."
As it stands, the ban is still in place
and the Stanford Blood Bank screens for
homosexual activity even though it has
the advanced technology Bruck de
scribes.
"It's sexual profiling" says a male
sophomore who wishes to remain
anonymous. "Maybe there's a higher
risk, but if they can prove that they're
healthy just like anyone who is hetero
sexual, then there's no reason to stop
them from donating," he says.

Operations at the Stanford Blood Cen
ter, disagrees.
