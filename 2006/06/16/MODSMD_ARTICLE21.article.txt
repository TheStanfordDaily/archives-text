## One-day strike brings both sides to the table Workers, University resume talks after work stoppage 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
The one-day work stoppage that more
than 2,600 workers took part in on Dec. 12
could be a preview of a longer strike to
come if the University and Stanford Hospi
tal do not make significant concessions,
union leaders said after returning to the
table for talks the following day.
University and union representatives
disputed the success of the strike as they
continue to search for common ground.
With the facilitation of a federal media
tor requested by Stanford, negotiators for
the University and service workers re
opened talks the day after the strike. The
meeting had no conclusive results, and both
sides reiterated their positions.They agreed
to meet again, after returning from vaca
tions, on Jan. 4 and Jan. 11.
Negotiators mutually agreed to cancel
the Jan. 4 session. Representatives from
both sides do not expect to reach consensus
at the Jan. 11 meeting and more meetings
are expected after Wednesday.
The University has offered a more con
ciliatory tone in recent weeks and ex
pressed willingness late last week to resume
discussions with union leaders.
"We're looking forward to getting back
to the bargaining table on Jan. 11Univer
sity spokesman Alan Acosta said in an in
terview with The Daily. "We want to address
the issues that are being raised. We have
been doing that all along."
"We're optimistic," he added.
Union leaders expressed a readiness to
follow-up on the one-day strike with a
longer one if demands are not met.
"Management knows we are ready for
further action," said worker spokesman
Zev Kvitky, adding that another, potential
ly longer, strike is not out of the question.
"TTie Union is prepared for any situa
tion," he said. "We want to avoid another
strike, but what action we take next will de
pend upon the management's position
when we return to the bargaining table."

The University declined to specify what
precautions are being taken in case of a
longer strike.
"Our focus is on the talks," Acosta said.
"(In the case of a strike,] the University will
carry on."
Representatives of the Service Employ
ees International Union Local 715 (SEIU)
said work came to a stand still for 24 hours
beginning at 5 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 12.
They touted worker solidarity and favor
able media coverage as indications the
strike was successful.
"We sent a strong message to manage
ment that our members are very serious
about the issues," said Greg Pullman, staff
director for SEIU Local 715.
"Other than students taking finals, there
was very little work taking place at the Uni
versity on Monday," added Kvitky, who
called the strike an "incredible success."
Union leaders pointed out that this was
the first time both the Hospital and Univer
sity service workers went on strike simulta
neously.
The University service workers are striv
ing to make gains on re-opened sections of
a contract that is not set to expire until Au
gust 2(X)6.
Stanford administrators responded that
many workers — especially those at the
Hospital — crossed the picket lines, and
that the University coped well with the
slowdown.
While 90 percent of University workers
stayed at home or joined protesters on cam
pus, a spokeswoman for the medical center
reported that 300 of the 500 union members
scheduled to work at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital crossed the picket lines.
Union leaders said the Hospital misrepre
sented these figures.
At the University, food was catered or, in
some cases, prepared the previous night by
union members. Plastic plates were used to
reduce the number of dishes to wash. Vol
unteers and replacement workers staffed
some normally unionized positions.
Administrators roamed dining halls to
speak with students and answer questions
about the strike. Some dining facilities were
closed for the day, hut the University
offered extended hours at those that
remained open. Students were sent
multiple e-mails with details on the
changed hours and locations.
While some marched to support
the workers and boycotted dining
halls, student labor supporters admit
ted that apathy and finals kept large
numbers of students from joining the
strike, and many crossed picket lines
to eat.
"I'm sick of our generation not
standing up for what we believe is
right," said sophomore Nicole Wires,
who joined in a worker rally.
A few dozen students attended an
11:30 a.m. White Plaza rally for stu
dent-worker solidarity. C arrying signs,
they marched to Building 10, where
they met with a larger protest orches
trated by union leaders. Police closely
monitored this demonstration, which
was designed to attract the attention
of University trustees meeting inside.
The Student Labor Action Coali
tion (SLAC) also hosted an alterna
tive lunch at 1 p.m., a celebration at 5
p.m. and a solidarity potluck at 6 p.m.
at Columbae House.
Picket lines were primarily located at
the main gate of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, the Facilities Bonair
Siding Building, the intersection of Es
condido Road and Campus Drive,
Tresidder Union, the intersection of Via
Ortega and Campus Drive and the
fountain in front of the hospital.
"There are substantive reasons to
negotiate," said freshman SLAC
member Ranee Graham-Bailey, who
marched with protesters and boy
cotted dining halls. "Hopefully, the
University will get the message that
they need to negotiate in good faith."
However, some student vocally
opposed the strike. Some could be

heard yelling at picketers from their
dorm windows.
"The University would be stupid
to cave in to workers' demands," said
senior Donald Stevens. "There are
lots of other people who want these
jobs."
University officials expressed con
cern about violence and threats from
some union supporters
"While we are pleased and apprecia
tive that most picketers behaved in a
lawful and respectful manner...we are
also disappointed by the acts of a few in
dividuals who engaged in unlawful mis
conduct," University General Counsel
Debra Zumwalt said in an e-mail to the
student body on Dec. 16.
She said that the Department of
Public Safety is investigating windows
broken and electric vehicles over
turned by protesters on Monday, Dec.
12. ITie University also offered a
$ 1,000 reward for information leading
to the arrest and conviction of the re
sponsible individuals.
At the Monday rally outside Build
ing 10, Department of Public Safety
officers used camcorders to record
potential criminal activity.
In a series of interviews with The
Daily, workers said they were protest
ing for increased benefits, more re
spect from their employers and job se
curity guarantees.
"We want Stanford to treat its
workers the same way the rest of the
Bay Area does," said Rob Rutledge, a
nursing assistant at the Children's
Hospital. "We want to end the Hospi
tal's option of contracting out our
jobs."
"They want to change the pension
plans so workers have to pay more
when they already cannot afford the
cost of living in this area," said Aaron
Dinwoodie, a former Linear Acceler
ator technician who returned to cam
pus to support his past co-workers. "It
was important for me to come back
because I was active in the union
when I was here."
Workers said they joined the pick

et line during the 24-hour stoppage
because they felt it would show how
essential they are to the daily opera
tion of the University.
"I think today's strike will help be
cause everyone is standing together,"
said University custodian Javier Rob
les, who said he wants better retire
ment provisions and medical cover
age for his dependents.
"1 think the strike will be effective
because it will bring the word out to
the world," said Ben Ruezga, a mate
rials assistant at the Hospital.
Some workers were unwilling to
provide their names for fear of retali
ation.
The University disputed workers'
claims that they are under-compen
sated and that benefits are lacking. In
a Dec. 9 e-mail to students. Interim
Dean of Student Affairs Greg Board
man stated that many union claims
are exaggerated. More than 50,000
people apply for jobs at the Universi
ty because of its generous benefits, he
argued.
"In one plan, Stanford pays 100
percent of premiums for the employ
ee and 82 percent of the cost of premi
ums for the employee's family," he
wrote. "Very few employers provide
this level of coverage."
Union leaders say the benefits are
not enough and confidently project
readiness for another strike. A coali
tion of student groups planned to hold
a conference call over the winter
break to discuss organizational issues
in case of a repeat, SLAC spokesman
Matt Seriff-Cullick, a sophomore,said
in a telephone interview with The
Daily.
The labor coalition is putting to
gether literature and a frequently
asked-questions sheet in an effort to
help union bosses win what will cer
tainly remain a heated publicity war
between the University and the union
in the weeks to come.
