## One-day strike brings both sides to the table Workers, University resume talks after work stoppage 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
The one-day work stoppage that more
than 2,600 workers took part in on Dec. 12
could be a preview of a longer strike to
come if the University and Stanford Hospi
tal do not make significant concessions,
union leaders said after returning to the
table for talks the following day.
University and union representatives
disputed the success of the strike as they
continue to search for common ground.
With the facilitation of a federal media
tor requested by Stanford, negotiators for
the University and service workers re
opened talks the day after the strike. The
meeting had no conclusive results, and both
sides reiterated their positions.They agreed
to meet again, after returning from vaca
tions, on Jan. 4 and Jan. 11.
Negotiators mutually agreed to cancel
the Jan. 4 session. Representatives from
both sides do not expect to reach consensus
at the Jan. 11 meeting and more meetings
are expected after Wednesday.
The University has offered a more con
ciliatory tone in recent weeks and ex
pressed willingness late last week to resume
discussions with union leaders.
"We're looking forward to getting back
to the bargaining table on Jan. 11Univer
sity spokesman Alan Acosta said in an in
terview with The Daily. "We want to address
the issues that are being raised. We have
been doing that all along."
"We're optimistic," he added.
Union leaders expressed a readiness to
follow-up on the one-day strike with a
longer one if demands are not met.
"Management knows we are ready for
further action," said worker spokesman
Zev Kvitky, adding that another, potential
ly longer, strike is not out of the question.
"TTie Union is prepared for any situa
tion," he said. "We want to avoid another
strike, but what action we take next will de
pend upon the management's position
when we return to the bargaining table."

The University declined to specify what
precautions are being taken in case of a
longer strike.
"Our focus is on the talks," Acosta said.
"(In the case of a strike,] the University will
carry on."
Representatives of the Service Employ
ees International Union Local 715 (SEIU)
said work came to a stand still for 24 hours
beginning at 5 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 12.
They touted worker solidarity and favor
able media coverage as indications the
strike was successful.
"We sent a strong message to manage
ment that our members are very serious
about the issues," said Greg Pullman, staff
director for SEIU Local 715.
"Other than students taking finals, there
was very little work taking place at the Uni
versity on Monday," added Kvitky, who
called the strike an "incredible success."
Union leaders pointed out that this was
the first time both the Hospital and Univer
sity service workers went on strike simulta
neously.
The University service workers are striv
ing to make gains on re-opened sections of
a contract that is not set to expire until Au
gust 2(X)6.
Stanford administrators responded that
many workers — especially those at the
Hospital — crossed the picket lines, and
that the University coped well with the
slowdown.
While 90 percent of University workers
stayed at home or joined protesters on cam
pus, a spokeswoman for the medical center
reported that 300 of the 500 union members
scheduled to work at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital crossed the picket lines.
Union leaders said the Hospital misrepre
sented these figures.
At the University, food was catered or, in
some cases, prepared the previous night by
union members. Plastic plates were used to
reduce the number of dishes to wash. Vol
unteers and replacement workers staffed
some normally unionized positions.
Administrators roamed dining halls to
speak with students and answer questions
about the strike. Some dining facilities were
