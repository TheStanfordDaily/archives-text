## Brokaw, Gregorian to speak University announcement met with tepid student response 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tom Brokaw and Vartan Gregorian were announced
yesterday as Stanford's 2006 Commencement speakers
for the undergraduate and graduate student ceremonies,
respectively. Brokaw was an NBC news anchor for al
most 40 years and also authored the bestseller, "The
Greatest Generation." Gregorian is president of the
Carnegie Corporation and former president of both the
New York Public Library and Brown University.
"Tom Brokaw represents the very best of the journal
istic tradition and has a unique perspective on some of
the most critical events of our recent history," said Uni
versity President John Hennessy in a press release. "And,
as a Stanford parent, he knows our university well. 1 look
forward to hearing his observations and insights, as well
as the advice he has to offer to both our graduates and
their families."
Brokaw was a reporter for NBC News' "Today Show"
and "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw," which be
came the most watched news program during his time on
the air. He reported on major events such as Watergate,
the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the Oklahoma
City bombings. He also conducted the first American TV
interviews with Mikhail Gorbachev and Vladimir Putin.
Brokaw's books have led to sequels and more than five
million copies have been sold.
Gregorian is an educator and author who has under
graduate and graduate degrees from Stanford. His
awards include the National Humanities Medal and the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.
"Dr. Gregorian brings with him the wisdom of a life
time of intellectual and professional accomplishments,"
Hennessy said. "His academic career had an auspicious
beginning with his Ph.D. work at Stanford, and his reflec
tions will be a perfect capstone for the achievements of
our graduate students at a time of great pride for them
and their families."
The graduate and undergraduate Commencement

ceremonies will be held on June 17 and 18 respectively.
Hennessy also announced yesterday that San Francisco
Archbishop George Niederauer will be this year's Bac
calaureate speaker on June 17.
While there was some concern that the two separate
ceremonies might impact the selection and funding for
two individual speakers, Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to
President Hennessy, said that this was not the case. Stan
ford is holding two Commencement ceremonies on
smaller Elliot Field this year due to the renovation of
Stanford Stadium. The University decided to host two
ceremonies in order to accommodate as many family
members as possible.
"Finding speakers this year was not harder and our
budget had no impact on the selection, although it is
more expensive to get two speakers," Wachtel said. "We
thought it was too much to ask of one person to do two
ceremonies."
Brokaw was on the "short list" of speakers submitted
to Hennessy by the senior class presidents, who used on
line suggestions from seniors and their own research to
compile the list. Wachtel would not specify the number of
candidates on the list.
"We think the senior class will be excited about having
an accomplished high-profile speaker who will be able to
draw on his extensive life experiences to deliver a great
commencement speech," said senior James Mitchell, one
of the senior class presidents.
The speakers who generally agree to speak at Com
mencements have some connection to the University.
The "token" honoraria given to them is small relative to
what they receive for other speaking engagements, ac
cording to Wachtel. and it is often donated back to the
University or to other causes. Brokaw's connection to
Stanford is his daughter, Jennifer, who graduated from
the University in 1988. Brokaw previously donated his
services to a School of Education event in May 2004 that
helped raise $1 million, along with comedian Bill Cosby.
Asked about the selection of Brokaw, senior Adam Edris
responded, "It's like...whatever. He's an anchorman, right?"
"He's non-controversial. I guess, but he's not someone
I'm excited about," Edris added.
"I think it's great that we are bringing someone who
is so recognizable and so well-re
spected," said senior Sean Bruich.
"In a lot of ways, Tom Brokaw rep
resents what Stanford students
should hope to become: well-in
formed about current events with a
healthy skepticism toward our gov
ernment founded on a sincere sense
of patriotism."
Brokaw is similar to last year's
speaker, Apple Chief Executive Offi
cer Steve Jobs, in that he is also a col
lege drop out. Brokaw left the Univer
sity of lowa, where he says he majored
in "beer and coeds." and later trans
ferred to the University of South
Dakota where he earned a bachelor's
degree in political science.
"I didn't submit any suggestions
online, but based on our past speak
ers, Brokaw should provide a
change of pace," said senior JD
Ridgeway. "He is not politically
driven, so he might provide a more
objective perspective."
To select the graduate student
Commencement speaker. Universi
ty staff spoke to a handful of gradu
ate students who were recommend
ed to them by the Graduate Student
Council to find out what kinds of
speakers they were considering.
Wachtel said that Gregorian
seemed to match these students' re
quests.
