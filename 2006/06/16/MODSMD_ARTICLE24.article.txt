# STUDENT OUTREACH
## Trio stops out to raise $1 million for AIDS research 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Three Stanford students who
took the year off to form a group
called FACE AIDS report
tremendous progress fundraising,
increasing awareness and build
ing a grassroots network of stu
dent activists.
Before going to Africa last
summer,the three were only pass
ing acquaintances who shared a
mutual interest in global health.
A Stanford-sponsored summer
visit to a Zambian refugee camp
where they met and talked with
HIV/A IDS pandemic victims,
however, brought them close.
Their relationship soon evolved
into a partnership as Katie Boll
bach. Jonny Dorsey and Lauren
Young decided to stop out of
school to build their non-profit
group last August.
The trio, who will be juniors
when they return to campus, said
their goal is to raise $ 1 million and
get 2(H) schools involved in their
program selling pins to raise
money and awareness.
And they are more than well
on their way. By January, they had
raised their operating budget for
the rest of the year. Also, they
have built a team of 30 Stanford
students to research foundations
from which to request money, re
cruit student leaders at other
campuses and prepare awareness
materials for a big public push to
launch in April. FACE AIDS
chapters have been chartered at
15 other schools, mostly in Cali
fornia. Currently volunteers are
talking with representatives from
dozens of other schools about set
ting up their own chapters.
"Right now we are focusing on
California, specifically the Bay
Area and the greater LA area, but
eventually the team will be work
ing with schools from coast to
coast," said sophomore Clay
Sader, the campus contact coordi
nator for FACE AIDS.
Dorsey and Young said they
are "confident" they will meet
their goal to raise $1 million this
year. They havetirranced enough
matching grants to offer a three
to-one match at everv school.

Sterling Stamos, an area invest
ment firm run by Stanford alum
ni. pledged to match the first
$1(),(XM) raised. California State
Controller and gubernatorial
candidate Steve Westly also said
he will match up to $2,5(X) in gifts.
MTV gave the group a $ 1 ,(KH)
grant. The three founders hope
the snowballing effect will take
hold as they continue to earn
more pledges.
While Dorsey and Young have
concentrated on organizing na
tional support. Bollbach has es
tablished two cooperatives in and
near the village of Mwange in
Zambia. They are making pins
that will be sold to students when
the campaign officially begins in
April.
"Katie has been on the ground
in Africa for almost two years,"
Dorsey said. "She is extremely fo
cused, sensitive and caring."
Bollbach plans to return to the
U.S. in April, after inspecting a
clinic managed by Partners in
Health, the philanthropic group
that will disperse the money
FACE AIDS raises.
Professors and students who
have worked with the trio said
that this is not something they are
doing to pad their resumes. They
saw first-hand a catastrophe un
folding on the other side of the
planet and could not let them
selves go back to the daily monot
ony of class on the Farm, those
who know them said. They had to
do something about what they
saw, and they have.
Microbiology and Immunolo
gy Prof. Robert Siegel, who has
been counseling the group and
advising Dorsey and Young since
they returned from Africa, called
the stateside duo "inexhaustible"
and said in an interview that they
remain "completely devoted to
the project."
"They have continued to im
press me in their ability to raise
awareness, interest, money and to
get other students actively in
volved," he said.
"Not only are these two indi
viduals so passionate about what
they are doing, but they also have
such great presence, and great per
sonalities too," said junior Wilson
Irungu, the corporate fundraiser for
the group. "They are both so modest
and focused on achieving their mis
sion that I sometimes wonder if they
ever reflect on the grandness of their
mission â€” they are saving lives."
"FACE AIDS is not your typical
student group." Sader said. "Going
from three people with a dream to
2(X) schools raising a total of $1 mil
lion is many orders of magnitude
more complicated than what the or
dinary student imagines when they
think of starting a charity organiza
tion."
Other students said they were in
spired and motivated to get involved
because of the passion and energy
they saw in Dorsey and Young.
"It was their vision, their count

less hours of deliberating, discussing
and planning that has made FACE
AIDS a reality," junior Jordan Loda
to, the director of external relations
of the group, wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily."lt was their charisma, de
votion, and confidence that made
each member of our team jump on
board."
Junior Mayuree Rao is helping
write grant proposals to raise match
ing grants for pin sales from founda
tions and corporations.
"I was motivated to join because 1
was excited about being involved in
such an innovative organization that
has clear-cut objectives in contribut
ing to a solution to HIV/AIDS in
Africa," Rao said. "I love knowing
that my work with FACE AIDS has
a clear impact and target in fulfilling
the mission of the organization."
"Even if I had never heard about
the AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan
Africa, 1 am confident that a single
conversation with Lauren and Jonny
would have transformed me into an
activist almost immediately," Lodato

added. "They are that inspirational."
Originally, the group had planned
to make small grants to community
organizations in Africa, but Dorsey
said FACE AIDS recognized it was
not feasible to personally distribute
the money. So they teamed up with
Partners in Health, a renowned glob
al heath non-profit organization as
sociated with Harvard Medical
School.
"Partners in Health is the best or
ganization fighting AIDS in Africa,"
Dorsey said, pointing to the perks of
low overhead administrative costs
and a focus on making clinics more
self-sustainable.
The students contend that the
best way to prevent the spread of the
disease is to treat it.This has multiple
benefits: it decreases the social stig
ma, encourages those at risk to get
tested and helps deal with other
medical maladies.

Three Stanford students who
took the year off to form a group
called FACE AIDS report
tremendous progress fundraising,
increasing awareness and build
ing a grassroots network of stu
dent activists.
Before going to Africa last
summer,the three were only pass
ing acquaintances who shared a
mutual interest in global health.
A Stanford-sponsored summer
visit to a Zambian refugee camp
where they met and talked with
HIV/A IDS pandemic victims,
however, brought them close.
Their relationship soon evolved
into a partnership as Katie Boll
bach. Jonny Dorsey and Lauren
Young decided to stop out of
school to build their non-profit
group last August.
The trio, who will be juniors
when they return to campus, said
their goal is to raise $ 1 million and
get 2(H) schools involved in their
program selling pins to raise
money and awareness.
And they are more than well
on their way. By January, they had
raised their operating budget for
the rest of the year. Also, they
have built a team of 30 Stanford
students to research foundations
from which to request money, re
cruit student leaders at other
campuses and prepare awareness
materials for a big public push to
launch in April. FACE AIDS
chapters have been chartered at
15 other schools, mostly in Cali
fornia. Currently volunteers are
talking with representatives from
dozens of other schools about set
ting up their own chapters.
"Right now we are focusing on
California, specifically the Bay
Area and the greater LA area, but
eventually the team will be work
ing with schools from coast to
coast," said sophomore Clay
Sader, the campus contact coordi
nator for FACE AIDS.
Dorsey and Young said they
are "confident" they will meet
their goal to raise $1 million this
year. They havetirranced enough
matching grants to offer a three
to-one match at everv school.

Sterling Stamos, an area invest
ment firm run by Stanford alum
ni. pledged to match the first
$1(),(XM) raised. California State
Controller and gubernatorial
candidate Steve Westly also said
he will match up to $2,5(X) in gifts.
MTV gave the group a $ 1 ,(KH)
grant. The three founders hope
the snowballing effect will take
hold as they continue to earn
more pledges.
While Dorsey and Young have
concentrated on organizing na
tional support. Bollbach has es
tablished two cooperatives in and
near the village of Mwange in
Zambia. They are making pins
that will be sold to students when
the campaign officially begins in
April.
"Katie has been on the ground
in Africa for almost two years,"
Dorsey said. "She is extremely fo
cused, sensitive and caring."
Bollbach plans to return to the
U.S. in April, after inspecting a
clinic managed by Partners in
Health, the philanthropic group
that will disperse the money
FACE AIDS raises.
Professors and students who
have worked with the trio said
that this is not something they are
doing to pad their resumes. They
saw first-hand a catastrophe un
folding on the other side of the
planet and could not let them
selves go back to the daily monot
ony of class on the Farm, those
who know them said. They had to
do something about what they
saw, and they have.
Microbiology and Immunolo
gy Prof. Robert Siegel, who has
been counseling the group and
advising Dorsey and Young since
they returned from Africa, called
the stateside duo "inexhaustible"
and said in an interview that they
remain "completely devoted to
the project."
"They have continued to im
press me in their ability to raise
awareness, interest, money and to
get other students actively in
volved," he said.
"Not only are these two indi
viduals so passionate about what
they are doing, but they also have
such great presence, and great per
sonalities too," said junior Wilson
Irungu, the corporate fundraiser for
the group. "They are both so modest
and focused on achieving their mis
sion that I sometimes wonder if they
ever reflect on the grandness of their
mission â€” they are saving lives."
"FACE AIDS is not your typical
student group." Sader said. "Going
from three people with a dream to
2(X) schools raising a total of $1 mil
lion is many orders of magnitude
more complicated than what the or
dinary student imagines when they
think of starting a charity organiza
tion."
Other students said they were in
spired and motivated to get involved
because of the passion and energy
they saw in Dorsey and Young.
"It was their vision, their count

less hours of deliberating, discussing
and planning that has made FACE
AIDS a reality," junior Jordan Loda
to, the director of external relations
of the group, wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily."lt was their charisma, de
votion, and confidence that made
each member of our team jump on
board."
Junior Mayuree Rao is helping
write grant proposals to raise match
ing grants for pin sales from founda
tions and corporations.
"I was motivated to join because 1
was excited about being involved in
such an innovative organization that
has clear-cut objectives in contribut
ing to a solution to HIV/AIDS in
Africa," Rao said. "I love knowing
that my work with FACE AIDS has
a clear impact and target in fulfilling
the mission of the organization."
"Even if I had never heard about
the AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan
Africa, 1 am confident that a single
conversation with Lauren and Jonny
would have transformed me into an
activist almost immediately," Lodato

added. "They are that inspirational."
Originally, the group had planned
to make small grants to community
organizations in Africa, but Dorsey
said FACE AIDS recognized it was
not feasible to personally distribute
the money. So they teamed up with
Partners in Health, a renowned glob
al heath non-profit organization as
sociated with Harvard Medical
School.
"Partners in Health is the best or
ganization fighting AIDS in Africa,"
Dorsey said, pointing to the perks of
low overhead administrative costs
and a focus on making clinics more
self-sustainable.
The students contend that the
best way to prevent the spread of the
disease is to treat it.This has multiple
benefits: it decreases the social stig
ma, encourages those at risk to get
tested and helps deal with other
medical maladies.
