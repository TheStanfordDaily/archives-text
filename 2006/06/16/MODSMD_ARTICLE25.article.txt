## Prof. spearheads rise of bioethics 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Bioethics is a field largely condemned to the back
burner of scientific thought, often overshadowed by
more eye-catching technological advancements. But
thanks to prominent pioneers like Stanford's David Mag
nus, whose daily dealings with life-and-death decisions
with critical patients has received national attention, the
field has recently entered the spotlight.
"[Bioethics] is a multidisciplinary field with people
from a number of different backgrounds," said Magnus,
who has a Ph.D. in philosophy. "We deal with a whole
range of issues in biomedical sciences and health care."
The field has been rapidly growing since its inception
in the 1960s and 19705. Magnus noted that it has been be
coming more prominent in the media since the develop
ment of cloning.
Magnus primarily works with end-of-life issues, aim
ing to help patients and their families cope with desper
ate situations. He estimates that he deals with about 50
such cases a year. He is also part of an interdisciplinary
team that reviews all of the cases in the intensive care unit
at the Stanford Hospital, helping to flag some of the eth
ical issues.
"One of the biggest challenges is grappling with what
it means to decide that a treatment is medically ineffec
tive," he said. "There are cases with a hopeless prognosis
and the best they can do is keep the patient alive for a few
more weeks but the patient is terrified of dying and does
n't want to stop treatment."
Magnus said that though handling these types of con
flicts can be very challenging, resolving them is highly re
warding.
"1 focus on what the patient's values really are and
talk to the family to see what their interpretation of the
situation is," he said. "If people talk it through, you often

find that the biggest obstacles have nothing to do with the
conflict."
Magnus talked about dealing with grieving families on
a regular basis, noting that he is often not alone in his
work.
"I have to be extremely empathetic to understand the
issues so it can be hard to have barriers," he said. "Every
one has their own way of coping. It helps that there are so
many people from other services [in the hospital] all to
gether every week talking about what we're going
through."
Magnus stressed that there is much more to bioethics
than bedside work. Bioethicists publish many articles in
journals and deal with both scientists and policymakers,
getting especially involved with discussing what ethics
should be in research and how to integrate it better into
the research project.
"At our center, people do a lot of different things," he
said."Most people are engaged in research,cutting-edge
issues, and how to impact research at Stanford."
As bioethics grows, more specialized programs and
training have been developed; there are now classes and
graduate programs especially for bioethics.
"Almost everyone my age and older came to bioethics
from other disciplines," Magnus said. "Now younger peo
ple say right away that they want to be a bioethicist. 1 get
about 1(H) emails a year from people asking what to do to
become a bioethicist."
Magnus said it is hard to tell how this new generation
of people who come to the field having always known
they would go into bioethics will change the discipline.
"They won't come to the field as aligned with a back
ground in one discipline," Magnus said. "Everything will
have been integrated all along."
Magnus also highlighted the possibilities opened by
interdisciplinary training.
"It allows you to do a whole array of things," he said.
