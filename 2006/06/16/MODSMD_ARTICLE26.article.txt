## FROM IOWA TO THE FARM Bob Bowlsby to replace Ted Leland as Athletic Director Despite deep roots in Iowa, Stanford's new AD pleased to be out west 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's Athletics Department
prides itself on striking the delicate bal
ance between athletic and academic ex
cellence better than any other school in
the country — 11 straight Director's
Cups speak even more loudly when cou
pled the nation's toughest athletic admis
sion standards. On Friday morning, the
University formally welcomed the man
whose job, starting in mid-July, will be to
continue what some describe as an im
possible juggling act — elevating both
on- and off-field performance while sac
rificing neither.
Bob Bowlsby, welcome to Stanford.
"Bob represents the best in profes
sionalism and integrity in collegiate ath
letics," President John Hennessy said.
"We know he will continue that great
Stanford tradition of setting the highest
academic standards."
For Bowlsby,s4, the classic tale of a
Midwest man coming west and being
successful reached its happy ending this
TUesday, when lowa press first broke the
news of the lifelong Hawkeye State na
tive's hire.
"I have a degree from lowa, my fami
ly has 19 degrees from lowa, we have
very deep roots in the Midwest, and the
fact of the matter is I have never been
able to get a job outside of lowa," Bowls
by joked. "So I'm very pleased to be
here."
Bowlsby stressed that his first order of
business would simply be to listen to the
concerns of Stanford coaches and admin
istrators. Upon further questioning, how
ever, he identified recruiting in the light
of the stringent admissions standards, the
transition to the new Stanford Stadium
and the health of the football program as
top priorities.
At lowa, Bowlsby became famous for
his hire of football coach Kirk Ferentz, a
then-unknown who has become one of
college football's hottest coaches by
turning lowa from a 1-10 doormat into
an 11-2 conference co-champion and
perennial power in just three years.
Bowlsby expressed optimism with re

gard to Stanford football, noting that he
sees many similarities between Ferentz
and Stanford head coach Walt Harris.To
prove his point, Bowlsby said that he ac
tually rejected a position as athletic di
rector at Duke 10 years ago, partly due to
his lack of confidence in its football pro
gram.
"In all honesty, I sat in the football sta
dium and wondered if 1 could really live
with watching Florida State go back and
forth and back and forth," said Bowlsby of
declining Duke's AD post."l just wasn't at
all certain that there was a good upside for
the football program, and 1 just feel en
tirely different about this situation here."
Once a college wrestler at Minneso
ta's Morehead State, Bowlsby spoke at

the Arrillaga Family Sports Center on
Friday about the process that led him to
accept the Stanford opening.
The University had initially contacted
him to ask for input on other candidates,
knowing he was happy at the helm of
lowa Athletics, a position he has held
since 1992.
But as the 13-member search commit
tee's investigation broadened, athletic
directors and administrators kept singing
praises of a man nationally renowned in
collegiate athletics for chairing the
NCAA Division I Basketball Tourna
ment Committee and sitting on the U.S.
Olympic Committee. Above all though,
they praised Bowlsby for leading the
least populous Big Ten school to region

aland national prominence in major
sports — most notably football, men's
and women's basketball and wrestling —
without the scandal that has plagued sim
ilarly successful programs.
Intrigued. Stanford offered Bowlsby
an on-campus interview. And,despite re
buffing other schools' requests over the
years, Bowlsby decided to accept this
offer, adding that Stanford's location,"its
extraordinary academic profile, the
championships that are won every year"
and the fact that he trusted news of the
interview not to leak enticed him.
"Stanford is the only place I would
have considered going and 1 say that in
all sincerity," said Bowlsby. "It is a place
that I have admired for many years. It is a
place where athletic excellence and aca
demic excellence are not mutually exclu
sive, and it is a model for intercollegiate
athletics for all who care to look around
the country."
Once on campus, Bowlsby demon
strated the values that the position de
mands, but the depth of his knowledge
proved the distinguishing factor in a pool
of applicants that numbered between 50
and 100, according to Provost John
Etchemendy.
Even so, Stanford might still be search
ing for an AD if Bowlsby were not, in his
words, an "empty nester."The youngest of
his four children starts college at lowa this
fall, and he said that made it much easier
for him to decide to move across the coun
try. He added that he will live on campus
at Stanford because of the high real estate
prices in the area.
But Bowlsby didn't fly out just to
meet and greet the press. After the 20-
minute conference, he spent the rest of
his day at Stanford meeting with key
coaches and University officials, before
flying back to lowa on Saturday
At the press conference, interim AD
Bill Walsh sat sandwiched between
Bowlsby's wife Candice and Coach Har
ris in the front row. Bowlsby met with
both men later in the day, and Walsh an
nounced that he will stay on at Stanford
for another year as a consultant, at
Bowlsby's request.
Several high-profile head coaches at
tended the press conference, while out
going AD Ted Leland sat quietly in the
back.

all certain that there was a good upside for
the football program, and 1 just feel en
tirely different about this situation here."
Once a college wrestler at Minneso
ta's Morehead State, Bowlsby spoke at

the Arrillaga Family Sports Center on
Friday about the process that led him to
accept the Stanford opening.
The University had initially contacted
him to ask for input on other candidates,
knowing he was happy at the helm of
lowa Athletics, a position he has held
since 1992.
But as the 13-member search commit
tee's investigation broadened, athletic
directors and administrators kept singing
praises of a man nationally renowned in
collegiate athletics for chairing the
NCAA Division I Basketball Tourna
ment Committee and sitting on the U.S.
Olympic Committee. Above all though,
they praised Bowlsby for leading the
least populous Big Ten school to region

aland national prominence in major
sports — most notably football, men's
and women's basketball and wrestling —
without the scandal that has plagued sim
ilarly successful programs.
Intrigued. Stanford offered Bowlsby
an on-campus interview. And,despite re
buffing other schools' requests over the
years, Bowlsby decided to accept this
offer, adding that Stanford's location,"its
extraordinary academic profile, the
championships that are won every year"
and the fact that he trusted news of the
interview not to leak enticed him.
"Stanford is the only place I would
have considered going and 1 say that in
all sincerity," said Bowlsby. "It is a place
that I have admired for many years. It is a
place where athletic excellence and aca
demic excellence are not mutually exclu
sive, and it is a model for intercollegiate
athletics for all who care to look around
the country."
Once on campus, Bowlsby demon
strated the values that the position de
mands, but the depth of his knowledge
proved the distinguishing factor in a pool
of applicants that numbered between 50
and 100, according to Provost John
Etchemendy.
Even so, Stanford might still be search
ing for an AD if Bowlsby were not, in his
words, an "empty nester."The youngest of
his four children starts college at lowa this
fall, and he said that made it much easier
for him to decide to move across the coun
try. He added that he will live on campus
at Stanford because of the high real estate
prices in the area.
But Bowlsby didn't fly out just to
meet and greet the press. After the 20-
minute conference, he spent the rest of
his day at Stanford meeting with key
coaches and University officials, before
flying back to lowa on Saturday
At the press conference, interim AD
Bill Walsh sat sandwiched between
Bowlsby's wife Candice and Coach Har
ris in the front row. Bowlsby met with
both men later in the day, and Walsh an
nounced that he will stay on at Stanford
for another year as a consultant, at
Bowlsby's request.
Several high-profile head coaches at
tended the press conference, while out
going AD Ted Leland sat quietly in the
back.
