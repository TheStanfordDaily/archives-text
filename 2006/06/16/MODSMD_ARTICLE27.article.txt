## New stadium set to open in fall Anonymous donation will make season tickets free to all students 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON 
Undergraduate and graduate students will receive dis
counted admission to Stanford football games in 2(X)6, ac
cording to a stadium seating plan unveiled Monday by Ath
letic Department officials. Additional highlights include the
creation of premium seating sections that require Buck/Car
dinal Club donations, a series of community meetings to
market ticket packages and a Family Fun Section in the
upper bowl to complement a family seating package.
Through the efforts of an unnamed donor, both under
graduate and graduate students will have access to free
football tickets. Athletics spokesperson Marie Vasquez
told The Stanford Daily that students who pay a registra
tion fee of about $11 will receive a red shirt and free admis
sion to all 2006 home games. The Department anticipates
the steep drop in cost will encourage football game atten
dance in Stanford's combined student body, which num
bers more than 15,0(30.
The general-admission student section will run from the
50-yard line to the corner of the south end zone, expanding
the current student section on the eastern side of the stadi
um. How the registration fee will factor into the price of the
All AXE-cess Pass has not yet been finalized.
Season ticket prices for non-students range from $180
in end zone sections to $275 between the 45-yard lines. Fac
ulty, staff and alumni will be able to purchase seats between
the 30- and 45-yard lines at a 15 percent discount. Faculty
will sit directly above students, between the left 30- and 45-
yard lines in the upper bowl.
Current season ticket holders will be assigned seats ac
cording to the new Priority Seating Program, designed "to
achieve an equitable distribution of seats" between recent
and long-time supporters, according to Stadium Manage
ment Assistant Chris Hutchins.
Seven factors will give general season ticket holders
preference in seating. In order, these factors are: donations
to the Buck/Cardinal Champions Fund; how long an at
tendee has held football season tickets: the number of sea
son tickets held for other Cardinal sports; total donations
to both athletics and the University at large; and commit
ment to consecutive donations, and alumni status.
The Champions Fund is a new arm of the Buck/Cardi
nal Club, which assists with athletic scholarships and pro
gram support. A yearly donation of at least $1,000 or $2,000
to the Champions Fund earns the donor the right to pur
chase a seat between the 45-yard lines. Benefits associated
with premium-seating plans include parking accommoda
tions, express lines at concessions and access to a hospital
ity concourse in the press box.
Hutchins and Interim Athletic Director Bill Walsh em
phasized that mandatory-donation tickets comprise less
than five percent of the new stadium's 50,000 seats, and
Walsh numbered the most expensive seats at just 889. All
other seats would not require a do
nation.
Citing recent Athletic Depart
ment deficits of around $3 million,
Walsh was blunt about the fundrais
ing perks of premium seating. How
ever, he also stated that the revenues
from the premium sections would
help keep ticket prices low in the rest
of the stadium, in keeping with his
stated goal of "access for anyone and
everyone."
Families can purchase four sea
son tickets — for two adults and two
children under age 12 — for $160.
Walsh played up the importance of
the total Stanford experience, hy
pothesizing that a family might "take
their kids to the soccer game, have
lunch at the stadium and then see
our [football] game."
Hie Athletic Department hopes
to create interest among locals
through a series of informational
meetings, held over the next month
from Sacramento to Monterey. De
partment officials plan to describe

the seating plan and answer ques
tions from interested fans, beginning
today.
Walsh said the Department's goal
is to have a game-day attendance of
50,000 in the privately-funded $90
million stadium, with up to 10,000
additional bleacher seats available
for high-demand events such as Big
Game.
Walsh likened the intimacy of the
facility to Navy-Marine Corps
Memorial Stadium at the U.S. Naval
Academy — where Stanford played
on Sept. 10, 2005 — and lauded the
proximity of the stands to the field, a
feature that has drawn comparisons
to Autzen Stadium at Oregon.
Drawing laughs, Walsh added
that "the restroom facilities are out
standing." He also alluded to the
wild finish of Sunday s basketball
game against Washington, saying it
was a goal to make the game-day ex
perience on par with the raucous at
mosphere of Maples Pavilion.
Prices for individual game tickets
are not yet set. Hutchins said that a
price schedule for individual tickets
will be released in July, after the sea
son ticket packages are allocated.
