## Jeremy Bleich: finding calm after the storm 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
When freshman pitcher Jeremy Bleich final
ly returned home last Thanksgiving, for this first
time since the summer of 2005, he found his fam
ily's house in Louisiana still standing, damaged
lightly by heavy waters that had settled on the
roof and seeped through.
The native of Metairie, La. — a suburb south
of Lake Pontchartain and just 15 minutes west of
New Orleans — joined his parents and older
brother as they drove around the areas most
damaged by Hurricane Katrina. The storm had
moved houses onto the road and flipped cars
onto their roofs.
Bleich couldn't believe how much was miss
ing and with a sick feeling in his stomach, as he
would later tell teammate Greg Reynolds, Ble
ich asked his father to head back. He didn't want
to see it anymore.
"I knew it was going to be bad but there's re
ally no way of describing it other than seeing it,"
said Bleich, who attended Isidore Newman K-12
in New Orleans. "I knew it was bad but I didn't
realize it was that bad. You hear about it, but
until you see the way it affects people's lives and
the way it affects the city in general. It's inde
scribable."
Bleich (1-1), the Cardinal's star reliever, had
been traveling with the Junior USA Baseball
Team when the hurricane hit his home state.The
proud Louisiana resident wasn't able to go back
before arriving at Stanford, and, according to
one of his closest teammates, freshman Brent
Milleville, the start of the school year was tough.
"That bothered him for a while because he
didn't have a lot of stuff he wanted," Milleville
said. "He felt he was rushed and he was worried
because his family was down there, his dad was
working down there [because he's a doctor]."
Bleich has sinced moved on and has settled
into campus life with a comfortable niche on the
Stanford team as a dependable closer, but he
won't soon forget the bigger challenges in life.
"You're supposed to have fun with [base
ball]," Bleich said. "Something like a hurricane
Is life-changing and obviously on a much higher
scale. When something like that happens, it defi
nitely puts things in perspective — baseball is
still a game."

Meanwhile, Bleich is easily handling the chal
lenges the game throws at him. The highly re
cruited lefty — who was named a 2005 First
Team All-American by Collegiate Baseball and
owned a 0.56 ERA his senior year of high school
— didn't stumble in the transition to college
ball, saving the game in his first appearance in
the Cardinal's season opener. With a fastball
reaching 88-92 mph, and a solid breaking ball
and changeup, Bleich has held opponents to a
.125 batting average while posting a 0.77 ERA.
"For a freshman pitcher, he is able to inter
change all three of those pitches for strikes
which is the key to pitching at our level," coach
Mark Marquess said. "The adjustment from
high school to college is whether you can throw
more than one pitch over for a strike and Jeremy
showed us from the fall up to now that he is able
to do that with all three pitches."
Bleich is part of a large freshman class of 14
this year, but his performance has made him
stand out early. He has come in to pitch with the
game on the line, and has succeeded, helping the
Cardinal to their current 9-4 record.
While, according to Marquess, it is unusual
for a freshman to take on the closer's role, Ble
ich has adapted well. At first, it was hard for the
6-foot-2 hurler to get ready quickly, but the tran
sition seems to have worked for the best, thanks
in large part to his mentality.
"Pitching is pitching no matter whether
you're pitching in the ninth inning or the first in
ning— you still have to get guys out the same
way," said Bleich, later adding that he is com
pletely satisfied with his role as a reliever.
Bleich has five saves in eight appearances,
and didn't allow an earned run in his first six
trips to the mound. In those six appearances,
Bleich seemed invincible. Finally, he gave up his
first earned run against Fresno State on Feb. 24.
The next day, the Bulldogs handed him his first
blown save and loss in an outing with in three
unearned runs. Despite the blemish on the stat
sheet, his teammates don't hesitate to trust him.
"I've handed the ball over to him twice
[Fullerton and Fresno State] and both times he
has come in and gotten the base runners out that
I left," said Reynolds, Stanford's righthanded
ace. "I feel very confident handing him the ball.
I don't think there is a harder worker on the
pitching staff. When I hand the ball, that's the
kind of guy that I want to hand the ball to."
Now that he knows the bitter taste of a loss,
Bleich's season seems balanced. He focus is still
on consistency and trying to remain level-head
ed, two tasks Bleich seems to have mastered.
"A lot of guys have the pitches and ability, but
it's how you handle the competition in stressful
situations," Marquess said. "And he's proven
that he can handle that."
