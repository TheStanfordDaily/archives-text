# TREE SCANDAL
## Mascot Mayhem: booze bust, suspension Lashnits registered blood alcohol content of .157 at Berkeley basketball game 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR OF SPORTS 
Erin Lashnits, a coterminal student in biological sciences, has
been suspended for the remainder of her tenure as the Stanford
Tree.
Band Manager Mike Priest and Assistant Manager Adam
Cohen announced their decision to Lashnits on Thursday night,
just hours after UC-Berkeley Athletic Department officials
Breathalyzed her at a .157 blood-alcohol content at halftime of
the men's basketball teams 65-62 loss at Berkeley, according to
sources, including several in the band.
"I'm sad to be done," said Lashnits, who at 23-years-old, is ac
cused of violating not the law. but the Band's alcohol probation.
"It's been the best year of my life, pretty much on a daily basis."
Lashnits claimed the trouble started not over alcohol, but
over miscommunication about where on Cal's court she would
be permitted to dance.
"I spoke with the various Cal reps, and usually there's places
that you can and can't goon the court — where I am. where Oski
is, where the Cal student section is — they want to keep these
things very separate," Lashnits said. "(A Cal Athletic Depart
ment employee] told me I couldn't cross the free-throw line — I
thought he meant the other side's free-throw line, not that I was
only allowed to be standing under the basket. So I was out at cen
ter-court, where I wasn't allowed to be, having no idea."
Whatever the cause, Berkeley officials escorted the former
Stanford varsity diver off the Haas Pavilion court and barred her
from returning. From there, the decision to suspend her for the
rest of her tenure was all but inevitable, according to Cohen.
"The decision was unanimous between myself and the Man
ager Mike Priest," said Cohen, a junior. "She knew that she had
been removed from a game. It's not like she argued. She under
stood."
Cohen and Band Public Relations Director Sam Urmy, a
sophomore, stressed that Lashnits' troubles at Cal were merely
the last of a laundry list of problems, many of them involving al
cohol. Urmy said Lashnits was suspended for several weeks fol
lowing an alcohol-related incident during Band Run at the start
of the year, and was unable to perform at home football games as
a result.
"The alcohol-related stuff is the main issue," Urmy said. "The
fact is she hasn't taken warnings about alcohol to heart as seri
ously as the rest of the Band, and that's taken very seriously by
the Athletic Department and the administration."
Along with other Band members, Urmy added that punctual
ity and attendance were also issues, noting that Lashnits regular
ly showed up to games after tip-off — if at all. All told, Urmy said
she chafed many with her "attitude to her position."
"It was the last in a line of small stupid things she's done,"
Urmy said." We decided to take care of it before worse happened
or the Athletic Department had to step in and do something. We
don't want to risk ending Band over something stupid."

The risk that the University would act against the Band was
real, members said.They pointed out that, this year in particular,
the Band has been subject to the most scrutiny in recent memo
ry, all while steering clear of major alcohol policy violations.
Accordingly, Band management and Lashnits alike were quick
to distance her behavior from that of the Band in general.

Co-terminal student Erin Lashnits, speaking to police officers at
Cal, saw her term as Tree end early because of alcohol and other
"small stupid things she did."
"This really isn't indicative of the
Band's current situation or the Tree's
current situation," Lashnits said.
Given the University's increas
ingly watchful eye, Lashnits said she
understands the decision to effec
tively terminate her run as Tree.
"Because the Band is a student
run organization and wants to re

main such, they want to make sure
they're the ones taking things into
their own hands and making sure
they're being the responsible party
instead of having to force adminis
tration to take on that role," Lash
nits said. "They do that in all cases
whether it's some random trumpet
player, a Dollie or the Tree."
Lashnits' term was due to end
when a new TYee is crowned on
March 4, but now the Band will be
mascotless for the next three weeks.
In years past, the new and old

Trees usually split up to cover both
the men's and women's basketball
postseasons. This year, while Lash
nits believes the new Tree will have
to decide which tournament to at
tend, she stresses that the "institu
tion of the TYee" has not been di
minished.
"The Tree's going to be just as
awesome as it ever was," Lashnits
said. "Nothing fundamental's going
to change. The Tree will be the Tree
forever and ever."
And though Lashnits said she'll

miss what she called "the closest
she'll ever become to being a rock
star," she said her time had come.
"I'm so fucking burnt out," Lash
nits said. "I have shin splints that are
killing me and my costume got torn
up and destroyed against Washing
ton when Sixth Man stormed the
court. The only things I'm missing
are two home basketball games
which really aren't that big of a deal
to me. I'm not that big a sports fan."
