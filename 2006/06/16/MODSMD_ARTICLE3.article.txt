## Military policy under fire Law students protest as JAG recruiters visit campus 
### ANDREW BURMON 
Yesterday at 11:20 a.m., two baffled looking
Army recruiters from the Judge Advocate
General's Office of the United States Navy
(JAG) stood in the courtyard of the Stanford
Law School. By 11:45 a.m., the courtyard was
filled with 60 protesters, some in camouflage,
others in collared shirts, their mouths shut with
duct tape saying "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." The
protesters marched in a wide circle and shout
ed slogans.
"What do we want?" yelled one protester.
"Equality," responded the rest.
"When do we want it?"
"Now."
The demonstration, which was organized
by OUTLAW, a group of law students headed
by two second year students. Spencer Jones
and Michael Angelo, was aimed at protesting
the Army's LGBT policy, the Solomon
Amendment and what they perceive as the
University's failure to take a stand against the
amendment.
The Solomon Amendment, which origi
nally passed in Congress in 1997, allows the

federal government to withhold funding
from universities that do not allow the army
to recruit.The situation is complicated by the
army's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, which
dictates that open homosexuality can he
grounds for discharge from the service. At
many institutions of higher learning, includ
ing Stanford Law School, a non-discriminato
ry recruitment policy is in place which dic
tates that no employer can recruit on campus
if that employer discriminates based on "age,
religion, disability, ethnic background, na
tional origin, gender, race, sexual orientation
or veteran status."
The issue of JAG recruitment did not come
to a head before this year because of the Law
School's policy that at least five students must
show an interest in a recruiter in order for that
recruiter to interview on campus. Even after
obtaining interest from five students, the re
cruiters' presence was only tolerated because
of the Solomon Amendment.
University policy — also protested —
states that no employer can be "illegally" dis
criminatory. The military's policy to "discharge
members who engage in homosexual con
duct," constitutes legal discrimination.
