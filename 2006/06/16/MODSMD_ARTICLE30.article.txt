# Three-peat, tennis love

### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
I sat down to write this column
about all of Stanford women's ten
nis' extraordinary accomplishments
over the years. I could throw a lot of
pretty mind-boggling statistics at you
— Stanford has won 15 of the 25
NCAA women's tennis champi
onships; the team is 30-0 on the sea
son and 86-0 stretching back to the
2003 NCAA finals match; the team
hasn't lost at home since Feb. 27,
1999 — no matter which way you
slice it, the women's tennis team is an
absolute beast, a true sports dynasty.
But anyone could give you those
numbers.They're easily accessible on
line, and every GoStanford press re
lease about the team includes some
new stat. What I'm in a unique posi
tion to offer, however, is insight into
what truly makes this team remark
able, what makes it tick and why it is
so much bigger and more special than
the numbers could begin to suggest.
This team has heart.
Bear with me here. I may be a bit
sappy, having just watched some of
my closest friends win a third
straight national championship at
the close of our senior year. But the
numerous feats of the team bear wit
ness to the spirit and resolve of Car
dinal women's tennis.
How else to explain yesterday's
compelling comeback by the top
ranked doubles team of Alice Barnes
and Anne Yelsey? Though Yelsey
was too injured to play singles, she
stuck it out for doubles, knowing how
crucial that doubles point has been in
the past for the Card. The pair was
down 3-7, but then won six straight
games to clinch the doubles point for
the team. That's heart.
How else to explain that Amber
Liu, down 2-5 in her second set after
dropping her first yesterday, stead
fastly refused to relinquish her
match? With her neighboring team
mates on courts two and three, both
a game away from clinching the
NCAA title, she held on fiercely, if
ultimately unsuccessfully. You could
see the determination in her eyes.
From the beginning of her freshman
year, she has epitomized grit. This is,
after all, the girl who won the NCAA
singles title her freshman and sopho
more years.

How else to explain the fact that in
every single 'Through My Eyes" inter
view I've conducted, the players have
emphasized that this is the closest ten
nis team in the country, that everyone
always gets along — embracing per
sonality differences (with some
amount of affectionate teasing) rather
than being competitive or cliquey? A
team can have an amazing record and
a legendary legacy, but it means noth
ing if the players don't mesh. I think
everyone on the team would agree
that they were attracted to Stanford in
large part because on their recruiting
trips they saw how much the girls on
the team truly got along.
And 1 will vouch for these claims
of closeness. Fate assigned me a
freshman roommate on the team
who has remained my roommate
every 1 year I've been at Stanford. I've
watched the team closely and person
ally over the past four years. They re
ally do all get along.
But beyond that, and perhaps
even more impressively, they're in
credibly down-to-earth and unassum
ing. We're talking about some of the
best tennis players in the country, and
they never once seemed to question
my inclusion in team events. Even as a
freshman, I was always welcome at
dinners, Yumi Yogurt runs and movie
nights with the team. They organized
and co-hosted a surprise birthday
party for me last year — and even
alums showed up. In fact, the entire
team always shows up to my birthday
party. And yet, if I marvel to one of
them about what an amazing player
she is, she will invariably shrug it off
and change the subject.
I don't think this modesty and
generosity is necessarily unique to
the women's team. I do think it's a
credit to Stanford Athletics that our
athletes are by and large just another
one of us Stanford students. But
these women are Stanford students
who win national titles year after
year. And that is a credit to their su
perlative coaching staff of Lele
Forood, Frankie Brennan and Julie
Scott-Thu — and their heart.
So Nuge, Megan, Lejla, Whit, Seal,
T, Anne, Amber, Jess, A 1 and Jo —
congratulations. You are all excep
tional people and you deserve this.
I love you girls.
