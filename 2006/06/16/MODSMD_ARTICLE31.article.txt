## Elite Eight woes continue for Cardinal Last-second trey negated by foul as Stanford women's season ends short of Final Four again 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITERS 
The season came to an abrupt end for the
women's basketball team last weekend in San
Antonio. Though they made it as far as the re
gional final, the Cardinal lost their Final Four bid
in the last 11.5 seconds against LSU.
Down 60-59, sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins got the pass in and sprinted down the court,
passing to senior guard Krista Rappahahn in the
right corner. Rappahahn made the three-pointer
and it looked like the Card were in business. The
illusion only lasted a brief moment as a foul was
called on Wiggins for a charge into LSU senior
guard Seimone Augustus, negating the shot. Au
gustus sunk two free throws, sealing the Tigers'
win, 62-59, and the Cardinal's third-straight year
falling just one game short of the Final Four.
For Wiggins, out of those 11.5 seconds, it came
down to one.
"I knew [Augustus awaiting the charge] was
coming. We run that play all the time," she said.
"It was just too late. Just one second — one sec
ond and the pass would've been there."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer and the rest of
the Cardinal were surprised by the controversial
call in the final seconds, but agreed that it was not
the deciding factor in the game's outcome.
"I'm really proud of our team and how well we
competed, and the plays that we made," Van-
Derveer said. "It just came down to some execu
tion. I think we had a great last shot, and it went
in, but we need to improve on execution through
out the game."
Stanford and LSU had been back and forth in

the first half, but the Cardinal started off the sec
ond with a 28-23 lead. A stepped-up LSU defense
bogged the Card down and the Tigers went on a
14-2 run to take the lead, 41-35, with 12:54 left in
the game. Wiggins helped regain Stanford's ad
vantage, only to see her team fall behind again,
struggling to capture the win in those final, fate
ful seconds.
Stanford gave away easy rebounds and bas
kets, especially to sophomore guard Erica White,
who fooled the Cardinal with her height and
proved a strong, quick presence on the court. She
contributed eight of the Tigers' lead-grabbing
points, and had 14 on the game.
The Cardinal also had to deal with Augustus,
who was named Most Outstanding Player for the
Regional All-Tournament Team. Stanford at
tempted to double-team her — a strategy that
worked against Oklahoma's Courtney Paris two
days prior — but was unsuccessful.
In the regional semifinal, Stanford surprised
the No. 2-seeded Sooners, both offensively and
defensively. The Cardinal began the game on a 9-
0 run, and led the whole way to an 88-74 victory.
Junior center Brooke Smith led the offensive
charge with a career-high 35 points, besting her 26
at UCLA earlier this season. She was 14 for 16
from the field.
"There's no other post player in the country
I'd rather have on my team than Brooke," Wig
gins said. "It makes me happy to see her playing
her best, and I'm glad the whole nation got to see
what we see every day in practice and what a
great player she is."
Smith was humble about her career mark, de
spite praise from her teammates and Van-
Derveer's constant cries to "Give the ball to
Brooke."
"My teammates did a great job of finding me
when I was open, and my shots were just drop
ping," Smith said.
Paris, the record-breaking Oklahoma fresh
man, was locked up by Stanford's tight double
teaming rotation throughout the game.

"We wanted to be a presence in there and ba
sically make her work for everything she gets,"
junior center Kristen Newlin said. "A great play
er like her we're not going to shut down, but we
could contain her."
And the Cardinal did, holding Paris to just
eight points in the first half. Although the star
post ended up with 26 points after a second
round surge, Stanford was able to fend off the
Sooners, maintaining a lead of at least six points,
and as many as 19.
In the previous second round of the tourna
ment in Denver, Florida State had its own game
plan to exploit Stanford's perceived lack of
depth, but came up short, 88-70.
The Seminoles' bench outscored the Cardi
nal's 32-6, but Wiggins' 34 points and Smith's 22,
along with contributions from other starters, kept
Stanford afloat.
The Cardinal saw another strong perform
ance in the first round against Southeast Missouri
State, especially from sophomore guard and Mis
souri native Cissy Pierce, who notched 10 points.
Stanford had a blow-out 72-45 win against the
Redhawks, shaking off first-round jitters by the
second half.
The Cardinal were disappointed that their
tournament run ended as it had the previous two
years, with a close match in the Elite Eight. How
ever, they also made it to the regional final this
year amid low expectations as the No. 3 seed.
"If someone had told me at the beginning of
the year, or in December, January, or February
this team was going to the Elite Eight, 1 would
have jumped for joy," VanDerveer said. "I can't
say I'm jumping for joy right this second, but I'm
proud of our team and how everyone improved
so much.
"I think this can be a stepping stone for us,"
she added. "We have a lot of people coming back,
and I think they'll have higher expectations
now."

In the regional semifinal, Stanford surprised
the No. 2-seeded Sooners, both offensively and
defensively. The Cardinal began the game on a 9-
0 run, and led the whole way to an 88-74 victory.
Junior center Brooke Smith led the offensive
charge with a career-high 35 points, besting her 26
at UCLA earlier this season. She was 14 for 16
from the field.
"There's no other post player in the country
I'd rather have on my team than Brooke," Wig
gins said. "It makes me happy to see her playing
her best, and I'm glad the whole nation got to see
what we see every day in practice and what a
great player she is."
Smith was humble about her career mark, de
spite praise from her teammates and Van-
Derveer's constant cries to "Give the ball to
Brooke."
"My teammates did a great job of finding me
when I was open, and my shots were just drop
ping," Smith said.
Paris, the record-breaking Oklahoma fresh
man, was locked up by Stanford's tight double
teaming rotation throughout the game.

"We wanted to be a presence in there and ba
sically make her work for everything she gets,"
junior center Kristen Newlin said. "A great play
er like her we're not going to shut down, but we
could contain her."
And the Cardinal did, holding Paris to just
eight points in the first half. Although the star
post ended up with 26 points after a second
round surge, Stanford was able to fend off the
Sooners, maintaining a lead of at least six points,
and as many as 19.
In the previous second round of the tourna
ment in Denver, Florida State had its own game
plan to exploit Stanford's perceived lack of
depth, but came up short, 88-70.
The Seminoles' bench outscored the Cardi
nal's 32-6, but Wiggins' 34 points and Smith's 22,
along with contributions from other starters, kept
Stanford afloat.
The Cardinal saw another strong perform
ance in the first round against Southeast Missouri
State, especially from sophomore guard and Mis
souri native Cissy Pierce, who notched 10 points.
Stanford had a blow-out 72-45 win against the
Redhawks, shaking off first-round jitters by the
second half.
The Cardinal were disappointed that their
tournament run ended as it had the previous two
years, with a close match in the Elite Eight. How
ever, they also made it to the regional final this
year amid low expectations as the No. 3 seed.
"If someone had told me at the beginning of
the year, or in December, January, or February
this team was going to the Elite Eight, 1 would
have jumped for joy," VanDerveer said. "I can't
say I'm jumping for joy right this second, but I'm
proud of our team and how everyone improved
so much.
"I think this can be a stepping stone for us,"
she added. "We have a lot of people coming back,
and I think they'll have higher expectations
now."
