## Painfully close: loss to Notre Dame, no bowl game Stanford falls to Fighting Irish on last-minute touchdown 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
The final contest at Stanford Stadium al
most lived up to the reputation of some of the
great players, teams and coaches that have
been there throughout its 84-year history.
Instead, it was a game that fit perfectly
with the trends of the 2005 season.
The Cardinal (5-6,4-4 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) took the lead in the final two minutes
over No. 6 Notre Dame (9-2) but couldn't
hang on late, as a Darius Walker touchdown
run with 55 seconds to go gave the Irish a 38-
31 victory.
It was the third time this season that the
Cardinal lost at home on the opponent's final
drive of the game and the second time that
they lost a lead to a top-10 team. This loss was
particularly painful, given it was Senior Day
and the Cardinal's last chance to earn their
first bowl berth since 2001.
i "Being this close —it hurts, especially for
the seniors," junior receiver Mark Bradford
said. "Coming in that had been our motiva
tion, to get them that extra game. I didn't
want this to be our last game as a team. It is
very disappointing, being so close and not
getting it done."
The Irish got on the board right away, and
the game looked like it might be a repeat of
Notre Dame's last visit to Stanford Stadium,
a 57-7 blowout. Only 15 seconds had elapsed
when Jeff Samardzija hauled in a Brady
Quinn pass over the middle on the second
play from scrimmage and raced 80 yards for
the score.
Despite the initial deficit, the Cardinal
hung around and managed to take their only
lead of the game with just two minutes left.
After a missed 29-yard field goal attempt
by Notre Dame kicker D.J. Fitzpatrick, the
Cardinal took over at their 20. On the second
play of the drive, sophomore quarterback TC
Ostrander found Bradford for a 76-yard gain
down the left sideline. Two plays later, Os
trander tossed the go-ahead touchdown pass
to junior tight end Matt Traverso.
Ostrander replaced junior starting quar
terback Trent Edwards early in the third
quarter after Edwards sprained his right
shoulder while taking a sack. Ostrander fin
ished the game with 197 yards and a touch
down pass.
"TC did a great job," head coach Walt

Harris said. "He's done a great!
job the last couple weeks. It r I
exciting that we have two quar j
terbacks that have played in
games and that will help us in
the future."
Notre Dame took advantage
of the 1:46 left on the clock after
the Stanford score, driving 80
yards on the ensuing possession
for the winning touchdown.
Walker's six-yard score capped
the drive, but the key play came
on a 21-yard pass from Quinn to
receiver Maurice Stovall, who
took the ball inside the Cardinal
10-yard line.
"I'm really proud of this
team," first-year Notre Dame
head coach Charlie Weis said.
"You don't win every game by |
100 points, it just doesn't work
that way. Most teams would
have thrown in the towel...this
team had composure."
"I was hoping that we could
get a stop or a turnover, like we
did earlier, but it just wasn't
meant to be," Harris said. "1 give
Notre Dame a lot of credit for
fighting back and doing what'
they had to do to win the game.' [
Stovall and Samardzija, both .
6-foot-5, dominated the Stan-1
ford secondary, reeling in over ;
350 yards combined.
The Irish, who have one of
the most powerful offensive at- -
tacks in the country, racked up
663 yards of total offense, the
fourth most allowed in Cardinal J
history. Walker rushed for 194, c
and Quinn passed for three 112
scores and 432 yards, the fifth

worst mark in Stanford history.
Despite the remarkable offensive output,
mistakes by the Irish allowed Stanford to
keep the score tight. Quinn. who had thrown
only five interceptions all season entering the
contest, threw two picks in the first half. Fitz
patrick also helped keep the Cardinal's
hopes alive, missing two field goals and
knocking an extra-point attempt off the left
upright.
"Football is crazy," Harris said. "It is such
a great game and such a tough game. 1 always
go back to the idea that the ball isn't round. It
bounces funny."
The Irish also allowed an 87-yard kickoff

return by senior cornerback T.J. Rushing, his
second return for a touchdown on the sea
son.
"This was a crazy game," Harris said. "It
was probably a lot of fun for someone who
loves football. It probably wasn't a lot of fun
for someone who loves Stanford."
With the win. Notre Dame almost certain
ly assures itself a BCS Bowl berth, most like
ly the Fiesta Bowl. For Stanford, the loss
means the fourth straight postseason without
a bowl — and a long winter.
"I think [this game] will do a lot to moti
vate this team in the offseason," Edwards

said."! think that the coaches will have a lot
of different things that they can look to in this
last season to motivate us for the next season.
I think that these guys will be more motivat
ed to work harder and get this thing going."
Though they never reached a bowl, the
seniors have laid a foundation for improve
ment in Edwards' eyes.
"I believe these seniors have left us some
thing tangible for the future," he said. "I think
it is the ability to fight back. We have a lot of
work to do and a lot of fighting to do."

drive of the game and the second time that
they lost a lead to a top-10 team. This loss was
particularly painful, given it was Senior Day
and the Cardinal's last chance to earn their
first bowl berth since 2001.
i "Being this close —it hurts, especially for
the seniors," junior receiver Mark Bradford
said. "Coming in that had been our motiva
tion, to get them that extra game. I didn't
want this to be our last game as a team. It is
very disappointing, being so close and not
getting it done."
The Irish got on the board right away, and
the game looked like it might be a repeat of
Notre Dame's last visit to Stanford Stadium,
a 57-7 blowout. Only 15 seconds had elapsed
when Jeff Samardzija hauled in a Brady
Quinn pass over the middle on the second
play from scrimmage and raced 80 yards for
the score.
Despite the initial deficit, the Cardinal
hung around and managed to take their only
lead of the game with just two minutes left.
After a missed 29-yard field goal attempt
by Notre Dame kicker D.J. Fitzpatrick, the
Cardinal took over at their 20. On the second
play of the drive, sophomore quarterback TC
Ostrander found Bradford for a 76-yard gain
down the left sideline. Two plays later, Os
trander tossed the go-ahead touchdown pass
to junior tight end Matt Traverso.
Ostrander replaced junior starting quar
terback Trent Edwards early in the third
quarter after Edwards sprained his right
shoulder while taking a sack. Ostrander fin
ished the game with 197 yards and a touch
down pass.
"TC did a great job," head coach Walt

Harris said. "He's done a great!
job the last couple weeks. It r I
exciting that we have two quar j
terbacks that have played in
games and that will help us in
the future."
Notre Dame took advantage
of the 1:46 left on the clock after
the Stanford score, driving 80
yards on the ensuing possession
for the winning touchdown.
Walker's six-yard score capped
the drive, but the key play came
on a 21-yard pass from Quinn to
receiver Maurice Stovall, who
took the ball inside the Cardinal
10-yard line.
"I'm really proud of this
team," first-year Notre Dame
head coach Charlie Weis said.
"You don't win every game by |
100 points, it just doesn't work
that way. Most teams would
have thrown in the towel...this
team had composure."
"I was hoping that we could
get a stop or a turnover, like we
did earlier, but it just wasn't
meant to be," Harris said. "1 give
Notre Dame a lot of credit for
fighting back and doing what'
they had to do to win the game.' [
Stovall and Samardzija, both .
6-foot-5, dominated the Stan-1
ford secondary, reeling in over ;
350 yards combined.
The Irish, who have one of
the most powerful offensive at- -
tacks in the country, racked up
663 yards of total offense, the
fourth most allowed in Cardinal J
history. Walker rushed for 194, c
and Quinn passed for three 112
scores and 432 yards, the fifth

worst mark in Stanford history.
Despite the remarkable offensive output,
mistakes by the Irish allowed Stanford to
keep the score tight. Quinn. who had thrown
only five interceptions all season entering the
contest, threw two picks in the first half. Fitz
patrick also helped keep the Cardinal's
hopes alive, missing two field goals and
knocking an extra-point attempt off the left
upright.
"Football is crazy," Harris said. "It is such
a great game and such a tough game. 1 always
go back to the idea that the ball isn't round. It
bounces funny."
The Irish also allowed an 87-yard kickoff

return by senior cornerback T.J. Rushing, his
second return for a touchdown on the sea
son.
"This was a crazy game," Harris said. "It
was probably a lot of fun for someone who
loves football. It probably wasn't a lot of fun
for someone who loves Stanford."
With the win. Notre Dame almost certain
ly assures itself a BCS Bowl berth, most like
ly the Fiesta Bowl. For Stanford, the loss
means the fourth straight postseason without
a bowl — and a long winter.
"I think [this game] will do a lot to moti
vate this team in the offseason," Edwards

said."! think that the coaches will have a lot
of different things that they can look to in this
last season to motivate us for the next season.
I think that these guys will be more motivat
ed to work harder and get this thing going."
Though they never reached a bowl, the
seniors have laid a foundation for improve
ment in Edwards' eyes.
"I believe these seniors have left us some
thing tangible for the future," he said. "I think
it is the ability to fight back. We have a lot of
work to do and a lot of fighting to do."

Junior quarterback Trent Edwards, about to be sacked, looks for a receiver downfield in Stanford's season
closing loss to Notre Dame on November 26 . Edwards later left the game with a shoulder injury and watched
from the sidelines as the Cardinal lost by a touchdown in the final game in the old Stanford Stadium.
