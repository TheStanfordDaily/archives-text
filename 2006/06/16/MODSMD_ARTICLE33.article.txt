# Volleyball upset
## 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With Maples Pavilion's loudest cheers
this season supporting the No. 5 women's
volleyball team last Saturday night, the
Cardinal could only watch in disbelief as
freshman outside hitter Foluke Akin
radewo's attack sailed over the net and
landed just out of bounds. Game, set,
match: Santa Clara.
Thus ended a turbulent season
plagued by injuries, and thus ended any
hope of repeating as national champions.
No. 15 Santa Clara (25-4) eliminated
Stanford (26-6) in the NCAA Tourna
ment's second round last Saturday, 3-1
(23-30,30-19,30-27,31 -29). The Broncos'
win marks their first over Stanford in 20
meetings.
"I'm proud of my team," Stanford
head coach John Dunning said. "They've
been through a lot this season. It's been
crazy with all the injuries, but we've been
resilient."
Santa Clara's offense proved too
much for Stanford, as the Broncos hit
.393 for the match, the highest percent
age posted by a Stanford opponent all
season. Junior Kim McGiven and sopho
more Annalisa Muratore notched 19 and
16 kills, respectively, while three other
Santa Clara players hit in double figures.
Stanford junior outside hitter Kristin
Richards collected 23 kills while the Car
dinal hit just .224.
Stanford began game four with pas
sion,stealing the early lead at 8-3. But the
Broncos slowly clawed back, forcing ties
at 28-all and 29-all, setting up Akinrade
wo's match-point hitting error.
Sloppy play led to Stanford's demise
in game three. A combination of miscom
munication and a disputed out-of
bounds call ended a late Cardinal run.
The Broncos dominated game two
from start to finish. Trailing for the first
time in its tournament run, Stanford hit
an abysmal .057 to Santa Clara's .474.
The Broncos took the first point and led
throughout the game.
In game one, three Richards kills pro
pelled the Cardinal to an early 7-2 lead
and induced a Santa Clara timeout. Per
haps energized by a strong visiting fan
contingent, the Broncos surged to catch
Stanford at 14-all.The teams would then
exchange blows until two more Richards
kills put the Cardinal ahead for good
at 21-19/1116 Cardinal cruised to 30-
23, with an Akinradewo kill capping
the spurt.
Dunning said he told his team
that nothing he could say would
make them feel any better. Mean
while, Richards' tears did all the
players' talking postgame.
One night earlier, Stanford
scored a decisive 3-0 (30-25, 30-20,
30-21) victory over Nevada (18-13)
in the tournament's first round.
Freshman outside hitter Erin Waller
added a career-high 11 kills to
Richards' 22, propelling Stanford to
.287 hitting. The Wolf Pack's Salaia
Salave'a notched 12 kills, but her
team hit just .160.
Game one saw abysmal hitting
from both teams, as Stanford and
Nevada hit .114 and .152, respective
ly. Early in the game, Richards
notched her 500 th career kill, giving
Stanford an early 7-4 advantage.
Leading by as many as seven, Stan
ford slowly watched its advantage
disappear, as the Wolf Pack scored
four straight to bridge the gap to 27-
24. On game point, senior setter
Katie Goldhahn and Akinradewo

combined to block into an empty
Nevada front row.
Game two proved a more lop
sided Cardinal victory. Stanford hit
.452 while holding Nevada to .176.
Clinging to the momentum, Stanford
sailed through game three with a
Richards kill, eliminating Nevada.
With a 14-4 conference record,
Stanford shared second place in the
Pacific-10 Conference with No. 6 Ari
zona, both behind No. 3 Washington.
The team finished the season fifth in
the national AVCA coaches' poll.
Boasting a 25-5 regular season
record, the Cardinal lost twice to
Washington (3-1 and 3-0) and
dropped two five-game nail-biters to
Arizona. Stanford also fell to No. 1
Nebraska in August.
Despite losing Goldhahn and
libero Courtney Schultz to gradua
tion, the Cardinal can look forward
to a solid, healthier 2006 season.
Sophomore setter Bryn Kehoe
missed several weeks, freshman out
side hitter Cynthia Barboza — the
Pac-10 leader in kills at the time of
her injury — was sidelined for the
latter half of the season and fresh
man outside hitter Alex Fisher sat
out the entire season, but Dunning
utilized different lineups to make up
for the roster losses.
Between Barboza, Akinradewo,
Waller and freshman Jessica Fish
burn, the freshman class gained sig

nificant experience this season. Bar
boza averaged 4.5 kills per game and
hit .306 before tearing her ACL. Ak
inradewo, meanwhile, hit .397 and
was named the Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year.
Richards finished the season
leading the Cardinal with 544 kills,
followed by Akinradewo at 439.
Schultz collected 415 digs while
Goldhahn tallied 515 sets in her split
role. Collectively, the team hit .276
for the season while holding oppo
nents to .178.
And the Cardinal accomplished
what Dunning sees as the team's most
important year-round goal — im
proving until the final day, while not
overworking the players. Dunning
also said that above all else, the Cardi
nal gained crucial experience when
persevering through the tough times.
"I am proud of the moments
when our team showed heart, the
moments our team showed pride
and the moments they were willing
to sacrifice and give," Dunning said.
"At Cal, [Barboza] got hurt, and the
team turned around and won the
match anyway. That showed a lot of
character. Our team has a lot of
heart, and they grew up a lot on the
court this season. That will pay off a
lot in the future, both in next season
and in their lives."

followed by Akinradewo at 439.
Schultz collected 415 digs while
Goldhahn tallied 515 sets in her split
role. Collectively, the team hit .276
for the season while holding oppo
nents to .178.
And the Cardinal accomplished
what Dunning sees as the team's most
important year-round goal — im
proving until the final day, while not
overworking the players. Dunning
also said that above all else, the Cardi
nal gained crucial experience when
persevering through the tough times.
"I am proud of the moments
when our team showed heart, the
moments our team showed pride
and the moments they were willing
to sacrifice and give," Dunning said.
"At Cal, [Barboza] got hurt, and the
team turned around and won the
match anyway. That showed a lot of
character. Our team has a lot of
heart, and they grew up a lot on the
court this season. That will pay off a
lot in the future, both in next season
and in their lives."

With Maples Pavilion's loudest cheers
this season supporting the No. 5 women's
volleyball team last Saturday night, the
Cardinal could only watch in disbelief as
freshman outside hitter Foluke Akin
radewo's attack sailed over the net and
landed just out of bounds. Game, set,
match: Santa Clara.
Thus ended a turbulent season
plagued by injuries, and thus ended any
hope of repeating as national champions.
No. 15 Santa Clara (25-4) eliminated
Stanford (26-6) in the NCAA Tourna
ment's second round last Saturday, 3-1
(23-30,30-19,30-27,31 -29). The Broncos'
win marks their first over Stanford in 20
meetings.
"I'm proud of my team," Stanford
head coach John Dunning said. "They've
been through a lot this season. It's been
crazy with all the injuries, but we've been
resilient."
Santa Clara's offense proved too
much for Stanford, as the Broncos hit
.393 for the match, the highest percent
age posted by a Stanford opponent all
season. Junior Kim McGiven and sopho
more Annalisa Muratore notched 19 and
16 kills, respectively, while three other
Santa Clara players hit in double figures.
Stanford junior outside hitter Kristin
Richards collected 23 kills while the Car
dinal hit just .224.
Stanford began game four with pas
sion,stealing the early lead at 8-3. But the
Broncos slowly clawed back, forcing ties
at 28-all and 29-all, setting up Akinrade
wo's match-point hitting error.
Sloppy play led to Stanford's demise
in game three. A combination of miscom
munication and a disputed out-of
bounds call ended a late Cardinal run.
The Broncos dominated game two
from start to finish. Trailing for the first
time in its tournament run, Stanford hit
an abysmal .057 to Santa Clara's .474.
The Broncos took the first point and led
throughout the game.
In game one, three Richards kills pro
pelled the Cardinal to an early 7-2 lead
and induced a Santa Clara timeout. Per
haps energized by a strong visiting fan
contingent, the Broncos surged to catch
Stanford at 14-all.The teams would then
exchange blows until two more Richards
kills put the Cardinal ahead for good
at 21-19/1116 Cardinal cruised to 30-
23, with an Akinradewo kill capping
the spurt.
Dunning said he told his team
that nothing he could say would
make them feel any better. Mean
while, Richards' tears did all the
players' talking postgame.
One night earlier, Stanford
scored a decisive 3-0 (30-25, 30-20,
30-21) victory over Nevada (18-13)
in the tournament's first round.
Freshman outside hitter Erin Waller
added a career-high 11 kills to
Richards' 22, propelling Stanford to
.287 hitting. The Wolf Pack's Salaia
Salave'a notched 12 kills, but her
team hit just .160.
Game one saw abysmal hitting
from both teams, as Stanford and
Nevada hit .114 and .152, respective
ly. Early in the game, Richards
notched her 500 th career kill, giving
Stanford an early 7-4 advantage.
Leading by as many as seven, Stan
ford slowly watched its advantage
disappear, as the Wolf Pack scored
four straight to bridge the gap to 27-
24. On game point, senior setter
Katie Goldhahn and Akinradewo

combined to block into an empty
Nevada front row.
Game two proved a more lop
sided Cardinal victory. Stanford hit
.452 while holding Nevada to .176.
Clinging to the momentum, Stanford
sailed through game three with a
Richards kill, eliminating Nevada.
With a 14-4 conference record,
Stanford shared second place in the
Pacific-10 Conference with No. 6 Ari
zona, both behind No. 3 Washington.
The team finished the season fifth in
the national AVCA coaches' poll.
Boasting a 25-5 regular season
record, the Cardinal lost twice to
Washington (3-1 and 3-0) and
dropped two five-game nail-biters to
Arizona. Stanford also fell to No. 1
Nebraska in August.
Despite losing Goldhahn and
libero Courtney Schultz to gradua
tion, the Cardinal can look forward
to a solid, healthier 2006 season.
Sophomore setter Bryn Kehoe
missed several weeks, freshman out
side hitter Cynthia Barboza — the
Pac-10 leader in kills at the time of
her injury — was sidelined for the
latter half of the season and fresh
man outside hitter Alex Fisher sat
out the entire season, but Dunning
utilized different lineups to make up
for the roster losses.
Between Barboza, Akinradewo,
Waller and freshman Jessica Fish
burn, the freshman class gained sig

nificant experience this season. Bar
boza averaged 4.5 kills per game and
hit .306 before tearing her ACL. Ak
inradewo, meanwhile, hit .397 and
was named the Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year.
Richards finished the season
leading the Cardinal with 544 kills,
followed by Akinradewo at 439.
Schultz collected 415 digs while
Goldhahn tallied 515 sets in her split
role. Collectively, the team hit .276
for the season while holding oppo
nents to .178.
And the Cardinal accomplished
what Dunning sees as the team's most
important year-round goal — im
proving until the final day, while not
overworking the players. Dunning
also said that above all else, the Cardi
nal gained crucial experience when
persevering through the tough times.
"I am proud of the moments
when our team showed heart, the
moments our team showed pride
and the moments they were willing
to sacrifice and give," Dunning said.
"At Cal, [Barboza] got hurt, and the
team turned around and won the
match anyway. That showed a lot of
character. Our team has a lot of
heart, and they grew up a lot on the
court this season. That will pay off a
lot in the future, both in next season
and in their lives."
