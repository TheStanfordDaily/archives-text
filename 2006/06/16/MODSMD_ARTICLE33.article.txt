With Maples Pavilion's loudest cheers
this season supporting the No. 5 women's
volleyball team last Saturday night, the
Cardinal could only watch in disbelief as
freshman outside hitter Foluke Akin
radewo's attack sailed over the net and
landed just out of bounds. Game, set,
match: Santa Clara.
Thus ended a turbulent season
plagued by injuries, and thus ended any
hope of repeating as national champions.
No. 15 Santa Clara (25-4) eliminated
Stanford (26-6) in the NCAA Tourna
ment's second round last Saturday, 3-1
(23-30,30-19,30-27,31 -29). The Broncos'
win marks their first over Stanford in 20
meetings.
"I'm proud of my team," Stanford
head coach John Dunning said. "They've
been through a lot this season. It's been
crazy with all the injuries, but we've been
resilient."
Santa Clara's offense proved too

.393 for the match, the highest percent
age posted by a Stanford opponent all
season. Junior Kim McGiven and sopho
more Annalisa Muratore notched 19 and
16 kills, respectively, while three other
Santa Clara players hit in double figures.
Stanford junior outside hitter Kristin
Richards collected 23 kills while the Car
dinal hit just .224.
Stanford began game four with pas
sion,stealing the early lead at 8-3. But the
Broncos slowly clawed back, forcing ties
at 28-all and 29-all, setting up Akinrade
wo's match-point hitting error.
Sloppy play led to Stanford's demise
in game three. A combination of miscom
munication and a disputed out-of
bounds call ended a late Cardinal run.
The Broncos dominated game two
from start to finish. Trailing for the first
time in its tournament run, Stanford hit
an abysmal .057 to Santa Clara's .474.
The Broncos took the first point and led
throughout the game.
In game one, three Richards kills pro
pelled the Cardinal to an early 7-2 lead
and induced a Santa Clara timeout. Per
haps energized by a strong visiting fan
contingent, the Broncos surged to catch
Stanford at 14-all.The teams would then
exchange blows until two more Richards
