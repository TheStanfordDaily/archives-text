# OPINIONS
## Opinions Whitney Sado For my father 
### 
This Sunday, Father's Day, I graduate.
This boggles my mind. I don't think I
ever really realized that someday 1
would actually have a degree from Stan
ford. This achievement, falling on the spe
cial day it does, seems a fitting tribute to my
father, always exceedingly proud of me
(even to my embarrassment). He's the one
who always pushed me, had the highest
hopes for me, inspired me to work as hard
and be as passionate about life and learning
as I am.
My father's pride for me has been a defin
ing characteristic of my life. Every accom
plishment, no matter or small, has always
filled him with delight. He has also always
been unreservedly supportive and under
standing of my failures, and ultimately
proud of me for dealing with them.To me, he
personifies unconditional love.
A first-generation American, he grew up
in a triple-decker home in an ethnic ghetto
in the most densely-populated city in the
United States. His father was a tailor, his
mother a homemaker. He became an Ivy
League-educated attorney.
Though extremely modest about his
drive and how far he'd come, I knew he
wanted me to excel as he had. After all, he
began to teach me how to read while I was
still in diapers. And he used his logic books
as "bedtime stories," training me to figure
out knights-and-knaves puzzles when he
was supposed to be reading me children's lit
erature.
This hands-on involvement in my early
education demonstrates how he always pri
oritized family. Growing up, he never missed
a single one of my concerts, plays, recitals or
games, even if they occurred in the middle of
the day. There was never any question of
whether or not he should take off from
work. My younger brother and I were his
life.
I respected that quality about him im
mensely, and definitely appreciated it, but I
always failed to fully understand it. Perhaps
my father instilled a little too much of his
ambition in me. Perhaps it's just my tem
perament to be fiercely independent and ca
reer-focused. Regardless, family never really
used to factor into the decisions I made or
the plans I formed. By early high school, I
thought I had my whole future figured out,
and family was not a part of it.
Then last year, I came to the disorienting
realization that you can't map out your life.
Everyone will face surprises that require them
to reevaluate their priorities, shelve their
grandiose plans and live strictly in the present.
For me, this difficult but extremely significant
lesson accompanied my father's diagnosis at

age 55 with a Grade IV brain tumor.
Suddenly, family became extremely im
portant to me. I took a leave of absence from
Stanford for the entirety of my junior year in
order to stay at home to help care for my fa
ther and to work to earn money for the fam
ily. It was hard. Immersed in the horrors of a
home life dominated by a debilitated and
dying father living on a hospital bed in my
dining room, I largely lost touch with all of
my friends — and all of my dreams. I finally
understood what it meant to have family be
your life. And despite the circumstances, it
was a nice and extremely rewarding feeling.
I actually performed CPR on my father
the day he died, there on our dining room
floor. I was unsuccessful, and the experience
was a traumatic and utterly indescribable
one. But I treasure the memory because it
reassures me that, right to the very end, I did
everything I could for my father.
Learning that you should try to do every
thing you can for your family is invaluable.
Last year taught me that family really is
what matters above all else. 1 know that it's
cliche — but things generally become cliche
because they are repeated over and over be
cause they are true and significant.
I suppose I just always took family for
granted before, something I think many of
us do. And I definitely still lose sight of this
lesson at times, but then I remember my fa
ther. Almost everyone graduating this Sun
day has similarly proud and devoted fathers,
who just might be enjoying the happiest Fa
ther's Day of their lives. And our mothers,
siblings, aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins
— all of them so important and so proud.
Appreciate them, thank them, love them.
Don't take them for granted.
My father wasn't anybody extraordinary.
Just my dad. I loved him immensely but, for
reasons I'm now unable to comprehend or
forgive, I never really expressed it. That was
stupid. I hope that if your father will be
watching you cross the stage this Sunday,
you tell him how much he means to you. I in
tend to do precisely that in this last piece I
ever write for The Daily.
Daddy, you have played a pivotal part in
my path to becoming a Stanford graduate.
This diploma is for you — Happy Father's
Day.
