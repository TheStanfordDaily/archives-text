## 27 all nighters and a wet bed later... 
### 
If someone were to come up to me 10 years from now and ask me,
"How did you like Stanford?" I'm not sure I would know how to
answer them.
1 could say "Wow, Stanford was awesome!" Unfortunately, that
wouldn't exactly be a true statement. I could say "Stanford was awful.
I would never tell anyone to go there." This would also be a blatant
lie.
So what do I say? Certainly my time at Stanford has been a mixed
bag. It had its moments where all I could think was that this was the
best decision of my life, which was almost certainly followed a few
days later by me regretting the day I asked my dad to send in the
check with my acceptance.
Part of it may have to do with my decision to major in Chemical
Engineering. I heard the whispers about the difficulty, which in retro
spect were deafening. I didn't really care. If I had the ability to get into
Stanford, I certainly had the ability to do the work at Stanford. Right.
For a while, weekends were practically non-existent for vast
stretches of time. I was more likely to see the sun rise than see it set in
any given day. In my junior year, I kept a tally of how many all
nighters I would pull during spring quarter on the whiteboard outside
my room. For me, an all-nighter consisted of either a) seeing the sun
rise or b) the time being past 6 a.m., whichever came first.
The end result? 27 all-nighters.
Now, speaking to my friends in less-techie majors, this would drive
them out of the major so fast, they wouldn't even think twice. Not me.
I wanted to stick it out. Looking back, that might not have been the
wisest decision, but it's a decision that I defend because it's what I
wanted to do.
This isn't to say that I should blame any dislike of Stanford on my
academics and courseload. Hardly. There are tons of things I loved
about Stanford.
1 loved how I was surprised by Band Run that first weekend of
Orientation freshman year. I loved the experience that I had as a
freshman living in a quad in Roble. I loved Lantana '04-'05.1 loved
that 1 worked at The Daily as a photographer. I loved the majority of
my classes in Chemical Engineering, even if I struggled in some of
them.
But perhaps what keeps me most from calling Stanford the worst

time in my life is what happened during my junior year. The events
from day one until literally the very last hour of the year stick with
me.
It was this year that I discovered a group of people who could re
late to my frustration at academics. My study group was there with me
to look at all the work that needed to be done. Collectively, we could
let out a sigh and we all knew what it meant, even at 6:30 am on a Fri
day morning.
Outside of academics, though, my experience living in Adelfa that
year will forever make me smile. Sure, I could have used a little more
common sense when I poured half a gallon of water over someone's
bed out of anger at a certain comment. Sure, I should have thought
twice before yelling at the frosh that perhaps they should be studying
for those finals instead of congregating outside of my room talking
about what they were going to do post-finals, but 1 like to think of the
whole picture. Besides, who can't smile looking back at a group of
macho guys standing outside your door wearing Hawaiian shirts and
shaking maracas every time you make an attempt to enter and leave
your room?
Those freshmen really opened my eyes to what it was that I was
missing. For the first time ever, I realized that perhaps it is better to
go out and socialize as opposed to sitting at your desk, pounding your
head over that problem that seemingly has no solution. The question
posed to me that year was this: would you rather regret not doing
something, or would you rather prefer to say that you did something,
didn't like it, but at least you said you did it?
Living with all of those freshmen, the answer was simple. It was a
lesson that I seemed to gloss over growing up, not unlike some of my
realizations post-midterms.
So I now go back to the original question posed at the beginning
of this column. What would I say?
I would say that I had a hard time at Stanford, but Stanford wasn't
solely about my academics. It was also about the people. From that
standpoint, Stanford was the best time of my life.

While he may not have pulled an all-nighter to write this, A drian did start
this column at 4 a.m. the morning before it was due. You can mock him
