## Spigots and sensibility 
### 
Rather than write a column
about my experiences at The
Daily, I'm submitting a col
umn in honor of former Communi
cation Prof. Bill Woo, who helped
make many staffers' experiences at
The Daily special. Indeed, he shaped
my time at the paper - and at Stanford
- more profoundly than anyone else. I
served on The Daily's Board of Di
rectors with Bill and was lucky
enough to have him as a professor for
two quarters. Bill died of cancer on
Apr. 12, 2006. This is a column that I
wrote in the last course he taught. It
developed and improved with his
thoughtful criticism and meticulous
editing. Bill, thank you.
(Note: I wrote this in February, so the
information is outdated, but I wanted
to publish the original column.)
In summer months, the cows have
little to munch on in the foothills off
Junipero Serra. As squirrels scuttle
from one tree to another, the sun
blanched grass crackles under their
feet. Heat rises from the asphalt
walking trail, and all is dry.
Yet below, on Stanford's campus,
much is still green. The grass on the
Oval is lush, the red and white flow
ers as vibrant as they are after succes
sive winter rains. Vital to this artificial
beauty is a luxury that many Ameri
cans seldom think about - water. An
average of 33,904 gallons per day is
what it took to ensure that the Oval's
grasses matched the palm fronds on
University Avenue from June to Au
gust 2005, said Marty Laporte of
Stanford Facilities Operations.
About 9,500 miles away from
Stanford's favorite Frisbee spot,
however, water is virtually all that
people think about. Kenya is facing
its sixth humanitarian crisis due to
drought in the past seven years, and
3.5 million Kenyans could need out
side aid for food and water this year,
according to the World Food Pro
gram.
The situation in other East
African countries is not much differ
ent. Hundreds of people in Burundi,

Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia
and Tanzania have died from hunger
and thirst since late 2005, and thou
sands of cattle and other livestock
have succumbed to the dry condi
tions. Eleven million people are at
risk for starvation and dehydration,
and if aid organizations cannot pro
vide food and water to the areas
throughout 2006, there could be
thousands of deaths, the World Food
Program said.
So while people at Stanford will
go through 1 million gallons of non
potable irrigation water - the kind
used on the Oval - and 2.3 gallons of
potable water today, masses in East
Africa will have access to only 10 to
20 liters per person for drinking, ac
cording to the Oxford Committee
for Famine Relief. Some women
must trek up to 44 miles in blistering
heat to collect this water from natu
ral wells and bring it home.
The drought-affected people in
East Africa are among more than a
billion worldwide who do not have
consistent access to safe drinking
water, and the United Nations hopes
to cut this number in half by the year
2015. While most Americans can ac
quire water without a problem, the
UN encourages the United States
and other developed countries to
promote water conservation. As
these countries' leaders become con
scious of water use, water crises else
where will hopefully receive more of
their attention and aid.
Additionally, water conservation
can save money. Stanford avoids
$8.32 in purchasing and treatment
costs for every thousand gallons of
potable water conserved, and $2.77
per thousand gallons of irrigation
water conserved, said Campus Ener
gy Manager Susan Kulakowski. So
while the water that Stanford saves
cannot be transported to East
Africa, Stanford and other institu
tions could funnel some of their fi
nancial savings into organizations
like Oxfam that build infrastructure
for clean water abroad.
Finally, people in developed

countries are not immune to water's
limits. Californians, for instance, are
using more groundwater than is nat
urally replaced, and experts predict a
shortage of more than 7(X) billion
gallons per year by 2020, according
to the Water Education Foundation.
Despite extravagances like the
Oval, Stanford is actually working
diligently to slash water usage. While
there are not plans to put money
from the Farm's water savings to
wards aiding ravaged areas like East
Africa, Stanford's efforts are a step
in the right direction.
The University in 2004 scrapped
4(H) washing machines on campus
and bought new ones that use 50 per
cent less water. And since 2000, Stan
ford has reduced its daily potable
water usage to 2.3 million gallons
from 2.7 million, Laporte said.
Students have also jumped on the
water saving bandwagon by compet
ing in the second annual Energy
Bowl and Water Derby, organized by
Stanford Students for Sustainability.
Between Jan. 15 and Mar. 24, resi
dents of dormitories and row houses
will try to conserve water and energy
by taking shorter showers and mak
ing other lifestyle changes.
Last year, the six dorms that par
ticipated in the derby collectively
saved 200,0(X) gallons of water, and
because more dorms are involved
this year, Stanford Facilities Opera
tions expects even more savings. The
University this year will install appli
ances like low-flow toilets in the
house and dorm that conserve most
successfully.
So rather than feel guilty about
frolicking on the Oval while East
Africans suffer from drought, people
on the Farm can and do manage
water resources at home. Stanford's
efforts may remind others that every
one should take responsibility for
using the Earth's resources wisely.
