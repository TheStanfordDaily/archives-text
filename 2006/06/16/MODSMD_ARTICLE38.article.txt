## Mafia, i.e. Life 
### 
Mafia. That game is the story
of life. It is a game of sur
vival between innocents
and the mafia, with some innocents
taking on special doctor or detective
roles.
You've got the innocent towns
people who go through their exis
tences minding their own business.
Unfortunately, that's not good
enough for the world. People will
take advantage of their weaknesses
and silence. TTiey die.
Then you've got the intelligent,
educated doctor. Poor guy went
$200K in debt to get where he is. But
he looks just like everyone else from
the outside. He can save people, but
he really doesn't know anything
about them. He's gonna die just like
everyone else. And most of the time,
no one even knows he's gone.
Then comes the detective. What
kind of training do detectives have
anyway? They pretend like they're
all high and mighty, but really,
they're just as clueless as the next
guy. If we had access to their special
information, we'd probably do a bet
ter job. We go to Stanford for good
ness sake.
And of course, there are the evil
mafia waiting to kill you. The
smarter you are, the more likely you
are a victim. They turn friends
against each other and make you
question your every belief. They're
willing to lie, cheat and turn against
their own.
Do these roles ring a bell? Are
you an innocent townsperson? Doc
tors are the enterprising ones of us,
working so hard to get where we are,
but not having a clue as to what we're
actually doing. Detectives are the
privileged ones — they have the spe

cial access, but rarely have the brains
to make full use of it. Mafia are all
those people who will be obstacles to
our success. We will hate their very
existence, but it will be impossible to
bring them down on our own.
So what do you do? Whatever
you can do. But being an innocent
townsperson isn't good enough. We
all have to make our marks on the
world in some way or form, small or
big, ambitious or selfless.
Maybe I give Stanford too much
credit, but I'm convinced that I've
spent the last four years with the
greatest people ever. People that
have way too much potential to sit
around and be anonymous. And try
ing to fade into the background
doesn't work. What's the point of
keeping someone around who does
n't contribute anything? You don't
want to be the first to "die."
Of course, the other roles come
with their own sets of challenges. Do
we want to be "doctors" who have
the abilities to do good, but are un
able to make use of them?
To achieve success, first, count
your blessings. At least you have
some expertise. Next, find some goal
that you can work toward. Living
without a purpose is tough. Finally,
seek out those who need help versus
those who don't. Make use of any
clues you can find. And maximize the
effect you can have.
Some of us may find ourselves
lucky enough to be given "detec
tive" status. We're going to school
with future presidents, CEOs, secre
taries of defense, etc. If you are
given special responsibilities and
privileges, use them wisely. Remem
ber, you aren't the only qualified
one out there. Take advantage of

what you've been given, but stay in
touch with the rest of the world to
maximize your potential. You have
the ability to affect change. The
challenge is changing the world for
the better.
The one role to avoid is that of the
mafia. It might be easier to step on
some people on the path to success,
but the shortcut isn't worth it. Do
whatever you have to do, but do it
fairly. Use strategy and skill to prove
to world that you have earned your
place in it.
So who am I to be making all
these claims and passing out advice?
As many of friends can attest, I ab
solutely love Mafia — I'm spent
countless hours playing the game
and analyzing it afterwards. And I
say this with more pride than embar
rassment. I may not know much
about life, but I know my Mafia and
I love it.
But there is one difference (the
only one, of course) between real life
and the wonderful game of Mafia. In
Mafia, you're assigned to a role and
you're often powerless to control
your destiny.
Thankfully, real life is a little dif
ferent. We can choose who we are
and what we do. And our identities
can be as permanent or temporary as
we want them to be. Sure we all start
off in different places, but one of
those places is Stanford, and boy is
that a good one. We've been given
the resources we need. Now we have
to do something with them.
Go play.
