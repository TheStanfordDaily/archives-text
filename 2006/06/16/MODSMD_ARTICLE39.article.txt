## Jennie Broder Reflections of a retired food critic 
### 
Although I have been living in The
Daily's retirement community for
the past two years, I feel that as your
former food columnist I should make a
guest appearance and share with you my
overall reflections of four years of dining out
in the happening scene that is Palo Alto.
Okay, maybe "happening" and "scene"
aren't two words that Palo Alto has been in
troduced to yet, but there are definitely culi
nary gems that I have grown fond of, and
that 1 will in fact miss when 1 bid my final
farewell to this campus.
1 thought 1 would be my generally gra
cious self and recount the adventures of my
fork so that you, the lucky student who is still
served from Stanford's golden spoon, can
experience the wide variety of dishes Palo
Alto has to plate up for you (alright, 1 will
stop beating you over the head with this
analogy).
Since my sophomore year, an important
ranking shift has occurred in my "favorites"
category. In my initial comparison between
Three Seasons and Tamarine, the two Viet
namese fusion restaurants in downtown
Palo Alto, I would've picked Three Season's
trendier vibe to Tamarine's subdued ele
gance. And although I still enjoy Three Sea
sons for its spring rolls (probably the best
dishes on its menu), a few of its entrees
(Prawns and Pineapple, Curry Chicken),
and imaginative cocktail list, Tamarine has
now become my favorite restaurant across
all cuisines.

Where Three Seasons is young,Tamarine
is mature; where the flavors of Three Sea
sons are sometimes a bit too sweet and sim
ple,Tamarine's are complex yet clean.
1 have discovered my favorite dishes
through a combination of curiosity and
friends' recommendations, two very impor
tant tools to keep with you as you explore
the culinary world. Though 1 have never
been a fan of calamari (really anything re
sembling a squid-like substance), Tama
rine's Salt and Pepper Calamari has con
verted me. A crisp, thin coating surrounds
thick bites of calamari, which remain firm
and tender on the inside. Served with a
cilantro-emulsion dipping sauce that pro
vides a deliciously soft, cooling texture, the
Calamari reigns over the menu as one of my
favorite appetizers.
If the Calamari were king, then the Ttina
Tartar would be its queen. Presented in a
rustic wooden bowl, the delicate tuna is
wonderfully contrasted by the cool crunch
of cucumbers and the gentle spice of chilies.
You enjoy this light mixture on crisp won
tons chips served alongside the dish as edi
ble utensils.
The rest of the menu shines just as bright
ly. The mushroom soup has an aromatic,
earthy broth, and in the Ha Long Bay soup a
coconut-milk consomme envelops soft crab
wontons. In terms of entrees, I am personal
ly a fan of the Shaking Beef — a very clean
and simple dish that focuses on the deep fla
vors of the tender filet mignon bites.

Another star is the Empress Rice, of
which I was first skeptical upon first reading
the ingredients: "garlic, leeks, ginger and
egg." To my surprise and delight, 1 found
this side dish a refreshing change of pace.
The flavors blended together so elegantly
with the soft, fluffy rice, but the piece-de-re
sistance was the sunny-side up egg resting
atop the dish. The waiter asks permission
before cutting into the egg, immersing
pieces of the cooked whites and soft yolk
throughout the rice dish. Paired with a bot
tle of wine and good company, a meal at
Tamarine can last for hours. My only word
of caution is to note that the Vietnamese
coffee (a thick drink mixed with sweet con
densed milk) you can order at the end of the
meal takes a while to brew once they bring
it out to you.
My time at Stanford has given me so
many wonderful memories, too many to re
member each individually, yet all too amaz
ing to ever forget. If I can leave you with one
parting message, it would be that the point
of dining out isn't to find a great restaurant
— the point is to find it and then share it
with your friends, and hopefully, create an
unforgettable memory you can keep with
you long after dinner is through.
