# FARM BUSHWHACKED
## Thousands of protesters force President Bush to take meeting with Hoover fellows off campus 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although President George W. Bush was
scheduled to meet with fellows at the Hoover In
stitution on Friday, the presence of more than
1,000 protesters forced him to change his plans
and meet with advisers and faculty members at
the residence of former Secretary of State and
Hoover Fellow George Shultz on the outskirts of
the Stanford campus.
More than 100 armed law enforcement and Se
cret Service officers lined the streets outside of
Encina Commons, as students, parents, faculty
members and local residents protested Bush's an
ticipated arrival on east campus. While the protest
was peaceful, three Stanford students — seniors
Claire Wagenseil, Diogo Pereira and Caroline
Martin — were arrested as police pushed the
crowd out of Serra Street.
All three students were charged with two mis
demeanors: failure to yield to a vehicle in a road
way; and resisting, delaying and obstructing a
peace officer. One of the students was also
charged with battery, according to Sgt. Hilary
Karp of the Stanford Department of Public Safe
ty. TTie three were cited at the police station and
released later that day. They will appear in Palo
Alto Court to answer these charges within the
next several weeks.
The protest began at approximately 2 p.m. in
White Plaza, where 200 students gathered to
make signs and rally against the administration.
As they began marching toward Hoover Tower,
others joined their ranks and began to chant slo
gans. By the time the rally reached the Institution
at 2:30 p.m., approximately 4(X) protesters lined
the police barriers set around the building.
