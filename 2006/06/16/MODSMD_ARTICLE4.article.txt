## Thousands of protesters force President Bush to take meeting with Hoover fellows off campus 
### AMIT ARORA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although President George W. Bush was
scheduled to meet with fellows at the Hoover In
stitution on Friday, the presence of more than
1,000 protesters forced him to change his plans
and meet with advisers and faculty members at
the residence of former Secretary of State and
Hoover Fellow George Shultz on the outskirts of
the Stanford campus.
More than 100 armed law enforcement and Se
cret Service officers lined the streets outside of
Encina Commons, as students, parents, faculty
members and local residents protested Bush's an
ticipated arrival on east campus. While the protest
was peaceful, three Stanford students — seniors
Claire Wagenseil, Diogo Pereira and Caroline
Martin — were arrested as police pushed the
crowd out of Serra Street.
All three students were charged with two mis
demeanors: failure to yield to a vehicle in a road
way; and resisting, delaying and obstructing a
peace officer. One of the students was also
charged with battery, according to Sgt. Hilary
Karp of the Stanford Department of Public Safe
ty. TTie three were cited at the police station and
released later that day. They will appear in Palo
Alto Court to answer these charges within the
next several weeks.
The protest began at approximately 2 p.m. in
White Plaza, where 200 students gathered to
make signs and rally against the administration.
As they began marching toward Hoover Tower,
others joined their ranks and began to chant slo
gans. By the time the rally reached the Institution
at 2:30 p.m., approximately 4(X) protesters lined
the police barriers set around the building.

Protestors refuse to budge after police and fire crews try to clear the street in front of Hoover Tower. Three protestors were arrested
People continued to join the movement,
and the slogans for reform grew louder as
time passed. The magnitude of the protest
ultimately forced Bush to conduct the meet
ing at Shultz's house located on Delores
Street.
Meanwhile, outside the Hoover Institu
tion. the crowd chanted, "Hey-Hey-Ho-Ho-
Bush is here, he's got to go." Another popular
slogan targeted the conflict in Iraq, as stu
dents yelled, "1-2-3-4-We don't want your
fuckin' war-5-6-7-8-Stop the killing. Stop the
hate."
As the protest grew louder, the Sheriffs
Department attempted to clear the street to
provide the president's motorcade a safe en
trance into the complex. When the students
refused to obey these verbal commands,
more than 50 police officers in full riot gear
were called to the scene. Dressed in protec
tive helmets, the officers used their batons to
push individuals back from the Tower.
In response to the use of physical force,
students directed their chants at the per
ceived infringement of their rights.
"Whose campus — Our campus. Whose
streets — our streets," they yelled. "Tell me
what democracy looks like — this is what
democracy looks like."
The struggle between the Sheriffs De
partment and protesters reached its climax
when a fire truck attempted to drive down

the street and was blocked by the crowd. Se
curity personnel were attempting to move
those blocking the truck when three Stanford
students sat down and refused to move.
Officers dragged them out of the road
and bound their hands with plastic ties.
Though others demanded that their peers
be released, after 15 minutes, the three stu
dents were placed into a Sheriff's Depart
ment vehicle and taken away. The fire truck
then reversed and did not proceed down
the street.
Sophomore Nicole Wires described the
fire truck as a ploy used by the police.
"They brought a fire truck here because
they wanted to move us out of the streets, and
they knew that they could arrest us if we did
n't move," she said. "We didn't hear any
sirens anywhere after the truck reversed. It
didn't take another route. It's absurd."
In an interview with The Daily, Pereira
gave an account of his arrest.
"After being picked up off the ground, I
was dragged and handcuffed with my pants
down," he said. "The officer pushed me on to
the ground and wrote 148 on my leg with a
black marker. I asked what 148 stood for and
he said resisting arrest."
Mocking the administration, about an
hour later, members of the San Francisco
based Global Exchange Group drove a
Hummer toward the police barrier closing
off Serra from Galvez. Using a speakerphone
and donning masks of Bush and Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice, they parodied
Bush's foreign policy and the level of securi
ty on campus.
In its own investigation.The Daily discov

ered that the Hoover fellows, along with Uni
versity President John Hennessy, wko had
planned to meet with Bush, were drivui from
the complex to Shultz's private residence. At
approximately 4:30 p.m.. Bush arrived at the
house on Delores. He departed campus at
around 7:20 p.m. bound for St. Helena; north
of the Bay Area.
Before the fellows and Hennessy were
driven to the meeting, they gathered in front
of the complex, seemingly to greet the Presi
dent's motorcade. With this delegation in
plain view, several protestors began shouting
obscenities at the small group and criticizing
them for their support of Bush's platform.
Based on this, it appears that evtfi the
Hoover fellows invited to the meeting were
not aware that the location of the president's
visit had been changed.
A number of protesters cited specific
complaints with the current administration,
calling attention to these issues with colorful
signs and popular slogans. Some stick
ers with the message "We all deserve the
freedom to marry," while others held signs
stating "No one died when Clinton lied,"
"Show me freedom! Protect my rights to my
body" and "Save Darfur."
With hundreds of prospective freshmen
and their families on campus for the week
end, the movement seemed to draw support
from onlookers. Several of these prospective
freshmen participated in the movement. Par
ents took photos and applauded the protes
tors as they proceeded down Lasuen Mall.

White Plaza, where 200 students gathered to
make signs and rally against the administration.
As they began marching toward Hoover Tower,
others joined their ranks and began to chant slo
gans. By the time the rally reached the Institution
at 2:30 p.m., approximately 4(X) protesters lined
the police barriers set around the building.

Protestors refuse to budge after police and fire crews try to clear the street in front of Hoover Tower. Three protestors were arrested
People continued to join the movement,
and the slogans for reform grew louder as
time passed. The magnitude of the protest
ultimately forced Bush to conduct the meet
ing at Shultz's house located on Delores
Street.
Meanwhile, outside the Hoover Institu
tion. the crowd chanted, "Hey-Hey-Ho-Ho-
Bush is here, he's got to go." Another popular
slogan targeted the conflict in Iraq, as stu
dents yelled, "1-2-3-4-We don't want your
fuckin' war-5-6-7-8-Stop the killing. Stop the
hate."
As the protest grew louder, the Sheriffs
Department attempted to clear the street to
provide the president's motorcade a safe en
trance into the complex. When the students
refused to obey these verbal commands,
more than 50 police officers in full riot gear
were called to the scene. Dressed in protec
tive helmets, the officers used their batons to
push individuals back from the Tower.
In response to the use of physical force,
students directed their chants at the per
ceived infringement of their rights.
"Whose campus — Our campus. Whose
streets — our streets," they yelled. "Tell me
what democracy looks like — this is what
democracy looks like."
The struggle between the Sheriffs De
partment and protesters reached its climax
when a fire truck attempted to drive down

the street and was blocked by the crowd. Se
curity personnel were attempting to move
those blocking the truck when three Stanford
students sat down and refused to move.
Officers dragged them out of the road
and bound their hands with plastic ties.
Though others demanded that their peers
be released, after 15 minutes, the three stu
dents were placed into a Sheriff's Depart
ment vehicle and taken away. The fire truck
then reversed and did not proceed down
the street.
Sophomore Nicole Wires described the
fire truck as a ploy used by the police.
"They brought a fire truck here because
they wanted to move us out of the streets, and
they knew that they could arrest us if we did
n't move," she said. "We didn't hear any
sirens anywhere after the truck reversed. It
didn't take another route. It's absurd."
In an interview with The Daily, Pereira
gave an account of his arrest.
"After being picked up off the ground, I
was dragged and handcuffed with my pants
down," he said. "The officer pushed me on to
the ground and wrote 148 on my leg with a
black marker. I asked what 148 stood for and
he said resisting arrest."
Mocking the administration, about an
hour later, members of the San Francisco
based Global Exchange Group drove a
Hummer toward the police barrier closing
off Serra from Galvez. Using a speakerphone
and donning masks of Bush and Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice, they parodied
Bush's foreign policy and the level of securi
ty on campus.
In its own investigation.The Daily discov

ered that the Hoover fellows, along with Uni
versity President John Hennessy, wko had
planned to meet with Bush, were drivui from
the complex to Shultz's private residence. At
approximately 4:30 p.m.. Bush arrived at the
house on Delores. He departed campus at
around 7:20 p.m. bound for St. Helena; north
of the Bay Area.
Before the fellows and Hennessy were
driven to the meeting, they gathered in front
of the complex, seemingly to greet the Presi
dent's motorcade. With this delegation in
plain view, several protestors began shouting
obscenities at the small group and criticizing
them for their support of Bush's platform.
Based on this, it appears that evtfi the
Hoover fellows invited to the meeting were
not aware that the location of the president's
visit had been changed.
A number of protesters cited specific
complaints with the current administration,
calling attention to these issues with colorful
signs and popular slogans. Some stick
ers with the message "We all deserve the
freedom to marry," while others held signs
stating "No one died when Clinton lied,"
"Show me freedom! Protect my rights to my
body" and "Save Darfur."
With hundreds of prospective freshmen
and their families on campus for the week
end, the movement seemed to draw support
from onlookers. Several of these prospective
freshmen participated in the movement. Par
ents took photos and applauded the protes
tors as they proceeded down Lasuen Mall.
