## Bursting the Bubble 
### 
Everyone is familiar with the Bubble —
the relative Utopia we all live in here at
Stanford. Where the big scandals in
volve Augie Galvan taking kickbacks from
the ski houses he tells students to rent for
their ski trips or a fraternity being put on alco
hol probation for serving underage students
at a party.The police blotter every week in the
paper reports that a skateboarder got pulled
over by a cop for running a stop sign. Exciting
stuff.
That is why it really was shocking when
two students were robbed at gunpoint. That
sort of thing isn't supposed to happen here at
Stanford.
The bubble is nice. It is comfortable and
for my first two years here 1 wanted nothing
else. 1 loved the detached world of Stanford
— the yell leaders, the dancing tree, the
open container policy and just how happy
everybody is. In Stanford land, everyone is
smart, many are wealthy and the University
actually rents out a bar every Thursday.
Why would anyone want to be anywhere
else?
In the middle of my junior year my per
spective began to change. 1 began to see that
there are important issues and events tak
ing place in the world that don't make their
way into the bubble. While the student or
ganizing Darfur protests and the Six De
grees Human Rights magazine are noble at
tempts by Stanford students to take action
on worldly issues, what percentage of the
student body participated in those

protests? How many students have ever
even read Six Degrees, let alone written for
it? How many students read a newspaper
every day?
As Stanford students, we are the privileged
elite. We have the opportunity to significantly
influence how the world changes over the
next fifty years. 1 am not trying to wax poetic
about our importance, and I am not going to
flippantly tell seniors to "carpe diem," but
who else is more qualified than we are to tack
le the important issues facing this country?
To seniors: you went to Stanford for four
years — that means something. Make the
decision to engage in something that mat
ters to you. Don't let money be the only in
fluence of your career choices. Don't waste
the time after college clinging to the bubble.
The bubble is great for four years, but don't
delude yourselves any further by hanging on
to it or moving into another one. Don't be
afraid to be political — take a stand, piss
people off.
We are the most politically apathetic gen
eration in the history of the United States
because college is inherently a time to be
self-absorbed. College is meant to be a bub
ble where you are given the tools to be suc
cessful when it's over. And now the bubble
has burst and we must say hello to the real
world.

Jeremy will be in Washington D.C. next year. If
