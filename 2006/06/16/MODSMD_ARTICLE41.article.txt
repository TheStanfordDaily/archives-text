## Making your mark 
### 
Ten weeks isn't a very long
time to make your mark on
something. That was all the
time I had in Oxford and, by the
end, it looked like I was going out
"The Hollow Men" route, not with
a bang but a whimper. I spent my
time reading plays and books in
cafes and bookstores, frequenting
a few favorite late-night haunts

and doing a variety of random
things once: working in a pub
reached literally through a hole in
the wall, once; rowing crew in a
race (with eight other inebriated
one-time teammates), once; crash
ing the family gathering of a bloke
I had met in a pub. once. Oxford
branded itself on me, but I couldn't
burn brightly enough to return the

favor.
The day before I left, Pat — Stan
ford-in-Oxford's then office assistant
and unofficial, stand-in favorite aunt
— showed me a piece of construction
paper with the names and photos of
all the students from my quarter past
ed on. She had folded the big page in
half and neatly tucked it away on a
shelf with dozens of other similar
pages going back to when the Center
first opened in the '80s.
There I was, slightly orange-yel
low tinted and vaguely impatient
looking. pressed in among all the
other Stanford-in-Oxford students
who had been there with me and
those who had come before me.

Only this would remain behind —
my things were packed, my
nametag from my door tucked into
my purse, all other evidence of my
time there had been erased or
thrown away.
Despite generally trying my best
to stamp out any smoldering tenden
cies towards sentimentality on my
own part, I couldn't help but get a lit
tle misty-eyed.
Now leaving Stanford as a whole
looms large ahead, with all the sub
tlety of a ton of bricks, or a James
Blunt song. 'Tis the season to steal
boxes from dumpsters, to pick-up
that coveted '06 license plate holder
and to get ripped-off by the Book

store's buy-back policy one last time.
And as unlikely as it may have
seemed freshman year, when the
possibilities were endless and it
seemed so easy to accomplish the in
credible, what I am leaving behind,
again, is my name on folded paper —
my articles from four years of con
tributing to The Daily.
I tried to leave Stanford early; my
quarter at Oxford could have been
my last and though I was set to change
my Facebook designation to "Class of
'05" something pulled me back. De
spite the variety of metaphors and im
agery I could use here — magnets,
ropes, shackles — none of it is really
apt. In the end. the problem was sirn

ply that while 1 was elsewhere, more
than half of the people and things I
cared about were here.
Including an office full of pizza
boxes, broken chairs, strange smells
and a group of dedicated people
stuffed in those bound editions of
past Daily volumes with me.
Four years isn't a very long time
to make your mark on something,
but it's long enough for something to
make its mark on you.

To this day, the only real all-nighter
Ilena George has pulled as a Stanford
student was on behalf of The Daily.
