# Christina Liebner and David Louk
## Destination veggie post-graduation 
### 
As the year approached its
close,our intrepid quasi-veg
etarian culinary critics
sought out a final destination for
their Daily dining: the 750. What with
Liebner becoming a sketchy grad
student next year, and Louk sure to
return to graduate school in a year or
two, the dining duo figured it was
time to transition from the quaint
humus and ice cream bars of under
graduate life to the "sophisticated"
pub scene of full-fledged graduates.
Given that the only other on
campus bar sounds like a 10-year-old
hangout (the Treehouse? Really?),
Louk and Liebner resorted to the
750 to get a pulse on their life next
year: as they soon found out. not
good — at least for vegetarians.
Though Liebner and Louk ar
rived during happy hour, it was any
thing but happy inside. This pub was
as austere as a grad student's cubicle
in Encina. It didn't bode well that
most of the patrons' company for
their meals were their laptops.
Louk approached the counter
with some hesitation — having
mostly ordered beer at the 750, he
was anxious to see if the graduate
student life accommodated vegetari
anism. At the 750, it is only accompa
nied by a healthy dose of carbs. The
vegetarian options were exclusively
pastas, salads or greasy appetizers.
Liebner, making the most of the
menu, ordered penne with marinara
and basil. Louk, wanting some pro
tein, was forced to violate his own
standards and order a Caesar salad
with chicken, after Louk requested a
gardenhurger and was told that, de
spite the fact that "ten people a day
ask for them," the 750 had removed
them from the menu.
While our dejected veggies wait
ed for the meal, Louk and Liebner
were regaled by the story of how a
very dilapidated and sad looking
plant had been beaten by a drunken

graduate student with a pool cue the
night before. Sweet! Hate crimes
against plants. Clearly this was an
omen.
When the food arrived. Liebner
was busy writing in her scheduler
and Louk was reminding himself of
emails he needed to send once he got
back to his room. Then it hit them —
they were thinking like no-fun grad
students too focused on business to
take time for pleasure.
Liebner set her scheduler aside to
sample her entree — piping hot and
surprisingly scrumptious. Louk, on
the other hand, could barely stomach
his chicken Caesar, which tasted
more like a combination of eggs and
plastic than meat — itself an unap
pealing flavor. Louk tried to eat
around the chicken, but the iceberg
only salad offered little to savor. Dis
satisfied, Louk gave up on his intelli
gent designs for protein and suc
cumbed to ordering both mozzarella
sticks and chips and salsa.
The mozzarella sticks were on par
with Stern Late Nite, giving Louk
and Liebner hope that some things
stay the same no matter how old one
gets, while the basket of chips and
salsa brimmed so full it could feed an
entire co-op.
The conclusion? Though Louk
and Liebner have had some blissful
ly-limited experience ordering food
in "the real world." this was confir
mation that vegetarian dining-post
graduation forces one to resort to
sub-par substitutes and unsatisfying
side dishes.
Alas, our normally optimistic
bordering-on-naive near-vegetari
ans left the 750 distraught, preparing
for a world without co-op scenes,
equally attractive vegetarian op
tions, and a crunchy culture that's
practically de rigueur.
As Louk and Liebner headed
home dejected, they heard a voice
calling out to them from above.

God? Jerry Garcia from beyond the
grave? No, it was none other than
Liebner's fellow J-Ro RA, holding
down the insanity of the Mirrielees
in-house draw. As Liebner and Louk
navigated the sea of anxious future
residents swarming the 'Lees' staff,
they reminded themselves of their
forthcoming private apartments and
the absence of 3 a.m. lockouts.
As the pair walked back to
Wilbur, they suddenly felt substan
tially less sad to be graduating. Nev
ertheless, that didn't stop Louk from
making one final trip to Wilbur din
ing and its oasis of all-you-can-eat
Boca burgers.
So here are the standings, once
and for all. Loyal residents of the
dorm dining establishments at the
bottom of the list have valiantly re
sponded with excuses along the lines
of "you just came on a bad night" and
"it's not really that bad", so don't
take our word for it. Come dinner
time tonight, venture out, make
some new friends, try a new kind of
veggie protein. But whatever you do,
never try a grilled peach.
In the dorm division:
1. Lagunita: 5 tofu, 0 cereal
2. Stern: 3.5 tofu,o cereal
3. FloMo: 3.5 tofo, 1.5 cereal
4. Ricker: 1 tofu, 5 cereal
5. Branner: 0 tofu, 0 cereal (what, not
even Lucky Charms??)
In the "Row house" division:
Synergy: 5 tofu, -1 cereal
Grove: 1 tofu, 1 cereal
The 750: 0 tofu, 5 cereal (the carbo
count of chips and mozzarella sticks
easily surpasses a bowl of Special K
with betties).

Christina Liebner and David Louk
are seniors no longer majoring in any
thing. Despite their earthy roots,
they're about to be kicked off "the
Farm." Yon may express your sympa
thies to them at cliebner@stanford.edu
and dlouk@stanford.edu.
