## The 						nostalgia sets in 
### 
As I'm hopping through foun
tains with my dorm on the
first night of Freshman Ori
entation, I'm feeling pretty awk
ward. I am in my swimsuit, running
alongside some girl whose name I've
forgotten,even though she just told it
to me minutes ago. Ahead of me, my
RAs are leading the mob of eager
freshmen, soaking wet and scream
ing, "Whose party?" To which we
were supposed to scream back,
"Donner party!" I think to myself,
how the hell did they get picked to be
our authority figures? And why I am
running around campus half-naked
with these strangers?
At that moment I never would
have dreamed that those strangers
I'm running half-naked around cam
pus with will soon become my new
best friends. In those hallway conver
sations, while eating food from Late
Night, that run into the wee hours of
the morning, despite my 9 a.m.
IHUM lecture which I eventually
just made a habit of skipping, we
would talk and talk and talk. We'd
argue for hours and hours about
which woman Joe Millionaire should
choose and which he will actually
end up choosing. We'd flip through
the facebook (Yes. the paper version.
Wow, I feel old.) at least 15 times in
one sitting for the top 10 hottest guys
in the freshman class. We'd talk
about our families, our hometowns,
our futures.
I remember walking through the
Main Quad and reflecting on how
lucky I was to be able to go to Stan
ford. It was my Dream School grow
ing up, and now I was actually there.
Tourists would walk by me, and I
would imagine them whispering to
each other. "Look, a real, live Stan
ford student!" Life was good when
you could walk around in flip-flops
all the time, basking in the warm
glow of the sun and watching the
squirrels scamper by, your only care

being what your Exotic Erotic outfit
for that night will be.
Four years later, not much as
changed. 1 still walk through campus
marveling at my good fortune, to be
at the best university in the entire
world. But as graduation approach
es, I walk through campus feeling a
bit more nostalgic. When I reflect
back on my college experience, I am
overwhelmed by gratitude for those
who have helped shape me into who
1 am today and who I will be in the
years to come.
To Stanford, the sum of its parts:
I don't care what the U.S. News and
World Report rankings say, Stan
ford's got it all. Academics, athlet
ics, the weather, the gorgeous cam
pus... But more than that, it's the
unique spirit of the school. Perhaps
it's something about being in Sili
con Valley, but everyone here is in
credibly creative and visionary in
their own way. We refuse to live by
the norms, and we are always striv
ing for something better. Being
here at Stanford, the embodiment
of entrepreneurial spirit, has in
spired me to follow my passions and
vision with self-assured confidence
for which I am extremely grateful.
And don't worry, I'll probably do
nate money.
To The Daily, it's hard to express
the bond you feel with a group of
people working towards a common
goal together. ITiose late nights we
spent in ITie Daily office writing up
articles on breaking news or just
going through last-minute format
ting changes were painful yet exhila
rating. I was fortunate enough to be
able to work with some of the most
creative, quirky, and hilarious people
on campus. It was at The Daily where
I ate more KFC and takeout Chinese
food than I have ever eaten or will
ever eat again. It was also at The
Daily where I learned the value of
process over product, and that the

experience of creating something as D
team was in and of itself the reward, r
To all of those employed here, the J
ones who cook our food and clean *
our dorms, thank you for your hard »
work. Having covered the labor beat *
for a few months during my sopho- *
more year, I truly appreciate how t
your time and energy has con-
tributed to the quality of my experi- *
ence at Stanford. When I think back .
to my time here, you will not be for- *
gotten. Especially the employees at ♦
Late Night, my second home fresh- I
man year.
To the football team, even though *
you didn't win Big Game while 1 was *
here, not even once, I have faith in J
you. I'll be in the area next year, so »
I'll be at the next year's Big Game, J
and I expect you to do me proud. I'm *
tired of my Cal friends calling me up ;»
and saying. "Stanford sucks." Come *
to think of it, my UC-Davis friends *
do that t00... anyway, next year!
And finally, to my friends, a few
inches of a senior column cannot
even begin to encompass our experi
ences over the past four years and
the role you've played in my life. You
were the ones who I had those late
night conversations with that made
me question my fundament values,
beliefs, and identity. And in doing so,
you've guided and encouraged me
into figuring out and embracing who
I am. We started as half-naked
strangers running around campus to
gether. and now we are ending as *
half-naked friends for life running »
around campus together. Fountain »
hopping before we graduate? Done J
and done!
I hate to end this column, much as *
I hate to leave Stanford. But all good *
things must come to an end. So »
farewell, and thank you for a truly *
amazing four years.
