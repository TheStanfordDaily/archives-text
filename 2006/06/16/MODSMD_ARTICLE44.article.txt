## Jessica Peters The 						wonder of sports 
### 
If you count the hours I've spent at
the office, at Sunken Diamond,
and in my room slaving on my
computer, it is entirely possible that
I've spent more time working for The
Daily than I have spent on school
(Don't tell my parents). And now, at
the end of it all, I almost wonder
what on earth I was thinking.
It's not like my work at The Daily
was all that important to the greater
community. I was a sportswriter, for
Pete's sake. The other sections at The
Daily race around madly every night,
covering important issues and chas
ing down "sources," or whatever. The
sportswriters turn on ESPN, grab a
beer, and start talking trash on each
other's fantasy football teams. (This
year my boyfriend, who doesn't work
at The Daily or like football, won our
department's league. Shameful.)
So did The Daily sports depart
ment have some contribution to
Stanford? In retrospect, I hope our
contribution was that we were a hu
manizing force on a campus full of
superhumans.
Some of you don't know this, but
Stanford is not normal.This place is way
too crammed with intelligence and am
bition and talent, and yeSs sometimes
ego, to look anything like the real world.
But sports — now there's some
thing that can bring us back to earth,
give us something in common, and
remind us how to have fun after a
long week of work. I hope the sports

section made you laugh,or made you
want to catch a game at Maloney
Field. I hope the sports section made
our athletes seem more mortal. That
our stories made you feel for once
like some of the best athletes in the
NCAA are a lot like you.
If you're an athlete, especially in a
low-profile sport, I hope we made you
feel valued. I hope our writing made
you seem like a human rather than a
page full of statistics On the other
hand, 1 hope you feel flattered that we
are the only group of people outside
of your family who knows that you
had 28 RBI in your freshman season.
But I suppose that even if the
sports department didn't achieve
any of that, our efforts were still
worth it. And not just because I can
write an article — or a history paper
— faster than lightning. For four
years, the sports department has
been my refuge from school, stress
and boredom. I sunburned at the
ballpark while talking sports with
friends, I laughed till it hurt while
writing stupid headlines with our ed
itors, I got to hang out in a place
where it was normal to be a girl and
know the sign for clipping.
I'm not saying it was always 1(X)
percent fun. There was this one time
we found out our car was towed after
14-inning game in Santa Clara and
spent half the night trying to get
home. There was that other time I
took the red-eye to swimming

NCAAs in Alabama only to find out
1 had no hotel reservations and no
credit card. But now that my days at
the Daily are over and I'm beginning
a career that has nothing to do with
journalism, I know I'll never regret
the time I spent here.
So I'd like to say thank you to the
people that taught me everything I
know about journalism: Arisha
Hatch and Scott Allen. To the people
who made every moment of my Daily
journey fun: Liz Aguilar, Sean How
ell, Dan McCarthy, Alex Gyr, Carling
Nguyen and Rebecca Harlow.
TTiank you to my family and
friends, for your unconditional love.
To my Papa, who is generous and
loyal, and my Mom, who is genuine
and compassionate, for giving me
something to aspire to. To my broth
er Danny, who keeps me laughing
and keeps me humble. Thank you to
my Dan, for always bringing out the
best version of me.
And to the legions of sportswriters
who will take over where the Gass of
2006 left off — thank you for wanting
to carry the torch. Have fun, don't take
yourselves too seriously, and remem
ber (in the immortal words of Jimmy
Cannon):"Sports isn't statistics. Sports
is Joe DiMaggio rounding second."
