## Remembering the good and the bad 
### 
There are two things that I
really learned in college —
how to parallel park and
how to lie, mostly to myself. I am
now a master parallel parker. I
can back my CRV into a space
that a Tercel shouldn't fit into,
even on a massive San Francisco
hill. This is one real-world skill
that I have nailed since freshman
year, when I didn't leave on a note
on that BMW I nudged on Uni
versity Ave.
The second thing I've learned in
college is that, in terms of emotional
honesty, I might as well still be six
teen. I'm told that I tend to be a little
distant and even full-of-shit. So, as
an exercise in personal growth, I am
going to admit that I'm going to ac
tually miss Stanford and that I'm
nervous — crippled with anxiety at
times —to leave this idyllic aca
demic institution/country club to
face medical school and the real
world.
I will most miss the naive feel
ing of empowerment that I found
here. If I could imagine it, I could
get it funded; if I needed it, I could
obtain it. While at Stanford, I had
the potential to do anything. I did
n't have to answer difficult ques
tions about who I was or where I
was going. Being a Stanford stu
dent and being me was always
enough.

The other amazing thing about
Stanford was the people I met. It
still blows my mind that my peers
are this funny and brilliant. Yes, I
know that my friends will still be
my friends after June 18th, but it's
sad that I won't see them at the
Post Office, at Starbucks, at Safe
way, at the gym. Actually, it's hard
to imagine going to these places
and seeing unfamiliar faces peri
od.
But not everything about Stan
ford was great, and when I have to
pack and say goodbyes, I turn to
my Stanford Shit List for comfort.
After graduation, I will finally get
to eat real food, have my own
bathroom and an efficient mail
system, stop receiving prolific
emails about missing laundry,
avoid the Stanford parking system
and get the hell out of Palo Alto.
And, really, being a Pre-Med
here absolutely sucked. It was hard
and cruel, and I wouldn't do it
again for anything. The Chem de
partment actually made me cry,
twice, I got NO advising, and, in
fact, I was told repeatedly by the
Pre-Med office that I just wasn't
good enough to submit an applica
tion to medical school representing
this fine institution. Well, success is
sweet, and so is writing my revenge
column.
But this isn't about trashing the

UAP, and I really will miss this
beautiful, dysfunctional place. I'il
miss getting to act trashy in front
of my peers and the students I TA
and playing it off as "just Pub
Night." I'll miss S.C.O.P.E. like
crazy, and the Firehouse, Human
Biology 103, and The Daily (most
ly Camille Ricketts). I'll miss my
friend crying because the guy she's
momentarily into is "just not feel
ing girls this week." I'll always
wish I had hooked up with more
grad students in college, but I'm
sure people will continue to tell
me that I "have no game" in Los
Angeles. Honduras will always be
incredibly special.
It really is time to move on, and
moving on means moving away
from Stanford. I'm lucky, actually,
to only be moving to LA, our week
end escape when San Francisco just
didn't seem cool, or warm, enough.
So now, I guess, Stanford will be my
weekend getaway, when LA feels
like an unfamiliar urban sprawl,
when I can't stand to watch the Tro
jan football team win another
game, when I need to see a familiar
face.

Natalie is moving to Los Angeles
and needs a roommate who can
cook, clean and gives good advice.
