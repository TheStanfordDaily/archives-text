# OPINIONS
## Barrett W. Sheridan Memory machine 
### 
Ijust retired my fifth pocket-sized
notebook in two years. This one
was the color of kelp, measured
four inches by three, and for the last
six months rested cozily in my back
right pants pocket. The spinecover
peeled off two months ago, and the
Japanese manufacturer's italicized
promise — "Most advanced quality!
Gives best writing features!" — had
faded into near-oblivion. For half a
year it wrangled the wanderings of
my mind and the quotes of my
friends. A sampling of the innards:
- "Viagra gives headaches, right?"
- Ransom Olds
- dog w/ glass eye
- the walls of my memory divide...
- "How many people do you have
to grope to be a serial groper?"
— Josh
- Shopping list: umbrella, blow
dryer, wax
Obviously, I am obsessed with
memory 1 am obsessed with its main
tenance — through leather-bound
photo albums and journals, pocket
sized notebooks, Ninja llirtles action
figures. I am also obsessed with the
loss of memory, due to time or con
text or Alzheimer's, and with its irre

sistible and sudden return after a
long absence.
You probably know the feeling.
You're walking home from the
Quad, iPod earbuds securely in
place, listening to music on random.
"With or Without You" comes on,
and as the bass slips into cadence you
pass the flowering camellias behind
Memorial Church, and the sound
and the scent coalesce to propel you
back to the room of your freshman
year girlfriend. The cliche Degas
print bought outside the bookstore,
the pastel bed sheets, the photos of a
family trip to Yosemite on the wall.
You hadn't thought about her in
three years. The sensation is intense
ly real for a moment, and you pause.
Then it fades and you think: What
a cheesy song to make out to.
But for a moment it had you, and
the bikers passing by had no idea
what curled the corners of your lips
just then.
I wonder: What will be the psychic
cues that lead me, years from now,
down a nostalgic path back to Stan
ford?
Will it take something as heavy
handed as a return visit to Zion Na
tional Park to conjure memories of a
long-ago spring break road trip? Or

will the atmosphere on a dry cool
day, reminiscent of early spring in
southern Utah, be enough?
It doesn't really matter. What
matters is not how it happens, but
that when it does, when the rush of
memories come flooding back, I
know what memories they will be.
Not sunset vistas of the foothills or
the facade of Memorial Church. Not
Senior Formal or film festivals or ski
trips. Not images. Not events.
No. It will be the people.
The sound of a handcrafted Hon
duran drum. A still frame of Audrey
Hepburn in An American in Paris.
Listening to "Hey!" by the Pixies or
"On a High" by Duncan Sheik.
Watching an episode of House or
eating 'soup in Pescadero just be
cause. Reading about British Empire
trade theory. A speech by Alan
Keyes. Homemade sushi.
Just some of the things that will
bring me back to the people that
have made the last four years the
happiest of my life and turned Stan
ford into home. I won't even need a
notebook to remember them by.

They claim you never know what you
got 'til it's gone. I know I got it, so feed
my back at harretts@stanford.edu.
