## A 						few words of thanks 
### 
-1 almost didn't write this col
umn. I didn't want to subject
my editors to more suffering,
since I knew exactly what they
were going through. But as both of
them seemed to be holding up
well, even after I ran away from
their job four months ago glad that
1 had suckered someone into tak
ing over, 1 figured I should give
them just one more piece of work
to do. It's the least The Daily can
give me for picking up the tab at
the banquet.
First, I pondered what I'm not
supposed to discuss in a column.
Dating. Sex. Myself. The process of
writing. The rules what you
can't write in a Oh well, I'm
already doing worse than most of the
columnists did last volume.
I don't like writing about journal
ism; it's too self-indulgent. And I'm
not far enough removed from Stan
ford to write much about the school
(or give any money). Father's Day is
pretty impossible, at least if shopping
at the bookstore for my father is any
indication.
But The Daily banquet on Sat
urday, taking the senior photo in
cap and gown, and pondering the
end of my Stanford career convert-

Ed me.
I could do lessons of Stanford:
How to deal with awkward social sit
uations such as meeting random
people in the shower (thanks, Chi
Theta Chi). How to cook with few in
gredients, and how to put out a news
paper when all your writers sudden
ly "get sick."
I could write all the things I was
supposed to write in my ombudsman
column (it didn't survive my thesis):
The Daily should be more contro
versial, shouldn't get special fees,
and should keep making people very
angry, even if it does screw up the
facts occasionally.
The column might ponder life in
the future: no more daily writing and
no more needing to edit self-indul
gent editorials to stir up nonexistent
controversy.
But. instead, I think I'll keep it
simple and short with a few words of
thanks.
First, 1 should thank my father,
who edited The Daily in the dark
ages (Volume 161), for getting me
interested in journalism and en
couraging me the whole time, both
when I was excited about reporting
and when The Daily drove me nuts.
I have to thank all those long-disap

peared editors who kept ine going,
even when I threatened to quit, es
pecially Anthony who did way
more for The Daily than he ever got
credit for. I need to thank Andrea
for not letting The Daily get in the
way too much. All my columnists
were the best, especially Robin and
Miri, and Whitney was great fun to
work with over the volume. Camille
let all of us live our lives knowing
that The Daily was in good hands.
Wenkai, who wins many awards in
my book, and Vicky have held the
Opinions page up to high stan
dards, even when they didn't have
much help.
Stanford wasn't just k fcbout The
Daily for me, but if it was, it would
have been a pretty good deal. My
senior gift is heading to The Daily,
cause that is one place where it can
make a difference (and where the
University can't touch it).

Michael was an Opinions Editor
and News Editor. He hopes you
found a way to thank all those
brightened your days over the past
four years. No need to thank him for
moving Commencement to a big flat
field (he voted for Frost) at mich
mill@gmail.com.
