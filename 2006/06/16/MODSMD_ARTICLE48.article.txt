## '06 leaves The Farm 
### 
U It is time for you to settle down
and begin thinking about your
future. You have led a very
carefree, idle, happy life up to the
present — the life of a child. But it is
time now to put away childish
things and take on adult responsi
bilities. We would all like to sail
through life with no thought of to
morrow. But that cannot be. We
have our duty. Our obligations. Our
principles."
So lectures Harold's mother in an
early scene in the cult classic and
personal fave Harold & Maude, a
moving about living life to its fullest.
Never has this quote seemed timeli
er to me than mere days before grad
uation.
A year ago in the commence
ment edition I wrote about my pre
emptive nostalgia that had crippled
my ability to do anything. Having ri
fled through old Stanford year
books looking at photos of every
thing from the old boathouse on
Lake Lag to Dean Julie's crazy 80s
hair, I instructed readers to make
the most of every second they had
left at Stanford.
This year, rather than weeping
with sadness, I'm surprisingly calm.
Maybe I've been distracting myself:
I've been too busy celebrating and
mourning the last pub night, trivia
night, late night and cafe night, to
worry about graduation.
Even more likely, I'm not threat
ening a Dido-esque suicide on next
year's Big Game bonfire because I
did make the most of my time at
Stanford. Sure, I wouldn't complain
about having a few more Exotic
Erotics or pub crawls. But I'm be
ginning to understand that when
my '05 friends said they were ready
to leave, they didn't mean they
were eagerly anticipating gradua
tion, but rather that they were satis
fied with how they spent their Stan
ford years.
My propensity for nostalgia prob
ably relates to my innate Peter Pan
syndrome that forbids me from fully
accepting "growing up," but also com
pels me to maximize my time, wher
ever I am. Time is fleeting, after all.
It's probably not a coincidence

that my favorite books are all British
children's books where the charac
ters must eventually leave their
youthful worlds of fun and adven
ture.
In the Chronicles of Narnia, one
by one the children grow too old to
return to Narnia. In the Harry Pot
ter books, after their seventh year
the characters must graduate and
leave Hogwarts (that's one thing
Stanford has on Hogwarts — co
terming).
Most touching to me is Winnie
the-Pooh and the House at Pooh
Corner. In the final chapter, Christo
pher Robin announces he is going
away from the Hundred Acre Wood
(which as far as I'm concerned is an
apt pseudonym for "The Farm").
Christopher Robin explains to Pooh
that he will not be getting to do
"nothing" anymore.
"Never again?" asks Pooh.
"Well, not so much," responds
Christopher Robin, "They don't let
you."
Later, Christopher beseeches
Pooh to remember him, whatever
happens:
"Pooh, promise you won't forget
about me, ever. Not even when I'm a
hundred."
"How old shall I be then?"
"Ninety-nine."
Pooh nodded. "I promise," he
said.
In the end, all we can do is expe
rience as much as we can and keep
those memories alive. Yes, we may
be leaving. No, nothing in life can
replicate college. But with a little
creativity and a strong sense of
whimsy, the feelings, emotions and
memories can sustain you for years
to come.
"So they went off together. But
wherever they go, and whatever hap
pens to them on the way, in that en
chanted place on the top of the For
est, a little boy and his Bear will al
ways be playing."
