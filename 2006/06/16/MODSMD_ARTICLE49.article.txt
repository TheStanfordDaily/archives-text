## The 						Daily: Don't do it for the money 
### 
One of the perks of surviving
Stanford and The Daily is
knowing how to work the
system. That means that I'm writing
this graduation column at 9:35 p.m.
the night someone else is laying the
issue out. My mentor and former
editor-in-chief, Brendan Marten,
otherwise known as BMoney, told
me to write about why 1 love The
Daily.
Basically, he told me to write a
pack of sentimental lies, because I
don't really love The Daily, its fickle
Mac computers or its soul-sucking
power over literate people who
can't say "no" to working long hours
for peanuts.
I love that it allowed me to try
something that I'd never done be
fore. Me, a kid who hadn't even
touched her high school newspaper,
who didn't know what the hell a
"lede" was, and who became co-edi
tor of Intermission only because she
replied to a frantic e-mail out of her
own desperation. I had absolutely
no experience. I thought Stanford
would be this heaven for smart kids
who felt like no one understood
them in high school. Funny thing,
Stanford is high school all over
again. Everyone just has better SAT
scores. The Daily allowed me to ob
serve this ridiculous high school and
participate in ways I never thought
possible. Two words: sorority rush.
The short story is that I thought I
would challenge my preconceived
notions of a social system that com
pletely mystified me. The plan was
to write a humorous yet insightful
article on the way, entitled "Seeking
Acceptance in Cruel, Harsh Social
Worlds." I never intended to actual
ly go Greek. Cue the irony. What ac
tually happened was that I joined
Chi Omega and got the challenge of
a lifetime. I was elected president of
a struggling organization, saw the
membership go from what would
have been 12 to 80, and saw The
Daily get a few facts wrong in an ar
ticle called "Chi O Revolution
Draws TUrnout." I learned a lot
more about myself in the four years
I've worked for this newspaper than
I thought possible. I also learned

how sleep-deprived editors end up
rolling on the floor at 3 a.m., crack
ing up over really terrible white rap
pers who cover "In Da Club."
Thanks, Tim
I'm the queen of non-sequiturs.
So let's take a detour, shall we? If
the class of 2006 were to play a gi
gantic game of hide-and-seek to
gether, it would go something like
this (I'm going to make some hu
morous generalizations right now,
so don't send me angry e-mails):
The Economics majors would
analyze the opportunity cost of hid
ing spot versus what potential bene
fits winning would offer.They would
give up after 10 minutes and invest
their time elsewhere.
Political Science majors wouldn't
hide - they would argue over
whether or not it was constitutional
to even play the game, and would
debate over whose rules we should
be following.
Psychology majors would watch
where everyone else was hiding, and
then smirk to themselves as they
chose the most obvious spot, rea
soning that no smart Stanford stu
dent would look there.
History majors would research
the most successful hiding spots of
the past. And then they'd repeat
those patterns.
Computer Science majors would
write a program to select the most
ideal hiding location, but then
would be too caught up in debug
ging it to get there. But then they'd
get the munchies.
I don't really know what Com
munications majors would do. But
they might videotape it or broadcast
it on the radio.
Mechanical Engineers would
build an impenetrable hiding spot.
A tank, if you will.
Chemistry majors would blow up
all the other hiding spots to force
their opponents out of hiding. By
"accident" of course, because they
didn't know what "reaction" would
result when they mixed everything
together.
MS&E (Management Science
and Engineering, one of Stanford's
most popular majors) majors would

try unsuccessfully to share hiding
spots with the Econ kids, then the
engineers, then the psychologists,
and — after repeated shunning —
would finally relegate themselves to
a pack in the corner where they
could bitterly bark orders at the rest
of the players. That's what consult
ants do, I hear.
Investment bankers would be
too busy to play.
Finally, English majors would get
lost. We'd be too caught up in ana
lyzing what the game means, if the
rules really applied to us or not.
We'd get distracted, and then cite
our sources in an approved format.
The point is, sometimes we all
just need to get lost more. That
means you, highly-paid consultant
for Bain&Co. You'll never know
what you're missing out if you
Mapquest your life out all the
time.(Google Maps is still the best.)
Remember those Dick and Jane
books from your childhood? Just
look around once in awhile. What
would you do if you knew you could
not fail? The impossible just takes
longer.
I'd like to thank Anthony Ha,
Chris Lee and Jennie Kim for being
the trifecta that inspired me to keep
on selling my soul to Intermission.
You showed me that not all college
kids worship at the altar of Dave
Matthews Band. You were the best
surrogate parents an inexperienced
writer and editor could have had.
Thanks for exposing my virgin eyes
to the smutty underworld of arts, en
tertainment and style, and making
me a music, film and style snob in
the process. I'll never be able to
enjoy shitty pop punk again.
I'm sure The Daily is responsible
for the breakups of many a relation
ship or friendship, but we're
masochists like that. I'd like to thank
a certain Spaniard for putting the
now-infamous issue of Intermission
that had the "Tam graphic" face
plastered all over it up on his wall. I
think my hirability increased after
my dear friend and graphic genius
Joseph Bergen turned me into an
anime character/graphic icon. With
out the loving layout and editing

powers of my favorite Puerto Rican,
Victor Fuste, I don't think the infa
mous Intermission Bizarro (it ran
backwards) and Commumission:
The People's Intermission (with a
Soviet twist) would have happened.
In fact, I know it wouldn't have. If
there's one person I can trust to save
me with a cold Hornsby's hard cider
after agonizing hours at the office, it
would be Betsy Congdon, the only
other Intermission editor to go for
three consecutive volumes after my
tenure. Last but not least, Caley An
derson, the little sister my parents
never gave me, has been my inspira
tion for surviving senior year. Her
wit, impeccable taste in music, and
support helped save Intermission as
well as a sorority.
Finally, it feels like a cop-out to
say, "Dad, I got you a diploma for
Father's Day this year. Aren't you
glad you and Mom had me after
all?" Instead, I will give my irrever
ent poet father some equally irrev
erent words. The world would be
better if everyone would do small
things with immense love, right?
He's never forgotten the time we
drove up to Monterey and he asked
me to define "peninsula." After I
rattled off a definition memorized
from sixth grade geography, he got
pissed at my tone of voice (he said I
sounded cocky and ungrateful. I still
maintain that I was tired, but maybe
I was being a bit of a smart-alleck).
In typical poetic Linh Vo fashion, he
lost his temper and sped until a cop
pulled him over for going 90 in a 60
mile lane. He's never let me live it
down. Dad, I promise I won't cause
you any more speeding tickets. If I
do, I '11 pay for them with my meager
earnings from freelance writing.
Thanks, Stanford Daily, for making
me slightly more employable.

Tani Vo has devoted far more time to
editing at The Daily than learning how
to properly prepare pastries, although
she has become suprisingly proficient
at both. If you need a revolution (or if
you just want to trade mix-tape sugges
tions), email Tam Vo at tamvo@stan
ford.edu. But whatever you do, don't
use "Yargh " in the subject line.
