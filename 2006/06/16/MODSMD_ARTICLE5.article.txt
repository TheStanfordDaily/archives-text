## Dalai Lama visits campus Tibetan spiritual leader discusses non-violence, leads meditation 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was perhaps not as coveted as
a guest spot on "The 0.C." or an ac
ceptance to a top law school, but a
ticket to see the Dalai Lama speak
last Friday was certainly a hot com
modity.
Tenzin Gyatso, the Nth Dalai
Lama, spiritual leader of the Ti
betan people and winner of the
1989 Nobel Peace Prize, spent a
total of four hours discussing his
views on meditation, non-violent
resistance and other topics on Fri
day.
The 70-year-old leader delighted
crowds with his mischievous wit.
After lofty introductions from Rev.
Scotty McLennan, dean for Reli
gious Life, and University President
John Hennessy, he carefully un
laced his shoes and told the crowd
"I first have to sit more comfort
ably," before sitting cross-legged on
his ornate chair and chuckling to
himself.

The Dalai Lama's English is
conversationally fluent, but lacking
in technical terms, and when he
stumbled for words he made use of
his translator, Geshe Thupten
Jinpa, who sat at his side. At one
point he gestured toward his long
term translator and marveled at the
fact that "My study of English start
ed before this one's birth," in 1958.
Poking fun at Jinpa, he added, "His
English is better, but my voice is
better."
The morning session, which took
place in Maples Pavilion, was at
tended by approximately 6,500
people. The Dalai Lama, wearing
his familiar red-and-yellow robes,
took the stage bowing with his
hands together in front of his face in
his famous gesture of peace.
Among other points, he comment
ed on the power of education to
allow people to better recognize
truths and the ability of negative
emotions to obscure that truth.
"Negative emotions are actually
one of the greatest obstacles of see

ing reality clearly," he said.
He concluded his morning talk
by leading a five-minute meditation
session for the crowd.
"So now let us meditate," he
said. "But if you take this opportu
nity for sleep, you should not
snore," he added, eliciting laughter
from the crowd.
His afternoon appearance in
Memorial Church, before a full-ca
pacity audience of 1,500 people,
consisted of a dialogue between
himself and McLennan on the topic
of non-violent resistance. He advo
cated a position that was far from
that of a strict pacifist, to the sur
prise of many in the audience.
"Any action motivated by social
concern, compassion — that's es
sentially non-violent," he said in re
sponse to a question from McLen
nan on the acceptability of violence
in self-defense.
