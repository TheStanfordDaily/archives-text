## Card bounced by 'bama in Super Regional No. 7 Stanford eliminated from NCAA Tournament in two-game loss to Crimson Tide 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
A seven-run deficit in the first inning is not the
right way to start off a softball game.
While No. 7 Stanford managed to fight back
and tie the score in the second game of its series
with No. 5 Alabama, the Cardinal ultimately lost
the Saturday game and the series in this weekend's
NCAA Super Regional.
The Crimson Tide had put seven runs on the
board by the time the 12th-seeded Cardinal (42-
18) took their first at-bat. Stanford batters re
sponded by quickly scoring three of their own in
the first inning to tie the game in the fourth. De
spite the unlikely comeback, Alabama (54-9)
eventually took the 8-7 extra-innings win on Sat
urday. Having already posted a 4-1 victory Friday,
Alabama advanced to the Women's College World
Series with the win.
"Any time you lose the last game of the season,
it's difficult," Stanford Coach John Rittman said.
"I felt like the effort was there but our execution
was not the best. Honestly, I think we just ran out
of time. We rallied back from a big deficit and just
fell short. It's tough, but I was proud of the way we
fought."
Stanford's sophomore starter Becky McCul
lough struggled to find the strike zone against the
top of Alabama's order, walking three of the first
four batters at the plate.
After a two-RBI double put Alabama's first

runs on the board, freshman Missy Penna took
over in the circle and immediately walked in an
other run. A second two-RBI double and a two-
RBI single gave the Tide the 7-0 advantage.
With its season on the line, the Stanford squad
did not give up and answered with its own three
run first inning. The Tide made three costly mis
takes — a wild pitch, a fielding error and an over
throw at the plate — that allowed senior Catalina
Morris to score. Penna brought home senior Lau
ren Lappin with a single, and freshman Maddy
Coon scored on another wild pitch to close the gap
to 7-3.
The Cardinal struck again in the fourth inning,
tying the game with a four-run rally. With the bases
loaded, sophomore Anna Beardman reached base
on an error, which brought two runs across the
plate. Lappin hit a single to the shortstop for two
RBI and the score was knotted at seven.
"It was just never giving up, never quitting,"
Rittman said of the comeback. "We have such
good leadership from the seniors and upperclass
men who have been there before — they know
that we are capable of scoring seven, eight, nine
runs in a game. When you give up that many runs
early, there is a lot of ballgame left to play. And we
took that approach — that we still had seven in
nings to play and we just needed to chip away and
get back in it."
The 7-7 tie lasted through the seventh, pushing
the game into extra innings. But in the eighth, Al
abama's Mandy Burford reached base on an error
and stole second and third before coming home on
an RBI single. Down by a run, the Cardinal hit into
a double play to end the eighth inning and the
game.
The win was Alabama's second of the series fol
lowing a 4-1 victory over the Cardinal on Friday.

The sweep eliminated the Cardinal and advanced
Alabama to the WCWS.
On Friday, Alabama scored a run in the second
inning and two in the third before the Cardinal
broke through in the sixth with Penna's RBI sin
gle. The Cardinal would not score again and the
Tide notched an insurance run in the bottom of the
sixth for the final margin.
Junior Jackie Rinehart had a stellar day at the
plat 6 for Stanford by going 3-for-3. But the rest of
the team could only muster three more hits.
"We dealt with some adversity this year,"
Rittman said. "When you have injuries to two of
your pitchers — Penna's smashed thumb and Mc-
C'ullough's arm — it can be very hard. But we bat
tled through that. For a team to win 42 games when
you play the schedule that we played, that is a suc
cessful season."
Stanford returns next year without its five cur
rent seniors, including Pac-10 Defensive Player of
the Year Lappin. But the Cardinal will have an ex
perienced squad of rising juniors and seniors who
are ready to step into leadership positions.
"Each year is a new year, and this year's team
was special and unique in many ways," Rittman
said. "Next year, the team must develop its own
identity. We will need new leaders but we already
have them in our program."
Alabama is scheduled to now face No. 4 North
western in the first round of the WCWS. There
were no significant upsets in this year's bracket
and the eight teams going to Oklahoma are the
tournament's top eight seeds. Four of those teams,
including top-ranked UCLA, are from the Pac-10.
