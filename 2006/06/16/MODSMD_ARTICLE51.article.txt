# No NCAA tournament for basketball, men's first miss in more than a decade
## A 						loss in the Pac-10 Tournament sends the Cardinal to the NIT 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
LOS ANGELES — Though the
NCAA field will not be officially
announced until Sunday, there is lit
tle suspense for players, coaches, ex
perts or even the casual fan. After a
73-68 loss to Arizona in the Pac-10
Tournament Quarterfinals, Stan
ford will miss the NCAA Tourna
ment for the first time since 1994.
In that 11-year span, Stanford
had accumulated the fifth-longest
active streak of consecutive NCAA
appearances in the nation. Only
Arizona (21), Kansas (16), Ken
tucky (14) and Cincinnati (14) have
been to the Big Dance more times
in a row.
"[Ending the NCAA Tourna
ment streak] is really disappointing,
especially in your senior year," said
senior forward Matt Haryasz, who
tallied 14 points on 6-of-8 shooting,
as well as five rebounds and five
turnovers. "We didn't win enough
games, and we had to fight hard for
other ones. It's disappointing and
that's it."
Now, the Card will likely be del
egated to the National Invite Tour
nament, with their first game com
ing between Mar. 14 and Mar. 17.
The outstanding play of Mustafa
Shakur and Ivan Radenovic helped
the Wildcats (19-11, 11-7 Pac-10)
overcome Hassan Adams! absence
to down the Cardinal (15-13,11-7)
for the third time this season.
The Wildcats were forced to play
without Adams, their leading scor
er, after Coach Lute Olson suspend
ed him for the Pac-10 Tournament
because of a DUI arrest.
As in the schools' previous two
meetings this season, the Cardinal
saw no lack of opportunities down
the stretch. They cut the Wildcat
lead to just one point with 3:11 to
play, but their 23 turnovers on the
afternoon proved too costly to
overcome.
"There is no question that the

thing that did it for us today was our
defense," Olson said. "That's been
our trademark all year long. Our
guys believe that defense is the way
to win games. I think this is the best
defensive team we've had here."
The Wildcats stifled the Cardi
nal's ball movement, limiting op
portunities and getting into passing
lanes. Arizona finished with 13
steals, including five by guard Chris
Rodgers — a Pac-10 Tournament
record.
"You have to look at why those
turnovers happened," Stanford
Coach Trent Johnson said. "You
have to give credit to our opponent.
Bottom line is they are better than
us."
And while Arizona's defense
was solid, Stanford had more than
its share of offensive miscues. In
their final chance to keep the 11-
year streak alive, Haryasz and sen
ior guard Chris Hernandez com
bined for 12 of the Card's 23
turnovers, many of them unforced.
At the other end of the floor,
Arizona's offense proved too much
in the final ten minutes. While the
Cardinal limited the Wildcats to just
two field goals in that stretch, Ari
zona still got to the free-throw line
22 times. They would make 17 of
those attempts to strengthen their
NCAA bid and advance to todayis
semifinal tilt against UCLA (25-6,
14-4), a 79-47 winner over Oregon
State yesterday.
Yet Stanford still had a chance to
snatch the victory in the final min
utes. The Cardinal were down by
just one, 61-60, following sopho
more guard Tim Morrisi lay-in with
3:11 to play.
But Arizona answered with a
layup from Shakur (18 points, seven
rebounds, six assists) and two Rade
novic free throws. A three-pointer
from Cardinal freshman Anthony
Goods — his only bucket in five
long-range attempts — once again
made it a one-possession game with
two minutes remaining. But, fitting
ly, four turnovers in the final 2:30
cut the Stanford rally short.
Stanford opened the game hot,
cruising to a 9-2 lead in less than
three minutes.
But the Wildcats countered with

a 16-2 run that put the Card in an
18-11 hole. Radenovic chipped in
four of those points on his way to a
game-high 21.
Then, in what turned into a game
of streaks, Stanford responded with
an 11 -2 spurt of its own to take a 22-
20 edge, and hung on for a halftime
32-31 lead.
But, much as they did after trail
ing by two at halftime in Palo Alto,
the Wildcats jumped out to a quick
start in the second half and never
trailed again.
And as the Wildcats pulled away,
Haryasz lost his offensive touch
when his team needed him the
most. While Hernandez scored 15
of his 20 in the second half, Haryasz,
playing against his home-state
school, scored only two of his 14 in
the second half.
As has been the case in nearly
every game recently, Haryasz was
double-teamed every time he
touched the ball.
"We could tell early on in the
game that he was one of the guys
that we had to stop in order to be
successful," Olson said. "We tried to
come up quickly and put pressure
on him. Matt is a good player, and it
is really a compliment to him, the
way we have to guard him."
"I just didn't get opportunities to
get a shot," Haryasz said. "If you
don't shoot, you don't score. I was
n't in a position to score in the sec
ond half."
Ultimately, not only Haryasz,
but all four seniors ended their Pac
-10 careers on a disappointing note.
Hernandez led the Cardinal in scor
ing with 20 points, but he also
turned the ball over seven times.
Guard Dan Grunfeld was held to
just five points in 14 minutes, and
guard Jason Haas didn't get into the
game at all.
"It is a disappointing way to go
out, being a senior," Grunfeld said.
"We have four seniors that played
four years in the Pac-10 and have
come down here to L.A. every year.
You don't want to end your Pac-10
tenure on a loss."

touched the ball.
"We could tell early on in the
game that he was one of the guys
that we had to stop in order to be
successful," Olson said. "We tried to
come up quickly and put pressure
on him. Matt is a good player, and it
is really a compliment to him, the
way we have to guard him."
"I just didn't get opportunities to
get a shot," Haryasz said. "If you
don't shoot, you don't score. I was
n't in a position to score in the sec
ond half."
Ultimately, not only Haryasz,
but all four seniors ended their Pac
-10 careers on a disappointing note.
Hernandez led the Cardinal in scor
ing with 20 points, but he also
turned the ball over seven times.
Guard Dan Grunfeld was held to
just five points in 14 minutes, and
guard Jason Haas didn't get into the
game at all.
"It is a disappointing way to go
out, being a senior," Grunfeld said.
"We have four seniors that played
four years in the Pac-10 and have
come down here to L.A. every year.
You don't want to end your Pac-10
tenure on a loss."

LOS ANGELES — Though the
NCAA field will not be officially
announced until Sunday, there is lit
tle suspense for players, coaches, ex
perts or even the casual fan. After a
73-68 loss to Arizona in the Pac-10
Tournament Quarterfinals, Stan
ford will miss the NCAA Tourna
ment for the first time since 1994.
In that 11-year span, Stanford
had accumulated the fifth-longest
active streak of consecutive NCAA
appearances in the nation. Only
Arizona (21), Kansas (16), Ken
tucky (14) and Cincinnati (14) have
been to the Big Dance more times
in a row.
"[Ending the NCAA Tourna
ment streak] is really disappointing,
especially in your senior year," said
senior forward Matt Haryasz, who
tallied 14 points on 6-of-8 shooting,
as well as five rebounds and five
turnovers. "We didn't win enough
games, and we had to fight hard for
other ones. It's disappointing and
that's it."
Now, the Card will likely be del
egated to the National Invite Tour
nament, with their first game com
ing between Mar. 14 and Mar. 17.
The outstanding play of Mustafa
Shakur and Ivan Radenovic helped
the Wildcats (19-11, 11-7 Pac-10)
overcome Hassan Adams! absence
to down the Cardinal (15-13,11-7)
for the third time this season.
The Wildcats were forced to play
without Adams, their leading scor
er, after Coach Lute Olson suspend
ed him for the Pac-10 Tournament
because of a DUI arrest.
As in the schools' previous two
meetings this season, the Cardinal
saw no lack of opportunities down
the stretch. They cut the Wildcat
lead to just one point with 3:11 to
play, but their 23 turnovers on the
afternoon proved too costly to
overcome.
"There is no question that the

thing that did it for us today was our
defense," Olson said. "That's been
our trademark all year long. Our
guys believe that defense is the way
to win games. I think this is the best
defensive team we've had here."
The Wildcats stifled the Cardi
nal's ball movement, limiting op
portunities and getting into passing
lanes. Arizona finished with 13
steals, including five by guard Chris
Rodgers — a Pac-10 Tournament
record.
"You have to look at why those
turnovers happened," Stanford
Coach Trent Johnson said. "You
have to give credit to our opponent.
Bottom line is they are better than
us."
And while Arizona's defense
was solid, Stanford had more than
its share of offensive miscues. In
their final chance to keep the 11-
year streak alive, Haryasz and sen
ior guard Chris Hernandez com
bined for 12 of the Card's 23
turnovers, many of them unforced.
At the other end of the floor,
Arizona's offense proved too much
in the final ten minutes. While the
Cardinal limited the Wildcats to just
two field goals in that stretch, Ari
zona still got to the free-throw line
22 times. They would make 17 of
those attempts to strengthen their
NCAA bid and advance to todayis
semifinal tilt against UCLA (25-6,
14-4), a 79-47 winner over Oregon
State yesterday.
Yet Stanford still had a chance to
snatch the victory in the final min
utes. The Cardinal were down by
just one, 61-60, following sopho
more guard Tim Morrisi lay-in with
3:11 to play.
But Arizona answered with a
layup from Shakur (18 points, seven
rebounds, six assists) and two Rade
novic free throws. A three-pointer
from Cardinal freshman Anthony
Goods — his only bucket in five
long-range attempts — once again
made it a one-possession game with
two minutes remaining. But, fitting
ly, four turnovers in the final 2:30
cut the Stanford rally short.
Stanford opened the game hot,
cruising to a 9-2 lead in less than
three minutes.
But the Wildcats countered with

a 16-2 run that put the Card in an
18-11 hole. Radenovic chipped in
four of those points on his way to a
game-high 21.
Then, in what turned into a game
of streaks, Stanford responded with
an 11 -2 spurt of its own to take a 22-
20 edge, and hung on for a halftime
32-31 lead.
But, much as they did after trail
ing by two at halftime in Palo Alto,
the Wildcats jumped out to a quick
start in the second half and never
trailed again.
And as the Wildcats pulled away,
Haryasz lost his offensive touch
when his team needed him the
most. While Hernandez scored 15
of his 20 in the second half, Haryasz,
playing against his home-state
school, scored only two of his 14 in
the second half.
As has been the case in nearly
every game recently, Haryasz was
double-teamed every time he
touched the ball.
"We could tell early on in the
game that he was one of the guys
that we had to stop in order to be
successful," Olson said. "We tried to
come up quickly and put pressure
on him. Matt is a good player, and it
is really a compliment to him, the
way we have to guard him."
"I just didn't get opportunities to
get a shot," Haryasz said. "If you
don't shoot, you don't score. I was
n't in a position to score in the sec
ond half."
Ultimately, not only Haryasz,
but all four seniors ended their Pac
-10 careers on a disappointing note.
Hernandez led the Cardinal in scor
ing with 20 points, but he also
turned the ball over seven times.
Guard Dan Grunfeld was held to
just five points in 14 minutes, and
guard Jason Haas didn't get into the
game at all.
"It is a disappointing way to go
out, being a senior," Grunfeld said.
"We have four seniors that played
four years in the Pac-10 and have
come down here to L.A. every year.
You don't want to end your Pac-10
