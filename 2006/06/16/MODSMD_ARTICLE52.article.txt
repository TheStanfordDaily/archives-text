## 
### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
After finishing a trying race at the
NCAA Championships last Monday,
the women of Stanford cross country
had no idea who had captured the
team title. For 15 minutes the Cardi
nal had no idea they were moments
away from a national championship.
"At the end of the race, I thought
if we made the top four we could
consider ourselves fortunate," head
coach Peter Tegen said.
Sophomore Arianna Lambie,
whose eighth-place finish paced the
Cardinal, had no idea her team had
placed first.
"Not all of us had our best races,
so right after the race some of us
were down and some of us were
happy," Lambie said. "When we
found out we were thrilled."
Meanwhile, the men placed sixth

among the 31 teams that competed
last Monday, the highest finish of a
Pac-10 squad.
The women's race went out fast
and Lambie stayed up front through
out, finishing the 6,(XX)-meter course
in 19:59.1.
Junior Katy Trotter, redshirt
freshman Lindsay Flacks and sopho
more Lauren Centrowitz were the
Cardinal's second, third and fourth
runners, respectively, finishing 20th,
25th and 47th of the 253 runners.
Sophomore Teresa McWalters
was the fifth and final scorer for the
Cardinal, finishing 92nd overall in
21:17.8.
The Cardinal entered the race
ranked second, while Duke was
ranked first in the nation. The Blue
Devils finished the race in third
place, breaking their season-long
winning streak.
On the men's side, the Cardinal

held their sixth-place rank with a
sixth-place finish.
Sophomore Nef Araia was 11th
overall, finishing the 10,000-meter
race in 29:51.6. Juniors Jonathan
Pierce, Jacob Gomez, and Brett
Gotcher were second, third and
fourth-place finishers for the Cardi
nal.
Senior David Vidal was 84th
overall, the last scorer for the men.
Wisconsin won the team title eas
ily, with three of their runners finish
ing in the top 10. Arizona, who won
West Regionals two Saturdays ago,
finished 10th overall.
"I think we are on a good track, a
good beginning," Tegen said. "We
can build on this experience. The
men showed me there is a lot of up
ward potential in this team."
