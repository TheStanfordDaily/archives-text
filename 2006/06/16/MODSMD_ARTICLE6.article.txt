## Wire leads to cocaine bust 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD MANAGING EDITOR 
In a sting operation involving a student wearing a
wire and a five-police-car ambush, Stanford police
arrested junior Paul Larson on Friday for possession
of cocaine and other illicit drugs with the intent to
sell.
According to eyewitnesses and police, the squad
cars pulled over the vehicle carrying Larson hound
for Lake Tahoe on the Enchanted Broccoli Forest ski
trip at 4:05 p.m. on Campus Drive near Vaden Health
Center. During a subsequent search of the vehicle, of
ficers found marijuana and obtained a warrant to
search Larson's room in EBF.
There, police say they found cocaine, prilocybin —
commonly known as shrooms — and more marijua
na, as well as implements to sell narcotics. Larson was
taken into custody before the room was searched and
booked into San Jose Main Jail for possession of a
controlled substance and paraphernalia and for pos
session of implements for the sale of narcotics.
Sophomore Peter Zaffaroni, who was driving by
Vaden when the suspect was handcuffed by police.
characterized Larson's face as a
"mixture of terror and fury."
An additional passenger was
found in possession of less than one
ounce of marijuana, said Deputy
Ken Bates of the Department of
Public Safety. The passenger, a jun
ior, was taken to the station with
Larson, cited and released shortly
thereafter.
Hours after the arrest, police ob
tained a warrant and raided Lar
son's EBF dorm room very early
Saturday morning, seizing the illicit
drugs and related property. Sources
told The Daily that the amount of
cocaine found was roughly 15 grams.
Officers had been staking out Lar
son's dorm room even before ob
taining the warrant, witnesses said.
Police also confiscated parapher
nalia and discovered evidence in the
room that strongly suggested Lar
son was involved in selling the drugs.
Bates said.
The investigation began Thurs
day, sources said, after a junior was
hospitalized after she suffered a
seizure associated with cocaine use.
Police approached the student at
the hospital and convinced her to
cooperate in the investigation of
Larson.
The student was subsequently
outfitted with a wire and sent back
to Larson to buy more cocaine. In
the course of their conversation, po
lice were apparently able to glean
enough information to move for
ward, according to some students fa
miliar with the incident.
When asked about the use of a
wire in the investigation. Bates said,
"I can neither confirm nor deny
that."
The case is currently under re
view by the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney's Office. Formal
charges have not yet been filed. Ac
cording to Bates, Larson's sentence
depends on a host of different fac
tors.
This is not Larson's first run-in
with the law. In January 2(X)4, the
then-freshman was arrested and
charged with minor in possession of
alcohol, resisting arrest, giving a
false name and being drunk in pub
lic at a Branner party.
When contacted by The Daily,
Larson refused to comment.
Citing the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act, Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman said he was unable to
comment on the specifics of the situ
ation. but said that the case will also
be processed through Stanford Judi
cial Affairs.
The case is "not only an alleged
violation of the law, but also an al
leged violation of the Fundamental
Standard," Boardman said.
He would not comment on the
University's specific role in the in
vestigation, but said, "Once we get a
report that there has been the selling
of illegal drugs, we are obligated to
report it to the police."
