# 1906 EARTHQUAKE CENTENNIAL
## Is Stanford ready for the next big one? One hundred years later, University officials say the campus is prepared 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
One hundred years ago this morning, a
7.8-degree earthquake rocked the Bay
Area, nearly obliterating a fledgling Stan
ford University. In the aftermath that fol
lowed, 19()6 Stanford mirrored 2005 Ttilane.
The earthquake killed two students, but the
damage could have been far worse.
The question remains — is Stanford
ready?
University officials say they are confi
dent in their emergency planning, and that
they take every precaution to prepare for a
range of disasters, including the next major
earthquake. The caveat though, they say, is
that the University can only be as prepared
as its staff and students.
"There has been a lot of thought put into
preparing for this scenario around campus,"
said Keith Perry, the training and communi
cations director in the Emergency Manage
ment division of the University's Environ
mental Health and Safety Department.
"Stanford is well-positioned to be able to
respond effectively in the event of another
major earthquake.
"Our first priority is the life safety of stu
dents, faculty, staff and visitors on campus,"
he added. "We are confident that the basic
needs of students would be met."
An elaborate, publicly-available emer

gency plan details the response mechanism
that would he put in place after an earth
quake. A central operation center located
at the Faculty Club would be activated by
the incident commander — currently the
chief of police — and 26 satellite opera
tion centers would come online. Each
satellite center has developed its own local
plan for what to do in the event of an earth
quake.
A contingent of volunteers on campus
has agreed to look at buildings' exteriors to
get a preliminary view of the damage.They
will report back to the satellite command
centers, helping engineers determine which
buildings should be focused on immediate
ly-
The University emergency preparedness
system is designed around an all-hazards
approach, meaning that the protocol for an
earthquake response is very similar to that
of a terrorist attack. Hiere are three cate
gories of events, ranging in severity from an
easily-manageable level-one problem to a
level-three emergency.
The Situation Triage Emergency Team
(STAT) would convene via phone to decide
what resources were needed where.
"We have completed a lot of pre-plan
ning for an earthquake," Perry said.
He told The Daily that his staff continu
ally re-evaluates and re-considers the best
responses to various disasters. Members
also conduct annual emergency exercises. A
major earthquake simulation prompted the
activation of the Emergency Operations
Center the week before last.
"It went quite well." Perry said of the
run-through. "As with all exercises, our goal
is to identify areas we can improve for next

year."
Perry declined to specify lessons learned
in this month's drill. But these planning ef
forts have led to more preparation in the
past.
For example, residential and dining serv
ices significantly increased targets for how
much food and shelter is needed on inven
tory in the aftermath of a quake as a result
of such planning efforts.
Electronics and communications hubs
needed to keep the school running have
also received attention.
"Emergency generators have been in
stalled in many critical areas " Perry said.

Satellite phones have been procured so
leaders on campus can maintain contact
with others in the event of local outages. If
all else fails, emergency planners have de
signed a system for runners to carry mes
sages from satellite command posts to
emergency headquarters. The school even
keeps ham radios in case all other backups
fail.
"Essential service facilities will be oper
ational," said Jean Barnes, the associate di
rector of the University's Land and Build
ings Department.
Regular evacuation drills in the resi
dence halls are intended to help prepare

students for an earthquake.
Hotlines have been established for stu
dents, faculty, staff and parents in the event
of a major earthquake. These phone num
bers or Web sites could be vital tools to pro
vide dispersed populations with updates
about the status of recovery efforts in the af
termath of a major disaster.
As a contingency, Stanford is partnering
with Duke University so leaders can post
emergency information online if the local
systems still go down.

The magnitude 7.8 Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 wreaked havoc on campus and throughout the Peninsula. Since 1989's
Loma Prieta Quake, the University has spent some $300 million and has seismically retrofitted 140 buildings to prepare for the next Big
One.
