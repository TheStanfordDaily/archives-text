## From Frost to football practice field Stanford Stadium construction forces ceremony site change 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, University President John
Hennessy announced via e-mail to the
Class of 2006 and their parents that this
year's University-wide graduation cere
monies will be held at the football prac
tice field, not at Frost Amphitheater as
was originally planned.
Hennessy's letter came after Univer
sity administrators received approxi
mately 750 responses from various sen
iors and their parents expressing their
preferences for the site of this year's
Commencement exercises.
These responses were in reaction to
an Oct. 26 letter from Hennessy to sen
iors and their parents which proposed
three sites — the football practice field.
Frost Amphitheater, and Roble field —
as potential locations for this year's
graduation ceremony, which cannot be
held in Stanford Stadium due to renova
tions that will be taking place next June.
That letter also encouraged students
and their parents to submit their prefer
ences for this year's site.
Yesterday's letter stated that the
football practice field "was favored by
nearly three-quarters of respondents
and by a roughly equal ratio of both stu
dents and their parents."
Of the three proposed sites, the foot
ball practice field can accommodate the
greatest number of people, and each
graduate will be able to invite nine
guests to the graduation ceremonies.
In previous years, when Commence
ment was held in Stanford Stadium,
graduates were allowed to invite up to
50 guests. But with limited seating this
year, the University plans on setting up
a ticket exchange system whereby stu
dents who do not need their full allot
ment of tickets will be able to redistrib
ute them to those who want to invite
more than nine guests.
Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to the
president, explained that while Univer
sity administrators have not yet ham
mered out the details of the exchange
program, they will work with the senior
class presidents to set up a fair system in
which all extra tickets will be collected
and then re-allotted according to de
mand.
He also explained that most students
will likely not need all nine invitations.
"Last year, each student had an aver
age of six guests, so for most students the
allotted tickets will be more than suffi
cient," he said.
