## Stanford expands financial aid For families earning less than $45,000, parents pay nothing 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford families with combined incomes less
than $45.(XM) will not be expected to contribute any
money toward their children's Stanford tuition.
Families with an annual income between $45,000
and $60,000 will also sec significant reductions in ex
pected parental contributions.
The changes, announced on March 15, will bene
fit more than 1,100 students and cost the University
an additional $3.1 million in funds budgeted for fi
nancial aid next year. Stanford joins a select group of
elite schools with the announcement, effective at the
start of the new school year in September for both
new and currently-enrolled students.
The University hopes that publicizing the policy
will send a clear message encouraging qualified low
income students to apply for admission.
"Well-prepared students don't apply to higher
cost colleges as much as their peers," Financial Aid
Director Karen Cooper said in an interview with
The Daily. "This is a national problem. One way to
address it is to get the word out to families who may
not know that financial aid is available: an education
at Stanford can be affordable."
ITie announcement was picked up all over the

country by a wide range of media outlets. University
officials said they were pleased by what they charac
terized as a tremendous response from parents,
alumni and the media.
"We've always had a strong program for low-in
come students, but what we have lacked is the clear
message to students and parents," Cooper said.
Ten percent of student's families at the Universi
ty already make $30,000 or less, she added.
Stanford remains competitive with other top col
leges in measures of economic diversity, according
to data collected by EconomicDiversity.org, a proj
ect of the Institute for College Access and Success.
"From its earliest days, Stanford has had equal
commitments to excellence and ensuring access to
students from the widest variety of backgrounds and
circumstances," University President John Hen
nessy said in the statement announcing the new pol
icy. "Having a student body from diverse economic
backgrounds benefits not just the students who re
ceive financial aid, but also the entire student body
â€” enhancing their academic experience and broad
ening their worldview."
ITie announcement is, at least in part, an effort
by the University to remain a leader in its quest for
disadvantaged applicants. Harvard. Princeton,
Brown and Yale have also recently implemented
policies that reduce parental contributions to dif-
