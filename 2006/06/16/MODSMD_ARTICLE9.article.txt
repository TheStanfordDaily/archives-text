## Stanford expands financial aid For families earning less than $45,000, parents pay nothing 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford families with combined incomes less
than $45.(XM) will not be expected to contribute any
money toward their children's Stanford tuition.
Families with an annual income between $45,000
and $60,000 will also sec significant reductions in ex
pected parental contributions.
The changes, announced on March 15, will bene
fit more than 1,100 students and cost the University
an additional $3.1 million in funds budgeted for fi
nancial aid next year. Stanford joins a select group of
elite schools with the announcement, effective at the
start of the new school year in September for both
new and currently-enrolled students.
The University hopes that publicizing the policy
will send a clear message encouraging qualified low
income students to apply for admission.
"Well-prepared students don't apply to higher
cost colleges as much as their peers," Financial Aid
Director Karen Cooper said in an interview with
The Daily. "This is a national problem. One way to
address it is to get the word out to families who may
not know that financial aid is available: an education
at Stanford can be affordable."
ITie announcement was picked up all over the

country by a wide range of media outlets. University
officials said they were pleased by what they charac
terized as a tremendous response from parents,
alumni and the media.
"We've always had a strong program for low-in
come students, but what we have lacked is the clear
message to students and parents," Cooper said.
Ten percent of student's families at the Universi
ty already make $30,000 or less, she added.
Stanford remains competitive with other top col
leges in measures of economic diversity, according
to data collected by EconomicDiversity.org, a proj
ect of the Institute for College Access and Success.
"From its earliest days, Stanford has had equal
commitments to excellence and ensuring access to
students from the widest variety of backgrounds and
circumstances," University President John Hen
nessy said in the statement announcing the new pol
icy. "Having a student body from diverse economic
backgrounds benefits not just the students who re
ceive financial aid, but also the entire student body
— enhancing their academic experience and broad
ening their worldview."
ITie announcement is, at least in part, an effort
by the University to remain a leader in its quest for
disadvantaged applicants. Harvard. Princeton,
Brown and Yale have also recently implemented
policies that reduce parental contributions to dif-
fering degrees for the poorest fami
lies.
Hennessy announced such a plan
last spring, but predicted that it would
take up to five years to implement.
A booming endowment and the
successful $1 billion Campaign for
Undergraduate Education — com
bined with the vocal insistence of
newly-hired Dean of Admission and
Financial Aid Richard Shaw, who ar
rived last year from Yale, — played a
role in convincing the Board of
Trustees to appropriate the extra
money.
"We decided the time was right,"
said Cooper. "There was no need to
wait for five years."
The $3.1 million cost of the new
program joins the $66 million in Uni
versity funds already pledged for next
year's financial aid program. Roughly
76 percent of students receive some
form of internal or external aid.
The break for low-income parents
comes in conjunction with a 5.75 per
cent increase in tuition for other fam
ilies next year, bringing it to $32,994.
Total costs for one year on the Far, in
cluding books, room and board and
other expenses, are estimated to aver
age $47,000.
The $45,000 cutoff was not arbi
trary, as there was some concern that
wealthier families with low annual in
comes but large assets could unfairly
benefit from the new program. After
assessing financial data from past
years, the financial aid specialists at
the University concluded this line
would benefit the greatest number of
students who truly need aid.
"$45,000 was a logical cutoff," said
Cooper. "These families tend not to
have a significant amount of assets.
They generally qualify for other aid,
including Pell Grants."

"Only a small portion of our pop
ulation would he in a situation where
we would not want to give a zero fam
ily contribution." she said. "If we tried
to bring in caveats about assets, it
would have complicated the message
we are trying to send. At $45,000, it's
worth taking the risk."
There was an effort during the
planning process to avoid a so-called
"cliff effect," in which families with
only a marginally higher income
would be forced to contribute a sig
nificantly larger annual contribution.
Thus, all families earning up to
$60,000 will see reductions.
Last year, low-income families
earning below $45,000 were expect
ed to contribute an average of
$2,650, University representatives
said. Families earning incomes be
tween $45,000 and $60,000 will still
be expected to contribute a yearly

average of $3,800, according to The
Chronicle of Higher Education.
Those closer to the $60,000 total
will see a smaller reduced contribu
tion — estimated at one-sixteenth of
the total contribution from the previ
ous year, than families who fall just
above the $45,000 threshold. Some
parents with incomes greater than
$45,000 who have multiple children in
college or special circumstances may
now have no parental contribution as
a result of the change.
While parental contributions will
move to zero, student contributions
will not change. Low-income students
will still need to take loans and work
throughout the year to pay their
share.

money.
"We decided the time was right,"
said Cooper. "There was no need to
wait for five years."
The $3.1 million cost of the new
program joins the $66 million in Uni
versity funds already pledged for next
year's financial aid program. Roughly
76 percent of students receive some
form of internal or external aid.
The break for low-income parents
comes in conjunction with a 5.75 per
cent increase in tuition for other fam
ilies next year, bringing it to $32,994.
Total costs for one year on the Far, in
cluding books, room and board and
other expenses, are estimated to aver
age $47,000.
The $45,000 cutoff was not arbi
trary, as there was some concern that
wealthier families with low annual in
comes but large assets could unfairly
benefit from the new program. After
assessing financial data from past
years, the financial aid specialists at
the University concluded this line
would benefit the greatest number of
students who truly need aid.
"$45,000 was a logical cutoff," said
Cooper. "These families tend not to
have a significant amount of assets.
They generally qualify for other aid,
including Pell Grants."

"Only a small portion of our pop
ulation would he in a situation where
we would not want to give a zero fam
ily contribution." she said. "If we tried
to bring in caveats about assets, it
would have complicated the message
we are trying to send. At $45,000, it's
worth taking the risk."
There was an effort during the
planning process to avoid a so-called
"cliff effect," in which families with
only a marginally higher income
would be forced to contribute a sig
nificantly larger annual contribution.
Thus, all families earning up to
$60,000 will see reductions.
Last year, low-income families
earning below $45,000 were expect
ed to contribute an average of
$2,650, University representatives
said. Families earning incomes be
tween $45,000 and $60,000 will still
be expected to contribute a yearly

average of $3,800, according to The
Chronicle of Higher Education.
Those closer to the $60,000 total
will see a smaller reduced contribu
tion — estimated at one-sixteenth of
the total contribution from the previ
ous year, than families who fall just
above the $45,000 threshold. Some
parents with incomes greater than
$45,000 who have multiple children in
college or special circumstances may
now have no parental contribution as
a result of the change.
While parental contributions will
move to zero, student contributions
will not change. Low-income students
will still need to take loans and work
throughout the year to pay their
share.
