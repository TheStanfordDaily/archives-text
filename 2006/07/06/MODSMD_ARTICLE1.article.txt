# Letter from the Editor
## Farm living over summer Even as pace of life slows, news flow won't with The Weekly 
### 
Welcome to summer at Stanford. It's a
season to travel, read, relax, try some
thing different, make new friends,
learn about a new culture and apply ideas
learned in the classroom to the larger outside
world. It's a time to swim at Avery, walk the
dish and jog around Lake Lag. Watch the sun
rise. Savor a latte and contemplate deep
thoughts. If you haven't before, try journaling.
Our modest, student-managed, tabloid-style
weekly will strive to puncture the comfortable
Stanford bubble while providing readers with
information they may not find anywhere else.
Everyone working on this summer volume is
committed to multiple endeavors and projects
(Palo Alto has a high cost of living, if you
didn't notice). I hope the broad experiences

and travels of the staff will be reflected in our
content.
This volume will be a testament to the role
telecommunications can play at connecting
readers and writers in a world more globalized
than ever. We will run two stories filed from
Germany this week. Our opinions editor is
based out of Alabama. A good deal of the
paper is completed by people off campus. A
dedicated and highly capable team with vary
ing commitments helps put the paper together.
We are debuting a redesigned Web site this
week. There will be kinks but be patient. It's
part of our drive to innovate content, quality
and delivery.
The newsroom is much quieter over the
summer than during the school year, just like
the University. Organized team sports are not

in progress, but the preparation for next season
is in full swing. The best television shows may
be on hiatus but some good movies are sched
uled to come out over the next nine weeks.
You can bet we'll review them for you. There
are not celebrity campus speakers clogging the
docket but compelling events remain worth
covering. There is not the flurry of University
sanctioned activities but we have assembled a
cadre of top-notch reporters and columnists
who will report on campus life over the sum
mer and brilliant designers and photographers
to make those words come alive.
As the guardian of the venerable institution
that is The Stanford Weekly, I will be respon
sive to you — the reader. Contact me anytime
about anything at eic@daily.stanford.edu or
(650) 725-2100, ext. 501. Come by and visit our
office in the Storke Publications Building.
The summer editorial leadership sees The
Weekly as filling a very unique niche in the larg
er local media market. Where others lack the
time and space to cover every nook and cranny
of campus, we hope to shine light on what's
going on across The Farm. We'll do our best to
let you know what Stanford stakeholders are up
to and what an astute observer can expect to see
unfold here over the year to come.
