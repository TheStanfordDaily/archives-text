## Committee sues over C1 trail Committee for Green Foothills claims Stanford environmentally negligent 
### AUDREY PARK 
The Committee for Green Foothills of Palo
Alto has filed a lawsuit against Stanford University
and Santa Clara County over the approved con
struction of a recreational trail on campus.
The CI hiking trail's proposed location along
Alpine Road was approved by a 4-1 vote of the
Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors in
December 2005. But the Committee claims the
project was not subjected to proper environmental
procedures. The trail, the suit said, may pose a haz
ard to the creeks and hillsides along Alpine Road.
"The Committee for Green Foothills is trying to
overturn last year's results," said Larry Horton,
director of government and community relations
for Stanford. He described the suit as "without
merit."
Specifics regarding the June 16 suit remain
undisclosed until further developments in the liti
gation, which Stanford will try to resolve in due
time.
This controversial issue can be traced back to a
permit acquired by Stanford from Santa Clara
County six years ago. Under Stanford's 2000
General Use Permit, the university stated it would
"dedicate easements for, develop, and maintain the
portions of the two trail alignments which cross
Stanford lands shown in the 1995 Santa Clara
Countywide Trails Master Plan."
Disagreements arose when Stanford chose to
expand a current bike lane adjacent to Alpine
Road for the CI trail, rather than constructing a
new route altogether. The Committee suggested
alternatives to the allegedly hazardous Alpine
Road trail, but all suggestions were
rejected.
A Santa Clara County legislative
advocate for the Committee for
Green Foothills, Brain Schmidt, has
called Stanford's proposed trail "an
incredible waste of money." He said
that the trail would be environmen
tally destructive and of no recre
ational value.
In addition to the lawsuit, the
Committee for Green Foothills is
calling out to the community to
"stop Stanford's wasteful and
destructive Alpine Road sidewalk
project." For Stanford's trail plan to
be finalized, the University requires
the authorization of San Mateo
County, as well as the town of
Portola Valley, in which the trail
would partially lie. The Committee
is appealing for community mem
bers to write and ask those local
governments to reject the funds
offered by Stanford.
Following a recent public hearing
in Ladera, the proposed Alpine
Road trail is being reviewed by the
relevant authorities.
For the past few years, conflicts
with environmental groups over
Stanford's land use have interfered
with trail construction, despite the
CI route being long overdue in
keeping with the conditions of the
General Use Permit.
