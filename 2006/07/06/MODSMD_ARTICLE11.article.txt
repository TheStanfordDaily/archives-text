## Sketch Football's not coming home Un-American football gets its time to shine 
### 
Football. Futbol. Football. For a
month the greatest sport in the
world has its name back.
Despite the best efforts of this hea
then land to insist that a silly activi
ty played with hands and body
armor should steal the name of the
planet's favorite game, until July
Ninth, Football is Football.
The World Cup is the greatest
sporting event in the world. One bil
lion, one-hundred million people
watched the 2002 final. (This is
about 1.1 billion more than the num
ber of people who care about the
Big Game.) God, if only I could get
1.1 billion people to watch me do
physics...
Football is life. No, it's more
than life. Life is miserable and
depressing. It's filled with failed
opportunities and constant disap
pointments. Football, on the other
hand, is completely different. Well,
maybe not completely different, but
eventually your team will win some
thing and you'll experience a brief,
transitory moment of happiness.
Unless you're English.
Now, I was expecting that,
despite the general delightfulness of
the US of A and its people, the
atmosphere greeting la Copa del
Mundo would be less than lively.
After all, you people are a little
backward when it comes to sporting
matters.
In fact, if I were somewhat more
sociologically inclined I might make
an observation about the parallels
between the global obscurity of
America's leading sports and your
country's insistence on conducting
its foreign affairs without a thought
for the rest of the world's point of
view.
And if I were really in the mood
to run with the intellectual preten
sion, I'd also point out that the

repeated assertions of the superiori
ty of American sports in the face of
overwhelming evidence to the con
trary bears more than a little resem
blance to the philosophy of
American Exceptionalism and its
associated hubris.
I suppose that if I were also some
kind of socialist I might top off the
previous couple of remarks by not
ing that the 60/40 blend of commer
cials and sporting action during tele
vised American sporting events
speaks volumes about rampant
unchecked capitalism and its ten
dency to drown whatever it touches.
However, I'm not really the
Noam Chomsky type, so let's get
back to the matter at hand: Football.
Stanford is really dull. Not just
dull because there's nothing to do,
but dull because there's no one to
do it with. Football is a community
sport. It's best followed in public,
watched in pubs and discussed over
pints. Especially when it's the
World Cup.
Now, since communal watching
and the like require a community,
you can probably see how the low
expectations arose. It turns out,
however, that I was wrong.
Apparently Stanford kids aren't
quite the insular, America-centric
stereotypes we like to mock back in
the old country; and, thanks to the
efforts of some of my peers and the
lovely folks at the 750, we've had
every game shown in the GCC.
