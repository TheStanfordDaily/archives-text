# How I'm spending my Summer vacation
## 
### SINI MATIKAINEN OPINIONS EDITOR 
It wasn't supposed to turn out like this.
I had such grand plans, after all. This past January I
told people I wanted to get a job on a whale-watching
expedition as a deckhand, or work as a guide in the
mountains of Italy or hitchhike my way across New
Zealand.
These things did not happen.
To start with, the whale-watching expedition's appli
cation wanted to know what experience I had in man
ning a ship.
As someone who's not especially fond of being on
boats, much less crewing them, this took some thought.
After some consideration, I wrote, "I go to Stanford."
They asked me if I was capable of lifting heavy
objects. I considered my lack of upper body strength, my
tendency to tire easily and my second X chromosome. I
wrote, "Did I mention I go to Stanford?"

They asked me to list the last ships I had worked on,
in chronological order. I listed one: the USS Stanford?
For reasons I cannot fathom, a girl with no stamina
and no experience except an in-depth knowledge of
IHUM was not what they were looking for in a deck
hand. (It's ok, though — the job description noted that I
wouldn't have Internet access for weeks at a time, which
represented an irreconcilable difference between their
expectations and my personal needs.)
As for working in the mountains of Italy, my com
munication with the resort director was going along
swimmingly until he realized that I did not, in fact, live
in Britain. This would prove to be a minor obstacle in
light of the mandatory in-person interview with the
London-based firm.
"I could set up a webcam," I offered.
"Please let us know if you're ever in the UK," he
responded politely.
My great plans for New Zealand
led me to look up ticket prices on
Expedia and quickly realize two
things: 1) plane tickets cost a lot of
money and 2) working as a migrant
worker across Kiwi sheep farms
would probably not make up the
cost of the ticket. I also have a
strong suspicion that sheep bite peo
ple.
So, rather unsurprisingly, I am
spending most of the summer doing
what I do (and love) best —
absolutely nothing.
Oh, theoretically speaking, I
have things to do. I'm interning at a
local magazine and "working as a
research assistant," but both (per
haps not very wisely) allow me to set
my own hours, hence leaving large
chunks of time for my own amuse
ment. The magazine, run by a small
staff that is constantly in and out of
the office, allows its staff members
to come and go as they please.
Granted, the lax atmosphere is for
people who have to drop off and
pick up their kids from daycare, go
to class or drive to another other
job. But I consider my need to take
a nap an equally important pursuit.
My "research assistant" position,

which is glorified data entry, is done
completely from my house, which
allows me to proceed at the pace I
feel comfortable with, which is an
hour or two of work a day.
Therefore, there is nothing to
prevent me from whiling away my
time with thick Russian novels and
hours spent pointlessly on the
Internet. Perhaps I might, hypothet
ically, spend the better part of my
day looking at pictures of kittens
online. So? Things happen. Maybe I
even (hypothetically) send some of
these pictures to my mom, even
though she is (hypothetically) sitting
in the next room and hates cats.
Maybe she's not impressed. Maybe I
keep doing it anyway, for several
hours.
Normally, irritating my mom and
wasting time online would have
some kind of time limit, such as
reaching the age of 13. But since I'm
not really doing anything else,
there's nothing to stop me. And it's
worth keeping in mind whenever I
start daydreaming about New
Zealand that sheep aren't nearly as
cute as kittens.
And sheep farms don't have
Internet access.
