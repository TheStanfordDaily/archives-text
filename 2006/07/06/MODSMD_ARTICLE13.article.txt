# How I'm spending my Summer vacation

It wasn't supposed to turn out like this.
I had such grand plans, after all. This past January I
told people I wanted to get a job on a whale-watching
expedition as a deckhand, or work as a guide in the
mountains of Italy or hitchhike my way across New
Zealand.
These things did not happen.
To start with, the whale-watching expedition's appli
cation wanted to know what experience I had in man
ning a ship.
As someone who's not especially fond of being on
boats, much less crewing them, this took some thought.
After some consideration, I wrote, "I go to Stanford."
They asked me if I was capable of lifting heavy
objects. I considered my lack of upper body strength, my
tendency to tire easily and my second X chromosome. I
wrote, "Did I mention I go to Stanford?"

They asked me to list the last ships I had worked on,
in chronological order. I listed one: the USS Stanford?
For reasons I cannot fathom, a girl with no stamina
and no experience except an in-depth knowledge of
IHUM was not what they were looking for in a deck
hand. (It's ok, though â€” the job description noted that I
wouldn't have Internet access for weeks at a time, which
represented an irreconcilable difference between their
expectations and my personal needs.)
As for working in the mountains of Italy, my com
munication with the resort director was going along
swimmingly until he realized that I did not, in fact, live
in Britain. This would prove to be a minor obstacle in
light of the mandatory in-person interview with the
London-based firm.
"I could set up a webcam," I offered.
"Please let us know if you're ever in the UK," he
responded politely.
