# Letter to the editor
## David Horowitz responds to Joel Beinin, writes about ongoing lawsuit 
### 
lar Editor:

The letter published in the Stanford Daily
(June 8, 2006) signed by several Stanford fac
ulty and students protesting a pamphlet I pub
lished called "Campus Support for
Terrorism," is puzzling. The signers claim to
be speaking in behalf of "every American who
believes in the right to speak without intimi
dation and fear," yet they seem not to have

noticed that Professor Beinin's copyright suit
against me is an act of intimidation aimed
directly at my free speech rights.
If Joel Beinin thinks that my assessment of
his work as a support for terrorism is false and
is an attempt to "destroy his reputation" as the
letter says, why doesn't he sue me for libel?
The answer is that truth is a defense against
libel, and Beinin (or his lawyer) knows this.
Therefore he has chosen the underhanded tac
tic of suing me over a copyright that he didn't
even own until a year after the pamphlet was
published (copyright law is quirky on this
point).
A lawsuit, in the event any readers might
be innocent of such matters, is pretty serious
intimidation. Legal costs in a case like this can
mount quickly to five figures and not particu

larly the low five figures either. Perhaps there
are Stanford students and professors who have
$50,(XX) in their pocket to defend themselves
should they upset a political opponent. Others
will understand the problem this poses for free
speech.
The protesters' letter claims that my view
of Beinin as a supporter of terrorism is "ludi
crous." Is it? Joel Beinin wrote a long article
attacking the Ford Foundation for withdraw
ing its funding from four terrorist "charities"
in the Middle East. Joel Beinin supported ter
rorist leader Sami al-Arian even after his
indictment based on 10 years of phone taps
that revealed his conversations with terrorists
in Syria arranging for the payments of suicide
bombers in Israel. The Stanford Daily itself
reported Beinin's demand that then Secretary

of State Colin Powell stop "lecturing Yasir
Arafat about the need to do more to stop ter
rorism." Instead, Beinin insisted that the ter
rorist Arafat had to be recognized as a
respected statesman and treated accordingly.
Arafat, said Beinin, "is the elected president
of the Palestinian Authority and the symbol of
Palestinian national aspirations and should be
respected as such."
This is what I call "support for terrorism." I
concede that there may be room for honest
disagreement on this matter. But not for law
suits designed to chill free speech and ludi
crous letters supporting them in the name of
free speech.
Sincerely,
David Horowitz
