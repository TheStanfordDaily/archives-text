"Fi-na-le woaahh! Fi-na-le woah olrohhh!"
The Germans, an otherwise more conservative
group of people, have lost it, and for good rea
son. With the World Cup, or WM
(Weltmeisterschaft) as it is better known,
drawing to an end and the German national
team still in the running, they deserve the right
to go crazy. And they certainly have. Given
that some Germans will wait for a crosswalk
sign to turn green at 2 a.m. on an empty street
before they cross, the anarchistic behavior
after a win is always quite a sight.
It's been a crazy month here in
Deutschland. Football, or soccer in American
English, has taken over everything, from the
German economy to the U-Bahn to grocery
store specials. As a football fan, it's been hard.
Try writing your final Architecture paper the
night after going to a WM game, or convincing
your boss to let you out early so you can catch
a game. Naturally, although a little surprising
given the German work ethic, everyone
accommodates for it. Not only do they accom
modate it— Germany game days might as well
be national holidays.

Game days in general have been amazing,
albeit very interesting, experiences. Unlike the
Housing Draw, I had the amazing luck of getting
picked for tickets in the first round draw for the
World Cup. Yes, Overseas Studies did pay for
some students to attend a globalization confer
ence in Beijing in early June.
But why go to China when you have tickets to
all three England group stage games?! Sadly, I
can no longer follow the "Three Lions," but hey,
now I know most of the words to the English
national anthem! Game days, which unfortunate
ly happened to coincide with exams and final
papers, became a sort of ritual. From Berlin, I

would take a four to five hour train to the WM
city, find my brother and friend, drink beer, go to
the stadium, drink beer, watch the game, watch
the fans and drink beer.
Watching all the other games from Berlin were
similar experiences, except without the trains and
a little less beer. Overall, it's been one great
month.
As great as the abundant amounts of football
and beer have been, the fans have really defined
this World Cup for me. It's great to be able to go
crazy once in a while and feel normal. And wear
ing flags as capes is not such a bad idea. I've come
to realize that the World Cup publicity people

haven't done so badly after all. Sure the lion mas
cot with no pants does scare me, but I really do
think that people have taken the slogan "A Time
to Make Friends" to heart. Despite anything that
happens on the pitch (like the card-frenzy at the
Portugal-Holland game), I've had countless good
experiences and met so many people from around
the world.
I've watched my football idols live and played
pick-up with talented strangers. After watching
almost every game, I'm dreading the impending
football-withdrawal after July 9. Nevertheless, to
have been in the host country during a World
Cup—what an end to a quarter abroad.
