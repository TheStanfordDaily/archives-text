"Fi-na-le woaahh! Fi-na-le woah olrohhh!"
The Germans, an otherwise more conservative
group of people, have lost it, and for good rea
son. With the World Cup, or WM
(Weltmeisterschaft) as it is better known,
drawing to an end and the German national
team still in the running, they deserve the right
to go crazy. And they certainly have. Given
that some Germans will wait for a crosswalk
sign to turn green at 2 a.m. on an empty street
before they cross, the anarchistic behavior
after a win is always quite a sight.
It's been a crazy month here in
Deutschland. Football, or soccer in American
English, has taken over everything, from the
German economy to the U-Bahn to grocery
store specials. As a football fan, it's been hard.
Try writing your final Architecture paper the
night after going to a WM game, or convincing
your boss to let you out early so you can catch
a game. Naturally, although a little surprising
given the German work ethic, everyone
accommodates for it. Not only do they accom
modate it— Germany game days might as well
be national holidays.
