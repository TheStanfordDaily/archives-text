# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## Pros pass on Cardinal grads None of four graduating seniors chosen in NBA draft after lackluster season 
### DEVIN MARSH 
The Men's Basketball program was dealt a
major setback at the NBA draft late last month
when not one Stanford player was drafted.
Four graduating seniors who had been in con
tention — Jason Haas, Matt Haryasz, Chris
Hernandez, and Dan Grunfeld — did not even
get selected in later rounds.
Three seniors attended pre-draft workouts
for several teams. Grunfeld and Haryasz even
received invitations to the Pre-Draft Camp in
Orlando in early June.
The seniors carried the team through a
somewhat dismal season. Despite Stanford's
difficult year — finishing 15-12 and ranked fifth
in the Pac-10 — Grunfeld, Haryasz, and
Hernandez were the Cardinal's top three scor
ers. While none were first round prospects,
they looked to be drafted at some point during
the second round, hoping franchises would rec
ognize their contributions to Stanford on the
court, and their leadership off it.
Now the future of their careers in basketball
is on the line. Unable to return to The Farm,
the players could try to make it onto competi
tive teams in Europe or demonstrate their
skills in NBA summer leagues.
Senior Matt Haryasz averaged 16 points

and 9 boards his senior year, finishing second
in the Pac-10 in rebounding and sixth in scor
ing. He was a first-team All Pac-10 selection,
and finished third in Stanford history for
blocks in a season with 47. He received Pac-10
Player of the Week honors two weeks in a row
during January, after averaging more than 20
points a game during that period.
Senior Chris Hernandez, who flirted with
declaring for the draft last summer before
returning for his senior season, provided the
team with veteran leadership. He averaged 14
points a game, 90 percent from the free throw
line, and was named Pac-10 Player of the
Week, Feb. 6.
In perhaps one of the most memorable
moments of the year, Hernandez sunk three
straight free throws with no time left on the
clock to force overtime against fifth-ranked
Washington. In his sophomore and junior sea
son he was named to the first-team All Pac-10,
and through his four-year career has been
arguably one of the nation's top point guards.
Senior Dan Grunfeld finished his season
averaging twelve points a game. Grunfeld had
been enjoying his best season as a Cardinal in
his junior year, averaging 18 points a game as
the team's leading scorer before an ACL injury
in February prematurely ended his season. He
recovered quickly from surgery, scoring 29
points in the Cardinal's first game of the sea
son. He dropped 31 points on Arizona State,
and was 11 for 11 from the free throw line on
the one-year anniversary of his surgery.
