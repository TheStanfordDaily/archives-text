## Ducks send men home early Cardinal fall two games short of College World Series 
### ANDREW LOMELI STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Baseball team fell two wins short
of reaching the College World Series this season,
as eventual national champion Oregon State dealt
the Cardinal 4-3 and 15-0 losses in the NCAA
Super Regional tournament on June 10 and 11.
The Cardinal (33-27) kept it tight with the
Beavers until the bottom of the seventh in Game
One on Saturday, when Mitch Canham notched a
two-out RBI double to collect the go-ahead run
that would inevitably win it for the Beavers. Junior
pitcher Greg Reynolds, who was selected second
overall by the Colorado Rockies in the MLB First-
Year Player's Draft just a week earlier, allowed
two earned runs on seven hits and four walks with
nine strikeouts.
Dallas Buck surrendered three runs on eight
hits in eight innings, nabbing six strikeouts in the
process. The Beavers' Kevin Gunderson hurled in
the ninth, collecting his 17th save of the season.
Back-to-back singles in the Beavers' first were
followed by a Reynolds walk, propelling Oregon
State to the early 1-0 lead. Third baseman Randy

Molina led off the third with a walk for the
Cardinal, followed by a two-run homer by left
fielder Jim Rapaport to establish the 2-1 Stanford
advantage. The Beavers collected two more runs
in the third before first baseman Jason Castro
notched a two-out RBI down the third base line to
tie the game in the fifth
Oregon State jumped to the early lead Sunday,
Jun. 11, scoring four runs in the first inning. The
Beavers would go on to add six more in the fourth
and two runs in both the sixth and eighth before a
final run in the ninth. The match marked Oregon
State's third shutout over Stanford this season.
The Cardinal could muster only five hits with
senior shortstop Chris Minaker going two for four.
Stanford used seven pitchers, none of whom last
ing longer than three innings.
Minaker finished his final season on The Farm
batting .364, while sophomore outfielder Michael
Taylor hit .325 for the season. Reynolds pitched
over 127 innings, nabbing 108 strikeouts to go
along with a 7-6 record.
"From my team's standpoint, I'm very proud of
this group," head coach Mark Marquess said. "It's
been a long season with some ups and downs and
rough roads, but they bounced back and played
very well at the end of the season. We came back
and played well, and made a run at it but came up
just short."
