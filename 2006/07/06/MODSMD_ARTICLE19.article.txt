# WORLD CUP
## Full-scale Deutsch-mania Student studying abroad immersed in German pride 
### JOHN SHEN SUMMER COLUMNIST 
When people say the World Cup is a big
deal, it's a bit hard for anyone in America
to understand what that means.
But here in Berlin, where I'm spending
the summer in an extension of Stanford's
Bing Overseas Study Program, it's obvi
ous how big of a deal the World Cup real
ly is. Berlin is both Germany's largest city
and the host city for the finals on Sunday.
As a resident, I'm seeing the Cup from a
different angle than the throngs of tourists
crowding the subways around game time.
And after the U.S. made its exit in a
crushing defeat by Ghana, it wasn't hard at
all to throw myself, like everyone else here
already has, into the excitement around die
deutsche Mannschaft, the German National
Team, and all their victories. And, well,
there's the Italy thing.
Anyway, one of the best places to get in
on the action is the official "Fan Mile" in
downtown Berlin, a stretch of road through
the Tiergarten central park. Filled with

gigantic TV screens every 500 feet, expen
sive vendors (three Euros for a bottle of
water?) and little booths where you can
buy nationally themed Fauxhawk wigs and
the same high-priced whistles and
blowhorns that every other fan already has,
it has become a one-of-a-kind fairground.
Not to mention, there are live stages for TV
broadcasts, a Bavarian-themed restaurant
& beer-hall, a Ferris wheel, sand volleyball
courts, a rock climbing wall, and even a
giant, inflatable Energizer Bunny.
On days when the German National
Team plays, the Fan Mile is packed to the
brim. A million screaming fans wave flags
and cheer for every interception, and
anguish over every advance by the other
team. But the party is really everywhere.
After Germany squeaked a victory (in
penalty kicks) over Argentina, I headed to
the Kufurstendamm, Berlin's equivalent of
the Champs Elysee (although not quite as
grand, I'll admit), where I found myself in
the midst of an impromptu parade stretch
ing the two miles down the boulevard.
Thousands of screaming fans were giving
euphoric high-fives and hugs to random
strangers, and leading the crowds in cheers.
Of course, there were more German flags
than I could count.
Perhaps one of the most unexpect
ed side effects of the World Cup has
been the camaraderie and energy it
has brought to the German people.
The Cup has filled the entire country
with energy and enthusiasm, and
most surprisingly, national pride —
something that's been missing ever
since the whole Nazi thing happened.
All the flag-waving, with the
"Deutschland!" chants and the "I'm
a-Gemian-and-proud-of-it" attitude,
is at once so familiar — almost remi
niscent of the overt patriotism seen in
the United States — and yet so for
eign.
Germans have been taught
almost from birth why they should
be ashamed of their country. To see
a crowd here in Germany proudly
waving, wearing and ostentatiously
displaying their tricolor "Schwartz-
Rot-Gold" is both an unnerving and
strangely uplifting sight. But really,
why can't they be proud of their
country? They've put on a hell of a
show for the rest of the world.
But will this spirit continue? It's
hard to say, especially after the
...ahem... 0-2 loss against Italy in the
semifinals. But given the way the
crowd at the bar where I watched the
game gave a standing ovation after
wards, both to coach Jurgen
Klinsmann for bringing the team this
far, and to the Italians for deserving
their win, who knows? This feel-good
attitude just might last.
