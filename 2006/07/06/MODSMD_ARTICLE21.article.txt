## YOUR SEX ADVICE Summertime Sex Shortage 
### ROXY SASS SUMMER SEX GODDESS 
Even though she's a busy gal (big pimpin'
ain't easy), Roxy's never addressed what to do
when there simply isn't TIME for sex; or, what to
do at a national convention of 1000-plus women
and no suitable penises (they all belong to mid
dle-aged, Republican males). Well, desperate
times call for desperate measures, right? Roxy's
got you covered. If you can't get laid, you can still
do plenty to get your mind off â€” off the fact that
sex is nearly impossible, that is.
If you're stuck on a tour of Washington,
D.C.'s monuments, flex your Kegel muscles
while sitting on the bus. Maybe it won't do the
trick, but it'll remind you that you still have skills.
Ask the hot staff photographer that looks like
the poor man's Justin Timberlake if he wants to
see your disappearing Washington Monument
trick. If you're considering a career in politics,
you might not want to document this on film.
Fourth of July BBQ where the only males are
family members? Don't commit incest, no matter
how horny you are. Unless you're in, like,
Alabama, and second cousins aren't really rela
tives, Roxy suggests those fireworks popsicles as a
patriotic way to pleasure yourself. Please, for the
love of God and all that is holy, don't strap any
Piccolo Petes to your groin area. Total fire hazard.
Forced to intern for a bitch who makes
Miranda in "The Devil Wears Prada" look saint
ly? Have a quickie with the strapping young
FedEx guy in the fashion closet, while claiming to
hunt for an elusive pair of Christian Loboutins
for the day's photo shoot. It'll only take ten min
utes, but you won't be able to wipe that smug
smile off your face for the rest of the day. P.S.
High heels make for better angles.
Working the media reserves desk at Green
Library this summer? Just because Jenna Jameson
doesn't appear on the credits of anything you've
checked out doesn't mean there's nothing to
watch. Foreign films, baby, and independent art
flicks. Pop in Bertolucci's "The Dreamers," or
anything French. There's bound to be nudity, and
that ought to crank up the ice-cold thermostat a
few degrees. If you really don't want to deal with
the language barrier, try the kinky cult classic
"Secretary," featuring Maggie Gyllenhaal. Just
don't set any books on fire, mmmkay?
Stuck slaving long hours as a counselor for
summer nerd camp? You may have read
Nabokov's "Lolita," so stay away from the social
ly inept youngsters. Inappropriate! Remember
that there are a thousand other camps going on
right now at Stanford, including ones that require
athletic skill, not particle physics or number the
ory. Put down the lanyards and hit on the hot
counselors from basketball camp. They can prob
ably show you a new way to score in bed. Swish!
Really desperate because everyone's graduat
ed or moved away? Use that Facebook
"Network" function and hit up everyone in the
area with a personal message. This is really not
the way to get into someone's pants, but if you're
that awkward, you might not have any other
option. At least have the balls to message them;
don't just poke some random hottie until they
block you. One persistent young lad once sent 50
Facebook messages to single girls in the area,
offering the free use of his Menlo Park mansion
and hot tub. He got laid three times that week.
Roxy doesn't know if these girls were hot or just
as horny as he was.
