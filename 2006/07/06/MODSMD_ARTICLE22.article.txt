# A Letter from the Entertainment Editor
## Welcome to the Jungle The Man, the Myth, the Legend. The Intermission editor formerly known as Victor.
### 
I'm back! After an absence of nearly a
month, I, Victor, supreme overlord of the
Entertainment (previously known as
Intermission) pages of The Stanford Weekly
would like to graciously welcome all of you
to what is sure to be a rollicking good time.
In case you weren't reading that sentence
with a British accent, try reading it over
again — I think it adds an air of quality that
I guarantee will weave its way into the
upcoming issues.
I want to impress upon all of you faithful
readers that I will do my best to preserve
the high moral standards and rules of good
taste that normally regulate the entertain
ment pages. I promise that I will continue
and even expand upon our traditions of

wholesome family fun. That said, I would
also like to remind our readers that we here
at Intermi...er, I mean, the "Entertainment"
page, have an unusual sense of humor,
which will more than likely offend you,
especially if you are a fan of Paris Hilton.
We will be ripping her a new one as often as
the opportunity presents itself, which, if
you're familiar with the blonde bimbo, is

more often than not.
Over the next few weeks, the crack com
mando team I have assembled — consider
them the A-Team of entertainment — will
be bringing you up-to-the-minute movie,
album, book, concert and your best friend's
girlfriend reviews so that you can always be
the coolest kid on the block. In fact, we're
going to keep you so up-to-date on all the
happenings in the entertainment realm (at
least the ones that matter, because who real
ly cares about Britney Spears anymore?)
that the world may actually start revolving
around you.
So, sit back. Relax. Crack open a cold
one, and turn up the music. Things are about
to get funky.
