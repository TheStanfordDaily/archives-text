# CAMPUS 'FUN' LIFE
## Another summer, another remake 
### RYAN LAMPE ENTERTAINMENT AUSSIE 
In the summer of 1994, a local Australian cinema that specialized
in playing cult and classic movies was screening "Friday the 13th Part
III" in 3-D. The 3-D gimmick and the timing (on a Friday the 13th)
were irresistible, so my friends and I fronted up a few minutes before

the start time, expecting very lit
tle interest in the film.
Alas, the cinema was packed
and we had to settle for very
mediocre seats! I was astounded.
The decidedly old-fashioned
"Valhalla" was not a small the
ater and filling it was no simple
task. Yet the second sequel in the
one of the least imaginative hor
ror franchises of the 1980s had
managed to fill the place to
capacity. From then on, I've
always believed that it's impossi
ble to predict what audiences
want to see. At the very least,
what Australians want to see.
Fast forward 12 years and I
find myself in another 3-D
extravaganza, and once again the
cinema is packed. This time, my
friends and I are watching
"Superman Returns" in IMAX,
and despite turning up over an
hour before start time, we have
mediocre seats.
The film is hopelessly under
whelming and the 3-D effects
pathetic. Nevertheless,
"Superman Returns" got me
thinking about current trends in
Hollywood. Part sequel, part
remake and part homage to
Richard Donner's original

"Superman" movie, Singer's latest offering has all the trappings of a
Hollywood blockbuster. In a period when Tinseltown can't produce
enough remakes and sequels, what could be better than a movie that
is both a remake and a sequel?
Well, a good movie is not a bad place to start. What is particular
ly irksome about "Superman Returns" is how much it takes from the
original movies and how little it does with it. If I really wanted to see
Superman and Lois fly around Metropolis in the middle of the night,
I could just watch the first movie on DVD. And if I really wanted to

see Lex Luthor amass real estate under completely nonsensical cir
cumstances, I could do the same. The whole thing just seems rather
pointless to me. But, of course, it's not pointless. Not from the stand
point of revenue-hungry studios.
It would be nice to bash Hollywood at this point, but that
wouldn't be entirely fair. Contrary to popular belief, Hollywood stu
dios aren't trying to make atrociously unimaginative films. They're

just wrestling with what screen
writer William Goldman ("Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid",
"The Princess Bride") calls the
"Nobody Knows Anything" prin
ciple: the simple idea that movie
returns are highly unpredictable.
The astonishing demand for
"Friday the 13th Part III" back in
1994 reflects this principle.
Sequels and remakes are an obvi
ous reaction to studio uncertain
ty. After all, these studios are in
business to stay in business. If
you had the option of spending
$100 million on a historical epic
about the drafting of California's
Constitution or on "Spider-man
3," I think you'd choose the lat
ter. I know I would.
But is an endless stream of
sequels really such a bad thing?
In the rush to continue successful
franchises, or remake old TV
shows, one might be concerned
that studio funds are being
diverted from small and brilliant
movies like "Capote" or "The
Squid and the Whale." This is a
valid point. I would argue,
though, that there are always
enough great movies to outweigh
the bad ones. You just have to
look for them and realize that

they re often outside the studio system. You could, for example,
spend the rest of your life watching great foreign cinema like "2046"
or "Maria Full of Grace." Furthermore, I don't think sequels are cre
atively bankrupt by default. In 2004, some of the best movies were
in fact sequels. "Before Sunset," Richard Linklater's sequel to
"Before Sunrise" was pure genius, as was "Spider-man 2."
I ma little less convinced about the need for remakes. I under-
