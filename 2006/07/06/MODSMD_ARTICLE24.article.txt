## How to catch a cougar dead or alive 
### NATE SOLON 
You hear about them now and
then, big cats haunting the hills.
Every so often somebody runs
afoul of one and they have to hunt
it down. You see them on the news,
a visceral reminder of primordial
nature roaming above the Silicon
Valley.
Felis concolor, also known as the
mountain lion. Largest of its genus,
and most agile: with a twitch of its
back it springs into the uppermost
branches of a tall tree. A good swim
mer too, though it dislikes the water;
solitary by nature, a loner, a prowler.
Yet felis concolor is not the only
cougar to haunt the hills surround
ing our green enclosure, nor even
the most dangerous. Another
species of cougar also roams these
hills, tawny, solitary, known above
all else by a predatory gleam in its
roving eye. In these respects it
resembles the conventional cougar.
To distinguish it one must look else
where: to the artificially enlarged
mammary glands, the nicotine
scorched epidermis. Though not as
accomplished a jumper, this second
species of cougar is, in the long run,
by far the more dangerous. Its pre
ferred haunts: out of the way bars.
Its favorite feast: the blood of young
men.

It rarely hunts in packs, prefer
ring the pleasures of solitude.
Nocturnal by nature, it circles the
shadows just out of sight until its
prey has lost its wits and inhibi
tions. And even then it does not
strike swiftly and honestly like a
cheetah, where at least there is an
end. It insinuates, circling closer, a
decaying orbit, millennia before the
final plunge. But as soon as you
relax—suddenly a wet, acrid
tongue nuzzles your ear.
Strangest of all, it grows fiercer
with age. Weathered matrons, old
enough to be your mother, stalk the
moonlight. Still, some develop a
taste for its seasoned flesh. They
swear that, like a fine wine or a
rank cheese, age makes it better.
On a Friday night not long past,
two friends and I ventured to the
Pioneer Saloon in Woodside, our
home for the summer. Woodside
— gorgeous, affluent, considered
one of the best biking locales in the
country. Cougars plentiful.
The doorman, his gray hair
cropped close to his head, exam
ined our IDs. You're not 21, he
said. "What?" roared my friend.
After years of faking, now that
we're really legal, even the hint of
doubt sparks indignation. And, in
fact, he realized his mistake and
waved us in.

And just like that we were in the
cougar's den. A whirlwind of lipstick
and cigarettes, rock-a-billy, Smirnoff
Ice and facial hair. Everyone, it
appeared, was at least six drinks
deep and 40 years in. After a few
frenzied moments, we retreated to a
far-off table with a few bottles of
beer to talk amongst ourselves. But
if we thought we were out of the
woods, we were mistaken. Two
felines followed us out and took
seats at the table next to ours.
They were not what you would
call perfect specimens. Haunchy
and watery-eyed, they chatted with
the cool confidence of predators,
while we exchanged skittish
glances.
An old Somali proverb says a
brave man is frightened three times
by a lion — when he first sees its
tracks, when he first hears its roar,
and when he first meets it face-to
face. Had cougars lived in Somalia,
or Somalians in California, they
might have said the same about
them. We had tracked the beast
and had heard its song impassively.
But we were not ready to meet it
head on. We quailed in its musky
proximity and turned tail.
We fled to a well-lit bar in San
Mateo, there to perform the famil
iar mating rituals of our own
species.
