## Brokaw urges grads to engage reality Former NBC anchor invokes sacrifice of the Greatest Generation to guide students 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
Despite initial uncertainty and controversy during the ren
ovation of Stanford Stadium, the University's 115 th com
mencement ceremony went as usual, June 18, beginning with
the much-celebrated Wacky Walk.
Graduates stormed Elliott Field, the stadium substitute,
clad in everything from bikinis to flip-flops. Costumes ranged
from Looney Tunes characters to President Bush and World
Cup soccer. Bathrobes were also popular, as well as wearing
little more than waterproof sunscreen.
Former NBC News anchorman and author Tom Brokaw
addressed the 16,000 guests and over 1,700 graduates on
Father's Day. Brokaw's main message was that in a society dic
tated by laptops, email and cell phones, "it's also important to
remember that it will do us little good to wire the world if we
short-circuit our souls."
In a time when changes are taking place at such a rapid
pace, it is easy to seek opportunities in "virtual experiences,"
while "sitting in front of a screen or at a keyboard," Brokaw
said. He challenged students to make a difference, to recog
nize the difficult times—specifically, the war in which we find
ourselves—and try to improve them.
While Brokaw took part in the celebration of commence
ment, he reminded the graduates of others of the same age
who did not have the opportunity to join them "in this place of
privilege and promise... and [who] volunteered to risk their
lives if necessary to ensure your security and to defend this
country."
Brokaw encouraged graduates to follow the role of their

grandparent's generation, who sacrificed so much for their
country 50 years ago.
"They lived in the real world and they took responsibility
for it," Brokaw said. "They did not attach themselves simply to
a virtual experience and find satisfaction in a search engine.
They were boots on the ground, hands in the dirt, nights in
scary places, healing and courageous. They stepped into the
unknown and they made it more welcoming for the rest of us."
Graduating senior Crissy Iglesias enjoyed Brokaw's speech
overall, but felt it strayed too much into the political.
"At times, it became too politically charged, which I didn't
really think was appropriate for this type of forum," she said.
"Graduation's not the place to draw political lines."
According to the University Registrar, of the 1,706 who
accepted bachelor's degrees, 65 were given dual bachelor's
degrees, 452 were given minors and
155 accepted both a bachelor's and a master's degree.
Additional seating was offered in nearby Maples Pavilion due
to the overflow of guests. This audience of 300 watched the
ceremony via large-screen videos inside the air-conditioned
pavilion.
In addressing the audience, Brokaw discussed the patrio
tism and optimism graduates sitting in the same seats at the
turn of the previous century encountered. Those young gradu
ates were not only empowered with electricity, telephones and
new modes of transportation, but were also introduced to
world war. However, it was also a time of challenging both
political and scientific barriers, he said.
While introducing the 2006 graduates to today's society,
Brokaw encouraged students to seek a "life away from the
keyboard, the PDA and the cell phone... in which you connect
to the Web sites of your personal convictions."
"The speech overall had a decent message of disconnecting

tially met with opposition from some students, but the television icon addressed these complaints in a joking fashion.
