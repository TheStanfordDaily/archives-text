### AMIN EL GAMAL 
A construction worker fell to his death dur
ing renovation of the Stanford Stadium, June 2,
according to Vance Brown Builders, the Palo
Alto-stationed contractor overseeing the
reconstruction.
"This is a tragic event and our thoughts and
sympathies are with his family, friends and
coworkers," said Alan Acosta, the
University's associate vice president for public
affairs.
The initial investigation showed the incident
was an industrial accident and that no foul play
was involved, the Santa Clara Sheriff's
Headquarters told The Daily. The case has
subsequently been left to the California
Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), which could not be
reached for comment.
"We are all immensely saddened by this loss
and we would like to extend our deepest sym
pathies to his family, friends and the numerous
individuals that have worked with him in the
past," said Phil Capin, a construction manager
for Vance Brown Builders.
The Santa Clara County Coroner's Office
released the man's identity as Michael Carter,

26, of Stockton. Carter fell backward off a
steel beam while working in the bleachers at
9:35 a.m., according to The San Jose Mercury
News.
"His job was to guide steel beams into
place," said Dean Fryer, a spokesman for
OSHA, in the Mercury News.
Paramedics were on the scene in less than
five minutes and pronounced Carter dead
immediately, according to Capin. Investigators
from the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Headquarters and OSHA were on the site
most of Thursday, investigating the fall.
Capin emphasized that safety is Vance
Brown Builder's first concern, citing the com
pany's "excellent safety record" on CBS 5
News. The death is the 74-year-old company's
first.
"We are working with investigators and we
do believe that we were in compliance," Capin
said, referring to safety regulations.
Capin declined to comment on specific safe
ty measures and Carter's previous training and
work experience, but he told CBS that Vance
Brown has formulated a meticulous safety pro
gram specifically for the Stanford Stadium ren
ovation.
All of the 275 to 300 workers at the stadium
were permitted to take the remainder of the
day off and, according to Capin, most of the
employees left by noon.
Grief counseling will be provided for those

who want it, he said.
Apparently, this was the only setback for
the $85 million project. The stadium is still slat
ed for a September 16 grand opening, Capin
said.
According to the Stadium's website
(www.stanfordstadium.com), the upper bowl
seat installation has just been completed. The
renovation is on a rapid track; between

November 26 and September 16, workers will
have reduced the 1921 stadium seating from
85,000 to 50,000 and lowered the seating for
improved sight lines, according to the Mercury
News.
July marks the beginning of field installa
tion and the sale of 2006 Stanford Football
individual game tickets, according to the web
site.
