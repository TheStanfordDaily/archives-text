## Ironmen face toughest challenge 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Rivaling the Man of Steel, five Stanford stu
dents with Superman-like strength and
endurance completed the 2.4-mile swim, 112-
mile bike and 26.2-mile run at the Ironman
Coeur d'Alene (IMCDA), June 25 in Idaho.
These "men of iron" — Thomas Lee, Kendall
Wu, Elad Benjamin, Dan Witte and Filip
Crnogorac — trained for over eight months for
the competition; several of their teammates,
including Stanford Triathlon Team Head
Coach Sherry Smith, could not race due to
injury.
"It's really hard to describe — you go
through the full range of emotions during the
Ironman," said fourth-year electrical engineer
ing doctoral student Lee. "Excitement, anxiety,
sadness, anger, elation, euphoria — you name
it. I felt it all at some point that day."
Crnogorac, also an electrical engineering
doctoral student, commented that his favorite
part of the race was the lake swim.
"Even though the swim looked like we
were on a fish farm, surrounded by 2000 pairs
of arms and legs flailing all around you, there
was this sense of tranquility, the calming
silence of the cold lake waters," he said. "I was
expecting to go through a huge mental roller
coaster during the race, but the only thing
going through my head was 'Damn, this is a
long race; it just never ends.' I ended up filling
the time on the bike by singing to myself,
sometimes out loud, which kind of freaked out
other competitors."

Benjamin said that he crossed the finish line
with so much adrenaline that it still hasn't sub

sided.
"Ironman Coeur d'Alene was my first
Ironman, and even a week later I'm still ener
gized by what happened," Benjamin said. "The
journey, the starting line, the bike, the run —
everything is still in my head. All I can think
about now is when I'll do the next one."
Lee noted that he had to be careful to pace
himself during the race because the tempera
ture was a scorching 92 degrees Fahrenheit.
"The dropout rate was an unusually high 12
percent, so I feel pretty good having finished,"
he said.
Wu, a postdoctoral fellow in the department
of developmental biology, felt that he was not
sufficiently prepared for the high temperatures,
especially during the run.
"While I didn't have a great race, I still did
enjoy myself immensely," Wu said. "The most
important thing about the Ironman is the jour
ney that one goes through in preparing for the
race. You sacrifice your social life and sleep, but
it's all worth it when you step up to the starting
line. The race is the culmination of all that hard
work, which is why it doesn't matter whether
you are the first or last person to finish."
One of the most memorable aspects for the
participants of IMCDA was the support of the
town and event volunteers, which included

4,000 local residents.
"During the race, the course is lined with
people cheering you on, especially that last
quarter mile to the finish line," Wu said. "The
amount of energy that you draw from all that is
amazing."
Lee remembered feeling very welcome in
Coeur d'Alene by the locals, some of whom set
out their sprinklers so that the athletes could
run under them to cool off.
"The way that spectators decorate the
course is inspiring," Lee said. "Along one
stretch of the route, you see almost a half mile
of signs, one right after the other, that encour
age people. A lot of them are very touching —
messages from kids to parents, husbands to
wives, friends to friends. It's encouraging just to
read the signs, even when they're not meant for
you. It makes you feel that you're part of some
thing special."
Lee completed most of the marathon run
with Army Major David Rozelle. After a road
side bomb hit his Humvee in Iraq, Rozelle had
been fitted with a prosthetic for his amputated
right foot.
"I saw [Rozelle] on the run just as I was
ready to give up and start walking," Lee said. "I
