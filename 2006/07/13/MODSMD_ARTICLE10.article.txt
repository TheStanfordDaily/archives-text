### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
Among more than 170 hospitals appear
ing in the annual list of America's Best,
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
remained on the Honor Roll — within the
top 20 — for the fourth year in a row.
Perhaps more astounding than its consistent
place in the top tier is that it was founded
only 15 years ago, which makes it a baby rel
ative to freestanding and fully integrated
peers.
Each year, U.S. News and World Report

conducts a survey in order to aid patients in
choosing a hospital geared toward their spe
cific needs. This year, 200 board-certified
specialists from the American Medical
Association (AMA) were asked at random
to participate in the survey. Each specialist
selects up to five hospitals, regardless of cost
and location, as having the best pediatric
care in difficult cases. Individual hospitals
are then ranked based on 16 different pro
grams including cancer, heart and heart
surgery, respiratory diseases, pediatrics and
rheumatology. The Honor Roll consists of
top-ranking hospitals in all 16 programs.
Christopher Dawes, president and CEO
of Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, sees
the hospital's rapid rate of improvement

since 1991 as an accomplishment of all the
faculty and staff.
"It is not just the work of the past year,
but the past several years that has enabled us
to become nationally recognized," Dawes
said in an interview with The Stanford
Weekly. "We are fortunate to have the
opportunity to work with the Stanford
School of Medicine. This allows us to attract
nationally recognized faculty to a number of
programs, and in turn move these programs
to national standings."
In addition to the U.S. News ranking, the
hospital ranks first in California for pediatric
care and has received multiple national
awards over the past few years for
the quality of care provided to
patients.
The Leapfrog Group, an associa
tion of Fortune 500 companies and
other large employers, surveys hos
pitals and determines the quality
and safety of care provided to their
patients. This group represents
more than 34 million Americans
and more than $62 billion in health

care spending. The survey consists
of more than 850 hospitals and pro
vides information online for con
sumers to compare quality of ser
vice and health care.
Lucile Packard's was one of 12
hospitals out of 850 total to rank No.
1 for patient safety over the past few
years in the Leapfrog Survey.
In May 2006, the hospital
received its fifth award in less than
two years that recognized the hospi
tal's outstanding quality of patient
care — the Excellence in Patient
Safety and Health Care Quality
Award.
"This really speaks for the care
of patients, and our devotion to the

needs of each child," Dawes said.
While Lucile Packard's has taken
a seat next to other renowned pedi
atric hospitals such as John's
Hopkins Hospital, the Cleveland
Clinic and Duke University Medial
Center, Dawes continues to strive
for improvement.
"We have a responsibility to the
broader community to do the best
we can with the resources we have
available," he said. "Our goal by
2010 is to be top five in the nation.
We will continue to devote quality
care to each patient and strive to
improve the resources and research
within each program in order to bet
ter serve our community."
