## Research helps fight Down Syndrome Identification of gene responsible for illness sets ground for new experiments 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
After 20 years of research, scientists
from the Stanford School of Medicine and
the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
have identified a gene that may be respon
sible for mental retardation in individuals
with Down syndrome. This new research
links the over-expression of amyloid pre
cursor protein, known as App, to abnor
mal neural transport and neural degenera
tion.
According to the National Down
Syndrome Society, 350,000 families in
America are affected by Down syndrome.
One out of 733 babies is born with the con
dition, which is caused by an extra copy of
the 21st chromosome.
The research team used mouse models
of Down syndrome to show that an
increased dose of App "acts to markedly
decrease NGF [nerve growth factor]," a
molecule released by a neuron's target in a
process known as retrograde transport.
This causes degeneration of critical neu
rons, stated the research paper, which was
published in the July 6 issue of Neuron.
Neural deterioration is a factor in the
cognitive dysfunction that afflicts individu
als with Down syndrome, and possibly
Alzheimer's disease as well.
Neurologist William Mobley, a profes
sor in the School of Medicine, is the senior
author of the paper. He directs the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital's Down
Syndrome Center and the University's
Neuroscience Institute.
Mobley described his research team's
task in a telephone interview with The
Stanford Weekly.
"We began with the idea that you could
quantify very carefully the changes in the
brains of these mice with Down syn
drome," he said. "In this really complex
mouse, you start with a definite abnormal
ity and try to trace it down to a gene."
"In this case, we traced it down to an
extra copy of this gene. The mouse has an
extra chromosome, and so one gene in that
extra chromosome seems to make a big
difference," Mobley continued.
Researchers said that this discovery
might also be applicable to Alzheimer's
disease, as, according to primary author
and senior research scientist Ahmad

Salehi, the pathophysiologies of both con
ditions are similar.
Mobley outlined three ways in which
this breakthrough is significant.
"First, this shows we can trace down
abnormalities to specific genes," he said.
"It makes clear that this is a real abnor
mality that fundamentally affects the
brain, and we really just have one gene that
can make a difference."
"Second, now that we know the gene,
we can now know what the mechanism is
and can make other drug targets," Mobley
continued. "And third, App itself is a tar
get. It's probably the first realistic target
that has been found for Down syndrome."
Salehi discussed how the identification
of this gene furthers the understanding of
Down syndrome.
The completion of this research, he
said, means that "we can break this com
plex syndrome into sub-phenotypes and
relate those to triplication of different
genes."
In addition, the findings emphasize the
potential dangers of App over-expression
during critical periods of development or
aging.
Salehi described the research process as
"very collaborative and multidisciplinary,"
as the team of six active researchers joined
forces with groups across the country to
complete the study.
"In addition, many different methods
from stereology to real-time PCR to Q-
Dots were needed to achieve our goals,"
he said.
Salehi discussed the next step for the
research team.
"Now that we know what is happening,
we have to understand how it is happen
ing," he said. "A major task for us is to
understand the mechanism by which App
over-expression leads to decreased NGF
transport."
"The hope is that now we have a target
for therapy at least in our mice," Salehi
said, adding that the researchers hope to
be able to reduce App levels pharmacolog
ically.
Mobley said that he hoped this research
would lead to a better understanding of
Down syndrome in humans as well.
"We'd like to push for clinical trials," he
said. "But that's going to be a while —
there's a lot of work to do between now
and then."
Mobley called the research "tedious
and very hard work," but acknowledged
the "terrific" post-doctoral students on the
research team, particularly first authors
Salehi and Jean-Dominique Delcroix.
