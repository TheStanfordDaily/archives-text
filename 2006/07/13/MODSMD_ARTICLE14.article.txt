## Soccer: Why we don't care 
### 
The World Cup always brings a
certain margin of hand-wring
ing over Americans' dispas
sion for soccer. With the widest
sports pallet this side of Australia,
Americans have plenty on the tube
and in the stadiums to keep them
busy, yet some continue to express
surprise and shame that the U. S. of
A. prefers to limit its sports within
national borders.
With baseball on now and football
fast approaching, I will confess to
such indifference. In my mind, the
most exciting aspect of the tourna
ment was the release of latent
German patriotism - something other
nations have largely disapproved of
since the end of World War 11.
We keep hearing that maybe
Americans don't understand soccer. I
can think of a few things about "met
ric football," some benign and some
hostile, that come off as quite foreign
to the American sports viewer:
— Timekeeping: A clock that
ticks up instead of down and that no
one can be bothered to stop in dead
ball situations, and to which it seems
extra time can be added to at the offi
cial's own discretion. No one except
the zebra ever knows how much time
is actually left in the game. It is quite
a departure from the tightly-regi
mented structure of American sports.
— A team (say, the USA) can go
two entire games without mustering
even one shot on goal.
— A third-place game: Not that it
isn't exciting to keep playing, but the
NFL got rid of this early in the Super
Bowl era.
— Not being able to use hands: It
just seems unnatural to me, and I
don't think I'm alone on this.
— Faked injuries: Miraculous
cures have occurred in soccer games,
when an "injured" player realizes he
hasn't received an ejection and is res
urrected from the stretcher to contin
ue competition. An easy solution to
fake injuries is to disqualify any play
er who has to leave the field.
— Flopping: Not that there isn't
acting in basketball, but the way
some of these guys go down when
breathed upon makes you wonder
how they were coordinated enough
to make the team to begin with - or
why they aren't in a theater company
instead. Hockey has well-enforced
diving rules to discourage such thes
pian liberties.

To put a sour cherry on top of
things, there was the Zinedine
Zidane incident. The Frenchman
was ejected from the World Cup
final for head-butting an opposing
player during extra time. France
ended up losing the Cup title to Italy,
but Zidane still won the Golden Ball
Award for the tournament's best
flayer. Allegations are inconclusive
at deadline, but it appears that
Zidane used his melon in response to
an on-field insult from an Italian
player.
I would like to think the award
was some kind of mistake; maybe the
votes were taken too early. It is dis
turbing to think that such behavior
could be overlooked, particularly in
light of the fact that his team then
lost the biggest game of the tourna
ment.
Baseball writers might elect the
mercurial and possibly juiced up
Barry Bonds MVP, but it's hard to
imagine them rocking the vote for
someone who forgoes his teammates
and loses his cool at the most critical
moment in order to settle a personal
grudge.

the southern hemisphere's Trinatwis
