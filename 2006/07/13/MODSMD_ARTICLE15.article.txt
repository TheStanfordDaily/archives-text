## Stanford beats Cal in the Biggest Game of all The 						Cardinal wins the yearlong Lexus athletic competition 
### JENNA COALSON SPORTS EDITOR 
Stanford may have lost to Cal in last year's
Big Game. But while they might have won the
battle, we won the larger war.
For the second year in a row, Stanford won
the Lexus Gauntlet.
Sponsored by the Northern California
Lexus Dealers, the Gauntlet is awarded to the
overall champions of one year's worth of Bay
Area rivalry between Stanford and Cal.
Points to win the challenge were awarded
during every head-to-head varsity competition
between Stanford and Cal and for conference
championships when the teams did not meet.
The sports included baseball, basketball, field
hockey, football, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse,
soccer, swimming, volleyball and water polo.
Cal took the lead in the fall thanks to wins
in women's soccer, field hockey and football.
But Stanford launched forward during the
winter and spring, overtaking Cal after victo

ries from the men's and women's gymnastics
teams in late March. The Cardinal finished the
year with 77.5 points over the Golden Bears'
57.5 points.
In other words, a blowout.
Interim Athletic Director Bill Walsh
accepted the one hundred and fifty pound,
pewter-gilded trophy on June 28, saying:
"Stanford has a long athletic tradition that
goes back to 1892 and our first win over Cal.
We're pleased that Lexus is adding another
level to our competitive athletic spirit with the
Lexus Gauntlet Trophy."
The Lexus Gauntlet also provides a schol
arship for outstanding sportsmanship to a stu
dent of each school. This year it was awarded
to Stanford's Alice Barnes, a senior on the
Tennis team. Barnes is a four-time Ail-
American who helped the Cardinal win three
consecutive national titles.
The award presentation was attended by
the Stanford band, the athletic staff and a 2006
Lexus GS 430.

Jenna Coaison is considering failing her senior
year so she can stick around Stanford a little
longer. Email her at jcoalson@slanford.edu.
