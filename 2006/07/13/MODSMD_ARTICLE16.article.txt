# SUMMER TRAVEL
## Watching the final in Berlin 
### NINA GONZALUDO PHOTO EDITOR 
Berlin! Berlin! Wir fahren nach Berlin!
Unvergesslich. One of the words that flashed
across the screen after the final game perfectly sums
up the World Cup for me — unforgettable. I'm still
not over the delirium I felt when the Azzurri lifted
the Cup — a feeling beyond what you can get from
any German beer. I spent a good seven hours on July
9th at Berlin's Fan Mile, a stretch of road packed
with big screen TVs and crazy fans where I've
watched most of the World Cup matches.
As expected, Sunday was particularly packed.
With Italy playing France in the Berlin stadium, tick
etless fans from around the world flocked to the Fan
Mile to catch the Final. We joined in on the pre-game
madness: taking pictures with strangers, trying to get
on TV and following fans who we thought had
invented their own country, only to be disappointed
upon learning that their flag actually belonged to the
Spanish club team " Athletico Bilbao." As the kickoff
drew nearer, we settled on a spot near the side
between some Italians and a group of Germans, who
understandably supported France after having been
defeated by Italy's undeniably last-minute goals.
The Final itself was admittedly mediocre. Both
teams showed sparks of footballing brilliance in pre
vious matches, but neither team had begun the
World Cup as a favorite to win. The majority of fans'
first choices for the winning team were out, so many
had to pick sides. Most Germans and Germany-sup
porters (my fellow interns included) picked France.
As an AC Milan fan, and with Andrea Pirlo playing
well, I followed Italia. I wasn't disappointed of
course, but I wasn't exactly impressed. And neither
were the fans.
Besides a few "I-tal-ia!"s and
"Allez Les Bleus!"s, the long
awaited Final lacked the passion of
other games. When it came down to
it, with a few exceptions, Italy
played well in defense and France
pushed forward. And the result?
The ugly sending-off of a legend
(my childhood hero, nonetheless)
at his last international match, fol
lowed soon after by Italy's expert
ly-taken PKs.
Despite all that, the Final quickly
led to celebration. And it wasn't just
the Italians. Everyone joined in. As
the DJ's pumped out the music, the
Italians danced with the French, but
also with the Germans, Mexicans,

Englishmen, Brazilians — anyone
and everyone joined in to celebrate
football.
There were tears and laughter
and flags of all nations flying in the
air. At that point everything seemed
unreal and bittersweet to me; a
happy ending, but an ending never
theless.
I can understand if others, espe
cially those back home, could forget
this World Cup. I'm sure the U.S.
national team's early exit did little to
win American fans over to the sport,
and I admit that there were plenty of
times when the "Beautiful Game"
turned ugly. Sure there was diving
and acting and a record number of

cards in one match, but there were
also plenty of good moments,
moments that reminded me of what
football is all about — Zizou play
ing like himself to knock out Brazil,
David Beckham bending it like,
well, Beckham; Germany playing
inspirationally with fantastic home
team support, and plenty of amazing
goals. And of course, the fans.
It's been an unforgettable month
here in Germany.
Danke Deutschland, vielen
Dank.
