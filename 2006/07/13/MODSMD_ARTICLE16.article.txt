# SUMMER TRAVEL
## Watching the final in Berlin

Berlin! Berlin! Wir fahren nach Berlin!
Unvergesslich. One of the words that flashed
across the screen after the final game perfectly sums
up the World Cup for me — unforgettable. I'm still
not over the delirium I felt when the Azzurri lifted
the Cup — a feeling beyond what you can get from
any German beer. I spent a good seven hours on July
9th at Berlin's Fan Mile, a stretch of road packed
with big screen TVs and crazy fans where I've
watched most of the World Cup matches.
As expected, Sunday was particularly packed.
With Italy playing France in the Berlin stadium, tick
etless fans from around the world flocked to the Fan
Mile to catch the Final. We joined in on the pre-game
madness: taking pictures with strangers, trying to get
on TV and following fans who we thought had
invented their own country, only to be disappointed
upon learning that their flag actually belonged to the
Spanish club team " Athletico Bilbao." As the kickoff
drew nearer, we settled on a spot near the side
between some Italians and a group of Germans, who
understandably supported France after having been
defeated by Italy's undeniably last-minute goals.
The Final itself was admittedly mediocre. Both
teams showed sparks of footballing brilliance in pre
vious matches, but neither team had begun the
World Cup as a favorite to win. The majority of fans'
first choices for the winning team were out, so many
had to pick sides. Most Germans and Germany-sup
porters (my fellow interns included) picked France.
As an AC Milan fan, and with Andrea Pirlo playing
well, I followed Italia. I wasn't disappointed of
course, but I wasn't exactly impressed. And neither
were the fans.
