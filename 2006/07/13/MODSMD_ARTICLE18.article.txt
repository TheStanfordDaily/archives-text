## Sketch Further Tales of the City Life in urban areas beats existence in suburbs 
### 
Somewhat disturbingly, it seems
as if I'm about to be evicted.
Whilst this is rather undesir
able, it does afford me an opportu
nity to meditate on merits of city
life. And thus, dear reader, you are
going to be the fortunate recipient
of my wise observations on urban
existence. Lucky you.
The aforementioned meritocratic
meditations arise since I must
decide whether to begin my hunt for
new dwellings within the glory of
the City, or amidst the misery of
suburbia.
As the more alert amongst you
may have spotted, I have a slight
predilection for the U over the —
maintaining the sort of prejudice
against awkward suburbanites that
only one born of a faith can have,
and likewise worshiping their urban
counterparts with the apocryphal
fervor of a convert.
There are, along with religious
principles, rational arguments for
preferring San Francisco. Foremost
amongst these is the fact that
(unlike, say, on the Stanford cam
pus) there is no significant section of
the population that holds you in
contempt. This is refreshing.
In fact, Fve noticed recently that
declaring one's status as a graduate
student in physics in the City tends
to arouse curiosity and interest
(sometimes even Interest), as
apposed to horror and a quick
change of subject.
On the other hand, I suppose one
should balance the irrational bigotry
of some undergraduates with the
fact that the ever present ruddy
glow of youth makes one feel young
as often as it makes one seem aged;
and many of us find that the chil
dren are (mostly) loveable in their
own way.
Still, illusions of youthfulness are
but a small step from being delu
sions of the same, so perhaps the
toddlers scrabbling around are not
such a draw after all. And, of course,
the appropriate comparison is not
between Stanford and the City, but
rather between the latter and the
likes of Palo Alto, Menlo Park or
Mountain View.
The suburban trio is lush
enclaves of wealth and good weath
er. There are parks and woods;
there are sidewalk cafes and fancy
restaurants, and there are a dozen
places to buy designer clothes and a
dozen more at which to buy organic,
vitamin-enhanced vegetable drinks
to spill on said clothes. There is,
however, no soul.
The suburbs are cold and barren
places. They take the diversity of
their denizens, and instead of

reflecting it, they shape it into little
boxes of conformity. Worse, the end
result is not reflective of a place, but
rather of that very worst of societal
traits — the drive to value conven
tion over anything else.
Cities, though, are different.
Every part of San Francisco feels
like itself, and more. Dynamics are
writ large in the fabric of urban life
— one can walk through a place one
day, only to find it a little different
the next.
What's more, while suburbia is
perhaps sufficient for the everyday
needs of the hoi polloi, a city pro
vides for even the quirkiest of
desires (and the kinkiest too).
Even better, everything is just
there. For the morning after,
there's no need to get in the car
and drive a few miles down the
road for breakfast, you can just roll
out of bed and stroll across the
street. And as for the night before,
well, bar hopping without drunk
driving is a feasible option when
there are more than three bars
within a four mile radius.
Needless to say I'm being terri
bly unfair to the suburbs. Cities are
conformal too. Everyone's a studied
individualist in the Mission and, to
be honest, the Marina has a lot in
common with a bad frat party.
The reason pretentious folks like
myself long for urban living has a
great deal to do with the fact that we
get to make snide comments about
the rubes out in the 'burbs. I mean,
I'm a physicist for God's sake. I
don't have a social life, why would I
care about the bars and the restau
rants, the cafes and the clubs?
So, should I move back down to
the Peninsula? It's convenient — I
wouldn't have to deal with the three
hours of commuting each day.
There would be no worrying distrac
tions (for example, fun) to keep me
from the books. I could stay late and
work at the department, truly
immerse myself in research and be
happily alone with just physics for
company...
Right, San Francisco it is then.

Disagree? Think suburban life is the
way forward? Email your reasons to
nnvins@stanford.edu, and I'll be sure
to treat them with the respect they
deserve.
