# SUMMER ON CAMPUS
## What's luck got to do with it? 
### 
It can be frustrating for spectators
when a soccer game —much
less a World Cup title like last
Sunday's between Italy and France
— is decided by penalty shootouts.
It can feel like the winner might as
well have been decided by flipping a
coin, and indeed, penalty shootouts
were introduced in 1968 to replace
the former practice of just that.
The World Cup isn't the only sit
uation where an outside observer
would think the competition came
down to luck. In our increasingly
winner-take-all society, there are
several situations where we use less
than totally satisfactory methods to
choose one winner from among
many deserving candidates:
Valedictorian: My brother
earned valedictorian status by
0.0027 GPA points, which translates

to a difference of about 0.2592 actu
al GPA points distributed over 24
six-week periods, or an average dif
ference of 0.0108 GPA points per
six-week period. But as any fresh
man chemistry student knows, when
grades are given to students with
one significant figure (A = 4, B =3
and so on), it doesn't make sense to
compare GPAs up to more than one
significant figure. This is especially
true in college, where grades are
often nebulous or based on curves
and subjectively graded essays.

College admissions: The College
Board echoes the common knowl
edge that "Many colleges get more
qualified applicants than they can
accept," and thus the end game of
admissions becomes similar to
penalty shootouts. If admissions
perfectly reflected merit and noth
ing else, then one would expect that
students meritorious enough to get
into a certain college also would get
into all colleges less exclusive than
that one. However, the fact that
sometimes people get into colleges
that are better than others they were
rejected from suggests that there's a
large effect of non-merit and idio
syncratic factors.
