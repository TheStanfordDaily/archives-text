## What's luck got to do with it? 
### 
It can be frustrating for spectators
when a soccer game —much
less a World Cup title like last
Sunday's between Italy and France
— is decided by penalty shootouts.
It can feel like the winner might as
well have been decided by flipping a
coin, and indeed, penalty shootouts
were introduced in 1968 to replace
the former practice of just that.
The World Cup isn't the only sit
uation where an outside observer
would think the competition came
down to luck. In our increasingly
winner-take-all society, there are
several situations where we use less
than totally satisfactory methods to
choose one winner from among
many deserving candidates:
Valedictorian: My brother
earned valedictorian status by
0.0027 GPA points, which translates

to a difference of about 0.2592 actu
al GPA points distributed over 24
six-week periods, or an average dif
ference of 0.0108 GPA points per
six-week period. But as any fresh
man chemistry student knows, when
grades are given to students with
one significant figure (A = 4, B =3
and so on), it doesn't make sense to
compare GPAs up to more than one
significant figure. This is especially
true in college, where grades are
often nebulous or based on curves
and subjectively graded essays.

College admissions: The College
Board echoes the common knowl
edge that "Many colleges get more
qualified applicants than they can
accept," and thus the end game of
admissions becomes similar to
penalty shootouts. If admissions
perfectly reflected merit and noth
ing else, then one would expect that
students meritorious enough to get
into a certain college also would get
into all colleges less exclusive than
that one. However, the fact that
sometimes people get into colleges
that are better than others they were
rejected from suggests that there's a
large effect of non-merit and idio
syncratic factors.

the job market as it is, getting or not getting a job can come down
to something like whether you wrote a hand-written thank-you
note for the interview. Being a good candidate for a job only gets
you as far as, say, a penalty shootout in a soccer game; that is,
being qualified only gets you entry to the ultimate contest, which
often is determined by seemingly trivial things like interview
clothes, resume formatting, or the embossing on your business
cards ("Oh my God, it even has a watermark...").
Contrast this with the many competitions where the winners
are clearly differentiated or where multiple winners are allowed.
For example, football and basketball tend to have greater point
differences between the winning and losing teams than soccer
does. The Phi Beta Kappa honor society seems a much fairer tra
dition than, say, naming a single college valedictorian. SAT scores
tend to spread out students fairly well, with the 50th percentile
around 1030, and many students receive perfect scores. Imagine
the havoc if we tried to choose an SAT 'winner' for each test
based on, say, playoff questions.
What this makes me think is that maybe when the game or
competition itself can't choose a winner, we should either change
the game so that it will more accurately differentiate between
competitors, or when possible, name more than one winner.
But then again, maybe those seemingly luck-based final com
petitions aren't as random as they seem. For example, Portugal's
goalkeeper Ricardo got angry with reporters who suggested his
record three penalty shootout saves were due to luck, replying "It
wasn't luck — watch the television." To an outside observer, the
shootout might seem entirely fortuitous; but when you've just
made a save, you know all the effort that went into it.
And that's the thing: being lucky isn't easy. It means pre-visit
ing the restaurant where your interview will be held to find out
where the bathrooms are and to choose what you'll order. It
means asking current employees what you can expect in the inter
view and sending that hand-written thank-you note. True, these
tasks have little to do with what the competition is thought to be
about, but what makes a good competitor is not only being good
at the game, but also caring enough to put effort into everything
else that might affect the outcome.

Andrea will be a senior in Math next fall and will attempt to give a
thoughtful reply to all responses and comments. She can he reached at
