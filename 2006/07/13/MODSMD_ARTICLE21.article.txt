# STUDYING ABROAD IN BERLIN
## We are the Germans Celebrating the end of a month of World Cup madness 
### JOHN SHEN COLUMNIST 
Sunday marked the end of the month
of World Cup. A month that started
with the first game, Germany versus
Costa Rica, which just happened to be at
9 AM, on the first day of finals (The
University Registrar clearly doesn't
watch any soccer). But, finals or not
(Sucks to that GPA!), I happily made the
750 my home for that first week (mad,
mad props to them, by the way, for giv
ing us crazy soccer fans a home on cam
pus). Having started the month in what
seemed like the only holdout of "cul
tured civilization" in an otherwise soc
cer-empty wasteland, it struck me as
funny that I should find myself in a
crowd of Italians singing "We are the
Champions" (Let me clarify: THEY
were singing) exactly one month later.
What a month it's been. What a con
trast, coming from Stanford to Berlin. I
even managed to get stuck in the
Newark Airport for a day in between.
Although I don't want to make too
many enemies with my first column,
suffice to say that New Jersey is not
somewhere you want to be stuck in for
a day, and regardless of what movies
say, you really don't meet girls that
look like Natalie Portman in the
Garden State.
Anyway, to top off my month of soc
cer, finals, traveling, and more soccer,

last Sunday, July 9th, was both the
homecoming celebration for the
German National Team at the Fan Mile
in Berlin and the Finals, France against
Italy, also here in Berlin.
The German team, fresh from beat
ing Portugal 3-1 for 3rd place in one of
their finer games to date, was welcomed
by a rock-star reception, quite literally.
They were serenaded, after being laud
ed by hundreds of thousands of scream
ing fans, by German R&B star (unbe
lievably not an oxymoron) Xavier
Naidoo, and a reggae band that per
formed a rousing rendition of Bob
Marley's "We're Jammin'" with the
alternate lyrics "Ve ah Germanz".
When I realized just exactly what they
were singing, I had to both try very hard
not laugh in public, and think very hard
to make sure I was actually sober.
Regardless, it was a great party,
minus the 90 degree midday heat and
the ridiculous crowd. And with the
cheering, the serenading, and, as has
been the case for the past month here,
everyone dressed in German national
jerseys and waving German flags, it
almost reminded me of my high school
homecoming celebrations... except
actually fun, of course.
Later on that evening, after Italy
won the Final and the tournament
(controversially, in typical Italian style),
the entire Berlin Fan Mile pretty much
degenerated into a giant techno-rave

with laser lights and fireworks, which
makes me wish more things I attended
did the same (Take a hint: Full Moon
on the Quad people). Meanwhile, on
the big screens where the games were
shown, displayed the somewhat apolo
getic text, "Here at the Fan Mile, We
are all Champions" as the Italians
beamed in the glory of their victory
with chants, songs, and for some rea
son, the first riff of "Seven Nation
Army" by the White Stripes (for the
third time in this column, I wish I was
kidding).
But now that the month of games is
finally over, those of us that have been
soccer crazy since the beginning of June
must find something else to fill our lives
with. Luckily for me, Berlin's annual
nudist/techno/hippy congregation
known as Love Parade is just around
the corner. If you're not so lucky (i.e.
on campus), may I suggest Stanford's
annual Pirate Camp? Sure, it may not
be as fun as watching nudist hippies trip
out on E, and it may be a summer camp
for grade schoolers, but all of us are
kids at heart anyway right?
So put away those sad
French/German/US/Angolan flags and
start swashbuckling, mate. Yaaaaarrrrg!
