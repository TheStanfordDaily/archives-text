### NED HENNINGSEN SPECIAL CONTRIBUTOR 
PERUGIA. ITALY — On the morning of July 9, 2006, I
wake up and turn on the TV. On the screen is a woman
from Naples weeping over a wooden coffin bedecked with
flowers. Dear God, what an ominous start to the day. But watching
further I see the woman turn her wrinkled face up to the camera,
and say between sobs, "Tonight we will solemnly proceed through
the streets carrying this coffin and bury it in the sea." I notice that
on the coffin is written in blue, red and white letters- "FRANCIA".

Leaving my apartment at five
that afternoon, I find attached to my
door a flier with the words, "We give
you the happy announcement. After
90 minutes of drawn out agony the
useless existence of the French
Galletti will have ended. The funer
al procession will move from the
Berlin Stadium at 11 PM tonight." I
grab the flier, stuff it into my pocket,
dress in black, and depart.
"But should Italy really be so
cocky?" I wonder. France has the
rooster after all, not to mention
Zidane and Henry, the French soc
cer prophets who are the most capa
ble of defying the death decree from
Rome. But when I think about how
much the Italian team resembles the
Red Sox Idiots of 2005, I park my
thoughts and am reassured.
There isn't a spot in the entire
city where the game cannot be clear
ly heard.
I lead my group to the central
Piazza of the town where I've been

roommates. "Hey man," he says in
the local dialect, "I was just like you
in '82 [the last time Italy won the
world cup]." "Good god, I hope I'm
not like you in 2032," I think, and
after a brusque exchange of words,
he wanders away.
After Zidane slots the first goal
in the first 10 minutes — the ball
barely bouncing inside the goal line
— thanks to the foul committed by
Materazzi, the group I am with ceas
es to speak, much less breathe, and I
think it would have been that way
the whole game if Materazzi hadn't
so poetically made up for his error
by heading in Italy's tying goal mere
minutes later.
Thinking about what would have
happened to him if he hadn't made
the goal brings to mind the story of
an Englishman who, playing for
Lazio in a crucial derby game
against Roma, scored and subse
quently began to weep. Asked after
wards why he wept, he responded.

"because of what they would have
done to me if I hadn't scored." Lazio
is a notoriously right leaning (read:
fascist) team. Naturally, the next day
he was mugged by a group of
marauding leftist nuns.
Returning to the game, now tied,
we chant the patriotic words,
"French bastard," to the beat of the
White Stripes song, Seven Nation
Army. It goes, "I'm gonna fight em
off/ A seven nation army couldn't
hold me back." Fact: number of
teams Italy had to play to get to the
final — 7.
We also sing the words, "Who
doesn't jump is French", and best of
all "Zidane, Zidane, son of a bitch".
Joining in these songs, I've made
friends with the Italians around me
who nonetheless remain suspicious
of my roommates, two of whom are
speaking in German, and one of
whom, Tom, my English roommate,
is chirping every once and awhile
"Allez les bleus!" ("Go
France!")...because he's simply let
himself go.
However, after an electric first
half, a tired Italian team falls back
into its hated defensive style of play
and simply ceases to attack. The
groans of the fans around me are
excessive but strangely beautiful,
and I think they somehow help to
keep Italy alive through a lackluster
second half and first supplementary
time. Finally, the second supplemen
tary time arrives in which Zinedine,
presumably provoked by Materazzi
— who is no doubt the man of the
match — head-butts him squarely
in the chest.

told there is a big screen. But, of
course, as I should have expected
from the Italians, when we show up
there are just two flat screen TVs,
with over 200 people packed
beneath each one.
The German girl with whom I'm
living looks at me as if I were a small
piece of schizer — she accidentally
put a stiletto in. "You're right," I tell
her, "if we were in Germany home
of the third place team there would
no doubt be bigger screens." She
about-faces and walks away.
Calcio, as soccer is called here,
can be a rough game.
I spend the beginning of the
match fending off an old drunken
man who has deemed this the per
fect occasion to smell my three girl

JUBILANCE: Rome's central
Piazza del Popolo filled with crowds
after Italy's Sunday win.

The chants pick up again more loudly than
ever, the referee expels him from the match
and we watch him walk directly past the Cup
itself as he leaves. The Italians, with a man
advantage and their chief adversary gone,
begin to regain hope.
We arrive at penalties, and we remind our
selves that in the past four World Cups, Italy
has been eliminated by penalty kicks. Every
time. However, 1, 2, 3, 4... 5! The Italian fan
ciulli nail every penalty kick, while French
star David Trezeguet hits the crossbar, the
ball bouncing barely outside the goal line.
Sometimes, it is just a crossbar and a matter of
inches one way or another that wins these
things.
At the final goal, Italy uncorks itself. I
scream myself hoarse and embrace as many
random strangers as I can. My French-rooting
English roommate Tom is punched in the face
by a stranger. My German roommate, who
has by now had a couple beers, apologizes for
hating me so much. The TV splits to show the
people of Naples burying France's coffin in
the sea, and the old molesting man is asleep in
a bush. Matterazzi is crying. No news yet

about any plan of action on the part of
France's nuns. The Italian National Anthem
begins to play.
"Where is' Victory?/Let her bow down,/
For God has made her/The slave of
Rome./ Let us gather in legions,/ Ready to
die!/Italy has called!"
We dance all night in a piazza packed with
flags, pink flares and thousands of Italians
decked out in red, green and white, or nothing
at all.
But what does all of this mean for Italy?
This World Cup victory will serve to unite a
nation divided between north and south, and
salvage the dignity of Italian soccer which has
recently been stained by the Serie A referee
fixing scandal which will see four of Italy's
powerhouse teams —Juventus, Milan, Lazio
and Fiorentina — fall to the lower leagues of
Italian soccer. Many of the now-champions of
the world, who remain contractually bound to
those teams, will fall with them in a dizzying
descent from the top of the soccer world to
the bottom, or next to it.
That, of course, would be the MLS, where
retiring French star Zinedine (Zizou) Zidane,
who somehow was still honored as the best
player of Germany 2006, is heard to be head
ed, but where head-butting another team's
player is still, unfortunately, highly illegal and
embarrassing.
In a country with many problems, it is
never really known if winning a world cup like
this really actually solves anything, or if it just
serves to distract the nation for a moment and
give it a reason to party 'till dawn, then take a
day off before going back to work.
Though it is true that millions upon mil
lions of Italian soccer jerseys have been sold,
I just checked the tag on mine (player name
— Cannavaro) and by some cruel hand of
fate, I find the label "Made in France." ■
