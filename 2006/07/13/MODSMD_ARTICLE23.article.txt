# Letters from Abroad
## Michael Wilkerson Life without the basics Bathing, electricity, trash pick-up and transportation are necessities Stanford students take for granted. Michael Wilkerson writes home about the challenges of living in a developing country 
### 
Kampala, Uganda — Suddenly the Draw no longer seems so unfair.
Admittedly I lucked out with 100 and Xanadu, but even those relegated
to four-class dorms and one room doubles are better off than I
originally thought. The worst dorm at Stanford (no names will be named) is
quite appealing at the moment.

Jokes are often made about the fact that
Stanford has more money than some small
countries, but I am experiencing it first
hand, and it no longer seems quite as com
ical. The longer I stay here, the more "the
farm" starts to resemble a resort in its lux
ury. Here in Kampala, thanks to years of
corruption and incompetent administra
tion, the government is dependent on for
eign aid for nearly half of its budget. The
population has grown much faster than
development, and basic services are mini
mal.
Electricity is intermittent at best, and
with the exception of the diplomats and
very wealthy who can afford to run genera
tors constantly, most people are forced to
deal with a system called load-shedding.
Keeping in mind that the majority of the
population is not even hooked up to the
grid; the way load-shedding works is that it
deals with the constant overdraw on the
available energy by arbitrarily scheduling
some areas to have power at certain hours
on certain days.
At my house, which is in a suburb that is
by no means well off, we are scheduled to
have power every other day, from about
3:00 PM to midnight but regularity is
nonexistent. Even in the rare week where
the electricity arrives at the time it is sup
posed to, the fact that it has just been off
for at least 24 hours means hot water is a
rarity, and one that I have yet to even see.
Bathing is quite a process in itself,
because, at least where I live, the pressure
is so low that it cannot quite make it all the
way out of the shower nozzle at much more
than a slow drip. The best thing to do when
trying to get wet, I have discovered, is to
crouch as low as possible and try to get
underneath the tap where the flow is slight
ly faster. Keep in mind that I am staying in
the metropolitan capital of the country,
and my house is far above the average even
for the city.
Sitting here and salivating about first
world amenities, the services Stanford pro
vides seem pretty incredible. Consider the
fact that very few students spend any time
picking up trash. It just disappears almost
magically. While there are a number of
environmentally conscious students who go
out of the way to put litter in trashcans, the
truth is that the University employs people
to pick up after us. Every weekend, an
untold multitude of red cups are used and
discarded across campus, but somehow
they all seem to be gone by Monday.
In Kampala the main trash disposal sys
tem is fire. The air is thick with the smell of

smoke at all hours of the day, and if you go
to the right places, you can witness giant
burning piles. Sanitation is improving;
most places no longer have open sewers.
But that's not exactly a cause for comfort.
The logistics of the Marguerite shuttle
system are also more impressive than they
used to be. Public transportation that oper
ates on a schedule with regular stops is
something that would be a major improve
ment in Uganda. There is cheap public
transportation, but it exists in the form of
"taxis" which are 14-person minibuses that
regularly pack 25 people inside at a time.
AH painted alike, they all start from a taxi
park in the middle of town, and go out
ward, leaving when they are full. When
they reach an end destination, which for
some is the outside of town, and others dis
tant villages, they load up and turn around
to go the other way. The only way to tell
where any particular vehicle is going is to
try and listen to the driver's assistant who
leans out the window and shouts the route
his car is taking to everyone he passes.
Along with numerous and erratic taxis,

transportation is also hindered by a com
plete lack of signs or traffic signals save a
few roundabouts, and it is amazing in my
mind that I have yet to witness an accident.
The roads are very rough: many areas have
holes that look like artillery hit though it is

really just heavy wear. My favorite part
though, is the seemingly übiquitous num
ber of small scooters and motorcycles
whose drivers carry passengers for a price
slightly higher than the "taxis." Called
boda boda, they are preferable to people
like me because even though they are
slightly dangerous they can skirt the traffic
jams and take you directly from one place
to another.
In spite of all of this complaining, I real
ly love Uganda. The people here are the
most friendly I have ever encountered, and
are always willing to help me, the mzungu
(stupid white foreigner) figure things out.
In fact, adjusting to the living situation here
has not been that hard. The only serious
difficulties I have really had were in work
ing with a quite patronizing member of the
U.S. Embassy who decided an American
college student was really not worth their
time of day.
I do not mean to denigrate the country;
things have come a long way over the last
20 years and will improve further. But liv
ing away from home has made me think
harder about what I really enjoy in the
U.S., and at Stanford in particular.
While at school, the nonstop assurances
about how lucky we are often blend togeth
er into a drone or can be forgotten in the
rush of classes and activities. To go over
just a few of the administration's talking
points, we are constantly encouraged to
appreciate the diverse range of programs,
prestigious faculty, research opportunities,
financial aid, advanced technology and ath
letic facilities the University provides.
That stuff is great; I'm sure we're a
world-class institution and so on, but at this
point I'm looking forward to getting back
to hot water and bright uninterrupted light.
Following my summer, my arrival at the
farm before school starts will be the real
vacation. After all, we are the happiest stu
dents for a reason, even if there is quite a
price tag.

Following my summer, my arrival at the
farm before school starts will be the real
vacation. After all, we are the happiest stu

price tag.

Kampala, Uganda — Suddenly the Draw no longer seems so unfair.
Admittedly I lucked out with 100 and Xanadu, but even those relegated
to four-class dorms and one room doubles are better off than I
originally thought. The worst dorm at Stanford (no names will be named) is
quite appealing at the moment.

Jokes are often made about the fact that
Stanford has more money than some small
countries, but I am experiencing it first
hand, and it no longer seems quite as com
ical. The longer I stay here, the more "the
farm" starts to resemble a resort in its lux
ury. Here in Kampala, thanks to years of
corruption and incompetent administra
tion, the government is dependent on for
eign aid for nearly half of its budget. The
population has grown much faster than
development, and basic services are mini
mal.
Electricity is intermittent at best, and
with the exception of the diplomats and
very wealthy who can afford to run genera
tors constantly, most people are forced to
deal with a system called load-shedding.
Keeping in mind that the majority of the
population is not even hooked up to the
grid; the way load-shedding works is that it
deals with the constant overdraw on the
available energy by arbitrarily scheduling
some areas to have power at certain hours
on certain days.
At my house, which is in a suburb that is
by no means well off, we are scheduled to
have power every other day, from about
3:00 PM to midnight but regularity is
nonexistent. Even in the rare week where
the electricity arrives at the time it is sup
posed to, the fact that it has just been off
for at least 24 hours means hot water is a
rarity, and one that I have yet to even see.
Bathing is quite a process in itself,
because, at least where I live, the pressure
is so low that it cannot quite make it all the
way out of the shower nozzle at much more
than a slow drip. The best thing to do when
trying to get wet, I have discovered, is to
crouch as low as possible and try to get
underneath the tap where the flow is slight
ly faster. Keep in mind that I am staying in
the metropolitan capital of the country,
and my house is far above the average even
for the city.
Sitting here and salivating about first
world amenities, the services Stanford pro
vides seem pretty incredible. Consider the
fact that very few students spend any time
picking up trash. It just disappears almost
magically. While there are a number of
environmentally conscious students who go
out of the way to put litter in trashcans, the
truth is that the University employs people
to pick up after us. Every weekend, an
untold multitude of red cups are used and
discarded across campus, but somehow
they all seem to be gone by Monday.
In Kampala the main trash disposal sys
tem is fire. The air is thick with the smell of

smoke at all hours of the day, and if you go
to the right places, you can witness giant
burning piles. Sanitation is improving;
most places no longer have open sewers.
But that's not exactly a cause for comfort.
The logistics of the Marguerite shuttle
system are also more impressive than they
used to be. Public transportation that oper
ates on a schedule with regular stops is
something that would be a major improve
ment in Uganda. There is cheap public
transportation, but it exists in the form of
"taxis" which are 14-person minibuses that
regularly pack 25 people inside at a time.
AH painted alike, they all start from a taxi
park in the middle of town, and go out
ward, leaving when they are full. When
they reach an end destination, which for
some is the outside of town, and others dis
tant villages, they load up and turn around
to go the other way. The only way to tell
where any particular vehicle is going is to
try and listen to the driver's assistant who
leans out the window and shouts the route
his car is taking to everyone he passes.
Along with numerous and erratic taxis,

transportation is also hindered by a com
plete lack of signs or traffic signals save a
few roundabouts, and it is amazing in my
mind that I have yet to witness an accident.
The roads are very rough: many areas have
holes that look like artillery hit though it is

really just heavy wear. My favorite part
though, is the seemingly übiquitous num
ber of small scooters and motorcycles
whose drivers carry passengers for a price
slightly higher than the "taxis." Called
boda boda, they are preferable to people
like me because even though they are
slightly dangerous they can skirt the traffic
jams and take you directly from one place
to another.
In spite of all of this complaining, I real
ly love Uganda. The people here are the
most friendly I have ever encountered, and
are always willing to help me, the mzungu
(stupid white foreigner) figure things out.
In fact, adjusting to the living situation here
has not been that hard. The only serious
difficulties I have really had were in work
ing with a quite patronizing member of the
U.S. Embassy who decided an American
college student was really not worth their
time of day.
I do not mean to denigrate the country;
things have come a long way over the last
20 years and will improve further. But liv
ing away from home has made me think
harder about what I really enjoy in the
U.S., and at Stanford in particular.
While at school, the nonstop assurances
about how lucky we are often blend togeth
er into a drone or can be forgotten in the
rush of classes and activities. To go over
just a few of the administration's talking
points, we are constantly encouraged to
appreciate the diverse range of programs,
prestigious faculty, research opportunities,
financial aid, advanced technology and ath
letic facilities the University provides.
That stuff is great; I'm sure we're a
world-class institution and so on, but at this
point I'm looking forward to getting back
to hot water and bright uninterrupted light.
Following my summer, my arrival at the
farm before school starts will be the real
vacation. After all, we are the happiest stu
dents for a reason, even if there is quite a
