ROXY SASS
ENTERTAINMENT SEX GODDESS
Spontaneous sex in public places seems like
the greatest fantasy of guys and girls alike.
Girls envision trysts in the sand on a secluded
beach with Brad Pitt while guys have dreams
of Jessica Alba clad in nothing but seashells
doing very bad, yet very good things.
Regardless of Roxy's own fantasies, there are
many myths out there about truly good sex.
Some may think that these situations would be
fun, but in reality they could be awkward,
painful and often go hand in hand with some
sort of disease. Considering the hot summer
months are often accompanied by hot flings,
or just horniness, here is a quick guide of sex
ual encounters, so that you can save yourself
some unwanted drama or venereal diseases.
MYTH: Sex on the beach is fun, hot and wild.
REALITY: Though spontaneous, steamy sex
on a beach is a fantasy of many sexually
promiscuous daydreamers, it's actually one of
the worst places to get down and dirty. Think
twice before doing the deed in sand. Not only
is it a public place where people can see
(unless you're into that type of thing) you can
also be arrested for indecent exposure. And
there is the sand. Getting naked in the sand
means sand in your crevices. The granules can
break a condom, making it possible to get
preggers. Also, a girl can get sand in "that"
area, leading to uncomfortable itching and
yeast infections. But, if you simply have to do
it on a beach, lay down a towel and save your
self the pain.
MYTH: The mile high club...it's better at the
top.
REALITY: As a frequent traveler, I can tell
you that an airplane bathroom is simply not
big enough for two people. In fact, it's hardly
big enough for one fat person. Airplanes tend
to be crowded, with people lining up the aisle
for a chance at the tiny bathrooms. But Roxy,
you say, what about a night-time, empty, six
hour flight? Well, if you happen to be so
lucky, go for it, but don't think it will be wild
and sexy. In fact, you will spend the majority
of the time trying to awkwardly find a way in
which to sit (or stand) and hump without
falling in the toilet or breaking a leg. Plus,
since when did it become sexy to do the deed
where others have done a number two? My
advice? Grab a blanket and pretend you are
sleeping on your significant others lap and
give them some mile-high oral stimulation.
MYTH: The hot tub: warm, bubbly, and
perfect for sex.
REALITY: You may think a hot tub is a
steamy (literally!) place to get it on, it's
actually a steaming pot of disgusting. It's
just the right temperature for circulating
water full of bacteria waiting to attack .your
most private areas. Because of its hot tem
perature, it actually reduces lubrication
inside the vagina or condom creating
uncomfortable and often painful sex.
Chafing is not what I would call romantic.
My suggestion is to get it on in the bedroom,
and enjoy a post-coital cuddle in the hot tub.
Or, if sex in warm water is your
thing, fill up the bathtub and
get it on with some scented
candles and Enya in the back
ground.
MYTH: The car: getting it on
1960's style.
REALITY: The reasons not to
have sex in a car are plentiful.
First, if the only place you can
get some is in a car, it probably
means that you live with your
parents. That is not sexy. What
was hot in high school simply
doesn't carry over to college.
The car poses more of a posi
tioning problem than anything
else. The front seat could mean
either a steering wheel or stick
shift in your ass, unless you're
into that (I personally have a
"nothing goes into my ass" rule
but I support the creative
expression of others). Even
though the back seat may seem
roomier, unless you are five foot
five or shorter, its not. I suggest
staying out of the car. Unless
you have a SUV with seats that
fold down, I'm not fucking in a
car.
MYTH: Elevators.
REALITY: Picture this. You and
your significant other/fiance/hus

band/fuck buddy (fill in the blank
with what applies to you) are feel
ing randy and decide that the
greatest place to relieve your
horny and get a cheap thrill would
be to do it in the nearest elevator.
However, in your daydream, the
elevator never stops to let people
on. Has anyone actually been on
this mythic elevator? If so, you're
lucky. Having sex on an elevator
would only be possible if you were
in an empty, forty-five story build
ing. In all other cases you have
about twenty-five seconds to do
the deed without possibility of
interruption. Elevators are in no
way sexy, unless you find that
mythic one. If you do, drop me a
letter.

So, what are some fun places
to have sex that aren't a bed, or
other cliche, boring, traditional
places? My advice is to have
some fun with it. If you are bored
with a low-key, at home sex-life,
mix it up. Put on some costumes
for role play, or add some toys to
your bedroom. Buy a kama sutra
card deck and make a game out
of it. If you have to do it in a
semi-public place, make a picnic
and do it in the woods. Lake Lag
is beautiful at night, especially
when the sun starts going down.
There are plenty of ways to
enjoy a spontaneous fuck with
out fear of pregnancy, disease,
infection, or arrest. Roxy says go
out into the world and find some
unique ways to spice up your sex
life!
