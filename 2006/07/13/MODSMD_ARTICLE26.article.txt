ROXY SASS
ENTERTAINMENT SEX GODDESS
Spontaneous sex in public places seems like
the greatest fantasy of guys and girls alike.
Girls envision trysts in the sand on a secluded
beach with Brad Pitt while guys have dreams
of Jessica Alba clad in nothing but seashells
doing very bad, yet very good things.
Regardless of Roxy's own fantasies, there are
many myths out there about truly good sex.
Some may think that these situations would be
fun, but in reality they could be awkward,
painful and often go hand in hand with some
sort of disease. Considering the hot summer
months are often accompanied by hot flings,
or just horniness, here is a quick guide of sex
ual encounters, so that you can save yourself
some unwanted drama or venereal diseases.
MYTH: Sex on the beach is fun, hot and wild.
REALITY: Though spontaneous, steamy sex
on a beach is a fantasy of many sexually
promiscuous daydreamers, it's actually one of
the worst places to get down and dirty. Think
twice before doing the deed in sand. Not only
is it a public place where people can see
(unless you're into that type of thing) you can
also be arrested for indecent exposure. And
there is the sand. Getting naked in the sand
means sand in your crevices. The granules can
break a condom, making it possible to get
preggers. Also, a girl can get sand in "that"
area, leading to uncomfortable itching and
yeast infections. But, if you simply have to do
it on a beach, lay down a towel and save your
self the pain.
MYTH: The mile high club...it's better at the
top.
REALITY: As a frequent traveler, I can tell
you that an airplane bathroom is simply not
big enough for two people. In fact, it's hardly
big enough for one fat person. Airplanes tend
to be crowded, with people lining up the aisle
for a chance at the tiny bathrooms. But Roxy,
you say, what about a night-time, empty, six
hour flight? Well, if you happen to be so
lucky, go for it, but don't think it will be wild
and sexy. In fact, you will spend the majority
of the time trying to awkwardly find a way in
which to sit (or stand) and hump without
falling in the toilet or breaking a leg. Plus,
since when did it become sexy to do the deed
where others have done a number two? My
advice? Grab a blanket and pretend you are
sleeping on your significant others lap and
give them some mile-high oral stimulation.
MYTH: The hot tub: warm, bubbly, and
perfect for sex.
REALITY: You may think a hot tub is a
steamy (literally!) place to get it on, it's
actually a steaming pot of disgusting. It's
just the right temperature for circulating
water full of bacteria waiting to attack .your
most private areas. Because of its hot tem
perature, it actually reduces lubrication
inside the vagina or condom creating
uncomfortable and often painful sex.
Chafing is not what I would call romantic.
My suggestion is to get it on in the bedroom,
and enjoy a post-coital cuddle in the hot tub.
