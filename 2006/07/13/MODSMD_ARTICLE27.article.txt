### VICTOR FUSTE ENTERTAINMENT DOG LOVER 
I'd like to take a moment, if I may, to
address what I think is becoming a rampant
problem in modern cinema. Dog eating. In
the last two big-budget blockbuster films I
have seen, "Superman Returns" and
"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's
Chest," hapless canines have met their
doom by means of ingestion. While I grant
that in "Superman Returns," —where the
victim was only an ankle-biting Pomeranian
—1 found it more humorous than disturbing;
after I saw "Pirates," I started to worry that
Hollywood had turned on man's best friend.
Eating dogs isn't new. Cultures around
the world have been doing it for centuries.
What's startling to me is that the consump
tion of Fidos has seeped its way into films
that are, for all intents and purposes, chil

dren's movies. The largest demographic of
moviegoers that go to see these two films are
not the over fifty, 1-like-Clint-Eastwood
movies crowd. No, the audience that goes to
see these films is still borrowing money from
their parents to go to the movies. (And that
goes for you college kids out there too. Who
do you think is paying for tuition, huh?)
This problem may seem trivial, if not
funny, to most, but think about it. I mean
REALLY think about it. These movies are
teaching little Timmy and Jane that it's okay
to take a bite out the family pet! If this prob

lem is not resolved soon we will be seeing a
preponderance of three-legged, and (dare I
suggest it?), two-legged dogs hobbling on
their leashes while little Timmy and Jane
chase after then with voracious appetites
and sharpened teeth.
So, I present a simple solution to this
problem. Hollywood has a very poor track
record of going back on something that it
has found profitable ("Star Wars" prequels,
anyone?) so the only solution is to substitute
dog eating for something else entirely. I pro
pose that instead of dog eating, films rely on
the consumption of something that is far less
disturbing, and if I may say so, far more con
structive to the fabric of American society.
Dogs have always represented domesticity
and by extension the fulfillment of the
American way. Thus, my proposition comes
in the form of a question. What exactly have
cats contributed to our way of life?
