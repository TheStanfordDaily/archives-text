While waiting for "A
Scanner Darkly" to
begin, I overheard an
elderly gentleman sit
ting behind me claim
that no filmmaker has
ever succeeded in bring
ing author Philip K.
Dick to the screen.
Quite an assertion given
the praise heaped upon
"Blade Runner," based
on Dick's 1968 novel
"Do Androids Dream
of Electric Sheep?" But
the gentleman is proba
bly correct. "Blade
Runner" is visually
stunning but it ignores
numerous themes from
Dick's novel. Less
revered adaptations,
like "Paycheck" and
"Total Recall," are pri
marily action vehicles

that use the author's
ideas merely as starting points. This is certainly not true of "A
Scanner Darkly," which is arguably the most faithful adaptation of
Philip K. Dick to date. A blend of comedy and tragedy, the movie

gleefully abandons main
stream appeal but the results
are decidedly mixed.
Set seven years into
the future, the movie focuses
on the dual identity of Bob
Arctor and Agent Fred
(Keanu Reeves). The for
mer is part of a household of
drug-users. The latter is an
undercover narcotics agent
who has infiltrated the
household to help identify

the source of sub
stance D, a lethally
addictive drug that
has enslaved a large
fraction of society.
Though Agent Fred
is only supposed to
pose as a drug user,
he has become heav
ily addicted to sub
stance D, causing
the two hemispheres
of his brain to func
tion independently.
The situation
escalates when one
of the household's
members (Robert
Downey Jr.) informs
the police that
Arctor is the very
source they are
searching for. Since
the identities of
undercover agents
are unknown, even
to the police, Fred's
is ordered to spy on
his other self. The
task proves difficult

for Fred as his addiction to substance D swells and he becomes
increasingly unable to distinguish between his dual role as drug user
and undercover agent.
Richard Linklater initially shot "A Scanner Darkly" like most
movies. However, the edited film was then animated frame by
frame to produce a visual style that is very non-mainstream and
reminiscent of the director's 2001 snooze-fest "Waking Life.
Production involved 23.5 days of live-action shooting and then 1.5
years in the office animating. Linklater claims that each minute of
the finished product represents 500 hours of an artist's time.
There is certainly no denying "A Scanner Darkly's" visual
appeal. Unlike "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow," the
film s look is more than a gimmick and never outstays its welcome.
The "Rotoscoping" technique has improved substantially since

"Waking Life" and allows for
more nuanced performances.
Regardless, none of the cast
members are playing against
type so their animated counter
parts are easy to accept.
Despite Reeve's presence, the
advertising campaign, and the
somewhat futuristic setting,
there is very little science-fiction
in "A Scanner Darkly." The
film is principally concerned
with drug-use and its conse
quences. Dick based the novel
on his own experiences in the
early 1970s when he lived semi
communally with other drug
users.
0 Indeed, both the book and
the movie conclude with a trib
ute to the author's friends who
were "punished entirely too
much for what they did." The
only truly science-fiction ele
ment is the "scramble suit,"
which helps to conceal the iden
tities of undercover agents. Dick
apparently added this element to
the novel since he doubted it
would sell as a mainstream
novel.
Given the film's focus on

drug-use and the paranoia it
induces, "A Scanner Darkly"
represents very familiar territory
for Linklater. The scatter-brain
ramblings of Downey Jr. and
Woody Harrelsons in particular,
are reminiscent of similar con
versations in "Dazed and
Confused." Several times, I was
reminded of Rory Cochrane's
character from "Dazed" who
asked "Didja ever look at a dol
lar bill, man? There's some
spooky shit goin' on there. And
it's green too."
Linklater's ear for dialogue is
beyond reproach and he makes
considerable use of this talent
here. "A Scanner Darkly" is
certainly very effective as a com
edy. Sadly, it is not nearly as
potent as a tragedy. Linklater's
choice of animation creates a
"trippy" feel but it also prevents
the audience from forging any
emotional connection with the
film's characters.
I would argue that Danny
Boyle achieved a much better
mix of comedy and tragedy in
the live-action "Trainspotting."
"A Scanner Darkly" is still
very watchable but it is never as
engaging as it should be. This is
a real shame because Linklater
and Dick clearly have things to
say. We're just not interested
enough to hear them.
