While waiting for "A
Scanner Darkly" to
begin, I overheard an
elderly gentleman sit
ting behind me claim
that no filmmaker has
ever succeeded in bring
ing author Philip K.
Dick to the screen.
Quite an assertion given
the praise heaped upon
"Blade Runner," based
on Dick's 1968 novel
"Do Androids Dream
of Electric Sheep?" But
the gentleman is proba
bly correct. "Blade
Runner" is visually
stunning but it ignores
numerous themes from
Dick's novel. Less
revered adaptations,
like "Paycheck" and
"Total Recall," are pri
marily action vehicles

that use the author's
ideas merely as starting points. This is certainly not true of "A
Scanner Darkly," which is arguably the most faithful adaptation of
Philip K. Dick to date. A blend of comedy and tragedy, the movie

gleefully abandons main
stream appeal but the results
are decidedly mixed.
Set seven years into
the future, the movie focuses
on the dual identity of Bob
Arctor and Agent Fred
(Keanu Reeves). The for
mer is part of a household of
drug-users. The latter is an
undercover narcotics agent
who has infiltrated the
household to help identify

the source of sub
stance D, a lethally
addictive drug that
has enslaved a large
fraction of society.
Though Agent Fred
is only supposed to
pose as a drug user,
he has become heav
ily addicted to sub
stance D, causing
the two hemispheres
of his brain to func
tion independently.
The situation
escalates when one
of the household's
members (Robert
Downey Jr.) informs
the police that
Arctor is the very
source they are
searching for. Since
the identities of
undercover agents
are unknown, even
to the police, Fred's
is ordered to spy on
his other self. The
task proves difficult

for Fred as his addiction to substance D swells and he becomes
increasingly unable to distinguish between his dual role as drug user
and undercover agent.
Richard Linklater initially shot "A Scanner Darkly" like most
movies. However, the edited film was then animated frame by
frame to produce a visual style that is very non-mainstream and
reminiscent of the director's 2001 snooze-fest "Waking Life.
Production involved 23.5 days of live-action shooting and then 1.5
years in the office animating. Linklater claims that each minute of
the finished product represents 500 hours of an artist's time.
There is certainly no denying "A Scanner Darkly's" visual
appeal. Unlike "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow," the
film s look is more than a gimmick and never outstays its welcome.

WHOA: It was only a matter of time before Keanu Reeve's acting transformed him into
something completely unnatural. We were just expecting him to turn out to be a robot.
