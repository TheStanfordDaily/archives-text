### IRENE LAU ENTERTAINMENT FOOD CRITIC 
Escape the yuppie pretensions and
blindingly high prices of Palo Alto
restaurants with these authentic ethnic
eateries. With a genuine concern for
cooking soulful, as-authentic-as-it-gets
cuisine, the cost-to-taste ratio of these
restaurants is heavily in the diner's favor.

Los Altos, CA 94022

This is the best Chinese restaurant I've found in the area. With
the loud, boisterous atmosphere and the availability of large, circu
lar tables for big groups, this is the place to go with friends and eat
family-style. Among the dishes I can vouch for in terms of quality,
are the moo shu pork (yes, I liked it. Yes, it's inauthentic. So sue

me.), the Peking duck (crispy duck
skin on a piece of fluffy, ever-so
slightly sweet pastry bun with plum
sauce and scallions), hot-and-sour
soup, sauteed eggplant in spicy
sauce, and tofu in all its manifesta
tions. Stay away from the dry fried
chicken. In general, the quality is
very high, which is surprising con
sidering the vastness of the menu.
The true standouts, although, take
a little more risk-taking. The eel on
a hot-plate and salt-baked crab are
what foodgasms are made of. Eel is
far less scary than it sounds. It
tastes just like any other slightly
oily, white-fleshed fish. When it
comes out on the table, it doesn't
even look like an eel, but rather a
fish fillet. Order it, but don't tell
your friends that it's eel: they'll
love it. The eel is presented on the
table sizzling on a metal slab hot
plate. Then, the waiter or waitress
pours on a delicious, earthy, and

thoroughly addicting sauce on top
of the eel, provoking a storm of sizzling and an explosion of deli
ciously aromatic steam. This is not gimmickry. Rather, the hot-plate
is integral to why the eel tastes so damn good. Since the eel is placed
skin-down on the hot-plate, the fattiness of the eel becomes lus
ciously caramelized by the direct heat.
Another favorite is the salt-baked crab. The crab takes some
work, since it's served with the shell on (thus preserving the moist
ness and flavor when it cooks). The light coating on the exterior of
the crab is a mixture of flour, salt, pepper, and subtle spices. The
inside is moist, and utterly sweet. The interplay of the crispy, slight
ly salty crust and the moist, sweet meat inside is truly remarkable.
This is Chinese food as it should be done. Most dishes range from 7
to 8 dollars. The seafood specialties mentioned are more expensive,
the necessary price you pay for amazing seafood at its freshest: eel -
$13; crab - about $17, depending on how much poundage you want.

Pho Ga An Nam
(408) 993-1211
740 Story Rd
San Jose, CA 95122

Located in San Jose's Vietnamese section ("Little Saigon"), Pho
Ga An Nam serves only one thing: chicken. This isn't the steroid
pumped, then frozen chicken that is seen in most American restau
rants. Chicken here isn't the passive, bland vehicle for sauces and
spices, but rather the intensely-flavored star of the show. This

sparsely decorated yet com
fortable restaurant serves the
chicken in three different
ways. You can order chicken
broth with vermicelli or egg
noodles garnished with bone
in pieces of chicken, or rice
cooked in chicken broth with
bone-in chicken pieces on the
side. The noodle soup dishes
are the best I've ever had in a
restaurant, and a close con
tender to my mom's
(heresy!). The broth is the
same regardless of which type
of noodle you choose and is
fresh and clear-tasting, yet
deeply flavorful. The hours
and hours of careful simmer
ing and spicing are evident.
The pieces of chicken are so
fresh and devoid of man's
unfortunate tinkering that
you have probably never tast
ed chicken so good and close

to what nature intended. If
you are a n()0b and are uncomfortable with eating the chicken
bone-in, they are happy to take the meat off the bone for you
(although, keep in mind that the bones add flavor and you should
keep them in).
When ordering which type of noodle you want, keep in mind that
the egg noodles have a nice, subtle, fresh egg yolk flavor whereas
the vermicelli is mostly tasteless. Also, they tend to put more herbs
as garnish in the egg-noodle soup than the vermicelli-noodle soup.
So, go for the egg-noodle soup if you want a more complex taste
combination. 1 haven't personally had the rice and chicken, but I
have heard great reviews about those as well. I love this place so
much that the last time 1 was here, I ordered several bowls of soup
to go (they keep the noodles and soup separate so the noodles don't
get mushy). Beats another bowl of cereal for dinner any day. The
dishes range mostly from 5 to 6 dollars depending on size.


OH PHO: While on the surface it may look like tripe —because it is— Pho
is actually the most delicious of the tripe-based soups.
