## THE 						MEDIA & MICROTEXT CENTER: WHAT FILM GEEKS SEE BEFORE THEY DIE 
### RYAN LAMPE ENTERTAINMENT MOLE-PERSON 
Green Library's Media-Microtext Center is the
"High Fidelity" of University media libraries. You
know, the kind of place where the employees seem
overdosed on caffeine, randomly construct top five
lists and lambaste other students' tastes in movies
("No, you can't borrow 'When Harry Met Sally.' Why
Not? Well, it's sentimental tacky crap. Do we look
like the kind of media library that lends out 'When
Harry Met Sally?' ").
Okay, so that's not entirely true. Actually, the
place is rather sedate. But don't let the atmosphere
fool you. Behind the front desk is an impressive
media collection boasting around 12,000 DVDs,
18,000 VHS tapes and 500 laser discs. If Steve
Martin's character from "Grand Canyon" is correct
and "all life's riddles are answered in the movies,"
then the Media-Microtext Center is a veritable gold
mine.
But just how impressive is this collection? I mean,
really? Well, pretty damn impressive actually.
Netflix may have 60,000 titles on DVD but it also has
4.9 million subscribers. Furthermore, it costs money
to join Netflix. Stanford University has only 12,000
DVDs but it also has only 19,000 students and its
media resource is free. Go Stanford!
And let's not forget that there are a lot of movies
yet to be released on DVD. With video stores selling
off their VHS collections, Green Library is fast
becoming the only way to access classics like Orson
Welles' "Citizen Kane" follow-up, "The Magnificent
Ambersons," the great "Apocalypse Now" documen
tary, "Hearts of Darkness" or Warren Beatty's
Bolshevik Revolution flick, "Reds." The Media-
Microtext Center is also a great place to remind your
self that Han did in fact shoot first.
Additionally, a lot of DVDs are currently out-of

print. John Woo's taut psychological drama, "The
Killer," Pausolini's heartfelt adaptation of de Sade,
"Salo," and Disney's confronting look at life under
the sea, "The Little Mermaid," are no longer avail
able on DVD. But rest assured copies of these titles
are safely preserved in Green Library's basement.
So with such a rich, expansive collection, just what
are Stanford student's borrowing? The influential
works of Akira Kurosawa? The classic thrillers of
Alfred Hitchcock? The Swedish masterworks of
Ingmar Bergman? Well no. Turns out episodes of
"Friends" and "Sex in the City" are the most popular
titles. Go Stanford!
Hey, wait a minute! Just what are episodes of
"Friends" and "Sex in the City" doing in Stanford
University's library anyway? Who determines what
enters the collection and what doesn't? After some
cunning journalistic work (I spoke to a former
employee), I found out that titles are actually select
ed by professors. Furthermore, their selections gen
erally need to have some sort of educational value.
This would certainly explain why Jean-Claude Van
Damme's heart-wrenching portrayal of a malfunction
ing cyborg in "Universal Soldier" is available while
Ridley Scott's coming-of-age drama , "White Squall"
is not available. Glad I sorted that out.
Okay, so I'll admit it took me a really long time to
find a decent movie that the Media-Microtext Center
didn't have. They really do have a fantastic collection.
