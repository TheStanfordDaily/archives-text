# CAMPUS BACKLASH
## Roxy gets hate mail. Huzzah! 
### 
Editor's note: Roxy is used to abuse of the verbal kind. However, rarely does she get the opportunity and
delight of hate mail through the miracle of the internet. Here are some of the highlights personally selected by
The Weekly's own sex goddess, full of raw hatred and pent up sexual frustration about last week s issue. No
corrections have been made in order to fully appreciate the hate mail in all its glory. Names have been changed
to preserve anonimity, but you know who you are. And you thought you couldn t get published Enjoy!

Dear Ms. Sass,
All you have done is perpetuate the
stereotype that intelligent people can
not be beautiful. Since you write
grammatically correct sentences, it's
probably a good thing you write for a
newspaper and stay off the television
screen. It is completely acceptable for
someone to be attractive, even sexy,
and at the same time have a passion
for learning and education. Enjoy
every VD known to the human race
as you enjoy your pick from athleti
cally hunky guys at camps for kids
who need to be spoon fed their own
saliva. And keep in mind, anytime
you claim someone to be sexist,
remember that you only solidify your
self among the elite masters of
hypocrisy. Thanks for telling every
one who goes to Stanford that they're
ugly.

Dear Ms. Sass,
Last Thursday, you made comments
pertaining to the number theory and
particle physics courses occurring at
Stanford. I am deeply offended that
you referred to EPGY students as
"socially inept youngsters". I also do
not appreciate your generalizations,
calling EPGY a "nerd camp." EPGY
offers multitudes of athletic opportu
nities to students during their stay, as
well as academic enrichment. It is
appalling that you could be so biased
and narrow sighted as to suggest that
students concerned with their intellec
tual pursuits are not socially accept
able or athletically skilled. Your prej
udice towards the number theory and
particle physics students currently
residing in EBF is unnerving.
Upon reading this article, many
students, myself included, were
insulted from your comments, and
have agreed to point out your slan
derous falsehoods. I am also stunned
that a student from Stanford, one of
the finest colleges in the nation,
would be one to demoralize those
who have other goals that simply
"getting into someone's pants".
While having sexual relations is not
the only concern that I and my fellow
classmates have, we are indeed
socially and sexually accepted. In
fact, our advancement in the class
room more than often leads to
advancement in bed. So, in conclu
sion, we demand that you state a
retraction for your defaming actions,
in an attempt to right the social injus
tices that have been committed.

Dear Summer Sex Goddess,
This is in response to your nicely
alliterated "Summertime Sex
Shortage" article which sent the cur
rent residents of the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest dorm into a justified
uproar. EBF currently houses the
very handsome and very socially fit
and, while very underage, very sexu
ally active Number Theory and
Particle Physics high school students.
In fact we are so handsome and so
socially capable and so underage yet
sexually active that when we leave
for class we are all forced to wear
paper bags over our heads so that we
do not tempt the other students or
counselors, as that would be not muy
bueno.
Constantly, we students are forced
to fight off the advances of our also
very handsome and very social com
petent and very (not underage) sexu
ally active counselors. In fact, every
night, one of our hunky counselors
(who, it is rumored, is the proud
owner of a pair of fuzzy pink hand
cuffs for "solving Rubik's Cubes
behind his back") shouted that it was
lights out. Obviously this is simple
code for "I want your babies".
However, this is not to say that our
counselors cannot seek out carnal
fixes elsewhere.
It has been observed many a time
that many a lunch lady and many a
lunch man have made blatant sexual
advances towards our counselors
while spooning out copious amounts
of leftover mashed potatoes from the
baked potatoes of last week. Speaking
of potatoes, it has been noted that our
camp's potato cycle for the week may
be comparative to our counselors'
sexual cycle each time they engage in
soulful, mind-blowing, earth-shatter
ing hanky panky: whole, luscious,
baked potatoes at first (outrageously
amazing foreplay), then more baked
potatoes, more baked potatoes, and
then mashed potatoes (refractory
period). And then a bazillion more
baked potatoes.
You also insinuated that our coun
selors have the need to seek out more
"athletic" counselors in order to
"show...new way[s] to score in bed".
Ms. Goddess, it is common knowledge
that, had our counselors lived two
thousand years ago, they would have
collectively written the entire Karma
Sutra plus nine chapters on how to
"collide particles" and "divide equa
tions", if you know what I mean. In
conclusion, we got more booty than
you. So ha.
P.S. Popsicles are cold and they don't
return your phone calls.

Dear Stanford Weekly Bastards,
Last Thursday, there was an
article in your paper entitled
"Summertime Sex Shortage."
This article, written by a Ms.
"Roxy Sass," specifically insult
ed the classes of number theory
and particle physics. This article
offended me personally, as well
as a great number of my col
leagues. There is most definite
ly not a "summertime sex short
age" in the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest, the dorm housing the
number theory and particle
physics students. I would say
more, but that is something that
I would not like to become pub
lic information.
A few students taking num
ber theory and particle physics
are very sensitive and have not
stopped crying. You should be
ashamed of yourselves. You've
made the "socially inept"
youngsters start crying. You
can go to hell. This article
exhibits once again that human
beings detest those who are of
greater intellect. Why is it that
people tend to slander the more
intelligent members of the
species? Could it be because
we, in the long run, end up far
more successful and better
looking than them? I submit
that it is. The students at EBF
are some of the best and bright
est in the world, not to mention
fantastic-looking. In conclu
sion, we will rule the world; and
you will pump our gas, you
whore.

Clearly, it's time to transfer
over to number theory. Or par
ticle physics. "Hey baby, my
strong force can handle your
weak force." "Lets make a
grand unified theory of the two
of us." "I like your topology."

Hotoe it! siafo -
Love this. Especially how all the
high schoolers are vainly trying
to defend themselves by
describing various "escapades."
Except since they're under
18...that makes it all statutory...
Not to mention that to fight the
article in extremely verbose and
flowery language only perpetu
ates the theory...

who have other goals that simply
"getting into someone's pants".
While having sexual relations is not
the only concern that I and my fellow
classmates have, we are indeed
socially and sexually accepted. In
fact, our advancement in the class
room more than often leads to
advancement in bed. So, in conclu
sion, we demand that you state a
retraction for your defaming actions,
in an attempt to right the social injus
tices that have been committed.

Dear Summer Sex Goddess,
This is in response to your nicely
alliterated "Summertime Sex
Shortage" article which sent the cur
rent residents of the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest dorm into a justified
uproar. EBF currently houses the
very handsome and very socially fit
and, while very underage, very sexu
ally active Number Theory and
Particle Physics high school students.
In fact we are so handsome and so
socially capable and so underage yet
sexually active that when we leave
for class we are all forced to wear
paper bags over our heads so that we
do not tempt the other students or
counselors, as that would be not muy
bueno.
Constantly, we students are forced
to fight off the advances of our also
very handsome and very social com
petent and very (not underage) sexu
ally active counselors. In fact, every
night, one of our hunky counselors
(who, it is rumored, is the proud
owner of a pair of fuzzy pink hand
cuffs for "solving Rubik's Cubes
behind his back") shouted that it was
lights out. Obviously this is simple
code for "I want your babies".
However, this is not to say that our
counselors cannot seek out carnal
fixes elsewhere.
It has been observed many a time
that many a lunch lady and many a
lunch man have made blatant sexual
advances towards our counselors
while spooning out copious amounts
of leftover mashed potatoes from the
baked potatoes of last week. Speaking
of potatoes, it has been noted that our
camp's potato cycle for the week may
be comparative to our counselors'
sexual cycle each time they engage in
soulful, mind-blowing, earth-shatter
ing hanky panky: whole, luscious,
baked potatoes at first (outrageously
amazing foreplay), then more baked
potatoes, more baked potatoes, and
then mashed potatoes (refractory
period). And then a bazillion more
baked potatoes.
You also insinuated that our coun
selors have the need to seek out more
"athletic" counselors in order to
"show...new way[s] to score in bed".
Ms. Goddess, it is common knowledge
that, had our counselors lived two
thousand years ago, they would have
collectively written the entire Karma
Sutra plus nine chapters on how to
"collide particles" and "divide equa
tions", if you know what I mean. In
conclusion, we got more booty than
you. So ha.
P.S. Popsicles are cold and they don't
return your phone calls.

Dear Stanford Weekly Bastards,
Last Thursday, there was an
article in your paper entitled
"Summertime Sex Shortage."
This article, written by a Ms.
"Roxy Sass," specifically insult
ed the classes of number theory
and particle physics. This article
offended me personally, as well
as a great number of my col
leagues. There is most definite
ly not a "summertime sex short
age" in the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest, the dorm housing the
number theory and particle
physics students. I would say
more, but that is something that
I would not like to become pub
lic information.
A few students taking num
ber theory and particle physics
are very sensitive and have not
stopped crying. You should be
ashamed of yourselves. You've
made the "socially inept"
youngsters start crying. You
can go to hell. This article
exhibits once again that human
beings detest those who are of
greater intellect. Why is it that
people tend to slander the more
intelligent members of the
species? Could it be because
we, in the long run, end up far
more successful and better
looking than them? I submit
that it is. The students at EBF
are some of the best and bright
est in the world, not to mention
fantastic-looking. In conclu
sion, we will rule the world; and
you will pump our gas, you
whore.

Clearly, it's time to transfer
over to number theory. Or par
ticle physics. "Hey baby, my
strong force can handle your
weak force." "Lets make a
grand unified theory of the two
of us." "I like your topology."

Love this. Especially how all the
high schoolers are vainly trying
to defend themselves by
describing various "escapades."
Except since they're under
18...that makes it all statutory...
Not to mention that to fight the
article in extremely verbose and
flowery language only perpetu
ates the theory...
Editor's note: Roxy is used to abuse of the verbal kind. However, rarely does she get the opportunity and
delight of hate mail through the miracle of the internet. Here are some of the highlights personally selected by
The Weekly's own sex goddess, full of raw hatred and pent up sexual frustration about last week s issue. No
corrections have been made in order to fully appreciate the hate mail in all its glory. Names have been changed
to preserve anonimity, but you know who you are. And you thought you couldn t get published Enjoy!

Dear Ms. Sass,
All you have done is perpetuate the
stereotype that intelligent people can
not be beautiful. Since you write
grammatically correct sentences, it's
probably a good thing you write for a
newspaper and stay off the television
screen. It is completely acceptable for
someone to be attractive, even sexy,
and at the same time have a passion
for learning and education. Enjoy
every VD known to the human race
as you enjoy your pick from athleti
cally hunky guys at camps for kids
who need to be spoon fed their own
saliva. And keep in mind, anytime
you claim someone to be sexist,
remember that you only solidify your
self among the elite masters of
hypocrisy. Thanks for telling every
one who goes to Stanford that they're
ugly.

Dear Ms. Sass,
Last Thursday, you made comments
pertaining to the number theory and
particle physics courses occurring at
Stanford. I am deeply offended that
you referred to EPGY students as
"socially inept youngsters". I also do
not appreciate your generalizations,
calling EPGY a "nerd camp." EPGY
offers multitudes of athletic opportu
nities to students during their stay, as
well as academic enrichment. It is
appalling that you could be so biased
and narrow sighted as to suggest that
students concerned with their intellec
tual pursuits are not socially accept
able or athletically skilled. Your prej
udice towards the number theory and
particle physics students currently
residing in EBF is unnerving.
Upon reading this article, many
students, myself included, were
insulted from your comments, and
have agreed to point out your slan
derous falsehoods. I am also stunned
that a student from Stanford, one of
the finest colleges in the nation,
would be one to demoralize those
who have other goals that simply
"getting into someone's pants".
While having sexual relations is not
the only concern that I and my fellow
classmates have, we are indeed
