## CAMPUS BRIEFS Grads fire up July Fourth barbecue 
### 
The Graduate Student Council kept the
graduate community well-fed and in touch
with a summer barbecue, held on July Fourth.
An estimated 600 students attended the
event.
"It was a great way to bring grad students
together," said Paul Gurney, a Graduate
Student Council member. "People seemed to
have a fun time."
The event included a watermelon eating
contest, as well as an impromptu soccer
match, and has been held annually by the
council and Graduate Student Programming
Board. The next major event to be held by the
program is a welcoming party for students in
September.
