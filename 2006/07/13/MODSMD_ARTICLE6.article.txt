# Law School cafe undergoes ownership change
## 
### 
Stanford Law School's Law Association
board recently selected new but well-known
owners for the Law School cafe following the
interviewing of proposed vendors. Maurice
and Giusseppe Carrubba, co-owners of the 750
Pub, Ciao Cafe (in the Terman Engineering
Center) and Cafe Riacci (in Palo Alto) will
assume cafe ownership over the next month.
The current vendors will continue service
through Friday, July 14, vacating the space by
the following Friday, July 21. The cafe will be
closed for a few weeks while renovations are
completed and the facility undergoes a health
code inspection, with the goal of the cafe
being ready for when 1L students arrive for
orientation, Aug. 21.
"We truly hope you're patient with this
change over to the new cafe provider," said
Jillian De Pozo, director of facilities and oper
ations for Stanford Law School, in an email to
students and staff. "It will be well worth the
wait."
