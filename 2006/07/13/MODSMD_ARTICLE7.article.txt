# Tibetan studies receives $1 million endowment
## 
### 
After just one year of existence, Stanford's
Tibetan Studies Program received its first
endowment of $1 million. Following a
$500,000 donation by the Tara Foundation,
the University matched it with another
$500,000 from Hewlett funds.
Created from the endowment, the new
Tara Foundation Fund will provide fellow
ships to graduate students in the School of
Humanities and Sciences whose focus is relat
ed to Tibet. Currently, no such students have
been identified, but the funds will meanwhile
provide for teaching, research, conferences,
visiting professors, lecturers, library purchas
es and curriculum needs.
"We are delighted to share this wonderful
news with all of you who have helped make
this inaugural year of Stanford's new Tibetan
Studies Program such a success, and wish to
publicly express our deep gratitude to the
Tara Foundation for its great generosity and
sincere interest in helping to promote
research on Tibet," said Dr. Wendy Abraham
in an announcement email. She is the associ
ate director of the Stanford Center for
Buddhist Studies, which is a part of the Asian
Religions and Cultures Initiative here at
Stanford.
