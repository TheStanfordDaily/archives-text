### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Recent headlines in Bay Area newspapers
have highlighted potential conflicts of interest
for members of the Stanford Board of
Trustees and a prominent physician at
Stanford Medical School.
In its fiscal 2(X)3-04 Form 990 filed with the
Internal Revenue Service, Stanford identifies
four potential conflicts of interest:
(1) the University paid $2.18 million in legal
fees in fiscal 2003-04 to Pillsbury Winthrop
Shaw Pittman, where Mary Cranston, attorney
and Board of Trustees member, served as firm
chair

(2) President John Hennessy
served on the board of
Google Inc. while the
University had approxi
mately $282 million invested
in the company as of August
31, 2004
(3) William Landreth served
simultaneously as a member
of the Board of Trustees,
chairing its Development
Committee, and an advisory

director for Goldman Sachs when the invest
ment bank underwrote $50 million in bonds
for Stanford; and similarly
(4) Jon Blum served on the Board of Trustees
while also acting as the managing director for
Morgan Stanley when it underwrote $80 mil
lion in bonds for the University.
"We self-identify these relationships

because we believe trans
parency is a good gover
nance practice," said Jeff
Wachtel, secretary of the
Board of Trustees and
senior assistant to the presi
dent. "There are many
instances in which people
have relationships where
various professional inter
ests intersect, but that does
not mean that there is an
actual conflict of interest.

"In fact, pursuant to our policy, none of
these people participate in decisions in which
they have a personal financial interest, so we
believe there are no actual conflicts of inter
