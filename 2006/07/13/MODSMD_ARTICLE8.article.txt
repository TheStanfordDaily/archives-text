## Potential conflicts for trustees University responds to conflict of interest reports; cites recusals 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Recent headlines in Bay Area newspapers
have highlighted potential conflicts of interest
for members of the Stanford Board of
Trustees and a prominent physician at
Stanford Medical School.
In its fiscal 2(X)3-04 Form 990 filed with the
Internal Revenue Service, Stanford identifies
four potential conflicts of interest:
(1) the University paid $2.18 million in legal
fees in fiscal 2003-04 to Pillsbury Winthrop
Shaw Pittman, where Mary Cranston, attorney
and Board of Trustees member, served as firm
chair

(2) President John Hennessy
served on the board of
Google Inc. while the
University had approxi
mately $282 million invested
in the company as of August
31, 2004
(3) William Landreth served
simultaneously as a member
of the Board of Trustees,
chairing its Development
Committee, and an advisory

director for Goldman Sachs when the invest
ment bank underwrote $50 million in bonds
for Stanford; and similarly
(4) Jon Blum served on the Board of Trustees
while also acting as the managing director for
Morgan Stanley when it underwrote $80 mil
lion in bonds for the University.
"We self-identify these relationships

because we believe trans
parency is a good gover
nance practice," said Jeff
Wachtel, secretary of the
Board of Trustees and
senior assistant to the presi
dent. "There are many
instances in which people
have relationships where
various professional inter
ests intersect, but that does
not mean that there is an
actual conflict of interest.

"In fact, pursuant to our policy, none of
these people participate in decisions in which
they have a personal financial interest, so we
believe there are no actual conflicts of inter

est. For instance, the trustees with the invest
ment banking firms do not participate in the
discussions or decisions about selection of
underwriters for bond issuances; Mary
Cranston does not participate in any discus
sion or selection of counsel; and John
Hennessy does not participate in any discus
sions or decisions with regard to any
University business with Google."
Wachtel believes that the University ade
quately addresses potential conflicts of interest
and assured The Stanford Weekly that the
University will continue to monitor this issue in
order to improve current poli-

cies and practices.
According to the William
A. Franke Professor of Law
and Business at Stanford Law
School, Joseph Grundfest,
relationships described as
involving potential "conflicts
of interest" or "interested
party transactions" are "hard
ly rare among publicly traded
corporations or among non
profit organizations, including

r c 7 c
major universities such as Harvard, Yale and
Stanford."
"Major non-profit organizations commonly
have on their boards significant service
providers and donors who are committed to
the organization's mission and who also may
contribute by making available investment
opportunities that are not generally available
to other investors because they are relatively
attractive, or by offering to provide services on
terms and conditions that could actually be
more favorable than those available in the mar
ketplace," Grundfest noted.
"That said, it is also true that an opportuni-

ty for potential abuse arises
whenever a trustee or any
other person in a position of
decision-making authority is
doing business with a non
profit organization," he
added.
Grundfest believes that
the underlying issue is not the
existence of a potential con
flict, but rather the care and

precision with which the potential conflict is
managed.
"If the board of a non-profit organization
adopts the appropriate governance and recusal
policies, then the large majority of potential
conflicts can be handled quite responsibly,"
Grundfest said. "And if the relationship is well
managed, it can greatly benefit the non-profit
organization."
Although not familiar with the specifics of
the potential conflicts of interest outlined in
Stanford's most-recent Form 990, Grundfest
observes that the "trustees at Stanford can
have in place various controls that should
either eliminate or greatly ameliorate any rea
sonable concern over potential conflicts."
"Given the expertise and backgrounds of
many of the persons involved, I would not be
surprised in the least to learn that entirely
appropriate safeguards are in place,"
Grundfest said. "Therefore, I would caution
against leaping from the observation that there
is a potential cause of concern to the conclusion
that there is an actual problem. That leap of
logic would be unfounded."
The other potential conflict of interest
story involving the University concerns a pos
sible financial conflict of interest for Dr. Alan
Schatzberg. He is well-known for his discov
ery that a controversial abortion pill, RU-486,
may help severely depressed patients.
According to a recent article in the Mercury
News, as chairman of Stanford's Psychiatry
department, Schatzberg manages a $600,000
annual federal grant that in part funds
research on the key ingredient of RU-486 at

Stanford Medical School. In addition,
Schatzberg co-founded public company
Corcept Therapeutics, which has an exclusive
license from the University to develop
Schatzberg's patented technology into a treat
ment approved by the Food and Drug
Administration.
In 2004, two research psychiatrists at the
annual meeting of the American College of
Neuropsychopharmacology publicly alleged
that Schatzberg's scientific conclusions were
likely tied to his financial interests, because
they said the effectiveness of RU-486 for the
depressed was questionable.
"My work, which has been carried out for
the past 25 years, has consistently been sub
ject to peer review," Schatzberg said. "Dr.
Carroll's and Rubin's arguments have not
been subject to true peer review, and they
have consistently misrepresented what 1 have
said. Their arguments are sophomoric and
suggest a poor understanding of early drug
development. They have also failed to divulge
their own personal conflicts of interest."
Schatzberg discloses all conflicts on an
annual basis to the Conflict of Interest
Committee (COIC) of Stanford University
School of Medicine, according to a statement
by Stanford Medical School. In addition,
Schatzberg routinely discloses conflicts of
interests when publishing papers and applying
for grants or other sponsored research.
Stanford Medical School also reports that
Schatzberg personally does not directly partici
pate in any mifepristone clinical trials in areas
related to Corcept programs, such as dementia
or severe psychotic major depression (PMD).
All data from mifepristone studies in PMD are
reviewed annually by both the Data Safety and
Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the General
Clinical Research Center at Stanford University
School of Medicine and again by the DSMB at
the National Institute of Mental Health.

story involving the University concerns a pos
sible financial conflict of interest for Dr. Alan
Schatzberg. He is well-known for his discov
ery that a controversial abortion pill, RU-486,
may help severely depressed patients.
According to a recent article in the Mercury
News, as chairman of Stanford's Psychiatry
department, Schatzberg manages a $600,000
annual federal grant that in part funds
research on the key ingredient of RU-486 at

Stanford Medical School. In addition,
Schatzberg co-founded public company
Corcept Therapeutics, which has an exclusive
license from the University to develop
Schatzberg's patented technology into a treat
ment approved by the Food and Drug
Administration.
In 2004, two research psychiatrists at the
annual meeting of the American College of
Neuropsychopharmacology publicly alleged
that Schatzberg's scientific conclusions were
likely tied to his financial interests, because
they said the effectiveness of RU-486 for the
depressed was questionable.
"My work, which has been carried out for
the past 25 years, has consistently been sub
ject to peer review," Schatzberg said. "Dr.
Carroll's and Rubin's arguments have not
been subject to true peer review, and they
have consistently misrepresented what 1 have
said. Their arguments are sophomoric and
suggest a poor understanding of early drug
development. They have also failed to divulge
their own personal conflicts of interest."
Schatzberg discloses all conflicts on an
annual basis to the Conflict of Interest
Committee (COIC) of Stanford University
School of Medicine, according to a statement
by Stanford Medical School. In addition,
Schatzberg routinely discloses conflicts of
interests when publishing papers and applying
for grants or other sponsored research.
Stanford Medical School also reports that
Schatzberg personally does not directly partici
pate in any mifepristone clinical trials in areas
related to Corcept programs, such as dementia
or severe psychotic major depression (PMD).
All data from mifepristone studies in PMD are
reviewed annually by both the Data Safety and
Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the General
Clinical Research Center at Stanford University
School of Medicine and again by the DSMB at
the National Institute of Mental Health.

Recent headlines in Bay Area newspapers
have highlighted potential conflicts of interest
for members of the Stanford Board of
Trustees and a prominent physician at
Stanford Medical School.
In its fiscal 2(X)3-04 Form 990 filed with the
Internal Revenue Service, Stanford identifies
four potential conflicts of interest:
(1) the University paid $2.18 million in legal
fees in fiscal 2003-04 to Pillsbury Winthrop
Shaw Pittman, where Mary Cranston, attorney
and Board of Trustees member, served as firm
chair

(2) President John Hennessy
served on the board of
Google Inc. while the
University had approxi
mately $282 million invested
in the company as of August
31, 2004
(3) William Landreth served
simultaneously as a member
of the Board of Trustees,
chairing its Development
Committee, and an advisory

director for Goldman Sachs when the invest
ment bank underwrote $50 million in bonds
for Stanford; and similarly
(4) Jon Blum served on the Board of Trustees
while also acting as the managing director for
Morgan Stanley when it underwrote $80 mil
lion in bonds for the University.
"We self-identify these relationships

because we believe trans
parency is a good gover
nance practice," said Jeff
Wachtel, secretary of the
Board of Trustees and
senior assistant to the presi
dent. "There are many
instances in which people
have relationships where
various professional inter
ests intersect, but that does
not mean that there is an
actual conflict of interest.

"In fact, pursuant to our policy, none of
these people participate in decisions in which
they have a personal financial interest, so we
believe there are no actual conflicts of inter

est. For instance, the trustees with the invest
ment banking firms do not participate in the
discussions or decisions about selection of
underwriters for bond issuances; Mary
Cranston does not participate in any discus
sion or selection of counsel; and John
Hennessy does not participate in any discus
sions or decisions with regard to any
University business with Google."
Wachtel believes that the University ade
quately addresses potential conflicts of interest
and assured The Stanford Weekly that the
University will continue to monitor this issue in
order to improve current poli-

cies and practices.
According to the William
A. Franke Professor of Law
and Business at Stanford Law
School, Joseph Grundfest,
relationships described as
involving potential "conflicts
of interest" or "interested
party transactions" are "hard
ly rare among publicly traded
corporations or among non
profit organizations, including

r c 7 c
major universities such as Harvard, Yale and
Stanford."
"Major non-profit organizations commonly
have on their boards significant service
providers and donors who are committed to
the organization's mission and who also may
contribute by making available investment
opportunities that are not generally available
to other investors because they are relatively
attractive, or by offering to provide services on
terms and conditions that could actually be
more favorable than those available in the mar
ketplace," Grundfest noted.
"That said, it is also true that an opportuni-

ty for potential abuse arises
whenever a trustee or any
other person in a position of
decision-making authority is
doing business with a non
profit organization," he
added.
Grundfest believes that
the underlying issue is not the
existence of a potential con
flict, but rather the care and

precision with which the potential conflict is
managed.
"If the board of a non-profit organization
adopts the appropriate governance and recusal
policies, then the large majority of potential
conflicts can be handled quite responsibly,"
Grundfest said. "And if the relationship is well
managed, it can greatly benefit the non-profit
organization."
Although not familiar with the specifics of
the potential conflicts of interest outlined in
Stanford's most-recent Form 990, Grundfest
observes that the "trustees at Stanford can
have in place various controls that should
either eliminate or greatly ameliorate any rea
sonable concern over potential conflicts."
"Given the expertise and backgrounds of
many of the persons involved, I would not be
surprised in the least to learn that entirely
appropriate safeguards are in place,"
Grundfest said. "Therefore, I would caution
against leaping from the observation that there
is a potential cause of concern to the conclusion
that there is an actual problem. That leap of
logic would be unfounded."

story involving the University concerns a pos
sible financial conflict of interest for Dr. Alan
