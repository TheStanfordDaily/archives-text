# SUMMER PROGRAMS
## EPGY gathers enthusiastic learners Summer Institutes invite, challenge brightest of youth 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES NEWS EDITOR 
Campus over the summer is full of
younger students practicing their athletic
skills and taking summer quarter classes,
but few can say they engineered a solu
tion to heart disease.
Educational Program for Gifted
Youth (EPGY) student Josh Burak is
one of those few. In his three weeks at
Stanford, the rising high-school senior
constructed an electric "catheter" with
which to identify problem areas on an
electronic heart, and then repair.
"The first week and a half we learned
all the physics — tension, force, buckling,
and the next week we started putting it
together, building the catheters with the
electrical circuitry, and making every
thing work," Burak said.
Burak's class, Introduction to
Bioscience and Biotechnology, is one of
23 offered during EPGY's Summer
Institutes. Drawing upon the humanities
and sciences, the program offers two
three-week and one four-week session to
students in grades eight through 11.
Tuition is $3600 per three-week session
and $4700 for the four-week session.
"A lot of [the program] is academic
enrichment," said Director of Summer
Institutes for EPGY Rick Sommer. "It's
for kids who are not challenged in their
regular schooling and want to learn more.
We get very bright students; we're a
selective program and we want to give
them a taste of academic content and aca
demic experience they wouldn't have
otherwise."
Students in the Summer Institutes
select among all available classes in appli
cation for the program, but only take one.
Although admission rates vary by class,
Sommer said the program accepts
approximately two thirds of applicants.
The number may be seen as high, but
Sommer said the program has very
focused, private marketing, lessening the
applicant pool to only the most gifted and
enthusiastic.
"We're looking for students who are
academically talented and motivated,"
Sommer said. "We're looking for people
who are coming here for the right rea
sons. They receive no credit or grade for
their work, so it's purely academic enrich
ment."
EPGY applications include the typical
transcript, standardized test scores,
teacher recommendation, work sample
and personal statement. With such high

expectations, only the most passionate
make it into the Summer Institutes,
Sommer said.
Rising high-school senior Caroline
Riedel came to EPGY after receiving an
e-mail from the program. She was inter
ested in getting a better sense of engi
neering, her father's profession.
"It was really cool to get a sense of
engineering here," Riedel said. "I found I
really like it and have a better sense of
what 1 want to do in college."
As gifted students, participants do in
fact engage in college-level material.
Quantum mechanics, relativity, particle
physics and advanced math courses,
including number theory, are all taught.
The humanities are not disregarded how
ever, as popular classes such as creative
and expository writing and art history
account for around forty percent of the
program, according to Sommer.
Leading such advanced coursework
are Stanford professors, but assisting
them are (most often) Stanford under
graduate and graduate students acting as
both residential staff and TAs. Classes (or
sections of classes) average 15 students
with an average staff-student ratio of one
to four.
Graduated senior Pablo Abad-
Manterola assists with the Introduction to
Engineering course, and has enjoyed
working with students on robotics pro
jects, as well as fostering a social environ
ment.
"Here they get a glimpse of the college
experience, and what it's like finding a
group of friends," he said. "I hope they
take away wide range of things; since we
have students from places like China and
India, 1 hope they learn as much about
each other as they learn in class."
Sommer shares the sentiment.
Despite the very structured days of
morning class followed by a three-hour
study period, and coordinated extracur
ricular activities in the afternoon and
evening, he hopes each student "leaves
here saying, i haven't learned so much
in three weeks before,' and i had such a
great time.'"
"We want every kid to have a chal
lenging experience, but we don't want to
overwhelm them, and we also want them
to make friends that they keep in touch
with for years to come," he said. "We
want this to be an overall rewarding expe
rience, academically and socially."
The second (three-week) and third
(four-week) EPGY Summer Institutes
sessions began Monday, with students liv
ing in the Cowell and Lake Houses. For
