## Sketch A 						NY Minute No smiles, only grimaces, in the Big Apple 
### 
Earlier this year, I decided that
in keeping with my interna
tional playboy image, I
should spend the summer traveling.
After all, my adoring international
fans also deserve a little Nav...
Alternatively, if one were feeling
a little less generous, one might
point out that the travels have more
to do with a need for some remedial
physics than my playboy lifestyle. I
suppose one might even claim that
said playboy lifestyle is just a fig
ment of my overactive imagination.
However, the details are irrele
vant — the important thing is that
I'm out of the bubble until
September, and I'm poised to tell
you all about it. Starting with stop
numero uno: The Big Apple.
Incidentally, I'm not entirely cer
tain as to the reason why New York
picked an oversized fruit as a street
name (perhaps the notion of a giant
Granny Smith has some sense of
cool cachet that goes over my head),
on the hand I don't really care; if
you must know, I suggest either
Google or getting out more.
The City That Never Sleeps is an
apocryphally (and, I suppose, infa
mously) unfriendly place. With that
in mind I wasn't expecting anything
approaching warmth from the city's
inhabitants. And I was right.
Well, that's not exactly true; New
Yorkers seemed gregarious in cer
tain circumstances (random
strangers in bars were generally
rather personable) and no one was
actually rude to me. However, for a
city with millions running its
gauntlets, there's a disconcerting
sense of deliberate isolation hovering
over much of everyday life.
Take Central Park, for example.
Lovely place. Truly a remarkable
piece of urban planning; it's an
incredible feat to place such green
ery in the middle of a city and have
it seem to visitors that they were
taking a stroll through the country
side. Still, some urban contamina
tion pervades the air.
In order to experience this partic
ular New York gem in the manner
of a local (and in order to feel a lit
tle virtuous) I went running in the
park. Now, despite my general dis
approval of exercise and healthy liv
ing, I have, on occasion, done this
before. And one of things that I like
about the whole running outside
thing is that there's a sense of soli
darity, of camaraderie between you
and the others wearing out their
sneakers at the same time.
You smile at those passing the
other way, you roll your eyes in
exasperation as you pass by a fellow
jogger while crowning a hill in the
heat, you might even throw out a
"Hey!" if you have the breath to
spare. Not in New York.
Apparently eye contact with,

smiling at, and certainly talking to
strangers in the Park is frowned
upon. Heavily. Every time I tried
something, the object of my affability
either veered off, sped up or threat
ened to call the police (okay, that last
one was a slight exaggeration, but
several people looked like they were
contemplating screaming for help).
The studied ignorance of one's fel
low man was not restricted to the city's
green areas. In fact, it reached its pin
nacle (as it were) deep underground.
As a Londoner I'm used to the
idea that you don't talk on the sub
way. I'm even comfortable with the
notion that you don't sit next to
strangers if there's space available
elsewhere. New York, however,
takes things to whole other levels.
No one looks at anyone. At all.
As for talking, well, when I apolo
gized to someone for stepping on
their foot, I was greeted with a look
of abject horror and a rapid turn to
face the other side of the carriage.
Most entertaining of the subway
behaviors is the dynamic self-orga
nization. There's a complicated
maneuvering process whereby
everyone effortless rearranges
themselves after each stop such that
the distance to any fellow traveler is
maximized — beat that, traveling
salesmen algorithms! It's a little like
watching a perfectly trained ballet
company in action, though with
prettier outfits.
There's a game I like to play from
time to time. It's pretty simple: you go
for a walk, smile at the cute white
girls you come across and count the
grin rate of return. One of my
favorite things about America is that
the game works well — people beam
back at you. Out here though, I
counted three returned smiles in a
week. Three. In a week. Even the leg
endarily unfriendly Scots beat that.
Now, don't get me wrong. I like
New York. It's an urbanite's dream
and a certain contender for the cov
eted title of "World's Best City." It's
just that, it is a place where it is
awfully easy to feel awfully small.
And, you know, while it offers a lot
to chew on, it's pretty hard not to
feel like a maggot as you burrow
through the Big Apple.

Think the final analogy was a little
farced? You're right, so don't bother
emailing navins@stanford.edu to
complain. On the other hand, if you
want to tell me hoxv wonderful I am,
you should feel free.
