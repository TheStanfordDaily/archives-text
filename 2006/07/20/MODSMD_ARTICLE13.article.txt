## Do what you *really* want 
### 
At a networking party I went
to last weekend, people
brought up the increasingly
widespread conviction that people
should choose jobs that contribute to
their life goals and that they enjoy
work more than whatever they do
when they're not at work. I agree.
Ideally, people should spend their
lives doing things they enjoy and
believe in. But I think this approach
to jobs actually has a few drawbacks.
First, if you expect to fulfill your
life purpose through a job, you might
neglect or fail to create life goals
unrelated to work. The very ques
tion, "What job is my calling?"
implies that one's calling is precisely
a job — and no more.
But there might be other things
you want to do with your life that
you can't get paid for. To demon
strate how the question "What do
you want to do with your life?" usu
ally means "What paid career do you
want to have?" my friend and I took
to answering it with blatantly non
lucrative goals like "I want to be a
housewife," "I want to reduce the
work week," or "I want to lead the
socialist revolution."
I can think of only one person
I've met who was living with a non
paying
primary life goal — Martin Krieg.
We met outside Palo Alto Whole
Foods as we
were getting on our bikes. As usual
in friendly exchanges including at
least one Stanford student, the con
versation came around to what I
wanted to do with my life. I

described some of the careers I
reluctantly was considering, fol
lowed with "but, what 1 really care
about is
"Forget about the first part of that
sentence," Krieg said, "and focus on
what you really want to accomplish.
Is helping some investment firm
make more money what you really
want to do with your life?"
Krieg himself had worked as an
accountant before being paralyzed in
a car wreck, leading doctors to
assume he'd never recover. He man
aged to rehabilitate himself through
biking and with his new lease on life
decided to work on his real goal —
making "heaven on earth" in the
form of a national bicycle highway
from Boston to San Francisco. He
and others have made considerable
progress on this project, which you
can check out at http://nationalbicy
clegreenway.com/. His experiences
suggest a method of choosing what
to do with your life; perhaps an even
better question than the standard,
"What would you do if you had only
X months or years left in your life?"
is "What would you do if you recov
ered from nearly dying?" In a way,
this is what we should be doing any
way, since we're all recovering from
nearly not existing, and being alive is

quite unlikely and precious for all of
us.
In any event, it's unlikely some
one would think of making a nation
al bike greenbelt, or indeed, doing
most of the things people would do
with second leases on life, if they
were doing a job-first query about
what to do with their lives. I feel like
too often, we go through lists of jobs,
trying to pick the one that matches
our goals best, rather than going
down lists of our goals, trying to
think of what jobs would help us to
achieve them.
Secondly, I think the assumption,
"There's a job out there that I could
enjoy — I need to find a job that I
enjoy" can lead people to assume
that whatever it is they love most
must be a profession. Even as we try
to find jobs that we enjoy, we
shouldn't forget that some of the
things we enjoy aren't jobs and never
should be, like hanging out with
friends and family.
There's an interesting exercise
that circulates in Voluntary
Simplicity circles: List the ten activi
ties you most enjoy. Then list the ten
activities that occupy most of your
time. Compare the two lists.
So in conclusion, while it's good
to look for a job that contributes to
life purpose and enjoyment, it might
be an even better idea to choose life
goals and identify what you enjoy
first, and then choose a life path that
will help you to pursue those things.
