# Sweet home alabama
## The 						Rules of Engagement 
### SINI MATIKAINEN OPINIONS EDITOR 
The fun thing about being home
for the summer is that you finally get
to do all the things you didn't have
time to do during the school year.
Like get your driver's license
renewed. And your retainer tight
ened. And go to the dentist.
(Not the doctor, though. Never
the doctor. My family and personal
experience have instilled in me the
firm belief that doctors rank only
slightly above Magic 8 Balls in terms
of accurately diagnosing illnesses, so
90% of the time the best cure is to
grimly drink some licorice tea and
hope it goes away.)
I'm not a huge fan of orthodontists
either, but I am a fan of keeping my
teeth straight. And I don't know if
you've tried it, but going back to your
orthodontist years after having your

braces off is actually a delightful expe
rience. (If you haven't tried it because
you never had braces, then keep your
delight to yourself). First of all, you
are quite clearly the only one in the
waiting room who is both a patient
and capable of driving yourself to the
office, so congrats on being cooler
than all the fourteen-year-olds!
Second of all, you no longer have
braces, so there is nothing for them to
yank or tighten or threaten to leave on
until you retire because you've been
chewing ice again. Unfortunately, you
still have to deal with the small talk.
I know it's not the most original
question, but it really is worth ask
ing: why is it that dentists and ortho
dontists always feel the need to stick
implements in your mouth, and then
make awkward small talk?
For example (completely verbatim):
Orthodontist: 50... you working
now? Or in school?

Me: I'm in college.
Orthodontist: Oh? Where?
Me: Stanford University. [Note:
Some people seem to find this ques
tion embarrassing. I'm just amazed
when an Alabamian has heard of
the University and/or realizes that I
don't attend Samford College, the
local Baptist school.]
Orth: The one in Palo Alto?
Me: Mm-hmm.
Orth: What are you studying out
there? Pre-dentistry?
Me: Uh... [Inwardly wondering,
"Was that... supposed to be a
joke?"] No. English.
Orth: What are you going to do
with that?
Me: I'm thinking about going into
journalism.
Orth: So I guess you know a lot
about politics, then.
Me: 1... try to keep up?
Orth: Where my dad went to
high school, only two people
went to college. Him, and this
other guy. And the other guy
went to Stanford. Now he's a big
plastic surgeon out in Palo Alto.
Me: [inwardly: Ah. Don't care.l
Oh?
Orth: Yeah. My dad always says
his fence around his house is
worth more than our whole
house!
Me: That is truly amazing.
Orth: Yup. He specializes in
large volume liposuction. How
would you like a job like that?
Me: Can you please just fix my
retainer already?
I didn't actually say that,
because then he might've tried to
put my braces back on. Instead I
just listened as he droned on
about this plastic surgeon before
finally giving me my fixed retain
er and being like, "Good job on
wearing your retainer, little girl!"
and then I got to leave.
I try to look kindly on him,
since I know that he's still young
and naive enough to believe that
if he is nice, people might like
him. This is, of course, patently
false, because his business is the
closest our society offers to tor

ture, and the only affection he
will get is the result of Stockholm
syndrome. And it's certainly not
his personal problem so much as
an industry-wide standard that
dental care professionals must try
to talk to you while there are for
eign objects in your mouth. I
guess since they're working in
such decidedly intimate circum
stances (when else do strangers
become so well acquainted with
your tongue? Don't answer
that.), it seems like they should
try to pretend like we're on
friendly terms.
But my feeling is that no, we
really shouldn't. We should
exchange some pleasantries
before implements go into my
mouth, and then discussion
should stop, and they should fix
my teeth. I went to the orthodon
tist for the ambiance, the feeling
of superiority, and, you know, to
get my retainer fixed. And as
much as I enjoy contemplating
large volume liposuction, that's
just something I don't really feel
comfortable discussing with my
orthodontist.

Do you just love talking to your den
tal hygienist? Then you should
probably e-mail her, since you guys
are such good friends. You could
also e-mail Sini at Sinim@stan
ford.edu, but you might not have as
much in common.
