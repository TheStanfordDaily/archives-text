The fun thing about being home
for the summer is that you finally get
to do all the things you didn't have
time to do during the school year.
Like get your driver's license
renewed. And your retainer tight
ened. And go to the dentist.
(Not the doctor, though. Never
the doctor. My family and personal
experience have instilled in me the
firm belief that doctors rank only
slightly above Magic 8 Balls in terms
of accurately diagnosing illnesses, so
90% of the time the best cure is to
grimly drink some licorice tea and
hope it goes away.)
I'm not a huge fan of orthodontists
either, but I am a fan of keeping my
teeth straight. And I don't know if
you've tried it, but going back to your
orthodontist years after having your

braces off is actually a delightful expe
rience. (If you haven't tried it because
you never had braces, then keep your
delight to yourself). First of all, you
are quite clearly the only one in the
waiting room who is both a patient
and capable of driving yourself to the
office, so congrats on being cooler
than all the fourteen-year-olds!
Second of all, you no longer have
braces, so there is nothing for them to
yank or tighten or threaten to leave on
until you retire because you've been
chewing ice again. Unfortunately, you
still have to deal with the small talk.
I know it's not the most original
question, but it really is worth ask
ing: why is it that dentists and ortho
dontists always feel the need to stick
implements in your mouth, and then
make awkward small talk?
For example (completely verbatim):
Orthodontist: 50... you working
now? Or in school?

Me: I'm in college.
Orthodontist: Oh? Where?
Me: Stanford University. [Note:
Some people seem to find this ques
tion embarrassing. I'm just amazed
when an Alabamian has heard of
the University and/or realizes that I
don't attend Samford College, the
local Baptist school.]
Orth: The one in Palo Alto?
Me: Mm-hmm.
Orth: What are you studying out
there? Pre-dentistry?
Me: Uh... [Inwardly wondering,
"Was that... supposed to be a
joke?"] No. English.
Orth: What are you going to do
with that?
Me: I'm thinking about going into
journalism.
Orth: So I guess you know a lot
about politics, then.
