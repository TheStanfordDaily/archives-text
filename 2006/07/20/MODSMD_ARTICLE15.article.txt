## WATER SPORTS Girls make A SPLASH Cardinal polo players, synchro swimmers and divers compete for world championships 
### DREW BYWATER 
The words 'World Cup' and 'Diving'
have repeatedly found themselves in the
same sentence over recent weeks thanks to
the never ending supply of spectacular
dives by 2006 World Cup Champions, Italy.
However, as the FIFA World Cup finally
reached its controversial end, the time has
come to shift our attention from the diving
on the soccer fields of Germany to the div
ing boards of China for the World Cup of
Diving.
The world's best diving athletes will
gather this week in Chang Shu, China, for
the Federation Internationale de Natation
Amateur (FINA) 15th Annual World Cup
of Diving. Among the competitors is
Cardinal diver Cassidy Krug who clinched

her place on the national diving team after
a strong showing at the U.S. selection
camp.
Krug, who will compete in the three
meter springboard, said that she was look
ing forward to the opportunity to compete
in China. Chang Shu's brand new facilities
were recently completed on July 14th and
anticipation is mounting for Krug, who
says she is eager "for the opportunity to go
out and see where I rank against the rest of
the world."
In other aquatic news, two members of
the Stanford Women's Synchronized
Swimming team will compete this summer
at the FINA Synchronized World
Championships in Spain. Guided by
Stanford coach, Heather Olson, both junior

Poppy Carlig and senior Elizabeth Anne
Markman caught the eye of U.S. national
team selectors as they led the Cardinal team
to their 2006 National Championship title.
Over the weekend, the U.S.A. Women's
Water Polo team took the competition to
the pool with the help of Stanford players.
Senior Alison Gregorka, sophomore
Jessica Steffens, and team captain Brenda
Villa (class of 2003) led the U.S. national
team to a dramatic win from behind the
other team in the game's final seconds. The
12-11 victory over the strong Australian
team clinched an automatic qualification
for the United States for the upcoming
Super Finals. Also on the U.S. women's
water polo team are seniors Katie Hansen
and Christina Hewko.
