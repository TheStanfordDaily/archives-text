## AT THE MOVIE HOUSE The 						'Lifetime' of an underdog 
### BY ADAM HAHN ENTERTAINMENT BALLER 
The Yankees. The Mets. The Knicks. The
Cosmos? For a time, New York City fueled a
nationwide interest in the worldwide activity that
America ignores the most: soccer. The documen
tary "Once in a Lifetime" (directed by Paul
Crowder and John Dower) chronicles the adven
ture of both a franchise and the importation of a
sport.
I, like many others, perceive soccer as a sport
that is simply not played by adults in America.
Little kids, sure. Hell, I ate orange slices and wore
shin guards with the rest of my class in middle
school, but in the 19705, most Americans had
never even seen a match. To Steve Ross, president
of Warner Communications in the '70s, the fact
that soccer was not a household term was a prob
lem. He wanted the passion of the sport to come to
the States and so, funded with millions of his com
pany's dollars, brought to New York City its first
"professional" soccer team: The Cosmos.
I say "professional" with quotes since the early
years of the Cosmos were described by former
team members as "a disgrace of a team." Ross
wanted to bring passion to America, but he had
only created indifference in the Big Apple and the
rest of the nation. To generate interest in the game,
he would have to hire the greatest footballer ever:
Pele. The Brazilian carried a heavy price tag (a fact
that is still true, he asked for $100,000 just to be
interviewed for this film), but Warner was soaring,
and so Pele came to play for New York.
Interest in soccer grew with the foreign acquisi
tion, and fans started pouring in to Giants Stadium.
When Pele was recognized at a New York Mets
game and had to be taken onto the field since the
crowd in the stands could not be con-

trolled, the film presents America at a
crossroads, its national pastime in
danger of being overshadowed by the
international phenomenon. The
Cosmos grew with more and more
imports from Europe, and the team
would eventually represent four
teen countries.
It's hard to grasp how large
the Cosmos team name was,
living in the time when the
most exposure to soccer
Americans have is watching
Zidane's headbutt. When
saying "I'm with the
Cosmos" got yourself into
Studio 54, you knew you
were dealing with true
fame, one of the
interviewees
tells us.
The

drama that kept me engaged was, "Why don't we care
now?" Indeed, the film contains many shots of people
genuinely excited about the sport. Normal 70s New
Yorkers, too: the crowd shows quite a few mustachioed
men sporting aviators, truly a sign that the every-man
was behind this sport, and the film convinces the audi
ence that soccer could have become a national sport.
Unfortunately, every American sport requires televi
sion to survive, and the movie illustrates how the han
dling of North American Soccer League on network
television was bungled. Additionally, the egos of the
players and grudges held by the executives behind the

team led to internal
conflicts about how the
team was managed.
The league itself dis
banded only months
after the Cosmos dis
solved, and so, we are
left in practically the
only soccer-less coun
try in the world.

Co-director Paul Crowder seems enamored with telling
the stories of unappreciated sports. His last two films,
"Dogtown and Z-Boys" and "Riding Giants" chronicle the
rise of skateboarding and surfing, respectively. While
I'm no X Games expert, Crowder's storytelling kept
me interested in both the characters and the evolution
of the sport. His previous films were driven by splen
did scenes of kids skating in empty pools or fifty-foot
swells drenching the screen in aqua, but while
Crowder is able to entertain "Once in a Lifetime's"
audience for a bit by adding arias to cuts of goals, this
film is much more character-driven than his previous
two sports documentaries. The attitudes of certain
characters arc developed heavily, but I wish I could
have seen a little more focus on the game itself, espe
cially some of the other franchises, which are ignored
completely.
"Once in a Lifetime" brings to light a forgotten
piece of American history and does so in the classic
Crowder fashion, seamlessly integrating archival and
stock footage with hard-hitting interviews. Despite
some shortcomings in the subject matter, the film
should not be missed simply because one hasn't played
soccer in eight years. The movie casts a positive light
for soccer's future in America, but unfortunately cites
the statistic that the United States team has qualified
in every World Cup since 1990 during the closing cred
its, eliciting scoffs from the audience at the film's fin
ish. Oh well, it's the only way a story about soccer in
America could have ended.
