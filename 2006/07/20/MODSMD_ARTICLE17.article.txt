## AT THE MOVIE HOUSE The
						'Lifetime' of an underdog 
### BY ADAM HAHN ENTERTAINMENT BALLER 
The Yankees. The Mets. The Knicks. The
Cosmos? For a time, New York City fueled a
nationwide interest in the worldwide activity that
America ignores the most: soccer. The documen
tary "Once in a Lifetime" (directed by Paul
Crowder and John Dower) chronicles the adven
ture of both a franchise and the importation of a
sport.
I, like many others, perceive soccer as a sport
that is simply not played by adults in America.
Little kids, sure. Hell, I ate orange slices and wore
shin guards with the rest of my class in middle
school, but in the 19705, most Americans had
never even seen a match. To Steve Ross, president
of Warner Communications in the '70s, the fact
that soccer was not a household term was a prob
lem. He wanted the passion of the sport to come to
the States and so, funded with millions of his com
pany's dollars, brought to New York City its first
"professional" soccer team: The Cosmos.
I say "professional" with quotes since the early
years of the Cosmos were described by former
team members as "a disgrace of a team." Ross
wanted to bring passion to America, but he had
only created indifference in the Big Apple and the
rest of the nation. To generate interest in the game,
he would have to hire the greatest footballer ever:
Pele. The Brazilian carried a heavy price tag (a fact
that is still true, he asked for $100,000 just to be
interviewed for this film), but Warner was soaring,
and so Pele came to play for New York.
Interest in soccer grew with the foreign acquisi
tion, and fans started pouring in to Giants Stadium.
When Pele was recognized at a New York Mets
game and had to be taken onto the field since the
crowd in the stands could not be con-

trolled, the film presents America at a
crossroads, its national pastime in
danger of being overshadowed by the
international phenomenon. The
Cosmos grew with more and more
imports from Europe, and the team
would eventually represent four
teen countries.
It's hard to grasp how large
the Cosmos team name was,
living in the time when the
most exposure to soccer
Americans have is watching
Zidane's headbutt. When
saying "I'm with the
Cosmos" got yourself into
Studio 54, you knew you
were dealing with true
fame, one of the
interviewees
tells us.
