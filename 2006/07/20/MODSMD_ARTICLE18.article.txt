# A 						Letter from the Entertainment Editor

No matter who you are, no matter where
you live, no matter what kind of car you drive
or what brand of detergent you use, every
body has a pet peeve. For some, it's something
as simple as someone not holding the elevator
or a person who uses the word "like" to the
point where it's a verbal tick that fills in spaces
between, like, words. I am no exception. I con
sider myself a pretty laid back guy, but, just
like for everyone else in this world, there are
things that irritate me beyond all reason.
My list starts with the popped collar. I
don't care how cool you think you are, a
popped collar makes you instantly not. You
ever see those dogs with the cones around
their heads? It's exactly the same thing. All

Because stupid people come in all shapes, sizes and stupids

the other dogs make fun of you and automat
ically assume you have fleas.
Next thing that bothers me is greedy peo
ple. It seems that the richer you are, the more
Scrooge-like you turn out. Of course, you
could always mention Bill Gates, but he got
wedgies in high school and donates more
money than I will ever see, so he doesn't count.
However, the greatest pet peeve that burns
at my patience is stupid people. Now I'm not
talking about people who just weren't granted

the cognitive capacity through genetic fate.
No, I'm talking about the people who don't
take into consideration those around them.
There are six billion people on this planet, so
it's easy to forget that you aren't the only per
son on the planet, right? Wrong.
The paragon of this pet peeve is that guy in
the movie theater who just WONT SHUT
UP. I don't care if there's an axe murderer
behind the door. You don't have to point it
out by yelling, "look out!" I can see for myself
that the guy onscreen is going to get an axe in
the chest. Keep your commentary to yourself
and people won't give you dirty looks as you
walk out of the theater.
If you feel the same way about any of these
pet peeves or if you have a set of your own —
that includes Roxy, kids — shoot us an email
at intermission.daily@gmail.com.
