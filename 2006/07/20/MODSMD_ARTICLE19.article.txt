# AT THE MOVIE HOUSE
## 'Monster House' eats portly kids 
### AMIN EL GAMAL ENTERTAINMENT REAL. (SCARY) ESTATE AGENT 
From the pocket
money of movie god
Steven Spielberg
comes proof that he
too, like us mortals,
has bowel movements.
This proof comes in
the form of the out of
season (Halloween in
July?) and mostly
dilapidated Monster
House, executively
produced by Spielberg.
House follows a
pre-teen, DJ (voiced
by Mitchel Musso),
who watches the
obligatory creepy
house-across-the-
street (none other
than, yes, Kathleen
Turner) from his bed
room window. DJ
notices that the crab
by, wizened owner of

the house, Mr. Nebbercracker (a very senile Steve Buscemi), has
a fit when children play on his lawn, and that toys mysteriously
disappear when they venture to the property — playing on an
archetype used in everything from Meet Me In St. Louis (1944)
to The Sandlot (1993). DJ's unheeding parents go out of town
and leave him with a babysitter Zee (voiced by a wonderfully
emo Maggie Gyllenhaal). On Halloween, DJ's friend Chowder
(Sam Lerner as the also obligatory fat-kid-sidekick) and the

object of both their desires,
a prim but street-smart prep
schooler Jenny (Spencer
Locke) join in the house
watching. Of course, it turns
out that the house is "alive"
(as Chowder yells at least
twice) and one very, very
hungry-ass mother.
The coming-of-age
antics that launch the film

(before it descends into an utterly uneven and soulless action
sequence) are irresistible — especially the dynamic between the
boys and Zee. When Chowder explains that, "a house just tried to
eat us," Zee replies after a slight delay, "No more Mountain Dew."
Much like Toy Story (1995), it pits the children in a world that is
inaccessible and hidden from adults. The highly stylized 3D anima
tion creates impressive photorealistic backdrops for the very car
toonish, almost marionette-like characters. The technique perfect
ly captures the awkwardness of the preteen years, whether it
intends to or not.
The film is the latest from Imageworks, the Sony-owned compa
ny that created Polar Express. In fact, that same motion-based 3D
computer animation, in which actual actors are filmed and then ani
mated over, is used in House — to a much lesser effect. Indeed,
there was little need for the film to be computer animated at all. In
previous, far better CGI films (blessed be the truly incomparable
Pixar) humans are wisely set on the periphery as non-human forms

are personified. In House, the only
need for the animation is the house
itself, though heavily personified as
less human than it should be (as
we're led to believe that the soul of
the house is human). The best
moments of House attempt to cap
ture the charms of films like The
Sandlot, which required no ground
breaking technology to weave a
compelling childhood tale.
Unfortunately, the movie
becomes a clunky, sobering
reminder that compelling anima
tion is a lousy substitute for a sub
stantial story, and that, in main
stream cinema, process, however
impressive, means nothing in face
of the final product. After the
adorable maladroit of the first half
hour, archetypal suspenseful music
underscores the remainder of the
film, which mutates into a montage
of dull-as-James-Bond's-dishwash
er action sequences. As the kids
enter the house, the suspense is
built up to no real end. Instead of a
central climax, there are endless lit
tle surprises that have no real rele
vance to the house or the plot (for
example there is considerable
buildup to a giant slinky randomly
shooting out from the ceiling).
Additionally, the suspense is pro

longed to the extent that it becomes
ineffective albeit yawn-inducing.
The characters completely lose
whatever personality they'd previ
ously accrued as they spew cliches
like: "It's alive!" or "I'm too young
to die!" or "Don't look back!"
The house itself, however, is a
cleverly conceived set piece —
with leering window-eyes, animated
sidewalks, and a carpet tongue —
and credit must be given to whoev
er decided that the house should
have a uvula (and that the day
should be saved via a gag reflex).
The need for a back story on why
there always is a grumpy old man
living in a spooky-looking house (as
demanded in the likes of the
Halloween sequence of Meet Me in
St. Louis) is likewise clever.
However, the "twist" of back
ground information revealed —
involving a mean, grotesquely
obese ex-freak show performer —
is weaker than an afterthought, not
to mention highly misogynistic.
Apparently, there have been
promises made that the live-action
sequences from which the CGI was
culled will be available on the
Monster House DVD. To be per
fectly frank, seeing Kathleen
Turner wearing a giant Styrofoam
house and chasing children sounds
vastly more amusing than anything
in the final monstrosity that is
Monster House.
