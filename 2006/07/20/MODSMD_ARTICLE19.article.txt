# AT THE MOVIE HOUSE
## 'Monster House' eats portly kids 
### AMIN EL GAMAL ENTERTAINMENT REAL. (SCARY) ESTATE AGENT 
From the pocket
money of movie god
Steven Spielberg
comes proof that he
too, like us mortals,
has bowel movements.
This proof comes in
the form of the out of
season (Halloween in
July?) and mostly
dilapidated Monster
House, executively
produced by Spielberg.
House follows a
pre-teen, DJ (voiced
by Mitchel Musso),
who watches the
obligatory creepy
house-across-the-
street (none other
than, yes, Kathleen
Turner) from his bed
room window. DJ
notices that the crab
by, wizened owner of

the house, Mr. Nebbercracker (a very senile Steve Buscemi), has
a fit when children play on his lawn, and that toys mysteriously
disappear when they venture to the property — playing on an
archetype used in everything from Meet Me In St. Louis (1944)
to The Sandlot (1993). DJ's unheeding parents go out of town
and leave him with a babysitter Zee (voiced by a wonderfully
emo Maggie Gyllenhaal). On Halloween, DJ's friend Chowder
(Sam Lerner as the also obligatory fat-kid-sidekick) and the

object of both their desires,
a prim but street-smart prep
schooler Jenny (Spencer
Locke) join in the house
watching. Of course, it turns
out that the house is "alive"
(as Chowder yells at least
twice) and one very, very
hungry-ass mother.
The coming-of-age
antics that launch the film

(before it descends into an utterly uneven and soulless action
sequence) are irresistible — especially the dynamic between the
boys and Zee. When Chowder explains that, "a house just tried to
eat us," Zee replies after a slight delay, "No more Mountain Dew."
Much like Toy Story (1995), it pits the children in a world that is
inaccessible and hidden from adults. The highly stylized 3D anima
tion creates impressive photorealistic backdrops for the very car
toonish, almost marionette-like characters. The technique perfect
ly captures the awkwardness of the preteen years, whether it
intends to or not.
The film is the latest from Imageworks, the Sony-owned compa
ny that created Polar Express. In fact, that same motion-based 3D
computer animation, in which actual actors are filmed and then ani
mated over, is used in House — to a much lesser effect. Indeed,
there was little need for the film to be computer animated at all. In
previous, far better CGI films (blessed be the truly incomparable
Pixar) humans are wisely set on the periphery as non-human forms
