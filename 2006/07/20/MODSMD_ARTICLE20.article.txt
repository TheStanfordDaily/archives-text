# AT THE MOVIE HOUSE
## 'Lady in the Water" sinks to bottom 
### VICTOR FUSTÉ MILTON SOLORZANO ENTERTAINMENT SHYAMALAN-A-DING-DONGS 
Every once in a great while, a movie conies along that
illuminates an aspect of the human condition, tapping
into some primordial well of imagination to enlighten the
movie-goer and improve his quality of life. M. Night
Shyamalan's "Lady in the Water" is not one of these
movies.
Shyamalan's fifth film stars Paul Giamatti and contin
ues his downward spiral that began with the crapfest that
was "The Village" — though some claim the slump
started with "Signs". In honor of the director's attempts
at making a children's /horror / comedy / fantasy / tragedy
film, we have opted to review the first legitimate bomb of
the summer in order to offer you a "choose-your-own
adventure." Perhaps in your journey through the stun
ning landscape of imagination, you'll discover what the
hell Shyamalan was trying to achieve. Read on, but
BEWARE! There are scrunts in these here words...
The adventure begins here: You are the mild-man
nered, pudgy landlord named Cleveland Heep. You look
after a rundown apartment complex replete with stereo
typical, kooky characters such as: the five-daughtered,
liber-religious non-English speaking Mexican family; the
shrill Asian mother with the club-hopping daughter who
should have married a dentist; a chorus of idiot stoners;
an earthy old cat-lady; and finally, the Uni-bomer-like
recluse that watches war reports on TV. Suddenly you
notice a ripple across your lima bean shaped pool. Do
you:
Option A: Turn on the floodlights and inspect the
pool, (if you choose this path, go swiftly like the wind to
the final section)
Option B: Armed with nothing but fear and your
trusty Mag-Lite, you step into the darkened pool and
embark on a fantastic quest, (if you choose this path, go
to next section)
Option B: After choosing to step into the darkened

pool, you meet a naked water nymph whose presence is
explained by a convenient Asian bedtime story. In said
story, Shyamalan puts letters together with the efficiency
of a word jumble to produce such masterpieces of
nomenclature as "narf' ("Pinky & The Brain" already
claimed that one, sir), "scrunt." "tartutek," "action the
eagle,"and of course the "jeji scrunt." Do you:
Option C: Call the police, (if you choose this path,
peruse your way to the final section.)
Option D: Call on the inspired writer on the third
floor who bears a striking resemblance to someone you
know...(if you choose thus path, progress to the next sec
tion).
Option D: You travel upstairs, carrying the water
nymph and the knowledge of her pseudo-religious BS
explaining her being in Philadelphia. The writer, brought
to miraculous epiphany by her waxy presence, embarks
on his own journey to change the world. Surprise, he's M.
Night Shyamalan, writer/director/pretentious martyr for
his own cause! How reflexive that his character's musings
on politics will ultimately change the world into an Eden,
born in the Midwest. * But back to Cleveland. Aware of
the sudden gravitas of this film, do you:
Option E: Fall to your knees and worship the all-pow
erful demi-god, Shyamalan. (if you choose this path,
grovel on towards the final section.)
Option F: Face your fear in the form of a walking
clump of crab grass named Jeji. (if you choose this path,
use a thin piece of aluminum pipe to fight your way to the
final section.)
Final Section: Oops, you fell into a plot hole! From
here the story meanders into a magical mystery land
without substance or cohesion. At this point you've
learned that fairytales form the backbone of this inverte
brate tale — a puzzle of a film enclosing an enigma,
wrapped in a conundrum all around a piece of crap.
♦Speaking of reflexive, apparently the only thing more
frightening to Shyamalan than a wolf made out of grass
is a movie critic. The appearance of the astute
movie critic character is clearly the director's
pre-emptive strike on those of us that dare to
criticize this awful pile. It's almost as if he knew
the movie was going to be panned by critics
before it was made. Maybe he can see into the
future...or perhaps speak to the dead. Now that
would be an interesting movie premise.
