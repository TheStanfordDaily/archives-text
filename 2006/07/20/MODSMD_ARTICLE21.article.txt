ENTERTAINMENT: So how
was shooting this sequel,
'Gerks II?"
Brian O'Halloran (Dante):
Shooting it was a joy. It was
like going back to summer
camp with the friends you've
always wanted to hang out
with. It's the same crew, for the
most part, the same producers.
And working with Jeff; I've
been fortunate to work with
Jeff over the years, with these
same two characters many dif
ferent times — with the
"Clerks" cartoon series that
came out in 2000, we did a
short film for Jay Leno soon
thereafter. It's been a joy.
ENT: How many times have
you said that?
Jeff Anderson (Randal): This
is the first time I've heard "It's
been a joy."
BO: Yeah, I went down to
Borders and got myself a the
saurus. I was like, I don't want
to bore them to death.
"Absolutely harmonious!" I
got to save the words so I don't
blow them all now.
ENT: "Jersey Girl" bombed.
So is doing "Clerks II" Kevin
Smith's backup?
ENT: How was it embodying
these characters again?
BO: It's like putting on an old
pair of sneakers that feel great,
or going and visiting that group
of friends that you haven't seen
in a while. It's nothing strange,
it's nothing odd, it's not like, I
got to brush up, I need to watch
the movie again, it's nothing
like that at all. It's not too hard
for us to get into it. If you gave
us the phone book, we'd prob
ably talk it out, and you'd prob
ably be like, oh my God, it's
still Dante and Randal right
now. Jeff?
JA: Uh... It was a joy.
BO: Holding onto that line?
JA: It's my new out.
ENT: So Brian, how was mak
ing out with Kevin Smith's

wife?
BO: It was kinda weird, this
voyeuristic type of weird.
Especially in the position we
were in, that she was sitting on
my lap in a swing. And with the
bigger budget we had on this
one, we had this crane shot that
comes down from the roof and
follows these two Catholic
school girls coming out of the
restaurant and swoops over to
us making out. And when we
first started doing this move
ment, the crane and dolly
movement was hitched by a
bump in the rail or something,
so we had to do it something
like 13 times. Kevin told me
that by the 13th or 14th time
watching the re-take of this, he
finally realized, O'Halloran is
kissing my wife longer than
I've ever kissed my wife before
my pants have reached my
ankles. Meanwhile, there's me
as the actor and friend, and me
kissing my boss's wife, I'm like,
please don't let the launch
sequence start.
JA: We did a radio show this
morning and we had Kevin on
the phone, and I said to Kevin,
1 said, "Kevin, when you and
your wife fight, do you go,
'Man, every time I kiss you I
taste Brian O'Halloran'?"
ENT: What did he say?
JA: He was like, "Uh... no.
Thanks for putting that in my
head."
ENT: So do you guys all hang
out together, and recreate the
View Askew Universe?
BO: Not necessarily. I mean,
Jay does live with Kevin, Jay
has always lived with Kevin,
pretty much is his hetero
manservant.
J A: Yeah, every time I go to
Kevin's, I have to wear a back
wards baseball cap, chew gum.
That's pretty much what we
do.
ENT: So there's a man-donkey
sex scene in this movie. What
did you feel about that
sequence?
BO: Funny, that guy was half
of our documentary team,
doing the behind-the-scenes

stuff. So to get him into that
outfit was kinda funny, to see
this guy who was our behind
the-scenes cameraman now on
camera, making sweet love t0...
JA: And oddly enough he was
wearing that outfit on days he
wasn't shooting.
ENT: What was the donkey's
name?
JA: Asphalt. That was the real
donkey's name. Like the street.
BO: Ass-fault. Two s's. You
know, like ass-crack, in the ass.
JA: There was no fault with
that ass.
ENT: Any last words?
JA: F—k. Actually, I got one
for you, I'm gonna throw this
out to you guys because you're
college kids. I heard this morn
ing on the radio: College kids
have voted the iPod more
important than beer. I'm
shocked. I didn't realize there
was such a gap. This doesn't
say anything good about your
generation here. But speaking
of iPods, I was segueing so
effordessly. For the first time
ever, "Clerks II" is again
breaking ground. We recorded
a commentary track that you'll
be able to download onto your
iPod that will be released the
second week of the film, so that
you can go see the film and
then go back into the film and
line up your iPod with the cred
its and listen to the commen
tary track. As you sit in the the
ater you can then listen to us
talk about behind the scenes.
First time it's ever been done
for a film. So I think it's going
to be something you're going
to see all movies doing now,
and we're the first film to do it.
BO: So don't be surprised sit
ting in the theater with iPods.
JA: All you college kids that
love your iPods, rather than
drinking.
BO: I've actually snuck beer
into movies. In Japan they
have vending machines where
you can buy beer, for God's
sake. Thanks guys. Especially
because you're not drinking
and listening to your iPods.

As one who has followed the exploits of
incompetent Quik-Stop clerks Randal and
Dante since before I could multiply by 37
(sorry Mom, Zack let me watch it when you
weren't around), there was a pale cast over the
aptly named "Clerks II" that even Jay high on
snoochie boochies couldn't hope to lift.
Perhaps it's my perspective as a brand-new col
lege graduate, perhaps it's my intrinsic human
desire to accomplish something (anything, real
ly) with my life, but watching my anti-heroes of
yore still sputtering cleverly constructed pop
culture nonsense a decade later was just... well,
sad.

Fortunately, "Clerks II"
writer/director/Silent Bob
Kevin Smith gave his
newest entry in the View
Askiewniverse a big
enough spoonful of tongue
in-cheek to help the medi
cine go down. After suppos
edly closing the book on the
adventures of Jay and Silent
Bob and striking back with
the mediocre "Jersey Girl,"

Smith has returned to what he knows best —
dick and fart jokes. This return is done in full
wink mode — the making-of content on the
film's Web site is entitled "Back to the Well"
for chrissakes — and this slick meta subtext
allows the main characters to be more out-and
out pathetic than they could otherwise get
away with.
This second chapter begins where the first
ended — the Quik-Stop convenience store.
This time, however, it's been burned to the
ground. Forced to find a new jobs, and knowing
only one industry, Dante and Randal (Brian
O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson, reprising their
roles from 1994) find themselves behind the
counter of the local Mooby's, a franchised
burger joint perhaps conceived jointly by
Ronald McDonald and Walt Disney. This time,
however, Randal and Dante share the screen
with actresses who can actually act. First,
there's Kevin Smith's anachronistically hot
wife (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith) playing
Emma, Dante's controlling fianc6 who has his
whole life planned out in front of him. Like
Veronica in this film's predecessor, Emma
wants Dante to apply himself. And like Dante

in this film's predecessor, Dante resists.
Secondly, and complicating the matter, is
Becky (Rosario Dawson [what the hell is a
legitimate actor doing here? Eh, it's for the
best]), the manager, who tickles Dante's fancy
in a way Mrs. Smith only wishes she could.
Meanwhile, Randal is behind the counter,
regurgitating witty Kevin Smith banter with co
loser Elias (the overly obnoxious Trevor
Fehrman). Either you're a fan of Smith-isms, or
you're not. I am, but the convos talking about
Grido or Han shooting first, the racial interpre
tation of the term "porch-monkey" or going
ass-to-mouth have lost a lot of their luster and
their ability to shock. That said, it's still darn
funny.
Jay (the laudably consistent Jason Mewes)

and Bob are still kicking it
and selling their wares out
side Dante and Randal's
store. This time, however,
the two trench-coaters are
clean, a prime example of
art imitating Jason Mewes
having finally gotten on the
horse for good, not to men
tion Kevin Smith believing
he has reached some kind of
emotional maturity this

time around.
But does he? Of course not. "Clerks II" is
the story of a man (call him "Kevin" or
"Dante," take your pick) knowing his limita
tions. As morals go, this isn't the most intelli
gent, or optimistic, one around. The original,
for all of its talk of giz-moppers and its Pmto
sized budget, had real emotional honesty
behind it — a coming of age tale for mid-90s
slackers that rang true. This time, Smith had
enough money for real actors, color film, and
even a Broadway-style dance number. But
putting a simplified autobiography on screen
(Smith's daughter, in addition to his wife,
makes an appearance) is just too easy for it to
carry any real weight. That said, for a movie
whose emotional climax occurs during a scene
of man-on-donkey love, perhaps I couldn't
have asked for more.
Smith's ability to be unobtrusively self-ref
erential at least somewhat mitigates the thor
ough pathetic-ness of it all. While not achieving
everything Smith could have hoped for,
"Clerks II" makes this Askiewniverse fan at
least OK with the fact that he went back to the
well one more time.
