## CAMPUS BRIEFS Fuller Collection digitized, available online through library 
### 
Over 380 hours of rare lectures and public talks by the late
inventor R. Buckminster Fuller can now be downloaded
through Stanford University Libraries. The recently debut
ing, fully digitized multimedia archive features Fuller's work,
made popular during the 1960s and 19705.
Fuller's mathematical concept of "Synergistics" and his
geodesic dome "Spaceship Earth" were among his signature
contributions, now documented in 1700 hours of audio and
video recordings, following acquirement by Stanford
University Libraries in 1999.
In addition to Fuller's work are historical records and pho
tographs of Stanford University, geological survey maps,
records and university publications.
"It is quite appropriate that Bucky Fuller is leading the way
for our digital multimedia offerings," said University Librarian
Michael Keller in a news release. "Digitizing materials invites
greater use in teaching, learning and research, and enables new
ways of understanding and using library holdings."
The R. Buckminster Fuller Digital Collection is available to all
registered users online at http://collections.stanford.edu/bucky.

Green Foothills lawsuit delays trail
construction
Construction has been halted on the S-l trail along Page
Mill Road as a result of a lawsuit filed by the Committee for
Green Foothills, July 9. The goal of this lawsuit is to reverse
an agreement made five years ago to build two recreational
trails in exchange for permission from Santa Clara County to
erect new buildings on campus.
Lennie Roberts, legislative advocate for the Committee
for Green Foothills, cited environmental considerations,
including the damaging effect that trail traffic would have on
native endangered species. Larry Horton, Stanford
University director of government and community relations,
meanwhile said in a news release that the "lawsuit is without
merit and contains errors of fact and law."
Filed two days before a grading permit was issued for the
trail, the lawsuit has cut short the University's work on the
trail until the lawsuit is resolved.

Stanford selects 16 stem-cell research
trainees
Amid controversy with President Bush expected to veto a
proposed expansion of federal support for stem-cell research,
the School of Medicine has selected 16 stem-cell research sci
entists to receive the University's funded training.
The 16 researchers come from 11 departments in the
schools of medicine and engineering, and will join nine other
researchers in training at the National Institute of Health. The
training, costing a total of $3.7 million over three years, is fund
ed by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, cre
ated after the passage of Proposition 71 in November 2004.
Michael Longaker, MD, a professor of surgery as well as
chair of the advisory committee for Stanford's Program in
Regenerative Medicine, described the training program in a
news release as hopefully having "a basic scientist and a physi
cian scientist for each trainee." Focusing on ethics, regenerative
medicine and stem-cell biology, the training is geared toward
yielding regenerative medicine research that is clinically useful.

Harvard hires Stanford financial
manager
The Boston Globe reported Saturday that Harvard
University has hired Mark Taborsky of the Stanford
Management Company. Previously chief financial officer
(CFO) for Stanford's company, and currently a managing
director for bonds and article tools, Taborsky will now serve
as vice president of the Harvard Management Company.
There he will oversee approximately half of Harvard's $25.9
billion endowment (the world's largest higher-education
fund, compared to Stanford's $12.2 billion endowment).
