## Researchers deny poor animal care Report identifies Stanford as No. 17 worst law violator 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A report published last month by Stop
Animal Exploitation NOW! (SAEN), an
organization opposing the abuse of ani
mals in research laboratories, ranked
Stanford seventeenth in terms of the
number of Animal Welfare Act (AWA)
violations in 2005. With nine violations in
eleven months, Stanford was the only
institution in the western U.S. to make
the top 20.
A representative of the Stanford
Veterinary Service Center (VSC) objects
to the SAEN report that she says misrep
resents animal research by making the
"most egregious, inaccurate statements."
According to SAEN
SAEN's conclusions are based on
inspections conducted by the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS), a division of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA)
that inspects facilities that use animals
in research. APHIS identified violations
at Stanford in the areas of veterinary
care and primary enclosures, as well as

the University's Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (lACUC),
which is responsible for enforcing the
AWA and oversees animals' living con
ditions.
"The violations are very serious in
that they demonstrate that the lACUC
itself has no interest in following federal
law," said SAEN Executive Director
Michael Budkie.
According to Budkie, Stanford, like
other research universities, conducts
highly invasive experiments that involve
confining primates to restraint chairs,
depriving them of water and surgically
attaching devices to their skulls. Budkie
believes that efforts should be made to
eliminate redundant research.
"The primate projects at Stanford are
among the most duplicated in the United
States and could be eliminated without
any loss to science whatsoever," Budkie
said.
Budkie claimed that animal experi
mentation is primarily motivated by
financial concerns.
"SAEN ranked Stanford 19th in the
U.S. for bringing in approximately
$163,374,000 per year from the Federal
government for animal experimenta
tion," he said. "This is not about science
or human health — it is about money."
Although the 2005 report is the first

time Stanford has ranked in the top 20,
recent Stanford Law School graduate
Matthew Liebman, a member of Animal
Rights on the Farm (ARF) and Student
Animal Legal Defense Fund (SALDF),
said that Stanford has a "history of AW A
violations and an institutional antago
nism toward animal rights."
"Animal-rights advocates have not
reviewed Stanford's USDA inspections
since the mid-19905," Liebman said.
"ARF and SALDF are in the process of
using the Freedom of Information Act to
get inspection documents for the last 15
years."
Liebman believes that in order for the
University to effectively protect animal
welfare, it needs to be forthcoming about
the procedures and number of animals
used in research as well as the amount of
suffering endured by the animals.
"As an elite and prestigious universi
ty, Stanford should be actively recruiting
and supporting researchers in the field of
alternatives to animal research, such as
computer modeling, stem-cell research
and in-vitro methods," Liebman said. "It
should immediately cease some of its
most offensive animal experiments, such
as the cocaine addiction tests on juvenile
monkeys."
SAEN has not received any response from
Stanford concerning its recent report.
"Avoiding accountability and transparency to
students and the public is the laboratory's modus
operandi," Liebman said. "Animal Rights on the
Farm has been campaigning for the last year to
increase transparency at Stanford, but the Research
Animal Facility at Stanford Medical School has
been entirely resistant."
According to the Stanford VSC
Although recognizing that individuals have a
right to object to animal research, Dr. Linda Cork,
director of the Veterinary Service Center and chair
of the Department of Comparative Medicine,
believes that animal research is "essential to scien
tific advancement and to advances in human health,
based on [her] more than thirty years of personal
experiences in science."
In order to analyze the laboratory animal-care
program at Stanford and the USDA's inspection
findings, Cork thinks that one must first understand
that the USDA reports are structured so as to place
widely differing items into a single category.
According to Cork, broad categorization of vio
lation types can produce misleading results. For
example, if a drug with an expired use date is found
in a laboratory, regardless of whether it is used to
treat an animal, it will be cited as a violation of
Section 2.33, which deals with inadequate veteri
nary care.
A single event may involve several sections of
the AWA, so an institution may receive multiple
citations for a single event. Cork identified an
instance at Stanford when a monkey got out of its
cage. The incident was reported to the lACUC and
USDA; however, the laboratory was unable to
determine how the animal managed to escape from
its enclosure. As a result, the USDA cited the labo
ratory twice — once for failure to confine the mon
key in a secure enclosure and once for failure to
train individuals on how to implement proper lock
ing mechanisms — even though the actual cause of
the problem was never discovered.
The most recent USDA inspection, cited by
SAEN, contains several citations under Section
2.31, which deals with activities of the lACUC.
One of the citations was for a large pig that a
USDA inspector thought walked with an abnormal
gait because of overgrown hooves.

"The inspector's opinion about the pig's gait was
not shared by experienced Stanford veterinarians
(one of whom, unlike the USDA inspector, was a
board certified specialist in the care of large ani
mals), and all of whom were familiar with the ani
mal," Cork said. "The pig's hooves had not been
trimmed to avoid stressing the animal and to avoid
the risk of administering anesthesia. Nevertheless,
to respond to the inspector's citation, the pig was
subjected to anesthesia; its hooves were trimmed,
but its gait remained unchanged."
Several other citations under Section 2.31 dealt
with the IACUC for not determining the training
qualifications of a surgeon, for inadequate literature
search, for a protocol in which changes were made
without lACUC approval and for inadequate justi
fication for using a specific number of animals.
"The individual was an M.D. and an experienced
surgeon who was receiving additional species-specif
ic training by Stanford veterinarians to improve the
surgical outcome," Cork said. "The surgeries took
place in appropriate facilities, using aseptic surgical
techniques with proper anesthesia, postoperative
analgesia and care being provided by trained veteri
nary technicians. Animal welfare was being empha
sized. The USDA's concerns were not about animal
welfare, but were about appropriate documentation
and oversight of a complicated, ongoing study."
Cork noted that the SAEN report fails to men
tion that the USDA's inspection also describes
Stanford's new system for preventing problems with
protocol review.
"Stanford invested significant financial and per
sonnel resources to develop this system, which will
make it easier for submitters and reviewers to com
ply with and document all regulatory require
ments," Cork said.
Cork also stated that improving Stanford's large
and diverse animal care program is an "ongoing
activity that takes place on several fronts."
"Stanford provides high quality animal care, but
we always strive to do better," she said. "The
lACUC has a subcommittee that studies and rec
ommends ways to improve the psychological enrich
ment of all species.
"Stanford has developed a sophisticated system
for veterinary medical records. Our diagnostic lab
for laboratory animals provides quick, accurate
results for research and diagnosis. The VSC has
experienced animal caretakers and a faculty and
staff of skilled veterinary specialists to care for
Stanford's research animals.
"In short, Stanford provides most of the clinical
resources for laboratory animal care that are usual
ly found only in a major veterinary teaching hospi
tal. It does so because it cares about animal welfare
and because it values good science."

the University's Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (lACUC),
which is responsible for enforcing the
AWA and oversees animals' living con
ditions.
"The violations are very serious in
that they demonstrate that the lACUC
itself has no interest in following federal
law," said SAEN Executive Director
Michael Budkie.
According to Budkie, Stanford, like
other research universities, conducts
highly invasive experiments that involve
confining primates to restraint chairs,
depriving them of water and surgically
attaching devices to their skulls. Budkie
believes that efforts should be made to
eliminate redundant research.
"The primate projects at Stanford are
among the most duplicated in the United
States and could be eliminated without
any loss to science whatsoever," Budkie
said.
Budkie claimed that animal experi
mentation is primarily motivated by
financial concerns.
"SAEN ranked Stanford 19th in the
U.S. for bringing in approximately
$163,374,000 per year from the Federal
government for animal experimenta
tion," he said. "This is not about science
or human health — it is about money."
Although the 2005 report is the first

time Stanford has ranked in the top 20,
recent Stanford Law School graduate
Matthew Liebman, a member of Animal
Rights on the Farm (ARF) and Student
Animal Legal Defense Fund (SALDF),
said that Stanford has a "history of AW A
violations and an institutional antago
nism toward animal rights."
"Animal-rights advocates have not
reviewed Stanford's USDA inspections
since the mid-19905," Liebman said.
"ARF and SALDF are in the process of
using the Freedom of Information Act to
get inspection documents for the last 15
years."
Liebman believes that in order for the
University to effectively protect animal
welfare, it needs to be forthcoming about
the procedures and number of animals
used in research as well as the amount of
suffering endured by the animals.
"As an elite and prestigious universi
ty, Stanford should be actively recruiting
and supporting researchers in the field of
alternatives to animal research, such as
computer modeling, stem-cell research
and in-vitro methods," Liebman said. "It
should immediately cease some of its
most offensive animal experiments, such
as the cocaine addiction tests on juvenile
monkeys."
SAEN has not received any response from
Stanford concerning its recent report.
"Avoiding accountability and transparency to
students and the public is the laboratory's modus
operandi," Liebman said. "Animal Rights on the
Farm has been campaigning for the last year to
increase transparency at Stanford, but the Research
Animal Facility at Stanford Medical School has
been entirely resistant."
According to the Stanford VSC
Although recognizing that individuals have a
right to object to animal research, Dr. Linda Cork,
director of the Veterinary Service Center and chair
of the Department of Comparative Medicine,
believes that animal research is "essential to scien
tific advancement and to advances in human health,
based on [her] more than thirty years of personal
experiences in science."
In order to analyze the laboratory animal-care
program at Stanford and the USDA's inspection
findings, Cork thinks that one must first understand
that the USDA reports are structured so as to place
widely differing items into a single category.
According to Cork, broad categorization of vio
lation types can produce misleading results. For
example, if a drug with an expired use date is found
in a laboratory, regardless of whether it is used to
treat an animal, it will be cited as a violation of
Section 2.33, which deals with inadequate veteri
nary care.
A single event may involve several sections of
the AWA, so an institution may receive multiple
citations for a single event. Cork identified an
instance at Stanford when a monkey got out of its
cage. The incident was reported to the lACUC and
USDA; however, the laboratory was unable to
determine how the animal managed to escape from
its enclosure. As a result, the USDA cited the labo
ratory twice — once for failure to confine the mon
key in a secure enclosure and once for failure to
train individuals on how to implement proper lock
ing mechanisms — even though the actual cause of
the problem was never discovered.
The most recent USDA inspection, cited by
SAEN, contains several citations under Section
2.31, which deals with activities of the lACUC.
One of the citations was for a large pig that a
USDA inspector thought walked with an abnormal
gait because of overgrown hooves.

"The inspector's opinion about the pig's gait was
not shared by experienced Stanford veterinarians
(one of whom, unlike the USDA inspector, was a
board certified specialist in the care of large ani
mals), and all of whom were familiar with the ani
mal," Cork said. "The pig's hooves had not been
trimmed to avoid stressing the animal and to avoid
the risk of administering anesthesia. Nevertheless,
to respond to the inspector's citation, the pig was
subjected to anesthesia; its hooves were trimmed,
but its gait remained unchanged."
Several other citations under Section 2.31 dealt
with the IACUC for not determining the training
qualifications of a surgeon, for inadequate literature
search, for a protocol in which changes were made
without lACUC approval and for inadequate justi
fication for using a specific number of animals.
"The individual was an M.D. and an experienced
surgeon who was receiving additional species-specif
ic training by Stanford veterinarians to improve the
surgical outcome," Cork said. "The surgeries took
place in appropriate facilities, using aseptic surgical
techniques with proper anesthesia, postoperative
analgesia and care being provided by trained veteri
nary technicians. Animal welfare was being empha
sized. The USDA's concerns were not about animal
welfare, but were about appropriate documentation
and oversight of a complicated, ongoing study."
Cork noted that the SAEN report fails to men
tion that the USDA's inspection also describes
Stanford's new system for preventing problems with
protocol review.
"Stanford invested significant financial and per
sonnel resources to develop this system, which will
make it easier for submitters and reviewers to com
ply with and document all regulatory require
ments," Cork said.
Cork also stated that improving Stanford's large
and diverse animal care program is an "ongoing
activity that takes place on several fronts."
"Stanford provides high quality animal care, but
we always strive to do better," she said. "The
lACUC has a subcommittee that studies and rec
ommends ways to improve the psychological enrich
ment of all species.
"Stanford has developed a sophisticated system
for veterinary medical records. Our diagnostic lab
for laboratory animals provides quick, accurate
results for research and diagnosis. The VSC has
experienced animal caretakers and a faculty and
staff of skilled veterinary specialists to care for
Stanford's research animals.
"In short, Stanford provides most of the clinical
resources for laboratory animal care that are usual
ly found only in a major veterinary teaching hospi
tal. It does so because it cares about animal welfare
and because it values good science."
A report published last month by Stop
Animal Exploitation NOW! (SAEN), an
organization opposing the abuse of ani
mals in research laboratories, ranked
Stanford seventeenth in terms of the
number of Animal Welfare Act (AWA)
violations in 2005. With nine violations in
eleven months, Stanford was the only
institution in the western U.S. to make
the top 20.
A representative of the Stanford
Veterinary Service Center (VSC) objects
to the SAEN report that she says misrep
resents animal research by making the
"most egregious, inaccurate statements."
According to SAEN
SAEN's conclusions are based on
inspections conducted by the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS), a division of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA)
that inspects facilities that use animals
in research. APHIS identified violations
at Stanford in the areas of veterinary
care and primary enclosures, as well as

the University's Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (lACUC),
which is responsible for enforcing the
AWA and oversees animals' living con
ditions.
"The violations are very serious in
