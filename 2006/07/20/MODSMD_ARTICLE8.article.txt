## Researchers deny poor animal care Report identifies Stanford as No. 17 worst law violator 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A report published last month by Stop
Animal Exploitation NOW! (SAEN), an
organization opposing the abuse of ani
mals in research laboratories, ranked
Stanford seventeenth in terms of the
number of Animal Welfare Act (AWA)
violations in 2005. With nine violations in
eleven months, Stanford was the only
institution in the western U.S. to make
the top 20.
A representative of the Stanford
Veterinary Service Center (VSC) objects
to the SAEN report that she says misrep
resents animal research by making the
"most egregious, inaccurate statements."
According to SAEN
SAEN's conclusions are based on
inspections conducted by the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS), a division of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA)
that inspects facilities that use animals
in research. APHIS identified violations
at Stanford in the areas of veterinary
care and primary enclosures, as well as

the University's Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (lACUC),
which is responsible for enforcing the
AWA and oversees animals' living con
ditions.
"The violations are very serious in
that they demonstrate that the lACUC
itself has no interest in following federal
law," said SAEN Executive Director
Michael Budkie.
According to Budkie, Stanford, like
other research universities, conducts
highly invasive experiments that involve
confining primates to restraint chairs,
depriving them of water and surgically
attaching devices to their skulls. Budkie
believes that efforts should be made to
eliminate redundant research.
"The primate projects at Stanford are
among the most duplicated in the United
States and could be eliminated without
any loss to science whatsoever," Budkie
said.
Budkie claimed that animal experi
mentation is primarily motivated by
financial concerns.
"SAEN ranked Stanford 19th in the
U.S. for bringing in approximately
$163,374,000 per year from the Federal
government for animal experimenta
tion," he said. "This is not about science
or human health â€” it is about money."
Although the 2005 report is the first

time Stanford has ranked in the top 20,
recent Stanford Law School graduate
Matthew Liebman, a member of Animal
Rights on the Farm (ARF) and Student
Animal Legal Defense Fund (SALDF),
said that Stanford has a "history of AW A
violations and an institutional antago
nism toward animal rights."
"Animal-rights advocates have not
reviewed Stanford's USDA inspections
since the mid-19905," Liebman said.
"ARF and SALDF are in the process of
using the Freedom of Information Act to
get inspection documents for the last 15
years."
Liebman believes that in order for the
University to effectively protect animal
welfare, it needs to be forthcoming about
the procedures and number of animals
used in research as well as the amount of
suffering endured by the animals.
"As an elite and prestigious universi
ty, Stanford should be actively recruiting
and supporting researchers in the field of
alternatives to animal research, such as
computer modeling, stem-cell research
and in-vitro methods," Liebman said. "It
should immediately cease some of its
most offensive animal experiments, such
as the cocaine addiction tests on juvenile
monkeys."
