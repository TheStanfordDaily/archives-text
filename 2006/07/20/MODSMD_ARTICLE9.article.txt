As the Department of Anthropology hosts indigenous arti
facts and paintings by the Martu aborigines, Stanford and
Native American tribes across the western United States are
hosting Martu family members themselves.
Douglas and Rebecca Bird, assistant professors of
Anthropological Sciences, brought the family — Nyalangka
Taylor, her daughter and two grandchildren — to the country
as a part of a bio-cultural exchange project. The Martu are an
aboriginal tribe of about 800, and lived without Western influ
ence until the last 40 years.
Taylor's mother began the "Outstation Movement" to
return to traditional Martu culture and life in the mid-1980s.
The family currently lives in a desert camp at Parnngurr; after
the Martu gained legal recognition in 2003 of their homeland
ownership in Western Australia.
In its six-week duration. Bird hopes that the Martu bio-cul
tural exchange project proves significant for both the Martu
family and community members who learn from their exhibit.
"In terms of the art exhibit being here, it has brought peo
ple in, [including] some people who don't know much anthro
pology," he said. "[Nyalangka] was born in 1956 in the desert
and had never seen Europeans, let alone had any significant
contact with white settlers until she was a teen. So, for her to go
from a world in which there were no strangers and everyone
was kin, to now having a global perspective, for me, has been
really significant."
On their trip in the United States, the Martu arc visiting
Native-American communities in the West, sharing their art
through activities such as basket and rug weaving, among other

cultural traditions.
"We're in Salt Lake City right now and have a reception at
the Department of Anthropology of Utah on the 20th, and
from there we're going down to the Four Corners region,"
Douglas Bird said in a phone interview with The Stanford
Weekly. "We have a big tour of a Navajo Reservation, and
we'll be going to a whole range of ceremonies and dances and
that sort of thing with some Navajo friends."
During their visits to the communities, the Martu plan to
discuss resource and land management, as well as health con
cerns. The family has a contaminated local water supply after
the Parnngurr area they live in was used for uranium mining.
The Martu have also discovered similarities in government
through their travels; they shared a commonality of decentral
ized self-government with the Gidutikad band of the Northern
Paiute, as well as the Pit River tribe.
"There is no centralization of economy or politics; every
thing is distributed evenly" Douglas Bird said in an interview
