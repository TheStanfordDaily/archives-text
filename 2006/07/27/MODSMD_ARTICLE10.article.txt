## Childcare center planned New center will give priority to faculty, graduate students 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A new childcare center will be built on
Olmsted Road, near the southeast corner
of Serra Street and El Camino Real, to
serve infants through children five years of
age. The facility will only be available to
Stanford affiliates, with priority given to
faculty and graduate students.
Construction is scheduled to begin in mid
-2007 and completed in summer 2008,
according to Project Manager Susan
Rozakis.
"We are in the initial planning stages
for an approximately 8,000-square-foot
facility," Rozakis said. "The initial pro
gram is for the center to accommodate
close to 100 children, who will enjoy
amenities similar to those at the existing
centers on campus, such as tree-shaded
outdoor play areas."
The Children's Creative Learning
Center, which currently operates the
Stanford Arboretum Children's Center,
will manage the new facility.
"[The new childcare center] will be a
wonderful new addition to our high-quali
ty children's programs on campus," said
Carol Skladany, resource administrator in
the Work Life Office. "There is a great
need for childcare on campus and in the
surrounding community. Approximately
425 families are currently on waitlists for
the existing centers."
Christine Griffith, associate dean of stu
dent affairs and director of the Graduate
Life Office, echoed a similar message con
cerning the high demand for childcare
among the graduate family population.
"The childcare waiting lists and infor
mation collected from surveys over the last
several years highlight the need for more
childcare and more care for infants and
toddlers," Griffith said. "The new center
will ease childcare concerns for some stu
dents; however, the childcare needs of
graduate students are varied and cannot
always be addressed by center care. For
example, some families may desire part
time in-home care, and that may be best
addressed by a nanny-share or a child care
giver in the home."
For those who do use the new facility,

Griffith believes that the center's location
adjacent to Escondido Village will be easi
ly accessible for graduate students living
on and off campus. Moreover, she notes
the importance of the space being priori
tized for infants and toddlers because this
age group comprises over 60 percent of the
children in Escondido Village, the on-cam
pus housing for graduate families.
While families await the new center,
Griffith recommended that they take
advantage of the "most comprehensive
source of information and guidance" con
cerning childcare at Stanford — the
Work Life Office. A satellite office in
Escondido Village provides posting space
where parents and caregivers can connect,
a resource library for parents and individ
ual family consultation about childcare
needs and available resources.
Griffith considers the new childcare
center as part of a larger initiative to
improve the quality of graduate-student
life at Stanford.
"We built studio apartments, are cur
rently building more graduate housing,
and opened a Graduate Community
Center two years ago," Griffith said. "A
new childcare center is a wonderful com
plement to those efforts."
Although the childcare center will ben
efit the Stanford community, one popula
tion is noticeably not given priority to use
the facility — postdoctoral fellows.
"We are very disappointed that
Post Docs will not be included among those
with priority at the new childcare center,"
said Karen Wehner and Christopher
Potter, co-chairs of the Stanford
University Postdoctoral Association
(SUPD), in a joint statement to The
Stanford Weekly.
Since postdoctoral fellows are classified
as students at Stanford, Wehner and Potter
had hoped that they would also be includ
ed in the plans for the childcare center.
They noted that graduate school and post
doctoral appointments are taking longer
than ever to complete, resulting in an aging
postdoctoral community.
"Access to affordable and convenient
childcare is of great concern to the
Stanford postdoctoral community,"
Wehner and Potter said in their statement.
"Lack of such childcare is forcing many
