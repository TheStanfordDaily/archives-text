# SUMMER PROGRAMS
## High-school students experience college early High School Summer College students take University classes 
### HUNTER BARNS 
Approximately 360 rising high school juniors
and seniors are living their dream of being
Stanford University students this summer through
Summer Session's High School Summer College
program.
Open to high-school juniors, seniors and
mature sophomores, the program seeks appli
cants who have demonstrated that they are acad
emically motivated and ready for a hands-on col
lege experience. Students in the program take
undergraduate courses and earn Stanford
University credit, which will most likely transfer
to their respective college.
"We look for students who are academically
advanced, as summer college students take regu
lar university courses sitting in class with under
graduate, and even graduate, students," said
Teresa Nishikawa, director of admissions and stu
dent services for the program. "We also look for
students who are mature enough to live on their
own for eight weeks.
"This is a huge time commitment for both the
student and their family. This is often the first
time a student has been away from their family for
such an extended period of time. However, for
most of our students, this will be a reality in twelve
months when they go away to college."
Students not only spend a long time away from
home, but for many, home is as far away as
Europe, Asia or Africa. This year, international
students comprise about 10 percent of the pro
gram.
Just as far-reaching, though, are the incentives
for attaining early credit from Stanford as colleges
become increasingly selective. The program offers
open enrollment to many undergraduate-level
classes offered during the summer, as well as an
SAT preparation course and a college selection
and application course.
Briana Robertoni, a rising college freshman
from Massachusetts, said she chose the Stanford
High School Summer College because she "want
ed to be associated with an institution that holds
such a respectable position in the academic com
munity."

"Also, I love to learn, and what better place to
do it than Stanford?" Robertoni added. "I knew I
would be challenged and inspired here."
Thorn Scher, a rising high-school senior from
Murrieta, Calif., intends to apply to Stanford this
fall.
"After this summer, 1 want to apply more than
I had when 1 first came," Scher said. "I'm halfway
through my time here and 1 simply love it."
A trained staff of Stanford undergraduates
serves as residence counselors and mentors at
Lagunita Court. The residential staff strives to
make each house a warm and inviting home for
the students who live there, and to help students
take advantage of all that Stanford and the Bay
Area have to offer.
"Summer College is not a camp," Nishikawa
said. "We treat students as emerging scholars. We
strive to give participants a well rounded residen
tial education experience comparable to what
incoming frosh might encounter."
Madison Bell, a rising Stanford junior and
mentor for the High School Summer College pro
gram, greatly enjoys her involvement as a coun
selor and Stanford representative.
"[The program] allows students the freedom to
explore their academic interests, while still leaving
time for them to form bonds with each other,
become involved in the community and get a feel
for what life at Stanford is really about," Bell said.
Other than classes, the high-school students
are offered a variety of intellectual and entertain
ing programming. Some of the activities offered
include trips to the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art, Monterey Bay Aquarium, San
Francisco AIDS Walk and Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, as well as scavenger hunts,
dances and dorm-wide clubs.
Having received extensive training prior to the
students' arrival June 24, the program mentors
assist the high-school residents in adjusting to
dorm life and a college-level work schedule.
"Dorm life is very different from anything I've
ever experienced," Robertoni said. "I've had to
learn to keep my priorities straight and not lose
sight of school work with all the fun going on
around me. You can only stay up until 4:00 a.m. so
many nights in a row."

the academic aspects can sometimes
be daunting for the students. History
Professor Gordon Chang, currently
teaching a course on the history of
U.S.-China relations that has a
majority of high-school students,
recognizes the difficulty faced by
them.
"I think it's a challenge that high
school students are getting exposed
to this type of workload," Chang
said. "These students come from a
variety of academic backgrounds —
some are more familiar with the dis
cipline of college-level work and find
it motivating, others might find the
experience intimidating."
For her writing and rhetoric
course, Robertoni finds she is spend
ing a considerable amount of time
doing independent research in the
Media Microtext Center at Green
Library.
"This is researching on a level
inconceivable to a high-school stu

dent," she said.
Scher agrees that the workload is
different.
"I don't feel overwhelmed — just
submerged in work that I am happy
to be doing," he said. "As for class
discussions, they're at an entirely dif
ferent level from my high-school
classes. The difference comes more
in the residential education. I have
conversations that I could not have
with most people in my high school.
I'm surrounded by people of maturi
ty, intellect and passion."
The High School Summer
College Program is now in its fifth
week of eight. Experiencing their
first college midterms, and soon,
finals, the high-school students said
they still greatly enjoy the program,
and continue remembering the bene
fits of having a Stanford transcript, as
well as an early college social experi
ence
"I think I'm really lucky to be
part of the staff in this program,"
Bell said. "I can't wait to see where
these students end up at the end of
the eight weeks, and I'm curious to
see where they end up going to col

home, but for many, home is as far away as
Europe, Asia or Africa. This year, international
students comprise about 10 percent of the pro
gram.
Just as far-reaching, though, are the incentives
for attaining early credit from Stanford as colleges
become increasingly selective. The program offers
open enrollment to many undergraduate-level
classes offered during the summer, as well as an
SAT preparation course and a college selection
and application course.
Briana Robertoni, a rising college freshman
from Massachusetts, said she chose the Stanford
High School Summer College because she "want
ed to be associated with an institution that holds
such a respectable position in the academic com
munity."

"Also, I love to learn, and what better place to
do it than Stanford?" Robertoni added. "I knew I
would be challenged and inspired here."
Thorn Scher, a rising high-school senior from
Murrieta, Calif., intends to apply to Stanford this
fall.
"After this summer, 1 want to apply more than
I had when 1 first came," Scher said. "I'm halfway
through my time here and 1 simply love it."
A trained staff of Stanford undergraduates
serves as residence counselors and mentors at
Lagunita Court. The residential staff strives to
make each house a warm and inviting home for
the students who live there, and to help students
take advantage of all that Stanford and the Bay
Area have to offer.
"Summer College is not a camp," Nishikawa
said. "We treat students as emerging scholars. We
strive to give participants a well rounded residen
tial education experience comparable to what
incoming frosh might encounter."
Madison Bell, a rising Stanford junior and
mentor for the High School Summer College pro
gram, greatly enjoys her involvement as a coun
selor and Stanford representative.
"[The program] allows students the freedom to
explore their academic interests, while still leaving
time for them to form bonds with each other,
become involved in the community and get a feel
for what life at Stanford is really about," Bell said.
Other than classes, the high-school students
are offered a variety of intellectual and entertain
ing programming. Some of the activities offered
include trips to the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art, Monterey Bay Aquarium, San
Francisco AIDS Walk and Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, as well as scavenger hunts,
dances and dorm-wide clubs.
Having received extensive training prior to the
students' arrival June 24, the program mentors
assist the high-school residents in adjusting to
dorm life and a college-level work schedule.
"Dorm life is very different from anything I've
ever experienced," Robertoni said. "I've had to
learn to keep my priorities straight and not lose
sight of school work with all the fun going on
around me. You can only stay up until 4:00 a.m. so
many nights in a row."
Experiencing the social aspects of college life,

the academic aspects can sometimes
be daunting for the students. History
Professor Gordon Chang, currently
teaching a course on the history of
U.S.-China relations that has a
majority of high-school students,
recognizes the difficulty faced by
them.
"I think it's a challenge that high
school students are getting exposed
to this type of workload," Chang
said. "These students come from a
variety of academic backgrounds —
some are more familiar with the dis
cipline of college-level work and find
it motivating, others might find the
experience intimidating."
For her writing and rhetoric
course, Robertoni finds she is spend
ing a considerable amount of time
doing independent research in the
Media Microtext Center at Green
Library.
"This is researching on a level
inconceivable to a high-school stu

dent," she said.
Scher agrees that the workload is
different.
"I don't feel overwhelmed — just
submerged in work that I am happy
to be doing," he said. "As for class
discussions, they're at an entirely dif
ferent level from my high-school
classes. The difference comes more
in the residential education. I have
conversations that I could not have
with most people in my high school.
I'm surrounded by people of maturi
ty, intellect and passion."
The High School Summer
College Program is now in its fifth
week of eight. Experiencing their
first college midterms, and soon,
finals, the high-school students said
they still greatly enjoy the program,
and continue remembering the bene
fits of having a Stanford transcript, as
well as an early college social experi
ence
"I think I'm really lucky to be
part of the staff in this program,"
Bell said. "I can't wait to see where
these students end up at the end of
the eight weeks, and I'm curious to
see where they end up going to col
lege and what they decide to do with
their lives."
