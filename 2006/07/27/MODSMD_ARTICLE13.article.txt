## Sketch Welcome to Camp The 						Asylum, a.k.a. Princeton 
### 
As hinted at last week, 1 am
spending the summer travel
ing the world in search of
physics. While 1 understand that
your immediate reaction will be to
fling down your paper in envious
rage at my jet-set lifestyle, I urge
you to read on, for the apparent
playboy antics of the physics grad
student are but an illusion overlay
ing a tangled web of deceit, jealousy
and rage.
Okay, I was kinda making stuff
up in the last paragraph. Forgive
me. I've had a stressful week. But,
I'll get back to that in a sec. First,
though, a little background on my
travels.
I'm a liar. For several months,
I've been telling people I was spend
ing July and August at various
physics conferences. Not true.
Actually I'm spending my time at
summer school. Or as my terribly
unfair humanist friends have been
calling it: "Computer Camp" (of
course, it should be "physics", but
apparently "computer" is more
insulting).
Going away to camp seems to be
a quintessential part of the
American childhood experience.
You get packed up with all your
stuff and sent off to the woods for
two weeks of wilderness training
and child abuse.
Ok, so "abuse" may be a little
strong, but let's face it, sitting
around a campfire in the dark
engaging in ridiculous bonding
activities is, at the least, very fucking
weird.
Now, since I've always wanted to
experience as much of the American
Dream as possible, I've decided that
I shall be marketing this summer's
adventures as my own personal ver
sion of band camp—just need to
find a willing flautist-
There are two different destina
tions on my summer tour of physics;
the first is Princeton. Interesting
place. Well, in reality, it's a very bor
ing place, but that's a small detail
and they have great ice cream.
In fact, the school is not actually
at Princeton, it's at the Institute for
Advanced Study which, for those of
you who don't know, is like an asy
lum for the criminally insane
(except with academics).
The lAS (as it's known in the
trade) has a great deal in common
with the back country (not least of
which is fact that it's in the middle of
fucking nowhere) and the PiTP
(Prospects in Theoretical Physics)
school is a lot like camp (though,
you do need to block out the math
for the analogy to hold, but that's
generally a good idea for other rea
sons).
First off, we have camp coun
selors. Well, sort of. The staff at the
Institute (god, it even sounds like an

asylum) are very good at playing
surrogate parents. Our daily rou
tines are scripted out and there arc
complicated rules that are repeated
in the patient manner of an elemen
tary school teacher.
Lunch tickets are color-coded
and a network of signs ensures we
don't get lost on the 60 foot walk
from one building to another.
Although this over-bearing concern
for our welfare clearly belies any
notion that we are capable of look
ing after ourselves, it's probably fair
enough.
Then there's the social awkward
ness. No, awkwardness isn't quite
right. It's more social jerkiness.
Interactions are laced with image
worries: Does this person like me?
Am I fitting in? Oh no, everyone
knows more algebraic geometry
than me!
All the aforementioned niggling
little doubts are multiplied many
times over when in the presence of
the school's lecturers, who I guess
are like the cool grown ups who
seem 10 feet tall when you're kid
and can do everything. Ok, I realize
I'm stretching the analogy a bit here,
but run with me.
They're comfortable with each
other and with us (mostly). And we
want to be them. Sort of. More
importantly, there's a little intimida
tion to go with the inspiration.
I have mentioned this particular
quality of faculty in previous
columns, but the effect is even more
pronounced during camp, since
there's no time for the glow of
celebrity to fade.
Of course celebrity works in a
two ways. Not only are you in awe,
but when the objects of your admi
ration break a little from the mold,
all sorts of stories can be generated.
Take the whip guy. When an aca
demic legend (by which I mean,
amongst other string theorists) inte
grates onstage whip cracking into
his lectures, you've got a great tale
to tell your friends (by which I
mean, fellow physics grad students).
And when he brings the whip to
your party, well you can dine out on
that sort thing for years (especially
with the right photographs).
Speaking of parties, we did our
campfire sing-a-long equivalent last
Friday. Admittedly, rather than
smores and out of tune singing, we
had cheap (and I mean really cheap)
red wine and a whip.

(Incidentally, I would like to pass
on some valuable advice in life:
Never, ever, ever get totally wasted
in the presence of a professor. And
if you must, try not to babble inco
herently for several hours. And if

you must do that, try and remember
what you say. Otherwise the morn
ing after is kind of troubling.)
I must confess that I've never
really understood the point of sum
mer camp. Presumably, it's sup
posed to make you into a better per
son or something, but, quite frankly,
the whole idea of communal fun
makes me feel a little uneasy (for a
start, I bet this is how Koresh and
Jones lured in the punters).
Computer (Physics) Camp, how

ever, is a little different. It's not real
ly supposed to be fun. And while I
guess that I should be glad I'm hav
ing a great time, it's a little troubling
that watching equations being writ
ten on blackboards now counts as a
holiday in my book.

ing a tangled web of deceit, jealousy
and rage.
Okay, I was kinda making stuff
up in the last paragraph. Forgive
me. I've had a stressful week. But,
I'll get back to that in a sec. First,
though, a little background on my
travels.
I'm a liar. For several months,
I've been telling people I was spend
ing July and August at various
physics conferences. Not true.
Actually I'm spending my time at
summer school. Or as my terribly
unfair humanist friends have been
calling it: "Computer Camp" (of
course, it should be "physics", but
apparently "computer" is more
insulting).
Going away to camp seems to be
a quintessential part of the
American childhood experience.
You get packed up with all your
stuff and sent off to the woods for
two weeks of wilderness training
and child abuse.
Ok, so "abuse" may be a little
strong, but let's face it, sitting
around a campfire in the dark
engaging in ridiculous bonding
activities is, at the least, very fucking
weird.
Now, since I've always wanted to
experience as much of the American
Dream as possible, I've decided that
I shall be marketing this summer's
adventures as my own personal ver
sion of band camp—just need to
find a willing flautist-
There are two different destina
tions on my summer tour of physics;
the first is Princeton. Interesting
place. Well, in reality, it's a very bor
ing place, but that's a small detail
and they have great ice cream.
In fact, the school is not actually
at Princeton, it's at the Institute for
Advanced Study which, for those of
you who don't know, is like an asy
lum for the criminally insane
(except with academics).
The lAS (as it's known in the
trade) has a great deal in common
with the back country (not least of
which is fact that it's in the middle of
fucking nowhere) and the PiTP
(Prospects in Theoretical Physics)
school is a lot like camp (though,
you do need to block out the math
for the analogy to hold, but that's
generally a good idea for other rea
sons).
First off, we have camp coun
selors. Well, sort of. The staff at the
Institute (god, it even sounds like an

asylum) are very good at playing
surrogate parents. Our daily rou
tines are scripted out and there arc
complicated rules that are repeated
in the patient manner of an elemen
tary school teacher.
Lunch tickets are color-coded
and a network of signs ensures we
don't get lost on the 60 foot walk
from one building to another.
Although this over-bearing concern
for our welfare clearly belies any
notion that we are capable of look
ing after ourselves, it's probably fair
enough.
Then there's the social awkward
ness. No, awkwardness isn't quite
right. It's more social jerkiness.
Interactions are laced with image
worries: Does this person like me?
Am I fitting in? Oh no, everyone
knows more algebraic geometry
than me!
All the aforementioned niggling
little doubts are multiplied many
times over when in the presence of
the school's lecturers, who I guess
are like the cool grown ups who
seem 10 feet tall when you're kid
and can do everything. Ok, I realize
I'm stretching the analogy a bit here,
but run with me.
They're comfortable with each
other and with us (mostly). And we
want to be them. Sort of. More
importantly, there's a little intimida
tion to go with the inspiration.
I have mentioned this particular
quality of faculty in previous
columns, but the effect is even more
pronounced during camp, since
there's no time for the glow of
celebrity to fade.
Of course celebrity works in a
two ways. Not only are you in awe,
but when the objects of your admi
ration break a little from the mold,
all sorts of stories can be generated.
Take the whip guy. When an aca
demic legend (by which I mean,
amongst other string theorists) inte
grates onstage whip cracking into
his lectures, you've got a great tale
to tell your friends (by which I
mean, fellow physics grad students).
And when he brings the whip to
your party, well you can dine out on
that sort thing for years (especially
with the right photographs).
Speaking of parties, we did our
campfire sing-a-long equivalent last
Friday. Admittedly, rather than
smores and out of tune singing, we
had cheap (and I mean really cheap)
red wine and a whip.

(Incidentally, I would like to pass
on some valuable advice in life:
Never, ever, ever get totally wasted
in the presence of a professor. And
if you must, try not to babble inco
herently for several hours. And if

you must do that, try and remember
what you say. Otherwise the morn
ing after is kind of troubling.)
I must confess that I've never
really understood the point of sum
mer camp. Presumably, it's sup
posed to make you into a better per
son or something, but, quite frankly,
the whole idea of communal fun
makes me feel a little uneasy (for a
start, I bet this is how Koresh and
Jones lured in the punters).
Computer (Physics) Camp, how

ever, is a little different. It's not real
ly supposed to be fun. And while I
guess that I should be glad I'm hav
ing a great time, it's a little troubling
that watching equations being writ
ten on blackboards now counts as a
holiday in my book.

Any interested whippers or flautists
ivho will be in the vicinity of the.
Swiss/French border in August should
email navins@ Stanford,edu.
