# HOW TO SURVIVE A HEAT WAVE IN STYLE
## Feeling Hot, Hot, Hot 
### JOHN SHEN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Stanford, I hear, is experiencing
some sort of heat wave. Having
spent a summer on campus two
years ago, 1 can definitely relate. And
these last few days haven't been too
good for me either. Last Thursday, it
was about 37 degrees Celsius (98°°
Fahrenheit) here, which was the
hottest temperature seen in
Berlin...ever. I only realized this when
the Berlin Tagespiegel newspaper
remarked sarcastically the next day,
"If you actually want more heat, you
could head to the Gobi Desert, one of
the few places on Earth hotter than
Berlin yesterday."
Berlin generally has shitty weath
er. I was also here during "the coldest
winter since 1943." Which, in histori
cal retrospect, was probably a bad
winter for the Germans to decide to
invade Russia; not that there's ever a
good winter to invade Russia, nor
really a good winter to do anything in
Russia. And although Stanford's
summers may be unbearably dry and
hot, at least the winters, though rainy
and miserable, are nothing like the -
20 degrees Celsius (3°° Fahrenheit)
and the two feet of snow that we had
over here in Central Europe. So real
ly, it could be worse. But then again,
Germany makes up for any weather
inadequacies by serving one liter
(read quarter-gallon) "cups" of beer,
so it all works out in the end.
But of course, how do you deal
with the non-ending 90 degree days?
Having done extensive research here
in Europe, 1 have discovered an

amazing, eye-opening solution, what
anyone and everyone should do when
it's "gettin' hot in here".
No really... I mean it.
Having seen this in the country
where the phrase "nude beach" is
completely repetitive, it's surprising
how much just a little bit of clothing
removal can completely change your
life. Take the following examples:
Stuck all day at a research job in
Gates? Go skinny dipping (er...skin
ny splashing) in the fountain. I mean
come on, it's just asking for it.
Bored at night now that you don't
have homework to do? Don't have
any friends on campus anymore? A
slow, deliberate stroll through the
lounge aux naturelle would really
help you to get to know the rest of
SRC!
Stuck in a stuffy Manz one room
double? A couple of visits by Captain
Winky should help to remind your
roommate that he's got good friends
in Mirrielees that he can move in
with.
Need to impress the cute girl
across the hall? Well, um, you should
probably do that one with your
clothes on. (But then again, you
never know, she might be into that
kind of thing...)
Of course, after a while, excessive
public nudity becomes just like legal
prostitution or the kinky group sex
club a block from my apartment —
the more there is of it, the less and
less you really care. Not that I ever
said it was ever not totally, complete
ly, and ridiculously hilarious/awe
some that there's a kinky sex club a
block from my house or anything.

But you learn not to notice such
things too much. It's like not having a
drinking age or speed limits on the
Autobahn. Something that makes
you realize just how absurd and
restricting it is to not be able to drink
until you're twice the age when you'd
like to start drinking, to have to keep
your speed pegged at about half of
what you'd like to drive and to have
to wear all those clothes all the time
(sheesh what's that about?). It's these
unperceived restrictions, that once
removed from life (I'm speaking
more about the drinking and the
speed limits), make you realize just
how different, how really free your
life can suddenly seem. (Feel that
fresh breeze 'tween your legs? That's
what we really call the winds of free
dom)
Okay, you'll still get in trouble for
the same kind of drunk antics in both
countries, and if you speed on the
many sections of the Autobahn
WITH speed limits (somewhere
between 60 and 75 mph), you can
expect a hefty fine in the mail thanks
to speed cameras. But regardless,
sometimes it helps to get away from
those things, those cultural taboos
that you assumed to be universal,
because there really is a bigger world
of drinking, speeding and streaking
out there.
Now about the heat...

John Shen swears thai he isn't getting
paid by the German Tourism Board
and. no, he hasn't gone skinny dipping
yet. Give him crap for being all taUt at
shenO 7 @stanford. edu.
