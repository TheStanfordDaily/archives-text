						Setback in Somalia Drawing parallels between African nation and Afghanistan as Islamic courts expand 
### 
Jinja, Uganda (July 17) — Save for the occasional story about marauding
pirates off its coast, Somalia has largely been off of the radar of the
international community since the disastrous U.S. mission in 1993 that left
18 U.S. soldiers and a much greater number of Somalis dead.

Now, however, the country is reemerging in
headlines with June's violent takeover of
Mogadishu by the Union of Islamic Courts
(UIC) which expelled the warlords who used
to control the city by militia rule. The strict
Wahabi Islam practiced by the courts, the
long status of Somalia as a failed state and
the intense competition by regional actors
Ethiopia and Eritrea for influence in the
country all present strong similarities to the
rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Both countries are among the least stable
in the world. The Failed States Index, an
annual rating system compiled by The Fund
for Peace and Foreign Policy Magazine,
ranked Somalia and Afghanistan within the
10 worst countries in 2005 and 2006 reports.
As in Afghanistan, the rise of a religious
force seems to have taken nearly everyone
by surprise. As East African Standard corre
spondent Abdulkadir Khalif wrote on July 3,
"No one in his or her right mind even a year
ago could have imagined that powerful mili
tia leaders like the skillful political manipu
lator Mohamed Qanyare Afrah and the
feared Muse Sadi Yalahow would be
reduced to fugitives by a bunch of clergy
men." Perhaps the most shocked were the
warlords themselves, and the U.S. State
Department, if allegations that the warlords
were U.S. backed are true.
As in Afghanistan, the appeal for Islamic

The UIC, led by Sheikh Hassan Dahir
Aweys, has pledged that it will not imitate
the rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan —a
good plan since the Taliban was known to
keep its central treasury in a wooden strong
box under Mullah Omar's bed—and even
offered to cooperate with the U.S. The estab
lishment of law and order is a major
improvement, and the BBC reports that food
costs have decreased as there are no longer
militia check-points demanding money. But
even as Mogadishu becomes safer for aver
age Somalis under the UIC, regional tensions
are escalating as the group attempts to con
solidate control of the whole country.
Somalia is playing the arena to regional
tension between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
Ethiopia supports the Baidoa-based Somali
transitional government — which was estab
lished in 2004 as a result of African Union
sponsored talks —while Eritrea has been
accused of arming the UIC. Peace talks
between the transitional government and
the UIC collapsed in June as the UIC
expanded its military activities. On
Friday, Reuters reported that Ethiopia
had sent troops to the city of Baidoa
in anticipation of a possible UIC
attack.

rule grew out of frustration with the anarchy
caused by years of rule by armed militias
directed by warlords. In both countries mili
tiamen could rape, extort and kill with
impunity. The UIC was created though an
alliance of 11 Islamic courts in Mogadishu
that emerged as representatives of the rule
of law in the years of chaos since the 1991
collapse of the central government. The
courts, operating according to Islamic law,
were initially sponsored by businessmen
who agreed that the state of mayhem under
militias was bad for business. The Taliban,
led by a mysterious man known as Mullah
Omar, began as a network of religious lead
ers spurred into action by the immoral and
arbitrary rule of Afghanistan's warlords.

will follow Afghanistan's road to repressive
Islamic rule and large-scale war. Khalif
writes that Somalis "have by-and-large wel
comed the Islamic victory not so much on
religious as on public order grounds." The
Taliban was also widely appreciated as a
respite from years of warlords, but quickly
grew extreme and tyrannical. Even if the
UIC is as dissimilar as it claims, the uncanny
parallels mean that lessons from
Afghanistan should be carefully examined
by international actors in Somalia. The
recent resurgence of violence by Taliban
supporters shows that Afghanistan is still
unstable five years after the American inva
sion. Somalia cannot afford to suffer from
similar mistakes.
Philosopher Georg W. F. Hegel wrote,
"We learn from history that man can never
learn anything from history." Those who
wish for peace and stability in Somalia and
the Horn of Africa must desperately hope he
was wrong. ■
