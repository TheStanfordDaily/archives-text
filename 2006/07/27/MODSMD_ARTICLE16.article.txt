## TOURNAMENT NEWS Pros hit, serve on campus The 						Bank of the West Classic brings the world's best to Taube 
### JENNA COALSON SPORTS EDITOR 
Stanford's beautiful Taube Family Tennis
Stadium is no stranger to tennis greatness.
Consistently one of the strongest tennis pro
grams in the nation, many of Stanford's tennis
players have left the Farm and joined the pro
fessionals —but this week, the pros are com
ing to Stanford for the 36th annual Bank of
the West Classic.
The tournament marks the first women's
event of the U.S. Open Series, the ten sum
mer tournaments leading up to the US Open,
which will be played this September in New
York City. Players' successes in the US Open
Series tournaments earn them points in a
competition for bonus prize money. If the
player with the highest number of points from
the Series goes on to win the U.S. Open, he or
she stands to win an extra $1 million.
More than 40 female professionals from
around the world have come to Stanford for
the tournament, which began on Monday.
World ranked #2 Kim Clijsters, who netted a
hefty $2.2 million in the U.S. Open finals last
year thanks to winning the Series, has
returned as the defending champion. Other
top 25 players competing in the Classic
include Patty Schnyder, Nicole Vaidisova,
Anna-Lena Groenefeld, Daniela
Hantuchova, Ai Sugiyama, and Katarina
Srebotnik. The tournament has also brought
back several more familiar faces. Seniors

Theresa Logar and Anne Yelsey and junior
Whitney Deason played in the qualifying
tournament last weekend but did not earn any
of the four coveted qualifying spots into the
main draw. Amber Liu, who graduated this
past June, and Lilia Osterloh ('00), both for
mer NCAA singles champions, competed in
the main singles draw, but were defeated in
the first round. Osterloh also played in the
main doubles draw.
Liu certainly had the home-crowd support
in her Monday night match and opened
strongly against Shahar Peer of Israel, taking
the first set 6-4. The seventh-seeded Peer
quickly stole the momentum during the sec
ond set and became almost unstoppable,

making some nearly impossible saves and
pounding winner after winner with a resolute
precision. Despite Liu's best efforts, Peer
took the final 12 games of the match to win 4-
6, 6-1, 6-0. Osterloh lost a hard-fought match
to #27 Jelena Jankovic with the final score 7-
5,6-3. Jankovic will go on to face Clijsters, the
first seed, in the second round.
The most surprising upset of the tourna
ment thus far was qualifier Shenay Perry's
first round defeat of fifth seed Daniela
Hantuchova. Despite getting crushed 6-0 in
the second set, Perry rallied to win the third
set 6-3. The final score was 6-2, 0-6, 6-3.
The excitement of the tournament is not
merely relegated to the matches, however.
The introduction of Hawk Eye electronic
line-calling technology, which debuted in
March, allows players, audience and referees
alike to visualize a questionable call instanta
neously on a large on-court screen. Players
are given a budget of two incorrect requests
per set, limiting the number of times they can
demand a review.
Off-court, spectators can find a wide-vari
ety of businesses sporting their wares, infor
mation, and often free gifts under tents lining
the side of the stadium next to the track. In
the FILA tent, for example, visitors can have
their feet measured for FILA's new line of
customized shoes. FILA is also co-sponsoring
a fashion show with NEXXUS, to be held at
6:00 p.m. this Friday before one of the quar
terfinal matches. VIP tickets for FASHION!
cost $125, and include special seating at the
fashion show, seats in Terrace 1 at the quar
terfinal, a special gift bag and a raffle entry.
All proceeds are being donated to the non
profit organization Wardrobe for
Opportunity, which provides career support
to low-income jobseekers in the Bay Area.
The Bank of the West Classic continues
until the final match on Sunday at noon.
Tickets for each session are still available
online at www.bankofthewestclassic.com/
ticketinfo.html or by calling (866)WTA
TIXS.
