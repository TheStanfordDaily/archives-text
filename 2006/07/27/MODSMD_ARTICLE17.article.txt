## ESPN: Is IT 'GOING MTV'? 
### JAKE KELMAN SPORTS COLUMNIST 
Don't get me wrong — I love ESPN as
much as the next guy. At least I used to. That
was before everybody's favorite four-letter
network got lazy. Call it "going MTV." All
anybody wanted was music videos, but those
damned executives turned the network into a
nightmarish hellhole of reality TV. Now ESPN
is perilously close to doing the same, making
pure highlights a thing of the past. Sure,
there's ESPNEWS, but really, like MTV2, it
just doesn't cut it. Here's a glance at what's
wrong with the station with a monopoly on the
sports world.
I have no problem with the general conceit
of the daytime programming. Opinionated
columnists debating current sports issues
seemed like a fine idea. The problem is the
execution. Let's begin with "Cold Pizza's First
and Ten," in which nitwitted buffoon Woody
Paige and reactionary conspiracy theorist Skip
Bayless thoughtlessly attack one another with
staggeringly little concentration on the sports
issue at hand. Why on earth would we enjoy
watching two unpleasant men behave like
fourth graders?
While I recognize that ESPN doesn't have
many options for 12:30 to 2:00 —nothing is hap
pening, you already know what happened yes
terday —I somehow long for more, for better,
for anything but another episode of "NFL
LIVE". For God's sake, we already have the
NFL Network, and it is not your job to report
every single day how Tom Brady or Peyton
Manning slept last night. 1 am pathologically
obsessed with the NFL, and this show is still
relentless. During the season there's one game
a week. Airing NFL Live twice weekly might be
okay then. But 1 could swear its July and that
Sean Salisbury has been screaming at me daily
for the past two months. I've absorbed little.
The mid-afternoon shows are significantly
better, but not perfect. "Around the Horn,"
the game-show featuring sportswriters (fre
quently including Ozzie Guillen's favorite
journalist, Jay Mariotti) is an entertaining half
hour, but it really rewards stupidity. Host
Tony Reali, while somewhat charming, seems
to care little if the respondents think through
answers, giving points simply for inside jokes
or hackneyed, cliche responses. Panelists are
punished for thinking outside the box. Of
course, after "Around the Horn" follows
ESPN's finest program, "Pardon the
Interruption." 1 have no problem with this
show, though it would be nice if Wilbon and
Kornheiser worked more than once or twice a
month. Just a thought. When Dan Leßatard
debates Jason Whitlock, the show is impossi
ble to watch.
Evening programming changes daily, but
problems abound under any circumstance. I
could rant for longer than would be healthy
about the baseball telecasts (almost exclusive
ly Yankees and Red Sox games) or the pre-
