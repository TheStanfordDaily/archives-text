Mv friends and I were rowing slowly
down a narrow river into a dark forest, sur
rounded by murky water, beset by pesky
insects, and ducking under overhanging
branches, when we faced a truly British
dilemma.
We didn't have a corkscrew.
Suddenly, the horror of what lay ahead
of us paled in comparison to the piece of
hardware we had left behind. We were
partaking in an activity that the English
call 'punting' while studying abroad in
Oxford last quarter. Though it sounds like
something better suited for an undersized
football player or a frat boy who has had
too much to drink, the kind of punting that
we were doing involves guiding yourself
along a shallow river, using a long metal
pole to push off the bottom.
It is a textbook British leisure activity.
You lean back, consume alcoholic bever
ages and soak up the sun while floating
down a river at a snail's pace, ideally wear
ing deck shoes and scarves.
But we were not relaxed. Instead, we
were desperately trying to use any means
possible to get our bottle open. We asked
every boat that we passed if they were car
rying one, and received merely a continu
ous stream of grimaces and lines like "No,
I'm afraid not."
Finally, desperate for the sacred con
tents of our bottle — we needed to relax!
— we decided to try and smash the neck
open against a concrete wall along the
river's edge. We hit the bottle against the
edge of the wall, delicately at first, gradu
ally with more and more force, sending
shards of cement flying. Eventually, we
wedged it in a crevice, and 1 stepped on it
as hard as I could, using all the pent-up
frustration that from not being able to
open it in the first place.
Predictably, the bottle exploded, send
ing wine and glass fragments into the bot
tom of the boat.
That was one of the many times I real
ized that relaxing in England is hard work.
It is a time-honored skill, honed and
refined over the generations. Pushing a
boat down a river with a long stick is only
calming once you know how to do it. In
the hands of an inexperienced punter, the
experience can be a disaster; running into
other boats and getting caught under over
hanging branches are commonplace.
On the surface, you couldn't ask for a
more calm, polite, thoughtful people. This
is tme of most British. But as often as not,
under those bemused, seemingly untrou
bled expressions lies a twitching bundle of
nerves.
Sometimes, you get the impression that
their codes of behavior are more impor
tant than the situations they're designed to
prevent. An audience member's cell
phone started to ring in the middle of a
play that we went to around the beginning
of the term, and it seemed like everyone in
the audience turned around to shush this
person and mutter things about the inde
cency of leaving your cell phone on. Their
attempts to silence the cell
phone, of course, drowned out
the actors.
I think it has something to do
with the queen. The society dei
fies a few royals who are nothing
if not polite. Is that a problem? I
don't think so. I enjoyed the
British charm, as well as the fact
that they value their leisure time
so much, they go to great lengths
to make sure that it everyone
minds their manners and stays
cool.
I found that, as a California
kid, I could relate to their need
for relaxation. There is a lot of
common ground between
Californians and the British on
that front. We, too. have a leader
who is allowed to occupy his
position for reasons that have
nothing to do with politics (in
Arnold's case, his ability to sum
up big issues in simple, declara
tive sentences like "To those crit
ics who are so pessimistic about
our economy, 1 say, Don't be
economic girlie men!")
Ninety-nine percent of the
time, surfing is just as monoto
nous punting, except without the

alcohol. And I'm not just saying
that because people would sing
the opening music to the OC to
us, not knowing where in
America we were from but hop
ing that it would be California.
(As a strange-but-true side
point, one of the colleges in
Oxford actually had a surf team
that, as far as I could figure out,
would go to the coast and talk
about what it would be like if
they had waves.)
We do, however, value relax
ation for different reasons.
English cities drip with history.
Why don't you do something
that will last for 3,(XX) years? they
seem to be saying. Under that
kind of pressure, who wouldn't
give up and go for a punt
instead?
In California, on the other
hand, there is little that has last
ed for longer than 50 years. The
attitude here? There will always
be time to make your mark. And
besides, soon enough, someone
with more money than you will
buy your property, tear it down
and build something better.
Maybe you don't agree with
me. Maybe you think that
England and California are not
all that similar. But I think we
want to be, and that's got to
count for something.
