I'm from Washington. No, not the corrupt
one run by rich, white guys. I'm from the
green Washington, run by hippies and nerds.
One of my favorite things about my home
state is the fact that even on the hottest days
of summer, the temperature stays below the
million and a half degree mark that Stanford
seems to be suffering from at the moment.
The heat of the last few days has made this
fact blazingly clear to me and, as much as I
love Stanford, it is hotter than Jessica Alba
doing Jazzercise.
As a native Gig Harborite — if you can find it
on the map I will personally give you a cookie
— from the Pacific Northwest, I assumed in

my small town ignorance that by this point in
history we would have mastery over the
weather. If we can split the atom and level
entire cities, why shouldn't we be able to have
our own personal snow cloud on hot days like
today? Please, for all the scientists out there,
drop whatever it is you're doing and fix this
most egregious of problems. And if any of you
come up with a "Bio-dome"-esque solution to
the blistering sun rays, make sure that you

don't include Polly Shore in your calculations.
Because that would only make matters worse.
This sudden heat wave has made me realize
three things. First of all, 1 hate Polly Shore.
Secondly, global warming has not done its
part in breaking off enough glaciers. I want to
see massive ice cubes floating off the coast line
that's only three feet from my front door.
Finally, farmer's tans are nigh-unavoidable
when you have to work outside and you're
naturally paler than a ghost. The heat has
become a threat to all land dwelling creatures
and if we don't strike soon, the sun is going to
destroy the American way of life.
So stay cool people. Until A 1 Gore solves
this global warming problem with his bare
hands, you're going to be sweating from
places you didn't know could sweat.
