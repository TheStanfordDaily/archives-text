## Inspiration from Muse's new album

Talk about a tough act to follow. When Muse released its 2004
magnum opus "Absolution", the band exploded onto the internation
al scene in a way that nobody could have ever imagined. After an
exceptionally successful international tour, a plethora of awards and a

long stay at the number one position on both
the American and European music charts,
Muse went back into the studio to record a
follow up to what has been critically
acclaimed as the best album of 2004-2005 and
one of the best albums in the last decade.
Yeah, definitely a tough act to follow.
With the release of their fourth album,
"Black Holes and Revelations", Muse has
proven that "Absolution" was no fluke.
Furthermore, they make it clear that their
sound will continue to elude a corporate
stamp, growing and flourishing under their
own direction.
"Black Holes" kicks off in a familiar Muse
fashion in the form of the biting and emo
tionally vocalized social commentary "Take
a Bow." Front man Matthew Bellamy's
haunting vocals are better than ever as he
condemns world leaders of their corruption
and crimes singing, "Death, you bring death
and destruction to all that you touch".
However, the dark themes and minor
chord progressions quickly fade away as
Muse unleashes its happiest sounding album
to date. The second track, "Starlight" is a
direct throwback to the Prince inspired years
of the 80's and 90's with major-infused key
board leads and falsetto chorus lines. It devi
ates greatly from the sound Muse had
defined for itself in its past three incarna
tions, yet still manages to sound distinct and
unique in a way only Muse can.

The album's first single "Supermassive Black Hole", a beautifully
orchestrated grungy rocker, showcases some of the band's evolution
since "Absolution." While maintaining its new age computer rock
effects and sounds, the overlaid vocals are reminiscent more of
Queen's intricate ballads than Radiohead's monotone dirges, bringing
Bellamy's unique vocal work ever more to the forefront.
Muse's customary sentimental love song is here in full force, show
casing the happier sound of the album in the form of "Invincible"
which, despite its sappy message, manages to formulate a moving
power ballad come its final minutes. Muse's older sound is still very

apparent in songs like "Assassin" and "Exo-politics" which, while not
bringing anything terribly new to the table, are fresh renditions of
what made Muse an international mega-hit in the first place and defi
nitely satisfy.
Towards the end of the album, "City of Delusion" stands out as a
crisp and powerful version of their new sound. Featuring new ele
ments from acoustic guitars, to symphonic strings to soloing horns and

plentiful vocal har
monies, the group
shows off how it can
effortlessly combine
so many diverse
sounds into a pol
ished and authorita
tive single. The
result is a deep and
intricate progressive
masterpiece that
takes you for a hell
of a ride from calm
start to glorious fin
ish. If this is the
future of Muse, con
sider me already in
line for their next
album.
The band closes
the album just as
strongly as it begins,
with another pro
gressive epic enti
tled "Knights of
Cydonia". From
introductory horse
hoofs to the head
banging conclusion,
"Knights" expands
and reworks the new

toys shown off in
"City using many of the same instrumentation but with a complete
ly different result, further displaying this trio's exceptional talent and
songwriting ability.
Many may consider this a transition album but I wouldn't place
that title on it quite yet, at least not until we see their next offering.
The album is noticeably disjointed in places and lacks the unifying
flow that made "Absolution truly revolutionary, but it carries all of
the qualities to make it a very successful stand-alone album.
It would have been impossible for Muse to escape the expectations
