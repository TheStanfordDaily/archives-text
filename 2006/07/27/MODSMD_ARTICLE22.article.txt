# SAN DIEGO COMIC CON
## Worst. Convention. Ever. 
### 
LISA KERNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMIC CON-ARTIST

1 knew I was in for a real trip when, weeks before
1 even set foot in the San Diego Convention Center,
my cousin — a self-proclaimed geek and Comic-Con
devotee — spent half an hour describing how I
should plan my day-long excursion — everything
from what shoes to wear to the crowd to expect
(over one hundred thousand) to exactly what size
water bottle to

bring.
For me,
someone entire
ly unfamiliar
with the world
of comics, my
venture to
Comic-Con had
one specific pur
pose: to attend
the Veronica
Mars panel and
autograph sign
ing with the cre
ator and cast.
Driving two
hours from L.A.
down to San
Diego seemed
like a reason
able journey to
personally

encounter those responsible for my absolute favorite
television show. However, my cousin's advice did
nothing to prepare me.
The day had an unfortunate start when, at 7:30
a.m., it took nearly an hour and a half to travel one
tenth of a mile into the parking garage. It wasn't easy
to let this slide when, once inside, a staffer tried to con
vince me that by asking for Room 20,1 actually meant
Hall H (rooms which 1 soon discovered were a floor
apart and at complete opposite ends of the convention
center). It then took four tries until I actually found
someone on staff who had even heard of Veronica
Mars.
Once I did, I was immediately disheartened to
hear that because the panel and autograph signing
were to take place back-to-back in separate loca

lions, I needed to make the unbearable choice
between waiting hours inside the auditorium to guar
antee a decent seat for the Q&A session, and waiting
hours in line to ensure that I would score an auto
graph. I figured that the interaction between the
audience and the cast during the panel would prove
more entertaining, so I waited in Room 20 for three
hours, sitting through a painful Stargate: Atlantis
interview and impossibly boring TV Guide panel just
so I could slowly make my way near the front of the

auditorium.
While the
Veronica Mars
panel itself was
rather exciting
due to the enthu
siastic crowd and
the fleeting thrill
of enjoying the
creator's and
actors' presence,
it was ultimately
unenlightening
and disappointing
(I realized that
actors really don't
have much of
interest to say).
My frustration
increased when I
scoured the auto
graph line after

the panel.
Whereas the 4,5(X)-seat auditorium was filled with
teens and young adults, this line revealed mostly mid
dle-aged men and women with the intense look in
their eyes characteristic of outsiders anxious to sell
their not-so-prized autograph on eßay the next day.
Meanwhile, 1 couldn't even catch a glimpse of the
actors, as security was intently herding us away.
At Comic-Con, I was suffocated by the sweaty
throngs of people, aggravated by the incompetence of
the staff and security and appalled by the lack of orga
nization and the illogical approach to planning, but
what perplexed me the most was fact that no other
convention-goers seemed to care.
While it's true that nothing can match the unique
ness of a Comic-Con experience, for me it's an expe
rience that only needed to happen once.
