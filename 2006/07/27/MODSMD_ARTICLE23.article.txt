# SAN DIEGO COMIC CON
## With great power...

COMIC CON MAN

For one weekend every summer, the
streets of downtown San Diego sure are
a sight to see. Hotel rooms fill up, traffic
slows many of the streets down to a crawl
and, oh yeah, don't be surprised to see

someone dressed up
like Cloud Strife
from Sony's "Final
Fantasy" video game
series picking up a
Snickers bar at a cor
ner 7-Eleven.
It's all for one rea
son: the San Diego
Comic Con
International, an
annual convention
featuring literally
hundreds of booths,
panels, and
announcements
(accompanied by
many an hour-long
line) devoted to
bringing attendees
from all around the
world the latest in
comic, video game,
television and movie
news. On top of that,
many of entertain
ment's biggest stars
(Kevin Smith,
Nicholas Cage,
Tobey Maguire, and
Quentin Tarantino)
show up to meet fans
and give the latest
scoop on their
respective projects.
The biggest
events of the show, of
course, have to do
with some of the larg
er film releases com
ing out over the next
year or so, and there
might not be a bigger
release than the
upcoming "Spider-
Man 3," due out next
May. Director Sam

Raimi was there with stars Tobey
Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Topher Grace,
Bryce Dallas Howard and Thomas
Haden Church to speak about the film.
Perhaps most significant (although not
the most surprising to many fans) piece
of information was the official announce
ment of the film's villains, the Sandman
(Church) and fan-favorite Venom
(Grace). Also added to the fold is classic
Spidey leading lady Gwen Stacy
(Howard).
Raimi was tight-lipped about much of
the plot (no word on other villains hinted
at in the earlier films, such as the Lizard),
but he did discuss his plans to elaborate
on many of the relationships from the
previous films and to imbue the charac
ters with a much higher level of maturity
this time around. Many questions asked
revolved around Grace's portrayal of
Eddie Brock (a.k.a. Venom), and Grace
pointed out his distinction in that "unlike
most bad guys, he truly loves being evil."
The most exciting moment of the panel
came at the end, when fans caught a
glimpse of some never-before-seen
footage from the film, finishing with an
image of a computer-generated Venom
in all his glory. Judging from the standing
ovation, this depiction of Venom was
quite well-received (and let me say, as a
true "Spider-Man" devotee, this Venom

rocks).
One film that stood out above the rest
was "3()0," an adaptation of the classic
Frank Miller graphic novel. The graphic
novel, comprised of two-page spreads, is
extremely stylized and violent and, much
to the elation of those in attendance,
early footage indicates that the film will

ronow suit, just
imagine a massive,
violent, epic battle,
one that you'd only
like to see more of.
"300" comes out in
early 2007 and I
promise you, it's
something to get
really excited about.
Also notable
was Samuel L.
Jackson's appear
ance to promote his
upcoming "Snakes
on a Plane," a rare
instance where
everyone aware of
its existence is pretty
certain that it will be
the greatest film of
all time. Everyone
involved seems to be
aware at this point of
the film's draw:
excessive violence
and even nudity
were promised, and
there was no short
age of the use of the
word motherf***er
by Mr. Jackson. Ten
minutes of footage
were shown to the
audience, which
basically meant ten
minutes of surpris
ingly intense action
where tons of snakes
were unleashed
upon the plane's
passengers, biting
and squeezing many
to death. As he
introduced himself
at the beginning of
the panel, "I've had

it with these motherf***ing snakes on
this motherf***ing plane!" It doesn't get
better than that.
Other film events at the show includ
ed the announcement of the screen
adaptation of Will Eisner's "The Spirit"
comic (with the title character being con
sidered the greatest of all time by pretty
much anyone who's read it), footage of
the third "Pirates" film (where we'll
finally get an ending), and a talk given by
Kevin Smith (who showed up several
hours late, forcing "Clerks II" star
Rosario Dawson to give an impromptu
O&A session complete with a little
singing from "Rent.")
Really, that's just the tip of the iceberg,
folks. On top of all that, the Penny-
Arcade.com guys were giving out free
sketches, Pikachu wandered around for
photo ops, and thousands of comic books
were sold. There were lightsaber battles,
"Evil Dead" Reenactments, and debates
over which X-Man is the least plausible
(my vote is Storm-you tell me what muta
tion would make it possible to control
weather and only weather). It's difficult to
explain the significance of the San Diego
Comic Con and after 75 years, tens of thou
sands of fans, dozens of star appearances
and countless geek debates, there's still far
more awesomeness to be looked back
upon.

were shown to the
audience, which
basically meant ten
minutes of surpris
ingly intense action
where tons of snakes
were unleashed
upon the plane's
passengers, biting
and squeezing many
to death. As he
introduced himself
at the beginning of
the panel, "I've had

it with these motherf***ing snakes on
this motherf***ing plane!" It doesn't get
better than that.
Other film events at the show includ
ed the announcement of the screen
adaptation of Will Eisner's "The Spirit"
comic (with the title character being con
sidered the greatest of all time by pretty
much anyone who's read it), footage of
the third "Pirates" film (where we'll
finally get an ending), and a talk given by
Kevin Smith (who showed up several
hours late, forcing "Clerks II" star
Rosario Dawson to give an impromptu
O&A session complete with a little
singing from "Rent.")
Really, that's just the tip of the iceberg,
folks. On top of all that, the Penny-
Arcade.com guys were giving out free
sketches, Pikachu wandered around for
photo ops, and thousands of comic books
were sold. There were lightsaber battles,
"Evil Dead" Reenactments, and debates
over which X-Man is the least plausible
(my vote is Storm-you tell me what muta
tion would make it possible to control
weather and only weather). It's difficult to
explain the significance of the San Diego
Comic Con and after 75 years, tens of thou
sands of fans, dozens of star appearances
and countless geek debates, there's still far
more awesomeness to be looked back
upon.
