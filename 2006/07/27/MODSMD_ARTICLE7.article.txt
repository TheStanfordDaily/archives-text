## Heat wave grips campus With reduced chilled water supply, cooling curtailment faced 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES NEWS EDITOR 
With observed highs of over 90
degrees Fahrenheit, Friday through
Tuesday, and a peak of 105 on
Saturday, the University has been
struggling to deal with the recent heat
wave.
Curtailment measures have been
taken across campus because of a
shortage in the chilled water supply.
Nearly 30 buildings were curtailed
Friday to save the supply for hospital
and critical research use, while many
have also simply had their thermostat
temperatures set higher.
Much of the problem has arisen
from the ongoing construction of the
Central Energy plant chilled water
project. With expansion occurring and
repairs needed for installed chillers,
the plant is running below its 22,000-
ton chilling capacity (one ton of chill
ing capacity is equivalent to the chill
ing power of a one-ton block of ice).
Among the chillers available, one
1,000-ton unit went offline over the
weekend because of a failed seal; it
was running again Tuesday night.
Similarly, a 2,500-ton unit is in need of

its motor to be rewound, which is
expected to be done by late Monday.
To alleviate the situation, a tempo
rary chilled water plant has been built
on Roble Field. The facility has added
nearly 3,400 additional tons to the
chilled water supply, and another
1,500-ton chiller will be installed this
weekend, with more equipment on its
way from vendors as it becomes avail
able.
Associate Vice Provost for
Facilities Chris Christofferson said in
an e-mail to faculty and staff that
Facilities Operations Zone
Management "will do everything pos
sible to minimize the impact to your
programs that depend on chilled
water."
The Central Energy plant chilled
water project, according to
Christofferson, is expected to be com
pleted in September, with some
improvements and increased chilled
water capacity by early August.
"However, recent long-range
weather forecasts indicate that the
summer and fall temperatures will be
the hotter than previous years," he
said. "This means we expect to have
additional periods of curtailment
throughout this time."
Other than departments, students
are facing a difficult time coping with
