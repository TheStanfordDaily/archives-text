## Veto puts stemcell research at forefront again 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
With President Bush's veto of a bill, July 19. that
would have expanded federal funding for stem-cell
research, the stem-cell debate has again risen with
Stanford at the center as a research institution.
The decision. Bush's first veto as president, came
only several days after the Stanford School of Medicine
announced 16 scholars chosen to receive state-funded
stem-cell research training.
Neurology Professor William Hurlbut, a member of
the President's Council on Bioethics since 2002, was at
the White House when President Bush announced the
veto. According to Hurlbut, the veto was "predicted,
and consistent with the president's campaign promise
and longstanding policy."
Most scientists have criticized the administration's
opposition to the research area.
"I think the veto is very ill-advised and certainly a
tremendous handicap to American scientists who want
to work in this field," said Paul Berg, Nobel laureate
and professor emeritus in biochemistry.
Berg emphasized that tens of thousands of embryos
that are discarded weekly. "In many cases they're just
tossed down the drain," he said.
"If they're going to be destroyed anyway, why not
use them in a way that could possibly create benefits?
The president just insists on using his veto power,"
Berg added.
Christopher Scott of the Stanford Center for
Biomedical Ethics said that he also opposed the veto
and supported the full funding of embryonic stem-cell
research. Scott serves as executive director for
