## Veto puts stemcell research at forefront again 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
With President Bush's veto of a bill, July 19. that
would have expanded federal funding for stem-cell
research, the stem-cell debate has again risen with
Stanford at the center as a research institution.
The decision. Bush's first veto as president, came
only several days after the Stanford School of Medicine
announced 16 scholars chosen to receive state-funded
stem-cell research training.
Neurology Professor William Hurlbut, a member of
the President's Council on Bioethics since 2002, was at
the White House when President Bush announced the
veto. According to Hurlbut, the veto was "predicted,
and consistent with the president's campaign promise
and longstanding policy."
Most scientists have criticized the administration's
opposition to the research area.
"I think the veto is very ill-advised and certainly a
tremendous handicap to American scientists who want
to work in this field," said Paul Berg, Nobel laureate
and professor emeritus in biochemistry.
Berg emphasized that tens of thousands of embryos
that are discarded weekly. "In many cases they're just
tossed down the drain," he said.
"If they're going to be destroyed anyway, why not
use them in a way that could possibly create benefits?
The president just insists on using his veto power,"
Berg added.
Christopher Scott of the Stanford Center for
Biomedical Ethics said that he also opposed the veto
and supported the full funding of embryonic stem-cell
research. Scott serves as executive director for
Stanford's Program for Stem Cells
in Society (PSCS).
With the veto, said Scott, "we're
basically at the status quo in terms of
where we're going to get funding to
push our research agenda forward."
President of Stanford Students
for Life (SSFL) Dennis Adams dis
agrees with the University's
research agenda. The group official
ly opposes embryonic stem-cell
research.
"I don't like the fact that
Stanford receives state and private
funding to do embryonic stem-cell
research," Adams said. "In fact, I
disapprove of embryonic stem-cell
research anywhere, whether at
Stanford or any other institution. 1
think it speaks a lot about Stanford's
code of ethics with respect to scien
tific research: to me, this means the
University needs to reevaluate its
goals in contributing to the common
good of society."
Research at the School of
Medicine's Institute for Stem Cell
Biology and Regenerative Medicine
is undertaken with guidance from
the Center for Biomedical Ethics
regarding the ethical considerations
of stem-cell research. The
University's policy regarding this
research "is designed to help
researchers take advantage of state

funding opportunities while remain
ing compliant with federal law," the
Institute's website says. The Human
Embryonic Stem Cell Research
Panel oversees the enforcement of
this policy.
Scientists apply for funding
through the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), a
state initiative created in 2004 by
Proposition 71. The proposition was
crafted in response to the federal
restrictions imposed by the Bush
administration in 2001, and reaf
firmed with last week's veto.
Stanford researchers must under
go training and may pursue embry
onic stem cell research using
University facilities and equipment
on the condition that they receive no
federal support.
Last Friday, California Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger announced
a new $150-million loan to CIRM,
allowing some research to begin.
"I'm 100 percent committed to
advancing stem-cell research in
California, and to the promise that it
holds for millions of our citizens
who suffer from chronic diseases,"
Schwarzenegger said Friday.
Scott remarked that
Schwarzenegger's loan "is a very
good thing for California schools
because the next stage of research
can get underway. The fact that the
state initiative is showing some life is
a very good sign."
However, Berg highlighted the
scientific collaboration that may be
lost with the veto.
"What we need is not just

California scientists working on
this," he said. "What we need is as
many people working in this field as
possible to generate the kinds of
breakthroughs and discoveries that
are going to make this a prominent
field."
Berg also emphasized that the
lack of federal funding hinders
research at Stanford in a major way,
despite the fact that Stanford scien
tists are funded privately and by the
state. For example, much of
Stanford's laboratory equipment
and facilities receive federal funding
and therefore cannot be used for
stem-cell research.
"We don't have the facilities in
which to do the research because of
this prohibition," added Berg.
Though Hurlbut acknowledged
the difficulties faced in national col
laboration and facility and equip
ment use, he said he did not think
the veto would have a major impact
on Stanford due to the funding
received from Proposition 71.
Hurlbut also maintained that the
future of biology centers around the
study of embryogenesis and later
development.
"We're in the age of develop
mental biology now," he said. "This
is just the first of many dilemmas
we're going to face where there is
going to be moral conflict. Science
always proceeds forward within a
frame of moral consideration."
"It is understandable that
Stanford would seek to become
prominent in embryonic stem cell
research," Hurlbut continued. "I

think this science is worth pursuing.
If we can get these cells without cre
ating and destroying embryos, then
all of America could go forward
with affirmation of this research."
Hurlbut himself supports an
alternative process known as
Altered Nuclear Transfer, which
produces pluripotent stem cells
without creating or destroying
embryos. Adams also philosophi
cally disagrees with the current use
and destruction of the human
embryo. He hopes the University
reconsiders its approach to stem
cell research.
"Stanford is the hub of the latest
scientific research in many fields; it's
regarded in high esteem by leaders
worldwide," Adams said. "It would
be even more impressive if the
University could set the highest
precedent of ethical principles."
Berg estimated that 95 percent of
Stanford scientists and faculty mem
bers are supportive of stem-cell
research.
"Stanford is gung-ho for doing
this research and we're in the
process of raising money to build a
building which will house the Stem
Cell Institute," he said. "I'm sure
that we'll succeed in doing that in
the next couple years."
"The University supports stem
cell research," agreed Scott.
"There's a general feeling among
those I work with at the Center for
Biomedical Ethics that, with some
oversight, embryonic stem cell
research ought to go ahead full
speed."

ating and destroying embryos, then
all of America could go forward
with affirmation of this research."
Hurlbut himself supports an
alternative process known as
Altered Nuclear Transfer, which
produces pluripotent stem cells
without creating or destroying
embryos. Adams also philosophi
cally disagrees with the current use
and destruction of the human
embryo. He hopes the University
reconsiders its approach to stem
cell research.
"Stanford is the hub of the latest
scientific research in many fields; it's
regarded in high esteem by leaders
worldwide," Adams said. "It would
be even more impressive if the
University could set the highest
precedent of ethical principles."
Berg estimated that 95 percent of
Stanford scientists and faculty mem
bers are supportive of stem-cell
research.
"Stanford is gung-ho for doing
this research and we're in the
process of raising money to build a
building which will house the Stem
Cell Institute," he said. "I'm sure
that we'll succeed in doing that in
the next couple years."
"The University supports stem
cell research," agreed Scott.
"There's a general feeling among
those I work with at the Center for
Biomedical Ethics that, with some
oversight, embryonic stem cell
research ought to go ahead full
speed."
With President Bush's veto of a bill, July 19. that
would have expanded federal funding for stem-cell
research, the stem-cell debate has again risen with
Stanford at the center as a research institution.
The decision. Bush's first veto as president, came
only several days after the Stanford School of Medicine
announced 16 scholars chosen to receive state-funded
stem-cell research training.
Neurology Professor William Hurlbut, a member of
the President's Council on Bioethics since 2002, was at
the White House when President Bush announced the
veto. According to Hurlbut, the veto was "predicted,
and consistent with the president's campaign promise
and longstanding policy."
Most scientists have criticized the administration's
opposition to the research area.
"I think the veto is very ill-advised and certainly a
tremendous handicap to American scientists who want
to work in this field," said Paul Berg, Nobel laureate
and professor emeritus in biochemistry.
Berg emphasized that tens of thousands of embryos
that are discarded weekly. "In many cases they're just
tossed down the drain," he said.
"If they're going to be destroyed anyway, why not
use them in a way that could possibly create benefits?
The president just insists on using his veto power,"
Berg added.
Christopher Scott of the Stanford Center for
Biomedical Ethics said that he also opposed the veto
and supported the full funding of embryonic stem-cell
research. Scott serves as executive director for
Stanford's Program for Stem Cells
in Society (PSCS).
With the veto, said Scott, "we're
basically at the status quo in terms of
where we're going to get funding to
push our research agenda forward."
President of Stanford Students
for Life (SSFL) Dennis Adams dis
agrees with the University's
research agenda. The group official
ly opposes embryonic stem-cell
research.
"I don't like the fact that
Stanford receives state and private
funding to do embryonic stem-cell
research," Adams said. "In fact, I
disapprove of embryonic stem-cell
research anywhere, whether at
Stanford or any other institution. 1
think it speaks a lot about Stanford's
code of ethics with respect to scien
tific research: to me, this means the
University needs to reevaluate its
goals in contributing to the common
good of society."
Research at the School of
Medicine's Institute for Stem Cell
Biology and Regenerative Medicine
is undertaken with guidance from
the Center for Biomedical Ethics
regarding the ethical considerations
of stem-cell research. The
University's policy regarding this
research "is designed to help
researchers take advantage of state

funding opportunities while remain
ing compliant with federal law," the
Institute's website says. The Human
Embryonic Stem Cell Research
Panel oversees the enforcement of
this policy.
Scientists apply for funding
through the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), a
state initiative created in 2004 by
Proposition 71. The proposition was
crafted in response to the federal
restrictions imposed by the Bush
administration in 2001, and reaf
firmed with last week's veto.
Stanford researchers must under
go training and may pursue embry
onic stem cell research using
University facilities and equipment
on the condition that they receive no
federal support.
Last Friday, California Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger announced
a new $150-million loan to CIRM,
allowing some research to begin.
"I'm 100 percent committed to
advancing stem-cell research in
California, and to the promise that it
holds for millions of our citizens
who suffer from chronic diseases,"
Schwarzenegger said Friday.
Scott remarked that
Schwarzenegger's loan "is a very
good thing for California schools
because the next stage of research
can get underway. The fact that the
state initiative is showing some life is
a very good sign."
However, Berg highlighted the
scientific collaboration that may be
lost with the veto.
"What we need is not just

California scientists working on
this," he said. "What we need is as
many people working in this field as
possible to generate the kinds of
breakthroughs and discoveries that
are going to make this a prominent
field."
Berg also emphasized that the
lack of federal funding hinders
research at Stanford in a major way,
despite the fact that Stanford scien
tists are funded privately and by the
state. For example, much of
Stanford's laboratory equipment
and facilities receive federal funding
and therefore cannot be used for
stem-cell research.
"We don't have the facilities in
which to do the research because of
this prohibition," added Berg.
Though Hurlbut acknowledged
the difficulties faced in national col
laboration and facility and equip
ment use, he said he did not think
the veto would have a major impact
on Stanford due to the funding
received from Proposition 71.
Hurlbut also maintained that the
future of biology centers around the
study of embryogenesis and later
development.
"We're in the age of develop
mental biology now," he said. "This
is just the first of many dilemmas
we're going to face where there is
going to be moral conflict. Science
always proceeds forward within a
frame of moral consideration."
"It is understandable that
Stanford would seek to become
prominent in embryonic stem cell
research," Hurlbut continued. "I

think this science is worth pursuing.
If we can get these cells without cre
ating and destroying embryos, then
all of America could go forward
with affirmation of this research."
Hurlbut himself supports an
alternative process known as
Altered Nuclear Transfer, which
produces pluripotent stem cells
without creating or destroying
