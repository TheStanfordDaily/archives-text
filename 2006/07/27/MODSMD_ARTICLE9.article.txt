position," Etchcmendy said in a news release.
Biencnstock agrees that that Arvin's expe

University's strength as a research institution.
"I'm absolutely delighted [about Ann's

appointment]," Beinenstock said. "She served
as associate dean of research, so I worked with
her personally. She's exercised her responsibil
ity thoughtfully, carefully, and I admire her
very much."

Other than a general
interest in expanding the
support for university
research and seeking further
funding, Arvin also
expressed an ongoing inter

ethnic diversity in research.
Having already participated
in such initiatives, Arvin
voiced concern for the chal
lenges faced by women.

especially those seeking university research
careers.
"1 consider efforts in these areas an essen
tial and unfinished task for the university com
munity," she said in a news release.

tor of the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory (SSRL),
Bienenstock also brings personal
interests to his appointment as spe
cial assistant to the president for fed
eral research policy.
The newly created position of spe
cial assistant will allow Bienenstock
to further his work on science and
national security. Although there are

no clearly defined duties as of yet,
Bienenstock plans to work with other
research universities and the national
government in federal research poli
cies.
"The role is particularly impor
tant, as there are tensions between
the U.S. moving ahead in science and
technology, and maintaining national
security," he said. "I have spent a lot
of my time on that. [Currently] I'm
organizing a meeting for the council
at Stanford to deal with those issues."
Nominated by President Clinton
in 1997, Bienenstock was the associ
ate director for science of the White
House Office of Science and

Technology Policy. In his govern
ment role, Bienenstock became one
of the leading advisors in science for
the United States. This experience
has prepared him for his new federal
position. Although Bienenstock
worked closely with many govern
ment organizations, he explained
that "representing the University was
always a priority."
With two dedicated advocates for
science and research leading the way
for Stanford, the new appointments
set high expectations for the
improvement and expansion of the
university as a leading academic and
research institute.
