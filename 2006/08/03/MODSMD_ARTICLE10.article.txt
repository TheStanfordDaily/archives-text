## Food's the Thing Variety of food with unique textures and tastes is always worth a try 
### 
Sea urchin foam. Goat cheese
ice cream. Lime jelly. No,
these aren't echinoderm excre
tions, a prank at Cold Stone or a
new flavor of lube. These were
things I ate last weekend at the
Scandinavian restaurant Aquavit.
We ordered the bites tasting
menu: 17 courses, each of which
could be eaten in a single bite.
This meant that we got to try 17
different combinations of sea
urchin, beets, goat cheese,
Tandoori spices, cucumber, salmon
tartare, smoked herring, crenie
fraiche and, well, the Swedish
liquor "aquavit." The flavors
included saffron, star anise and
lemongrass, and the preparations,
smoked and Tandoori. We encoun
tered many flavors I'd never imag
ined before tasting them, such as
"smoked yellow tomato cold soup."
But combining different flavors
isn't the only way the chef, Marcus
Samuelson, creates variety. He says
texture is another of his building
blocks, and he sees potential for
many textures from a single staple.
"For example if you have a melon.

I think about melon granite, melon
foam, hot melon soup, cold melon
soup, melon ice cream, melon sor
bet...one ingredient gives you six
different types of textures which
will then drive the
flavors," he said in an interview
with Jocelyn Morse of Star Chefs.
I certainly saw this texture cre
ativity in action. The most amusing
textures were the foams, which
included beet foam, horseradish
loam, potato foam, and sea urchin
foam. I'd guess that one-fifth of the
ingredients, I'd never tasted, and
another three-fifths were things I'd
never tasted in the texture in which
they were presented. And of
course, each combination of food
was radically different from any
combination I'd had before.

The meal hardly felt like a meal,
and the food hardly felt like food. 1
came
out of the restaurant feeling as
though I were leaving an art gallery
or symphony performance, with my
brain still intoxicated from the
heady sensory experiences.
Indeed, this meal and similar
meals aren't different from a music
performance or art gallery. At all
three, you take in complicated and
possibly stirring sensory informa
tion. You experience things you
might not have seen, heard or tast
ed before; but familiarity with the
style or composing ingredients
(instruments, media, or individual
flavors) increases your ability to
appreciate them in the art you're
currently sensing. All three can
stimulate the mind, and all three, I
think, can be ennobling.
Yes, here's the beef: I think eat
ing interesting food can be part ol
general self-improvement.
I'd define "interesting food" as

Runyan
Columnist
food with contrasting or complicated flavors and textures,
as well as novel combinations of foods in a single bite.
Firstly, interesting food shakes up the taste and smell
cortices. Evidence by Berkeley neuroanatomist Marian
Diamond suggests that novel sensory stimulation (i.e. an
enriched environment) can increase neurogenesis in rats.
Eating is an area where it's relatively easy to introduce a
large amount of novelty. You can't move very often or
switch jobs more than occasionally, but with a little you can
eat something new several times a day.
Secondly, trying different tastes and combinations of
tastes will likely improve your relevant senses of taste and
smell. In a presentation at the Berkeley Conference
"Flavors of Experience," researcher Dana Small reported
that past experience with certain tastes improves one's
ability to discern them.
Next, with more developed senses, you can enjoy food
more. When you have the
privilege of eating exceptional food, the magnificence
won't be lost on you.
Another benefit is that interesting foods can stimulate
the imagination. Eating smoked yellow tomato cold soup
somehow made me think of loss and devastation. My first
thought upon eating smoked herring with star anise,
cloves, and a sun-dried tomato was, this tastes like
Christmas. Yet another smoked herring tasted like a camp
fire in the woods. Given some time to savor these tastes, 1
think I could come up with stories to induce the same emo
tions the dishes invoke, or I could find music pieces to do
the same.
Not at all the last benefit, but the last on this list is that
interesting foods might help you to remember things from
your history. It's unlikely that food will help you find your
keys, but eating things you don't normally eat might
remind you of things you don't normally remember. If
Marcel hadn't tried the madeleines, how would he have
remembered his Sundays in Combray?
All in all, taste can be another dimension to an enriched
environment and enjoyment of life. Until eating at
Aquavit, I'd felt that quality food were desired mainly for
its hedonic value. But now I feel like a larger value of taste
is enriching one's mental and sensory life. I'd go so far as
to say that partaking of quality, interesting food is an
imperative on the same level as going to appreciate art,
music or dance. With some creativity with flavor and food
pairings, almost every bite we eat can edify us.

Andrea will he a senior in math next fall and will attempt to
give a thoughtful reply to all responses and comments. She
can he reached at arunyan@stanford.edu.
