## Food's the Thing Variety of food with unique textures and tastes is always worth a try 
### 
Sea urchin foam. Goat cheese
ice cream. Lime jelly. No,
these aren't echinoderm excre
tions, a prank at Cold Stone or a
new flavor of lube. These were
things I ate last weekend at the
Scandinavian restaurant Aquavit.
We ordered the bites tasting
menu: 17 courses, each of which
could be eaten in a single bite.
This meant that we got to try 17
different combinations of sea
urchin, beets, goat cheese,
Tandoori spices, cucumber, salmon
tartare, smoked herring, crenie
fraiche and, well, the Swedish
liquor "aquavit." The flavors
included saffron, star anise and
lemongrass, and the preparations,
smoked and Tandoori. We encoun
tered many flavors I'd never imag
ined before tasting them, such as
"smoked yellow tomato cold soup."
But combining different flavors
isn't the only way the chef, Marcus
Samuelson, creates variety. He says
texture is another of his building
blocks, and he sees potential for
many textures from a single staple.
"For example if you have a melon.

I think about melon granite, melon
foam, hot melon soup, cold melon
soup, melon ice cream, melon sor
bet...one ingredient gives you six
different types of textures which
will then drive the
flavors," he said in an interview
with Jocelyn Morse of Star Chefs.
I certainly saw this texture cre
ativity in action. The most amusing
textures were the foams, which
included beet foam, horseradish
loam, potato foam, and sea urchin
foam. I'd guess that one-fifth of the
ingredients, I'd never tasted, and
another three-fifths were things I'd
never tasted in the texture in which
they were presented. And of
course, each combination of food
was radically different from any
combination I'd had before.

The meal hardly felt like a meal,
and the food hardly felt like food. 1
came
out of the restaurant feeling as
though I were leaving an art gallery
or symphony performance, with my
brain still intoxicated from the
heady sensory experiences.
Indeed, this meal and similar
meals aren't different from a music
performance or art gallery. At all
three, you take in complicated and
possibly stirring sensory informa
tion. You experience things you
might not have seen, heard or tast
ed before; but familiarity with the
style or composing ingredients
(instruments, media, or individual
flavors) increases your ability to
appreciate them in the art you're
currently sensing. All three can
stimulate the mind, and all three, I
think, can be ennobling.
Yes, here's the beef: I think eat
ing interesting food can be part ol
general self-improvement.
I'd define "interesting food" as
