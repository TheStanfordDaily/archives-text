## Night of the Living Dumb Zombies are no laughing matter; prepare a contingency plan or prepare to die

lam kind of afraid of zombies. Maybe you think that a well
founded fear of the hungry undead may not be a bad thing.
In that case, we are clearly destined to be friends.
If you're actually thinking, "Wait, are you afraid of zombie
movies or that zombies are actually going to eat you? Because
zombies don't exist, McCrazy." In that case, we have a prob
lem. And you don't have very much imagination.
For example, try to use your limited imaginative skills to pic
ture yourself getting into a car, by yourself, late at night. Do
you check the backseat before you start driving? If you belong
to the second category of people, you probably don't, and you

will probably be killed by a backseat
murderer someday. In the newspaper
article about your death, the police
officer will grimly remark, "He didn't
check the backseat," and shake his
head sadly.
If you do check the backseat (good
job!), do you think that there is going
to be someone with a knife who is
going to demand your money, or do
you think there is going to be a very
hungry zombie?
Because I kind of think there's
going to be a very hungry zombie. Or,
possibly, Michael Myers.
The problem is that I take horror

movies seriously. Normal people (1 assume; I don't have much
contact with normal people) watch a movie and jump when the
zombie eats someone's brain, and then go home and sleep
soundly. I, on the other hand, tend to come home, think about
zombies eating someone's intestines like pull-and-peel
Twizzlers, try to sleep, imagine that I saw the closet door move,
stare at the closet door in horror for a few minutes, flip on the
lights, assure myself that I'm crazy, turn off the lights, think that
I see the doorknob to my room turning, watch that in horror for
a few minutes, then finally accept that I'm not sleeping until
daybreak and turn on my bedside lamp to read something
innocuous and zombie-free, like Anne of Green Gables. The fact
that I get any sleep at all is contingent on my belief that zombies
can't attack after dawn, and there is no way that I am ever going
to watch Dawn of the Dead, so nothing will take away that shred
of comfort.
For clarification, I don't actually believe that zombies are

phobias, you

real. But at three in the morning, when you're not entirely sure
if you hear the shuffling of undead feet or not, reality becomes
a very fluid concept.
Knowing my penchant for nights like this, 1 try to avoid hor
ror movies at all costs. Unfortunately, my so-called "friends"
sometimes trick me into seeing movies by saying that they're
"comedies" or by mocking me ruthlessly until 1 acquiesce.
Take, for instance, Shaun of the Dead. Shaun of (he Dead is
reportedly humorous. In fact, it has zombies in it, and they eat
people's brains. 12 Monkeys is a scary movie about a killer virus
that will kill you, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The
Others is not a thriller, and it has ghosts in it. Just to give you a
heads up.
1 think I've dealt admirably with my phobia, though. Unlike

conventional phobias, you can't get
therapy for this one (I don't think.
Though I do like the idea of exposing
someone first to the word "zombie,"
and then to pictures of zombies, and
then to a zombie movie, and finally
you meet a zombie in real life and
shake hands with him. And then he
eats your brain. Hmm, that may be
why they don't have acclimation
therapy for zombie phobias.)
Instead, I've developed an elaborate
escape plan in case of zombie attack.
The plan is pretty much locking
myself in my closet and waiting to be
eaten.

An alternate plan is to jump out the window and get to my
car, and then drive to Wal-Mart. My friends and I have agreed
that Wal-Mart is the perfect location to hide from zombies
because there is lots of food and also guns. The only problem is
the numerous aisles and entrances in which zombies can lie in
wait.
You might be laughing at me now, but just think about
who's going to be laughing when you hear the blood-curdling
groan of a ravenous zombie and high-tail it to Wal-Mart only to
find the doors already locked and me safely inside.
The zombies. The zombies are going to be laughing, because
they are going to eat both of us anyway.

Sini is probably joking. Unless you don't think she is, and you
have zombie prevention strategies. In that case, you should e
