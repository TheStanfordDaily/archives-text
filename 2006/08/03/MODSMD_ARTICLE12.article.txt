# ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
## Fresh, Independent thinking needed on renewables Global Climate and Energy Project is beholden to corporate, not always best, interests 
### GREGORY LEE 
Last year, I was looking for research
opportunities on renewable energy, and
had trouble finding any projects on
renewables. Eventually, a professor directed
me to the Global Climate and Energy Project
(GCEP).
I discovered that the Global Climate and
Energy Project is a $225 million, long-term
research effort funded by four companies —
ExxonMobil, General Electric, Schlumberger
and Toyota. It looked promising; it had lots
of funding. However, I was struck by the
choice of projects that are funded. Improving
the internal combustion engine. Carbon cap
ture and storage. These are not renewable
energy projects: these are short-term fixes
and clean-up methods. I wondered, why does
this project, which has enormous potential to
help our global climate, focus on projects that

can only do a limited amount of good?
The majority of the projects support tech
nologies that need, or could need, petroleum
in the future. Almost half the projects con
cern carbon storage and advanced combus
tion. Carbon storage attempts to capture car
bon in the atmosphere and somehow store it
so that it can't contribute to global warming.
Hydrogen research accounts for another
quarter. There are only a few GCEP projects
on solar at Stanford, and none on other
renewables, like wind, geothermal, ocean
power. While the funded projects are not
necessarily bad, is this the portfolio of tech
nologies we think will solve the greenhouse
gas problem? As an example, carbon storage
would require the capture and storage of
hundreds of Petagrams of carbon (yes, that's
10 A l5 grams).
GCEP is funded by industry, and the
sponsors get the last say in which projects are
funded. ExxonMobil, the biggest sponsor,
has one of the worst environmental track
records of any company. There is also no
accountability for which projects are funded,
since few people know about GCEP. In the
words of one graduate student, "certain pro

jects are not publicized when they are fund
ed. It's almost like they suppress information
about these projects."
We have an enormous grant to research
technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emis
sions, yet the projects are not what they could
be. GCEP should consider that solutions dif
fer according to situation: the geothermal
technologies that can completely power
countries like Iceland and Turkey are useless
in Algeria, where solar is more feasible.
Ocean power in England, that's surrounded
by water with its tides and currents, could
produce many times annual energy demands.
In fact, ocean energy in its various forms, like
thermal and tidal, has barely been explored,
even on a theoretical level. What if GCEP
spent $50 million on deep-sea tidal energy
farms, or ocean current generators, areas
with enormous potential to provide energy,
but little research? GCEP could radically
change the face of renewables if it could
widen its focus to help to create the diverse
portfolio of technologies that has a chance
together to provide low impact energy.
According to some professors, some tech
nologies aren't suitable for study at Stanford

because Stanford is a research university.
According to them, problems facing the wind
power industry are primarily engineering, not
research. However, we have engineers at
Stanford. Why can't they get more involved
in GCEP, or more importantly, renewable
energy? To confine yourself to "pure"
research misses the point: we need to halt
human impact on climate change. The mis
sion of GCEP is "fundamental, pre-commer
cial research on technologies that would fos
ter the development of a global energy sys
tem with low greenhouse gas emissions." The
project is falling short: there are areas where
"pre-commercial" research is needed that are
being ignored. GCEP should try to lay the
groundwork for renewable energy for all sit
uations. And even if GCEP is so committed
to its "pre-commercial" approach, Stanford,
which prides itself on innovation and tech
nology, should take the initiative and fill in
the gaps.
