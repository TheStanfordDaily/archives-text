## U. California to examine race in admissions policies 
### TALIA KENNEDY THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE (UC-DAVIS 
U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. (July
28, 2006) — When California
voters passed Proposition 209 in
1996, they prohibited the
University of California from
considering race and gender in
admissions decisions. Ten years
later, UC wants to study the
effects of this measure.
In an effort to understand why
the number of registered African
American and other minority stu
dents is declining at the 10 UC
campuses, the UC Board of
Regents ordered a study to dissect
the issue.
Regent Eddie Island said he
supported the study during their
July 19 meeting in San Francisco.
"African Americans are
deserting from UC at an alarming
and precipitous rate," he said.
"[African-American students]
feel a palpable degree of hostility.
If 209 brought about that result,
we ought to know about it."
Introduced by Regent
Frederick Ruiz and Student
Regent Maria Ledesma, a UCLA
graduate student, the study will
aim to explain why so few minori
ty students are choosing the UC
system for their undergraduate
education.
While the study will not pro
pose to reverse voters' decision to

uphold Proposition 209, it will try
to find legal methods of recruiting
and admitting African American
and Latino students to UC,
according to UC President
Robert Dynes.
Regent John Moores, owner of
the San Diego Padres, said he felt
the university's admissions poli
cies are confusing. •
"I strongly favor transparency
about UC admissions, which
presently is sorely lacking," he said.
Moores asked a university
attorney to read the regents' duties
regarding the upholding of state
law, which includes Proposition
209, as a preface to the discussion.
Since 1996, admissions rates
for African American, Latino and
Native American students have
fallen at all UC campuses, espe
cially at UCLA and UC-
Berkeley. Figures for the incom
ing freshman class show percent
ages of these same groups fell at
several campuses, including
UCLA and UC San Diego.
At UCLA, 210 of the 10,487
admitted first-years are African
American; of those, 96 — 2 per
cent of the incoming class —
intend to register for the fall. At
UC Davis, 580 — 2.6 percent —
of the total 22,375 undergraduate
students registered for fall 2005
were African American. Asian
American students comprised 40
percent and white students 38
percent of the campus total.
