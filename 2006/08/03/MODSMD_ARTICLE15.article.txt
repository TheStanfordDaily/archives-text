# Letters from Abroad
## Michael Wilkerson Why Honesty Pays In Uganda, where drivers try to take advantage of Americans, one shows integrity 
### 
Jinja, Uganda (July 20, 2006) — The virtue of honesty is extolled in every
country and every religion, but there are always people who lie, steal and
cheat. Though many may think that being truthful sounds nice but is not
practical for getting ahead, a recent experience showed me how valuable the
truth can be.

It all started in Kamuli. Visiting the small
town for the first time, I took a boda boda
from the taxi park to the house of the friends
I was visiting. A distance of no more than
half a kilometer, the ride took less than two
minutes. "How much?" I asked the driver as
I climbed off. "Seven thousand" he replied
with a straight face. Laughing, I handed him
a five hundred shilling coin and he smiled as
if to say "well it was worth a try" as I walked
away. I have become used to bargaining and
the perception that all whites are supposed
to be flush with cash so I did not think much
of the incident, only that seven thousand was
a much higher amount than others had tried
on me.
The exchange rate is around 1850
Ugandan shillings per dollar. Most boda
boda rides for any distance that takes less
than 10 or 15 minutes cost 500 to 1000
shillings, and the rates outside of Kampala
should be cheaper.
It happened again two weeks later, as I
went to visit Jinja, which lies about 50 miles

utes. Once again I asked how much, and to
my surprise I heard the same price: "seven
thousand." My initial laughter at such an
exaggerated quote was quickly tempered by
the positively evil look I received from the
driver when I said "My friend, 1 live in
Kampala, I know the prices and it shouldn't
be more than five hundred. Why are you try
ing to cheat me?"
"No," he responded with a glare, "seven
thousand." This was new. I have written
before that my treatment by Ugandans has
been consistently

from the capitol of
Kampala on the shores of
Lake Victoria, the source
of the Nile River. But this
time there was no mutual
laughter. I was driven
from one of the round
abouts outside of Jinja to a
small hotel near the center
of town in about five min-

wonderful, and
until now this
had even
extended to
price negotia
tions. But I was
not going to be
cheated. I refused
to pay. Looking at
me as if I were Satan,
the driver tried four

thousand as an offer. Knowing that even five
hundred shillings was probably too much I
offered one thousand as 1 wanted to leave.
He refused to even touch it until I said "this
is it, take it or not," at which point he
snatched the bill and angrily drove off.
After dropping my things in my room, I
set out for Jinja on foot, deciding that I'd
had enough of boda bodas for one day. As I
walked to the center of town, I brushed off
attempts by people on bicycles to give me a
lift, determined that it really wasn't very far
and suddenly skeptical of anyone who want
ed to charge me for something. A boda boda
pulled up alongside me asking if he could
take me to town and I asked "how much"
somewhat sarcastically, expecting a ridicu
lous charge that would shortly be followed
by my rejection.
Instead, his opening bid was seven hun
dred shillings. I couldn't believe it. I was too
shocked to even negotiate down to the three
or five hundred that it should have been

since I had already walked part way. As I
slowly regained my senses, I asked his
name which was Henry Ssenyonga, and
age, which was 22. Not only was Henry
honest, he was also helpful and incredibly
nice. While I grabbed a bite to eat in
town, he went and checked several stores
for the map of Jinja that I had been
unable to find and he knew I wanted. On
a whim, I asked if I could hire him to
take me around to see all of the tourist
sights in Jinja as he was from the area
and also had better English than
many drivers.
Henry proved to be quite the tour
guide and took me to landmarks like the

Source of the Nile and Bujagali Falls as well
as a number of smaller places like the dams
that I didn't know I wanted to see but really
enjoyed. He even saved me from sure trou
ble as soldiers in military uniform ominously
began jogging over to have words with me as
I photographed the new dam. I didn't see
them coming, but Henry did and whisked
me away, avoiding the confrontation that he
told me would probably have ended in either
a bribe or the loss of my pictures.
Grateful for all of his help and mindful of
the fact that he wasn't blatantly trying to take
advantage of me, I insisted that Henry join
me for dinner and asked him why he was dif
ferent than the other drivers and didn't try
and fleece me for all he could. He told me
that first, he was a born again Christian, and
second that he knew there was more to life
than a few thousand extra shillings today.
"The problem which you are having with
some of us boda boda guys is education.
Once you have small education in your head.

it can help you. If you don't have it then
from the roundabout to where you are sleep
ing, seven thousand...Some of them never
covered P7 even P5." Henry had made it
through S3 he told me, before he ran out of
money to pay the fees. I was impressed that
he was even able to make it that far as he is
one of 20 children by his father's four wives.
Uganda follows the British model of
school systems with primary and secondary
schools instead of elementary middle and
high schools. Primary goes through grades 1-
7 (Pl-P7), Secondary goes Sl-S4 which is
ordinary levels, (O levels) or more general
classes and then in S5-S6 students take what
are called A levels where they specialize in a
few areas and from there go to university
with admission based almost solely on how
high their scores on A level tests are. In the
university here (modeled after the British
system), you take one subject (e.g. mass com
munication or engineering for three years
without any broad general requirements).

I asked "how much"
somewhat sarcastically,
expecting a ridiculous charge
that would shortly be
followed by my rejection.

"I missed the chances of schooling so the
only chance I have now is to get friends,"
Henry said. "It is better to get a friend who is
going to help you...as we are together now."
Describing the attitude of most other dri
vers he tried to translate what he said was a
proverb in his language. "You don't know
whether you'll eat or not tomorrow so it is
better to eat today." Meaning that if the
other drivers saw a white person they would
try and charge an exorbitant amount on the
chance that it might be paid.
Because he was honest and I ended up hir
ing Henry as a tour guide for two days; he
made far more money than the seven thou
sand the first too drivers might have gotten if
I hadn't known better. 1 paid him what I
decided was appropriate for such a good tour,
over 40,000 and took him to one of the nicest
restaurants in Jinja for dinner. Tell that story
to someone who says honesty doesn't pay.
Henry truly wants to save up to buy his
own bike and go back to school without tak
ing advantage of people, even dumb mzun
gus, to do it.
"There's a song, 'Different Colors but
One People,' I'm going to buy for you that
tape," he told me as I got on the bus to
Kampala the next day. He will be the first
person I look for when I go back to Jinja, and
I look forward to hearing the song. If more
people behaved like Henry, there is no telling
how much progress Uganda can make.

BODA BODA: Henry's honesty
and appreciation for the value
of education were refreshing in
the adventure to Lake Victoria.

Jinja, Uganda (July 20, 2006) — The virtue of honesty is extolled in every
country and every religion, but there are always people who lie, steal and
cheat. Though many may think that being truthful sounds nice but is not
practical for getting ahead, a recent experience showed me how valuable the
truth can be.

It all started in Kamuli. Visiting the small
town for the first time, I took a boda boda
from the taxi park to the house of the friends
I was visiting. A distance of no more than
half a kilometer, the ride took less than two
minutes. "How much?" I asked the driver as
I climbed off. "Seven thousand" he replied
with a straight face. Laughing, I handed him
a five hundred shilling coin and he smiled as
if to say "well it was worth a try" as I walked
away. I have become used to bargaining and
the perception that all whites are supposed
to be flush with cash so I did not think much
of the incident, only that seven thousand was
a much higher amount than others had tried
on me.
The exchange rate is around 1850
Ugandan shillings per dollar. Most boda
boda rides for any distance that takes less
than 10 or 15 minutes cost 500 to 1000
shillings, and the rates outside of Kampala
should be cheaper.
It happened again two weeks later, as I
went to visit Jinja, which lies about 50 miles

utes. Once again I asked how much, and to
my surprise I heard the same price: "seven
thousand." My initial laughter at such an
exaggerated quote was quickly tempered by
the positively evil look I received from the
driver when I said "My friend, 1 live in
Kampala, I know the prices and it shouldn't
be more than five hundred. Why are you try
ing to cheat me?"
"No," he responded with a glare, "seven
thousand." This was new. I have written
before that my treatment by Ugandans has
been consistently

from the capitol of
Kampala on the shores of
Lake Victoria, the source
of the Nile River. But this
time there was no mutual
laughter. I was driven
from one of the round
abouts outside of Jinja to a
small hotel near the center
of town in about five min-

wonderful, and
until now this
had even
extended to
price negotia
tions. But I was
not going to be
cheated. I refused
to pay. Looking at
me as if I were Satan,
the driver tried four

thousand as an offer. Knowing that even five
hundred shillings was probably too much I
offered one thousand as 1 wanted to leave.
He refused to even touch it until I said "this
is it, take it or not," at which point he
snatched the bill and angrily drove off.
After dropping my things in my room, I
set out for Jinja on foot, deciding that I'd
had enough of boda bodas for one day. As I
walked to the center of town, I brushed off
attempts by people on bicycles to give me a
lift, determined that it really wasn't very far
and suddenly skeptical of anyone who want
ed to charge me for something. A boda boda
pulled up alongside me asking if he could
take me to town and I asked "how much"
somewhat sarcastically, expecting a ridicu
lous charge that would shortly be followed
by my rejection.
Instead, his opening bid was seven hun
dred shillings. I couldn't believe it. I was too
shocked to even negotiate down to the three
or five hundred that it should have been

since I had already walked part way. As I
slowly regained my senses, I asked his
name which was Henry Ssenyonga, and
age, which was 22. Not only was Henry
honest, he was also helpful and incredibly
nice. While I grabbed a bite to eat in
town, he went and checked several stores
for the map of Jinja that I had been
unable to find and he knew I wanted. On
a whim, I asked if I could hire him to
take me around to see all of the tourist
sights in Jinja as he was from the area
and also had better English than
many drivers.
Henry proved to be quite the tour
guide and took me to landmarks like the

Source of the Nile and Bujagali Falls as well
as a number of smaller places like the dams
that I didn't know I wanted to see but really
enjoyed. He even saved me from sure trou
ble as soldiers in military uniform ominously
began jogging over to have words with me as
I photographed the new dam. I didn't see
them coming, but Henry did and whisked
me away, avoiding the confrontation that he
told me would probably have ended in either
a bribe or the loss of my pictures.
Grateful for all of his help and mindful of
the fact that he wasn't blatantly trying to take
advantage of me, I insisted that Henry join
me for dinner and asked him why he was dif
ferent than the other drivers and didn't try
and fleece me for all he could. He told me
that first, he was a born again Christian, and
second that he knew there was more to life
than a few thousand extra shillings today.
"The problem which you are having with
some of us boda boda guys is education.
Once you have small education in your head.

it can help you. If you don't have it then
from the roundabout to where you are sleep
ing, seven thousand...Some of them never
covered P7 even P5." Henry had made it
through S3 he told me, before he ran out of
money to pay the fees. I was impressed that
he was even able to make it that far as he is
one of 20 children by his father's four wives.
Uganda follows the British model of
school systems with primary and secondary
schools instead of elementary middle and
high schools. Primary goes through grades 1-
7 (Pl-P7), Secondary goes Sl-S4 which is
ordinary levels, (O levels) or more general
classes and then in S5-S6 students take what
are called A levels where they specialize in a
few areas and from there go to university
with admission based almost solely on how
high their scores on A level tests are. In the
university here (modeled after the British
system), you take one subject (e.g. mass com
munication or engineering for three years
without any broad general requirements).

I asked "how much"
somewhat sarcastically,
expecting a ridiculous charge
that would shortly be
followed by my rejection.

"I missed the chances of schooling so the
only chance I have now is to get friends,"
Henry said. "It is better to get a friend who is
going to help you...as we are together now."
Describing the attitude of most other dri
vers he tried to translate what he said was a
proverb in his language. "You don't know
whether you'll eat or not tomorrow so it is
better to eat today." Meaning that if the
other drivers saw a white person they would
try and charge an exorbitant amount on the
chance that it might be paid.
Because he was honest and I ended up hir
ing Henry as a tour guide for two days; he
made far more money than the seven thou
sand the first too drivers might have gotten if
I hadn't known better. 1 paid him what I
decided was appropriate for such a good tour,
