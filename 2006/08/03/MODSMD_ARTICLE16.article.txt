The Boda Boda
Boda boda are the Ã¼biquitous cyclists that are for hire as personal transportation.
They are like makeshift taxis in the sense that one pays to go from one place to anoth
er. The vehicles, which are actually called taxis here, are actually small fourteen person
minibuses called matatu that run along certain routes with no schedule and pack as
many people in as they can. You get on and hop off as close as you can to where you
are going, but they won't go out of their way on your behalf.
Boda boda can take the form of bicycles, scooters or motorcycles. More popular
than taking taxis or even driving cars, they can skirt in between cars stuck in the con
stant painful traffic jams and deliver you directly from one destination to another. They
are more dangerous because the rider is fairly unprotected from other cars and more
likely to take as spill because of potholes. (Peace Corps workers are forbidden from
riding on them at pain of being sent home.) There is also some paranoia about being
robbed by the boda boda drivers who reportedly might take a confused white person
off to a dark alley, but the occurrences are extremely small, and in fact, it is the boda
boda drivers themselves who are more often robbed by their fares, losing the cash they
are carrying or sometimes even their bikes.
