## Israel-Lebanon conflict stirs local tension, response From Stanford's West to the Middle East, divided students talk about peace while armed conflict expands and locals mobilize 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Bombs began falling as rising sophomore
Georgina Blackett studied at the American
University of Beirut (AUB) and its Center
for Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies
(CAMES), July 12.
Caught in the midst of a large, interna
tional conflict, Blackett was fortunately
unhurt, and July 14, with a "relatively calm"
evacuation that was "without event," she left
Lebanon.
"The worst part was deciding to leave,"
Blackett said. "No one thought Israel would
go as far as they went in the destruction of
Lebanon, and Beirut especially. I wanted to
stay to finish my program, to maintain the
sense of normalcy that my teachers were try
ing to uphold."
On July 12, Hezbollah captured two
Israeli soldiers and killed three. Israel
responded with bombing raids in Lebanon,
an air and naval blockade, and small ground
action, resulting in Hezbollah's rocket bom
bardment of Israel. Hundreds of largely
Lebanese civilians have also been killed since
the ongoing conflict began.
As the violent battle increases in Israel
and Lebanon, and Blackett witnesses the
developing news from her two-week home,

student groups have begun to speak out on
both sides of the issue, championing both
political and humanitarian causes.
Stanford students have formed a group,
Light for Lebanon, in response to the situa
tion. The group is comprised of the Lebanese
Student Association at Stanford, Coalition
for Justice in the Middle East, the
Organization of Arab Students in Stanford,
the Islamic Society of Stanford University,
the Muslim Student Awareness Network
(MS AN) and Stanford Amnesty
International.
"Light for Lebanon believes that every
human life is sacred," said rising senior Tala
A 1 Rahami, co-president of Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East. "Over 400
Lebanese civilians have already been killed.
The situation is worse than people expect
and yet, many people sit still and are
unmoved. We believe there must be a cease
fire in order to make sure that no more lives
are lost. We believe that violence doesn't jus
tify violence and that violence can never cre
ate peace."
Light for Lebanon sponsored a protest in
San Francisco and began donation drives.
The organization also held two vigils in Palo
Alto for the victims, each drawing several
hundred people.
"We had a projection of people who had

died and different issues pertinent to the cri
sis," said graduated senior Mohammad
Subeh, Islamic Society president and former
MSAN president. "We used the candles to
create a shape of a cedar tree, which is a sym
bol in Lebanon. A lot of children were there,
holding up signs. We had more speakers this
week, and four children who had just recent
ly returned to the Bay Area, who shared their
thoughts and their experiences."
Jewish student groups have also respond
ed to the attacks, taking a different stance.
Hillel has sponsored a national petition that's
made its way to Stanford students, which
encourages UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to support what it calls Israel's right
to defend itself against Hezbollah.
Jon Katz, Senior Jewish Campus Service
Corps Fellow with Hillel, said that he hoped
Hillel would respond to the attacks by foster
ing dialogue about the situation on campus.
"In this difficult time, Hillel at Stanford is
working to provide Stanford students with
opportunities to come together and discuss
these complex issues," he said.
Rising sophomore and member of the
Jewish Leadership Council Amie Baron has
been working as an intern with the Haas
Fund's Jewish Life Program, which seeks to
bridge Bay-Area Jewish and Muslim popula
tions.
"I've been extensively researching exist
ing and emerging opportunities for construc
tive dialogue between these two groups," she
said. "With the tragic surge of violence in the

Middle East, I believe that exploring means
for collaboration is extremely timely and
essential."
Baron said that the Jewish community on
campus has been meeting both formally and
informally to understand the conflict and dis
cuss a response, "recognizing that Israel's
existence and security is essential to the
Jewish community, [as well as] that hate is
unfortunately rampant in the Middle East
and stands as a solid road block to peace, and
that both Israel and Lebanon are now home
to hundreds of thousands of Jewish and Arab
refugees." Many students in the Stanford
community, she said, are deeply troubled and
personally affected by the violence.
Light for Lebanon and the groups behind
it also hope to develop more dialogue in the
coming year.
"Some of the plans are still in formation,
but mostly this summer there's been a lot of
efforts to directly deal with the short-term fix
like fundraising, raising awareness and call
ing for a cease fire," said Omar Shakir, last
year's MSAN president. "But concerned stu
dents are starting to form coalitions about
longer-term ways we can raise awareness
about issues at Stanford. This will be a huge
issue throughout the year. Some students
have emailed us just outraged about the situ
ation, and we're looking beyond band-aid sit
uations like fundraisers to prevent this kind
of aggression from happening again."
As Light for Lebanon organizations and
Jewish student groups gear into action, diver

gent views about the nature of the conflict
have emerged on campus. Rising senior David
Cohen, board member of the Stanford Israel
Alliance noted that though the organization
does not take stances on Israeli policy; he per
sonally believes Israel must defeat Hezbollah.
"Unfortunately, fighting a war means there
will be civilian casualties, especially against
forces like Hezbollah that use human shields,
launch rockets from next to people's houses,
etc.," he said. "If the rest of the world will not
let Israel defend itself against de-occupied
areas for that reason, it will be very difficult for
Israel to ever withdraw from more territory."
Katz also agreed with Israel's decision.
"Like any sovereign nation, Israel has a
right and duty to defend itself to maintain the
safety and security of its citizens, whether
they be Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or of any
other religion, race or culture, so that those
citizens do not have to live in fear of threats
from Hezbollah across the border," Katz said.
However, he also mentioned his sadness
over the "tragic loss of civilian lives on both
sides of this conflict."
Shakir, on the other hand, raised concern
against U.S. financial and military support of
Israel.
"We as Americans are directly responsi
ble, and we as American students here at
Stanford are very concerned that our govern
ment is tied behind this," he said. "As citizens
of this country, we don't want our name asso
ciated with the terrorism that's happening."
Professor Hilton Obenzinger, associate

director for Honors and Advanced Writing
at the Stanford Writing Center, spoke at one
of the Light for Lebanon vigils and con
demned what he called "a brutal, stupid
war" that was actually part of American for
eign policy.
"Israel says Lebanon needs to enforce
United Nations resolutions to disarm
Hezbollah," he said. "It's laughable for Israel

to speak about enforcing U.N. resolutions
when it regularly ignores any pertaining to
the Palestinians."
The crisis holds a personal connection for
many Stanford students, including those
from the region.
"I, as an Israeli, feel very bad that Lebanon
citizens die, and I blame Hezbollah for using
the innocent people as a shield," said Haim
Permuter, a PhD student in Electrical
Engineering from Israel. "Why do they hide in
buildings with people? Why do they fire rock

ets that are only used for hitting civilians from
villages and from their bases? Hezbollah has
no responsibility for those people. They are
just a terror organization that benefits from
the killing of people. As stated, it is a very sad
story both for Israel and Lebanon."
Other students, like Blackett, are facing
the crisis of the attacks in person. PhD stu
dent in Electrical Engineering Mohamad

"We're looking beyond band-aid
situations like fundraisers to
prevent this kind of aggression
from happening again. ,,

Charafeddine, a Light for Lebanon organizer
and president of the Lebanese Student
Association in Stanford and Organization of
Arab Students in Stanford for the 2005-06
year, commended the Bechtel International
Center for emailing students to make sure
they and their families were safe, including
one student he knew who was unable to
return to campus for an internship because of
the bombings.

Subeh said Light for Lebanon is working
to support such students.
"We have some Lebanese students who
are back home, and we've been in contact

with them to see how we can help them," he
said. "We've also saved an access point to
Stanford students who are overseas in that
area [in order] to see how the University can
help using its own resources."
After leaving, Blackett has kept in touch
with the CAMES faculty and is currently
working on fundraising for the AUB
Hospital's Volunteer Relief Group to help
displaced victims.

"Besides trying to get people to donate to
AUB, talking and writing to people about my
time in Beirut has been my most important
contribution to the relief efforts," she said. "I
do think it's important for people to hear
about it. Everything on the news here is so
different from how I saw the events, how the
rest of the world sees the events in Lebanon,
that I almost can't believe it. I feel like I'm
dreaming sometimes."
