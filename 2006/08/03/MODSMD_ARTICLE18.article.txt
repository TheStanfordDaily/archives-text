## PRO TENNIS Clijsters Triumphs at Taube Defending U.S. Open champion wins the Bank of the West Classic 
### DREW BYWATER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Women's Tennis Association made its
usual summer stop in Stanford last week. The
first Bank of the West Classic took place 36
years ago, and since then the WTA has made
Stanford a regular stop in the build up to
September's U.S. Open in New York City. In
its prestigious 36th year, the Bank of the West
Classic has become the longest running
women's only tournament on the tour. Rarely
in its 36 years has the tournament had as much
heated play as this year's.
A strong showing in the early rounds by
unseeded players helped raise the level of play
on the court. But temperature readings were
rising alongside the heated competition. The
courts and its players were at the mercy of
Mother Nature as California experienced a
record breaking heat wave. The early round
temperatures hit high and above the 100
degree mark. Accompanying the high temper
atures in the early rounds were some big
upsets. Just the second day of play saw the
departure of fifth seeded Daniela Hantuchova
at the hands of unseeded tournament-qualifier
Shenay Perry.
While the early rounds may have been at

the mercy of Mother Nature, the latter rounds
were at the mercy of the two highest ranked
players, as Kim Clijsters (1) and Patty
Schnyder (2) easily maneuvered their way into
the championship match. Clijsters almost stum
bled early on in her opening round match
against Jelena Jankovich, dropping the first set
5-7. Clijsters quickly adjusted herself, however,
and rolled into the finals of her first hard-court
tournament in months. Schnyder pounded her
way to the final round without dropping a set,
but proved no match for the returning champi
on. Clijsters clinched her fourth Bank of the
West Classic Championship on Sunday after

noon, finishing off Schnyder in under an hour;
6-4,6-2.
Like the singles bracket, the doubles brack
et was a show of dominance. The team of
Anna-Lena Groenefeld and Shahar Peer also
made quick work of their competitors. Their
only scare came during a tiebreaker in the semi
final round, but they triumphed in the tiebreak
er to win the match. The victory catapulted
them into Sunday's doubles final where they
faced the fourth ranked team of Maria Elena
Camerin and Gisela Dulko. Groenefeld and
Shahar quickly and decisively finished the dou
bles tournament with a 6-1,6-4 victory.
