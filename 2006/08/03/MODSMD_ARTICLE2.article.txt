## UNIVERSITY FACILITIES Band Shak vandalized University starts investigation, believes Band members involved 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It may not be "All Right Now"
for members of the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
.The Band Shak at Serra Street and
Arguello Way was vandalized
sometime between the evening of
July 17 and the early morning of
July 18. The incident was reported
to the Stanford police, who are con
ducting a criminal investigation into
the matter. Initial estimates of the
damage to the building are between
$30,000 and $50,000.
"It is believed that members of
the Stanford Band may have been
involved in the acts of vandalism,"
said Alan Acosta, the director of
University communications. "The
University has initiated an investi
gation to determine whether there
have been possible violations of the
Fundamental Standard and other
University policies. The University
takes these actions with the utmost
seriousness and as a result has
placed the band on suspension
pending the outcome of this investi
gation. The suspension encompass
es all Band activities including prac
tices, rehearsals, performances,
meetings and any other Band-affili
ated events and activities, as well as
access to any Band facilities."
During the first two weeks of
July, the Band moved from its tem
porary home since 2002 — a trailer
near Encina Hall and the Serra
Complex— to the music ensem
ble's third Band Shak, housed in the
former DeGuerre Squash Courts.
The old Shak, which sources said
some band members believed was
to be taken down by administration,

had tiles removed, its piano disas
sembled, holes put in walls, several
windows broken and the interior
partially spray painted.
Since the police investigation is
ongoing, Band Manager Michael
Priest declined to answer questions
related to the damages to the Band
Shak.
"The Band is very upset that
their old facility was damaged and is
working hard to ensure that similar

damage does not take place in the
Band's new facility," Priest said.
The Band recently moved into
the former DeGuerre Squash
Courts, which will now serve as the
musicians' third Band Shak. The
new Shak was funded by over 500
Band and Stanford alumni who
raised over $2,800,000 for the per
manent, state-of-the-art facility.
"We are very grateful for our
alumni's enthusiasm and support in

helping us make a successful move
into our new home," Priest said.
Due to the confidentiality of the
investigative process concerning
the Band Shak on Galvez Street,
no additional information was
available at time of press. A
University decision is expected for
Friday. For further updates, as they
