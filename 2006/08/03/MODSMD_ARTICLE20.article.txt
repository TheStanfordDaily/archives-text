# Edwards's Time to Shine
## 
### 
Dear Trent,
It's time. You've already had a
career's worth of football on the
Farm, competing from your earliest
days. You've had your ups and downs,
from spectacular work against Navy
and Washington State to the doldrums
of the early days, and four offensive
coordinators in as many years.
You played through a battle to win
your job in the spring of 2005, and held
on for an exciting but ultimately disap
pointing autumn.
The unseasoned outsider might
look at your ledger and see a high
school All-Star who couldn't quite
grow into a complete college player —
with flashes of brilliance in between
struggles — and point out your mad
dening tendency for injuries, especial
ly when the team needed you the most.
Indeed, I will admit to having been
susceptible to that line of thinking. But
that all changed when I attended a
spring practice. I saw you call the team
to attention during stretches, and saw
them heed. The conclusion was obvi
ous to anyone watching — you are
their leader. That comes with responsi
bility; it's a leader's job to keep the
men focused on the goal.
That goal, at the least, is a bowl
game. At most, it's the instillment of
the attitude that this program is back.
You are also, as evidenced by the
billboard facing El Camino and the
ticket brochures, the face of Stanford
football to the Bay Area public and
the Pac-10 at large. Kids are wearing
your number on their jerseys. You
have one year to prove the critics
wrong.
In a conference stacked with offen
sive talents, you fit right in. You were
just as well-regarded as a recruit as
Ben Olson (UCLA) or the guys at
Oregon or Arizona State. You've got
way more big-time experience than
whoever USC is going to put under
center this fall, and let's just say you
don't have to worry about any com
parisons to Washington's under
whelming Isaiah Stanback.
With coach Walt Harris settling
into his second season and the new sta
dium getting its final polish, the table
is set. The future of Cardinal football
is now. And it needs you.
Go get 'em.

Christopher P. Anderson will be doing
play-by-play for KZSU 90.1 FM's cov
erage of Stanford football this fall.
