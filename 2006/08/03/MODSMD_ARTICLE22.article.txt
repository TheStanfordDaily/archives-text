## Mideast War, now in fourth week, shows no signs of ending

Hezbollah fired its biggest and deepest volley
of rockets into Israel on Wednesday as Israel
pursued the guerrillas with 8,000 soldiers on
the ground and heavy bombing. With fighting
in its fourth week and diplomatic efforts
stalled, the region braced for a bitter and long
war.
In eastern Lebanon, villagers wept as
heavy machinery carried off the bodies of
those killed in an overnight raid against a
Hezbollah stronghold. Across northern
Israel, forests and fields lay scorched from
rocket tire that killed a Massachusetts native
fleeing on his bicycle after a warning siren
went off.
Hopes for a cease-fire dimmed despite a
plea from Pope Benedict XVI for a quick
solution. U.N. diplomats debated a draft res
olution that would lay down the conditions
for an international force to go in; they
claimed they were making progress but
acknowledged no immediate deal was in
sight.

The prospect of a longer war has raised
tensions across the Mideast, where anti-
Israeli and anti-American hostility is now
sharp. Arab leaders have warned repeatedly
in recent days that the fighting has hampered,
or killed outright, any hope for a long-term
Israeli peace deal.
But Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
said his country would stop its offensive only
after a robust international peacekeeping
force is in place in southern Lebanon _ some
thing likely to take weeks at minimum. He
predicted the fighting would create "new
momentum" for Israel's plan to separate
from the Palestinians by pulling out of the
West Bank.
Early Thursday, Israel renewed air strikes
against Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut's
outskirts and in the eastern Bekaa Valley.
Witnesses said at least four explosions rever
berated through Beirut as missiles hit
Dahieh, a Shiite Muslim suburb that has been
repeatedly shelled by Israel.
Lebanese television said the attacks targeted
several buildings in a Hezbollah compound of
Dahieh's al-Ruweis neighborhood. The com
pound, which includes a center for religious

teaching, has been attacked in earlier raids
and sustained heavy damage.
It was the first air raid against the
Lebanese capital's suburb in almost a week.
Hezbollah said Thursday that its guerrillas had
also clashed with Israeli troops in the Lebanese
border village of Taibeh, destroying one tank
and two bulldozers and killing or wounding its
crew members, the group's Al-Manar televi
sion reported. The Israeli army said a tank had
been lightly hit in clashes but that there were
no casualties or serious damage.
On Wednesday, the first full day of its
massive ground push, Israeli military officials
said Hezbollah was putting up resistance as
troops went from village to village in south
Lebanon to clear them of guerrillas.
But the officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity because they were not authorized
to talk to the media, said they were confident
the resistance would not change their objec
tive of reaching roughly four miles into
Lebanon by Thursday. They said they could
easily dash inland to the Litani River — their
final objective about 18 miles from the border
— but instead chose to move methodically so
as not to leave pockets of resistance.
