"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky
Bobby" is about a simple-minded, wild-dri

ving NASCAR racer who loves
America — but not as much as he
loves his corporate sponsors, as any
good driver would. He lives in a
cookie-cutter home in a housing
development in a city somewhere in
the south, and his idea ot' fine dining is a
meal out at the local Appleby's. Over

the course of the movie, Bobby (Will
Ferrell) has to learn how to overcome his
American arrogance pnd find some self
reliance, with the help of a deadbeat father
(Gary Cole) and a wild cougar.
Sound familiar? Ferrell co-wrote the film
with "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron
Burgundy" collaborator Adam McKay, a
buddy from Saturday Night Live. Both films

follow the life of a guy who's too big of a suc
cess to notice that his friends don't really like
him, and that he's not really as good as he
thought he was. Instead of the newsroom, this
time the pair riffs on vaguely middle-
American stereotypes: KFC and Domino's is
Mrs. Bobby's (Leslie Bibb) idea of a nice fam
ily dinner, and the Bobby kids are affection
ately named Walker and Texas Ranger.

The redemption plotline follows in the tracks of
the much-loved "Anchorman," but does the

tried-and-true storyline hold your interest long
enough for Ferrell and Co. to get some laughs in?
I think it does. This movie spends more time

with Bobby when he's down and out, following him
through the backwoods town that he grew up in. And
for all his American bravado.

'Talladega Nights:
The Ballad of Ricky Bobby'
Dir. Adam McKay

this character's actually likeable (and gullible) enough to
make his climb back to the top enjoyable to watch. The
film also delivers its share of quotable one-liners, but
unlike Burgundy, Bobby is a character you can actually
root for.
The NASCAR storyline may be little more than a set
piece, but it is a convincing one. For true racing fans, the
film also includes a few sequences of nicely-shot racing
action and, of course, stupendous car crashes.
Sacha Baron Cohen plays the cocksure Bobby's arch-

"You need to ride that
line between fear and
chaos, and you need
to ride it like a cobra."

Nemesis — a rival driver named Jean Girard
who is both French and gay, smoking ciga
rettes and reading Camus' The Stranger
while he drives his green Perrier car.
Bobby decides to become a race
car driver when his absentee dad shows up
for Bring Your Dad to School Day and
says the words that Bobby will live by: "If
you ain't first, you're last." Bobby starts
working in a pit crew with best friend Cal
Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly), and jumps

behind the wheel when the car's driver bails
out in the middle of a race to run across the
street for some fries.

Bobby climbs to the top of the
NASCAR circuit with the help of
Naughton, who is also given a spot on the

team — why not? Things turn sour, how
ever, when the owner hires Girard to
become the team's lead driver. Bobby
tries to use his swing-from-the-heels atti
tude to overcome Girard, but ends up
wrecking his car and losing his confi
dence. Defeated, he goes back to his
hometown to learn how to find himself

— and to prepare for the big final race
at Talladega.
The material here will be pretty famil
iar to anyone who's spent part of a
Sunday watching cars zip around their
television set, but Ferrell and crew have
definitely figured out what's funny about
NASCAR — the sponsor stickers plas

tered over every car, the fact that most
races seem to end in 20-car pileups and

that every driver seems to be named Ricky
or Bobby or Jeff. Most of the time, Ferrell

lets the jokes make themselves. As in every
movie that he produces, the real fun starts
when the actors are allowed to mess around

within the formulaic set-up. There wasn't quite
enough of that in "Talladega Nights" — there's

no Blue or Brick here, and it's too bad that they
didn't give Baron Cohen more than a few choice

one-liners. The trade-off, perhaps, is that the story
holds up better. As a result, "Talladega Nights" feels

a bit more like a complete film than Ferrell's previous
movies, which tend to unravel into an increasingly wild

(if still very funny) series of self-parodic episodes.
Ferrell's meat and potatoes may still be random jokes,
hut this time he does a better job setting the table.

THAT JUST HAPPENED: No longer trapped in a glass case of emotion, Will Ferrell is up to his
usual goofball antics in Talladega Nights."
