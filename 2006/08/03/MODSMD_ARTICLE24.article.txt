# REVIEW & INTERVIEW
## 'Little Miss Sunshine' helps you find yourself 
### TAM VO LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE TAM VO LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE 
In poetry workshops at Stanford, the
teachers (Jones Lecturers or Stegner
Fellows, both types fabulously witty and
snarky and wise all at the same time)
always tell the students, "Show, don't
tell" or "Show us by telling."
I guess this is just to say that I am not
going to tell you what kind of movie
"Little Miss Sunshine" is, but to let it
speak for itself. It doesn't just speak, it
dances and strips to Rick James's
"Superfreak," pushes itself along with the
help of six very neurotic, very real and
loveable characters, winning your heart
over because it doesn't ask for it. It tells
you not to cry for Argentina (Suck it,
"Evita"), it begs you not to speak (some
times I secretly wish I were Helen Keller
or Nietzsche) and ultimately drives away
from you because it's got places to go and
people to see (insert "Lovefool" by the
Cardigans and "Can't Get No
Satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones, in the
Jackson Pollock-esque mess that is my
mind).
"Little Miss Sunshine" changed my
life, because it made me realize that even
if my BA from Stanford in
English/Creative Writing seems useless
to some people, it's all I've got and I'm
sticking to it. Have integrity in what you
do, and believe in it. If you do, it will be
infectious, more so than avian bird flu or
SARS. Seriously.

At the end of the day, if all of the power went
out, all we would be left with are words (think
Sean Connery on SNL's Celebrity Jeopardy and

"The Penis Mightier than
the Sword"). "Little Miss
Sunshine" weaves words
into the scenes, the dialogue,
the sound and the story.
Words evoke the characters
and their personalities and
relationships and journeys
together in a bright yellow
old-school VW van.
It's real life, and for once,
real life isn't so bad because

we're all in this together (listen to Ben Lee's "Sleep
is the New Awake" if you don't believe me). It
made me realize that I wasn't alone in feeling
"Garden State" was a manipulative film despite its
good intentions, in the way a Shins song would oh
so-conveniently play over the forced, trite dialogue

'Little Miss Sunshine'
Dirs. Jonathan Dayton &
Valerie Faris

between Zach Braff and Natalie Portman. For
God's sake, Natalie Portman is NOT the girl next
door, okay? She's Natalie f-ing Portman! She's a
Star Wars action figure!
I'm pretty sure Simon & Garfunkel would be

proud (remember "The
Graduate" and its seminal use of
musical refrains?) because
Mychael Danna and Devotchka
created a musical score that melts
into the screen and sound.
There's no annoying product
placement, things are so generic
they become accessible to you,
the audience. You could be in this
film. It is a film about you and
your family; you just had no idea

such a thing could exist until you stepped into the
theater.
You are Olive (a plucky Abigail Breslin, who
could totally beat up Dakota Fanning), giddy

For those of you born after 1980, you prob
ably didn't get to see MTV until at least the 4th
season of "The Real World." For those of you
born in the '90s, I'm sorry. All you get now is
"My Super Sweet Sixteen" and "Date My
Mont." Directors Valerie Dayton and Jonathan
Faris are responsible for the seminal MTV
music show (unreal, I know) called "The
Cutting Edge." They're badass pioneers and
partners in the world of music and music
videos, so listen up! Oh yeah, they're also mar
ried with three kids and are totally cooler than
your parents.
DISCLAIMER: I like to have conversations
with the people I interview, because 1 already
know they do their jobs damn well. I, on the
other hand, might as well be interviewed,
because I need a full-time job (401 k and den
tal? I'm yours).

ENTERTAINMENT: I was struck by
the fact that there weren't any annoying
Coca-Cola ads or anything in the film.
In fact, one of the only brands that real
ly popped out was the iconic
Volkswagen school bus yellow van.
How did you refrain from product
placement to get this movie made?
Better yet, how did you prevent pop
idols and MTV2 indie rock bands from
taking over the movie soundtrack?
VALERIE FARIS: We hate pop songs
dropped into movies. It's like using the
pop song, and to me, it just feels like the
movie doesn't have the strength to hold
up on its own, so we've always been
pretty down on that phenomenon. So
we love movie scores and even though
we were interested in the idea of having
a band or a pop feeling/sensibility for
soundtrack, we really wanted them to
write music that would have presence
for the movie, not carry the content. Or
when a song comes in and tells you
what you're feeling or what is happen
ing, as if you don't know otherwise.
JONATHAN DAYTON: We love
films like "Harold and "Maude" and
"The Graduate," all movies that used
one artist to score the whole movie. We
want the artist as a movie, up and front
and part of the film.

ENT: Speaking of that phenomenon,
how did you feel about "Garden State" and its
use of soundtrack?
VF: I probably shouldn't say too much about
it, but I was surprised. I kind of felt late
because we'd heard all the hubbub about it but
hadn't seen it until much later. The music was
such a powerful force in the movie, but it felt
like it was relying too much on the music to
give it a feeling. 1 wasn't blown away.
ENT: Finally, someone besides me and my
best friend who doesn't love "Garden State." I
thought we were the only two people left in the
world who weren't "moved" by Natalie
Portman's impression of a retarded kid. Can
you adopt me?
JD: I was not as enthusiastic about it.

WELCOME TO HELL: If this looks like your family, you may want to take them all to see "Little Miss Sunshine."
Then again, a trip to a therapist wouldn't hurt either.
