# REVIEW & INTERVIEW
## 'Little Miss Sunshine' helps you find yourself 
### TAM VO LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE TAM VO LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE 
In poetry workshops at Stanford, the
teachers (Jones Lecturers or Stegner
Fellows, both types fabulously witty and
snarky and wise all at the same time)
always tell the students, "Show, don't
tell" or "Show us by telling."
I guess this is just to say that I am not
going to tell you what kind of movie
"Little Miss Sunshine" is, but to let it
speak for itself. It doesn't just speak, it
dances and strips to Rick James's
"Superfreak," pushes itself along with the
help of six very neurotic, very real and
loveable characters, winning your heart
over because it doesn't ask for it. It tells
you not to cry for Argentina (Suck it,
"Evita"), it begs you not to speak (some
times I secretly wish I were Helen Keller
or Nietzsche) and ultimately drives away
from you because it's got places to go and
people to see (insert "Lovefool" by the
Cardigans and "Can't Get No
Satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones, in the
Jackson Pollock-esque mess that is my
mind).
"Little Miss Sunshine" changed my
life, because it made me realize that even
if my BA from Stanford in
English/Creative Writing seems useless
to some people, it's all I've got and I'm
sticking to it. Have integrity in what you
do, and believe in it. If you do, it will be
infectious, more so than avian bird flu or
SARS. Seriously.

At the end of the day, if all of the power went
out, all we would be left with are words (think
Sean Connery on SNL's Celebrity Jeopardy and

"The Penis Mightier than
the Sword"). "Little Miss
Sunshine" weaves words
into the scenes, the dialogue,
the sound and the story.
Words evoke the characters
and their personalities and
relationships and journeys
together in a bright yellow
old-school VW van.
It's real life, and for once,
real life isn't so bad because

we're all in this together (listen to Ben Lee's "Sleep
is the New Awake" if you don't believe me). It
made me realize that I wasn't alone in feeling
"Garden State" was a manipulative film despite its
good intentions, in the way a Shins song would oh
so-conveniently play over the forced, trite dialogue

w R w w
'Little Miss Sunshine'
Dirs. Jonathan Dayton &
Valerie Faris

between Zach Braff and Natalie Portman. For
God's sake, Natalie Portman is NOT the girl next
door, okay? She's Natalie f-ing Portman! She's a
Star Wars action figure!
I'm pretty sure Simon & Garfunkel would be

proud (remember "The
Graduate" and its seminal use of
musical refrains?) because
Mychael Danna and Devotchka
created a musical score that melts
into the screen and sound.
There's no annoying product
placement, things are so generic
they become accessible to you,
the audience. You could be in this
film. It is a film about you and
your family; you just had no idea

such a thing could exist until you stepped into the
theater.
You are Olive (a plucky Abigail Breslin, who
could totally beat up Dakota Fanning), giddy

For those of you born after 1980, you prob
ably didn't get to see MTV until at least the 4th
season of "The Real World." For those of you
born in the '90s, I'm sorry. All you get now is
"My Super Sweet Sixteen" and "Date My
Mont." Directors Valerie Dayton and Jonathan
Faris are responsible for the seminal MTV
music show (unreal, I know) called "The
Cutting Edge." They're badass pioneers and
partners in the world of music and music
videos, so listen up! Oh yeah, they're also mar
ried with three kids and are totally cooler than
your parents.
DISCLAIMER: I like to have conversations
with the people I interview, because 1 already
know they do their jobs damn well. I, on the
other hand, might as well be interviewed,
because I need a full-time job (401 k and den
tal? I'm yours).

ENTERTAINMENT: I was struck by
the fact that there weren't any annoying
Coca-Cola ads or anything in the film.
In fact, one of the only brands that real
ly popped out was the iconic
Volkswagen school bus yellow van.
How did you refrain from product
placement to get this movie made?
Better yet, how did you prevent pop
idols and MTV2 indie rock bands from
taking over the movie soundtrack?
VALERIE FARIS: We hate pop songs
dropped into movies. It's like using the
pop song, and to me, it just feels like the
movie doesn't have the strength to hold
up on its own, so we've always been
pretty down on that phenomenon. So
we love movie scores and even though
we were interested in the idea of having
a band or a pop feeling/sensibility for
soundtrack, we really wanted them to
write music that would have presence
for the movie, not carry the content. Or
when a song comes in and tells you
what you're feeling or what is happen
ing, as if you don't know otherwise.
JONATHAN DAYTON: We love
films like "Harold and "Maude" and
"The Graduate," all movies that used
one artist to score the whole movie. We
want the artist as a movie, up and front
and part of the film.

ENT: Speaking of that phenomenon,
how did you feel about "Garden State" and its
use of soundtrack?
VF: I probably shouldn't say too much about
it, but I was surprised. I kind of felt late
because we'd heard all the hubbub about it but
hadn't seen it until much later. The music was
such a powerful force in the movie, but it felt
like it was relying too much on the music to
give it a feeling. 1 wasn't blown away.
ENT: Finally, someone besides me and my
best friend who doesn't love "Garden State." I
thought we were the only two people left in the
world who weren't "moved" by Natalie
Portman's impression of a retarded kid. Can
you adopt me?
JD: I was not as enthusiastic about it.

WELCOME TO HELL: If this looks like your family, you may want to take them all to see "Little Miss Sunshine."
Then again, a trip to a therapist wouldn't hurt either.

ENT: Dear Zach Braff, if you're going for real
ism and poignancy and you cast your dream girl
Natalie Portman, it doesn't work!
JI): I totally agree.
ENT: Are you afraid that "Little Miss
Sunshine" will suffer from "Garden State" syn
drome (i.e., sleeper hit that is made on a low
budget, people fall in love with it at Sundance,
critics and audiences build it up into a huge
commercial success, and it gets marketed,
hyped up, overplayed, parodied, and ultimately
emaciated in meaning)? Because "Little Miss
Sunshine" is the best film I've seen in five years,
and the only one that doesn't make me walk
away wanting to hurt the producers or directors
for taking away from the screenplay. I don't
want that for this film. It's too real.
VF: That's our fear a little bit with our movie; it
came out of Sundance, and got attention for
how much it sold for, which is always kind
0f...y0u know. It didn't matter to us in that way,
we were happy it went to Searchlight [Pictures],
they know how to release a film. I worry people
will come with the attitude of "What is so great
about this?" It's a tough thing to overcome.
ENT: Making "Little Miss Sunshine" wasn't
exactly like producing a Janet Jackson or
Weezer music video — what was it like making
a full length film for the first time?
JI): It's so nice to tell a story, to not worry
about time. In an hour and a half, you can get
deeper with characters.
VF: A good script is a lot like a good piece of
music — it tells you what to do, it leads you. We
really loved the script [written by Michael

Arndt], and all the characters; we were so lucky
to get a cast that just completely filled those roles
and understood the movie the way we saw it.
ENT: The screenplay was written a long time
ago (in terms of Hollywood time, where nobody
has time for anybody), but why did you fight for
it? Why is it that all the doubters/player haters
suddenly kiss your ass when you make the film
you believe in and it wins

everyone over? Weren't
you pissed off?
JI): It's pretty ironic that
for all we went through
that there's suddenly this
rush, as people see it as a
commercial movie, as we
fought for five years, as
people were wondering
how you'd market it.
VF: It was very frustrating.
Lots of things about the
movie that are on paper,
like the script, ideas,
ensemble cast, are very dif
ferent from what
Hollywood is doing.
Everything has to be star
driven today, high concept.
ENT: I guess "Snakes on a
Plane" is star-driven and
like, the bizarre high con

cept. They are on a "motherfuckin' plane"
after all, with Samuel L. Jackson and like
200,000 snakes at really high altitudes.
VF: We like purely character driven stories,
but nobody wants to take a chance with those.
It is pretty funny to have struggled so long to
get it made and to have the same people who
told us it'd never work now bidding on the
film. There's a bit of justice.
ENT: It's the film that makes me more deter
mined to write a novella and screenplay about

my family and about the world outside a fami
ly, because I realized it all comes back to one's
family, even if you run away from them. They
find you, even if it means throwing a Bavarian
cuckoo clock ordered from Heartland
America at you to make a point. Yeah.
[Awkward silence]

JI): I'm glad to hear the
film speaks to you,
because I feel like my
favorite film experiences
came from college and
out of college, just assess
ing what it is that I liked
and what films were
meaningful to me.
Hopefully this will appeal
to a broad range of peo
ple — I really want peo
ple in their teens and 20's
to identify with the film.
ENT: It was the closest I
ever came to truly reading
a film, because it wasn't
adapted from anything. It
came out of nowhere;
Michael Arndt wrote it
because he wrote it and
believed in it, and didn't
use anything but life to
write it and write the char
acters.

VF: The script had an economy about it; it
felt like there was room to wonder about the
characters. They were very well drawn, but
not overly explained, yet they felt like they
had a real life to them. We identified with
nearly all the characters. I could totally
understand Grandpa's point of view, and 1
really identified with the teenage angst of
Duane. At different points, we felt we could
enter each character's experience, their
incredible longings, as each really had a pas
sion for something.

JD: And it seemed to reach outside the con
fines of the immediate story, which you never
see in a film.
VF: Characters so rarely have the longing and
passion of real people, like they're just there to
serve the stories. They lived in our heads for
five years, became very dimensional characters.
By the time we made the movie, they were real.
ENT: "Little Miss Sunshine" speaks to every
one, regardless of if you are white, black,
Mexican, Asian, religious, agnostic, a
Nietszche-lover, an angsty teenager, a beauty
pageant contestant, middle-aged, jobless,
broke, rich, a mother, a bitch, a lover, a fighter,
a coke-snorting senior citizen...yeah.
VF: The most fun part of it for us was to cre
ate a real family. We had a real week of
rehearsing, not only on developing the rela
tionships and the history and the characters, so
when they went to do the scenes, there was
this experience together. So often, actors
come to the set, it's the first day and they have
to figure out how to pretend to be a family.
Our hope was that they could have the experi
ence of each other. I feel the experience is
really the most important thing.
ENT: People separate themselves so often
when they can and should experience some
thing together. And be on the journey with
them is the greatest gift a film can give a view
er. Did you ever have to push the VW van?
JD: Oh yeah we did; we pushed in rehearsals.
VF: It's so fun!
JD: The fun thing about having two directors is
being able to act out our scenes, we just
rehearsed scenes in our garage. Just doing it
very poorly but at least feeling what it was like
to be in some of these situations so that it
wasn't just an intellectual exercise. We came to
it with some experience with what it meant to
be doing these things.

cide (and failed at it) because the grad student you
fell in love with is sleeping with the #2 Proust
Scholar in the World, who's a total douchebag, by
the way. You got fired, and now you have to sleep
on a twin sized bed with your nephew, Nietzsche
loving Dwayne, who talks only with the use of his
notepad, a pen and his hands.
You are you, silting in the theater. You love
your family and maybe you understand them.
Maybe you think you do. Maybe they don't under
stand you. Maybe they are too busy to take time to
understand each other. You care what everyone
thinks. At the same time, you don't give a shit
about what everyone thinks. You want everyone to
be happy, but you hate the happy people. You hate
everyone. You love everyone. You hate yourself,
but you want to be loved. Aren't we all bundles of
contradictions?
Why can't I always be a ray of sunshine?
Because life is complicated, but it is good and it is
bad and it is light and dark and stormy. It's finding
out that both hookers are dead, and then it's like
finding five dollars hidden in your winter coat in
the next minute. We're not misfits, we just have to
fit together to make it through the hard times, the
breakdowns. There's beauty in the breakdown
(Thanks, Imogen Heap and Frou Frou).
Watch "Little Miss Sunshine" because you owe it to
yourself. You owe it to your family, too. Do it for the
people who sacrificed so much to bring this film into
existence, including directors Valerie Faris and
Jonathan Dayton, and especially, especially for
Michael Arndt who wrote this screenplay eons ago
[compared to the monkeys with typewriters who churn
out MadLibbed scripts every day in Hollywood].
Michael Arndt is my new hero. I'm starting a fanclub.
To quote The Decemberists, "I am a writer, a
writer of fictions, I am the heart that you call
home." This film evokes the emotional truth you
have been waiting your whole life to say out loud.
So scream it from the rooftops for me, please. I'm
waiting to hear what you have to say.

over a beauty pageant, hoping to Jesus that you can
have ice cream for breakfast with your wattle and still
win Little Miss Sunshine. You practice your waves
and you smile your smile, and you do your little turn
on the catwalk — in bright red cowboy boots. You
are the only girl in the pageant who doesn't look like
Jonßenet Ramsey.
You are Dwayne (Paul Dano), who might as well
be my middle brother from another mother), angsty
and angry because you think your family is f*cked up
beyond repair and the only way to deal is to take a
vow of silence and read Nietzsche till you get into the
Air Force. Puberty is really, really hard.
You are Sheryl (Toni Collete), the mom who
encourages everyone to be their own person and to
live and let live, but everyone craps on you and
takes you for granted because you have a good
heart and you can't say no. You have to be strong so
no one kills anyone before dinnertime, which con
sists of a bucket of fried chicken.
You are Richard (Greg Kinnear), a dad so
determined to be somebody in the world, to strike
it rich with your big ideas, to be a WINNER, not a
LOSER. But you are a loser, because you think
you're one until someone else declares you a WIN
NER. And that validation is not coming...ever.
Also, all your kids have to be WINNERS, because
you didn't raise no losers, nuh-uh.
You are Grandpa (Alan Arkin), a hippie-bohemi
an senior citizen who snorts cocaine hidden in a fan
nypack and has the mentality of a 15-year-old who
just discovered Playboys and the joys of having a
penis. You don't give a shit what anyone else thinks
and wish your family would do the same.
You are Frank (Steve Carrell), the #1 Proust
