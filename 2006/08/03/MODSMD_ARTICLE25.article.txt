## 'The Night Listener' is all ears Brevity shortens the emotional impact of this thriller's source material

Armistead Maupin's novel "The Night
Listener," upon which this film is based, was
heavily inspired by the film "Vertigo." The
San Francisco author saw the film when he was
15 years old and cites it as a major influence. I
mention this because I was lucky enough to
attend a screening of "Vertigo" at the Stanford
Theater a few hours after seeing "The Night
Listener." Seeing these two films together
really accentuates the problems in director
Patrick Stettner's adaptation of Maupin's
novel. While Hitchcock's film takes its time
meticulously developing its plot and charac
ters, Stettner's film moves like it's on a dead
line. And in doing so, it strips away a lot of the
book's emotional content.
"The Night Listener" revolves around gay
writer and popular late-night radio show host,
Gabriel Noone (Robin Williams). Not long
after the demise of a ten-year relationship,
Gabriel is handed a manuscript written by a
thirteen year-old boy named Pete (Rory
Culkin). In the novel, Pete recounts a terrible
history of sexual and emotional abuse.
Fascinated by the author's precociousness,
Gabriel enters into an intense phone relation
ship with Pete and his adopted mother (Toni
Collette). However, when Gabriel's former
lover, Jess, suggests that mother and son share
the same voice, the aging radio show host
begins to doubt the authorship of the novel and
whether Pete even exists.

As with many adaptations, avid fans of the
book will have a lot to complain about here.
While the film doesn't exactly ignore Gabriel's
homosexuality, it certainly doesn't embrace it
either. The details of Gabriel's sex life with
Jess, with a partial explanation for their break-

up, are ignored.
Gabriel's tumultuous

Southern father, so central to the book's reso
lution, is also excised. His father makes an
appearance near the beginning of the film but

quickly disappears forever. This omission is
particularly strange since it is only through
their relationship that we understand the
import of Gabriel's homosexuality. As it
stands, Gabriel's sexuality seems like nothing
more than a token reference to the book.
A more problematic change lies in the
film's pacing. While Maupin's book develops
Gabriel and Petes' relationship very slowly,
the film seems intent on getting it over with in
10 minutes. This diminishes the credibility of
the second act. Gabriel is clearly disturbed by
the suggestion that Pete doesn't exist but it's
not really clear how such a short, under-devel
oped relationship could have such an impact.
There's something sweet and touching about
the father-son relationship that develops in
the novel but it doesn't come through here.
The movie is in such a rush to get to its twists
and turns that it forgets why it all matters.
All these changes seem motivated by a
desire to make the film tighter and more
focused. But with a running length of 82 min
utes, I suspect the movie would have benefited
from 10 or 20 extra minutes. At least enough
time for Pete's mysterious character to res
onate with the audience.

Nevertheless, the"The Night
Listener" seems to hang togeth
er and this is mainly due to
Robin William's subdued per
formance as Gabriel. Collette is
also effective as Pete's adopted
mother. In emphasizing the
thriller aspects of the novel, the
film's second half borders on
silly. But Williams and Collette
somehow make it credible. The
two leads are certainly capable

of portraying sophisticated human drama. It's a
shame "The Night Listener" doesn't give them
more of a chance.
