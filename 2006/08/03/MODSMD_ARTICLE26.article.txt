# INTERVIEW
## Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' spins its way into 'The Night Listener' 
### 
RYAN LAMPE
ENTERTAINMENT EAVESDROPPER
ENTERTAINMENT: Patrick, your
last movie was "The Business of
Strangers." It's a good movie by the
way...
ARMISTEAD MAUPIN: Isn't it!
I was in-love with that film before I'd
even met Patrick.
ENT: It was compared to "In the
Company of Men." This film is com
pared to Hitchcock and "Misery."
What do you think about that?
PATRICK STETTNER: Those are
good comparisons (laughing).
ENT: It could be Bruckheimer or
somebody!
PS: You could have picked Michael
Bay! And then I would have had a
problem (laughing). I will take
Hitchcock.
ENT: Armistead, I heard an inter
view in which you said that you were
heavily influenced by "Vertigo"
when writing this book. How is
"Vertigo" in this film?
AM: There are a number of charac
ters that I simply regarded as some
of the prototypes in "Vertigo." I
mean, I needed them in the course of
telling the novel. Somebody had to
set the thing up, to send the hero on
his confused way. And the charac

ter of Ashe Findlay, played by Joe
Morton in the film, is sort of the
Gavin Elster of "Vertigo." The man
who invites Jimmy Stewart to come
to his office and explains what's
going on. I always looked at Sandra
Oh as the Barbara Bel Geddes char
acter. But I wasn't trying to do
"Vertigo." It was just there.
PS: But it's also about somebody
who believes so strongly in love
that...
AM: His obsessions will take him to
the point where they are willing to
believe a myth if necessary in order
to feel fulfilled.
ENT: I don't know whether you'll
agree with me here but I think Robin
Williams is a good comedian but he's
better in dramas like in "Good Will
Hunting." "Dead Poet's Society" -
he was just terrific in that.
PS: I think those are two instances
when he can be really great. Listen,
first of all, as a director you feel as
though you're almost mining his sec
ond talent because he is a brilliant
comedian and it's not something
that's an affectation or this crying for
need. His brain works in a certain
way and you'd find him before 4
o'clock in the morning with the sec
ond grip just telling jokes and riffing
on ideas like a jazz musician.
AM: The interesting thing is that
"RV" and the usual Hollywood com

edy vehicles don't capture to any
degree what he knows how to do.
When you watch him in stand-up or,
as you say, just standing on the street
at 4 o'clock in the morning, you see
the brilliance of it. But I do have
huge admiration for him as a dramat
ic actor. It was Patrick that said at
one point that Robin can convince
you that he's someone who can love
too much and that was necessary for
the character.
PS: I think many of us wouldn't go to
Wisconsin [from New York] but you

really needed someone who really
cared, who really loved, who had too
big of a heart, and you get that with
Robin. It was interesting that while
we were working together, it was very
easy to identify the things that made
him no longer the character but made
him Robin Williams. It had some
thing to do with his voice, an imitation
or when he gets on his heels and we're
like "Wow, you can't do that!" and
then, it's funny, he starts to recognize
it himself.
ENT: Patrick, I notice there are sim

ilarities with "The Business of
Strangers." You are quoted as say
ing you "enjoy the truth of people
who tell lies." What does this
mean?
PS: In drama, when someone just says
a truth, it's less interesting to me than
someone telling a lie and then discov
ering a truth within that lie...
AM: It's more revealing.
PS: It's more revealing and it's more
of a hit for them than someone just
saying "Oh, you're this kind of per
son." You almost say the opposite
and then you arrive at a different
kind of truth and it just becomes an
active way for the audience to partic
ipate in that character's journey of
self-understanding. I find that really
kind of important...that you make the
audience work with the character
while seeing the film.
ENT: So you premiered the movie at
Sundance in January. What has hap
pened to the film since then? I
understand it's shorter.
PS: Yes, it is shorter by about eight or
nine minutes. I did a lot. You
know, it's this unfortunate experi
ence of showing the film at Sundance
and going "Oh shit!"
AM: Well, that's brutally honest!

CREEPY: Robin Williams is such a good actor that he can play a lovable
family man AND a creepy family killing man.
