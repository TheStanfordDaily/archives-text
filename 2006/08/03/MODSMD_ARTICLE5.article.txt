Knight donates
record $105 million
to School of Business
Nike Inc. Founder and Chairman Philip Knight
(MBA '62) announced Tuesday he will be donating
$105 million to the Graduate School of Business. The
gift, believed to be the largest ever given to a business
school, will primarily go toward a new $275 million
campus being built for the school.
The Board of Trustees gave approval to the cam
pus, June 15, which will have eight buildings around
three quadrangles. The school plans to break ground
by 2008, once the necessary balance of funds has been
collected, with completion expected by 2010 or 2011.
Knight's donation comes just weeks after the
approval of changes to the School of Business cur
riculum. Beginning in fall 2007, the school will have
a more individualized approach to students, as well
as more classes, which the new Knight Management
Center will facilitate. To be built at 651 Serra St.,
across from the Schwab Residential Center, the
complex will feature a 450-seat auditorium, class
rooms, study rooms, faculty spaces, a dining center
and career management center. It will be 85,000
square feet larger than the current business school
campus.
Also from Knight's donation, $5 million will be
used toward faculty endowment.
"Phil's commitment is the linchpin which will
allow us to create a physical environment to support
new methods of teaching management and leader
ship while also inviting more collaboration from
across Stanford," said Robert Joss, the Philip H.
Knight Professor and dean of the school of business,
in a news release.
Knight said he is excited to give back as the school
he is an alumnus of takes large steps forward.
"Stanford Business School was an important part
of my life," Knight said in a statement. "This is a
once-in-a-lifetime chance to give back to the school
and help it continue to push the boundaries of excel
lence in management education."

Reported violations topped 100 for the first time
in the 2000-01 academic year, with the most recent
