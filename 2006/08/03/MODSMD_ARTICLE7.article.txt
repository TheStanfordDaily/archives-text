## Senator attacks College Board College Board under investigation after SAT scoring errors 
### HUNTER BARNS 
The College Board, the non-profit
organization that administers, scores and
maintains records of the SAT, has recently
come under fire by New York Senator
Kenneth LaValle, chairman of the state
Senate Higher Education Committee.
Trouble began in March, when The
College Board reported that over 4,000
high-school students nationwide received
incorrect scores on the October 2005 SAT
because of a computer glitch allegedly
caused by excessive moisture on answer
sheets. By April, The College Board
reported 4,411 of the 495,000 October test
takers received incorrectly low scores, 83
percent of them off by 40 points or less on
the 2,400-point exam. One score was off by
450 points.
Although The College Board claims
that all students and educational institu

tions were subsequently notified of the
botched exams, and the problem was cor
rected, the organization refused to release
its report on the incident, insisting that the
report was not finalized and that it is
exempt from state law. Representatives
from The College Board also said that an
early release of the report could impact
ongoing lawsuits pertaining to the scoring
errors.
Senator LaValle countered this refusal
by invoking New York's "truth in testing
law," which requires all reports to be
released to the legislature. LaValle issued
subpoenas to College Board executives
including College Board President Gaston
Caperton, a former West Virginia gover
nor.
"Once again The College Board's
approach to problems is to shroud them in
secrecy," Senator LaValle said in a July 13
news release. "Their attitude gives rise to
greater questions as to their true purpose."
The College Board later agreed to
release the final report, which was made
available on its Web site, July 26. Prepared
by Booz Allen Hamilton, an independent
consultant group, the report concludes that
"the current process is reliable and has
prudent controls in place to safeguard

scoring accuracy for those marks made in
accordance with test directions."
The report also points out that further
improvements need to be made in the
"scanning" and "marginal marks" aspects
of test scoring, as failures in these areas
were most accountable for the botched
exams. The complete report is available at
www.collegeboard.com/sat/answersheet
processing/report.
In a press release coinciding with the
release of this report, Caperton said, "The
reason we released it is that some people
assumed we had something to hide. But we
had nothing to hide. Anyone who reads
this report would say it's very comprehen
sive, and that we've gone the extra mile to
make sure this process is as error-free as
possible."
LaValle was still not satisfied, however,
by The College Board's response.
"The board's lack of accountability in
this matter goes to the heart of the arro
gance that exists when an organization
basically holds a monopoly in a certain
market," LaValle said in a statement fol
lowing the release of the report. "This
report still does not answer why such a
large number of testing errors
occurred on the October 2005
SAT. In addition, the board has
not provided an explanation of
why it took several months to
inform over 4,000 students of
inaccurate test scores."
Additionally, The National
Center for Fair and Open Testing
responded to the report by releas
ing a list of questions that the
study did not answer. Among
them: What was the root cause of
the problem? When did The
College Board receive the first
request for hand scoring of the
October SAT? How many weeks
did it take for the board to
respond to that request? When
did The College Board first dis
cover a broad problem? Why was
there a delay between that time
and when test takers and others
were informed of the problem?
In the long run, the report
makes the recommendation of
offering the SAT online as a way
to minimize scoring problems due
to mechanical malfunctions,
though the prospect of an online
SAT raises many security ques
tions. Certainly, the amount of
weight given to SAT scores in col
lege admissions necessitates that
the process be carefully scruti
nized for error.

Although The College Board
insists that the mistakes that led
to last fall's incorrect exams will
be fixed, and the problem was an
isolated incident, the organiza
tion's reputation as a supposedly
non-profit, fair institution has
been damaged by the mistake and
its initial refusal to cooperate
with the Senate Higher
Education Committee.
Moreover, this gives rise to the
question of whether the SAT
should continue to be used in col
lege admissions.
"The SAT is important to col
lege admissions because it repre
sents a universal assessment by
which all applicants can be mea
sured," said rising junior Nima
Ghamsari. "Things like GPA and

letters of recommendation are
important, but they have relative
ly little comparative value for
applicants from different high
schools. At my high school, it was
almost impossible to get above a
4.0, but I've met many students at
Stanford who come from schools
where competitive GPAs are
much higher than 4.0. SAT
scores, in this sense, help colleges
differentiate between applicants
in a much more objective way."
Originally developed after
World War II when returning Gls
applied to colleges in large num
bers, the SAT allowed for admis
sions officers to cut through
stacks of applicants by making
the exam score a considerable
factor in admission criteria.

Subsequently the exam has been
revised several times and many
high-school students take prep
courses that promise to raise an
applicant's score. Stanford cur
rently offers such a course
through its High School Summer
College program.
In spite of the recent contro
versy surrounding College Board,
approximately 2.2 million high
school students are expected to
take the SAT at different times
this fall, and their scores will
largely dictate where they will be
admitted to college.
Dean of Admission and
Financial Aid Richard Shaw gave
assurance of the SAT and its con
tinued use in Stanford undergrad
uate admissions.
"While some candidates were
affected by the misreporting of
test scores, there was no impact in
regard to their admissions deci
sion at Stanford," Shaw said.
"While this glitch in reporting
was unfortunate, the significance
of the error has received far
greater importance in the press
than the actual impact on admis
sions outcomes. We assume the
College Board will make adjust
ment in their quality control and
ensure this will not happen
again."

the exam score a considerable
factor in admission criteria.

Subsequently the exam has been
revised several times and many
high-school students take prep
courses that promise to raise an
applicant's score. Stanford cur
rently offers such a course
through its High School Summer
College program.
In spite of the recent contro
versy surrounding College Board,
approximately 2.2 million high
school students are expected to
take the SAT at different times
this fall, and their scores will
largely dictate where they will be
admitted to college.
Dean of Admission and
Financial Aid Richard Shaw gave
assurance of the SAT and its con
tinued use in Stanford undergrad
uate admissions.
"While some candidates were
affected by the misreporting of
test scores, there was no impact in
regard to their admissions deci
sion at Stanford," Shaw said.
"While this glitch in reporting
was unfortunate, the significance
of the error has received far
greater importance in the press
than the actual impact on admis
sions outcomes. We assume the
College Board will make adjust
ment in their quality control and
ensure this will not happen
again."
The College Board, the non-profit
organization that administers, scores and
maintains records of the SAT, has recently
come under fire by New York Senator
Kenneth LaValle, chairman of the state
Senate Higher Education Committee.
Trouble began in March, when The
College Board reported that over 4,000
high-school students nationwide received
incorrect scores on the October 2005 SAT
because of a computer glitch allegedly
caused by excessive moisture on answer
sheets. By April, The College Board
reported 4,411 of the 495,000 October test
takers received incorrectly low scores, 83
percent of them off by 40 points or less on
the 2,400-point exam. One score was off by
450 points.
Although The College Board claims
that all students and educational institu

tions were subsequently notified of the
botched exams, and the problem was cor
rected, the organization refused to release
its report on the incident, insisting that the
report was not finalized and that it is
exempt from state law. Representatives
from The College Board also said that an
early release of the report could impact
ongoing lawsuits pertaining to the scoring
errors.
Senator LaValle countered this refusal
by invoking New York's "truth in testing
law," which requires all reports to be
released to the legislature. LaValle issued
subpoenas to College Board executives
including College Board President Gaston
Caperton, a former West Virginia gover
nor.
"Once again The College Board's
approach to problems is to shroud them in
secrecy," Senator LaValle said in a July 13
news release. "Their attitude gives rise to
greater questions as to their true purpose."
The College Board later agreed to
release the final report, which was made
available on its Web site, July 26. Prepared
by Booz Allen Hamilton, an independent
consultant group, the report concludes that
"the current process is reliable and has
prudent controls in place to safeguard

scoring accuracy for those marks made in
accordance with test directions."
The report also points out that further
improvements need to be made in the
"scanning" and "marginal marks" aspects
of test scoring, as failures in these areas
were most accountable for the botched
exams. The complete report is available at
www.collegeboard.com/sat/answersheet
processing/report.
In a press release coinciding with the
release of this report, Caperton said, "The
reason we released it is that some people
assumed we had something to hide. But we
had nothing to hide. Anyone who reads
this report would say it's very comprehen
sive, and that we've gone the extra mile to
make sure this process is as error-free as
possible."
LaValle was still not satisfied, however,
by The College Board's response.
"The board's lack of accountability in
this matter goes to the heart of the arro
gance that exists when an organization
basically holds a monopoly in a certain
market," LaValle said in a statement fol
lowing the release of the report. "This
report still does not answer why such a
large number of testing errors
occurred on the October 2005
SAT. In addition, the board has
not provided an explanation of
why it took several months to
inform over 4,000 students of
inaccurate test scores."
Additionally, The National
Center for Fair and Open Testing
responded to the report by releas
ing a list of questions that the
study did not answer. Among
them: What was the root cause of
the problem? When did The
College Board receive the first
request for hand scoring of the
October SAT? How many weeks
did it take for the board to
respond to that request? When
did The College Board first dis
cover a broad problem? Why was
there a delay between that time
and when test takers and others
were informed of the problem?
In the long run, the report
makes the recommendation of
offering the SAT online as a way
to minimize scoring problems due
to mechanical malfunctions,
though the prospect of an online
SAT raises many security ques
tions. Certainly, the amount of
weight given to SAT scores in col
lege admissions necessitates that
the process be carefully scruti
nized for error.

Although The College Board
insists that the mistakes that led
to last fall's incorrect exams will
be fixed, and the problem was an
isolated incident, the organiza
tion's reputation as a supposedly
non-profit, fair institution has
been damaged by the mistake and
its initial refusal to cooperate
with the Senate Higher
Education Committee.
Moreover, this gives rise to the
question of whether the SAT
should continue to be used in col
lege admissions.
"The SAT is important to col
lege admissions because it repre
sents a universal assessment by
which all applicants can be mea
sured," said rising junior Nima
Ghamsari. "Things like GPA and
