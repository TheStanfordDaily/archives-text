## Senator attacks College Board College Board under investigation after SAT scoring errors 
### HUNTER BARNS 
The College Board, the non-profit
organization that administers, scores and
maintains records of the SAT, has recently
come under fire by New York Senator
Kenneth LaValle, chairman of the state
Senate Higher Education Committee.
Trouble began in March, when The
College Board reported that over 4,000
high-school students nationwide received
incorrect scores on the October 2005 SAT
because of a computer glitch allegedly
caused by excessive moisture on answer
sheets. By April, The College Board
reported 4,411 of the 495,000 October test
takers received incorrectly low scores, 83
percent of them off by 40 points or less on
the 2,400-point exam. One score was off by
450 points.
Although The College Board claims
that all students and educational institu

tions were subsequently notified of the
botched exams, and the problem was cor
rected, the organization refused to release
its report on the incident, insisting that the
report was not finalized and that it is
exempt from state law. Representatives
from The College Board also said that an
early release of the report could impact
ongoing lawsuits pertaining to the scoring
errors.
Senator LaValle countered this refusal
by invoking New York's "truth in testing
law," which requires all reports to be
released to the legislature. LaValle issued
subpoenas to College Board executives
including College Board President Gaston
Caperton, a former West Virginia gover
nor.
"Once again The College Board's
approach to problems is to shroud them in
secrecy," Senator LaValle said in a July 13
news release. "Their attitude gives rise to
greater questions as to their true purpose."
The College Board later agreed to
release the final report, which was made
available on its Web site, July 26. Prepared
by Booz Allen Hamilton, an independent
consultant group, the report concludes that
"the current process is reliable and has
prudent controls in place to safeguard

scoring accuracy for those marks made in
accordance with test directions."
The report also points out that further
improvements need to be made in the
"scanning" and "marginal marks" aspects
of test scoring, as failures in these areas
were most accountable for the botched
exams. The complete report is available at

processing/report.
In a press release coinciding with the
release of this report, Caperton said, "The
reason we released it is that some people
assumed we had something to hide. But we
had nothing to hide. Anyone who reads
this report would say it's very comprehen
sive, and that we've gone the extra mile to
make sure this process is as error-free as
possible."
LaValle was still not satisfied, however,
by The College Board's response.
"The board's lack of accountability in
this matter goes to the heart of the arro
gance that exists when an organization
basically holds a monopoly in a certain
market," LaValle said in a statement fol
lowing the release of the report. "This
report still does not answer why such a
