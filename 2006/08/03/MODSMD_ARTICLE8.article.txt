## Sketch Discriminate Thinking about subtle bias in the tech fields 
### 
Bigotry is a funny thing. In
principle most people think
its bad, but in practice peo
ple's standards are... flexible.
Now, as people who know me
well are aware, I am as white as the
driven snow. However, due to cir
cumstances beyond my control, my
intrinsic pallor doesn't always shine
through and folk often mistake me
for a member of an "ethnic minori
ty" (a phrase I use on the assump
tion that we can all agree on its lin
guistic idiocy).
Despite this pigeon-holing, I am
sad to say that racial discrimination
has never been a problem (worse, it's
never even been an advantage). No
one has ever thrown racial abuse at
me (well, actually there was one time,
but she was cute, so it doesn't really
count) and, more importantly, I can
name nothing in my life where racism
has stopped me doing what I wanted.
I suspect that this un-inequitable
life is mostly a consequence of luck
— I've always led a charmed life —
rather than some demonstration of a
color-blind world. Still, it got me
thinking.
This discrimination business
comes up a lot in academia, espe
cially in the sciences. It is a fairly
indisputable fact that there are
many groups (religious, racial, gen
der and so on) whose representation
in academic life does not match
their relative size in society. The
most obvious example is, of course,
women.
As I'm sure my audience (i.e.
third year physics graduate stu
dents) will be aware, there aren't
many girls into gravity. This is a
source of some concern.
To deal with the inequity (or
inequality in you prefer), physicists
(and other scientists) fall back on
everyone's favorite solutions to dif
ficult problems: Meetings. So, every
now and again, seminars, luncheons
and the like are held to discuss ways
to shepherd the ladies to the labora
tories.
After one such recent event, I
found myself discussing these con
cern with some of the participants.
While we failed to account com
pletely for systematic biases we did
(I think) all agree that there was at
least one sort of bigotry we had all
seen at some point.
Stereotyping is rife in and about
the academic world. The image of a
scientist is a well-defined thing —
society even paints a different pic
ture of physicists and biologists, of
chemists and mathematicians —
and the definition is not that great.
Almost everyone sitting in on our
discrimination chat agreed that,
socially at least, saying that you
studied physics was more crippling
in the society we moved in than race

or gender.
Of course, this is a very limited
problem; its effects are far from
being on the same order as, say, hit
ting the glass ceiling and finding
your career skid to halt because you
have breasts. Still, it's curious.
There are, at least in the gross
simplification of this column, two
sorts of bigotry. First, there's the
stuff that everyone (or at least some
significant majority/vocal minority)
agrees is wrong, but somehow hap
pens anyway. Lots of 'isms' fall into
this category. They're things that
can (and often do) cause great harm,
not only to individuals, but to soci
ety at large.
The second sort of bigotry is,
however, somewhat more invidious.
Viewed by its practitioners as noth
ing more than a reflection of some
self-evident truth, it frequently caus
es far less harm than my first exam
ple and seems, in some ways, to
often be a whiny complaint rather
than a real problem.
Still, it's at least a little discon
certing that those amongst us who
will argue vehemently that people
should viewed as they are and not as
their race/gender/religion would
have them be, will happily broadcast
some other prejudice that, whilst not
condemned by society, has little
basis in rationality or demonstrable
evidence.
Now, I and many of my fellow
scientists are just as bad as many of
those who seek to have us all wear
ing coke bottle glasses and pocket
protectors. When faced with the
snobbery of those who would belit
tle our "merely" technical skills, we
belittle right back at them and insist
that in the hierarchy of intellectual
pursuits, the sciences tower above
the arts.
I suspect that if you've made it
this far, you're probably thinking
that none of this applies to you. Sure
you discriminate, but it's based on
experience and it's never
Discrimination. That Nav guy just
can't get any, and he's just trying to
find an excuse.
Yeah, and I'm happy that I'm a
Beta; those Alphas are too smart,
the Deltas are kind of short and the
Epsilons are just dirty.

I'm currently mixing with my own
kind in France. Email navins@stan
ford.edu if you want me to stay
away.
