Stanford Daily Dining Guide 2006-2007
The Dining Guide will be an exclusive tabloid of 10-pages featuring 1 / 2 page (6 col x 5") reviews of 40
restaurants in the Stanford Area. The Guide will be inserted to supplement our Orientation issue of The
Stanford Daily, and would be a great opportunity to advertise your business to a new crop of students and their
parents.
Investing in The Dining Guide will grant each restaurant: a large, full color picture or logo of the restaurant,
basic contact information (address, phone number etc.) and a written review by our awarding winning editorial
staff.

We at The Stanford Daily believe local restaurants would benefit greatly from the exposure that The Dining
Guide would provide to your business for several reasons:
• The Stanford Daily understands that advertisements may have been placed in the past with the
Directory; however the Dining Guide will offer a more personalized source of information for the new
Stanford community.
• The Guide will offer exclusive coverage to only 40 restaurants and eateries around the Stanford Area
• Publication during Orientation (Sept. 19) when approximately 1,600 new students will be arriving with
parents eager to explore the neighboring areas
You can reserve your section in The Dining Guide at a 67% discount. In addition, to further promote your local
business, the Daily and each restaurant would agree upon a contract of 200 column-inches in advertising
space for the 2006-2007 academic year. Becoming a contracted client of The Stanford Daily has many
benefits.
• Advertising with The Stanford Daily, would allow each restaurant the chance to build upon the
relationship established early with The Dining Guide. With continued advertising throughout the year,
students will constantly be updated and informed about your presence in the community.
• Furthermore, each restaurant would be able to advertise in our numerous special issues (Homecoming,
Parents Weekend, etc.) free from a 15% surcharge that is assessed to non-contracted clients.
For a very competitive price, each restaurant would receive unparalleled exposure to our readership of 32,000
members of the Stanford Community.
