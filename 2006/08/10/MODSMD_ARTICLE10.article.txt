## Michael Wilkerson Letting down the children Young show respect and admiration for westerners, but should they?

KAMPALA, UGANDA — I do not know who taught the children of
Uganda to wave exuberantly at white people. I wish I deserved their excite
ment. Though we are still an anomaly in the country and the stares are
understandable, it is the happiness that puzzles me. I cannot shake the feeling that
there is something amiss with the image that all whites are a cause for jubilation.

Though children in Kampala and some of
the larger cities are more hesitant, it is an
uncommon trip to outlying towns where the
journey does not provoke stares, waves and
smiling cries of "Mzungu! Mzungu, how are
you?!" from nearly everyone under the age
of 12. (Mzungu means "white man." While I
originally thought it meant "stupid white
man" I have been informed that either I was
simply imagining the connotation, or it was
being applied with other surrounding words
that I didn't recognize.)
These few words often seem to be the
only English these children know; they are
sometimes as young as three or four. As I
walked in one small village in the East, a few
kids ran up and took my hands, walking with
me as they repeated "Mzungu, how are you"
several times each. I responded with an even
wider smile than the one I had already been
carrying. But when I spoke aloud beyond
saying hello and broadened my questions to
"how old are you," and "what is your
name?" I was greeted by a shriek and the
children bolted away. I cannot be sure
whether their departure and accompanying
screams were because of sheer delight or
stark terror at the unknown words I spoke.
The children in Kampala are not so easi
ly impressed. Most do not go as far as yelling
out or grabbing my hand, but the effect is
still noticeable. Last week I decided to walk
home from work and overtook two boys on
their way home from school who could have
been eight and ten. I was moving more
quickly than they were and as I came from
behind the younger one heard my steps and
turned his head slightly. After seeing me in
the corner of his eye he did a double-take
worthy of a cartoon and stopped short, star
ing with an open mouth. His companion also
halted a few paces ahead and stood looking
back. I smiled and greeted them, but the
only perceptible movement was a widening
in their eyes (shock?), so I continued on my
way.
The excitement kids seem to get from
seeing me passing nearby appears doubled
when I respond and acknowledge them,
something I guess not everyone bothers to
do. "I'm sure you'll make their day, and
probably their week" a Ugandan friend
chuckled as I waved back emphatically out
of the car window at a small, smiling girl

walking along the road with her mother,
both carrying something on their heads.
If something so easy as a wave or a smile
can make someone happy for even an hour,
it seems almost immoral not to do it, and 1
never hesitate with a grin and outstretched
arm. But as happy as I may make them in
that instant, overall I know that I stand
unworthy of such adulation and have to
question if am letting down these children by
accepting it. What makes me so special, the
fact that I am white alone? I must admit that
I feel guilty about the celebrity treatment I
have often been given.
Is it because the Ugandan friendliness
toward visitors I have experienced across the
country starts at youth? Is it because mzun
gus are generally thought to be rich and
powerful (and unfortunately, compared to
most Ugandans, often are)? Is it because we
are still a rare sight to many, especially in the

and biggest and fanciest villas in the country
are also owned by these people who are sup
posedly here to help, one must wonder when
this current attitude of happy greeting will
give way to full scale resentment.
I am reminded of George Orwell, a
British author who grew up in colonial India.
In his 1937 novel, Burmese Days, he wrote
of the British colonies, "the lie is that we're
here to uplift our poor black brothers
instead of to rob them." Have things really
changed so much in the intervening 60 years
since he wrote? In my experience they have
not.
Aid money these days cannot seem to be
given away fast enough, and most of the
white businessmen in Uganda are quite well
off. But what is the cost to Ugandans?
Despite smiles, goodwill and decades of
built-up guilt, in many cases white people
are making things worse.

less populous areas, something one can go
home and tell the family, "Guess what I saw
today?"
It is certainly not just because we are for
eigners. Are Indians, Kenyans or Ethiopians
greeted with the same beaming faces of chil
dren running to hold their hands? Certainly
not the high voices trilling "Bazungu." No.
As far as money, true, the majority of the
donor money comes from predominately
white Western nations, and most of the for
eign NGOs are run by citizens from these
places. But when the most expensive cars

There are strong arguments that foreign
aid and even investments can perpetuate the
problems of developing countries rather than
help them. To begin with, aid money props up
corruption by allowing officials to get away
with misusing money that should be going to
their constituents. With donors to fill short
falls there is less need for accountability. This
week millions of dollars were taken out of the
Kampala City Council bank account by one
of its officials with no documentation or rea
son for the withdrawal, but the government is
not particularly concerned.

On a more personal note, the NGOs
themselves (both foreign and home-grown)
often take the jobs because of high interna
tional pay scales instead of an actual desire
to help. Every so-called aid worker I see dri
ving a Land Rover and living in Uganda like
royalty — with the requisite servants and
entourage — makes me cringe. An examina
tion of most NGO budgets makes it clear
that administration rather than actual pro
jects takes the bulk of the funding. If Tony
Blair's proposal to double aid to Africa is
out of guilt, he must make sure any further
aid does not continue to fund a modern colo
nial ruling class.
At Stanford, the strong desire for social
action and helping others must be carefully
channeled. Many student groups raise
money for the very organizations whose
ineptness and money wasting I have wit
nessed first hand. It is important for every
one who wants to help Africa to realize that
raising more money is not always the
answer. Every school built by a student
founded group takes pressure off of what are
generally bad governments.
So as to the children, I wish I could fulfill
their expectations. I wish that 1 was rich
enough to help them personally. I wish that
I really was someone to celebrate seeing or
that this excitement about whites is because
we are truly here to help and not to rob. I
wish that all of our foreign aid money and
NGOs were really making a difference in

their lives. But the guilty feeling will not go
away.
1 do not know who taught the children of
Uganda to wave at white people. I wish I
deserved their excitement. In the meantime,
all I can do is keep waving back.
