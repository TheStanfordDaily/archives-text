## Sketch Small Gods 
### 
As we all know, "God" doesn't
exist. Still he (or she, or it),
like so many other fairytale
creatures, can be a useful illustrative
tool. For example, understand the
Idea of a god and you can, maybe,
understand the secret desires of acad
emics.
I'm not a great believer in original
thought - it always seems terribly
over-enthusiastic compared with, say,
plagiarism - which is why the title of
this column has been borrowed from
a marvellous Terry Prachett novel.
The theme of said novel is not an
uncommon one amongst those who
write on deities; it is the notion that
the power of the gods comes from
worship. The more supplicants that
supplicate, the higher the higher
being.
It's an appealing idea, for it tem
pers the strength of the divine with
something more manageable, some
thing bounded and, perhaps, some
thing not even all that desirable.
After all, would you really want to
prostrate yourself on the altar of
prayer? (Actually, I suppose the
flock would be doing the prostrating
while you were idolized up on the
altar.)
It seems as if, in the real world at
least, it would take a peculiarly
warped mind to decide that their fate
should be decided by the accolades
of acolytes. However, what is "true"
in Valhalla, Olympus and the
Pantheon turns out to hold in acade
mia as well.
Each corner of the intellectual
world is its own particular religion,
and every type of worship can be
found. From the folksy rituals of
anthropology to the elaborate
pageantry of electrical engineering,
we have them all.
Now, if we have religion, where
are the gods? Well, we have a fluid
and dynamic power structure, for our
gods are raised from amongst us and
they feed upon our worship.
To be at the top of your profes
sion as an accountant, banker or a
consultant is to be paid well, to be
looked upon as a success. Great legal
and medical minds are to be respect
ed, not bowed before. Even in the
glitzy spheres of show business and
sports, worship comes with frequent
criticism, mockery and occasional
scorn.
Academics residing at the top of
their profession, though, are truly
Small Gods. If you are regarded as a
lion in your field, you will have that
power. A single comment from a
woman at the top of her field will
shape a decade's worth of research.
A paper from the right guy deriding
a new avenue of inquiry will slam
down on the brakes. (How's that for
mixed metaphors?)
Actually, the power and influence
bestowed by having followers is not
the point. It's the worship itself we
crave.

What draws people to a life in
quads, halls and office hours? It's
certainly not the money, and frankly
that intellectual curiosity thing is seri
ously overrated. As for the constant
availability of ever younger youth,
well, they have rules about that sort
of thing these days.
No, the thing that pulls us in is the
simple desire to be looked upon as
gods. There is no other field where
success pays, not in gold, but rather,
in a far older offering, one with fewer
letters.
It is, I suppose, a very human
thing to want to be loved and
respected. It is even human to admit
as much. However, that secret desire
that many of us have for both love
and respect, in combination with
being feared and inspiring awe, is
rarely admitted.
Who would answer questions of
career choice with the response: "A
living god"? Who would even think
it?
Well, those of us of academia may
not care to confess our deepest, dark
est desires (mine involve an inordi
nate amount of leather), but believe
that at their heart lies a dream. A
dream of having the awe of the world
upon you as you stand that little
higher than the rest. A dream of hav
ing a little, just a little, of God within
you.
Did you find this blasphemous? Are
you distraught and troubled? Did
your dreams die today? Email some
one cares. On the other hand, if you
have something interesting to say,
you can get me on navins@stan
ford.edu.
