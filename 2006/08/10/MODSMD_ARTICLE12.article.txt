## Family Inheritance 
### 
I had a great conversation with a
friend last night, and 1 finally got
to hear what drives this person —
turns out, it's the desire to be #1.
My friend told me how he'd
learned this work ethic from his par
ents and even grandparents. It was
incredibly inspirational to hear about
my friend's desire to be the best, but
it also made me realize how different
my own family is. For better or
worse, we tend to value health more
than achievement: we value serenity
more than competition, we take time
to exercise no matter how much
work we have, and nothing short of
Christ's second coming takes priority
over getting eight hours of sleep.
This got me thinking about inheri
tance of values. How much of our val
ues do we get from our parents, and
how are these values transmitted?
People talk a lot about genetic influ
ences on personality and how more than
half the variation in many personality
traits can be explained by heredity.
There's also the matter of parents
transmitting values to their children
through their example and advice.
But I've found that there are even
more ways that values can pass
through generations, some of them
very unexpected.
There's an interesting story about
materialism in my family. My broth
er and I had long wondered why we
weren't very interested in expensive
possessions. For as long as we
remembered, our family had shown
almost complete disinterest in mater
ial goods, and our house illustrated it.
I didn't have many ideas as to why
this was until recently, when my
mom told me her theory: mydad was
in a tornado in Missouri when he was
three years old, and his family lost all
their possessions except for their car.
Their house was flattened and
their dog was killed. Despite insur
ance, it took a long time for them to
recover from this loss, and it

remained a huge lesson that you
shouldn't care too much about mate
rial things because you could lose
them anytime.
I got something from my mom's
side in a similar way. I'd long won
dered why I wasn't very interested in
girly things. I don't think I read "17"
until I was 21. I taught myself any
thing I know about makeup and
clothes, and I'm totally ignorant of
lots of girly things. For instance, man
icures, facials and pedicures might as
well be aboriginal religious cere
monies for all I know about them.
For a long time I took my non-girli
ness for granted, until my mom told me
one day,"I wish I'd been better about
doing girly things with you. I had 4
brothers and no sisters, so I didn't learn
much that I could pass on to you." I
haven't had any sisters, either... so I'd
better start reading Cosmo more, in
case I have girls of my own.
Another interesting example of
non-genetic, non-direct trait inheri
tance in my family is alcohol. I don't
think there's ever been a beer in my
house. My brother and I would gawk
when my mom occasionally bought
cooking wine, though she'd boil it
enough to render it completely non
intoxicating. All in all, my family saw
alcohol as empty calories, detrimental
to the brain, and morally hazardous.
That would explain why when I
came to Stanford, I didn't drink. I
didn't have more than a sip of alco
hol at a time until a few months ago.
Even though I enjoy it now, I carry
my family's idea that beer is about as
proper a drink as rubbing alcohol.

Our aversion to alcohol might
stem from another trait we have in
common: concern about health. All
four of us spend enormous amounts
of time and effort on our health.
Probably one in four books or maga
zines we read relates to health. My
dad has been running three miles
every other day and lifting weights
on the other days for the past 32
years, and my brother and I have
picked up this habit too.
Certainly, there's an element of
inheritance by example. Seeing my
parents exercise and eat healthfully
made us think these are the obvious
things to do. But I think there's also
a genetic component. Although "ten
dency to exercise and eat healthy
food" might not be transmitted
genetically, one's levels of mental
health and bodily resilience might be
genetic influences. It seems that due
to our genes, those of us in my fami
ly have a hard time keeping ourselves
happy and feeling good. If we share
the same fragility, no wonder we all
are concerned with handling our
common condition.
Inheritance of priorities and values
is much more complicated than just
genetic transmission or transmission
by example. Sometimes one parent's
example will induce a child to go in a
totally opposite direction, or some
one's childhood experience will end
up influencing their grandchildren.
It's like unpredictable
Lamarckian inheritance — what
your parents do during their life
influences you, and you might get
their trait — or the opposite.
In any event, this type of inheri
tance also happens between friends.
After hearing my friend talk last
night about how good it feels to aim
to be the best at whatever you do,
I'm inspired to try it more myself. To
make my parents proud, maybe I'll
start by trying to be the best at get
ting eight hours of sleep every night.

genetically, one's levels of mental
health and bodily resilience might be
genetic influences. It seems that due
to our genes, those of us in my fami
ly have a hard time keeping ourselves
happy and feeling good. If we share
the same fragility, no wonder we all
are concerned with handling our
common condition.
Inheritance of priorities and values
is much more complicated than just
genetic transmission or transmission
by example. Sometimes one parent's
example will induce a child to go in a
totally opposite direction, or some
one's childhood experience will end
up influencing their grandchildren.
It's like unpredictable
Lamarckian inheritance — what
your parents do during their life
influences you, and you might get
their trait — or the opposite.
In any event, this type of inheri
tance also happens between friends.
After hearing my friend talk last
night about how good it feels to aim
to be the best at whatever you do,
I'm inspired to try it more myself. To
make my parents proud, maybe I'll
start by trying to be the best at get
ting eight hours of sleep every night.
