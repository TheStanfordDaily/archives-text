# OFF CAMPUS
## Confessions of a shutterbug 
### JOHN SHEN COLUMNIST 
The last few weeks, I've done quite a lot of
traveling in Europe.
But rather than write about those inter
esting things, I'm going take a break from travel
logging to bitch about "The Daily."
Okay, maybe not bitch. I actually like "The
Daily." Well, at least I, along with the rest of last
year's staff, had a secret crush on Camille. But,
having spent the past year working behind the
scenes as a photo editor, it's nice to take the

opportunity to vent in a column. I feel less
enchanted to use all of my columns to just count
how many beers I've drank since I've gotten here
(its too high anyway to fit in this space).
Like I said, I really don't have that much
against "The Daily," other than the fact that they
did send all of us photogs on a wild goose chase
for President Bush last quarter that I'm still a bit
bitter about. Try standing outside Hoover Tower
with a monopod, two camera bodies and a 151b
400 mm telephoto for three hours and then run
ning over to Slavdom with all that equipment on
a moment's notice and you'll see what I mean.
And, I do like being one of the few campus
photographers. Aside from having street-cred as
an amateur professional among lots of other
photo-wannabes, people actually look at your
work before their paper gets buried under a cou
ple plates of Stern Dining nachos and burritos.
And the job has its perks. Shooting sports is
stressful, but nevertheless a lot of fun, and I can't
complain about getting unlimited access to speak

ers like Seth MacFarlane and a free ticket to
Gaieties. But then again we have to shoot other
things too, like my favorite assignment to date:
"take a picture of diverse looking people at the
Medical School," or the [insert student group
here] puts on [insert activity here]."
Regardless, it's just a few more weeks before
the summer is over, which means I'll have to
change from a European- without-a-care back to a
senior-without-a-job-offer. And of course, I'll go
back to my real "Daily" position and disappear
from the limelight of the summer columnist, back
behind the late-night glow of the photo office Mac.
Schade, as the Germans say, what a shame.
Well, until then, I've got another column or two
to write and a lot of beers to drink.

John Shen is doing arm curls for the next time a
state official visits campus and, yes, he totally
wrote this while at work. Tell him to do his job at
