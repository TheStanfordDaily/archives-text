## FOOTBALL PREVIEW The 						Boys Are Back Stanford Football begins fall practice with high hopes for the upcoming season 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the Stanford football team returning
for a spirited fall practice this Monday at the
Elliott Football Practice Fields, fans, players,
and coaches alike are curious to see how the
2M6-2007 season will turn out.
Last season was filled with ups and downs
for the Stanford football team, though
Cardinal fans will mostly remember the downs
— a fourth-quarter collapse against UCLA, a
heartbreaking final two minutes hosting Notre
Dame, a lop-sided loss in the Big Game, and an
embarrassing effort against UC-Davis.
Nevertheless, second-year head coach Walt
Harris remains confident as he looks to build
on the system he introduced last year to the
Cardinal, who finished their season with a 5-6
record and a 4-4 mark in the Pacific-10
Conference.
"This is our second season [as a coaching
staff], and I think some of the things we want to
do are falling into place," Harris said. "We're a
little older on offense this year than we are on
defense, which is exactly the opposite of last
year, so we need to play well on offense."
Stanford returns 16 starters, including quar
terback Trent Edwards to go along with the

team's entire offensive line and all but one run
ning back from last year's campaign. The
Cardinal averaged just 316 yards of offense per
game last season, compared to opponents' 441.
Edwards is currently Stanford's eighth all
time in career passing yards, career total
offense, attempts and completions, and ninth
in touchdown passes. Over the past three
years, he has completed 393 of 709 passes for
4,402 yards and 28 touchdowns. Backup T.C.
Ostrander has played in 12 games over the past
two seasons, throwing for 1,443 yards and five
touchdowns.
"I doubt many people have a quarterback
that is as good as Trent Edwards," Harris said.
"I refer to Trent as the best quarterback that
nobody has heard of. He still has to improve
his game, but I believe he's very committed to
doing so."
Running backs Anthony Kimble and Jason
Evans rushed for 244 and 248 yards last season,
respectively, and look to propel the Cardinal's
rushing in 2006. Kimble started the first six
games last season before relinquishing the spot
to senior J.R. Lemon. Stanford also returns
senior wide receivers Mark Bradford and Evan
Moore, though depth in the skill position
remains a serious concern for Harris. Senior
Marcus McCutcheon is the only other experi
enced receiver — only three catches last sea
son.
Harris won't be able to count on experience
helping the defense, however, as he must
replace five starters. Returning starter Gustav

Rydstedt will anchor the defensive line in the
middle. Stanford will also have to replace four
year starting kicker Michael Sgroi, while senior
Jay Ottovegio resumes punting responsibili
ties.
The Cardinal will open their season at
Oregon on Sept. 2. The Ducks finished 10-2
overall last season with their only conference
loss coming to the University of Southern
California.
"We look at playing Oregon in the opener
as an opportunity to have a great training camp
and a lot of really good practices, because we
open by playing a really good football team,"
Harris said.

Stanford will then travel to San Jose State
before the home-opener against Navy on Sept.
16. The Cardinal then hosts Washington State,
travels to UCLA and South Bend, hosts
Arizona and visits Arizona State. Stanford gets
a week off before hosting Southern California,
traveling to Washington and hosting Oregon
State. The Cardinal gets their final bye-week
before the Big Game on Dec. 2 at California.
"We found out last year that we could win
at the Pac-10, and we have to get back to that
level," Harris said. "We have an opportunity to
erase what's happened in the past and build a
more productive future. We're really excited
about that opportunity."
