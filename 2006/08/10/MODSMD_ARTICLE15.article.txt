# COLUMN: WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## Ladies, this is your year 
### JAKE KELMAN SPORTS COLUMNIST 
In each of the last three seasons, the Stanford
women's basketball team has bowed out of the
NCAA tournament in the Elite Eight, including
last year's heart breaker to LSU. Despite the
success the program has enjoyed in the past few
seasons, Tara VanDerveer's squad has not won
a national title since 1992. Cardinal fans anxious
to see the team get over the hump should gear
up, as the 2006-2007 outfit looks to have the best
shot at breaking this title drought. This team is
stronger and deeper than last year's, but the col
lection of talent assembled will only be around
for so long. This is the year.
Sure, last year's team was a good one, as it
showed by winning yet another Pac-10 title and
advancing to the Regional Final, but that team
had its weak points. There was youth at key
spots, with freshman starting at both point
guard (the now-injured Rosalyn Gold-Onwude)
and small forward (emerging star Jillian
Harmon). There was a key injury to center
Kristen Newlin, costing her about a month of
playing time and multiple months of condition
ing down the stretch. There wasn't the urgency
for a team that had lost so many valuable con
tributors from the year before, and it didn't
have the expectations placed upon it that so
many other Stanford teams have.
Why is this year's team better equipped to
win than last year's? And why not the year after
this?
Well, the 2006-2007 version of the Cardinal
will feature four members of what is considered
to be one of the top three recruiting classes in

the nation. Forward/center Jayne Appel, with
her 6'B" wingspan, will shore up the middle and
control the glass for a Cardinal team that often
struggled to rebound the ball last season. Her
presence also leaves the Cardinal better pre
pared if, like last year, they have to absorb
injuries along the front line. At forward, while
the Cardinal loses the ability to extend the
defense that three-point markswoman Krista
Rappahahn gave them last year, they gain the
astounding athleticism of freshman Michelle
Harrison. The 6'2" Lehi, Utah product has all
the offensive skills, with a sweet stroke and a
soaring vertical leap. With rising sophomore
Gold-Onwude, a year older and a year wiser,
expected back from injury early in the season,
the Cardinal have options at the point guard
position. Two stellar freshmen, Oregon's J.J.
Hones and New York native Melanie Murphy,
will battle for the starting job while Gold-
Onwude recovers, and each will surely con
tribute once she does return.
Those four freshman will help improve the
point guard, small forward, and center posi
tions, so what about shooting guard and power
forward? Well, fortunately for the Cardinal,
those two positions are pretty well covered this
season. All-Americans Candice Wiggins and
Brooke Smith will go out there and give you 40
minutes every night, leaving Tara VanDerveer
little reason to worry about depth at the "two"
and the "four" (Smith can play center too, but
with Newlin and Appel, she may see the major
ity of her time playing power forward). Wiggins
and Smith have been fixtures in the Cardinal
lineup for a few seasons now, and their games
have evolved to the point where they are each

legitimate number one scoring options. So with
all this star power and all this young depth, why
must the Cardinal win this season? Why is this
the year they have to get out of their own
regional? Because as good as those freshmen
are, and as good as they will be in the future,
you don't get to play with two superstars for
very long. This is fifth-year senior Smith's final
season on The Farm, and when she and Kristen
Newlin leave following this campaign, the
Cardinal will be left with a void in the middle

too big for even Appel to fill alone.
This is not to say the Cardinal
won't be good in the future. Wiggins
will return for one more year after
this one, and any team with her and
a surrounding cast of solid players
will always have a chance, but make
no mistake, the Cardinal need to win
now. They need to win now because
a fourth straight year of coming just
short would be too painful. They
need to win now because Brooke
Smith and Kristen Newlin form one
of the best post duos in the country
(just ask Courtney Paris). They need
to win now because they have two
stars, four great freshmen, and tons
of high quality depth, and who
knows how long that can last? So for
Cardinal fans crippled by the three
consecutive exits on the brink of the
Final Four, take notice. This could
be the year.
