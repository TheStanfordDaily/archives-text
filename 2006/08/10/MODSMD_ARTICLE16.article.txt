## Stanford leads Pac-10 in preseason poll 
### JENNA COALSON SPORTS EDITOR 
A recent Pac-10 vote named
Stanford Women's Volleyball the
favorite to win the Conference this
year. Despite falling just short of the
title last year, the upcoming season
looks promising for the team â€”at
least according to the league's coach
es.
Stanford earned 89 points in the
poll, in which coaches are not permit
ted to vote for their own team. The
Cardinal nabbed eight of the ten first
place votes. UCLA ranked second,
with two votes and 79 points.
Defending Pac-10 and national cham
pion Washington trailed at third. Cal
claimed a distant fourth.
The tables were slightly turned in
the national poll, which ranked
Washington at third and Stanford a
close fourth. Nebraska and Penn State
claimed first and second, respectively.
The season begins on Aug. 25, and fans
will see who is right this year.
The Pac-10 coaches correctly iden
tified the champion in 10 of the last 17
preseason polls.
