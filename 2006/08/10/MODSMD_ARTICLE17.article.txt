## DVD REVIEW An old school keg full of laughs 
### VICTOR FUSTÉ ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR 
Ever wonder where comedies like "American
Pie," "Old School" and "Road Trip" got their
inspiration? Stop wondering because three of
the most treasured comedy classics from the past
generation come together in the "Frat Boy
Collection" box set released this week.
First up in the collection is "Porky's," the
original horny teenage comedy all about hor
mones, booze and girls. Amazingly, the film
still hold up, delivering plenty of laughs. Of
course, "Porky's" blatant sexual humor will
certainly appeal to the demographic this collec
tion targets. It would seem that in Hollywood,
teenagers, regardless of what decade they live
in are always depicted as delinquent sex fiends,
but quite frankly if that means classic scenes
like the "Lassie" gym scene or the infamous
shower scene get made, then by golly, it works.
Second in the "Frat Boy Collection" is Tom
Hanks starring in "Bachelor Party," an inside
look at what it was like to throw a bachelor
party —makes sense considering the apt title,
no?— in the 80s. Replete with the prerequisite
drugged out friend, a donkey that overdoses on
some less-than-prescription pills and oodles of
hookers, "Bachelor Party" was one of the films
that shot Hanks into the stratosphere of star
dom and still manages to illicit a guffaw (that's
right, a guffaw) even though the decadent
excess characteristic of the 80s is long dead.
Hanks may be a multiple academy award win
ner, but doesn't hesitate to drunkenly dance on
a piano in the highlight of this box set.
Filling out the trio of beer-soaked, testos
terone-filled films is "PCU." Although less pop
ular that the previous two, the film stars David
Spade ("Benchwarmers") and Jon Favreau
("Swingers")in the quintessential battle between
slacker frat boys, pompous rich boys and the
iiber-politically correct crowd that divides every
campus with their overly sensitive protests.
The DVDs are just the barebones in terms of
extras, but if you're looking for a three-pack of
movies that manage a laugh and tap into that
libidinous frat boy in all of us, check out the
"Frat Boy Collection." Just make sure you do it
with a frothy beer in hand.
