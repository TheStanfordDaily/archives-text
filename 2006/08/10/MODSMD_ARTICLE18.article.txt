# AT THE MOVIE HOUSE
## Difficult images to forget 'World Trade Center' avoids politics despite questionable timing 
### BY MILTON SOLORZANO ENTERTAINMENT FILM CRITIC 
Is it too soon to watch a film about 9/11 ?
For better or worse, this question will largely be ignored as we
approach the fifth anniversary of that day. As we speak, television
and documentary producers wade through a sea of raw images,
sounds and emotions to manufacture a comprehensive and
digestible product for us to witness. For those too young to
remember, these products will serve as a vicarious experience of
that day.

It is with this audience
in mind, those who know
9/11 as past generations
know Pearl Harbor or the
Kennedy assassination,
that Oliver Stone directed
"World Trade Center,"
and partly how he justifies
it. His tight focus on the
storyline and characters
restrain the film's exten
sive scope and result in an
admirable work of cre
ative and documentary tal
ent— a testament to the
victims of the WTC
attacks — but nonetheless
a film inseparable in its
impact from the attacks
themselves.
The story follows two
officers in the Port
Authority Police
Department, Sgt. John
McLoughlin (Nicolas
Cage) and William Jimeno
(Michael Pefia), who
depart for an average day
at work early that Tuesday
morning. When partial
and conflicting reports
stream in about an acci
dent at the WTC, they
head for the site with
sparse equipment and as
Sgt. McLoughlin states
frankly, "no plan." As the
buildings fall, the rubble
traps them twenty feet
from any hope of rescue.
For twenty-four hours,
they suffer agonizing phys
ical and mental pain.
Their story is unique
and miraculous — they
were two of the twenty
survivors pulled from the
wreckage — but the emo-

tions and values they express are universal.
Familiar too is the pain suffered by their
family members, particularly by wives
Donna McLoughlin (Maria Bello) and
Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhall). One
scene features Mrs. Jimeno's frustration at
the odd normality of an endlessly stocked
drugstore; "What am I doing here?" she
asks. Stone does well to highlight that out
of-place feeling, as it was common the day
the unthinkable happened.

Stone also lends considerable credibility
to the film through an almost obsessive devotion to accuracy — a
condition real-life officers McLoughlin and Jimeno insisted upon
for their involvement in the film. Footage from the site of the

WTC was taken in a 6 week shoot and combined with scenes from
a dark, smoky, jagged landscape of twisted metal and broken con
crete recreated in painstaking detail (Stone has complained of a
cough he picked up from inhaling smoke during shooting). One
striking feature early in the film was the haunting rain of office
paper during the towers' burning — an awful foreshadowing of
their inevitable conclusion.
However, this accuracy also records moments that may be
uncomfortable for some. Stone depicts Jimeno's unexpected
vision of Jesus, remaining true to his experience, without explana-

tion or alternative inter
pretation. Also contro
versial, though again
accurate, is the depiction
of SSgt. Dave Karnes,
the man who first found
the two officers in the
rubble. Karnes, a then
retired Marine working
as an accountant in
Connecticut, felt deeply
moved by the attacks and
answered a religious call
to serve. Although
Kearns' service and char
acter are unquestionably
admirable in the film, his
religious commentary and
reference to vengeance
later in the film may
ascribe an unintentional
crusader aspect to the
only developed military
member seen in the film.
Given that the ripples of
9/11 still very actively
engage our military at
home and abroad, these
are sentiments not to be
touched upon lightly.
Ultimately, the crux
of the film rests on 9/11
itself. To his credit,
Stone's work is both a
fair and fulfilling inter
pretation of an already
closely inspected event.
He presents a story that
we may have heard, but
with enough strength in
cinematic elements and
factual integrity to
maintain suspense.
Additionally, he stays
true to his oft-proclaimed
mantra "this is not a
political film" and deftly
keeps political figures at
the comfortable distance

of a TV screen in the film. However, the
strength of the movie's telling draws undeni
ably from the emotional impact of the real
event and reliving that event takes a signifi
cant toll on the audience's energy — the movie
feels almost an hour longer than real-time.
Other small deficiencies, such as Cage's best
attempt accent, are largely overshadowed by
the immensity of the piece and cannot be
evenly balanced against its more compelling
elements.

Any fair judgment on the film will require
the distance of years, but for those of us who still remember vivid
ly where we were when 9/11 happened, this film serves as a testa
ment and a tribute.
