" ,(, y I''["l themsel rt asking some tough questions. Is America ready for a Hollywood movie about the most horrifying day in recent history/
y\ HI duetto, Olt\ei Stone steer away from the political implications surrounding the events'/ Regardless of how you feel about the subject,
\ \ oild 11 ade ( cute i will push your comfort boundaries as well as remind you of the emotions everyone felt that tlav. Director Oliver Stone, actor
\icolas C age \\ orld hade ( enter survivor John McLoughlin and his wife Donna recount their experiences of' 9/11, the making of "World Trade
Center' and above all else, why this film is NOT a political one.

Director ;

ENTERTAINMENT: What do think people should
gel from this film?
OLIVER S TONE: That's the worst question of all.
That's not fair. You're a college student, why do you
care? Don't you think the process is more impor
tant? Fvcryone's going to take something different
from it. You see a movie, you react to it or not. You
like it or you don't. You walk out with your own feel
ings about that day. those people. I think ["World
Trade Center "| honors the feelings of that day.
That's all il can do.
Q: Had you considered doing a film about the
attacks?
OS: I had considered doing a documentary-type lilm.
like "The Battle of Algiers." Lverybody was saying.
"Run awav from realism in the movie business," but
I was saving, "l et's go the other way. Let's be realis
tic. Let's not shy awa\ from our tear."
Unfortunate!}. that film never got made. It just
wasn't the climate. And I moved on with my life. I
was in Iran, doing "Alexander" for three years so I
was in another place and time. 1 was very lucky to be
away from the America of 2002 through 2004 when
we were going to war with Iraq.
Q: Why did you want to make this film about this
specific event without the context of what is happen
ing before and since, in terms of politics?
OS: That wasn't this movie. I read the script and it I
stuck with me for two or three weeks. And 1 said that
I love to do this right away: I didn't hesitate. I've
never thought of VIII in the way the script presented
it: it was brilliant. Il was a microcosm of that day. It
looked al the smallest people, in the pit of hell where
the two buildings collapsed. And they actually sur
vived. and they lived to tell the story and il was all
true. All the characters were true: it all happened
more or less that way. John McLoughlin and the
PAPD did things by the book, they were very
methodical. There are no "Rambo" characters in this
film. The only "Rambo" like character in the movie
— and it's true, il actually happened —is Staff
Sergeant Karnes, the marine.
Q: That's very interesting. You said in a previous
interview that you had to add a placard al the end
saying what had happened to him because people
would think lie was made up.
OS: That's right. After we previewed the film in
Seattle we added it because it's funny, but there's an
added level of cynicism or skepticism about
Hollywood there. They thought we'd added a whole
layer of fiction. But his story actually happened, it
was true.
