Director ;

ENTERTAINMENT: What do think people should
gel from this film?
OLIVER S TONE: That's the worst question of all.
That's not fair. You're a college student, why do you
care? Don't you think the process is more impor
tant? Fvcryone's going to take something different
from it. You see a movie, you react to it or not. You
like it or you don't. You walk out with your own feel
ings about that day. those people. I think ["World
Trade Center "| honors the feelings of that day.
That's all il can do.
Q: Had you considered doing a film about the
attacks?
OS: I had considered doing a documentary-type lilm.
like "The Battle of Algiers." Lverybody was saying.
"Run awav from realism in the movie business," but
I was saving, "l et's go the other way. Let's be realis
tic. Let's not shy awa\ from our tear."
Unfortunate!}. that film never got made. It just
wasn't the climate. And I moved on with my life. I
was in Iran, doing "Alexander" for three years so I
was in another place and time. 1 was very lucky to be
away from the America of 2002 through 2004 when
we were going to war with Iraq.
Q: Why did you want to make this film about this
specific event without the context of what is happen
ing before and since, in terms of politics?
OS: That wasn't this movie. I read the script and it I
stuck with me for two or three weeks. And 1 said that
I love to do this right away: I didn't hesitate. I've
never thought of VIII in the way the script presented
it: it was brilliant. Il was a microcosm of that day. It
looked al the smallest people, in the pit of hell where
the two buildings collapsed. And they actually sur
vived. and they lived to tell the story and il was all
true. All the characters were true: it all happened
more or less that way. John McLoughlin and the
PAPD did things by the book, they were very
methodical. There are no "Rambo" characters in this
film. The only "Rambo" like character in the movie
— and it's true, il actually happened —is Staff
Sergeant Karnes, the marine.
Q: That's very interesting. You said in a previous
interview that you had to add a placard al the end
saying what had happened to him because people
would think lie was made up.
OS: That's right. After we previewed the film in
Seattle we added it because it's funny, but there's an
added level of cynicism or skepticism about
Hollywood there. They thought we'd added a whole
layer of fiction. But his story actually happened, it
was true.
ENT: On a similar vein, has your
opinion of the military changed,
if at all, since you made
"Platoon?"
OS: My God. I think you may
have a different impression of
me than perhaps 1 am. There has
been a lot of misinterpretation
of some of the things I've said.
However, the military's
behavior in Iraq is interesting
because they are probably a bet
ter trained army than we were.
It's not a draftee army, but it's
the same kind of social, financial
class. So what happened in Abu
Ghraib, all the torture, all the
willingness to go along with the
violence and the brutality is
engrained in the culture. And
that's what I showed in
"Platoon" because I fucking saw
it with my own eyes and it just
happened in Iraq and its proof
positive that this stuff goes on.
At the same time, you can
respect the military for being a
good military, for doing their job
right.
Now, this is separate an apart
from this movie, but I really
think that the Pentagon com
manders have let the country
down in their assessment of the
war and what they told Bush.
And in their running of the war,
too, they've let us down.
Anyways, you got me off track
again. The movie isn't political,
it resists that definition. The
problem is that the whole coun
try got politicized from that day
and when you think about 2001,
everyone thinks politics. They
forget about what happened that
day. These people showed us
that they helped each other and
they wouldn't be slaves to fear.
Don't forget that shit.
