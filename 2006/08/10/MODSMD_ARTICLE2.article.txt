## IN MEMORIAM Grazier G'Sell inspires smiles One month after graduating, student loses fight with cancer 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Swing dancing, running, Rice-Krispy
egg-drop devices, camping, Cheerios and
jazz. As evidenced by these varied interests
and the words of his family and friends,
Guy Grazier G'Sell truly enjoyed every
moment of life and taught others to do the
same.

Grazier G'Sell, 22, of
Saline, Michigan died on
July 13, 2006, about one
month after the physics
major walked at
Commencement 2006. He
is survived by his parents,
mother Kyle Grazier and
father William G'Sell,
brothers, Max and Gabe

Grazier G'Sell, and his
sister, Alex Grazier G'Seli.

During summer 2001, G'Sell said that
his son was diagnosed with brain cancer
and deferred enrollment at Stanford for a
year to undergo intense therapy and reha
bilitation. Additional cancer-related surg
eries and chemotherapy were done in 2004
and 2005.
"After Guy was diagnosed with brain
cancer, his enthusiasm for life only
increased," G'Sell said. "Throughout the
five years of Guy's disease, I never once
heard him complain of his predicament,
question the unfairness of his situation, or
express self-pity. Instead, he was open to
new experiences and put renewed empha
sis on personal relationships."
G'Sell described Grazier G'Sell's ability
to maintain a positive outlook in the face of
great physical and mental challenges as
"remarkable."
"Guy did not focus on his disease â€” he

focused on his life," G'Sell said.
"Consequently, I've taken to describing
Guy as living with cancer, rather than bat
tling it."
For his family, Grazier G'Sell was an
"influential and loving mentor and role
model," according to his father.
"Guy had an uncanny ability to live in
the moment and he endeavored to enjoy
every moment of life," G'Sell said. "It is a
lesson which is not difficult to understand,
but which is very difficult to put into prac
tice as Guy did."
For his friends at Stanford, Grazier
G'Sell served as an incredible model of
how to cope with illness.
"I will also never forget the remarkably
upbeat attitude he had when the tumor
came back last summer," said Stephanie
Sud, who graduated with her friend. "I
spoke to him the night before his surgery. I
think most people would be in a depressed
or at least apprehensive mood, but Guy
was cheerful. He showed me a strength and
character that few people can claim."
Grazier G'Sell's friend since freshman
orientation, graduated senior Yoo-Yoo
Yeh remembered their entire sophomore
year dorm "holdings its breath," when
Grazier G'Sell had a biopsy done on his
tumor.
"He shared of himself a lot," Yeh said.
"He was also really patient. His smile was a
full, big one. I will always remember Guy
smiling, happily."
Junior Tiffani Anderson, who attended
a cancer support group with Grazier G'Sell,
admired him for his commitment to sup
porting cancer research via fundraising
events.
"I will always remember walking the
laps with him at Stanford's Relay for Life
2006," Anderson said. "We signed a banner
that was later sent to the American Cancer
Society to thank them for all their efforts in
cancer research. That day meant a lot to
those of us who had cancer, and I'm glad I
could share it with a good friend."
