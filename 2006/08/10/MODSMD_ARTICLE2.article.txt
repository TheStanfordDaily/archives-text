## IN MEMORIAM Grazier G'Sell inspires smiles One month after graduating, student loses fight with cancer 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Swing dancing, running, Rice-Krispy
egg-drop devices, camping, Cheerios and
jazz. As evidenced by these varied interests
and the words of his family and friends,
Guy Grazier G'Sell truly enjoyed every
moment of life and taught others to do the
same.

Grazier G'Sell, 22, of
Saline, Michigan died on
July 13, 2006, about one
month after the physics
major walked at
Commencement 2006. He
is survived by his parents,
mother Kyle Grazier and
father William G'Sell,
brothers, Max and Gabe

Grazier G'Sell, and his
sister, Alex Grazier G'Seli.

During summer 2001, G'Sell said that
his son was diagnosed with brain cancer
and deferred enrollment at Stanford for a
year to undergo intense therapy and reha
bilitation. Additional cancer-related surg
eries and chemotherapy were done in 2004
and 2005.
"After Guy was diagnosed with brain
cancer, his enthusiasm for life only
increased," G'Sell said. "Throughout the
five years of Guy's disease, I never once
heard him complain of his predicament,
question the unfairness of his situation, or
express self-pity. Instead, he was open to
new experiences and put renewed empha
sis on personal relationships."
G'Sell described Grazier G'Sell's ability
to maintain a positive outlook in the face of
great physical and mental challenges as
"remarkable."
"Guy did not focus on his disease — he

focused on his life," G'Sell said.
"Consequently, I've taken to describing
Guy as living with cancer, rather than bat
tling it."
For his family, Grazier G'Sell was an
"influential and loving mentor and role
model," according to his father.
"Guy had an uncanny ability to live in
the moment and he endeavored to enjoy
every moment of life," G'Sell said. "It is a
lesson which is not difficult to understand,
but which is very difficult to put into prac
tice as Guy did."
For his friends at Stanford, Grazier
G'Sell served as an incredible model of
how to cope with illness.
"I will also never forget the remarkably
upbeat attitude he had when the tumor
came back last summer," said Stephanie
Sud, who graduated with her friend. "I
spoke to him the night before his surgery. I
think most people would be in a depressed
or at least apprehensive mood, but Guy
was cheerful. He showed me a strength and
character that few people can claim."
Grazier G'Sell's friend since freshman
orientation, graduated senior Yoo-Yoo
Yeh remembered their entire sophomore
year dorm "holdings its breath," when
Grazier G'Sell had a biopsy done on his
tumor.
"He shared of himself a lot," Yeh said.
"He was also really patient. His smile was a
full, big one. I will always remember Guy
smiling, happily."
Junior Tiffani Anderson, who attended
a cancer support group with Grazier G'Sell,
admired him for his commitment to sup
porting cancer research via fundraising
events.
"I will always remember walking the
laps with him at Stanford's Relay for Life
2006," Anderson said. "We signed a banner
that was later sent to the American Cancer
Society to thank them for all their efforts in
cancer research. That day meant a lot to
those of us who had cancer, and I'm glad I
could share it with a good friend."


Grazier G'Sell
In spite of his failing health,
Stephanie Selover, '04, said Grazier
G'Sell was optimistic at commence
ment in June 2006.
"Guy has shown me how brave a
person can be," she said. "For the
last few months of his life, he seemed
to be feeling worse and worse, but he
was still the same cheerful person.
Even when he had a hard time
speaking, he was still making jokes
and was wonderful to be around."
Many at Stanford will remember
Grazier G'Sell for how he made an
effort to befriend everyone.
"When I barely knew Guy, he came
by my room once and wanted to know
if I had any dinner plans," Selover said.
"When I said 'no,' he insisted we go out
and get dinner together, so we walked
down to University Avenue and got
Indian food. I will always remember
the way that Guy just made himself a
part of my life, and how kind and open
he was."
Grazier G'Sell's former resident
advisor, Sud, noted that he brought a
"fun-loving spirit to the [Soto dorm]

community."
"I will always remember Guy
stopping by my room almost daily to
get a granola bar, ask about my day
and tell me about his," Sud said.
Senior Catherine Chang trans
ferred to Stanford in fall 2003 and ini
tially would often dine only with her
roommate, a fellow transfer student.
"One day, Guy, who must have
noticed we were never with other peo
ple, just came over spontaneously and
introduced himself," Chang recalled.
"He somehow could tell when some
one needed to chat, and he'd make
himself available, listen patiently and
add occasional humor. Guy was a
stunning example of how to live with
the right priorities — putting people
and relationships with people before
all else, valuing life and every moment
of it and approaching everything with
cheerfulness, even if life itself was
uncertain."
During spring quarter 2005, Jesus
Javier "J.J." Tellez Loucel, '06, met
Grazier G'Sell when he attended the
Stanford@Sea program. Tellez
Loucel will remember Grazier
G'Sell for his "cheerful personality"
as well as his love for dancing and
jogging along the beach.
"Guy showed me the courage to
fight for life and the strength to

endure through challenges and
obstacles with the intent to continue
exploring, living, and enjoying the
wonders that lie ahead," he said.
Tellez Loucel said that several of
the nineteen members from Grazier
G'Sell's Stanford@Sea voyage are
compiling their photographs from
Hopkins for his family.
Although saddened by Grazier
G'Sell's short life, his friends were
comforted by the fact that Grazier
G'Sell was able to spend his last few
years at Stanford.
"Guy always would say that he
would never have lived as long as he
did if not for Stanford," Selover said.
"Stanford gave him something to
live for — being around people who
loved him and keeping busy with
clubs, dancing, studying and socializ
ing. Guy lived life as much as he
could."
G'Sell also noted that his son
loved his life at Stanford.
"Stanford provided the perfect
environment for Guy's life," G'Sell
said. "Social opportunities with
bright young people of similar inter
ests encouraged Guy's personal
growth. A rich variety of educational
opportunities helped provide for his
intellectual growth. The many other
opportunities at Stanford allowed

Guy constantly to explore new pur
suits, such as social dancing, sprint
triathlon and backpacking. Many of
these activities helped Guy rehabili
tate from his disease and therapies,
in addition to providing exciting new
experiences."
Grazier G'Sell's friends and family
are planning a memorial service at
Memorial Church this fall. Donations
may be made to the Pediatric Brain
Tumor Foundation or a memorial fund
at Stanford. For more information, con
tact Stanford seniors Rebecca Raybin
(rraybin@stanford.edu) and Catherine
Chang (ling.chang@stanford.edu).
G'Sell said the best way to honor
his son's memory is for others to
emulate his best traits — "by
remaining humble and recognizing
their place in a larger order; by sup
porting and encouraging one anoth
er to develop their potential and to
achieve positive results for the
greater good; by being motivated by
love and concern for humanity."
"I sincerely hope that the lives of
the people who had the opportunity
to know Guy at Stanford were
enriched by the experience," G'Sell
concluded. "If he provided his
friends some insight into what is
important in life, that could be his
greatest legacy."
