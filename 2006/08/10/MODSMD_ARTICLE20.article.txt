### 
WTC Survivor & Wife
ENTERTAINMENT: When was the
first time you saw the movie?
JOHN MCLOUGHUN: About three
weeks ago in New York, at a private
screening room. It was just myself, my
wife and the Jimeno's.
Q: So you still keep in touch with them
since everything happened?
JM: Oh yes, we're very close. I actually
didn't know him very well before. I was
one of the supervisors at the bus terminal,
and he was an officer. As a matter of fact,
I had to ask him at a certain point what his
first name was instead of calling him
Jimeno all the time. I thought would be
nice to call him by his first name consider
ing the circumstances.
Q: Did you have any reservations when
you heard that Oliver Stone was going to
direct the film?
JM: 1 never had any apprehension. I was I
honored that he wanted to do the project.
There is a man who is very good at his job.
He had all the main characters that play
police officers go out of patrol with our
police officers at the bus terminal. Nicolas
Cage went out with one of sergeants to
get a feel what it was like to be a police
officer. There's a feeling of, "instead of a
Hollywood police officer, let's get it like
how officers really are."
Q: When you were first approached
about doing this story, how did you feel
about having to relive this day in order to
have the script done?
DONNA MCLOUGHLIN: Very emo
tional. That was a decision that the four of
us had to make together. But if anybody
felt uncomfortable, we'd never have done
it. But especially with Will [Jimeno] and
John, the reasons they wanted to make
the film was not to center around us, but
to show who did what for us and to show
the goodness that came out that day.

Q: There's a point in the film where
Will Jimeno has a religious halluci
nation. John, did you have any simi
lar experiences while you were
trapped underneath the rubble?
JM: I didn't have any hallucination,

but my thoughts were
always on my family,
how much my decision
to go into the buildings
might have hurt them.
Q: Did you hesitate at
all to go into the build
ing?
JM: No, I worked at the
World Trade Center
for twelve years on
patrol and I was with
the emergency patrol
unit. I knew the build
ings well. I knew where
the equipment was. I
knew I had to go in
there to assist with my
knowledge of the
buildings and proce
dures that were in place.

Q: I know this is your training, but as
a person, I'm trying to imagine what
it was like going into a building not
knowing if you were safe. What were
your feelings?
JM: The concept when I went into
the World Trade Center was that

the destruction was contained with
in Tower 1. The concourse was dam
aged but Building 5, where the
precinct was fine, Building 4 was
fine, so everything around the tower
complex, you were in a safe environ
ment. The only time when I foresaw

us entering a danger
area was when we got
into Tower 1 and start
ed up a level. That's
when I perceived the
threat. We wouldn't
have gone in if we knew
if the building was going
to collapse. First of all,
they wouldn't have
allowed us. Secondly, I
wouldn't have lead men
into a building where I
knew a hundred and ten
stories would fall down.
Q: When you were in
the rubble, did you
know the building
had collapsed?

JM: No, I thought it
had been a car bomb that had
blown in the lobby towards us. It
was only after I was in a coma for
six weeks, after I had been in ICU
without a television or radio that I
started seeing the television pro
grams. I learned then that the tow
ers had collapsed, but also I
learned of our loses and the
friends I lost that day.
