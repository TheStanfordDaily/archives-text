WTC Survivor & Wife
ENTERTAINMENT: When was the
first time you saw the movie?
JOHN MCLOUGHUN: About three
weeks ago in New York, at a private
screening room. It was just myself, my
wife and the Jimeno's.
Q: So you still keep in touch with them
since everything happened?
JM: Oh yes, we're very close. I actually
didn't know him very well before. I was
one of the supervisors at the bus terminal,
and he was an officer. As a matter of fact,
I had to ask him at a certain point what his
first name was instead of calling him
Jimeno all the time. I thought would be
nice to call him by his first name consider
ing the circumstances.
Q: Did you have any reservations when
you heard that Oliver Stone was going to
direct the film?
JM: 1 never had any apprehension. I was I
honored that he wanted to do the project.
There is a man who is very good at his job.
He had all the main characters that play
police officers go out of patrol with our
police officers at the bus terminal. Nicolas
Cage went out with one of sergeants to
get a feel what it was like to be a police
officer. There's a feeling of, "instead of a
Hollywood police officer, let's get it like
how officers really are."
Q: When you were first approached
about doing this story, how did you feel
about having to relive this day in order to
have the script done?
DONNA MCLOUGHLIN: Very emo
tional. That was a decision that the four of
us had to make together. But if anybody
felt uncomfortable, we'd never have done
it. But especially with Will [Jimeno] and
John, the reasons they wanted to make
the film was not to center around us, but
to show who did what for us and to show
the goodness that came out that day.
