Actor, 'John McLoughiiri"

ENTERTAINMENT: Did you have any hesitation
about working with Oliver Stone on this film?
NICOLAS CAGE: I had no hesitation because 1
was coming off a sort of a six-month contemplation
period where I was literally trying to apply my skills
as an actor to something that would be healing in a
literal sense, almost like a therapy of sorts. I know
I've made genre films before that are lun and peo
ple can go to and relax to get their minds off of their
problems. But 1 wanted to something more cathar
tic. along the lines of "Leaving Las Vegas." So when
Oliver gave me the script, it felt like an answer to my
prayers. 1 knew right away that Oliver was going to
have to approach this as a song — in a sense — lor
the firemen and policemen who sacrificed them
selves. It's a verx accurate depiction of what
occurred, but it could not be in am way political or
Conspiratorial. He had to show the sacrifice that
these men and their families went through, I knew
this because of the wax the script as well as the Zeit
geist ol our country and What we went through on
that day. I don't think that there's any place in the
storx it) get political. It's about survival and courage.
Q: Did you talk to him about that?
NC: He knew. 1 would make jokes, like, you aren't
going to get too avant-garde with this? No. the
words he used were cinema veritae.
Q: Normally you play roles that are very physical.
What was is like to be in part that was limited to you
head?
NC: There were other pressures and challenges hav
ing to deal with not wanting to let John McLouglin,
a true hero, down and wanting to do a good job,
because it's "World Trade Center" directed by
Oliver Stone, which is a high pressure deal. But that
specifically was quite liberating because I didn't
have to think about where I had to move. I would go
inward. I went within and it helped me stimulate my
imagination to try to recreate in some small way
what John went through.
ENT: What did you have to do to prepare yourself
mentally lor this role?
NC: Well, it's so hard to talk about because it bor
ders on esoteric or spiritual feelings. I don't feel like
I can take credit lor it. I feel like I would get up in
the morning and 1 would go into my trance-like
meditative state and try to recall the letters of all the
children who wrote to their family members who
died at ground zero.' I would try to remember in mx
mind and go over them and I would try to find some
way to ask to answer the letters. It's wild. People on
the set would be like. "Nic's not communicating,
Nic's not talking." I would walk on set and would go
into my hole and would start trying
to call it up. How's that sound?
[Motioning and chuckling] My
publicist is over there going,
"whoa."
Q: Can you talk about the first
time you met John?

NC: I was very nervous. I had never
met anyone who had been tested to
that magnitude before. I went to his
house and he was very hospitable,
he made some great barbequed
shrimp and sat up late for every
one. He was very humble and put
everyone at ease. I remember ask
ing him, "Is there anything at all
that you want me to do, to get in
the movie?" And he said that he
wanted me to make sure that I was
thankful to the people who saved
his life and can't say thanks enough.
