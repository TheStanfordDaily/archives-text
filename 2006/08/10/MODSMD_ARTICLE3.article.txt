## Professor, wife sue online pharmaceuticals 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to shed light on the largely unregu
lated Internet market of drugs and pharmacies, struc
tural biology Prof. David McKay, and his wife,
Sheila, are suing a Colorado physician and an online
pharmacy for negligence and wrongful death one
year after their 19-year-old son committed suicide as
the result of a prescription given without a doctor
consultation.
John McKay had just finished his first year at
Stanford. The nationally recognized, four-year presi
dent of the Menlo-Atherton High School debate
team formed VOICES, a foundation to promote high
school debate during his first year at the University.
After his freshman year ended, McKay visited
the Web site usanetrx.com, which offers customers
the chance to obtain drugs "without the embarrass
ment of talking to a doctor." McKay purchased 90
capsules of an antidepressant, Prozac (also known as
fluoxetine), from the online pharmacy site. Dr.
Christian Hageseth of Colorado signed off on
McKay's order without a consultation, the suit
alleges. The Mississippi-based pharmacy filled the
prescription and shipped the order to McKay's home
in California.
McKay committed suicide on Aug. 2, 2005; he
died of carbon monoxide and alcohol poisoning. At
the time of his death, he had Prozac in his system.
In the first lawsuit of its kind, the parents are not
suing the drug's manufacturer, but rather the online
pharmacy and the doctor.
The spokesperson for the Web site named in the
suit referred all calls to the company's attorneys due
to the ongoing nature of the litigation; these lawyers
were not available for comment by press time.
Under the California Business and Professions
Code 2242.1, the state prohibits the prescription and
administration of a drug without a "good faith" prior
examination and medical indication.
The McKays are seeking to set a precedent that
both proves the damages due to the online pharmacy
and orders it shutdown. They hope this would allow
for the eventual closing of other online pharmacies
that are operating illegally.
