## Professor, wife sue online pharmaceuticals 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to shed light on the largely unregu
lated Internet market of drugs and pharmacies, struc
tural biology Prof. David McKay, and his wife,
Sheila, are suing a Colorado physician and an online
pharmacy for negligence and wrongful death one
year after their 19-year-old son committed suicide as
the result of a prescription given without a doctor
consultation.
John McKay had just finished his first year at
Stanford. The nationally recognized, four-year presi
dent of the Menlo-Atherton High School debate
team formed VOICES, a foundation to promote high
school debate during his first year at the University.
After his freshman year ended, McKay visited
the Web site usanetrx.com, which offers customers
the chance to obtain drugs "without the embarrass
ment of talking to a doctor." McKay purchased 90
capsules of an antidepressant, Prozac (also known as
fluoxetine), from the online pharmacy site. Dr.
Christian Hageseth of Colorado signed off on
McKay's order without a consultation, the suit
alleges. The Mississippi-based pharmacy filled the
prescription and shipped the order to McKay's home
in California.
McKay committed suicide on Aug. 2, 2005; he
died of carbon monoxide and alcohol poisoning. At
the time of his death, he had Prozac in his system.
In the first lawsuit of its kind, the parents are not
suing the drug's manufacturer, but rather the online
pharmacy and the doctor.
The spokesperson for the Web site named in the
suit referred all calls to the company's attorneys due
to the ongoing nature of the litigation; these lawyers
were not available for comment by press time.
Under the California Business and Professions
Code 2242.1, the state prohibits the prescription and
administration of a drug without a "good faith" prior
examination and medical indication.
The McKays are seeking to set a precedent that
both proves the damages due to the online pharmacy
and orders it shutdown. They hope this would allow
for the eventual closing of other online pharmacies
that are operating illegally.
The particular pharmacy McKay
used does not require a faxed or
mailed prescription from a licensed
physician, similar to most online phar
macies.
Most online pharmacies operate in
such a way that anyone can fill in a
questionnaire can fill out a form to get
whatever they want.
"I think the pharmacy thought that
the doctor had a license, but he was
making judgments solely on an online
form, with no medical history of the
patient," McKay said in an email.
"He literally filled out the blanks
in a short form, submitted information
for a valid credit card, and received the
prescription a couple days later by
Fed Ex,"he said. "I am sure he thought
that this was perfectly safe and he
could solve his own problems; he did
not appreciate the risks."
Further investigation has shown
Hageseth had a restricted medical
license and was prohibited from filling
prescriptions at the time.
Hageseth, who has since surren
dered his license, told the San Jose
Mercury News in March that he does
not feel responsible for the teen's
death.
"When somebody commits suicide
usually there are many factors," he
said.
Hageseth's defense attorney will
likely argue that the San Mateo
County cannot hold a doctor practic
ing in another state accountable for
negligence.
The McKay family hopes to aid in
the fight against online pharmacies
that reduce regulation and control of
drug distribution and use.
"We hope to establish a precedent
whereby if an online pharmacy sup
plies prescription drugs without a legal
prescription from a licensed physician,
they can be held accountable for the
consequences if there is a negative out
come, as there was in my son's case,"
McKay said.
The Food and Drug Administration
has published several articles over the
past few years indicating the increased
risk for suicide upon taking antidepres
sants such as Prozac. The inappropri
ate consultation, prescription and
administration of this drug can lead
down a dangerous road. Therefore
physicians and families must be able to
monitor patients during their use of
the drug.
McKay's parents did not have this
opportunity.
"Since he was able to get the pre
scription without interacting with any
medical professional, no one spoke to
him or to anyone in his family at any
time about possible risks or side
effects," McKay said. The FDA public
health advisory warns of the serious
risks of enhanced suicidal thought or
behavior during the early stages of use
of antidepressants of the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor class."
"My son was working at a debate
camp in Los Angeles and visiting his
friends in Minnesota for most of the
period he was in possession of the pre
scription, so the family had little
opportunity to observe him," McKay
added.
Since the filing of the McKay's
wrongful death lawsuit in federal court
in February, a preliminary hearing has
not yet been set for their case, but a
judge refused to dismiss criminal
charges Aug. 2.
