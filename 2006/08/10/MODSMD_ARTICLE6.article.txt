Stanford possible venue
for San Francisco 2016
Olympics bid

Stanford may soon be not only the
home of Olympic athletes, but the host
of the Olympics itself, if San Francisco's
bid for the 2016 Olympics continues.
The U.S. Olympic Committee
(USOC) narrowed its possible host-city
nominees for the 2016 Olympics to San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago,
July 26. The other two cities to have sub
mitted bids, Houston and Philadelphia,
were eliminated.
While the USOC selection process is
far from transparent, the group's vice
president disclosed that Chicago and San
Francisco offered elaborate waterfront
plans. Los Angeles has the advantage of
completed facilities (the city hosted the
games in 1932 and 1984).
Mayor Gavin Newsom boasted San
Francisco's "international appeal" in a
released statement. Although full plans
have not been disclosed, Stanford venues
are expected to be named for San
Francisco's facilities use, such as the
Avery Aquatics Center.
The USOC will not decide whether or
not to submit a bid until autumn, and a
U.S. nominee would not be announced
until the end of March. A final decision
on the 2016 Olympic city will be made in
October 2009.
Other cities expressing interest in
hosting the 2016 Olympics include
Rome, Milan, Madrid, Hamburg, Tokyo
and Fukuoka.

UC Merced suffers from
3.7 percent yield rate

Although the University of California
at Merced admitted 12,300 students for
fall 2006, only 458 responded with their
intent to register, a disappointing 3.7
yield rate for the young university. In
comparison, Stanford's yield rate was 69
percent the past year for the class of
2010.
Merced, which opened just last year in
California's Central Valley (and in the
middle of a cattle ranch), cost $500 mil
lion to build and open.
Administrators point to several fac
tors to explain the low matriculation,
nearly all of which concern the universi
ty's underdeveloped campus. Merced
only has three campus buildings, and no
local businesses, eateries or sports teams
as of yet. Soaring temperatures (regular
ly topping 100 in July and August) aren't
helping to attract students, either.
The administration, however, remains
optimistic about Merced's growth. Even
the low yield for this year doesn't detract
from one of their original intents in
opening the campus: drawing more stu
dents from the Central Valley into high
er education.
