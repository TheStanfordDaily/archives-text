# UNIVERSITY CONSTRUCTION
## Munger start postponed, roadwork continues 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES NEWS EDITOR 
Commuters going along Campus Drive have
found it to be more of a campus stop-and-go
recently, with the multi-phase construction of the
Munger Graduate Residences. Although the
actual residence buildings have yet to be started,
and have even been pushed back to a
winter/spring 2007 start, the project has required
a large amount of summer work.
"In general, the project is proceeding well,"
said Mark Bonino, project manager for Munger
Housing. Although the residences' construction
has been pushed back, Bonino added that
"Parking Structure 6 (PS 6), the house relocation
and renovation and the utility and roadway ele
ments of the project are progressing as expect
ed."
Among the roadway elements of the project
are lane reconfigurations on Campus Drive East
between Escondido Road and Arguello Way.
The two eastbound lanes are currently serving
two-way traffic.
The intersection of Campus Drive East and
Escondido Road has been a particularly heavy
construction and commuter traffic area because
of the lane reconfigurations. However, to allevi
ate traffic for the peak morning and evening com
mute hours, traffic control officers have been sta
tioned there.
More concern arises, though, with the acade
mic year rapidly approaching, and in particular,
move-in day.
"The project team has taken move-in day into
consideration when planning construction activi
ty," Bonino said. "The lane reconfiguration cur
rently in place on Campus Drive East is expected
to be removed by the beginning of school to min
imize traffic disruption. There will continue to be
a one-lane reduction on Campus Drive East adja
cent to PS 6 to provide a staging area for con
struction. The staging area is not expected to
have a significant impact on traffic."
Bonino added that finish work for the utility
project is planned to occur through October.
Some may worry then about the continued
construction during the school year, with the
work requiring "heavy equipment, saw cutting,
jack hammering, and the demolition and removal
of asphalt," but Bonino assures that noise issues
are being considered.
"The general hours of construction are limited

to between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. to reduce the impact
of noise," he said. "In addition, the project team
has been working with Student Housing to
address noise issues and impacts to students."
As for the rest of the summer, much more
work is expected. Through tomorrow, work is
being done to complete the curb and sidewalk on
the north side of Campus Drive between
Arguello Way and Lane A. There is intermittent,
one-way traffic control at Lane A during the
activity. Also through tomorrow, Arguello Way
will be closed to all vehicle, pedestrian and bicy
cle traffic.
Following that, tree relocation activity begins
Monday, and will run through Sept. 1. Trees from
the Frost Amphitheater staging area will be
transplanted to the Bechtel International Center,
Mirrielees parking lot and Wilbur parking lot.
Other on-going work for the summer includes
the construction of PS 6, which is experiencing
excavation work and the construction of perime
ter wall support, as well as further house restora
tion and utilities and roadway activity, Bonino
said.
He also added that "the public has been
patient and cooperative during construction,"
and those interested in the project's status and
on-going construction should visit its Web site,
mungerhousing.stanford.edu, which is updated
weekly. A project e-mail list is also available for
subscription to receive advisories of major con
struction activity.
Among other advisories and updates available
on the Web site are the following:
• Because the construction of Munger has been
postponed, the Stern and Law School parking
lots will remain open until winter or spring 2007.
• For the Tressider "A" Parking lot, the driveway
entering from Lagunita Drive is nearing comple
tion, but all traffic must continue to enter and exit
from Mayfield Avenue. Sidewalk and utility
work, as well as the building of a trash enclosure
will require a further six weeks.
• The temporary Stern/Wilbur parking lot has
begun construction, with the removal of the bas
ketball courts and landscaping. The basketball
court will be restored at the north end of the field
as the parking lot is built. Work is expected to be
finished later this month.
• Work including interior finishes and parking lot
configuration continues through September on
relocated houses, such as Serra and Drell, which
are expected to reopen this fall.

A lane reconfiguration on Campus Drive between Escondido Road and Arguello Way has left the east
bound lanes serving slowed two-way traffic. Lanes are expected to return to normal by move-in day.
