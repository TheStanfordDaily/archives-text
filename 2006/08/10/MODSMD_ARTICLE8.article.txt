# STUDENT COMPUTING
## Thieves "phish" for students 
### HUNTER BARNS 
A recent survey by CompUSA showed that a majority
of college students do not follow good computer security
practices — in spite of the fact that 88 percent of college
students keep sensitive information for bank accounts and
credit cards, as well as driver's license and Social Security
numbers on their PCs and laptops.
The survey, released in early July, aimed to gauge how
susceptible student populations were to phishing. Forty
one percent of respondents, though, did not even know
what phishing is.
According to Andy Solterbeck, vice president and gen
eral manager of the Commercial Enterprise Business Unit
at Safe Net, Inc., phishing is "when someone who is pre
tending to be a trustworthy source attempts to acquire sen
sitive data or personal identity information, which could
include credit card information, account usernames, pass
words, or social security numbers. This is usually done
over the Internet, through e-mail, instant message or pop
up messages."
Phishing e-mails include the less believable request for
one's bank account number so that an alleged "distant rel
ative's attorney" can deposit $25,000,000 into one's
account, along with the more convincing, such as those
that appear to be from major banking corporations,
requesting verification of account information, a password
or personal information.
According to the CompUSA survey, nine percent of
college students admitted to responding to such emails,
and another 21 percent said they had given or had been
tempted to give sensitive personal information over the
Internet when they weren't confident in the security of the
Web site.
Solterbeck, however, offered definitive advice for deal
ing with uncertain Internet communication.
"The most apparent sign that an email or pop-up mes
sage is fraudulent is simply if it asks for personal or finan
cial information," he said. "Legitimate companies will not
ask for this information via e-mail. If you aren't sure if the
e-mail sender is the company they say they are, call the
company on a phone number that you know to be true and
verify that the e-mail came from them. Also, be cautious
when downloading any files from e-mails, or opening
attachments; avoid it if possible."
In addition to avoiding e-mails requesting personal
information, CompUSA listed several precautions for
avoiding identity theft, such as changing banking and other
passwords regularly, locking laptops and cell phones when
unattended, and having credit card or billing statements
sent home, not to a school address.
Identity theft occurs from mistakes in such areas, and
even on Stanford's secure network. A rising sophomore

who preferred to remain anonymous recently experienced
identity theft via the University's Axess Web site.
"Someone, somehow, gained access to my Stanford
Axess account and set up direct deposit without my knowl
edge," the student said. "I found out in July when I tried to
collect my first paycheck of the summer. The money was
tracked to a bank account in Arizona. I knew that my per
sonal information security had been compromised, so I
had the payroll people shut down direct deposit, and they
recalled the money. I got my paycheck about a week later,
but of course 1 had my credit checked."
The student said the incident has yet to be completely
resolved, but the security breach was corrected.
"The Stanford IT people were great," the student said.
"After I got in touch with them, they shut down my Axess
account for the weekend and reset my password. My lap
top was also examined. I can tell that Stanford takes the
electronic security of its network very seriously."
Solterbeck also recommends, though, that colleges uti
lize a "two-factor authentication, which is a combination
of something physical — a token, the modern-day equiva
lent of a key for your computer — combined with the stan
dard login procedures, your password.
"To put it in another way, proper two-factor authenti
cation includes both something you have and something
you know," Solterbeck added.
Stanford does not require such physical keys to gain
access to secure areas such as webmail or Axess, with the
only requirements being a SUNet ID and password.
In a changing world of easier access and communica
tion, Solterbeck recommends the similar rapid develop
ment of security measures to protect students. He encour
aged talking to University leaders, who "can make a real
difference and save you from identity theft."
"The survey confirms the growing vulnerabilities that
exist on college and university campuses," Solterbeck said.
"These vulnerabilities will only worsen if the implementa
tion of better information security at the university-wide
level is not made a priority. Today, electronic services such
as e-mail, instant message and online banking are the stan
dard forms of communications for students. Students need
to be educated on not only what to do if they fall victim to
phishing or identity theft, but also on how to proactively pro
tect themselves before cyber thieves get the best of them."
Increased cases of identity theft have led the Office of
the Inspector General at the U.S. Department of
Education to establish a Web site, www.ed.gov/misused,
dedicated to informing students and parents about identi
ty theft. Victims of identity theft can contact the Office of
the Inspector General's Identity Theft hotline at 1-800-
MIS-USED. Additionally, the Stanford Residential
Computing Security Web site is available at
