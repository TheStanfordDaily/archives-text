## Summer at Stanford Appreciate the litthe things: squirrels, wildflowers, people and life 
### 
If you think fall through spring is
beautiful at Stanford, then you
will or are being blown away by
the summer. 1 can't think of any
where I'd rather be in the summer.
If you're not here, or if you are,
here are some things you're either
missing or enjoying:
Baby Squirrels
The main types of squirrels at
Stanford are the grey and black
squirrels, and then California
ground squirrels.
California ground squirrels are
one of my favorite aspects of
Stanford. I'd never seen them
before 1 came here, and I had to
look them up online to find out what
they were.
They're the speckled squirrels
you see by Lake Lagunita and the
path to the
Dish. I used to think they looked
like sea monsters or daschunds,
because compared with the other
squirrels on campus, their bodies
often seem long and close to the
ground.
If you hear high-pitched peeps
when you're near Lake Lagunita, it
might be a squirrel, not a bird.
Ground squirrels make a shrill
alarm cry if they're alarmed. You
might also hear them clicking at you
from the entrances to their burrows.

The squirrels mate from
February to April and give birth one
month later, but the babies don't
emerge for eight weeks, meaning
that they've appeared only recently.
You'll be able to see tiny squirrels
for a while, but they grow quickly.
Wildflowers
While you'll get to see many
flowers on campus in the spring,
there are many that seem to reach
their peak in the summer.
Right now, in August, the inner
quad circles are overrun with enor
mous bushes of lantana, a shrub-like
plant with "flowers" that are actual
ly clusters of many tiny flowers.
Spanish colonists used lantana
for medicine, and in Sinaloa,
Mexico, people use lantana as a
remedy for snake bites. The leaves
and unripe berries are toxic to live
stock and pets.
I was looking at some of the
flower clusters, or umbrels, yester
day. There are so many different
colors and combinations: red and

pink; orange and yellow together,
and so on.
If you're interested in the names
of other flowers on campus, check
out the Stanford Grounds Services
web site and look under
Horticultural Topics: Plants in
Flower. The page lists the plants in
flower in each month and their loca
tions.
According to the Web site, in
August and September, one can see
flowering Floss Silk Trees at the
post office, inner quad, and clock
tower. The Tropical Plants Library
Online page says that the native
Brazilian and Argentinian tree is
often rated as one of the most beau
tiful in the world. It has pink and
white five-petaled flowers which
turn into fruits with a silky floss after
being fertilized.
The trees with bright pink or
white delicate flower clusters are
crape myrtles, the longest blooming
trees in existence today, with flower
ing periods from two to four
months. There are many white
crapes near Vaden Health Center
and pink crapes at Galvez St.
between Serra Mall and Campus
Drive.
For the flowers alone, summer
really is one of the best times to sec

People under the age of 18
If you haven't been at Stanford
in the summer, you'd be amazed by
what happens here. The average
height of people at Stanford must
fall by a foot or two, and the aver
age amount of cheering rises by
hundreds of cheering-hours per day.
There are sports camps, academic
camps, Education Program for
Gifted Youth (EPGY), and even
SuperCamp.
Last summer, I lived in Crothers-
Memorial, across the parking lot
from SuperCamp at Toyon Hall.
Early in the morning my roommate
and I would be awakened by cheers
of "I feel good. Oh I feel so good.
Oh I feel so Oh I feel so Oh I feel so
good, oh oh oh!" Once you've
heard it, you never forget it. How
do you feel?
All in all, at Stanford in the sum
mer, one can't help but feel good.
With nearly cloudless skies, almost
rainless weather, and beautiful
plants and flowers, the campus is
like paradise. I almost wonder why
Stanford doesn't designate winter as
the vacation quarter and let people
take more academic courses during
the summer. I'd much rather leave
Stanford during its rainy winters
(perhaps to work or travel in
warmer locales) than to miss a
minute of summer at Stanford.
