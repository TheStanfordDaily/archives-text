## Michael Wilkerson Among the Bribesmen A 						day with the corrupt but brilliant officials of modern Uganda 
### 
Kigali, Uganda — "Democracy is not a gift from rulers. It is a result of struggle by
the ruled." These were the words of my surrogate father in Uganda, journalist
Andrew Mwenda, while he was in prison exactly a year ago this week, for criticizing
Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni. Along with jailing Andrew for a weekend on sedition
charges, the government also temporarily closed the newspaper I am writing from, the Daily
Monitor, and its sister radio station, to punish Andrew's impudence.

In Uganda and other developing coun
tries, governments who claim to be democra
tic tend to discard either by intention or by
ignorance the social contract theory on which
modern democracy is based. The idea, first
propounded by philosophers Thomas
Hobbes, John Locke and Jean Jacques
Rousseau, is that government enters into a
contract with its constituents where by taking
power it agrees to protect their rights. If it
fails then it has breached the contract and the
people have the right to overthrow the gov
ernment and find a new one.
A consistent quality among African rulers
like Museveni is that, when they decide to do
something good for their people, they portray
it as a result of their own magnanimity — a
"gift" people should be grateful for rather
than an obligation of being in power. Whether
a road, a hospital or even a military that is not
(completely) out of control, Museveni refers
to these accomplishments as "mine" and
expects to receive appropriate accolades. He
uses power as a personal entitlement by which
whimsically dole out favors from cabinet
appointments, road construction projects and
even free allocations of public land to foreign
investor friends. But despite the long deficit,
there is at least one country in East Africa
where the social contract not only exists, but
may be crucial for survival: Rwanda.
Rwanda's history of ethnic conflict and its
tenuous peace have combined to create an
environment where the government must
deliver services to its people. Crucial to this
equation is the fact that President Paul
Kagame, and many in his administration are
from the Tutsi ethnic group, a significant
minority in the mostly Hutu country. After
the 1994 genocide, which was perpetrated
primarily by the Hutus against the minority
Tutsi, and a protracted civil war, Kagame's

Tutsi-led RPF came to power. One of the
underlying factors in the genocide was the
fact that the Tutsi had been traditionally
favored by colonial rulers and held positions
of power resented by the subjected Hutus.
When the Hutus finally gained control of
the government mid-century, many Tutsi
were forced to flee and a number — including
Kagame — grew up outside of the country in
places like Uganda and Tanzania, eventually
leading a resistance movement that began in
Uganda where Kagame was the director of
military intelligence in the Ugandan army.
The Hutu administration started the genocide
using old stereotypes and the threat of this
resistance as an excuse for mass killing.
Constantly disgusted with Museveni's pat
rimonial rule, Andrew Mwenda is also the
one who insisted that I visit the neighboring
country of Rwanda with him, to see that
African governments could be different. For
many, especially in the U.S., Rwanda still has
connotations of death and destruction, a lin
gering effect of the 1994 genocide. The coun
try is rightfully notorious for the scope of the
killing that took place there, and for the dis
graceful way the international community
turned a blind eye to the disaster. But for
Andrew, and a growing number in East
Africa, Rwanda is taking on a new meaning.
It is a bright spot among the many corrupt
and ineffective African governments, a place
where government performs for the good of
the people with tangible results. Because
once again the leadership of Rwanda is large
ly composed of Tutsi, those in power feel an
enormous pressure to do a good job, to justi
fy that they are in power because of merit
regardless of ethnic labels.
"These people are serious," Andrew told
me about the Rwandan government, which
has come a long way in rebuilding the coun

try under the leadership of President Paul
Kagame. "Wait until you see their roads."
The progress in Rwanda was foreshadowed
as we left Kampala via the Ugandan airport in
Entebbe. As the engines of our Rwandan Air
flight started on the runway, Andrew nudged
my shoulder. "Check you watch," he said. The
plane was leaving exactly on time, something
unheard of for most flights out of Entebbe. We
even arrived in Kigali early.
Sure enough, Rwanda's capital was a far
cry from the disorganized destitution I'd
become used to in Kampala. The roads are all
paved, without the potholes that challenge
even the most rugged off-road vehicles. Even
more impressive, nearly all of the streets,
even the road to the airport, are accompanied
with wide sidewalks, making walking from
one place to another not only possible, but
safe. In Uganda, a pedestrian journey entails
dirt (walking in nice clothes is unadvisable),
and the danger of getting hit by a car is high.
Even more telling is a fundamental differ
ence in attitude. In Uganda, one government
official summed up their ruling philosophy to
me as "it's cheaper for us to give someone a
Land Rover than to deploy soldiers." The
government would rather buy off people it
disagrees with or perceives as a threat than
resolve whatever their grievances are.
Corruption is rampant because it is used as a
tool; the president allows members of the
administration to grab spoils in return for
loyalty which matters more than the delivery
of services to the citizens of the country.
Rwanda cannot afford such misuse of
power and its leaders know it. Kagame recent
ly recalled all government vehicles so that
everyone, including civil servants would be
more responsible and accountable for their
costs. "It's about priorities," said one govern
ment employee, "When you are not wasting

all this money on government vehicles, there
is enough for health and education."
Other programs include expanding
national health insurance system, affordable
housing and loans for government employees
— designed to give them a stake in the coun
try, through which the prospect of grabbing a
bunch of money and disappearing becomes a
less appealing move. Even more importantly,
the government feels a responsibility to the
people. "How can you claim to be busy if you
are not serving the people you are supposed
to be serving," replied another official when
asked if the government was accessible. And
there is also accountability. Those who do
not perform or are found to be corrupt are
punished and even some close to Kagame
have been jailed. '"So what' doesn't work in
Rwanda," the official said.
There is serious criticism that Rwanda is
not democratic, and that Kagame is a dicta
tor. Some of it is justified. The media is still
kept extremely weak — largely because of
"It's cheaper for us to give
someone a Land Rover than
to deploy soldiers."
fear that it could increase tensions as it
helped escalate the original genocide — and
Kagame holds an extreme amount of power.
But at the same time, the laws require that 50
percent of cabinet appointments come from
outside the ruling party. Kagame recognizes
that cannot and should not last forever and is
trying to build the institutions to secure the
progress after he leaves.
This article is not about the genocide.
Enough has been written about that atrocity.
But ten years on, it is no longer necessary to
shed new tears for Rwanda. The lack of cor
ruption and determined attitude of the gov
ernment mean progress can not only contin
ue, but must. A government that delivers
may be the only thing holding the country
together and it might take only a small push
to restart the violence. As sad as it may be,
the genocide seems to have jumpstarted
effective governance in Rwanda and reintro
duced the social contract rather than democ
racy as a "gift from the rulers."

whimsically dole out favors from cabinet
appointments, road construction projects and
even free allocations of public land to foreign
investor friends. But despite the long deficit,
there is at least one country in East Africa
where the social contract not only exists, but
may be crucial for survival: Rwanda.
Rwanda's history of ethnic conflict and its
tenuous peace have combined to create an
environment where the government must
deliver services to its people. Crucial to this
equation is the fact that President Paul
Kagame, and many in his administration are
from the Tutsi ethnic group, a significant
minority in the mostly Hutu country. After
the 1994 genocide, which was perpetrated
primarily by the Hutus against the minority
Tutsi, and a protracted civil war, Kagame's

Tutsi-led RPF came to power. One of the
underlying factors in the genocide was the
fact that the Tutsi had been traditionally
favored by colonial rulers and held positions
of power resented by the subjected Hutus.
When the Hutus finally gained control of
the government mid-century, many Tutsi
were forced to flee and a number — including
Kagame — grew up outside of the country in
places like Uganda and Tanzania, eventually
leading a resistance movement that began in
Uganda where Kagame was the director of
military intelligence in the Ugandan army.
The Hutu administration started the genocide
using old stereotypes and the threat of this
resistance as an excuse for mass killing.
Constantly disgusted with Museveni's pat
rimonial rule, Andrew Mwenda is also the
one who insisted that I visit the neighboring
country of Rwanda with him, to see that
African governments could be different. For
many, especially in the U.S., Rwanda still has
connotations of death and destruction, a lin
gering effect of the 1994 genocide. The coun
try is rightfully notorious for the scope of the
killing that took place there, and for the dis
graceful way the international community
turned a blind eye to the disaster. But for
Andrew, and a growing number in East
Africa, Rwanda is taking on a new meaning.
It is a bright spot among the many corrupt
and ineffective African governments, a place
where government performs for the good of
the people with tangible results. Because
once again the leadership of Rwanda is large
ly composed of Tutsi, those in power feel an
enormous pressure to do a good job, to justi
fy that they are in power because of merit
regardless of ethnic labels.
"These people are serious," Andrew told
me about the Rwandan government, which
has come a long way in rebuilding the coun

try under the leadership of President Paul
Kagame. "Wait until you see their roads."
The progress in Rwanda was foreshadowed
as we left Kampala via the Ugandan airport in
Entebbe. As the engines of our Rwandan Air
flight started on the runway, Andrew nudged
my shoulder. "Check you watch," he said. The
plane was leaving exactly on time, something
unheard of for most flights out of Entebbe. We
even arrived in Kigali early.
Sure enough, Rwanda's capital was a far
cry from the disorganized destitution I'd
become used to in Kampala. The roads are all
paved, without the potholes that challenge
even the most rugged off-road vehicles. Even
more impressive, nearly all of the streets,
even the road to the airport, are accompanied
with wide sidewalks, making walking from
one place to another not only possible, but
safe. In Uganda, a pedestrian journey entails
dirt (walking in nice clothes is unadvisable),
and the danger of getting hit by a car is high.
Even more telling is a fundamental differ
ence in attitude. In Uganda, one government
official summed up their ruling philosophy to
me as "it's cheaper for us to give someone a
Land Rover than to deploy soldiers." The
government would rather buy off people it
disagrees with or perceives as a threat than
resolve whatever their grievances are.
Corruption is rampant because it is used as a
tool; the president allows members of the
administration to grab spoils in return for
loyalty which matters more than the delivery
of services to the citizens of the country.
Rwanda cannot afford such misuse of
power and its leaders know it. Kagame recent
ly recalled all government vehicles so that
everyone, including civil servants would be
more responsible and accountable for their
costs. "It's about priorities," said one govern
ment employee, "When you are not wasting

all this money on government vehicles, there
is enough for health and education."
Other programs include expanding
national health insurance system, affordable
housing and loans for government employees
— designed to give them a stake in the coun
try, through which the prospect of grabbing a
bunch of money and disappearing becomes a
less appealing move. Even more importantly,
the government feels a responsibility to the
people. "How can you claim to be busy if you
are not serving the people you are supposed
to be serving," replied another official when
asked if the government was accessible. And
there is also accountability. Those who do
not perform or are found to be corrupt are
punished and even some close to Kagame
have been jailed. '"So what' doesn't work in
Rwanda," the official said.
There is serious criticism that Rwanda is
not democratic, and that Kagame is a dicta
tor. Some of it is justified. The media is still
kept extremely weak — largely because of
"It's cheaper for us to give
someone a Land Rover than
to deploy soldiers."
fear that it could increase tensions as it
helped escalate the original genocide — and
Kagame holds an extreme amount of power.
But at the same time, the laws require that 50
percent of cabinet appointments come from
outside the ruling party. Kagame recognizes
that cannot and should not last forever and is
trying to build the institutions to secure the
progress after he leaves.
This article is not about the genocide.
Enough has been written about that atrocity.
But ten years on, it is no longer necessary to
shed new tears for Rwanda. The lack of cor
ruption and determined attitude of the gov
ernment mean progress can not only contin
ue, but must. A government that delivers
may be the only thing holding the country
together and it might take only a small push
to restart the violence. As sad as it may be,
the genocide seems to have jumpstarted
effective governance in Rwanda and reintro
duced the social contract rather than democ
racy as a "gift from the rulers."

Kigali, Uganda — "Democracy is not a gift from rulers. It is a result of struggle by
the ruled." These were the words of my surrogate father in Uganda, journalist
Andrew Mwenda, while he was in prison exactly a year ago this week, for criticizing
Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni. Along with jailing Andrew for a weekend on sedition
charges, the government also temporarily closed the newspaper I am writing from, the Daily
Monitor, and its sister radio station, to punish Andrew's impudence.

In Uganda and other developing coun
tries, governments who claim to be democra
tic tend to discard either by intention or by
ignorance the social contract theory on which
modern democracy is based. The idea, first
propounded by philosophers Thomas
Hobbes, John Locke and Jean Jacques
Rousseau, is that government enters into a
contract with its constituents where by taking
power it agrees to protect their rights. If it
fails then it has breached the contract and the
people have the right to overthrow the gov
ernment and find a new one.
A consistent quality among African rulers
like Museveni is that, when they decide to do
something good for their people, they portray
it as a result of their own magnanimity — a
"gift" people should be grateful for rather
than an obligation of being in power. Whether
a road, a hospital or even a military that is not
(completely) out of control, Museveni refers
to these accomplishments as "mine" and
expects to receive appropriate accolades. He
uses power as a personal entitlement by which
whimsically dole out favors from cabinet
appointments, road construction projects and
even free allocations of public land to foreign
investor friends. But despite the long deficit,
there is at least one country in East Africa
where the social contract not only exists, but
