## Flying the safe skies Daily columnist ponders new security measures in the hour before a flight to Istanbul, Turkey 
### SINI MATIKAINEN COLUMNIST 
As you may or may not have heard, there has
been a recent shake-up in the air travel industry.
After finding out that the recent terrorist plot to
blow up transatlantic flights was stopped in time,
the immediate sense of relief quickly turned into
concern about our safety on airlines, how to bal
ance security with convenience and how air travel
is feasible in this new era of terror.
So with all of these grave concerns facing us, I
think the foremost worry on everyone's mind is,
"Yes, but what's going to happen to Sini's laptop?"
At least, if you think at all like my mom, it is.
Other people might fear a terrible, fiery death, but
my mom always keeps her eyes on the prize/laptop.
The U.S. authorities, unlike British airlines, have
not banned electronic devices, but according to her
logic, there is no telling what will happen in the com
ing weeks. And the situation is already bad enough,
with the current ban on non-solid forms of matter,
which (in all seriousness) led to an in-depth argu
ment with my mother about the physical state of
various objects. While we could more or less agree
on butter (though I hedged by saying it was a 'semi
solid'), I had a hard time working up the indignation
my mom felt about the classification of lipstick.
"Lipstick!" she said. "Women have had to
throw away $60 tubes of lipstick! Lipstick isn't a
liquid! And wine," my mom added in a tone of hor
ror. "Expensive wine."
"Well, I guess I'll have to leave the Beaujolais in
Helsinki," 1 said. "But I'm fairly sure that my lap
top is classified as a solid."

"But maybe they won't let you take laptops on
board anymore. And then you'll just have to throw
it away at security! In the trash! Like a used tis
sue!"
"Couldn't I just check it in?"
"But all your bags will be checked in."
"Won't I have a laptop bag?"
"What if you travel without one? What will you
do then?"
"Um... Are you suggesting that I might go the
airport sans computer bag, with my laptop tucked
rakishly under my arm?"
"I hear that's the fashion in London," my Dad
said. "That's why they had to throw them all away
instead of checking them in."
"Maybe some entrepreneur will take advantage
of the situation to start buying laptops off people at
airport security for $100 a pop," my brother sug
gested.
"Airport security would never allow that to
happen," I objected. "I think Mom's right. The
way things are going, they're just going to take the
laptop from you and smash it with a hammer.
Right in front of you. With a hammer. It's for
everyone's safety."
"If there's a bomb inside the laptop, wouldn't
that be counterproductive?"
"The important thing is that people feel reas
sured," I said.
But anyway, we all agreed that my laptop will
either have to be checked in and freeze in the
cargo compartment, then leak battery acid over all
of my earthly possessions, or it will be smashed to
pieces right in front of me.
Not that I'm maligning the Department of

Homeland Security or the airport security guards
in any way. When dealing with a threat as insidious
and sly as the current terrorists are employing,
every effort must be made to protect passengers
against the threat, including forcing people to
dump out all of their potentially volatile and explo
sive liquids in one huge barrel in the middle of the
airport. And this is a position I would firmly
defend whether or not I believed that the
Department of Homeland Security uses the
Internet to find dissidents and add their names to
the list of those who have to be strip-searched
when they go through airport security.
And I have to say, I think that everything will
turn out all right. Hopefully they won't ban elec
tronic devices, but if they do, maybe I'll take the
advice of that nice Justin Long on the Apple com
mercials and finally switch over after my PC is
destroyed. (I hear Macs are hammer-proof.
They're really better than PC's in every way.) And
for the benefit of anyone in the current adminis
tration, who might have come across this article
while searching the Internet for the words "bomb,"
"explosive," and "airline," I say: thank you for
your dedication. And despite my funny name, I am
a fully patriotic American citizen, who most cer
tainly does not need to be put on the airport secu
rity black list.

Sini wrote this in the first flush of anxiety after the
thwarted attacks and sent it an hour before leaving on
a trip, so restrictions might have changed in the
meantime. Worry about her laptop, however, will
always remain. You can e-mail her at Sinim@stan
