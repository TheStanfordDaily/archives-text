## What happened with Galvan? University must be up front with truth about resignation and investigation 
### 
The University community has a right to
know about the circumstances surrounding
the Aug. 8 announced resignation of
Agustin Galvan as assistant director of Student
Management in Residential Education. Few
would talk openly to The Stanford Weekly about
the clouded departure of the once-popular official,
and this sets a troubling precedent for the open
ness of information that this newspaper strives for
and expects.
The University has a responsibility to be up
front and open when its officials are implicated in
wrongdoing. In this case, Galvan allegedly used his
influence as a representative of the University to
influence student leaders and admittedly earned
weekend 'perks' at Lake Tahoe cabins (see 'Snow
trip perks raise questions,' May 3).
Director of Residential Education and Student
Affairs Jane Camarillo refused to provide impor
tant details about whether there was an investiga
tion, as well as what the investigation did or did
not conclude. She justified the potential cover up
of important information under the guise of priva
cy. If Galvan did something wrong, why not admit
it to the students who were unduly pressured? If
he was innocent, why not vigorously defend him
and clear his name?
Was Galvan forced out? No one will say. Is his
resignation primarily due to the ski trip scandal?
What were the terms of his departure? Did he vio
late the Fundamental Standard? We don't know.
As much as the University would like to handle
this discretely and privately, there are important
questions that must be answered.
It's true that the University is a private institu
tion. It's true that personnel matters can some

times be complex, and there are sometimes valid
justifications for keeping some information pri
vate. But this is a public figure engaging in public
behavior in the name of the University. Stanford
stakeholders, and the Stanford community,
deserve transparency, and they deserve answers
from school officials.
If there was wrongdoing, what precautions are
being taken to prevent these kinds of payola
schemes in the future? Will there be clearer lan
guage established for what constitutes a conflict of
interest? There are shades of gray about what
might and might not be acceptable. Are the
University's lawyers going to revise guidelines so
that there is consistency and clarity in the rules?
The Daily broke the snow trip story in May,
and it's important that we follow up. Our role as a
newspaper is as a watchdog, and this situation
needs to be watched.
Respectfully,
