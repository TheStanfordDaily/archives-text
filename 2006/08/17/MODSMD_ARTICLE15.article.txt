Representatives from both the Stanford
men's and women's swimming teams finished
strongly at the 2006 USA Swimming National

Stanford swimmers managed to shine.
On the men's side, senior Ben Wildman-
Tobriner turned out the strongest performance,
taking second place in the 50-meter freestyle
with a time of 22.16. It was a tight contest until
the very end, when Cullen Jones, a recent grad
uate of North Carolina State, edged ahead and
won the race at 21.94, the world's fastest time
this year. Wildman-Tobriner also nabbed
fourth in the 100-meter freestyle.
Senior Hongzhe Sun finished fourth in the
200-meter, clocking in at 2:00.59. Sun won the
event in the Pacific-10 Conference and claimed
second place at the NCAA's earlier this year,
but could not bring down the five-time defend
ing champion Aaron Piersol.
Sophomores Paul Kornfeld and Paul Zaich
swam well in the 200-meter breaststroke, tak
ing ninth and 15th, respectively. Kornfeld also
finished 14th in the 100-meter breaststroke
while another sophomore, Nate Cass, nailed
17th.
Stanford swimmers overran the 200-meter
freestyle finals, with 2005 graduate Jayme
Cramer placing fifth, senior Shaun Phillips
placing seventh, senior Andy Grant placing
14th, and junior Daniel Beal rounding out the
pack at 16th. Phillips later went on to finish

sixth in the 400-meter freestyle.
Recent Stanford graduates led the women
swimmers, with 2004 graduate Tara Kirk cap
turing a victory in the 200-meter breaststroke
at 2:28.46. Kirk also tied for second in the 100-
meter breaststroke at 1:07.65. Kristen Caverly,
who graduated this past June, placed third in
the 200-meter breaststroke at 2:29.39, and 10th

in the 200-meter IM.
Junior Brooke Bishop took fourth in the
100-meter backstroke at 1:02.20 and eighth in
the 50-meter freestyle at 25.71. She also won
the bonus finals of the 100-meter freestyle at
56.37, earning 17th place overall. Sophomore
Caroline Bruce won the bonus final for the
100-meter breaststroke at 1:11.65, also winning

17th place.
The incoming freshmen delivered a very
promising performance. Julia Smit took sixth
in both the 2(X)-meter IM and the 200-meter
backstroke while claiming eighth in the 100-
meter backstroke. Fellow freshman Elaine
Breeden placed seventh in both the 100 and
200-meter fly.
