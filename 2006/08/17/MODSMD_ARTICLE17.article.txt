## Senior golfer takes second at tournament 
### JENNA COALSON SPORTS EDITOR 
Senior Stanford golfer Matt Savage took
second place in the 40th Pacific Coast
Amateur Championship this Aug. 1-4.
Savage finished the four round tournament
with a total of 286 + 3, falling just one shot
short of champion Patrick Nagle of Pacifica,
CA.
Savage both started and finished the tour
nament strongly, going two under par 69 in
the opening round to share the lead. He
struggled in the second round, golfing a six

over par 76, and took a one over par 72 in the
third. His performance started out shaky in
the final round, as he made bogeys on three
of the first five holes, but he made up for it on
the front side with five birdies coming in.
Savage was the only golfer in the tournament
to score under par on the final day.
Unfortunately, the accomplishment was
not quite enough to take down leader Nagle,
a senior at the University of Illinois. A rough
bogey four on the 157-yard 15th hole took
away Savage's chances for a playoff, leaving
him one shot behind Nagle, who won with 285
+ 4 (70-73-69-73).
