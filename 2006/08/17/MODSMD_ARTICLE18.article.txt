## Dream summer in the east If you're not already in Washington, get here fast 
### 
I have spent my last few days fran
tically trying to enjoy every last
sunset of summer; well that, and
trolling Facebook trying to discover
who my future freshman are. Last
Friday, I moved out of the
Fraternity Houses at the University
of Maryland where I had spent my
summer with a bunch of NASA
interns (oh yes, it is just as fun as it
sounds).

So I have done some thinking
about this summer and how truly
amazing it was. When Vic asked for
articles this week, I thought all this
retrospection could be put to good
use and I could tell you all about my
summer —just kidding — you real
ly don't care how your former
Intermission editor spent her sum
mer. However. 1 thought that this
was an opportunity to tell you why
you should have spent your summer
in the nation's capital or least why
you should spend next summer
here.
Stanford has an amazing net
work of people, social events, and
activities in Washington, D.C. I
swear there are more Stanford
events going on here than in the
Bay Area. I went to a tribute to
Sandra Day O'Connor, a chat with
the White House Chief of Staff,
baseball, a meeting with the
National Security Advisor and 1
didn't do half the things that were
offered to me — one I wished I
hadn't missed was a check in on the
baby panda at the National Zoo.
There are always things going
on, and most of it is free. Whether it
was the reading of the Declaration
of Independence on the steps of
The Archives, a concert on the
Capitol lawn, movies on the Mall on
Monday nights, jazz at the National
Sculpture Garden every week (in
the winter you can ice skate here!)
or picking up your Library of
Congress card, all you had to do was
show up and know it is going on, 1
guess. And the Monuments offer a
great midnight walk or morning jog
