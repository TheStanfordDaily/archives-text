## Dream summer in the east If you're not already in Washington, get here fast 
### 
I have spent my last few days fran
tically trying to enjoy every last
sunset of summer; well that, and
trolling Facebook trying to discover
who my future freshman are. Last
Friday, I moved out of the
Fraternity Houses at the University
of Maryland where I had spent my
summer with a bunch of NASA
interns (oh yes, it is just as fun as it
sounds).

So I have done some thinking
about this summer and how truly
amazing it was. When Vic asked for
articles this week, I thought all this
retrospection could be put to good
use and I could tell you all about my
summer —just kidding — you real
ly don't care how your former
Intermission editor spent her sum
mer. However. 1 thought that this
was an opportunity to tell you why
you should have spent your summer
in the nation's capital or least why
you should spend next summer
here.
Stanford has an amazing net
work of people, social events, and
activities in Washington, D.C. I
swear there are more Stanford
events going on here than in the
Bay Area. I went to a tribute to
Sandra Day O'Connor, a chat with
the White House Chief of Staff,
baseball, a meeting with the
National Security Advisor and 1
didn't do half the things that were
offered to me — one I wished I
hadn't missed was a check in on the
baby panda at the National Zoo.
There are always things going
on, and most of it is free. Whether it
was the reading of the Declaration
of Independence on the steps of
The Archives, a concert on the
Capitol lawn, movies on the Mall on
Monday nights, jazz at the National
Sculpture Garden every week (in
the winter you can ice skate here!)
or picking up your Library of
Congress card, all you had to do was
show up and know it is going on, 1
guess. And the Monuments offer a
great midnight walk or morning jog

depending on what you're into.
One of my favorite moments this
summer happened almost by acci
dent. Having given up on seeing the
Shuttle Launch after the earlier
scrubs, 1 was at the Air and Space
Museum on the Fourth of July with
a crowd that filled one of the open
chambers aw-ing and oh-ing with
the countdown. Later that night, 1
found myself on the roof of a
George Washington University
building watching the fireworks
over the Washington Monument —
too bad the smoke obscured the last
five minutes of it, you kind of had to
guess what the colors were.
DC also has the luxury of being
within driving distance of New
York, Boston and just about any
where you want to go on the East
Coast. Don't have a car? No prob
lem. Neither did I. The metro is
excellent and easy to figure out.
Want to go to New York? You can
go round trip on a bus for $23. On
my trip to New York and Northern
New Jersey, 1 got a picture with the
Governor of New Jersey — you
know, the one who shut down
Atlantic City.
While that doesn't begin to cover
everything, 1 have run out of col
umn space. I didn't even get to the
after-hours scene. Come to the
District next summer, but start early
because you'll want to get one of
the paid internships.
