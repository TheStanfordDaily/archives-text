## Just plane crazy? Will Samuel L. Jackson become the next Chuck Norris? 
### RYAN LAMPE ENTERTAINMENT SNAKE CHARMER 
New Line Cinema isn't holding press screening for "Snakes on
a Plane." But that doesn't mean Entertainment isn't going to write
about what's certain to the best "worst movie of the year."
Forget "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," forget
"Superman Returns" and forget "The Da Vinci Code." Actually,
we've probably already forgotten about "The Da Vinci Code."
That's right, folks. The most anticipated movie of 2006 is upon us.
"Snakes on a Plane," the sophisticated human drama that features
Samuel L. Jackson battling a plane-load of snakes, opens nation
wide tomorrow...with special previews tonight at 10pm for those of
you who can't wait.
Just in case you've had your head in the sand for the past year,
the film's plot centers on two FBI agents (Samuel L. Jackson and
Nathan Phillips) who are given the routine task of escorting a key
witness from Hawaii to California. However, their assignment
becomes anything but routine when an assassin manages to sneak
a time-release crate containing over 500 snakes aboard the plane
in the hope of eliminating the witness.
It sounds stupid and it's meant to be. If ever there was a movie
to champion Roger Ebert's maxim "A movie isn't about what it's
about, its how it's about it," this is it. No doubt, many will dismiss
the movie as inane. But they're missing the point. Director David
Ellis isn't attempting to make great art here. He's attempting to
make a deliciously over-the-top popcorn flick: the kind of movie
the terminally underrated "Deep Blue Sea" was and. dare 1 say,
still is.
And there's certainly a big audience for high-concept B-movies
like these. The incredible buzz surrounding "Snakes on a Plane" is

testament to this. The film was rela
tively unknown throughout most of
last year. However, a blog entry
made by screenwriter Josh
Friedman in August, combined
with the casting of Jackson, sparked
initial interest in the movie. Soon
movie fans seized upon the title,
creating T-shirts, poems, poster art,
parody films, songs and numerous
fan sites. So began the Internet phe
nomenon that is "Snakes on a
Plane."
How a title can generate such
enthusiasm is remarkable. No
doubt the producers of "Deep Blue
Sea" are regretting their rather
nuanced choice. I'm sure alternate
titles like "Super Smart Sharks" or
"Sharks With Frickin' Laser Beams
Attached To Their Heads" (to bor
row from "Austin Powers") would
have raised revenues. Expect
"Snakes on a Plane's" sequels to be
called "Spiders on a Train" or, as
one fan-made poster suggests,
"Sharks on a Roller Coaster" (com
plete with tagline: You must be this
ta11...t0 DIE!). Interestingly, New
Line Cinema temporarily changed
the title to "Pacific Air Flight 121"
during production before Jackson
and fans demanded it be changed
back.
What is even more remarkable
than the interest surrounding the
movie is the impact this interest has
had. In March, New Line

announced a contest on Tag World
allowing artists to have their music
play in the movie. The film also
underwent re-shoots in the same
month to elevate the film's rating
from PG-13 to R. The additional
material, sure to please fans, height
ens the film's nudity, gore and lan

guage. This means movie-goers get
a scene in which two passengers
attempt to join the mile-high club,
and a scene in which Jackson utters
the line fans demanded: "I want
these motherfucking snakes off the
motherfucking plane!"
Of course, all this hype could

prove detrimental should the film
fail to live up to expectations. But
Ellis isn't fussed. In an interview on
commingsoon.net, the director
claimed that fans aren't expecting a
great movie. They're only expecting
the "best worst movie of the year."
How can the film possibly fail?
