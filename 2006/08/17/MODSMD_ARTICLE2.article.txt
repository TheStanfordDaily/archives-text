Amid speculation that he received kickbacks from a
Nevada-based housing company, Augie Galvan, the
assistant director of Student Management in Residential
Education, recently resigned.
A short email sent to Row Managers Aug. 8 from
Associate Director of Residential Education Nathaniel
Boswell reported Galvan's departure. The news fol
lowed discussion of Galvan's close ties to the Michelsens
Rental company for ski-trip housing. Some students
speculated that Galvan's resignation was tied to the pay
ola scandal.
In a May 3 exclusive, "Snow trip perks raise ques
tions," Galvan acknowledged to The Stanford Daily
that he had received "perks," including free weekends
at Lake Tahoe cabins. Row House managers said they
believed Galvan had pushed them toward using
Michelsons.
At Social Manager Orientation last year, Galvan
announced he had pre-booked rental homes for ski trip,
an act beyond his normal job description. The homes
were booked for Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, and
Galvan told the social managers that all they had to do
was confirm their reservations.
"No alternative companies were provided as sources
of houses," one Row Social Manager who wished to
remain anonymous told The Daily at the time. "But
there was no requirement that you had to book your
house through Michelsens."
Citing privacy reasons, director of Residential
Education and Student Affairs Jane Camarillo said in
an email that she "cannot provide" further information.
She did not confirm, deny or otherwise respond to the
allegations The Weekly presented to her.
Sources told The Weekly that not only was Galvan
receiving free weekend stays; he may also
have been receiving other forms of com
missions.
"Galvan was extremely popular among
the Row staff for his outgoing nature and
willingness to help out where possible, so

his departure is quite a shock to the incom
ing staff," the anonymous source contin
ued. "September Row manager training is
apparently going to be undertaken by two
other people temporarily, while the
University looks for a replacement."
Galvan could not be reached for com
ment, and his University phone and email
accounts were no longer active. Galvan
had been absent from campus during the
weeks preceding the announcement of his

resignation.
"I was very surprised because Augie is
an integral part of Row life and 1 just can't
fathom why he'd willingly leave us," said
another Row social manager who wished
to remain anonymous. "It's sure going to
make managing a different type of experi
ence than I had imagined."
