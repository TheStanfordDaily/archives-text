# New movie makes magic happen, absorbs viewers
## 
### VICTOR FUSTE ENTERTAINMENT MAGICIAN 
Pulling a rabbit out of a hat is for
amateurs. Try sprouting a fully
grown orange tree in a flower pot in
thirty seconds or summoning dead
spirits from beyond and maybe, just
maybe, you could rank yourself
amongst the greatest stage magi
cians in the world. Perhaps some
day, with practice and dedication,
you'll be able to compete with the
magnificent Eisenheim, "The
Illusionist."
From the crowded balconies in
the ornate theaters of turn of the
2()th century Vienna, an enraptured

audience gawks in amazement as
Eisenheim (Edward Norton) con
jures up unbelievable illusions, with
absolute disregard to the laws of
nature. His powers to produce
astounding magic tricks eventually
snag the attention of Crowned

Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell).
Invited to perform at the prince's
palace, Eisenheim proceeds to
offend the prince and a story filled
with political intrigue, long-lost
love and, above all, magic unfolds
from there.
"The Illusionist" finds it
strength from the fact that, like
Eisenheim's performances, every
thing is a show. The most gripping
parts of the film are in those super
natural moments just before
Eisenheim raises his hands to sum
mon some seemingly impossible
trick. The audience on screen
almost melts into the audience in
the theater as they watch with

bated breath the magician's perfor
mance. In those moments, when
only Eisenheim, a chair and the
lights on the stage illuminate the
scene, the viewer becomes so
absorbed in the movie that he quite
literally becomes an extension of
the audience in the theater in
Vienna.
Though the main draw of the
film is watching a master magician
doing his tricks, perhaps the most
surprising aspect of "The
Illusionist" is that the story draws
the viewer into the film as much as
the magic tricks. Though a tad lan

guid in it's pacing after the end of
the first act, "The Illusionist" does
not lose the focus on the love
between Eisenheim and Princess
Sophie (Jessica Biel), though it does
take some slight detours to set up
the "Usual Suspects"-like a twist
ending. Even when it seems that the

film has strayed from its focal point,
when the applause of Eisenheim's
final illusion dies down, it becomes
clear that every note played along
the way, with all of the characters,
comes together to create a satisfying
show.
The relationships between the
characters all serve their purpose as
well. Strong yet subtle performances
from Norton, Biel and Paul
Giamatti as the awestruck yet duti
ful Chief Inspector Uhl add both
star quality and a level of credibility
to world of "The Illusionist."
Though Viennese accents are as
unreliable as card tricks, shortcom
ings in line delivery are easily over
looked as even least important char
acters deliver believable perfor
mances. Norton's Eisenheim is stoic,
yet struts with that mix of arrogance
and mystery that defines a great
stage magician. Giamatti, coming
off a bad turn in M. Night
Shymalan's "Lady in the Water,"
redeems himself as an inspector who
is two parts business and one part
shocked audience member.
However, most surprising is Biel's
portrayal of the socialite Sophie, as
she is not an actress renowned for
her complex depiction of characters.
She manages to pull of a beautiful,
refined yet empathetic aristocrat
without recalling any of her past
mediocrity from her time on

"Seventh Heaven."
In addition to the fine acting, one
of the most immediately striking
aspects of "The Illusionist" is the
cinematography. Everything from a
manhunt through some Tim Burton
esque woods to the ancient
Viennese streets shine in a weath
ered sepia tone that ages the film to
the time period it depicts. The magic
tricks unfurl in front of a flattened
backdrop but through certain cam
era tricks — or perhaps tricks of the
eye — there is a depth to the magic
that makes it all the more surreal.
Even the love-making scene is done
in such a blurred close-up that
everything is abstracted, not just
forcing the viewer to guess what the
shapes are but distorting reality to
the point where only the passion
behind the act is important. The
visual appeal of the film is undeni
able.
Finally, the real beauty of the
film lies in the ambiguity of the end
ing. Without revealing too much,
you are left with the same questions
with which you entered the theater.
Is Eisenheim truly a sorcerer or is he
just a cheap illusionist? Is it all
smoke and mirrors or are the things
he does truly paranormal? It's up for
you to decide — just know that
"The Illusionist" is no sideshow
magician. It manages to pull much
more than a rabbit out of its hat.
