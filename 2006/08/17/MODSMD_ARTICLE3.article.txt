# GOAL!
## Emerging field: Bioinformatics Conference on campus showcases University lead on frontier 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Researchers gathered together this week to
discuss new ways in which computers can help
to diagnose and treat disease as Stanford host
ed the fifth annual Computational Systems
Bioinformatics Conference, Aug. 14 through
tomorrow.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH)
supports seven biomedical computation cen
ters that work to convert medical research into
practical applications. Two of the centers, the
National Center for Biomedical Ontology and
the National Center for Physics-based
Simulation of Biological Structures, are located
at Stanford.
Betty Cheng, associate director of the
Biomedical Informatics Training Program
sponsoring the conference, said that the defini
tion of bioinformatics varies.
"Some use a narrow definition: the collec
tion and storage of biological data, using com
puters in order to increase the efficiency and
scope of biomedical data management, analy

sis and visualization," she said. "Others use a
broader definition: the development of mathe
matical models representing biological prob
lems implemented with the best principles of
computer science. These models represent
original approaches to understanding the prob
lem and are complementary approaches to tra
ditional or experimental methods of scientific
analysis."
She cited visualization platforms for model
ing molecular structures, visualization tools for
looking at complex biological interactions and
software for managing large amounts of data as
applications used in the field.
Cheng said that bioinformatics faces devel
opmental challenges because it is a relatively
new field.
"Since bioinformatics is relatively young,
there are few formal ways to enter the field,"
she said. "The number of degree-granting insti
tutions in this field is small, and many of the
programs are only a few years old."
She noted that the University's Medical
Information Sciences program, renamed as the
Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Program, was
one of the first programs to grant degrees relat-
