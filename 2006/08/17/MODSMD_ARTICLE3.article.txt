# GOAL!
## Emerging field: Bioinformatics Conference on campus showcases University lead on frontier 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Researchers gathered together this week to
discuss new ways in which computers can help
to diagnose and treat disease as Stanford host
ed the fifth annual Computational Systems
Bioinformatics Conference, Aug. 14 through
tomorrow.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH)
supports seven biomedical computation cen
ters that work to convert medical research into
practical applications. Two of the centers, the
National Center for Biomedical Ontology and
the National Center for Physics-based
Simulation of Biological Structures, are located
at Stanford.
Betty Cheng, associate director of the
Biomedical Informatics Training Program
sponsoring the conference, said that the defini
tion of bioinformatics varies.
"Some use a narrow definition: the collec
tion and storage of biological data, using com
puters in order to increase the efficiency and
scope of biomedical data management, analy

sis and visualization," she said. "Others use a
broader definition: the development of mathe
matical models representing biological prob
lems implemented with the best principles of
computer science. These models represent
original approaches to understanding the prob
lem and are complementary approaches to tra
ditional or experimental methods of scientific
analysis."
She cited visualization platforms for model
ing molecular structures, visualization tools for
looking at complex biological interactions and
software for managing large amounts of data as
applications used in the field.
Cheng said that bioinformatics faces devel
opmental challenges because it is a relatively
new field.
"Since bioinformatics is relatively young,
there are few formal ways to enter the field,"
she said. "The number of degree-granting insti
tutions in this field is small, and many of the
programs are only a few years old."
She noted that the University's Medical
Information Sciences program, renamed as the
Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Program, was
one of the first programs to grant degrees relat-

Ed to biomedical informatics, and that
Stanford continues to be a leader in the field.
"Research in biomedical informatics at
Stanford represents the leading edge in the
field," she said.
The conference was founded by Bay Area
Bioinformatics and is sponsored by the Life
Sciences Society. Tuesday night, six panelists,
directors of six of the seven centers, gathered
in Cubberly Auditorium to discuss the field.
John Wooley from the University of
California, San Diego Supercomputer
Center opened the talk, discussing the impor
tance of the new field.
"For most people, computational biology
is an oxymoron," he said. "We've come a
long ways-Computational biology is here
and it matters."
Eric Jakobsson, a professor at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
then spoke about the difficulties related to
biomedical computation. He discussed how
biomedical computing tools are difficult to
use and fragile, and they also have limited
dissemination possibilities. However, he
noted that technology is improving.
"This is less true already than it was a cou
ple of years ago," he said. "We've seen some
really interesting things today."
Jakobsson then spoke about the history of
bioinformatics, discussing the National
Institutes of Health Bioinformatics and
Computational Biology Roadmap that was
developed in 2003, outlining an eight to 10-
year plan to create biomedical computing
centers. He then discussed the importance of
biology as an interdisciplinary field.
"I don't think biology is a pure science," he
said. "Biology is a cross, a hybrid right from
the start between an engineering way of think
ing and a purely scientific way of thinking."

He noted how bioinformatics would
change the future of biology from a techno
logical aspect.
The six panelists then each gave an intro
duction to their fields, speaking about their
centers, key challenges for the future and
possibilities for collaboration. Ron Kikinis,
MD, director of the Surgical Planning
Laboratory at Brigham and Woman's
Hospital and a professor of Radiology at
Harvard Medical School, discussed new
technologies, such as a "3-D slicer," an
application for image analysis and data visu
alization.
Mark Munsen from the National Center
for Biomedical Ontology at Stanford and
head of Stanford Medical Informatics then
discussed the goal of his center to make
ontoligies accessible and usable, champi
oning his center's focus on technology devel
opment. University of Michigan professor
Brian Athey from the National Center for
Biomedical Informatics then discussed the
importance of expanding the field to new
types of research and the difficulty of the
NIH getting engineers and computer scien
tists.
As the aforementioned centers have
grown at Stanford, undergraduate students
have also gained the opportunity to do
research in the developing field. Rising senior
Joe Chan expressed his interest in bioinfor
matics.
"What really drew me to bioinformatics is
its ability to render complex questions of
biology into more tangible and visual terms,"
he said. "Bioinformatics is a powerful tool
because it can unearth hidden patterns from
an immense collection of data that would be
impossible to interpret without more com
puting power."
