Palo Alto approves Caltrain station
improvements
Hoping to improve mass transit use in Palo Alto,
the City Council approved $13 million in improve
ments to the city's California Avenue Caltrain sta
tion. The work slated for the next months will
include a pedestrian underpass and two new plat
forms, as well as expansions that will enable the sta
tion to accommodate more than one train at a time.
These pedestrian-friendly plans come in light of
the "Pedestrian and Transit Oriented Development"
(POTD) zone City Council approved two weeks ago,
in an effort to make a more "walkable. bikeable Palo
Alto." Final approval should come at the City
Council's Sept. 11 meeting.
Despite the reduced usage of the California
Avenue Station due to the Palo Alto (University
Avenue) station's Baby Bullet service, these plans
will not include Baby Bullet access.
However, the Palo Alto station is also in plans for
improved bike and pedestrian access, a new bridge
over El Camino Real, more integration with
University Avenue and an "enhanced gateway to
Stanford University."

Stanford named second most "global"
university by Newsweek
In a new ranking evaluating the global sophistica
tion of the world's top 100 universities, Stanford
University came second only to Harvard University,
according to Newsweek Magazine.
Newsweek based such rankings on each school's
academic programs preparing students for interna
tional careers, ability to attract top faculty members
from the global community and the number of inter
national students. The range of study-abroad oppor
tunities each school offers its students was also con
sidered.
The ranking of global universities Newsweek com
piled was created using a system designed to reflect
these principles, along with excellence in research.
The system draws upon ranking systems developed
by Shanghai Jiaotong University and the Times of
London Higher Education Survey, with variables
including "the number of highly-cited researchers in
various academic fields, the number of articles pub
lished in Nature and Science, the number of articles
listed in the ISI [Institute for Scientific Information]
Social Sciences and Arts & Humanities indices, the
percentage of international faculty, the percentage of
international students, citations per faculty member
(using ISI data), the ratio of faculty to students, and
library holdings (number of volumes)," the
Newsweek article said.
