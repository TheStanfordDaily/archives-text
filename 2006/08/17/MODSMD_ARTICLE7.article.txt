# ALCOHOL USE
## Study: 4 in 5 college students drink Treatment, policy helps campus consumption stay relatively low 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Four in five college students drink and
roughly 40 percent drink heavily, according
to an article released Aug. 7 by the
American Psychiatry Association (APA).
However, campus officials said alco
holism is not as prevalent at the University.
Alcohol and Drug Educator Ralph
Castro said that the statistic is closer to two
in three students at Stanford. He added that
Stanford is consistently below the national
average for frequency and quantity of alco
hol consumed.
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, director of
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) at Vaden Health Center, said that
while perhaps four out of five students have
had alcohol, "the majority of students can be

considered light drinkers, not heavy
drinkers."
Martinez said he would describe alcohol
abuse at Stanford as a "serious concern," but
not a severe problem. According to the
CAPS website, 75 percent of Stanford stu
dents either do not drink or drink lightly.
Castro, who serves as chair of the
Alcohol Advisory Board and manager of
Vaden's Substance Abuse Prevention
Services, also emphasized, though, that
"Stanford is not immune to the negative
effects of alcohol abuse," such as having
students hospitalized for alcohol poison
ing.
Patrick Cordova, a rising sophomore and
student member of the Alcohol Advisory
Board, called Stanford's alcohol scene "well
maintained and well-controlled."
Because Stanford is not an alcohol-free
campus, Cordova said, residential education
can address the issue of drinking objectively,
as opposed to focusing on violations.
"At Stanford, 1 feel as if drinking is only
a catalyst used to calm down, act out, bring

out a wild side, or just be trashed," Cordova
said. "That ranges for some from sharing a
beer at a fraternity party, to playing beer
pong on ski trips, to sake bombs at Miyake,
or even taking heavy shots alone in your
room."
Cordova also related the story of a friend
who had difficulty managing her alcohol
consumption.
"After two and a half quarters of heavy
drinking, she did not know what else to do in
her free time," he said.
According to Cordova, the residence
deans intervened in the situation and his
friend left Stanford for the rest of the quar
ter. "It seemed necessary," Cordova added.
This month, the APA launched its sec
ond annual public awareness initiative deal
ing with college issues relating to mental
health, including alcohol abuse. This initia
tive is a part of the group's national cam
paign called "Healthy Minds, Healthy
Lives."
