# ALCOHOL USE
## Study: 4 in 5 college students drink Treatment, policy helps campus consumption stay relatively low 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Four in five college students drink and
roughly 40 percent drink heavily, according
to an article released Aug. 7 by the
American Psychiatry Association (APA).
However, campus officials said alco
holism is not as prevalent at the University.
Alcohol and Drug Educator Ralph
Castro said that the statistic is closer to two
in three students at Stanford. He added that
Stanford is consistently below the national
average for frequency and quantity of alco
hol consumed.
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, director of
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) at Vaden Health Center, said that
while perhaps four out of five students have
had alcohol, "the majority of students can be

considered light drinkers, not heavy
drinkers."
Martinez said he would describe alcohol
abuse at Stanford as a "serious concern," but
not a severe problem. According to the
CAPS website, 75 percent of Stanford stu
dents either do not drink or drink lightly.
Castro, who serves as chair of the
Alcohol Advisory Board and manager of
Vaden's Substance Abuse Prevention
Services, also emphasized, though, that
"Stanford is not immune to the negative
effects of alcohol abuse," such as having
students hospitalized for alcohol poison
ing.
Patrick Cordova, a rising sophomore and
student member of the Alcohol Advisory
Board, called Stanford's alcohol scene "well
maintained and well-controlled."
Because Stanford is not an alcohol-free
campus, Cordova said, residential education
can address the issue of drinking objectively,
as opposed to focusing on violations.
"At Stanford, 1 feel as if drinking is only
a catalyst used to calm down, act out, bring

out a wild side, or just be trashed," Cordova
said. "That ranges for some from sharing a
beer at a fraternity party, to playing beer
pong on ski trips, to sake bombs at Miyake,
or even taking heavy shots alone in your
room."
Cordova also related the story of a friend
who had difficulty managing her alcohol
consumption.
"After two and a half quarters of heavy
drinking, she did not know what else to do in
her free time," he said.
According to Cordova, the residence
deans intervened in the situation and his
friend left Stanford for the rest of the quar
ter. "It seemed necessary," Cordova added.
This month, the APA launched its sec
ond annual public awareness initiative deal
ing with college issues relating to mental
health, including alcohol abuse. This initia
tive is a part of the group's national cam
paign called "Healthy Minds, Healthy
Lives."
"Drinking is not an overhearing cam
pus phenomenon," said rising sopho
more Alex Coley, who called the scene
tamer than at many other schools.
Castro and Martinez highlighted the
resources available at Stanford to stu
dents struggling with alcohol and related
problems.
"Students can seek out these services
on their own or be directed to them by
someone on campus," Castro said.
Free, confidential, and professional
counseling at CAPS is available, and
Substance Abuse Prevention Services
offers advising and consultations.
Castro also offers a three-hour alco
hol education seminar once each quar
ter. Seminar participants are self
referred or referred by a residence dean
or other faculty or staff member.
Martinez called both the counseling
and seminar "very effective." However,
he said that "the challenge is to get stu
dents to make the call [to get help]."
"It can be very difficult for a student
to realize that they need to be concerned
about their drinking," he added. "This is
where friends can play a critical role."
One student, who wished to remain
anonymous, was required to attend
Castro's seminar after being hospital
ized for alcohol poisoning.
Of the hospital experience, the stu
dent said that the people at the hospital
"are strictly concerned with your safety
— not policing —and that is sort of
reflective of Stanford's general attitude
toward drinking, especially underage."
The student said that Castro, the
seminar leader, was "truly genuine" and

"single-handedly made the event a
worthwhile one, mixing in humorous
anecdotes with his realistic approach
toward college drinking."
"Ralph threw a lot of hard data at us,
which I personally found helpful," the
student added.
"My understanding is that Ralph
does indeed visit dorms throughout the
year, and I'm sure the people who
attend his talks leave satisfied," the stu
dent said. "I'm not proposing that this
kind of alcohol education be mandatory,
but I'd hope to see dorm staff really try
to push students to go to events like
this."
The student added, "Though it's like
ly that many students in the seminar,
especially the older ones, knew every
thing Ralph said, I'd be willing to bet
that many incoming freshmen
wouldn't."
Incoming freshman Sally Schonefeld
said that she expects there to be some
pressure to drink at Stanford.
"I think I can trust myself to keep my
alcohol consumption at a safe level," she
said. "Right now I feel like my school
work will be my priority, and I won't let
alcohol and parties get in the way of
that."
Bert Mcßride, another incoming
freshman, said that although Stanford's
drinking culture is not as prevalent as
that of other schools he has visited, that
doesn't change some things.
"College is college," he said. "No
matter where you go, there is a 98-per
cent chance that there is going to be a
drinking scene there."
However, Mcßride added that he
doubts there will be pressure to drink
from other students.
"From what I have seen, most people
are pretty open-minded and accept
everyone else's point of view," he said.

anecdotes with his realistic approach
toward college drinking."
"Ralph threw a lot of hard data at us,
which I personally found helpful," the
student added.
"My understanding is that Ralph
does indeed visit dorms throughout the
year, and I'm sure the people who
attend his talks leave satisfied," the stu
dent said. "I'm not proposing that this
kind of alcohol education be mandatory,
but I'd hope to see dorm staff really try
to push students to go to events like
this."
The student added, "Though it's like
ly that many students in the seminar,
especially the older ones, knew every
thing Ralph said, I'd be willing to bet
that many incoming freshmen
wouldn't."
Incoming freshman Sally Schonefeld
said that she expects there to be some
pressure to drink at Stanford.
"I think I can trust myself to keep my
alcohol consumption at a safe level," she
said. "Right now I feel like my school
work will be my priority, and I won't let
alcohol and parties get in the way of
that."
Bert Mcßride, another incoming
freshman, said that although Stanford's
drinking culture is not as prevalent as
that of other schools he has visited, that
doesn't change some things.
"College is college," he said. "No
matter where you go, there is a 98-per
cent chance that there is going to be a
drinking scene there."
However, Mcßride added that he
doubts there will be pressure to drink
from other students.
"From what I have seen, most people
are pretty open-minded and accept
everyone else's point of view," he said.
