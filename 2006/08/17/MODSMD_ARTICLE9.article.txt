## Sketch Life is Fair This week's sermom: People don't understand meaning 
### 
When lying in bed late at
night, alone and without
easily available pornogra
phy, 1 sometimes turn my enormous
brain to contemplating the nature
of existence. Of late, it's been
occurring to me that people (a
group 1 have been know to identify
with) occasionally take egocentrici
ty to fairly frightening levels.
Now, as those of you who have
been lucky enough to know me well
are aware, I don't actually have
problem with ego (in fact, I could
even be said to be somewhat of a
fan). My problem, rather, is the
blissful unawareness of one's self
ishness that seems to be a constant
feature of the human condition.
(I was just re-reading that previ
ous paragraph and it occurred to me
that the reader might think me a
mite pretentious for the use the
phrase "human condition". Bite
me.)
There are lots of particular
instances of apparently ignorant
self-centredness that one could list.
From political ideology to personal
morality, self-interest rules.
It always brings a smile to my
face when folks 1 know launch into
diatribes on the nature of society.
Apparently it is the role of govern
ment to implement the well-known
"me first" policy. This is not an
unreasonable point of view; it
would just be nice if people admit
ted it.
We scientists, for example, are
almost universally convinced that
our work is criminally underfund
ed by the taxpayer. More, we hold
that by pouring money into, say.
String Theory, all of mankind will
benefit. And few of us stop to think
that maybe we might be a shade
biased.
The universality of "me" as a
political philosophy is a remarkable
thing, but it is personal ethics where
narcissism really runs wild. The
ease with which one can let go of
moral principles that have been sev
eral years in the acquiring is fasci
nating.
Cheating is wrong. Unless you
won't get caught.
Always tell the truth. Except if
lying gets you some.
Never betray a confidence. Save
for those circumstances where
there's money in it.
Again, it's not the hypocrisy.
There's nothing wrong with
hypocrisy. The problem is not that
people have double standards; it's

that they don't acknowledge it.
Nothing is more universal than self
certitude, especially when it comes
to fury at the flaws of others and
indignation at accusations flung at
oneself.
Which brings me to this week's
sermon. I've been spending the last
few days kicking doors and head
butting walls in general annoyance
at the unfairness of life. However, it
occurred to me yesterday evening,
as 1 rubbed my stubbed toes and
massaged my bruised forehead, that
perhaps this is a little ridiculous.
The "life isn't fair" is an article
of faith for parents, teachers and
other potential sources of abuse
everywhere. Unfortunately, it isn't
true.
Life is perfectly fair. People just
don't understand fair.
"Fair" is unbiased. Neutral.
Without prejudice. This is not the
same as "designed for my benefit".
It's easy to throw a tantrum
because the bastards at British
Airways throw on an excess bag
gage charge. Or because your land
lord evicts you. Or because you lose
your cell phone. Or because you're
not quite the player you thought
you were.
However, while throwing the
toys out of pram may be emotional
ly satisfying, it's a fairly futile exer
cise. And a little silly.
There is not much of a line
between believing in the unfairness
of existence and believing in des
tiny. The fact the life doesn't follow
a path laid done by either aliens or
by gods should not be taken as evi
dence of a conspiracy to keep you
miserable.
Furthermore, not only would
holding that particular viewpoint be
foolish, it also really wouldn't be
fair.

Incidentally, none of the above
should he taken as an indication
that I'll stop complaining about
everything. Or of a concession that
perhaps God doesn't hate me. He
does. Don't email navins@stan
ford.edu, I don't want to talk.
