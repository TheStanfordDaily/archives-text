## Gifted get access to Stanford Stanford offers first online high school designed for students 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Across the country, students of all ages
are going back to school. But this fall, for
about 30 gifted high school students, back
to school will not entail boarding the school
bus, but instead logging online to partici
pate in the first year of the Education
Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY) Online
High School at Stanford University.
Launched this spring following a gift
from the Malone Family Foundation, the
EPGY Online High School (EPGY-OHS)
welcomes its first students for orientation
on Sept. 7, with classes to begin Sept. 11.
EPGY-OHS features academically rig
orous seminar-style and directed-study
courses in the humanities, social sciences
and natural sciences, including 17 universi
ty-level mathematics and physics classes.
Students will also be invited, but not
required to participate in EPGY's summer
session at Stanford.
Although just over 30 full-time and part
time students will be enrolled this fall,
gradual growth is expected. According to
Ray Ravaglia, deputy director of EPGY, in
three to four years, EPGY expects to enroll
about 100 students in each of the three

grades.
Since 1990, EPGY's online distance
learning offerings have served over 50,000
gifted students.
"This was a godsend," said Miriam Sell
of Phoenix, Ariz, of the creation of the
EPGY-OHS. Her son David will be a full
time student in the EPGY-OHS. "I was the
first one in line to call and get an applica
tion. This is just perfect for him."
Without EPGY-OHS, Sell said that her
son would have had to combine online
classes with classes at Arizona State
University, and possibly even relocate to
participate in an early admissions program
at another college.
"Many gifted students have a hard time
finding the courses they need at their local
schools," Ravaglia said. "This is particular
ly true for students who live in remote
areas or who are younger than the tradi
tional age of high school students. At least
one parent has said to me that because of
the EPGY-OHS, they will not need to relo
cate."
Prof. Patrick Suppes directs the EPGY
program. "There's a large network of par
ents of gifted students, and they're very
pleased to see us add this, because it's fill
ing a gap," he said. "There's a need
for it. Particularly enthusiastic have been
some of the home-schooled gifted stu
dents."
Tina Fischer of Riverside, Calif, said
that the decision to enroll her son, Ariel, as
a full-time student at the EPGY-OHS was
an easy one.
Ariel, previously home-schooled, had

taken courses online through EPGY and
other programs.
"We've been the happiest with the
EPGY program, because the caliber of the
classes is so good," Tina Fischer said. "It
was just perfect timing that he was going to
be a sophomore and they began offering
this program. Instead of having him piece
meal all over, we can just have him affiliat
ed with one place."
This centrality is what Ariel Fischer said
he is "most excited about," now being able
to continue his schooling "in a very orga
nized central form."
Students can enroll either full-time or
part-time. Part-time students would com
bine EPGY-OHS coursework with classes
in their local schools or through other pro
grams.
After three years, students will receive a
diploma, ensuring that they also "receive
full recognition for the coursework that
they complete, without having to rely on
making arrangements with their local high
schools," Ravaglia said.
The school will be accredited after com
pleting a two-year accreditation process.
"We don't expect any problems at all
because we're going to have a very acade
mic curriculum," Suppes said.
EPGY already had the framework for
strong courses in mathematics, physics and
English with its current online offerings.
However, Suppes said, to provide a bal
anced curriculum, the online high school
organized courses in social sciences, music
and foreign languages. Many of these courses
will prepare students for Advanced
Placement examinations
Most subjects will feature some lectures as
well as time spent in an online classroom,
where students can engage in discussion and
interact with the teacher and the other stu
dents online.
"1 really like the virtual classroom, which
allows me to me meet interesting people,
other than the people I hang out with here in
southern California, and to interact directly
with the teachers," Ariel Fischer said.
Ravaglia said that because the EPGY
OHS allows its students to take the classes
they need to realize their potential, "we will

be able to set high standards and to challenge
these students in a way that they are not
presently being challenged."
Karl Bunday of Minnesota said that it was
nearly impossible to find a high school —
public or private — with a challenging science
curriculum for his son, Matthew.
"There aren't any high schools in town
with classes that match up with the math he
has already taken," Bunday said. "We consid
ered boarding schools, but Matthew wasn't so
inclined to leave town."
The EPGY-OHS seemed the perfect fit for
Matthew, said Bunday, because "there's no
ceiling."
Matthew Bunday, who will take five cours

es in the EPGY-OHS this fall, said he is excit
ed about "being able to learn on my own
schedule and work at my own pace."
"Students can go further if they have the
time," Suppes said, citing the 10 Stanford
undergraduate math courses available to the
students. "The mathematical learning in this
high school will be more advanced than
almost any, and the same is true of physics.
Ordinarily, high school students only get one
to two years of physics. Beyond AP courses,
we have about 10 additional courses."
"We're very ambitious and we believe the
very best students should master those cours
es," Suppes continued. "We're here to chal
lenge the very best. That's our objective."

Since 1990, EPGY's online distance
learning offerings have served over 50,000
gifted students.
"This was a godsend," said Miriam Sell
of Phoenix, Ariz, of the creation of the
EPGY-OHS. Her son David will be a full
time student in the EPGY-OHS. "I was the
first one in line to call and get an applica
tion. This is just perfect for him."
Without EPGY-OHS, Sell said that her
son would have had to combine online
classes with classes at Arizona State
University, and possibly even relocate to
participate in an early admissions program
at another college.
"Many gifted students have a hard time
finding the courses they need at their local
schools," Ravaglia said. "This is particular
ly true for students who live in remote
areas or who are younger than the tradi
tional age of high school students. At least
one parent has said to me that because of
the EPGY-OHS, they will not need to relo
cate."
Prof. Patrick Suppes directs the EPGY
program. "There's a large network of par
ents of gifted students, and they're very
pleased to see us add this, because it's fill
ing a gap," he said. "There's a need
for it. Particularly enthusiastic have been
some of the home-schooled gifted stu
dents."
Tina Fischer of Riverside, Calif, said
that the decision to enroll her son, Ariel, as
a full-time student at the EPGY-OHS was
an easy one.
Ariel, previously home-schooled, had

taken courses online through EPGY and
other programs.
"We've been the happiest with the
EPGY program, because the caliber of the
classes is so good," Tina Fischer said. "It
was just perfect timing that he was going to
be a sophomore and they began offering
this program. Instead of having him piece
meal all over, we can just have him affiliat
ed with one place."
This centrality is what Ariel Fischer said
he is "most excited about," now being able
to continue his schooling "in a very orga
nized central form."
Students can enroll either full-time or
part-time. Part-time students would com
bine EPGY-OHS coursework with classes
in their local schools or through other pro
grams.
After three years, students will receive a
diploma, ensuring that they also "receive
full recognition for the coursework that
they complete, without having to rely on
making arrangements with their local high
schools," Ravaglia said.
The school will be accredited after com
pleting a two-year accreditation process.
"We don't expect any problems at all
because we're going to have a very acade
mic curriculum," Suppes said.
EPGY already had the framework for
strong courses in mathematics, physics and
English with its current online offerings.
However, Suppes said, to provide a bal
anced curriculum, the online high school
organized courses in social sciences, music
and foreign languages. Many of these courses
will prepare students for Advanced
Placement examinations
Most subjects will feature some lectures as
well as time spent in an online classroom,
where students can engage in discussion and
interact with the teacher and the other stu
dents online.
"1 really like the virtual classroom, which
allows me to me meet interesting people,
other than the people I hang out with here in
southern California, and to interact directly
with the teachers," Ariel Fischer said.
Ravaglia said that because the EPGY
OHS allows its students to take the classes
they need to realize their potential, "we will

be able to set high standards and to challenge
these students in a way that they are not
presently being challenged."
Karl Bunday of Minnesota said that it was
nearly impossible to find a high school —
public or private — with a challenging science
curriculum for his son, Matthew.
"There aren't any high schools in town
with classes that match up with the math he
has already taken," Bunday said. "We consid
ered boarding schools, but Matthew wasn't so
inclined to leave town."
The EPGY-OHS seemed the perfect fit for
Matthew, said Bunday, because "there's no
ceiling."
Matthew Bunday, who will take five cours

es in the EPGY-OHS this fall, said he is excit
ed about "being able to learn on my own
schedule and work at my own pace."
"Students can go further if they have the
time," Suppes said, citing the 10 Stanford
undergraduate math courses available to the
students. "The mathematical learning in this
high school will be more advanced than
almost any, and the same is true of physics.
Ordinarily, high school students only get one
to two years of physics. Beyond AP courses,
we have about 10 additional courses."
"We're very ambitious and we believe the
very best students should master those cours
es," Suppes continued. "We're here to chal
lenge the very best. That's our objective."
