## On Campus Five a Day of Creativity A
						recommended daily output for expression 
### ANDREA RUNYAN COLUMNIST 
Creativity breeds happiness. At
least Psychology Today says so. But
Robert Hanson writes in Business
Week Online that "most people are
inclined to be more creative on the
job than would be truly productive,"
and thus "to succeed in academia,
my graduate students and I had to
learn to be less creative than we
were initially inclined to be."
I think he has a point there. As
much as people talk about the
importance of creativity in research
or schoolwork or a job, the purpose
of these institutions is something
other than nurturing our natural
ingenuity.
Perhaps, even at Stanford, we
can't depend on our work to provide
us with sufficient opportunities to be
imaginative. The purpose of jobs is
production, not fun.
But I think the purpose of
humans, if there is one, would
include creative expression. I'd even
suggest a Recommended Daily
Output (RDO) of creative products
and ideas, just as the Produce for
Better Health Foundation recom
mends five servings of fruits and veg
etables per day. Here are some ways
to get servings of creativity in daily
life.
Cooking
I love cooking since its one of the
most everyday opportunities for cre
ativity. You don't have to paint can
vasses or compose music as part of
your day, but often you do have to
cook or at least choose food pairings,
and there are ways to have fun with
this.
Add strange ingredients to things.
When making biscuits I've added
things like tomato sauce, M&Ms,
Parmesan cheese, coconut milk,
coconut rum, wine, and vodka. Yum,
spiked biscuits. Add strange things
to eggs. I love "pizza eggs" -eggs
with spaghetti sauce and a bit of
cheese. Also good is eggs with wine
in them, or "oeufs au vin."
I made someone a squid sand
wich two days ago, with steamed
squid, Greek yogurt, tomatoes,
lemon juice, flax seed oil, cheese,
and whole wheat bread. Why eat
BLTs or turkey ever again, when
you can try turkey-PB-banana, or
bacon-cucumber-hummus?
One more experiment that I
think is the most fun thing ever: set
out whatever ingredients you want
to eat for your meal: maybe a bit of
protein, some vegetables and fruit
and maybe bread, and some flavor

ful extras like nuts, mustard, sauces,
spreads, etc. Then construct a meal
in which no two bites contain the
same ingredients. If you have more
than a few things, and if you put sev
eral things together in each bite, you
should have no problem coming up
with unique combinations. Some
sample bites: pieces of strawberry,
olive, and salmon wrapped in spin
nach, or bread with butter, cottage
cheese and sunflower seeds. You can
try one combination, add one more
ingredient, and try it again. It amazes
me how a single ingredient can
change the taste.
Generally, try anything. There
arc more tastes to try than there are
mealtimes left in our lives.
Games
How funny that people treat the
rules of games as though they were
rules on a tax form or rules of law.
Come on, nobody's going to die if we
use foreign words in Scrabble.
My best friend and I used to
change the rules of the board game
Life. We called our version "genera
tion life." While playing, we'd write
down our person-pieces' significant
life events, choosing their home
locations, and naming their spouses
and children. Then, we'd take all the
children and put them through life
for themselves. The size of each gen
eration was limited by the number of
car pieces included in the game, so
sometimes we'd play the game for
one person's children first, then the
other's. We came up with elaborate
family histories.
One time last summer, three of us
wanted to play chess, but we had
time for only one game. To enable
all three of us to play, we devised a
sort of Chinese chess using two chess
boards. The objective was to move
as many of your pieces as possible
from your corner to the opposite
corner and to capture as many of
your opponents' pieces as possible,
while using only the traditional
moves allotted to the individual
chess pieces. The person with the
most pieces that got to the other side
was the winner. Why play the same
game twice when there are other
