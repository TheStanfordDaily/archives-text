## A
						Column Movie title translations in German can change meaning of film 
### JOHN SHEN COLUMNIST 
Descriptive titles are key, as you
see. I'm writing this on the assump
tion that much of the talk of the past
week in the States has been about
the low budget, fantastically named
film that may or may not star
Samuel L. Jackson and a couple of
reptilian guests on a trans-pacific
flight.
All this hubbub about a movie
with such a wickedly bad, yet
wickedly awesome title has remind
ed me of something that I've been
noticing over the past few months:
the Germans have a knack for badly
translating movie titles.
Take for example, "Pirates of the
Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."
Which did away with all hints of
originality and was renamed as
"Curse of the Caribbean 2" (Fluch
der Karibik 2). Which, actually, in
comparison to the rather unimagi
native original title, might be an
improvement.
Nevertheless, the crispy named
Vince Vaughn/Jennifer Aniston film
"The Breakup" somehow ended up
being translated into German as the
clumsy and awkward "Separating
with Hindrances" (Trennung mit
Hindernissen). Likewise, the bril

liant, concise title "Cars" gets trans
lated into "Cars like Us" (Autos wie
Wir), which is completely unneces
sary. (The film, by the way, won't
open until early September here, to
my Pixar-loving chagrin)
But then again, I don't have to
remind you that America has its
own share of ridiculously named
films. "Dude Where's My Car" and
"Harold and Kumar Go to White
Castle" come first to mind. There is
also, of course, the wonderfully
descriptive title of the 5001b gorilla
of a Samuel L. Jackson film that,
may I remind you, is currently on
the top of the box office charts.
But as they say, "A rose by any
other name smells just as sweet,"
except of course they mean
'"Snakes on a Plane' by any other
name just ain't the same mf'ing
snakes on the same mf'ing plane."
Thankfully the Germans didn't even
bother translating that title, as I
found out from a movie poster,
which also incidentally had Samuel
L. Jackson standing in a plane isle
looking like a serial killer armed
with a taser, leaving me doubts as to
if the Germans really understood
the deep meaning of this film (Hint:
it's about the freaking snakes on the
freaking plane.)
It does say a lot about America

though, the way even our crappiest
(and snakiest) films get translated
and shipped overseas. But as I've
noticed, it's not so much the cultural
hegemony that so many decry, but
rather a cultural dilution, the same
way the US has Chef Chau's, Taco
Bells, and the way we drink crappy
imports (like Becks, which is
German for "shitty f**k beer" —
so I was told by a German
Bartender my first weekend in
Berlin). Of course you notice it
more when it's America itself that's
diluted into McDonalds and Burger
Kings that serve mayo with fries and
charge you extra for ketchup, a
strange fascination with David
Hasselhoff (it's the chest hair), and
the "American Breakfast" at a local
cafe 1 frequent, which is somehow a
crepe — covered in maple syrup.
On a related note, I did see a bot
tle of Salsa a while back labeled as
"Mexico sauce." But that's a whole
other story.

John won't be able to see "Snakes
on a Plane" until the middle of
September, when it comes out in
Europe with bad German dubbing.
Please don't ruin the movie by
