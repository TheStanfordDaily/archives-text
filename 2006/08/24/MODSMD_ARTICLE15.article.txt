## All jobs are the same Trying to think in bullet points 
### 
There are few more boring things in the
world than watching someone else align bul
let points. Now, you may be thinking that
aligning them yourself would be even duller, but
at least then you have a sense of achievement
when you finally end up with all your ducks/cross
es/little circles in a

row.
1 mention this
because I've been
spending the after
noon (and the
evening, and the
morning) helping

to put together a presentation. Well, help may be
a slight exaggeration; actually I've been pointing
out minor spelling mistakes and suggesting the
odd layout change.
(A brief aside, I just wanted to share my views
on people who use the spacebar to align text on a
page: bloody communists.)
Anyway, as I sat staring at the screen, suggesting
humorous anecdotes and contemplating suicide it
occurred to me that perhaps the lofty heights of
academia are not so different from the troughs of
filth where the more ordinary white-collar jobs
feed.
(Another brief aside: that was sarcasm.)
A surface scan of jobs in law, consulting and
banking might leave you to believe that, even if
they are not different from one another, the clas
sic money trio are at least distinct from, say, life as
an academic.
However, belief is dangerous. You would be
wrong.
(Sorry, lot of asides this week; mind wandering
from over-stimulation of imagination. In reality
lawyers, bankers and consultants are convinced of
their uniqueness; they all use Excel in completely
different ways.)
City life may have some over-arching purpose
that you waxed lyrical about in your interview, but
the day-to-day experience is fairly universal. You
check email. You surf the 'net. You put data in
Excel. And above all else you construct presenta
tions in PowerPoint.
Let's contrast this with academia (well, the sci
ences at least, I have no idea how humanists pass
their time). 1 wake up. I check email. I surf the
'net. And while I only use Excel to calculate my
theoretical tax burden when 1 win the lottery, like
every other physicist I know, I live or die on the
quality of my presentations.
The universal power of PowerPoint (and its
numerous relatives) to make or break a career is a
curious thing.
People are rarely judged on their results, or on
their work. Instead one is assessed on how well
one talks the talk.
Of course, if you're any good you can probably
stand, deliver and succeed on raw talent.
However, most of us are just trying to scrape
together minimum wage in a cruel world, and tal
ent is in short supply.
So, as tedious as the alignment of bullet points
is, it still matters. A lot. No matter if you're talk
ing crap; they'll remember a sparkling presenta
tion with bells and whistles far more readily than
anything resembling genuine innovation.
Don't get me wrong. I don't have a problem
with this. I'm far from being a genius. In fact, I'm
far from even being competent. I'll never achieve
success through brilliance or hard work. On the
other hand, I'm one hell of a showman...

Do you think the final sentence in a bullet point
should end with a period? Send your answers to
navins@stanford.edu, I'm curious.
