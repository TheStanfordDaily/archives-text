# COLLEGE NEWSPAPERS
## College press freedom bill passed 
### ANDREA FULLER STAFF WRITER 
Student free-press advocates scored a vic
tory August 10 as the California State Senate
passed legislation prohibiting the censorship
of public university newspapers and extending
free-speech protection for college journalists.
The bill, AB 2581, is nicknamed the "Hosty
bill" in reference to the 2005 Hosty v. Carter
decision by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals. The Court held that censorship
rights of high-school officials could apply to
public colleges in Indiana, Illinois and
Wisconsin.
After the Supreme Court declined to hear
a Hosty case appeal, the California Assembly
responded in May by unanimously passing the
free student press legislation now approved by
the State Senate on a 31-2 vote. The bill awaits
the governor's signature.
Public universities across California will be
affected in varying degrees by the bill. Among
those closest to Stanford, Berkeley's Daily Cal
will experience little new freedom, as writer
Katlyn Carter noted that the student newspa
per already enjoys full freedom of the press.
"Our paper is independent from the
University," she said. "It broke with the
University over an issue of free speech. It had
to do with the Vietnam War, and the paper
printed an editorial that was very against it.
The University wanted them to retract the
editorial, and the paper decided to stand by
what they said, and they broke [off from the
University]."
Marion Everidge, Managing Editor of the
California Aggie at UC Davis, said that The
Aggie, on the other hand, is under more
University control.
"We are regulated by the school's Campus
Media Board, and so that handles all publica
tions that come out of UC Davis," she said.
"They regulate, and they do the hiring of our
editor in chief. They are the overall seers."
She noted that the Campus Media Board
and the newspaper writers "don't really inter
act," and that the paper has recently printed
potentially controversial material about uni
versity officials. The paper does however print
a disclaimer noting that The Aggie's views are
separate from those of the school.
"If [the law] goes into effect, it means we
have the free overall ability to print," she said,
adding that campus newspapers would right
fully have "the right and the ability to report
the news accurately, without any sort of
umbrella regulations."
Carter also noted that she personally
believes that the legislation would be a good
change.

"1 think [the new legislation is] a good
thing, especially when there are instances
when the paper can really make a difference
and expose something that's going on at the
University, which officials often don't want
students to know about," she said. "It's a good
bill to pass."
Communications Prof. Ted Glasser, a
Stanford Daily board member, agreed that
this legislation is important, though he refer
enced its drawbacks.
"I think the legislation is almost entirely
symbolic, but symbolic in an important
sense," he said. "It's a nice public statement.
It doesn't apply to private universities.

"I think the legislation is almost entirely
symbolic, but symbolic in an important
sense."
â€” Prof. Ted Glasser, a member of The Daily s board, on legislation

There are so many private universities that
strictly control their student press and
they're protected by the Constitution. It's no
violation, but state universities are subjects
of the state and subject to First Amendment
concerns."
The Stanford Daily already enjoys the free
dom of the press the legislation hopes to pro
vide for public schools. It became an organi
zation entirely independent from the
University following the 1971 Zurcher v.
Stanford Daily lawsuit. The suit was filed after
the Palo Alto Police Department searched
The Daily for pictures of a violent clash
between police and protestors.
"As for now, The Daily is financially inde
pendent from the University, which can wield
no official say over what we print," said for
mer Editor in Chief Camille Ricketts. "The
only time 1 have run into conflict with the
administration or faculty is when the paper
has printed something inaccurate and we have
had to amend something. I can't think of any
specific episodes when an administrator or
faculty member outright told me to change
something or to not print a quote or story that
was fair-game."
Glasser agreed that the University usually
supports The Daily's freedom, though there
are minor tensions at times.
"It became its own corporation, so to
speak, and Stanford has historically been

eager to accept that arrangement, and regards
freedom of the press as important," he said.
"That's not to say there aren't tensions at
times between the University and the Daily."
One such experience occurred when
Ricketts was a managing editor of news and L.
Paul Bremer, the former leader of the
American occupation in Iraq, came to speak
at Stanford.
"The ASSU Speakers Bureau was very
upset because Bremer had requested that his
speech be off the record, and we planned to
cover it anyway," Ricketts said. "For a while
they said they were not going to allow us into
the presentation or that no recording devices

would be allowed. In the end, they just
barred us from the pre-speech interview; but
that's really all they could do."
Glasser also referenced a time when the
University had leased the stadium to an out
side group and did not want The Daily dis
tributed there because the group had its own
publication. The situation led to The Daily's
argument that its publication shouldn't be
restricted on campus, followed by a lawsuit
that was resolved out of court, giving The
Daily "a seat at the table when a third party
comes to the university," said then-business
manager Todd Bernstein.
Despite these few instances, Ricketts noted
that The Daily has "never had serious con
cerns about censorship or restricted freedom,"
but other schools without student-run and
economically independent publications face a
much different battle. For this reason, she
commended the current bill.
"1 know that other schools don't enjoy
these luxuries," she said. "Or, [they] have too
small an organization to fight a meddling
administration, and in that sense I think the
legislation is a positive step. Not only will it
help a student readership remain better
informed of what may or may not be going
well at their school, but it will be invaluable to
student journalists who have to learn on the
job how to battle undue influence and reluc
tant sources."
