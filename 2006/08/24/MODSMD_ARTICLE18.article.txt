## ESPN's Baseball Nostalgia Little League World Series brings it all back 
### JAKE KELMAN SPORTS COLUMNIST 
Every year about this time, ESPN
viewers flipping to their favorite
channel in the afternoons get to
watch a dramatic baseball playoff
unfold. Who said August is the Dog
Days? While the Major League
Baseball pennant races are just heat
ing up and the postseason is still a
month away, a group of smaller ath
letes capture our eyes as they chase
a trophy in games that we find
strangely compelling.
The Little League World Series
has grown in popularity over the
past few decades. In the first few
years of coverage, only the champi
onship game was televised, and the
production was pretty low key. Now
we see teams compete starting at the
regional final level, and get players'
bios and scouting reports. Why the
increase in coverage, and why are we
(am I) so drawn in?
For me, the LLWS is still fascinat
ing, even though I have not played
Little League in eight years. It has
nothing to do with things like the
"purity of the game," or the intense
passion and all-out hustle the chil
dren display. Many people are
drawn to the innocence of it, con
trasting it to what they perceive to
be a money-driven professional
sports world. It's baseball, sans
steroids. I don't buy that. For me,
that's not why I watch the LLWS.
I watch it because still, at almost
20 years old, when I see a 4'11" kid
hit a ringing double, I remember
that feeling of metal meeting
cowhide and seeing the ball travel
what seemed to be so far (and in
reality was only about 120 feet). I
can still summon up the pride I felt
coasting in to second for a stand-up
double. I remember the bliss of
fielding a grounder and whipping it
across the diamond to convert a
groundout, and feeling oh-so profes
sional as I did it. I remember the
exhilaration of our team's back-to
back-to-back regular season league
championships, and the despair of
our regular defeats in the post-sea
son.
I generally am uninspired by sen
timental fondness for youth, but
Little League holds a special place in
my heart. It reminds me of a time
when I could enjoy playing a sport as
much as I enjoy watching it. I played
baseball until age 15, but it never
again captured me the way it did
playing for my "Majors" team from
ages 10-12. Everything about the
way the league was structured made
it seem so real, so official. We
played with the same group of guys
for all three years, developing a
sense of camaraderie within us, and
a competitive fire for those against
us. We were just the right size for
the field; not so small so that a
crushed fly ball barely left the
infield (like in the Babe Ruth
League) and not so big that even
pop-ups left the yard (though I must
admit, playing home run derby on a
little field now can be quite enjoy
able). The umpires treated the
games like they mattered, the par
ents acted as though they cared
about the team's success and not
just their own kid's, and the players
were heavily invested in their team.
So that's what seems familiar
about the LLWS and what makes
me nostalgic for what I loved about
playing youth baseball. Still, there is
a part of me that sees these games
being broadcast to a national audi
ence and feels insanely removed
from the experience. Part of it, of
course, is the fact that it is national

ly televised, and that as far as I can
remember, Gary Thorne and Orel
Hershiser never called my games.
Part of it is that the pitchers who
reach Williamsport seem to throw
about twice as fast as anyone I
played with ever threw, with break
ing pitches and command unheard
of in my time in Little League. The
last part (I'm working under the
unfounded assumption that there
are three components to this
removed feeling), I cannot fully
identify. Maybe it's that Little
League does seem too long ago.
Perhaps it's because 1 prefer to
watch (obviously) higher quality
baseball at the Major League level.
It could be that I'm repressing jeal
ousy of the kids who get to grab the
spotlight for two short weeks.
Something about it is a little off.
But obviously, none of those rea
sons deter me enough to give up
watching the games and using valu
able column space to sort out my
childhood dilemmas. Little League
was a great experience, one I surely
will not forget. The overly-invested
coaches, the rivalries, that feeling of
being like a pro, these are the things
I think of when I flip on a Little
League game every August. That's
why I keep watching.
