## ESPN's Baseball Nostalgia Little League World Series brings it all back 
### JAKE KELMAN SPORTS COLUMNIST 
Every year about this time, ESPN
viewers flipping to their favorite
channel in the afternoons get to
watch a dramatic baseball playoff
unfold. Who said August is the Dog
Days? While the Major League
Baseball pennant races are just heat
ing up and the postseason is still a
month away, a group of smaller ath
letes capture our eyes as they chase
a trophy in games that we find
strangely compelling.
The Little League World Series
has grown in popularity over the
past few decades. In the first few
years of coverage, only the champi
onship game was televised, and the
production was pretty low key. Now
we see teams compete starting at the
regional final level, and get players'
bios and scouting reports. Why the
increase in coverage, and why are we
(am I) so drawn in?
For me, the LLWS is still fascinat
ing, even though I have not played
Little League in eight years. It has

that feeling of metal meeting
cowhide and seeing the ball travel
what seemed to be so far (and in
reality was only about 120 feet). I
can still summon up the pride I felt
coasting in to second for a stand-up
double. I remember the bliss of
fielding a grounder and whipping it
across the diamond to convert a
groundout, and feeling oh-so profes
sional as I did it. I remember the
exhilaration of our team's back-to
back-to-back regular season league
championships, and the despair of
our regular defeats in the post-sea
son.
I generally am uninspired by sen
timental fondness for youth, but
Little League holds a special place in
my heart. It reminds me of a time
when I could enjoy playing a sport as
much as I enjoy watching it. I played
baseball until age 15, but it never
again captured me the way it did
playing for my "Majors" team from
ages 10-12. Everything about the
