# WOMEN'S SQUASH
## Lily starts the revolution 
### JENNA COALSON SPORTS EDITOR 
In the world of collegiate
squash, East Coast schools, espe
cially the Ivies, have always domi
nated. Until now. With the addition
of transferring sophomore Lily
Lorentzen and the support of world
renowned squash player Mark
Talbott in his third year of coaching
at Stanford, the Stanford Women's
Squash team is set to jeopardize
that dominance in its debut year as
a varsity sport.
Largely due to student initiative,
Stanford Squash has undergone a
rapid expansion in recent years.
Started in 1998, the team was
becoming more of a national
threat, even as an entirely student
run club sport. In August of 2004
the first major catalyst for improve
ment came in the form of new full
time Director of Squash, Mark
Talbott.
With such a big name, Talbott's
move West set the world of squash
afire with the talk of finally becom
ing a truly national sport and of
Stanford becoming the first squash
powerhouse not based on the East
Coast.
What really has everyone talk
ing these days about the threat
from the West and the arrival of
Stanford on the squash scene is the
transfer of superstar sophomore
Lily Lorentzen.
Lorentzen, who has been play
ing squash competitively since age
nine has won the US National
Junior Championships a total of
eight times, four in the Under 19
division, has reached a professional
world ranking of 55, and competed
as the number one player for the
US team at the World Team
Championships in 2005.
As a freshman, she led Harvard
to the Collegiate Squash
Association National
Championship team title and
defeated teammate Kyla Grigg to
become the fourth freshman ever
to win the women's Intercollegiate
Individual Championship. And
then shortly thereafter, in June,
Lorentzen made an announcement

that shocked everyone.
She was moving to the Farm.
"1 felt pretty strongly about it. I
just really like [Stanford], and I
think it fits my personality better,"
Lorentzen said.
Her mother and sister are both
Stanford alumni, and another sister
will join her here this fall. With
such family ties, she has always
been interested in Stanford, but
could not seriously consider attend
ing until there was a varsity squash
team.
"When I first applied three years
ago, Stanford didn't really have a
team at all, and squash is really

important to me, so it was difficult
to consider going to a school that
didn't have one."
But after the squash season
ended last year, Lorentzen found
out about the recent varsity status
change and contacted Talbott, who
she knew through her childhood
coach.
"Luckily it ended up working
out," she said.
Lorentzen is optimistic. "I think
it's really exciting, because there's a
lot of room for improvement, and I
think we'll see a lot of change.
