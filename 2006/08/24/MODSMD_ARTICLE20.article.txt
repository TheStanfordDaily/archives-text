# The 						Coach
## Experience key to Squash success 
### 
Talbott came to Stanford
after six successful years as
head coach of the Yale
Women's Squash team, and
two decades of extreme success
as a professional player. In his
final year at Yale, he led the
Bulldogs to their first undefeat
ed season in 18 years, capturing
both the national championship

and the Ivy
League title
along the
way. Talbott
himself holds
more than
200 career
squash victo
ries, and,
after a 13
year streak

as America's number one
ranked player, is considered by
many to be the greatest
American player of all time.
Apparently, Talbott does
not disappoint.
In a few short years, Talbott
has led both the men's and
women's squash teams to finish
in the top 20 in the nation. He
oversaw the 2005 completion of
seven new international squash
courts in the Arrillaga Family
Center for Sports and
Recreation, where he hosted
the first ever Western
Collegiate Squash Round
Robin last February.
Most importantly, this fall
Talbott will coach the first and
only intercollegiate squash pro
gram on the entire West Coast,
as the women's team assumes
its official varsity status.
"With the addition of Lily
and another very good junior
player, Katie Brewster, [who's
going to be a freshman] we've
got a big step up," Talbott said
in an interview with The
Weekly on Wednesday. "Now
we can challenge teams in the
top of the B division and the
bottom of A whereas right now
we're in C."
