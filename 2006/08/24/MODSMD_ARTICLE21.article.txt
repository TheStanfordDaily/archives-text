## Volleyball faces tougher schedule with healthier players 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a disappointing second
round exit from last year's NCAA
Tournament, the Stanford women's
volleyball team enters the 2006 sea
son ranked fourth nationally and
predicted by the league's coaches to
win the Pacific-10 conference.
The Cardinal finished 26-6 last
season, with a 14-4 mark in the Pac

10. Stanford returns 10 players,
including All-Americans Kristin
Richards, Bryn Kehoe and Foluke
Akinradewo.
Stanford faces a brutal 2006
schedule, beginning with UC-Santa
Barbara this Saturday. The
Cardinal then meet BYU, Virginia
Commonwealth and Texas A&M
at the BYU tournament on Sept. I
2. Stanford travels to Honolulu to
face Northwestern, Fairfield and

Hawaii on Sept. 7-9. The squad
finally returns home to host the
Stanford Invitational on Sept. 14-
16, tackling Santa Clara,
Georgetown and St. Mary's in the
process.
The Cardinal must then deal
with arguably the most competitive
volleyball conference in the nation,
as the Pac-10 has claimed the past
five national titles — including the
2001 and 2004 crowns for Stanford.

Luckily, several strong players
that were sidelined due to injuries
last year will be returning to meet
the challenge. Outside hitter sopho
more Cynthia Barboza missed the
second half of last season after tear
ing her ACL in a game at Cal.
Before the injury, Barboza led the
Pac-10 in kills after having started
in all 21 matches. Redshirt fresh
man Alex Fisher was sidelined dur
ing the entire 2005 campaign due to
a knee injury sustained during prac
tice.
Setter Bryn Kehoe averaged
13.14 sets per game in 2005, but was
forced to relinquish the position to
graduate Katie Goldhahn for a few
games toward the season's end, after
breaking her hand.
Other strong returning players
include sophomore middle blocker
Akinradewo, who hit .397 last year

with more than a block per game en
route to winning Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year honors. Senior outside
hitter Richards notched a hitting
average of .272 while leading the
team in kills with 544.
The Cardinal also welcomes
three promising new players this
season, including walk-on sopho
more Heather Hernandez. The for
mer Stanford Crew member was a
two-time volleyball team MVP in
high school, in addition to three
First-Team All-Freeway League
selections.
Freshman setter Joanna Evans
has competed internationally, most
recently playing with the Junior

National Team at the 2006 NORCE
CA World Championships in
Mexico. The Piedmont, CA native
was named high school league MVP
in 2004 and 2005. Fellow freshman
middle blocker Janet Okogbaa also
has international experience, having
competed for the 2004 and 2005 U.S.
Junior National team. During her
tenure, Okogbaa also claimed the
2004 Junior Olympic National
Championship MVP.
Last year, the Cardinal dropped a
preseason match to then top-ranked
Nebraska before losing two five
game nail-biters to Arizona and two
matches to eventual national cham
pion Washington. Stanford then rode
a three-game winning streak into the
NCAA tourney, cruising past
Nevada one night before being upset
by Santa Clara at Maples Pavilion.
