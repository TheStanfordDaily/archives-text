## Volleyball faces tougher schedule with healthier players 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a disappointing second
round exit from last year's NCAA
Tournament, the Stanford women's
volleyball team enters the 2006 sea
son ranked fourth nationally and
predicted by the league's coaches to
win the Pacific-10 conference.
The Cardinal finished 26-6 last
season, with a 14-4 mark in the Pac

10. Stanford returns 10 players,
including All-Americans Kristin
Richards, Bryn Kehoe and Foluke
Akinradewo.
Stanford faces a brutal 2006
schedule, beginning with UC-Santa
Barbara this Saturday. The
Cardinal then meet BYU, Virginia
Commonwealth and Texas A&M
at the BYU tournament on Sept. I
2. Stanford travels to Honolulu to
face Northwestern, Fairfield and

Hawaii on Sept. 7-9. The squad
finally returns home to host the
Stanford Invitational on Sept. 14-
16, tackling Santa Clara,
Georgetown and St. Mary's in the
process.
The Cardinal must then deal
with arguably the most competitive
volleyball conference in the nation,
as the Pac-10 has claimed the past
five national titles â€” including the
2001 and 2004 crowns for Stanford.

Luckily, several strong players
that were sidelined due to injuries
last year will be returning to meet
the challenge. Outside hitter sopho
more Cynthia Barboza missed the
second half of last season after tear
ing her ACL in a game at Cal.
Before the injury, Barboza led the
Pac-10 in kills after having started
in all 21 matches. Redshirt fresh
