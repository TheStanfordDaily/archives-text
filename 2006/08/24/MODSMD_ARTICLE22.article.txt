## Rushing to finish by home opener In sneak preview, Athletics Department says stadium will be completed by Sept. 16 for game against Navy Workers rush to put finishing touches on stadium spearheaded by Arrillaga; new concessions will offer organic options 
### ADRIAN GAITAN MANAGING EDITOR 
The stadium renovation project is on
schedule, representatives of the Stanford
Athletic Department said during a special
sneak preview for the press on Tuesday.

Athletic Director
Bob Bowlsby
noted that with the
seats and turf
installed, "We
could be playing
football here rela
tively soon."
Exterior concrete
and landscaping as
well as cleaning up
any remaining dirt
and debris from
within the stadium
and its seats were
among the few
things that
remained on the
work schedule.
"I think it was the
right decision to
move the San Jose
game and to get
ourselves an extra
week [of work],"
Bowlsby said. "We
really thought that
this would be a
race to the finish,
laboring until the
eleventh hour, and
probably in some
areas, it will be."

Bowlsby, the for
mer Athletic Director for the University of
lowa, made it known that the new football
stadium would be even better not only for
the fans, but for Stanford Athletics as well.
"This is going to help our recruiting in foot
ball and our recruiting in all our other
sports."
Drawing on his experience in the Big Ten
athletic conference, Bowlsby believed that
with the increased proximity of the fans to
the field, the stadium would have a substan
tial impact with regards to home field advan
tage. The stadium, he said, reminded him of
the stadium at Michigan State University.
"This is a little smaller, but with the enclosed
corners and two-tier seating, it definitely
reminds me of Michigan State. And
Michigan State was a very difficult place to
play. Very difficult. This is going to be a very
tough place to play and a very friendly place
for our football team."

Interim Athletic Director Bill Walsh
pointed out that while the old stadium had
historical value, especially with respect to his
Super Bowl XIX win at Stanford Stadium, it
was time for a new stadium. "Anything being
constructed anywhere in the country this
beautifully, this efficiently, this well
designed, and this quickly is just an incredi
ble feat on the part of the Stanford family
and primarily John Arrillaga."
The only remnants of the old stadium,
according to Bowlsby, were the exterior
bowl, a few wiring ducts, and the dirt in the
center of the field. Arches overlooking the
north end of the stadium, though, were
meant to pay tribute to the old stadium's
architecture.
"I'm sort of glad to see the track gone.
The fans are hundreds of feet closer to the
field than they were before."

In addition to a new stadium experience,
spectators can expect a variety of new con
cessions in the new stadium. Traditional
favorites such as hot dogs, burgers, and gar
lic fries will be served alongside vegetarian
pizza, Compadre's Mexican dishes, and fish
and chips. The highlight of the new conces
sions, though, appears to be "The Farm
Dog," an organic all-beef hot dog served on
a whole-wheat bun.
"We know that some people like organic
foods," Bowlsby said, "so we thought we'd
offer fans the opportunity to enjoy organic
concessions as well."
Both Bowlsby and Walsh stressed that
financial donors were crucial to the project.
Donors such as alumnus Arrillaga, they said,
made the stadium project a reality, especial
ly given such a tight time-frame with which
to work.

"If this project was undertaken at a pub
lic university, there is no question that it
wouldn't have gotten done in ten months
like this one," Bowlsby said. "And it would
have been $300 million, if a penny."
One of the reasons for the construction
of a new stadium included the declining
attendance at Stanford football games for
the past few years, making the stadium seem
cavernous. Season ticket sales as of today,
though, indicate that empty seats probably
won't be a problem in the new stadium.
"Season ticket sales are up 136 percent
year-to-date compared to last year," stated
Bowlsby. In fact, approximately 37,600 of
the stadium's 50,000 seats for the season had
already been sold over the past six months
as opposed to last year's total season ticket
sales of 13,700 seats. The November 4 match
up against USC has already sold out while

the opening home game against Navy is
expected to sell out soon.
As the opening kickoff for the first home
game draws closer, community members
can look forward to several stadium-related
events over the next few weeks. The "Select
Your Seat Sale" on September 10 will give
fans the opportunity to purchase season
tickets and tour the stadium as well. On
September 13, head coach Walt Harris and
members of the football team will lead a
noon pep rally at Lytton Plaza in Palo Alto,
followed by a Grand Opening Block Party
at the Civic Center Plaza on September 15.
Fans are asked to come early to the sta
dium on opening day in order to take part in
the pre-game ceremonies, which will include
U.S. Navy jet flyovers, Navy paratroopers,
the ribbon cutting ceremony, and other sur
prises.

"Season ticket sales are up 136 percent
year-to-date compared to last year," stated
Bowlsby. In fact, approximately 37,600 of
the stadium's 50,000 seats for the season had
already been sold over the past six months
as opposed to last year's total season ticket
sales of 13,700 seats. The November 4 match
up against USC has already sold out while

the opening home game against Navy is
expected to sell out soon.
As the opening kickoff for the first home
game draws closer, community members
can look forward to several stadium-related
events over the next few weeks. The "Select
Your Seat Sale" on September 10 will give
fans the opportunity to purchase season
tickets and tour the stadium as well. On
September 13, head coach Walt Harris and
members of the football team will lead a
noon pep rally at Lytton Plaza in Palo Alto,
followed by a Grand Opening Block Party
at the Civic Center Plaza on September 15.
Fans are asked to come early to the sta
dium on opening day in order to take part in
the pre-game ceremonies, which will include
U.S. Navy jet flyovers, Navy paratroopers,
the ribbon cutting ceremony, and other sur
prises.
