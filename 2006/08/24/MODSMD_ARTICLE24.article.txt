## Michael Wilkerson Problems with being trendy As stars flock to help Africa, fundamental problems go unfixed across the continent 
### 
There's no such thing as bad publicity, or so the adage goes. But while
African issues like AIDS and poverty are buzzwords in the Hollywood
charity circles, actual results are likely to be minimal, except perhaps at
the box office. An August 13 cover story in the New York Times style magazine
examined the building momentum of attention, celebrity visits and donations to
African aid projects.

Despite ridicule-inviting statements like:
"Africa — rife with disease, famine, poverty
and civil war — is suddenly 'hot,'" the paper
makes an important observation. With late
comers like Madonna attempting to capital
ize on the positive publicity people like
Bono, Bill Gates and Brad Pitt have derived
from African visits and advocacy, the
increased profile of humanitarian work in
Africa may not be evidence of any changes
in public opinion or U.S. policy.
Instead, pledging support or cash to
African causes may be simply a new way for
celebrities to get noticed, and for average
Americans to feel like they are contributing
to the less fortunate. Not to downplay the
latter, or even criticize celebrity attention
garnering (when it could actually help peo
ple), but the hype and popularity of the
moment cannot replace long term commit
ment to sustainable improvements in
Africa's infrastructure, and even the best
celebrity endorsed plan faces serious chal
lenges.
Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia economist
who has been arguing for increased foreign
aid for years, makes a convincing case in his
recent book The End of Poverty. His basic
contention is that rich countries already
have the money that could easily eliminate
poverty and disease and bring up the global
standard of living, and that these countries
could distribute it without causing them
selves much hardship. Not only that, but the
costs of not acting to stop these problems
(for example the costs of emergency famine
relief or intervening in a war) outweigh the
costs of ramping up aid anyway. Therefore,
Sachs writes, aid should be increased "both
out of enlightened self-interest of the rich
nations and out of a deeper human need at
the individual level."
The concept makes perfect sense. Aid to
Africa could be an investment in the future
of the globe. As Bono expresses in elo
quence that leaves little doubt as to how U2
won its Grammys (did 1 mention that the
foreword of Sachs' book is written by
Bono?), "I'm a singer with an ear for a
melody. Great ideas have a lot in common
with a great melody...Jeff is hard to ignore."
Sachs deserves a lot of credit for his advo
cacy and pioneering research into a frame
work to help underdeveloped nations, and
Bono was one of the first celebrities to start
the engines on the Africa band-wagon so he
might arguably be excused from self-serving
publicity stunts. But as someone with an ear

for a melody, Bono should also know that
the delivery is crucial. If you can't sing, the
fact that the melody is great only marginally
matters. Indeed it may not even be recogniz
able.
As of yet, no one has proven themselves
competent enough to enact Sachs' proposal
and even if celebrities and mere mortals
alike continue to be enthralled with raising
more money, there is no guarantee that it
will be used properly or even used at all. In
contrast, efforts of a much smaller scale than
the one Sachs proposes are being consistent
ly bungled.
In 2005, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria suspended its
grants to Uganda after the discovery of what
it called "financial irregularities." Officially,
according to the Fund, about $280,000 was
stolen by manipulated exchange rates in
grants given to the Ugandan government.
But the problems were much more extensive
than officially acknowledged.
Some Global Fund money was abjectly
stolen. The Global Fund grants to Uganda,
which included over $66 million to fight
malaria, have yet to result in the purchase of
a single mosquito net by the Ugandan gov

ernment, which was supposed to use the
money to buy 1.8 million of them.
In a story less publicly reported outside
Uganda, when the Global Fund attempted
to circumvent the government and pump the
money directly into civil society through
NGOs, there was a sudden boom in NGO
creation that resulted in widespread fraud.
Different groups with permutations of simi
lar tear-jerking names along the lines of
"Hope for Children," "Hope and Children,"
"Hope with Children," and "Children and
Hope," all received grants and promptly did
nothing. An inquiry later showed that these
"briefcase" (or fake) NGOs were in many
cases engineered by leading government
officials and politicians.
While some of the money has disap
peared completely, other significant chunks
of it are still sitting in Geneva, with Ugandan
officials saying they can't spend it. On July
29, Kampala's Daily Monitor reported that
there is over $120 million in unused grants to
Uganda and that the country (which was
amazingly reinstated after the 2005 fiasco) is
again facing disqualification for not utilizing
the money. With money that has already
been provided being stolen and sitting

unused, it is difficult to tell how exactly hav
ing Angelina Jolie as a mascot for UNICEF
helps institute any necessary reforms.
The efforts of Hollywood elite and requi
site accompanying publicity could make a
difference, but it will take more than photo
shoots and donations. Public focus could be
channeled to demand accountability from
groups like the Global Fund, or even World
Bank and IMF. Such organizations are in
many cases all too happy to dump their
money without properly securing the distrib
ution mechanisms that make sure it reaches
its intended beneficiaries. The donors then
return to state sponsors and middle-class
donors alike, brag about how much money
was given here or there, and everyone feels
better about themselves without overdue
worrying about a tangible outcome.
But changing this cycle requires a com
mitment and persistence that may not fit
with the movie star cause of the moment.
Lobbying leaders and governments to
change policies is probably the most impor
tant thing star power could be used for, and
Bono, still leading the field tried to do exact
ly this at the G-8 summit of world leaders
last year. As Bono has discovered, discus
sion of accountability frameworks does not
get the same press reaction as photos with
orphans of AIDS.
The increased prominence of Africa's
issues may also be short lived in the general
public. For one thing, it seems unlikely that
there is any actual rise in internationalism or
interest in serious progress. Celebrity visits
and church fundraisers for Rwanda or
Darfur do not change the fact that a signifi
cant number of Americans would still be
hard pressed to find Iraq or Afghanistan on
a map.
In fact, Africa's nearly impossible to miss
geography may make it easier to sympathize
with its problems. Besides being much sim
pler to identify as a whole landmass than
through pesky individual states with pesky
individual problems, perhaps its sheer size
makes one feel better about the grandeur of
charitably helping not just a group of people,
or a country, but an entire continent. With
such a big target and so many problems from
AIDS to poverty, to education, humanitari
an aid can't help but find some needy recip
ients. Right?
Woodrow Wilson wrote that "friendship
is the only cement that will ever hold the
world together." It will be interesting to see
who stands beside Bono a year from now,
when demanding help for Africa may no
longer be a "trendy" activity. Even if the
attention remains, it will take much more
than friendship or publicity to solve the
problems of underdevelopment, no matter
where they are found.

comers like Madonna attempting to capital
ize on the positive publicity people like
Bono, Bill Gates and Brad Pitt have derived
from African visits and advocacy, the
increased profile of humanitarian work in
Africa may not be evidence of any changes
in public opinion or U.S. policy.
Instead, pledging support or cash to
African causes may be simply a new way for
celebrities to get noticed, and for average
Americans to feel like they are contributing
to the less fortunate. Not to downplay the
latter, or even criticize celebrity attention
garnering (when it could actually help peo
ple), but the hype and popularity of the
moment cannot replace long term commit
ment to sustainable improvements in
Africa's infrastructure, and even the best
celebrity endorsed plan faces serious chal
lenges.
Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia economist
who has been arguing for increased foreign
aid for years, makes a convincing case in his
recent book The End of Poverty. His basic
contention is that rich countries already
have the money that could easily eliminate
poverty and disease and bring up the global
standard of living, and that these countries
could distribute it without causing them
selves much hardship. Not only that, but the
costs of not acting to stop these problems
(for example the costs of emergency famine
relief or intervening in a war) outweigh the
costs of ramping up aid anyway. Therefore,
Sachs writes, aid should be increased "both
out of enlightened self-interest of the rich
nations and out of a deeper human need at
the individual level."
The concept makes perfect sense. Aid to
Africa could be an investment in the future
of the globe. As Bono expresses in elo
quence that leaves little doubt as to how U2
won its Grammys (did 1 mention that the
foreword of Sachs' book is written by
Bono?), "I'm a singer with an ear for a
melody. Great ideas have a lot in common
with a great melody...Jeff is hard to ignore."
Sachs deserves a lot of credit for his advo
cacy and pioneering research into a frame
work to help underdeveloped nations, and
Bono was one of the first celebrities to start
the engines on the Africa band-wagon so he
might arguably be excused from self-serving
publicity stunts. But as someone with an ear

for a melody, Bono should also know that
the delivery is crucial. If you can't sing, the
fact that the melody is great only marginally
matters. Indeed it may not even be recogniz
able.
As of yet, no one has proven themselves
competent enough to enact Sachs' proposal
and even if celebrities and mere mortals
alike continue to be enthralled with raising
more money, there is no guarantee that it
will be used properly or even used at all. In
contrast, efforts of a much smaller scale than
the one Sachs proposes are being consistent
ly bungled.
In 2005, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria suspended its
grants to Uganda after the discovery of what
it called "financial irregularities." Officially,
according to the Fund, about $280,000 was
stolen by manipulated exchange rates in
grants given to the Ugandan government.
But the problems were much more extensive
than officially acknowledged.
Some Global Fund money was abjectly
stolen. The Global Fund grants to Uganda,
which included over $66 million to fight
malaria, have yet to result in the purchase of
a single mosquito net by the Ugandan gov

ernment, which was supposed to use the
money to buy 1.8 million of them.
In a story less publicly reported outside
Uganda, when the Global Fund attempted
to circumvent the government and pump the
money directly into civil society through
NGOs, there was a sudden boom in NGO
creation that resulted in widespread fraud.
Different groups with permutations of simi
lar tear-jerking names along the lines of
"Hope for Children," "Hope and Children,"
"Hope with Children," and "Children and
Hope," all received grants and promptly did
nothing. An inquiry later showed that these
"briefcase" (or fake) NGOs were in many
cases engineered by leading government
officials and politicians.
While some of the money has disap
peared completely, other significant chunks
of it are still sitting in Geneva, with Ugandan
officials saying they can't spend it. On July
29, Kampala's Daily Monitor reported that
there is over $120 million in unused grants to
Uganda and that the country (which was
amazingly reinstated after the 2005 fiasco) is
again facing disqualification for not utilizing
the money. With money that has already
been provided being stolen and sitting

unused, it is difficult to tell how exactly hav
ing Angelina Jolie as a mascot for UNICEF
helps institute any necessary reforms.
The efforts of Hollywood elite and requi
site accompanying publicity could make a
difference, but it will take more than photo
shoots and donations. Public focus could be
channeled to demand accountability from
groups like the Global Fund, or even World
Bank and IMF. Such organizations are in
many cases all too happy to dump their
money without properly securing the distrib
ution mechanisms that make sure it reaches
its intended beneficiaries. The donors then
return to state sponsors and middle-class
donors alike, brag about how much money
was given here or there, and everyone feels
better about themselves without overdue
worrying about a tangible outcome.
But changing this cycle requires a com
mitment and persistence that may not fit
with the movie star cause of the moment.
Lobbying leaders and governments to
change policies is probably the most impor
tant thing star power could be used for, and
Bono, still leading the field tried to do exact
ly this at the G-8 summit of world leaders
last year. As Bono has discovered, discus
sion of accountability frameworks does not
get the same press reaction as photos with
orphans of AIDS.
The increased prominence of Africa's
issues may also be short lived in the general
public. For one thing, it seems unlikely that
there is any actual rise in internationalism or
interest in serious progress. Celebrity visits
and church fundraisers for Rwanda or
Darfur do not change the fact that a signifi
cant number of Americans would still be
hard pressed to find Iraq or Afghanistan on
a map.
In fact, Africa's nearly impossible to miss
geography may make it easier to sympathize
with its problems. Besides being much sim
pler to identify as a whole landmass than
through pesky individual states with pesky
individual problems, perhaps its sheer size
makes one feel better about the grandeur of
charitably helping not just a group of people,
or a country, but an entire continent. With
such a big target and so many problems from
AIDS to poverty, to education, humanitari
an aid can't help but find some needy recip
ients. Right?
Woodrow Wilson wrote that "friendship
is the only cement that will ever hold the
world together." It will be interesting to see
who stands beside Bono a year from now,
when demanding help for Africa may no
longer be a "trendy" activity. Even if the
attention remains, it will take much more
than friendship or publicity to solve the
problems of underdevelopment, no matter
where they are found.

TRENDY: Bill Gates and Bill Clinton confer at an AIDS conference in Canada where Africa
factored prominently. Celebrities like Madonna have made "Africa" a pet project.
There's no such thing as bad publicity, or so the adage goes. But while
African issues like AIDS and poverty are buzzwords in the Hollywood
charity circles, actual results are likely to be minimal, except perhaps at
the box office. An August 13 cover story in the New York Times style magazine
examined the building momentum of attention, celebrity visits and donations to
African aid projects.

Despite ridicule-inviting statements like:
"Africa — rife with disease, famine, poverty
and civil war — is suddenly 'hot,'" the paper
makes an important observation. With late
comers like Madonna attempting to capital
ize on the positive publicity people like
Bono, Bill Gates and Brad Pitt have derived
from African visits and advocacy, the
increased profile of humanitarian work in
