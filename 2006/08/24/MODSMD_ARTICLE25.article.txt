## JOKE OF THE WEEK So this guy walks into a bar... 
### 
So the other night I walked into a bar.
I will tell you all that this is unusual for
me, since, well, 1 don't drink. I just needed
some material for stand-up and if you'll
notice, all the great stand-up jokes begin,
"so this guy walks into a bar," or "so this
carrot walks into a bar." So I figured I'd try
being that carrot.
I walked into the bar and I sat down. 1
said, "Bartender, I don't drink. What
should I have?" Well, he laughed his ass off.
Then I noticed this beautiful girl sitting next
to me whom I had not noticed when I ini
tially walked in and sat down; she turned
around to see what was so damn funny. She
looked me over as if she were appraising a
horse. Luckily, she didn't check my teeth.
She asked the bartender, "What's so
funny?"
And he said, "See this guy here; he
doesn't drink!"
So again, she looked at me over, this time
reassessing me, because obviously, her ini-

tial impression of me was dead wrong.
"You don't drink?" she said, "So why are
you in here?"
"To be honest," I said, "I wanted some
material for stand-up."
"stand-up?" she asked.
"Yeah, you know, I try to be funny."
"Right," she says, "Okay, well, in that
case, I will sleep with you if you can make
me laugh." This was, needless to say, a very
generous offer. I mean, I am a stand-up
comedian, this is what I do, and everyone
likes to laugh.
"Okay, well, let me ask you a question,
why are you offering me this? You're a very
attractive woman, you could obviously have
any guy you wanted."
She said, "Yes, but I haven't laughed in
12 years."
"Wow," I said, "That's a long time."
"Yes. But you only get one shot, other
wise it wouldn't be fair."
"Fair?" I asked.
"Yes, to all the other two bit comedians
that have tried so far." Whew, lots of pres
sure. "Besides, 1 didn't like them anyway,
they weren't pure."
"Pure?" I asked.
"Yes," she said, "They didn't want to

make me laugh because they were
comedians, they wanted to make me
laugh to get sex."
"Well, why would you say that?
How do you know that?"
"Because," she said, "Everyone I
asked was a male, except for one
woman, and she was a lesbian."
"Right, but, what makes me dif
ferent from any of them?"
"You don't come into a bar to
drink and pick up ladies; you come
into a bar to find a laugh."

"Well," I said, "to be honest, I
came into this bar to find you. I
knew you'd be here."
"Now how the hell did you know
that?" she asked in a jesting tone,
masking the slight bit of paranoid
fear that should accompany any
stranger expressing knowledge of
something personal, like which bar
you go to.
"Well, I had a prophetic dream."
After saying this, she stared at me
oddly. "Yeah. See, 1 came in here
and I saw this beautiful girl at the bar.
I sat down next to her, had a little
small talk, asked 'my place or yours'
and by the end of the night, we were
screwing. So, my place or yours?"

At this she burst out laughing.
True, I am not anything pretty to
look at. She glanced at me sideways,
looked straight ahead, and said
"You're no different from any other
guy, and definitely not hot enough
to screw right off. Go sleep with
your mother."
"Normally, I would have to agree
with you and say I had no grounds to
approach you, but like it or not, I
just made you laugh. My place or
yours?" She stared at me for a sec
ond, muttered something profane
under her breath. I woke up in the
morning, and my wallet and pants
were gone, but damn, that was a
good bar joke.
