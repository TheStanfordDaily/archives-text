## JOKE OF THE WEEK So this guy walks into a bar... 
### 
So the other night I walked into a bar.
I will tell you all that this is unusual for
me, since, well, 1 don't drink. I just needed
some material for stand-up and if you'll
notice, all the great stand-up jokes begin,
"so this guy walks into a bar," or "so this
carrot walks into a bar." So I figured I'd try
being that carrot.
I walked into the bar and I sat down. 1
said, "Bartender, I don't drink. What
should I have?" Well, he laughed his ass off.
Then I noticed this beautiful girl sitting next
to me whom I had not noticed when I ini
tially walked in and sat down; she turned
around to see what was so damn funny. She
looked me over as if she were appraising a
horse. Luckily, she didn't check my teeth.
She asked the bartender, "What's so
funny?"
And he said, "See this guy here; he
doesn't drink!"
So again, she looked at me over, this time
reassessing me, because obviously, her ini-

tial impression of me was dead wrong.
"You don't drink?" she said, "So why are
you in here?"
"To be honest," I said, "I wanted some
material for stand-up."
"stand-up?" she asked.
"Yeah, you know, I try to be funny."
"Right," she says, "Okay, well, in that
case, I will sleep with you if you can make
me laugh." This was, needless to say, a very
generous offer. I mean, I am a stand-up
comedian, this is what I do, and everyone
likes to laugh.
"Okay, well, let me ask you a question,
why are you offering me this? You're a very
attractive woman, you could obviously have
any guy you wanted."
She said, "Yes, but I haven't laughed in
12 years."
"Wow," I said, "That's a long time."
"Yes. But you only get one shot, other
wise it wouldn't be fair."
"Fair?" I asked.
"Yes, to all the other two bit comedians
that have tried so far." Whew, lots of pres
sure. "Besides, 1 didn't like them anyway,
they weren't pure."
"Pure?" I asked.
"Yes," she said, "They didn't want to
