						Brush with Death An experiment in sensory deprivation — no TV for a summer. 
### VICTOR FUSTÉ ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR 
I ran a little experiment this summer.
No, 1 didn't cross breed puppies and man
goes to make adorable yet edible family pets.
That would just be silly. The experiment 1
carried out during these long, arduous sum
mer months was one of perseverance,
endurance and what some might call sheer
insanity. I didn't watch TV.
That's right, not a single minute of tele
vised programming spewed from my box for
the last three months. It was a difficult deci
sion to come to considering my long history
with the denizens of TV land. The relation
ships that started with muppets and graduated
to Jack Bauer had sustained my imagination
for so many years that even a month without

my friends from the ether would be like yank
ing a heroin addict's needle.
The results of the experiment are troubling
yet hopeful. I know that as an entertainment
editor, I should be up on all things in the enter
tainment world and that by cutting of televi
sion 1 was effectively shooting myself in the
foot. But you know what I found? After a few
nights of withdrawal where 1 screamed in hor
ror at the baby crawling on the ceiling, 1 sud

denly found myself able to think more clearly.
And 1 had extra time. 1 was finally able to
accomplish all those tasks that took a back
seat to the adventures on "Scrubs." Even
though I could no longer sustain a conversa
tion around the water cooler, I was able to —
no joke — read a book for pleasure.
This is not an experiment I recommend
for everyone. It helps if you have a DVD
player and are able to gradually wean your
self with seasons of "Grey's Anatomy" or
"24." But if you really want to go cold turkey,
find yourself a good book and let that under
used muscled behind your eyes stretch its legs
and undo the decades of brain degradation
that mindless TV watching has done.
Just do make sure to conduct your own
experiment before "Lost" starts up again or
you're screwed.
