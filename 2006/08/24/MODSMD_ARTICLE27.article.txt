You won't find Big Bird, Elmo or the rest of the Sesame Street gang
teaching these A, B, C's in the morning. With "A" standing for "Ass
Kicking", "B" for "Boners" and "C" for "Copping a Feel" you get the
sense that this isn't your daddies' alphabet, though maybe it should
have been."The Alphabet of Manliness", the debut book by internet
legend Maddox, hit store shelves May 30, 2(X)6 courtesy of Citadel
Press. Since its release it has spent 12 consecutive weeks on the New
York Times bestseller list and with the hysterical and surprisingly
accurate descriptions and satire of what it truly is to be an alpha male,
one can hardly be surprised at its success. Maddox took some time out
of his busy book tour and world domination schedule to sit down and
give the Daily an exclusive interview concerning his website, his new
book, and his ever-increasing popularity.
George Ouzounian, a Utah programmer better known by his online
pen name Maddox, is the author of the immensely popular "Best Page
in the Universe" (http://maddox.xmission.com) which has become one
of the most heavily visited websites on the internet, clocking over 166
million hits to date and having over four million visitors a month.
When asked what made him create the website, Maddox responded
simply, "Mostly spite. 1 used to hang out in a chat room for program
mers when I was 16. My friends online noticed that 1 would complain
a lot, and they thought it was funny, so I started writing articles to post
on my web space that wasn't being put to use. I originally wrote arti
cles to spite my close friends and family, and by word-of-mouth alone,
the site has ballooned." He likes to point out that he has done no
advertising or changed the design of his site to make it more popular,
that its popularity is due completely to word-of-mouth, "Some of my
critics point out that the site looks like it was designed in 1997," said
Maddox, "Guilty as charged."
With the immense popularity and the status of being a living inter
net legend, a book seemed inevitable and Maddox appears to have
been planning one for a while. "The primary reason 1 wrote this book
wasn't for money. That's not to say that money wasn't part of the rea
son, because if it wasn't, I'd simply donate all the money to charity; but
we don't live in this fantasy Nickelodeon land of make-believe where
bills pay themselves, so money is always a factor," said Maddox, "The
main reason I wrote this book was for credibility. The book is a New
York Times bestseller. I'm no longer just some dude with a website.
People can't ignore me anymore when I want to move my other pro
jects."
As for what these projects may be, little was shared, though he did
describe his wish to pursue a more diminutive representation of him

self, "I've wanted to do action figures for a long time now. I want to do
a pirate character with lasers and a sword with grenades. He'd come
with his own grandpa in a rocking chair who would be abused and
yelled at," said Maddox, "My action figure would rock the universe."
Obviously. He also has a comic book titled "The Best Comic in the
Universe" which is to be available in the near future.
The book itself wasn't easy for Maddox to finally bring to light how-

good chance it'll be in this book."
ever, "Writing this book was by far
the hardest thing I've ever done. It
took me six months to write from
start to finish, and when I say six
months, 1 mean literally working
every day," said Maddox, "Labor
Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New
Year's Eve, Halloween, etc. There's
so much work that went into creat
ing this book that will never be seen
by anyone."
Along with all the writing its
respectable 204 page length, includ
ed are 145 illustrations. To find illus
trators, Maddox held an open com
petition through his website from
which he picked eight final contes
tants whom he hired to work on the
book. The coordination required to
get an illustrative cohesion through
out the "Alphabet" was a task in
and of itself. "In order to get a cohe
sive sense of style throughout this
book, I had to write a chat program
where the illustrators could upload
their work for each other to see,"
said Maddox, "Each illustration
took about three pages worth of
email to coordinate." The work paid
off however, as the illustrations are
stylish, crisp and varied, providing a
fantastic set of props for Maddox to
work with.
But how about the book itself? If
you're new to Maddox's biting satire
and merciless ranting, prepare for a
strong case of culture shock. As
Maddox clearly states in the forward
to his book, "This book is all about
men and what men like. It's the
definitive reference book about
manliness. If it needs to be shaved,
beaten, or sexed, there's a good
chance it'll be in this book."
He also provides a disclaimer and
a warning to the opposite sex, "If
you're standing around in a book
store with your thumb up your ass,
wondering why someone would
have a picture of a man punching a
gorilla on the cover of a book, this
book isn't for you. On the other
hand, maybe you're a woman and
you're reading this wondering "Is
this book just for men?" I would say
that it is only for men in the same
way that lesbian porn sites on the
Internet are only for women."
And it only gets more offensive
from there.
There is no line of sensitivity or
political correctness that Maddox is
aware of and that is what makes his
work not only conduce hysterical fits

of laughter but also ring of the kind
of truth that you could never admit
to the public for fear of a lawsuit.
From the "M is for Metal", which
describes the "metal effect"(an
opposite to the theory of the Mozart
effect, which states that playing
Mozart to your unborn child will
make them smarter, the "metal
effect" promotes playing metal
through headphones to your testi
cles to ensure that your kids will be
"the meanest sons o' bitches on the
block") to the "Q is for Quickie"
flowchart which guarantees you
action (though not who you get it
from), little to nothing of what it is
to be manly is left out of this book.
Proper role-models like Pirates
(P), Lumberjacks (L), and Chuck
Norris (N) are addressed, analyzed
and worshiped, and simple not-spo
ken-until-now rules such as urinal
etiquette (U) are addressed ("It's a
well-known fact that using a urinal
next to another man when you don't
absolutely need to means you want
to have sex with him.").
Yes, it's rude, it's crude and it's
terribly, terribly offensive, but that's
what the Maddox experience con
sists of. Maddox could honestly care
less about his critics and even prints
his hate mail on the back cover of
his book instead of praise, including
a hateful piece allegedly from his
own mother.
Judging by sales, his admirers
definitely outweigh his haters.
Maddox also had some words to
pass on to his fans at Stanford. "My
fan base, like me, is incredibly
smart," said Maddox, "but as for
Stanford, the school is ranked #79
on my list of colleges signed up for
my mailing list. Although you beat
out Harvard and Yale, there were 78
others with more determination
than you. 1 think there's only one
word to describe Stanford students:
underachieves."
All in all, "The Alphabet of
Manliness" truly is the best A-to-Z
guide for being a manly man to date
and merits a read from anyone own
ing an extra appendage south of the
border along with anyone else who
wants to laugh until their sides hurt.
If you're easily offended, steer clear,
but if you are looking for a good
laugh and an honest and amusing
satire of the alpha male in his natur
al form, look no further than
Maddox's new male bible.

ken-until-now rules such as urinal
etiquette (U) are addressed ("It's a
well-known fact that using a urinal
next to another man when you don't
absolutely need to means you want
to have sex with him.").
Yes, it's rude, it's crude and it's
terribly, terribly offensive, but that's
what the Maddox experience con
sists of. Maddox could honestly care
less about his critics and even prints
his hate mail on the back cover of
his book instead of praise, including
a hateful piece allegedly from his
own mother.
Judging by sales, his admirers
definitely outweigh his haters.
Maddox also had some words to
pass on to his fans at Stanford. "My
fan base, like me, is incredibly
smart," said Maddox, "but as for
Stanford, the school is ranked #79
on my list of colleges signed up for
my mailing list. Although you beat
out Harvard and Yale, there were 78
others with more determination
than you. 1 think there's only one
word to describe Stanford students:
underachieves."
All in all, "The Alphabet of
Manliness" truly is the best A-to-Z
guide for being a manly man to date
and merits a read from anyone own
ing an extra appendage south of the
border along with anyone else who
wants to laugh until their sides hurt.
If you're easily offended, steer clear,
but if you are looking for a good
laugh and an honest and amusing
satire of the alpha male in his natur
al form, look no further than
Maddox's new male bible.

PECS: And that wasn't the manliest part of the male anatomy he signed.
You won't find Big Bird, Elmo or the rest of the Sesame Street gang
teaching these A, B, C's in the morning. With "A" standing for "Ass
Kicking", "B" for "Boners" and "C" for "Copping a Feel" you get the
sense that this isn't your daddies' alphabet, though maybe it should
have been."The Alphabet of Manliness", the debut book by internet
legend Maddox, hit store shelves May 30, 2(X)6 courtesy of Citadel
Press. Since its release it has spent 12 consecutive weeks on the New
York Times bestseller list and with the hysterical and surprisingly
accurate descriptions and satire of what it truly is to be an alpha male,
one can hardly be surprised at its success. Maddox took some time out
of his busy book tour and world domination schedule to sit down and
give the Daily an exclusive interview concerning his website, his new
book, and his ever-increasing popularity.
George Ouzounian, a Utah programmer better known by his online
pen name Maddox, is the author of the immensely popular "Best Page
in the Universe" (http://maddox.xmission.com) which has become one
of the most heavily visited websites on the internet, clocking over 166
million hits to date and having over four million visitors a month.
When asked what made him create the website, Maddox responded
simply, "Mostly spite. 1 used to hang out in a chat room for program
mers when I was 16. My friends online noticed that 1 would complain
a lot, and they thought it was funny, so I started writing articles to post
on my web space that wasn't being put to use. I originally wrote arti
cles to spite my close friends and family, and by word-of-mouth alone,
the site has ballooned." He likes to point out that he has done no
advertising or changed the design of his site to make it more popular,
that its popularity is due completely to word-of-mouth, "Some of my
critics point out that the site looks like it was designed in 1997," said
Maddox, "Guilty as charged."
With the immense popularity and the status of being a living inter
net legend, a book seemed inevitable and Maddox appears to have
been planning one for a while. "The primary reason 1 wrote this book
wasn't for money. That's not to say that money wasn't part of the rea
son, because if it wasn't, I'd simply donate all the money to charity; but
we don't live in this fantasy Nickelodeon land of make-believe where
bills pay themselves, so money is always a factor," said Maddox, "The
main reason I wrote this book was for credibility. The book is a New
York Times bestseller. I'm no longer just some dude with a website.
People can't ignore me anymore when I want to move my other pro
jects."
As for what these projects may be, little was shared, though he did
describe his wish to pursue a more diminutive representation of him

self, "I've wanted to do action figures for a long time now. I want to do
a pirate character with lasers and a sword with grenades. He'd come
with his own grandpa in a rocking chair who would be abused and
yelled at," said Maddox, "My action figure would rock the universe."
Obviously. He also has a comic book titled "The Best Comic in the
Universe" which is to be available in the near future.
The book itself wasn't easy for Maddox to finally bring to light how-

good chance it'll be in this book."
ever, "Writing this book was by far
the hardest thing I've ever done. It
took me six months to write from
start to finish, and when I say six
months, 1 mean literally working
every day," said Maddox, "Labor
Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New
Year's Eve, Halloween, etc. There's
so much work that went into creat
ing this book that will never be seen
by anyone."
Along with all the writing its
respectable 204 page length, includ
ed are 145 illustrations. To find illus
trators, Maddox held an open com
petition through his website from
which he picked eight final contes
tants whom he hired to work on the
book. The coordination required to
get an illustrative cohesion through
out the "Alphabet" was a task in
and of itself. "In order to get a cohe
sive sense of style throughout this
book, I had to write a chat program
where the illustrators could upload
their work for each other to see,"
said Maddox, "Each illustration
took about three pages worth of
email to coordinate." The work paid
off however, as the illustrations are
stylish, crisp and varied, providing a
fantastic set of props for Maddox to
work with.
But how about the book itself? If
you're new to Maddox's biting satire
and merciless ranting, prepare for a
strong case of culture shock. As
Maddox clearly states in the forward
to his book, "This book is all about
men and what men like. It's the
definitive reference book about
manliness. If it needs to be shaved,
beaten, or sexed, there's a good
chance it'll be in this book."
He also provides a disclaimer and
a warning to the opposite sex, "If
you're standing around in a book
store with your thumb up your ass,
wondering why someone would
have a picture of a man punching a
gorilla on the cover of a book, this
book isn't for you. On the other
hand, maybe you're a woman and
you're reading this wondering "Is
this book just for men?" I would say
that it is only for men in the same
way that lesbian porn sites on the
Internet are only for women."
And it only gets more offensive
from there.
There is no line of sensitivity or
political correctness that Maddox is
aware of and that is what makes his
work not only conduce hysterical fits

of laughter but also ring of the kind
of truth that you could never admit
to the public for fear of a lawsuit.
From the "M is for Metal", which
describes the "metal effect"(an
opposite to the theory of the Mozart
effect, which states that playing
Mozart to your unborn child will
make them smarter, the "metal
effect" promotes playing metal
through headphones to your testi
cles to ensure that your kids will be
"the meanest sons o' bitches on the
block") to the "Q is for Quickie"
flowchart which guarantees you
action (though not who you get it
from), little to nothing of what it is
to be manly is left out of this book.
Proper role-models like Pirates
(P), Lumberjacks (L), and Chuck
Norris (N) are addressed, analyzed
and worshiped, and simple not-spo
ken-until-now rules such as urinal
etiquette (U) are addressed ("It's a
well-known fact that using a urinal
next to another man when you don't
absolutely need to means you want
to have sex with him.").
Yes, it's rude, it's crude and it's
terribly, terribly offensive, but that's

sists of. Maddox could honestly care
less about his critics and even prints

Judging by sales, his admirers
definitely outweigh his haters.
Maddox also had some words to
pass on to his fans at Stanford. "My

on my list of colleges signed up for

word to describe Stanford students:

All in all, "The Alphabet of
