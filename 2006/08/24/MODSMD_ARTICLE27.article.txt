You won't find Big Bird, Elmo or the rest of the Sesame Street gang
teaching these A, B, C's in the morning. With "A" standing for "Ass
Kicking", "B" for "Boners" and "C" for "Copping a Feel" you get the
sense that this isn't your daddies' alphabet, though maybe it should
have been."The Alphabet of Manliness", the debut book by internet
legend Maddox, hit store shelves May 30, 2(X)6 courtesy of Citadel
Press. Since its release it has spent 12 consecutive weeks on the New
York Times bestseller list and with the hysterical and surprisingly
accurate descriptions and satire of what it truly is to be an alpha male,
one can hardly be surprised at its success. Maddox took some time out
of his busy book tour and world domination schedule to sit down and
give the Daily an exclusive interview concerning his website, his new
book, and his ever-increasing popularity.
George Ouzounian, a Utah programmer better known by his online
pen name Maddox, is the author of the immensely popular "Best Page
in the Universe" (http://maddox.xmission.com) which has become one
of the most heavily visited websites on the internet, clocking over 166
million hits to date and having over four million visitors a month.
When asked what made him create the website, Maddox responded
simply, "Mostly spite. 1 used to hang out in a chat room for program
mers when I was 16. My friends online noticed that 1 would complain
a lot, and they thought it was funny, so I started writing articles to post
on my web space that wasn't being put to use. I originally wrote arti
cles to spite my close friends and family, and by word-of-mouth alone,
the site has ballooned." He likes to point out that he has done no
advertising or changed the design of his site to make it more popular,
that its popularity is due completely to word-of-mouth, "Some of my
critics point out that the site looks like it was designed in 1997," said
Maddox, "Guilty as charged."
With the immense popularity and the status of being a living inter
net legend, a book seemed inevitable and Maddox appears to have
been planning one for a while. "The primary reason 1 wrote this book
wasn't for money. That's not to say that money wasn't part of the rea
son, because if it wasn't, I'd simply donate all the money to charity; but
we don't live in this fantasy Nickelodeon land of make-believe where
bills pay themselves, so money is always a factor," said Maddox, "The
main reason I wrote this book was for credibility. The book is a New
York Times bestseller. I'm no longer just some dude with a website.
People can't ignore me anymore when I want to move my other pro
jects."
As for what these projects may be, little was shared, though he did
describe his wish to pursue a more diminutive representation of him

self, "I've wanted to do action figures for a long time now. I want to do
a pirate character with lasers and a sword with grenades. He'd come
with his own grandpa in a rocking chair who would be abused and
yelled at," said Maddox, "My action figure would rock the universe."
Obviously. He also has a comic book titled "The Best Comic in the
Universe" which is to be available in the near future.
The book itself wasn't easy for Maddox to finally bring to light how-

good chance it'll be in this book."
