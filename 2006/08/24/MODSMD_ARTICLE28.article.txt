# AT THE MOVIE HOUSE
## "Rocky" with football pads INVINCIBLE 
### RYAN LAMPE ENTERTAINMENT LINEMAN 
When I first mentioned to a friend that I was
seeing the new Mark Wahlberg football movie,

her first response was "But
Ryan, you don't know any
thing about football!" A
valid point, but I reasoned
that I at least knew some
thing about sports movies.
(And to be fair, I did see
Oliver Stone's "Any Given
Sunday." It wasn't at all
entertaining, so it must have
been educational!)
It's clear while watching
"Invincible" that its produc-

ers also understand something about
sports movies. But the end result is far
from the runaway touchdown they were

aiming for.
"Invincible" is inspired by the true
story of Vince Papale. Papale attended

St. Joseph's College from 1964 to
1968 on an athletic scholarship for
Track and Field. After graduating
with a MS Degree in Marketing/
Management Science, he worked as a
bartender and substitute-teacher. In

1974, Papale tried out for the
Philadelphia Bell of the World Football

League. He played with them for 2 years
before successfully trying out for the
Philadelphia Eagles. Since St. Joseph's
College didn't have a football team, Papale

became the oldest rookie in NFL history
(outside kickers) to play without college
experience. This accolade earned him the
nickname "Rocky."

The wide-receiver played three seasons
with the Eagles before retiring with a shoul
der injury in 1979. The movie stays true to the

basics of this story but changes many of the
specifics. Vince's time with the Philadelphia
Bell, in particular, is ignored.

Like most sports films, "Invincible" is one
about redemption. And the movie wastes little
time establishing that Vince (Mark Wahlberg) is
down on his luck and in need of a break. Within

Invincible'
Dir. Ericson Core

fifteen minutes he loses both his part-time job as
a substitute teacher and his wife of five years who
is convinced that he will always be a loser.
However, when the new coach of the Philadelphia
Eagles, Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear), holds open

try-outs, Vince's luck begins
to change.
In the lead role,
Wahlberg is likable but noth
ing more. Given the right
role, Wahlberg can be effec
tive ("Boogie Nights" and
"Three Kings" come to
mind) but this is certainly not
one of them. Kinnear fares
much better as coach
Vermeil, again proving how
solid he can be in supporting

roles. Kirk Acevedo and Kevin Conway are
equally good. Playing Vince's closest friend
and father respectively, the two actors gen-

erate most of the film's goodwill. Sadly,
Elizabeth Banks is much less convinc-

ing as a gorgeous football fan who
works at Vince's bar. Her relation-

ship with the rising star is contrived,
obvious and dull.

Though Vince's real life story is

a good one, it's never completely

engaging on screen. At least, it's not
engaging in this movie. As "Invincible"
unfolds, it's always obvious Vince will
succeed. Vince has no obstacles, physical
or psychological, to prevent him. So it's

really just a matter of time. In "Rocky,"
Stallone's character has significant emo
tional barriers that prevent him from sue-

ceeding and the film is much more involv
ing because of that. Furthermore, there

seems to be very little at stake in
"Invincible." "Cinderella Man" was overly
saccharine, but at least Russell Crowe's char-

acter was risking something by fighting. Vince
has little riding on his performance with the
Eagles, certainly no starving family to feed.
Still, it's hard to really dislike a movie like

"Invincible." It's earnest, well-made and has
some nice performances. But if offers absolutely
nothing new. We've seen it all before and, in
some instances, done a lot better.
