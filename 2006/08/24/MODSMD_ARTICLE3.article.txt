### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a five-month search, the Dean of
Students office named Maureen Powers its new
dean, Aug. 21. Powers will begin her new job
Sept. 18.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gregory
Boardman served as the last fulltime dean of stu
dents. In the interim, Associate Dean and
Director of the Graduate Life Office Christine
Griffith and Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Thom Massey oversaw the responsibilities of the
office.
These include directing the Office of Judicial
Affairs, Office of Student Activities, Student
Unions, multicultural education and all six eth
nic and community centers. The dean of stu
dents also advises the Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU) and has adminis

trative oversight for the Haas Center for Public
Service.
While fulfilling the varied duties as the dean
of students, Powers believes that her role is to be
an advocate for students first and foremost.
"Stanford has a tradition of involving stu
dents with decision making, and I hope to con
tinue along these lines by helping students and
the University to always keep students at the
forefront of the decision-making process,"
Powers said. "I am someone who will listen
carefully to the concerns of every student.
Through listening, I hope to provide all stu
dents with the best possible experience during
their time at Stanford."
Powers anticipates that the dean of students'
position will be challenging, but she is nonethe
less eager to get started.
"I am anxious to learn all that I can from the
student body and my colleagues to do the best
job possible for the University," Powers said.
ASSU Vice President Lauren Graham said
Powers exceled in the interview process.
"As with any administrative candidate who is
filling an administrative position, she will face

the challenge of adjusting to the unique Stanford
culture - both in terms of the bureaucracy
involved in getting things done, and as a west
coast institution," Graham said.
Dean of Student Affairs Gregory Boardman
said in a press release that he believes Powers
has "great integrity, vision, managerial sophisti
cation and a true dedication to the welfare of stu
dents."
"With her candor, thoughtfulness, and ener
getic personality, Maureen will add an innova
tive perspective to the talented staff in the stu
dent affairs division," Boardman said. "I have no
doubt that she will make vital contributions to
the quality of the student experience at Stanford,
and 1 enthusiastically anticipate a productive
partnership."
Powers comes to the University after serv
ing as a senior student affairs officer at five
institutions, most recently as Vice President for
Student Affairs at the City College of New
York. She also has held senior management
roles with the Institute for the International
Education of Students and a private consulting
firm.
