# Letter to the Editor
## Merced brief inaccurate and unfair UC rep tells Daily editors that brief on Merced doesn't tell whole story about new $500 million school 
### 
Having read your brief article on UC Merced
in the Aug. 10 edition of the Stanford Daily, we
feel there are some errors that must be correct
ed.
First, of the 9,000 students who applied to UC
Merced, 6,000 students were admitted. The
12,300 figure you used includes referrals.
Second, as of the date of your article, we had
more than 600 SIRS, and had more than 550 in
May when the first SIRs were reported. Actual
attendance numbers will be confirmed during
third-week census in September.
Third, more than three buildings exist on the
UC Merced campus. We have two fully function
al classroom buildings, one for science and engi
neering, which is complete with labs, and the
other for social sciences, humanities and arts,
plus a 120,000-square-foot library, a recreation
and-wellness center, a dining commons and sev

eral residence halls.
Fourth, your article states that there are no
local eateries or businesses. We'd like to point
out that Merced is a town of 75,000 people that
was fully inhabited before UC Merced opened.
There are hundreds of local businesses and
restaurants in the welcoming downtown. Heck,
we even have a Barnes & Noble. And three
Starbucks!
Lastly, we'd like to point out the obvious
ridiculousness of comparing UC Merced —at
least for now —with Stanford. UC Merced is
just starting its second year. Stanford has been
around since 1891. Comparing the two is like
comparing the successes of a fully grown adult
with an infant.
In the future, we suggest that you and other
Stanford Daily reporters actually contact some
one here in the communications office to get the

facts straight about UC Merccd before writing
articles.
