Stanford Shopping
Center faces future
expansion
Stanford Shopping Center could experience a 20
percent expansion, including the construction of a
hotel, if preliminary negotiations by Palo Alto offi
cials continue.
The city, looking to increase its sales tax revenue,
of which the center is its largest generator, discussed
how to achieve an increase of $2 million per year in
revenue from the center, July 31. Although not
directly related, the center itself could increase
250,000 square feet, from the 1.4 million square feet it
currently covers.
Following in the footsteps of local malls such as
Valley Fair in San Jose, Stanford Shopping Center's
managing Simon Property Group is considering the
proposals made by the city. No actual work would
commence until probably seven years from now.
However, the center's expansion also requires
consideration of Stanford Medical Center's "immi
nent redevelopment," said Bill Phillips, managing
director of real estate for the Stanford Management
Company. Needing an update to meet earthquake
safety standards, the next-door medical center may
also require expansion.

Stanford ties for fourth in
annual ranking
Stanford tied for fourth with the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the California Institute
of Technology in this year's U.S. News and World
Report college ranking. Princeton, after tying for
three years with Harvard, took first place, followed
by its rival, with Yale in third.
The "America's Best Colleges" issue, which hit
newsstands Monday, named Williams the top liberal
arts college, and the University of California,
Berkeley the top public university, at No. 21 overall.
The ranking are based primarily on reputation
assessments by peer institutions, as well as graduation
and retention rates, faculty, financial resources, and
alumni donations.
The top ranking are as follows:
1 Princeton University
2 Harvard University
3 Yale University
4 Stanford University, California Institute of
Technology, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (tic)

University hands over soccer
complex to city
The University recently handed over a $4 million
soccer complex at the corner of Page Mill Road and
El Camino Real to the city of Palo Alto as the first
part of their controversial Mayfield Agreement.
The six-acre complex features two full-size fields
and a practice lot, which have been used by residents
in the past, though not officially owned by the city.
With a grand opening in late September, the area will
now be for Palo Alto use only.
Palo Alto's 51-year lease for $1 a year has upset
local residents because the deal with Stanford allows
the University to build 250 units of multifamily hous
ing along California Avenue, as well as redevelop
30,(XM) square feet of commercial space in Stanford
Research Park.
Residents worry the new housing will block views,
as it can be up to 50 feet in height. An unsuccessful
petition circulated so that plans could continue.
