## On Campus Status attracts How to win a woman: feign importance 
### 
Until recently, the
main things I
thought of as
indicators of reproduc
tive potential were
things like hip-to-waist
ratio, income, sec
ondary sex characteris-

tics, and so on — things
we normally recognize as related to childbearing or support
ing a family, and generally to good genes.
However, I was leaving something out.:
Someone (don't ask who) showed me a few pages from an
on-line book he was reading about how to attract women.
This book stated emphatically that one needn't be rich or
successful, tall or muscular to score with women. In fact, the
book actually dissuaded men from focusing on success for
attraction's sake or putting too much energy into augmenting
secondary sex characteristics like arms and abs. Instead, the
book said, men should focus on what matters most for getting
women: the semblance of social status.
Note that it didn't say 'actual' social status. According to
the book, it doesn't matter so much how many friends you
have or how many people invite you to their parties — what
matters is seeming like you're the sort of person with 500 face
book friends, who's also president of their fraternity. That's
right — the emphasis is on 'seeming' like such a person.
And how can a man seem high-value, especially to high
value women? By treating them as though he thinks he's high
er status than they are. He can level partially disguised insults,
*not* buy them drinks, or pretend to be uninterested in the
women he's pursuing. While he's treating them as though he's
far superior to them, he can seduce them by pretending to
think they're below him.
This reminded me of The Rules for Women, which gives
the second sex tips on how to seem uninterested in men. The
authors suggest never making the first move, never returning
calls until you've hooked the guy, and limiting phone conver
sations to four minutes by saying "I'm busy, gotta go!"
The best strategy for both men and women, these books
suggest, is to feign high status by treating the object of desire
as though they are lower status.
But then again, isn't feigned status almost indistinguishable
from real status? Or rather, status is not an inherent property
of people but rather a phenomenon built from what other
people think about them.
Assuming the status one projects becomes one's actual sta
tus, can we make the next step to fit status into the genetic par
adigm?
Yes, it does indeed seem that high-status people can have
more offspring or at least offspring who themselves have high
social status. Keith Henson writes in the Human Nature
Review, "Of all the factors that have been measured in such
representative ancestral environments as we have (including
chimps), social standing is the most predictive of reproductive
success."
Henson writes that "the potential rewards for obtaining
high social status were —and still are —higher for males.
High status males had multiple wives or additional mating
opportunities in the ancestral environment (and for that mat
ter, still do)." For evidence of high-status males having many
children, he cites Gordon P. Getty's 'extra' family with three
children and Brigham Young's 47 children. For women, he
writes, "High status females, from what we can see in chim
panzees and humans, have no more offspring than low status
ones, but their children arc more likely to survive." Moreover,
those children of high-status fathers are likely to be high-sta
tus themselves.
Finally, it makes more sense. Social status is actually an
extremely good predictor of reproductive success, so no won
der the book said to attract women by projecting high status.
And the premise of the book was that social status isn't
fixed at all.
