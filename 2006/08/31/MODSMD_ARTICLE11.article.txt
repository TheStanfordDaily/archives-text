# A Brush with Reality
## When a columnist's high school stops being polite 
### SINI MATIKAINEN OPINIONS EDITOR 
In case you don't keep up with MTV
news (and really, you would be a ter
rible human being if you didn't), I
thought 1 would let you know that MTV
is making a reality TV show about my
high school. You cannot possibly imagine
how exciting this is for me, that the same
minds that brought us My Super Sweet
Sixteen, Laguna Beach and The Real
World are going to be offering the same
treatment for my high school — one that
will be, I'm sure, the paragon of taste and
fairness.
You see, my high school has this little
oF football team that's better than all the
other little oF football teams in the coun
try, making it the best high school foot
ball team in America (according to USA
Today, at least). Add that to the fact that
it's in, of all places, the South, and the
combination of high school drama, foot
ball, and the innate hilarity of Alabama
must have made it impossible for the
heads at MTV to resist. I can just imagine
the pitch meeting: "OK, so we've got this
Alabama high school football team. It's
tense. It's southern. It's Rudy meets
Sweet Home Alabama meets Laguna
Beach."
I should say as a disclaimer that I
haven't actually seen the show. It is prob
ably in the worst of taste to judge the
show without having seen it myself, but
as I am, alas, in the uncivilized country of
Finland (which has MTV but not, if you

can believe it, a fascination with
American football), so I don't have the
opportunity. I should reassure you, how
ever, that Finland is the happy recipient
of treasures like Whoopi Goldberg's
short-lived sitcom, Whoopi, so we aren't
completely culturally deprived.
But even without having seen it (the
reality TV show, I mean — I have, unfor
tunately, seen Whoopi), I think 1 have a
pretty good idea of what it's going to be
like based on the commercial. 1 have a
feeling which, you may call it crazy, but I
think that they are going to make it look
like our community is obsessed with foot
ball. I think that maybe, just maybe, they
are going to show the Coach (even now, I
dare not invoke his name, lest he find me
and throw a sun visor at me) getting
angry and hurling things around, and pos
sibly giving a Big Speech right before the
Big Game, in which he says something to
the effect of "his Daddy didn't raise no
losers." I also have a strong feeling that
they are going to show a tasteful repre
sentation of religion in the south, in
which a minister prays for the football
team's success and says, "Gawd has
ORDAINED that we will win, for we are
the CHOSEN and the other team shall
be CAST into the depths of DEFEAT."
I can't say that this doesn't happen. I
have no idea what kind of craziness goes
on behind the doors to the football lock
er room, whose benches were rumored to
be made of pure gold and towels spun of
finest silk. You see, believe it or not, I
was neither a football player nor a cheer
leader in high school, since I was devoting
myself to an equally stressful and well
respected activity.
Yes. I was a varsity mathlete.

It was, in many ways, quite similar.
We had tournaments. We had trophies.
We even had a playbook, which had for
mulas and math tricks inside. And you
better not let that baby fall into the rival
team's hands, or they'll know how to find
the perimeter of a triangle circumscribed
around a circle of a given radius too. Or
what seven factorial equals. (5040. If you
don't know what "factorial" means, you
were probably much cooler than I was in
high school.)
But despite all these striking similar
ities, we were somehow not taken quite
as seriously at Hoover as the football
team was, and I don't exactly recall any
harrowing last minute pep talks in which
the Coach threatened to rip out my
throat if 1 messed up. Also — and this is
probably the biggest difference — we are
not currently the subject of an MTV real
ity TV show. Why, I can't imagine — I
mean, those national math honor society
tournaments got pretty crazy sometimes!
So maybe I'm being too hard on the
show, my bad feelings actually just jeal
ousy over the football team narrowly
edging out the math team as MTV's
focus. Maybe the show will be brilliant. I
mean, yes, it will probably stereotype the
South as football-obsessed and back
wards, dismiss all other academic and
extracurricular aspects of my high school
as unworthy of mention and provide a
melodramatic editing job to rework life
into a bad teen drama, but it also teaches
a valuable lesson to people all over the
country: the fact that Alabamians actual
ly wear shoes.
And if I never have to explain that to
someone again, it will be a good show
indeed.
