# Being Frank
## 
### 
I've been occasionally known to list
masturbation as a hobby. I find that as
conversation pieces go, it's a pretty
good way to crack a joke. Someone asks
you about how you spend your spare time
and you reply with a list of this and that,
before finishing off with: "...And given the
state of my sex life, I suppose masturba
tion should count too."
People used to lap this kind of non
sense up when 1 was younger. These days,
though, everything is a little different.
It's not that the line doesn't get the
laughs it used to — I mean, that my jokes
often fall flat should come as no surprise
to anyone who's had the misfortune of my
company — it's that I've started to feel
awkward discussing my masturbation
habits with complete strangers.
Actually, it's more than masturbation.
As the years roll by and the halcyon days
of youth recede ever further into the dis
tance, frank conversation becomes ever
harder to pull off.
Back in the day, when I was a younger
man both in full command of his faculties
and not yet suffering from the agony of
arthritis, the idle chitchat with which I
used to pass the lime was crude, blunt
and, most importantly, had practically no

forbidden topics.
How times change.
Friendship is hard to forge. Harder, in
many ways, than the mishmash of emo
tional confusion that passes for love. I
suppose this may be due to some biologi
cal imperative; while we are compelled to
get laid, the same is not true of going
down the pub with a mate for a couple of
pints and packet of salt and vinegar crisps.
And the absence of imperative mat
ters. There are barriers to forming rela
tionships. We are, by inclination, often
solitary and wary of the new. We guard
ourselves, and especially our thoughts,
with the utmost care.
When you meet someone, it's the bar
riers that determine the shape of the rela
tionship. Strangers will collide at parties,
talk until they find some point of disagree
ment and then bounce off each other and
on to the next target.
It didn't used to be like that. Before we
were grown ups, the blockades were bare
ly there. My college days were filled with
late night ramblings on everything from
politics to appropriate use of toilet paper
(fold or crush), with nary a taboo subject.
Now, I can't say I miss the late night part
(I prefer to sleep these days), but it was

great when conversations would flow with
out the constraints of proper behavior.
Of course, friendship itself doesn't die
because of this. It just doesn't grow.
Long term readers will recognize the
gentle undertone of a previous column in
today's musings. As well as the standard
apologies for plagiarism (which, at least, is
from myself), I shall offer the following
defense for repeating myself — This is a
big deal. (Also, presumably due to ever
decreasing numbers of brain cells, I'm
running out of things to say.)
Life becomes progressively emptier
and death more meaningful. Goals disap
pear and goal posts move. Success turns to
failure and failure turns to acceptance.
Profound becomes melodramatic and
deep becomes pathetic. And, as all of this
takes place, friendship is the only remnant
of youth that survives. So to see it fade,
shrivel and die is a little disconcerting.
On that cheery note, that's all for this
week folks. Enjoy the long weekend!
