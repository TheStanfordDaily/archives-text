## Michael Wilkerson Katrina: a powerful example One year later, important domestic and global lessons about chaos, instability, disorder 
### 
Tuesday solemnly marked the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. State
agencies and local media in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, the
states hardest hit, estimate total deaths of over 1800 people from the
storm, and about $82 billion in property damage.

Aside from the dry statistics, more lasting
impressions were created by the pictures
that won't go away. Residents desperately
trying to escape the area before the storm hit
on crowded highways. Those too poor, stub
born, or unlucky to get out in time pleading
for help, waving flags, bright clothing and
signs at the news helicopters that surveyed
the aftermath. Broken windows and strewn
goods showing evidence of the looting that
took place in a city abandoned by the rule of
law. Thousands of cots lying side by side in a
football stadium, demonstrating just how
unprepared for the storm organizers were at
all levels of government. Houses torn apart
and flooded, remaining vacant after a year.
The city of New Orleans was effectively
drowned, and with it went the credibility of
a government that claimed to have learned
from catastrophes past, and a president that
bragged about the "mandate" given to him
by the American people to represent their
interests. Now, one year later, the Gulf
Coast region is being hit by a new flood —
apologies. But regret is not the same as
improvement, and there are valuable lessons
for the future of the country at home and
internationally.
On Tuesday, the president visited New
Orleans, the site of the worst damage and
took "full responsibility" for the govern
ment's embarrassing performance during
the emergency. News shows played clips of
the destruction and then rebuilding efforts,
and there were feature stories with refugees
who are now trying to rebuild their lives. If
you think this sequence sounds familiar, say
reminiscent of the events of September 11,
2002, you are not alone.
The similarities continue. Again a disas
ter uncovered serious deficiencies across the
board in domestic policy. The storm caused
one of the most catastrophic disasters, natur
al or otherwise, ever to occur on U.S. soil.
The national emergency response system,
supposedly revamped after September 11,
was revealed to be inadequate and unready.
A House investigation into the response
published a report in February entitled "A
Failure of Initiative" that castigated the fed
eral relief attempts.
Accusations of institutional racism and
discrimination against the poor — which
began with those stranded demanding to
know why no help was on the way — shook
a country that learned that its claims of
equality and opportunity might be merely
superficial. Though officials tried to play up
the fact that there appeared to be no income
correlation within the deaths, there is little
question that those who were stranded, who
couldn't get out in time, who were packed
into the Superdome, who now can't afford to
rebuild or even make it back to New Orleans

are overwhelmingly in the lowest income
bracket. With the Bush administration
claiming validation every time estimates of
job creation increase, it is crucial to ask why
the trickle down effects of supply side tax
cuts seem not to have reached the Gulf
Coast's poor, and what the plan is now that
ignoring the poor and citing statistics about
net growth is no longer a palatable option.
The hurricane and rebuilding of New
Orleans could also provide an important
perspective in dealing with global issues.
CNN reporter Jeff Koinange, who covered
the hurricane, wrote yesterday, "I've trav

eled to close to half-a-dozen refugee and dis
placed people's camps across Africa — from
Sierra Leone to Uganda, Kenya to Congo —
in the year since Hurricane Katrina devas
tated New Orleans....And each time, I get
this feeling of deja vu."
In the paralyzed post-hurricane city the
U.S. was given a taste of conditions many
poor countries face in a normal day, and we
must harness that knowledge in efforts to
promote development and reduce violence
in those environments. New Orleans' inade
quate preparations showed the problems
corruption and neglect can cause, reinforc

ing how crucial responsible government is in
developing countries.
Even more importantly, the experience
of New Orleans — where worrisome insta
bility ensued with relatively minor disorder
— offers an important insight into the rise of
Islamic militancy which has occurred most
recently in Somalia, but also in Afghanistan,
Palestine and Chechnya. Chaos breeds
extremism. Looting, fighting and raping
were tragically common in the post-hurru
cane calm, and there was no one around to
do anything about it.
Now imagine that scenario in place for
years. After a certain length of time living in
"[New Orleans was] a
taste of conditions
many poor countries
face in a normal day."
fear with no guarantees about any facet of
everyday life, any sort of government is
preferable to none. Would you trade a gov
ernment that stones adulterers for the abili
ty to walk to the store safely? For most, the
answer becomes absolutely. A repressive
regime claiming religious credibility is fast
forming and therefore perfectly placed to
take over in an unstable situation.
There is a strong belief that this radical
Islamic trend is based on a cultural differ
ence. Proponents of this view include
respected scholars like Samuel Huntington
who argues this in his award-winning book
Clash of Civilizations. Less credibly, but
equally if not more prominently, pundits like
Ann Coulter pursue the same line with
claims that the solution to terrorism is for
the United States to "invade their countries,
kill their leaders and convert them to
Christianity."
But if those trapped in New Orleans had
not been eventually rescued, if there was no
one above to come and instill order, is it
really such a stretch to think that a leader
who could promise the rule of law would be
able to take control, no matter how terrible
he or she was? Philosopher Thomas Hobbes
wrote in the 17th century that the first
responsibility of government is to provide
security to its citizens. What would you do?
Whatever the true extent of the damage,
the real measure of what Hurricane Katrina
did to New Orleans as a city, the Gulf Coast
as a region and the U.S. as a nation, will be

PAIN: On the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, two victims continue to suffer from lack of
development and lingering instability in the region. Katrina showed the danger of instability.
Tuesday solemnly marked the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. State
agencies and local media in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, the
states hardest hit, estimate total deaths of over 1800 people from the
storm, and about $82 billion in property damage.

Aside from the dry statistics, more lasting
impressions were created by the pictures
that won't go away. Residents desperately
trying to escape the area before the storm hit
on crowded highways. Those too poor, stub
born, or unlucky to get out in time pleading
for help, waving flags, bright clothing and
signs at the news helicopters that surveyed
the aftermath. Broken windows and strewn
goods showing evidence of the looting that
took place in a city abandoned by the rule of
law. Thousands of cots lying side by side in a
football stadium, demonstrating just how
unprepared for the storm organizers were at
all levels of government. Houses torn apart
and flooded, remaining vacant after a year.
The city of New Orleans was effectively
drowned, and with it went the credibility of
a government that claimed to have learned
from catastrophes past, and a president that
bragged about the "mandate" given to him
by the American people to represent their
interests. Now, one year later, the Gulf
Coast region is being hit by a new flood —
apologies. But regret is not the same as
improvement, and there are valuable lessons
for the future of the country at home and
internationally.
On Tuesday, the president visited New
Orleans, the site of the worst damage and
took "full responsibility" for the govern
ment's embarrassing performance during
the emergency. News shows played clips of
the destruction and then rebuilding efforts,
and there were feature stories with refugees
who are now trying to rebuild their lives. If
you think this sequence sounds familiar, say
reminiscent of the events of September 11,
2002, you are not alone.
The similarities continue. Again a disas
ter uncovered serious deficiencies across the
board in domestic policy. The storm caused
one of the most catastrophic disasters, natur
al or otherwise, ever to occur on U.S. soil.
The national emergency response system,
supposedly revamped after September 11,
was revealed to be inadequate and unready.
A House investigation into the response
published a report in February entitled "A
Failure of Initiative" that castigated the fed
eral relief attempts.
Accusations of institutional racism and
discrimination against the poor — which
began with those stranded demanding to
know why no help was on the way — shook
a country that learned that its claims of
equality and opportunity might be merely
superficial. Though officials tried to play up
the fact that there appeared to be no income
correlation within the deaths, there is little
question that those who were stranded, who
couldn't get out in time, who were packed
into the Superdome, who now can't afford to
rebuild or even make it back to New Orleans

are overwhelmingly in the lowest income
bracket. With the Bush administration
claiming validation every time estimates of
job creation increase, it is crucial to ask why
the trickle down effects of supply side tax
cuts seem not to have reached the Gulf
Coast's poor, and what the plan is now that
ignoring the poor and citing statistics about
net growth is no longer a palatable option.
The hurricane and rebuilding of New
Orleans could also provide an important
perspective in dealing with global issues.
CNN reporter Jeff Koinange, who covered
the hurricane, wrote yesterday, "I've trav

eled to close to half-a-dozen refugee and dis
placed people's camps across Africa — from
Sierra Leone to Uganda, Kenya to Congo —
in the year since Hurricane Katrina devas
tated New Orleans....And each time, I get
this feeling of deja vu."
In the paralyzed post-hurricane city the
U.S. was given a taste of conditions many
poor countries face in a normal day, and we
must harness that knowledge in efforts to
promote development and reduce violence
in those environments. New Orleans' inade
quate preparations showed the problems
corruption and neglect can cause, reinforc

ing how crucial responsible government is in
developing countries.
Even more importantly, the experience
of New Orleans — where worrisome insta
bility ensued with relatively minor disorder
— offers an important insight into the rise of
Islamic militancy which has occurred most
recently in Somalia, but also in Afghanistan,
Palestine and Chechnya. Chaos breeds
extremism. Looting, fighting and raping
were tragically common in the post-hurru
cane calm, and there was no one around to
do anything about it.
Now imagine that scenario in place for
years. After a certain length of time living in
"[New Orleans was] a
taste of conditions
many poor countries
face in a normal day."
fear with no guarantees about any facet of
everyday life, any sort of government is
preferable to none. Would you trade a gov
ernment that stones adulterers for the abili
ty to walk to the store safely? For most, the
answer becomes absolutely. A repressive
regime claiming religious credibility is fast
forming and therefore perfectly placed to
take over in an unstable situation.
There is a strong belief that this radical
Islamic trend is based on a cultural differ
ence. Proponents of this view include
respected scholars like Samuel Huntington
who argues this in his award-winning book
Clash of Civilizations. Less credibly, but
equally if not more prominently, pundits like
Ann Coulter pursue the same line with
claims that the solution to terrorism is for
the United States to "invade their countries,
kill their leaders and convert them to
Christianity."
But if those trapped in New Orleans had
not been eventually rescued, if there was no
one above to come and instill order, is it
really such a stretch to think that a leader
who could promise the rule of law would be
able to take control, no matter how terrible
he or she was? Philosopher Thomas Hobbes
wrote in the 17th century that the first
responsibility of government is to provide
security to its citizens. What would you do?
Whatever the true extent of the damage,
the real measure of what Hurricane Katrina
did to New Orleans as a city, the Gulf Coast
as a region and the U.S. as a nation, will be
known in the future.
Apologizing and accepting responsibility
is important.
The first step to fixing problems is identi
fying them. But the second more important
step is fixing them.
