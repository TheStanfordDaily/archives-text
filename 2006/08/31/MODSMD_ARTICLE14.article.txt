## WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL Cardinal open with win against UCSB 
### 
ADRIAN GAITAN
MANAGING EDITOR
Coming off a disappointing
second round upset at last year's
NCAA tournament, the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball
team (1-0) opened the 2006 sea
son with a win over UCSB on
Saturday, 30-20, 30-26, 30-25.
UCSB (1-1) came up short
against a determined Stanford
team aided by the return of out
side hitter Cynthia Barboza. The
sophomore Barboza, who had
been out since last October after
a devastating ACL tear, showed
no signs of being rusty .
Stanford also returned three
All-Arnericans, including senior
Kristin Richards, junior Bryn
Kehoe, and last season's Pac-10
Freshman of the Year, sopho
more Foluke Akinradewo. All
three contributed significantly to
Stanford's win.
But it was Barboza who led
the charge against the Gauchos,
keeping the Cardinal in the
match and eventually leading
them to the win. Logging 10 kills
during the match, including sev
eral key kills in the third game,
Barboza looked as though she
had not missed a day of practice.
The Cardinal came out slug
gish in the first game, and UCSB
grabbed a 4-0 lead. After settling
down, Stanford came back to 9-5
with the help of two kills by
Barboza. Kehoe and Richards
helped the Cardinal to a more
comfortable lead with a four
point run of their own, making it
17-10. Kehoe had an amazing 11
assists in game one, propelling
the Card to a fairly easy win.
Game two was much closer

than anyone might have expect
ed. The Gauchos kept the score
close early in the game, capitaliz
ing on Stanford mistakes, which
included running into the net and
several serving errors. Both
teams traded off the lead in the
last half until Stanford broke
away after a block by sophomore
Erin Waller late in the game.
Thanks in part to Richards and
Akinradewo's 21 combined kills,
Stanford needed only one more
win to take the match.
Stanford ran to an early lead
in the third game, prompting
Santa Barbara to call a timeout to
regroup. A series of strange
events led to a Santa Barbara run
after the timeout.
After some confusion as to
who was supposed to serve,
UCSB's Rebecca Saraceno
served a fairly returnable ball to
the Card. However, miscommu
nication between Richards,
Akinradewo, and Kehoe led to
Akinradewo just barely setting
the ball on the second hit for
Barboza. Barboza managed to
control the return from senior
Olivia Waldowski enough for the
Stanford return. Kehoe, howev
er, tripped over Barboza, sending
Barboza to a hard fall on the
court, and Kehoe fell on her after
accidentally hitting the ball on
Stanford's side. Barboza got up
with a grimace, but continued to
play. UCSB then grabbed the
lead with a 5-0 run. including an
ace that forced Stanford coach
John Dunning to call a timeout.
After the timeout, and
Dunning's instructions to "have
some energy," Stanford returned
with more emotion and intensity.
Barboza seemed hardened by the

fall, aggressively attacking the
net as fellow sophomores Waller
and Jessica Fishburn helped lead
Stanford to a 30-25 win.
Stanford will follow the
strong showing with a six-game
road trip. Next weekend, the
Cardinal will participate in the
BYU Tournament in Utah, fol
lowed by the Waikiki Beach
Marriott Volleyball Challenge
the following weekend, where
Stanford will meet up against

No. 7 Hawaii.
NOTES...Despite classes not
being in session for another
month, the game was attended by
a large crowd, nearly filling the
lower bowl of Maples...While the
band remains suspended for
July's investigation of the Band
Shak vandalism, several mem
bers were present at the game
informally without uniforms or
instruments, serving instead as
the student section.
