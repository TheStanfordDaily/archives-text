## Season starts with consecutive losses

MANAGING EDITOR
Fresh from a successful off-season and exhibi
tion games, Stanford's men's soccer faced two
ranked opponents last weekend. Stanford was
held goalless, falling to both No. 18 Santa Clara
and No. 17 San Francisco in hard fought games.
An excited Cardinal team faced the aggressive
Santa Clara Broncos Friday night. Senior mid
fielder Galen Thompson made two shots on goal,
including an agonizingly close one in the 39th
minute of the final period. Sophomore standout
T.J. Novak also had a shot on goal.
The game was tied until an unlucky foul was
called in the penalty box in the 48th minute.
Junior midfielder Peter Lowry made the penalty
kick to take the Broncos to 1-0.
The Cardinal defense kept Santa Clara score
less after that, but the Broncos managed seven
shots on goal, compared to Stanford's three.
Redshirt freshman goalie Brent Stewart made
two saves in his collegiate start.
Sunday's game also proved disappointing.
USF's Ardalan Attar scored on a header in the
33rd minute. Junior Adam Bergman sealed the
win with a goal in the 80th minute after facing
freshman goalie John Moore one-on-one.
Despite the relative youth of the goalies, the
team has confidence. "They are young,"
Thompson says, "but I would put them up there
with the best keepers we will see this year."
Looking past the losses, the team hopes to cre
ate more goal opportunities against Princeton
and Army this weekend. "Our defending has
been solid and we have been organized. Now we
need to be able to create and be composed
around goal."
Thompson remains optimistic. "These two
games are behind us, and we will build on them as
the season goes on, but these are the kind of qual
ity opponents that we want to beat.
"[We're] very confident that we can compete
with the best teams and be successful."
NOTES: Though Stanford classes haven't begun,
Santa Clara brought a large student section to
Maloney Field... Though Stanford could not cap
italize, the Cardinal leads its opponents 6-5 in cor
ner kicks so far... The "Top Corner Club," like
the Red Zone and Sixth Man, will begin this year.
A $10 membership will get students into all home
games and pre-game BBQs. Prizes will be award
ed to those with the best attendance.
