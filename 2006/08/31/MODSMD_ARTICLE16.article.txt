# Moving on from Montgomery

Tuesday morning, the Golden Stale
Warriors announced their plan to buy out the
last two years of coach Mike Montgomery's
contract. Now, the clamoring for the return of
the man who led the Stanford Cardinal to 16
postseason appearances in his 18 years on The
Farm will surely begin. The truth is Stanford
fans clinging to the glory years under
Montgomery just need to move on.
It's not that Montgomery isn't a good
coach. Regardless of his recent failings, I still
think the man can coach basketball. But

Cardinal fans calling for Montgomery's re-hir
ing are simply living in the past.
Montgomery had a great run at Stanford,
artfully recruiting talented players who fit his
system and still met strenuous academic
requirements. It's no wonder he became a
West Coast coaching legend. He left a talent
ed roster behind him two seasons ago. So
when Johnson came and struggled with Rob
Little, Nick Robinson, Dan Grunfeld, Matt
Haryasz and Chris Hernandez, people imme
diately blamed the new coach. But the truth is,
those were Montgomery players, with
strengths tailored to Montgomery's scheme.
Fans knew those players had helped Stanford
win before. Their only reaction to losing was
to long for Montgomery. Now that he's avail
able, this longing will doubtless return.
Well, you know how when you break up
with your girlfriend and you see her a couple
years later, she looks good and you think you

want to get back together? No? Maybe that's
just me. The point is, over those years, you've
changed, and you and your ex wouldn't work.
That's the case with Montgomery. This
Stanford team is headed in a new direction.
He's not right for this team anymore, and
finally, Trent Johnson is.
Montgomery's teams had a distinct style.
They played a straight man-to-man defense
and a non-trapping zone, they ran a lot of
high-low sets on offense and they were pretty
un-athletic. Trent Johnson plays an intense
style of man-to-man defense with the goal of
forcing turnovers. He spreads the floor with a
relatively unstructured offense that lets his
players take advantage of mismatches created
by their athleticism, and focuses less on using
screens to free up three-point shooters.
There are many explanations for why last
year's seniors didn't meet expectations, but
the Grunfelds, Haryaszs and Hernandezes of

the world just aren't the players for Johnson's
style. It may have taken a while to put his fin
gerprints on the team, but now he has a core
group of players to build around. Players like
Mitch Johnson, Anthony Goods, Lawrence
Hill, Landry Fields, Da-Veed Dildy, Will Paul
and Brook and Robin Lopez fit the Johnson
mold and have a chance to thrive. (Not to
mention the excellent recruiting class coming
in for 2007-2008) It may not be this year - a few
Montgomery-recruited holdovers like Peter
Prowitt and Taj Finger will still steal game
time, and the team is still very young - but
Johnson has the team built to succeed in his
way for the future.
So for frustrated Stanford fans who look
longingly to days when Stanford was a power
house under Montgomery, remember - this is
a new era. Yes, Montgomery might be avail
able, and yes, he is a good coach. But he's not
the man for this team. That ship has sailed.
