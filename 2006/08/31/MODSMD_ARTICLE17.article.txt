## Researchers question new, "safer" technique Touted to not destroy embryos and touted as a step forward 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford experts, responding to a
newly published method of generat
ing embryonic stem cells that does
not destroy embryos, expressed
doubts about whether the technique
will be able to placate opponents to
stem-cell research. They also empha
sized that it is too soon to gauge the
method's impact on the field.
The new method was published
by Advanced Cell Technology
(ACT), a biotechnology company
based in Alameda, Calif., in the
Aug. 24 issue of the journal Nature.
"From the ethical perspective,
the thing that gets everyone excited
is the fact that ACT claims that the
method could take embryonic stem
cells without harming embryos,"
said Christopher Scott, executive
director of Stanford's Program on
Stem Cells in Society.
The technique extracts a cell

from an embryo in a very early
stage, developing it into a stem-cell
line while preserving the embryo's
potential for development.
"I don't think the announcement
in Nature is groundbreaking," Scott
said. "I do think it moves stem-cell
research a step forward."
They apply a technique perfected
in animals to a human cell system, "a
pretty significant result."
"If those cells are like embryonic
stem cells, then they may be as power
ful or as useful as embryonic stem
cells," he said.
Prof. Hank Greely, director of
Stanford's Center for Law and the
Biosciences and chair of the Stanford
Center for Biomedical Ethics' steer
ing committee, agreed that the tech
nique was a step forward.
"It is always a good thing to get
more ways to accomplish something,
and this seems inherently plausible
as a way of making embryonic stem
cells, more so than some of the other
methods," he said.
"If it works, it gives us another set
of possibilities, both scientific and
ethical," Greely added. However, he
emphasized that ACT's results are
not to be trusted until they can be
reliably replicated.
Dr. Michael Clarke, associate director of the
Stanford Institute for Stem Cells and
Regenerative Medicine, said he was unsure
whether ACT's process would become more
widely used in the future, even if replicated suc
cessfully. "It depends on how efficient it is com
pared to other techniques," Clarke said.
"If you look closely at the data, the actual result
doesn't prove that embryos survive the proce
dure," Scott said. "In fact, they actually destroy the
embryos to get to the blastomeres."
"How robust is the technique?" Clarke asked.
"Can it be used to dvelop a diverse pool of
embryonic stem cells? Finally, will it be useful
for establishment of embryonic stem cell lines
from embryos that have serious genetic
defects?"
Outside the scientific, unanswered questions
have arisen in the ethical realm as well.
Scott said that he did not think ACT's new
