## THE 						BAND D.A. could prosecute students University hands over criminal complaint on Shak vandalism to D.A. 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University has turned over the results
of its criminal investigation into the alleged
vandalism of the Band Shak to the county
District Attorney's office, The Weekly has
learned.
Although the matter is still undergoing a
criminal investigation, the University placed
the band on suspension pending the outcome
of its own investigation because it is believed
that several members of the Stanford Band
were involved with the incident.
The Band Shak at Serra Street and
Arguello Way was vandalized, mid-July, with
between $30,000 and $50,000 in damages. The
Band recently finished moving from the old
shak to a newer one paid for with alumni sup
port.
University Police Department Officer
Kenneth Bates informed The Weekly that the
criminal investigation has been completed.
Jay BoyarSky, supervising deputy district
attorney for the Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office in Palo Alto, confirmed
that his office received a police report last
week from the Stanford Department of
Public Safety concerning the Band Shak van
dalism. His office will review the case and
decide what, if any, charges should be filed
against the identified suspects. He would not
offer an estimate of how long this process
might take.
Associate Director of University
Communications Kate Chesley said that The
University investigation of possible violations
of the Fundamental Standard and other
University policies is ongoing. She was unable
to estimate how long the investigation will
take.
