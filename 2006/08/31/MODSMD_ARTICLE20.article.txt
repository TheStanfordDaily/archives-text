## A Letter from the Entertainment Editor The end of an era. As Entertainment reverts back to Intermission, say goodbye to a legend and a god amongst mortals PALO ALTO YOUNG FILMMAKERS ARE CLOSER THAN YOU THINK...
### CHRISTOPHER PEDREGAL ENTERTAINMENT INDIE SCOUT 
There really might be some
thing about the bay area that
breeds entrepreneurship.
While their counterparts are off
starting internet companies or non
profits, three Palo Alto natives —
Brad Leong, Tony Vallone. and
Daniel Engelhardt—took the
startup mentality to a different
industry: film.
This summer, the city of Palo
Alto served as the stage and play
ground for their indie film titled
"Palo Alto." The film was based
out of a house on Cowper street
which they rented for the summer.
The project started two years ago
when the trio, then freshmen at
USC and UCLA, decided to make
a feature length film. Armed with
only a script and raw energy, they
started on the long road of prepar
ing to make a movie. Last week
they hit a big milestone — they
finally finished principal shooting
on the film.
Aptly named, the film takes
place entirely in Palo Alto. A com
ing of age story, the movie follows
4 college freshmen who come back
home for thanksgiving break and
realize how much they have
changed. "This is a group of young
people making a story about young
people" said Daniel Engelhardt.
the producer of the film.

This is the end. For the second time in recent
months, I've had to say goodbye to our loyal read
ership and this time it may be for good. The
Entertainment page has proven herself to be a
loyal mistress and my only hope in parting is that
she has been just as gracious to the readers as she
has been to the writers and editor.

"Everyone might not know Palo
Alto, but they know what it's like
to grow up in a place like Palo
Alto",
The filmmakers admit the
movie might be semi-autobio
graphical. "We wanted to define
our experience and the experiences
of people our age" said
Engelhardt. The three filmmakers
grew up in Palo Alto and Menlo
Park and have been collaborating
on films since high school. Vallone
and Leong first came up with the
story for "Palo Alto" during their
freshman year at UCLA and (JSC.
They spent the next 14 months
polishing the script. Engelhardt
came on board as a producer and
was in charge of writing a business
plan, courting talent, and securing
sponsorships. Engelhardt started
by approaching large film equip
ment corporations asking for spon
sorship. Companies like Panavision
and Kodak have special film stu
dent grants and helped provide
equipment for shooting the film.
The next step was raising capital
and finding actors. Through friends
and family contacts, the filmmak
ers were able to get the word out
about the film and raised money
from individual investors.
According to Engelhardt. peo
ple got excited about the script and
it traveled quickly within film cir
cles. This eventually led to well
known actors Ben Savage and Tom

But to leave on a sappy note would be unchar
acteristic of the smarminess we pride ourselves
on. So enough of that. Let's look forward to the
future of Intermission and its inevitable usurpa
tion of the totalitarian dictatorship of the Editor
in Chief. Keep your specs peeled for some pre
emptive strikes on the reign of the editorial staff.

Arnold coming on board.
The budget for the film was
under $200,000 — which in
Hollywood terms is peanuts. The
filmmakers quickly learned the
essence of bootstrapping; Brad
Leong, the director, built a camera
crane himself rather than rent a
professional one to save cash.
"We were sleeping between 4-5
hours a night. It's been a mad rush
for the past 8 weeks. Even on our
off days, we had a ton of stuff to
do" said Leong.
Tony Vallone, who wrote the
screenplay and associate produced
the film, said making the movie was
intense. "I served as a bridge
between Brad, the director and the
creative vision for the project, and
Engelhardt, the producer and real
istic end".
"It was a constant fight between
the value of the movie and the bud
get" said Leon. "1 learned a whole
lot. There's no better way 1 could
have spent 'my summer". "Palo
Alto" is a truly independent film
because it mixes both homegrown
and professional approaches to
filmmaking. The film was shot on
high-end Panavision cameras and
16mm film, but the average age of
the crew was a measly 23.
The actors turned out to be the
oldest people on set, which at first
intimidated Director Leong. As the
shooting started, however. Leong
felt more comfortable directing the

And finally, I'd like to let you guys in on a
glimpse of the future. After spending a few days on
set with the cast and crew of "Palo Alto," I can
truly say that they've got some indie gold on their
hands. As I say "shaloni" to everyone, I want to
send a note of thanks for those fine folks on that
crew, but also to the crew at the Weekly. Victor out.

more experienced actors. "They
made it pretty easy. No one had
any problems taking directions"
said Leong. "The great thing is that
it's a give-and-take. These actors
have ideas on how these character
should play out, and the perspec
tive they bring to the film is just as
important as what I bring".
Ben Savage, a 2004 Stanford grad,
plays one of the four main charac
ters and was drawn to the project
because it hit so close to home.
"The title definitely peaked my
interested. I wish I was still at
Stanford; it was the most fun time
of my life. Working on this film was
really a trip down memory lane for
me" said Savage,
"1 read the script and thought it
was really, really interesting" said
Savage. "What appealed to me was
that it's not what you would expect.
1 thought it was going to be like
"Can't Hardly Wait," but it's really
more something like "American
Graffiti."
The whole film takes place at
night so we could only shoot at
night. This means I had the days to
myself. I would go to the
Treehouse for lunch or hangout in
downtown PA" said Savage. "1 was
at Miyake's the other day and it
made me remember the Sake
bombs from college".
