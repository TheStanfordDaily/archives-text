# INTERVIEW & REVIEW
## Vida Guerra rides the seas in 'Dorm Daze 2' 
### LOREN NEWMAN ENTERTAINMENT GUERRA-RARARA LOREN NEWMAN ENTERTAINMENT DAZER 
Intermission sat down with Vida
Guerra last Wednesday, Well, at least
intermission ivav sitting, but we were
too busy awkwardly stuttering to ask
Ms. Guerra if she was sitting as well -
or what she was wearing for that mat
ter. Oh, and it was over the phone.
Bwnnier.
ENTERTAINMENT: How are you
doing today, Vida?
Vida Guerra: I'm doing great, thank
you.
ENT: After being named FHM's
"Rear of the Year" and having a
Playboy cover spread, why did you
choose to do Dorm Daze 2? Why
that movie?
VG: Well, they called me into audi
tions for the movie last year. When I
auditioned, I thought it was, you
know, funny and one of those college
movies. All the National Lampoons
movies are kinda funny and I got to
play a conservative virgin, which
people— when people think I'm
going to be in a movie, they think I'm
going to be this sexy girl. This is
kinda different, to take away from
the stereotypical ideas or comments
that models get.
ENT: Did you have any college expe
riences you could draw from for the
film?
VG: I did a semester in college, but it
wasn't in a dorm. But neither is this
movie; this movie is a semester at
sea.
ENT: You were born in Cuba, right?
VG: Yes.

ENT: What do you think about
Castro?
VG: Um, I think it's about time for
Cuba to become free. He's killed a
lot of Cubans. The way that they live
is really, really bad. They live really
poorly. Its crazy, you know? I'm a
Christian and you never want to; wish
anybody's death to come, but in this
thing...yeah.
ENT: I understand. So you recently
joined a list of the most searched
female celebrities on the internet
What do you think makes you so
appealing to web surfers? |
VG: I don't know. I have no idea. I
guess...my body, looks? (Note:
Absolutely no sarcasm detected)
ENT: Anything in particular?
VG: I mean, they like ray butt.
ENT: Alright! Tell me about the
movie you're filming this summer.
VG: You mean The Rhythm?
ENT: Yeah.
VG: It's a dance movie. I play a
famous singer and she falls for a guy
who likes her for her because he
doesn't know she's famous. There's a
dance competition, you know.
ENT: Also you have a new CD com
ing out in March.
VG: It's hip hop, R&B music with
some Spanish influence. I'm singing
— and I don't want to call it rap
ping— but like, flowing...
ENT: Cool.
VG: Sexy flowing.
ENT: (Snickers) As the first Latina
woman on the cover of playboy,
what does that mean to you?
VG: Um, I'm not the first one.
I'm actually the seventh Latina
girl on the cover.
ENT: Oh.
VG: It's been around for 53 years,
that's a lot of issues with only seven
[Latinas] on the cover. It should be
more.
ENT: Definitely. Rumor has it that
you're single. Is that correct?

VG: Yes.
ENT: Do you have any tips for
admirers who are obsessed with
the Vida Guerra celebrity?
VG: As far as getting to know
me?
ENT: Yeah.
VG: I'm just a regular girl, very
down to earth and I'm busy
working now so it's kinda hard
for people to get to know me.
But I mean, treat me like I'm a
regular girL

"Dorm Daze Two: College @ Sea" is billed as "an
adventure on the 'high' seas." If people who thought
putting "high" in parentheses was funny were allowed
to write a movie, this is the comedy they would write.
Think of it as a standard "Saved By the Bell episode,
only 100 minutes long with nudity, drugs, profanity,
and Playboy cover girl Vida Guerra. It's the second
installment of the reasonably popular Dorm Daze
DVD franchise, only instead of in a dorm, this time the
coeds frolic around a cruise ship during a semester at
sea. Produced by Lions Gate Entertainment — a com
pany renowned for lame horror movie knockoffs —
the movie is an exercise in pitching low budget, formu
laic comedy at a specified, perceivably horny audience
of 18-25 year-old males. Conveniently all the bad guys
are fat and old, while all the protagonists are ripped
and/or (mostly or) buxom.
The comedic high water mark is set in the first 20
minutes when three students perform a "post modern"
play called Womanizing Objects. "Hello man, I am a
vagina. These are my breasts, these are my bosoms,
those are her cans. Bouncy, bouncy!" All the while,
everyone in the audience is just there for the tits. Huh.

Go figure. More
entertaining bits
of the movie
come from the
cyclic drama
constructed
around a giddy
desire for
money that is
shared by virtu
ally all the
characters.
Somehow a
honking dia
mond shows up
on board, only
to be confused
with the dia
mond in a stu
dent play. A
monkey named
ChooChoo, who
was supposed to
be ground up
into drugs is run
ning around,
switching every
one's guns, poi-

sons, and potent hallucinogens. Then someone actually
dies, but no one really seems to care. He was an asshole
anyways.
The cast is very hit or miss, but contains some famil
iar faces. Vida Guerra plays Violet, the über-hot leader
of the College Ladies Against Penis or CLAP. While
Guerra is certainly drool-inducing, her acting is wood
en — no wonder her dialogue is kept to a minimum.
Danielle Fishel, better known as Topanga from "Boy
Meets World," is the rather stout, "cock blocking fas
cist" slut. The rest of the cast is culled from various
day-time TV shows and B-movies.
In a movie that was very obviously given a license to
do whatever it wanted, the writers did a very half-assed
job. A straight to DVD feature aimed directly at col
lege guys has the opportunity to get its hands on some
of the quirky, unique, and even totally gross humor
that makes college so entertaining. Aside from one
"Dirty Sanchez" reference and some iffy stoner jokes
("to the Bong, Batman"), the humor is unremarkable,
almost obviously written by someone out of college for
a while. There are some scattered virtues, but the
movie is otherwise best described as cringe-worthy.
The dialogue is canned, the soundtrack is full of Van
Halen wannabes crooning songs with titles like
"Higher Sexication", and there's a lot of man-ass
shown.
At its best, it plays like a modern, sexier version of
Moli6re, but as its worst comes out like a thousand
anonymous cliche TV shows that never made it
through their first season. When accepted on its own
terms, DD2 is not a bad movie. Then again, that's
probably too much to ask most people.

LIFESAVER: The movie is
mediocre, but Guerra's got some
considerable assets.
