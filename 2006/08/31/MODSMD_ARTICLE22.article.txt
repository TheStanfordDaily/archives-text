You know what I hate? Gypsies. Gypsies from
Bulgaria and Germany (even J.K Rowling hates
on some Bulgarians, as evidenced in the fourth
Harry Potter book, where the headmaster of the
Bulgarian academy of magic is totally described as
"swarthy" and "corrupt.") who swindle your
friends out of 50 Euros by pushing them towards
the world's oldest con-game.
No, it wasn't prostitution, it was the "three
balls" game where you guess where it goes, but it's
not the fools who guess right or wrong that pro
vide cashflow — it's the poor dude standing on
the side who gets pushed by the grifter's accom
plice, who pretends to be just another guy in the
crowd. The accomplice shoves your foot onto one
of the inverted cups (usually when someone's
about to guess that the ball is under it, and it is)
and forces you to pull out your wallet before you
know what's even happening. The grafter promis
es you you'll get your money back, It's all part of
the game THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO PLAY, and then the accomplice hustles you
away from the game ASAP, walks you away real
quick so you can't make a scene and you are like
"what the eff? Did you just fuck me in the ass?"
and he won't tell you where you're going and your
girlfriend totally is freaking out because she's
from LA and this shit happens all the time, but in
Spain there are NO COPS and no one is listening
to her because these hustlers are foreign, speak
broken Castilian Spanish, and look like they have
knives or guns.
The po-po's are definitely not around in Las
Ramblas when you need them, because Las
Ramblas is Spain's Compton or Lynwood at night.
Dude. Don't get shot while drinking your OJ in
the hood, and don't get effed out of your money
by gypsies who look like the poor man's Italian
mafiosos. Especially Bulgarian ones with laceless
sneakers and greasy hair slicked back in ponytails.
They're slippery bitches who look like they'd gut
you in a second, only they're too broke to afford a
real weapon. Maybe they'd stab you with a rusty
butter knife they stole from the armless and leg
less panhandler in front of the Pans & Company
sandwich shop. I swear I'm not racist, I love my
Bulgarian and German friends and everything,
but I fucking hate gypsies in Las Ramblas.


CURIOUS GEORGE: Follow the man in the yel
low hat — because he stole your wallet, chump.
