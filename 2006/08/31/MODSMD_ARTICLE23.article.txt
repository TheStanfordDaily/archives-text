## The

### RYAN LAMPE ENTERTAINMENT BOOKEND 
Each week, one of my favorite websites
holds an online poll asking visitors to make
predictions about the next weekend's box
office. With the holiday season winding down,
this week's poll was more retrospective, ask
ing visitors to vote for their favorite movie of
the summer. I knew this was a disappointing
holiday season for Hollywood blockbusters.
But it wasn't until I looked at the list of choic
es that I realized just how disappointing it was.
The choices were as follows: "Pirates of the
Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," "Superman
Returns," "Clerks 2," "X-Men: The Last
Stand," "Snakes on a Plane," "Talladega
Nights," "Cars" and"The Da Vinci Code." A
pretty mediocre list. (And personally pretty
offensive since I thought "Mission: Impossible
III" was one of the best Hollywood block
busters this summer and it didn't even rate a
mention!)
Apart from "Pirates 2" and "Clerks 2,"
there's nothing terribly memorable there.
"Snakes on a Plane" was a guilty pleasure but
nothing more. "X-Men: The Last Stand,"
though not the tragedy many expected, was a
significant step down from "X 2." And Ron
Howard's adaptation of "The Da Vinci Code"
managed to demonstrate that even the most
entertaining book can be dull as shit on screen.
Two questions come to mind. First, was
2006 merely an aberration? Second, are
things likely to get better?
With regard to the first question, the
answer is sadly no. Last year was actually a lot
worse! Though it might be tempting to
remember 2005 as the year "Batman Begins"
and "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the

Sith" were released, it was also the year that
four new definitions of stupid were added to
the dictionary. That's right. "Fantastic
Four," "The Island," "XXX: State of the
Union" and "Stealth" were all released last
summer!
Will things change? Probably not. Next
summer is already shaping up to be the most
sequel crazy holiday season of all time. Peter
Parker, Harry Potter, Jason Bourne, Captain

Jack and even John McClane ("Die Hard 4")
will all be returning in new installments of their
very lucrative (and very reliable) franchises.
Furthermore, nearly all of the movies on
the above web poll have made (or will make)
over $150 million domestically. "Snakes on a
Plane" and "Clerks" are the obvious excep
tions. So it's likely to be business as usual in
Hollywood. Still, it's encouraging that a few
big budget, seemingly brainless movies have

performed poorly in the past few months.
"Poseidon" had a production budget of $160
million but only made $60 million domestical
ly. And the breakdown isn't much better for
"Miami Vice," Michael Mann's self-conscious
experiment in stylish boredom.
Of course, try as it might, Hollywood can't
prevent the occasional gem from being
released in the summer months. There are a
few choices this season, but I think "Little Miss
Sunshine" deserves to be singled out. If you
haven't seen it yet, put it on top of your list.
Alternately joyous and heart-breaking, "Little
Miss Sunshine" creates a world of its own and
fills it with truly fascinating characters.
It's too early to compile a best of 2006 list
(I still have high hopes for "The Departed,"
Scorsese's remake of the brilliant Hong Kong
thriller "Infernal Affairs"), but I suspect
"Sunshine" will be near the top. Probably
one step below "The Santa Clause 3: The
Escape Clause." Tim Allen as Santa Clause
facing off against Martin Short's Jack Frost.
Could there be a more exciting movie
premise?
Oh, in case you're wondering about that
web poll, "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead
Man's Chest" was the most popular movie,
garnering 25% of the vote. "Superman
Returns" came in second with about 24%.
The latter result really surprises me.
"Superman Returns" has one of the dullest
scripts ever conceived. The kind of script that
climaxes with Superman lifting a large chunk
of rock out of the ocean. Yeah, that's right.
That's the film's action climax - Superman
heaving a rock into space. Are you flipping
kidding me? How can people vote for this
dreck? Oh that's right. What choice did they
have?

UP, UP AND AWAY? Summer 2006 left us with a feeling of "been there, done that." Even
the new Superman movie was a retread of the 1978 classic â€”right down to the codpiece.
