# HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES
## Top 5 Shockers of Summer

ENTERTAINMENT SHOCK MASTER
1. Mel Gibson goes bonkers— ah, good
ole Mel. Who would have known that
the acclaimed director of "Braveheart"
would be such an avid anti-Semite?
(Hint: See "The Passion of the Christ").
After an embarrassing arrest for DUI
charges in mid-August, Gibson went on
a tirade spouting the evils of Judaism,
which he claimed was "blurted out in a
moment of insanity." If by "moment,"
you mean "decades," then yeah, I'll
believe you. A piece of advice Mr.
Gibson — something tells me that
Hollywood is probably not the best
place for hating Jews.
2. Spiderman unmasked — comic
book nerds let out a collective gasp of
horror as Marvel comics did the
unthinkable: revealed Spiderman's
secret identity to the public. In what
could only be described as the smartest
marketing ploy ever, every enemy,
friend and shmoe on the street knows
that Peter Parker is your friendly neigh
borhood Spiderman — and Marvel's
sales execs couldn't be happier. And
while Marvel might be happy with the
extra dough from the Civil War story
line they've been putting out, you have
to ask yourself, "What on earth were
they thinking?"

3. Rattlers freed in "Snakes on Plane"
theater prank — (drunken college
aged) hooligans in Phoenix, Arizona
released a pair of diamondback rattler
snakes in a crowded theater during the
release of Samuel L. Jackson's magnum
opus "Snakes on Plane." Authorities
captured the dangerous reptiles but not
before Jackson could say, "I've had it
with these motherf**cking snakes in
this motherf**cking AMC!" He then
proceeded to shoot out a window and
land the theater safely.
4.Paris Hilton announces her
celibacy — forget WMDs, this story is
the biggest load of bull of the 21st cen
tury. Hilton saying that she won't have
sex until marriage is like saying fish
don't need water to survive. By the
time you finish reading this sentence,
this vow will have been broken faster
than you can say "skanktastic."
5. Pluto no longer considered
planet — the ninth and final planet
was demoted to dwarf planet recently.
Childhoods all over the country are
irrevocably destroyed as months of
school-learnin' are swept away with no
regard to tradition. Those scientists
think they can do anything with their
"facts." No reaction yet from Paris
Hilton, who thought that Pluto was just
that orange dog from Disney.
