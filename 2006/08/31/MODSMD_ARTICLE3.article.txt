# LABOR ISSUES
## As contract expires, a rally 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES NEWS EDITOR 
Facing the expiration of their current contract
today, workers with the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) Local 715 are resum
ing negotiations with the University in hopes of
immediate resolution.
The talks continue two months of discussion this
summer, and follow a workers rally and march yes
terday at 4 p.m. in the Quad. Supporters, including
students, community members and other labor
forces came out against the cutting of benefits and
the University's "hostile attitude" toward the
union.
United Stanford Workers President Zev
Kvitky, a leader at the rally, roughly estimated 400
attendees and called the event "very successful."
"I think people were very clear in expressing
their dissatisfaction, their anger at the negotiations
right now, and also their desire to have a fair con
tract by tomorrow," Kvitky said. "One of the very
clear messages sent today was that people are
proud to work at Stanford, but people expect
Stanford to put their promises in writing. If it's
proud of the benefits that it offers, it needs to put
them in writing and on contract, and people are
willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that."
The contract negotiations and workers march
follow negotiations this past February when the
same contract was under review. Under threat of
strike, an agreement was reached regarding pen
sion plans, with the University conceding to chang
ing the base earnings year (from 1992 to 1994) for

its Stanford Retirement Annuity Plan (SRAP),
thereby increasing the benefit.
The University had proposed implementing its
Stanford Contributory Retirement Plan (SCRP)
for new employees, which would create a "two
tiered" system. The decision not to do so pleased
union workers, with 93 percent of voting members
supporting it.
Other controversial areas of the contract,
though, ended up being left for later discussion in
the summer.
"The problems are largely the same," Kvitky
said. "They are over significant cuts implemented
for retiree health care. Although Stanford is so
willing to provide family health care, they've
announced it at a level that we believe will not pro
vide assistance to most of the people who need it."
Even after two months, Kvitky said the
University and union are still "very far apart on the
issues most important to our members."
With the contract expiration looming, though,
negotiations have stepped up, and in a statement to
The Stanford Weekly, the University said it "is
continuing to negotiate in good faith with the
union, with the goal of reaching a new contract
before expiration of the current contract."
In negotiations Tuesday, according to a state
ment yesterday by Diane Peck, executive director
of Human Resources for the University, tentative
agreements were already reached regarding "the
definition of 'close family member'" as well as
"updating Side Letter 14 in light of the University's

fulfillment of its commitment to create 40 new posi
tions in Dining Services."
"The Union and University discussed and
exchanged further proposals in a number of areas,
including shift limits in Dining Services, changes in reg
ular schedules, recognition of progressive discipline
and classification of workers in miscellaneous job clas
sifications," Peck added.
Although Kvitky agrees discussions are progress
ing, he said "we're making progress on issues that are
generally non-economic and are important for us to
resolve, but are certainly not the most important
issues." Wages and benefits, which "are a critical con
cern at the moment" still leave both parties "very far
apart."
The University made its first wages and benefits
proposal this past Sunday, and"the delaying in getting
to this point has been very frustrating both for the
negotiating team and our membership," Kvitky said.
The union responded Tuesday to the first econom
ic proposal, which holds to the University's starting
position, according to Peck's statement. Little move
ment was made following that though.
As for where negotiations will head today, Kvitky
said it "will largely depend on what management
comes to the table with." And as for resolution by
tonight, "it's always possible to reach an agreement, as
long as negotiations continue."
"We sent a very clear message to management,"
Kvitky said.
If an agreement is not reached and the contract
expires, workers will likely work for the time being. A
work stoppage similar to the one last year by workers
could ensue if union leaders feel like they need to flex
their muscles to make progress at the bargaining table.
