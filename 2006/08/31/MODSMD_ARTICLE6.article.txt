## UPDATE: Governor passes college press bill 
### 
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed off
Monday on Assembly Bill 2581, guaranteeing student
press freedom at public colleges and universities. The
new bill guards against censorship but still leaves stu
dent reporters and editors liable for damaging mate
rial considered slanderous or libelous.
As The Stanford Weekly reported Aug. 24, the
"Hosty bill" was in response to the 2005 Hosty vs.
Carter decision by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals. The Court held that censorship rights of
high-school officials could apply to public colleges in
Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin.
After the Supreme Court declined to hear a Hosty
case appeal, the California Assembly responded in
May by unanimously passing the free student press
legislation, approved by the State Senate on a 31-2
vote on Aug. 10.

Etchemendy: 4-1 gamble for Harvard
president
Provost John Etchemendy has 4-1 odds for being
named Harvard University's next president, accord
ing to gambling Web site bodog.com. Etchemendy
has the third-best chance in the online pool, behind
Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan (3-1 odds)
and Harvard Provost Steven E. Hyman (7-2 odds).
Three percent of wagers on Bodog.com have bet
on Etchemendy to assume the presidency, far behind
Kagan's 20 percent. The search for a new president
began after Lawrence H. Summers stepped down,
Feb. 21, amid controversy surrounding what some
considered gender-biased remarks.
A new Harvard president is not expected to be
announced until early 2007.
Etchemendy took the news in stride, telling The
Boston Globe that it was "a kick."
"Maybe this is my chance to win some money with
insider knowledge," he wrote. "Do you think the
NCAA would frown on that?"
