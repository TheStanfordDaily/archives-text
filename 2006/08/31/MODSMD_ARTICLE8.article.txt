### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a year-long search, Dr. Ralph
Horwitz, dean and vice president for med
ical affairs of Case Western Reserve
University School of Medicine, has been
named chairman of the department of
medicine for the School of Medicine. He
will assume the position Dec. I, leading
the School of Medicine's largest depart
ment with approximately 150 faculty
members in 14 divisions and programs.
Beginning March 2005, a search com
mittee co-chaired by Dr. Harvey Cohen,
chair of the department of pediatrics, and
Dr. Gary Glazer, chair of the department
of radiology, reviewed 125 potential can
didates; eleven finalists were invited for
two-day visits and interviews. In March

2006, Pizzo was presented with a list of
four unranked finalists.
"1 carefully evaluated each of the final
ists, discussed their candidacy with lead
ers around the country, visited the home
programs of selected individuals and
determined that Dr. Horwitz was the best
person at this time for Stanford," Pizzo
said.
In a joint statement, Cohen and Glazer
stated: "Dr. Horwitz is a highly articulate
clinician and investigator with a keen
grasp of academic issues. We were
impressed with his superb leadership
skills and his dedication to the discipline
of internal medicine as a foundation of
the medical school."
"Stanford Medical School and
Stanford Hospital have provided me with
an enormous opportunity to strengthen
an already great department by enhancing
its nationally prominent programs of
research, education and clinical care,"
Horwitz said. "In expanding the faculty,
we will have the chance to maintain our

laboratory-based research programs while
developing a greater emphasis on the dis
ease-oriented and patient-oriented sci
ence that translates new discoveries into
clinical benefits."
Horwitz also expressed his excitement
about Stanford Hospital's commitment to
creating and expanding its clinical pro
grams.
"It is a strength of Stanford that the
medical school and the hospital are so
aligned in their common pursuit of clinical
and academic leadership," he said.
During his tenure as chairman,
Horwitz hopes to "create a department of
medicine that is greater than the sum of
its individual parts."
"Our department must work together
on those common responsibilities that
unite us as a faculty â€” educating our stu
dents, residents and fellows; creating
interdisciplinary programs of research
that make us leaders in the clinical and
