## Horwitz eager to expand department Outsider brought in for key Med School post 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a year-long search, Dr. Ralph
Horwitz, dean and vice president for med
ical affairs of Case Western Reserve
University School of Medicine, has been
named chairman of the department of
medicine for the School of Medicine. He
will assume the position Dec. I, leading
the School of Medicine's largest depart
ment with approximately 150 faculty
members in 14 divisions and programs.
Beginning March 2005, a search com
mittee co-chaired by Dr. Harvey Cohen,
chair of the department of pediatrics, and
Dr. Gary Glazer, chair of the department
of radiology, reviewed 125 potential can
didates; eleven finalists were invited for
two-day visits and interviews. In March

2006, Pizzo was presented with a list of
four unranked finalists.
"1 carefully evaluated each of the final
ists, discussed their candidacy with lead
ers around the country, visited the home
programs of selected individuals and
determined that Dr. Horwitz was the best
person at this time for Stanford," Pizzo
said.
In a joint statement, Cohen and Glazer
stated: "Dr. Horwitz is a highly articulate
clinician and investigator with a keen
grasp of academic issues. We were
impressed with his superb leadership
skills and his dedication to the discipline
of internal medicine as a foundation of
the medical school."
"Stanford Medical School and
Stanford Hospital have provided me with
an enormous opportunity to strengthen
an already great department by enhancing
its nationally prominent programs of
research, education and clinical care,"
Horwitz said. "In expanding the faculty,
we will have the chance to maintain our

laboratory-based research programs while
developing a greater emphasis on the dis
ease-oriented and patient-oriented sci
ence that translates new discoveries into
clinical benefits."
Horwitz also expressed his excitement
about Stanford Hospital's commitment to
creating and expanding its clinical pro
grams.
"It is a strength of Stanford that the
medical school and the hospital are so
aligned in their common pursuit of clinical
and academic leadership," he said.
During his tenure as chairman,
Horwitz hopes to "create a department of
medicine that is greater than the sum of
its individual parts."
"Our department must work together
on those common responsibilities that
unite us as a faculty â€” educating our stu
dents, residents and fellows; creating
interdisciplinary programs of research
that make us leaders in the clinical and
translational sciences; and celebrat
ing the practice of medicine,"
Horwitz said. "Stanford has many
great physicians. I hope to attract
and nurture the careers of more
such individuals and to recognize
their achievements and contribu
tions to Stanford medicine."
Prior to working at Case,
Horwitz served as the co-director of
the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical
Scholars Program, Harold H. Hines
Jr. Professor of Medicine and
Epidemiology and chair of the

department of internal medicine at
Yale. He is a member of the
Institute of Medicine of the
National Academy of Science and
was recently selected as an advisory
committee member for the director
of the National Institutes of Health.
In 2005, Horwitz was recognized for
his exemplary contributions to med
ical research and education when he
was honored with the Society of
General Internal Medicine's Robert
J. Glaser Research Award.
"It is great for Stanford to have
recruited such a talented chair,"
said Dr. Harry Greenberg, who has
served as the interim co-chairman
of the department of medicine
along with Dr. Norm Rizk.
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the
Stanford School of Medicine, is

similarly pleased by the appoint
ment of Dr. Horwitz.
"Dr. Horwitz is passionate about
medical education, research and
patient care and how leadership in
each of these areas will help serve
our communities locally and global
ly and better secure the public trust
in the future of medicine," Pizzo
said. "He will focus his energies on
the recruitment of physician-scien
tists and clinician-educators. He
will work diligently to enhance the
education and training environ
ment for students, residents and fel
lows. And he will work collabora
tively with his colleagues in the
medical school, University and at
Stanford Hospital and Clinics to
help make Stanford medicine the
best it can be for the 21st century."
