The Program in Ethic in Society
I lie Program in Ethics in Society is an interdisciplinary honors program guided by the
idea that ethical thought has application to current social questions and conflicts. Hie
program is grounded in moral and political philosophy, but it extends its concerns across a
broad range ot traditional disciplinary domains, such as international relations, politics,
science, medicine, law and business.
Ethics in Society brings together scholars and students to discuss the political and moral
challenges in our collective life. We hope that such reflection can improve society:
through raising the quality of our deliberation, in bringing research to bear on important
problems, and by preparing our students to live lives committed to the values of personal
integrity and social justice.
Recent senior thesis topics include:
— Hie Ethics and Economics of Kidney Markets
-- Hie Moral & Legal Status of Children in Medical Decision-Making
-- Private Donations to Public Schools: An Egalitarian Analysis
— Ethics ol a Skilled Based Immigration Policy for the United States
We also oiler an HIS minor; within the minor, you can pursue a Citizenship track, which
allows you to explore what it means to be a responsible citizen in a democracy.
