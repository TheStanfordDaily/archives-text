## Construction afflicts Farm with early morning noise Stadium work delays $100 million Manger Housing Project until 2007 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO DESK EDITOR 
For freshmen experiencing Stan
ford's campus for the first time, the
ongoing construction may come as a
surprise. But even those returning
may be shocked by some of the
changes to the University, which in
clude the new Stanford Stadium and
a 60-ft deep hole where Wilbur Field
once was.
The most ambitious project under
way is the The Munger Construction
Project, which will create new gradu
ate residences where the Stern park
ing lot and Salvatierra Walk used to
stand. Five historic houses that sat on
Salvatierra were moved to different
locations on campus to make way for
the $100 million, 600-bed project.
But while the houses were moved
by the beginning of the summer, con
struction has been postponed until
2007, said Mark Bonino, project
manager for Munger Housing, and
will not begin until the contractor
team completes the work on the new
Stanford Stadium.
"We're waiting for our best con
struction team to come off the stadi
um project," he said. "With the great
job they're doing there, they deserve
a bit of a break before we get into
our preconstruction planning and
working on the bids for the Munger
project. 1 think everyone thought it
was in our best interest to spend
some more preconstruction time so
that we can get the best construction
product for the most efficient dol

lars."
The excavation of an under
ground parking lot on the site of
Wilbur Field is also nearing comple
tion. However, the construction of
the underground garage will contin
ue through 2007 with an expected
completion in January 200 S.
With construction anticipated
throughout the academic year, many
students have expressed concern
over how it will affect their lives.
"Access to the dormitories for
students returning to campus has
been considered as part of the larger
construction logistics planning for
the area," said Jack Cleary, director
of project management. "The Cam
pus Drive road construction will be
complete this week in time for stu
dents returning to Stern and Wilbur.
The contractors have been advised
that no work in this area can begin
before 8 a.m. to reduce the impact of
noise and construction activity on
the neighbors."
Nonetheless some students are
still finding the noise difficult to
cope with.
"The only thing I mind is the
noise level in the mornings," said
senior Megumi Tsutsui, a Peer
Health Educator in Rinconada, a
dormitory adjacent to the parking
lot construction. "They usually start
around 7:30 or 8. I stay up late at
night expecting to sleep in, so 1 don't
like being woken up before I have to
be."
The Barnum Family Center adja
cent to the clock tower was also com
pleted over the summer and will be
used to house programs for the
School of Education. In White Plaza,
the demolition of Old Union has fin
ished and renovation will continue
throughout the academic year.
