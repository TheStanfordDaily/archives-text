# CAMPUS LIFE
## ASSU executives share plans 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Students are just now returning to campus, hut ASSU
President Elizabeth Heng, d senior, and Vice President
Lauren Graham, a graduate student in sociology, are al
ready at work for the upcoming year. The Daily asked
them a few questions about their plans via email.
The Daily: Both of you have been involved in the
ASSU since freshman year, what have you learned from
your past years in student government?
Heng/ Graham: There is a lot of bureaucracy in any
level of politics.
The Daily: What will you do differently than past
ASSU executive committees?
Heng/ Graham: As you have seen, we have strayed
away from those key words such as "cost of living" and
"student life." Honestly, what does that mean? Instead of
running a campaign on the status quo, we have decided to
pin point key and feasible issues we want to focus on.
Time is limited and we will advocate for long-term goals
but focus on specific ones.
The Daily: What should freshmen know about the
ASSU?
Heng/ Graham: If they want to become student lead
ers at Stanford (being president of a club or of their
class), it is a great stepping-stone to honing their leader
ship skills and working with administration. In the future,
these skills give them the tools to enact change at Stan
ford.
The Daily: What do you think of some students' con
cerns that enforcing Dead Week will just make the quar
ter more rushed and stressful as professors will have one
week less to teach? Are you still attempting to make
Dead Week "dead" and if so, what exact changes are
planned?
Heng/ Graham: We are currently writing our Dead
Week Proposal and working on gathering information
from students, faculty and administration. After we finish
gathering our information, which includes launching a
survey to the undergraduate students in early fall, creat
ing a public forum to discuss the benefits and minuses of
this idea and working out the logistical feasibility with ad
ministration and faculty, we will analyze the information.
If the analysis of the feedback is beneficial to the faculty
and students, we will move forward with our plans.
The Daily: Why is the Mausoleum party one of your
main focuses seeing as no current undergraduates have
experienced it?

Heng/ Graham: There is no single student event that
captures both the graduate and undergraduate popula
tion. Here is an opportunity for the whole school to cele
brate Stanford together.
The Daily: How will you define your year as success
ful?
Heng/ Graham: We will define our success if we can
look back at the end of the year and say to ourselves, "We
have done all that we could have accomplished and there
are no regrets. We worked hard, were honest and met the
needs of the students."
The Daily: What are your opinions of the student
body's current awareness of ASSU and involvement in
the issues? How do you plan to reach the student body
and keep them informed and involved in ASSU deci
sions?
Heng/ Graham: There are a lot of changes that we will
be undergoing this year to promote ASSU. Our goal is to
be as transparent and as easily accessible as possible. To
start off, we have revamped the ASSU website and hope
fully, it is easier to navigate. Next, we have created an
ASSU Updates e-mail list that will send out e-mails to all
of the VSOs and student leaders bi-quarterly. It will in
form everyone of our progress. We will work closely with
student publications, and lastly, we have created two mar
keting positions that will heavily reach out into the stu
dent body.
The Daily: What do you think the ASSU's main weak
nesses and strengths are?
Heng/ Graham: Student government has such a quick
turn around time from year to year. You never know who
will be setting the agendas within the Association and it
leaves the Association highly volatile. However, if the As
sociation members do their research and approach the
administration with feasible ideas, ASSU becomes limit
less in its advocacy.
The Daily: Any opinions on the current band inci
dent?
Heng/ Graham: We understand the seriousness of the
damages. However, we would like the administration to
take into consideration that the Stanford Band is a trade
mark of Stanford and that as a graduating senior, the tra
ditions that the band adds to the student body are price
less.
The Daily: What is one thing all freshmen should do
their first year at Stanford?
Heng/ Graham: Go to the Mausoleum Party
(kidding...well, not really).
