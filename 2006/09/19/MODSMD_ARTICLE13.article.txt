## Stadium boosts ticket sales, morale 
### SAM BHAGWAT ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR 
An almost ten-month wait ended
on Saturday, as the new Stanford Sta
dium emerged from its cocoon, an
ugly caterpillar transformed into a
beautiful butterfly.
The final whistle had barely
sounded on the Cardinal?s season
ending 38-31 loss to Notre Dame last
fall when bulldozers began tearing
up the field. Since that moment, con
struction has proceeded at a frantic
pace, with workers toiling sixteen
hours a day,six days a week.The new
stadium has been billed as more
comfortable and intimate, with
50,000 seats, down from 85,500. With
the removal of the track and fence
surrounding the football field, fans
were also brought 70 to 100 feet clos
er to the action
There were other upgrades that
ranged from the big (three new tun
nels and a new scoreboard) to the
small (six inches of additional leg
room per seat). Notably, the student
section was also changed from bench
to chair seating.Though the seats are
more comfortable, it is harder for
large groups to sit together if they ar
rive late.
The changes cost $90 million, and
took a total of 1,209.600 man-hours.
Materials included 14.000 cubic
yards of concrete. 40,000 cubic yards
of imported earth, and 600 tons of
sand, along with 24 miles of audio/vi
sual cable and three miles of water,
sewer, and drain pipes.
If ticket sales are any indication,
fan reactions to the new stadium
have been positive.The Athletic De
partment, which sells most seats be
fore the season starts, has sold an av
erage of 41,425 tickets per game for
this season, compared to the 13,700
average last season.
?We?ve put together a campaign
to bring back the Stanford faithful as
well as a broader Bay Area base,?
said Chris Hutchins, special assistant
to the director of athletics. ?We far
exceeded our original objectives.?
Hutchins said interest from Bay
Area families far outstripped expec
tations; the Athletic Department
sold the 5,700 tickets initially avail
able under the family ticket plan,and
released 2.3(H) more, selling those as
well. ?We?re really pleased.? she
said.
Still, some students harbor reser
vations about the renovations.
?The new stadium is beautiful and
the festivities were painstakingly
choreographed, but everything felt a
little too sterile,? said junior Sean
Arenson. ?It seemed more like a pro
fessional sporting event than a col
lege football experience, and it was
simply lacking in tradition.?
Other fans at the game said they
were looking forward to coming
back.
?It has a nice future vibe,? said
sophomore Jason Feng. ?It?s going
to be fun to watch games there when
our team is good.?
