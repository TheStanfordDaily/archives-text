## Prof, wins Mac Arthur prize, $500,000 grant 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
ITiey say you can't get some
thing for nothing. Claire Tomlin
found the opposite to be true last
weekâ€”to the tune of $500,000. No
nomination. No application. No
word.
"It came out of the blue," she
said. "It was a phone call on Ilies
day that was just incredible."
It wasn't Publisher's Clearing
house. The associate professor of
aeronautics and astronautics was
selected by the Mac Arthur Foun
dation as one of its 25 fellows for
2006, an honor that comes with a
half-million dollar, no-strings-at
tached grant.
Like the other fellows. Tomlin,
who holds a joint appointment at
Stanford and the University of
California at Berkeley, had no idea
she had even been nominated.
"She is believed to be a person
of great creativity and whom we
believe knows far better than we
what to do with this money," said
Daniel Socolow. director of the
Mac Arthur Fellows Program. "It
is hers to do with as she sees fit."
Her aeronautics work has con
centrated on modernizing and im
proving the reliability of air traffic
control systems. She said that she

believed selection for the award
was based on the research she has
done at the I University over the
past several years.
"I started this research well be
fore September 11 happened." she
said,"and when it happened there
was quite a push by the Defense
Department into how we could in
corporate security or safety prop
erties in it."
Tomlin doesn't yet know what
she will do with the money, but she
has a sabbatical coming up.
"I'm thinking about possibly
taking some time to take courses
in biology and learn experimental
technique," she said. "This grant
could help fund that."
The fellowship recognizes out
standing candidates in all fields of
science and the humanities for
their "creativity, originality, and
potential to make important con
tributions in the future,"according
a statement from the John D. and
Catherine T. Mac Arthur Founda
tion. The grant comes "without
stipulations or reporting require
ments."
The Mac Arthur Fellows Pro
gram's"no strings attached" policy
regarding the grant money en
ables recipients like Tomlin great
latitude in deciding what to pur
sue.
