# Police ban bikes from Main Quad
## Ruling, parking bikes and skateboards prohibited in arcades 
### NIRAJ SHETH 
Nostalgic images of students riding their hikes be
tween the arches of the Main Quad will now find
their place alongside the Mausoleum Party and the
Stanford Indians in the Pantheon of forgotten Stan
ford traditions.
Starting this fall, Stanford police will enforce a
no-wheels policy in the Main Quad arcades, pro
hibiting students from riding or parking bicycles,
skateboards and rollerblades in the covered walk
ways.
The new rule was added by Parking and Trans
portation Services (PT&S) to the pre-existing access
policy for the Pedestrian Zone, an area that covers
most of the academic areas on campus and is marked
by gray on this year's campus maps.
"The purpose of the policy is to create a safer cen
tral campus for pedestrians and bicyclists, preserve
facilities, and minimize the disruption of University
activities through the elimination of unnecessary ve
hicular traffic," said Bill Larson, supervisor of the
Pedestrian Zone Access Project.
Police statistics show that, on average, two stu
dents were hospitalized each week for bicycle-relat
ed accidents last year, though it is unclear how many
of those occur in the Main Quad.
The new ban w ill be advertised through signs and
flyers for the first six weeks of the quarter. After that,
police w ill issue citations to students biking in the ar
cades.
The use of skateboards and rollerblades has been
illegal throughout the Pedestrian Zone for more
than 15 years, Larson said, though police have never
enforced the ban in those areas and don't plan to
start any time soon.
PT&S and the police informed resident assis
tants (RAs) of the new rule last Thursday. However,
due to a miscommunication, many RAs were led to
believe that bikes were banned throughout the
Pedestrian Zone, which would have made it illegal to
ride through White Plaza and the library quad.
RAs were also told at the Thursday meeting that
the University has added additional bike racks
throughout the Main Quad. When asked how they
expected students to bring their bikes to the racks if
they couldn't ride them there, police officers an
swered that students could dismount and walk the
bikes to the racks.
