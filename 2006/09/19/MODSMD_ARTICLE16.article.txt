## Sounding off about the Stanford Band Run with it 
### 
New Student Orientation (NSO) without Band
Run — actually, Stanford without Band Run —
would be like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with
out the peanut butter. Or worse, a Cracker Jack box
without the shiny prize. The Band Run is NSO's sav
ing grace, disrupting the litany of carefully planned
seminars and ridiculously campy festivities with its
loud tunes, crazy characters and mad dashing around
campus. It's confusing, exhilarating, breathless and
fun. While we may forget the skits and ceremonies of
NSO. the experience of Band Run will remains with
many of us forever.
This is why Stanford students and alumni spoke
out when word got out that the Band Run was going
to be canceled this year. The cancellation was part of
a series of punishments against the Band for the dam
age of the Shak (allegedly by several band members)
this summer. In reaction, band members started the
"Make Band Run Happen"petition online.garnering
about 1280 signatures at the time of publication. The

signers echoed a cycle of similar pleas and reflections.
Don't deprive the freshman class just because of
the wrongdoings of a few students. Some of us met
our best friends during band run. That crazy night
marked the first moment we knew that we chose the
right college. A related Facebook group also surfaced,
gaining members almost as quickly as the countless
anti-newsfeed groups.
Granted, the band and its members need to re
assess and consider the implications of their general
actions (and antics) if they want to regain full privi
leges again. However, it was a sad day when the new
Stanford Stadium opened and, in lieu of the live band,
there was merely a recording. It's no fun jumping to a
tape.
Now how much sadder would it have been had the
Class of 2010 been deprived of Band Run? There are
reasons that so many people were behind its preser
vation. It simply wouldn't have been justified to deny
the experience to freshmen, transfers and the student
body as a whole simply because of a confusing web of
University and Band snafus.
This is about more than just one crazy night. It's
about being fair and honoring spirit over politics.
