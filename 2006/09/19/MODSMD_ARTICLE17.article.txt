The decision to allow the Band to lead its famous
run tonight is a disappointment and leaves us wonder
ing why the University hasn't been more firm in the
face of embarrassing, shameful and otherwise ap
palling behavior.
Sure. Stanford's laid back atmosphere played a
mark in bringing many of us West, away from stodgy,
stuffy and staid Ivies. But, that said, the Stanford com
munity is generally an upstanding bunch. And we
pride ourselves on dignity, responsibility and respect
for institutions.
Unfortunately, as a representative of the Universi
ty. the Band is a gross aberration. For decades, the be
havior of some of its members has been consistently
shameful. Allowing the Band to continue its behavior
on the basis of'tradition' would be like allowing a bully
to beat you up because he does it every September.
It is rightly time to reign in this student-run group
known for its drunken escapades, its open hostility to

orderliness and its blatant disregard ior tenets ot the
Fundamental Standard.This isn't a time lor provision
al status or a slap on the wrist or even double secret
probation. They had their chance. They did not lead.
The University must, and the message must be clear.
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on
me.
We are a tolerant campus,but we won?t tolerate the
Band?s renegade and wanton abrasion. It sets a worri
some precedent that students can break the law and
get away with it simply because of the cushy Stanford
Bubble.
They have made us a laughing stock around the
country and undermined our moral authority in other
areas. In places across the heartland of America, like
Utah and Indiana, people think of Stafford students as
sacrilegious and profane because of the Band?s wild
antics.
Band members have acted more like ravenous chil
dren than bona fide adults.They get a new Band Shak.
and they destroy the old one. The Tree gets a second
chance, but then she gets drunk enough to be kicked
off the Band. The next mascot defies security officials
at Berkeley and the NCAA had to get involved.
It's time for a change.
