# Lobsters, Vampires & Activities Fair
## 
### 
Ihave some advice to my fellow college
students as we begin class this fall. In the
first few weeks of school, there will in
evitably be a club or activities fair. Each
group will be fishing for new recruits, new
blood and new money. We're in a glass tank
in a seafood restaurant, and the fat guy just
ordered the lobster.
I'm nobody's buttery meal. They'll never
hook me into joining their club and they're
never getting their paws on my clams. So
don't let the complimentary cookies or the
free t-shirts delude you, my friends â€” these
clubs don't really want you.They want your
name.They got your name and they got their
lifeblood. More membership means more
money from the university: these people are
extracurricular vampires, feeding on the
names and e-mail addresses of the student
population. But they're never satisfied, for
ever cursed to roam the land and harass hu
manity. They leave the student population
overextended and women with plenty of ex
cuses why they can't see me on a Friday
night.
I'll take their offers of free cookies, candy,
and key chains but they won't get my name
down on their club list. Word to the wack:
Don't give your real e-mail address to these
groups. Give your roommate's instead.
Watch with amusement as he curses every
time he opens his e-mail. Just don't be sur
prised if after he moves out. he doesn't leave
a forwarding address and you think he's
somewhere in the middle of Utah. Plotting.
As you go around the activities fair, do as
I do and feel free to pick up any free candies
or shirts groups may be giving out while nim
bly avoiding the mailing lists. As you walk
around, you will inevitably run into the stu
dent government people. At every school,
there will be some form of student govern
ment and they will always call attention to
themselves like some sad Salvation Army
collector with a stained Santa suit and a
smell like your old uncle. Ignore these peo
ple or toss coins at them.
Next, you'll likely run into the bane of
every academically intensive university: the
a capella group. These a capella groups seem
to enjoy crooning clever and edgy butcher
ings of modern recording artists. If you listen
carefully, you can actually hear the angry
ghosts of Apollo, the god of music, vowing
revenge. I recommend trying out for these
groups and seeing how far you get doing an
opera version of a Shins song. Alternatively,
bring an instrument and insist that you need
it to "set the mood."
The din of this plaza is always alive with
the sound of a hundred screaming Ipod
mixes. What better way to attract attention
then put on music to show how cool your
dub is? Avoid these tables like you would a
cadre of Fall Out Boy fans. Instead, go over
to one of the athletic organizations. The
groups with the most skilled athletic mem
bers will inevitably be the hippie "non
sport" groups. Your football team sucks, but
