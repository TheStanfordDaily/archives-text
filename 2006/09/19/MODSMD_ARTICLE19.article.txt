### 
Those around during the 2006 Admit
Weekend probably recall the frenzy created
by President George Bush's planned visit to
campus on Friday Apr. 21. The quickly
planned yet overwhelming student protest
implemented that afternoon not only pre
vented Bush from safely meeting on campus
but also deflated the idea that Stanford stu
dents are apathetic towards political causes.
On Apr. 2H, The Daily editorial discussed the
implications of the protest and encouraged
the student body to persist in such proactive
awareness.
Last Friday's mass protest surrounding
President George W. Bush's visit is a social
phenomenon the likes of which Stanford
has rarely seen, at least in recent memory.
For a brief snapshot in time, the roads out
side Hoover Tower evoked an aura of 1960s
popular resistance — the breed of mobi
lization made famous by our rivals across
the Bay.
But many observers saw the visit other
wise: one particularly acidic letter to the ed
itor wrote that "those that blocked the
roads should be embarrassed — and like
anti-abortion zealots who block access to
clinics — they should be prosecuted for

their actions." Another concerned resident
agreed: "If these visitors from all walks of
life are prevented from appearing or are
not allowed to speak, they will stop coming,
and both Stanford and its students will have
lost a valuable resource." ITiese letters are
worth mentioning not because they make
just comparisons or reasonable assump
tions, but because beneath their paranoia
and hyperbole remains an important point.
Although the demonstrators were suc
cessful in forcing Bush to change his meet
ing location, on a deeper level the protest
was not fully effective or fully focused, or
even especially prolific. But rather than
cynically criticizing the process or the con
text, we should view last Friday's action in
optimistic terms— proof that Stanford
students can burst the Bubble and mean
ingfully engage with the world outside
Campus Loop.
Stanford students are frequently accused of
being self-absorbed. We often exhibit a dis
turbing tendency to be consumed with our
own lives. It is exactly this sort of criticism
that engenders a crippling sense of resigna
tion and actively discourages efforts to be
come engaged in world affairs. If we have
become so self-absorbed without even try
ing, is it even possible to reverse the trend?
It would be unfair to tar the entire cam
pus with the brush of apathy. It is easy to
forget that most students learned about
Bush's visit less than 24 hours before Ma

rine One landed on Sand Hill Field: in fact,
many of us heard of his arrival only when
we came across the sign-making extrava
ganza in White Plaza or the march beside
the Quad. Nonetheless, the ranks of pro
testers included several hundred Stanford
students, motivated enough to express their
strong beliefs about issues that they care
passionately about.
People often question the ability of stu
dents to effectively rally behind a cause.
But to decry the protest as a strictly parti
san success (or failure),or even to complain
that Stanford students were mostly specta
tors, is to miss the point entirely. Rather, the
organic, popular and grassroots nature of
this protest should be lauded, regardless of
your political orientation or activist pedi
gree. Nevertheless, we would expect the
general vitriol of protests on campus to im
prove with greater warning, time and prac
tice. In order to test this theory, we can only
hope that Bush chooses to return, or that
we somehow manage to elect an even less
popular president.
As for the future, it is our own responsi
bility to ensure that this single event trans
lates into a consistent spirit of voluntarism,
collectivism and engagement. If a sense of
empowerment was gained from Bush's visit
— even if it was a little messy — then last
Friday's exercise was worthwhile. It was
only a first step, but a step in the right direc
tion nonetheless.
