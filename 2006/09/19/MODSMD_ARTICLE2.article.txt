## Frosh flock to Facebook to meet peers RAs are worried that trend is changing face of Orientation 
### KELLEY FONG 
Isa Dillingham has 14ft Facebook friends at
Stanford, tailgated with a group of students be
fore the Navy game Saturday and has plans for
a "Greys Anatomy" marathon with her dorm
mates later this week — a remarkably full so
cial calendar for a freshman who hasn't moved
into Roble yet.
Dillingham is one of many freshmen that
have used the online social networking site
Facebook.com to meet classmates and help
each other prepare for college, a trend that has
some staff members worried that incoming stu
dents are forming preconceived notions about
their future housemates.
"The freshmen are already checking out
people, making judgments about them," said
senior Peter Livingston, a resident assistant
(RA) in Cedro.
The staff in that all-freshmen house formed
the Facebook group "Cedro '06-07!" over the
summer, but when residents began Facebook
"friending" the staff in droves, the RAs became
concerned.They were worried, he said, that with
so much personal information on their profiles,
the freshmen might begin not only forming
opinions about their classmates, but about the
staff. TTiey debated blocking residents from
viewing staff member profiles altogether. Ulti
mately the staff decided to keep their profiles
open but minimize Facebook interactions with
the freshmen by waiting to accept friend re
quests.
These hesitations have been shared by Josh
Schiller, associate director of Residential Edu
cation, who has advised staff members to limit
their contact with residents until Orientation to
avoid the perception of favoritism.
"If you have already established relation
ships with some of your frosh, but not all of
them, this will reflect in the way that you inter
act at the beginning of the year," Schiller said.
Freshmen connecting with dormmates be
fore move-in day to relieve pre-Orientation jit
ters is nothing new. This is the third incoming
class to use the Facebook since its creation in
2004. and students met online for years before
Facebook, most notably through Yahoo groups.
This year's freshmen class, however, has em
braced the site more than previous classes —
the "Stanford 2010" group boasts more than
1.000 members, and over 600 wall posts, while
"Stanford 2(MW" by comparison has 724 mem
bers and never generated much chatter.
