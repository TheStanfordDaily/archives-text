# How does admissions really work at Stanford?
## 
### 
Iti the next few weeks you will probably
be meeting an overwhelming amount of dif
ferent people?different because each one
possesses such unique experiences, knowl
edge and talents from the next. Each of them
got into Stanford for a reason but no one
(not even the individual himself) knows
what exactly got him in. The May 11th edito
rial considered this topic and also discussed
how we as a student body can influence fu
ture admissions processes in order to retain
Stanford?s unique environment.
Why are we here? We don't mean this in
a metaphorical sense. Rather, why did the
admissions office decide that we should be

admitted to Stanford? Perhaps we'll never
really know.
Because college admissions are holistic,
they are intended to focus on more than
just your CPA and SAT scores. However, as
a consequence, it's nearly impossible to
know exactly why we accepted to Stanford
â€” or any other university, for that matter.
On the flip side, this makes it equally
challenging for the people in admissions to
have a clear idea of who they are admitting
toStanford.Afterall.it is just as difficult for
them to evaluate candidates based solely
on a few essays they write or other similar
ly vague criteria that a holistic admissions
process demands.
Yet this does not mean that there is not
some standard by which the University
cannot set. with the broad goal of empha
sizing certain characteristics and de-em-

phasizing others. In fact, the very nature of
the admissions process would make it more
important for us to think more clearly
about the sort of applicants we would like
to attract to the Farm.
In the face of mounting pressure to im
prove our rankings, we should remember
that any changes we might make to the ad
missions process should not come at the
cost of student quality. Rather. Stanford
should continue implementing policies that
have given the University its unique char
acter.
One path that we feel the University ad
missions should take is to ensure that Stan
ford continues to differentiate itself from
other universities of its caliber. At first, this
may seem like an idle pronouncement, with
no possible method by which it could be
carried out or its results measured.
