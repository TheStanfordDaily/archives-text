# More dining options and healthier food are needed
## 
### 
As you adjust to eating in a dining hall
rather than moseying down to y
our home kitchen, you should discover that
the food here is actually pretty decent â€”that
mystery meat from your high school cafete
ria will not be resurfacing in the near fu
ture. However, while the possibilities of all
you-can-eat buffets and late night fried fare
might sound enticing now, there is ample
room for improvement within Stanford
Dining.This April sth editorial offered sug
gestions for further improving both dining
hall logistics and the food choices offered
on campus.
Stanford Dining already makes great ef
forts to cater to a set of diverse student
tastes and needs. However, the current din
ing system unintentionally supports un
healthy eating habits. Stanford Dining
needs to do more to promote healthier eat
ing among students.
Most nutritionists agree that it is health
ier to eat five small meals rather than three

large meals every day. However, because
dining halls are closed between meals, stu
dents feel the need to eat enough to last
them until the next meal.
In particular, weekends constitute the
greatest threat to healthy eating patterns,
because dining halls only provide two
meals on weekends, brunch and dinner.
Some students will eat even more during
weekend brunches than on regular week
day lunches, because brunch often has to
last over six hours until the next meal. On
top of presenting a health issue, the week
end two-meal policy imposes a particular
rhythm on students' lives. The fact that
brunch starts at 10 at the earliest provides
incentives to stay up late the night before
and sleep in on weekend mornings. Stu
dents who prefer to get an early start on
weekends find themselves having to work
on an empty stomach. We suggest that one
or two dining halls on campus open half an
hour earlier for brunch and gauge student
interest.
Although dining halls cannot be open 24
hours a day, they could have an open
kitchen with a limited selection of basic
items such as cereal, milk, fruits, and drinks

available throughout the clay and after din
ner.
If Stanford Dining cannot meet all the
diverse needs that students have, then they
should let other on-campus eateries and
cafes fill in the gap. In recent years, Stan
ford Dining has expanded the number of
dining options available on campus
through the point system and should be
commended for it. But the University
should greatly increase the flexibility with
which students can use Cardinal Dollars at
a variety of dining locations. Moreover,
there should be healthy options available in
most places where points can be used. For
example. Late Nite at Stern and Lakeside
arc better known for their pizza and chick
en wings than for their yogurt and fruit.
That is fine, as long as they provide a rea
sonable selection of healthy options.
Stanford Dining already does a good job
offering many high-quality options in its
dining halls. Future efforts to improve the
quality of students' dining experience
should concentrate on increasing the flexi
bility of meal plans and dining hall sched
ules.
