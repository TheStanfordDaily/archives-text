# GRADUATE LIFE
## Grad school: Where fun goes to die 
### 
Are you a freshman? If so. bug off. This
column isn't meant for you. Go and
read something else. Better yet. run
along and play with your toys or do whatev
er the hell it is you kids do these days.The fol
lowing is meant for grown ups.
When I say grown ups. I (of course) mean
graduate students. And by graduate students,
I mean real ones, not lame-ass co-terms,
swishy business school types, earnest medics
or smug lawyers. In fact, even master's stu
dents might not really count.
No, this week's words of welcoming wis
dom are for the new arrivals in grad school,
flush with knowledge and ready to embark
on an epic journey to the land of P. hand D. I
bet you're all very excited.
Don't be. Your life is over. No matter how
you feel right now, it will get worse. Without
question you will soon be regretting you de
cision to immerse yourself in another fix, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17
or more years of study.
Now, some may disagree with me. It is cer
tainly true that many people enjoy their time
in graduate school. But these people are
strange. Either way, it doesn't matter how
much fun you end up claiming to have had —
some things are true for everyone.
You will regret coming to grad school.
You will resent your friends who got real jobs
and make money. You will dream about leav
ing. You will frequently wonder what contri
bution your pointless research is making to
the world. You will wonder where the fun
went.
Helping you along on the path to misery
are undergraduates. Although one would
like to dismiss the vermin as prototype hu
mans. not yet fully-formed and imbued with
the viciousness of children, they do have a
tendency to dominate campus life.
Misery is always a little more miserable if
one is forced to watch tall, tanned and often
semi-naked boys and girls frolic joyfully
across White Plaza.
I hate it when other people are happy.
Many things change as you grow up. Some
body parts swell, other wither away. Wisdom
is accumulated whilst open-mindedness
dribbles away. Prejudice replaces reason and
resignation rules over hope.
Though such changes are universal — thei
disintegration of the Self is inexorable —
there are some transitions that require the
particular mix of the pointless and the pre
tentious only graduate school can provide.
Take, for example, money. Generally, as
one grows up, one makes more and more
money. I think they call it career progression.
Now. one also spends more and more money
(that's called a desperate attempt to buy hap-|
piness) as the years pile on. And herein lies
the problem.
We all want to be part of that spending
group. You're 23. You should have a nicer car.
softer sheets, fluffier pillows, decent shoes
and so on. But you can't. Instead of getting
richer, you're becoming poorer.
Scraping by on a meagre stipend does not
