Dollies frustrated Band couldn't
perform at opening of new stadium
For the past ten weeks, the Stanford Band
has been on indefinite suspension, putting
not only our summer plans as Dollies, but our
plans for the next year into disarray and
chaos. When we were chosen to be Dollies in
March of last year, we made this commitment
with the expectation that we would be per
forming at the same events as the previous
year's dollies had done: football games, vol
leyball games, basketball games, charity
events and other rallies.
As Dollies, we are given only one year, a
year in which we willingly put a great deal of
our social and academic lives on hold in
order to perform with the Band and to repre
sent Stanford University.The personal sacri
fices the five of us have made are consider
able: classes have been put off, jobs have
been turned down, internships cut short, and
opportunities to travel changed to accommo
date what we expected to be a traditional
Dollie summer and year.
Imagine our shock and disappointment
when, upon preparing to come back to cam
pus for the six-week rehearsal period in which
we prepare our new dances for football sea
son - a considerable task of learning over 30
dances - we were forbidden to formally re
hearse for the upcoming season. Furthermore
the University has denied us rehearsal space
on campus - most specifically the use of our
brand new dance studio in the new Band

Shak.
By continuing the band suspension, the
administration is not only robbing the Dol
lies and innocent band members of our
chance to practice and perform, but they are
demoralizing our faith in the administra
tion's ability to make fair decisions which
punish the guilty and respect the innocent.
Additionally, we find the lack of communica
tion between the administration and the
band management to be unprofessional.
Although we fully respect the hard deci
sions the administration has to make, we, as
Dollies and as Stanford students, do not ap
preciate the administration's continual post
ponement of rational decision-making. For
the past weeks, we have been waiting with
baited breath for any word with regard to the
future of our Dollie year, and again and again
the University has delayed and stalled.
Whether or not we will be allowed to re
hearse or perform and when has not been re
vealed to us. Increasingly distressing is the
fact that we feel there is nothing we can do to
expedite or remedy the situation. In conclu
sion, we can only hope that the administra
tion will recognize its students' best interest
as its top priority.
We can only hope that the Band, one of
the largest all-volunteer student service
groups on campus, which brings energy, spir
it. and fun to the student body, will be re
leased from suspension. We can only hope
that the individuals responsible will be pun
ished appropriately, and that we, as Dollies,

have not sacrificed our Freshman spring, our
summer, and the entirety of our Sophomore
year for nothing.
RESPECTFULLY YOURS.
The 2<H>6-21H)7 Dollies
Bad fans, bad band, good stadium
It's been over a year since I was last on
campus, since 1 wrote for the Daily and since
1 publicly proclaimed my hatred for the
Band. Saturday, 1 had the opportunity to see
my two Alma Maters meet on the football
field,an occurrence rare enough to justify the
six hour drive to see the game, and an occa
sion which also coincided with the opening of
Stanford's new stadium. And while you have
an AMAZING new stadium —certainly,
the class of the Pac-10 —you still have the
worst football fans at any major university
and a band that remains an embarrassment
to your school. At least you've finally gotten
the cheerleaders right.
What kind of band is so screwed up that it
misses an event like Saturday's? And don't
tell me that it's not the Band's fault. You
mean, you couldn't see this coming? It's an
isolated incident? The fact is, the Band has
been an increasingly annoying eyesore for
years, and now it's the subject of national
ridicule (See the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the
Indianapolis Star, the San Francisco Chroni
cle, etc.) Looks like I may have been the rule

and not the exception after all. (see my col
umn 3/1/05) to which I'm certain the hand
will respond that we're ALL now fascists.
Listen, that response is even more tired than
the Band's act. Just stop, you're only making
it worse.
What fills me with joy is the fact that the
world's worst fans and corresponding band,
got a chance to see what real fans and a real
band look like, right in the middle of their
own brand new house. Because, amidst
Navy's sound beating of a stronger, faster
and more experienced football team, they
also came with louder, more excited fans, a
rowdier student section, and a band that
doesn't suck. There it is Stanford, that's the
best look you're ever going to get.
I overheard one Stanford fan lamenting
"We're stronger and faster than all these
guys, how can we possibly be losing?" I'll tell
you something that I learned while still a
freshman at Navy: it's all about "heart." None
of the Navy players will play in the NFL, and
none of them were likely recruited by the
major conference schools. Iliey go through
the same grind as all the midshipmen at
Navy, they get no special favors — they stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with the rest of the
Brigade. After graduation, many of them will
go to war — a place where their touchdowns
and tackles mean nothing. So why do they
play? Perhaps for love of the game, for pride
in their school, perhaps for the crowd who
they know will stay to the end of the game
and cheer them, win or lose. For whatever

reason they play, they play; and they play
hard. They play with HEART. And that's
why I cheer for them. ITiere are very few pure
things left in college football,and Navy is one
of them.
The Stanford football team has little rea
son to dig down deep. I've seen more ex
citement at a knitting convention. And at
the first sign of adversity, the so-called
"fans" filed for the exits like rats on a sink
ing ship. ITiat's right, in the THIRD QUAR
TER of the home opener in a BRAND
NEW stadium many cardinal-wearing spec
tators were already headed home. Better
things to do I guess. What's worse, when it
came time to sing Stanford's alma mater
(after Navy sang theirs to a packed house),
there wasn't even an identifiable section of
fans for the Stanford team to stand in front
of to sing — the student section had long
since gone off to their own parties. Embar
rassing.
For the men of the Stanford football team,
here's something you might not hear enough
from your own crowd: Great game; you
played hard; and better luck next week. You
guys deserve that great stadium.
As for the "fans" and the Band, you don't
even deserve to be let inside.
