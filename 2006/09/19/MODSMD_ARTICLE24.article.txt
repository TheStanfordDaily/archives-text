And due to the opacity of the ad
missions process, it is hard to meas
ure the success of the admissions
process until several years after a
class is admitted.
But we should remember that admis
sions is one of the most important
processes that determine the essence
of the University, even if its effects
are not directly felt in our day-to-day
lives.
Why should Stanford try to con
tinue to differentiate itself? The rea
son is neither mere worship of tradi
tion, nor an ill-will towards similar
caliber Ivy League universities.
Rather, by differentiating ourselves,
we are making an effort to attract
students who would thrive at Stan

ford. Students who desire an envi
ronment like Stanford's will end up
in a place where they can be happy.
Similarly, students who, for whatever
incomprehensible reason, know they
wouldn't be happy at Stanford will
know that they should enroll in a uni
versity more suited to them.
More importantly, however, the
student body should ask questions
about the sort of qualities we would
like to see in incoming freshmen
classes of the future. As we create a
diverse student body, what forms of
diversity do we value? Do we want
the academic environment at Stan
ford to be more scholarly or more
laid back? Would we like students to
be more athletically inclined, politi
cal active or socially involved? To
gether, we have a responsibility as a
community to work collectively to
ward articulating our vision for what
future generations of Stanford stu
dents should look like.
