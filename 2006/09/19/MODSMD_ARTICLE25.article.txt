## Body image on The Farm: watch out for each other 
### 
Stanford students are continually striving to im
prove. Whether it is grades, athletic performance or
personal relationships, we want to better a part of
our lives. And that's a positive thing. Sometimes,
however, these efforts can he taken too far, particu
larly when it comes to changing one's body image.
The May 4th editorial discussed the new dangers of
increased body-consciousness and the steps the Uni
versity can take to better foster the health of the stu
dent body.
Day or night, rain or shine, you can always count
on one thing — there will always be someone exer
cising on campus. In fact, when it comes to exercise,
the general attitude on campus is that there can
never be too much of a good thing.
But in reality, over-exercising can be a sign of
the dangerous eating disorder exercise bulimia.
Characterized by compulsive exercise, the disorder
is usually attached to feelings of guilt over eating. A
relatively new phenomenon, according to CNN, ex
ercise bulimia is predicted to become more threat
ening than both anorexia and bulimia.The disorder
is particularly dangerous because those who suffer
from it tend to give the illusion of health. Because

most people are under the impression that any
amount of exercise is healthy, the problem can eas
ily be confused with a healthy exercise regime and
is almost impossible to detect.
Body image is extremely important in college,
especially since we are located in a particularly
health-conscious state, on a campus that empha
sizes athletics. Iliis body-conscious environment
— combined with the competitive nature of the av
erage Stanford student — puts us at particularly
high risk for eating disorders.
But intervention training on campus is sparse
and poorly publicized. Apart from the few skits
and dorm sessions during New Student Orienta
tion. most students receive no guidance on how
to deal with eating disorders. The current inter
vention system is based on students encouraging
their friends to get help, but most don't know
how to spot an eating disorder — especially one
as unnoticeable as exercise bulimia — let alone
how to approach the situation or who to turn to
for help.
The University could help alleviate this prob
lem by implementing intervention training for eat
ing disorders and providing students with accessi

hie counselors who can help them cope with these
difficult issues. The University should also allow
dorm staff to step in and persuade students suffer
ing from disorders to seek medical help, rather than
wait for the student to come to terms with the dis
ease and voluntarily seek assistance.
I lowever. students must also take the initiative
to find out more about how to spot and deal with
eating disorders. If a friend, dormmate or classmate
is exhibiting possible symptoms of an eating disor
der — such as dramatic weight loss in a short peri
od of time, compulsive exercise or frequent trips to
the bathroom immediately following meals — stu
dents should take the initiative to talk to these in
dividuals. even at the risk of being wrong. Students
who feel themselves falling into these habits should
find someone — a friend, a peer health educator, a
resident assistant or a professional counselor — to
talk to before the problem gets out of hand.
But even in the absence of serious eating disor
ders, Stanford students' obsession with healthy eat
ing, exercise and general body image should raise
concern about the trend's underlying issues — our
insecurity with our body shapes and our general
dissatisfaction with ourselves.
