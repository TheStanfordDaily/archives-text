## Bursting the bubble: Be smart, be aware, be safe 
### 
Two armed robberies occurred on campus
within one week in May. Although no one was
physically harmed, Stan ford students learned not
to take the Bubble for granted, becoming slightly
more cautious, if not wary, about their personal
safety. While each individual can take a number of
precautions, the University is also responsible for
ensuring the safety of the student body. On May
22nd, the Daily editorial dealt with the issue of
campus security.
These incidents have reminded us that we
need to be alert as a community. Now more than
ever, we should not be propping doors. We should
question strangers loitering around our dorms.
We should not hesitate to report suspicious peo
ple to the police. And we should consider volun
teering for shifts with 5-SURE.
But at this point, we must consider what sort of

policies should be implemented to ensure cam
pus safety in the long term. We don't necessarily
want greater surveillance, and we certainly don't
want more restrictions. And while we woukl ap
preciate a slightly more visible police presence at
night, we don't need a fence surrounding campus,
nor do we need security checkpoints manned by
armed personnel. If there's anything we appreci
ate about Stanford, it's the fact that we are able to
wander freely around campus at 3 a.m. But we
should remember that Stanford is not a Bubble in
this respect, and that we take risks whenever we
walk alone outside in the middle of the night.
Nevertheless, the University needs to take
steps to implement measures to increase campus
safety. One area that demands immediate atten
tion is that of the "blue lights" scattered around
campus. Blue lights are not as evenly scattered

across campus as they should be, and there are
plenty of dimly-lit walkways that do not have
blue lights within reach. Also, it is often hard to
spot the next nearest tower from any given tower.
Moreover, there tends to be skepticism about
whether these towers work at all as well as confu
sion as to what type of situations warrant the ac
tivation of the blue light.
University administrators need to do more to
respond to questions and concerns about the
"blue lights."These recent robberies represent an
opportunity to inform and educate students
about campus safety. Greater commitment to
campus safety is needed in the form of increased
funding for infrastructure like blue towers and
services like 5-SURE. We hope that these inci
dents will galvanize the University to take signif
icant action.
