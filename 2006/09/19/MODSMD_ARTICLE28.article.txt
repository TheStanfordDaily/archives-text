## Grocers pitch spinach alternatives 
### JUSTIN M. NORTON ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
SAN FRANCISCO — Grocers tried to lure shop
pers with alternative greens, as a national recall of
spinach because of an E. coli outbreak otherwise had
little impact on companies that handle and sell pro
duce.
rhe bacteria has killed one person and sickened
more than 1(H) others in 21 states.lTie Food and Drug
Administration warned consumers not to eat fresh
spinach, prompting grocery stores from Maine to Cal
ifornia to pull it from their shelves.
We ve taken this as an opportunity to feature
other greens, said Kate Lowery, a spokeswoman for
Austin, Texas based Whole Foods Market Inc.. which
has 186 stores nationwide.
She said Whole Foods is featuring leafy greens like
arugula. kale or mache to woo shoppers who normal
ly buy fresh spinach. ITie grocer also continued warn
ing consumers to stay away from fresh spinach and
throw away old bagged spinach that may be sitting in
the refrigerator.
Whole Foods stock rose $1.67 Monday to close at
$57.99 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
With spinach accounting for a tiny fraction of their
overall sales, other grocers reported mixed results dur
ing the first full day of trading since the E. coli out
break was traced to bagged, fresh spinach from Cali
fornia's Salinas Valley.
Wild Oats Markets Inc. shares dropped 3 cents to
close at $16.23 on the Nasdaq, while Safeway Inc.'s
stock rose 50 cents to close at $29.83 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Supervalu Inc., with brands like Albertson's and
Shoppers Food and Pharmacy, rose 24 cents to close at

$30.18 on the NYSE.
Ttoo of the big distributors responsible for getting
spinach and other vegetables to market saw their
shares drop Monday. Chiquita Brands International
Inc. dropped 54 cents to close at $16.60 on the NYSE,
and Sysco Corp. saw its shares fall 59 cents to close at
$33.19 on the NYSE.
Grocers say people aren't staying away from pro
duce, but they are making small changes to their shop
ping habits.
"We have quite a group of shoppers who like their
greens. I'd like to think of this as an opportunity until
spinach gets back on track," Whole Foods' Lowery
said. "You are going to turn on someone who wouldn't
normally have an arugula salad."
Wild Oats, a Boulder. Colo., based grocer with 113
stores, will begin receiving new bagged salad mixes on
TUesday or Wednesday that don't include spinach,
spokeswoman SonjaTliitele said.
The company will also be playing up different "epi
curean" greens that have similar qualities to spinach,
like red lettuce and baby romaine. "We can introduce
consumers to some new and unique items they can't
find in other stores," she said.
Some officials said the real fallout from the tainted
spinach won't be felt by grocers and distributors, but
by the farmers and the produce companies that buy
their spinach. Two of those companies — Salinas
based River Ranch Fresh Foods and Natural Selection
Foods LLC, based in San Juan Bautista — both re
called their bagged spinach.
"The growers, the producers are most interested in
finding the answers to these outbreaks," said Rep. Sam
Farr, whose district includes the Salinas Val
ley. "These outbreaks can bankrupt these compa
nies".
