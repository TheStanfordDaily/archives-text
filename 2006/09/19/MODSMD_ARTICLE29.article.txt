# A 						different kind of War on Drugs
## U.S. uploads anti-drug videos to You Tube online service 
### TED BRIDIS ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
WASHINGTON —The Bush administration is tak
ing its fight against illegal drugs to You'lube, the trendy
Internet video service that already features clips of
wacky, drug-induced behavior and step-by-step instruc
tions for growing marijuana plants.
The decision to distribute anti-drug, public service an
nouncements and other videos over YouTUbe represents
the first concerted effort by the U.S. government to influ
ence customers of the popular service, which shows more
than 100 million videos per day.
The administration was expected to announce the de
cision formally on TUesday. It said it was not paying any
money to load its previously produced videos onto
You Tube's service, so the program is effectively free.
"If just one teen sees this and decides illegal drug use
is not the path for them, it will be a success," said Rafael
Lemaitre, a spokesman for the drug office.
The government's YouTUbe videos include a previ
ously televised. 30-second ad of a teenager running from
a snarling dog and bemoaning pressure from his friends
to smoke marijuana.
"Then today, they said I should try to out run Tic Tic,
the lumber-yard dog," the teen says."And I don't think I
can. I'm an idiot."
YouTUbe, a San Mateo, Calif.-based startup, has be
come one of the Internet's hottest properties since two
20-something friends started the company 19 months

ago. The free service allows users to share and view
videos, most of which are amateurishly produced and in
clude clips of young people singing and dancing — usu
ally badly.
The government's short public service announce
ments — all of which were produced previously for tele
vision — are highly polished. They will compete for
viewership against hundreds of existing, drug-related
videos that include shaky footage of college-age kids
smoking marijuana and girls dancing wildly after pur
portedly using cocaine. Other You Ilibe videos describe
how to grow marijuana and how to cook with it.
"Welcome to the great experiment," said Lee Rainie,
director of the Pew Internet & American Life Project. He
predicted computer-savvy critics of U.S. drug policies will
quickly edit the government's videos to produce parodies
and distribute those on You Tube. "This seems pretty new
and pretty adventurous."
Ilie government linked its videos with the terms "war
on drugs." "peer-pressure," "marijuana," "weed,"
"ONDCP" and "420," so anyone searching for those
words on You Tube could find its anti-drug messages. All
the videos were associated with a YouTUbe account
named "ONDCPstaff" and identified as an 18-year-old
living in Washington.The term 420 is a popular reference
for marijuana.
Michael Bugeja, who studies how different groups use
the Internet,said the White House plan is misdirected be
cause online video services don't afford serious consider
ation to weighty topics.
"It's the wrong forum and the wrong target," said
Bugeja, an author and director of the journalism school
at lowa State University.
