# Major music labels, seeking profits, negotiate deals with You Tube
## 
### RACHEL KONRAD APTECHNOLOGY WRITER 
SAN JOSE, Calif. — A revenue-sharing
deal between video startup You Tube Inc. and
Warner Music Group Corp. is likely to be the
first of a spate of content distribution part
nerships between Web sites and music com
panies, industry officials say.
Warner Music Group Corp., the country's
third-largest recording company with annual
revenue of $3.5 billion, announced Monday a
deal to distribute and license its copyrighted
songs and other material through YbuTube.
The agreement means that millions of
You Tube users can legally watch music
videos or include popular songs in their own
homemade videos that they post on
YouTUbe.
Universal Music Group spokesman Peter
LoFrumento confirmed Monday that Uni
versal — the top record label in the world,
representing artists such as Eminem, Melissa
Etheridge, Snoop Dogg.ShaniaTwain.Stevie

Wonder and Sting — is also negotiating with
You Tube to strike a distribution deal.
Last week. Universal Music Group CEO
Doug Morris said that the company had to
figure out some way to stop "copyright in
fringers" such as YouTlibe and News Corp.'s
social networking site MySpace.com. Morris
implied that, if YouTUbe negotiations fell
through. Universal might resort to lawsuits
or other measures.
Sony BMG Music Entertainment is also
negotiating with You Tube, but a representa
tive for New York-based Sony BMG said
Monday that the company wouldn't com
ment on ongoing negotiations. Sony BMG la
bels include Arista Records, Columbia
Records, Epic Records, Sony BMG Nashville
and Sony Urban Music.
Negotiations between the 19-month-old
startup YouTUbe and the biggest players in
the recording industry mark a major change
in the previously chilly relationship between
Hollywood and Silicon Valley.
For years, music and movie companies

were reluctant to use the Internet to dissem
inate content because of the threat of piracy
and copyright infringement. But business ex
perts say the phenomenon of You'llibe and
MySpace — particularly among young con
sumers — have forced the labels to venture
online.
Simultaneously, startups seem increasing
ly willing to come up with revenue-sharing
business models that compensate recording
executives and their artists, said Phil Leigh,
president of market research group Inside
Digital Media.
"The Warner deal is one more piece of ev
idence that the record labels are compre
hending the value of free music distribution,"
Leigh said. "Instead of insisting on being paid
every time, they're realizing they can use the
Internet to popularize music and stimulate
demand for both CD and digital downloads."
The Warner-YouTUbe deal, announced
Monday, means that Warner will transfer
thousands of its music videos, artist inter
views and other digital content to San Mateo,

Calif.-based You'lUbe,a Website launched 19
months ago by two 20-something buddies.
Industry analysts praised the deal. Instead of
protesting free digital distribution by sending
cease and desist orders or lawsuits, as record
labels did several years ago with Napster and
other emerging sites. Warner and YouTUbe
can work together.
Consumers will likely have access to
Warner music videos and songs by the end of
the year, when YouTUbe rolls out an ad
vanced content identification and royalty re
porting system to help minimize copyright
infringement.
"Warner has been the most aggressive in
all things digital, whether downloads or ring
tones and now video," said American Tech
nology Research Senior Analyst P.J. Mc-
Nealy. "This is a natural progression and a
pre-emptive strike to help eliminate poten
tial copyright concerns."
Besides the namesake label. Warner is re
leasing titles from the Atlantic, Asylum,
Elektra and Rhino labels, which feature

artists Led Zeppelin, the Doors and Ray
Charles, as well recent hit makers Linkin
Park, Green Day and Faith Hill.
YouHibe and Warner will share revenue
from advertising on both Warner videos and
videos that YouTUbe users upload that in
clude content from Warner's music video li
brary. YouHibe users view more than KM)
million videos per day.
Pacific Crest Securities analyst Steve Lid
berg expects the Warner deal to be the first of
many in upcoming months.
"The labels still want to be paid each time.
What's changed is that they've found new
monetization models where they can get
paid." Lidberg said. "It's a new revenue
source for Warner that they weren't getting
paid from before.... I'd expect this to be the
foundation by which YouTUbe could have
other discussions with the major labels in the
marketplace."
Warner stock closed at $24.40 Monday,
down 10 cents from Friday on the Nasdaq
Stock Exchange.
