## SJSU may ban Skype for students 
### STEFANIE CHASE SPARTAN DAILY (SAN JOSH STATE) 
(U-WIRE) SAN JOSE, Calif. â€” Students and
faculty at San Jose State University may have to
find a new way to communicate with people
around the world if a ban on Skype, a voice-over
Internet protocol, is implemented.
A policy statement was released last week ex
plaining why Skype may no longer be allowed at
SJSU.
Don Baker, interim associate vice president of
university computing and telecommunications,
said some of the reasons include the use of state re
sources for retail purposes and the fear of acquir
ing computer viruses.
According to the Skype Web site,"Skype is a lit
tle piece of software that lets you make free calls
to anyone else on Skype, anywhere in the world."
Steve Sloan, help desk and information tech
nology support services specialist, said Skype can
also be used to chat, similar to Instant Messenger,

and to send files.
Baker said one problem with Skype is that it
uses grid computing. Grid computing, in the case
of Skype. is a system that allows users access to
other Skype users' networks, whether the other
user is using Skype at that time or not.
Baker said the problem with grid computing at
SJSU is that it uses state resources for retail pur
poses. Baker added that Skype, in SJSU's case,
takes a state-funded computer and uses an outside
company to place calls.
If Skype continues to be used on state-funded
computers, this could potentially make taxpayers
upset. Baker said.
"We're talking about broadband issues," said
Alfred Eclipse, academic technical services coor
dinator for the TV education network at SJSU.
Baker said the conflict that must be resolved is
that sonic colleges at the university want Skype
banned while others want to use it.
He added that those who are against the pro
gram may have concerns about worms and viruses

obtained through Skype.
According to Sloan, Skype is a tool that some
teachers use in the classroom. He said that if Skype
is no longer permitted on the SJSU campus, it will
be a "disadvantage to educators as well (as to stu
dents)."
i think it's going to have a significant impact,"
Sloan said.
Eclipse said there are other programs similar to
Skype that can be used.
"At this point in time, the way I see it (is), Skype
is more of a personal preference," Eclipse said.
Eclipse added that the TV education network
uses a different program that performs the same
tasks that Skype is capable of doing.
Baker said the decision to ban Skype at SJSU does
look like a possibility.
"We haven't made that decision (yet)," Baker
said.
He said people for and against Skype will share
their arguments, and the decision will be reviewed
this week.
