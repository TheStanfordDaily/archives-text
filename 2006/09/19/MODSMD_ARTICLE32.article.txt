# HP investigation extends beyond phones
## 
### MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP BUSINESS WRITER 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Extending be
yond the skullduggery that pried loose people's
private phone records. I lewlett-Packard Co. inves
tigators hunting for a boardroom leak shadowed
the company's directors and tried to install snoop
ing software on at least one reporter's computer,
according to published reports.
While the additional surveillance reported by
The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal
may provoke more indignation about HP's probe,
the tactics aren't likely to shift the focus of the in
quiries into whether the company and its investi
gators broke any laws in their quest to identify the
boardroom leaker.
Authorities and politicians remain primarily
concerned about the deceptive measures that en
abled HP's investigators to obtain the personal
phone logs of several directors, nine reporters, two
employees and a semiretired physicist.
To pull off a ruse known as "pretexting." HP's
investigators masqueraded as the targeted indi
viduals, using parts of their Social Security num
bers to dupe telephone companies into turning
over their calling records.
Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for California At
torney General Bill Lockyer,emphasized on Mon
day that the state's inquiry remains focused exclu
sively on pretexting.
Lockyer, who opened the first investigation into
HP's tactics, already has said that he has enough
evidence to indict people inside and outside HP
but is still try ing to determine the breadth of the
suspected crimes. Other investigations are under
way at the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission and the Federal
Communications Commission.

A congressional panel also has scheduled a
Sept. 28 hearing to examine HP's investigation
and wants several key figures involved in the
probe to testify. Responding to a request made last
week. HP on Monday handed over documents
pertaining to its investigation to the House Ener
gy and Commerce Committee.
The scandal — the subject of intense media at
tention for nearly two weeks — already has
prompted HP to reshuffle its board.
Chairwoman Patricia Dunn, who authorized
the investigation, has agreed to surrender that job
to HP's chief executive, Mark Hurd. although she
will remain a director after the change occurs in
January. George Keyworth 11. the director identi
fied as the media source, also has resigned, follow
ing another board member, Silicon Valley venture
capitalist Tom Perkins, who quit in May to signal
his outrage over HP's probe.
Two corporate spokespeople also were target
ed during the internal 11P probe.
One was Michael Moeller, who said Saturday
he had received apologies from Hurd and Dunn
and planned to stay on the job. The second HP
spokesperson whose phone records were secretly
obtained was Brigida Bergkamp, HP spokesman
Ryan Donovan confirmed Monday.
Bergkamp did not return calls for comment, in
stead referring questions to Donovan.
"The investigation has concluded that any sus
picion of Brigida was baseless, and she plans to re
main with HP," Donovan said on her behalf.
Besides digging into phone records under false
pretenses, HP's investigators also followed some
of the company's directors and possibly some re
porters as well, according to 'llie New York Times,
which cited anonymous sources that had been
briefed on the clandestine operation. The Wall
Street Journal also reported the probe involved

trailing at least one HP director and at least one re
porter.
In another twist.The New York Times said HP's
detectives tried to plant a software program that
would have monitored the computer of a reporter
for CNET Networks Inc.'s News.com, an online
technology news site that published one of the ar
ticles containing information anonymously leaked
by Keyworth.
That bit of attempted subterfuge apparently
failed, the Times reported.
Donovan declined to comment on the latest re
ports.
The Palo Alto-based company already has
apologized for the intrusion into private phone
records, although Dunn has insisted she had no
idea that investigators were going to such ex
tremes. To help with the investigation, the compa
ny hired Security Outsourcing Solutions Inc., a
Needham, Mass. firm that apparently hired other
subcontractors.
Congress wants to question Ronald DeLia, the
private investigator that runs Security Outsourc
ing, as well as Dunn, HP General Counsel Ann
Baskins and the company's outside lawyer, Larry
Sonsini, who had defended the pretexting tactics
as "not generally unlawful."
Donovan declined to comment Monday on
whether Dunn or Baskins intended to appear at
next week's hearing.
HP's stock price continued to fare well amid
the uproar over the company's spying methods, re
flecting investors confidence that management
will be able to extend a recent run of rising profits
despite the distractions caused by the pretexting
imbroglio.
The company's shares gained 22 cents Monday to
close at $36.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.
