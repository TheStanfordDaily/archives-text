## Shuttle Atlantis prepares to return 
### RASHA MADKOUR ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
HOUSTON — In a routine
familiar to travelers on Earth,
shuttle astronauts were spending
Tuesday packing their things, in
dulging in their surroundings one
last day and making sure their ve
hicle is ready for the ride home.
In preparation for Wednes
day's landing at the Kennedy
Space Center after 11 days in
space, the Atlantis crew checked
flight controls — similar to those
on an airplane — and test fired
small jets that are used to guide
the shuttle. The commander and
pilot used simulations to practice
their landing skills.
Then they participated in a rare
occurrence: a conference call with
two other spacecraft also current
ly in orbit. Before landing, they
were to revert the shuttle to air
plane mode, bringing out the seats
and stowing cabins.
"It's a little crowded in the sky
this morning," said Jeff Williams, a
resident of the international space
station the shuttle undocked from
on Sunday after delivering and in
stalling a solar panel addition.
"We were wondering if we had
to hire some more air traffic con
trollers for the increased traffic up
here," responded Michael Lopez-
Alegria from the Russian Soyuz
capsule that launched from Kaza
khstan on Monday. He's part of
the Expedition 14 that will be tak
ing over from Williams' crew.
During the 10-minute conver
sation, while the space station and
shuttle hovered over Australia and
the capsule over the Black Sea, the
astronauts reminisced about their
time together, the times to come
and the latest drama in the cos
mos.
An oxygen generator over
heated Monday, causing much
alarm and adrenaline flow on
Earth and in space. Space station
crew members pulled an alarm
and donned protective gear after
smelling the generator overheat,
spreading smoke and a burned
rubber smell and leaking potassi
um hydroxide, an irritant that is
used to power batteries. NASA
said the leak was not life-threaten
ing, and the crew cleaned up the
spill.
"We heard you had a little inci
dent yesterday but I guess every
thing's all right," Atlantis com
mander Brent Jett joked to

Williams. "We're sorry you guys
had to go through that but, yeah,
we're kind of glad we weren't
there and we want you all to know
that we didn't touch the Elek
tron."
Twelve astronauts in space at
once isn't a record, said NASA
spokesman Pat Ryan. The cosmos
have hosted 13 astronauts at once
three times, most recently in 2001,
Ryan said. Still, he added, it is very
infrequent that three different
spacecraft are concurrently in
space.
During their mission, the At
lantis astronauts officially re
sumed construction of the interna
tional space station after a four
year hiatus. The 115-foot-long
solar wings they added will gener
ate power for the space station
once it's rewired during the next
mission, slated to launch in De
cember.
Progress on the orbiting lab
halted after the Columbia disaster
in 2003, when the space shuttle dis
integrated while re-entering the
Earth's atmosphere, killing all
seven astronauts aboard.
Since that incident, NASA has
implemented several safety proce
dures, including Monday's inspec
tion of the shuttle using a robotic
arm with a TV camera and laser
imagery system attached on the
end. NASA is now studying those
images for any damage that might
jeopardize the shuttle's de-orbit,
originally scheduled to begin at
4:57 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, but
unfavorable weather conditions
may delay it until later in the day
Wednesday or on Thursday.
Asked by a television reporter
in his hometown of Philadelphia if
he had any messages for his fami
ly, pilot Chris Ferguson said:
"Keep your fingers crossed that
the weather's nice tomorrow."
Atlantis woke up Ttiesday to a
recording of Celine Dion singing
"Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi" (Don't
Leave Without Me), dedicated to
Canadian astronaut Steve
Mac Lean.
"You guys are probably sad to be
heading home but it'll be nice to
have a cold beer and a shower,"
Lopez-Alegria said, laughing.
"It's been real short for us," Jett
replied. "It's kind of funny, you
guys are just starting a really long
journey in space and our really
short one is quickly coming to an
end. much sooner than we'd like."
