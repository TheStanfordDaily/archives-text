## FBI ends student surveillance program 
### ELIZABETH GELI LAUREN PEREZ DAILY TROJAN (USC) 
(U WIRE) LOS ANGELES — The FBI has
just ended a data-mining project that used student
financial aid records to search for possible terror
ists after Sept. 11.
Project Strikeback began soon after Sept. 11,
2001, and ran possible terrorist names against the
files of students who had recently filed for finan
cial aid. primarily through the Federal Application
for Student Aid. The search spanned schools
across the country; but fewer than 1.000 names
were looked at.
"(Students) have no reason to be concerned;
we were using a system that's been in place since
1474. and we exercised all of the proper safe
guards," said Mary Mitchelson, counsel to the in
spector general of the Department of Education.
The project ended in June because of very little ac
tivity.
John Miller, assistant director of public affairs

for the FBI, said that it "exhausted the pool" of
suspects. Miller could not comment on the results
of the searches because of ongoing investigations.
Neither Miller nor Mitchelson could confirm if
University of Southern California student records
were searched in conjunction with Project Strike
back.
"I want to assure students that this was not at all
widespread; it was a very limited effort," Mitchel
son said.
FBI and Department of Education officials
maintain that Project Strikeback was in concor
dance with the Privacy Act and a privacy notice on
the FAFSA itself. Miller said that this was always
public and posted on several government Web
sites.
Most students, however, didn't read the fine
print. "I don't remember what kind of waivers
about release of information are on the FAFSA,
but I certainly don't remember ever giving the FBI
permission to search through my stuff," said An
drew Tomlin, a sophomore majoring in music in

dustry.
Miller said that there were no "requirements"
to notify students within the "guidelines" of the
law.
Ihis project began because intelligence at the
time thought that terrorists might have been using
student visas for identity theft and student-loan
fraud.
"I understand that they were concerned be
cause the majority of these terrorist students at
tended aviation schools," said Cathy'Thomas, asso
ciate dean of Admission and Financial Aid at USC,
in a voicemail. "I don't like student financial aid
records being used for a phishing expedition with
out there being some charge of the individual stu
dent."
Most students said they do not see how the
FAFSA is related to terrorism.
"What are they going to find in a FAFSA? 1
doubt how much money somebody's grandma
gave them for college is going to identify them as a
terrorist "Tomlin said.
