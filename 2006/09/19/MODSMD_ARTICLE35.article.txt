# Valley and Stanford lead on solar power

### TERENCE CHEA ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
SAN JOSE, Calif. — As demand
for clean energy rises around the
world, the nation's high tech huh is
finding new ways to squeeze money
from silicon.
Silicon Valley, named for the ma
terial used to make computer chips,
is applying its expertise to design and
manufacture silicon solar cells that
convert sunlight into electricity. Ad
vocates hope the region's engineers
and entrepreneurs will help make
solar competitive with traditional en
ergy sources such as coal and natural
gas.
"We're in the very early stages of
a long build-out in solar technology ."
predicted Erik Straser. who heads
the "cleantech" practice at the Menlo
Park venture capital firm Mohr.
Davidow Ventures. "The potential is
really enormous."
Thanks to aggressive government
policies, Germany and Japan are still
the world's solar leaders, but as the
global market expands and Califor
nia launches ambitious programs to
promote solar energy, Silicon Valley
is emerging as a key center for sun
powered technology.
Solar cells, which produce an elec
tric current from the sun's rays, share
many similarities with the micro
processors that form the brains of
computers and other electrical de
vices.
Both are types of semiconductors —
devices that control the flow of elec
trical currents — and both are made
from polysilicon, a kind of silicon re
fined into crystals that can be sliced
into wafers. Solar cells, which are
commonly assembled together into
rooftop panels, are larger and made
from a less refined form of polysili
con than computer chips, but the
same manufacturing processes can
be applied.
Despite technological advances
since the first photovoltaic cells were
invented 50 years ago. solar is still
two to three more times more expen
sive than power generated from fos
sil fuels in the U.S. and relies on gov
ernment subsidies to compete.
But improving technology, falling
costs, rising prices for fossil fuels,
concerns about the electric grid's sta
bility and worries about global
warming are all fueling the growth of
solar. ITie industry' is expected to
grow from $11 billion in 2(H)5 to $51
billion in 2015, according to a projec
tion by Clean Edge Inc., a market re
search firm focused on clean technol
ogy.
And that's why Silicon Valley is
getting involved.

So many valley companies, ven
ture capitalists and entrepreneurs
are rushing into the burgeoning solar
industry that it's inviting compar
isons to the early expansion of the
microchip industry more than two
decades ago.
"If there's anywhere in the world
that can push the envelope on solar,
it might very well be Silicon Valley,"
said Clean Fdge co-founder Ron
Pernick. "Silicon Valley is very well
positioned to provide a lot of innova
tion in solar."
ITiis month. Applied Materials
Inc., a Santa Clara company that
makes manufacturing equipment for
microchips and flat-panel monitors,
announced plans to sell tools for
making solar cells. The company
projects the market for such equip
ment would triple to $3 billion over
the next four years.
The company's semiconductor
equipment can be retooled to make
silicon solar wafers, while its technol
ogy for Hat-panel displays can be ap
plied to "thin film" solar cells
sprayed onto glass and other flat sur
faces.
"By lowering the cost and in
creasing the volumes, we think that
solar power will become much more
affordable in more places in the
world." said Chief Technology Offi
cer Mark Pinto.
Cypress Semiconductor Corp. of
San Jose was one of the first Silicon
Valley chipmakers to cross over into
the solar sector.
Four years ago, Cypress founder
T.J. Rodgers persuaded his board to
buy a majority stake in solar cell
maker Sun Power Corp., founded by
his former Stanford Universi
ty classmate Richard Swanson.
Rodgers argued that Cypress' manu
facturing technology could be used
to reduce costs and expand produc
tion of Sun Power's cells.
Cypress' investment is paying off.
Sun Power raised $146 million when
it went public last year, making it one
of last year's most successful initial
public offerings. Revenue has in
creased from about $10 million in
2004 to a projected $230 million in
2006, said Sun Power Chief Executive
Officer Tom Werner.
"The semiconductor and solar in
dustries are very similar," Werner
said. "It's just that the solar industry
hasn't gotten to the same scale as the
semiconductor industry."
Solar's expansion in Silicon Valley
won't necessarily create lots of man
ufacturing jobs in the San Francisco
Bay Area. Like the microchip indus
try, the solar sector is moving produc
tion offshore to low-cost countries,
mostly in Asia.
