# THE
						TURNAROUND
## Twelve names every fan needs to know 
### 
For the benefit of new arrivals to
campus (and as a refresher to
others), here are some names
that every Stanford fan should be
aware of. In no particular order:
John Arrillaga: Bay Area construc
tion magnate who helped plan and
bankroll the new stadium. The for
mer Stanford basketball player
(Class of 1960) has contributed un
told sums to the school for athletic fa
cilities. The main athletic center is
named for him.
Tara VanDerveer: The women's
hoops coach has notched two nation
al titles in the process of building one
of the most consistently successful
programs in women's college basket
ball. This year's team has National
Championship material stamped all
over it, so don't miss out.
Mark Marquess: A Stanford player
before he became the baseball coach.
Marquess has a long and distin
guished history of winning and sever
al notable players who have made it
in the big leagues.
Trent Edwards: Fifth-year senior
quarterback. Local product, from
Los Gatos High. Widely regarded as
one of the most skilled quarterbacks
in the Pac-10, he has been unable to
avoid injury the past three seasons.
He is the face of Stanford football
and is known for being an even better
man than he is a player.
Trent Johnson: The men's basketball
coach was put in a tough position fol
lowing Mike Montgomery's highly
successful tenure. Johnson struggled
with the rise of new Pac-10 powers as
well as implementing his schemes
with players recruited for Mont
gomery's game strategy. Known as a
tireless recruiter and recommended
by players who were here when he
was an assistant.
KZSU 90.1 FM: Stanford's campus
radio station, which covers a lot of
Stanford sports. The only place to lis
ten to volleyball, baseball, women's
basketball, softball and soccer, and
also covers football and men's hoop ,

Ted Leland: Athletic director for 14
years before stepping down last year,
Leland's time on the Farm boasts 12
Sears Director's Cups for the best all
around athletic program. However,

he was criticized for football program
shortcomings and for the question
able hire of Buddy Teevens (see
below.)
Buddy Teevens: Hired as football
coach in 2(M)2, Teevens — who had
been the coach at Dartmouth when
Leland was there in the early 90's —
was tapped to replace Tyrone Will
ingham who left for Notre Dame.
"Buddy Ball" was a complete failure,
with a 10-23 record. Lowlights includ
ed never winning a game in Novem
ber and losing to Notre Dame 57-7 at
home in 2003.
Walt Harris: Known as a quarterback
guru. 1 larris is in his second season as
head football coach. Last year the
Cardinal struggled against a very
tough schedule, finishing 5-6 and
missing a bowl game by one win.
Road wins over Navy, Washington
State and Arizona kept the fans faith
ful: disappointments included blow
ing a 21-point lead in a loss to UCLA
and the infamous Davis debacle.
John Dunning: The volleyball coach
heads a perennial power in his highly
talented "Bombers of Autumn." Two
national titles (2001, 2004) to his
credit.
Boh Bowlshy: The former lowa ath
letic director took office as Stanford
Athletics Director this July. Highly
respected among his peers, his hire
was viewed as a major coup by pun
dits.
UC-Davis:The Aggies from the Cen
tral Valley were a thorn in the Cardi
nal's side. Making the transition from
Division II to Division 1-AA. Davis
defeated the Cardinal last year in
football, basketball and baseball.The
embarrassing 20-17 football loss cost
the Cardinal a trip to a bowl game.
