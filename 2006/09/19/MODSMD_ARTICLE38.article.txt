## Navy spoils opening of the new Stanford Stadium 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
The good news for Stanford faithful: the brand
new football stadium is beautiful and basketball
season is only two months away.
The bad: the product on the field needs a lot of
work. Saturday night, Stanford opened up the
new football stadium in front of an excited crowd
of 44.022 with a disappointing 37-9 drubbing at
the hands of Navy.

"Obviously we all feel terrible that [this is how
we opened the stadium]." Coach Walt Harris
said." We have such a great venue that we have an
opportunity to play in. We have a lot of work and
improvement to do."
Perhaps most overmatched was Stanford's
young defensive front seven, which made fans
question whether Navy sported a rushing attack
that better resembled 1994 Nebraska or 1979
USC. Hie same Navy squad that squeaked past
D-IAA Massachusetts by one point and East
Carolina by five the past two weeks looked in
control from start to finish against the Card.
And with a ground-based option attack that
entered the game fourth nationally in rushing.
Navy's intent to pound the ball into the heart of
the Stanford defense was clear. Yet Stanford
proved powerless defensively, as Navy racked up
368 yards on 112t 1 ) carries, including a career-best
121 yards on 26 carries by fullback Adam Ballard.
Ouarterback Brian Hampton and slotback Reg
gie Campbell each rushed for two touchdowns.
"We had some good things done on defense
tonight." Harris said. "But they are a very good
rushing team and we weren't able to pursue their
guys like we should have. They're a tough team
that's why they were fourth in the nation rushing
coming into the game. Watch them all year.
They'll be a good team."
Stanford's rush defense has now yielded an in
credible 1.008 yards over its first three contests,
76 more than the next-worst team in the country.
Not surprisingly, opponents have scored 48,
35. and now 37 points against the Card.
But the bigger shock was that offense also
struggled mightily, as it has for five of its six
halves this season. With 10 of 11 of last year's
starters returning and an All-Conference candi
date in senior quarterback Trent Edwards, the
optimistic thought was that the unit could be
among the best in the conference.
Instead. Edwards had arguably the worst half
of his Stanford career, repeatedly throwing high
throughout the first two quarters en route to an
0-for-5 stait and a second-quarter red zone inter
ception. Ihough he would end the game with a
respectable stat line — 23-of-35 for 226 yards
and an interception — much of that yardage

came with the game out of reach, and Edwards
made no bones about his play.
"During the first few series. I missed a couple
of throws here and there and we had a few
dropped balls," Edwards said. "That's all part of
the game. What we have to do is convert on third
down as and keep our defense off the field. Un
fortunately we turned the ball over and that al
lowed Navy to stay out on the field."
Amazingly, despite all of the offensive strug
gles, the Cardinal trailed by just one score at half
time. 10-3. But on the opening kick off of the sec
ond half, the Midshipmen took the ball out to the
Stanford 41-yard line and scored on the ensuing
possession. From that point forward. Navy was in
control.
Throughout the evening, the Cardinal failed
to execute the basics. The defense missed dozens
upon dozens of tackles, the kickoff return team
lost two fumbles, Edwards was lucky to escape
with just one interception, and sophomore kicker
Aaron Zagory hooked an extra point wide left.
"As long as we continue to turn the ball over,
we guarantee that we have no chance to be suc
cessful." 1 larrissaid."We need to take care of the
football, and when we do that, it will give us a
chance to win a football game."

121 yards on 26 carries by fullback Adam Ballard.
Ouarterback Brian Hampton and slotback Reg
gie Campbell each rushed for two touchdowns.
"We had some good things done on defense
tonight." Harris said. "But they are a very good
rushing team and we weren't able to pursue their
guys like we should have. They're a tough team
that's why they were fourth in the nation rushing
coming into the game. Watch them all year.
They'll be a good team."
Stanford's rush defense has now yielded an in
credible 1.008 yards over its first three contests,
76 more than the next-worst team in the country.
Not surprisingly, opponents have scored 48,
35. and now 37 points against the Card.
But the bigger shock was that offense also
struggled mightily, as it has for five of its six
halves this season. With 10 of 11 of last year's
starters returning and an All-Conference candi
date in senior quarterback Trent Edwards, the
optimistic thought was that the unit could be
among the best in the conference.
Instead. Edwards had arguably the worst half
of his Stanford career, repeatedly throwing high
throughout the first two quarters en route to an
0-for-5 stait and a second-quarter red zone inter
ception. Ihough he would end the game with a
respectable stat line — 23-of-35 for 226 yards
and an interception — much of that yardage

came with the game out of reach, and Edwards
made no bones about his play.
"During the first few series. I missed a couple
of throws here and there and we had a few
dropped balls," Edwards said. "That's all part of
the game. What we have to do is convert on third
down as and keep our defense off the field. Un
fortunately we turned the ball over and that al
lowed Navy to stay out on the field."
Amazingly, despite all of the offensive strug
gles, the Cardinal trailed by just one score at half
time. 10-3. But on the opening kick off of the sec
ond half, the Midshipmen took the ball out to the
Stanford 41-yard line and scored on the ensuing
possession. From that point forward. Navy was in
control.
Throughout the evening, the Cardinal failed
to execute the basics. The defense missed dozens
upon dozens of tackles, the kickoff return team
lost two fumbles, Edwards was lucky to escape
with just one interception, and sophomore kicker
Aaron Zagory hooked an extra point wide left.
"As long as we continue to turn the ball over,
we guarantee that we have no chance to be suc
cessful." 1 larrissaid."We need to take care of the
football, and when we do that, it will give us a
chance to win a football game."

The Bottom Line: The team is battling injuries
and has already put themselves in a big hole
with three early losses. It could be a long sea
son at the new Stanford Stadium.
Harris did not escape scrutiny either. In the

"1 didn't want to head into the
locker room with nothing on the
board," Harris said. "We're pretty

young and we haven't had a whole

positives to happen. With the
amount of time that we had left I
thought that was the best way to go.
And it got a little momentum on our
