# Pair of road losses to open 2006 campaign
## Stanford 10 Oregon 48 Duck ground game carries Oregon to blowout win 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON STAFF WRITER 
EUGHNE, ()regon — Jonathan Stewart and Jere
miah Johnson combined for 24 l > yards on the
ground as the Oregon Ducks opened the season
with a 4X-10 victory over the Stanford Cardinal.
Stanford (0-1,, 0-1 Pac-10) appeared to recover a
Duck fumble on the first play from scrimmage, but
the turnover was reversed upon video review. From
that point on, Oregon's up-tempo attack struck
early and often. Quarterback Dennis Dixon com
pleted 21 of 30 passes for 23ft yards and a touch
down as the Ducks rolled up 534 yards in total of
fense and 29S yards on the ground.
Stanford was paced by Trent Edwards' 224 yards
on 20-for-24 passing, but rushed for only KM) yards
and converted 3 of 14 third downs. One bright spot
was Stanford's lack of penalties — the Cardinal
were flagged only five times to Oregon's nine. Stan
lord led the conference in fewest penalty yards last
season.
Stanford's only visit to the end zone came in the
second quarter. Facing Ist and 10 from the Oregon
2ft. Mark Bradford broke free behind the second
ary. Edwards laid the ball in his hands for the touch
down, completing an 82-yard drive. Bradford later
called the game a "humbling experience" against
what is likely to be one of the top teams in the con
ference. Last year's Duck squad went 10-2, losing
only to USC and to Oklahoma in the Holiday Bowl.
Stanford also struggled with problems in the
kicking game, a reliable plus for last year's team.
New placekicker Aaron Zagory was 1 -for-3 on field
goals, with his last attempt being blocked and re
turned for the Ducks' final touchdown.
The game was notable for the contributions of
several Cardinal true freshmen. Receivers Richard
Sherman and Austin Yancy made their first appear
ances, and Toby Gerhart's 55 yards on Ift carries
showed the skill that made him California's all-time
leading rusher in high school. On defense, Sione
I ua.Levirt Griffin and Brian Bulcke appeared late
in the game. At least some of those players will have
to become key contributors as Stanford hopes to
get to its first bowl game since the 2001 season.
