# Band falls silent
## Absence at football loss disastrous, but Band Run is on 
### JENNY ALLEN DAVID HERBERT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Midway through the fourth quarter of Saturday's game, a
cry arose from the student section. "This is our house,this is our
house," the crowd chanted louder and louder. It was a memo
rable moment for the opening of the new Stanford Stadium, or
it would have been, that is, if it had come from Stanford's stu
dent section.
Fhe Band, placed on indefinite provisional status last week,
was not on the field during the Cardinal's 37-9 drubbing at the
hands of the Midshipmen, with predictable results: as the game
began to turn in Navy's favor, the Card might as well have been
playing in Annapolis. A few Bandies were in attendance,
dressed in street clothes but still donning their pin-encrusted
"lids," and The Tree, co-terminal student Tommy Leep, was
flashed on the Jumbotron. But with an on-going investigation
into mid-summer vandalism of the Band Shak, the irreverent
brass and drums fell silent.
And so did the crowd.
"What's the point?" asked senior John Collins as he stood
up from his seat two minutes into the second quarter and qui

etly left the stadium.
The rest of the Red Zone seemed to agree. The student sec
tion never got into the game, unimpressed with Cardinal Com
petitive Cheer's pleas for noise and the faint sound of "All
Right Now" being piped in over loudspeaker.
By the time Navy was piling it on in the third quarter, stu
dents were recycling the poster board provided for the half
time card stunt to construct paper airplanes.The biggest cheers
after halftime were for the planes that floated from the upper
deck and onto the field.
"It could be a very quiet season if The Band stays suspend
ed," said senior Jarret Guajardo.
The Band is in limbo after the University announced last
Thursday that the group is on indefinite provisional status and
will be led by an interim director. And while the Band Run will
go on as planned Wednesday, it is unlikely that the group will
be present for the critical Washington State showdown this
Saturday, according to officials close to the situation.The deci
sion to put The Band on probation was based in part on a Uni
versity report completed on Sept. 13, which determined that
