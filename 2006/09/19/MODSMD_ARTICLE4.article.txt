# Band falls silent
## Absence at football loss disastrous, but Band Run is on 
### JENNY ALLEN DAVID HERBERT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Midway through the fourth quarter of Saturday's game, a
cry arose from the student section. "This is our house,this is our
house," the crowd chanted louder and louder. It was a memo
rable moment for the opening of the new Stanford Stadium, or
it would have been, that is, if it had come from Stanford's stu
dent section.
Fhe Band, placed on indefinite provisional status last week,
was not on the field during the Cardinal's 37-9 drubbing at the
hands of the Midshipmen, with predictable results: as the game
began to turn in Navy's favor, the Card might as well have been
playing in Annapolis. A few Bandies were in attendance,
dressed in street clothes but still donning their pin-encrusted
"lids," and The Tree, co-terminal student Tommy Leep, was
flashed on the Jumbotron. But with an on-going investigation
into mid-summer vandalism of the Band Shak, the irreverent
brass and drums fell silent.
And so did the crowd.
"What's the point?" asked senior John Collins as he stood
up from his seat two minutes into the second quarter and qui

etly left the stadium.
The rest of the Red Zone seemed to agree. The student sec
tion never got into the game, unimpressed with Cardinal Com
petitive Cheer's pleas for noise and the faint sound of "All
Right Now" being piped in over loudspeaker.
By the time Navy was piling it on in the third quarter, stu
dents were recycling the poster board provided for the half
time card stunt to construct paper airplanes.The biggest cheers
after halftime were for the planes that floated from the upper
deck and onto the field.
"It could be a very quiet season if The Band stays suspend
ed," said senior Jarret Guajardo.
The Band is in limbo after the University announced last
Thursday that the group is on indefinite provisional status and
will be led by an interim director. And while the Band Run will
go on as planned Wednesday, it is unlikely that the group will
be present for the critical Washington State showdown this
Saturday, according to officials close to the situation.The deci
sion to put The Band on probation was based in part on a Uni
versity report completed on Sept. 13, which determined that

several members had intentionally vandal
ized the Band Shak, a leased modular near
Encina Hall and the Serra Complex, on the
evening of July 17.
"Given the seriousness of the Band Shak
incident,compounded by the recurring prob
lems with the Band, I am lifting the current
interim suspension [since July 18] and plac
ing the Band on indefinite provisional status
while the University determines the condi
tions under which the privileges of The Band
will be fully reinstated," said Vice Provost of
Student Affairs Greg Boardman.
The University defines indefinite provi
sional status as meaning that (1) the Band
will not be performing at this weekend's
Stanford Stadium grand opening or any
other athletic event through at least the end
of September; (2) all students involved in the
vandalism will be suspended from Band
membership; (3) the Band may not travel for
at least one year; (4) the Band's alcohol sus
pension will be extended indefinitely;and (5)
the Band will be required to pay the full cost
of the damages to the Band Shak. estimated
to be between $3(),(X)() and $50,(HX).
Associate Dean of Students Chris Grif
fith will be responsible for approving the
Stanford Band's participation in any Univer
sity and non-University events. Griffith and
Boardman have agreed to allow the Stanford
Band to hold its traditional Band Run during
early fall quarter.
"The indefinite provisional status pro
vides the time to address a number of organi
zational deficiencies within the band, to es
tablish a partnership between Band leader
ship and the University, and to give the Band
an opportunity to demonstrate its commit
ment to address our concerns," Griffith said.
"Until we've had sufficient time to make
progress on these goals, a full performance
schedule will not be implemented.The Band
Run is a tradition, the welcoming of incom
ing freshmen on their first night at Stanford,
and there was strong support to allow that
tradition to continue."
As interim director. Griffith hopes to help
establish an organizational model for the
Stanford Band that "promotes responsibility
and accountability while retaining the cre
ativity that is uniquely Stanford."
"I think it is important to instill the notion
of stewardship — that the care of the organ-

'The University
wants to move
forward with
the Band.'

ization by this generation of band members
will ensure that the traditions continue be
yond their tenure," Griffith continued.
Student organization misconduct is typi
cally reviewed by the Organization Conduct
Board (OCB) with recommendations made
to the Dean of Students for administrative
action, according to Boardman,
"Given that the Band has appeared be
fore the OCB multiple times, and given that
serious Band misconduct continues, I have
decided not to refer the Band Shak incident
to the OCB," Boardman said. "This decision
is in keeping with the OCB protocol that pro
vides for an alternate process for review and
resolution."
This alternative process includes not only
Griffith as interim director, but also the cre
ation of a Band Reinstatement Committee
that is charged with developing criteria for
the Stanford Band's full reinstatement.
"At a minimum the Band Reinstatement
Committee's criteria will include developing
policies to (1) ensure compliance with Uni
versity policies, law. and respect for persons
and property, (2) develop an effective organ
ization and leadership model, and (3) create
a strong working partnership between Band

leadership and the University." Boardman
said. " Hie overriding principle in this effort is
to preserve the spirit and creativity of a scat
ter band while achieving these goals. Inher
ent in membership in any organization is the
acceptance of both the privileges afforded its
members as well as the consequences for ac
tions that violate the University's standards

of conduct."
Boardman's decision was not based sole
ly on the recent vandalism, which he noted
included damage from sledgehammers and
food against the walls as well as destroyed
music equipment. The indefinite provisional
status is also a response to a history of mis
conduct by the Stanford Band; since 2003,

nine conduct complaints have been filed with
the ()ffice of Student Affairs.
"I think our focus now should he on talk
ing about the future." Boardman continued.
" Hie University wants to move forward with
the Band to determine under what condi
tions that the Band can be reinstated."

"Until we've had sufficient time to make

Run is a tradition, the welcoming of incom
ing freshmen on their first night at Stanford,

tradition to continue."
As interim director. Griffith hopes to help
establish an organizational model for the
Stanford Band that "promotes responsibility
and accountability while retaining the cre

will ensure that the traditions continue be
yond their tenure," Griffith continued.
Student organization misconduct is typi
cally reviewed by the Organization Conduct
Board (OCB) with recommendations made
to the Dean of Students for administrative
action, according to Boardman,
"Given that the Band has appeared be
fore the OCB multiple times, and given that
serious Band misconduct continues, I have
decided not to refer the Band Shak incident
to the OCB," Boardman said. "This decision
is in keeping with the OCB protocol that pro
vides for an alternate process for review and
resolution."
This alternative process includes not only
Griffith as interim director, but also the cre
ation of a Band Reinstatement Committee
that is charged with developing criteria for
the Stanford Band's full reinstatement.
"At a minimum the Band Reinstatement
Committee's criteria will include developing
policies to (1) ensure compliance with Uni
versity policies, law. and respect for persons
and property, (2) develop an effective organ
ization and leadership model, and (3) create
a strong working partnership between Band

leadership and the University." Boardman
said. " Hie overriding principle in this effort is
to preserve the spirit and creativity of a scat
ter band while achieving these goals. Inher
ent in membership in any organization is the
acceptance of both the privileges afforded its
members as well as the consequences for ac
tions that violate the University's standards

of conduct."
Boardman's decision was not based sole
ly on the recent vandalism, which he noted
included damage from sledgehammers and
food against the walls as well as destroyed
music equipment. The indefinite provisional
status is also a response to a history of mis
conduct by the Stanford Band; since 2003,

nine conduct complaints have been filed with
the ()ffice of Student Affairs.
"I think our focus now should he on talk
ing about the future." Boardman continued.
" Hie University wants to move forward with
the Band to determine under what condi
tions that the Band can be reinstated."

Cardinal Competitive Cheer tries to get the Red Zone into the game during a break in the action. The student section never made an impact
in the game, however, and many fans resorted to launching paper airplanes off the upper deck to relieve their boredom.
Midway through the fourth quarter of Saturday's game, a
cry arose from the student section. "This is our house,this is our
house," the crowd chanted louder and louder. It was a memo
rable moment for the opening of the new Stanford Stadium, or
it would have been, that is, if it had come from Stanford's stu
dent section.
Fhe Band, placed on indefinite provisional status last week,
was not on the field during the Cardinal's 37-9 drubbing at the
hands of the Midshipmen, with predictable results: as the game
began to turn in Navy's favor, the Card might as well have been
playing in Annapolis. A few Bandies were in attendance,
dressed in street clothes but still donning their pin-encrusted
"lids," and The Tree, co-terminal student Tommy Leep, was
flashed on the Jumbotron. But with an on-going investigation
into mid-summer vandalism of the Band Shak, the irreverent
brass and drums fell silent.
And so did the crowd.
"What's the point?" asked senior John Collins as he stood
up from his seat two minutes into the second quarter and qui

etly left the stadium.
The rest of the Red Zone seemed to agree. The student sec
tion never got into the game, unimpressed with Cardinal Com
petitive Cheer's pleas for noise and the faint sound of "All
Right Now" being piped in over loudspeaker.
By the time Navy was piling it on in the third quarter, stu
dents were recycling the poster board provided for the half
time card stunt to construct paper airplanes.The biggest cheers
after halftime were for the planes that floated from the upper
deck and onto the field.
"It could be a very quiet season if The Band stays suspend
ed," said senior Jarret Guajardo.
The Band is in limbo after the University announced last
Thursday that the group is on indefinite provisional status and
will be led by an interim director. And while the Band Run will
go on as planned Wednesday, it is unlikely that the group will
be present for the critical Washington State showdown this
Saturday, according to officials close to the situation.The deci
sion to put The Band on probation was based in part on a Uni
versity report completed on Sept. 13, which determined that

several members had intentionally vandal
ized the Band Shak, a leased modular near
Encina Hall and the Serra Complex, on the
evening of July 17.
"Given the seriousness of the Band Shak
incident,compounded by the recurring prob
lems with the Band, I am lifting the current
interim suspension [since July 18] and plac
ing the Band on indefinite provisional status
while the University determines the condi
tions under which the privileges of The Band
will be fully reinstated," said Vice Provost of
Student Affairs Greg Boardman.
The University defines indefinite provi
sional status as meaning that (1) the Band
will not be performing at this weekend's
Stanford Stadium grand opening or any
other athletic event through at least the end
of September; (2) all students involved in the
vandalism will be suspended from Band
membership; (3) the Band may not travel for
at least one year; (4) the Band's alcohol sus
pension will be extended indefinitely;and (5)
the Band will be required to pay the full cost
of the damages to the Band Shak. estimated
to be between $3(),(X)() and $50,(HX).
Associate Dean of Students Chris Grif
fith will be responsible for approving the
Stanford Band's participation in any Univer
sity and non-University events. Griffith and
Boardman have agreed to allow the Stanford
Band to hold its traditional Band Run during
early fall quarter.
"The indefinite provisional status pro
vides the time to address a number of organi
zational deficiencies within the band, to es
tablish a partnership between Band leader
ship and the University, and to give the Band
an opportunity to demonstrate its commit
ment to address our concerns," Griffith said.
