SAN JOSE, California — With a twenty-point sec
ond-quarter lead over San Jose State, Stanford
looked to he washing out the had taste of last
week's loss to Oregon. But the Spartans scored 21
unanswered points and forced a turnover on Stan
ford's last drive for a 35-34 victory at Spartan Stadi
um.
Yonus Davis rushed for IN4 yards and Adam
lafralis threw for 1 10 yards on 14 for 16 passing as
the Spartans (1-1, ()-() Western Athletic Confer
ence) prohed Stanford's poor defensive depth and
tackling, and shut out the offensive attack for the
last two periods. The scoreless second half for Stan
lord (0-2,0-1 Pac-10) spoiled an impressive after

noon by I rent Edwards — 18-for-28 passing for 233
yards and four touchdowns — and breakout games
by freshmen Toby Gerhart (<S2 rushing yards) and
Richard Sherman (h receptions for 71 yards and
one touchdown.)
With the clock winding down. Stanford looked
to march down the field for a game-winning score.
But after Trent Edwards completed a pass to Evan
Moore over the middle at the San Jose State 42. two
Spartan players stripped the ball and a third recov
ered the fumble. Hie play was reviewed by the offi
cials and the ruling stood. One play later Patrick
Perry busted up the middle for a 15-yard gain, and
Spartans ran out the last 1:2() on the clock. Spartan
fans Hooded the field along with jubilant players.
The game was scheduled to be the first game in
the new Stanford Stadium, but the contest was
moved due to concerns the stadium would not be
ready in time. Instead, 29,321 packed the house for
San Jose State's biggest victory since it beat then
undefeated TCU in 20(H).
The Spartans dug themselves a hole with three
first-half turnovers. After forcing Stanford to punt
on their second offensive series, Dwight Lowery
muffed the kick and Stanford recovered at the 17-
yard line. Sherman went over the middle and
caught his first career touchdown on the next play.
Following the score, a substitution problem re
sulted in ;i delay-of-game penalty, moving the Car
dinal back five yards. Aaron Zagory's extra-point
attempt went wide left; the missing point would end
up haunting Stanford by game's end.
On the ensuing kickoff,confusion resulted in the
Spartans not fielding the kick. Stanford recovered
the live ball, setting up Edwards' fourth-down
touchdown pass to Evan Moore.
An interception later led to a 1 -yard run by full
back Nick Frank, and second-quarter touchdown
passes to tight end James Dray and Moore rounded
out the scoring as Stanford built a 34-14 lead.
ITie Cardinal sealed their fate with their own
second-half miscues. After back-to-back touch
downs had cut the lead to six. tailback Anthony
Kimble coughed up the football on a screen pass at

the Spartan 27. San Jose State took just two plays to
score. Davis ripped the defense for a 31-yard gain,
and then receiver James Jones took a reverse-ac
tion pitch a spectacular 42 yards for the go-head
score, faking out three Stanford defenders, revers
ing field and riding a block from Tafralis the final 20
yards to the end zone. In a dubious distinction, the
thrilling run was rated the Top Play on ESPN's
Sports Center.
Facing third-and-goal at the 10 yard line on the
following drive, Edwards threw to Moore in the
back of the end zone. Lowery atoned for his muff by
stepping in front of the low and late pass for an in
terception. killing the Cardinal's best chance at a
second-half score.
San Jose State had given up 300 rushing yards in
the previous week's 35-29 loss at Washington, but
this week it was the Spartans' turn as they gashed
the Stanford defense for 342 yards on the ground.
Shotgun-option plays to the left side flummoxed
linebacker Clinton Snyder and cornerback
Wopamo Osaisai, while power dives and zone plays
by Davis and Perry punched at the core of the de
fense. San Jose State's highly multiple offense also
saw single-wing formations, receiver sweeps and a
deep pass to Jones that gave the Spartans a first and
goal at the six.
Spartans coach Dick Tomey raised his career
record against Stanford to 10-2. the first eleven of
those games as head coach at Arizona. Edwards
praised the Spartans' effort after the game, saying
"I have a lot of respect for San Jose State and their
coaching staff and players, and I think the better
team won today."
In a season where four Division I-A teams have
lost to Division I-AA opponents, the upset brought
back bitter memories of last season's 20-17 home
loss to I-AA UC-Davis. In that game, the offense
was held to 3 points as the Aggies outgained the
Cardinal by a 2-to-l margin. UC-Davis scored the
game-winning touchdown with eight seconds re
maining. one play after Nick Sanchez's would-be
game-ending interception was incorrectly ruled in
complete.
