# Long list of starters lost to injury, again
## Frank, Bradford out for season many others missing time 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
Over the last few seasons, injuries and Stanford
football seemed to be joined at the dislocated hip.
Last season, the Cardinal lost starting wide re
ceiver Evan Moore for his entire junior season after
a hip injury suffered in the opening game against
Navy,center Brian 1 lead was forced to retire due to
health concerns and various ailments hampered the
linebacking corps.
Amazingly, this season, things have been even
worse. Over the first three weeks of the 200b cam
paign. the ( ard have been decimated by injuries.
Last week, Nick Frank, Stanford's starting full
back last season, was diagnosed with a cervical
spine condition that ended his football career.
I rank experienced numbness down his arms during
the San Jose State game on Sept. 9, and after a bat
tery of tests. Stanford medical personnel advised
him to retire immediately.
I rank experienced neurological symptoms over
the past two seasons, but initially doctors could not
discover the source. When symptoms peaked last
week, doctors determined that Frank was suffering
from a narrowing of the vertebrae in his neck.
"[Retirement] is a decision that I came to with
the training staff," said Frank, who rushed for three
yards and a touchdown in two games this season."!
look at is as an extremely unfortunate occurrence.
It is in the best interest of my long-term health to
stop playing.
"It is particularly disappointing since it was so
unexpected. That makes it much harder to deal
with. This is something that is bigger than football."
The Cardinal will also likely be without starting
wide receiver Mark Bradford for the remainder of
the 2006 season. Bradford damaged a ligament in
his foot against San Jose State last Saturday after
making only one three yard reception in the game.
Bradford was expected to be a big part of the
Stanford offense in his senior season. Last year, as
the number one receiving option, the 6-foot-2,210
pound wide out reeled in 609 yards and six touch

downs.
"[Bradford's injury] is very unfortunate for
Stanford football and, of course, for Mark," Stan
lord head coach Walt I larris said in a press confer
ence last week. 11e is in a cast and the doctors think
that it will heal, hut they can't guarantee it.
Ilns is part of the adversity that every football
team goes through. We have to make the best of it."
Bradford is not the only wide receiver to battle
injuries this season. Moore was held out of most of

this week's Navy game after injuring his foot. The
severity of the problem is not yet known. The Car
dinal were left without their top two receivers for
nearly all of the 37-9 loss.
Senior linebackers Michael Okwo and Mike
Silva and senior center Tim Mattran have also
missed time this season due to injuries. Junior of
fensive lineman Alex Fletcher was helped off the
field after suffering an injury in the second half of
the Navy game.

Senior fullback Nick Frank was forced to retire from football last week due to a cervical spine condition that
has hampered him over the last two seasons. Frank is just one of a number of players to go down to injuries.
