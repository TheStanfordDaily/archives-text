# PAC-10 FOOTBALL PREVIEW
## No easy roads to the top of Pac-10 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
1. use (2-0):

The Trojans are once again the team to beat in the
Pac-10. They may have lost a pair of Heisman Trophy
winners and a number ol key defensive starters, but
USC has shown in two impressive wins this season
that the new erop can challenge for a national title.
Oregon. Cal and Notre Dame are on the schedule in
consecutive weeks, but all three are at the Coliseum.

If the Trojans can escape those challenges, USC will vie for their
third consecutive national championship.
2. Oregon (3-0,1-0 Pac-10):

The Ducks got some late help from the referees in
their win over No. 15 Oklahoma last Saturday, but
that doesn't change the fact that the Ducks look very
tough. RB Jonathan Stewart and OB Denis Dixon
have become one of the most dangerous backfields in

the conference. If their defense can hold up their end of the bargain,
the Ducks could find themselves as an at-large BCS selection.
3. California (2-1):

After a humiliating week one loss to Tennessee, the
Bears bounced back to crush Minnesota and Port
land State. RB Marshawn Lynch is the real deal, al
though probably not a real Heisman Trophy con
tender. QB is still an issue for Cal-Nate Longshore
has looked shakv at times but going to Joe Ayoob is

a scary proposition. Despite those concerns, the Bears are still a
top-tier Pac-10 team.
4. Arizona State (3-0):

The Sun Devils are widely considered to be a notch
below the top three Pac-10 teams, but they could turn
out to be one of the biggest surprises. After some
major controversy. QB Rudv Carpenter has settled
down in his starting role and could be one of the best
throwers in the conference. The Sun Devils schedule
is tough, with Cal. Oregon and USC in the next three
weeks. With those early tests, ASU will know where

they stand by the middle of October.
5. UCLA (2-0):

The Bruins lost their starting QB and RB from
last year's Sun Bowl team, putting a lot of
pressure on BYU-transfer OB Ben Olson. He
| looked sharp in two games, throwing for 442
'yards and fiveTDs, hut that was against Utah
and Rice. Expect to see UCLA in another
bowl in 2006, but it will be another year look-

ing up at LAs other team.
6. Washington (2-1):

Hie Huskies will be the big surprise this sea
son and will qualify for a bowl for the first time
since the 2001 season. Washington was im
pressive in their win over Fresno State last
week and stayed competitive against Okla
homa in Norman. Tyrone Willingham has
coached OB Isaiah Stanbaek i.im n servicea-

ble Pac-10 starter, and he will guide the Dawgs to four Pac-10 wins.
7. Arizona (2-1):

It took a late charge from the Wildcats to finish
off Steven F. Austin last week, but they played
much of that game without their starting 08.
Willie Ttiitama. Arizona has been on the verge of
making a breakthrough over the past few sea
sons under head coach Mike Stoops, and this
won t be the vear either TTipv will win in«t «n<»

game outside of IYicson and lall short of a bowl for the eighth
straight season.
8. Washington State (2-1):

The ( ougars got crushed by Auburn opening
weekend, but recovered with wins over Idaho and
Baylor. OB Alex Brink played in 18 games enter
ing his junior season and has the experience to
carry the team through some tough spots. They get
USC, ( aland Oregon all in Pullman and may be
able to pull off the upset in one of those three

I lie oeavers were embarrassed on the blue field in
Boise, losing to Boise State 42-14. The Beavers re
turn a solid offensive line, but that won't be
enough to overcome OB Sean Canfield's inexpe

drop all tour and finish towards the bottom of the Pac-10.
10. Stanford (0-3):

Ihe ( ardinal have looked outmatched in each of their
lirst three games. Ihe San Jose State game was certainly
winnable. but a slew of second-half mistakes doomed the
Card. Stanford was prone to turn the ball over in the open
ing weeks, something the Cardinal were able to avoid in
last year s surprise five-win campaign. QB lYent Edwards

taken away his key weapons. True-freshman RB Toby Gerhart has
shown flashes of brilliance, but he is still voung. On the'bright side for
the Card, the new stadium gives a legitimate home field advantage
