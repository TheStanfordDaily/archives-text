## Volleyball sweeps way to 9-1 preseason No. 7 Cardinal lose just three games entering Pac-10 play, avenge postseason loss to Santa Clara 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
After seeing the 2005 season come to
a disappointingly early end in the NCAA
tournament, the No. 7 women's volley
ball team is back in action and looking as
good as ever.
Although a spate of injuries ham
pered the Cardinal down the stretch last
year, Stanford's players return fit and
healthy this fall, with 12 of the 14 players
on the roster getting on the court in the
preseason. ()nly red-shirt freshman Alex
Fisher, who sat out last season after knee
surgery,and senior middle blocker l.iz/.ie
Suiter have not yet played. Suiter, who
endured ankle and eye injuries as a jun
ior. is now dealing with back trouble.
Stanford (9-1) shook off the memories
of their early exit in December and got
the 2006 season off to a good start with a
home sweep of UC-Santa Barbara, but
was upset in its second match by Brigham
Young. The Cougars took the four-game
win from the Cardinal in Utah and went
from being unranked to the No. 16 spot
into the national polls as a result.
Stanford rebounded from the surpris
ing loss to finish the BYU Tournament
with a pair of sweeps over Virginia Com
monwealth and Texas A&Mâ€”Corpus
Christi to improve to 3-1 on the season.
The phenomenal sophomore duo of
middle blocker Foluke Akinradewo and
outside hitter Cynthia Barboza garnered
All-Tournament honors in Utah. Akin
radewo was the Pacific-10 Conference
Freshman of the Year in 2005 and a Sec
ond-Team All-American. She leads the
Cardinal with a .440 hitting percentage
and 43 blocks. Barboza is fully recovered
from the ACL tear that ended her stellar
freshman campaign last October and has
notched a team-high 125 kills in 2006.
Except for the upset in Utah, the Car
dinal rolled through the preseason and
are riding eight straight wins, all three
game sweeps, into conference play. The
Cardinal followed the victories in Utah
with wins against Northwestern and Fair
field at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Chal
lenge. In the marquee match of that tour
nament. Stanford took the tournament
championship with a sweep of then No. 9

Hawaii.
Hawaii had three top players on the
bench for most of the match with injuries,
including its three-time Ail-American
setter, kanoe Kamana o, and Stanford
handed the Rainbow Wahine their most
lopsided loss since the rally scoring sys
tem was adopted, winning the first game
30-10. The next two were more competi
tive, but the Cardinal still managed the
sweep - 30-10.30-22,30-24.
Barboza was named the Most Out
standing Player of the tournament and
Pac-10 Player of the Week for her out
standing hitting through the weekend.
She tallied 46 kills through three matches
with only two hitting errors and her four
aces against Hawaii were a career high.
Akinradewo joined Barboza on the All-
Tournament team as did senior outside
hitter and All-American Kristin
Richards. Richards is third on the team
with 102 kills and fourth with 84 digs.
The Cardinal rode the high of the vic
tory over Hawaii into Thursday's match
against No. 8 Santa Clara as part of the
Stanford Invitational and came awa\
with yet another sweep. The Broncos
knocked Stanford out of the NCAA
Tournament in the second round last
year in Maples but could not repeat the
upset. Although Stanford had only a sin
gle-point advantage in the national
polling (No. 7 and No. S with 1,101 and
1,100 points, respectively), the three
game win looked easy with a 30-14 score
in the second frame.
Stanford closed out the home tourna
ment with wins over Georgetown and Saint
Marys to finish the preseason with a M-l
record and an eight-match winning streak.
Barboza and junior setter Bryn Kehoe
(11.48 assists per game, 3.26 digs per
game) were named Co-Most Outstand
ing Players of the Stanford Invitational
and Akinradewo was named All-Tourna
ment as well. Richards and Akinradewo
took the day off against the Hoyas, but
the team still won in convincing fashion
without them.
The Cardinal will start the Pac-10 sea
son on the road this Thursday and Friday,
visiting Washington State and No. 3
Washington, the defending national
champions.

nine victories, dropping just three games through the first ten matches.
