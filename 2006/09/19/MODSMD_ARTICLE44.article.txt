## Health, experience key in returning title to the Farm Card trying to earn third National Championship since 2001 after early exit in 2005 WOMEN'S VOLLEY BALL QUICK FACTS 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
Improved health could make the
biggest difference for this season's No. 7
Stanford women's volleyball team, who
look to avenge last year's disappointing
exit in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament.
Junior setter Bryn Kehoe and sopho
more outside hitter Cynthia Barboza both
return after missing critical games down the
stretch during the Cardinal's 2005 campaign.
Kehoe, an All-American last year, injured
her right hand during a practice and missed
the final seven games of the regular season.
Barboza led the Pac-10 Conference in kills
before tearing her ACT. at California
halfway through the season.
Entering his seventh season on The Farm,
head coach John Dunning said both players
have progressed well in their recuperation,
thanks mostly to a tremendous training staff.
So far. Kehoe and Barboza have not
missed a beat. Barboza leads the team in kills
with lift and a .317 hitting percentage.
Kehoe, meanwhile, anchors Stanford's of
fense with 31<S season sets.
"I am lucky the injury happened when it
did." Barboza said. "Thanks to our team's
amazing staff, I was able to recover well be
fore it got more serious."

Coach: John Dunning (6th year)
Current Record: 9-1
Current Rank: No. 7
2005 Record: 26-6
2005 Postseason: Lost to Santa Clara in
2nd Round at Palo Alto Regional
Players to Watch: Sophomore outside
hitter Cynthia Barboza, senior outside
hitter Kristen Richards
The Bottom Line: John Dunning has
won two titles over his tenure as head
coach. Another championship is not out
of the question for this year's squad.
again with a .429 average. Adding to the of
fensive effort is fellow All-American Kristin
Richards, who led the team in kills with 544
last season.
Sophomore Jessica Fishburn leads the
Cardinal defense with 107 digs. Fellow soph
omore Alex Fisher will play for the first time
this season after having redshirted last year.
Senior outside hitter Nji Nnamani and senior
middle blockers Michelle Mellard and Lizzie
Suiter each saw significant playing time last
season and are expected to contribute to the
Cardinal's 2006 campaign. Sophomore Erin

Waller started the final four matches for
Stanford last season.
New additions to this year's squad include
sophomore walk-on Heather Hernandez,
who rowed with the Stanford crew team last
season. Freshmen Joanna Fvans and Janet
Okogbaa have played throughout the pre
season.
"We gained a lot of experience last sea
son." Dunning said. "The team is very moti
vated, and it should provide for some excit
ing volleyball."
Hie Cardinal begin play against the Pac
-10. arguably the nation's toughest confer

ence, this weekend at Washington and Wash
ington State. Stanford easily cruised past
Washington State in the teams' two meetings
last season, while the eventual national
champion Huskies took both matches from
the Cardinal in 2(H)5.
Dunning said another key distinction be
tween this team and last year's squad is im
proved blocking. During the offseason, the
Cardinal plugged the defensive weakness by
completely overhauling their blocking
scheme. Thus far this season. Stanford is col
lecting 3.74 blocks per game, compared to
last year's 2.5 per game average.

The Cardinal also benefited from build
ing team chemistry during their two week
long European tour in June. Hie Cardinal
went 5-1 overseas, dropping a match to the
Croation Junior National team.
Most of all. Stanford will draw from their
experiences last year to avoid a similar fate.
"We learned last season that each team is
going to play their best match against us. so
we can't take anything for granted " Kehoe
said. "Our strong spring practices allowed us
to know each other very well, and we'll be
able to work together to succeed this sea
son."
