# Pac-10 Conference among the best in the nation
## Last five National Champions all out of the Pac-10 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
With a successful preseason behind them. No. 6 Stanford
women's volleyball kicks off conference play in Washington this
weekend.The Cardinal were picked to win the Pacific-1 () Confer
ence title in the preseason coaches' poll, but the path to that title
is rocky.
Six teams from the Pac-I() are ranked in the national polls,
with five in the top 10 (No. 3 UCLA, No. 4 Washington, Stanford,
No. 7 Southern California and No. S California). Here is The
Daily's look at the Card's opponents from the nation's strongest
conference, in the order that Stanford will face them.
Stanford's first Pac-1() match of 2006 is scheduled at Washing
ton State (11-2) on Thursday.The Cougars, who finished ninth in
the conference last year, have started on a hot streak. They won
11 of their first 13. but are yet to face a Top 25 opponent. The 11
wins are already more than the Cougars managed all of last sea
son.
Awaiting the Cardinal on Friday is defending national cham
pion Washington (9-1 ).The I luskies won their first ever title (and
the fifth in a row for the Pac-10) in 2005. Despite losing five sen
iors from that team, Washington lost only once in the preseason,
falling in five games to No. 5 Texas. Senior setter Courtney
Thompson (averaging 14.1 assists per game) leads a young, tal
ented squad out to defend its crown.
Stanford opens its home season against Arizona (9-3). which
notched two wins over the Card last year. Without 2005's star sen
ior Kim Glass, the Wildcats have struggled this year and were
dealt a serious blow with the loss of senior Kristina Baum to in
jury last week. Senior Dominique Lamb has stepped up to lead
the Wildcats' offense with a .404 hitting percentage and its de
fense with 63 blocks.

Arizona State (8-3) has lost only three matches — two of
them five-gamers — this year and swept six opponents in the
preseason. The Sun Devils, who managed only three Pac-10 wins
in 2005, boast one of the top defenders in the conference in libero
Sydney Donahue, niece of Stanford associate head coach Denise
Corlett. Donahue's 50 digs against LMU are the most by any
player in the country this year.
Stanford's cross-bay rivalry with Cal (11-0) has heated up in
past years and should stay hot in 2006. The Bears, led by seniors
Jillian Davis (4.61 digs per game) and Samantha Carter (12.89 as
sists per game), have established themselves as national con
tenders and have won two out of the last three against Stanford
in Berkeley. Cal has not lost a match in 2006 and dropped only
three games in the preseason.
Southern California (11-0) won back-to-back national cham
pionships in 2002 and 2003, but without the twin towers of Emily
Adams and Bibiana Candelas (6-foot-6 and 6-foot-5, respective
ly) the Trojans finished fourth in last year's Pac-10 race. Like the
Bears, USC was undefeated in the preseason with two wins
against ranked opponents.
UCLA (13-0) picked up two first-place votes in the confer
ence poll and is the highest-ranked Pac-10 team heading into
conference play. Senior middle blocker Nana Meriwether was
named conference and national Player of the Week in September
after hitting .875 in the Bruins' vict'orv over No. 5 Florida. Meri
wether is hitting .571 on the season with a team-high 166 kills and
58 blocks.
Oregon State (3-6) finished seventh in the conference last
year, the best of the unranked Pac-10 teams and upset Cal in the
middle of the season. The Beavers started 2006 with a win but
then lost six in a row before they closed out the preseason on a
two-game win-streak.
Oregon (10-0) will try to rebound from a disappointing 2005
season that saw the Ducks finish the conference season with only
one win. With 1 0 straight preseason victories, Oregon has tied the
longest winning streak in school history. Six freshmen have
brought a new energy into the squad and led the way to victory
over No. 17 Long Beach in August.
Despite a conference as strong from top to bottom as it has
ever been, a sixth straight Pac-10 NCAA champion could be just
three months away.
