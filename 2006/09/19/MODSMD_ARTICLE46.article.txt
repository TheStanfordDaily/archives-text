against Cal, but failed to hold onto a two
goal fourth quarter lead in the semi-finals of
the NorCalTournament over the weekend.
The Cardinal defeated UC San Diego on
Friday, handing the Tritons their first loss of
the year. UCSD came out firing, earning a 2-

into the contest.
The teams battled to a deadlock tie until,

Freshman driver Sage Wright is one of a number of first-year players expected to make an im
pact this season. Wright has scored three goals through the first seven games of the season.
the Cardinal's 9-6 victory over No. 9
Pacific 9-6 to make it to the semifi
nals.
Stanford then faced off against
the No. 2 Bears for a berth in the
tournament finals. The Cardinal
controlled the majority of the game,
leading by three at halftime. But
John Mann of Cal dominated the
third quarter, single-handedly
bringing the Bears back into the
game with three goals.
In the fourth, junior Michael
Bury and I lindle-katel each scored,
giving Stanford a 9-7 lead, but this
time the Cardinal could not hold the
lead. Cal scored three straight, scor
ing the winning goal with 1:29 left in
the game.
In the third-place game, Stanford
lost to N0.3 UCLA 7-6 in a more de
fense-powered game.

"Our goal is to play each game
as though it were the NCAA finals,"
Drake said. "We never want to un
derestimate our opponents."
The Cardinal opened the 2006
campaign with a pair of wins Sept. 10
over Navy and Air Force on the Fal
con's campus in USAFA.CoI.
Stanford fueled its opening 14-5
win over the Midshipmen with dom
inating defense and balanced scor
ing. Hindle-Katel led the team with
four goals in the first victory of the
young season. Drake and junior For
rest Schwartz each added two more,
with six more Cardinal adding a goal
a piece.
In the second game of the day
against No. IS Air Force, freshman
Janson Wigo notched three goals,
while twin brother Drac added one
as well. Hindle-Katel had another
strong game with two goals.
This year's squad will be forced
to replace the production of gradu
ating stars Peter Varellas and
ITiomas I lopkins, who combined to
score a little less than half of the

team's goals last season. With only
three seniors and five juniors on a
l l )-man roster, the youth on the
team may have to shoulder much of
the load.
So far. that does not appear to be
an issue. Hindle-Katel, despite only
having one year under his belt, pro
duces like an experienced player.
"This year should be a great year
for Stanford water polo," Drake
said. "Although we lost several
strong players from last season, all
of our younger players are eager to
contribute to the team. New people
to look for this year would be the
three freshmen who will be playing
this season [ Drac Wigo, Jansen Wigo
and Sage Wright]. All three of these
players are very strong both offen
sively and defensively."
The Cardinal will certainly draw
from their opening day's strong per
formances and hope to improve
with this young squad throughout
the season. Next on the schedule for
the Cardinal will be Pacific in Stock
ton, Calif. next Saturday.
