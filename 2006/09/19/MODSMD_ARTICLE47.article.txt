### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the past three years, the Stanford women have
been at the pinnacle of college tennis. They have
reigned supreme with their three straight national ti
tles— last year's triumph was the fourth in five
years. And from the looks of it.the Cardinal will con
tinue to display their dominance in the upcoming
■ season.
Despite graduating four seniors including All-
Americans Alice Barnes and Amber Liu. Stanford
returns six starters and brings in a talented freshman
face.
ITiis year affords the opportunity for a lot of up
ward movement amongst our returning players, and
they are all game for testing the higher positions,"
said head coach Lele Forood of life without Barnes
and Liu. it will be a very competitive situation
which will bring out the best in all of our players to
compete at higher numbers."
Freshman Lindsay Burdette looks to make an im
mediate impact on the Cardinal lineup. Burdette fin
ished sixth in singles at the Girls' 18-and-under
Super Nationals and is currently the national junior
champion in doubles.
Burdette will pair up with senior Anne Yelsey in
the main draw of doubles when the season kicks off
at the All-American Championships, to be held in
Pacific Palisades. Calif, on Oct. 5-8. Despite the lack
of familiarity as a duo. the pair comes in fifth in pre
season rankings and both players have more than
their share of experience individually. Yelsey teamed
up with Barnes and to form last season's ITA Nation
al Doubles Team of the Year. ITiat duo advanced to
the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament where they
fell to the Northwestern team, the eventual champi
ons.
No. 11 Yelsey will also be competing in the main
draw of singles of the Ail-Americans, along with No.
3 senior Theresa Logar and No. 20 junior Celia
Durkin. Last May, Logar advanced to the semifinals
of the singles draw of the NCAA Tournament before
falling to the eventual champion, California's Suzi
Babos. Durkin and Logar will pair up to play in the
qualifying rounds of doubles.
The rest of the Cardinal look to contribute to the
team's perennial depth as No. 34 junior Whitney

Deason and No. 52 Jessica Nguyen will also be com
peting in the qualifying singles draw.
ITie season's first tournament falls on the second
weekend of school, but this does not faze the Cardi
nal.
"It's always a challenge for us to come into such a
big national tournament in the second week of
school," Forood said. "I'll have to rely on everyone
individually preparing themselves at home. Even
though we barely get a week together they should
still be up to being ready to compete."
While the women's team is only bringing in Bur
dette. the men's team welcomes a larger incoming
class consisting of three new freshmen. The Stanford
men graduated two seniors in the spring, Jon Wong
and All-American KC Corkery. leaving the incoming
freshmen with big shoes to fill.
"(Both players] are going to be missed a great
deal." head coach John Whitlinger said. "KC's a very
talented player, and Jon is one of the greatest guys of
all time. We have our work cut out for us. but [assis
tant coach) Dave I lodge and 1 really like the team we
have."
The three freshmen join up with the rest of the
Cardinal squad and look to improve on last year's re
sults— a heartbreaking 4-3 loss to Baylor in the
quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament.
Paul Morrissey of Ireland. Kevin Kaiser, a local
from Saratoga, Calif., and Richard Wire, a lefty from
England, comprise the incoming freshman class for
the Cardinal.
"We're really excited about the freshmen that are
joining our team," Whitlinger said. "I think they're all
very talented and going to add a lot. I can't wait to get
going and see where they all fit in."
Wire will jump into competition immediately and
pair with sophomore Blake Muller in the qualifying
rounds of doubles in the Polo Ralph Lauren All-
American Championships, to be held in Tulsa. Okla.
The qualifying rounds begin that Monday and
Muller and Wire will be playing in the singles draw as
well.
The members of the team who will not be travel
ing to Tulsa will compete in the Bronco Classic, in
Santa Clara, Calif. At the Bronco Classic last fall, jun
ior Phil Kao faced teammate Muller in the finals of
the 'A' flight draw.
Iliis year's team looks as if it's off to the right foot,
as three of its players checked in to the Top 125 in the
pre-season rankings.
"I think the depth of the team is as good as it's
been in a long time," Whitlinger said. "There's a lot of
talent on this team and it's going to be a dogfight."
