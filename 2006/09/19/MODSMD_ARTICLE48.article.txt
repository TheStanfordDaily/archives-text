Classes have yet to start, but the
Stanford men's swimming team has al
ready tested the waters for the 2(X)6-
2007 season.The men suited up last Fri
day in Baton Rouge, La., and demol
ished Louisiana State in their first dual
meet of the season,B4-54.
It was not only the first meet ever
between the Stanford and LSU swim
teams, but also the nation's first NCAA
swimming competition of the new
school year. The men hope that being
first to race this season will also trans
late into more first places later on.
The victory was a result of talent
and heart, since the men have just
hopped back in the pool for the season
a week ago. Though no records were
broken at the meet, the No. 2 Cardinal
showed promise for bigger things to
come, winning 12 of the 14 swimming
events.
The day's top scorers were seniors
Hongzhe Sun and Shaun Phillips. Sun
was the only man to win three individ
ual events, touching first in the 1(H)- and
2(X)-yard backstrokes and the 400-indi
vidual medley Phillips took first the
500- and 1000-yard freestyles. He was
also teamed up with fellow seniors
Kyle Ransom and Matt Crowe and
freshman Alex Coville as pari of the
winning 2(X)-free relay team. Coville
was the only one of eight new freshmen
to score at the meet.
Other event winners for the Card
were Crowe in the 100-free, Ben Wild
man-Tobriner in the 50-free, Danny
Beal in the 200-free, Chris Ash in the
100-breaststroke and BJ Johnson in the
200-breast.
The only swimming events won by
the Tigers were butterfly events. Wild
man -Tobriner was out-touched by
LSU's Christopher Lubenau in the
100-fly, while junior Phillip Morrison
finished closely behind Tiger Sean Le-
Neave for second place in the 200-fly.
The two diving events were also won
by LSU divers, as Stanford's diving
team was not present.
Though perhaps not the most stress
ful competition of the year, the Cardi
nal's chances for yet another undefeat
ed dual meet season still look promis
ing. The Card will splash back into
competition against University of the
Pacific in Stockton. Calif, on Oct. 20.
