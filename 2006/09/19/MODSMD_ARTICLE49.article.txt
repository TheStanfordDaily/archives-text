# MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Fall season preparation to set stage for the year Last season's Pac-10 champions look for 26th straight title this season 
### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Number one in the nation â€” that's
the goal for any team, hut for Stanford
men's swimming and diving, it is an ex
pectation. By clinching their 25th con
secutive Pac-10 championship as well as
an undefeated dual meet season last
year, number one seems like real possi
bility.
Skip Kenney returns to the Farm in
his 27th season as head coach, along with
his assistant Ted Knapp. a former Stan
ford swimmer in his 22nd year with the
team. Kenney and Knapp bring both tra
dition and expertise to the pool and have
turned Stanford swimming into some
thing of an institution. Kenney has been
named the Pac-10 Coach of the Year
seventeen times and has led the men to
seven NCAA titles during his tenure, the
fourth most of any swim coach in histo
ry-
Superior coaching can also be found
by the diving well. Dr. Rick Schavone,
entering his 28th year with the team, is a

three-time Pac-10 and NCAA diving
coach of the year.
( ombined with one of the best
coaching staffs in the country comes the
talent and tenacity of the men them
selves. ITiough the championship season
is not until winter, the men are already
back to training, prepping themselves
for yet another successful season.
ITiough the team lost three seniors to
graduation last year, the incoming class
of nine talented, nationally recognized
freshmen (eight swimmers, one diver)
should only strengthen the squad.
Freestyle
Headlining the sprint free events is
senior Ben Wildman-Tobriner, who was
just named to the 2007 World Champi
onship team's 21-man roster featuring
the best-of-the-best. This year. Wild
man- Tobriner is the top returning colle
giate sprinter in the country. Should he
improve upon last year's second-place
AA finish in the 50 free, he will earn
the title, "fastest college man."
Kyle Ransom. Matt Crowe, and Jason
Dunford have proved to be strong
forces in the sprint events, and should
provide a backbone for the freestyle re
lays. Watch for a slew of freshmen

After a solid freshman seoson, sophomore Paul Kornfield returns along with last
year's entire breaststroke crew. A member of last year's USA Junior National Team,
Kornfield is one of many nationally aclaimed talents on the Cardinal squad.
sprinters, including David Dunford.
the brother of sophomore Jason.
Phe middle-distance and distance
freestyles should be dominated by
seniors Andy Grant and Shaun
Phillips. Grant, who specializes in the
200 and 500 frees, is the school
record holder in the 200, while
Phillips looks to crush the Pac-10
field once again in the mile. Juniors
Danny Beal and Phillip Morrison
should also be contenders in the
mid-distance freestyles.
Backstroke
Senior Hongzhe Sun, the 2006
Pac-10 Swimmer-of-the-Year,
should continue his success this year
in the backstroke events. A national
title in the 200-backstroke is within
reach, as he is the top returnee this
year in that event.
Sophomore Nate Cass, one of the

top freshmen in the nation last year,
will continue to destroy the competi
tion as a more experienced sopho
more. Freshman backstroker Eu
gene Ciodsoe could also prove to he
something special for the Card.
Breaststroke
The entire crew of breaststrokers
returns this year, headlined by soph
omores Paul Kornfeld and Chris
Ash. Kornfeld also had a banner
freshman year last year, with a third
place national finish in the 200
breaststroke. Ash is coming off a
stellar summer, having qualified as a
member of the 2007 Pan-American
Games team. Juniors Karl
Boehringer and Egan Gans and
sophomores Paul Zaich and BJ
Johnson also will contribute to the
breaststroke effort.
Butterfly
Seniors Wildman-Tobriner and
Sun should rule the butterfly events,
but wait for good things to come
from the Dunford brothers, Beal.
and freshmen Jesse Krompier.

Patrick Simpkins and Sven Hinrich
sen.
Individual Medley
IMers Keenan Newman. Sun, and
Cass return as the team's most versa
tile swimmers. Newman and Cass
both were finalists in the 200-individ
ual medley at the 2<x NC AA meet,
and Sun was the 2006 Pac-10 Champi
on in that event. Expect these three to
rack up points not only in the IM
events, hut across the board.
Diving
Sophomore Dwight Dumais will be
the one to watch this year, as the only
diver who has competed in the
NCAA Championships. He should
remain one of the top divers in the
Pac-10 again this year. Senior Kevin
McLean and junior Nathan Kim will
also be significant contributors in the
diving events.
The leadership and talent of the
senior class, combined with being
several swimmers deep in just about
every event, should translate into
success for the Card.
