# MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Fall season preparation to set stage for the year Last season's Pac-10 champions look for 26th straight title this season 
### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Number one in the nation â€” that's
the goal for any team, hut for Stanford
men's swimming and diving, it is an ex
pectation. By clinching their 25th con
secutive Pac-10 championship as well as
an undefeated dual meet season last
year, number one seems like real possi
bility.
Skip Kenney returns to the Farm in
his 27th season as head coach, along with
his assistant Ted Knapp. a former Stan
ford swimmer in his 22nd year with the
team. Kenney and Knapp bring both tra
dition and expertise to the pool and have
turned Stanford swimming into some
thing of an institution. Kenney has been
named the Pac-10 Coach of the Year
seventeen times and has led the men to
seven NCAA titles during his tenure, the
fourth most of any swim coach in histo
ry-
Superior coaching can also be found
by the diving well. Dr. Rick Schavone,
entering his 28th year with the team, is a

three-time Pac-10 and NCAA diving
coach of the year.
( ombined with one of the best
coaching staffs in the country comes the
talent and tenacity of the men them
selves. ITiough the championship season
is not until winter, the men are already
back to training, prepping themselves
for yet another successful season.
ITiough the team lost three seniors to
graduation last year, the incoming class
of nine talented, nationally recognized
freshmen (eight swimmers, one diver)
should only strengthen the squad.
Freestyle
Headlining the sprint free events is
senior Ben Wildman-Tobriner, who was
just named to the 2007 World Champi
onship team's 21-man roster featuring
the best-of-the-best. This year. Wild
man- Tobriner is the top returning colle
giate sprinter in the country. Should he
improve upon last year's second-place
AA finish in the 50 free, he will earn
the title, "fastest college man."
Kyle Ransom. Matt Crowe, and Jason
Dunford have proved to be strong
forces in the sprint events, and should
provide a backbone for the freestyle re
lays. Watch for a slew of freshmen

year's entire breaststroke crew. A member of last year's USA Junior National Team,
