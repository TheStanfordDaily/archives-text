## Harvard ends early admissions Princeton follows suit, but Shaw says that Univ. will stay the course for the time being 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
The dust had barely settled on Harvard College's announce
ment that it was discontinuing its early action program next year
before educators and worried parents began speculating about
which elite schools might join in the revolt.
Not Stanford, said Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw, at least
not for now.
"We gave lots of thought to implementing [our] system, and it's
a pretty good one." he said.
But that was before yesterday when Princeton dropped anoth
er bomb on the college admissions community and announced
that it would follow suit and discontinue its binding, early applica
tion program in favor of a unitary applicant pool.
In Harvard's case, interim Harvard President Derek Bok cited
the unfairness of earlv application programs to lower- and middle
income high school students as one of the reasons for ending its
non-binding early application program.
