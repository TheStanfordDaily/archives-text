## Harvard ends early admissions Princeton follows suit, but Shaw says that Univ. will stay the course for the time being 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
The dust had barely settled on Harvard College's announce
ment that it was discontinuing its early action program next year
before educators and worried parents began speculating about
which elite schools might join in the revolt.
Not Stanford, said Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw, at least
not for now.
"We gave lots of thought to implementing [our] system, and it's
a pretty good one." he said.
But that was before yesterday when Princeton dropped anoth
er bomb on the college admissions community and announced
that it would follow suit and discontinue its binding, early applica
tion program in favor of a unitary applicant pool.
In Harvard's case, interim Harvard President Derek Bok cited
the unfairness of earlv application programs to lower- and middle
income high school students as one of the reasons for ending its
non-binding early application program.
"Early admission programs tend
to advantage the advantaged," he
said in a statement. "Students from
more sophisticated backgrounds and
affluent high schools often apply
early to increase their chances of ad
mission, while minority students and
students from rural areas, other
countries and hig'i schools with
fewer resources miss out."
And in what may be a signal that
the tide is turning. Princeton Univer
sity President Shirley M. Tilghman
echoed Bok's words.
iWe agree that early admission
eadvantages the advantaged,fi she
said in a statement.
But Shaw said that he hasn't
found that to be the case at Stanford.
"We've seen a rise in the diversity
of the applicant pool early, and more
and more kids who are first genera
tion do apply early because it is non
binding," he said.
Harvard College currently em
ploys a non-binding, single-choice
early action program. Students who
apply by November 1 are notified of

their acceptance, rejection or defer
ral by December 15 and have until
the first of May to make their college
choice. Stanford switched to this
same early admissions plan from a
binding, early decision (ED) pro
gram for the 2(M)3 application season
in an effort to minimize the advan
tage more affluent students enjoyed.
Yet William R. Fitzsimmons, I lar
vard's dean of admissions and finan
cial aid,argued that even early action
has pitfalls.
"Even our non-binding program
contributes to the pressures and in
equities of the college admissions
process," he said, noting that stu
dents from affluent families and high
schools are more likely to be well in
formed and advised about early ad
missions.
Fitzsimmons said that applicants
from lower- and middle-income
families who are not as experienced
with admissions processes receive
less advice from college counselors
and sometimes avoid even non
binding programs like Harvard's.
Without sufficient college advising,
many of these families do not distin
guish between non-binding pro
grams like Harvard's and Stanford's
and binding early decision pro
grams. The latter requires early ap

plicants to commit to attending the
school if they are accepted, no mat
ter what amount of financial aid is
offered.
But Shaw defended the Universi
ty's early action program.
"I've looked at income distribu
tions and it really does mirror to
some extent what we see in the regu
lar applicant pool." he said.
Shaw said that elite colleges
would nevertheless consider the im
plications of I larvard's decision.
"I think the marketplace will re
spond. and we'll do that same and
evaluate our early action program,
but it's a very complex issue that de
mands thorough consideration," he
said.
Richard Vos. dean of admission
at Claremont McKenna College,
which has a binding early decision
program, said that the decision to
eliminate early programs has been
raised in the past.
"'lliis has been a topic of discus
sion in the admissions community
for a number of years," he said.
"Every once in a while, at profession
al conferences, someone will stand
up and say. 'This is horrible and we
should do away with it.'"
But Vos said that private schools
on the West Coast face a different set

of challenges than do their Fast
Coast counterparts.
"We are more fortunate for all
kinds of reasons," Vos said, noting
that Claremont's early decision pool
and regular pool are equally diverse.
I le added that early decision pro
grams among colleges on the West
Coast are not as heavily utilized as
those offered by East Coast schools
because many California students
apply to the University of California
system, which has no early program.
"Because students have to wait
until mid-March to hear from the
DCs anyway, they don't mind wait
ing until April 1 to hear from other
colleges," he said.
Some members of Stanford's
class of 2010, who most recently sur
vived the application gauntlet, dis
puted that early action programs add
unnecessary pressures.
"1 wanted to get an application
done early." said freshman Jack
Lazarus."l figured there was nothing
to lose," he added, referring to the
non-binding nature of the Universi
ty's early action program.
"Of course it's less stressful when
you know that you have already
been accepted to Stanford when
your friends haven't even heard back
from any schools yet."
