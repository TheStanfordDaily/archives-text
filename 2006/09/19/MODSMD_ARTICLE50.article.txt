### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Goals have been hard to come by in the presea
son for Stanford men's soccer, but the Cardinal is
picking up the pace at the right time. After losing
three of their first five, the Stanford men have tal
lied a tie and a win in their last two contests.
While the offense was slow starting up. scoring
its first goals in a 2-1 win over Army two weeks
into the season, the defense has been tough, earn
ing a pair of ties and yielding only seven goals in as
many games.
No. 6 Santa Clara beat Stanford 1 -0 to start the
preseason and No. 10 USF scored a two-goal victo
ry over the Cardinal two days later. Stanford bat
tled Princeton to a scoreless tie before finally scor
ing two against Army with senior Michael Brown
and sophomore Tunji Munabi finding the back of
the net.
The Cardinal lost a heartbreaker at home,
falling to San Jose State 2-1 on a goal in the final
eight seconds of the game. Junior Evan Morgan
scored to put Stanford ahead, but the Spartans
fought back for the equalizer and the buzzer-beat
er.
Morgan scored his second goal to take the lead
against Cal State l ullerton, but the Titans fought
back and held on for the 1-1 tie.
At the Cal Legacy Tournament in Berkeley,
Stanford notched its second win. a two-goal affair,
over Sacramento State. Freshman Michael Strick
land and junior Ryan Oblak scored in the first half
and freshman goalkeeper John Moore defended
his net and picked up his first career shutout,
Morgan has provided half of the offensive out
put for the Cardinal while Moore and redshirt
freshman Brent Stewart have combined for 16
saves and a 1.00 goals against average.
Four seniors-Brown, Galen Thompson, Brett
Shimizu and Andrew Kartunen-head up the Stan
ford roster this season, with nine returning starters
and a freshman class of four recruits and two red
shirts. The Cardinal is a more experienced squad
than last year and will look to improve on their 4-
11-3 overall finish and 1-7-2 Pacific-10 Conference
mark from 2005.
Hie Cardinal will host San Diego State Friday
and kick off Pacific-10 Conference competition
Sunday afternoon with No. 19 UCLA.


Junior forward Dan Shapiro started all 18 games for the Cardinal last season. He has 10 shots this sea
son but has yet a score a goal -- a challenge the team as a whole seems to face early this season.
