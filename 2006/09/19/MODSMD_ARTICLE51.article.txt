rently out of the Top 30. was picked to finish
third in the Pacific-10 Conference behind
2005 NCAA finalist No. 4 UCLA and No. 10

Seniors Shari Summers. Rachel Buehler
and Jenny Farenbaugh provide veteran lead
ership to a team that features nine sopho

Santa Clara Tournament, dropping a close
game. 2-1. to Utah. Junior Mimi Yuhas scored
her first career goal in the game, but the Car
dinal could not catch the Utes.
Stanford once more fell just short in the
second match of the tournament. Again the
team lost 2-1. this time in overtime to No. 14
Wake Forest. Sophomore Hilary Heath
scored early to put the Cardinal ahead, but
the Demon Deacons equalized with six min
utes left in the game. A goal in the second

Erica Holland only needed three saves be
tween them to hold all four opponents score
less.

Irvine and San Diego State before finishing
the preseason at No. 3 Santa Clara.
