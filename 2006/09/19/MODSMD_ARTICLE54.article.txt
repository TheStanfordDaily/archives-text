The Stanford women's golf team opened the 2006-
2007 with a pair of top-10 finishes to get the campaign
off to a good start.
The Cardinal opened the year with a second place
finish at the Topy Cup at the Tangura Country Club in
Tokyo, Japan. They led through the first two rounds of
the event, but faltered on the final day to finish two
strokes behind eventual-champion USC.
Senior Jennifer Tangiphaiboontana notched the
Cardinal's top individual finish with a three-round
score of 219. which put her in a tie for second. Senior
Lauren Todd and sophomore Mari Chun also finished
in the top five. They tied for third, both tallying 222.
Tangiphaiboontana was also Stanford's top finisher
at last week's Mason Rudolph Championship at Van
derbilt Legends Club in Franklin, Tenn. The Long
Beach, Calif, native finished with a three-round 219,
good enough for 16th place.
