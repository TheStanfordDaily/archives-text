## During campus shooting, Duquesne players say bullets 'never stopped coming' 
### ALAN ROBINSON AP SPORTS WRITER 
PITTSBURGH (AP) â€”Stephen Wood left
his New York City neighborhood last month to
play college basketball at Duquesne University
partly because the campus is considered so safe.
"That was the whole point, getting away from
New York." the freshman guard said Monday, a
day after five of his basketball teammates were
shot. "You're trying to get away from it, and then
to have it happen ..."
What happened was perhaps the worst crime
related tragedy sustained by an NCAA major col
lege sports program, the shooting of nearly half of
a basketball team's primary roster in a few mere
seconds of violence.
Three players remained hospitalized Monday
night _ including junior forward Sam Ashaolu,23,
a recent junior college transfer who, like Wood,
had been on campus only a few weeks.
Ashaolu was in critical condition at Mercy
I lospital,fighting for his life with bullet fragments
in his head. Family members and several friends
who drove in from Canada kept a constant vigil at
his bedside.
Also hospitalized was Stuard Baidonado, a 6-
foot-7 forward and another junior college trans
fer, who was upgraded to fair condition with left
arm and back injuries. I le began walking Monday
night and is expected to be released from Mercy
later in the week.
Baidonado,2l, was told by surgeons that a bul
let missed his spinal column _ and almost certain
paralysis _ by one-quarter of an inch before lodg
ing in a lower back muscle.
The bullet is expected to be removed Tuesday.
"I'm lucky," Baidonado told Hie Associated
Press in his first interview since the shooting. "I
feel much better today."
Junior guard Kojo Mensah,shot in an arm and
shoulder, was kept an extra night in UPMC Pres
byterian to receive additional injections of antibi
otics. Mensah, 21, transferred from Siena to
Duquesne three weeks ago.

Wood. 18, and guard Aaron Jackson, 20. relat
ed to Hie Associated Press how the shootings
began moments after they left an on-campus
party staged Saturday night by the Mack Student
Union.
"It seemed like the bullets never stopped com
ing," Jackson said.
"I "hey kept coming,constantly," Wood said.
'Ilie basketball team had attended en masse a
football game earlier in the day, then went to the
dance. Because students from other schools also
attended, a Duquesne identification card was not
needed to gain admittance.
Several players agreed the shootings occurred
after a male, who was not a student, became angry
when a woman he accompanied to the dance
began talking with the players.
"We didn't have any conflict at all," Wood said.
"We were just having a good time. There was jeal
ousy because girls were showing us attention."
Evidence collected by police suggested there
were two shooters, not one. Duquesne officials
were told by police that .38 caliber shell casings
were recovered outside an on-campus garage
near the crime scene.
Duquesne coach Ron Everhart. who slept
only about six hours from Saturday night through
late Monday night, called what happened "ab
solute mayhem." But he was encouraged after
NCAA president Myles Brand phoned to offer
full support to his staggered program.
Baidonado is considered the most promising
of the 10 recruits brought in by Everhart during a
massive rebuilding of a team that went 3-24 last
year. Baidonado likely won't play this season, as a
back injury like his commonly needs two to three
months of rehabilitation.
Baidonado also was shot in the left arm, and
doctors transplanted a vein from his groin to that
arm during reconstructive surgery.
Junior center Shawn James, the nation's lead
ing shot blocker last season while playing for
Everhart at Northeastern, was out of the hospital
but may need additional treatment to have a bul
let removed from his left foot.

According to the players, Mensah, Ashaolu
and Baldonado were the first to be hit; James es
caped by running across the nearby footba'i field.
Everhart said his players rushed to each
other's aid, threw their bodies atop one another
for protection and improvised first aid during a
time when they easily could have been shot addi
tional times.
" Ihe young men on this team reacted with
bravery and courage," he said.
Wood, who was not struck, saw Baldonado bleed
ing badly from his left arm and quickly tix>k off his
own shirt and applied a tourniquet.
"1 turned away, and saw Stu on the floor, and
my first reaction was to take my shirt off and try to
stop the bleeding," Wood said. "Then I turned
around and 1 saw Sam laying there."
Mensah. struck himself, aided at least one
other player while fighting to control his own
bleeding. Jackson lifted the 250-pound Baldona
do on his back, carried him to his car and drove
him to nearby Mercy I lospital.
"I le was real heavy," Jackson said. "He's the
strongest guy I've ever met. But when he passed
out on me in the car,man,that really (was bad)."
Jackson and Wood, however, downplayed
their roles.
"You think, Oh, that's my man, we're going to
look out for him.'" Jackson said.
Wood agreed, saying, 'it's amazing how we've
bonded as a team in a couple of weeks. TTiey
would do the same thing for us. if it were the other
way around."
University president Charles Dougherty, who
visited with the injured players in their hospital
rooms Monday, said it was the first known shoot
ing in the 128-year history of the 10,(XK)-student
university in downtown Pittsburgh.
"No one has described a scenario that comes
close to justifying violence of any sort, no less this
dastardly, cowardly kind of violence," said
Dougherty,who said the school would study addi
tional security measures needed.
The players are convinced the shootings have
made a still-developing team even closer.
