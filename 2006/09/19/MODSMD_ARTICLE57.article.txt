## 
### RUSTY MILLER AP SPORTS WRITER 
COLI IM BUS, ()hio (A P) â€” 1 lis mother cry
ing in the courtroom behind him, Maurice Clarett
stood before a judge as a common criminal in the
town where not so long ago he was a king.
Gone was the glory of having led Ohio State
to a national championship as a freshman tail
back. along with the can't-miss prospect of an
NFL career.
In their place stood a prison term of at least
3 1/2 years, the product of a plea deal Clarett
took Monday as he was about to be tried on al
legations that he robbed two people at gun
point.
"He was up here," Clarett's attorney,
Michael Hoague, said minutes later, raising his
arm up to eye level. "He got down here," he
said, lowering his arm to his waist. "And he's
going to be back up here again."
Clarett was sentenced to 7 1/2 years with re
lease from prison possible after 3 1/2 years. He
also agreed to serve five years of probation for
the robbery outside a bar early on New Year's
Day and carrying a concealed weapon.
"It's in a range that will allow him to get his
life back together after his release," Prosecutor
Ron O'Brien said.
For Clarett, still just 22, the plea bargain pre
served the chance he could one day resurrect a
career he had tried to keep going until the night
last month that he led police on a highway
chase in a sport utility vehicle with four loaded
guns. Officers had to spike the tires to stop him

and use pepper spray and handcuffs to subdue
him when his bulletproof vest stymied their
stun guns.
"There are institutions in Ohio that actually
have opportunities to work out and train for
football and other athletics," Hoague said.
"We're hoping lie can do that, and stay in shape
and be focused on that."
A bearded Clarett, wearing handcuffs and
jail-issued clothing, remained expressionless
throughout the hearing.
"I'd like to apologize for my behavior, and 1
accept the time that was given to me," Clarett
said in Franklin County Common Pleas Court.
After the judge accepted the deal, Clarett
looked over at his mother in the first row of the
gallery. She sobbed and held his K-week-old
daughter while sitting next to his girlfriend.
As a true freshman, Clarett led ()hio State to
the 2(M)2 national championship, scoring the
winning touchdown in the second overtime in
the title game against Miami.
Hi at was the last time he played for the Buck
eyes, and his life hasspiraled out of control ever
since.
He was suspended for lying to NCAA inves
tigators before the 2003 season and dropped
out of school. He lost a U.S. Supreme Court case
challenging the NFL's requirement that players
wait three years after high school before turn
ing pro. Hie Denver Broncos made Clarett a
surprise third-round pick in the NFL's 2005
draft, only to cut him during the preseason.
"It's really a shame that someone puts them
selves in that position," Broncos coach Mike

Shanahan said Monday. "I'm just hoping when
he does get out that he's learned his lesson and
conies back with a mind-set that he's going to
be productive (in society)."
Authorities said Clarett flashed a gun and
robbed two people of a cell phone early Jan. 1.
I le turned himself in around the time that many
of his former Buckeyes teammates were put
ting the finishing touches on a Fiesta Bowl vic
tory over Notre Dame.
Clarett had been drinking heavily on New
Year's Eve, Hoague said. But the attorney did
not explain why Clarett had a gun in his waist
band.
"Obviously, that was a bad decision,"
1 loague said.
Clarett's attorneys said the guns police
found in the SUV belonged to Clarett and came
from his mother's house. Iliey said he had the
guns because he was trying to give them to ac
quaintances to hold for him, but the attorneys
did not elaborate.
Had Clarett been convicted on all charges,
he would have faced three to 34 years in prison.
Assistant Prosecutor Tim Mitchell said he ex
pects Clarett will serve just over 4 years, with his
last six months spent outside prison at a com
munity-based corrections facility.
A victims' assistant from the prosecutor's
office read a statement from the robbery vic
tims. who said the ordeal has been hard on all
aspects of their lives.
"Mr. Clarett. we hope you will use this op
portunity to help someone along the way," it
read.
