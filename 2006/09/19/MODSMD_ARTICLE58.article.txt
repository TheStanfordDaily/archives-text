## 
### JOHN NADEL AP SPORTS WRITER 
New Orleans Saints running back Reggie
Bush insisted Friday he and his family have done
nothing wrong, responding to allegations that
they accepted gifts, money and other benefits
worth more than $1(M).(MH) from two marketing
agents during his career at Southern California.
"I'm not worried about any of these allega
tions or anything like that, because I know what
the truth is, like I said from day one." Hush said
after a Saints practice. "Once the smoke clears,
everybody's going to see we did nothing wrong."
Yahoo.com reported Thursday that Michael
Michaels, a marketing agency investor who
wanted to represent the Heisman Trophy win
ner, and current Bush marketing agent Mike
Ornstein supplied Bush and his family with
gifts while he was still at I JSC.
Each hoped to represent Bush once he left
school. Bush eventually chose Ornstein, which
caused a falling out between Michaels and
Bush's family.
Michaels' attorney, Brian Watkins, said his
client was traveling Friday and unavailable for
comment, but Watkins claimed the Yahoo.com
report was "very accurate."
"We've known what (Bush) was doing.This
article proves fraud on his part and his family's
part. I le never intended to go forward with my
clients. He was always taking money from Mike

Ornstein and then representing with my clients
that he was going to go forward with this busi
ness venture." Watkins said, referring to
Michaels' company. New Era.
"It was fine for him to go with the other ven
ture, but his job was to notify my clients that he
was on the payroll with Ornstein. But he said
the opposite. He continued to do that and took
money from my client."
Neither Ornstein not Bush's attorney, David
Cornwell. returned phone messages from The
Associated Press left late Thursday and Friday.
The NCAA prohibits student-athletes and
their families from receiving extra benefits
from agents or their representatives. Any im
proper benefits could lead to NCAA sanctions
against USC and retroactively cost Bush his
college eligibility and I leisman Trophy.
On Friday, Bush responded to questions
about the report much the same as he did when
the allegations of improper benefits first were
reported earlier this year.
"Obviously it does affect you just because it
is out there," Bush said."But at the same time. 1
know there's nothing to worry about. It makes
you want to go out there right away and tell
your side of the story. Show everybody the facts,
the truth. But you can't do that. That wouldn't
be the right way to do it."
Yahoo.com reported earlier this year that
Bush's mother and stepfather lived rent free
last year in a house in the San Diego area

owned by Michaels. He later said the family
promised to repay him the $54,000 in rent once
Bush went pro.
Bush, the second overall pick in the NFL draft
last April, said he has been in touch with USC.
"I told them the same thing. Don't worry
about anything,'" he said. "If there was some
thing to worry about, than 1 would tell you. But
there's nothing to worry about."
Yahoo's latest report was based on an eight
month investigation that cited documents and
interviews with on-the-record sources close to
the situation. It lists several instances in which
Bush and his family appear to have received fi
nancial benefits.
Hie NCAA and Pac-10 are investigating
whether rules were broken when Bush's family
lived in the home owned by Michaels.
IJSCcounsel Kelly Bendell said the school is
cooperating but "cannot comment on any mat
ter that is the subject of an ongoing NCAA and
Pac-10 investigation."
NCAA spokesman lirik Christianson said
via e-mail Friday from Indianapolis that it's
generally NCAA policy not to comment on in
vestigations. but added: "Now that certain indi
viduals have spoken publicly, we hope they will
now speak with the NCAA."
