# CROSS COUNTRY
## Cross county defends title Women try to repeat as National Champions, men hope to improve on sixth place finish. 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
It's deja vu all over again for the Stanford cross
country' teams. With every female runner returning
and all hut one male hack on the Farm, the Cardinal
is poised to defend its women's national title and
build from the men's sixth-place finish in the 2005
season.
The Stanford women took last year's team title,
the second in three years, behind the All-American
performances of redshirt juniors Arianna Lambie
and Teresa Mc Walters and seniors Katy and Aman
da Trotter. Lambie, last year's Pac-10 Cross Country
Athlete of the Year, finished eighth in the NCAA
meet last year to lead the squad to victory. With this
dynamic foursome, joined by All-American junior
Lauren Centrowitz and redshirt sophomore Lind
say Flacks and a deep and talented roster of return
ers and new recruits, Stanford claimed the top spot
in the preseason national poll ahead of 2005 runner
up Colorado.
If all, or even most, of the Cardinal stay healthy,
the team may just bring home its third title in four
years at November's NCAA meet.
On the men's side, Stanford returns every mem
ber but one of last year's sixth-place team.The Car
dinal. ranked fourth in the preseason poll, will look
to redshirt junior Neftalem Araia, last year's 11th
finisher at the NCAA meet, to lead the way.
The 2005 team was relatively young, having lost
three top runners from the previous year, but this
year's squad is older and more experienced with a
core of veteran runners and a pair of talented re
cruits looking to improve on last year's perform
ance. Four seniors. Jacob Gomez. Brett Gotcher.
Jonathan Pierce and Rolf Steier, return to cross
country after a successful track season in which
each picked up an All-American honor.
The Cardinal will be on the track this weekend at
the Stanford Invitational, one of the nation's largest
meets which features high school and collegiate
athletes from around the country. Competition will
pick up in October with the Pac-10 Championships,
where the Cardinal is defending champion in both
the women's and men's races, followed by the
NCAA West Regional where Lambie will seek to
defend her individual crown as well as Stanford's
team title.
