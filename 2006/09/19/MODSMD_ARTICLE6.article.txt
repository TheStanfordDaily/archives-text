## Frosh ace mandatory booze test Univ., RAs praise online quiz, but many frosh doubt usefulness 
### KAT LEWIN 
The Class of 2010's first quiz will not be
about economics or history, but blood alcohol
content and drunk driving as part of an online
educational program called AlcoholEDU
that is now mandatory for incoming students.
Student Affairs and the Alcohol Advisory
Board studied the program — already in use
at more than 350 colleges and universities —
for three years as part of an effort to explore
new ways to bring alcohol education to fresh
men. Last year, fifty Stanford students piloted
AlcoholEDU — created by the company
Outside the Classroom — and the majority
rated it highly, said alcohol and drug educator
Ralph Castro, the manager of the Substance
Abuse Prevention Program for Vaden Health
Center.
"Recent research on the AlcoholEDU
program found that students who completed
the course reduced their alcohol intake and
also reduced the incidence of heavy episodic
drinking patterns." he said, adding that the
program will supplement, not replace, exist
ing alcohol education programs.
Junior Hershey Avula, a Resident Assis
tant in Branner and chair of the ASSU Under
graduate Senate, was equally optimistic.
"Obviously, some students may still choose
to learn how to deal with alcohol from experi
encing its extremes first hand." Avula said, but
he guessed that many would still find Alco
holEDU helpful.
Hie program has two parts: one, three
hour segment that students completed online
before Sept. 15 and a short survey that needs
to be completed within the first few weeks
of school.
"I think AlchoholEDU took me about
three hours," said freshman Elizabeth
Dillingham. "I did it in a day in a half just to
get it over with. It wasn't challenging to
complete at all. It just became tedious at
points."
Instead of a standard lecture, the first
part of the program asks students about
their previous exposure to alcohol and
shows segments adapted to respond to the
student's needs, Avula said.

"I think the fact that it is tailored to re
spond uniquely to a student's individual re
sponses shows that it has been thoroughly
tested and should be effective," he said.
Some students were ambivalent about
the effectiveness of the course.
"Its purpose was to communicate infor
mation, and did so, with an easy to follow
slideshow, and repeated question-answer
sessions to drill the info into a prospective
student's head," said freshman Chris
Hadley. "Not all of the info was a review ei
ther — it did teach me new things, but I
can't remember what they were for the life
of me."
Other freshmen complained that the
program did not require their full attention.
"I did it on my computer at work, and I
had to run it on mute in the background,"

said Ryan Thompson. "I still got a 90%, so it
wasn't difficult beyond being long."
Freshman Magali Ferare said that he ap
preciated the University's concern, but
doubted the program would reap any long
term benefits.
"Really, I don't know anyone who actu
ally paid attention to the entire program,"
she said. "Most, like me, paid little to no at
tention and yet still aced the quiz at the
end."
In spite of some criticism, Avula said he
supports AlcoholEDU as an addition to
Stanford's existing alcohol education.
"As an all-frosh RA, I am happy that the
program was put in place, because if the
claims about its effectiveness are indeed
true, then I will have less alcohol related
problems to deal with."
