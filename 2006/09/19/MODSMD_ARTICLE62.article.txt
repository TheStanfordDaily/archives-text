# NEWSFEED
## MANY MIFFED ONER FACEBOOK FEEDS 
### SAM BHAGWAT DESK EDITOR 
It isn't often that three-quarters of a million people
gather together to demand change.
On the morning of Tliesday, Sept. 5, Facebook un
derwent a massive overhaul, adding two completely
new features: Mini-Feed, which appears on each user's
profile and tracks everything public that each user
does, and News Feed, which appears on each user's
home page and integrates all information in each of
that user's friend's mini-feeds, each friend of that user
and displays it all, sorted by time.
Users met these changes with a barrage of angry
criticism, on a variety of fronts. Some were concerned
about how easy News Feed made stalking — and how
much News Feed made them feel like a stalker.
"You felt creepy just looking at this stuff," said Igor
Hiller, an incoming UC-Santa Barbara freshman who
was planning an organized protest at Facebook head
quarters in Palo Alto before calling it off when the Web
site rolled back Mini-Feeds. "1 mean, 1 don't
care if one of my old friends form middle school isn't
in a relationship anymore. I just really don't care. But
now, Fm reading it, and I'm thinking, 'should I
care?'"[A transcript of the Daily's interview with
Hiller is inside the section]
Hiller's uneasiness was echoed by others.
"People should be able to choose the information
they display, but the original Mini-Feed drew attention
to things that you were removing, like ended relation
ships and leaving groups," said junior Sean Arenson.
Ironically, the very instantaneous communication
that Facebook enables helped organize those discon
tented with the new features.
Widespread protests were helped along by a new
Facebook tool — the Global Groups feature, which al
lows groups to have members in different social net
works. Legions of angry users organized into large
protest groups, the largest of which was founded on the
morning of the Fifth by Northwestern junior Ben Parr.
Called "Students Against Facebook News Feed (Offi
cial Petition)," it grew exponentially, in three days
reaching almost 750,(XX) members — around eight
percent of Facebook's 9.5 million users.
Facebook's initial public reaction to the crisis was
that they had the situation under control. "Calm down.
Breathe. We hear you," was the title of a Tliesday night
blog post by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg."We
know that many of you are not immediate fans," he

wrote. "We are listenin

to all your suggestions

about how to improve

the product; it's brand

new and still evolv-

ing." More question-

able was an earlier ac-

tion: when Facebook's

blog post announcing

the change generated

around 1 (K) overwhelm-

ingly negative comments

by early Tuesday, Face-

book responded sometime

between 10am and spm by

disabling the comments fea
ture.

But by Thursday, Facebook ex
ecuted a 180-degree turn, rolling back
Mini-Feeds and giving users control over
which of their actions are recorded in their Mini-Feed
and appear on their friends' News Feeds. Though users
cannot remove Mini-Feed or News Feed from their ac
count, they can now opt out if they wish. "We really
messed this one up," Zuckerberg blogged on Thursday.
"Even though I wish I hadn't made so many of you
angry...l want to thank all of you who have written in
and created groups and protested."
But though the Mini-Feed has recently been in the
spotlight, privacy concerns remain. Facebook will like
ly soon face further concerns when plans to let anyone
join through regional networks come to fruition. In
January, many students removed and untagged pic
tures of parties when word spread that employers were
using Facebook to check on potential employees.
Even two years ago — an eternity by online stan
dards — concerns were being voiced about the infor
mation the then-seven-month-old phenomenon was
providing. An article appearing in The Daily's Orien
tation Issue noted that around two-thirds of the in
coming class of 2008 had joined Facebook, and quoted
Larkin RA Josh Seifert saying that Facebook led peo
ple to "start forming images of residents, which is
against the Stanford philosophy of everyone starting
out on an equal footing." An anonymous gay staff
member was disturbed to read an incoming freshman's
"homophobic comments" on that freshman's Face
book profile.
The difficulty of Facebook implanting its principles
that users should have "control over [their] personal
information," and "access to the information others
want to share" has been the prime, continual source of

con
flict. Per
haps users don't

want to share the same in
formation with everyone, as
was the case when employers
began to use Facebook. Or per
haps controls weren't adequate
to ensure adherence to either
principle, as in the case of Mini-

Feed. But Zuckerberg's blog admis
sion that Facebook "didn't build in the
proper privacy controls" for Mini-Feed re-

vives a recurrent question surrounding Facebook:
how much information is too much?
"Facebook wasn't supposed to be for tracking when
your acquaintances change their relationship status." 1
says sophomore Lillia Cherkasskiy. "I'd rather net
work with people than have a mass answering ma
chine." !
Sophomore Emily Grewal disagrees. 1
"I think that once they refine Mini-Feed, it will be 1
beneficial," she said. "I like the fact that you can tell
what people update, without cruising through lots of j
profiles. And it reminds you to check profiles of old (
friends."
Most students seemed to support more personal
control over what is and is not displayed. In the wake
of the Mini-Feed controversy, a growing number of '
people seem to be making their profiles accessible 1
only to friends. Though users can, to a degree, cus- 1
tomize Mini-Feed features, some still complain that it's
not enough.
"Facebook should allow you not just to choose how
much of your information is displayed to others. It
should allow you to choose how much of your friends'

is displayed

on your News Feed," Arenson

argued.
And those users wanting to remove the feed system
from their account and get the original profile display
back are out of luck. Facebook co-founder Chris
Hughes nixed the idea at a Thursday press conference,
saying that "the feed features are pretty integral to the
development of the site, so we won't be removing
them."
Clearly, Facebook hasn't placated some of its alien
ated users. The episode demonstrated the power of a
company's customers to force change — especially
when the Internet is thrown into the mix.
"It was nice to see people use the tools we supplied
to create a forum and have an open discussion about
these things," Zuckerberg said during the press confer
ence. "After that, we just took people's feedback into
account."
Hiller emphasized the power of numbers.
"It doesn't matter how old you are, or how impor
tant you are," Hiller said. "The fact is, if you don't like
something, you can change it."

The difficulty of Facebook implanting its principles
that users should have "control over [their] personal
information," and "access to the information others
want to share" has been the prime, continual source of

con
flict. Per
haps users don't

want to share the same in
formation with everyone, as
was the case when employers
began to use Facebook. Or per
haps controls weren't adequate
to ensure adherence to either
principle, as in the case of Mini-

Feed. But Zuckerberg's blog admis
sion that Facebook "didn't build in the
proper privacy controls" for Mini-Feed re-

vives a recurrent question surrounding Facebook:
how much information is too much?
"Facebook wasn't supposed to be for tracking when
your acquaintances change their relationship status." 1
says sophomore Lillia Cherkasskiy. "I'd rather net
work with people than have a mass answering ma
chine." !
Sophomore Emily Grewal disagrees. 1
"I think that once they refine Mini-Feed, it will be 1
beneficial," she said. "I like the fact that you can tell
what people update, without cruising through lots of j
profiles. And it reminds you to check profiles of old (
friends."
Most students seemed to support more personal
control over what is and is not displayed. In the wake
of the Mini-Feed controversy, a growing number of '
people seem to be making their profiles accessible 1
only to friends. Though users can, to a degree, cus- 1
tomize Mini-Feed features, some still complain that it's
not enough.
"Facebook should allow you not just to choose how
much of your information is displayed to others. It
should allow you to choose how much of your friends'

is displayed

on your News Feed," Arenson

argued.
And those users wanting to remove the feed system
from their account and get the original profile display
back are out of luck. Facebook co-founder Chris
Hughes nixed the idea at a Thursday press conference,
saying that "the feed features are pretty integral to the
development of the site, so we won't be removing
them."
Clearly, Facebook hasn't placated some of its alien
ated users. The episode demonstrated the power of a
company's customers to force change — especially
when the Internet is thrown into the mix.
"It was nice to see people use the tools we supplied
to create a forum and have an open discussion about
these things," Zuckerberg said during the press confer
ence. "After that, we just took people's feedback into
account."
Hiller emphasized the power of numbers.
"It doesn't matter how old you are, or how impor
tant you are," Hiller said. "The fact is, if you don't like
something, you can change it."

It isn't often that three-quarters of a million people
gather together to demand change.
On the morning of Tliesday, Sept. 5, Facebook un
derwent a massive overhaul, adding two completely
new features: Mini-Feed, which appears on each user's
profile and tracks everything public that each user
does, and News Feed, which appears on each user's
home page and integrates all information in each of
that user's friend's mini-feeds, each friend of that user
and displays it all, sorted by time.
Users met these changes with a barrage of angry
criticism, on a variety of fronts. Some were concerned
about how easy News Feed made stalking — and how
much News Feed made them feel like a stalker.
"You felt creepy just looking at this stuff," said Igor
Hiller, an incoming UC-Santa Barbara freshman who
was planning an organized protest at Facebook head
quarters in Palo Alto before calling it off when the Web
site rolled back Mini-Feeds. "1 mean, 1 don't
care if one of my old friends form middle school isn't
in a relationship anymore. I just really don't care. But
now, Fm reading it, and I'm thinking, 'should I
care?'"[A transcript of the Daily's interview with
Hiller is inside the section]
Hiller's uneasiness was echoed by others.
"People should be able to choose the information
they display, but the original Mini-Feed drew attention
to things that you were removing, like ended relation
ships and leaving groups," said junior Sean Arenson.
Ironically, the very instantaneous communication
that Facebook enables helped organize those discon
tented with the new features.
Widespread protests were helped along by a new
Facebook tool — the Global Groups feature, which al
lows groups to have members in different social net
works. Legions of angry users organized into large
protest groups, the largest of which was founded on the
morning of the Fifth by Northwestern junior Ben Parr.
Called "Students Against Facebook News Feed (Offi
cial Petition)," it grew exponentially, in three days
reaching almost 750,(XX) members — around eight
percent of Facebook's 9.5 million users.
Facebook's initial public reaction to the crisis was
that they had the situation under control. "Calm down.
Breathe. We hear you," was the title of a Tliesday night
blog post by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg."We
know that many of you are not immediate fans," he

wrote. "We are listenin

to all your suggestions

about how to improve

the product; it's brand

new and still evolv-

ing." More question-

able was an earlier ac-

tion: when Facebook's

blog post announcing

the change generated

around 1 (K) overwhelm-

ingly negative comments

by early Tuesday, Face-

book responded sometime

between 10am and spm by

disabling the comments fea
ture.

But by Thursday, Facebook ex
ecuted a 180-degree turn, rolling back
Mini-Feeds and giving users control over
which of their actions are recorded in their Mini-Feed
and appear on their friends' News Feeds. Though users
cannot remove Mini-Feed or News Feed from their ac
count, they can now opt out if they wish. "We really
messed this one up," Zuckerberg blogged on Thursday.
"Even though I wish I hadn't made so many of you
angry...l want to thank all of you who have written in
and created groups and protested."
But though the Mini-Feed has recently been in the
spotlight, privacy concerns remain. Facebook will like
ly soon face further concerns when plans to let anyone
join through regional networks come to fruition. In
January, many students removed and untagged pic
tures of parties when word spread that employers were
using Facebook to check on potential employees.
Even two years ago — an eternity by online stan
dards — concerns were being voiced about the infor
mation the then-seven-month-old phenomenon was
providing. An article appearing in The Daily's Orien
tation Issue noted that around two-thirds of the in
coming class of 2008 had joined Facebook, and quoted
Larkin RA Josh Seifert saying that Facebook led peo
ple to "start forming images of residents, which is
against the Stanford philosophy of everyone starting
out on an equal footing." An anonymous gay staff
member was disturbed to read an incoming freshman's
"homophobic comments" on that freshman's Face
