## 
### SAM BHAGWAT ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR 
Igor Miller is an incoming (JC-Santa Barbara
freshman who organized a protest at /'he Face
hook.coin's headquarters in opposition to their
new Mini-Feed feature. The demonstration Has
scheduled for1 Monday, Sept. 11, but Ililler called it
off when Facebook rolled hack the changes.
The Daily: I low did you get started with the
whole idea of organizing a protest? What was
your initial reaction when you saw the mini
feeds?
Igor Hiller: First, 1 was struck by the layout.
Facebook was so simple be fore, and now it was all
cluttered with this noise and information that I
wasn't used to, and then when 1 started reading
what the information was I was shocked and
taken aback at all the vast enormity of everything
that I was reading.Then almost immediately. I no
ticed that my friends were posting, and they were
saying that they didn't like it either. And then the
main Facebook protest was formed. 1 liked the
tact that they were protesting online, but I
thought."why not take this to the next level." and
protest in person?
The Daily: How many people were planning
on coming?
Igor: Well, since we didn't carry it all the way
through, it's difficult to tell. But within (i to 8

hours, we had 15 people say that they were going
to go and 44 maybes. But I was thinking 30. I
would have been happy with 30.
The Daily: You got interviewed by AP and
Reuters, and when I Googled you, you got twice
as many hits as Ben Parr, the Northwestern jun
ior who started the "Official Petition to Face
book "group. Why do you think that this guy that
started a 750.(H(-person group gets half as many
hits as you. who start a Facebook protest with 30
people?
Igor: Well, first of all. this Ben Parr character is
interesting in and of himself. On his page, he said
straight up that he wouldn't speak to [the media].
It's confusing to me why he wouldn't talk to any
media, if lie wanted to get the word out. But I
think the real reason is that there's a disparity be
tween something happening online and some
thing happening in real life.and I think that's why
the media sort of latched onto it more. This is
something tangible that they could see and that
people could attend. Also, our generation isn't
known for protesting, [and] people wanted to get
up oil their butts and do something, instead of
clicking 'join group.'
I lie Daily: What was your reaction when
1 acebook decided to roll back the changes?
Igor: Well...it's not"s perfect. lam happy, I'm
