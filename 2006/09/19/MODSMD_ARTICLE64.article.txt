# CAMPUS LIFE
## Doing Stanford – all year long 
### DEVON MAYLIE 
ITiere was a time at Stanford when corduroys were restricted
to seniors; students Ironi different graduating classes were dis
tinguished by the kind of hat they wore; freshmen were dunked
in tubs in Encina Hall — then an all-male dorm — and students
soaked up the sun on Lake Lagunita. While these customs are
long gone. Stanford is still rich in offbeat traditions, from the
Band run in September to Wacky Walk at Commencement.
All year long. Stanford students can participate in a range of
activities that will give them a sense of home, camaraderie and
what exactly it means to be a Stanford student. Here is a guide
for incoming students to learn the campus lingo, understand the
history of the Cal rivalry and discover a hidden place to make
out.
September / October / November

Full Moon on the Quad
Under the light of the first full

moon of the quarter, freshmen
boys become men and fresh-

men girls become women
with the kiss of a senior, ac-

cording to legend. Full
Moon on the Quad is also

a favorite event for non
seniors to pucker up with a
generous crowd. Original-

ly. the tradition was for cou-
pies to congregate in the
Quad to share a kiss under the
moonlight.

Hand Run
Meet the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band
on a run through campus. With the tree in tow, the run culminates
in the Quad.

Flicks
Procrastinate on Sunday nights in Memorial Auditorium at
Flicks. Weekly movies are screened at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.,open to
undergraduate and graduate students. Flicks is not just a movie
— it's a paper fight too.
San Francisco scavenger hunt
Get to know your dorm mates during a hunt in the big city.
From Big Al's sex shop to the tattoo parlor, the team that exe
cutes the most outrageous assignments (wearing the fewest
pieces of clothing) is the winner.
Stanfor-dictionarv
Learn what CoHo, Flo Mo. Pro Fro, MemChu and FroSoCo
mean. Or eschew them.
Big Game, Dec. 2
This battle of brawn is fought on the football field on Dec 2
between two schools
whose students are
more renowned for
their brains. The
yearly rivalry began
in 1592 when the
older University of
California chal
lenged fledgling
Stanford to a friend-
ly match. The inexperienced Stanford boys had no equipment,
no coach, no uniforms and no playing field. But on March 19, on
the Haight Street field in San Francisco, Stanford upset favored
Cal in a 14-10 game. This year the two meet at Berkeley for their
109 th match-up.
Pre-Big Game pump-ups: Rally, Countdown and Red Hot
Prof competition
In April 1899, during a pre-game bonfire rally, the yell leader
introduced a real axe into his "Give 'em the axe" chant, directed
toward Cal.The axe was used to decapitate a straw effigy dressed
in Cal's colors, gold and blue. After Stanford's loss, Cal students
nabbed the axe and held it captive until 1930, when Stanford stu
dents recovered it in a daring heist.The rescuers were immortal
ized as the Stanford 21.
Today, the Axe Committee protects the battle weapon and
pumps up the spirit of the student body. Camping out in White
Plaza before the two teams crash helmets, the committee marks
each hour leading to the game with the sounding of a train whis
tle.
Gaieties
Big Game season is not complete without Gaieties — a stu
dent-written, -produced and -directed musical performed in
preparation for Stanford's match against Cal. Special perform
ances by President John I lennessy and other members of the ad
ministration are coupled with shots at Cal. Dorms often reserve
group seats in Memorial Auditorium to witness a show where
anything goes.
Sixth Man Club
As football season comes to a close, basketball begins in a
newly renovated Maples Pavilion. Sit in the student section and
cheer Stanford to victory. Who knows, maybe Tiger Woods will
show up at a game again this year.
December
Secret Snowflake
In the spirit of the holiday season. ,
dorm mates are secretly paired to de- *
vise embarrassing antics for their part
ner to perform in front of their house
mates.
Primal Scream
At midnight each night during Dead Week, students yell at
the top of their lungs from their windows to relieve their end-of
quarter stress and anguish.
January
Dorm ski trips
I fit the slopes or play poker in the cabin during dorm ski trips
toTahoe and other nearby snow-bunny hot spots.

Big Game, Dec. 2

lenged fledgling
Stanford to a friend-

ly match. The inexperienced Stanford boys had no equipment,
no coach, no uniforms and no playing field. But on March 19, on
the Haight Street field in San Francisco, Stanford upset favored
Cal in a 14-10 game. This year the two meet at Berkeley for their
109 th match-up.
Pre-Big Game pump-ups: Rally, Countdown and Red Hot
Prof competition
In April 1899, during a pre-game bonfire rally, the yell leader
introduced a real axe into his "Give 'em the axe" chant, directed
toward Cal.The axe was used to decapitate a straw effigy dressed
in Cal's colors, gold and blue. After Stanford's loss, Cal students
nabbed the axe and held it captive until 1930, when Stanford stu
dents recovered it in a daring heist.The rescuers were immortal
ized as the Stanford 21.
Today, the Axe Committee protects the battle weapon and
pumps up the spirit of the student body. Camping out in White
Plaza before the two teams crash helmets, the committee marks
each hour leading to the game with the sounding of a train whis

ITiere was a time at Stanford when corduroys were restricted
to seniors; students Ironi different graduating classes were dis
tinguished by the kind of hat they wore; freshmen were dunked
in tubs in Encina Hall — then an all-male dorm — and students
soaked up the sun on Lake Lagunita. While these customs are
long gone. Stanford is still rich in offbeat traditions, from the
Band run in September to Wacky Walk at Commencement.
All year long. Stanford students can participate in a range of
activities that will give them a sense of home, camaraderie and
what exactly it means to be a Stanford student. Here is a guide
for incoming students to learn the campus lingo, understand the
history of the Cal rivalry and discover a hidden place to make
out.
September / October / November

Full Moon on the Quad
Under the light of the first full

moon of the quarter, freshmen
boys become men and fresh-

men girls become women
with the kiss of a senior, ac-

cording to legend. Full
Moon on the Quad is also

a favorite event for non
seniors to pucker up with a
generous crowd. Original-

ly. the tradition was for cou-
pies to congregate in the
Quad to share a kiss under the
moonlight.

Hand Run
Meet the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band
on a run through campus. With the tree in tow, the run culminates
in the Quad.

Flicks
Procrastinate on Sunday nights in Memorial Auditorium at
Flicks. Weekly movies are screened at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.,open to
undergraduate and graduate students. Flicks is not just a movie
— it's a paper fight too.
San Francisco scavenger hunt
Get to know your dorm mates during a hunt in the big city.
From Big Al's sex shop to the tattoo parlor, the team that exe
cutes the most outrageous assignments (wearing the fewest
pieces of clothing) is the winner.
Stanfor-dictionarv
Learn what CoHo, Flo Mo. Pro Fro, MemChu and FroSoCo
mean. Or eschew them.
Big Game, Dec. 2
This battle of brawn is fought on the football field on Dec 2
between two schools
whose students are
more renowned for
their brains. The
yearly rivalry began
in 1592 when the
older University of
California chal
lenged fledgling
Stanford to a friend-
ly match. The inexperienced Stanford boys had no equipment,
no coach, no uniforms and no playing field. But on March 19, on
the Haight Street field in San Francisco, Stanford upset favored
Cal in a 14-10 game. This year the two meet at Berkeley for their
109 th match-up.
Pre-Big Game pump-ups: Rally, Countdown and Red Hot
Prof competition
In April 1899, during a pre-game bonfire rally, the yell leader
introduced a real axe into his "Give 'em the axe" chant, directed
toward Cal.The axe was used to decapitate a straw effigy dressed
in Cal's colors, gold and blue. After Stanford's loss, Cal students
nabbed the axe and held it captive until 1930, when Stanford stu
dents recovered it in a daring heist.The rescuers were immortal
ized as the Stanford 21.
Today, the Axe Committee protects the battle weapon and
pumps up the spirit of the student body. Camping out in White
Plaza before the two teams crash helmets, the committee marks
each hour leading to the game with the sounding of a train whis
