# Art exhibits education past
## "American ABC" shows struggle to define 19th century culture 
### SARAH DOUGLAS 
As students across the country head back to school,
it's unlikely any of them feel the weight of a burgeoning
democracy's future on their shoulders. But a Farm-grown
art exhibit is showing Americans of all ages just how
much heavier the expectations of a maturing nation are
than a backpack full of textbooks.
The exhibit, American ABC: Childhood in 19th-cen
tury America, debuted last February at Stanford's own
Cantor Arts Center, a labor of love for American Art Cu
rator Claire Perry. The show "graduated" from the Stan
ford campus last May and traveled to the Smithsonian
American Art Museum in Washington, D.C. for that
gallery's grand re-opening in July. Visitors to the D.C. mu
seum for that month totaled over 140,000.

The exhibition takes
Americans back to a
school of art preoccu
pied with none other
than school itself. More
specifically, paintings by
Winslow Homer,
Thomas Eakins, George
Catlin, Eastman John
son and other famous
19th-century American
artists tell of a country's

preoccupation with educating the future generation. De
pictions of rural hoys, young girls, rebellious youths and
immigrant children demonstrate a struggle to define so
cial ideals for different social strata.
Elizabeth Broun, director of the Smithsonian Ameri
can Art Museum, said that Perry's clarity of organization
makes the collection's message clear. American ABC im
bues the viewer with a sense of how and why these vari
ous categories of American children are subjected to dis
parate artistic treatments. Tease out the differences, she
said, and"the future of the nation begins to fall into
place."
The Smithsonian American Art Museum strives to
feature art that acts as a window into our nation's history.
"This show helped me understand the difference be
tween the generation that fought the Revolutionary War
and the generation that had to build upon those ideals."
Broun continued.
Senior Gabe Recchia, who visited Cantor with his cre
ative writing class, said the exhibit evokes comparisons
between education in the 19th century and today.
"It made me reflect on the strong sense of history that
comes with the American school system, and that's real
ly not something you think very much about anymore,"
Recchia said.
In addition to paintings by numerous lauded Ameri-

history that conies with the American

school system. 1 - Senior Gabe Recchia

can artists, the exhibit includes illustrated children's
books, like Mark Twain's Huck Finn, Noah Webster's El
ementary Spelling Book, McGuffey's readers and ABC
primers. I lowever. perhaps the most popular aspect of
American ABC is its interactive school-room creation,
"School's In/School's Out."
Modeled after the 1873 Winslow Homer painting
Country School, the meticulously fashioned room is a far
cry from its two-dimensional inspiration and comes com
plete with various period actors playing historical figures.
While at Stanford, Frederick Douglas, Mark Twain and
I larriet Jacobs visited the schoolhouse.
ITie last figure, author of "Autobiography of a Slave
Girl," was played by Mary 1 lansen, an administrative as
sociate in the School of Medicine. Hansen, who described
her audience as a mixture of retired persons, tourists and
schoolchildren, enjoyed being part of an exhibit not only
presenting the facts of American history, "but also trying
to give an appreciation of what it felt like to be a part of
that time."

Now at the Smithsonian, a strict country schoolmarm
gives weekly lessons in the

room.
According to Broun, the
Smithsonian school-room has
proven "enormously popular
with families,parents and chil
dren who have loved the way
the interactive educational
components link them back to
the artwork."
Education is not only the sub
ject of American ABC, but the

purpose behind its cross-country travels.
"It is a way of disseminating our research elsewhere
and making the projects accessible at places other than
Stanford — all part of our educational mission" said
Bernard Barry te, chief curator of the Cantor Arts Center.
"Once we develop an exhibition and have a concept, we
contact other institutes that we believe or hope will have
an interest."
The Smithsonian American Art Museum receives 120
or more such proposals each year, according to Broun,
but can show only two or three.
Proposals are reviewed at numerous levels of admin
istration, from the director to various curators, all of
which weigh in with their opinion of the project.
"It is almost like American Idol." Broun said, with the
proposals "being voted in again and again."
But Perry's handling of Smithsonian exhibits at Can
tor in the past, as well her impressive previous major ex
hibition. Pacific Arcadia, gave her a leg up among the ad
ministrators at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.
Broun admitted,"we were eager to hear about this proj
ect from the very beginning."
American ABC will hit the road once more,ending its
Washington D.C. run Oct. 1, and then traveling to the
Portland Museum of Art in Maine, where it will remain
until January.
