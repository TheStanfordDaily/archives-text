# STUDY IN STYLE
## Avoiding the Library with a jolt Off-campus hot spots abound. Check out ways to avoid the campus – with coffee. 
### RICARDO GILB 
Why study off campus, you ask? Why not go to the
CoHo, to the LaIR, to Meyer, to Green, to all of the hal
lowed spots where such scholars as Tiger Woods must
have studied? Why go out into the treacherous environ
ment of Palo Alto only to be lost in anonymity? For
starters, there's my usual reason — that you don't want
anyone to know exactly what it is you're studying. They
would find out that the reason you are full of brilliant
comments during dinner is that you spend your days read
ing books called"'The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ameri
can Literature" and "Classical Music for Dummies." (I
don't even want to imagine the shame, the terrible shame,
of exposure! Thank God no one reads this newspaper.)
Oh, but maybe you don't read such smut. Maybe you
read only fine works of literature. Well, it's time you faced
the truth: reading those wonderful IHUM books at Stan
ford marks you immediately as a freshman, but off-cam
pus, reading those same books makes you... an intellectu
al! So find a friend with a car,or find a friend who happens
to drive the Marguerite,or find a friend who has a helicop
ter and who knows how to park it in the middle of Palo

Alto. Well ... I guess you could just hop on your bike if
faced with no alternatives. And point your wheels
(whichever kind they may be) towards the following
places:
Happy Donuts. 3916 El Camino Real. (650) 843-0658
It's not a coffee shop, but a donut shop, with donuts the
way they ought to be — weighing about a pound each,
unlike those puffed fluff balls that Krispy Kreme spits out.
It isn't pretty, but it's open 24 hours and serves plenty of
coffee, meaning that this isn't so much the place to relax
on a Saturday as a place to desperately attempt to keep
yourself awake with chocolate eclairs and caffeine at 5
a.m. when your paper is due at 10 (that's a.m.), and since
it has free wireless access, you con finish at 9:59 and still e
mail it in by the deadline.
Printer's Inc. Cafe, 320 California Ave., across from
Antonio's Nuthouse. (650) 323-3347
California Avenue is the center of Palo Alto's middle
aged art scene.The Cafe itself has a gallery of art produced
by locals, and across from it is a great store for photogra
phers. Down the block, there are a few printing presses.
Since this is Palo Alto and not Greenwich Village, the
artistic area is also full of California spirituality — in
cluding a center for meditation and the Creative Aware
ness Project, a non-profit committed to researching the
nature of consciousness. Even if you find it all a little silly.
