# 5 road trips from Stanford in 1 hour or less
## 
### 
Expansive as the Stanford campus may be — and
busy bees that we sometimes are — it can be nice to
_^_jl eave the Farm for the wide world that exists outside
Stanford's palm-tree-lined walkways. The following is a
chronological log of the road-trips I took with a friend this
summer — with destinations boasting driving times of an
hour or less from campus.

Distance and time: Located in
San Francisco, about 32 miles
away from the Oval. Take Inter
state-280 North to the King Street
exit, go left on 3rd, and left again
on Cieary Street Drive. Approxi
mately one hour, including time to
find parking.
If you were to walk by, you
wouldn't know what you were
missing inside The Redwood
Room because there is no indica
tion of its existence on the street.
But we have decided to share this

secret — the lounge is on the cor
ner of Geary and Taylor, inside the
large, unmarked, swinging doors
of the ("lift I lotel. across the street
from the Warwick Hotel.
I felt as though as was being
watched by the walls in the rich,
red-laden, dark yet glowing room.
Beautiful women in black cocktail
dresses and men in well-tailored
suits were not the only ones with
their eyes on us. There was some
thing about the walls ... the paint
ings. After 20 minutes, 1 saw a fig-

The Redwood Room Lounge

ure in a portrait blink and realized
that the art was not painted from
oils, swept smooth centuries ago.
Instead, seven tlat plasma screens
stream ghost-like videos of vari
ous characters watching the ob
server.
A careful ear will hear five lan
guages and a trained palate will
enjoy the finest of food and drink.
I cannot speak highly enough of
the chair in Hie Living Room.

The Golden Gate Bridge

Distance and time: Also located
in San Francisco, about 55 miles
from the Oval. Take 1-280 North.
Follow signs to 1 lighway 1.01, which
turns into the Golden Gate Bridge.
Cross the bridge and take the first
exit. Park at the Vista Point. Approx
imately 47 minutes ... with pirates at
the helm.
First word on our Lady Golden
and I feel a bit guilty offering this
advice, which 1 have never taken —
walk it after you park. Don't hesitate
to walk on the Pacific side, if the sun
is shining and the ocean isn't blan

keted by the famous San Franciscan
fog. Ignore the signs asking you to
cross on the opposite pedestrian
side; the yelps from hostile bicyclists
are worth the sight of the open, sail
boat-free water.
On our visit it was too chilly for a
stroll. Next time, we'll bring some
thing warmer. Stanford entrepre
neurs with a penchant for sweat
shirts, take note of the prospering in
dustry ... those who cater to naive
tourists do well.
Exiting the Vista Point, go North
on Highway 101, take the Mar

Monte exit and follow signs to 101
South. On your way back South,
take the very last exit before the
bridge, which will point you towards
the I leadlands. An abandoned army
camp sits atop a hill, nose to nose
with the Golden Gate towers, offer
ing a sweeping view of the
city, as well as a spook for those who
venture up the path at night.Truth or
dare? Dare: play hide and go seek in
the abandoned corridors.
Just over the hill is Chronchite
Beach. Speaking of beaches ...

Half Moon Bay

Distance and time: Take 1-280
North, exit onto 92 West and drive
for about 32 minutes to Half
Moon Bay,about 22 miles north of
the Oval.
I was surprised by how quickly
we arrived at the town of Half
Moon Bay. I would take my books
there and study for an afternoon,
without feeling guilty for wasting
time or petrol. It is a beautiful
drive. Small plant nurseries line
the road and at this time of year
you can purchase pumpkins or

strawberries sold at the end of
small dirt driveways. We bought
ours from an ancient, tattered Ital
ian named Domenico and prom
ised to come back soon. But we
haven't yet had the chance. If you
see him, tell him we'll be by in no
time.
We had barely crossed the San
Andreas Fault when we drove
over the wooded hills and saw the
beach. You need not have a spe
cific plan when venturing to Half
Moon Bay. There are a few very

cozy coffee shops in the down
town area and beaches at the end
of every westerly road.
When Highway 92 ends at Half
Moon Bay,go South on Highway 1
if you would like to continue to
our next stop — Santa Cruz. On
the way, you will surely notice in
triguing dirt pull-outs on the
beach side of the road. Pull over
when you feel compelled. Climb
out on the cliffside; there lies the
raging sea.

Santa Cruz

Distance and time from Half
Moon Bay: Take Highway 1 South
for about 60 miles, which will take
approximately an hour.
Distance and time from the
Oval: lake 280 South and then head
Weston Highway 17 at the junction.
You'll travel about 46 miles, which
will take roughly 45 minutes.
The other day we were sitting at a
small cafe in downtown Palo Alto
when an unexpected visitor joined
us for espresso. He was from Santa

Cruz and I think he was not atypical
of the town. From Italy, he was living
on the California coast, surfing and
designing jewelry — he seemed to
me to be quite the epicurean. And,
he invited us dancing — they do that
down there.
This is why we visit Santa Cruz:
For the people. When we got there,
we stopped to listen to a man named
David sing us a half hour's worth of
original love tunes. We asked him
how long he played each night and

he said,"Until I've made $4."
Also in downtown Santa Cruz on
Pacific Avenue is Chocolate, a cafe
that serves four types of hot choco
late (we recommend the Sofia),a hat
shop (perfect for the horse races)
and a vintage clothing store called
Cognito at the far end. The beach
culture surrounding Santa Cruz is
magical, not to mention the surf.

Skyline Boulevard

Distance and time: Very close.
If you are feeling restless, and you
have a car (or a friend with a car), it is
not difficult to catch a breath of fresh
air off campus. We are surrounded by
hills. Driving North on 1-280, exit on
Highway 92 West and then go left

onto Highway 35, commonly known
as Skyline Boulevard. I've heard
rumor of bikers that make this trek
on a regular basis to admire the
winding, wooded wilderness found
there. Some pause at the bottom of
one of the many hills to have a re

laxed bite at Alice's Restaurant —
you can't miss it.
As an added bonus, on the way
up 1-280 there are two Vista Points
which offer beautiful views of the
pristine and wooded San Andreas
Fault Reservoir.

There is no need to feel claustrophobic while attending school at
Stanford. In case of panic, always leave campus. There is quiet
outside — stars at night and many moons.

The Golden Gate Bridge

Distance and time: Also located
in San Francisco, about 55 miles
from the Oval. Take 1-280 North.
Follow signs to 1 lighway 1.01, which
turns into the Golden Gate Bridge.
Cross the bridge and take the first
exit. Park at the Vista Point. Approx
imately 47 minutes ... with pirates at
the helm.
First word on our Lady Golden
and I feel a bit guilty offering this
advice, which 1 have never taken —
walk it after you park. Don't hesitate
to walk on the Pacific side, if the sun
is shining and the ocean isn't blan

keted by the famous San Franciscan
fog. Ignore the signs asking you to
cross on the opposite pedestrian
side; the yelps from hostile bicyclists
are worth the sight of the open, sail
boat-free water.
On our visit it was too chilly for a
stroll. Next time, we'll bring some
thing warmer. Stanford entrepre
neurs with a penchant for sweat
shirts, take note of the prospering in
dustry ... those who cater to naive
tourists do well.
Exiting the Vista Point, go North
on Highway 101, take the Mar

Monte exit and follow signs to 101
South. On your way back South,
take the very last exit before the
bridge, which will point you towards
the I leadlands. An abandoned army
camp sits atop a hill, nose to nose
with the Golden Gate towers, offer
ing a sweeping view of the
city, as well as a spook for those who
venture up the path at night.Truth or
dare? Dare: play hide and go seek in
the abandoned corridors.
Just over the hill is Chronchite
Beach. Speaking of beaches ...

Half Moon Bay

Distance and time: Take 1-280
North, exit onto 92 West and drive
for about 32 minutes to Half
Moon Bay,about 22 miles north of
the Oval.
I was surprised by how quickly
we arrived at the town of Half
Moon Bay. I would take my books
there and study for an afternoon,
without feeling guilty for wasting
time or petrol. It is a beautiful
drive. Small plant nurseries line
the road and at this time of year
you can purchase pumpkins or

strawberries sold at the end of
small dirt driveways. We bought
ours from an ancient, tattered Ital
ian named Domenico and prom
ised to come back soon. But we
haven't yet had the chance. If you
see him, tell him we'll be by in no
time.
We had barely crossed the San
Andreas Fault when we drove
over the wooded hills and saw the
beach. You need not have a spe
cific plan when venturing to Half
Moon Bay. There are a few very

cozy coffee shops in the down
town area and beaches at the end
of every westerly road.
When Highway 92 ends at Half
Moon Bay,go South on Highway 1
if you would like to continue to
our next stop — Santa Cruz. On
the way, you will surely notice in
triguing dirt pull-outs on the
beach side of the road. Pull over
when you feel compelled. Climb
out on the cliffside; there lies the
raging sea.

Santa Cruz

Distance and time from Half
Moon Bay: Take Highway 1 South
for about 60 miles, which will take
approximately an hour.
Distance and time from the
Oval: lake 280 South and then head
Weston Highway 17 at the junction.
You'll travel about 46 miles, which
will take roughly 45 minutes.
The other day we were sitting at a
small cafe in downtown Palo Alto
when an unexpected visitor joined
us for espresso. He was from Santa

Cruz and I think he was not atypical
of the town. From Italy, he was living
on the California coast, surfing and
designing jewelry — he seemed to
me to be quite the epicurean. And,
he invited us dancing — they do that
down there.
This is why we visit Santa Cruz:
For the people. When we got there,
we stopped to listen to a man named
David sing us a half hour's worth of
original love tunes. We asked him
how long he played each night and

he said,"Until I've made $4."
Also in downtown Santa Cruz on
Pacific Avenue is Chocolate, a cafe
that serves four types of hot choco
late (we recommend the Sofia),a hat
shop (perfect for the horse races)
and a vintage clothing store called
Cognito at the far end. The beach
culture surrounding Santa Cruz is
magical, not to mention the surf.

Skyline Boulevard

Distance and time: Very close.
If you are feeling restless, and you
have a car (or a friend with a car), it is
not difficult to catch a breath of fresh
air off campus. We are surrounded by
hills. Driving North on 1-280, exit on
Highway 92 West and then go left

onto Highway 35, commonly known
as Skyline Boulevard. I've heard
rumor of bikers that make this trek
on a regular basis to admire the
winding, wooded wilderness found
there. Some pause at the bottom of
one of the many hills to have a re

laxed bite at Alice's Restaurant —
you can't miss it.
As an added bonus, on the way
up 1-280 there are two Vista Points
which offer beautiful views of the
pristine and wooded San Andreas
Fault Reservoir.

There is no need to feel claustrophobic while attending school at
Stanford. In case of panic, always leave campus. There is quiet
outside — stars at night and many moons.





Expansive as the Stanford campus may be — and
busy bees that we sometimes are — it can be nice to
_^_jl eave the Farm for the wide world that exists outside
Stanford's palm-tree-lined walkways. The following is a
chronological log of the road-trips I took with a friend this
summer — with destinations boasting driving times of an
hour or less from campus.

Without further adieu...

Distance and time: Located in
San Francisco, about 32 miles
away from the Oval. Take Inter
state-280 North to the King Street
exit, go left on 3rd, and left again
on Cieary Street Drive. Approxi
mately one hour, including time to
find parking.
If you were to walk by, you
wouldn't know what you were
missing inside The Redwood
Room because there is no indica
tion of its existence on the street.
But we have decided to share this

secret — the lounge is on the cor
ner of Geary and Taylor, inside the
large, unmarked, swinging doors
of the ("lift I lotel. across the street
from the Warwick Hotel.
I felt as though as was being
watched by the walls in the rich,
red-laden, dark yet glowing room.
Beautiful women in black cocktail
dresses and men in well-tailored
suits were not the only ones with
their eyes on us. There was some
thing about the walls ... the paint
ings. After 20 minutes, 1 saw a fig-
