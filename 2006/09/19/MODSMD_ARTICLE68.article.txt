## Frosh frequently asked questions We've been there, and we're here to make moving in a little bit easier 
### TAM VO 
Despite all the staff members who have been hired to
make your life easier, all the "informative" presentations
scheduled for your benefit and all the advice given to you
about everything by just about everyone, you may still
have some unanswered questions. But it's highly doubtful
that they are any of the following:
Q: I really want to organize a water fight in my hallway
but I spent all my money on Febreze and ramen noodles.
Can Absolute Fun help me out?
A: While the ASSU's Absolute Fun program can't fund
individual requests, the SHPRC can hook you up with 12
free condoms each quarter (feel free to mix and match the
condoms with lubes, dental dams and massage oil. all of
which come in a variety of colors and flavors).
While there, you can ask for a demonstration of how to
put on a condom using only your mouth.They're probably
more durable than any water balloons you could buy at
Safeway. And they're FREE.
Q: My best friend from high school at 1 larvard is al
ready rushing Omega Beta Zeta Kappa Omicron Alpha. 1
want to be his long-distance frat brother, but 1 hear that
there's no rush. What gives?

A;There is no fall rush for freshman, true, hut that's be
cause Stanford doesn't want to be like Harvard. We al
ready both have mascots that are named after similar col
ors: isn't that enough? Actually, this is probably because
the administration wants you to use this time to get to
know your fellow freshmen. Hie re will be plenty of time
for brotherly love and paddling later in your Stanford ca
reer. You can start training now for Smashy Smashy and
keg rolling, which happen during spring rush. kids.
Q: The administration keeps telling me, "We did not
make a mistake in admitting you." I low can they be so
sure?
A: Well, while we don't know what your parents were
thinking when they conceived you, we're pretty sure
you're not an admit mistake. You're here.aren't you? Calm
down. Make the most of your freshman year. They would
n't have allowed you to move in if you weren't supposed to
be here. They would still take your tuition payment,
though.
(J: My 1-1 lum requires us to read,like,2o books, includ
ing some stuff that I'm pretty sure isn't in English. I low do
1 manage all of that on top of my other classes?
A: I la. Ihum reading. No one actually reads for 1-1 lum.
Q: How do 1 navigate through the Intersection of
Death without becoming part of a five-bike pileup?
A: Located at the corner of the Quad by the Education
building and the Clock Tower, the Intersection of Death is
where you'll witness smart kids get
ting into hike accidents every day. Re
searchers are busy studying the phe
nomenon. which continues to baffle
them: Is I.Q. negatively correlated to
bike-riding ability?
Actually surviving the intersec

t*on is just a matter of paying atten
tion to your surroundings and having
common sense. People will not notice
you until they're about to crash into
you, so begin screaming i DO NOT
HAVE BRAKES!" as you cruise
down the hill by the Bookstore. Fol
low any groups of people going in
your direction, and try to cushion
yourself in the middle. If anything
happens, they will get hit first.
If you still can't ride a bike, opt for
a longboard or skateboard, which you

can train yourself to jump off of when
it appears an accident is inevitable. If
all else fails, you might want to wear a
helmet, at the risk of being mistaken
for a sketchy grad student.
Q: Will everyone know that I'm a
freshman?
A: You're the only ones standing
in the middle of the Quad trying to
find Jamba Juice on your campus
map. Looking confused. While wear
ing your keys on red lanyards around
your necks. It's kind of obvious.
