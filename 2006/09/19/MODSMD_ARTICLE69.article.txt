Feeling overwhelmed by the number of classes to
choose from freshman year? I lere, various students have
offered their sage advice and compiled a list of sugges
tions for interpreting the Stanford bulletin.
The following arc classes to take:
Psych 1. Introduction to Psychology - By far one of the
most popular freshman classes. Learn about your room
mate's odd behavior after dinner, and why you're the
type of person who...
Stats 60. Introduction to Statistics. If the idea of
midterms scare you, this is most certainly the class for
you. Not only does it fulfill the stats requirement for al
most all majors, the majority of the grade is based on
weekly quizzes. Relax during midterm week. Take Stats
60.
Econ 1A and IB: Introduction to Economics A and B.
Iliis 2-quarter series of econ is a fairly generalized way to
learn about why consumers choose certain products and
how firms make decisions. No math is required! Si) for all
those who are scared of math, but still want to learn about
supply and demand, this is the class for you. And for all
the math-lovers, you still need to take these intros to get
to the calc-based econ (sorry).

Introductory Seminars. Take as many IntroSems as
you can. Don't be intimidated by small classes with very
important and world-renowned profs. This is a great op
portunity to get to know profs that may write your recs in
the future. They also have a harder time not giving you
that A when they know you.
Dance 40. Introduction to Dance and Movement: Liq
uid Flow. Nervous for the first party of the year, when you
want to dance with the girl down the hall but can't carry
a beat? Take Dance 40! Get credit for learning how to
look great on the dance floor.
Chem 33. Structure and Reactivity. Don't avoid chem
classes just because you aren't pre-med! .lump on the
bandwagon and join the party! Not only will you have
mandatory weekly chem sections with (by tar) the most
attractive department on campus, but you'll also enjoy
taking a final distributed by one of the most rigid and
hard-ass departments on campus. To all those pre-meds
out there, that was for you.
BioSci2o. Introduction to Brain and Behavior. For all
those Bio and Hum√üio majors frustrated with the
thought of waiting an entire year until you can walk into
the core, this is most certainly the class for you! Satiate
your desire to learn all about neuron structure and func
tion. Good news: no prereqs for this class!
Music 74C. Classical Guitar Class. Stanford offers gui
tar? Yes, along with a number of other music lesson class
es. Is it okay if I've never picked up a guitar? Yes. intro
ductory levels are offered.
Athletics: Rock Body Bootcamp. Get in shape.
Enough said.
