## Press rates diversity, LGBT highly Stanford tops magazine lists, but what does it all mean? 
### SARAH DOUGLAS 
Imagine your idea of Stanford University
was illustrated in Paint By Number.
Look for the "4th" and color in our standing
among peer American colleges. Find the "7th"
and fill in our ranking in the list of best colleges
for African-Americans. For "top 20." shade in
our status as a queer-friendly school. Add in a
few nuanced strokes, brush in "Ist" to indicate
our status as having the Overall I lappiest Stu
dents, and voila.
"Reputation is like a mosaic." said David
Demarest, vice president of Public Affairs at
Stanford. "It is drawn from many different di
mensions; then, somehow, it sort of congeals
into a snapshot of an idea that people have of
Stanford."
But is the portrait of Stanford University, or
any other university listed in these rankings, an
accurate one? Iliat's the question today's stu
dents ask themselves as they wade through the
information overload of college research. Mag
azines like U.S. News and World Report claim
to simplify the process by quantifying numer
ous factors into a simple rankings list.
U.S. News and World Report, which takes
into account various "indicators of academic
quality," placed Stanford fourth this summer in
its annual college rankings, tied with Cal Tech
and MIT. In case you're curious, "indicators of
academic quality" boil down to peer assess-
ment scores, student/faculty ratios,
class size, selectivity. SAT/ACT per
centiles, alumni giving, financial re
sources, graduation and retention
rates, and percentage of faculty who
work full time.
ITiough such rankings may in
deed affect a student's decision to at
tend
Stanford. Demarest emphatically
denied that the University takes any
specific steps to gain a higher rank.
"We never really subscribed to
the U.S. News and World Report the
sis," Demarest said. "There may be a
best university for an individual stu
dent, but there is not a "best" univer
sity in the total sense of the word."
Rather than defining the best uni
versity for all students, some maga
zines compile lists of universities
suited to a racial subset of students.
Hiis year, Black Enterprise maga
zine named Stanford University the
seventh-best college for African
Americans. Those rankings reflected
the percentage of black undergradu
ate students, graduation rates, and
evaluations of social and academic
environment by African American
professionals in higher education.
Stanford has been the highest
ranked historically non-black col
lege since the list's conception in

1999. But, for the first time ever, I lar
vard University ranked higher than
Stanford on the 2007 list, jumping
from last year's 11th to this year's
fourth best college for African
Americans.
"I'm surprised Harvard is ranked
above us this year," said Jan Barker-
Alexander. assistant dean of stu
dents and director of the Black Com
munity Center. But like Demarest,
she maintained that Stanford is mo
tivated by a deeper impetus than
rankings.
Barker-Alexander lauded Stan
ford's cultural programs like a Black
Community Service Center, an eth
nic theme house, an African and
African American studies major.
Committee on Black Performing
Arts, and the Martin Luther King Jr.
Papers Project. The combination of
programs, unique to Stanford, shows
a celebration of black culture un
precedented in any Ivy League
schools, she said. Harvard, for exam
ple, does not have both a community
center and an ethnic theme house.
"There's a culture of academic
excellence, understanding, and re
spect for diversity within diversity in
the black community at Stanford,"
Barker-Alexander said. "Stanford
has a special community that's
woven into the fabric of the institu
tion."
Stanford's celebration of other
communities on campus continues
to garner the University spots in
other specialized college lists. 'ITie

Advocate, a LGBT news site, has
published "The Advocate College
Guide for LGBT Students," a book
that profiles 100 of the country's best
campuses for lesbian, gay. bisexual
and transgender students. After re
viewing Stanford policies, the cam
pus climate and reading undergradu
ate and graduate testimonials, the
magazine placed Stanford in its top
20. Ben Davidson, director of the
LGBT Community Resources Cen
ter, said he is glad to be included in
the book and hopes that it will be a
useful tool for high school students,
but warned against putting too much
stock in the publication.
"The book isn't a ranking per se,
but of course all such assessments
should always be taken with a grain
of salt," he said.
Hispanic Magazine also named
Stanford the nation's sixth Best Col
lege for Latinos, citing academic ex
cellence (on par with U.S. News' cri
teria) along with Hispanic enrol
ment. cultural programs. Hispanic
support programs and percentage of
Hispanic faculty.
Last, but certainly not least, is the
icing on the cake of Stanford's col
lege rankings. In its guide "The Best
361 Colleges,"The Princeton Review
found that Stanford has the fifth
highest "Overall Happiest Stu
dents." Last year, the University stu
dents ranked as happiest. It just goes
to show that all the political maneu
vering in the world can't buy this
kind of weather.
