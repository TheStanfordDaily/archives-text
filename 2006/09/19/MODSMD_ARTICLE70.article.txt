# And you think you're embarrassing? Awkward moments shared
## 
### BETSY CONGDON 
As New Student Orientation kicks off, a
whole new class of Stanford students will
begin racking up embarrassing moments
and outrageous experiences. We are all
nervous that we'll be the kid who falls face
first off the skateboard or breaks up with
her significant other during I HUM lecture.
But awkward moments happen to all of us
and most are soon forgotten or chuckled
off. liere is a sampling of incidents that have
happened to upperclassmen here on the
Farm, so that when you have that inevitable
moment — or a hundred moments —
hopefully you can take a step back and start
laughing at yourself.
Admit Weekend Surprise
"During Admit Weekend 2(K)2, I was
horrified by the idea of taking a shower in
the public bathroom where someone could
walk in on me naked at any time. Thus. I
waited until the middle of the day when the
dorm was empty to take my first Stanford
shower. I had made it through the shower,
relieved, and was drying off behind the cur
tain when, all of a sudden, my RoHo's

roommate walked in on me! I screamed and
she apologized, saying she had heard the
faucet dripping and was going to turn it off.
The rest of Admit Weekend was uncomfort
able and I couldn't wait to go home to my
own private bathroom."
So you're the in-laws
"It was Parents Weekend freshman year
and, boy, was I nervous. Today was the day
that 1 was going to meet the in-laws. 1 went
over to my girlfriend's dorm and took a
quick stop in the bathroom. While 1 was
standing at the urinal when a middle aged
woman walked in the door. We had one of
those awkward conversations about being
in the wrong restroom before 1 washed my
hands and headed for my girlfriend's room.
Upon walking in, my girlfriend went to in
troduced me to her mom. All I could say was
Actually, we've already met.'"
Fall fashion
"My mom and dad gave me what they
thought was a 'skirt' for my 19th birthday.
L ttle did they (or I) know that it wasn't a
sk rt.but actually a blouse! It was a strapless
shi. t, the kind that cinches right underneath
the bustline and flares out a little...you

"One evening 1 was having sex with my boyfriend
on the lofted bed when we heard...'

know, the type that looks like maternity
clothes and are really in style now. Anyway,
my mom tells me it's a skirt, so 1 do what she
says and wear it as one. It is kind of una>ttl
fortable, and keeps riding up all the time,
hut nevertheless it is still super cute and I
decide wear it out around campus despite
the constant wedgies. One spring day I'm
strutting my stuff in my new "skirt at Moon
beans, when I turn around in line to see a
girl wearing the same thing, only she looks
ten times better in it because she was wear
ing it the way it was obviously supposed to
be worn...as a shirt! 'Well that's one way to
wear it,' she said, as she snatched her iced
mocha."
Nice to meet you
"I came home at midnight from the
opera one night at the beginning of Winter

Quarter my sophomore year. I walked into
the room, flipped on the fluorescent light,
and there was my brand new roommate —
who I had never even seen before, mind you
— having sex with her boyfriend. But hey,
at least she stopped for a second to intro
duce herself."
Bringing new meaning to going down
"I had a tiny single sophomore year and
had no choice but to loft my bed in order to
fit my desk in the same room. Getting the
heavy metal mattress frame lofted was a
huge ordeal, and — with only one screw in
each hole — it was not exactly stable. I was
convinced that it would topple down one
day and kill whoever was sitting under it.
One evening 1 was having sex with my
boyfriend on the lofted bed when we heard
a metallic clink it sounded like a screw had

fallen out. We jumped off of the bed.
grabbed clothes and opened the door to the
hall to get out of the way of the falling bed.
It turned out that the clink was keys and not
a screw, but the mood was ruined."
IVliitoriial love
"My friends and I were walking around
112 ull Moon on the Quad. One of the guys
was local and he had met up with a few of his
friends from high school who happened to
be home. We had been there for about an
hour when one of his friends said to him
Isn't that your mom?' Sure enough it was.
See yon at office hours
"I had just hooked up with a fresh
man who lived in Branner. and believe me,
as a junior, this should have been bad
enough. Needless to say I had had a bit to
drink earlier in the night. Of course, on my
trek home I run into my Humßio professor,
out jogging at an ungodly hour of the morn
ing. Just play it off, I thought to myself as he
stopped to say hi. And it would have worked
too, it I hadn't been holding my bra in my
hand. Yikes."
