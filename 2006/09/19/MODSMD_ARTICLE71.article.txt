dent Elizabeth I leng and Vice Presi
dent Lauren Graham will take the
helm and try to fulfill campaign
promises like making Dead Weak
dead and reviving the Mausoleum
Party.
Band. the. Known less for their
music and more for their crazy
attire and scrambling antics on the
football field, the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) provides unconvention
al forms of entertainment across the
campus and sports arenas. The
Band's unprecedented stunts have
resulted in bans from places like
Notre Dame University, the state of
Oregon, Disneyland and CBS. just to
name a few. in addition to an exten
sion of their alcohol probation until
2007. But that doesn't stop students
from drunkenly racing across cam
pus on the annual band run. dancing
along to Stanford's fight song "All
Right Now."
Claw. A focal point at the center of
campus, the Claw is a nickname
for the fountain between the Book
store and Old Union. A favorite for
fountain hoppers 011 hot days, the
Claw draws its name from its con
torted shape. Regardless of the bru
tality its name might invoke, the
Claw is a popular spot to lounge and
an important marker 011 campus.
Daily. The. Providing students
with the most widespread cov
erage of campus news and Cardinal
sports,The Stanford Daily is home to
a dedicated band of sleep-deprived
journalists. You can look for The
Daily in locations all across campus,
particularly rolled up in balls 011 the
floors of Mem Aud 011 Sunday nights
following the ritual paper fights at
Flicks.
Eating Clubs. As an alternative to
large dining halls, some student

housing gives residents an opportu
nity to join a themed eating estab
lishment known as an eating club.
Available to Toyon and Suites resi
dents. eating clubs have a personal
chef for their members and a reputa
tion for some of the best food on
campus.
Frat parties. Saturated with the
aura of horny and overworked
students, these campus-wide events
are a popular hangout for fostering
fleeting and often regretful relation
ships. Under the influence of beer
and rap blaring across a dimmed
dance floor, freshman girls become
susceptible to sketchy frat boys and
roofie coladas.
Graduate Student Council. Also
known as the ( JSC, the graduate
student version of the ASSIJ has a
less controversial, lower-key image
than its undergraduate counterpart.
It serves the needs of the graduate
community on issues like housing
and cost of living.
Hoover Institution. A conserva
tive think tank located by the
phallic-looking monument 011 cam
pus. the Hoover Institution is home
to eminent political figures like Sec
retary of State Colin Powell and Na
tional Security Adviser Condoleeza
Rice.The 1 loover's political slant has
historically been controversial given
its ties to a university with a dispro
portionately liberal student body.
During the run-up to the war in Iraq,
many students directed their opposi
tion at Hoover Fellows who com
prised a quarter of the Defense Poli
cy Board - a key advising group to
top members at the Department of
Defense. In spite of protests and
harsh criticism of the institution for
being "hawkish." the Hoover Institu
tion continues to attract a plethora of
politicians, journalists and notewor
thy figures for campus-wide panels
and discussions.

1 -Center. A nickname for the Bech
tel International Center, located
near Tresidder Union. It provides
programming and resources for in

ternational and foreign-born stu
dents and scholars.

drink reportedly a favorite for
those recovering from hangovers.
Jamba Juice and its wide assortment
of flavors are a tempting diversion
when walking around Tresidder.
Kairos. Part of the co-op commu
nity. which features the rare
sight of students cooking and clean
ing for themselves. The co-ops range
from hippie havens like Columbae
and Synergy to the more convention
al international co-op Ham
marskjold. Look for co-opers danc
ing naked through l ull Moon 011 the
Quad.
Lake Lagunita. The irony of the
name comes from the perpetual
lack of water in the weed-covered
field on the east side of campus. If the
rainy season at the beginning of win
ter quarter is particularly heavy, a
few inches of water accumulation
will permit a primitive rafting experi
ence. Such evening get-togethers
tend however to be broken up by
Stanford police concerned with inci
dents of drunken drowning.
Maples Pavilion.The stadium has
been home to many unbeliev
able come-from-behind victories
and fan stampedes. The Sixth Man
Club, composed of students holding
season tickets to home games, start
ed a riot in 2004 after Nick Robinson
made a buzzer-beater 3-point shot
during one of most legendary sea
sons in Stanford's history.
No dating. The common rumor
that there is no dating at Stan
ford stems from a campus plagued
with overcommitted students who
either budget their time to invest in a
marriage-like relationship or settle
for a one-night stand. I lowever. de
bunkers say that the rumor is only
true for those who believe in it. *
Okada. The Asian-themed dorm,
one of four ethnically themed
dorms on campus. The others are
Casa Zapata (Latino), Ujamaa (black), and Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk (Native American).
Palm trees.Though not indigenous to northern Califor
nia, the presence of palm trees contributes to a gener
al envy from East Coast schools that must limit their
botanical ambitions to conifers. Palm Drive, the scenic
entrance to the Stanford campus, is famous for its name
sakes. That's good, as each individual palm tree costs
$30,00() for Stanford to maintain.
Queer. A word that incorporates the many different
members of the LGBT-CRC - lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender Community Resource Center. With dorm
and campus programs dedicated to sexual awareness,
safe sex, and defining one's sexual identity, the LGBT
community plays host to candid discussions about issues
prevalent among young adults.
RAs. Responsible for dorm spirit and organizing social
activities, students continually tout their RAs for a
balance of compassion and coolness. The dedication of
RAs at Stanford is unparalleled, some so involved (and
sketchy) with the students that they violate the red light
policy.
Shibu. Former owner of Ernie's, a Stanford favorite for
quality beverages. As a friendly store clerk who made
friends easily and gave free paraphernalia with purchas
es. Shibu could often be found frequenting campus-wide
parties at Stanford. Shibu went to India at the end of last
year, leaving behind him a legend that will live in the
hearts of Stanford students with every Friday night
Ernie's beer run.
Tree. The Band mascot, though not the official mascot
of the University. Until 1972, the Stanford mascot was
the Indians. But it was abandoned because many consid
ered it racist. Though a number of suggestions and stu-

EBF:
Enchanted Broccoli Forest got its name from Mollie
Katzen's eponymous cook book. Its neighbor Narnia was
almost named "Beyond the Forest of Enchantment," but
Stanford administrators had clamped down by then. The
suggestion was vetoed and the house now bears the
tamer moniker of C. S. Lewis' magical land.

dent-wide initiatives have since tried to change the mas
cot from color Cardinal, no official measure has given
Stanford a new alias. Nonetheless, the beloved Tree con
tinues to play a de facto mascot role during sports events.
Uncle John's Band. One of the largest of the off-cam
pus Dead Houses, which are a cluster of houses in
Palo Alto named after Grateful Dead songs. Undergrad
uate and graduate students can sublet rooms and enjoy
an alternative social community.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education. John
Bravman is responsible for building partnerships
among the various schools and departments on campus.
His office focuses on academic programs, as well as un
dergraduate teaching, advising and research. Bravman
also sponsors lavish BBQs for his charges at Freshman
and Sophomore College, which he oversees.
Women's Community Center. Founded in the 1970s
and currently located in the Fire Truck House, it is
where the needs and interests of Stanford's female stu
dents are met. It is one of six community centers on cam
pus.
Xanadu. One of the most sought-after houses on the
Row. a treasured place of dwelling for those who
enjoy open kitchens and don't mind the hashing. With the
exception of the Native American-themed Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk, a four-class dorm, and fraternities, the Row is
reserved exclusively for upperclassmen with good draw
numbers.

flexible positions, yoga classes have become increas
ingly popular among students who now sport yoga mats
sticking out of school bags.
