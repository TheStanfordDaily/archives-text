# Three's company
## 
### ROXY SASS FRESHMAN SEX GODDESS 
You know the old adage: I\vo's company,
three's a crowd. Well, that's not the case
anymore. Three's the new two, four's the
new three — Roxy likes.
But how does one acquire a threesome with
out creating a Facebook group? This is Roxy's
current dilemma. Everyone else seems to think
that Facebook groups are the best way to get
your significant other in bed with another less
significant other — the original of course being
"If this group reaches 100,(MX) my girlfriend will
have a threesome""). The original guy certainly
has his threesome lined up given that his group
now counts over 340.000 members. Or at least it
did before those prudes at Facebook got rid of it,
at least.
Others, including "If this group reaches
100,000 my girlfriend will become a CRACK
WHORE" and "If this group reaches 100.000
members my girlfriend won't care" and "If this
group reaches 100 my inflatable girlfriend will
have a threesome" are not doing as well.
But we're not talking about all the horny guys
on the Facebook trying to get threesomes, we're
talking about Roxy here. And Roxy needs good
sex. And Roxy could sit around and wait for an
opportunity. But that sounds more pacifist, and
when it comes to getting her pleasure in, Roxy is
definitely NOT a pacifist.
A threesome requires three able-bodied
adults — hopefully very able-bodied. Roxy's all
in — well, let's just say her current beau is all in,
as well — pun certainly intended. But adding a

third person to a duet is much more complicated
than it might originally seem.
Let's examine the playing field when it comes
to hunting down an attractive sex object to be
come the third wheel on a very sexy tricycle. Or
two attractive sex objects to become the third
and fourth wheel on a shagging wagon. The
problem is we don't know how to find number
three. Number four is a mere pipe dream. Where
do we find someone to be our better third?
Trying to organize a threesome is much more
easily imagined than executed. And ohh, does
Roxy have an imagination! Where do we find
someone to partake of the game that three can
play at? Roxy suggests heading over to an after
noon at the Oval. Oh how those boys can play
volleyball with their shirts off.
Then, there are technical, shall we say, "stick
ier" issues to having threesomes, foursomes or
any moresomes: Who's on who? How, when and
where? What if the they're into soft and you're
into hard? Or they enjoy wet willies (inner ear
licking) and foot fetishes? What if they're really
into role playing and can only cum when enticed
by a female decked out in a school girl uniform
a la Rory Gilmore? There are any number of
sexual aberrations that your potential play
mates could be into hand while such aberrations
might be okay with Roxy, she isn't so sure about
her readers.
Another problem? Awkwardness. Assume
that you can find the perfect playmate(s), how
do you interact with that third or fourth person?

If you're the guy and it's a second girl, do you
talk to her the same way you talk to your girl
friend? Roxy knows she would get mad if her
beau talked to another girl the same way. Like
wise, in a foursome situation, she worries what
sound her beau would make when another girl
goes down on him.
Roxy doesn't think people think about the
practical things when it comes to sex among
more than two people.Tell me that orgies aren't
just a logistical nightmare (can you tell Roxy has
never had one?) It would take a genius comput
er scientist to devise the program that would
make it such that all of the rules given by the
God of Sex are followed: 1) every person must
be giving pleasure and 2) every person must be
receiving pleasure 3) and then you might start to
have gender rules.
It's the practical things people don't about,
just like who touches who, when, where and
how?
There's a whole world of things to think
about which is why we need Googlesome- a
matchmaking website for people seeking three
somes, foursomes, fivesomes and beyond, sorted
by age, physical characteristics, sexual prefer
ence and fetishism. Why only find one result for
your classified sex search when you can find mil
lions?!
In the meantime, many horny people/couples
are left out there seeking other horny
people/couples in vain. Roxy's two word solu
tion — swinger's club.
