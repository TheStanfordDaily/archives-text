# Classic, Classy Mexican
## 
### 
ocated less than two miles from
Stanford down El Camino Real,
Celia's Mexican Restaurant is a fine
destination for delicious and moder
ately priced south-of-the-border cuisine. The
family-owned establishment is well furnished
for a restaurant with entrees ranging in price
from $8 to $17. Bright murals adorn the walls
and handsome wooden carvings grace the tops
of the booths, evoking a cantina in the dusty
West more than a century ago.
The food served lives up to the standard set
by the restaurant's decorations. Appetizers
such as quesadillas, nachos and tortilla soup are
all available for the diner seeking a complete
culinary experience, but the entrees themselves
are more than ample for all but the hungriest
patrons.
Popular dishes include Carnitas con Polio and
Polio en Crema, both featuring sauteed chicken

breasts with bell peppers and onions. For those
seeking the taste of mariscos, or seafood, the
Cancun Platter of crab, prawns and chicken is a
favorite. Celia's fajitas are also delicious and are
served piping hot, sizzling and snapping on the
table though they are still on the grill.
Those seeking more conventional fare will
have no trouble at Celia's; the restaurant offers
a "North of the Border" section on their menu,
featuring New York Steak, burgers and chicken
sandwiches. For dessert, split a platter of
Sopapillas, fried tortilla chips with honey cinna
mon and vanilla ice cream.
Service is polite, prompt, and attentive, keep
ing drinks full and clearing "dead" plates unob
trusively. If you're seeking a wide selection of
authentic Mexican cuisine at a price that won't
break the bank, you want to support a Peninsula
business or you just want Mexican food good
and close, Celia's comes highly recommended. â–
