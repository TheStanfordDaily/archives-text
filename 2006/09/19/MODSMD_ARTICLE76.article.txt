If you're seeking first-rate South Asian
dining in the Palo Alto area, look no fur
ther than Darbar Indian Cuisine, recent
ly the winner of the Best of Palo Alto
award for Best Indian Food for the fourth
straight year.
The family-owned establishment, located just
off University Avenue on High Street, is hand
somely furnished with many traditional paintings
gracing the walls.The service is polite and impec
cable, and waiters are happy to recommend good
starting dishes.
And the food is fantastic. If you're starting
with an appetizer, try Vegetable Samosa or
Pakora, onion fritters made with lentil flour. For
something meatier, beef, chicken, fish and prawn
starters are also available.
Most main courses come with Pilau Rice and
a generous serving of Nan bread, useful for
diluting the spicy taste of most of the items on
the menu. The restaurant does a fine job with
the quintessential Indian entree — Chicken
Tikka Masala. This Tandoori chicken, served in
a mild, creamy sauce, is Darbar's most popular

dish. It makes a great entry point for those
unsure about what to order. Also highly recom
mended is the Mango Lassi, a sweet drink made
from mango juice and homemade yogurt. It's
the perfect complement to any meal at
Darbar's.
The more adventurous connoisseur of spicier
foods will find much to enjoy here as well. Order
the Vindaloo and the waiters will warn you,
"That one is spicy." They're not kidding. Whether
you order Chicken, Shrimp, Lamb, Prawn, Beef,
Pork or Vegetable Vindaloo, eat slowly to avoid
sweating. Take advantage of the opportunity to
converse and savor the meal.
Darbar also caters to the vegetarian set with a
wide selection of meatless dishes. In addition to
mixed vegetables in curry sauce, Palak Paneer,
creamed spinach and homemade farmer's
cheese, comes recommended by the manage
ment. Paneer Do Playza, farmer's cheese with
bell peppers, onions and spices, is another good
option.
If you're looking for a dining experience com
pletely different from typical American, Italian
or Mexican fare, stop by Darbar. You won't be
disappointed. ■
