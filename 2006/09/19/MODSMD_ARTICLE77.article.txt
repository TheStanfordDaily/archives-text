# Pricy Prawns Worth Every Penny

### 
The unassuming shopping mall location of Scott's
Seafood doesn't prepare you for the unmistakable
upper-crust aura that hits you as you open the door.
The restaurant exudes casual elegance with soft light
ing, bustling staff dressed in black, and an extremely well
stocked bar. The restaurant's demeanor screams country club,
with a little twist of Californian chill: the dress code is business
casual, and while walk-ins are accepted, a reservation is a good
idea.
As for the food, Scott's Seafood offers very strong renditions of
seafood classics. The fried calamari (served with lemon garlic
sauce, not marinara) has a pleasant texture, and the fresh
Dungeness crab cakes are light, flaky, melt-in-your-mouth
dreams. Appetizers are available in half and full orders, and the
half orders (which run around $8) are plenty big enough to share
between two or three people.
But be forewarned: if your budget is more "shrimp ramen" then
"oysters on the half shell," you might want to consult your financial
advisor before heading to Scott's Seafood. The entrees range
between $18.50 and $35.50 - however, you get what you pay for.The
Seafood Saute (prawns, scallops, and Dungeness crab) was down
right succulent: every piece was ideally browned, the sauce was rich
without being uncomfortably heavy, and the vegetable side was
beautifully crisp and seasoned. The Charbroiled Salmon was tender
and well-grilled, served in a hearty portion. Other signature dishes
