# Southwestern Cooking with a Mexican Accent
## 
### 
Compadres, a family-owned Mexican restau
rant on El Camino Real in Palo Alto, is one
of the more popular restaurants on the
Peninsula for Stanford students. It's so well
liked that The Daily holds its twice-annual banquet
there.
Showcasing Western cooking with a Mexican
accent, the restaurant has a festive ambience and a

comfortable feel. If you
have the chance, sit out
doors. The well-lit out
door patio (one visitor
called it a cabana feel)
has a TV to watch sports
games. And last Saturday,
before the football game
against Navy, servers
wore red shirts that said
"Go Stanford."

Big portions are brought by attentive servers.
Management cites high quality ingredients as key to
good taste. The guacamole is made entirely of fresh

avocados, not from the concentrate or puree that
other Mexican establishments sometimes use to
keep costs low.
Compadres offers standard Mexican fare, but
the Signature Items on the menu are worth a try.
Baja-style fish tacos are tasty. The Carnitas plate
(build-your-own shredded pork tacos) is a
refreshing change from typical chicken or beef
fajitas. And the Tortilla Encrusted Chicken
Breast has a memorable, saucy taste. You might
not expect it from a Mexican restaurant, but the
spare ribs are one of the more popular items on
the menu.
For the over-21 crowd, try Compadres for
happy hour. The restaurant offers deals on good

margaritas and tasty tequila from 4 to 7

Friday rush.
The family-owned enterprise got its
start in Honolulu, Hawaii, and now has
three California locations — Palo Alto,
Napa Valley and Oakland. Compadres
also maintains a thriving concessions
and catering business.They have a stand
in AT&T Park, where the Giants play.

The restaurant also does business with
the University. In the new football stadium, look for
their own branded stand to enjoy some of their clas
sic dishes while cheering on the Card. ■
