# A
						Temple to Meat

### 
It's all about the beef. Looking at the menu you could
kid yourself that the Sundance Steakhouse was more
than just a temple for the worshipping of hunks of meat,
but you'd be wrong. Now, I'm not saying that the rest of
the food is sub-par — far from it. in fact, but more about that

later — no, my point is just that the meat is very, very, very good. And
leaving here without sinking you teeth into a bloody hunk of goodness...
well, it would be like going to Full Moon on the Quad just to watch.
Sundance is not really a place for casual dining. It's a great place to
drag either parents or dates — both will be impressed by the transition
from the dreary depression of the El Caniino strip to a world of dark
wood, subdued lighting and understated elegance that looks like it's
been pulled from the set of a Scorsese gangster movie.
The diverse selection of appetizers includes several house specialties,
from calamari to crab cakes to clam chowder. The latter two are partic
ular standouts. The crisp and crunchy crab cakes come with a mouth
wateringly divine chipotle aioli and, despite my not being a fan of soups,
the multiple award-winning clam chowder is a rich, luxurious treat that
made me switch from reluctant sampler to exuberant scoffer after a sin
gle mouthful.
Then, there was the meat, which was scrumptious. Carnivores can
choose from either the house speciality prime rib (1 recommend the
Shareholder's Cut — 14 oz. of slow cooked, bloody goodness) or the
fine selection of steaks (accompanied by a multitude of sauces — try
the whiskey green peppercorn). Should you shy away from beef,
Sundance also boasts an impressive seafood selection, with swordfish
carrying a solid recommendation from our waiter. Vegetarians might
find themselves a little starved for choice, but quite frankly a steakhouse

is not the place to go for goat
food.
Signature desserts include
the white chocolate creme
brulee and the Mud Pie. The
former was a suitably light fin
ish to a serious meal. The lat
ter, on the other hand, well
that was a more serious
dessert. And damn fine one at
that. Chocolate and biscuit
base, with coffee ice cream
and lathered in whipped
cream. Mmmmm...
For those on a budget the
Sunset Dinner Menu (appe-

tizer and entree from a limited selection, hut including the signature
clam chowder and slow roast prime rib) is yours for a mere $17.95 if
you're seated between spm and 6pm. You would be hard pressed to do
much better for the money.

So there you have it. For the full deal, it ain't cheap. But it's damn
good. Put the Sundance Steakhouse on your list of places to visit before
vou leave Stanford and you won't be disappointed. ■
