# SEIU, Univ. strike deal to end standoff
## 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITER 
Stanford workers voted with 95 per
cent support to ratify a new three-year
contract Sept. 8. Instead of taking a
planned vote that would have authorized
union leaders to call a strike, the Service
Employees International Union (SEIU)
Local 715 accepted a contract that final
izes wage increases at five percent this
year.
I"he agreement came one week after
the previous contract's expiration, .which
left the union's 1,2(X) Stanford workers
working, hut in limbo.
Wage increases, the most contentious
issue debated between the union and Uni
versity in the previous months, were final
ized with ;i four percent increase (and one
percent bonus) effective retroactively to
Sept I Further increases of 3.75 percent
and 3.25 percent will follow in 2(X)7 and
2008. respectively.
Stanford University Workers President
Zev Kvitky said he found the wage in
crease fair.
"It w is a reasonable wage offer that at
least keeps pace with the rising cost of liv
ing." kvitky said.
Although it scored a victory with wage
increases, the union was forced to compro
mise on retirement packages.and the Uni
versity achieved its goal of replacing a de
fined annuity plan for new workers with a
contribution plan that limits long-term lia
bilities Ihe Stanford Contributory Retire
ment Plan (SCRP) will replace the Stan
ford Retirement Annuity Plan (SRAP)ef
fective Jan. 1.2(X>7.
When the contract was previously
opened in February of this year, the union
pushed hard to not implement that pro
gram. believing it would create an unfair,
"two tiered system" of workers. Hie latest
bargaining agreement puts Stanford more
in line with the private sector, which has
been moving toward contribution plans.
"I think many people are displeased
with this decision to implement a two-tier
retirement plan," Kvitky said. "I think,
though, that we would not have been able

to reach an agreement without some guar
antees and improvements on health bene
fits. which kind of made it easier to accept
the total package we were offered on ben
efits. However, we clearly are ultimately
not in agreement with Stanford to have a
two-tier plan."
These new health care benefits are part
of Stanford's Health Care Assistance Pro
gram. The newly implemented program
subsidizes "an employee's regular contri
bution for employee-plus-dependent cov
erage under the least expensive medical
plan." according to a University press re
lease. "The subsidy is up to 100 percent for
employees working three-fourths time or
more with verified household incomes of
$45.(XK) or less. There is a sliding-scale sub
sidy for employees with household in
comes up to $60,(XX)." Retiree health care
benefits, for those retiring within the next
three years, will remain consistent with the
previous program announced in February
2(X)5.
"We originally asked for this last year,"
Kvitky said. "This is one of the reasons we
went on a one-day strike. We really feel
Stanford ought to pay the cost of health in
surance for families, not just for the work
ers, so this certainly isn't what we pro
posed, but it certainly is a significant step in
that direction."
Other terms in the new agreement in
clude a "commitment by the University to
use progressive discipline where appropri
ate to improve performance deficiencies"
and worker realignments in certain areas
that the SEIU Local 715 covers.This gives
the University the flexibility it says is need
ed to efficiently do its work at manageable
costs.
Overall. Kvikty found the agreement to
be a "fair package," a result of the union
putting up a strong front.
"We felt that, under the circum
stances, which are not just the situation
with benefits and Stanford, but the fact
that across the country these types of
benefits are being cut or lost entirely, we
were able to gain some ground in health
care, although we had to lose a little
bit in retirement," he said. "I think
people recognize that's the trend,
and we put up a good light and were
actually able to make some ground
on benefits, despite a two-tier re
tirement plan."
Along with making improvements
on more minor issues, such as job se
curity. the use of temporary and ex

ternal workers, and representation in
the decision process, according to
Kvitky the union also fought back an
originally 39-page proposal full of
"take-away" â€” cuts and restrictions.
"And after those 39 pages of
take-away, this two-tier retirement
plan is the only one we conceded to
Stanford," he said. "Everything else
was beat back, and we actually
made progress on a lot of other is
sues that are not big-ticket eco
nomic issues."
Both the union and Stanford left
on good terms with the agreement,
having "worked long and hard to

reach an agreement that is a win
win." according to Diane Peck.execu
tive director of 1 luman Resources, in
a press release. The negotiations last
ed over two months this summer, but
as Peck added, "both the union and
the University negotiated with deter
mination and in good faith."
"1 believe the new contract will
help maintain Stanford's position as a
first-rate employer in the Bay Area
while providing a strong framework
for the next three years, building on
the foundation of excellence our staff
continues to provide each and every
day," Peck said.
