# Delicious Deli Dining
## 
### 
JJ&F is well known amongst the Stanford pop
ulation for being the closest grocery store
to campus — useful if your sole mode of
transport involves either two legs are or
wheels. Somewhat less appreciated by the stu
dents is its well-stocked deli, providing an
extensive selection of lunch items.
Sandwiches are my favourite thing about
America (well, along with foot long hot dogs
and Dubya) and JJ&F may well be the best
place in Palo Alto to grab one. Choice is king at
the deli counter, and for a mere $5.50 to $6.50
there's a lot of it available. Sandwich fillings
range from the classics such as eight (that's
right, eight) different kinds of turkey, to some-

what rarer offerings
(at least on the West
Coast) such as Brisket
or Liverwurst. If
you're not in the inood
for meat, check out the
veggie, tuna or
smoked salmon.

Nine options for
bread and about as many for sauces (including
the newly added Ancho Chipotle and Red
Pepper Basil) round out the sandwich selec
tion process, along with, of course, the usual
vegetable choices.
Not in the mood for stuffed bread? Check
out the deli salads. From Greek to Red Potato
and from Poppyseed Coleslaw to Thai Noodle,
you're sure to find something that satisfies.
And if that isn't enough, I'm told the
Rosemary Roast Chicken isn't half bad either.
So, how to finish? Well, for only six bucks
you can get yourself the best sandwich in town
— it's only a short stroll from campus and a
great alternative to those dining hall lunches. ■
