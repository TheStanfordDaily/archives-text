# Traditional Italian Worth the Drive

located on Menlo Park's restaurant
row. Trellis is arguably one of the
J best Italian restaurants in the area.
Elegant without being pretentious,
Trellis provides excellent food at reasonable prices.
It's a great place to go if you want to impress some
one of the opposite sex or if you just want to cele
brate a birthday or another event.
The restaurant is tastefully decorated with neat
ly arranged white cloth tables and muted carpeting.
Hie first room facing El Camino Real has colorful
murals and a ceiling-to-floor mirror that creates a
neat effect on diners. The second dining room is
adorned with plush, spacious booths that make it

perfect for conversation. The crown jewel of the
restaurant is the terrace on the second floor that
seats eighty people, beautifully decorated with
orange trees and furnished with heat lamps.
Venture out to the terrace to enjoy a drink (and the
view) on a cool summer evening.
Start with Trellis's soup of the day or a beet,
orange and endive salad with red onion vinaigrette.
The fried-peppered calamari strings with lemon
aioli were lightly battered and soft.
One of the most popular items is Susan's
Downfall: cheese and herb raviolis in Gorgonzola
toasted almond sauce. We enjoyed the fettuccine
with sauteed prawns, green peas, and diced toma
toes. Other entrees include braised beef with melt
ed leeks and Gorgonzola-potato pure, grilled

chicken breast
with polenta and the Filet Mignon with brandv
green peppercorn sauce.
Trellis boasts one of the best selections of
wines we've seen. Try one of their chardonnays
or their dessert wines (we liked the Thomas
Fogarty). Other suggested desserts include
tiramisu, zabaglione and apple cake with cinna
mon ricotta.
Student groups will appreciate the private ban
quet facilities on the second floor, which was rent
ed for a rehearsal dinner the night we visited last
week. The second floor can seat as many as 100
people and comes equipped with a bar, perfect for
banquets. With food this good, there's no reason
not to bring everyone you know. â–
