# A
						Gold Standard in Chinese
## 
### 
Jing Jing. which appropriately translates into
"gold" from Chinese, has established itself as
just that, the gold standard for Asian cuisine in
Palo Alto. Jing Jing runs the gamut of flavors, from
sweet to sour, but — as we would find out the hard
way — it specializes in spicy.
It's tough to find someone at Stanford that has
yet to experience the wonder that is Jing Jing, but
freshmen should definitely make a pilgrimage as
soon as they're done reading this. The atmosphere
compliments the food quite well. A friendly staff
that was not shy about giving recommendations,

spicy food warnings or just partaking in our witty
banter made our stay quite enjoyable. Jing Jing is a
perfect place to have dinner with friends, bring
family or even a date for an affordable price. For
about $17 you get soothing tea, an appetizer and
any one of their delectable entrees, and (of course)
a nice helping of rice.
Walking into Jing Jing, you can't help but be
taken aback by the beautiful artwork that places
you in the rural province of Hunan China, a region
famous for its spicy dishes. It all started with a Won
Ton soup that hit the spot. From there, we went

right to work. We tried the classics: Kung Pao
Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork. Both were lath
ered in a sauce so good, you could almost drink it
(we tried, but can't recommend it). Then we pro
gressed to the Mongolian beef, so tender, so deli
cious, but oh so spicy. Luckily for us, our waiter had
anticipated this, promptly refilling our water and
bringing us the ultimate anti inflammatory: prawns
in a honey walnut sauce. Yeah, you read right.
If eating past your stomach's limit isn't the mark
of a good restaurant, then we don't know what is.
Towards the end of our meal, we were "painfully
lull, and not stopping."
But hey, if dining in, enjoying conversation and
great food isn't for you, fret not. Jing Jing offers
multiple ways of accessing its cuisine. That's right;
Jing Jing will deliver right to the Stanford campus.
They also do pick-up, and maintain a website with
their menu for those who take hours to decide
what to eat.
And there you have it. For affordable, delicious
Chinese cuisine with a spicy kick, look no further
than Jing Jing Gourmet. ■
