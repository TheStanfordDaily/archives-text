# A 						Taste of Jamaica
## 
### 
Mango Caribbean Cafe is the only place in
downtown Palo Alto where you can order
curried goat. It's also one of the best places
in the area to hang out over truly amazing
food.
The first thing that will catch your attention walk
ing in the door is that the restaurant is extremely
funky: the owners make several trips to Jamaica
every year, and everything —from the art on the
walls to the aprons on the friendly waitresses — adds
to the restaurant's authentic flavor. The most arrest
ing sign of this is the reggae music that plays through
out. It's not your parents' "Don't Worry, Be Happy"
funkv-lite mix: over the course of two hours we heard
a number of obscure but awesome bands hand
picked by the owners, both of whom have lived in
Jamaica and one who is a native.
On top of this extremely inviting everyday atmos
phere. the owners — who took over from old man-

agement last April — arc
carving out a niche for the col
lege student community, with
events like live steel drum reg
gae bands on Saturday nights,
and $2 Red Stripe beers and

Jamaican patties (flaky, spicy, and imported straight
from Kingston) on Thursdays. The lively social
atmosphere of Mango Caribbean is a shot of adrena
line straight to the heart of the Italian-restaurant
and-rug-shop aesthetic of University Avenue, and a
perfect place to relax with friends.

But even if Mango Caribbean had all the social
appeal of a dental hvgienist's office, I'd still be a reg
ular—the food is that good. The Antiqua appetizer
was a vibrant combination of plump barbeque shrimp
in very fresh mango salsa; the complement of diverse
flavors seems to be a theme of the menu. The jerk
chicken drumsticks had a seriously spicy kick, and
were so tender that thev literallv fell off the bone.

As for the entrees, the Soca Special—a mild yel
low currv chicken, also available in wrap form—
absolutely melted in my mouth. It was tender, and the
curry was light and tangv without being overpower
ing. The Little Ochi snapper was also expertly pre
pared. marinated in a sweet tangy pickle sauce that

brought out the freshness of the sauteed vegetables
on the side. Even the broccoli (sauteed in white wine
with a hint of garlic) was so good we wanted seconds.
Other notable dishes on the menu include pumpkin
soup, breaded salmon, and a very colorful tropical
chicken salad.

Make sure to get a beverage, especially if you
order spicy. Mango Caribbean offers a huge array of
fresh tropical smoothies and alcoholic beverages. It
also has a list of unusual wines hand-picked to com
plement Caribbean cuisine, and the staff is glad to
give recommendations. Finally, absolutely do not
miss their Sangria with a tropical twist — it gets its
kick from champagne instead of club soda, making
unusual flavors like mango pop.
Bottom line: this is the perfect place to go with an
intimate group of friends or acquaintances. It is inex
pensive and the food is fresh and high quality. The
music, atmosphere, and fabulous cuisine will definite
ly give vou something to talk about. ■
