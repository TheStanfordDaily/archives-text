Pizza's competition —

Skip's, Dominos, Pizza Mv
Heart but his eyes never reveal any tear, and that may be because he knows
he s already got the competition beat. The Los Altos pizza joint offers 18
difterent pie combinations, but Varsanyi says the Menlo Combo with pepper
oni, salami, Italian sausage and vegetables is the most popular. And for those
that like to mix and match. Applewood has 33 toppings to choose from, from
standard favorites like anchovies and pineapple to the more exotic smoked
salmon and BBQ beef. The prices are right too, with a large one-topping pizza
going ior just $12.75 and steep discounts offered for event catering.
Applewood doesn t just do pizza either, with linguini and fettucini pasta
olterings starting at just $5.75. Still Hungary? You can also try their Langos
(Hungarian garlic bread) or the ever-popular Hungarian goulash.
I here are two other Applewood restaurants, both on El Camino Real in
nearby Menlo Park, but the Los Altos location is the only one that delivers to
Stanford. So, tor a nominal delivery fee. you too can too enjoy an avocado and
prawn pizza while penning your next IHIJM masterpiece. ■
