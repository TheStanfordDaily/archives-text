lamily-owned Cafe Pro Bono is tucked away on
a side street off of California Avenue. When
you walk into the restaurant you are first struck
by the warm colors, soft lighting and attention to decorat
ing details, hut you are soon swept up in host Tony's wel
coming chatter. Most people leaving the restaurant stop to
give him a hug or thank him for a fantastic meal. But
beyond the atmosphere and the attention to service, the
food is fantastic. When you take your first bite you will ask
yourself why you haven't found this place before.
Cafe Pro Bono has a full bar and wine list to comple
ment its meals. The menu also features a large selection of
appetizers and salads, with different specials featured daily.
We ordered the Pro Bono Salad with beets, warm goat
cheese, organic spinach and honey Dijon mustard. The
combination was even better than anticipated and there
was just the right amount of dressing. The menu features
several other salads, a daily soup and appetizer portions of
smoked duck, jumbo prawns or raviolis among others.
For the main course. Cafe Pro Bono features both pas
tas and a variety of meat and seafood options. We tried
the Gnocchi al Pesto with sun dried tomatoes and pine
nuts as well as the Rigatoni with spicy Italian sausage and
mushroom pepper sauce. They were completely different
but both fantastic. Other menu items include the Filet
Mignon with brandy green peppercorn sauce, Roast

Cornish Game Hen with couscous, fresh fennel and cured
olives and Grilled King Salmon with horseradish-herb
crust. We could continue about the other delicious choic
es, but when you sit down you should take some time to
peruse the menu yourself. Tony insists that no dish can be
considered the house special because they are all deli
cious. From what we tasted, we can heartily agree.
The dessert menu was as tempting as the rest of the
restaurant's selections. Cafe Pro Bono offers up a wide
selection of coffees, liquors and desserts including
Tiramisu, Lemon Sorbet and Two Chocolate Mousse with
fresh raspberry sauce. Exquisite.
Cafe Pro Bono may be tucked away, but it's an exciting
discovery. The perfect place for a nice date or dinner out
with visiting parents, you will be glad you ventured away
from University Avenue and tried something new. â–
