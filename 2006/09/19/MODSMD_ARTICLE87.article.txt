— 750 Escondido Road, but it creates a boisterous
atmosphere all its own.

Cardinal athletic jerseys and Pac-10 pennants look down

on the bar while a framed poster of John Belushi in his
now-classic "COLLEGE" t-shirt guards the entryway.

But visitors needn't worry that they'll be turned away

by Bluto's imposing visage — the restaurant is open
to the entire Stanford community.
A jukebox in the corner bumps tunes while the
restaurant's plasma TVs display the day's hot game.
Earlier this year the pub aired every single World
Cup soccer match, even the ones that were on early
in the morning. Even if there's nothing good on TV,
the plasmas rarely sit idle as patrons are encouraged
to bring in their own DVDs.

If you're not interested in zoning out watching the
tube, the 750 boasts one old-school videogame console
(Mrs. Pac-Man, anyone?), a pool table and a patio with

picnic seating. You order at the bar but don't have to wait
around while your food is prepared; The 750 comes

equipped with beepers that flash and vibrate when your food is
ready. They work all around the community center and outside, so

his eclectic, independent pub and grill may be housed in the sterile
Graduate Community Center located at — you guessed it

you can wander off to start a game of pool or even a

quick study session upstairs while your meal is
cooking.

The 750's ambiance is worth describ
ing in more detail, but that would
L~ „l u

he shortchanging the rood. Ihe beery quarter-pound ham
burger patties can be yours for about five dollars and come
with the typical accoutrements. If you're looking for some-

thing a little less ordinary, however, try the Chelsea
Burger with bleu cheese and mushrooms. For the diner
not in the mood for a burger, the 750 offers several
options, the most popular being the Tuscan Chicken
Sandwich.
Lunch is served between 11 in the morning and
2 in the afternoon and offers an abbreviated menu fea
turing The 750's signature Garlic Fries and the afore
mentioned Chicken Sandwich. From five to 10 the full

dinner menu is accessible, and then the lunch favorites
return until the pub closes at 2 A.M. most days (midnight
on Sunday and Monday).

The only dining guide member located on campus hums
with a vibe that shouldn't be missed. With couches, televisions

and wireless access to the Stanford network throughout the build
ing, the restaurant is a great place to hang out. ■
