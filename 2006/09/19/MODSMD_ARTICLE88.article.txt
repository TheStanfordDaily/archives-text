The Thai House, a cozy family-owned and operated
restaurant up El Camino Real in Redwood City,
offers an extensive menu of authentic dishes at
prices that won't break a college student's budget.
Thai restaurants are a dime-a-dozen in the Stanford area,
but the Thai House stands out for its attention to detail. Thai
artwork and statues on wood paneling create an intimate feel,
with hand-woven baskets for steamed rice providing the per
fect finishing touch. The presentation of dishes is similarly
thoughtful, with bell peppers and basil leaves adding needed
color to the eggplant and curry dishes The Daily sampled.
The menu is extensive, sporting nearly 100 choices. The Thai
Iced Tea and Coffee were distinctive, and the tangy peanut
sauce gave the Thai House Salad and Chicken Satay appetizer
a pleasant aftertaste.
The manager was kind enough to provide us tastes of several
entrees. The Panang Curry proved far and away the best of the
night, as the chicken was lean and high-quality and the spiciness
just right. Diners should beware that Pad Thai, while tasty, uses

a slightly sweeter
sauce than most
other Bay Area
Thai restaurants.
Picky eaters
rejoice: diners can
specify the level of
spice and type of
meat (chicken,
beef, prawns or
pork) in each dish.

For vegetarians, the tofu and eggplant are good alternatives.
The original owner founded the restaurant ten years ago,
and returned three months ago after a break to spend time
with her family.
Though it's a bit of trek (perhaps 15 minutes) from campus,
and parking can be an adventure, the Thai House is a great
alternative for students looking to diversify from the Thai
restaurants of downtown Palo Alto — or anyone looking to try
something new. ■
