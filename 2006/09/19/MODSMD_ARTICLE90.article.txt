# Pasta? Yes, Please

### 
Walk past brightly lit "Pasta?" on
University Avenue and at first glance
you'll think you've found an upscale bar.
Contrary to appearances the establish
ment provides not just liquor but also an affirmative answer
to its inquisitive moniker. Whilst manager Franco has big
plans to spruce up the bar area — sofas, chairs and happy
hours should be providing a lounge-feel sometime in
October — for now it's all about the food.
A rich selection of appetizers includes salads and a wide
variety of antipasti. Suggested highlights are the
Mediterranea and Parmigiana salads, along with the
Involtini di Melanzane (stuffed eggplant) and the Carpaccio.
Whilst the former was good, you would need a hefty appetite
to make your way through an entree after beginning with
this heavily sauce-laden dish. The well-constructed
Carpaccio was a much lighter start to the proceedings and
definitely the highlight of my meal.
The centrepiece of the menu is the large selection of
pasta. House specialties include Spaghetti con Polpette with
fresh meatballs. Lasagne al Forno and Ravioli. My dining
partner munched through the Ravioli and pronounced it

suitably al dente
with just the right
balance of sauce,
pasta and ricotta.
For those of you
preferring some
thing meatier.

recommendations include
Polio alia Parmigiana,
Saltimbocca di Maiale and
Scaloppine al Marsale.
Having gorged myself on the
latter (veal with mushrooms
in a Marsala sauce) I can
pronounce it delicious.

Pasta? also serves up a gorgeous selection of dessert dish
es. The Tiramisu (made in store) was one of the best we've
tried — light and fluffy with nary a hint of sogginess.
The varied menu is accompanied by a nightly changing set
of specials and a diverse wine list that should cater to most
tastes. Although early evening diners will find themselves
shoulder-to-shoulder with families (and occasional young
children), the ambiance takes on a bit more of an edge on

weekend nights as the Palo Alto
party crowd ventures out. Things
can get pretty busy later on. so
reservations may be in order if
you plan to eat late.
As well as providing a
lively dinner locale, Pasta? is also

a great place for lunch. Along
with a cut down version of the dinner menu you will also find
an excellent selection of hearty and great-value sandwiches
($7.50 a piece). Pasta? can also provide catering for campus
events, giving you an interesting option for any lunchtime
meetings or evening gatherings that you find yourself orga
nizing.
All in all, for a fun night out or a solid lunch on University
Avenue, Pasta? is definitely worth a look. ■
