Weekdays 11:30-9:30, Weekends 11:30-10

WWalk into Chef Chu's and you are immediately drawn to the
framed photographs that hang near the front desk. The
owner, Lawrence Chu, with Margaret Thatcher. Chu with
Benazir Bhutto. Chu with John F. Kennedy Jr. The list of dig
nitaries and celebrities that have passed through this Peninsula landmark
goes on and on. But the wild success of his namesake hasn't dulled Chu's pas
sion. Chu, 63, is in the restaurant everyday, dreaming up new dishes and shak
ing the hands of his guests —prime minister and ordinary Joe alike.
Once you weave through the crowded front-area (always make a reserva-

tion) and find your seat, the torturous task of choosing your dinner begins. With a menu
packed both with exotic sounding delicacies and traditional Chinese favorites, this can
be a real challenge. We decided on the pot stickers and some BBQ pork buns, and after
just a few bites, our entire party was in agreement that they were the best we had ever
tasted.
Choosing main course proved tough too, but we eventually settled on Grilled Beijing
Beef and Cashew Chicken. The beef, marinated and wok-roasted with Beijing bean
sauce and green onion, was especially delicious. For dessert, the delicious fried banana
and ice cream sundae was an exclamation point on a perfect meal.
In addition to lunch, dinner and brisk take-out business, Chef Chu's can host larger
groups in its private banquet room. It also rents out the entire second floor for parties

with 80 or more people. Still can't
get enough of Chef Chu's award
winning cuisine? The restaurant
runs a cooking class every Tuesday
night from now until Nov. 7, where
you too can learn to whip up
Chinese and Vietnamese dishes
from Chef Chu and other Bay
Area food wizards. Classes are
$40-50 per session and the limited
spots fill up quickly. ■
