HUNTER-GATHERERS IN ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
Imagine living in an environment where water must be obtained from melons, or surviving in minus 40
degree temperatures. Hunter-gatherer groups faced and met such challenges, yet relatively few of us have

Australia, and the North American Arctic provide case studies for comparison with each other, as well as
the archaeological record.
