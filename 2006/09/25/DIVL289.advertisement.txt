The Creative Writing Program offers three poetry workshops in Fall
2006 with Faculty Poets Bruce Snider and Sara Michas-Martin.
English 92: Reading and Writing Poetry (5 units)
MW 3:15-5:05 orTTh 11-12:50
English 192: Intermediate Poetry (5 units)
TTh 1:15-3:05
In a unique workshop setting, students will consider what makes
poetry, as Mitia Loy wrote, "Prose bewitched, a musical score,
hundreds of sounds, words, images, things coming together at the
right moment." By the end of the quarter students leave with a small
body of their own poetry and a growing sense of their voice, interests
and technical strengths.
