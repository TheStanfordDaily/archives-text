## Facebook privacy 
### 
I've never thought of myself as a privacy
conscious person. I use the same password
for my bank as 1 do for my The New York
l imes login, my phone records and my Face
book account. Come to think of it. most of my
close friends and some of my ex-girlfriends
probably know the password too. So 1 was
kind of surprised to find myself clicking
through "privacy options" on Facebook.com
the other day because I've never clicked "pri
vacy options" on any Web site in the past.
In the words of Facebook founder Mark
Zuckerberg, Facebook's goal has been to cre
ate "an environment where people could
share whatever information they wanted, but
also have control over whom they shared that
information with."
In the past. Facebook has thrived precisely
because it created a comfortable space where
users can feel safe sharing their information. If
and when a privacy issue did come up. it was al
ways easy enough to change the setting.
Yet as Facebook's development of new fea
tures has accelerated, the comfort and privacy
that were the bedrock of its success has fallen
by the wayside. When Facebook introduced
the new mini-feed, users suddenly lost control
over both what they were viewing and what
others could read about them — a move
Zuckerberg later described as "a big mistake."
When the new mini-feed privacy features
were introduced, I went through and
unchecked several of the things Facebook of
fered to broadcast about me — the end of a
relationship, disaffiliation from a student
group, removal of stuff from my online pro
file — and then, on second thought,
unchecked all of them. If I want to broadcast
that I've recently added a friend. I'd be per
fectly content writing in my profile "Guess
who I just added as a friend," along with their
name. When I thought about it, I didn't want
any of that stuff automatically broadcast.

What I wanted was the control over my per
sonal presentation that I had before.
But the items I unchecked — all that were
available — were just a subset of the things
that Facebook broadcasts. 1 can uncheck the
"broadcast my breakups" box, but I can't
uncheck the "broadcast my get-togethers."
Facebook only offers the chance to un-check
the things that they think you'd most likely be
upset about.
Down at the bottom of the list, it says
"Have something you'd like to see here?"
Yeah 1 have something I'd like to see here:
everything! Rather than belatedly offering to
stop a few broadcasts, how about giving me
control over which broadcasts I want? I was
frustrated. Now whenever I do certain things,
I have to go back and delete the news story 1
just generated.
It was in that frame of mind that I read a
newspaper story detailing the next step in
Facebook's plan: to let any member of the
public join. Naturally, there are some things
I'm comfortable sharing with college stu
dents that I don't necessarily want to share
with the entire public. As a result. I had to re
consider every piece of information in my
profile.
This was already a far cry from the Face
book of yesteryear. Rather than a comfort
able, safe place where most people were pret
ty much happy with the default privacy set
tings, now information I'd thought I was shar
ing with a small group was going to be shared
much more widely. It was up to me, the user, to
proactively go through and make sure I was
comfortable with everything.
Going through the profile, my photos and my
wall were easy.Those were from back in the day,
before Facebook forgot their privacy values.
Next, I began to go through my postings
on other people's walls. But wait! How do
you find all the walls you've posted on again?

It turns out that, unlike "photos of me" there
isn't a "wall postings by me" section. I
emailed the people in the privacy department
at Facebook, asking them if there was any
way to see all of my wall postings in one place.
They got back to me quickly: "Click on the
Wall-to-Wall button at the bottom of any wall
post and that will show a list of all wall posts
that you and the other user have exchanged."
"Right, but I have a thousand [facebook]
friends." I responded. "Is there any way to
know where all my wall postings are. or do I
have to click Wall-to-Wall with each of them?'
"Unfortunately, the feature you are re
questing is not available," the response con
tinued. "We are always working to improve
Facebook,and we'll be releasing a few surpris
es in the coming weeks."
Somehow I don't think the privacy feature
I had requested is one of the surprises they
have planned for the coming weeks. My ex
girlfriend (the one that knows all my pass
words) just started work yesterday as a cus
tomer service representative at Facebook. He
fore the end of her first day at work, she had
memorized that response.
At least I didn 't hear back,"Thanks for the
great suggestion. We will certainly keep it in
mind as we continue to improve the site."That
would have been frustrating because, as an
other Facebook customer service rep put it.
we usually don't think it is great and won't
keep it in mind."
Hearing that statement, don't you wish
you could take an inventory of everything
you d posted — even in groups you're no
longer a member? Unfortunately, the feature
you are requesting is not available.
What Facebook has lost sight of is the basic
principles that have made its customers com
fortable from the beginning:
•Give each user a complete and ac
cessible picture of everything that
pertains to them on Facebook —
every friend, every photo, every wall
posting, every comment.
•Give users control over what per
tains to them. If you want to take it
down or make it private, you should
be able to with ease.
•Make the default settings corre
spond with what most people want.
We shouldn't always have to be look
ing over our shoulder to feel comfort
able in our own online community.
Facebook used to follow these sim
ple rules, resulting in its growth and
popularity. Now that it no longer con
sistently considers users' privacy when
it introduces a new feature, that trust
has been undermined. I hope Face
book starts to take serious steps to win
back that trust — starting by returning
to the three principles it used to up
hold. It would be a shame to lose what
was once such a comfortable haven
amidst the sprawling,faceless Internet.
