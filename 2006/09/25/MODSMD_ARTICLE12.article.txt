# Letters to the Editor
## Soapy tradition discouraged 
### 
In the "Doing Stanford — all year long.
Traditions" article on Sept. I l ).The Daily lists
"Fountain I lopping" and a "bubble bath" as
traditional April activities. As the manager
for Stanford's Water Conservation Program,
I want to make sure The Daily readers know
that putting soap in the fountains wastes

thousands of gallons of domestic water. This
is not a sustainable activity and The Daily
should not be promoting it.
Stanford University has spent more than
$1.5 million in the past five years on water
conservation. Each year, we spend a great
amount of time reviewing water use and
water waste. Soaping fountains is high on the
list of wasteful practices. Although it may be

entertaining to a few, last year's soapings at
various fountains took staff away from other
maintenance and wasted almost 100,000 gal
lons of potable water! We encourage the
Stanford community to enjoy Stanford s
fountains but PLEASE NO SOAPING!
