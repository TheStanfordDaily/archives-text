## COUGARS ROAR TO BIG WIN Cardinal blown out at new Stanford Stadium for second consecutive weekend 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
In the first game of the season with the stu
dent body on campus and in attendance,
Washington State "manhandled" the Cardinal
on both sides of the ball to win easily. 36-10.
Washington State 36
The Cougars played an ugly game on Sat
urday. Washington State coughed up three
fumbles — two deep in Stanford territory —
kicker Loren Langley pulled an extra point
wide right and quarterback Alex Brink over
threw several deep balls to open receivers.
But Stanford played worse. The Cardinal
got blown out on its home field by a team that
lost seven straight Pac-10 games last season,
and beat national laughingstock Baylor by
just two points last week.
The Cougars physically dominated Stan
ford on both offense and defense. The Cardi
nal showed little improvement since last
week's equally embarrassing blowout loss to
Navy.
Offensively. Stanford's offensive line al
lowed eight sacks on the day, five of those by
defensive end Mkristo Bruce.
"He manhandled those guys; he's just very
tenacious." said Washington State Coach Bill
Doba of Bruce.
The Cougars held the ball for 13:21 of 15
first-quarter minutes. In that quarter alone,
Washington State gained 180 yards compared
to Stanford's two.
"We dug ourselves and the defense a hole
by putting Washington State on the field for
basically 15 minutes of the first quarter," said
senior quarterback Trent Edwards (15-of-25
for 167 yards, one touchdown and one inter
ception). "You can't win football games that
way, and a lot of that starts with the offense."
On the day, Washington State gained 240
rushing yards on nearly five yards per carry.
Stanford managed just 28. less than a yard per
touch.
"Once you control the front, then you've
got a chance," Doba said. "And they've got
some young kids up front on their defense, so
we were able to run the ball."
Coach Walt Harris expressed a painful
awareness of his team's struggles on the line.
His squad ranks dead-last of the 1 l l > Division
I-A football programs in stopping the run —
by over 50 yards per game.
"Ihe rush defense — I'm not pleased with
that.but I'm not pleased with the rush offense
either," Harris said. "But to say that I've got

answers. I'm like everyone else.
"Until we can match up physically, we will
continue to make it hard on ourselves to have
a chance to compete."
Washington State blew the game open
with three second-quarter touchdowns. Five
minutes into the period. Cougar defensive
end Mike Graise drove his blocker five yards
into the backfield. enabling him to snag Ed
wards' screen for freshman tailback Toby
Gerhart and rumble 33 yards for the score.
On the next drive. Stanford then failed to
pick up a first down, and star Cougar wideout
Jason Hill blocked senior Jay Ottevegio's

punt at the Cardinal 13. An eight-yard Brink
scramble on third and seven set up a two-yard
play-action pass to tight end Jed Collins,
pulling the Cougars ahead 15-0.
After another Stanford three-and-out,
Washington State turned to the ground, run
ning six times for 43 yards on their next drive.
Brink capped the march with a one-yard sneak
to give the Cougars a 22-0 halftime lead.
Despite hemorrhaging yardage and pos
session time in the first quarter, Stanford's de
fense managed to keep Washington State off
the board early. The Cougars fumbled twice
inside the Stanford five to kill promising

drives. The only points Washington State
scored in the first period came when Edwards
slipped in the end zone for a safety.
"Defensively, we played a great first quar
ter; we held them to [two] yards," Doba said.
"Offensively, with two fumbles, we kept try
ing to keep them in the game."
With Stanford's top-three receivers in
jured, junior walk-on Kelton Lynn caught the
Cardinal's only touchdown of the day. a 25-
yard strike in the early fourth. Lynn led Stan
ford with 65 receiving yards, while junior tail
back Anthony Kimble paced the ground
game with 41 vards on 11 carries.
