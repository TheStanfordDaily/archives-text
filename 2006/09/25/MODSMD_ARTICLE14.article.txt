# Polo upset by Pacific
## 
### BY ANDREW SHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 5 Cardinal drop third
game in a row, lose to No. 7
Tigers for the first time in
six seasons

A goal by Pacific senior Matt Mitchell
with 17 seconds left in the second over
time gave No. 7 Pacific their first win over
the No. 5 Stanford men's water polo team
in six years. Saturday's 11-10 loss was the
Cardinal's third consecutive defeat after
starting the season 5-0.
Stanford started the game on the right
foot, building a 3-0 lead on the strength of
two goals by sophomore utility Will Hin
dle-Katel. Pacific answered, though, with
its first goal by junior driver Duje Kaur
loto. The Tigers again responded after a
goal by junior Michael Bury, trimming
their deficit back to two.
Bury opened the second quarter with
his second goal, but Pacific closed out the
half with two of its own. slowly creeping
closer to the Cardinal at a 4-5 deficit.
Stanford hoped to open it up again in
the third quarter, controlling play and
notching goals from senior captain J.J.
Garton and sophomore Andrew Drake.
But the Tigers then launched a 3-1 rally,
with freshman Drac Wigo scoring the only

Cardinal goal, to end the quarter down
only 7-8.
The fourth quarter didn't open any
more promisingly for the Cardinal with
Pacific's Dragan Bakic completing a hat
trick, and tying the match for the first time.
Drac's brother, freshman utility Janson
Wigo, scored to regain the lead for Stan
ford, but Bakic once again carried Pacific
with a game-tying fourth goal. Janson
Wigo stepped up at crunch time, giving
Stanford a one-goal lead with 1:32 left in
the game.

Unfortunately, the Cardinal couldn't
hang on. They gave up a penalty to the
Tigers, who took advantage of the 6-5
man-up situation, forcing overtime with a
goal in the last nine seconds.
Neither team scored in the first extra
three-minute session, and during the sec
ond, another penalty was called on the
Cardinal. The Tigers then set up Mitchell
for his only goal of the game, to put Pacif
ic in the lead with less than 17 seconds re
maining. Stanford's last-gasp attempt was
blocked by Pacific goalie Brian Domecus.

As when it lost to top-ranked Cal in last
week's NorCal Tournament, holding the
lead proved difficult for the Cardinal on
Saturday. Junior goalie Sandy Hohener
notched 10 saves, but Stanford's overall
defense wasn't effective enough to hold
onto the win.
The Cardinal have a chance this week
to redeem a recent loss, and end their los
ing streak, when they travel to Pasadena.
Calif, for a match against UCLA. Sept. 30.
