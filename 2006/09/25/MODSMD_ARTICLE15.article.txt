## Tough football questions answered 
### 
Throughout the season, I'll be using
this column to offer commentary, analy

traditional football coverage. This

students have asked me after watching
their team suffer to an 0-4 start.
"Will the football team win a game?"
Maybe, but maybe not is becoming

Notre Dame in the next two weeks.The

Of the approximately 2,000 recruits
who sign to play Division I-A football
each year, those in the know tell me
that only 40 are academically admissi
