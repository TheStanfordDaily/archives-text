## Tough football questions answered 
### 
Throughout the season, I'll be using
this column to offer commentary, analy
sis and perspective that goes beyond our
traditional football coverage. This
week, let's tackle a few actual questions
students have asked me after watching
their team suffer to an 0-4 start.
"Will the football team win a game?"
Maybe, but maybe not is becoming
an increasingly real possibility.
It'd be quite a feat to pull off 0-12.1
can't even find the last time a Pac-1()
team went winless, and I've checked
each of the past 10 seasons, so thanks to
any reader who has that information.
But after blowing a 20-point lead to
San Jose State, and getting demolished
at home by Navy and Washington
State, Stanford has lost three of the
most winnable games on its schedule.
What remains? The Cardinal should
be crushed at UCLA and, especially, at
Notre Dame in the next two weeks.The
same holds true with at Arizona State,
versus IJSC and at Cal later in the sea
son. That leaves Homecoming versus
Arizona on Oct. 14, at Washington Nov.
11 and the home-finale versus Oregon
State on Nov. 18 as the best shots. Of
course. 1 thought we'd win four or five
games heading into this season, so pro
jections can change in a heartbeat.
"Why is the team so had?"
In a broader, "Why did we last have
a winning season in 2001?" sense, I'd
start with the fact that Stanford foot
ball has admissions standards unlike
any Division I-A school in the nation.
Of the approximately 2,000 recruits
who sign to play Division I-A football
each year, those in the know tell me
that only 40 are academically admissi
hie to Stanford, and of those 40,
we'll sign ahout 20. That's not much
of a margin for error if five of those
recruits don't pan out.
In contrast, great academic insti
tutions with great football programs
like Berkeley, UCLA or Michigan
have achieved their success by virtu
ally eliminating their athletics admis
sions standards. They'll recruit the
vast majority of those 2,000 who
have test scores, grade points aver
ages or backgrounds that eliminate
them from Stanford's recruiting
pool. Notably, Cal fueled their five
year turnaround from laughingstock
to title contender with loads of trans
fers from junior colleges, 99 percent
of who would be inadmissible to
Stanford.
All told, it's a lot easier for any
other school to have both better
players and more of them, and we're
certainly seeing the results of that
on the field. Hie fact that Stanford
football has stunk and that admis
sion to Stanford has grown tougher

for athletes and non-athletes alike
in recent years exacerbates the
problem of attracting talent.
The scourge of former coach
Buddy Teevens (now struggling at
lowly Dartmouth) and poor recruit
ing evaluations and talent develop
ment have not helped matters any
either.
In an immediate,"Why are we 0-
4 and getting embarrassed each Sat
urday?" sense, look no further than
the most basic task in football: run
ning the ball and stopping the run.
An incredible run of injuries has
also made Stanford one of the
youngest, most inexperienced teams
in the country.
"Okay, so how bad is the rushing
game?"
The rush offense is among the
worst in the conference, but it's de
cent enough that it won't single
handedly lose games,especially with
freshman Toby Gerhart at tailback.
The same cannot be said for the
rush defense. Maybe I'll jinx us into

a tackle, but right now this is the
worst rush defense I've seen in
watching ten years of college foot
ball. And with UCLA, Notre Dame,
Arizona State, USC and Cal loom
ing on the horizon, the worst is yet to
come.
Currently, Stanford is allowing
312 rush yards per game, 52 more
than anyone else in the country. Part
of it is a talent discrepancy, but most
of it seems to be sloppy execution —
poor tackling, and players simply
being in the wrong place at the wrong
time.
"Are there any glimmers of hope?"
How about this: 'Ihere's no way
the team is as devoid of talent as you
would think from watching it right
now, so the on-field product will im
prove with time. (Especially with
Walt Harris and Bob Bowlsby, two
proven winners, as coach and athlet
ic director, respectively.) The ques
tion remains, however, whether that
improvement will come this season
or the next.
