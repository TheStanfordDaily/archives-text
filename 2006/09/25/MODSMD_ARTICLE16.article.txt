# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Champs too much for Card to handle Volleyball earns split on Washington road trip, but is swept by Huskies 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
SEATTLE â€” A career performance by sophomore
Cynthia Barboza nearly carried Stanford women's
volleyball to victory this weekend, but the offensive
juggernaut of No. 4 Washington proved too much for
the No. 6 Cardinal.
Splitting its opening weekend of conference play
in Washington, Stanford (10-2.1-1 Pac-10) swept past
unranked Washington State (12-4.0-2), 30-17,30-16,
30-23, in the Pac-10 opener Thursday, but lost a tight
three-game match, 30-21,30-28,30-25, to the defend
ing national champion Huskies. Sophomore outside
hitter Barboza's 25 kills and two aces were match
highs, but a smothering block and flawless hitting by
two Huskies gave Washington (12-1.2-0) the boost it
needed.
"As a team, they played very well, executed well,"
Cardinal head coach John Dunning said of the
Huskies. "They taxed us and they showed us that,
while I wouldn't call them weaknesses, we definitely
have some things that we need to keep working on."
The Cardinal got the weekend off to a good start
with a sweep of Washington State. The Cougars were
no match for Stanford who took the first game 30-17.
Though the teams were neck-and-neck early, with the
score tied at 10, Stanford finally broke away with a 14-
2 run.The Cardinal's sixth block of the game, a double
by Barboza and sophomore middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo, ended the frame with a bang.
Stanford hit .375 as a team and held the Cougars to
a negative percentage in the first game. Senior outside
hitter Kristin Richards hit five-for-seven in the game
and Akinradewo blocked five balls, including two
solo.
I'he Cardinal started more quickly in the second
game,going up 4-1 and never looking
back. Senior middle blocker
Michelle Mellard served five straight
points, including a pair of aces to
stretch the lead to 15 at 27-12. Junior
setter Bryn Kehoe's fourth kill of the
night ended the game 30-17.
Richards notched five more kills
in the second, and the Cardinal
recorded 18 kills with only two er
rors. hitting a spectacular .615.
After taking the 20-11 lead in the
third game, Stanford gave up five
points to the Cougars before rallying
for the 30-23 victory. Richards closed
out the night with two kills, finishing
with a match-high 13 on .348 hitting.
Barboza had 12 kills, while Akin
radewo had seven to go along with
seven blocks.
"Bryn set lots of good balls on
Thursday." Dunning said. "Her con
nection to the middles was great. It
was key to control the ball and get it
to the middle and Foluke and [junior

middle blocker] Franci [Girard] were
unstoppable."
The next night, however, the Car
dinal found themselves on the other
side of a sweep, falling in three to the
defending NCAA champs. Washing
ton jumped out to an early lead and
powered past Stanford for the 30-21
win in the first game behind the .833
hitting of Alesha Deesing (5-for-6).
The second game was even
throughout, with neither team ever
leading by more than three.The score
was tied at 28-28, but the Huskies
scored the two points they needed
for the win.
As in the second game, the Cardi
nal kept pace with the Huskies for
most of the game before falling back
late. After the lead went back and
forth. Washington claimed the win,
30-25, on a missed attack by Stan
ford.
"We came very close in that sec
ond game," Dunning said. "If one
play goes one way or the other, it can
change the course of the game. But
when they pulled away a bit in the
third, it was hard for us to fight back."
Barboza finished the match with
25 kills in the three games, one short

of her career high. Sophomore libero
Jessica Fishburn recorded a career
high 25 digs, with 10 coming in the
third game alone.
"For Jess to have 25 digs in just
three games, that was definitely the
best defensive performance she has
had," Dunning said. "And Cynthia
was hitting great and playing really
well all around."
Richards struggled with the Wash
ington block, but nonetheless fin
ished with 15 kills, putting her one
ahead of Olympic gold-medalist
kerri Walsh on the career kills list
with the seventh-highest total in
school history.
After the disappointing result, the
Cardinal are looking ahead to the
rest of the season and their second
shot at the Huskies, at Maples in late
November.
"We have had some team conver
sations and talked to some individu
als about things to work on," Dun
ning said. "The team understands
that the most important thing is to
stay healthy and keep improving
And that has been our trademark in
the past, to keep improving right up
to the end."
