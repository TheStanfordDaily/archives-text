# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Champs too much for Card to handle Volleyball earns split on Washington road trip, but is swept by Huskies 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
SEATTLE â€” A career performance by sophomore
Cynthia Barboza nearly carried Stanford women's
volleyball to victory this weekend, but the offensive
juggernaut of No. 4 Washington proved too much for
the No. 6 Cardinal.
Splitting its opening weekend of conference play
in Washington, Stanford (10-2.1-1 Pac-10) swept past
unranked Washington State (12-4.0-2), 30-17,30-16,
30-23, in the Pac-10 opener Thursday, but lost a tight
three-game match, 30-21,30-28,30-25, to the defend
ing national champion Huskies. Sophomore outside
hitter Barboza's 25 kills and two aces were match
highs, but a smothering block and flawless hitting by
two Huskies gave Washington (12-1.2-0) the boost it
needed.
"As a team, they played very well, executed well,"
Cardinal head coach John Dunning said of the
Huskies. "They taxed us and they showed us that,
while I wouldn't call them weaknesses, we definitely
have some things that we need to keep working on."
The Cardinal got the weekend off to a good start
with a sweep of Washington State. The Cougars were
no match for Stanford who took the first game 30-17.
Though the teams were neck-and-neck early, with the
score tied at 10, Stanford finally broke away with a 14-
2 run.The Cardinal's sixth block of the game, a double
by Barboza and sophomore middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo, ended the frame with a bang.
Stanford hit .375 as a team and held the Cougars to
a negative percentage in the first game. Senior outside
hitter Kristin Richards hit five-for-seven in the game
and Akinradewo blocked five balls, including two
solo.
