# Attacking the Zone Defense

### Chrisopher Anderson 
Washington State prodded the middle of the Stanford pass defense all afternoon, buoyed by a
successful play on their second drive of the game.
The Cougars spread out with four receivers on 4th and 5 at the Cardinal 21-yard line. In the slot
was six-foot-eight-inch tight end Cody Boyd (80). Alex Brink (10) fired to Boyd on a seam route be
hind linebacker Michael Okwo (55). The senior rumbled to the one-yard line before being tackled
by senior defensive back Brandon Harrison and senior free safety Trevor Hooper. Harrison was in
jured on the 20-yard gain and did not return. Washington State fumbled the ball away on the next
play, but senior quarterback Trent Edwards subsequently fell down in the end zone for a safety, giv
ing the Cougars a lead they never relinquished.
