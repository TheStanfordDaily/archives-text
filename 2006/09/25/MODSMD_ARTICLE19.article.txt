The Daily reported the
University's decision to
place the Band on "indefi

temporarily banning the
group from all athletic ac
tivities including the
opening of the Stadium
on Sept 16 ("Band Falls

of this decision:

It's unfortunate that student
spirit suffered due to lack of band
and/or poor football. Although I
can see that the crazy band adds ex
citement to the games. I still think it
is important that the provisional
status be maintained because the
fact is that their (or some of their
members') behavior was unaccept
able. It is the members' fault that
they were banned, and their pun
ishment should not be revoked for
the sake of upping spirit at a game.

And why should the entire
marching band be suspended for
the actions of just a few of its mem
bers? Hie people who did the van
dalism thought that the Shak was
about to be demolished the next

week. They didn't see their actions
as any different from when the stu
dents tore down the stadium after
the Notre Dame game. They were
wrong and they understand that
now, but why should the entire
Band, the Tree and the Dollies be
punished for the actions ot a few?

"The Band Run is a tradition..."
Someone seems to have forgotten
that bands are also part of the col
lege football tradition, and that it is
traditional to play "All Right Now'
when the team enters the field. The
behavioral problems with the Band
could have been solved long ago if
the specific members involved in
these incidents were held to the
Fundamental Standard by the Uni
versity, and kicked out of the or
ganization or otherwise relieved of
their responsibilities. Instead, the
salutary neglect ends and we have
King George clamping down on
the Colonies after the Boston Tea
Party. Way to go.

"Indefinite provisional status"
is a joke. People deserve to know
exactly what their punishment is,
have that punishment carried out,
and move on. Every good justice
system has a definite sentence. The
administration seems to treat stu
dent groups as a liability rather
than the soul of Stanford student
life. The office of student activities
is becoming largely irrelevant as
students can now more easily or
ganize groups independently
rather than dealing with the office

bureaucracy.The Band is by far, the
largest and most active student or
ganization at Stanford. The admin
istration is killing what makes
Stanford great by silencing the
band. What do we want Stanford to
be? A fun place where students are
free to express themselves, or a
stuffy boring university that is like
every other place?

It's called collective responsibil
ity. Go ask any student group
(greek house, athletic team, cultur
al group, etc.). The entire body of
the group is held accountable for
the actions of all of its members.
The University has and will base
the actions of individuals as actions
of the group.

Stanford's band really epito
mizes our laid-back and fun spirit. I
don't think most students realize
how hard the Band members work
to support us. Most of the band
members 1 know are hard-working
and intelligent students. And the
ones who vandalized their shak
thought that the building was to be
demolished the next week. This
doesn't seem fair to me. The uni
versity should encourage creativi
ty. instead of stilling it.
