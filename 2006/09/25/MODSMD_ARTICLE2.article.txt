## Frosh find holes in dry week policy Despite AlcoholEDU, some staff say frosh not booze-savvy 
### BY AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
Dorm staff and University officials last week
praised AlcoholEDU, a new mandatory online al
cohol education program this year for freshmen.
Despite the program and the University's dry pol
icy during New Student Orientation (NSO), infor
mal drinking parties have abounded at all-frosh
dorms for the last week and police and staff have
reported cases of excessive drinking.
"It seems like freshmen from all over campus
come to Branner." said freshman Conal Sathi.
"There has been a party every night here since
Thursday."
Junior Alex Mallory, a Resident Assistant in
Branner. agreed that drinking was prevalent in her
dorm.
"It doesn't seem like they're having a hard time
accessing the alcohol." she said. "Even if one per
son is bringing the beer, it seems that twenty peo
ple are drinking."
Drinking among freshmen has not been limited
to one dorm, however. Larkin freshman Pablo
Jablonski said that alcohol was plentiful in his
house, but added that he was not worried about the
safety of his peers.
"People are usually drinking in their rooms
with the door open." he said. "If you knock on the
few doors that are closed, people will open imme-

diately. I don't believe
that people are
being secretive
about drinking

The openness
surrounding
drinking has 1
considerably
compromised the
position of residen
tial staff. While RAs
and Resident Deans
are required to

uphold University alcohol rules,
many strongly support the open
door policy With the high incidence
of alcohol consumption during
NSO. residential stalls across cam
pus have encouraged their residents
not to hide their drinking.
Mallory said it is a challenge to
maintain the University's policy
while ensuring the health and safety
of her residents.
"NSO is really, really hard." she
said. "We [tell] the residents that
we're not going to police you but
that you can't drink during this
week. Its illegal for you to drink, hut
we're not going to call the cops. NSO
creates a real problem with estab
lishing credibility."
One alcohol-related issue was re
ported to police, according to Stan
ford Police Lieutenant Larry
St.Denis, though he declined to
elaborate on it. Dorm staffs are also
reticent to detail alcohol abuse by
their freshmen to maintain confi
dentiality and their residents' trust
RAs have also suggested a po
tential lack of substance education
may be partly to blame.even though
the class of 2010 was the first to be
required to complete the three-hour
AlcoholHDU program. An email to
the Substance Abuse Prevention
Program at Vaden Health Center re
garding the program was not re
turned before deadline.
Mallory said that the fact that the
popular Orientation week play.
"The Real World: Stanford." was de
layed until Sept. 28 because of reli
gious conflicts did not help matters.
"The information in "The Real
World' is really important to get
across immediately." she said of the
play, which satirizes dorm life and
offers health-based suggestions. "I
think it was a serious mistake not to
schedule 'The Real World' during
NSO week this year."
Some still think the current poli
cy is effective.
"No matter what they do, there
will always be drinking." Jablonski
said. "With the current policy, peo
ple drink in moderation. Maybe if
they say it's okay to drink, people
will drink more excessively. In either
case, you really can't prevent it."
