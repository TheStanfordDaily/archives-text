Fight Reported Outside of BROC Party
Police confirmed that they received a report of
a fight outside of the Black Recruitment and Ori
entation Committee (BROC) party at Tresidder
Saturday night.
Lieutenant Larry St. Denis of the Stanford Po
lice said that police inside the party, supervising for
security purposes, received the report between
12:30 and 12:45 and arrived at the scene of the al
leged fight outside of the student union "about a
minute later."
Upon arrival, officers saw that the participants
had disappeared, leaving "three or four" witnesses
behind.
"How much of a fight there was 1 really don't
know," St. Denis said, adding that University police
are unlikely to take further action since witnesses
were unable to identify participants and police
have not heard of anyone checking into the hospi
tal with fight-related injuries.
Witnesses could not be reached for comment.

Neglected (ioafs Found on University Property
Two bikers found 50 emaciated goats on Aug. 31
on University-owned land in Portola Valley. The
property of Sustainable Solutions Land Manage
ment and Ecological Services, the goats were dis
covered fenced inside two small pens, without
water and grain. A dead goat was also discovered in
a nearby horse trailer.
Angered at the treatment of the goats, which
Sustainable Solutions used to limit the local weed
population. Peninsula Humane Society investiga
tor Debi DeNardi is seeking charges against the
company's owners. DeNardi has claimed that some
of the goats suffer from coughing, nasal discharges,
and diarrhea.
While most of the goats are still being treated
for their symptoms, five have been deemed healthy
enough for adoption and new owners are currently
being sought for the animals. It is still unclear
whether criminal charges will be brought against
the goats' original owners.
