# BEYOND THE FARM
## Rumors swirl around In-N-Out 
### DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT MANAGING EDITOR 
In-N-Out Burger prides itself on its 19505-style
decor, unchanging, minimalist menu and mouth-water
ing burgers that consistently draw Stanford students to
its two Mountain View locations. But beneath the shiny
veneer of its Formica countertops there has been a flur
ry of activity in recent months - the death of the chain's
co-founder, an internal legal battle, and multiple offers
to buy the company - and left some industry observers
wondering what the future holds for the burger giant.
Speculation about the company's future ramped up
after the Aug. 4 death Esther Snyder. Bft, who co-found
ed In-N-Out Burger with her husband in IIM<S.l l M<S. Both of
Snyder's sons are dead, and so ownership of the compa
ny passed to her 24-year-old granddaughter. Lynsi Mar
tinez.
But the trouble brewing at the fast food chain first
began late last year with a flurry of internal lawsuits,
when Richard Boyd, the company's vice president for
real estate and development and a member of the
board, sued In-N-Out after he was fired, alleging that
the company had let him go because he opposed rapid
expansion plans that might destroy the chain's hallmark
burger quality.
In the suit. Boyd claimed that Martinez was conspir
ing with her brother-in-law Mark Taylor, who was then
an executive and was named company president after
Snyder's death, to speed up her takeover of the compa
ny (under the guidelines of Martinez's trust, she will
gain control over the chain in incremental stages over
the next decade). The company countersued Boyd,
charging him with embezzlement and fraud.
Hie suit was settled out of court in May, and both
sides agreed to confidentiality clauses, leaving the terms
and the truth a mystery. But that hasn't stopped specu
lation that there may be changes ahead at In-N-Out.
A source close to the situation, who requested
anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement, told
The Daily that the burger chain is besieged daily by in
vestors interested in buying the privately-held compa
ny. But a sale, the source said, is unlikely to happen any
time soon.
"The company says time and again that they have no
interest in selling and that the family looks forward to
owning it for many generations." the source said.
In-N-Out Burger did not respond t< > e-mail and tele
phone inquiries.
But even if In-N-Out remains in the family, the com
pany could decide to move beyond California, Nevada
and Arizona, where its 202 restaurants are now concen
trated. The chain could also opt to expand faster, as
Boyd's lawsuit alleges Taylor and Martinez secretly
plan. In an effort to head off these grumblings, the com
pany released a statement after Snyder's death pledg
ing to continue to grow at "a moderate and deliberate
pace." The company currently opens 10 to 12 new
restaurants every year. But the company, known for its
secrecy, has said little else, inevitably leading to specula
tion from industry observers.
Ron Paul, president of Technomic. a Chicago-based
restaurant-consulting firm, said growing too quickly is
notoriously risky territory.
"The danger is demonstrated by firms like Krispy

Kreme, which has basically imploded, and Boston Mar
ket," Paul said. "You tend to make real estate mistakes
because you are so anxious to grow that you make bad
decisions."
But, Paul added, in-N-()ut*s business model is so
simple and its menu so basic, even rapid expansion
probably would not threaten burger quality, and that
the chain's fans need not worry.
"I haven't changed my In-N-Out habits when I'm on
the West Coast," he said.
In-N-Out is a traditional staple of a Stanford under
graduate diet, so much so that a group of seniors creat
ed a delivery company, Chompz, last winter to shuttle
burgers from Mountain View to students' doors for a
small fee. Co-founder Sam Yam, a co-terminal student,
said that he has not heard of the turbulence at In-N-
Out. but it seems to be business as usual at the chain his
company frequents.
"Going to In-N-Out every single day, the quality
seems first and
foremost in people's heads." he said. "The employees
seem pretty happy and excited every time I walk in and
order 30 burgers."
If In-N-Out executives needed more testimonials
that confidence in their food quality is at an all-time
high, they could point to Paris Hilton. The 25-year-old
socialite, who has appeared in television commercials
for fast food chain Carl's Jr., was arrested for drunk
driving Sept. 7 and went on the radio the next morning
to explain herself.
"I was just really hungry." she said."And I wanted to
have an In-N-Out burner."
