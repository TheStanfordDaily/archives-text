# The 						Band Run that wasn't
## Mixed tractions to last-minute amalgam of Univ-designed rally and traditional Run 
### BRENDAN SELBY 
To most incoming freshmen, last Tuesday's Band Run seemed to
gooff without a hitch. For Ban Run veterans, the main difference
with previous years was an ending point at Stanford Stadium in
stead of the Main Quad.
What they didn't know was that administrators and New Stu
dent Orientation (NSO) organizers had originally planned to go
forward with an alternative, unpublicized event - referred to infor
mally by NSO volunteers as the "Stampede" - that would not have
included the Band, which is on indefinite provisional status follow
ing vandalism at the Band Shak this summer. ITiis plan was
scrapped only days beforehand, when the administration decided
to allow the Band to participate after all, forcing NSO into a last
minute scramble to put together Band Run.
"It was pretty frantic as far as I can tell." said 1 lead ()rientation
Volunteer Hlise Menke. a senior, of the final days before the Run.
"The actual execution of the program went well.but there was some
frustration in not knowing whether the Band would be involved."
Some upperclassmen who attended did not like the changes,
particularly the ending, which featured traditional voice of NSO,
Dean of Freshman and Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims as
master of ceremonies.
"It was really fun except the ending at the stadium sucked,"
said senior katherine Schlosser. who was on campus for Hon
ors College. "They turned on the lights and then Dean Julie
took the mike and introduced a bunch of people. It seemed too
formal."

It was pretty
frantic as far as
I can tell.

The changes to the end
ing were all holdovers
from the plan for an alter
native event. Menke said.
Without the Band,she said
NSC) staff and dorm Resi
dent Assistants would
have led freshmen out of
their residences to run to
ward White Plaza, where
students from east and
west campuses would con
verge. Then, the entire
group would run, or "stam
pede," down to the stadi
um where they would he
met with food,members of

the Axe Committee, Yell Leaders and freshman football players.
"Band Run is so popular, so they were trying to create the clos
est thing to it if we were not allowed to do it ourselves." said senior
Adam Cohen, the Band's assistant manager.
Nonetheless, he said the Band has been in frequent communica
tion with Lythcott-11 aims since its suspension began, and Cohen be
lieved she had fought for the Band's participation because "she
knows that freshmen really like it.'
Lythcott-1 iaims could not be reached for comment before dead
line.
By the time the Band received permission to host the Run,
which was less than a week before orientation began, Cohen said.it
was too late to organize a separate event because of the amount of
logistics involved, particularly the number of security personnel
needed.
With few options available, the Band co-opted the logistics al
ready in place for the Stampede, and Cohen noted that the Band
had nothing to do with the program inside the stadium.
"We didn't really have a choice in the matter," Cohen said. "Not
that we would have fought it anyway because Band Run was pret
ty fun this year anyway."
"The show that was presented after Band Run was the same that
was planned
for the Stampede." Menke said.
The ending of the show resembled another Orientation
event that the Athletic Department had put on in years past.
Cardinal 101, where students meet the freshman players on
the football field and learn the cheers used by Stanford sports
fans at games.
Although some students said they felt Band Run was over-or
chestrated, criticism of the ending was far from universal.
"The ending was cute: I think that was my favorite part actually,"
said Katy Brewster, a freshman living in Twain. "Lveryone is very
rah-rah here, very into their dorm cheers. It made a lot of people
want to join the Band."
Senior Chris Williams,an Adelfa RA. agreed,and credited Lyth
cott-Haims and Dean of Students Cireti Boardnian for letting the
show go on..
"It was actually the best band run I've been on." he said, adding
that he thought this year's Run was better scheduled and "more of
ficial."
Strong attendance by upperclassmen at the Run seemed to sug
gest that the Band's suspension and absence from the Sept. Ifihome
football game against Navy had not dampened campus enthusiasm
for the group. Cohen argued that the publicity that the Band has at
tracted in recent weeks might have added to the fervor of the "mobs
of people" who turned out.
