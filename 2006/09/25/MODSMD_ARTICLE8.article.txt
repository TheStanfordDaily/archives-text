## Editor's Welcome 
### 
The late, great John Fitzgerald
Kennedy— with whom I can claim no
relation — had it wrong.
We've all heard the famous line: "Ask not
what your country can do for you. Ask what
you can do for your country."
I lere at The Stanford Daily, we see things
differently. Go ahead; ask what The Daily can
do for you. You may be surprised by the reply.
During my years and countless meals of
pizza, Chinese food and Treehouse at The
Daily, I've witnessed this newspaper at its
best, as well as at its not-so-best. We've mis
quoted people, misinterpreted the facts and
may have been too liberal in our use of
anonymous sources. But we've also provided
extensive election coverage, offered in
depth sports analysis, reported on campus
labor issues and even broke the news that
President Bush would be visiting campus.
Sure, the president did end up moving his
visit from I ioover Tower. But would the
protests which prompted the relocation — a
welcome show of grassroots spirit and cam
pus activism that many had previously not
associated with the Stanford community —
have happened without Hie Daily?
Maybe. Maybe not.
As a student newspaper. Ilie Daily is stuck
in some form of identity crisis inherent in its
dual nature. On one hand you have The Daily
as a student group, where Stanford students in
their early 2()s congregate amidst a sea of
take-out boxes and Pepsi cans to talk about
the day's news. But 011 the other hand. The
Daily is also a professional newspaper — a
source of news, information and entertain
ment to the thousands of students, faculty,
staff and community members who pick it up.
It is this second role that I would like to
improve during my tenure as Editor-in-
Chief. We will work tirelessly, as we have 111
volumes past, to get the story straight. We
w ill continue to scour the campus for news to
break. But we can always do better.
That's where, you, the readers, come in.
Ask what The Daily can do for you. Think
last week's story on Band Run could have
been a little too biased? Let us know. Wish
there was more coverage of whether profes

sors prefer boxers or briefs? Suggestions are
always welcome.Think that kooky columnist
from The Band has finally gone off his rock
er? Send him — or me — an e-mail.
I've been blown away by the number of
readers who have taken advantage of the
new comment feature on our Web site. Near
ly every story has generated a comment or
two; some have even spawned entire digital
conversations. Selected Web comments will
now appear in the Opinions section of the
print Daily, as part of our effort to bridge the
gap between online and print journalism.
That's not to say Kennedy was all wrong.
For those of you out there who want to try
your hand at journalism, or see something in
Ilie Daily and think you can do it better,give
it a shot.
What can you do for Ilie Daily? Well,
there's plenty. We can always use more writ
ers. copy editors, photographers, graphic
artists and layout designers. Are you a fresh
man arriving on Ilie Farm with years of high
school newspaper experience? We have plen
ty of opportunities for you. A senior interest
ed in photography but never got around to
joining? Our doors are still open (even if the
office, in the Storke Publications building
near Terman Engineering Building and
Roble Hall, may not be the easiest to find).
I 've assembled a top-notch,creative,driven
and fun loving staff to provide you with a high
quality, student-run newspaper. But 1 also
look forward to hearing from you, the readers,
and doing all that 1 can to make the paper bet
ter Welcome to Ilie Stanford Daily, Volume
230.1 lope to see you around the office.
