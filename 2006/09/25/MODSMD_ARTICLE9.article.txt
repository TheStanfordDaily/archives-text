## Stanford demystified 
### 
A 14:30 yesterday afternoon I pulled in to
an empty spot in the Tresidder lot and
spent several minutes wandering be
tween cars, trying to remember whether free
parking on campus starts at 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. and
looking for a sign that would tell me the answer.
There was a time not too long ago (three
years, to be exact) when I could have rattled
off that magic hour, along with a hundred
other random Stanford facts and statistics,
without a second thought. All while walking
backwards, reversing my left and right and
avoiding those wooden poles we call "bol
lards" for no apparent reason.
I lowcver. not only am I no longer a giddy
Stanford tour guide, I am also no longer a
sprightly Stanford undergrad. As of yester
day. when I dropped my color-coded enve
lope in the correct slot at Old Union (it takes
at least four years to figure that system out),
I am now officially a (sketchy?) Stanford
grad student.
Although I have no plans of sporting bike
bands around my pant legs any time soon. 1
know that I have aged in at least one arena:
I have a burning desire to share the many
pearls of wisdom I've acquired at the ripe
old age of 24.
More specifically, I feel the urge to destroy
a few of the most prevalent, most erroneous
and most dangerous Stanford myths. St), be
fore you get behind in your other reading,
read on and consider yourself enlightened.
Myth #1: Shopping classes is awesome;
you don't have to do any work for the first
week of the quarter.
Truth #1: Shopping is a misnomer — you
cannot just push the cart up and down the
aisles, pulling random items off of the
shelves and then reading the nutritional info
(read: syllabus).The more clothing you pull
off the rack, the more overwhelmed von will
be when you get to the dressing room.There
is a reason why they have a limit to the num
ber of items you can take with you. and it's
not just to prevent shoplifting.
rhe only way to try a class on for size on is
to start doing the required work. Relying
solely on the syllabus would be the equivalent
ol expecting that a size two means the same
thing in every clothing store,or expecting that
the picture on the front of the box is an accu
rate depiction of what you'll find inside.
Myth #2: l ull Moon on the Quad is only
for freshmen and seniors.
Truth #2: Like every other annual tradi
tion (the Band Run, MuFuUnSun),
FMOTQ will only happen four times in four
years. And you'll spend the rest of your life
talking about it.
Myth #3: Having a real relationship at
Stanford is the equivalent of taking a five
unit class.
Truth #3:1 don't know — I never had one
that lasted an entire quarter. If we're com
paring interactions with the opposite sex to
classes, sec comments regarding Myth #1 for

further insight. I have, for the record,
dropped before the drop deadline. I'm talk
ing about classes, obviously.
Myth #4: The Draw requires as much
forethought and discussion as possible; get
started early. In fact, for the best possible re
sults, you should have chosen your draw
mates yesterday.
Truth #4: Ilie sooner you start talking
about Ilie Draw, the more drama there will
be by the time you actually get assigned.
ITiere are no undiscovered Row houses and
no such thing as the perfect number of peo
ple for a group.
Also, there is no correlation between so
cial capability and Draw number (read: Bob
will not necessarily be full of the coolest peo
ple on campus. I know. I lived there.)
Myth #5: Trying to do all the reading in
college is like trying to take a drink of water
from a fire hose.
Truth #5: ITiis statement does not just
apply to doing the reading. It applies to near
ly everything here —just take a look at the
number of tables at the activities fair.
Myth #6: College is best the time
of your life.
Truth #6: This is a tough one. It's
hard to argue that life gets much eas
ier than paying one bill every four
months and enjoying a fully stocked
open kitchen without once setting
foot in a grocery store. On the other
hand, you're supposed to be choos
ing the classes/major/summer intern
ship that will determine what you do
for the rest of your life. No pressure.
I'd say the jury's still out on this
one. After all. I may be wearing a
bike helmet right now (myth #7: all
grad students wear bike helmets;
truth #7: only the ones who want to
preserve the brains that have now
cost them no less than $ 150,000), but
I'm having a damn good time.
