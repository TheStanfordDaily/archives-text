# How not to talk to the police
## 
### 
As a college student, you and law en
forcement meet in interesting ways.
In many ways you are natural rivals
in the big animal kingdom: like mongoose
and snakes, wiener dogs and Semi-trucks —
you are in constant struggle with one anoth
er.
To some college students, police are often
mistaken for their toothless counterpart —
the campus security. Campus security is the
group of people who bravely protect you
from parties going past 1 a.m. They pack
about as much firepower as Elmo. They will
feebly slap you with a minor in possession, or
even dumber, biking while intoxicated. Cam
pus security lives in partial fear of the college
student, because security officers live alone
and naked except for those orange reflective
vests, rocking themselves to sleep in the cor
ner of the room while listening to old "Mork
and Mindy" reruns.
But the police are the real deal.They will
pull you over, ticket you, search your car and
throw you in jail for a night, allowing you to
be "your friend's friend" who spent that
night in the slammer. They'll indulge the
story to make it seem like you did something
really impressive, like dude,you were on like,
nine drugs and naked and you rode a horse
naked through the President's house and
everyone was like 'holy shit, he's naked!' etc.
But really you just passed out in the grass in
a pool of your own fluids. Regardless of the
truth, congratulations, you are now part of
suburban legend.
When you are pulled over, there are sev
eral things you must do.'llirn off MC Hawk
ings' "All My Shootings Be Drivebys" play
ing on your stereo. Pull to the side of the
road. Shit your pants. This last step is impor
tant because unless they smell that fear on
you. they will wait in their car with the spot
light on you for 15 minutes while you envi
sion they are getting a good bead on your go
nads for when the SWAT team snipers final
ly deploy.
Being polite to the officer is a bad call, be
cause they will assume you are nervous and
have something to hide. Being impolite to

the officer is a sure fire way to meet his best
friend, the billv club, and his other best
friend, the unreported incident of police bru
tality. So basically, everything you say will be
used against you so the officer can claim you
are stoned/a threat. Play dead. They may be
come so frustrated by the amount of paper
work they would have to do for "driving
while dead" that they will just pretend they
didn't find you. Or.perhaps these officers are
allergic to zombies and will run away scared.
And remember, if you are dead, they can't
ticket you.
If he/she brings up the fact that you go to
college, i.e. "You're paying so much for edu
cation, you'd think you'd renew your regis
tration" or "Can't go 25, eh,college boy?" or
"What? They never taught you in college
that blow-up dolls can't be used to justify the
carpool lane?" Let it go. Don't ask what col
lege they went to. Don't mention your
grades. Don't say you're from out of state.
Don't break into "Louie Louie."
11 he reads your license and tells you your
full legal name, don't correct him by telling
him the colloquial nickname you've picked
up. Colloquialisms make him think you're
on drugs. Much like everything else you do.
So don't bring up your college nickname, es
pecially if it's "Da Kop Killa." I've had
iriends call me that and campus security
tailed my bike like some scene out of "ET."
Don't bring up the fact that you are an hon
ors student or an Eagle Scout, because they
will use that against you. It's tempting to just
hand them your resume and say "LOOK!
I'M A GOOD CITIZEN! GO ARREST
THAT DOUCHE DOWN THE HALL
WHO LIT HIS CURTAINS ON EIRE

WHILE ON ACID." But that'd be dumb.
You re not above the law. We are all equal
under the disdainful eyes of the police. That
is, we are all on something.
By now, for example, the officer should
expect you have more drugs than Courtney
Love s purse. Even if you're not stoned, you
are. "Son, if I search this vehicle, will I find
any illegal substances?" Nope. "No guns,
swords or drugs'?" Swords? Really? What am
I, the Highlander? Um. no. "Are you sure
you re not in possession of pot, dope, mari
juana, hemp, reefer or marijuana?" You said
marijuana twice... I mean, no. "Step out of the
car, please."
For me, being asked these questions is
kind of ironic. I don't smoke so I'm never
worried they 11 lind it on me. But I do wonder
it my burned copies of Cake albums or my
empty cereal boxes will somehow land me in
trouble. 10-4. We have a 398, opened Gener
al Mills box container. Proceeding with cavi
ty searches. I always knew my addiction to
( ookie ( risp would get me in trouble some
day I think to myself as I hear him put on the
rubber gloves.
But the cop kind ol chuckles when he asks
about illegal substances. He knows I'm on
something, but he doesn't know it's sugar
frosted cereal. My state of nervousness
makes me appear stoned. And as he shines
the flashlight over my eyes and looks in the
back seat again, I realize: Every college stu
dent appears this way. Even if we have noth
ing to hide, we re all agitated; we are all on
drugs.
ITiis is the lesson I learned last night.
None of us are ever clean. In reality, I may
have been driving back from a party last
night, sober and bored. But in the police offi
cers world, dude, like, I was on nine drugs
and robbed several liquor stores. Naked. You
can check the trunk of the car. Officer. The
horse should be next to the guns and contra
band.
