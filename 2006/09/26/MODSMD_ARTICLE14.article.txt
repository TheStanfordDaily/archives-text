# Senior captain leads young team
## Driver Tyler Drake predicts Stanford squad will turn into competitive force

ITie Stanford men's water polo team is in
good hands. The squad may have lost a num
ber of the key players that helped carry the
Cardinal to the Final Four and may rely on a
number of freshman, but still, there is no lack
of leadership.
Senior captain driver Tyler Drake holds the
young group together. He is confident in his
young teammates, but also cognizant that with

six freshman on the roster, consistency in the
pool will take time.
"Although most of the team is composed of
younger players, we have all become very
close, almost like a family, since a lot of us have
lived together in [Kappa Alpha] and spend
most of our free time hanging out together,"
Drake said.
In the water, the team (5-3) has relied on
balanced scoring without a definitive, go-to
superstar. Despite the lack of a star scorer, the

Cardinal remain a cohesive and well-rounded
group under the leadership of the coaching
staff and the team's two captains. Drake and
fellow senior JJ Garton.
"My co-captain. JJ Garton, has been an in
tegral part of welcoming these young players
into our team and offering his insights both on
and off the pool," Drake said.
There has been a conscious effort, led by
