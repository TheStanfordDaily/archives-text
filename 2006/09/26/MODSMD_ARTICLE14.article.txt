# Senior captain leads young team
## Driver Tyler Drake predicts Stanford squad will turn into competitive force 
### ANDREW SHEN 
ITie Stanford men's water polo team is in
good hands. The squad may have lost a num
ber of the key players that helped carry the
Cardinal to the Final Four and may rely on a
number of freshman, but still, there is no lack
of leadership.
Senior captain driver Tyler Drake holds the
young group together. He is confident in his
young teammates, but also cognizant that with

six freshman on the roster, consistency in the
pool will take time.
"Although most of the team is composed of
younger players, we have all become very
close, almost like a family, since a lot of us have
lived together in [Kappa Alpha] and spend
most of our free time hanging out together,"
Drake said.
In the water, the team (5-3) has relied on
balanced scoring without a definitive, go-to
superstar. Despite the lack of a star scorer, the

Cardinal remain a cohesive and well-rounded
group under the leadership of the coaching
staff and the team's two captains. Drake and
fellow senior JJ Garton.
"My co-captain. JJ Garton, has been an in
tegral part of welcoming these young players
into our team and offering his insights both on
and off the pool," Drake said.

Senior co-captain and driver Tyler Drake has been to three NCAA National Championships with the Stanford water polo squad. The team has a
5-3 record this season and has lost three consecutive matches, but Drake is confident that the team will improve. He particularly looks at three
freshmen who will help push the team forward.

ed youngsters on this year's squad.
With the team's relative inexperi
ence, team chemistry will he even
more important this season. Drake
will be among the most important fa
cilitators.
"The most important factor in de
veloping these young players comes
from the team's leadership and sup
port," Drake said. "This has never
been a problem for our team since
we are so close."
Right now, the Cardinal are going
through some struggles they had

rarely encountered over the past few
years. Stanford has suffered a three
game losing streak extending back to
the NorCal Tournament and now
faces a formidable challenge in
UCLA next weekend.
Overcoming the challenge, how
ever, does not intimidate Drake and
the Card. Drake realizes that the re
cent slump is merely a bump in the
road for this fledgling squad.
"Despite our tough loss this past
weekend, 1 have a lot of faith in our
team," Drake said. "We are a young
team with potential and are current
ly learning to play together."
The Long Beach, Calif., native is
confident that the team will improve,
specifically pointing out three key
freshman as major contributors.
"1 predict that as the season pro

gresses, we will be a strong compet
itive force. The younger players are
coming into their own," Drake said.
"Janson Wigo and Drac Wigo have
really proven themselves offensive
ly. and Sage Wright has displayed
his talents on both ends of the
pool."
Outside the pool, Drake said he
enjoys spending time with his girl
friend and his teammates. For now,
though, he will have to exert his lead
ership in preparation for UCLA on
Saturday, and for California the
week after.
"My goal for this season is the
same as every other season, to win
the national championship," Drake
said. "I believe that the combination
of our talent and our closeness make
us strong contenders for the title."
