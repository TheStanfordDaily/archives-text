# Mistakes were made
## Bad calls, imperfection and the human aspect are inevitable in sports. 
### 
Opening my emails last week
end. 1 spotted an interesting
subject line sent by my fellow
Casa Zapata ETA: Oregon-Okla
homa flash movie.
Just about a week ago, both he
and 1 had gone insane watching an
intense finish to the Ducks-Sooners
game, cheering on the implausible
Oregon comeback. With just a
minute and half left in the fourth
quarter, the No. 13 Ducks trailed the
No. 15 Sooners by 13. All hope was
lost for the faithful in Eugene, who,
unlike our own "Red Zone" last Sat
urday, continued to keep the stadium
packed even after it appeared that
Bob Stoops and his team would
leave with the win. But with
72 seconds remaining on the clock, a
miraculous Oregon touchdown led
to an onside kick. It was successfully
retrieved by the Ducks, who put to
gether yet another touchdown-scor
ing drive to secure the 34-33 lead
with 4(i seconds left. Oregon would
hang on to that lead to steal a win
from the Big 12.
Hie onside kick itself was imme
diately followed by a booth review.

A Dose of Truf'
Upon seeing the replay, the game's
commentators — as well as the en
tire home audience — could clearly
see that an Oregon player had
touched the ball before it traveled
the required 10 yards. So as the refer
ees reviewed their call, we Pac-10
homers hung our heads in disap
pointment, waiting for a reversal. Yet
much to our surprise, and the chagrin
of Oklahoma fans, the zebras an
nounced that no conclusive evidence
could reverse the call.
And that brings me back to the
email. The flash video features a
green duck posing as a Pac-10 refer
ee answering questions about the
controversial call. The duck uses ob
viously ridiculous statements to de
fend the decision; his main argument
is that the Oregon players and fans
would not have been celebrating had
the Ducks not recovered the ball.
This video echoes the frustration
of many college football fans
throughout the nation,especially the
Oklahoma faithful. Just a few hours
after the game had become history,
Oklahoma demanded the game's re
sults be obliterated.The Pac-10 even
suspended the refs involved with the
instant replay. Yet a thousand apolo

gies could still do nothing to cool off
an irritated Stoops, who claimed Ok
lahoma was robbed of the victory
and a potential Howl berth.
If only the sore Sooners could
take a lesson from every other team
out there that's been robbed before.
The list is innumerable,and sever
al infamous instances come to mind.
Reggie Bush's illegal push of Matt
Leinart in last year's epic between
Southern California and Notre
Dame wrongfully kept USC's na
tional title push alive. Speaking of
USC, I'll still make the argument
that one or two bad calls during last
year's Rose Bowl prevented the Tro
jans from claiming their third con
secutive national title. And of course,
there's also the several forward lat
erals tin own by the Golden Bears
during the (yes, I'm sorry to bring it
up again) 1982 Big Game.
Ask any baseball manager how
much one blown call can mean the
difference between a win and a
gloomy ride home from the stadium.
And in the wonderful world of base
ball, that one win could also mean
the difference between postseason
dreams and watching the Tigers and
Dodgers in the 2006 World Series
(yeah. I said it).
But that's one thing 1 love about
baseball.The human aspect.
Hie nation's pastime isn't de
pendent on some instant replay sys
tem. No. it's subject to humans, hu

mans that can and will make mis-" 2
takes. Sure, managers can argUQ*.3
against the umpires, but very rarely
will a call actually be reversed. The; '
umpire has the ultimate authority, as * *
evidenced by his ability to eject any
manager who gets out of hand with
his arguing.
But Stoops won't get ejected. In
stead, the referees from the game
were the ones penalized.
It is also unfair that so much at
tention is paid to bad calls during the
closing seconds while several game
changing calls are blown throughout
the course of the entire game. Seven
points are worth the same when it
comes to the final score,
they are collected in the first or
fourth quarter.
When it comes to sports, mistakes
are inevitable. It's merely part of the
imperfect, humanistic aspect to the
game. So don't waste tears on that
last-minute bad call, especially when
there are a dozen mistakes called in
one's favor throughout the entire
game.
Besides, despite all the controver
sy, Oklahoma still had a chance to
win the game with a field goal in the
closing seconds. And upon that kick
being blocked, the Sooners forwent
any leverage for sympathy.
