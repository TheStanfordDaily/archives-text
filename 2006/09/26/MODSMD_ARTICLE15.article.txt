Opening my emails last week
end. 1 spotted an interesting
subject line sent by my fellow
Casa Zapata ETA: Oregon-Okla
homa flash movie.
Just about a week ago, both he
and 1 had gone insane watching an
intense finish to the Ducks-Sooners
game, cheering on the implausible
Oregon comeback. With just a
minute and half left in the fourth
quarter, the No. 13 Ducks trailed the
No. 15 Sooners by 13. All hope was
lost for the faithful in Eugene, who,
unlike our own "Red Zone" last Sat
urday, continued to keep the stadium
packed even after it appeared that
Bob Stoops and his team would
leave with the win. But with
72 seconds remaining on the clock, a
miraculous Oregon touchdown led
to an onside kick. It was successfully
retrieved by the Ducks, who put to
gether yet another touchdown-scor
ing drive to secure the 34-33 lead
with 4(i seconds left. Oregon would
hang on to that lead to steal a win
from the Big 12.
Hie onside kick itself was imme
diately followed by a booth review.
