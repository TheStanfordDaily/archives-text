## Women finish 1-1 in first week of conference play Team holds Pacific recordholder scoreless in 2-1 win 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Two strong performances over the past
week had different outcomes for the Stanford
field hockey team.Thus, a 4-7 season record is
not entirely representative of this season's
talent.
ITie Cardinal took a 2-1 win in Pacific on
Thursday before they fell 3-2 to a highly
ranked California team at home on Satur
day. Both matches were close, one-goal
games — something the Cardinal have
faced many times this season. They have
played eight one-goal games and have lost
five of those tilts.
Freshman Rachel Mozenter provided the
win in Stockton, as she scored Stanford's two
goals of the day. Mozenter, a forward from
Ohio, had five shots and both of her goals
were off of rebounds.
Stanford led 1 -0 before the Tigers tied the
game in the lbth minute. Almost a half hour
passed before the Cardinal scored the game
winner. Mozenter rebounded in her own
blocked shot at 46:41 for the Cardinal's first
Northern Pacific Conference victory.
ITie defense kept senior Vianney Campos

(Pacific's top scorer with 32 points and 15
goals on the season) scoreless. Campos, who
holds multiple records for the Tigers and is
one of the top players in the nation, took eight
shots. Stanford junior goalkeeper Madison
Bell had eight saves.
llie second NorPac game on the Card's
schedule was Sunday at home against the No.
13 Golden Bears. The Cardinal attempted a
tie in the hot afternoon heat, but faced a fa
miliar fate yet again. Stanford has five regular
season losses in the last three years against its
cross-Bay rival.
Valentina Godfrid continued to be a thorn
for the Cardinal as she scored the game-win
ner at 53:50.The senior forward had two goals
in the game.
The Bears went up 2-0 early before Stan
ford notched a goal at 49:19. Julia Drewes
scored her first goal of the day when she re
bounded a shot past goalkeeper Veronica
Sykes and into the net. Godfrid followed that
with her second goal — the game-winner —
to make the score 3-1.
Drewes brought Stanford to within one
with a goal 10 minutes later. She leads the
Cardinal squad with eight goals. Bell had four
saves.
Stanford is now 1-1 in NorPac play. The
team faces Pacific again on Saturday in a non
conference match-up. Game time is slated for
I p.m. at the Stanford Varsity Field Hockey
T\irf.
