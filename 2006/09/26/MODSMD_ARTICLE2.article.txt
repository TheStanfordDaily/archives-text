thought nothing was wrong as she
stepped out of Building 460 early
yesterday morning, and hopped
onto her bike to ride off into anoth

However, the Stanford Depart

erwise.
"I was yelled at twice â€” 1 had no
idea what was going on," Cornwell
said. "It very quickly clicked what
was happening."
Cornwell was one of countless
targets of a police initiative to
spread the word about new rules
prohibiting students from riding or
parking their bikes in the arcades in
and around the Main Quad. Start

Public Safety employees canvassed
the arcades with sandwich-board
signs explaining the new rules and
ordering riders to dismount.
By mid-morning, walkways were
littered with parked bikes sporting
yellow fliers, stapled on offending
bicycles by police. The fliers warned
that bikes parked in arcades "will
be removed or booted (locked)
with a U-Lock by the SIJDPS."
"I'd heard rumors of this," Corn

"I walked my bike here so I am

parked her bike between Building
50 and Memorial Church.
The reason for the ban. accord
ing to the fliers, is to "create a safer
central campus for pedestrians and
bicyclists, preserve facilities, and
minimize the disruption of Univer
sity activities through the elimina

The Daily reported last week
that bicyclists have six weeks of
warning before tickets are handed
out.
A call to the Department of
Public Safety representative was
not immediately returned.
On average, two students are
hospitalized for bicycle-related in
juries each week, though it is un
clear how many specifically occur
in the Main Quad or the surround

Some students expressed a will
ingness to sacrifice some safety for
quality of life.
"Part of why I came to Stanford
is because people ride bikes to
class and in the Quad," Cornwell
said. "When you take that away,
you lose some of our California
charm."
