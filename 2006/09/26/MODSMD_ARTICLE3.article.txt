## Academic publishers reap profits Textbook price-gouging leaves students' wallets pinched, Bookstore frustrated 
### ANTHONY SANCHEZ KZSU NEWS 
The paper to make the books grows on trees, but at
the prices students shell out for required texts, they say
the money should too.
"My wallet gets gutted every time I have to buy text
books," said senior Eduardo Martinez, expressing a
common sentiment among students.
"I think textbook prices are pretty absurd," sopho
more Mario Silva said.
Joe Moore, the Course Materials Manager at the
Stanford Bookstore, says he is aware of student dissatis
faction. He said he has tried to educate students on the
issue to mitigate not only their frustration but miscon-

ceptions too, speaking to the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate last year.
"Our pricing formulas are the
same as they were 20 years ago," he
said. "What has changed are the
textbook industry and the prices the
producers set. It's unfortunate that *
I'm not able to effectively commu
nicate with all the students."
Textbook prices have also caught
the attention of Congress. In June, the
Advisory Committee on Student Finan
cial Assistance began investigating high
textbook costs and their impact on stu
dents.
California is the nation's second-largest
textbook market with state consumers
spending more than $4 billion in 2004, ac-

cording to a report from the Govern
ment Accountability Office (GAO)
last year. Americans spent more than
$40 billion on textbooks nationwide
in 2004.
Three companies, McGraw Hill.
Pearson-Prentice Hall t-ducation
and Harcourt Publishing, control 69
percent of the textbook industry, the
GAO report continued. Due to this
diminished competition, the average
student has been forced to spend
more than $9(X) per year on text
hooks.
"I just bought three books for
$280," said sophomore Winnie Wang.
"I know that there's a textbook I
bought last year that's more expen
sive now."
Textbook prices have increased
186 percent since 1986. an annual in
crease of about six percent. By com
parison.consumer prices rose 72 per
cent over that period, and college tu
ition and fees rose 240 percent, the
GAO report stated.
Nearly two-thirds of those re
ceipts end up in publishers' coffers.
12 percent of the book price goes to
ward the author's royalties. 23 per
cent goes to the store, 32 percent
pays for the publisher's costs, and an
other 32 percent is publisher profit,
according to the National Associa
tion of College Bookstores,
Attempts by college bookstores
to circumvent the high-priced text
book market with used textbook
buyback programs have met limited
success.
However, some students ex
pressed dissatisfaction with selling
back books. Many pointed to in
stances where a book is bought back
for $ 1.50, only to be resold at $ 15.
"I sold some back last quarter and
it was obscene, "Martinezsaid."l had
paid a lot of money for this one book
only for it to be bought back for a
tiny fraction of the cost."
Moore countered that the Stan
ford Bookstore buys back two differ
ent types of used books at two differ
ent pricing rates.
One rate is for a used textbook,
one not known to be needed next
quarter at Stanford. In that case, the
text is sold to used book company,
which accounts for the low buyback
price and the high resell value with

shipping and storage costs and third
party profit factored in.
TTie other rate is for a used text
book that will be in use again, as the
bookstore buys back the textbook to
resell. Ilie purchase certainty and
the elimination of a third party allow
for an average of 50-75 percent dis
counts on used textbooks and more
cash from buybacks.
According to Moore, however,
the latter type of used textbooks de
pends solely on faculty.
"We prefer buying used books
from students, but we cannot if the
instructor did not turn in a book
order for the next quarter." Moore
said.
Without punctual book orders or
notification that the same book will
be used again, the value of the used
books decreases significantly, he
added.
According to a report issued in
the winter of 2004 by the California
Student Public Interest Research
Group (CalPlßG),entitled.'Rip-off
101: How the Current Practices of
the Publishing Industry Drive up the
Cost of College Textbooks," publish
ers are retaliating by attempting to
circumvent the used textbook mar
ket themselves.
CaIPIRG, which surveyed 156
faculty members and 480 college stu
dents from 10 public colleges and
universities across California, laid
the blame at the feet of the publish
ers. The group concluded publishers
are offering expensive supplements
like online courseware as a means of
"gouging students, 'bundling' their

evolve little, if at all. such as Latin.
"Sixty-five percent of faculty
'rarely' or 'never' use the bundled
materials in their courses and 59 per
cent of students who searched for a
used book for the fall 2003
quarter/semester were unable to find
even one used book for their class
es," the report stated.
In 2003,The New York Times re
ported that American textbooks are
available in overseas markets for
roughly half of what American stu
dents pay, and that the books are
identical, save for a change of ISBN
and cover.
Publishers have fought hard to
stop overseas textbooks from reen
tering the U.S market. A ruling in
1998 by the U.S. Supreme Court
tound that federal copyright laws do
not protect text manufacturers from
having their books originally sold in
foreign markets and shipped back to
the U.S. for resale at a discount.
Moore added that students and
faculty can both help curb textbook
prices.
"I urge faculty to use, as much as
possible, the same materials for
classes and to inform us of your deci
sions so that way we can buy back
used books ourselves," he said. "1
also urge students to sell buy and sell
used textbooks. If both do their part,
it is possible to circumvent the huge
publishers that are charging the high
textbook prices."
