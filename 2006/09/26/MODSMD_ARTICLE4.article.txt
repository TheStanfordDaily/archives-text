# STUDENT GROUPS
## Roosevelt to offer two-unit Public Policy course Abrams and political guests also to lecture 
### KATHERINE COX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's student think tank, the
Roosevelt Institution, will now have a
student-initiated course to call its own.
The course, PUBPOL 5351, Creating
and Analyzing Public Policy: The Roo
sevelt Institution, will be more introduc
tory than thematic, though visiting lec
turers from the political arena will allow
for a more specific focus on select topics,
organizers said.

Human Biology Professor William
Abrams, who has given courses on the
death penalty and youth and the law, will
be the course advisor and give the first
two and final lectures.
"[Abrams' lectures] will give students a
sense of the academic study of policy
making as well as the basic motivations
behind developing the Roosevelt
model," said Eric Mitzenmacher, presi
dent of the Roosevelt Institution's cam
pus chapter.
California State Senators Jackie
Speier and Joe Simitian and U.S. Repre
sentative Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from
San Jose, Calif., are also among the
scheduled visiting speakers. They
will concentrate on normative policy
making, rather than analyzing exist
ing policy.
"This distinction was drawn
largely to allow our course to pro
vide viewpoints that are not quite as
common throughout the rest of the
Public Policy department, which
runs primarily on a descriptive

basis," Mitzenmacher said.
Hie two-unit, autumn course will
meet weekly on Tuesday evenings
from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Students will at
tend Center meetings based on their
policy interests during the second
hour of the time-slot. The Center Di
rectors, graduate or undergraduate
fellows with a strong background in
a particular field who have previous
ly led meetings with interested mem
bers, will act as the course TAs.
The Roosevelt Institution, the na
tion's first student-run think tank,
was established at Stanford in Feb.
2(M)5.
