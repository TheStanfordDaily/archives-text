New Diabetes Research Conducted
at School of Medicine
The School of Medicine recently
produced potentially groundbreaking
research regarding diabetes and the ef
fect of protein regulator calcineurin.
Seung Kim. an assistant professor of
developmental biology,discovered the
importance of calcineurin and NFA'I
for insulin-producing pancreatic beta
cells while researching calcineurin-in
hibiting drugs in mice..
In humans with diabetes,beta cells
produce an insufficient amount of in
sulin, which precludes the body from
metabolizing sugars. Individuals with
out diabetes, however, sometimes ac
quire the condition when the protein
calcineurin is limited.
Through mice-based research of
calcineurin and NFAT, Kim discov
ered that NFAT could produce new
beta cells as the mice aged and ulti
mately enable the mice to produce
healthy amounts of insulin. Kim's re
search provided substantial insight
into proteins and diabetes, and similar
results in humans could inspire pro
foundly more effective drugs for type

2, adult-onset diabetes.
Kim's research was published in
Nature on Sept. 21.

Alternate Ranking System
Proposed for Universities
A new report by nonprofit research
group Education Sector has called for a
change in the ranking system used for
universities and colleges in the United
States. The report placed a greater em
phasis on teaching quality and stu
dents' success following graduation.
The report's author. Kevin Carey,
criticized the current ranking system
employed by U.S. News and World
Report, arguing that it unfairly re
warded affluent and exclusive
schools. Regarding his ranking sys
tem. Carey claimed that his proposal
was "student based" and objective.
Currently, education analysts rely
on teaching data from the National
Survey of Student Engagement for
ranking and policy purposes. In the
latest U.S. News and World Report
rankings, Stanford was placed fourth.
