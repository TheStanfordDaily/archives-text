## Pulitzer winner calls for global media presence L.A. Times reporter Gary Cohn speaks of ground (and ship) breaking reporting 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Speaking to an older and predominantly conservative
audience in Arrillaga Alumni Center yesterday, Pulitzer
Prize winning journalist Gary Cohn argued that newspa
pers ought to think globally and not locally, as the recent
industry trend has been.
"We need people who will take stories they find in their
own backyards and follow them across the globe, people
who can connect local readers to the larger world," said
Cohn, currently an investigative reporter for The Los An
geles Times.
He emphasized the importance of entrepreneurial
journalism in a day and age where the majority of news is
pre-packaged and pre-scripted.
"Great stories don't start from a bunch of editors or
writers sitting around a newsroom and trying to think big
thoughts," he said.
To demonstrate the value of global reporting, Cohn de
scribed his award-winning coverage of the shipbreaking
industry for The Baltimore Sun. The series, which unfold
ed in the winter of 1997, revealed the dangers posed to
workers and the environment when discarded naval ships
were dismantled and sold for scrap. With fellow Sun writer
Will Englund. Cohn followed the shipbreaking industry
across the country and eventually to India.
"We found serious problems with the industry in every
place we went, and that started to get us more excited," he
said.
Citing the obstacles he encountered, Cohn emphasized
the importance of taking risks in journalism. When the
shipyard directors forbade them from entering the prop
erty, Cohn and Englund sat in their cars and waited to fol
low the workers home.
"It wasn't a big intellectual feat." Cohn said. "But it's
what you have to do. and the workers began to gain confi
dence in us."
Halfway through the process, Cohn received word that
the Navy was selling its ships to India
to increase profits and avoid accusa
tions of impropriety. Cohn and En
glund followed the ships, only to find
the situation there significantly
worse.
"The working environment in
India made standards in the United
States look absolutely terrific," Cohn
said,"At this point, it really became a
global story."
Cohn and Englund wrote a three
part expose that revealed govern-

mental environmental abuse and
worker-safety violations in the ship
breaking industry.
"We were really able to raise pol
icy questions with this." Cohn said.
"There were two sets of Congres
sional hearings and the Navy ended
up changing their standards tor ship
breaking."
He attributed much of his success
to the pressure by his editorial board
to "go all the way." Cohn said he wor
ried that with all the current cut
backs in print journalism, there will
be much less "time, money and will
ingness to pursue these special sto
ries" in the future. He also expressed
anxiety about the new focus on local
izing newspapers.

"They should cover their back
yard. but that doesn't mean stopping
at their backyard," he said.
Cohn's talk was one in a series of
Hoover media events aimed at shar
ing different journalistic perspec
tives through seminars and informal
meetings within the Stanford com
munity.
While the majority of the audi
ence responded positively to Cohn's
perspectives on the media, there
were a few comments questioning
the legitimacy of the press today.
One audience member spoke out on
the biased nature of the Iraq war
coverage, calling pieces by the New
York Times and Los Angeles Times
"propaganda."
