## The
						hows and whys of the Editorial Board 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA AND NATALIE JABBAR 
In the past few days, we've run several
advertisements asking students and
other community members to join Hie
Daily's Editorial Board. But few may know
the actual roles and duties of the Board's
members. We would like to t;ike this oppor
tunity to explain the details surrounding
the position as well as the overall goals of
the Board.
The Editorial Board is comprised of a few
Daily staffers, including us the two Opin
ions Editors, as well as a handful of students
not otherwise affiliated with the paper.
While each edit is written by one member of
the board, all of them remain unsigned. The
anonymity allows the Board's opinions to
transcend the potential individual biases of
each member.
Hie Board's purpose is to provide ;t uni
fied opinion on issues affecting the Stanford
community. Members brainstorm ideas and
meet once a week in order to share thoughts
and ultimately decide which issues the
Board will cover. The Board adopts a stand

on each issue based on majority consensus.
When a majority consensus cannot be
reached, the Board may opt to write sepa
rate pieces reflecting opposing opinions, if a
board member expresses strong disagree
ment with the majority position, he or she
may write a signed dissenting editorial.
I Editorials are not simply rants. Each issue
is both thoroughly researched and considers
counterarguments.
So what are we looking for. you may ask?
(iood editorial board members are aware of
what is going on around them, receptive to
opposing opinions and passionate about tak
ing a stand. A strong writing background is
encouraged, and reliability is a must.
Think you're ready for the job? Send two
sample edits (600-800 words), 10 future ideas
and a short cover letter with contact infor
mation and an explanation of any previous
experience to opinions@daily.stanford.edu.

or vickvd( n 'stanford.edu. We're looking for
ward to working with you this volume!
