# Fight for our right to bike

### 
President Hennessy,
Stanford is defined by many things. Hie
size of our campus, our leisurely (cynics
call it bored) strain of Nor( al living, the
tragic majesty of our football program, the
whole Little I.eland thing. But the first thing
you notice is the bicycles. Nearly any infor
mation pamphlet, NSC) booklet, college
guide and Facebook photo album has one
spin on the iconic image: a student biking
through the arcades of the quad, maybe
etched in silhouette against the Oval or
Mem Chu. You can smell the flowers, feel
the warm afternoon sunlight and see
Hoover Tower rising in the background. Its
goddamn poetry.
I understand that in creating this ban you
think that you are trying to stop bicycle acci
dents. I admire you. or whoever conceived
this idea, for doing what you or thev feel is
best tor the students. Ilie Bike Ban is an ex
ceedingly reasonable proposition. After all.
where is the harm? Students will need to
wake up a few minutes earlier? Walk their
bikes those last few inches to class?
But just because something is safer and
reasonable does not mean it is good or just.
I do not wear a helmet when I ride a hike he
cause. on some strange adolescent level. I
just like how the wind feels flowing through
my hair. In an accident. I would be 100 per

cent loss likely to die if I wore a helmet. It's a
risk we take.
I realize that this email may seem silly,
since the ban only applies to the breezeway
arcades ol the Quad.The total loss to our on
campus biking area is perhaps .004 percent.
I his is only a small matter. We will all adapt.
My brother, a freshly minted law student
(and the fourth Franich at Stanford,after my
great uncle, my father and myself) ponders
wh\ I care so much. Universities are corpo
rations. Bicycle accidents can lead to law
suits in our debased, litigious modern age. It
makes good business sense.
To hell with all that. In my years here, I
have borne witness to a disturbing adminis
trative trend. I do not think the administra
tion is listening to the students anymore. I do
not think the administration understands
the students anymore. And I worry that the
