# Fight for our right to bike
## 
### 
President Hennessy,
Stanford is defined by many things. Hie
size of our campus, our leisurely (cynics
call it bored) strain of Nor( al living, the
tragic majesty of our football program, the
whole Little I.eland thing. But the first thing
you notice is the bicycles. Nearly any infor
mation pamphlet, NSC) booklet, college
guide and Facebook photo album has one
spin on the iconic image: a student biking
through the arcades of the quad, maybe
etched in silhouette against the Oval or
Mem Chu. You can smell the flowers, feel
the warm afternoon sunlight and see
Hoover Tower rising in the background. Its
goddamn poetry.
I understand that in creating this ban you
think that you are trying to stop bicycle acci
dents. I admire you. or whoever conceived
this idea, for doing what you or thev feel is
best tor the students. Ilie Bike Ban is an ex
ceedingly reasonable proposition. After all.
where is the harm? Students will need to
wake up a few minutes earlier? Walk their
bikes those last few inches to class?
But just because something is safer and
reasonable does not mean it is good or just.
I do not wear a helmet when I ride a hike he
cause. on some strange adolescent level. I
just like how the wind feels flowing through
my hair. In an accident. I would be 100 per

cent loss likely to die if I wore a helmet. It's a
risk we take.
I realize that this email may seem silly,
since the ban only applies to the breezeway
arcades ol the Quad.The total loss to our on
campus biking area is perhaps .004 percent.
I his is only a small matter. We will all adapt.
My brother, a freshly minted law student
(and the fourth Franich at Stanford,after my
great uncle, my father and myself) ponders
wh\ I care so much. Universities are corpo
rations. Bicycle accidents can lead to law
suits in our debased, litigious modern age. It
makes good business sense.
To hell with all that. In my years here, I
have borne witness to a disturbing adminis
trative trend. I do not think the administra
tion is listening to the students anymore. I do
not think the administration understands
the students anymore. And I worry that the

administration does not care to un
derstand.
To me, the problems began with
the 2004 football game against
Brigham Young University. The
Band had one of their all-too-rare
brilliant halftime shows. The Dollies
all wore wedding dresses, and the an
nouncer made a point of praising the
sacred bond "between man and
woman... and woman., and
woman..."The stuttering was a jab at
our opponent's Church-founding
namesake, who was not exactly a
monogamist.
You would think the Band had
burnt Moses, Jesus, Mohammed and
Abe Lincoln in effigy from the horri
fied national response. To this day,
local publications like The San Jose
Mercury News still bring up the inci
dent as yet another sign of the enti
tled, immoral pricknessol the Band.
Yet what gets me is that the adminis
tration did everything they could to
cut the Band loose. No one stood be
hind them. 1 refer you to an issue of
the Stanford Daily,dated September
28,2004:
"Athletic Department officials
said they were under the impression
the word "woman" should have been
partially stuttered as "wo-' in the
sentence, whereas Band officials
maintained that they thought it was
clear the scripted stutter would in
volve repeating the whole phrase
"and woman" over and over again."
The bureaucratic nattering on
display is positively Orwellian.
Which syllable of which word was
going to be stuttered! The Band is
supposed to be controversial,and al
though I understand the University
not condoning their actions, why
couldn't the Athletic Department
say something like "We do not feel
this way, but the Band is the Band
and our students are our students."

I do not want to bore you with
comparisons to other schools, but
Dartmouth has for many years now
had a kind of don't-ask-don't-tell
policy regarding the popular, nation
ally famous, quite unofficial mascot
named Keggy the Keg, whose name
is rather self-explanatory. ITie stu
dents love Keggy. many of the alum
ni love Keggy and although the Uni
versity can certainly not admit it (be
cause it would not look good for an
educational body to encourage ex
cessive drinking), they probably love
Keggy, too.
Meanwhile, our Tree has been
sorely mistreated. At last year's
Women's NCAA tournament,he was
ejected from the game for, I believe,
"dancing in a no-dance zone." Hor
rors! It's just like in "Footloose!"
Worse, our own Athletic Department
then removed him from the rest of the
tournament. President Hennessy, the
Tree was my favorite part of coming
to Stanford games when I was a kid.
When did undergraduates become an
embarrassment?
I do not pretend to understand
the circumstances which have led
your administration to this point. 1
do not know who is on the board of
directors or the board of trustees. I
do not know if several wealthy in
vestors have explicitly stated they
want the 'Free, the Band and any
semblance of fun and eccentricity re
moved from this campus or else no
new Law School dorm — nor do 1
believe such a thing.
I do not even know if you were
behind any of these decisions, if you
fought against them or for them or
not at all. I do not know how our
University works. 1 would be idiotic
to pretend to understand the diffi
culties you face governing this
school. All I know is that I am angry
and desperately want things to
change. Like many other students, I
am confused that you and your fel
low administrators, the people I once
trusted most to look out for Stan
ford's well-being, seem to be doing
nothing.
In a few years, no one will be
around to recall that Full Moon was

n't always an Absolute 112 un event,
that Band Run used to end with col
lective exultation in the Quad, and
not drowsily, with speeches,in the Sta
dium. 'I'he administration doesn't
need to worry much, because the an
noying new rules of today are the tra
ditions of tomorrow. I'he house al
ways wins, especially when they can
respond to any complaints with rea
sonable arguments. "We give you a
world-class education and an absurd
ly beautiful campus; our name will get
you well-paying jobs and wallet-chas
ing lovelies; what's a little bike restric
tion. next to that?" After all. it's just a
teensy weensy little bike ban, right?
Absolutely not. I'he Bike Ban is
wrong. This university took the boy I
was three years ago and made me the
man I am today. It has done every
thing for me. And I would be doing it
a supreme disservice if I did not
speak my mind: 1 am angry, and I feel
betrayed.
In summation, kindly revoke this
well-intentioned — but neverthe
less horrific — miscarriage of our
natural rights immediately. Re-open
the arcades of the Quad to bicycles,
or you will receive several thou
sands of these e-mails. This is not an
empty threat. I am a member of the
press and therefore control what
people think.There are several hun
dreds of other undergraduates who
feel exactly as I do. Can't we just get
along?
I have the utmost respect for you
and for the people who work with
you, which is why I trust this letter
will be read not as a criticism, but as
an exhortation. Stanford has been
great. It will be great again. It is up to
you to make that happen.
Cordially,
Darren Franich

Darren Franich is mad as hell and
wants to piss off some very important
people. E-mail him at dfranich@stan
ford.edu if you want to join in the fun.
Or just join in the fun and e-mail pres
ident@stanford.edu once or twice a
day. Crush the system using passive
aggressive e-mails!
