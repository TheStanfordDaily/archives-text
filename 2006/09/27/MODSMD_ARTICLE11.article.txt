# Interning in Redlands: MY hometown
## 
### 
Maybe it's just because the Disney
musical "Newises" makes it look so
cool, but 1 want to be a journalist
(not an uncommon ambition among Daily
reporters, of course). So I figured, what bet
ter preparation for a career in journalism
than a summer internship?
Some people believe that summer intern
ships and jobs are more important toward
determining future career success than any
thing you might do in your Stanford classes.
And yes. there is certainly a valid argument
against the internship culture that benefits
affluent students who can afford to forgo
employment in favor of unpaid internships.
But still, if there's any doubt about how
much internships are stressed, just check the
massive number of internship-geared re
sources at the Career Center
Of course. I had hardly set foot in the Ca
reer Center until last winter quarter, when I
started researching possible positions and
discovered that the majority of summer
newspaper internships have application
deadlines in October or November. Oops.
So. in March I sent a letter to the editor of
my hometown paper. I hail from glorious
Redlands, Calif., a suburb that's located in
the "Inland Empire," about halfway between
L. A. and Palm Springs,boasting a population
of about 65,(KK). Lo and behold, it was as sim
ple as that, and 1 arranged to begin an intern
ship in July.
Redlands prides itself on its history as an
orange-growing center and its conservative,
affluent feel. Oh. and Redlands has made
news in the past couple of years because of
the cross on the city seal that the AC 1.l I re
quested it to remove, leading Redlanders to
place an initiative on the ballot to attempt to
fight with a lawsuit (the measure was, fortu
nately, defeated).

So suffice it to say, "The Redlands Daily
Facts" is pretty much the essential small
town paper. One of my favorite regular fea
tures is "My Best Friend: How cute is your
pet?" which obviously consists of pictures of
Redlanders' super-cute pets. And the first ar
ticle 1 wrote for the paper was a front-page
news story on the July heat wave, including
comments from swimming pool contractors
and employees at the Y.M.C.A. swimming
pool. Hard-hitting, I know.
"It must be nice to live in a town where a
library's air conditioning breaking consti
tutes major news," a librarian told a fellow in
tern when she was working on a story on that
very subject.
Well, it actually is. And instead of per
forming stereotypical intern tasks like mak
ing coffee. I was given real work right away.
On my fourth day at the paper, local super
market chain Stater Bros, held its 50th an
niversary celebration. Ten minutes before
the event started. I was handed a camera and
a notepad and sent to cover the story. "Make
sure you interview the owner, and the
mayor!" My editor shouted as I ran out the
door. Right-o.
And I did get to work on some more sub
stantial stories, too. Benji Schwimmer. who
was crowned "America's Favorite Dancer"
at the conclusion of the Fox summer reality
show "So You Think You Can Dance?" hap

pens to be a Redlands native. Along with
another "Daily Facts" reporter, I attended
two press junkets, including the one right
after the season finale when Benji won, in
terviewing the dancers and judges along
side reporters from Fox News, E! and the
like. And for those who watched the show:
hostess Cat Deeley is actually nicer and
funnier than she seems, judge Mary Mur
phy is just as crazy and creator/judge Nigel
is smarter hut just as smarmy. And in re
sponse to rumors, Benji emphasizes that he
is not gay.
So. bottom line, my internship turned out
to be a great experience. 1 learned a lot about
the workings of a newsroom — and I learned
that Fd rather pursue pop culture or enter
tainment journalism than serious newspaper
work. I learned about the workings of office
politics and drama (seriously. MySpace wars
among reporters in their 20s"), and 1 feel
much more connected to Redlands than 1
ever have before.
Two years ago, at Redlands' annual
Fourth of July fair, they were selling t-shirts
that showed the old city seal with the cross
and which proudly proclaimed, "Redlands:
MY hometown." Subtext: and those liberal
bastards at the ACLU aren't going to take it
away from me. Well, that's still Redlands. but
after the knowledge gained during my in
ternship. I'm more a part of it.
Next summer. 1 hope to find an internship
that's a little more high-powered, but I'm
proud of all the heat wave and supermarket
stories 1 wrote. Did my internship prepare
me for real life after the Stanford bubble?
Ask me again once I graduate.
