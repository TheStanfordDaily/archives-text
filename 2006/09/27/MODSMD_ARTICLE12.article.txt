Facebook privacy policies remain un
changed
Kai Stinchcombe's assertion in Monday's
Daily ("Facebook privacy," September 25)
that he was removing stuff from his Face
book profile because "there are some things
I'm comfortable sharing with college stu
dents that I don't necessarily want to share
with the entire public" misses a key point
about Facebook expanding its registration
to allow more people to join: Expanding reg
istration hasn't changed the basic visibility
and privacy rules on Facebook.
The only people who will be able to see
Stinchcombe's profile — or anyone else s
profile on Facebook — are his friends and

people in his networks, which for most col
lege users means just their school. The only
way any new people will be able to see
Stinchcombe's profile is if he adds them as a
friend or if they join one of his networks. The
rules for joining work and college networks
haven't changed at all; the only people who
can see you through these networks are peo
ple who have a school or work email address
(i.e., the same people who could see you be
fore). Regional networks are more open
now, but you can restrict who can see your
profile in those networks without affecting
who can see you at your school.
Facebook has always had privacy as one of
its top priorities. Our default privacy rules are
alreadv stricter than most other Web sites —

the average Facebook user can see and be seen
by 0.1-0.2 percent of all users, as compared
with close to 100 percent of users on other
sites. And beyond that, we provide the most ro
bust set of privacy tools of any peer Web site.
We have just added new privacy options that
allow users to essentially make themselves in
visible to new users who sign up outside of col
lege. Users continue to have incredibly granu
lar control over who can see the information
they choose to share on Facebook.
All Facebook users should review their
privacy settings so they know exactly who
can see all the stuff they post on the site.
