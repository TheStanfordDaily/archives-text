Talk of a Hawaiian February
conies early each year. We're
barely three weeks into the
new NFL season, and fans are al
ready picking potential starters for
the Pro Bowl. Personally, 1 think I'll
wait a little longer before I start
dreaming of Andy Reid tanning on
the beach in a Hawaiian shirt. In
stead. I think it's about time to start
picking starters for the "Pro Bono"
Bowl — a game featuring all the
NFL players that leave you wonder
ing why they are even paid. Without
further ado, here are the starters for
the "Pro Bono" Bowl, set in sunny
Barrow, Alaska:
Quarterback:
NFC: Chris Simms (IB) — One
year after leading his Bucs to the
NFC South Division title. Simms
has managed a Jeff Hostetler-like
46.3 QB passer rating. The latest
news from Tampa: Simms' spleen
was removed after Sunday's loss to
the Panthers. Word is, despite
spending a night in the ICU, he
could be back on the field by the end
of the season. But look out Chris,
new rookie starter Bruce Grad
kowski has his eye on your spot in
the Pro Bono Bowl.
AFC: Kerry Collins (TEN) — It's
hard to believe that Collins was at
one point a Super Bowl quarter
back. In Week Two against the
Chargers, Collins arguably played
one of the worst games in NFL his
tory. managing a QB rating of 1.3.
It's a sad day in Tennessee when
your quarterback's rating is lower
than the ratings for "Flavor of
Love."
Running Back:
NFC: Ahman Green (GB) — Ben
Franklin's timeless quote has now
officially been changed to "In this
world, nothing is certain hut death,
taxes and Ahman Green fumbling
the football at least once each Sun
day."
AFC: Wali Lundy (HOC) — Wait,
who?
Wide Receiver:
NFC: Redskins Receivers (WSH)
— A 1 Saunders, I hope your play
book is laminated. With Brandon
Lloyd, David Patten. Chris Cooley
and James Thrash combining for a
total of 12 catches in the first three
games — and Santana Moss and
Antwaan Randle-EI still yet to have

a 100 yard receiving day — the Red
skins receivers should be packing
their 700 page playbooks for Alas
ka.
AFC: Chris Chambers (MIA) —
After the Dolphins acquired
Daunte Culpepper during the off
season. Chambers immediately
moved up on fantasy football draft
boards across the country. In three
games this season, however, the
Dolphins have yet to score more
than 17 points, with Chambers aver
aging a paltry 51 yards a game.
Someone's been putting something
funny in the Gatorade down in
Miami. I low else do you explain the
Chambers/Culpepper debacle, Shaq
being anointed the new Aristotle,
and Heat Coach Pat Riley attempt
ing to dance like Young Jeezy at
their championship parade?
Defense:
NFC: Green Bay — In three games
against the offensively challenged
Lions, Saints and Bears, the Pack
has managed to give up an average
of 28 points per game. And you can't
expect the Packers' offense to keep
putting up points the way they have
in the last two weeks — I heard
there is a new Old Country Buffet in
Green Bay now with a senior citi
zens discount on game nights. Looks
like Brett Favre is done for the sea
son.
AFC (TIE): Houston Texans
Last week. Mark Brunell set an NFL
record, completing 22 passes in a
row against the Texans. Anytime
you allow a washed-up. neck-less
36-year-old quarterback to set an
NFL record, you deserve "Pro
Bono" Bowl honors.
Osiklund Raiders—lt seems when
Randy Moss came over to the
Raiders from the Vikings, he not
only brought his lightning speed and
sure hands but also copious
amounts of marijuana to share with
his teammates. This is the only pos
sible explanation for the newfound
sluggishness of Oakland's team de
fense. allowing more than 27 points
in each of their first two games.
That rounds up this year's early
favorites to make it to Alaska. Be
sure to check in frequently through
out the season, as other players try
their best to drop their passes, miss
their reads, and fumble their kick
offs to "Pro Bono" Bowl glory.
