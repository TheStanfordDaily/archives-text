# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Richards eager to lead Card back to the top Senior All-American comes from family rich in volleyball tradition 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
Three years ago, a young Utah native with vol
leyball in her blood made the most difficult deci
sion of her lite: to leave her home for a strange
new world in hopes of expanding her horizons.
Entering her senior year in 2006, Stanford out
side hitter Kristin Richards can now look back on
her decision to attend Stanford and smile in satis
faction.
"1 think I've matured so much just by being at
Stanford." the three-time AVCA All-American
said. "The atmosphere is so unique. The knowl
edge and the resources I'm surrounded with are
rare, and being exposed to all those things has
made me appreciate the different aspects, views
and opinions of life."
Richards led the Cardinal in kills last season
with 544 in 32 starts, ranking her third in the Pa
cific-IO Conference and 19th in the nation. She
was named to the All Pac-10 112 irst Team each of
her three seasons on The Farm in addition to
claiming the National and Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year awards in 2003.
Given her unique family history.it was only in
evitable that Richards would become the domi
nant player she is today.
Her father. Dave, played volleyball for both

Brigham Young I Jniversity and the I '.S. National
Team, while her mother. I.ori. played for BYU
and coached for a junior college. Kristin's sister,
Lauren, also played at MYD and currentls coach
es at American (Jniversity.
Both Kristin and her sister grew up around the
sport, often working out in the gym at a.m. on a
daily basis. Though their parents provided
tremendous support,she never felt pressured into
volleyball — both Dave and I.ori also encour
aged her to participate in other activities, includ
ing basketball, soccer and piano.
Since joining the Cardinal, Richards luis expe
rienced her share of both joy and heartbreak on
the court.
I ler sophomore season provided for one of the
most exciting years in Stanford volleyball history.
After sweeping the Cardinal out of Seattle earli
er in the 2004 season. No. I Washington ventured
down to Burnham Pavilion and with a 2-0
match lead — appeared to have the Cardinal on
the ropes.
But Stanford rebounded and took the follow
ing three games from the Huskies to post a
thrilling comeback that had even Stanford's radio
broadcaster storming the court.
"Beating an undefeated Washington was one
of my best memories." Richards said. "After com
ing back from being down 0-2, it was the most
thrilling game I've ever been a part of."
I.ater that season, Stanford defeated Minneso
ta, 3-1. in the NCAA Tournament final to clinch
the national title. It was then that Richards got to
experience the sweet taste of success — including
the opportunity to meet President Bush and tour

Washington, D.C. with her team.
Following the championship season, Richards
faced perhaps her biggest challenge with the C ar
dinal. I lalfway through the 2005 season.freshman
standout outside hitter and good friend Cynthia
Barboza tore her ACL. forcing Richards and the
rest of the team to shelter their emotions and step
up during the latter p;irt of the season. Another
injury arose, as setter Bryn Kehoe injured her
hand and missed the final lOganies of the regular
season.
The season would end in an appropriately
frustrating manner for Richards and the ('ardi
nal. who dropped a 3-1 decision to Santa (Mara in
the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
"My toughest memory is definitely losing to
Santa ( lara last season." Richards said." I hey are
a really great team, but it's always hard losing that
early in the tournament."
Richards and the Cardinal obtained some clo
sure by defeating the Broncos, 3-0. in the 2006
preseason.but the victory could not eliminate the
disappointment of their early tourney departure
in 2005.
But things look positive for Stanford this sea
son. Richards said she is most looking forward to
the limitless potential of her teammates and that
the squad's top goal is still to win the Pac-10 and
even another national title. At the same time, she
is also not eager to leave a new home she has
grown to love so much.
"I have mixed feelings about my senior year."
Richards said. "I'm so blessed to have been able
to receive great coaching and be a part of such an
unbelievable experience."
