# Daniel's POWER
## 
### 
Unlike other polls, this one ranks the teams purely on talent, not
where they will end up January 5. Looking at the schedules. I like
USC and Auburn to reach the national title game, with Louisville
waiting in the wings.
1 Auburn No big names, just stellar line
play.
2. Ohio State Two returning defensive starters?
No problem.
3. Florida Mosf future NFLers of any
school...
4. USC ...Except for the Trojans, of
course.
5. Vlichigan R us h D,s to P s ,n country...
6. fpXCIS ...And the Horns' ranks second

7. LSU Top 10 on talent but outside the
Top 20 on schedule.
8. Virginia Tech Will someone from the ACC
please stand up?
9. Tennessee If only they had a quarterback.
10. Oregon Mosf likely Pac-10 team to top
ple use.
11. Notre Dame Most overrated team in the
country.
12. Oklahoma Got jobbed at Oregon two

13. California Could this be first Rose Bowl year

14. Georgia Still undefeated, barely.
15. Louisville J on talent, Top 5 because of
weak schedule.

17. Florida St. Mosf underperforming offense
in the nation.
18. W. Virqinia Best running game you've never

this weekend against UCLA if they have any shot of cracking Daniel's Power 25.
