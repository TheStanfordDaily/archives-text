# Daniel's POWER

Unlike other polls, this one ranks the teams purely on talent, not
where they will end up January 5. Looking at the schedules. I like
USC and Auburn to reach the national title game, with Louisville
waiting in the wings.
1 Auburn No big names, just stellar line
play.
2. Ohio State Two returning defensive starters?
No problem.
3. Florida Mosf future NFLers of any
school...
4. USC ...Except for the Trojans, of
course.
5. Vlichigan R us h D,s to P s ,n country...
6. fpXCIS ...And the Horns' ranks second
