## Facebook opens to all Web users Students at Stanford and beyond tear for privacy, but Facebook says current controls let users protect profiles

You can reject IHUM girl's friendship request. But Mom?
Facebook developers took the online networking site
"global" early yesterday morning, allowing anyone with an
email address to join up in a move that met with expected crit
icism from students on The Farm and beyond.
"The cool thing about Facebook in the beginning was that
it was only for college students," said sophomore Alison Teo.
"The point was that it was exclusive."
Stanford was one of the first schools allowed access to
Facebook back in February 2004.The site slowly added more
colleges— in September 2004, there were just 100 schools
online and 250.000 members — before exploding across the
country. Today, students at nearly every college and universi
ty in the country have access to the site, as well as thousands
of high school students and a few white-collar workers, and
Facebook boasts 9.5 million users and is the seventh-most
trafficked site on the Internet.
But until yesterday, you still needed a .edu email address or
an invite from a college student. Now that Facebook has
thrown open its doors to the rest of the country, students are
left wondering what to make of the networking site that once
seemed to offer an exclusivity that MySpace and Friendster
lacked.
"Facebook was supposed to be a college-based social net-

working site,
now it's the same
as anv other," said

sophomore Kazu Hayashida, adding that he saw no differ-

ence now between MySpace and Facebook.
Senior Jeremy Hoffman said he was ini
tially attracted to Facebook because it
seemed like a safe haven on the Web.

"1 thought it was really cool that you
needed a stanford.edu email address to even view the site,
making sure that college students had their own place on the
Internet away from prying parents and random cyberstalk
ers," he said.
For their part, Facebook officials have tried to assuage pri
vacy concerns. During an online news conference for college
journalists Sept. 14, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes de
fended the expansion.
"No one will be able to see your information unless you
say you want them to be able to," he said. "The idea is that you
have complete control."
Students around the country have moved to create groups
in opposition to the change, some attracting tens of thousands
of members. They range from the frightened — "We don't
want parents or 40 year old stalkers on Facebook" — to the
threatening — "If Facebook Opens to All Internet Users, I
Am Out" and "If Facebook is Letting Non-College Going
Posers in. I'm joining MySpace!"

Not all users expressed opposition to the expansion. Lew
Jan Olewski. a 2006 Rockhurst University alumnus, started a
group in favor of the expansion.
"Opening Facebook up will not compromise online inti
macy' so long as the user-adjustable privacy controls remain
intact." Olewski said."lt will,however,expand access to many
individuals who are currently shut out of the network, but who
would otherwise fit right in," like childhood friends who did
not pursue higher education or friends at foreign universities.
Still students have offered conspiracy theories. Nic Lake, a
University of Northern lowa sophomore, created a group op
posed to the opening of Facebook that has attracted more
than 35,000 members. He theorized that Facebook co
founder Mark Zuckerberg is making these changes to in
crease the sites traffic and thus its net worth. According to re-


k JOSEPH BERGEN/
cent reports from The Wall Street
Journal, the company has been in
talks with Microsoft, Viacom and
Yahoo about the possible sale of the
site for as much as $1 billion.
-A lot of these money-making
schemes, though, are eating away at
the integrity of the site," Lake said,
adding that the move to increase
membership rolls could backfire. "1
rarely visit the site anymore, and I
have a feeling that a lot of college and

high school students feel the same
way and will be doing the same
thing."
And what about Mom and Dad?
Some students whose parents are
college faculty have already grap
pled with the eternal question: "to
friend or not to friend?" Sopho
more Meg Lunde said she would hit
the "reject" button if her parents
"triended" her.
I here are incriminating photo
graphs that I don't want them to
see," she said.
Others were less sure.
"1 like my parents," said sopho
more Victor Cruz. "Plus, they pay
mv tuition."
