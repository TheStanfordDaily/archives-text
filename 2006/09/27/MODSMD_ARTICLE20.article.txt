I'm sad to see this as I prepare to
return to the Farm for Reunion. We
can cover the entire world with
caution tape and people will still
hurt themselves. A campaign fo
cused on teaching people how to
properly ride their bikes and look
out for others would help the situa
tion not only in the Quad, but any
where else in the world a Stanford
graduate may happen to ride a
bike. Universities should teach
through education, not through
prohibition.

As an avid walker on campus, I
am happy to see this new rule being
implemented. People can still ride
bikes to class and park them out
side of the arcade, and then walk
easily to the classroom instead of
having to meander a maze of hap
hazardly parked bicycles. I wish
there were more (enforced) regu
lations about parking bicycles out
side of building entrances. How
hard is it to walk the extra 15 feet
to/from the bike racks?

I completely agree with this new
policy. I am appalled that someone
suggested that this small safety
measure takes away from "Califor
nia charm." What are on earth are
you talking rbout? We can still ride
our bikes to class. 1 don't know how
walking our bikes on walkways
makes us less charming. Please, re
think that comment. I, for one. be
lieve in rules, especially when it
comes to safety. I do not agree with
'% Alumnus that rules here don't
help. Just think about the immedi
ate situation and realize that ban
ning bike riding on pedestrian
walkways will minimize injury and
danger for all. ITie point of that
should be clear, and Stanford stu
dents are bright enough to take
that idea away with them wherever
they go. Am 1 being overly opti
mistic?

This is exactly the type of over
bearing parenting that 1 came to
expect from Stanford while I was
there between 2000 and 2004.
What ever happened to personal
responsibility? If people choose to
ride without helmets or ride while
physically inept, then they should
accept their own fate. It's not any
one else's fault, and it certainly
doesn't require a new policy each
time someone falls and hurts
themselves. This constant micro
managing of students' lives was
becoming ridiculous while 1 was
there, and it seems to have come of
age for students too young to re

member when Stanford "allowed"
some degree of personal freedom
and responsibility.The administra
tive heads need to stop turning
people's college years into some
sort of experiment in social engi
neering.

If the University really wanted
to reduce the number of student
hospitalizations, they would have
enforced the no-drinking rule in
all-freshman dorms. 1 bet this came
about through the whining of some
big shot with lots of money.

This is unbelievable.There is no
way this policy is meant to do any
thing except tlex power needlessly.
All this will do is increase conges
tion on the lanes around the Quad,
which is where accidents actually
happen. Some of my favorite mem
ories of Stanford are biking to and
from class or riding across the
Quad after turning in that last
paper before break. The fact is,
Stanford is primarily a biking cam
pus, and this will only create more
frustration and inconvenience with
minimal benefit.
