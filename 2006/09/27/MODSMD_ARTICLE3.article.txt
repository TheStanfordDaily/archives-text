## Eyesore no more, youth center opens Boarded up for three years, building reborn as School of Education hub 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
Bikers careening through the center of campus may
not be able to park their bikes in th arcades around the
Quad, but they no longer have to avert their eyes from
the boarded-up-house at the "Intersection of Death."
The eyesore has been renovated,and the site is now the
new home of the School of Education's Gardner Cen
ter for Youth and Iheir Communities.
"It's exciting for the School of Education to have a
new space that is centrally located and makes very vis
ible the work we're doing," said Dean Deborah Stipek
of the new Barnum Family Center for School and
Community Partnerships.
ITie Gardner Center helps to research and develop
youth leadership programs for local communities like
Redwood City and West Oakland. Founded in 2(MX). it
is an effort by the School of Education to reach out to
nearby communities and help establish healthy, dy
namic environments for young people.
The $5.6 million Barnum building project, which
lasted from October 2005 through this month, trans
formed what used to be the old Campus Bookstore
and Sticky Wilson's Candy Store into two conference
halls, office space, a lobby and two courtyards, accord
ing to project manager Susan Rozakis.
The original building closed after severe damage
from an electrical fire three years ago. and students
complained that the boarded-up structure was a waste
of prime campus real estate.
Movers hauled furniture through the sunny court

yards of the Barnum Center last week, and School of
Education personnel started moving in on Monday.
Hayin Kim. a research assistant at the Gardner Center,
said all of the center's doctoral students are excited to
move to a new location, though most have only seen
the outside.
Kim spends 25 hours per week working on the
Academy for Community Schools Development proj
ect. a four-year-old collaboration between the Gardner
Center, the Redwood City School District, and the
Cunha Unified School District. Flie Gardner Center
provides K-8 schools in San Mateo with tools, models
and research data intended to help implement commu
nity youth development programs.
Kim. who spends a lot of time meeting with staff,
community partners and research teams, hopes the

new building will provide a better meeting space. For
the last six years, the Gardner Center has been
crammed onto the fourth floor of the Center for Edu
cational Research at Stanford (CERAS), with no free
office or conference space.
"[Space] has been tight from the beginning," Stipek
said. With recent growth of the Gardner and other pro
grams," she said." this past year was a good time to ex
pand."
Fortunately, the Birnums stepped in. Bill (AB '76,
MBA '81. JD '81) and Donnalisa Barnum (AB '81),
longtime Stanford donors, funded a large part of the
renovation with a $3 million donation.
The Barnum Center is the first major addition to
the School of Education since the construction of
CERAS roughly twenty years ago. Stipek said.


The new Barnum Family Center for School and Community Partnerships will house the Gardner Center, which
aims to work with adolescents in neighboring, low-income cities. The building had been empty for three years.
