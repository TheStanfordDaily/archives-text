Stanford faculty have had a hand
in licensing the popular search en
gine Google, the high-speed internet
technology DSL, the MRI machine
and recombinant DNA technology.
This is an impressive string of tech
nological innovations that has gar
nered the University more than just
prestige. The Milken Institute, a
Santa Monica think tank, recently
ranked Stanford as the fourth most
entrepreneurial university in the
country for "technology transfer and
commercialization" â€” the art of
turning innovative research into rev
enue.
Hie study measured universities
in regard to patents issued, licenses
executed, licensing income and start
ups.
"ITie university's reputation for
producing high-quality research is
indicative of its top-notch faculty and
scientists and ultimately the driver of
its academic entrepreneurial suc
cess," said Armen Bedroussian, co
author of the study.
