## Patents rake in dough for Univ. Med School innovation alone nets $10 million in 2004-05 fiscal year

Stanford faculty have had a hand
in licensing the popular search en
gine Google, the high-speed internet
technology DSL, the MRI machine
and recombinant DNA technology.
This is an impressive string of tech
nological innovations that has gar
nered the University more than just
prestige. The Milken Institute, a
Santa Monica think tank, recently
ranked Stanford as the fourth most
entrepreneurial university in the
country for "technology transfer and
commercialization" â€” the art of
turning innovative research into rev
enue.
Hie study measured universities
in regard to patents issued, licenses
executed, licensing income and start
ups.
"ITie university's reputation for
producing high-quality research is
indicative of its top-notch faculty and
scientists and ultimately the driver of
its academic entrepreneurial suc
cess," said Armen Bedroussian, co
author of the study.
The success of Stanford's licensing rests be
tween the inventor and Stanford's Office ol Iccli
nology Licensing (OTL).Together, they decide the
best strategy for marketing a potentially profitable
idea, through finding the best market for the par
ticular product and exploring other options like
patenting.
Roughly one third of the royalties from the in
vention goto the inventor, one third to the depart
ment and one third to the school. In 35 years, OTL
has generated more than one billion dollars of in
come for the University through technology li
censing. In 2004-2005 alone, the School of Medi
cine pocketed more than ten million dollars in roy
alties.
Katharine Ku. Director of the OTL. cited the
departments of genetics and electrical engineering
for their high revenues. They generated the most
money from licensing for the 2006 112 iscal year, with
Functional Antibodies as the biggest income pro
ducing case.
Though patents and licensing have generated
much revenue for the University, students of lead
ing departments say that this doesn't result in (ires
sure for them to innovate.
While Tovi Anderson, a graduate student in ge
netics, spends a considerable amount of her time
researching in lab. she said she does not feel anx
ious to patent.
"Innovative research is always a goal," she said.
"We want our lab/department/university to re-

and technology, but I believe few graduate stu
dents in my department feel pressure specific to
these ends."
"This can. however, depend on your lab's area
of research," she added. "Labs that are involved in
the development of new technologies or drug de
sign may pressure their students much more to ob
tain patents."
John Cioffi, a professor of electrical engineer
ing and the primary creator of DSL technology, ar
gued that many department members innovate
solely for the joy of research rather than to patent.
"Most academic inventors take great pride in
seeing their ideas used, so they may publish and
promote without any intellectual property con-

cerns.
Ku emphasized that the research going into
such projects was not at the expense of undergrad
uate education.
"The University has always emphasized both
teaching and research." she said.
And as Bedroussian pointed out. undergradu
ates have a lot to gain from participation in an in
novative department.
"To some extent, there may be knowledge
spillover that takes place due to the University's
academic entrepreneurial culture," he said. "Ex
posure to this culture may give undergraduate stu
dents at major research universities an edge in
conducting research at a later stage in their ca
reer."
