## Hum Bio taps new director Bio professor Carol Boggs is first female head, plans to broaden program offerings 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
The Program in Human Biology welcomed Carol Boggs.
Biology Professor, as its first female director this tall.
A prolific researcher in the field of evolutionary ecology,
Boggs brings more than just academic expertise to her posi
tion. Having taught at Stanford since 1979, 19 years for the
Humßio Program, Boggs has instructed undergraduates on
subjects ranging from evolution to health policy, and she has
supervised over 50 independent research projects by under
graduates.
"The undergraduates at Stanford are truly remarkable,"
Boggs said. "Among the most enjoyable aspects of being at
Stanford are the one-on-one interac
tions with students. [Their] enthusi
asm and curiosity are highly conta
gious."
Her experience in working with
undergraduates is particularly rele
vant, she said, because 1 lumßio is an
exclusively undergraduate major. As
opposed to stand-alone departments,
which typically provide degree
granting programs for undergradu
ate and graduate students, Humßio
is an interschool, interdepartmental
program.

Its unique slant has helped make
it one of the most popular under
graduate majors at Stanford, Boggs
said. The interdisciplinary focus of
1 lunißio is refreshing for the instruc
tors as well.
"Once you leave the undergradu
ate world, your academic focus often
narrows" she explained. "Interdisci
plinary teaching has all the excite
ment of learning new things and inte
grating [them] with your current
knowledge, without the pain of hav
ing to take final exams again."
Boggs will serve a three-year
term, during which she hopes to
broaden the range of courses and re
search opportunities available to
upper-level Humßio students, espe
cially within concentration areas.

She's also considering minor changes
to the core courses in the major.
"These changes would not alter
the philosophy of the core in any way.
but would more effectively organize
the material and may expand the di
versity of social science represent;)
tion," she said.
Boggs added that she also hopes
to draw on her research experience.
"One of the first lessons from re
search is that you can have the best
idea in the world, but that doesn't
mean that things will work out exact
ly the way you thought,"she said."So
you re-group, figure out what hap
pened or what alternative you over
looked and go for it again. I'm look
ing forward to the learning process as
well as the successes."
