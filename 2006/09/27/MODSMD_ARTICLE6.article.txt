## City Council approves construction at Stanford Research Park 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council approved plans Monday
night for SAP Labs to build a 76,500 square foot research
and development building on Hillview Ave. in the Stanford
Research Park.
The expansion of the German software company, which
recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary in Palo Alto, is
expected to contribute an extra $23,000 annually in prop
erty tax revenue to the city's coffers.
The project passed by a 6-0 vote as council members
praised the construction project for being eco-friendly; the
company will preserve and plant native trees, reduce the
amount of asphalt needed for
parking structures and shade the
buildings.
"The new generation of build
ings we're seeing in the Stanford
Research Park is promising," Vice
Mayor Yoriko Kishimoto told the
Palo Alto Weekly. "It's a direction
Palo Alto can be proud of."
