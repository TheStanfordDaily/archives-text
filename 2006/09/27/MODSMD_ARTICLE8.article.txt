## Editorial Board Seven qualities of highly effective Daily columnists 
### 
Yesterday we described the inner
workings of The Daily's Editorial
Board. Today we would like to ex
plain what exactly we're looking for in an
opinions columnist.
Originality.
This does not mean that you cannot write
a column about dating or Facebook. What it
does mean is that if you do choose to write
on these topics, you better have something
new to say. We already know that everybody
hates the newsfeed and that dating at Stan
ford sucks. PS Avoid cliches.
Personality.
Please have one. Cynical or peppy. Cute
or sassy. Regardless, the reader needs to
know who you are and what you are all
about. Make sure that we become acquaint
ed with your unique personality through
your application â€” if we can't figure out
who you are. how will the rest of the readers?
Semblance and Style.
We like random ramblings just as much as
the next reader. But. nobody wants to wit
ness a haphazard mess of thoughts. If you
can pull off Faulkner or Woolf, by all means,
try out the stream-of-consciousness. If not,
then please spare us the headache.
Pizzazz.
When that groggy kid in sweatpants eat
ing Cheerios in Lag dining sets eyes on your
column, we want him or her to be dazzled. It
doesn't matter if your column is funny or se
rious, lengthy or succinct. Just make sure it's
interesting. Try to use personal anecdotes or
specific, sensory details. Don't rely on ab

stractions.
Avoid overkill, in all senses of the term.
If you've written b(K) words and you're
out of things to say. don't squeeze out anoth
er several hundred just to fill up space. It will
detract from the quality of your writing and
bore your readers. But if you write lengthy
columns with ease.be our guest.
Use sarcasm with caution.
To be snarky is one thing.To be offensive
is another. Make sure your tone is clearly
communicated to the reader and not just ap
parent to you. Otherwise, expect hundreds
of angry e-mails and two unhappy editors.
Reliability.
You will be writing one column every
week for the rest of this volume (so basically
until the middle of winter quarter). It doesn't
matter if you have a big paper or a midterm
some week, Through rain, sleet or snow, the
column must go on. If you can't commit,
don't apply. You will be expected to come in
after you write your column to edit with us.
As long as you get your column in on time,
the process is relatively quick and painless. It
not?
Have we scared you off yet? Hopefully
not. A column is a great opportunity to have
your voice heard and word on the street is,
we aren't actually as mean as we sound. We
just want the best.

Vicky Degtyareva and Natalie Jabbar will be at
the Daily office this Friday night reading your
applications. Please dazzle them. They can be
reached at njabbar@stanford.edu or
