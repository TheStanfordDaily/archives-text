## Voting: An Early Reminder 
### 
Are Stanford students lazy? The idea
might seem counterintuitive. Come
on. a typical response would argue,
we didn't get into Stanford because we're
lazy. It was too competitive; we worked hard
in high school, did lots of activities and so on
and so forth. Ask an average person on cam
pus about their average day. If anything, stu
dents try to do too much.
But remember that among these same
over-committed, high-achieving students
are the ones who don't bother to separate re
cycling or even throw away their own trash,
leave trays of food in the hall for weeks and
choose to block a sidewalk rather than put a
bike in an actual rack. And most of them
don't vote.
One could protest that these are unfair
comparisons. I may not vote, but 1 definitely
recycle, and I would never make someone
else clean up my mess.
Guess again, because that is exactly what
happens. Although it may sound elitist, the
country would be better off if more college
students, especially those from Stanford,
participated in their own government. When
some of the best informed and most highly
educated don't bother to be involved, igno
rance dominates and others are left to clean
up. A leading polling company, Harris Inter
active, conducted a poll this June in which 25
percent of the participants believed that
weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) had
actually been found in Iraq. This has not
been an under the radar news issue.
The excuse most often heard is that vot
ing is too much trouble. "I meant to do it" is
a common chorus after the election. The
same busy schedules we're so proud of make
civic participation difficult. But when it
comes down to it.the time it takes to regis
ter, consider the issues and vote is much less
than most students spend surfing Facebook
or watching TV in a single week. It really
isn't that hard.
Stanford is a vibrant place when it comes
to politics, so it isn't hard to pay attention.
We have student activists and visiting high
profile speakers, not to mention professors
who consistently make the news. It would
be unfair not to point out that many stu
dents do vote, and though there is no offi
cial tally, we probably have a higher partic
ipation rate than other colleges. But its still
not enough.
Confronted with this logic, apathy is usu
ally the next defense. Phrases like I m a
techie," or "I'm just not into politics." are

used to rationalize why voting is not impor
tant to some people. This is still laziness.
Techies pay taxes too, and not being "into
politics" doesn't mean you are no longer in
cluded in the democracy. It just means you
let other people decide things for you which
as shown by the WMD example is a very
dicey prospect.
Even worse is the belief that voting itself
doesn't matter because of the small impact
of one person. Caitlin Smith, a sophomore
active in Stanford in Government (SIG) and
the Student Democrats, worked to register
voters last year. She says a typical response
of students she approached was that voting
doesn't matter because one vote never de
cided an election. This justification is preva
lent even among those who are politically
active. "There are people who read the arti
cles and would work on a campaign but
don't vote themselves," Smith said.
Debate and discussion are great, but po
litical discourse cannot be anything but a
means of hearing your own voice unless you
are willing to take the next step and actually
vote.
Regardless of one's interest level, leaving
it up to other people is the equivalent of ex
pecting someone else to clean up your mess.
You also owe it to yourself. Though you
might not think about taxes because most
college students don't have much of a tax
able income, you still pay them. California
collects 8.25 percent of every dollar you
spend here and you only get it back through
government services.
A friend of mine is visiting the U.S. for a
year and despite a keen interest in American
politics, he can't vote. But he's carefully sav
ing all of his receipts and plans to collect a
tax refund when he departs that could be
near $5,000. The rest of us are unable to do
that; these taxes are literally the cost of citi
zenship. You may have little interest in poli
tics. You may be a techie. Or you may think
all politicians are dirt bags, that one vote
doesn't count or that filling out a registration
form and going to a voting station is just too
strenuous. But whatever your excuse, do it
for the money. Do it because you aren't get
ting that $5,000 back, and it's worth trying to
protect your investment.
Oh, and please take care of your own stu
pid trays.
