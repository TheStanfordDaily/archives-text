# Stanford is Lame
## 
### 
About a year ago I wrote an article
lamenting the cancerous growths of a
cappella sign-up tables and the chalk
scribbling that decorate campus at the start
of each year.
Now, because this phenomenon is starting
again. 1 had initially planned to just cut and
paste from my earlier work — originality
should only be a sin of the young. Apparent
ly, however, copying is not what 1 fail to get
paid for, and the folks at the Daily want
something different.
(Before I get to the new material, I should
point out that the a cappella cult recruitment
is not alone on White Plaza — other fringe
religious organizations also try to pick up
drones to be brainwashed while they're still
young, innocent and sober.)
Anyway,on to business. Well, not so much
business as an extended ramble. A ramble of
frequent and subtle changes in direction. A
ramble of 600-8(K) words. And. above all else,
a ramble of lameness.
It's difficult not to feel overly American
(this is not, by the way, a good tiling) whilst
using such highpoints of the English lan
guage as "lame" and "lameness". However,
circumstances and the dreadful linguistic
temperament of my readership force me to
descend to the verbal level of the New World
vernacular.
Also, nothing really says "lame" quite like
"lame."
'ITiat Leland and Jane's masterpiece fails
somewhat in the "cool" department would,
presumably, come as no shock to any non
resident of the Farm. After all. a reputation
for churning out bright-eyed engineers does
not exactly have the allure of. say, anything
else.

But I digress. Actually what's bothering
me now is our football team. Perhaps that's
unfair. I'm sort of pleased with the football
— we might lose every game, which, while a
bit rubbish, is at least a stand out sort of fail
ure. No, it's not the team, so much as the sta
dium that's bothering me.
Our glorious new edifice is allegedly the
jewel in the Pac-10. All shiny and new. Like a
shiny, new thing. And. if 1 were reasonable, I
would probably say something complimen
tary about the shiny newness. Luckily, I don't
really believe in reason.
The stadium opened last week with jets,
parachutists and a glorious loss that will go
down in the annals of Stanford footballing
history as a truly great game. Which is good,
because judging by the halftime show, we're
a little desperate for some history.
Most schools would take the opportunity
of a stadium opening to reflect on the glory
days. On past successes and future dreams.
On, in fact, anything at all. Here at Stanford,
though, things are done a little differently.
We have halftime tributes to construction.
Now. don't get me wrong, construction is
great. Fabulous. Love it. It's just that where
else but our noble institution would such
pride be shown in an ability to complete a
building project on time.

Yes, yes, I know. There were only c. 280
days to do the work. The American worker
deserves our gratitude. But a video tribute?
Complete with time-lapse photography? It
seems a bit, well, lame.
Sure, the grass-laying pictures were a little
funny. And the demolition thing was nifty.
But guys, it's just building a stadium. Its not
like we actually achieved anything.
I'm sure that if the NCAA had efficient
building competitions we would sweep the
championship. While our sporting teams
may crumble in the face of opposition, our
ability to plan and execute short contracts is
without equal. We rock.
rhere is a tendency at Stanford to believe
that numbers are everything. We take pride
in failure, by pointing out that at least we do
so only 87.3 percent of the time, and also our
(iPAs are, like.million (or something like
that).
ITie favored defense of the Farm by one
ol its denizens will inevitably involve some
pointless statistic about how we only lost be
cause we have some number higher (or
lower) than everyone else. That's great and
everything, but it does come across as, well,
desperate whining.
l inishing on a positive note: I like that
Stanford's lame. It brings a smile to my face
when I hear the pathetic attempts to get a
cheer going at a game. My lips stretch into a
bright grin when I see your frequent at
tempts at style. And above all else, I really do
feel a sense ol pride when I contemplate how
fast we manage to erect things.

Leave me alone. I'm really busy. If you want
something, e-mail mv personal assistant at
