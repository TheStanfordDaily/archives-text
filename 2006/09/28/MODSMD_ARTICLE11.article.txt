Branner staff clears
up misconceptions
As the resident staff of Branner Hall,
we'd like to counter the perception ex
pressed in the Daily ("Frosh find holes in
dry week policy," Sept 25) that there was an
alcohol-fueled party here every night of
NSC). While we had to break up some exces
sive activity in the halls on Friday and Satur
day nights, our residents not only cooperat
ed. but actually helped the staff remove the
numerous non-Branner residents that were

causing problems in the dorm. We can hon
estly say that the majority of our residents
had an alcohol-free NSO and that we expe
rienced far fewer alcohol-related problems
than in past years (and no serious incidents
at all). This is a testament to the maturity
and good sense of everybody living in Bran
ner, and we want to thank and honor them
for it.
It is unfortunate that an article read by
students all across campus, many of them
forming their first impressions of Branner
Hall, presented an exaggeration of the facts.

There was little firsthand information in the
article, and the quotes that were in the article
were not accurate, and in one case, blatantly
misleading.
Branner is a wonderful residence where
we love to have fun, hut where we also re
spect the rights of all our residents. We value
Branner s right to have an upstanding repu
tation among the Stanford community, and
we will continue to work throughout the year
to see that Branner deserves this right.
