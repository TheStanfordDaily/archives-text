one of the most competitive, as No. 6 Stanford women's volleyball is one of five Pac
-10 teams ranked in the national Top 25.

That would be an impressive feat in itself, but the Pac-10 does not settle for mere
excellence. All five of the conference's ranked teams are in the top seven. Nebraska
holds the top spot with Penn State ranked second ahead of the five West Coast teams.
UCLA. Washington. Southern California, Stanford and California are third through
seventh, respectively.

"Overall, [the Pac-10] is ten
great teams from top to bot

swept Washington State before
falling in three hard-fought

the loss and sophomore libero
Jessica Fishburn had a career

cannot afford to take anything for granted in the stacked Pac-10.
The Wildcats were highly ranked last year, but graduation and injuries have
knocked them out of the conference's upper echelon. For the first time in seven years,
Arizona lost to in-state rival ASU at home.
