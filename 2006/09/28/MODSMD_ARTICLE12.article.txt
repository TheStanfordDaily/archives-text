Sixth-ranked Cardinal host struggling Cats,
surging Devils in conference home opener

Only a week into the Pac-1() Conference season, 2(X)6 is already shaping up to be
one of the most competitive, as No. 6 Stanford women's volleyball is one of five Pac
-10 teams ranked in the national Top 25.

That would be an impressive feat in itself, but the Pac-10 does not settle for mere
excellence. All five of the conference's ranked teams are in the top seven. Nebraska
holds the top spot with Penn State ranked second ahead of the five West Coast teams.
UCLA. Washington. Southern California, Stanford and California are third through
seventh, respectively.

"Overall, [the Pac-10] is ten
great teams from top to bot
tom," head coach John Dun
ning said. "Each team has im
proved, and that should pro
vide for an exciting season."
Last weekend, the Cardinal
swept Washington State before
falling in three hard-fought
games to the defending cham
pion Huskies. Sophomore Cyn
thia Barboza notched 25 kills in
the loss and sophomore libero
Jessica Fishburn had a career
high 25 digs. Against the
Cougars, sophomore middle
blocker Foluke Akinradewo
hit .500 with seven kills and
recorded a match-high eight
blocks.

matches were nine and three.
"We remember it," Dunning said.
"They were both great matches. It

The star of those upsets was Ari

down 60 kills in the two matches.The

"Arizona State is definitely the

most improved team from last year

Dunning said. " Ihey have some
