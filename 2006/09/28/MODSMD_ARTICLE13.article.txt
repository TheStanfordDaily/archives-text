## Runners seek repeat at Invite 33rd Stanford Invitational brings best of high school and college to the Farm 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Even in a field of 5,000 runners, the
members of the Stanford cross-coun
try teams make their presence felt. At
this weekend's Stanford Invitational,
the top-ranked women and No. 4 men
look to repeat their impressive finishes
at last year's meet.
Stanford won all four team titles
and saw three individual champions.
With nearly every member of the team
back for another year on the Farm, the
Cardinal's chances at a repeat are
looking good.
In its 33rd year, the Stanford Invita
tional brings the top runners from high
schools as far away as New Jersey, but
the real highlight will be the collegiate
races at the end of the day. After 17
high school races, the first NCAA race,
a non-scored women's 5000 meters, is
set to start at 4:15 p.m.
Stanford is the top-ranked team in
both the women's and men's races, but
a pair of strong programs should chal
lenge for the title. On the women's side
No. 11 UC Santa Barbara is the Cardi
nal's top competitor. UCSB senior
Stephanie Rothstein finished fifth at
the Invitational last year, racing unat
tached during a redshirt season. In the
spring, her time in the 10,000 meters at
the Track and Field Stanford Invita
tional broke the school and conference
records.
The strongest contender the Cardi
nal will face in the men's race will like
ly be Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. At the
UCSB Invite earlier this season, the
Mustangs put seven men in the top 10,
with junior Phillip Reid winning the
race.
The 4000 meter women's race is first,
followed by the men at the same distance.
In 2005, the Stanford women kicked off
their championship season with a team
win at that distance. Each of Stanford's
five scoring runners finished in the top 10
and then-junior Amanda Trotter was
atop the podium. All five return this year
and only Trotter is a senior in 2006.
As they did in the shorter race, the
Stanford women dominated in the 6000
meter distance, with then-junior Arianna
Lambie finishing first and the five scor
ers all in the top 12. Once again, all five

are back for another try at a champi
onship.
Last year, the men won the team ti
tles in the 4000 and 8000 meter races
with junior Russell Brown finishing first
in the shorter race. Garrett Heath, a
freshman in 2005, finished third in the
8000, just behind the McDougal broth
ers of Liberty. Like their female team
mates. the 10 scorers in the two races all
returned this year.
Following the Invitational, the Cardi
nal will have a weekend off to prepare
for the pre-NCAA meet in Indiana.
