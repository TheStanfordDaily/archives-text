# Mulling Things Over
## 
### BY CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Daily kicks off the new school year with
a continuation of last year's "Through My Eyes"
series. In this issue. The Daily joins sophomore
Blake Muller, a returning starter on the men's
tennis team, receiving some insight about the up
coming year and the dynamic of this year's
squad.
Muller, a native of Santa Barbara, Calif, and
freshman Richard Wire will be traveling to the
University of Hilsa next week to compete in the
Polo Ralph Lauren All-American Tennis Cham
pionships. Play for the qualifying rounds begins
on Monday.
Now and Then
It's different coming in this year. Coming in as
a freshman, you're unsure — you're not too sure
what to expect. You don't know how good the
players are. But coming in now, 1 expect a little
hit more out of myself, and 1 just want to contin
ue to improve.
This summer. 1 took about two to three weeks
off after NCAAs to let my body heal since the
season is really long. After that. I started practic
ing and working out a lot to try and stay in shape.
1 just wanted to try to improve as much as 1 pos
sibly could over the summer.
Fresh Faces
I've hit with (the three new freshman play
ers]. and they're all good. They love tennis and
have all been out there every day. It's just what
we need since we lost KC [Corkery] and Jon
[Wong].
Richard [Wire] and I are playing [doubles] in
the qualifying [rounds of the Ail-American].
He's a lefty who serves well, hits the ball really
well and has a good forehand, so hopefully we
can do some damage.
Kevin [Kaiser] is from Northern California,
hut 1 never played him in juniors. 1 knew him on
a name basis, but not too much outside of that.
I've hit with Paul [Morrissey] a bit over the last
two days, and he serves well.
All three [of the freshmen] are really tall so
I'm not the tallest guy on the team anymore
[Muller is 6'2"] And the team's a little different
this year because we've got two foreigners. It's
new,especially for Stanford. It's fun trying to fig
ure out what they're trying to say.
Ail-American
Obviously my goal is to get through qualify
ing and to do well in the main draw. These pre
season tournaments are important, but it's more
just getting prepared and getting better every
day. Hopefully this tournament will help me get
back into the swing of things. It's a big tourna
ment, but really what matters are the dual
