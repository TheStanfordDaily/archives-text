# Surprising twist to T.O.saga
## 
### 
It's official: the best part of the
American sports calendar is
upon us. MLB playoffs lie just
around the corner, the NFL is ap
proaching its quarter-season mark
and NCAA football is in full swing.
I'll hold off on discussing baseball
until the playoff scenarios are set in
stone. And, as my gift to you, Stan
ford, I'm going to ignore the whole
collegiate athletics thing. The only
thing I will say is that the Cardinal
should be headed for one heck of a
draft pick, right?
There are finally more important
things to talk about than how far
Terrell Owens could have traveled if
his bike weren't stationary, where
Alfonso Soriano will eventually not
be traded to and how many com
mercials Peyton Manning can shoot
in one offseason. A 1 Davis has
learned that Randy Moss, Jerry
Porter. Aaron Brooks and Art Shell
don't mix: Shaun Alexander learned
that maybe Madden covers aren't
such a good idea after all; and Chris
Simms now knows that the spleen is
a fairly important organ.
But maybe the unifying theme
from the young NFL season is that
nothing stays the same, and the
changes that occur are rarely those
we would expect. Alex Smith, the
first overall pick in the 2005 draft,
has gone from a derided rookie to
the most consistent player on a
resurgent 49ers offense, the Bucca
neers are 0-3 and an apparently
over-the-hill Steve McNair has
turned out to be just what the doctor
ordered in Baltimore. No percep
tion will be changed as quickly, how
ever, as the public's view of TO.
According to AP reports, Owens
was rushed to a Dallas area hospital
TUesday night when his publicist
found him unresponsive near an
empty bottle of painkillers in his
home. Early reports trumpeted that
this was a suicide attempt, but
Owens addressed the media yester
day to deny it.

Owens, his publicist and the emer
gency response personnel who
came to his aid will ever know what
really happened. But since this fits
into the downward spiral that his
career has become, that won't mat
ter. It will simply become another
episode in the prolonged strange
tragedy that has been Owens's NFL
career to date.
His rise to stardom was meteoric
as a young receiver with the 49ers.
It began and ended with one play in
a 1998 playoff game against the
Green Bay Packers. Catching the
winning touchdown pass from
Steve Young in the game's closing
seconds. Owens signaled his arrival
as a football celebrity. Owens was
suddenly the heir apparent to Jerry
Rice's legacy in San Francisco. And
for a time, he even lived up to that
billing.
This was a vastly different
Owens from the one fans love to
hate today. After a strict upbringing,
Owens arrived on a team that still
carried with it many of the trap
pings of its 20-year dynasty. 1 le was
a polite, soft-spoken young athlete
from the South, who called re
porters "sir," broke down crying
after that fateful game in Green
Bay and was humbled to be on the
same team as his longtime idol,
Jerry Rice.
But the dynasty crumbled soon
after the '98 season. A series of con

cussions forced Steve Young into
retirement and Jerry Rice left for
the Silver and Black across the Bay.
()wens, who had always before lived
and played in very structured envi
ronments, quickly became a star in a
leadership vacuum. And we all
know what happened from there.
The Dallas Star incident. The
Sharpie scandal. The screaming at
then 49ers Offensive Coordinator
Greg knapp on the sideline.
Throwing Jeff Garcia under the
proverbial bus, and later question
ing his sexual orientation. The joy
ful meeting with his supposed soul
mate Donovan McNabb in
Philadelphia. The break-up with his
soul mate. The workout on the
lawn. The interviews with his self
described "shark" of an agent.
Drew Rosenhaus, always by his
side. His recent reenactment of the
Tour de France over the summer.
And now, maybe, attempted sui
cide.
The quiet kid from Alabama
who idolized Jerry Rice, Terrell El
dorado Owens, is now on his last
chance to finish out his career with
some dignity, and not leave a city
alienated and disgraced. And now,
the reports say. he's tried to end it
all.
And even though he denies the
reported suicide attempt, that the
whole thing is just one big misun
derstanding, it's enough to make
you wonder if we've been a little too
hard on him over all these years.
