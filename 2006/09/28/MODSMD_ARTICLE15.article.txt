# Surprising twist to T.O.saga
## 
### 
It's official: the best part of the
American sports calendar is
upon us. MLB playoffs lie just
around the corner, the NFL is ap
proaching its quarter-season mark
and NCAA football is in full swing.
I'll hold off on discussing baseball
until the playoff scenarios are set in
stone. And, as my gift to you, Stan
ford, I'm going to ignore the whole
collegiate athletics thing. The only
thing I will say is that the Cardinal
should be headed for one heck of a
draft pick, right?
There are finally more important
things to talk about than how far
Terrell Owens could have traveled if
his bike weren't stationary, where
Alfonso Soriano will eventually not
be traded to and how many com
mercials Peyton Manning can shoot
in one offseason. A 1 Davis has
learned that Randy Moss, Jerry
Porter. Aaron Brooks and Art Shell
don't mix: Shaun Alexander learned
that maybe Madden covers aren't
such a good idea after all; and Chris
Simms now knows that the spleen is
a fairly important organ.
But maybe the unifying theme
from the young NFL season is that
nothing stays the same, and the
changes that occur are rarely those
we would expect. Alex Smith, the
first overall pick in the 2005 draft,
has gone from a derided rookie to
the most consistent player on a
resurgent 49ers offense, the Bucca
neers are 0-3 and an apparently
over-the-hill Steve McNair has
turned out to be just what the doctor
ordered in Baltimore. No percep
tion will be changed as quickly, how
ever, as the public's view of TO.
According to AP reports, Owens
was rushed to a Dallas area hospital
TUesday night when his publicist
found him unresponsive near an
empty bottle of painkillers in his
home. Early reports trumpeted that
this was a suicide attempt, but
Owens addressed the media yester
day to deny it.
It's extremelv likely that onlv
