# SHOOTING FOR AN UPSET
## CARD VISIT PERENNIAL POWERHOUSE BRONCOS 
### BY MANDY KOVACH DESK EDITOR 
Riding on the heels of seven shutouts in
eight games and three straight victories, the
Stanford women's soccer team has momen
tum heading into the conference season. Be
fore facing their first Pac-10 foe, however, the
No. 18 Cardinal will travel this Saturday to
No. 3 Santa Clara in hopes of continuing their
winning ways.
But taking down the Broncos (7-2-0) will
be no easy feat for Stanford (7-3-0). Santa
Clara is hosting the Cardinal following deci
sive wins over No. 5 UCLA and No. 14 Cal
State-Fullerton last week. The Broncos' jun
ior forward Meagan Snell netted a pair of
goals against UCLA, and senior captain Mar
ian Dalmy recorded two goals against the Ti
tans.
Stanford enters this weekend after notch
ing a pair of shutouts last weekend against
UC-Irvine and San Jose State. Senior mid
fielder Shari Summers netted three goals for
the Cardinal last.
After being named to the National Team
of the Week for the second time in 2006, Sum
mers was also named Pac-10 Player of the
Week yesterday, the second conference honor
of her career.
"I think we definitely have momentum
coming off of two solid wins," Summers said.
"We played well defensively, holding them to
very few shots and we also created a lot of
chances offensively. We have been playing
better and better each game and 1 think this
has given us more and more confidence."
While Stanford entered this season as one
of the youngest teams in the conference, the
squad has become a force on the field. This
year, the Cardinal have one of the most chal
lenging schedules in the nation. Stanford will
face four conference champions, six teams
that finished in the top 25 and three top-10
finishers.
Led by sophomore goalkeeper Alex Gam
ble, the Cardinal's defense will be an impor
tant part of this weekend's match. Stanford's
defense has played a large role in recent wins,
limiting the last eight Cardinal opponents to
two shots on goal per game.
The Broncos, on the other hand, have
given up only five goals all season, so the
match-up promises to be a defensive battle.
If the young Stanford team can pull off this
upset, the Cardinal should enter next week's
Pac-10 opener against USC on a strong note.

The Trojans currently boast a 7-2-1 record.
"I think that if we remain focused and
work hard we can beat anyone," Summers
said. "We may be a young team but we have
very talented players and a deep bench.

Everyone has been playing well, and if we
play hard defensively and create opportuni
ties offensively, we will be able to come out
with a win."

Senior defender Rachel Buehler has helped the Cardinal to seven shutouts this season and was
named to the National Team of the Week in early September for her solid play on the back line.
