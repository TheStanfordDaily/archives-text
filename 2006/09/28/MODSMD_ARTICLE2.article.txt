# Stanford to keep early app
## Harvard, Princeton end early admission 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford will not — at least
for now — change its admis
sions program in response to
Harvard and Princeton, Provost
John Etchemendy said Wednes
day, while fretting that fewer
schools offering early admission
would mean more applications
for Stanford.
In a prominent op-ed in yes
terday's New York Times, the
University's chief academic offi

cer and second-highest-ranking
administrator passionately de
fended Stanford's admissions
procedures and responded to
what he called often misguided
critiques of the early admission
process.
"Stanford is not, at this time,
going to make any change to its
early admission program,"
Etchemendy wrote in an email
response to a Daily inquiry
about his piece. "My greatest
fear, however, is that with Har
vard and Princeton ending their
early programs, the applications
to Stanford's early program will
explode, making it unmanageable.
That remains to be seen."
Harvard announced Sept. 12 that
it will to end its early action program
in 2008. setting off a firestorm of de
bate among other elite schools about
whether the status quo was fair and if
the announced changes at Harvard
would make a difference. Princeton
followed Harvard's lead, and on
Monday, the University of Virginia
became the first top-ranked public
university to follow suit.
'It is a shame that the publicity,so
abundant in its praise, has been so
short on facts and clearheaded analy
sis." htchemendy wrote in the paper
of record.
Ihe Provost offered one of the
most fleshed out rebuttals to criti
cisms of Stanford's system.
"There is nothing about early ad
missions, in itself, that gives an advan
tage to those who apply early," he
wrote."lt all depends on whether the
university imposes lower, the same,
or higher standards to the early pool.
Nor can vou infer the standards bv

simply comparing admission rates in
the early and late pools."
Htchemendy wrote that Stanford
holds applicants in the early pool to
a "somewhat higher standard,"
adding that the admissions depart
ment is careful to not "accept stu
dents early unless we're confident
they would get in during the regular
round."
Ihe provost added that the SAT
scores for early action applicants were
40 points higher than those of stu
dents admitted in the regular pool.
Relating to financial aid. he wrote
that "36 percent to 40 percent of the
students accepted early apply for fi
nancial aid," while "in the regular
round, only slightly more, 40 percent
to 44 percent, seek aid."
I"he Daily could not connect with
Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw,
who was attending meetings on the
East Coast.
University spokesman Alan Acos
ta said that the provost's piece should
help clear up some confusion about
the difference between binding early

decision and non-binding early ac
tion.
"Mis ability to clarify that and to
clarify some of the assumptions
about getting in or not was a great ad
dition to the public discourse on this
subject," Acosta said.
Etchemendy wrote in his article
that the changes will likely result in
more, not fewer college applications
because students will no longer have
the security of knowing their school as
early as December. Instead, to play it
safe, they will apply to more schools
and institutions that still offer early
admission, such as Stanford.
"This will increase the overall
number of college applications, and
that in turn will probably increase,
not decrease, the pressure felt by all
high school seniors going through the
process," he wrote.
His solution?
"Have colleges universally adopt
nonbinding early admission pro
grams, and then apply the same or
higher standards to the early deci
sions as they do to the regular round."
