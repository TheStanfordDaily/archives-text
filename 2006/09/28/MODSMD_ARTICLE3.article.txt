### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Provost John Etchemendy
told The Daily Wednesday that
he would not, if it was offered,
accept a job offer to be the next
president of Harvard Universi
ty-
"lt is flattering that my name
is mentioned in connection with
the Harvard presidency, but 1
have no intention or desire to
leave my current position, which
1 believe is the best position in
higher education." Etchemendy
wrote in an email.
Etchemendy has been men
tioned as a possible contender

for the job vacated by the em
battled Larry Summers, a for
mer Treasury secretary who
came under intense fire for re
marks about women and
clashed with some members of
the faculty.
Etchemendy disputed a sug
gestion by The Daily that the
Harvard presidency might be
considered the most sought
after job in higher education.
"I am surprised that you
think that the Harvard presi
dency is the most coveted posi
tion in academia," he wrote. "1
certainly would not leave the
best university in the world to
take it!"
