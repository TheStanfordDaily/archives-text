# Despite rumors, provost will stay
## Costa Rican bookie has 4 to 1 odds to contrary 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Provost John Etchemendy
told The Daily Wednesday that
he would not, if it was offered,
accept a job offer to be the next
president of Harvard Universi
ty-
"lt is flattering that my name
is mentioned in connection with
the Harvard presidency, but 1
have no intention or desire to
leave my current position, which
1 believe is the best position in
higher education." Etchemendy
wrote in an email.
Etchemendy has been men
tioned as a possible contender

for the job vacated by the em
battled Larry Summers, a for
mer Treasury secretary who
came under intense fire for re
marks about women and
clashed with some members of
the faculty.
Etchemendy disputed a sug
gestion by The Daily that the
Harvard presidency might be
considered the most sought
after job in higher education.
"I am surprised that you
think that the Harvard presi
dency is the most coveted posi
tion in academia," he wrote. "1
certainly would not leave the
best university in the world to
take it!"
The Boston Globe and Har
vard Crimson have identified
Etchemendy.as a prominent leader
in higher education and a potential
candidate for the post. A Costa
Rican gambling house placed the
odds of Etchemendy being named
as president at 4 to 1 in August, the
third most likely to gain the post.
The revelation was welcomed by
University officials, who said they
personally enjoy working with
Etchemendy, the chief academic of
ficer at the University.
"I'm very happy to hear him say
that," said Alan Acosta, the director
of University Communications.
A nine-member search commit
tee. made up of six members of the
Harvard Corporation and three
members of the Board of Overseers,
has been deliberating and vetting
candidates for the presidential post.
