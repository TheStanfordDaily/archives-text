# Hart: Dems must look to core values
## Former senator says the party should follow New Deal and JFK, not Clinton 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Former senator and two-time presidential candi
date Gary Hart issued an impassioned plea for his
Democratic Party to stand up for the principles that
helped spawn the New Deal and shape the Great So
ciety in a Wednesday speech at the Stanford Book

store.
Out to promote his latest of 17 books "The
Courage of Our Convictions: A Manifesto for De
mocrats," Hart told a crowd of about two dozen that
the Democrats must differentiate themselves from
Republicans if they hope to win elections.
"This book is trying to get my party to say some
thing" Hart told The Daily. "I care about the Demo
cratic Party. I 'm frustrated by it but am just one voice
in a wilderness."
No longer constrained by the desire to win elect
ed office. Hart has been vocal about the need for po
litically controversial aims like universal health care

and free airtime for candidates.
The near 20-minute speech closely paralleled the
book's content. With his party in a position to capture
the House of Representatives for the first time since
1994, Hart acknowledged that the hook comes
amidst a quickening "drumbeat of insistence for De
mocrats to say something strong and definitive.
"There are an awful lot of people under the age of
20,30 and even 40 who have not really ever heard a
definitive statement of Democrats' core beliefs," he
said, jingling his rental car keys while pacing in front
