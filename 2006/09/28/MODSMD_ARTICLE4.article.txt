# Hart: Dems must look to core values
## Former senator says the party should follow New Deal and JFK, not Clinton 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Former senator and two-time presidential candi
date Gary Hart issued an impassioned plea for his
Democratic Party to stand up for the principles that
helped spawn the New Deal and shape the Great So
ciety in a Wednesday speech at the Stanford Book

store.
Out to promote his latest of 17 books "The
Courage of Our Convictions: A Manifesto for De
mocrats," Hart told a crowd of about two dozen that
the Democrats must differentiate themselves from
Republicans if they hope to win elections.
"This book is trying to get my party to say some
thing" Hart told The Daily. "I care about the Demo
cratic Party. I 'm frustrated by it but am just one voice
in a wilderness."
No longer constrained by the desire to win elect
ed office. Hart has been vocal about the need for po
litically controversial aims like universal health care

and free airtime for candidates.
The near 20-minute speech closely paralleled the
book's content. With his party in a position to capture
the House of Representatives for the first time since
1994, Hart acknowledged that the hook comes
amidst a quickening "drumbeat of insistence for De
mocrats to say something strong and definitive.
"There are an awful lot of people under the age of
20,30 and even 40 who have not really ever heard a
definitive statement of Democrats' core beliefs," he
said, jingling his rental car keys while pacing in front

of the podium. "My basic political
theory is that the swing voters of the
country will not listen to any of our
policies until they know who we are
and why we are different."
Hart reminisced on the heyday of
liberalism, from 1932 to 1968. He
commended Franklin D. Roosevelt
for constructing a social safety net.
Harry Truman for reaching out to al
lies with the Marshall Plan. John
Kennedy for inspiring a generation
of public servants and Lyndon B.
Johnson for leading the nation to
ward civil rights.
He criticized Bill Clinton and his
political consultants for a strategy of
triangulation. which he said won
centrists but compromised liberal
convictions.
"1 think Bill Clinton missed a

great opportunity in the 90s to come
up with a post-Soviet. post-Cold War
strategy for America,"he said.
Hart said he hoped the Democ
rats could agree on a common set of
principles as the presidential primar
ies approach in 2008.
"You can disagree with the poli
cies. but you ought to agree on the
philosophy." he said.
The Coloradan told the crowd
that he warned many times of a com
ing terrorist attack against the Unit
ed States before Sept. 11. He said
that Secretary of State and former
University provost Condoleezza
Rice was an adviser to his 1984 cam
paign for the Democratic nomina
tion when she was a Ph.D. student at
the University of Denver. Citing his
long acquaintance with Rice, he said
he warned her of impending danger
on Sept. b — five days before the at
tack — but she did nothing.
The senator alleged that the Re
publican Party is trying to elect sec
retaries of state in state governments

nationwide to help tilt elections in
the G.O.P.'s favor. In most states, that
post administers elections.
"This is a political operation that
is out to take control around the
country," he said.
Hart saw his hopes for election to
the presidency sink after he dared re
porters to follow him around,becom
ing the center of a scandal in 1987
when pictures were run of a much
younger model sitting on his lap
aboard the boat "Monkey Business."
Hart was visiting the University
as part of a National Academy of Sci
ences task force on science and secu
rity. He had appeared on CNN's
Paula Zahn to discuss the possibility
of an American war against Iran just
before his book signing, and criti
cized the network for spending 10
minutes discussing the circum
stances of a reported suicide attempt
by football star Terrell Owens and
only four minutes talking about the
possibility of military action against
Iran.
