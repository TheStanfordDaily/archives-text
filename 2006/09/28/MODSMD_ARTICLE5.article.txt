## University, city partner for new homeless center 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The brand-new five-story brick
building on El Camino Real near the
Town and Country Shopping Center is
hard to miss. But instead of selling
flowers or seafood, this facility's aim is
to reach out to the hundreds of com
munity members in need.
The Opportunity Center of the
Mid-Peninsula combines a wide array
of services for unhoused community
members as well as 88 units of afford
able housing, opened its doors on
Sept. 17, the culmination of $24 million
in fundraising and eight years of lead
ership by the nonprofit Community
Working Group (CWG).
Sophomore Josie Valenzuela
toured the Center on its first day of
service, Sept. 11, with her Sophomore
College class, "The University as a
Local and Global Citizen." Valenzuela
said she was overwhelmed by the wide
range of resources at the Opportunity
Center.
"1 couldn't believe how compre
hensive the whole thing was," Valen
zuela said.

The ground floor of the building
features hospitality services, with
showers, laundry machines, Internet
access and snacks. There are also
health care and supportive services
such as job training, housing referral
and legal aid.
Apartments fill the second through
fifth floors. Seventy of these perma
nent housing units are for singles,
while the remaining 18 are separate
and for families. Each floor also shares
a common area with couches and a tel
evision.
Lauren Finzer, a sophomore in the
same SoCo class, noted the natural
light of the gathering spaces. "I really
liked how open it felt," she said.

location.
