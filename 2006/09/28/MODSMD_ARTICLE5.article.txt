## University, city partner for new homeless center 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The brand-new five-story brick
building on El Camino Real near the
Town and Country Shopping Center is
hard to miss. But instead of selling
flowers or seafood, this facility's aim is
to reach out to the hundreds of com
munity members in need.
The Opportunity Center of the
Mid-Peninsula combines a wide array
of services for unhoused community
members as well as 88 units of afford
able housing, opened its doors on
Sept. 17, the culmination of $24 million
in fundraising and eight years of lead
ership by the nonprofit Community
Working Group (CWG).
Sophomore Josie Valenzuela
toured the Center on its first day of
service, Sept. 11, with her Sophomore
College class, "The University as a
Local and Global Citizen." Valenzuela
said she was overwhelmed by the wide
range of resources at the Opportunity
Center.
"1 couldn't believe how compre
hensive the whole thing was," Valen
zuela said.

The ground floor of the building
features hospitality services, with
showers, laundry machines, Internet
access and snacks. There are also
health care and supportive services
such as job training, housing referral
and legal aid.
Apartments fill the second through
fifth floors. Seventy of these perma
nent housing units are for singles,
while the remaining 18 are separate
and for families. Each floor also shares
a common area with couches and a tel
evision.
Lauren Finzer, a sophomore in the
same SoCo class, noted the natural
light of the gathering spaces. "I really
liked how open it felt," she said.
When El Nino flooded the Red
Cross building in 1998, the Urban Min
istry Drop-In Center —which previ
ously provided limited, outdoor serv
ices for Palo Alto's unhoused popula
tion — was left scrambling for a new
location.

and president of the CWG , and the
group embraced the task of finding a

permanent facility to provide and
expand these services.
With the opening of the Center,
the CWG has appointed Inn Vision
and Property Management to man
age the services and administer the
housing units.
The housing units have been in
great demand. The Opportunity
Center received over 200 applica
tions for the 88 available units.

pared the Center's comfortable fa
cilities to that of a hotel, which he
said helped to normalize the
lifestyles of the residents.
"I really like the idea that the Op
portunity Center enables people,
helping them to get back on their
feet and become mainstream citi
zens again," he added.
Barr said that seeing the Oppor
tunity Center come to fruition was
very rewarding because it provided a
model for a University and commu
nity partnership.
"There was a commonality of in
terest around this focused project,
and we've been successful in knitting

together a partnership that has been
crucial to our success," he said.
"The project made me extremely
proud of our community," said Lin
guistics and Philosophy Prof. lorn
Wasow, vice president of the CWG.
"It's quite amazing to me that we've
encountered so little opposition;
there were unanimous votes in favor
of the Center every step of the way.
We were in a lucky position to he
able to catalyze."
With the completion of the Op
portunity Center projeeffortct, Barr
and Wasow have already turned to
another project with a new nonprof
it called the Community Housing
Alliance.
"What we learned was that the
social and political capital that de
veloped [from the Opportunity Cen
ter project] was far too valuable to
leave idle," Barr said.
The organization, a logical exten
sion of the Opportunity Center, aims
to create more than 50 units of very
low income housing in Palo Alto,
about a block away from the Oppor
tunity Center.
According to Barr, the housing
hopes to attract families earning be
tween 30 and 35 percent of the area
median income, is between $30,000
and $40,000 for a family of four in
Palo Alto.
