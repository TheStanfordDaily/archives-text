# CAMPUS LIFE
## Prof donates $100,000 to dept. 
### ANDREW VALENCIA 
The Marconi Society recently
awarded Electrical Engineering
Prof. John Cioffi a $100,000 cash
prize, naming him a 2006 Fellow for
his pioneering research in commu
nication technologies and his con
tributions to the development of
modern DSL Internet access.
Upon receiving the prestigious
award, Cioffi donated the entire
prize to the Department of Electri
cal Engineering to help finance a re
search project aimed at advancing
Internet capabilities. In addition to
Cioffi's individual contribution,
France Telecom, a corporation spe
cializing in communication tech
nologies, has agreed to match his
donation.
"It will fund some research that
is close to my heart," Cioffi said.The
focus of his research aims to further
a new Internet connection known
as Dynamic Spectrum Manage
ment [DSM] — expected to sur
pass the capabilities of current DSL
technologies. DSM will permit nu
merous Internet users onto the
same bandwidth at the same time
and will allow for more information
to be transmitted along fewer lines

at faster speeds than current
servers.
The Marconi Fellowship, which
began in 1975, is awarded by the in
ternational Marconi Society at Co
lumbia University. The Fellowship
was founded, according to the or
ganization, "to enhance the spirit of
Guglielmo Marconi — scientist,en
gineer, inventor, and entrepreneur
— his contributions to communica
tions and information, and his de
termination that such knowledge
be directed to the social, economic
and cultural improvement of all hu
manity."
Bruce Wooley, director of the
Electrical Engineering department
and a colleague of Cioffi. praised
the achievements that led to the
Marconi Fellowship and dubbed
Cioffi "the father of DSL."
"John pioneered [DSL| by
working with his students." said
Wooley. "He's had a major influ
ence on the Internet as it is."
According to Wooley, the major
obstacle confronting modem de
signers and electrical engineers
prior to the development of DSL
was finding a way to send a large
amount of high-speed data over ex
isting phone lines. Cioffi was elected
to the National Academy of Engi
neering for his research in this area.
I le has also published nearly 300 pa
pers on topics relating to electrical
engineering and currently has over
40 licensed patents to his credit.
While Cioffi has made numerous
advances in areas of technological re
search. Wooley insisted that his col
league continues to remain dedicated
to teaching and training future elec
trical engineers and modem design
ers in his advanced courses. Each
quarter he manages to instruct at
least one course in electrical engi
neering in addition to his other re

search.
"He continues to teach and super
vise Ph.D. students much as he has
since he came to Stanford in the
1980'5," Wooley said.
Cioffi first learned that he had
won the Marconi Fellowship nearly a
year ago, and has still continued with
his research trying to discover new
and innovative ways for designing
Internet modems. Looking hack on
the innovations that his work has
helped create, Cioffi expresses great
enthusiasm about furthering Inter
net technologies.
"Every researcher dreams that
their research will become an ad
vance," he said. "That's one of the re
wards of doing research in our area.
That's what we shoot for."
The 2006 Marconi Fellowship will
be presented at a gala dinner on Oct.
12 at the Computer I listory Museum
in Mountain View, California.
