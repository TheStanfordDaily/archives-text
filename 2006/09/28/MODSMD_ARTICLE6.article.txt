### ANDREW VALENCIA 
The Marconi Society recently
awarded Electrical Engineering
Prof. John Cioffi a $100,000 cash
prize, naming him a 2006 Fellow for
his pioneering research in commu
nication technologies and his con
tributions to the development of
modern DSL Internet access.
Upon receiving the prestigious
award, Cioffi donated the entire
prize to the Department of Electri
cal Engineering to help finance a re
search project aimed at advancing
Internet capabilities. In addition to
Cioffi's individual contribution,
France Telecom, a corporation spe
cializing in communication tech
nologies, has agreed to match his
donation.
"It will fund some research that
is close to my heart," Cioffi said.The
focus of his research aims to further
a new Internet connection known
as Dynamic Spectrum Manage
ment [DSM] — expected to sur
pass the capabilities of current DSL
technologies. DSM will permit nu
merous Internet users onto the
same bandwidth at the same time
and will allow for more information
to be transmitted along fewer lines

at faster speeds than current
servers.
The Marconi Fellowship, which
began in 1975, is awarded by the in
ternational Marconi Society at Co
lumbia University. The Fellowship
was founded, according to the or
ganization, "to enhance the spirit of
Guglielmo Marconi — scientist,en
gineer, inventor, and entrepreneur
— his contributions to communica
tions and information, and his de
termination that such knowledge
be directed to the social, economic
and cultural improvement of all hu
manity."
Bruce Wooley, director of the
Electrical Engineering department
and a colleague of Cioffi. praised
the achievements that led to the
Marconi Fellowship and dubbed
Cioffi "the father of DSL."
"John pioneered [DSL| by
working with his students." said
Wooley. "He's had a major influ
ence on the Internet as it is."
According to Wooley, the major
obstacle confronting modem de
signers and electrical engineers
prior to the development of DSL
was finding a way to send a large
