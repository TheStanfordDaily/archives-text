## Guest Columnist: Kat Lewin Does anyone know where my bus stop is? 
### 
When 1 decided to come to Moscow, I
thought I was prepared for every
thing. As a Slavic Languages and
Literature major, I've picked up some
knowledge of the Russian culture through
its major novels. I figured I knew pretty
much what to expect: horse-drawn buggies,
psychopaths killing old pawnbrokers, war.
possibly followed by peace of some kind
you know, typical facts of your typical 21st
century metropolis. What I didn't expect was
to spend half an hour on my first morning in
Moscow with an old woman waving her um
brella in my face screaming at me in the mid
dle of a crowded bus. 1 couldn't pick up
everything she was saying, but the phrase
"You'll die!" seemed to be a major theme.
You see. running late for my first day of
orientation, I got out of the shower, loaded
up my bags and jumped on my local bus with
my hair still wet. Unbeknownst to me. the
Russian Old Wives' Journal of Medical Sci
ence has conclusively proven that going out
in public with wet hair leads to pneumonia
and almost instantaneous death. The only
cure: public humiliation.
Sadly, that early morning encounter was
one of my better experiences navigating my
way around the city. From my apartment to
the Stanford institute, I have an hour-long
commute including a bus, the metro and a
short walk to classes. This may sound like a
piece of cake, but by the end of my first day
I didn't care if I ever made it to classes again,
as long as I got out alive.
To say I have a good sense of direction
would be a flat-out lie. To say that my cre
ativity for shortcuts is eclipsed only by my
staggering incompetence would be a little
closer to the truth. Once on my way to a local
supermarket in my hometown I missed a
turn and ended up driving around Nevada
for five and a half hours, in which time I tres
passed on government property, accidental
ly crossed the state line and made a three
point turn on the freeway. Friends don't
even trust my directions to the bathroom.
Unleash skills like these in a 7(X)-square
mile city and you have a disaster on your
hands.
I ended up making it to the institute fine
the first day because my host father walked
me to the bus, held my hand as we crossed
streets and generally did everything short of
pinning my address to my jacket — which, in

retrospect, 1 wish he had.
The first leg of my return journey: the
metro station. To get a glimpse of this, imag
ine a Caltrain station. Now forget about it. If
Ozzy Osbourne and Slayer had a concert to
gether with Satan singing backup, the mosh
pit would be less crazy than some Moscow
metro stops during rush hour.
Even getting off the metro poses its own
challenges. After battling epically with the
Russian language for two years, it still
sounds hard to me, full of angles and abrupt
U-turns. Straining to listen for the 14-sylla
ble word that may or may not be your stop is
like getting elbowed in the face. Of course,
considering how crowded the metro was,
maybe I did get elbowed in the face.
i finally got off the metro and walked
right onto a bus, heaving a huge sigh of relief.
A sigh of relief that was revoked half an
hour later, when I called my host father
crouched under a streetlight in a dark alley,
hysterically trying to communicate that I
didn't even know in which part of the city I
was or where to begin looking for a street
sign and combing the dregs of my Russian
vocabulary for the phrase: "I think that dog
has rabies." Incredible man that he is, my
host father finally helped me figure out
where I was and came to meet me. Together
we walked back to the apartment. Which
was only a block away.
First day nightmares aside, I'm actually
learning my way around the city and my
morning commute has become one of my fa
vorite parts of the day. It gives me time to
daydream, people watch and look at the
parks and buildings that are becoming the
background of my daily life. Now that I've
got my bearings. I love the fierce flowing en
ergy of the crowds — even when I 'm afraid
I'll accidentally get pushed into the subway
track — and the apartments that intimidat
ed me so much are now more like rosettes on
this gorgeous wedding cake of a city.
Yesterday, taking the (correct) bus home
from a late dinner, I took a look at the chaos
of lights and people and apartments and ac
tually smiled to myself.Then the old man sit
ting across from me poked me with his cane
and told me to stop chewing on my pen.
