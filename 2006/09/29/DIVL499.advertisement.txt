Covering Iraq: A War Like No Other
THURSDAY, OCTOBER STH, 2006 @ 7:00 RM.
The discussion will include the special security and logistical issues involved in covering Iraq. Such as
how correspondents and editors manage to cover a war that presents unparalleled risks and is the
subject of intense partisan debate, how we try to balance and screen the increased use of Iraqi
employees to go where Western reporters cannot and the contrasts with this summer's Lebanon war.
Susan Chira was named foreign editor for The New York Times in January 2004. Since September
2002, Ms. Chira had been editorial director of book development. Before that she was the editor of
the Week in Review section at The Times since October 1999, after having served as deputy foreign
editor of the newspaper since February 1997.
