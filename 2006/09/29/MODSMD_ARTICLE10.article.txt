### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Philosophers, economists and pol
icy experts from the United States
and l urope met yesterday at the Ar
rillaga Alumni Center to kick off a
three-day conference that will exam
ine moral and egalitarian concerns
related to the world's dominant eco
nomic system.
'I quality is an analytically com
plicated, value-laden and empirically
messy subject," said Debra Satz, as
sociate professor of philosophy at
Stanford, who will speak Saturday in
a lecture titled "Voluntary Slavery
and the Limits of the Market." "This
conference is guided by the idea that
our answers to many questions about
equality require input from many
different types of scholars working
together and exchanging ideas with
one another."
More than 60 people attended
the first session, "The Market:
Good, Bad, or Just Indifferent?"
During the 90-minute talk. Anne
Phillips, professor of gender theory
at the London School of Economics,

outlined reasons why the market is
useful, yet often criticized.
"Nobody believes that the market
can be eliminated and nobody be
lieves that the market works perfect
ly," she said.
Phillips pointed out that even
egalitarians have reason to favor
capitalist market system?. They're
better than the alternatives, she ar
gued. and the market values all
workers for what they can con
tribute to accumulating capital.
Philips also noted that the market
works in a neutral, even-handed
way.
She then expressed concern over
how many perceive the market as an
"enemy of equality." In Phillips's
view, such criticisms concede too
much to the notion of the market,
creating a "serious stumbling block"
to egalitarianism.
Attendees found the integrated
theme of the discussion novel and
challenging.
"I found it interesting the way the
speaker drew connections between
underlying conceptions of the mar
ket. as well as the challenges she
raised in pursuing egalitarian goals,"
said third-year law student Rebecca
Thalberg.
Today the Alumni Center will wit
ness a packed schedule of lectures

and discussions ranging in topic from
egalitarianism and insurance mar
kets to policy issues surrounding the
unpaid care sector in the U.S. econo
my. These events will be led by re
searchers and teachers hailing from
institutions of higher learning in Nor
way, France and the United States.
The final three sessions will be held at
the Schwab Residential Center to
morrow.
The Equality and the Market con
ference is only the latest in a series of
events organized by Stanford's ethics
program.
According to Joan Berry, coordi
nator of the Ethics in Society pro
gram. past conferences have focused
on the theory and practice of equali
ty, equality and global justice, and
other more disparate topics. Looking
ahead, her organization plans to co
sponsor a conference on equality
and education with the Spencer
Foundation next year.
