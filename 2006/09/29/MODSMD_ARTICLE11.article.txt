# Opinions
## Public Editor: Whitney Sado 
### 
II you're a regular reader — or even if
you're not — of these Opinions pages,
you are probably aware that a recurring
theme ol the Editorial Board's views is
greater transparency and increased commu
nication between the administration and
students. That's a great refrain for The Daily
to echo every couple of weeks or so. but it
seems a little hypocritical to throw around
such buzz words and not hold yourself as an
organization accountable to the same ideal
that you have for the University at large.
One of the marvelous things about the
newspaper you're currently reading is that it
is entirely student-run and student-man
aged. Students write and edit the articles, sell
the ads. make the business decisions, lay the
pages out and are responsible for the start
to-finish process of producing a paper every
night. As an independent and self-sufficient
newspaper, the University cannot exercise
control over The Daily and has no say as to
what gets published and what doesn't.
There are a couple of communication pro
fessors who check in periodically,provide un
obtrusive oversight and — after publication
— will notify the editor-in-chief if he makes
an editorial decision they question. But be
yond that. Hie Daily is really just a small
band of extremely dedicated and hardwork
ing students who are willing to pour count
less hours a week into an often thankless job
that certainly does nothing to improve their
GPAs. 1 know just how many hours and just
how thankless — and just how unfortunate
for the GPA — the job is. because I myself
was part of this band just a few months ago.
Until graduating in June. 1 worked in a va
riety of capacities and departments at The
Daily. 1 served as staff writer, beat writer,
desk editor and managing editor in the news,
sports and opinions departments. 1 also func
tioned as the de facto editor-in-chief on nu
merous occasions last year, so I know just
how stressful and ambiguous the ultimate de
cision-making process can be when you have
to make snap judgments on a breaking story,
the administration's offices are closed for the
night and the police can't be reached. Yet
while my insider perspective affords me a
certain sympathy to the constraints these stu
dent journalists face. 1 am nonetheless quite

critical of what I have seen over the past four
years as sloppy, careless or often just lazy
journalism, and have no qualms about calling
the staff members out when it occurs.
1 am no longer involved in any part of the
writing, editing or production process. My
only affiliation with the organization now is as
Public Editor — a kind of cushy retirement
job in which 1 serve as an impartial commen
tator on the paper and its coverage. 1 hope to
provide the greater transparency and in
creased communication that should be de
manded not just of the administration but of
the student newspaper as well. Many newspa
pers these days employ someone in a similar
watchdog role. News outfits should be pub
licly held accountable to their readerships,
and that's where you the reader come in.
Whether you're an administrator who
thinks a reporter has not done a fair job — or
any job — investigating your side of a story, an
athlete who is sick of having your file photos
misattributed to one of your teammates in cap
tions, a freshman who can't believe that there
are more typos on the front page than your high
school newspaper ever had or just a disgruntled
senior who would really like the Sudoku puzzle
not to run over the fold anymore (seriously —
that was such a problem last year, wasn't it?),
email me and let me know. I probably won't ad
dress the Sudoku complaints, but 1 will do my
best to respond in my biweekly column toother
concerns that you. ITie Daily's readers, have.
The only revisions my editors are allowed
to make are grammatical ones. They cannot
change my column's content in any way.somy
opinions will in no way be diluted or altered
by The Daily's staff. I will do my best both to
critique the quality of the paper's reporting
and the soundness of its editorial judgments,
as well as consider and covey the realities of
what it's like working at The Daily. You may
actually agree with lTie Daily and disagree
with me on various issues, or you may dis
agree with us both. Regardless, 1 hope that
transparency and communication move be
yond the Editorials to The Daily itself.
