# We love the band
## 
### 
I am not in the band. I am not dating some
body in the band, nor do bandies make
up a significant part of my social circle. In
fact, the longest relationship I have ever had
with music was a stint as a clarinetist in mid
dle school â€” which ended tragically with a
breakup reminiscent of that between I lenry
VIII and Anne Boleyn.
Why. then, do I care so much about the
fate of the beloved LSJUMB? Because I am
a Stanford student.
Love the band or hate it. a Stanford stu
dent's college experience is incomplete with
out at least one encounter with LSJUMB. For
some, once is enough, but many more of us
relish every opportunity we get to witness the
band's latest outrageous escapades. So. when
the band got banned recently, it was only nat
ural that Stanford students and alumni alike
banded together to bandage the wound left
by the loss of this treasured Stanford icon.
We like to tell our stodgy East Coast friends
time and again how laid-back and cool Stanford
is. But the fact still remains that we go to a school
where most students would willingly sacrifice
an entire weekend (well, at least one night) of
partying in order to study for midterms. And,
while that's all good and well, it's nice to be able
to cling to the warm, fuzzy feeling that we get

from knowing that no high-falutin' East Coast
school's idea of fun and craziness can ever com
pare to that perpetuated by LSJUMB.
Yes, many of us here at Stanford managed
to avoid serious trouble throughout high
school, and some of us are still goody-goodies
to this day. (Don't try to hide behind your frat
boy facade; 1 know you're a mama's boy at
heart.) But are we embarrassed by the band's
antics as the University's administrators say we
should be? I lardly In fact, 1 suspect that many
Stanford students rather enjoy living vicarious
ly through the band's scandalous behavior.
Okay, it would be good for everyone if our
classmates would avoid getting arrested, but I
have to wonder why the administration keeps
bringing up the fact that the band "does not
