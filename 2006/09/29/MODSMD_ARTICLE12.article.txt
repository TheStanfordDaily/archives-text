# We love the band
## 
### 
I am not in the band. I am not dating some
body in the band, nor do bandies make
up a significant part of my social circle. In
fact, the longest relationship I have ever had
with music was a stint as a clarinetist in mid
dle school — which ended tragically with a
breakup reminiscent of that between I lenry
VIII and Anne Boleyn.
Why. then, do I care so much about the
fate of the beloved LSJUMB? Because I am
a Stanford student.
Love the band or hate it. a Stanford stu
dent's college experience is incomplete with
out at least one encounter with LSJUMB. For
some, once is enough, but many more of us
relish every opportunity we get to witness the
band's latest outrageous escapades. So. when
the band got banned recently, it was only nat
ural that Stanford students and alumni alike
banded together to bandage the wound left
by the loss of this treasured Stanford icon.
We like to tell our stodgy East Coast friends
time and again how laid-back and cool Stanford
is. But the fact still remains that we go to a school
where most students would willingly sacrifice
an entire weekend (well, at least one night) of
partying in order to study for midterms. And,
while that's all good and well, it's nice to be able
to cling to the warm, fuzzy feeling that we get

from knowing that no high-falutin' East Coast
school's idea of fun and craziness can ever com
pare to that perpetuated by LSJUMB.
Yes, many of us here at Stanford managed
to avoid serious trouble throughout high
school, and some of us are still goody-goodies
to this day. (Don't try to hide behind your frat
boy facade; 1 know you're a mama's boy at
heart.) But are we embarrassed by the band's
antics as the University's administrators say we
should be? I lardly In fact, 1 suspect that many
Stanford students rather enjoy living vicarious
ly through the band's scandalous behavior.
Okay, it would be good for everyone if our
classmates would avoid getting arrested, but I
have to wonder why the administration keeps
bringing up the fact that the band "does not

have a respectable image" (a quote
from an online response to a Daily ar
ticle about the band's suspension) as a
reason for its necessary reform. Has
the band ever scared away a prospec
tive student? Has alum ever been
turned down from a job because the
word "Stanford" automatically brings
up images of juvenile delinquents and
college drop-outs? Maybe if Stanford
had a "respectable" image, people
might donate millions of dollars for
things like new stadiums and law
school dormitories. Too bad the band
ruined that for us.
Let's suppose, for a moment, that
we do have a brand new stadium, that
the band's image hasn't single-hand
edly marred Stanford's image beyond
repair. Do you think the administra
tion would allow LSJUMB to play at
the inaugural game (whether under
suspension or not), or would they in
stead choose to christen this new Stan

ford landmark with a fleet of good of
boys swooping down from Navy
planes in a picturesque, marketable
fashion? (1 won't even venture to
guess how they will further commer
cialize the time-honored tradition of
Band Run in the years to come.)
LSJUMB is a vital part of a Stan
ford education. Just ask has any alum
or upperclassman; Stanford students
love and need the band. But. above
all. we must keep in mind the most
vulnerable members of the Stanford
community: the freshman class. Wit h
out the band, how will they ever learn
when to jump in "All Right Now"?
Whose outfits — or lack thereof —
will they gawk at during football
games? And. most importantly, who
will they look to and say. "Hey. I've
done some crazy stuff in my day. but
I never joined the band.That means 1
still have room for improvement."
