Band Run article misleading
The headline and layout of "The Band Run
that wasn't" article on Sept. 25 was misleading.
It set readers up with the impression that the
Band Run somehow did not happen or was
coordinated poorly. The reality was i|uite to
the contrary.The Band Run did in tact happen
(seemingly against all odds). Perhaps a more
fitting title would have been"The Band Run
that almost wasn't." That it did happen was
thanks to the efforts of so many Orientation
staff, volunteers and the administration, and it
was coordinated and executed flawlessly.
Although my comment was in its correct
context in the text ol the article, when dis
played in larger print along with the title, it
seemed to imply that the event was not well
coordinated. "Frantic" did not refer to the
Band Run. but to the pace at which we were
working in the days before the Band Run to
make it happen. It referred to the weeks, and
in some cases, months before New Student
Orientation during which the staff and volun
teers prepared for the inauguration and wel
come of nearly 1.7(H) freshman and transfer
students.
Of course, we all know there s as little use
crying over a printed article as spilled milk,
but I hope that this article does not detract
from the hard work and success ol the hun
dreds of individuals who make Stanford s
New Student Orientation a reality each
year.

Setting the Record Straight on Iraq
WMD and the Harris Poll
Michael Wilkerson's argument to en
courage people to vote is flawed ("Voting:
An early reminder." Sept. 27). He cites a
June 2006 I larris Interactive poll which sup
posedly shows that a quarter of Americans
incorrectly believe weapons of mass de
struction have been discovered in Iraq.This
assertion is wrong on multiple counts.
First, the Harris poll was conducted in
July, not June. Second, it showed that 50 per
cent. not 25 percent, of those surveyed be
lieve Saddam possessed WMD when we in
vaded. Iliird. Iraq did possess WMD when
we invaded. We know this to be true because
the weapons have been found.
An intelligence report declassified this sum
mer revealed that Coalition forces have discov
ered hundreds of chemical weapons, and mili
tary officials testified to Congress that these
munitions, which constitute WMD. were pro
duced in the 1980s. These findings should be
viewed alongside the Duelfer Report, which
concluded that Saddam's long-term goal was to
rebuild his WMD programs,and the testimony
of David Kay, who told Congress that Iraq was
even more dangerous than we had thought.de
spite the absence of WMD stockpiles.
The real concern is the 50 percent of
Americans who are not aware of these facts.

()ur campus, although very safe, has
had its share of crime. It would be hard
to find someone who does not have an
acquaintance whose bike or computer
has been stolen. Although it is becom
ing a distant memory, there are still
people around who remember, or per
haps were victimized by the serial
groper of 2(X)3. And just last spring,
there were several armed robberies on
campus. And yet, despite this, what are
massive amounts of police resources
being dedicated to? Education, and I
can only assume that soon, enforce
ment of the new bicycle ban.
Stanford, because of its safe atmos
phere, only employs 24 sworn officers
and lb un sworn officers.That means
that on average there are only eight of
ficers on duty at any given time and
only five of those are deputized. Given
these limited resources, is it beneficial
to the Stanford campus for the police
to focus their energies on this new rule,
when there are much more dangerous
crimes to be prevented?
Also, at the corner of Alvarado

and Campus Drive numerous cars
run the stop sign; there are also many
people violating the speed limit. Al
though I have seen many cars going in
excess of 40 miles per hour down
Campus Drive, typically the police do
not pull these speeders over. Which
poses a greater threat to pedestrians,
cars running stop signs and speeding
or bicyclists hiking down the arcades?
With all ot these challenges to our
collective safety, we might ask about
the priorities of the Stanford police. It
almost seems that they are more inter
ested in protecting campus visitors
than in safeguarding the students and
faculty. Why else would the police di
vert resources away from the night
time shifts, where violent crimes have
recently occurred'.' Why else would the
police focus on enforcing the bicycle
ban instead of curbing traffic violations
which occur in areas where visitors sel
dom venture? We as a community
must ask ourselves not whether the bi
cycle ban damages the campus atmos
phere but whether or not it is a correct
allocation of police resources. Is this al
location of police resource making the
campus safer or is it only making the
campus safer for a few people to the
detriment to everyone else?
