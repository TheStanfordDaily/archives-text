It seems like everywhere I turn, people are
saying either, "That Leland Stanford Ju
nior University Marching Band has done
it again!" or "Mark Zuckerberg and Face
book have done it again!" But has anyone
mentioned how much the two have in com
mon?
Let's be honest. Watching the Stanford
Band perform at half-time is probably a lot
like a board meeting at Facebook. I imagine
the meeting is full of young, pimply computer
science majors gathering around some sort of
marginally-funny-at-the-time inside joke and
cheap beer. We don't need to see this.
Open to Anyone
Apparently, any unattractive person
(some of whom aren't "legal") with a dot com
e-mail address can join Facebook — and the
same is true for the Stanford Band.
1 used to enjoy Facebook back in the day
when it was an elite social networking plat
form where I could comfortably communi
cate with my friends and colleagues. But
sadly, Mark and 1 aren't listed as friends,so he
probably didn't notice that I don't have "get
ting cyber-stalked" or "getting my identity
stolen" listed in my profile under interests
and activities. (Maybe 1 should give him a
"poke?") Perhaps had he seen my profile.he
also would have caught the fact that pre-teen
girls from red states don't exactly do it for me.
Yet somehow, I'm unable to defend myself
from their "friendship" requests. Can't he
make them go away vis-a-vis a simple
unchecked box?
And 1 can appreciate the fact that the
Stanford Band is a student organization (in
stead of. say. a musical organization that can
audition members), but apparently their
chaotic "non-traditional" musical approach
includes re-enactments from World of War
craft battles from the night before at Kyle's
mom's house (last one to the old band shack
is the proverbial level 20 rotten egg!) or to see
how many "Kicked Out of Stadium Forever"
Magic Cards a loser can collect. Since when
does "non-traditional" mean "out of tune and
annoying?"
Waste of Time
Sure, they can both kill 10 minutes, but
nothing more ever comes of either. I used to
cherish the old Stanford Stadium because the
lines to the "trough" were so long they took
the entire half-time show, helping me avoid
the band altogether. Now, with these fancy
new self-flushing urinals around every corner,
the sparkly new stadium offers no such es
cape. In fact, they neglected to mention that
we'd actually be 20 feet closer to the Band
when they sold us on the new stadium. (Side

note to the administration: You got us good!
You!)
In addition. Facebook used to be a fun way
to connect with friends and learn more about
them. But the newest features of Facebook
have turned a fun little game of show-and-tell
into a not-so-fun little game of hide and stalk.
Apparently "hold an elected office" is a new
feature that most users carelessly leave
unchecked.
Out of'Tunc
Apparently, in the quasi-democratic biz
zaro-world of Facebook Land, if hundreds of
thousands of users join a certain group plead
ing for changes to the site. Lord Darth
Zuckerberg will appease their cries and re
store harmony to the universe again. Face
book has lost touch with its users and appears
to seek a greater user base at any cost. Face
book is no longer original; it's essential the
same as Myspace, Friendster or the waste of
time of your choice.
The band, too, is out of touch with their
base — the greater university community.
Did you know that at some universities the
marching band embodies a physical and mu
sical sense of pride and integrity on behalf of
the university? A school like Stanford with a
Fundamental Standard should not be repre
sented by chaotic student impulses that can
be offensive or even illegal, litis is Stanford.
Can't we do it in style?
Too Much Attention
1 can't be the only one annoyed with how
much coverage The Daily gives to the band
debacle or Facebook changes, especially
given the global war, global warming, geno
cide or the latest global crisis du jour. I'm
sorry, but Facebook going public should
never be front page news. For shame. Daily.
However, I also see the hypocrisy in writ
ing an entire column on the topic and con
cluding that the topic has received too much
attention.Trust me; it's the crux of a recently
discovered low self-esteem complex that 1
just developed. Shoot.
