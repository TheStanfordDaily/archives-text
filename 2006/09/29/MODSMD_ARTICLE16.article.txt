## A 						liberal's defense of Joe Lieberman 
### STUART BAIMEL 
Possibly the biggest piece of political news
this summer was the narrow defeat of three
term incumbent Joe Lieberman in the Con
necticut Democratic primary for the Senate by
the little-known and completely inexperi
enced (although very wealthy) Ned Lament.
Since then. Lamont has. for the most part, be
come the new darling of the Democratic Party,
while Lieberman daringly announced that he
would run an independent campaign under
the banner of "Connecticut tor Lieberman.
lhe battle between Lamont and Lieberman
will continue to divide voters until Election
Day.
How quickly things change in politics.
Less than six years ago, former Vice Presi
dent Al Gore was lauded for selecting
Lieberman as his running mate, because he
was considered a strong moral voice and
steady Democrat. But memories are short,
and Lieberman finds himself without the
support of his party in his campaign to stay in
the Senate for another six years.
'ITie devastating charge slapped against
Lieberman was that he was a "conservative,
and with left-leaning Democratic primary vot
ers looking to take out their anger concerning
the Iraq War on someone, Lieberman was a
tangible target. The reactionary Hogging com
munity was happy to help, with sites like
MyDD and DailyKos posting snippet after
snippet of random article, free from journalistic
constraint.condemning Lieberman for his sup
port for the war. The infamous alleged "kiss"
between Senator Lieberman and President
Bush was the most prominent image of the

campaign, posted without any context at all.
And as they hoped. Lieberman was felled
52-48 in a race that surprised many, but not this
editorial writer. For such an intelligent, articu
late politician, he had been badly misrepresent
ed in the press (especially the so-called "new
media") and as John McC 'ain understands very
well, the press is everything in politics today.
ITiis misrepresentation by various ele
ments of the "new media" becomes clear; a
closer examination of Lieberman's record re
veals that he is hardly the conservative oppo
nents make him out to be.The Americans for
Democratic Action, a well-respected liberal
group, gives Lieberman a 76 lifetime rating,
hardly the most "conservative" of Democrats,
and more liberal than any Republican. 1 le has
voted Democratic on most, if not all. the
major issues, including stem-cell research,
women's privacy issues. I le also voted against
Republican grandstanding issues like tlag
desecration and the same-sex marriage
amendment. Similarly, he was against Alito
for Supreme Court Justice, and is a longtime
veteran of civil rights campaigns. Lastly, in
2(X)3 and 2(K)4 he earned a sterling 0% from
the Christian Coalition.
Hut to the Democratic primary voters and
Ned Lamont's puppeteers, Joe Lieberman's
long years of service to the I )emocratie Party
and the United States of America were
meaningless because he supported the war. I
agree; the war is a grave issue and Lieber
man's nearly-unconditional support for the
war is disconcerting. But what concerns me is
that "the war" has become the litmus test for
Democratic politicians, or at least the ones
that can be challenged. California's Dianne

Feinstein and New York's Hillary Clinton,
both steadfast supporters of the war, are too
imposing for either of them to have faced a
substantial primary challenge along similar
lines. Let's be frank; a pure antiwar stance
can't win anything outside of the West Coast
and New England; it is clear that the "two
coasts" strategy hasn't worked for the De
mocrats in the past.
Joe Lieberman's years of service to the
party cannot, and should not. be obscured by
his support for a war that most of the 44 Sen
ate Democrats have yet to formally oppose.
These same blogging communities are sup
porting candidates like Claire McCaskill and
John Tester, who certainly do not oppose the
war. Not a single Senator has called for the im
mediate pullout of all troops; the Kerry-Fein
gold axis advocates pullout only after certain
conditions have been met (and as of press
time, it is clear that none of them have). The
war will not be solved simply by an immediate
pullout of all troops, and Joe Lieberman rec
ognizes that.
Lieberman, if he wins in November, has
the chance to be a truly independent politi
cian. rising above the political fray and harsh
bipartisanship that has characterized Con
gress in recent years.The polls seem to indi
cate that he will win. as Republicans and
moderate Democrats flock to his campaign
for a more centrist liberalism, the kind that
Bill Clinton championed back in the day. The
Senate will be better for it.
