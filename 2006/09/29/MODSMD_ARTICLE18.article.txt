## MEN'S WATER POLO Water polo looking for offense at UCLA No. 6 Stanford frits to end three-game losing streak against No. 3 Bruins 
### ANDREW SHEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's water polo team will travel to
Pasadena. Calif, on Saturday for the most pivotal game of
the young season. The No. 6 Cardinal will face the No. 3
UCLA Bruins tor the second time this year after losing to
them earlier this season in the NorCal Tournament.
The Cardinal (5-3) carry the burden of a three-game los
ing streak into the contest after starting out a perfect 5-0.
The last time the two teams met, UCLA (5-1) came out
on top 7-6 in the third place game of the NorCal Tourna
ment.
In that game. Stanford showed the ability to contain
UCLA's big goal-scorers.The Cardinal limited UCLA's top
two scorers. Logan Powell and Kristo Sbutega.to one goal
in the first meeting. Instead, it was the Bruins' third scoring
option.Graut Zider. who hurt the Cardinal by notching two
goals. UCLA also made good use of Scott Davidson, who
scored two of his four goals in the season during the match.
The concern for Stanford during its recent struggles has
been the offense. They have had trouble scoring on UCLA
goaltender Will Didinger. who sports a four-goal against av
erage for the season. In his last match against Stanford, he
recorded seven saves, while backup goalie,sophomore Jim
mie Sandman, helped the Bruin cause as well, stopping 10
shots.
If Stanford is to succeed against the Bruins, the team
needs senior captains Tyler Drake and JJ Carton, sopho
more and top scorer Will Hindle-Katel.and freshmen twins
Janson and Drac Wigo to produce offensively. Additional
ly, freshman Sage Wright, whom Drake described as "dis
playing his talents on both sides of the pool" could be an X
factor.
What is known for certain is that this game is as close to
a "must-win" regular season contest as possible. With a
match against No. 2 Cal on the road looming next week, a
young Stanford squad has the opportunity to prove it can
get back to the championship game, and win it.
