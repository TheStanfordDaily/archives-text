2-0 defeat, respectively. Prior to their
loss against the Aztecs, UC-Berkeley
enjoyed a five-game winning streak. C al
will bring a 3-2 home record to Satur
day's game.

lar homestand in which the squad de
feated San Diego State 2-1, ending a
winless streak at home dating back to
Sept. 25. 2005 during which the team s
home record was 0-6-2. Stanford then
