# FALSE START
## Football tries to get on the winning path this weekend against UCLA Card try to avenge devestating loss of 2005, earn first win of 2006 at Rose Bowl 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
It was one of the most crushing memories
of a generally frustrating 2005 season: UCLA
marching down the field again and again and
again in the fourth quarter to overcome a 21-
3 Stanford lead — and eventually score the
game winning touchdown in overtime.
Nearly a year later, it seems the momen
tum from that game hasn't changed. Since
that stunning loss, Stanford (0-4,0-2 Pac-10)
has gone just 1-8, including a winless start to
the 2006 campaign.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal head to the Rose
Bowl to take on the Bruins (2-1,0-1) in hopes
of pulling out of a skid that has lasted over a
span of two seasons. But. given the numbers
each team has put up this season and the re
cent history of the matchup, a Stanford win
on Saturday would be as shocking as UCLA's
comeback last season.
"1 think that [last year's loss to UCLA]
will be a little extra motivation," said senior
defensive end Chris Horn, during a Tuesday
press conference. "We felt we had last year's
game; we were up and we just let the oppor
tunity slip away. On defense, it was tough. We

did everything we could; we just couldn't de
fend their offense. I've never been involved
in anything that drastic. It's a game of mo
mentum, and they just got it; we could just
never take it back."
As bad as the Stanford defense was in that
fateful fourth quarter in 2005, it has been
worse this season. The Cardinal enter tomor
row's action ranked last in NCAA Division-I
in rush defense (312.0 yards per game) and
third down defense (opponents converting
64.6 percent of third downs) and 115 th in
scoring defense (39.0 points per game).
"We can contain [UCLA] by executing
our defense — all eleven guys," Stanford
coach Walt Harris said. "It sounds real sim
ple, but they have eleven guys on the other
side of the ball that are going to try to keep us
from doing that. We are still our own woist
enemy."
The Cardinal's defensive struggles are
good news for the Bruins, who are trying to
bounce back after blowing a big lead of their
own in a 29-19 loss to Washington last week
end. UCLA led 16-0 early in the game and
19-14 entering the fourth quarter, but the
Huskies rallied with a pair of touchdowns
late in the quarter to match their combined
Pac-10 win total of the last two seasons.
The final Washington score came on an in
terception return, when UCLA quarterback
Ben Olson threw his third pick of the season.

577 yards and five touchdowns.
Olson transferred to UCLA from
BYU after his freshman season and
spent nearly all of last season on the
bench behind now-graduated Drew
Olson (no relation). This season he
led the Bruins to big wins over Utah
and Rice before making the late mis
take against Washington.
UCLA's biggest offensive
weapon has been running back Chris
Markey. who is averaging 120.0 yards
per game. Markey, like Olson, is in his
first year as a starter. Following the
2005 season, the Bruins lost their All
American running back Maurice
Jones-Drew to the NI L.
Along with Olson and Jones-
Drew, the Bruins have been toreed to
find replacements for other key
members of their 2005 squad.
Among the additional starters lost to
graduation were star tight end
Marcedes Lewis, linebacker Spencer
Havner and four year starter safety
Jarrad Page.
Although the Bruins lost their
two leading tacklers from last season
in I lavner and Page. 1 larris says that
the defense has actually improved.
"I think the biggest difference in
their team is how they play on de
fense," he said. "They have lettermen
in every position playing that have
moved ahead. They are playing good
on defense, and we will have a real
challenge. We have to get it going; we
have to get some positive, successful

things happening early."
Getting the offense going early
has been a struggle for the Cardinal
this season. While the Stanford de
fense has dominated the negative
headlines, the offensive effort in last
week's 36-10 loss to Washington
State was just as troubling.
The Card put up just two yards
and held the ball for 1:39 during the
first quarter. Their lone touchdown
came in the fourth, when the out
come of the game had been already
decided.
"[The offensive struggles are
from] a combination of things: too
long of yardage, not good enough pro
tection holding the ball, and we've
had way too many sacks on the ball."
I larris said. "Our quarterback [Trent
Edwards) has got to do better."
While a bowl already seems out of
the question for the Card, which
would require six wins in their final
eight games, a win tomorrow would
at least move the team in the right di
rection.
"Obviously, we haven't per
formed the way we have wanted, but
we have the sense we have to get bet
ter; and we are doing everything we
can to get better," Horn said."l think
we are real motivated on getting
back into the winning mentality."
The Cardinal will take the field at
7:15 pm tomorrow in front of a na
tional television audience. The game
will be carried live on Fox Sports
Net.

fend their offense. I've never been involved
in anything that drastic. It's a game of mo
mentum, and they just got it; we could just
never take it back."
As bad as the Stanford defense was in that
fateful fourth quarter in 2005, it has been
worse this season. The Cardinal enter tomor
row's action ranked last in NCAA Division-I
in rush defense (312.0 yards per game) and
third down defense (opponents converting
64.6 percent of third downs) and 115 th in
scoring defense (39.0 points per game).
"We can contain [UCLA] by executing
our defense — all eleven guys," Stanford
coach Walt Harris said. "It sounds real sim
ple, but they have eleven guys on the other
side of the ball that are going to try to keep us
from doing that. We are still our own woist
enemy."
The Cardinal's defensive struggles are
good news for the Bruins, who are trying to
bounce back after blowing a big lead of their
own in a 29-19 loss to Washington last week
end. UCLA led 16-0 early in the game and
19-14 entering the fourth quarter, but the
Huskies rallied with a pair of touchdowns
late in the quarter to match their combined
Pac-10 win total of the last two seasons.
The final Washington score came on an in
terception return, when UCLA quarterback
Ben Olson threw his third pick of the season.

three, starts as a Bruin, throwing for
577 yards and five touchdowns.
Olson transferred to UCLA from
BYU after his freshman season and
spent nearly all of last season on the
bench behind now-graduated Drew
Olson (no relation). This season he
led the Bruins to big wins over Utah
and Rice before making the late mis
take against Washington.
UCLA's biggest offensive
weapon has been running back Chris
Markey. who is averaging 120.0 yards
per game. Markey, like Olson, is in his
first year as a starter. Following the
2005 season, the Bruins lost their All
American running back Maurice
Jones-Drew to the NI L.
Along with Olson and Jones-
Drew, the Bruins have been toreed to
find replacements for other key
members of their 2005 squad.
Among the additional starters lost to
graduation were star tight end
Marcedes Lewis, linebacker Spencer
Havner and four year starter safety
Jarrad Page.
Although the Bruins lost their
two leading tacklers from last season
in I lavner and Page. 1 larris says that
the defense has actually improved.
"I think the biggest difference in
their team is how they play on de
fense," he said. "They have lettermen
in every position playing that have
moved ahead. They are playing good
on defense, and we will have a real
challenge. We have to get it going; we
have to get some positive, successful

things happening early."
Getting the offense going early
has been a struggle for the Cardinal
this season. While the Stanford de
fense has dominated the negative
headlines, the offensive effort in last
week's 36-10 loss to Washington
State was just as troubling.
The Card put up just two yards
and held the ball for 1:39 during the
first quarter. Their lone touchdown
came in the fourth, when the out
come of the game had been already
decided.
"[The offensive struggles are
from] a combination of things: too
long of yardage, not good enough pro
tection holding the ball, and we've
had way too many sacks on the ball."
I larris said. "Our quarterback [Trent
Edwards) has got to do better."
While a bowl already seems out of
the question for the Card, which
would require six wins in their final
eight games, a win tomorrow would
at least move the team in the right di
rection.
"Obviously, we haven't per
formed the way we have wanted, but
we have the sense we have to get bet
ter; and we are doing everything we
can to get better," Horn said."l think
we are real motivated on getting
back into the winning mentality."
The Cardinal will take the field at
7:15 pm tomorrow in front of a na
tional television audience. The game
will be carried live on Fox Sports
Net.
