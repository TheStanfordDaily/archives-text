# FALSE START
## Football tries to get on the winning path this weekend against UCLA Card try to avenge devestating loss of 2005, earn first win of 2006 at Rose Bowl 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
It was one of the most crushing memories
of a generally frustrating 2005 season: UCLA
marching down the field again and again and
again in the fourth quarter to overcome a 21-
3 Stanford lead — and eventually score the
game winning touchdown in overtime.
Nearly a year later, it seems the momen
tum from that game hasn't changed. Since
that stunning loss, Stanford (0-4,0-2 Pac-10)
has gone just 1-8, including a winless start to
the 2006 campaign.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal head to the Rose
Bowl to take on the Bruins (2-1,0-1) in hopes
of pulling out of a skid that has lasted over a
span of two seasons. But. given the numbers
each team has put up this season and the re
cent history of the matchup, a Stanford win
on Saturday would be as shocking as UCLA's
comeback last season.
"1 think that [last year's loss to UCLA]
will be a little extra motivation," said senior
defensive end Chris Horn, during a Tuesday
press conference. "We felt we had last year's
game; we were up and we just let the oppor
tunity slip away. On defense, it was tough. We

did everything we could; we just couldn't de
fend their offense. I've never been involved
in anything that drastic. It's a game of mo
mentum, and they just got it; we could just
never take it back."
As bad as the Stanford defense was in that
fateful fourth quarter in 2005, it has been
worse this season. The Cardinal enter tomor
row's action ranked last in NCAA Division-I
in rush defense (312.0 yards per game) and
third down defense (opponents converting
64.6 percent of third downs) and 115 th in
scoring defense (39.0 points per game).
"We can contain [UCLA] by executing
our defense — all eleven guys," Stanford
coach Walt Harris said. "It sounds real sim
ple, but they have eleven guys on the other
side of the ball that are going to try to keep us
from doing that. We are still our own woist
enemy."
The Cardinal's defensive struggles are
good news for the Bruins, who are trying to
bounce back after blowing a big lead of their
own in a 29-19 loss to Washington last week
end. UCLA led 16-0 early in the game and
19-14 entering the fourth quarter, but the
Huskies rallied with a pair of touchdowns
late in the quarter to match their combined
Pac-10 win total of the last two seasons.
The final Washington score came on an in
terception return, when UCLA quarterback
Ben Olson threw his third pick of the season.
Olson has been solid under center in his first

of the 2006 season.

Senior quarterback Trent Edwards has been forced to rely on the youth around him due to a rash of injuries to key offensive players. The Los
Gatos, Calif, native credits his upbringing for his generally positive outlook on the season.
