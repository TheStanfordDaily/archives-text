## Some nightmares are worth repeating 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION MOVIE GOD 
A brand new edition of the
original "A Nightmare on Elm
Street" was released on DVD
Irom Infinil'ilm this week. If you
can't find anything to watch this
weekend, consider revisiting Wes

Craven's 80s horror classic.

"A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984)

I'm still not sure why. hut a friend and I
ended lip watching the horror Hick 'The
Covenant'.' last week. Preceding the film
was the usual lineup of trailers for movies
leveling in the brutal torture of teenagers.
I hey included. "The Texas Chainsaw Mas
sacre: The Beginning" and some Sarah
Michelle Cellar vehicle called The Return." <
I'm certainly not averse to borror movies.
I did. after all. pay money to watch "Thqgf
Covenant." But 1 am getting increasingly
frustrated with the current crop of horror
films that measure creativity by how graph
ic and tasteless a death scene can be. Thank
fully. this week's Infinil'ilm edition of "A
Nightmare on Elm Street" reminds us that a

him s premise and characters can he a
source of creativity also.
Writer-director Wes Craven got the idea
for "A Nightmare on Elni Street" from an
LA. limes article concerning Taiwanese
children who died in their sleep after experi
encing horrible nightmares. Craven's con
cept of a disfigured child-killer murdering
teenagers in their sleep was overlooked by
most Hollywood studios. However, a fledg
ling New Line Cinema liked the director's
litch and helped finance the movie. The
ilm and its numerous sequels were so suc
cessful that New Line Cinema soon became
known as "the studio that Freddy Krueger
built."
The reasons for the film's success are ob
vious. Us conceit cleverly allows for super
natural elements not found in rival horror
franchises like "Friday the 13th" or "Hal
loween." The often-blurry division between
dreams and reality is an ingenious plot de
vice that heightens the film's tension. Like
wise. the notion that the film's characters
are vulnerable when dreaming is scary be
cause it destroys our belief that sleep pro
vides respite from our fears.
Craven complements this wonderful
premise with a gritty, almost mundane at
mosphere seldom found in contemporary
horror movies. The film's main character, in
particular, is a far cry from the spoiled,
good-looking characters found in films like

Dear Frosh,
Welcome to what will be the highlight of your lives. Many of you have
no doubt watched movies like "Old School" and "Animal House" in
order to get an idea of what to expect at college. By this point, you have
probably discovered that most, if not all, of the stereotypes promoted in
those mindless teen flicks are absolutely true.
You've been at Stanford for over a week now, and you've undoubt
edly come across that muscular meat-head destined for a frat or that ma
terialistic girl with the giant bug-like sunglasses who only needs a few
drinks before she gets extra friendly. The thing is that while the movies
you watched to prep yourself for the college experience were all exag
gerated for the sake of humor, they do have a grain of truth in them.
There are guys like Frank the Tank. There are girls like Tara Reid who'll
drop their knickers just to say hello. There are nerds like Booger from
"Revenge of the Nerds" (FYI: they're mostly in the Computer Science
department). You will run into just about every stereotype you've ever
seen in a movie.
But hold on a second. You're probably asking yourself, "What makes
people worth meeting if they're just like a character from a movie?"
Great question. One of the best parts of Stanford is that while it may be
true that people can fall into certain stereotypes, there's usually some
thing special about each one that will surprise you. That "Frank the
Tank" guy might be interested in bone marrow cancer research and
plans on being a pediatrician someday. That "Tara Reid" character
might start a non-profit to help kids in Tanzania who suffer from AIDS.
That "Booger" nerd might invent the next Facebook. You just don't
know until you stretch out your hand and say. "Hello, I'm ."
So don't judge people by what you see in movies. Everyone at Stanford
got in because they deserve to be here — they've all got some special
quality that makes them worth knowing. So get off your lazy bums, turn
off the DVD player and get to meeting people. You'll be surprised by
who you'll meet.

A brand new edition of the
original "A Nightmare on Elm
Street" was released on DVD
Irom Infinil'ilm this week. If you
can't find anything to watch this
weekend, consider revisiting Wes

Craven's 80s horror classic.

"A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984)

I'm still not sure why. hut a friend and I
ended lip watching the horror Hick 'The
Covenant'.' last week. Preceding the film
was the usual lineup of trailers for movies
leveling in the brutal torture of teenagers.
I hey included. "The Texas Chainsaw Mas
sacre: The Beginning" and some Sarah
Michelle Cellar vehicle called The Return." <
I'm certainly not averse to borror movies.
I did. after all. pay money to watch "Thqgf
Covenant." But 1 am getting increasingly
frustrated with the current crop of horror
films that measure creativity by how graph
ic and tasteless a death scene can be. Thank
fully. this week's Infinil'ilm edition of "A
Nightmare on Elm Street" reminds us that a

him s premise and characters can he a
source of creativity also.
Writer-director Wes Craven got the idea
for "A Nightmare on Elni Street" from an
LA. limes article concerning Taiwanese
children who died in their sleep after experi
encing horrible nightmares. Craven's con
cept of a disfigured child-killer murdering
teenagers in their sleep was overlooked by
most Hollywood studios. However, a fledg
ling New Line Cinema liked the director's
litch and helped finance the movie. The
ilm and its numerous sequels were so suc
cessful that New Line Cinema soon became
known as "the studio that Freddy Krueger
built."
The reasons for the film's success are ob
vious. Us conceit cleverly allows for super
natural elements not found in rival horror
franchises like "Friday the 13th" or "Hal
loween." The often-blurry division between
dreams and reality is an ingenious plot de
vice that heightens the film's tension. Like
wise. the notion that the film's characters
are vulnerable when dreaming is scary be
cause it destroys our belief that sleep pro
vides respite from our fears.
Craven complements this wonderful
premise with a gritty, almost mundane at
mosphere seldom found in contemporary
horror movies. The film's main character, in
particular, is a far cry from the spoiled,
good-looking characters found in films like

Dear Frosh,
Welcome to what will be the highlight of your lives. Many of you have
no doubt watched movies like "Old School" and "Animal House" in
order to get an idea of what to expect at college. By this point, you have
probably discovered that most, if not all, of the stereotypes promoted in
those mindless teen flicks are absolutely true.
You've been at Stanford for over a week now, and you've undoubt
edly come across that muscular meat-head destined for a frat or that ma
terialistic girl with the giant bug-like sunglasses who only needs a few
drinks before she gets extra friendly. The thing is that while the movies
you watched to prep yourself for the college experience were all exag
gerated for the sake of humor, they do have a grain of truth in them.
There are guys like Frank the Tank. There are girls like Tara Reid who'll
drop their knickers just to say hello. There are nerds like Booger from
"Revenge of the Nerds" (FYI: they're mostly in the Computer Science
department). You will run into just about every stereotype you've ever
seen in a movie.
But hold on a second. You're probably asking yourself, "What makes
people worth meeting if they're just like a character from a movie?"
Great question. One of the best parts of Stanford is that while it may be
true that people can fall into certain stereotypes, there's usually some
thing special about each one that will surprise you. That "Frank the
Tank" guy might be interested in bone marrow cancer research and
plans on being a pediatrician someday. That "Tara Reid" character
might start a non-profit to help kids in Tanzania who suffer from AIDS.
That "Booger" nerd might invent the next Facebook. You just don't
know until you stretch out your hand and say. "Hello, I'm ."
So don't judge people by what you see in movies. Everyone at Stanford
got in because they deserve to be here — they've all got some special
quality that makes them worth knowing. So get off your lazy bums, turn
off the DVD player and get to meeting people. You'll be surprised by
who you'll meet.
