### BETSY CONGDON BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION ALUMNI ... OH WAIT 
Cactus Garden
112 Little known but pretty tool. Intact.
Betsy discovered the cactus garden on a
quest lor the Stanford Shopping Vlall her
L freshman year. (Brendan's never seen it.
but he approves ol the concept.)

fMRI at Stanford
Lucas Center
112 They pay you to sit in an MRI machine for a lew 1
I hours and then give you a few pictures of your brain 1
1/ as a bonus. If you don't like crazy sounding
L machines, you can still get paid to participate in I
L psych experiments. Check out the Psychology M
Bk Department Website for more.

W I know Stern Cyber Cafe is closer to
I Froshcondido (thank you Thorn Massey for this 1
\ lovely phrase), but seriously. Lag Late Night is J
V just better. Besides, seeing West Campus at A
least once during your freshman year is a
good thing.

Lake Lag at Night
I Go out, past the Frats and far from 1
I the road. Look up and enjoy. We are I

THE DISH

The Dish at Midnight
W Watch the barbwire. Believe us, it's a lot more l
I to hike up there when you can't even see where you're 1
I going. A definite plus is il you have a friend who s J
willing to swing about the rafters like a monkey..

Steam Tunnels
A Stanford tradition, enough said. V
Tell your RA / upperclassmen in your
H dorm to take you. Maybe even play laser M
tag if you can come across the proper
Bk equipment.

Climbing Wall
¥ It's in Arrillaga ... the Rcc. Center 1
one. Oh yeah Stanford has a climbing
I wall. It's free for Stanford students to get J
L in. Open from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Mon- A
