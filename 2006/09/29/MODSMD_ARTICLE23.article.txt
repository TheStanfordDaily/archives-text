## Apparently, Stanford does have a music scene! 
### BRIA LONG INTERMISSION UNDERGROUND EXPERT 
THIS IS THE YEAR...
for new bands at Stanford
The arts are getting a huge
facelift, and SCN — the
Stanford Concert Network
(SCN) — is totally revamp
ing their events by bringing
in new outside bands twice
a month. They 're also coor
dinating with the Student
Organizing Committee for
the Arts (SOCA) to show
case student bands around
campus.
First, SCN is starting off
with the new 750 Concert
Series, featuring off-cam
pus artists at the 750 twice
a month. Although you do
have to be 21+ to drink, ad
mission is free and the

bands are going to be fantastic. Kicking off the
series on Oct. 12 is John Vandersiice and Pat
tern is Movement from 8-10 p.m. Vandersiice,
formerly of MK Ultra, uses analog equipment
to produce a rawer sound, similar to that of
Neutral Milk Hotel. A contributing producer

on the last Spoon album, "Gimme Fiction,"
he'll also be touring throughout the UK and
Europe this fall and spring. Playing with Van-

derslice is Pattern is Movement, an indie rock
band from Pennsylvania. You can check them
both out at www.johnvandershce.com and
www.patternismovement.com. This is defi
nitely a must-see show.
The 750 Concert Series and the CoHo Se

ries will rotate each week, so there will be a
concert to attend every Thursday night. The
CoHo Series, co-sponsored by SCN, SOCA
and Absolute Fun, will continue to feature
student bands, both undergraduate and grad
uate. Additionally, SCN and SOCA are also
starting up an acoustic series, Moontunes, at
Moonbeans Coffee. To top it all off, Stanford
Institute for Creativity in the Arts (SICA),
via the new leadership of

Megan Miller, has creat-

Ed an exteasive stu
dent arts Web site
with a full calendar

of these events. Fi
nally, it's all coming
together.
You, yes you, pseu-

do-rockstar, you can

now play at venues on

campus and get it advertised

on a central arts calendar accessible to en- ™
tire student body. Last year's CoHo Series'
performers included longtime favorites The
Spins, the amazing rapping skills of KJFlay,
sophomore bands such as Dirty Blonde, as well
as amazing newcomers Natalie Knutsen and
Stephanie Milliard. Stanford Soundtrack
alumni included Chris Babson, June Star, Lilly
Wolfson. No Shoes Apply and Riot Squad.

Opening the show next Thursday, Oct. 5 at the
CoHo at Is Jon Drucker, a junior on piano and <
vocals. From 7:30 on, the Sandy Greenfield
band, who was also recently featured on the *
2006 Stanford Soundtrack with their single <
"Hole in the Sun," will perform a full set. And
if you missed the Stanford Soundtrack at last
year's An Art Affair, you can pick it up at the (
series. For free. No, really.
If you're interested in playing for Moon
tunes or the CoHo Series, shoot an e-mail to <
