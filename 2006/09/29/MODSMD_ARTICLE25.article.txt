## Forget the Stanford Store... dress right Lookin' good, feelin' good 
### TAM VO JOBLESS I-MISSION ALUMNA 
Put down the

Stanford

sweat-

shirt.

Back

away

from the

Nalg en e

(some polycar-

bonate plastics used

by the company may mix

chemicals into your drink, though Nalgene de
nies it). Remove that red lanyard nametag. Oh
wait, you took that off last week. I can still tell
that you're a froshie, though. 1 can smell you
from 400 miles away in LA — have you done
your laundry yet?
We'll go top to bottom, like that kindergarten
jingle/exercise that went "Heads, shoulders,
knees and toes." Or something like that.

Remember: Hair Grows

In Europe, people (not just youngsters, but
even plumbers and the trash guys) gallivant
around with crazy rat-tail braided mullets

with bleach spots interspersed through
out the whole "Edward Scissorhands

got Roid Rage" affair. It honestly
looks like someone took a piss on
your head while you were passed i

out on the floor.

You do not have to do the same,

intrepid Reader, but you

should trade in your boring

bobs and preppy crew cuts
for something better: a
haircut from Edge Salon, a
refreshing alternative to
the yuppie cuts that Palo
Alto is famous for. Don't
feel like paying $100 to have

some woman trim 1/4 of an 1
inch of your hair but don't 1
want to get butchered at
Stanford Hair or Hair lnterna-

tional for 25 bucks? For $40-$5O, Sang, a perky,
ridiculously talented stylist at Edge Hair In
dustries (250 University Ave., Suite 103,
phone: 650.462.1000), will make you feel at
home and give you a haircut that suits you,
whether you aspire to have crazy hip, anime
style hair, or a versatile shag that flatters your
uniquely shaped face. Haircuts do not have to
be ordeals. The pain is over.
Itching for a change of color? Get thee to Faux
Salon (378 E. Campbell Ave, Campbell,
phone: 408.378.3289) and ask for Liz. From a
fauxhawk you can change from business-style
to a party in five minutes to an asymmetrical
layered look that's bursting with riotous fuch
sia streaks, Liz does it all. I would even send a
puppy to her, if I had one — it would return
much cooler-looking. Tell her I sent you.
Hats: Not enough people at Stanford realize
the power of an excellent chapeau. It can be
the finishing touch to an outfit, or save you an
extra five minutes of brushing your hair.
No more trucker hats, okay? They're very
2002, when you were all still in middle school.
This fall, try out a newsboy cap in tweed or her
ringbone, or a jewel-toned tam (not me, the
Scottish version), which is a loose-fitting knit
cap. For guys, dress up a dark button down
shirt and nice slacks with a casual fedora. As a
rule of thumb, lighter fabrics during the day,
darker and more vivid ones at night. Rich
browns, burgundies, plums, royal blues and
jade greens — you have enough cardinal in
your wardrobe.

Making the curve:
Stanford students, you

should be a little

more adventur
ous in your dress.
It usually results
in more adven
tures overall. It's
a chance to try
something new
without getting

an "F" for at
tempting to
write a bril
liant paper in
Wing Dings.
You know,
this font:

Look at yourself in the mirror. :]
Do your clothes fit properly? Wfl
Too loose, and you'll look like F fl
you crapped your pants or idol
ize the boho fug bag lady style fl
of Mary-Kate Olsen. Too tight,
and you'll get a rash because 1
your skin can't breathe.
I'm not joking: Try explaining that to 1
the next person you hook up with. fl
"Um, my jeans are too tight."
Nothing says "mood killer" like pants I
that refuse to come off, not on moral H
grounds, but due to technical difl'icul- fl
ties.
Tired of things not fitting properly? To
prevent your favorite jeans from fraying at
the bottom while eating your feet and your
shirts from swallowing you alive, bike to De
signer's Tailoring (2119 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, phone: 650.321.1570), the best and most
affordable in the area. This tiny, humble .
shop on El Camino is run by amazing own- J*
ers who can work magic on anything, even
shoes. As an undergrad, I visited the shop any
time I needed alterations ASAP, and I was
never let down in four years.

Leggings are not pants:
They are one baby-step away from leggings
with stirrups and bows, which Urban Outfit-

ters has courteously brought back from
the pits of hell for the undiscerning
trendy shopper. No high-waters and no
pants that make your shoes invisible.

On the other end of the spectrum,
just say no to pantsuits/jumpsuits un
less you're in the ABF Drumz
(www.abfdrumz.com) section of The
Stanford Band and can get away with
looking that hot. Not even Scarlett
Johansson can do it — see
www.gofugyourself.com for damning
evidence.

Formal Shorts:
Just because you think you can get away with
it doesn't mean you should, even if your new
party shorts come in herringbone or retro
plaid. Sweet Jesus, do not pair them with leg
gings or tights, I beseech you.
Tiny, Tiny Miniskirts:
Are you trying to be like every drunk celebrity
in training to flash your crotch to the world?
Just try going around naked, it saves you trou
blesome zippers and buttons. Cross the legs.
Manpris:
I present to you Europe's favorite excuse for a
half-assed article of clothing. They're not cu
lottes or capris, often with toggles at the bot
tom for who-knows-what. They go past your
knees but barely and rarely graze the ankles. In
a word. Awkward with a capital "A." Avail

able in all sorts of crazy
hMgagtf fabrics from Teflon-
H coaled polyester/nylon
hybrids to denim (with
cargo pockets!), you
v too, Freshman, can
pretend to be totally
I foreign and awkward.
When you can't afford pants
but you're too cool for
I shorts...it's Manpris! Man
pris!
wL Along the same lines, boys,
V avoid wearing too-short
B khaki cargo shorts with
white crew socks pulled up
high. You don't go to a school
where the ratio of men to women
is 10 to 1 (Harvey Mudd, Cal
tech, MIT). You still have a
112" chance at happiness.
* Camouflage Prints:
No, you are not the lost fifth member of the
artist formerly known as Destiny's Child.
Steve Irwin never wore any camo, and
he...well, we all miss him but we don't miss
Destiny's Child, now do
we?

Overalls:

Maybe they were hot in middle school and
high school, you know, with a tank top that
showed off your midriff and a hint of skin.
However, this may be The Farm, but you, my
friend, are not Fanner John or Jane.
Message Tees:
Irony is dead. Again. Thanks to you, and your
clever t-shirt that was funny the first time, an
noying forever and ever after. If "B is for Bi
atch," don't say I didn't warn you when some-



one clocks you in the face for your "Wish you were Beer!" or intentionally mis
-spelled "Colege" tee. "More Cowbell" is not cool anymore. Just. Stop. Now.
Boxer Briefs:
Please do your freshman dorm a favor and don't just wander around in just
your ratty ol' boxers. Yes, you feel so liberated and free (woo, college!), but it's
dangerous in both standing and sitting positions. It's also real awkward while
you're brushing your teeth (and neither person wants to spit out their tooth
paste first for fear of being labeled "unhygienic" by the other). One word:
Balls. Keep the mouse in the house.
I'm tired and 1 just turned 22 on Wednesday. I'm still looking for jobs, and 1
can't even afford a mattress. Yes, that's right, I'm a recent Stanford grad and I
am sleeping on my floor. But I don't pretend leggings are pants, and I don't
have to live off ramen. So here's the secret: You want style? Go to a co-op like
jKairos (586 Mayfield) and hit up the Intermission Office (Storke Publications
\ Building. Suite 101) and observe, young grasshopper, how real style can't be
* purchased.
