## Frosh: Act out your urges 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Class of 2010, this one's for you. As The Daily's de
voted sexpert, 1 will do my best to give you the guidance
you need to make the next four years the hottest of your
life. Because honestly, college is the time to have sex.
And lots of it. Lots of deviant, shameful, completely in
appropriate sex with multiple partners —
• multaneously. It's time to commit the unspeakable acts
that have been rattluig around in your dirty little minds
siqce puberty. And not just because Stanford has a
lowafciute of herpes than the real world. Rather, it is
poliSpi§to harness the brilliance and creativity that got
yorHNfere for good (orgasms). In the words of many a
guidnpe counselor, don't let your potential go to
waste.
Here you are, set down in a swath of people your
age, flesh afire with hormonal impulses you have yet to

fully understand. Beds a plenty. Built-in moral

justification that anyone you randomly wake

I up next to is likely a refugee-saving, chess

I champion. Objectification therefore ceases

I to exist and all that is left is a vast field of

I play waiting to he sowed. Roxy understands

this can be intimidating... but take courage in
the fact that the vast majority of your possible

sex partners are naive virgins who wouldhave
no idea that what you're doing isn't a nulling

to write home about (or a Facebook not etas the
case may be). This benefits everyone involved.

I Faked orgasms and earnest ctmnilingua will most

certainly ensue. Guys will come out feelipg masterful
and girls satisfied with the fact that he gave it his best
shot ("Aw. he must really like me!"). Self esteems will
spike, ensuring increasingly ... decent /. sexual experi
ences in the future. Hell, by sophomore year, decent
might even get bumped up to adequate if you play your
cards right.
While low expectations are always a handy tool —
when it comes to shedding inhibitions Roxy says, "Go
big or go home." If only because "I had a threesome in
radical school" just doesn't have the same ring to it.
The idea of such a thing may have made you blush dur
ing your routine high school porn browse or snicker
among your tight-knit group of equally immature
friends. But you're in college now. where the humiliat
ing encounter of today will become the badass badge of
honor of tomorrow. A badge that will last you for the
rest of your natural love life. Gals, you casually drop
your threeway romp into any conversation in the next
4() years, and every man in the room will lose his ability
to focus on anything but you. Guys, you will be the envy
of your buddies, coworkers and all the complete
strangers they tell. Now that's networking.
One more thing to keep in mind. Those who judge...
are jealous. That's right. The friend that pooh-poohs
your penchant for handcuffs has a secret yearning for

whips and chains. Roommate embarrassed
