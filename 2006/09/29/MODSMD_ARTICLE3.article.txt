### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
On a Cardinal football squad devastat
ed by injuries and reeling from an 0-4 start,
it's hard not to notice one of the team's few
bright spots — senior quarterback Trent
Edwards. Surrounded by young and inex
perienced offensive players, and outscored
156-63 in the four games this season. Fid
wards entered the season an excellent Ni l.
prospect in the eyes of some football prog
nosticators. And while early season results
have dampened those predictions, lid
wards still sees opportunity rather than
hopelessness in the days ahead.
"Things obviously haven't gone as I had
anticipated the season going so far," Ed
wards said. "But I am a very positive per
son. I was raised to be that type of person
and I feel that's the kind of leader and play
er 1 am on this football team.There arc still

eight winnable football games on this
schedule and that's the mindset I'm in right
now."
Not that it's easy for the senior signal
caller to maintain his sunny disposition in
the face of the recent drubbings handed out
by the opposition. Edwards credits his
strong support network with helping him to
persevere through the rigors of yet another
difficult season.
"At times you get frustrated, but that's
where you have your family and friends to
support you." he said. "I'm getting weekly
emails and text messages and phone calls
continuing to support me and our team this
season, and that definitely helps when you
lose sight of that positive mindset."
This Saturday, Stanford will go on the
road to face UCLA at the Rose Bowl,
against whom the Cardinal have struggled
in recent years. In 2004 Edwards completed
24 of 4f> passes for 224 yards and three in

terceptions in a 21-0 effort, losing 21-0. In
light of last year's 30-27 overtime loss at
home — clearly among the most disheart
ening outcomes of the 2005 season — Ed
wards will look to change Stanford's for
tunes against the Bruins this weekend.
"I'd like to think it's provided inspira
tion. at least for me," Edwards said. "The
last time we played at the Rose Bowl was
probably the worst game I've ever played
in my life. That's sort of keeping me going
this week — I'm looking forward to going
back there and it's good to know that only
improvement can be made off of that."
Ilie Cardinal quarterback will certainly
have his work cut out for him. missing key
offensive contributors including senior
wide receivers Mark Bradford and Evan
Moore, still out with injuries, and senior
fullback Nick Frank, who was forced to re-
