# Edwards holding HIS HEAD HIGH
## "If we protect him, I don't think we can be stopped." TOBY GERHART, freshman running back 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
On a Cardinal football squad devastat
ed by injuries and reeling from an 0-4 start,
it's hard not to notice one of the team's few
bright spots — senior quarterback Trent
Edwards. Surrounded by young and inex
perienced offensive players, and outscored
156-63 in the four games this season. Fid
wards entered the season an excellent Ni l.
prospect in the eyes of some football prog
nosticators. And while early season results
have dampened those predictions, lid
wards still sees opportunity rather than
hopelessness in the days ahead.
"Things obviously haven't gone as I had
anticipated the season going so far," Ed
wards said. "But I am a very positive per
son. I was raised to be that type of person
and I feel that's the kind of leader and play
er 1 am on this football team.There arc still

eight winnable football games on this
schedule and that's the mindset I'm in right
now."
Not that it's easy for the senior signal
caller to maintain his sunny disposition in
the face of the recent drubbings handed out
by the opposition. Edwards credits his
strong support network with helping him to
persevere through the rigors of yet another
difficult season.
"At times you get frustrated, but that's
where you have your family and friends to
support you." he said. "I'm getting weekly
emails and text messages and phone calls
continuing to support me and our team this
season, and that definitely helps when you
lose sight of that positive mindset."
This Saturday, Stanford will go on the
road to face UCLA at the Rose Bowl,
against whom the Cardinal have struggled
in recent years. In 2004 Edwards completed
24 of 4f> passes for 224 yards and three in

terceptions in a 21-0 effort, losing 21-0. In
light of last year's 30-27 overtime loss at
home — clearly among the most disheart
ening outcomes of the 2005 season — Ed
wards will look to change Stanford's for
tunes against the Bruins this weekend.
"I'd like to think it's provided inspira
tion. at least for me," Edwards said. "The
last time we played at the Rose Bowl was
probably the worst game I've ever played
in my life. That's sort of keeping me going
this week — I'm looking forward to going
back there and it's good to know that only
improvement can be made off of that."
Ilie Cardinal quarterback will certainly
have his work cut out for him. missing key
offensive contributors including senior
wide receivers Mark Bradford and Evan
Moore, still out with injuries, and senior
fullback Nick Frank, who was forced to re-
tire from football because of a
spinal condition. In their place, the
Stanford offense will likely revolve
around such younger players as
true-freshman tailback Toby Ger
hart. Edwards said he believes he
has the experience to work well
with younger players.
"I've been in their position be
fore, being a young guy with not a
lot of experience playing in a Pac-1()
football game," Edwards said. "1
know the emotions I had and the
feelings 1 had. and it's enjoyable for
me to see those guys go through it
[and 1 can] be looking back on my
career and seeing the similarities.
Yes, 1 would like to have all those
guys healthy and playing, but 1 still
enjoy seeing those younger guys
out there."
Despite a moderately successful
season for Edwards individually,
including 842 yards passing, six
touchdowns and three intercep
tions, his team has struggled might
ily around him, especially in rush
ing offense and defense. The senior
has done his best to stay upbeat
and not get frustrated while some
of his younger teammates learn the
ropes.
"I don't know if it's being in a
leadership position, 1 think it's just
the kind of person I am — there's
no point in getting ticked off." Ed
wards said. "For the most part I'd
say that everyone on offense has a
very positive outlook, but there still
are guys that get frustrated or upset
sometimes.
"Being a leader you have to con
tinue to let them see you be positive.
[You have to] hold your head up and
continue to be in there watching just
as much film, maybe more, continue
to run just as hard during the sprints,
if not harder, and continue to exe
cute your game plan. 1 just need to
keep doing that everyday."
According to Edwards' team
mates. his approach is working.
"He's incredible," Gerhart said.
"If we protect him I don't think we
can be stopped. Nothing ever seems
to bother him — you couldn't tell if
he's having a good day or a bad day,
he's always so upbeat. He's a leader,
and that's something where 1 can
aspire to be like him."
