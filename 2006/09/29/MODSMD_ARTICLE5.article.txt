# Eight Men In
## 
### Chrisopher Anderson 
Although UCLA can spread it out with three receivers, in this instance they contained the UW pass rush
by sending only two men into patterns. With both backs and the tight end kept in to block, Olson (7)
had plenty of time to wait for Andrew Baumgartner (18) to get open. Olson threw a rope to Baumgartner, who
cut upfield for an extra seven yards on the 16-yard play. The drive ended with a field goal.
