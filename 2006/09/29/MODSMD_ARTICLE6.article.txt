## AROUND CAMPUS New brand at gas station lowers prices Owner swaps Chevron for Valero, citing better deal terms and more reliable supply lines 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Textbook fees and tuition rates are notorious for spiraling
higher every year, hut there's at least one place on campus
where prices have dropped, and at a spot you might least sus
pect: the gas pump.
John Wichs. owner of the campus gas station, switched sup
pliers this summer, moving to Valero after his contract expired
with Chevron, which owns the Texaco brand the station had
sported for years.
"I don't like Chevron." said Wichs, who has owned the sta
tion at the intersection of Campus Drive and Serra St. for 37
years. Valero, he said, offered better terms and a more reliable
supply line. And, most importantly, better prices. While prices
have been dropping in recent months —Wichs said prices are
down 60 cents from their peak over the summer—he said the
switch to Valero is partially responsible.
The difference in cost is partially a product of Valero's lesser
brand recognition, but also its perceived quality. Many drivers
peg Valero as a discount gasoline brand, whereas Texaco is seen
as a premium pump.
Jon Chang, a senior and also the owner of a brand new car,
said the tradeoff is worth it.
"Honestly,it saves me the cash," he said."lf I wanted, I could
drive a little further to the Shell on El Camino, but this is con
venient. I'm not worried about the quality."
There are already three other Valero gas stations in the area,
but Wichs said he isn't worried.To the contrary, half the people
who fill up at his station come from off campus, he added.
But whether future gas prices will rise or fall is anyone's
guess, Wichs said.
"The world situation has a lot to do with the prices," he said.
"Who knows what's going to happen in the world?"
