# Dance swings new section
## Freshmen nearly denied access, now sacrifice sleep to learn with master 
### CLAY BAVINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday morning, long before most Stanford stu
dents were awake, Richard Powers, counted.
"1...2...r0ck step," to guide 120 sleepy freshmen
through their first few measures of the waltz.
The early morning session of the wildly popular
Social Dances of North America nearly didn't happen
at all. Only one, twice-weekly afternoon lesson was
originally planned. But so many students registered
online over the summer, that bv the time thefresh
men —who are locked out of course registration on
Axess until meeting with their advisors —arrived on

campus, there were few spots left. But Powers, who has
taught at Stanford since 1992, would have none of it.
"Nobody should be shut out," said Powers, who is
considered one of the world's foremost experts on
American social dance and was selected by the Centen
nial Issue of Stanford Magazine as one of the Universi
ty's most notable graduates of its first century. "Though
I'm technically on sabbatical this year," creating a sec
ond section "is just the right thing to do," he added.
Year after year, social dance is one of the most pop
ular classes at Stanford. Senior Lisa Love, who is help
ing Powers this quarter as a female lead, said that al
though social dances have specific techniques, steps
and beats, "it isn't about following strict rules." The

class, she said, is instead focused on "making students
able to enjoy dancing," and putting the social aspect
into social dance.
Students learn more than just how to dance social
ly. too.
"Powers takes a lot of care to teach not only dance
techniques but also respect for your dance partners
and for the philosophy and history of social dance,"
said sophomore Chris 1 .in, who took the class last year.
For their part, yesterday's would-be waltzers were
happy to trade sleep for lessons with a master.
"If people are willing to wake up at 7 a.m. to come
to class," said freshman Sarah Golabek-Goldman,
"then it must be pretty popular."

Social Dances of North America, a perennial hit with students, filled up before freshmen had a chance to enroll. The instructor, Richard Powers, would have none of it.
