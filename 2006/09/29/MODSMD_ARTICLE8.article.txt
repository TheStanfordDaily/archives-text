President John Hennessy treated members
of the Stanford German Student Association
to a freewheeling, wide-ranging discussion at
the Graduate Community Center last night,
calling on Stanford students to consider going
abroad to the places less traveled, specifically
the emerging economic powers of Asia.
"You really have to go there to experience
it," Hennessy said of rapidly-developing India.
In an hour-long talk that touched on the Uni
versity's role in addressing diversity, technology
and globalization, Hennessy fielded questions
from about fifteen SGSA members and Ger
man members of the Stanford community.
On the subject of diversity, Hennessy said that
while the large pool of international students at
Stanford is already one of the Farm's highlights,
the campus is still looking for ways to increase its
non-American student population. One con
cern. however, is the discrepancy in standards of
living between countries. For instance, a student
from an upper middle class background in China
with a family income in the $30,(XX) range will
have no means to cover the tuition at an elite uni
versity in America. Hennessy said that Stanford
employs financial aid in an effort to reach out to
students from lower-income states.
On the opposite side of the international
student coin lays the issue of Stanford students
spending time abroad. On this issue, too, Hen
nessy called for innovations. He expressed his
hope that Stanford students would consider
studying abroad in emerging world cities as op
posed traditional destinations like Rome and
Paris. Students, he said, are still bound to brand

recognition, associating studying abroad with
going to Europe. Not many choose to go to
Asia, but the president said that places like
India have much to offer American citizens.
After all, he added, for today's generations,
the world is no longer merely a cultural win
dow, but a workplace.
Hennessy said that life in the post-Cold War
world has been fraught with unforeseen chal
lenges.
"When the Berlin Wall fell, we thought we
would have a new era, we would attain peace,
and be able to improve universal health care in
the world," he said.
But things turned out rather differently
than expected. Even in this time of globaliza
tion, he said, problems remain complicated
and solutions elusive. Specifically. Hennessy
noted the need to address the "inconvenient
truth" of global warming.
"There are real challenges to be ad
dressed." he stated.
But Hennessy expressed optimism and con
fidence that the University is the place where

changes begin. 1 le deemed university students
"the next generations of leaders." In the future,
I lennessy said the government will implement
new initiatives which will be engineered and
conceptualized by today's college students.
I lennessy praised the Farm's intimate com
bination of world-class law, medical and engi
neering schools in close proximity, arguing that
the University must make use of its great re
sources. 1 le called for an increase in interdisci
plinary collaboration, especially at the gradu
ate level, as a means to formulate new initia
tives and solutions for a variety of problems.
The next great task, I lennessy said, is not to
come up with a new model or strategy but to
educate the science community on working
with the public. 1 le spoke of a need to remedy
widespread deficiency in scientific literacy.The
media, he said, has not effectively disseminat
ed scientific findings and implications. Hen
nessy maintained that scientists must become
better public speakers and teachers in order to
bridge many gaps, especially the one between
politics and science.
