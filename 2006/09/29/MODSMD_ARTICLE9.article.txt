## Ph.D. student discovers complex diabetes link New biochemical connection found, Med School hopeful advance 
### DIANNA BAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For 20.8 million Americans suftcring
from diabetes, hope might lie in the re
cent findings by a team of Stanford scien
tists.
Some might call it a breakthrough, a
gateway to new remedies and possibly
cures for diabetes patients. Dr. Jeremy
Heit, an MD/Ph.D. student, calls it his
thesis.
"It is a culmination of four years of
work," Heit said of the findings, which
were published in the Sept. 21 issue ot
Nature magazine. "The results are excit
ing."
Working with Dr. Seung Kim. assis
tant professor of developmental biology
and medicine at the Stanford Medical
School. Heit uncovered some of the intri
cate biochemical links between cal
cineurin, NFAT and insulin.
Ilie four-year-long journey, appropri
ately, began and ended with patients.
It started with a question at Kim's
lab: Why do 30 percent of organ trans
plant patients who use certain kinds of
immunosuppressant drugs get dia
betes?
To understand this, one must lirst get
familiar with the disease, I leit said.
According to the American Diabetes
Association, diabetes is the sixth leading
cause of death in the United States. It oc
curs when the body does not produce
enough insulin or does not use it correct

ly. Insulin helps muscles, fat and the liver
take in sugar and store it as energy—at
the same time lowering the amount of
sugar in blood so the excess doesn't dam
age blood vessels, kidneys and other tis
sues.
"When you eat a meal, the sugar level
in your bloodstream rises," Heit ex
plained.
Beta cells in the pancreas then sense
the rise and respond by producing and
releasing insulin to the bloodstream, he
said. A shortage of insulin or a failure of
the hormone to function properly results
in diabetes.
From these facts, Heit and his team
reasoned that since organ transplant
patients get diabetes so often, the im
munosuppressant drugs they are using
must target something that affects beta
cells.
ITiey were right.
That "something" was calcineurin, a
protein the drugs are known to suppress.
Heit found that the absence of cal
cineurin led to diabetes.
Heit and Kim made this discovery
with the help of Dr. Gerald Crabtree,
Stanford professor of developmental bi
ology and pathology, who lent his bio
chemical expertise—and lab mice—to
the project.
Heit and his team "deleted" the cal
cineurin from the beta cells ot a group of
mice.
As they predicted, the mice developed
severe cases of diabetes within weeks.
In further investigations. Heit found
that calcineurin played a central role in
beta cell growth and its production and
release of insulin.
