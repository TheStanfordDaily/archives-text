# Hello, let me give you my card
## 
### 
The beginning of a new year is always
hard for me. There's buying books, get
ting back into a school routine and then
there's the people asking endless tiring ques
tions like "What's your name?" "Where are
you from?" and "Can ! borrow a lofting
tool?"
I think that, typically, these are not diffi
cult questions for a person to answer. For in
stance. I never have a lofting tool. But the
other two questions prove surprisingly com
plicated, especially considering that they are
posed in the first week of most foreign lan
guage classes (in which the emphasis is more
on not speaking English than on higher level
thinking).
But 1 also have to acknowledge that, for
most people, the answer is something like
"Jessica" and "New York." For me, the an
swers are "Sini. No. not Cindy Not Sydney.
Sini. S-I-N-I. Yes." And "We 11... it's complicat
ed."
I mean. 1 have a birthplace. I wasn't born
in the middle of international waters or on
an airplane or something like that. I was
born in a hospital in Homewood, Alabama,
which is a perfectly legitimate location to be
born (and Ill meet you in the battlefields of

Selma to fight you on that), if not for the fact
that it was the wrong country. The way 1 un
derstand it. my parents more or less "hap
pened" to be in the US. for what they
thought was a three-year-stay and apparent
ly if my mother is to be believed, just got
bored. "One screaming toddler is not
enough." they said to themselves. "What we
really need is another one."
At this point in the story, my mom would
sagely add. "What you should really be glad
of is that we didn't move back to Finland im
mediately. because we never would've had
you!"
So I was born an American, but my par
ents got me a Finnish passport. And the first
in a long line of confused government offi
cials recorded my birthplace as

"Helsinki/Homewood." So then I was
Finnish-American. And then we moved
back to Finland for a year and a half. And
then we moved back to Alabama. English
won out once and for all and my Finnish
dwindled to a heavily accented second lan
guage with questionable grammar. And
then we went back every summer and I told
my wide-eyed cousins about American
pizza and TV. My grandma told me in
l innish that it was so nice to see me for these
"tew short weeks every summer," because
she guessed some people "just hated the
country that was good enough for everyone
else in the family."
Iliis two-paragraph novella of my life
story should really just be distilled into"! was
born in Birmingham" for casual conversa
tion. but 1 can't forget my culture. I really do
go into it with the intent of just saying the
bare basics, but then someone stumbles over
my name, and 1 feel obligated to apologize by
saying that it's Finnish, well,l'm Finnish, and
somehow the conversation turns to "Well, we
were going to move back to Helsinki perma
nently. but my brother and 1 had a hard time
