This is a disgusting article! This
encourages recreational sex. which
is harmful to the psychological and
physiological well-being of a
human being, especially females.
Yes females, because as you know,
males and females are built differ
ently in these two aspects. That is
why STDs and psychological prob
lems are rampant in this society.

This is a fabulous article. I ap
plaud The Daily's candor. I lowev

er, I am a hit disturbed by the line
"Guys come out feeling masterful
and girls satisfied with the fact that
he gave it his best shot..." I feel like
this perpetuates the stereotype that
female sexual satisfaction is rooted
in the response of their partner.Too
often, our culture promotes an
image of female sexuality that is de
pendent. or at least secondary, to
the sexual experience of men.
While 1 appreciate The Daily's at
tempt to address the stigma at
tached to sexual expression/experi
mentation. 1 hope it is not acciden
tally undermined by perpetuating a
harmful stereotype. Regardless of
whether one's partner is a "naive
virgin", all women should "come
out" of any sexual experience feel
ing triumphant that they too "mas
tered" and expressed their sexual
desires. This is not to say that
women are not invested in the ex
perience of their partners. Rather,
we are invested in ours as well.

This article wasn't meant to be
taken so literally. Roxy Sass is a pen
name for whatever anonymous In
termission writer gets to pen down
hi larious/satirical/over-t he-top
sex-related columns for a year.
Don't worry, students don't read
Roxy and immediately take her ad
vice. We're adults, after a 11...

So if it is meant to shock, you peo

time, others will think in not so
good a light about Stanford.
