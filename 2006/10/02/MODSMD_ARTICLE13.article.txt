## Article misinforms on textbook prices 
### 
The Stanford Daily's recent arti
cle on textbook prices by Anthony
Sanchez ("Academic publishers reap
profits," Sept. 26) is filled with misin
formation. errors and myths, and en
tirely missed the mark on several
points.
The Daily made no effort to
check facts or interview second
sources. The article combined
spending on K-12 textbooks with
college textbooks. It compared the
price of tuition, which is highly sub
sidized by taxpayers, with the price
of textbooks, which receive no subsi

ignored the changing nature of
today's college textbooks, the role of
professors in the book-buying
process and the wide range of text
book choices and prices offered by
publishers.

prices. There are more than
262.000 adopted titles on sale
today in America's college stores.
Some cost-saving innovations in

custom texts, one or two color edi
tions or abbreviated soft-cover
editions. The new and expanding
range of technologies are helping
more students pass their courses,
stay in school and graduate sooner,
saving the students time and
money while improving their suc
cess rates.
2. I"he 2005 GAO report on col
lege textbooks concluded that pub
lishers invest money and take on sig
nificant risk to create educational
materials that improve student suc
cess. and "publishers are assuming

roles that have traditionally be
longed to postsecondary institu
tions."
3. The same report said that the
U.S. new and used college textbook
market totals about $6 billion annu
ally. By contrast, the National Retail
Federation's annual "2006 Back-to
( ollege consumer survey predicts
that students and their parents will
spend about five times that amount
— $36.6 billion — on items that in
clude electronics, entertainment,
apparel, shoes and room decora
tions.
4. lextbook prices, which account
lot less than 5 percent of higher edu
cation expenses, are not rising as fast
as other higher education costs such
