## Article misinforms on textbook prices 
### 
The Stanford Daily's recent arti
cle on textbook prices by Anthony
Sanchez ("Academic publishers reap
profits," Sept. 26) is filled with misin
formation. errors and myths, and en
tirely missed the mark on several
points.
The Daily made no effort to
check facts or interview second
sources. The article combined
spending on K-12 textbooks with
college textbooks. It compared the
price of tuition, which is highly sub
sidized by taxpayers, with the price
of textbooks, which receive no subsi
dies. And most importantly, it totally
ignored the changing nature of
today's college textbooks, the role of
professors in the book-buying
process and the wide range of text
book choices and prices offered by
publishers.
ITie facts are:
1. Publishers offer a variety of
options for textbooks and instruc

tional tools at a wide range of
prices. There are more than
262.000 adopted titles on sale
today in America's college stores.
Some cost-saving innovations in
clude online texts and e-books,
custom texts, one or two color edi
tions or abbreviated soft-cover
editions. The new and expanding
range of technologies are helping
more students pass their courses,
stay in school and graduate sooner,
saving the students time and
money while improving their suc
cess rates.
2. I"he 2005 GAO report on col
lege textbooks concluded that pub
lishers invest money and take on sig
nificant risk to create educational
materials that improve student suc
cess. and "publishers are assuming

roles that have traditionally be
longed to postsecondary institu
tions."
3. The same report said that the
U.S. new and used college textbook
market totals about $6 billion annu
ally. By contrast, the National Retail
Federation's annual "2006 Back-to
( ollege consumer survey predicts
that students and their parents will
spend about five times that amount
— $36.6 billion — on items that in
clude electronics, entertainment,
apparel, shoes and room decora
tions.
4. lextbook prices, which account
lot less than 5 percent of higher edu
cation expenses, are not rising as fast
as other higher education costs such
as tuitions and student fees. Accord
ing to Student Monitor, an inde
pendent student research service,
the average college student spent
$644 on textbooks during the 2005-
2006 academic year, a cost that has
remained generally steady over the
past three years.
5. The average textbook cost
number The Daily cites is for text
book and supplies, which may in
clude computers, calculators and lab
equipment.
6. Faculty members choose
course materials based on what they
believe is best for their students' ed
ucation. According to a recently re
leased Zogby International study,
professors are requiring the materi
als they believe can help their stu
dents succeed — new textbooks and
supplemental tools — which sug
gests that professors believe the
price of success outweighs the cost of
failure.
7. Publishers only make a 4 to 7
percent profit on textbook sales. For
more details, visit http://www.pub

lishers.org/highered/pdfs/Graphic.p
df.
cS. New textbook editions are gen
erally issued every three to four
years because 80 percent of instruc
tors say it is important that the mate
rial in texts used for their courses be
as current as possible, and 62 percent
of college faculty say they prefer to
order texts with the most recent
copyright date, according to a na
tionwide study by Zogby Interna
tional.
9. The sale of textbooks overseas,
while small,help hold down the price
of textbooks in America.
As the cost of higher education
continues to escalate, America's
publishers are helping students get
the most out of their tuition dollar by
responding to changing needs and
helping them do their best.Thanks to
industry innovations and new tech
nology. publishers are providing stu
dents with more choices, better
learning tools and more ways to
save. Contrary to the image created
by The Daily's article, today's college
textbooks may be the best long-term
investment a student can make.
