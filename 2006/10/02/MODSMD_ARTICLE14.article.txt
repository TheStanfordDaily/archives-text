## COMING UP EMPTY Edwards throws three interceptions, fumbles twice, as Cardinal drop fifth straight game to open the season 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
PASADENA, Calif — Last season's come
from-ahead overtime loss to UCLA was one of
Stanford's most heartbreaking defeats in recent
memory.
UCLA 31
O
Saturday night at the Rose Bowl, the Bruins
(3-1. 1-1 Pac-10) made sure that there was no
such suspense this year, dispatching the Cardinal
(0-5,0-3) by a score of 31 -0 in front of 72,095 ex
cited UCLA fans.
But despite the lopsided final score, the game
felt like an improvement, especially defensively,
for a Stanford team that has now lost four games
by at least three touchdowns. The Cardinal de
fensive unit, which entered the game last in the
nation in total defense, kept the Bruins offense
out of the endzone in the first half and created
three UCLA turnovers.
It wasn't a completely successful defensive
performance — the Bruins still accumulated
389 yards of total offense, 166 on the ground, and
scored 17 points — but it was a clear upgrade of
the efforts put forth in previous weeks.

"I think the score didn't indicate what a bat
tle it was for most of the game," Stanford coach
Walt Harris said. "Our defense played hard and
gave us a chance to win the football game, and
I'm really proud of that."
UCLA quarterback Ben Olson struggled at
times to pick out open receivers, and the Cardi
nal turned that into a pair of interceptions, in
cluding one in the Stanford endzone by safety
Trevor Hooper.
The most impressive defensive sequence
came in the closing moments of the first half.
Leading 7-0 with just seconds remaining in the
half, UCLA drove the ball down the field to set
up a first-and-goal from the Stanford six-yard
line. But Stanford held the Bruins on four con
secutive plays, including two from the one-yard
line to keep it a one-possession game heading to
the locker rooms.
Unfortunately for Harris' squad, the offense
and special teams couldn't match the defense's
improved performance.
Senior quarterback Trent Edwards had one
of the worst starts of his Stanford career, com
pleting 12-of-23 passes for 117 yards, no touch
downs and three interceptions. He also lost two
fumbles, one of which was returned for a touch
down by Bruin defensive end Kenneth Lom
bard.
Edwards didn't get any help from the running
game, which managed only 49 yards on 34 carries
for a 1.4 yards per carry average. The Cardinal
were without their starting running back, junior
Anthony Kimble, who was forced to miss Satur
day's game after suffering a concussion during
last weekend's 36-10 loss to Washington State.
"My feeling right now is that we let the de
fense down." Edwards said."lt's embarrassing to
see the offense perform like that."
Stanford's best chance for a touchdown came
late in the fourth quarter when Edwards hit
freshman receiver Richard Sherman for a 29-

yard gain to take Stanford to the
UCLA 26-yard line. But on the very
next play, Edwards had his pass, in
tended for Sherman, intercepted by
UCLA's Trey Brown in the end zone
to end the drive.
"We needed to get on the board.
We needed to give our guys some
hope," Harris said. "Unfortunately,
we couldn't do that."
That drive was one of only two
times that Stanford was able to move
the ball into UCLA territory. Ihe
other came at the start of the second
quarter, when the Cardinal recovered
a UCLA fumble deep in Bruin terri
tory. but junior kicker Aaron Zagory
missed a 40-yard field goal attempt
wide right to keep Stanford scoreless.
"When the defense gives you
turnovers, it is really frustrating not
to do anything with them," Edwards

said."That is something that we are
definitely going to have to fix for the
coming weeks."
Hie Cardinal's special teams play
was also overflowing with mistakes.
Stanford averaged 1.3 yards per
punt return and 1 ).7 yards per kickoff
return and watched UCLA return a
blocked punt for their only first-half
touchdown.
Stanford has now lost three
straight games to UCLA and hasn't
scored in a game at the Rose Bowl
since 2002. They were also shut out
m their last trip to Pasadena in 2004.
21-0.
Next up for the Cardinal is a trip
to South Bend. Ind. to take on No. 12
Notre Dame. However. Stanford
hasn't beaten the Fighting Irish since
2001.
"There were plays from this game
that we can draw on for next week."
Fdwards said. "I'm excited for the
challenge of Notre Dame and the
rest of the season. 1 came to Stanford
to get a chance to play against teams
like UCLA and Notre Dame.
