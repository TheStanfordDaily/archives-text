## Score masks solid defensive effort But season only gets tougher with Notre Dame up next 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
At least they fought with heart.
Sure, Stanford football may be on
the road to its first winless season since
1%0 _ a prospect that grows increas
ingly likely by the week. But don t tell
that to the players, who hung with a tar
more talented UCLA team for three
quarters.
The 31 0 final score did not reflect
how well Stanford played defensively, es
pecially in the first half. And for a young
unit that came into the game last in the
nation in rushing defense — by over 50
yards per game — that taste of success
was sorely needed.
Those who claim there's no such thing
as a moral victory need to listen to Walt
Harris" halftime interview. He sounded
as surprised and pleased by the 7-0 deficit
as the rest of us.
And people complain about Walt Harris
