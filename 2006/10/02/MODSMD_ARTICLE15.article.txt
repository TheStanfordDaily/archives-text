# ANALYSIS
## Score masks solid defensive effort But season only gets tougher with Notre Dame up next 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
At least they fought with heart.
Sure, Stanford football may be on
the road to its first winless season since
1%0 _ a prospect that grows increas
ingly likely by the week. But don t tell
that to the players, who hung with a tar
more talented UCLA team for three
quarters.
The 31 0 final score did not reflect
how well Stanford played defensively, es
pecially in the first half. And for a young
unit that came into the game last in the
nation in rushing defense — by over 50
yards per game — that taste of success
was sorely needed.
Those who claim there's no such thing
as a moral victory need to listen to Walt
Harris" halftime interview. He sounded
as surprised and pleased by the 7-0 deficit
as the rest of us.
And people complain about Walt Harris


MAE RYAN/The Stanford Daily
Senior linebacker Michael Okwo made 11 tackles against UCLA. He is third on the team with
36 total tackles, although he missed the first two games.
Of course, what will likely go
down as Stanford's best defensive
half of the season came against a
UCLA squad coached by Karl
Dorrell. Dorrell is easily the worst
head coach in the conference —
and quite possibly the worst in the
country — and his blunders al
lowed Stanford's defense to shine.
With a first and goal at the Car
dinal five and the first half draw
ing to a close. Dorrell wisely ran on
first and second downs, advancing
the ball to the one.
That set up a UCLA third down
just one yard from paydirt against
the worst rushing defense in the
country, with a young quarterback
who had already thrown two inter
ceptions that half. Obviously, any
thing that's not a running play be
tween the tackles would be pure
insanity, especially a pass.
Dorrell didn't see it that way.
Third down was a play-action
lob (if given the handoff. the back
would have scored virtually un
touched) that fell incomplete.
Dorrell then wisely chose to go for
the score on fourth, but called a
toss sweep to the weak (closest to
the sideline) side of the field. The
toss gave the defense time to pen
etrate and running it weakside
gave the tailback nowhere to go. I
thought hard about this and I
could not come up with a worse
play. Corner Tim Sims made the
biggest tackle of what's been a
tough Stanford career for him and
Stanford charged into the locker
room pumped.
The poor coaching won't mat
ter against Stanford or any other
talent-stripped opponents who
cough up live turnovers to the
Bruins.
But UCLA visits Oregon.
Notre Dame and Cal in the next
month. I'm betting Walt Harris
would win one of those games as
the UCLA coach — and Dorrell
won't.
Offensive issues
Coming into the season, 10 re
turning offensive starters had us
thinking this team would be able
to win its share of games when the
defense played like it has. But take
away the top three receivers, the
starting fullback and the best of

fensive lineman, and the lack of
wins becomes no surprise. I've
documented the defensive strug
gles these last two weeks, so here
are the cold, hard facts on the of
fense:
- Of 119 Division l-A teams, the
rushing offense ranks 101 stand
the scoring offense 109 th.
- Trent Edwards has taken a huge
step backwards — from the most
underrated quarterback this side
of the Rockies last season to a
senior doing his best to play him
self out of a fat NFL contract this
season. (He'll still be drafted
though. The demand for quarter
backs is too high and Edwards too
physically gifted.)
- Don't knock Edwards too hard
though — opposing defensive
linemen have been doing that
plenty anyway. It's hard to fault
the quarterback when the 21 sacks
Stanford allowed rank 115 th in the
country.
Plus, they have Touchdown Jesus
The visit to Notre Dame this
Saturday is going to be ugly. And
tomorrow is Tuesday. I low about
something not obvious?
Well, if in real estate it's loca
tion. location, location, in football
it's matchups, matchups,
matchups. And Notre Dame's one
weakness is the defensive second
ary. To borrow from Nelly, corner
Terrail Lambert has been blown
up like a cocoa puff. Michigan re
ceiver Mario Manningham caught
three touchdowns against the Irish
- in the first half. But with re
ceivers Evan Moore and Mark
Bradford injured, Stanford has no
quality wideouts to test the Irish
backfield.
Notre Dame's defensive line is
one of the best in the country.
Stanford's offensive line is one of
the worst. And with no one to
stretch the Irish deep. Stanford
will be staring at a loaded box —
and a lot of three-and-outs — all
afternoon.
So Stanford's defense should be
on the field a long time Saturday.
That will cause the pass rush to tire
and slow, and will give pretty-boy
quarterback Brady Ouinn (inci
dentally, incredibly overrated) all
day to pick apart the Stanford
backfield and tailback Darius
Walker wide lanes.
At least Arizona, a squad with
plenty of weaknesses in its own
right, visits for homecoming the
week after.
