# Pick Saves Six

### 
The Cardinal defense, missing in action for most of the season, came up big with
two interceptions in the first half On the second pick of the evening, Ben Olson
(7) dropped back from the Stanford 16 on 3rd and 11; good coverage forced him to
hold the ball for several seconds. He threw to a man in the end zone, but Brandon Har
rison (23) tipped the ball at the goal line and knocked it toward Trevor Hooper (24),
who made the pick and kneeled down for a touchback.
