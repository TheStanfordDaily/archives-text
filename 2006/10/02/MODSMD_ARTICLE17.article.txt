fense held their opposition to only two shots on goal.
On Saturday, however, the Broncos' made their two
shots count, scoring on each opportunity.
'I*he Buck Shaw Stadium crowd saw a frantic Cardi
nal team lacking in confidence at the opening of Satur
day's match. Unable to maintain control, the Cardinal
struggled to find the rhythm and momentum that they

needed to break the Bronco defense.
"We weren't possessing the ball" sophomore de
fender Allison Falk said. "We were just kicking long
balls."
Santa Clara goalkeeper Meagan McCray began her
solid performance in the net just seven minutes into the
game when she dove to pick off Stanford junior Lizzy
George's cross to freshman Kelley O Mara. Ttoenty
minutes later, the Cardinal earned a penalty kick just
outside the box but senior Shari Summeris strike on
goal was knocked away by the Santa ( lara defense.
Falk sent the rebound shot wide of the
goal.
Five minutes later, Santa Clara pro
duced their first shot, and goal, of the
game when freshman kiki Bosio connect
ed with sophomore Amanda Poach to
give the Broncos a 1-0 lead. The goal was
the first of Poach s collegiate career.
While the Cardinal had yet to settle
down and gain their confidence, they re
fused to back down during the remain
der of the first half. With the clock wind
ing down, freshman Kristin Stannard
found her way past the Bronco defense,
hut McCray challenged Stannard before
she could take the shot. At the close of
the first half, the Cardinal had no points
on the scoreboard despite a 3-1 lead in
shots.
The Cardinal finally found their game
at the opening of the second half.
"We did a great job in the second half,"
falk said. "We really calmed down and
just played the way we know how to play.
We possessed the ball well in the second
half and had a number of shots on goal.
We just need to finish those chances."
The improvement, though, was not
enough to offset Meagan Snell's team
high eighth goal this season.Two minutes
into the second half, Snell put the Bron
cos on the board lor a second and final
time.
ITie C ardinal dominated possession
and play throughout the remainder of
the second halt with 12 shots in 43 min
utes while denying Santa Clara a single
shot.
Stanford continued to pressure Santa
Clara s defense, gaining an indirect free
kick fifteen minutes after the restart. Falk
sent a header on goal from senior Rachel
Buehler's cross, but McCray denied the
Cardinal once again. McCray withstood
the Stanford pressure with 8 saves on
Saturday.
Despite the loss, the Cardinal came out
of Saturday's game geared up and confi
dent for the start of conference play this
Friday against No. 16 USC before a Sun
day game against No. 5 UCLA at McAlis
ter Field. The Trojans (7-2-1) suffered a
loss this weekend to Loyola Marvmount
while the Bruins (9-2-0) came out Sunday
with a victory over Gonzaga.
"I think that we learned that we can
compete and beat anyone in the coun
try." Falk said. "Santa Clara is ranked as
the third best team in the country, and
now we know we can beat them.especial
ly if we play the way we did in the second
half for the entire game."
