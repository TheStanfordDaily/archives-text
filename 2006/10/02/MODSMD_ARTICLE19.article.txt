### BY REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR Numbers 
In the first home stand of the Pac
-10 ( onference season, the No. 6 Stan
ford women's volleyball team put on a
show tor the tans this weekend. T"he
Cardinal (12-2. 3-1 Pac-10) kept up
their winning streak in Maples Pavil
ion. sweeping past Arizona and ASU
to stay perfect at home, which is no
easv feat in the nationally dominant
Pac-10.
"The Pac-10 is playing at a great
level," head coach John Dunning said.
"Right now there are five great teams
and five teams that come out and chal
lenge every week. 1 lome court is huge.
So far this season, all of the big wins
have been at home. It jList shows how
even the teams in this conference."
The top five Pac-10 teams are all
undefeated at home in 2006, so the
pair of wins over the Wildcats and Sun
Devils was crucial in keeping the Car
dinal among the contenders for the
conference crown.
Stanford's stellar sophomore duo
of outside hitter Cynthia Barboza and
middle blocker Foluke Akinradewo
led the way to the sweep with over
powering offense and smothering de
fense, combining for 60 kills. 13 blocks
and seven aces on the weekend. Akin
radewo hit .561 through the two
matches with only a single hitting
error all weekend.
"One of the big things we want to
do is vary our attack." Dunning said.
"We need to get the right side involved
and get the ball to the middle as much
as we can. And that way. when the ball
goes to Cynthia and [senior outside
hitter) Kristin [Richards], they have
more openings."
The Cardinal looked sluggish early
on Friday, barely pulling out the 35-33
win in the first game, but then found a
groove and blasted Arizona 30-15 in
the third game of the sweep.
After trading points early, Stanford
pulled out to a 17-11 lead but the Wild
cats charged back to close the gap to
one. The Cardinal had game point at
