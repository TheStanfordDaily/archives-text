## Amidst success, bike ban still irksome Junior angry at paper waste but policy appears effective 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ilie weather was gorgeous, and her workload
had yet to pile up. but junior Bianca Ceralvo still
dreaded going to class last week.
A generally relaxing first week of class be
came difficult with the new central pedestrian
zone.The policy, enforced by the Department of
Public Safety, prohibits riding and parking bicy
cles — as well as rollerblades and skateboards
— in the arcades ot the Main Quad, an area com
monly frequented by bikers in pre\ ious years.
"This whole week was annoying." said Ceral
vo. who called the new policy "ludicrous" and
"frustrating."

While some students expressed their disgust
with the new hike ban. Sergeant Al James of the
Department of Public Safety said patrol officers
on duty reported the policy had been imple
mented effectively so far.
"The students are abiding by it,"he said.
Refusing to abide by the new policy, Ceralvo
described a different story. She claims that she
has been approached by patrol officers, whom
she compared to hall monitors, and has found .1
yellow flier stapled to her bicycle every time she
has parked under the arcades.
"It's annoying," she said. "It wastes a lot of
paper, and no one ever reads it anyway."
In response. Ceralvo has stapled a piece of
paper to her bike that reads. "Stop wasting
paper!"
"I'm going to bike in the arcades as much as
possible at least until they start ticketing," she

said. "I just want to enjoy it while 1
can,even though people are screech
ing in my ear."
James said that the police will
continue its educational campaign
throughout the month to ensure that
campus members are aware of the
changes.
"We have had people giving out
fliers and talking to people personal
ly in the Quad," he said.
Although violators will not re
ceive fines during the introductory
six-week period of this policy, bikes
in the Quad in November will be
confiscated and violators will have
to pay an administrative service fee
to retrieve their bicycles.
According to James, the adminis
tration is concerned with the safety
of both bikers and pedestrians. 'Hie
officer added that, with the policy,
the University hopes to reduce the
number of bicycle accidents. Al
though James admitted that he had
not seen statistics on the frequency
of bike accidents in the arcade areas,
he did remark that accidents occur
all over campus.

The policy, developed by a steer
ing committee of senior staff and ad
ministrators, drew Ceralvo's ire for
failing to take student input into ac
count. She also speculated that the
policy was implemented not for safe
ty reasons but for aesthetic purposes
— so that Main Quad would not be
cluttered with students riding their
bicycles.
"They say it's for safety reasons,
but they don't tell us how much safer
it may or may not make the Quad."
she said.
Sophomore Josh Resa agreed
that he found the safety argument
less than convincing.
"1 never once came close to run
ning into anyone biking under the
archways," he said.
Some students have said that if
the University is serious about re
ducing bicycle injuries, it should
focus on the "Intersection of Death"
the crossing of Lasuen Mall and
Escondido Road. James also admit
ted that the new policy in the arcades
could potentially increase traffic in
other areas already crowded with
bikers.
"If they're not riding on the ar
cades. they would probably have to
he on the pedestrian malls." he said.
"We don't know how those areas are
going to be impacted."
