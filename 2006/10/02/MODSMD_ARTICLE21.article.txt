## Early action benefits students and schools 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
Harvard University announced
two weeks ago that will end its early
admissions policy, starting with Fall
2008 applicants. That decision has
prompted editorial praise from The
New York Times, The Chicago Sun-
Times, USA Today and The Atlantic
online, as well as from local papers
like The San Jose Mercury News and
The San Francisco Chronicle.
Harvard's dean of admissions
William Fitzsimmons said the move
was largely an attempt to benefit
low-income students. Admission
rates are typically higher for appli
cants who apply early at most of the
highly selective universities. There
is a widespread belief that low-in
come students have been disadvan
taged with this policy because they
lack the sophistication and re
sources to compete with wealthy
students who get their applications
in early.
Commenting in The New York
limes, Lloyd Thacker, the execu
tive director of the Education Con
servancy, a nonprofit group created
to lobby for an overhaul of admis
sions procedures, said that Har

vard's new policy was in the "public
interest." Harvard's interim presi
dent Derek Bok opined that "the
more schools abandon this process,
the healthier the admissions
process will be."
Well, that's the fairy tale version
of this story. The reality is that
there's no data supporting the magi
cal belief that flocks of underprivi
leged youth have been shut out of
elite colleges because universities
admit students in two waves. Al
though early admission applicants
are generally admitted at higher
percentages than students from the
regular applicant pool, the reason is
because they are better qualified ap
plicants.
In fact, the Harvard application
for admission in 2007 makes that
very point. Harvard warns students
that their chances of acceptance will
not be increased by applying early.
"Higher Early Action acceptance
rates reflect the remarkable
strength of Early Action pools —
not less rigorous admissions stan
dards... Early Action applicants
have, on average, stronger admis
sions credentials than regular appli
cants ... For any individual student.

the final admission decision will be
the same whether the student ap
plies early or regular."
Early admissions policies benefit
accepted applicants who are assured
of attending their top choice school
and spared the angst of waiting until
spring to get the news about which
college they can attend. They also
benefit universities that lock in qual
ified students through their early de
cision policies. Though early action
policies like those of Yale and Stan
ford do not require that accepted
early admits attend those schools.
Deferred and rejected applicants
lose nothing, as the former group is
still considered in the regular admis
sions pool and both groups can apply
to other colleges.
Though many of I larvard's com
petitors have publicly lauded the de
cision, only Princeton and the Uni
versity of Virginia have followed the
trend. Biddy Martin. Cornell Uni
versity provost, was quoted in thei
thacajournal.com:'it is not yet clear
whether Harvard's decision is going
to be the right one for Cornell."
Duke University dean of under
graduate admissions told The Her
ald Sun, a local North Carolina

newspaper, that "We're certainly not
going to make an immediate
change."
An editorial in the student-run
Yale Daily News has urged the col
lege not to drop its early action pro
gram. Dartmouth dean of admis
sions Karl Furstenberg said that
"early decision works well for Dart
mouth and its students." Lee Stetson,
dean of admissions at the University
of Pennsylvania, told the Los Ange
les Times that his university's early
admissions process was "very suc
cessful" for the school and its stu
dents.
Some students want the opportu
nity to apply early to universities or
they wouldn't bother sending in their
applications. It makes no sense to
eliminate early admissions programs
at schools like Stanford. Those pro
grams benefit early bird students
without disadvantaging any other
students.
