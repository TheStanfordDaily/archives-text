## Stanford fails civics exam Elite universities rank across the board in civics and American history 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Think everyone at Stanford gets
an A? Guess again.The University of
Connecticut recently gave Stanford
students a 13 for their knowledge of
civics and American history.
Working with the nonprofit edu
cational organization Intercollegiate
Studies Institute (ISS), the UConn
department of public policy sampled
14,(XH) students at 50 schools of vary
ing size.
The study, conducted in 2005,
posed 60 multiple-choice questions
to freshmen and seniors in the sub
ject areas of American history, gov
ernment. America and the world and
the market economy. It then com
pared the averages from the two
classes at each school to determine
how much more,or less,seniors knew
than freshmen and to identify the
school's performance in increasing
student knowledge. Despite these

defined objectives, Stanford faculty
questioned how seriously the survey
should be taken.
"It's about the facts, pure and sim
ple, which is what this survey appar
ently tested for," said History Prof.
David Kennedy. "What 1 try to do in
my classes is encourage students to
think synthetically and contextually,
and to form historical judgments that
are supported by evidence, reasoned
argument and a sense of the larger
picture and deeper dynamics rele
vant to the issue at hand."
Stanford placed 31st out of the 50
schools;UC-Berkeley earned an F to
finish 49th, beating only Johns Hop
kins University.
Elite universities ranked all over
the board. While Princeton took
18th place and Harvard 25th,
Yale, Duke, Brown and Cor
nell all finished between 44th
place and 48th place.The sur
prising top finisher was the
small Rhodes College of
Memphis. Tennessee. Stu
dents there increased their
scores by 11.6 percent, from 50.6
to 62.2 percent, over the four-year
span.
Stanford freshmen, meanwhile,
scored an average of 62.2 percent.

and seniors scored an average of
63.1 percent — a 0.9 percent
growth, which the researchers
deemed an insignificant difference.
While Stanford seniors outper
formed those at Rhodes, the large
differential between Rhodes' sen
ior and freshman scores led the
study's authors to conclude that
Rhodes did a better job educating
its students.
"The study suggests that we are
reaching some students, but could
definitely be reaching more," said
History Asst. Prof. Caroline Win-

"There's a basic knowledge that students should learn
atH||fWik that universities don't think that way."
— TERRY MOE, chairman of Political Science Department

terer. "My advice: Take more U.S.
history while at Stanford."
Though Stanford exhibited a
marginal, but positive, growth, some
schools, such as Johns Hopkins and
Cal, saw "negative learning," or a
drop of 7 and 5 percent respectively
between their freshmen and seniors.
"It's especially disheartening to
see the survey's finding that exiting
seniors know less than entering
freshmen [at some schools]."
Kennedy said.
The study emphasized the value
of history for effective citizenship.
"Today's college students,our na
tion's future leaders," the study said,
"must understand their nation's his
tory and founding principles if they
are to be informed and engaged citi
zens."
One sample question, for exam
ple, asked students to identify the
three inalienable rights — life, liber
ty, and the pursuit of happiness
described in the Declaration of In
dependence.
Winterer, like Kennedy, thinks
there is more to American historv

and civics, than just knowing the
facts.
"I would be careful about draw
ing direct connections between the
teaching of history and the making
of 'good citizens/" she said. "Thomas
Jefferson. John Adams and James
Madison all knew a lot about histo
ry; whether that made them good
citizens or not depends on whether
your perspective is American or
British."
Professor Terry Moe.chairman of
the political science department,
added that many factors could po
tentially affect the outcomes of the
study, including the vast number of
students at Stanford who choose to
specialize in the sciences, engineer
ing and math.
He did agree with Kennedy, how
ever. that Stanford focuses more on
teaching theory and critical-thinking
skills than simply facts. Moe added
that he found the teaching of facts
and historical dates to be considered
"old-fashioned" in academe.
"There is a basic knowledge that
students should learn." he said."and
1 think that universities don't think
that way. My view is that they
should."
To remedy the students' lack of
knowledge in the civics, the ISS rec
ommended that schools "increase

the number of required history, po
litical science and economics cours
es." The study's authors also con
cluded that "civic learning is signifi
cantly greater at schools that require
students to take courses in Ameri
can history.political science and eco
nomics."
While Kennedy was "wary of re
quirements in general." he viewed
the Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) as a potential vehicle for
change.
"It does seem to me that the pres
ent IHUM requirement, which is
somewhat incoherent and lacking
articulation between its autumn
quarter and winter-spring quarter
components, might be a place in
which some sound civic education,
drawing on political theory and ap
propriately selected historical exam
ples, might make a good deal of
sense," he said.
Winterer suggested a remedy of
her own.
'•'lTie study found that more than
half of students could not correctly
identify the century in which the
Jamestown colony was established,"
Winterer observed. "Those students
should consider enrolling this fall in
History 150 A, [Winterer's colonial
American history survey course]
and the mystery will be revealed."
