## Stanford fails civics exam Elite universities rank across the board in civics and American history 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Think everyone at Stanford gets
an A? Guess again.The University of
Connecticut recently gave Stanford
students a 13 for their knowledge of
civics and American history.
Working with the nonprofit edu
cational organization Intercollegiate
Studies Institute (ISS), the UConn
department of public policy sampled
14,(XH) students at 50 schools of vary
ing size.
The study, conducted in 2005,
posed 60 multiple-choice questions
to freshmen and seniors in the sub
ject areas of American history, gov
ernment. America and the world and
the market economy. It then com
pared the averages from the two
classes at each school to determine
how much more,or less,seniors knew
than freshmen and to identify the
school's performance in increasing
student knowledge. Despite these

defined objectives, Stanford faculty
questioned how seriously the survey
should be taken.
"It's about the facts, pure and sim
ple, which is what this survey appar
ently tested for," said History Prof.
David Kennedy. "What 1 try to do in
my classes is encourage students to
think synthetically and contextually,
and to form historical judgments that
are supported by evidence, reasoned
argument and a sense of the larger
picture and deeper dynamics rele
vant to the issue at hand."
Stanford placed 31st out of the 50
schools;UC-Berkeley earned an F to
finish 49th, beating only Johns Hop
kins University.
Elite universities ranked all over
the board. While Princeton took
18th place and Harvard 25th,
Yale, Duke, Brown and Cor
nell all finished between 44th
place and 48th place.The sur
prising top finisher was the
small Rhodes College of
Memphis. Tennessee. Stu
dents there increased their
scores by 11.6 percent, from 50.6
to 62.2 percent, over the four-year
span.
Stanford freshmen, meanwhile,
scored an average of 62.2 percent.

and seniors scored an average of
63.1 percent — a 0.9 percent
growth, which the researchers
deemed an insignificant difference.
While Stanford seniors outper
formed those at Rhodes, the large
differential between Rhodes' sen
ior and freshman scores led the
study's authors to conclude that
Rhodes did a better job educating
its students.
"The study suggests that we are
reaching some students, but could
definitely be reaching more," said
History Asst. Prof. Caroline Win-

"There's a basic knowledge that students should learn
atH||fWik that universities don't think that way."
