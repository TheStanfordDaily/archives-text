## Med School bans pharmaceutical freebies Administration finds that gifts unfairly affect choice of prescriptions 
### DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT MANAGING EDITOR 
As much a part of the doctor's office as lollipops
and stethoscopes is the sea of pens, mugs and other
trinkets stamped with drug logos. But no more, at
least not if you get your next check-up on The Farm.
Last month, the Medical School banned doctors
in its hospitals and clinics from accepting gifts —
ranging from sticky notes to catered luncheons and
information sessions — from drug company repre
sentatives. While these freebies may seem innocu
ous to some. Dean Philip Pizzo, who pushed for the
new policy, pointed to recent data that suggests oth
erwise.
"Even small gifts can alter a doctor's drug-pre
scribing decisions and other recommendations she
or he may exercise," he said. "The very fact that the

pharmaceutical industry spends over $20 billion per
annum on such gifts and meals, most targeted at
doctors, is evidence that this marketing strategy
must be working."
Alan Cassells, coauthor of "Selling Sickness:
How the World's Biggest Pharmaceutical Compa
nies Are Turning Us All Into Patients," agreed.
"Gifts, large and small,'work' to the extent that
they buy a sense of obligation that is subtle and
powerful," he said. "The industry has known this for
years, and has exploited its power."
Even more troubling, officials argued, are "edu
cational" luncheons, paid for and presided over by
drug company reps, to hawk the latest treatments.
David Magnus, director of the Stanford Center for
Biomedical Ethics, said he had seen countless
episodes of these luncheons lead to doctors pre
scribing expensive "brand-name" drugs when
cheaper generic ones were available.
"People are hooked on the money," he said.
"They like that these luncheons and programs are
paid for, but it's a biased source of information."
Under the new policy, introduced on Sept. 12,

drug companies can pay for and cater an education
al program, hut on three conditions: it lias to be an
unrestricted gift, drug reps are barred from attend
ing. and all speakers have to disclose conflicts of in
terest.
Stanford's changes hardly came quickly. Medical
School administrators debated the new policy lor
over a year, which Magnus said indicated how
deeply the pharmaceutical industry has entrenched
itself in the profession.
"It's taken a long time to convince people of
things they find implausible, mainly that these small
things do make difference," he said.
Three days after Stanford announced the policy
shift, the drug industry came out swinging. Industry
lobbyist Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactur
ers of America (PhRMA) defended drug represen
tatives. arguing that they are integral cogs in the
medical industry
"Pharmaceutical marketing is one important
way for health care providers to receive the infor-
mation they need to make sure medicines are used properly and
patients are effectively treated," said Scott Lassman, senior as
sistant general counsel for PhRMA.
But C assells rejected the idea that industry representatives,
who are often former cheerleaders recruited for their looks and
ability to connect with people, were providing medical informa
tion.
"Ask your average doctor how much he learned from the
bombshell drug rep about the safety ofVioxx or Rezulin or Bay
col, he said. "Atter thousands of patients died due to very pre
ventable safety concerns, did physicians really learn about those
drug safety concerns?"
PhRMA has also argued that the free drug samples that rep
resentatives give doctors benefit low-income patients. Magnus
disagreed,countering that these freebies ultimately cost patients
more,because after the samples run out,the patients want tostay
on the brand name drug instead ot switching over to a cheaper
generic.
Phis is not charity, he said. "This is marketing people figur
ing out 'how do we get people to prescribe our drug."'
Stanford is not the tirst medical school to throw the money
lenders out of the temple — Yale and the University of Pennsyl
vania have enacted similar policies in the last two year — and
Magnus said he hopes it won't be the last.
I think you re going to see more and more medical centers
setting this as a standard." he said.
But even with the changes, Cassells said medical schools can
not become complacent.
"What is more worrying is where PhRMA will put its market
ing budgets when it is not allowed to schmooze doctors any
more. he said. Hi at is more worrying and more of an un
known."
In the short term. Magnus also predicted more immediate im
plications.
"You can bet. he laughed,"that the lunches won't be as nice."
