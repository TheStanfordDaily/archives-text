# STUDENT GROUPS
## Free FLiCKs aims to attract Sunday crowds SSE's financial losses lead to reorganization as non-profit, ASSU-funded student group 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Over the past few years, the managers of FLiCKs have used every
trick in the hag to try to till empty seats, from introducing multiple
show times, alternate pricing plans and special events. l*his year,
they've decided to use a word every college student understands:
free.
The introduction to free screenings came with a change in
FLiCK's organizational status. For much of the past decade, Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE) managed FLiCKs as a for-profit
business. Declining attendance and financial losses, however, led
SSE to make FLiCKs a student organization, funded by ASSU spe
cial fees
SSE CEO Matt McDonald, a 2005 graduate, emphasized that
FLiCKS is now a student group.
"It is no longer a business and much more of a service to the stu
dent population," McDonald said. "This model should help FLiCKs
sustain its history on campus and make the event more accessible to
everyone."
FLiCKs' financial troubles have substantially worsened since
2004. with the event losing thousands of dollars each year. McDon
ald attributed this downturn to students who may prefer to illegally
download movies from their dorm rooms than shell out $5 for ad

Stanford students enjoy free showing of films on Sunday nights, after
organizational structure for FLiCKs changes.
FLiCKs Co-manager Douglas
Blumeyer. a senior, says that tree
showings will make FLiCKs more
appealing to students and draw
them awav from illegally download
ing the latest films on their comput
ers.
"As movies have become easier
to get for free by downloading and
piracy, people are less willing to
spend the money," Blumeyer said.
"FI .iCKs is less about just seeing the
movie: there are other ways to do
that But if you want to see it with
your friends in that environment,
with the big screen and sound sys
tem. that's what it's for."
More than KM) students attended
the 7 p.m. FLiCKs showing last
night, and Blumeyer said he expects
attendance to dramatically increase.
"For most people I've talked to,
the difference between five bucks
and free is astronomical."
Co-manager Matthew Reed, a
sophomore, shared Blumeyer's pre
diction.
'i think attendance will go up."
Reed said. "People always complain
about how they have nothing to do
but go to trat parties. Now they have
a viable, free option."
But some students were not so
sure that the change in pricing
would draw them to Memorial Au
ditorium. the location for most
FLiCKs showings.
"Even last year when I had the $10
Fall Quarter season pass. I didn't go
verv often." said sophomore Wilson
Restrepo. "I'd go if there was a movie
I hadn't seen before. But either 1 was
n't very interested in most of the
movies, or I had seen them already."
Junior Fem Jira said that she at
tended FLiCKs a few times each
year and that a change in price could
help.
"The main reason I did not go
was not the price." she said. "It was
more of a convenience matter. But a
free ticket might help."
