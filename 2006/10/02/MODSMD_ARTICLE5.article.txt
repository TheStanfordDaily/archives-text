## Free FLiCKs aims to attract Sunday crowds SSE's financial losses lead to reorganization as non-profit, ASSU-funded student group 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Over the past few years, the managers of FLiCKs have used every
trick in the hag to try to till empty seats, from introducing multiple
show times, alternate pricing plans and special events. l*his year,
they've decided to use a word every college student understands:
free.
The introduction to free screenings came with a change in
FLiCK's organizational status. For much of the past decade, Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE) managed FLiCKs as a for-profit
business. Declining attendance and financial losses, however, led
SSE to make FLiCKs a student organization, funded by ASSU spe
cial fees
SSE CEO Matt McDonald, a 2005 graduate, emphasized that
FLiCKS is now a student group.
"It is no longer a business and much more of a service to the stu
dent population," McDonald said. "This model should help FLiCKs
sustain its history on campus and make the event more accessible to
everyone."
FLiCKs' financial troubles have substantially worsened since
2004. with the event losing thousands of dollars each year. McDon
ald attributed this downturn to students who may prefer to illegally
download movies from their dorm rooms than shell out $5 for ad
