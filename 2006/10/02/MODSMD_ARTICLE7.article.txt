# BEFORE THE FARM
## Students applaud SPOT Coordinators encourage more students to lead next year's hikes 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two weeks after completing a
five-day wilderness hike or a local
community service project, freshman
and transfer participants in the Stan
ford Pre-Orientation Trips (SPOT)
say the program has helped them
make a smooth transition to The
Farm.
"It's pretty sweet to walk around
campus and recognize faces and to
know upperclassmen and freshmen
that smile and say 'hi' when they see
you," said freshman Kai Larson, who
participated in the wilderness trip.
Junior Scott Schonfeld, a transfer
from Dartmouth, agreed.
"SPOT has made an otherwise
uneasy transition much more com
fortable." he said.
The program began in 2(K)3 and
has dramatically expanded over the
last four years â€” the first trip con
sisted of 29 transfer students, com
pared to a mix of 97 freshmen and
transfers this year. Coordinators
were so impressed with the pro
gram's success that they have intensi
fied recruitment efforts to find trip
leaders to make SPOT available for
next year's New Student Orienta
tion.
"Every incoming student at Stan
ford can benefit from an opportunity
to meet other students and learn
more about Stanford before Univer
sity orientation begins," said Geremy
Heitz, a graduate student and SPOT
co-coordinator. "We would love to
offer SPOT to more people, but we
need more wilderness trip leaders to
do so."
To become a wilderness trip
leader, students must complete a se
ries of classroom workshops, a six
teen-hour first aid course, and a four
day leader training trip. This fall.
Heitz and fellow coordinator Sarah
Rubinfeld. a graduate student, are
also teaching a 1 -unit course. Athlet
ics 87, for the first time, which will
allow students to receive credit for
all three requirements.
