## Editorial Support the team 
### 
For our first editorial of this volume, we.
The Stanford Daily Editorial Board,
could have written about a number of
pressing topics: the new pedestrian-only
zone in the Quad. Provost Etchemendy's re
cent Op-Ed in The New York Times about
the early action program or the rumors sur
rounding the possible sale of the West
Coast's beloved In-N-Out hamburger chain,
to name a few. Instead, we would like to
focus on the one issue that was foremost in
many Stanford minds over the weekend: the
state of the football team. But don't worry;
we'll get around to the other stuff, too.
Yes, they lost their fifth game in a row to
UCLA. And no. the schedule is not getting
any easier, especially with an away game at
Notre Dame next week. But it is still prema
ture to be jumping ship. It looks almost cer
tain that Stanford will not get to play in a
bowl game this year, but the team still de
serves support. It simply does not make
sense to be calling for Walt I larris' head, ig
noring the remaining games or scorning all
of the players.
We cannot argue that all is well. It is
painful to watch the unnecessary mistakes
and turnovers that have characterized the
team's play so far. or to see the team choose
to punt on third down against Washington
State and UCLA.The squad is off to its worst
start in more than two decades, and it is en
tirely possible that we could end this season
without a single victory. But being a fan is
about irrational support: it should not come
down to deciding whether to go to a game
based on the team's current record.
At least some of the struggle is due to is
sues largely out ot the coaches' and players'
control. A string of injuries, from Nick 112 rank
to Mark Bradford to Evan Moore, has been
particularly damaging to the line-up. But we
feel that much ol the discussion has unfairly
focused on the team's recruiting strategy,
from those who say that Stanford should
lower its admissions standards for players, to
those who say that the team's current per

formance calls into question the whole idea
of different academic standards for athletes.
In truth, the Athletic and Admissions de
partments have each done an admirable job
of walking the thin line between perform
ance and standards. Daily columnist Daniel
Novinson argued last week that "great aca
demic institutions with great football pro
grams like Berkeley. UC'LA or Michigan
have achieved their success by virtually
eliminating their athletics admissions stan
dards." And just yesterday, a columnist for
The New York Times suggested that "all
around the country, the quaint notion of a
student athlete has been stored in a hope
chest amid a fool's-gold pursuit of big-time
football." Our admissions office is often a
handicap to the football team, but it is one
that we should be proud of. Every varsity
sport, not just football, is forced to work
within constraints set by admissions and
turns down amazing athletes for the sake of
maintaining Stanford's academic integrity.
For this very reason, supporting the team
even when it is losing is crucial. The players
who did get in share dorms and classes with
everyone. As friends and classmates, they de
serve support that should not come into
question simply because football is a high
profile sport.
Besides, while flashes of brilliance are
rarer (okay, much more so), they still exist.
Witness the defenses successful goal-line
stands. Trent Edwards' scrambles and the
promising runs of freshman Toby Gerhart.
The season is far from over. Arizona and
()regon State are both games that are within
reach, and Stanford has shown the ability to
rattle powerhouses like Notre Dame and
USC nearly every year.
Finally, no matter what happens any
where else. Big Game is still the last game of
the year. A 1-11 season with victory over
Berkeley would be extremely gratifying. So
show some loyalty, Stanford fans, and hang
on until the end. The football team is stiil
your team, even when it is losing.
