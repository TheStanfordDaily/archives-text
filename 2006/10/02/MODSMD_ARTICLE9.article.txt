# Plan Afghanistan
## 
### 
In October of 2001, the United States mil
itary entered Afghanistan, heading an
international force and coordinating
with the Afghan Northern Alliance to de
stroy Al-Qaeda's base and unseat its gov
ernmental partner.theTaliban. At that time,
there was little political opposition to an
American-led war in Afghanistan, a quick
strike in the name of self-defense and retal
iation.
We are approaching the end of this the
fifth year of this war. Recent news head
lines have been as follows: "A Leading
Afghan Official Working on Women's
Rights Has Been Shot Dead in Kandahar,"
"Attacks in Afghanistan Grow More Fre
quent and Lethal" and "NATO calls for
more troops to fight Taliban." Remember
that this is not 2001 or 2002 â€” it's October
ot 2006. I "his is not the hiccup of a young
war. It's not another swing in an eternally
unstable and restless country. Rather, it's
the patiently planned and well-coordinat
ed second phase of the campaign to repel
and expel the Americans and their part
ners.
I"he unnerving thing about this second at
tempt is that it is renewable. Uprooting the
Taliban a second time won't be easy, because
it's not only a militia but a source of real po
litical clout in certain parts of the country.
Even if NATO can accomplish the task,
nothing is to prevent extremists from re
grouping in the remote region of the
Afghan-Pakistani border. Pakistan's Presi

dent Musharraf has established an uneasy
ceaselire with Taliban forces in this area,
called Wa/iristan.driven in part by a realistic
acknowledgment of Islamabad's weak au
thority in the region and in part by suspicion
of subversion from India via its massive lis
tening posts qua "consulates" in Kandahar
and Jalalabad. Following his recent meeting
with General Musharraf. President Bush has
made clear that American Special Forces
will not be taking the hunt for Osama bin
Laden into Pakistan, where most intelli
gence professionals believe he is currently
based.
It is five years in,halfway through Afghan
President Karzai's five-year mandate, dur
ing a springtime of violence and a flounder
ing of troop commitments. So now would be
a good time to ask: What's the plan for
Afghanistan? What are our goals and when
are we leaving?
The answer may be. hut should not be:
"building democracy." For all those who
