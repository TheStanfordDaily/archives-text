# Plan Afghanistan
## 
### 
In October of 2001, the United States mil
itary entered Afghanistan, heading an
international force and coordinating
with the Afghan Northern Alliance to de
stroy Al-Qaeda's base and unseat its gov
ernmental partner.theTaliban. At that time,
there was little political opposition to an
American-led war in Afghanistan, a quick
strike in the name of self-defense and retal
iation.
We are approaching the end of this the
fifth year of this war. Recent news head
lines have been as follows: "A Leading
Afghan Official Working on Women's
Rights Has Been Shot Dead in Kandahar,"
"Attacks in Afghanistan Grow More Fre
quent and Lethal" and "NATO calls for
more troops to fight Taliban." Remember
that this is not 2001 or 2002 — it's October
ot 2006. I "his is not the hiccup of a young
war. It's not another swing in an eternally
unstable and restless country. Rather, it's
the patiently planned and well-coordinat
ed second phase of the campaign to repel
and expel the Americans and their part
ners.
I"he unnerving thing about this second at
tempt is that it is renewable. Uprooting the
Taliban a second time won't be easy, because
it's not only a militia but a source of real po
litical clout in certain parts of the country.
Even if NATO can accomplish the task,
nothing is to prevent extremists from re
grouping in the remote region of the
Afghan-Pakistani border. Pakistan's Presi

dent Musharraf has established an uneasy
ceaselire with Taliban forces in this area,
called Wa/iristan.driven in part by a realistic
acknowledgment of Islamabad's weak au
thority in the region and in part by suspicion
of subversion from India via its massive lis
tening posts qua "consulates" in Kandahar
and Jalalabad. Following his recent meeting
with General Musharraf. President Bush has
made clear that American Special Forces
will not be taking the hunt for Osama bin
Laden into Pakistan, where most intelli
gence professionals believe he is currently
based.
It is five years in,halfway through Afghan
President Karzai's five-year mandate, dur
ing a springtime of violence and a flounder
ing of troop commitments. So now would be
a good time to ask: What's the plan for
Afghanistan? What are our goals and when
are we leaving?
The answer may be. hut should not be:
"building democracy." For all those who

bristle at this suggestion. I ask that
they first read I rcd Halliday's pre
-9/1 i article, "Soviet foreign policy
making and the Afghanistan war:
from 'second Mongolia' to bleeding
wound.'" T"his monograph discusses
the evolution of the USSR's policy
in Afghanistan during the Soviet in
vasion and great jihad 1979-89, dur
ing which bin Laden found his call
ing. It traces the original hopes of
creating a "second Mongolia" to the
grim confrontation of a bloody and
hopeless conflict.
What is a "second Mongolia?" In
1924, well before Eastern Europe
and the Baltic countries fell under
Stalin's hand, the Soviet Union in
stalled a Communist government in
Mongolia that was loyal to Moscow
and faithful to its ruling style. I lalf a
century later, Soviet leaders thought
that Afghanistan could also become
an ideal of single-party, socialist gov
ernment. and tried to establish a
Communist leadership as well as a
Marxist culture.
Just as the Soviets justified their
invasion with a historical success
story, a body of hopeful planners in
Washington backed up their recent
advocacy for the democratization of
the Middle East with glossy narra
tives of Japan and Germany. Is
America now waking up from Utopi
an optimism and a foggy historical
sense to find itself staring at a bleed
inti wound?

Many will point out that the
United States military is far more
advanced than the Soviet force of
1979, and that it benefits from that
example. Yet at a certain point, poli
tics must decide the outcome of bat
tles — politicians try to guess at a
reality, and soldiers get to tell them
how good that guess was. If in this
case the guess was that the United
States could democratize the Mid
dle Fast and the results would be
beneficial, the guess was wrong. If it
was indeed our intention to bring
them democracy, we could have
started with countries that were
more stable, that were closer to us or
that had a better economy, like
Egypt or Saudi Arabia. However,
we wouldn't push our friends in
these countries very hard, because
the prospect of their extremists
gaining power democratically is too
risky.
So what are we doing in
Afghanistan? Certainly not building
democracy. At best we have a tribal
oligarchy, at worst a piece of soft em
pire managed by Karzais. Money
and lives spent on teaching the lan
guage of democracy would be just as
poorly spent on teaching the lan
guage of Mongolia. The problem is
that, in leaving, we signal a victory to
the extremists. Unless, of course, we
achieve the goal that sent us to
Afghanistan in the first place. Unless
we get revenge, unless we get bin
Laden.
