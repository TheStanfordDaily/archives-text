## Editorial Board University should justify new bike policy 
### 
The bike ban mandated by the Univer
sity and implemented by the Depart
ment of Public Safety has left students
angry and confused ("Bike ban surprises
students." Sep. 2h and "Amidst success, bike
ban still irksome,"Oct.2).
Some students are angered by the conde
scension they feel is implied by the imple
mentation of this policy without visible stu
dent input. This is not exactly helped by the
policy's enforcement through bright yellow
flyers and T-shirts emblazoned with red cir
cles the international sign for "NO."
Meanwhile, other students are confused
by the unclear implementation of the policy.
Many don't know precisely what sort of bike
behavior constitutes an offense, or to which
specific areas ot the campus the bike ban ex
tends.
The new policy also creates inconven
iences. even for those eager to comply with
it. It is hard to get to some parts of the Quad
without biking across an arcade and the lack
of adequate bike racks in or around the
Quad, often forcing students to park their
bikes in the arcades.
But most of the confusion surrounding
the new policy arises from a lack of commu
nication concerning the reasons for the ban.
The policy seems to be designed to protect
everyone's safety, bikers and pedestrians
alike. Before the policy was implemented,
biking around the Quail was not without its
perils. Students biking down one of the
Quad's majestic sandstone arcades had no
clue what lay in store for them around the
corner — a hapless pedestrian or another
biker racing down the walkway at 20 mph.
Ihe policy ostensibly seeks to eliminate
this danger. And while the policy in its cur
rent form is an inconvenience for bikers, we
could see how reduced bike traffic could the
oretically benefit pedestrians.
But if the policy was indeed designed to

improve safety, then it would he hest em
ployed in tandem with an effort to increase
awareness of road rules and bike etiquette.
1 ( >r instance, bikers should be encouraged to
ride on the right side of the road and to indi
cate* their intentions to turn by using clear
hand signals. The Department of Public
Safety could go further by encouraging bik
ers to practice good bike safety, using bike
helmets and other safety gear. Bikers should
also ensure that their brakes are well main
tained and that they have working bike
lights installed.
(iiven the ambiguous origins of this policy,
we can't be entirely sure if it was implement
ed for reasons of safety or aesthetics. We
could assume that the policy will help reduce
the number of bike accidents in the Quad, al
though we don't know exactly how many se
rious bike accidents take place in the Quad to
begin with and how many of those accidents
occur specifically in the covered arcades.
Consequently, students don't know how
many accidents these new rules are supposed
to prevent and whether or not the amount
justifies the inconveniences caused by the
ban. Without such statistics to justify the poli
cy on safety grounds, the bike ban can easily
be interpreted as a scheme to eliminate the vi
sual clutter of bikes parked around the Quad.
Whatever the case, it is important for the
I niversity to clearly articulate the aim of the
policy through established channels like 'Hie
Daily and dorm mailing lists. Until the ad
ministration clearly communicates its aims
for this new policy.students are likely to view
it as nothing more than a nuisance.
Hie administration might also want to
consider opening up the issue to the student
body for discussion. Doing so would allow
students to consider if the risk of bike acci
dents is something they are willing to accept,
or it they would prefer having the Universi
ty manage those risks for them.
