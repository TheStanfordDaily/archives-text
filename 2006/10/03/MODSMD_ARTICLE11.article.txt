# Stranger Love

Can you fall in love at first sight? Ab
solutely. Doctor. I do it all the time.
You might say it's only true love when
she feels the same way. But technically, you
can't prove to me that anyone but me actu
ally exists. ITius. imagined passion is not so
fundamentally different from the real thing.
So just leave me be and go back to your cor
ner of existence. Plebe.
In fall quarter of freshman year, before
you return home and break the spell, every
thing can seem absurdly possible, especially
o a bright-eyed bov who hasn't gone to
ichool with girls since junior high. Said boy is
;o pure of heart he cries at "Love Actually."
\t some point in the first month or so. he
ees a girl. We'll call her Lily: it's a pretty
lower, and it has a little lovely lilting sound
hat dapples the tongue. It feels like every
iss you've never had.
Lily was not in my dorm or my I HUM
ection. so all my normal methods of hook
ippery were useless. Whenever I saw her at
party, she was surrounded by a) other hot
iris 1 didn t know; b) imposing Sigma ("his
/ho could crush me on their head like an
mpty can of cheap beer; or c) absolutely no

icr when I realized I could talk to her some

I — did she sec me? And then I pulled
>ut my cell phone and pretended to call
omeone very important.
Hi at was three years ago. I've exchanged

three words with her, including "hi "and "hi."
Now don't get me wrong here. I haven't been
lovesick puppydogging over this girl all that
time. It's a back of-the-mind thing, a once-a
month mental meander, a shadow memory
of nothing that wasn't even close to some
thing. ()i maybe it was as close as a casual
conversation, a "Iley, didn't I see you at the
( ol lo." or even a "Where do you live?"
1 know almost nothing about Lily except
what 1 occasionally read on her Facebook
page, (l adies and Gentlemen of the Jury.
our timid columnist has never even Friend
ed her.) What little I've overheard about her
allows that she's different from every other
iirl in my dating history. This makes her ut
erly wrong or perhaps exactly right for me.
In a sense, my non-relationship with Lily
ias gone far better than any of my actual rela
ionships. I ily still talks to me as much as she
.•ver has. and she never complains about me to
ler friends She's never written me a single ac-
