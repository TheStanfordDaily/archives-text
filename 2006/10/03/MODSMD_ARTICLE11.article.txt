# Stranger Love
## 
### 
Can you fall in love at first sight? Ab
solutely. Doctor. I do it all the time.
You might say it's only true love when
she feels the same way. But technically, you
can't prove to me that anyone but me actu
ally exists. ITius. imagined passion is not so
fundamentally different from the real thing.
So just leave me be and go back to your cor
ner of existence. Plebe.
In fall quarter of freshman year, before
you return home and break the spell, every
thing can seem absurdly possible, especially
o a bright-eyed bov who hasn't gone to
ichool with girls since junior high. Said boy is
;o pure of heart he cries at "Love Actually."
\t some point in the first month or so. he
ees a girl. We'll call her Lily: it's a pretty
lower, and it has a little lovely lilting sound
hat dapples the tongue. It feels like every
iss you've never had.
Lily was not in my dorm or my I HUM
ection. so all my normal methods of hook
ippery were useless. Whenever I saw her at
party, she was surrounded by a) other hot
iris 1 didn t know; b) imposing Sigma ("his
/ho could crush me on their head like an
mpty can of cheap beer; or c) absolutely no
•ne, and I was totally about to go and talk to
icr when I realized I could talk to her some
•ther time, some better time, maybe — OH
I — did she sec me? And then I pulled
>ut my cell phone and pretended to call
omeone very important.
Hi at was three years ago. I've exchanged

three words with her, including "hi "and "hi."
Now don't get me wrong here. I haven't been
lovesick puppydogging over this girl all that
time. It's a back of-the-mind thing, a once-a
month mental meander, a shadow memory
of nothing that wasn't even close to some
thing. ()i maybe it was as close as a casual
conversation, a "Iley, didn't I see you at the
( ol lo." or even a "Where do you live?"
1 know almost nothing about Lily except
what 1 occasionally read on her Facebook
page, (l adies and Gentlemen of the Jury.
our timid columnist has never even Friend
ed her.) What little I've overheard about her
allows that she's different from every other
iirl in my dating history. This makes her ut
erly wrong or perhaps exactly right for me.
In a sense, my non-relationship with Lily
ias gone far better than any of my actual rela
ionships. I ily still talks to me as much as she
.•ver has. and she never complains about me to
ler friends She's never written me a single ac-

cusatory e-mail, text message or wall
posting. She never peers at me with
awkward, hateful, disappointed eyes.
The sex isn't great. I'll admit, but
why's every thing got to come back to
sex with you ? Ilaven't you ever heard
about passion, you dick?
Whenever I see her walking with
someone else, girl or guy. 1 feel a bit
jealous. Not like that's my territory,
or that she belongs to me in any way.
It's more like unlucky awe at these
people who live in her plane of exis
tence. What am 1 to her? With our
small campus, with gossip and espe
cially with the Internet, we all know
people we don't really know. Do they
know us the same way? Or are we
just a few more random bikers,a per
son you see for four years and never
exchange a word with? A non-person
person. A face without a voice.
I sound a lot like a stalker. But the
repressed English major in me
prefers to think of Keats' "Ode on a
Grecian Urn." with two love-drunk
kids perched eternally on the edge of
a kiss, the ecstatic climax of imagined
glory before the bland finality of re
ality. (Freshmen, that's a free thesis
statement.)
Because I don't have any interest
in knowing Lily, not really. We walk
in different circles. We have none of
the same interests (nor favorite
movies, favorite TV shows, favorite
music or favorite quotes.) If she
swears, goes to the bathroom, or has
any independent thoughts, she's not
the girl I hope she is. Lily is a Catch

22: You know that if you talk to her
the illusion will fall, so you never talk
to her and keep on believing. It's pes
simistic optimism, or cynical roman
ticism, or all those words reversed.
You could point out that Gatsby
had the green light across the lake,
which would make Lily a metaphor
for the American Dream. You could
also say that just like there's a weird
comfort in strangers; there's a pleas
ant plush feeling in a romance that
never happens. Maybe she's a symbol
for our disconnection with our own
lives. Our dependence on fantasy in
this digital age, when you spend half a
day looking at a screen: a TV, a com
puter. a lecture with a PowerPoint
presentation, a cell phone. Maybe
she's an angel: proof that God exists,
or doesn't. Hell, maybe she's that one
person who keeps on appearing in the
background and then eventually re
veals that your whole life is a dream.
I'm holding out hope for our 10-
year reunion. I'll be the old-before
his-time print journalist coming off
an inevitable divorce or three, she'll
be the mother of two who did the
Stanford thing and married some
one from our class, probably a Josh
from the lacrosse team or a Sean
from the baseball team. Josh or Sean
now has a fantastic private practice
that's really taking off down in San
Diego (how else could she stay so
tan?) I tell him that's great, and then
shake Lily's hand, saying, "Have we
met?" She's a sweetheart, so she
says,"I think I remember you."
That's my girl.

Darren Franich bets you will ever
guess who Lily is, and he promises to
lie if you do. Give it a try anyways at
dfranich@stanford. edu.
