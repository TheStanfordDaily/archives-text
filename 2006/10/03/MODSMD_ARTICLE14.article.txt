# No Nobel

### 
The winner(s) of the Nobel Prize in
physics will he announced this morn
ing. Now. since this is being written yes
terday, 1 don't know who's going to win. Still,
1 can say with some certainty, it's not me.
Damn.
It may well be the case that at some un
specified point in an undefined future my
brilliance will be realised by the wider
Physics community and the appropriate ac
colades awarded. Or not.
Actually "not" is probably a shade more
likely."Brilliance" is not really my thing. I'm
more. well, "lazy" — doing things is terribly
crass, you know. Plus, I don't like to give peo
ple unreasonable expectations by showing
any achievement and/or progress.
The future failure of a Nobel Prize to land
on my mantelpiece is not a recent discovery
— I've been aware of my numerous limita
tions/inadequacies/nervous tics for a while.
However, given the events of the wider
world, it seemed appropriate to air this par
ticular neurosis today.
What is the point of academic endeav
our'.' In some ideal world (which is to say not
this one) we pursue abstract thought for no
other purpose than its own. We seek knowl
edge for the sake of knowledge, for sake of
curiosity.
In such a world, the reward for hard work
is understanding.There is a peculiar pleasure
in seeing the world and its contents through
progressively sharper lenses, a pleasure that
is. I suppose, without compare.
For some that feeling is enough. No other

recompense is needed.To know is sufficient.
In my more wistful (and less honest) mo
ments I like to pretend that all that drives me
is this quest for wisdom, that all 1 wish is for
the world to be explained and for me to un
derstand the explanation. In reality,though. 1
want glory.
I don't just want to know stuff. I want
other people to know that I know stuff. And
for them to know that because 1 know more
than they know, I'm better.
Even leaving aside the notion of being
worshipped (see my summer column "Small
Gods," Aug. 17) by the hoi polloi.one would
still like to be placed on a pedestal by one's
peers.
And it's not just being placed above.
There's also fear to think about. Apparently
(by which I mean, someone once told me in a
bar), there's a phenomenon called the "im
postor syndrome.'"lTie idea is (and again. per
son in bar is the source), many academic folk
live in constant fear of failure, of being ex
posed for the fakes that they believe they are.
1 figure this sort of attitude applies to well
over half the people I know, and if I restrict

myself to Ph.D. students in theoretical
physics, it's probably upwards of 80 percent.
ITtat's scary. And it really is at the heart of the
terror of grad school.
Your humble columnist (wow, that's a
lame cliche), and many wiser people, have
observed that graduate school is ultimately a
journey to know less and less about more
and more: You undergo ridiculous levels of
specialization along with gaining a gradual
awareness of just how much vou are unaware
of.
But that shrinking/growing is not enough
to destroy your soul by itself. No. what really
brings you down is the floundering feeling ot
inadequacy that couples itself to your aca
demic career.
And so we crave reassurance — sure,
knowledge, understanding and enlighten
ment are the goals, but without something to
cheer you on. it's damn hard not to collapse
along the way.
With that in mind, the realisation that the
chances ot being recognised, of being ac
knowledged. of being praised are basically
non-existent is a particularly nasty blow. And
one that is hard to recover from.
Ultimately I suppose that if you're not an
Albert l .instein.a Cornel West or a Howard
Bloom, you are probably doomed to both
leel inadequate and never to be told other
wise.
