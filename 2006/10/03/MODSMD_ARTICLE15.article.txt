# Guest Columnist: Michael Miller
## The 						road to seling out or why I work in consulting 
### 
I realized it in Barstow. We were
about to stop for lunch on our
pre-Thanksgiving trip to Vegas
when my girlfriend got a call from a
company where we had both inter
viewed. She was invited to Washing
ton D.C. for a final round. I could
hear the voice on the other end of
the line, and it was congratulatory. A
mixture of elation for her and worry
for me turned into misery when we
waited another half hour and I didn't
hear anything.
"They call the ones they accept
first.' I pointed out.
She reassured me that I couldn't
know and I would surely get it. but
we each knew that every minute that
ticked off meant I was less likely to
be in the running.
When I pulled over, I understood.
The interview three days earlier had
been such a mix. I'd shown up late, in
correctly guessing the exact amount
of time I needed to put between my

last class and a short drive off cam
pus. One of the interviewers had me
pinned as Ihe Daily's editor (not a
physics major, which I also am) and
wouldn't let me get in a single word.
But the other had been fascinated by
my story of how I determined why
betting on horse races would never
turn a profit while I was studying
complexity at the Santa Fe Institute.
I left the interview unsold. It was
just November. I didn't need a job
yet. and none of my friends had one.
But I signed up and went through a
do/en interviews anyway,just to test
the waters, to see if I could get hired.
I had six more months to find a job
somewhere I could make an impact;
I 'd work on physics at a national lab
or I 'd get a policy job in D.C. I surely
didn t want to work ;is hard as my fa
ther in corporate jobs, and two
weeks vacation seemed so short
after I'd spent five months of the last
s ear in South America.
But when I was describing the job
to my girlfriend's parents the next
evening. I started to realize that I'd
been hooked. I"he company was
small but worked on huge projects.
I 'd spend my time working on mean
ingful analysis, figuring out what
products sold the best and which
marketing campaigns were most ef
fective. It didn't appeal to my inner
humanitarian, but it seemed excit
ing. Two or three projects at a time,
each lasting a few months. It would
be like quarters all over again —
new challenges every other week.
But as we drove through the Mo
jave Desert, it wasn't looking good. I
realized then that I didn't need the
perfect job. but I did need the perfect
fit. It wasn't just any consulting com
pany. McKinsey or Bain wouldn't
have been right for me, someone
who's never thought about business
school and who couldn't care less
about how long it would take to
reach partner and make $S(X),(XX).
Ihe company that didn't call of
fered something I hadn't seen any
where else: the idea that its new em
ployees weren't commodities. It
made software to automate tedious
tasks that new graduates had to do at

other companies. No one ever men
tioned business school; credentials
didn't matter; what mattered was
what you could do. And I knew 1
could do it. If only they did.
A phone call woke me up from a
nap a few hours later. Groggy and
sad, I picked up the inevitable rejec
tion. I was stunned when the voice
told me that I too would be flying out
to D.C. in a week.
I never thought I'd be doing man
agement consulting when I left Stan
ford. 1 was going to be a journalist;
when internships (a necessary prel
ude to jobs) proved impossible to
find, 1 fell back to physics. But testing
a dozen exotic materials for magnet
ism at low temperatures seemed too
far from making a difference in
knowledge. So I ran off to South
America, considering international
journalism as an (ideal and unrealis
tic) possibility. Finally, I settled on
writing an honors thesis on nuclear
terrorism. Somewhere between
physics, politics and the ever-present
threat of nuclear weapons, there had
to be that right fit 1 that 1 had sought
during my four years on the Farm.
I"here may be in the future. But right
now, strangely enough. I'll take my
three weeks of vacation for an expe
rience in the real world.

made software to automate tedious
tasks that new graduates had to do at

other companies. No one ever men
tioned business school; credentials
didn't matter; what mattered was
what you could do. And I knew 1
could do it. If only they did.
A phone call woke me up from a
nap a few hours later. Groggy and
sad, I picked up the inevitable rejec
tion. I was stunned when the voice
told me that I too would be flying out
to D.C. in a week.
I never thought I'd be doing man
agement consulting when I left Stan
ford. 1 was going to be a journalist;
when internships (a necessary prel
ude to jobs) proved impossible to
find, 1 fell back to physics. But testing
a dozen exotic materials for magnet
ism at low temperatures seemed too
far from making a difference in
knowledge. So I ran off to South
America, considering international
journalism as an (ideal and unrealis
tic) possibility. Finally, I settled on
writing an honors thesis on nuclear
terrorism. Somewhere between
physics, politics and the ever-present
threat of nuclear weapons, there had
to be that right fit 1 that 1 had sought
during my four years on the Farm.
I"here may be in the future. But right
now, strangely enough. I'll take my
three weeks of vacation for an expe
rience in the real world.
