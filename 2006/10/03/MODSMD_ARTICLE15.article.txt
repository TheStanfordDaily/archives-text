## The
						road to seling out or why I work in consulting 
### 
I realized it in Barstow. We were
about to stop for lunch on our
pre-Thanksgiving trip to Vegas
when my girlfriend got a call from a
company where we had both inter
viewed. She was invited to Washing
ton D.C. for a final round. I could
hear the voice on the other end of
the line, and it was congratulatory. A
mixture of elation for her and worry
for me turned into misery when we
waited another half hour and I didn't
hear anything.
"They call the ones they accept
first.' I pointed out.
She reassured me that I couldn't
know and I would surely get it. but
we each knew that every minute that
ticked off meant I was less likely to
be in the running.
When I pulled over, I understood.
The interview three days earlier had
been such a mix. I'd shown up late, in
correctly guessing the exact amount
of time I needed to put between my

last class and a short drive off cam
pus. One of the interviewers had me
pinned as Ihe Daily's editor (not a
physics major, which I also am) and
wouldn't let me get in a single word.
But the other had been fascinated by
my story of how I determined why
betting on horse races would never
turn a profit while I was studying
complexity at the Santa Fe Institute.
I left the interview unsold. It was
just November. I didn't need a job
yet. and none of my friends had one.
But I signed up and went through a
do/en interviews anyway,just to test
the waters, to see if I could get hired.
I had six more months to find a job
somewhere I could make an impact;
I 'd work on physics at a national lab
or I 'd get a policy job in D.C. I surely
didn t want to work ;is hard as my fa
ther in corporate jobs, and two
weeks vacation seemed so short
