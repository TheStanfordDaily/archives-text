In yesterday's paper, The
Daily's Editorial Board urged
students to support the foot
ball team, regardless of their
record, and cited Stanford's
admission policy as a possible
reason for the team's perform
ance. Readers reacted:

Be proud of the admissions' pol
icy? You'll he proud,all right. Right
down to the 0-12 season, dismal re
cruiting and a future with zero
hope of returning to a Rose Bowl
game.

The admissions policy is just a
poor excuse that gives us Stanford
fans some consolation to medioc
rity. Stanford has had tremendous
athletic success in spite of the ad
missions policies in all sports in
cluding the big two: basketball and

football. What it comes down to is
good coaching, which Stanford is
severely lacking in the big two.
Don't tell me the admissions policy
prevented our basketball team
from winning the championship all
those years we were in the Final
four or that Walsh and Willingham
were hurt by it. CAL used that ex
cuse during the Tom Holmoe
years, but hasn't dropped its stan
dards at all when Tedford joined
their program. The difference was
coaching. Wake up Stanford fans
and demand a coaching regime
change.

Your admissions policy is money
= acceptance. No, not for everyone
to be sure, but let's not pretend like
the admission policy at Stanford is
the goal we should all be reaching
for.

What we are seeing now is the
product of four years of Buddy
Teevens' recruiting. We need to

just stick through this really tough
year and hope that Coach Harris
can up the quality of the talent on
the field over the next couple of
years.

"Your admissions policy is
money = acceptance." It's a pet
peeve of mine to read comments
iike this from uninformed sources.
They don't know how our admis
sions work, but they assign the
worst possible motives to make
themselves feel better.

You need an offensive line that can
block for Gerhart.That is just some of
the worst run blockingthat I've seen in
quite some time. You have to wonder
whether or not he's second-guessing
his decision to come to Stanford.

I applaud the Editorial Board for
its support for the football program
and its players and coaches, and the
fact the board devoted the first edi

torial of the current volume to these
topics speaks highly of The Daily's
enthusiasm for Stanford athletics
and its appreciation for the impor
tance of athletics in the culture of
the University. 1 was disappointed,
however, that the Board gave a free
pass to the admissions office and
those responsible for that office's
policies and their implementation.

Walshadmirer. clearly you don't
have your facts straight. Tedford en
joyed the luxury of being able to
bring in talent from JCs, something
Stanford can t. What people don't re
alize is that admission standards
have been on the rise for athletes.
Hiat means they're higher than they
were when we went to the Final
Four, Rose Bowl. etc.
