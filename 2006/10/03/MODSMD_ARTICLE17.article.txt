## CARD FORCED TO DOUBLE UP Men's hopefuls out in qualifying singles draw, prepare for first doubles round 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Though Stanford couldn't quite get it started in Tulsa, Okla.,
yesterday, it hopes to improve today at the Polo All-American
Tennis Championships. Two members of the Stanford men's
tennis team, sophomore Blake Muller and freshman Richard
Wire, traveled to the University of Tulsa for the event, but both
exited in the first round of the qualifying singles draw on Mon
day. The duo will team up and compete in the qualies of dou
bles this afternoon.
No. 90 Max Jones of New Mexico handed Muller a 6-4,6-1
defeat yesterday afternoon in the first round of the qualifying
draw. The Lobos have proven to be a thorn in the Cardinal's
side in recent years at the All-American tournament. Last year,
senior James Wan and sophomore Matt Bruch suffered a loss
in doubles to a pair from New Mexico, and in 2004, recent grad
uate KC Corkery and former Stanford player Sam Warburg
fell to a Lobos pair in the Round of 16 of the tournament.
An hour and a half after Muller's loss, Wire hit the court in
his collegiate debut against Vanderbilt's Evan Dufaux. Wire
picked up his first set in a tiebreaker, but the Commodore re
bounded and snagged the subsequent sets for a 6-7 (7), 6-2,6-3
defeat over the Stanford freshman.
Players who compete in the 128-person qualifying draw
must win three matches in order to earn a spot in the tourna
ments main draw. Despite the larger pool of players in the
qualifying draw, head coach John Whitlinger expected the level
of play to be top-notch as well.
"This qualifying tournament should be as good as the main

draw," Whitlinger
said on Sunday.
"There are so many
good players in col-

lege tennis now; you better be ready to play every
match.There are guys in the qualies that nobody re
ally knows about because they're freshmen — a guy
like Matt Bruch last year. Nobody really knew

what to expect."
In his collegiate
debut in 2005,
Bruch won seven
straight matches in
the qualifying rounds

through the main draw and eventually fell

in a tight 7-6,6-4 match in the semifinals to the eventual cham
pion, Georgia's No. 2 John Isner.
In the first round of doubles action today, Muller and Wire
will face a duo from Baylor. Bears sophomore Matt Brown and
Muller matched up for the final and deciding singles match in a
quarterfinal showdown between Baylor and Stanford last May
during the NCAA Championships. Brown ultimately clinched
the match for the Bears in a three-set. 7-6,1-6,6-3, victory.
"It's a new year; last year's done."Whitlinger said. "Any time
we play anybody from a team that's going to be ranked really

high, wc get pumped for it. We want to heat
these guys — I don't care if they're from Baylor
or C'al or wherever."
The remainder of the Stanford squad travels

to Santa Clara on Friday to compete in the Bron
co Classic. Seniors Eric McKean and Dave Ryan,
junior Chris Rasmussen, sophomore Jeff Zeller

and freshmen Kevin Kaiser and Paul Mor
rissey will enter singles as well as doubles
competition.

While the Ail-American and the
Bronco Classic fall shortly after Stanford
starts classes. Whitlinger thinks the team

will be ready to jump right into its matches.

"[ Ilie tournaments are] early for us." Whitlinger said

"It's not early for a lot of schools since their teams have been
going since the first of September, but it's a good way to start
and gets our guys' attention very quickly.
"Guys are either playing [in TUlsa] or are going to play in
Santa Clara, so it's a quick start," Whitlinger continued. "The
guys have been practicing on their own before school started so
a lot of guys are in pretty good shape and are ready to play. I'm
very pleased with the work ethic that this team has shown out
side of practice time. They've been coming out on their own
and hitting a little extra and that's what you need to do."
