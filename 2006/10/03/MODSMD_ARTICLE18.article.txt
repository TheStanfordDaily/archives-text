## Polo drops fourth-straight at UCLA Two losses to UCLA drop Card from fourth to sixth, Cal up next 
### ANDREW SHEN STAFF WRITER 
The sixth-ranked Stanford men's water polo team lost to
No. 3 UCLA by a score of 10-8 Saturday at the Rose Bowl
Aquatics Center in Pasadena, Calif. The Cardinal are now 5-4,
having dropped four-straight games after beginning the sea
son undefeated.
Unlike the other recent Cardinal losses, in which Stanford
relinquished leads late in the game, the men were left trailing
early on Saturday. After a 2-2 tie in the first quarter, the begin
ning of the second quarter belonged to the Bruins (6-1), who
pulled ahead 5-2 with 3:05 remaining in the half. It was a lead
they wouldn't relinquish for the rest of the game.
The three goals were left unanswered until the very end of
the half, when Stanford succeeded in cutting the lead to two.
The Cardinal further developed their momentum,coming out
shooting in the third quarter, with a goal by sophomore utility
Will Hindle-Katel that Stanford down only 7-6.
Following another UCLA goal, this time by red-shirt sen
ior defender Brad Greiner, freshman utility Drac Wigo an
swered with a goal of his own to keep the Cardinal going. But
playing a strong defense and conservative offense, it was the
closest Stanford would again come to matching UCLA.
