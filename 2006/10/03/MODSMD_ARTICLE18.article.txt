# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Polo drops fourth-straight at UCLA Two losses to UCLA drop Card from fourth to sixth, Cal up next 
### ANDREW SHEN STAFF WRITER 
The sixth-ranked Stanford men's water polo team lost to
No. 3 UCLA by a score of 10-8 Saturday at the Rose Bowl
Aquatics Center in Pasadena, Calif. The Cardinal are now 5-4,
having dropped four-straight games after beginning the sea
son undefeated.
Unlike the other recent Cardinal losses, in which Stanford
relinquished leads late in the game, the men were left trailing
early on Saturday. After a 2-2 tie in the first quarter, the begin
ning of the second quarter belonged to the Bruins (6-1), who
pulled ahead 5-2 with 3:05 remaining in the half. It was a lead
they wouldn't relinquish for the rest of the game.
The three goals were left unanswered until the very end of
the half, when Stanford succeeded in cutting the lead to two.
The Cardinal further developed their momentum,coming out
shooting in the third quarter, with a goal by sophomore utility
Will Hindle-Katel that Stanford down only 7-6.
Following another UCLA goal, this time by red-shirt sen
ior defender Brad Greiner, freshman utility Drac Wigo an
swered with a goal of his own to keep the Cardinal going. But
playing a strong defense and conservative offense, it was the
closest Stanford would again come to matching UCLA.

Redshirt junior Forest Schwartz readies for a throw. The No. 6 men's water polo team has suffered from four straight losses, includ
ing two to No. 3 UCLA, after beginning the season undefeated.
After three quarters, the Bruins
led V-7. UCLA sophomore Scott
Davidson increased the lead to
three, which Hindle-Katel then re
duced to two with the last goal of the
night.
Along with senior captain JJ Gar
ton and Wigo. Hindle-Katel paced
the Cardinal with two goals a piece.
Junior Michael Bury and freshman
utility Janson Wigo each chipped in
with one goal as well.
Starting junior goalie Sandy Ho
hener recorded six saves and al
lowed six goals in one half of play
Backup sophomore goalie Jimmie
Sandman played the second half,
notching live saves and allowing
four goals, albeit against a UCLA
team playing with a lead late in the
game.
In the last meeting between the
two teams, Stanford contained
U( LA star attackers sophomore
Krsto Sbutega and senior Logan
Powell, holding them to only one
goal. Again, the Cardinal's efforts
were respectable, allowing Sbutega
two goals, while shutting out Powell.

Sbutega was particularly aggressive,
attempting a game-high six shots.
Goal-keeping, as expected, was a
strong point ior the Bruins. A recent
ly named starter, senior Will
Didinger saved nine shots and is now
4-0 since joining the lineup. Among
his impressive saves was the rejec
tion of a close-range Janson Wigo
shot with only 30 seconds left in the
game.
UCLA sophomore Scott David
son again burned the Cardinal, scor
ing two goals.Though he has only six
goals total this season, Davidson has
had four come against Stanford. The
Cardinal did not make the proper
adjustments for him for this second
match, and Stanford's own surprise
shooter, freshman driver Sage
Wright, failed to repeat his one-goal
performance in the teams' first
meeting.
While the Cardinal were able to
handle UCLA's top scorers, the Bru
ins took a page out of Stanford's
book by using a balanced offensive
attack, as seven different players
scored without any individual scor
ing more than twice.
"We feel we are better than those
guys and better than our record
shows right now," junior Peter Fin
layson said. "As far as the UCLA
game goes, we can take some solace

in the fact that as a team we didn't
play our best water polo, and we
were just a goal or two away from
heating those guys. A couple of guys
had good games, hut we weren't
doing a lot of the little things that
make us great."
Still, the young Stanford squad
has enough faith to believe the sea
son is far from lost.
"Even though it was a hard loss, I
think we're starting to really play
well as a team, but we're not quite
there yet." Drac Wigo said. "We are
getting so much better as time pro
gresses. 1 know that soon we can beat
any team."
The team will need that kind of
conviction when it faces No. 2 Cal at
Berkeley next Saturday.
