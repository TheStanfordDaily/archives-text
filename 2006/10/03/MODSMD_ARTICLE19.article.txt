# Blue rules the Bay

### 
This past Saturday I partook in
the greatest party my eyes
have ever seen — and I wasn't
even anywhere near Sigma Nu.
With my dorm's residents scav
enging throughout the City by the
Bay. 1 had earned just enough time to
buy a $20, standing-room-only ticket
from a scalper for the Dodgers-Gi
ants game at AT&T Park.
Just one night after being heckled
by Giants fans for my Rafael Furcal
jersey and oversized blue foam fin
ger during an improbable Dodger
comeback, I found myself this time
surrounded by blue — towels, hats,
jerseys, banners, face paint and plen
ty of wide smiles amidst the gloomy
expressions of the fair-weather or
ange and black. Yes, my blue
brethren had joined me on this won
derful day — a day that the mighty
Dodgers would clinch a playoff spot
over the vile Hated Ones, a day 1
would see the loyal fans of the Azul
dance in the streets of San Francisco
and climb the Willie Mays statue in
conquest, the one day on which
AT&T Park was truly Dodger Stadi
um.
But the celebration was short
lived. My Boys in Blue were prompt
ly robbed of their rightful National
League West championship the next
day, as a controversial reversal of a
call granted the Padres a win over
the Diamondbacks in the regular
season finale, giving the Friars the
title in the process. My elation was
also ruined by the realization that
the Dodgers would open up their
road to the 2006 World Series with a
trip to New York to face the class of
the National League: the Mets. But 1
stand firm beside my preseason pre
diction that the Dodgers will win the
NLCS en route to a 1988-like World
Series.
While many of my contempo
raries will shrug off the Dodgers as
mere fodder for the talented Mets.
the deadly duo of Derek Lowe and
Greg Maddux should present quite
the challenge for a loaded New York
lineup. Lowe gave up two runs in six
innings in the Dodgers' 8-5 win over
the Mets at Chavez Ravine earlier in
the season. Maddux, meanwhile, was
barely outdone by Orlando I lernan
dez, 3-2. at Shea Stadium three
months later.
Lowe has since improved to an
overall 16-8, landing him a tie for
tops in the NL in wins — not to men
tion his 3.63 F : .RA. Mad Dog, mean
while, has pitched gem after gem.
going 6-3 with a 3.30 ERA in Los An
geles. Throw in potential starter
Hong-Chih kuo — the man who
pitched six scoreless innings in New
York on Sept. 8 — and you have
three more-than-solid pitchers that
can each bewilder the Mets' lineup.
The loss of Pedro Martinez leaves
New York with Tom Glavine and an
11-11 Orlando Hernandez with a
