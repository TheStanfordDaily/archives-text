### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The dust had barely settled on the
University's labor battles with the Ser
vice Employees International Union
when an event organized by the Engi
neering School at the winery of one of
its most famous alumni was marked by
another labor dispute.
Last Saturday afternoon, alumni of
the Engineering School attended an an

nual wine tasting party at the Charles
Krug winery owned by Peter Mondavi,
a graduate of the class of l l )36. Usually,
the event is a casual weekend party and
a chance for graduates to touch base.
This year, they were greeted at Mon
davi's gates by protesting farm workers
armed with flyers and signs.
"About two to three times a week,
we stage protests in front of the win
ery." said Robert Garcia, coordinator
for the Santa Rosa office of the United
Farm Workers (IJFW). His organiza
tion has taken the lead in organizing a
boycott of Mondavi's wines.
On July 7, after months of negotia
tions and increasing tensions, the
Charles Kruu winery fired 36 workers

and turned its daily operations over to a
subcontractor. Some of these 36 work
ers had been employees of the winery
for more than 20 years.
Soon after, UFW began a boycott of
Mondavi's products According to Gar
cia, it has had a visible impact on sales
and visits to the winery. He cited a spe
cial promotion pushed by the winery in
grocery stores as evidence that they
were trying to bolster their revenue.
Calls placed to the Charles Krug
Winery for comments on this story
went unanswered by press time.
Along with the boycott, UFW has
continued protesting at Mondavi's win
ery in St. Helena, Calif.This weekend's
protest was specifically targeted at the

Stanford alumni.
"All through the week, we were con
tacting folks at Stanford about the situ
ation with Mondavi." said Garcia. At
tendees. he said, took notice of the
protests.
Before Saturday. UFW had contact
ed the Engineering School, which or
ganizes the wine-tasting event every
year. However, the University refused
to cancel or postpone the wine tasting
this year.
"Saturday's activity is an annual
event that was planned long ago, before
we became aware of these [labor] is

munications and PR manager at the
Engineering School, in an email that
Garcia provided The Daily. "We
don't feel it is appropriate to take
sides in this dispute and therefore
feel it is best not to change long
standing plans because of it."
Orenstein said he hoped that the
winery and workers will work some
thing out.
"At the same time, we do under
stand the desire of workers to work
and to seek the best opportunities

they can," he wrote. "We hope the
workers and the winery can come to
some resolution that they both con
sider positive."
Garcia said he is also asking for
students' support for the boycott.
"We're just requesting folks for
support," he said. "No drinking
Mondavi wine."
The Charles Krug winery, which
calls itself "the first [winery] in Napa
Valley," was established in 1861.
After serving in the Second World
War, Mondavi returned home to St.
Helena to help run the winery his
family had bought in 1943.The own
ership of the winery passed into his
hands after his mother died in 1966.
