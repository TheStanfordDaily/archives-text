No. 3 USC 28, Washington State 22
The Cougars defended their home
field well against the reigning Pac-10
champs, taking the Trojans to the final
horn. Trailing 28-22, Washington State
quarterback Alex Brink launched a po
tentially game-winning Hail Mary pass
as the clock expired, but it was inter
cepted by USC safety Taylor Mays at
the four-yard line to close out the Tro
jans' win.
IJSC was forced to play without the
Pac-10's all-time touchdown reception
leader. Dwayne Jarrett, who was held
out after suffering a shoulder injury in
last week's 20-3 win over Arizona.
Steve Smith, the Trojans' usual No. 2

receiver, stepped up in his absence,
collecting 186 yards and two touch
downs on 11 catches. Smith had just 12
catches in the Trojans' first three
games.
Brink had an impressive perform
ance, nearly single-handedly keeping
the Cougars in the game when USC
seemed to have clinched it. Trailing
28-15 late in the fourth quarter, Brink
led the Cougars on a seven-play. 80-
yard drive that culminated in a 10-
yard touchdown pass to Dwight
Tardy.
The Trojans (4-0. 1-0 Pac-10) have
now won 49 of their last 51 games, and
18consecutive on the road. Washington
State (3-2, 1-1) heads to Corvallis to
face Oregon State next week.
