Walking through the front door of the main building,
students will enter a lively living room with sofas, flat
screen televisions and seating. The first floor will also
house the Associated Students of Stanford University
\SSI ). a cafe operated by Stanford Dining and six new
meeting rooms, with priority given to registered student
organizations. I wo new patios — a formal one with din
ing tables extending from the cafe and a more casual one
extending from the ASSU offices — will round out the
first floor.
Hiis week will bring the Old Union project to life,"
Smith-1 aws said."B\ seeing the color pallets and the tex
ture. shapes and designs of the furniture, 1 hope students
begin to get excited about the vibrant student program
ming space that is soon to come."
Students can reach the second floor by climbing a new
stairwell designed to make the space more welcoming.
ITie second floor of the main building will house the Of
tice ol Student Activities (OSA) and serve as a new hub
for student activity by providing student organization of
fice space, a multipurpose rehearsal room, and flexible
student workspaces. Many will offer high-end technolo
gy including flat-screen monitors. DVD/VCR players
and computer connectivity Hie third floor will be the
new home of the Office for Religious Life, providing a

sanctuary as well as assembly and prayer space.
The Clubhouse will continue to feature the first-floor
ballroom, with space reservation priority given to the
building's two occupants, the Native American Cultural
Center and the Asian American Activities Center. Both
centers will have larger libraries and meeting space for
students, which will also be available to other registered
student groups.
ITie Nitery ground floor will again be the home of El
Centro Chicano with a new location for the lounge,
which will now face the Stanford Bookstore. The Stan
ford Chaparral will move from the Storke Publications
Building to the Nitery first floor, where there will final
ly be much-needed publication delivery space. The the
ater and other space occupied by the Drama Depart
ment were not part of the renovation project. The sec
ond floor will host Innovative Student Information Ser
vices and space to produce and publish the Stanford Di
rectory. which will be made available to other campus
media groups.
In addition, throughout the entire renovation project,
administrators and students have been trying to deter
mine the role of Tresidder Student Union, Old Union's
current neighbor, once the project is finished. Smith-
Laws said that town hall meetings concerning this issue
will be held during fall quarter.
"We are working with a consultant to determine what
Tresidder should be," Smith-Laws said. "Both Tresidder
and Old Union should provide services that complement
each other. In the meantime, we encourage students to
drop by the second floor of Tresidder and try out the fur
niture and tell us what they think."
