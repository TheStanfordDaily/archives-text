# CAMPUS LIFE
## iTunes U connects students to classes Downloads over 100,000 Attendance effect questioned

For the archetypical Stanford student
with 25 hours of work in a 24-hour day. a
popular music program may be making life
easier.
iTunes U,a service that allows students to
listen or view lectures for classes through
the iTUnes Music Store, is gaining a foothold
at Stanford, and students across campus are
loading their lectures into iPods and listen
ing on the go.
Dr. Victoria Szabo.the academic technol
ogy manager for the Office of the Provost
for Undergraduate Education, stressed the
program's accessibility.
"We wanted to get digital content togeth
er in a form that would be easy to access and
manage." Szabo wrote on Apple's iTUnes
website. "iTunes U offers an environment
that made that possible for us."
At Stanford, the program began with
1 HUM courses.but has now branched out to

include â„¢
a variety of academic
subjects. The sen ice
was initially intended for
alumni, but now students
and even the general public
can use iTUnes U. There have been
over 100,000 downloads off Stanford's
iTUnes page.
Classes aren't the only Stanford-specif
ic downloads available. Web surfers can .
watch Tom Brokaw's 2006 commence- u
ment address and last February's visit from "
the Dalai Lama.
And Stanford is not the only school par
ticipating.
The University of Michigan's School of
Dentistry now uses mines U to post lec
tures. Likewise, UC-Berkeley will be using
Google to broadcast lectures and other aca
demic resources. The Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology is using its Open Course
Initiative to distribute videos and lectures
recordings to the general public.
While non-students have access to cer
tain lectures and video, Stanford students
can use their SUID to access more specific
content. Because of its exclusivity and on-

line natun , students
have compared i'Tunes
U to Goursework.
Many students who
have heard of the service
expressed enthusiasm,
though most had reserva
tions as well.
"It s<mnds like it could
be useful." said freshman
Andrew Beck. He added,
however, that the service
would not substitute for
going to classes, lest he "gel
distracted bv his surround

ings" while listening to iTunes I
Freshman Scott Bland was similarly
mixed.
"I will definitely use it,"said Bland, won
dering whether it would cause professors to
grow upset if students stopped attending
their courses.
Junior Sonia Singh said she believes
iTUnes U will help her with classes. I "hough
her human biology course is already record
ed.she used to have to retrieve it from the li
brary. Now.it is just a mouse click away.
