# Students help nation face AIDS
## Trip to Africa inspires three seniors to drop out of Stanford, start a grass-roots movement 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a world where every
celebrity has her own humani
tarian cause and every busi
ness tycoon his own aid organ
ization. it can be difficult for a
grass-roots charity to make its
mark. But for the past year,
three Stanford students have
managed to raise $250,000
through FACE AIDS, their ef
fort to mobilize students in the

fight against the disease in Africa.
Hie project, which hopes to raise $1 million by the end of
200b, has spread nationally to include more than 85 colleges.
The money will be given to Partners in Health, a non-profit cor
poration aimed at dealing with AIDS and woman's health is
sues. Senior Johnny Dorsey, the co/ounder and executive direc
tor of FACE AIDS runs the effort with a team of 37 Stanford
students, coordinating local and national events from campus.
"We've got a good infrastructure going and we've got some
ridiculous events planned at Stanford." he said. "We only have
about nine weeks but that's enough time to raise the money and
create this global network to spread awareness about AIDS."
The campaign was born in the summer of 2005 when then
juniors Dorsey, Lauren Young and Katie Bollbach traveled to
Zambia on a Stanford-sponsored service trip. All three arrived
with different agendas, but were quickly united by their com
mon concern over the epidemic.
"We were all there doing different programs that had
nothing to do with AIDS," Bollbach said. "But it's tough to be
in Africa and not become immediately aware of the effect that
the epidemic is having all around you."
A meeting with Mama Katele. an HIV-positive grandmoth
er struggling to feed her impoverished family, would inspire the
trio to take the next year off from school.
"We really wanted to find a way to help her make an in
come," Bollbach said. "And we thought there must be a way we
can help more people in her situation. We were all sitting on the
porch of our house one night, and within a few hours I had de
cided to stay the year in Zambia, and Johnny and Lauren had
decided to take the year off and work on this."

Bill Gates' recent $500 million dona
tion to the Global Fund. FACE
AIDS contribution is small, but
Dorsey said it's more about the mes
sage than the money.
"In comparison to gifts like
Gates', of course a million dollars is
not that much and of course it won't
reach the people his funding will," he
said. "But Gates' money will literally
lead to a vaccine, and what I'm much
more passionate about is showing
students the impact on individuals
that this money is having."
Dorsey said just $140 can treat an
HIV-positive individual for an entire
year.
FACE AIDS Managing Editor
Cindy Prieto. a senior, attributed
much of the project's success to an
emphasis on long-term results.
"7be thing that differentiates us
from other organizations is that
we're less about creating noise and
trying to get our voices heard in
government, and more about trying
to create a long-term movement
that gets students interested in the
issue, so that 10. 15. 20 years down
the line we will have created a een

eration of informed citizens." Pri
eto said.
Last fall. FACE AIDS chose Part
ners in Health as the beneficiary of
its fundraising because of its similar
ities to FACE AIDS. Dorsey said.
"It was students who started this
corporation [Partners in Health]
that has now changed global policy."
he said. "They have already affected
millions of lives. You can't beat that
in terms of inspiration."
In addition to the pins. FACE
AIDS hopes to raise money and
spread awareness through a number
of events in and around Stanford.
Enthusiasm on campus has in
creased significantly this year, due in
part to the freshman reading re
quirement of Tracy Kidder's "Moun
tains Beyond Mountains." the story
of Harvard professor Paul Farmer
and his fight against infectious dis
ease. FACE AIDS now boasts an
email list of more than 500 students.
"We have this golden opportunitv
of a captive audience right now." said
senior Katie Rocha. Director of
Events. "All the events this fall are
meant to capitalize on this."

Dorsey proposed that
Mama Katele and other villagers
sew beaded pins to support them
selves. He viewed the task as a flexi
ble income opportunity, allowing
HIV victims to earn money without
straining their health.
"Ibe hope was that the dis
tinctive pins, a red AIDS ribbon on a
white background, would catch on.
much like Lance Armstrong's Live
strong wristbands. Thus far. the
group has sold a little more than
3.000 pins at five dollars apiece. With
the new national expansion, they
hope to sell 50.000 by January.
"We're attacking the prob
lem on three levels." Bollbach said.
"We're working directly with
African individuals infected with the
virus, fundraising through the pins
and various events and educating
people about what's going on."
