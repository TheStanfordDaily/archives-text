## Trip to Africa inspires three seniors to drop out of Stanford, start a grass-roots movement 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a world where every
celebrity has her own humani
tarian cause and every busi
ness tycoon his own aid organ
ization. it can be difficult for a
grass-roots charity to make its
mark. But for the past year,
three Stanford students have
managed to raise $250,000
through FACE AIDS, their ef
fort to mobilize students in the

fight against the disease in Africa.
Hie project, which hopes to raise $1 million by the end of
200b, has spread nationally to include more than 85 colleges.
The money will be given to Partners in Health, a non-profit cor
poration aimed at dealing with AIDS and woman's health is
sues. Senior Johnny Dorsey, the co/ounder and executive direc
tor of FACE AIDS runs the effort with a team of 37 Stanford
students, coordinating local and national events from campus.
"We've got a good infrastructure going and we've got some
ridiculous events planned at Stanford." he said. "We only have
about nine weeks but that's enough time to raise the money and
create this global network to spread awareness about AIDS."
The campaign was born in the summer of 2005 when then
juniors Dorsey, Lauren Young and Katie Bollbach traveled to
Zambia on a Stanford-sponsored service trip. All three arrived
with different agendas, but were quickly united by their com
mon concern over the epidemic.
"We were all there doing different programs that had
nothing to do with AIDS," Bollbach said. "But it's tough to be
in Africa and not become immediately aware of the effect that
the epidemic is having all around you."
A meeting with Mama Katele. an HIV-positive grandmoth
er struggling to feed her impoverished family, would inspire the
trio to take the next year off from school.
"We really wanted to find a way to help her make an in
come," Bollbach said. "And we thought there must be a way we
can help more people in her situation. We were all sitting on the
porch of our house one night, and within a few hours I had de
cided to stay the year in Zambia, and Johnny and Lauren had
decided to take the year off and work on this."
