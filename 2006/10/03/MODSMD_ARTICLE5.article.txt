## Fire up the Nobel Prize Med. School Professor claims award in physiology and medicine 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Make space on Stanford's trophy shelf for
another mantelpiece from Stockholm. Profes
sor Andrew Fire of the School of Medicine
wa awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiol
ogy and Medicine early Monday morning.
In 1998, when Prof.Fire was at the Carnegie

Institution of Washington, he and fellow win
ner Craig Mello, professor at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School, published
their discovery of what is now known as RNA
interference or gene silencing.
Usually, genetic information stored in
DNA is transmitted to the protein synthesiz
ing parts of a cell by messenger RNA, or
mRNA. Sometimes, however, this process is
interrupted.
Fire and Mello discovered that this inter-
ruption occurs when RNA appears
as a double-stranded molecule. In
jecting certain double-stranded
RNA into cells, they found, deacti
vates mRNA with a similar chemical
sequence and prevents the produc
tion of that protein.
"The most immediate benefit [of
RNA interference] is going to be

doing experiments that teach us
things," Fire said in a telephone in
terview with Nobelprize.org fol
lowing the announcement of his
award.
He said found out about the
award when the phone rang in the
kitchen early Monday morning.
"Well, one's elated, but science is
a big thing," he told Nobelprize.org
of his first reaction. "So, you immedi
ately think of all the people that have
helped make it happen and think
about the fact that you're still a pret
ty small cog in a pretty big wheel."

Fire and Mello were awarded a
Nobel Prize only eight years after
their discovery, a usually short peri
od. Last year's laureates had made
their discovery in 1982.
Fire was born at Stanford Hospi
tal and raised in Sunnyvale, Calif. He
attended UC-Berkeley and received
a bachelor's degree in mathematics
in 1978 at the age of 19. He received
a PhD in biology from MIT in 1983
and started working at the Carnegie
Institution of Washington in 1986,
before joining the Stanford faculty in
2003.
