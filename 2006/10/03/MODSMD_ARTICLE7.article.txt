# YAHOO DONATION TO KNIGHT DRAWS FIRE
## 
### 
Some journalists are calling Yahoo's $1 mil
lion donation to the University's John S.
Knight Fellowship program hypocritical. The
gift comes from a company that censored its
search function in China and provided the
Chinese government with informa
tion that led to the arrests of journal
ists promoting democracy.
The donation will fund a 10-year
grant for professional journalists re
porting in countries with limited
freedom, as announced by Knight
Fellowship Director James Bet
tinger last week.
"For me, the underlying principle
is that it is from a company that was
complicit in fingering a dissident,"
Don Bishoff, Class of 1966 and a
forty-year veteran of the news in
dustry, told the San Francisco
Chronicle.
Other journalists applauded the
donation, focusing on the impact it
would have for present-day re
porters.
"Can we please come down off
white horses on the mountain and
stand on the molehills of our lives
and look at what this issue is?" wrote
Mary Lee, a 1984 Fellow, in an e
mail to fellow Knight alumni.
