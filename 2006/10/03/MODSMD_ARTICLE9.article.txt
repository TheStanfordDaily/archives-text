# ORIENTATION
## Real World and O-Show delayed Resident Assistants scramble to educate on alcohol, assault prevention 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
112 reshmen who wished New Student Orientation
(NSO) would never end almost got their wish this year,
when the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah pushed the O-
Show and"The Real World: Stanford" back into the first
week of classes.
Hut some staff complained about the postponement
of Real World," saying it set back alcohol education ef
forts and that attendance suffered.
"Real World is important for our dorm programming,
especially the issues addressed.' Branner Resident Assis
tant Sureel Sheth said. "We went over different alcohol
policies but 1 would have liked to go more in depth with
other issues, like resources for rape elimination It helps
to have it in the context of Real World' rather than just
bringing it up."
NSO Director Jared Scherer explained that the deci
sion to postpone the O-Show and "Real World" was
based on the past success and popularity of the programs,
which are among the oldest in NSO.

* Uver the years, they have proved to be two of our
most well attended events, and we knew that moving
these two particular events to the first ueek of school
would not adversely affect attendance." he said.
Junior Ethan Kottke. a College Assistant in Fresh
man-Sophomore College, agreed with Scherer that fresh
men were enthusiastic about "Real World" despite its
late appearance in the NSO schedule.
"Most of them we reeled." Kottke said. "Kids had to
try to fit it in more, but as far as enthusiasm, they were
into it."
Sheth said he had a harder time encouraging residents
to attend and a difficult time facilitating the discussion
scheduled to take place in dorms after the show, with res
idents more interested in watching TV or attending par
ties.
"1 told kids it w as mandatory and even with that it was
hard to get people to go.' Sheth said. "J understand why
they had to postpone events because of the Jewish holi
day. but I feel like it would have been better if they had
sw itched Real World with another event so it w as in NSO
week."
Kottke. however, said he was confident in the dorm
staffs "ability to tackle the alcohol issue" prior to "Real
World."
" Real World' has useful commentary [on alcohol] but
as a staff we did our own thing." Kottke said. "We lay
down policy, and Real World' does a good job of illustrat
ing it."
Scherer said it wasn't clear whether having "Real
World" later in the program had any effects on the at
mosphere of the freshmen's first weekend on campus.
"I hope that even though the 'Real World' was during
the first week of classes, that other things, like the mes
sages from residential staff and AlcoholF.DU have had
positive influences on new student behavior and their
choices during this time," he said.
Some freshmen expressed concern that there were
too many events during NSO.
Marco Beltran.a freshman in Branner.said he would

like "a little more free time to give people time to just
ride their bikes around and explore," adding that the
part of NSO he enjoyed most was tossing a football
around.
Erica Salazar, a freshman in FSC. thought the best
event was NSGlow, this year's version of the annual all
frosh party, because "everyone attended and was excit
ed." She thought that sometimes there were too many
events at once, however, and wished she had been able to
go to more.
Regarding possible changes for next year's NSO,
Scherer said. "We will certainly take a look at the sched
ule again next year, and my hunch is that we will be mov
ing these events back to NSO Week. 1 do know that for
some students, it was difficult to attend some events dur
ing the first week of classes due to discussion sections."
