"How I Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to
explore the nuts and bolts, pleasures and pains, of all types of writing. While content is
always an issue, the conversation will primarily focus on work styles, such as where, when,
and how a writer composes, allowing us to examine habits, idiosyncrasies, techniques,
trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and delights. We will discuss how a writer generates ideas,
sustains large-scale projects, combines research with composition, overcomes various
impediments and blocks, and cultivates stylistic innovations.
Join Hilton Obenzinger, Associate Director for Honors and Advanced Writing, Stanford
Writing Center, in a conversation on the techniques, quirks, and joys of advanced writers
producing work in all fields and genres.
