# What's your biking style?
## 
### 
I know you've seen them too: the brochures
and glossy Stanford literature that depict
scenic, calm pictures of students hiking
past historic Memorial Church. Or perhaps
you have seen a snapshot of two friends shar
ing a laugh as they pedal past a circle of stu
dents having class outside on the lawn. Now,
although bikers are presented as relaxed and
smiling in 100 percent of Stanford's photo
graphs. I 'd bet my grandma's most expensive
clown statuette that .05 percent of Stanford
bikers do, in fact, have scenic, calm biking ex
periences on a regular basis.
After much first-hand observation, data
compilation and personality-type analysis, I
have been able to scientifically conclude
that these conflicting rates are caused by two
factors. Firstly, and most obviously, this gap
in data is due to the fact that we all bike fran
tically during the same 10-minute breaks be
tween cla ses. And since your professor lets
you out two minutes late, and it takes one
minute to pack up, two minutes to try to flirt
with the Hottie McDo-me, one minute to
walk outside and find your bike and one
more to unlock it. that leaves three minutes
to get to your next class, which we all know is
not enough time.This forces you to reckless
ly and dangerously weave through traffic, in
what is a less than calming ride. (Compound
this narrowed window of bike time with an
influx of bikers outside the Quad due to
Stanford's new randomly implemented and
trustratinglv patrolled no-riding-in-the-ar
cades policy, and the Intersection of Death
becomes worse than hearing from your advi
sor that your senior thesis "needs some revi
sion."
Hut by lar the most important factor that
explains the wild gap between Stanford's
biking perception of itself and the bloody re
ality. is that almost all Stanford bikers fall
into tour decidedly distinct, equally absurd
and frighteningly accurate categories.These
four biking types are simply too disparate
from one another, and cannot coexist with
out scraped paint, bent spokes and all too
often, a bad case of road rash.
Are you a Hurricane Hank? A Veering
Velma? Or maybe you are a Grandma
Gerdie or a Space-Cadet Carl? Take this
quick quiz to find out your biking style:
Part A: Award one point for every "no."
1) I lave you ever used your brakes?
2) I lave you every yielded to another biker?
3) Do you own and in fact habitually use a
bike light?
4) Do you own and in fact habitually wear a
helmet/Are you a grad student?
Part B: Award one point for every "yes."
5) 1 lave you ever been in a bike accident?
6) I lave you ever been the cause of a bike ac
cident?
7) Has vour bike ever made someone else
bleed? '
8) I lave you ever run over a pedestrian?
If you scored a 0-1, you are a Grandma
Gerdie. These Grandmas already knew that,
since they are the only kids in IHUM who

have to un-Velero their neon yellow pant-leg
strap, take off their helmet before they can
lock their bike to its own wheel (and the bike
rack) and remove their quick-release seat so
it won't get stolen. You are the nerdy, nice
biker—we make mocking side-long glances
to our friends at your expense, but deep down
we all know you will live to 95. while we'll get
killed going to the grocery store at 48.
If you scored 2-3 points,you are a Space-
Cadet Carl, perhaps the largest subset of
Stanford bikers. You mean well and you are
decently coordinated, but you are always
thinking about how the pasta salad at lunch
made you gassy, or more pleasantly, those
dimples on McDo-me. The eyes glaze over,
the head tilts and before you know it there is
the pole lodged in your front wheel and your
face is on the pavement.
4-5 points means you are a Veering
Velma, perhaps the cause of the most acci
dents on campus. Just as someone is trying to
pass, you, without checking over your shoul
der. randomly swerve left, cutting the pass
ing biker off and leaving you both in need of
the Superman band-aids that your mom
made you pack in your first aid kit.
And finally, those scoring 6-8 points are
1 lurricane 1 lanks.They are the reckless.rou
tinely late, need for speed, I-can-make-
Suites-to-t he-History-corner-in-one-thirty
flat bikers. ITiey impress you when they
jump a curb but 10 seconds later they nick
your handlebars, get caught in your spokes
and take you down with them.
Ashamedly. I have to admit that I myself
am a Velma. Having run down a pedestrian
my sophomore year while 1 was proudly
pedaling without hands, (my butt-steering
was less than ideal), my biking record is far
from spotless. Let's just say if bikes were
cars, I could do traffic school in my sleep. I'd
have more points on my license than my eat
ing plan and my insurance rates would be
higher than Bob Marley on April 20.
Hut for the all the accidents I've caused.
I've been at the receiving end of just as
many. Perhaps we could all do a little to try
to live up to Stanford's wishful perception of
itself and close the gap between ideal and
real biking experiences: Leave our dorms
one minute earlier, yield a little more often,
check over our shoulders before turning.
ITien sometimes, just occasionally, we will be
biking along and realize that we look like
those happy students on the front of a Stan
ford brochure. And maybe one day this
Velma will have class on the lawn, too.

from one another, and cannot coexist with
out scraped paint, bent spokes and all too
often, a bad case of road rash.
Are you a Hurricane Hank? A Veering
Velma? Or maybe you are a Grandma
Gerdie or a Space-Cadet Carl? Take this
quick quiz to find out your biking style:
Part A: Award one point for every "no."
1) I lave you ever used your brakes?
2) I lave you every yielded to another biker?
3) Do you own and in fact habitually use a
bike light?
4) Do you own and in fact habitually wear a
helmet/Are you a grad student?
Part B: Award one point for every "yes."
5) 1 lave you ever been in a bike accident?
6) I lave you ever been the cause of a bike ac
cident?
7) Has vour bike ever made someone else
bleed? '
8) I lave you ever run over a pedestrian?
If you scored a 0-1, you are a Grandma
Gerdie. These Grandmas already knew that,
since they are the only kids in IHUM who

have to un-Velero their neon yellow pant-leg
strap, take off their helmet before they can
lock their bike to its own wheel (and the bike
rack) and remove their quick-release seat so
it won't get stolen. You are the nerdy, nice
biker—we make mocking side-long glances
to our friends at your expense, but deep down
we all know you will live to 95. while we'll get
killed going to the grocery store at 48.
If you scored 2-3 points,you are a Space-
Cadet Carl, perhaps the largest subset of
Stanford bikers. You mean well and you are
decently coordinated, but you are always
thinking about how the pasta salad at lunch
made you gassy, or more pleasantly, those
dimples on McDo-me. The eyes glaze over,
the head tilts and before you know it there is
the pole lodged in your front wheel and your
face is on the pavement.
4-5 points means you are a Veering
Velma, perhaps the cause of the most acci
dents on campus. Just as someone is trying to
pass, you, without checking over your shoul
der. randomly swerve left, cutting the pass
ing biker off and leaving you both in need of
the Superman band-aids that your mom
made you pack in your first aid kit.
And finally, those scoring 6-8 points are
1 lurricane 1 lanks.They are the reckless.rou
tinely late, need for speed, I-can-make-
Suites-to-t he-History-corner-in-one-thirty
flat bikers. ITiey impress you when they
jump a curb but 10 seconds later they nick
your handlebars, get caught in your spokes
and take you down with them.
Ashamedly. I have to admit that I myself
am a Velma. Having run down a pedestrian
my sophomore year while 1 was proudly
pedaling without hands, (my butt-steering
was less than ideal), my biking record is far
from spotless. Let's just say if bikes were
cars, I could do traffic school in my sleep. I'd
have more points on my license than my eat
ing plan and my insurance rates would be
higher than Bob Marley on April 20.
Hut for the all the accidents I've caused.
I've been at the receiving end of just as
many. Perhaps we could all do a little to try
to live up to Stanford's wishful perception of
itself and close the gap between ideal and
real biking experiences: Leave our dorms
one minute earlier, yield a little more often,
check over our shoulders before turning.
ITien sometimes, just occasionally, we will be
biking along and realize that we look like
those happy students on the front of a Stan
ford brochure. And maybe one day this
Velma will have class on the lawn, too.

I know you've seen them too: the brochures
and glossy Stanford literature that depict
scenic, calm pictures of students hiking
past historic Memorial Church. Or perhaps
you have seen a snapshot of two friends shar
ing a laugh as they pedal past a circle of stu
dents having class outside on the lawn. Now,
although bikers are presented as relaxed and
smiling in 100 percent of Stanford's photo
graphs. I 'd bet my grandma's most expensive
clown statuette that .05 percent of Stanford
bikers do, in fact, have scenic, calm biking ex
periences on a regular basis.
After much first-hand observation, data
compilation and personality-type analysis, I
have been able to scientifically conclude
that these conflicting rates are caused by two
factors. Firstly, and most obviously, this gap
in data is due to the fact that we all bike fran
tically during the same 10-minute breaks be
tween cla ses. And since your professor lets
you out two minutes late, and it takes one
minute to pack up, two minutes to try to flirt
with the Hottie McDo-me, one minute to
walk outside and find your bike and one
more to unlock it. that leaves three minutes
to get to your next class, which we all know is
not enough time.This forces you to reckless
ly and dangerously weave through traffic, in
what is a less than calming ride. (Compound
this narrowed window of bike time with an
influx of bikers outside the Quad due to
Stanford's new randomly implemented and
trustratinglv patrolled no-riding-in-the-ar
cades policy, and the Intersection of Death
becomes worse than hearing from your advi
sor that your senior thesis "needs some revi
sion."
Hut by lar the most important factor that
explains the wild gap between Stanford's
biking perception of itself and the bloody re
ality. is that almost all Stanford bikers fall
into tour decidedly distinct, equally absurd
and frighteningly accurate categories.These
four biking types are simply too disparate
from one another, and cannot coexist with
out scraped paint, bent spokes and all too
often, a bad case of road rash.
