# This year's band run...
## ...More like Lying Girl 15

Scandal has shocked the Internet world.
People recently found out that Lonely
Girl 15. a popular poster on the site
Youtube.com is a fake, unlike everything else
on Youtube.com. Youtube is your source for
videos of monkeys riding kittens and that
clip where a kid hits a melon filled with gaso
line.
Due to investigative and diligent bloggers
who bravely found time between their World
of Warcraft games and LARPing. Lonely
Girl 15 was revealed to actually be a 45- year
old man in a dress. Just kidding.She was actu
ally discovered to be an actress whose story
was written by three male writers. It's ficti
tious, and the bloggers are pissed. And when
the bloggers are pissed, man. no one is safe.
They'll pump you so full of leet you'll go cry
ing home to your fan fiction and manga.
I'm trying to figure out why people are
surprised that it is fake. Let's see here... a hot
girl with impeccable complexion, a great
Web camera and an altar of Aleister Crow
ley, an occultist. Nope,seems perfectly run of
the mill to me.
Of course, there were other things that
tipped me off. In one episode, you can see
that her shoes and belt don't match — some
thing no bona fide 16-year-old girl would do.
Later in the show, the microphone boom hits
heron the head and if you lower the volume,
you can hear the writers eating chips. Also,
the chicken she sacrificed was clearly already
dead, thus ruining a true fertilization cere
mony to her occult master.
But what 1 think is interesting from a soci
ological perspective is why people are so
upset. People feel like they've been lied to.
I'm curious why that makes a difference. It's
a story that they are viewing; whether it is
true or not isn't really important, right? Or
are little bloggers now buying their own
Aleister Crowley altars and dating their own
bland wimpy boyfriends? Does it being ficti
tious make it less profound? Do people find
more inspiration from the truth?
I posed this debate to myself and whoev
er was listening to me at the time when the
James Frey controversy started brewing. Ibis

guy wrote his memoir and it turned out
major segments of it were fake. First this
Charlotte Simmons chick's memoir turns out
to be written by some old dude, and now this
Frey guy — next you'll be telling me that Bill
Clinton omitted some key details from his
memoir.
While previously applauded, Frey was
now slammed by people. The publisher is
even offering a refund for anyone who
bought the book under the assumption that it
was truth. In order to overcome their own
problems, thousands of Oprah fans had tried
imitating Frev's story by going on drinking
binges, blacking out and spending time in
rehab. I didn't realize Frey's story was in the
self-help section. I mean, I agree that lying
about your life story in college applications,
job interviews and reality shows is morally
reprehensible. But books are different to me.
I don't care if "Memoirs of a Geisha" was fic
titious or not; 1 don't plan on whoring myself
out to Japanese businessmen anytime soon.
With memoirs, you are paying for their sto
ries; they are being paid to give you enter
taining versions of their life stories. Iliat's
why you'd rather read about geishas and an
archist schizophrenics than anything by
Rachel Ray. No? Ok, that's just me then.
I don't sweat these lies. If James Frey told
me that his wallet was stolen by a leopard
that he had to fight off with a cooking whisk,
I'd command his creative retelling of part of
his life. 1 mean, he was an alcoholic — that's
probably how he remembered it anyway. If
Lonely Girl 15 wants to explain that she wor
ships the occult and makes puppets out of
lemons, I'll applaud her amazing ability to
smear goat's blood on herself without letting

her makeup run. Fiction or make-believe, 1
don't plan on imitating these people.
People try to separate reality from fanta
sy. hut that's becoming increasingly harder to
do. Every day we are bombarded by images
ol what is going on in the world around us
and told by talking heads what to think of
them. Hie reality is twisted into fantasy. Peo
ple hate being lied to. 1 get that. But 1 think
we Americans should be angrier when being
lied to about things that actually matter.
Like when Newt Gingrich states that Re
publicans were afraid to aggressively investi
gate Foley because of fear of being called
"homophobic." Or that the upper level GOP
members didn't know about Foley's actions.
Or that we can ever win against an abstract
concept .like "Terror" or " Drugs" or " Prema
ture Balding."
1 guess I m worried about when people
don t recognize fantasy and they start believ
ing lies. I"hey don't understand who is pulling
the strings, the "why" of the lie. If little Lone
ly Girl 15 began to tell us that her battle
against science extended to lighting Darwin
ism. you d want to know Lonely Girl 15 was
lunded by a Kansas PAC. You'd also proba
bly want to know how on earth they got the
Internet to Kansas.
So I worry that we get angry over the stu
pid shit. Angry bloggers posted their own
videos to reveal the"truth" of Lonely Girl 15
as it she had done something truly traitorous,
like canceled "Sealab 2021." James Frey was
ci ucified tor indulging stories of his life about
booze and prison time — the terrible impact
this will have on his career as a high school
motivational speaker we will never know. But
when are we going to step forward and actual
l\ demand the truth about things that matter?
Like, lor instance, excluding people from
I acebook. ITiat s something we can all get
behind.

i lost popular college causes to get behind: ex
