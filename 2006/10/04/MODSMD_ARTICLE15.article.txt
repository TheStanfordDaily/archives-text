## Fixing a global game Need to make soccer more appealing in the U.S? Add Mike Tyson 
### 
When a fan became upset at a
European club soccer
match because the ref had
made a questionable call, he took
what he felt to be the only reasonable
and appropriate action. He walked
out of the stadium, got behind the
wheel of his car and drove straight
into the stadium, attempting to run
over the referee.
The same thing almost happened
at a match in the MLS when Los An
geles Galaxy player Landon Dono
van was tripped up in the box. The
only difference? Ibis time, with no
fans in attendance, teammate Cohi
Jones was seen ghost riding his 19%
Pontiac at the ref. Jones could not be
restrained and he reportedly contin
ued to shout at Landon, "Tell me
when to go."
Soccer is not only the official
sport of the world, but also a way of
life that has seeped its way into world
culture. National holidays are de
clared after international victories in
Europe. In Ghana, all the coalmines
were shut down during the nation's
appearances in the 2006 World Cup
so that there would be enough elec
tricity for the anxious Ghanaians to
watch their team on television. Yet.
the MLS and world soccer has yet to
make any viable dent in the Ameri
can sports market.
I've heard the same argument
over and over again. Soccer is too
slow and there isn't enough action.
Personally, I have a hard time swal
lowing this argument from a country
whose national pastime, baseball,
showcases less action than a
monastery.
The most telling statistic that
proves how slow and unathletic
baseball is: I'here are more than 30
pitchers in the major leagues that are
actually clinically obese. And it's not
just pitchers (see former MLB play
er Cecil Fielder).
That said, there are a few things
soccer could do to make the Ameri
can public a little more interested. It
seems as though with each passing
year, the number of players willing to
dive at the slightest contact is shoot
ing through the roof. These fake in
juries slow the pace of the game and
disrupt the overall How of the "beau
tiful game."
Of course, every problem — with
the notable exception of Terrell
Owens — has a solution. I propose
that soccer require an extra official

tor cach match. I"his official will re
view all fouls with instant replay,and
determine the reality of each painful
grimace on the pitch.
I or every minute that a player
spends delaying the game with a fake
injury, he will earn one minute in the
Chamber of Soccer Penance to he
served either at halftime or after the
game. The chamber will be an es
cape-proof cage in which the guilty
player will be forced to watch Fox's
newest reality show: "Dancing with
the Stars," Season 4: Evander Holy
field and Mike Tyson Do the Samba.
This way everyone wins; the play
ers learn their lessons, Mike Tyson
gets a job and television viewers
across the globe get quite the eyetul
during the halftime and post-game
shows.
Aside from the argument that
soccer is too slow, I've also heard
complaints on the low (or lack of)
scoring. Why can't the rest of the
world's football be like American
football and have scores rack up?
The reason is simple. When Walter
Camp created the rules for football,
he ingeniously assigned the touch
down a value of seven points, thus

tricking the acute-minded American
public into believing that football
truly was a high-scoring affair.
I"hus, games in which teams won
by a score of three touchdowns to
two touchdowns, the score actually
read 21-14. I"his seemingly unbreak
able multiplicative code has success
fully fooled American sports fans for
more than two centuries. The solu
tion? Make every soccer goal worth
20 points.
It's a promising sign that around
the United States; more and more
youth soccer leagues are springing
up.There is an unmistakable interest
at the youth level, and that interest
has lead to a growing pool of soccer
talent in America.
If the interest of the sports view
ing public can match the interest at
the grassroots level, soccer could one
day extend its worldwide love affair
to the U.S.
And if not, at least they'll all tune
in at halftime in case Tyson has a
wardrobe malfunction.
