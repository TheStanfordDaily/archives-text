# CLASS PRESIDENTS NEGOTIATE WITH ADMINISTRATION
## Pub Night on hiatus Seniors react to delays while presidents iron out issues 
### DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT MANAGING EDITOR 
Seniors will have to wait another
week for this year's first Pub Night after
class presidents announced yesterday
that they were still negotiating with the
Office of Student Activities over how to
address the University's safety and
image concerns — a development that
annoyed many upperclassmen and left
some disenchanted with the Thursday
night tradition.
Senior Jarret Guajardo characterized
the delay as the latest injustice visited
upon the student body.
"We're getting hit from all the sides
— the bike ban, no Band and now this,"
said Guajardo, who was notified by the e
mail last night with the rest of the class of
2007 that the event would not be held this
week.
Pub Night, renamed Senior Night in
2003 to deemphasize the alcohol compo
nent, has been plagued in recent years by
excessive drunkenness, on-site scuffles

and vomiting on the Marguerite buses
that shuttle seniors to the weekly venue.
Vivek Agrawal. a senior class president,
said that instead of running the event
along the same lines as previous years,
the executives were trying to formulate a
sustainable plan to ensure Senior Night's
future.
"The sticking point is accountability
for seniors," he said. " They are represen
tative of Stanford."
Ihe Office of Student Activities could
not be reached by press time.

Some ideas that the senior class pres
idents and the University have batted
around include arranging cabs to take
sick students home and hiring sober
monitors. Last year, event organizers
slapped $500 fines on students that vom
ited on the Marguerite, but locating
guilty parties was difficult, Agrawal said.
To remedy this issue, organizers may
begin scanning SUI Ds as students board
buses to help track down out of control
revelers.
Faris Mohiuddin, the senior class pres
ident who circulated last nieht's e-mail to

the class of 2007 list, said
that he had received about a dozen re
sponses, most of them less angry and more
curious about what issues needed to be
ironed out with the administration.
In addition. Agrawal tried to empha
size that the current situation is no one's
fault.
"This isn't the administration's fault,
and it isn't the senior class' fault," he said.
But some upperclassmen disagreed.
"I am very disappointed," said senior
Matt Krensky. "They've had all summer
to plan this. While 1 don't hold any of the
class presidents individually responsible.

this would have been a good way to
kick off the year."
Senior Josh Merritt took a more
conspiratorial view.
"It's just another step in the
slow path that the University is
taking to try and eliminate alcohol
from a lot of the activities students
enjoy," he said. "They started our
freshman year by banning alcohol
at all-frosh dorm parties to the
Mirrielees RF banning Beirut in
the entire dorm."
Others questioned whether the
proposed changes would change the

tone of an event whose very nature in
volves the consumption of alcohol.
"It is what it is," said senior John
Collins."! don't see how they're going
to prevent whatever behavior they
are worried about. Either Stanford
wants to do it or they don't." Collins
added, however, that the continuing
uncertainty might temper students'
behavior.
But some students said that belly
aching about the situation was unbe
coming of seniors near graduation
and adulthood.
"It seems like a poor reflection of
the senior class that we need the Uni
versity to organize something like this
tor us "said senior Jackie Bernstein."lf
I really want my Senior Pub Night, my
friends and 1 should find a designated
driver and go to Nola's."
