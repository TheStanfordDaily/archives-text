### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Immigration: Rights and Wrongs," a new course
that will he offered only once, will place itself in the
eye of an immigration storm that recently sparked a
whirlwind of debate and demonstrations nationwide.
"Immigration is one of the great challenges of eth
nicity, race, class and nationality of our times," said
Professor Lawrence Bobo, director of the Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity
(CCSRE)."It is imperative that the Stanford commu
nity be made aware of all that surrounds the new pol
itics of immigration."
In the backdrop of a hot election season and debate
over controversial legislation, members of CCSRE
felt compelled to bring immigration to the forefront of
campus-wide discourse, Bobo said. With the assistance
of Comparative Literature Prof. David Polumbo-Liu
and Psychology Prof. Hazel Markus, the idea for this
course came into fruition. Organizers will launch its
kick-off event tonight with a screening of the docu
mentary film "Crossing Arizona."
"Few experiences can bring home the meaning of
the clash at the border [more] than this film," Bobo
said.
Following the screening, students will have a
chance to hear from and talk with the two filmmakers
behind this documentary.
"In Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity
[CSRE], we're generally very interested in having di
versity in terms of perspective but also in terms of the
scholars and the artists and scientists who are produc
ing the products that we're studying," Markus said.
"We think that makes a difference [in] what questions
you ask and what contexts you have."
Four additional sessions will showcase leading
Stanford faculty and other experts in the field of immi
gration. including Princeton Sociology Prof. Alejan
dro Portes and UC Berkeley Economics Prof. David
Card. These four panels will provide students with a
forum to delve deeper into the historical, cultural,
legal, economic and racial roots of current immigra
tion discourse. Experts will also discuss the socioeco
nomic pros and cons of current policy and alternative
proposals.
Stanford alumnus Orlando Lara will also launch
"Sed: A Trail of Thirst," a concurrent art exhibit that
