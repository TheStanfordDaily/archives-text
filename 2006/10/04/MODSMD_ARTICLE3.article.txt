## Class educates students about immigration One-time-only course leads discourse on current immigration issues 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Immigration: Rights and Wrongs," a new course
that will he offered only once, will place itself in the
eye of an immigration storm that recently sparked a
whirlwind of debate and demonstrations nationwide.
"Immigration is one of the great challenges of eth
nicity, race, class and nationality of our times," said
Professor Lawrence Bobo, director of the Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity
(CCSRE)."It is imperative that the Stanford commu
nity be made aware of all that surrounds the new pol
itics of immigration."
In the backdrop of a hot election season and debate
over controversial legislation, members of CCSRE
felt compelled to bring immigration to the forefront of
campus-wide discourse, Bobo said. With the assistance
of Comparative Literature Prof. David Polumbo-Liu
and Psychology Prof. Hazel Markus, the idea for this
course came into fruition. Organizers will launch its
kick-off event tonight with a screening of the docu
mentary film "Crossing Arizona."
"Few experiences can bring home the meaning of
the clash at the border [more] than this film," Bobo
said.
Following the screening, students will have a
chance to hear from and talk with the two filmmakers
behind this documentary.
"In Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity
[CSRE], we're generally very interested in having di
versity in terms of perspective but also in terms of the
scholars and the artists and scientists who are produc
ing the products that we're studying," Markus said.
"We think that makes a difference [in] what questions
you ask and what contexts you have."
Four additional sessions will showcase leading
Stanford faculty and other experts in the field of immi
gration. including Princeton Sociology Prof. Alejan
dro Portes and UC Berkeley Economics Prof. David
Card. These four panels will provide students with a
forum to delve deeper into the historical, cultural,
legal, economic and racial roots of current immigra
tion discourse. Experts will also discuss the socioeco
nomic pros and cons of current policy and alternative
proposals.
Stanford alumnus Orlando Lara will also launch
"Sed: A Trail of Thirst," a concurrent art exhibit that
integrates themes featured in and
inspired by this course.
Available for one or three units
of credit/no credit, students who opt
to take this course for three units
rather than one are required to
write a 10-page paper and attend a
discussion section, where they will
use panelist commentary and out
side readings as a springboard for
dialogue.
Estella Cisneros, a senior and
second-generation immigrant, was
inspired to enroll as a student assis
tant for the course because of her
personal and academic ties to the
immigration debate.
"The issues surrounding the de
bate cannot help but strike me as
relevant and personal," Cisneros
said. "The way people are thinking
about the debate is wrong. It is not
about breaking the law but about
why people are breaking the law."
Junior Tony Dang, who spent last
year abroad in Paris, felt motivated
to enroll in the course after he wit
nessed firsthand the issue's interna
tional relevance.
"I saw the ongoing immigration
and integration debates occurring
in France," said Dang. "Although it
was quite different from the U.S.
case in a lot of ways, the media used
many of the same rhetorical strate
gies, which piqued my interest in the
issue."
Markus hopes that students who
take this course will be better pre
pared to navigate the complexities
of racially charged issues like immi
gration.
"This is a really complicated
issue and students need to have
more information before they're
prepared to judge," Markus said.
"We're hoping to give the whole
picture on immigration."
