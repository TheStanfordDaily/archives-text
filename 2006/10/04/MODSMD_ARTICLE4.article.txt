# Online High School teaches globally
## Students worldwide united through university-level classes 
### SAM BHAGWAT STAFF WRITER 
Some people simply write to pen pals on far
away continents — but a Stanford program has
brought students from Hong Kong and Seoul to
gether to study with students from Arizona and
Minnesota in an online virtual high school.
The University has hosted the Online High
School (OHS) since Sept. 7.The program is run by
the Education Program for Gifted Youth
(EPGY), and the curriculum currently includes
several classes from Stanford's math and physics
departments, most notably linear algebra and mul
tivariable calculus (the Math 50 series) and inter
mediate mechanics and electricity and magnetism

(Physics 110.120 and 121).
The classes are conducted live, using videocon
ferencing technology that allows precocious stu
dents around the world to see the teacher's lesson
and other students when they ask questions.
Shared-whiteboard technology enables a Power-
Point presentation or handwriting to be displayed
next to the video of the teacher.
So far, students have responded well to the for
mat.
"It doesn't feel like a traditional classroom,but
it doesn't feel too awkward," said Matthew Bun
day. 14, of Minnesota.
Critics of such alternative learning methods as
homeschooling and distance learning have argued
that traditional schools provide a better atmos
phere for developing social skills, and OHS en
rollees expressed mixed opinions on the socializ-

ing opportunities that their virtual high school provides.
"Sometimes you don't really get a lot of interaction;
you can't really say,' Come hang out after school,'" said
David Sell, 12, of Arizona. "It's still fun, though."
In addition. Sell pointed to a lack of opportunity for
random, school-unrelated chat.
Whatever the merits of virtual high school on the so
cial front, parents and students alike loudly praised its ac
ademics.
"Traditional schools are no comparison." said Miriam
Sell, David's mother. "The academics are at the universi
ty level. We're grateful it exists."
Bunday agreed, saying that the quality of teaching is
much better at OHS than at traditional schools. His fa
ther Karl approvingly compared the quality and content
of OHS's core curriculum to Stanford's Introduction to
the Humanities program.
Administrators were equally eager to praise students.
"The students have shown a level of dedication and
commitment that is a pleasure to behold," said EPGY
deputy director Ray Ravaglia.
Ravaglia highlighted students that have jumped

through hoops to take part in the high school. One stu
dent in the Midwest lives in a remote area and must trav
el into town with her mother to get to a suitable comput
er, he said. And because classes are conducted live, the
students in Hong Kong and Seoul must stay up until 1 or
3 a.m. to listen to lectures.
The first three weeks have not been perfect. With its
far-flung student population. OHS has experienced tech
nical difficulties including latency — time lags due to the
speed ot light — as well as a few software glitches.
"As with any new endeavor, there are growing pains,"
Kavaglia acknowledged. "That said, nothing has hap
pened so far to change our initial plans."
Of course, one always has to wonder whether Stan
lord's hosting of OHS will affect participating students'
chances of coming to The Farm for college.
"We've been impressed with Stanford, and it's on the
list of schools we're considering," said Karl Bunday.
Others were more set in their opinions. When asked
whether OHS had changed his opinion of Stanford.
David Sell had a simple response.
"I'm looking forward to applying to MIT," he replied.
