## Spam deletion causes problems with Webmail 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Information Technology Systems and Services (ITSS) began
deleting spam-tagged messages rather than delivering them
yesterday afternoon to counteract problems with Webmail
caused by a mysterious spike in message volume, a move that
left some students wary.
The spam deletion program, which was scheduled to start
later this year, only deletes messages coded [SPAM:#####]. Ac
cording to Nancy Ware, ITSS project manager, the number of
"#"s in the message tag is directly proportional to how confi
dent the software is that the message is actually spam.
"TTiis designation means the certainty factor of the e-mail
being a spam message is in the 90 to 99 percent range," Ware
said. "When the central Stanford mail gateway servers receive
the inbound message, it is sorted through this filter. Any mes
sage that is coded at this level will be discarded prior to any pro
cessing or forwarding.Therefore, these messages will never be
received by the pobox servers and delivered to your e-mail ad
dress."
This measure was taken in response to reports of e-mail
problems, beginning on Sept. 27, which included an inability to
check or receive messages, delays in receiving e-mail and blank
screens or lack of connection while using Webmail.
Despite an e-mail, sent to campus RCCs, that described the
new program, many students were previously unaware of the

change and expressed some con
cerns about personal messages being
marked as spam.
"I would only want it implement
ed if it were fairly conservative, since
sometimes e-mail marked as spam is
not," said Michael Dinerstein. a sen
ior.
Freshman Kimberly Chang
shared those concerns.
"Well a lot of my e-mails are
tagged as spam, so I wouldn't want
them to delete my spam e-mail." she
said.
Ware said that the problems were
caused by a sudden spike in e-mail
volume, but the causes ol that jump
are still a mystery. IT Services sus
pects that the spike was "due to high
volumes of spam and increased e
mail volume related to the return of
students," Ware said. However, they
were unable to rule out the possibili
ty of a cyber-attack.
" Ilirough the course of normal
operations, we do provide additional
allowances to handle surges and
spikes in demand," she said. "How

ever, the load patterns of last week
significantly exceeded these plan
ning buffers. Regrettably this creat
ed a sudden degradation in our serv
ice."
As of yesterday. Ware said IT Ser
vices had still never received a report
of an e-mail tagged as the highest
level of spam which turned out to be
a false positive. But there are tools
for looking at the headers of deleted
messages and reporting false spam
online at email.stanford.edu.
However, students will not be
able to opt out of the level five spam
deletion program.
"Since the e-mail is deleted right
at the border of Stanford," Ware
said, "it is never even processed.
1 lowever. we may go back and retool
that in time."
In the future. IT Services is plan
ning on implementing an automatic
deletion program for level three and
four spam messages marked
[SPAM:###| and |SPAM:####| for
which there is less certainty about
their junk-mail status. Students will
have the choice to opt out of this
lower scale program.
Despite concerns that personal
mail might be weeded out, some stu
dents welcomed the program.
The spam software "actually

works pretty well," said senior Ryan
Hopkins. He called the automatic
deletions "a great idea."
Senior Lindsey Shauer agreed.
"It's gotten to the point where,
when I check my email, 1 delete 75
percent of what is in my inbox," she
said. "Spam is ruining my life."
