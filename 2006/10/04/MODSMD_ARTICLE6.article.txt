# CAMPUS LIFE
## Salsa and tango up next at Dance Camp 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
The first day of Dance Camp was a gray, sunless Sunday, hut
the Havana Room of the Graduate Community ( enter w as filled
to capacity. Unruly rows of shoes lined one side of the wood-pan
eled floor as Rachel Caldwell, a second-year graduate student in
chemistry and a veteran member of the Stanford Ballroom
Dance Team, wove through a crowd of new dancers, correcting
poses and giving suggestions about incorporating new steps.
When the music stopped, the motley bunch, whose constituents
spanned a wide range of ages and demographics, stood around
and waited for further instruction.
"That was really good," she said. "Give yourselves a hand."
she added, followed by enthusiastic applause. "Now. for this
dance, 1 would like everyone in this room not to look at the floor.
Usually you'll find your partner's a little hit nicer-looking than
the floor."
Caldwell, who donned a Cardinal shirt and a good sense of
humor, is one of the many veteran dancers participating in Dance
Camp, a series of free, introductory dance lessons sponsored by
the Stanford Ballroom Dance Team.
"It's something we have every year to get people interested in
dancing,"said sophomore Marcella Chibbaro.the rookie coordi
nator for the team. "We give them a little taste before they com-
mit to classes or to the team."
This year. Dance Camp spans four
days. Each day, two different styles of
dance are taught in consecutive hour
long lessons. Sunday's session, for ex
ample, taught beginners salsa and
swing; Tuesday's session covered the
basics of samba and jive. The sessions
are open to all members of the
greater Stanford community â€” un
dergraduates and graduate students,
as well as nearby residents.
Two sessions remain. Tonight, cha
cha and tango lessons will be offered
at the Arrillaga Family Sports Center
from 8-10 p.m. in the evening. Salsa
will be taught from 3-4 p.m. tomorrow
at the Havana Room.
The first session on Sunday drew
over 70 participants. Senior Amelia
Drace, captain of the team, was
pleased by the turnout.
"It looks like any more [dancers]
would be in violation of the fire
code," she joked. She anticipated
even greater attendance at the next
few sessions, in part because of the
professional dancers who will be
teaching tonight's lessons. Jonathan

Roberts and Anna Trebunskaya, cast
members of Dancing with the Stars
and the sixth-ranked dancers in the
country, will be teaching the cha-cha
and tango lessons.
"Anna and Jonathan are really
good friends to our team." Drace said.
"They don't have much time to come
in. but we see them around at compe
titions. and they've always been very
friendly."
Roberts and Trebunskaya, a hus
band-and-wife team based in the Bay
Area, provided the showcase per
formance at the Cardinal Classic held
at Stanford last April.
Even experienced members of the
team are looking forward to today's
session.
"I'm definitely excited,"said Chib
baro. "The professionals bring a great
deal of experience and technique."
But Mayukh Bhaowd. a graduate
student in computer science and the
space coordinator for the team, was
quick to praise the teaching of Stan
ford's own dancers, who are leading
the other three sessions.
"With the veterans, you can talk
more and ask silly questions,"
Bhaowd said."lt's great to learn from
the professionals, but the veteran
[student) dancers can also offer a lot
of good advice based on their recent
experiences in competition."

Drace agreed. "We're focused on
teaching everyone the dances from
the very beginning," she said, refer
ring to the eight different classes that
the Stanford Ballroom Dance Team is
teaching this quarter. "We're focused
on teaching people, at all levels, what
they need to be stronger, better
dancers, and to have more fun."
The class offerings include begin
ner's classes in cha-cha. rumba, tango,
salsa and swing, as well as intermedi
ate and advanced classes for more ex
perienced dancers.
The Stanford Ballroom Dance
Team, which boasts a membership of
60 students, is also an option for aspir
ing dancers.
"We always have a large number
of rookies," Drace said. "In the past
few years, we've been starting to see a
lot of people who join, wanting to
compete as soon as possible," she
said, noting that the popularity of tel
evision programs like Dancing with
the Stars has increased the size of the
team. "We don't really have to moti
vate people to want to compete any
more. They come in wanting to get
out on the floor as soon as possible."
"There's a lot of passion, a lot of
emotion in dancing," said Bhaowd.

ers and participating in a beginner's
class last vear."l love it."
