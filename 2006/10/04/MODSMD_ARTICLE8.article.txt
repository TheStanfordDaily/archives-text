Who is to blame for the steady
disintegration of stability in
Iraq? Democrats have long
faulted the Bush administration for
mistakes and mismanagement. I"he
Iraq issue has become a liability tor

Insider journalist
Bob Woodward's new
book "State of Denial,
published Monday, has
set off a firestorm of

criticism about the
Bush administration's
initial unwillingness to
face the realities of the
Iraq war. It also has
prompted prominent

professors to question the positive
spin put on the quickly-building
stream of bad news that emerged
from the country as the insurgency
flared up.
"1 don't want anyone in the cabi
net to say it is an insurgency. I don't
think we are there yet," Woodward
quotes Bush as saying in late 2003.

the mark,"said Prof. Larry Diamond,
a Hoover Fellow, who served as an
advisor to the Coalition Provisional
Authority in 2(X)4. "We've never had
enough troops and we've never dealt
adequately with the insurgency...the
administration has rejected most ad
vice it's been given."
Political Science Prof. James
Fearon also thinks that

the president has a
great deal to answer for.
"I think the ab
sence of serious and in
telligent pre-war plan
ning for the post-war is
directly traceable to a
failure of leadership
and initiative by the
President, and this lack
of planning is partly re
sponsible for the gen
erally terrible state of
post-war Iraq." he told
The Daily.

"The worst 'decision,' in my view,
was the failure to take account of the
fact that by decapitating Hussein's
regime.the U.S. invasion would be in
troducing anarchy, so that without a
very large initial force presence and a
clear and well worked out policy for
setting up a new and legitimate Iraqi
government, the chances of stability
would be extremely low (instead of
just low)."
The issue of whether Iraq is actu
ally in deep trouble is no longer on
the table, and voices of those like

Donald Rumsfeld who contested
negative media portrayals of the on -
the-ground situation have died
down.
Now. aside from asking who is to
blame, the questions of "I low bad is
it?" and "What exactly should be
done?" are crucial issues of discus
sion that may be lost in election year
recriminations. Few offer positive
outlooks.

on the legacies of colonialism, sees
the current struggles as a reflection
of historical divisions in Iraq.
"It is not the failure of electoral
democracy that poses a problem for
Iraq today but rather its success. 1 lie
current Government of National

Unity reflects quite well a fractured
society, and leaders are unable to
curb sectarian violence because the
main perpetrators of this violence
are militias closely linked to political
parties whose participation in gov
ernment is deemed essential."
"The government is sufficiently
reflective of society that it cannot ef
fectively govern society, and so de
pendent on militia-based political
factions that it cannot disband the
militias or coerce them to integrate
into a disciplined national army and
police force."
While questions about what the
U.S. could have done to better man
age these divisions are interesting,
they are proving less and less rele
vant. In Diamond's view, there's little

hope for what has been called the
"Bush Freedom Doctrine."
"I don't think there's any ques
tion now of democracy in Iraq." said
Diamond, the author of the 2005-
book "Squandered Victory: The
American Occupation and the Bun
gled Effort to Bring Democracy to
Iraq."
"The question is if Iraq can be sta
bilized." he said.
Fearon was one of several expert
witnesses called to testify before
Congress in a hearing on "Iraq's
Progress Toward Democracy" in the
House Subcommittee on National
Security on Sept. 15. He told Con
gress that, by almost any definition.
Iraq is now in a civil war. and while
immediate withdrawal of U.S.

troops would be harmful, "simply
staying the course" or even deploy
ing more troops is not a productive
option.
Iraqis are likely to continue suf
fering the violent consequences of a
war they didn't start and the after
math of mistakes made by others. In
the end. the solution may be their re
sponsibility and out of U.S. control,
Fearon said.
"We need to plan for the possibil
ity that a democratic Iraq that can
stand on its own is not going to take
root while we're there," he testified.
"This means planning to put our
selves in the best position to influ
ence for the good the evolution of a
civil conflict that only Iraqis have
the power to end at this point."

Who is to blame for the steady
disintegration of stability in
Iraq? Democrats have long
faulted the Bush administration for
mistakes and mismanagement. I"he
Iraq issue has become a liability tor
the president, as De-

mocrats try to capital
ize on recent develop
ments on the eve of the
Novermber election.
Insider journalist
Bob Woodward's new
book "State of Denial,
published Monday, has
set off a firestorm of

criticism about the
Bush administration's
initial unwillingness to
face the realities of the
Iraq war. It also has
prompted prominent

professors to question the positive
spin put on the quickly-building
stream of bad news that emerged
from the country as the insurgency
flared up.
"1 don't want anyone in the cabi
net to say it is an insurgency. I don't
think we are there yet," Woodward
quotes Bush as saying in late 2003.
Hie book provides ammunition 111

dled.

the mark,"said Prof. Larry Diamond,
a Hoover Fellow, who served as an
advisor to the Coalition Provisional
Authority in 2(X)4. "We've never had
enough troops and we've never dealt
adequately with the insurgency...the
administration has rejected most ad
vice it's been given."
Political Science Prof. James
Fearon also thinks that

the president has a
great deal to answer for.
"I think the ab
sence of serious and in
telligent pre-war plan
ning for the post-war is
directly traceable to a
failure of leadership
and initiative by the
President, and this lack
of planning is partly re
sponsible for the gen
erally terrible state of
post-war Iraq." he told
The Daily.

"The worst 'decision,' in my view,
was the failure to take account of the
fact that by decapitating Hussein's
regime.the U.S. invasion would be in
troducing anarchy, so that without a
very large initial force presence and a
clear and well worked out policy for
setting up a new and legitimate Iraqi
government, the chances of stability
would be extremely low (instead of
just low)."
The issue of whether Iraq is actu
ally in deep trouble is no longer on
the table, and voices of those like

Donald Rumsfeld who contested
negative media portrayals of the on -
the-ground situation have died
down.
Now. aside from asking who is to
blame, the questions of "I low bad is
it?" and "What exactly should be
done?" are crucial issues of discus
sion that may be lost in election year
recriminations. Few offer positive
outlooks.
Prof. David Abernethy, who pub
lished a book. "Global Dominance."
on the legacies of colonialism, sees
the current struggles as a reflection
of historical divisions in Iraq.
"It is not the failure of electoral
democracy that poses a problem for
Iraq today but rather its success. 1 lie
current Government of National

Unity reflects quite well a fractured
society, and leaders are unable to
curb sectarian violence because the
main perpetrators of this violence
