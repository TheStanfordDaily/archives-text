## Editorial Board Standing our ground

It looks like Stanford just doesn't know how
to grab the headlines when it comes to ad
missions and financial aid. First, we wait to
follow I larvard's lead in adhering to a single
choice early action policy, a move that has
hitched our name to fellow-follower Yale's in
almost every article in the national press since
regarding early admissions. Then, we let both
I larvard and Vale beat us to the punch in set
ting flashy financial aid "benchmarks," at
$(/).(XX) and $45.(HJ(). respectively below which
families would not have to pay tuition.
But now, at a time when Harvard and
Princeton are actively recruiting other
schools to jump on the bandwagon by get
ting rid of all early admissions, our adminis
tration is actively digging in its heels. On this
occasion, at least, the University has main
tained its own course. The most controver
sial section of Provost John Etchemendy's
defense of the University's early action pol
icy inThe New York Times last week was the
final paragraph, which suggested that the
fairest and most practical solution would be
for all colleges to adopt a nonbinding early
admissions policy. ITiis is a radical proposi
tion because it would move the whole
process in the opposite direction from what
Harvard is trying to accomplish. Is
Etchemendy right?
1 le is certainly right to point out that the
kudos lavished on Harvard and Princeton
has obscured the subtleties of the debate.
Too much subtlety,say the critics of early ad
missions. is part of the problem. For example.
Harvard's Dean of Admissions said that
only "the more sophisticated" (a rather poor
euphemism for "wealthy") high school stu
dents are able to distinguish between non
binding early action and binding early deci
sion programs. Hut it seems overreaching,
not to mention patronizing, to suggest that
students with fewer resources are being
scared away in large numbers because they
cannot see behind the word "early."
The other persuasive argument against
early admissions is the danger known as"se

nioritis" that students who receive a thick en
velope in December will slack off for the rest
of the year. However, we don't huy into the
extent of this fear, which is stoked every year
by anecdotal horror stories of those who get
their admissions revoked. Ilie more serious
problem, as Etchemendy notes, is that the
most qualified students are applying to tot)
many schools, sometimes as many as 15 or 20.
Part of the reason that I larvard rejects a
much higher percentage of students in the
regular admissions cycle is that so many peo
ple send in applications to Harvard "on a
lark." Single-choice early action allows stu
dents to aim for a narrow target, while regular
admissions are too often used like buckshot.
Fhere is so much veiled hostility towards
"advantaged" students these days that we
wonder: Why not just accept fewer of them?
Is it because so many are so good at "gaming
the system"? In fact, top universities want to
have it both ways.They want to sound egali
tarian by criticizing the prevalence of SAT
tutoring, specialized counseling and other
forms of "sophistication" among the wealthy
while at the same time trumpeting the fig
ures from each incoming class, like high SAT
scores, which are inflated by students with
such advantages. If these schools really
wanted to live up to their ideals, they would
stop cooperating either implicitly or overtly,
with the U.S. News & World Report ranking
system, whieh has created much more stress,
unfairness and falsity in the process than
early admissions has ever done.
We need to continue to find ways to at
tract more low-income students, but doing
away with early admissions would not add
anything substantive to this effort. Until
now. Stanford has not really been a vocal
player in the debate. Etchemendy, in defend
ing the University's policy, has taken a firm
stand in favor of a policy lie believes is right.
Unfortunately, some other early action
schools have been overly blinded by the mo
mentary glow of good publicity around I lar
vard and Princeton to do the same.
