Happy with a class you recently took? Received a grant
for a research project in the Galapagos? Discovered a
great coffee shop University Ave.? Stanford Wiki. a spinoff
of the popular, do-it-yourself online encyclopedia, offers
students the chance to share campus information and
learn about The Farm off the beaten path.
The new Wiki project, found at stanford.wikia.com. was
conceived this summer by Tristan I larris,a coterminal stu
dent in computer science.The site went live this week and
features the same look and format as the wildly popular
Wikipedia.org, but with a twist of only Stanford-centric
content.
"The Stanford Wiki is a place for students to share in
formation about essentially anything they want related to
Stanford." I larris said. "It can be about their favorite pro
fessors. the best places to take people on dates, the worst
dining halls, good places nearby to get haircuts."
I larris added that the content on Stanford Wiki can also
include "plenty of non-superficial things," including "grants
and scholarship programs only a few people on campus
know about, ways to eat for free during the week, or the se
cret transportation systems to get around the area."
But the Stanford focus isn't the only departure from the
original Wikipedia — unlike its inspiration, this site is for
prolt. complete with sidebar ads.
I litrris, a native of Santa Rosa. Calif., spent his summer
vacation working at Wikia, a Wikipedia-spinoff startup in
Menlo Park launched by the Wikipedia founders. He said
he recognized the need for college students to share infor
mation freely, on any variety of topics relating to Universi
ty life.
Students expressed enthusiasm for the idea.
It seems like a good resource,"said freshman Michelle
Joyner. "And something I would be interested in."
Wikipedia.org, ranked as one of the twenty most visit
ed sites on the Web. has spawned an entire online phenom
enon of online content in which editing is open to the pub

lie, a movement often called referred to as wiki culture. In
keeping with this practice, any registered student may sign
up for the Stanford wiki (with a valid (? stanford.edu email
address) and proceed to modify a page.
"If you don't like the home page, you can change it,"
Harris said. "People often come to Wikia and say, 'Uh. I
think there's a bug in your site — I can edit it." But that's
the point — wikis count on the wisdom of the masses, that
every student knows at least one small hidden gem of in
formation that would be useful to other students, and gives
them a place to display it for all time."
Students agreed.
"If I find a mistake on the Stanford Wiki. I'll likely go in
and fix it." said sophomore Minh Nguyen. "And from
there. I 11 probably find another mistake. Eventually, I'll get
hooked.That's how things like this work."
ITic main page currently features headings on topics
such as Academics. Orientation. Computer and Internet.
Food and Drink and Life is More than Studying. From
there,individual articles include Faculty Reviews, Housing
Guide. WiFi Hotspots. Cheap Food and — best yet —
Ways to Eat for Free. With eight articles currently online,
the site awaits student text submissions on those and other
topics.
But Nguyen drew an inevitable comparison to the last
Website to require an (^Stanford.edu email address to reg
ister.
"I can't imagine Stanford students taking time away
from Face book to work on an article about recycling at
Stanford." he said. "I don't think its likely to get much stu
dent interest without some major changes.
Some students who identifies themselves as devoted
wiki fans said they were unimpressed with the Stanford
Wiki.
"If the site's I orum is made more prominent, the site
could be oriented more towards discussion, with the wiki's
articles being used to archive information by topic,"
Nguyen said. "But simply positioning the site as a Stan
ford-themed encyclopedia isn't something you could get
students too excited about."
