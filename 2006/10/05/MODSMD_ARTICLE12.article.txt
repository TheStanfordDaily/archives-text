## Editorial Board Time to bring back Course Guide 
### 
Over the past few years, the Editorial
Board has written several pieces
lamenting about the poor state of
('ourse (iuide. a site designed to provide stu
dents with evaluations of classes and profes
sors. Which was why we were pleased to
learn that the ASSU decided to make re
vamping the site a top priority ("ASSU plans
to improve Course Guide, solicit student
class evaluations." Oct. 10,2005 and "Course
Guide to undergo renovation." Jan. 31). Uni
versity Registrar Roger Printup even stated
that the site would be operational by winter
quarter of last year.
A trip to the ASSU's Web site reveals that
the organization will no longer sponsor
Course (iuide. which will be picked up by
the registrar's office. But now. nearly a year
after the proposed revamping, the registrar
has failed to live up to his promise to make
the site available last winter. On the con
trary. Course Guide has gone from poorly
functional to simply nonexistent. The site's
former Web address, http://course
guide.stanford.edu, is now just a dead link.
Ilus is a shame because the site has the
potential to become a useful resource for stu
dents unsure of which classes to take. Espe
cially with Stanford's two-week shopping pe
riod. it is often difficult lor students to judge
a course or professor based on only one or
two lectures. And with the plethora of op
tions listed in the Course Bulletin, students
may find picking classes a daunting process.
Course evaluations can give students a better
idea ot what to expect, letting them know
which classes are hard, which professors are
interesting and what the best way is to fulfill
that Applied Sciences GER. And with the in
creased popularity of sites like RateMvPro
fessor.com. it's clear that there is a large de
mand for this type of service.

ITiere are, however, some obvious draw
backs to judging classes on student evalua
tions. Many students do not take the evalua
tions seriously, leaving only vague and over
ly-generalized remarks or commenting on
frivolous factors such as a professor's "hot
ness." Others use the evaluations to vent
their personal frustration at receiving a bad
grade on an essay or exam. But among these,
there are also those students who take the
time to give thorough and insightful com
ments. Through these types of evaluations,
students can discover interesting classes and
good professors that they may not have oth
erwise encountered. And we hope that users
of Course Guide would be able to differenti
ate the latter type of comments from the for
mer.
If the site actually receives all of the reg
istrar's proposed improvements — the
elimination of paper evaluations in favor of
electronic ones, allowing only students who
have actually taken the class to submit
comments and closing comment submis
sions before students receive their grades
to reduce biases — many of the above
drawbacks will be reduced. But as of yet.
only one of these initiatives, the elimina
tion of paper evaluations, has been imple
mented. The evaluations have not been
made available to students and the few
comments that did exist are now also un
available.
We hope that the registrar's office will go
through on its promise, not only reinstating
Course Guide, but making it up to date, accu
rate and reliable. And if this overhaul will
not be possible in time for winter quarter,
the University should reopen the old Course
Guide site until the new one is complete, al
lowing students to benefit from the few re
marks that were there.
