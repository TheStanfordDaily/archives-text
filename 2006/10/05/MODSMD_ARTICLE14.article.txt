# Out and Aboutski: Kat Lewin
## Breakfast soup 
### 
Babushki — officially, the Russian
word for grandmothers, hut used to
refer to any old w—omen — have a
long tradition in Slavic literature, represent
ing the intelligence of age, typical witchipoo
characters or the hermaphroditic qualities of
life post-menopause. Hut for some reason I
had a hard time appreciating all this on my
first morning in Moscow as a 70-year-old
woman crouched over me breathing onion
in my face.
"We thought you were never going
to wake up!" my host father's mother spat
out in machine-gun Russian. After a few
croaking tries I managed to turn my head
and peel my eyes open enough to check my
alarm clock: 9:30 a.m. "Food will be ready in
a minute." she said, simultaneously closing
my suitcase, opening the windows and mak
ing the bed around me. Apparently mothers
are the same around the world.
len minutes later. I managed to
drag myself into the kitchen. After all, my
Russian may not be perfect, but my stomach
speaks it fluently, and it knows that Russians
do carbs like Liberace did sequins. My usual
morning bagel began to seem less and less
attractive as I contemplated the potential
wonders in store — possibly a bagel without
a hole? My mind boggled, my stomach
growled and 1 feasted my eyes on ... soup.
Cabbage soup. A vat of it at least six
inches deep, served with a sterling silver
shovel. At 9:30 in the morning. As 1 picked
up the spoon, all I could imagine were pris
oners in gulags picking the dregs of similar
soup, counting the cockroaches to figure out
how much extra protein they were getting. 1
started to ask, "Are those mushroom tops?"
but then decided I didn't particularly care to
know the answer. Girding myself up. 1 lifted
the spoon to my mouth.
Although 1 m a food person literal
ly to the bone, I've got a set of personal di
etary rules that make the Biblical laws of
kosher eating look like half-hearted sugges
tions. You know that phase five-year-olds go
through during which they eat nothing but
hot dog buns and grapes dipped in ketchup?
I've never grown out of mine. Finding some
thing I can eat on a menu is like playing
Where's Waldo. Blindfolded. However, re
luctant to commit serious cultural offenses
in my first waking hours in a new city. I swal
lowed my pride and some soup along with it.
To my surprise, it was delicious. Ap
parently there's a reason those traditional
Russian dolls are so. ahem, big-boned:
They're filled with delightful cabbage. The
first three inches of the soup were sheer joy;
as I worked my way down to the end of the
bowl, though. I periodically checked the
spoon like a dipstick to mark my progress.
Three inches.Two. One. Stomach groaning. I
proudly handed Babushka my bowl, emp

tied of all but a millimeter of liquid and a few
scraps of cabbage.
"What, you don't like my cook
ing.'" she yelped, it's true: Culture is nothing
more than the food you eat while you're
feeling guilty. While I was reflecting on this, I
heard It. The most terrifying noise I have
ever suffered through in my life.
There is a fabulous story about
Dostoevsky that all Russian majors have
heard and, for all I know, like to sit around
and tell each other when they get drunk. To
wit: Dostoevsky, involved in some sort of
countercultural reading circle, got appre
hended by the police and sentenced to
death. He stood on the platform, bowed his
head to give his last shout-out to God, and as
every step ot the executioner raised goose
bumps on his neck, he waited. Ten seconds
before he was about to be put to death, the
executioner informed him that by order of
the tsar, he and his fellow prisoners' lives
would be spared.
Die sound of burly executioners
sliding the muzzles of their oiled guns out of
holsters, prepared to take his life, could not
have scared Dostoevsky half as much as the
sound ot cutlets sizzling on the stove terri
tied me right at that moment. Seconds after
consuming my own body weight in soup, my
Babushka placed a fully-loaded plate of dry
kasha, cutlets and chicken on the table in
front of me. Stalling my obviously inevitable
demise, I meekly asked for a glass of water.
She immediately screamed and recoiled
from me so hard she dropped a bowl in the
sink. I replayed the sentence in my head, try
ing to figure out if I accidentally called her a
prostitute.
Apparently in Russia — a country
whose cuisine is traditionally loaded with
salt to mask the distinctive tang of sub-par
meat of Soviet days — drinking water while
eating a meal is an act of depravity on par
with child molestation or ventriloquism.The
food and water, she explained, make war in
your —she frantically flipped through a
Russian-to-English dictionary for emphasis
— "STOW-match."
Half of an uncomfortable hour
later, 1 shoveled the last bites into my
parched mouth and gratefully pushed my
plate away, thanking my Babushka for the
delicious meal. Surveying the remains of
gristle and bone on the plate she frowned,
"Leftovers are in the refrigerator. Remem
ber: He who eats little will soon be feeding
the worms."
Yeah—good luck to any worms
that dare trifle with the culinary prowess of a
true Russian Babushka.

Babushki — officially, the Russian
word for grandmothers, hut used to
refer to any old w—omen — have a
long tradition in Slavic literature, represent
ing the intelligence of age, typical witchipoo
characters or the hermaphroditic qualities of
life post-menopause. Hut for some reason I
had a hard time appreciating all this on my
first morning in Moscow as a 70-year-old
woman crouched over me breathing onion
in my face.
"We thought you were never going
to wake up!" my host father's mother spat
out in machine-gun Russian. After a few
croaking tries I managed to turn my head
and peel my eyes open enough to check my
alarm clock: 9:30 a.m. "Food will be ready in
a minute." she said, simultaneously closing
my suitcase, opening the windows and mak
ing the bed around me. Apparently mothers
are the same around the world.
len minutes later. I managed to
drag myself into the kitchen. After all, my
Russian may not be perfect, but my stomach
speaks it fluently, and it knows that Russians
do carbs like Liberace did sequins. My usual
morning bagel began to seem less and less
attractive as I contemplated the potential
wonders in store — possibly a bagel without
a hole? My mind boggled, my stomach
growled and 1 feasted my eyes on ... soup.
Cabbage soup. A vat of it at least six
inches deep, served with a sterling silver
shovel. At 9:30 in the morning. As 1 picked
up the spoon, all I could imagine were pris
oners in gulags picking the dregs of similar
soup, counting the cockroaches to figure out
how much extra protein they were getting. 1
started to ask, "Are those mushroom tops?"
but then decided I didn't particularly care to
know the answer. Girding myself up. 1 lifted
the spoon to my mouth.
Although 1 m a food person literal
ly to the bone, I've got a set of personal di
etary rules that make the Biblical laws of
kosher eating look like half-hearted sugges
tions. You know that phase five-year-olds go
through during which they eat nothing but
hot dog buns and grapes dipped in ketchup?
I've never grown out of mine. Finding some
thing I can eat on a menu is like playing
Where's Waldo. Blindfolded. However, re
luctant to commit serious cultural offenses
in my first waking hours in a new city. I swal
lowed my pride and some soup along with it.
To my surprise, it was delicious. Ap
parently there's a reason those traditional
Russian dolls are so. ahem, big-boned:
They're filled with delightful cabbage. The
first three inches of the soup were sheer joy;
as I worked my way down to the end of the
bowl, though. I periodically checked the
spoon like a dipstick to mark my progress.
Three inches.Two. One. Stomach groaning. I
proudly handed Babushka my bowl, emp

tied of all but a millimeter of liquid and a few
scraps of cabbage.
"What, you don't like my cook
ing.'" she yelped, it's true: Culture is nothing
more than the food you eat while you're
feeling guilty. While I was reflecting on this, I
heard It. The most terrifying noise I have
ever suffered through in my life.
There is a fabulous story about
Dostoevsky that all Russian majors have
heard and, for all I know, like to sit around
and tell each other when they get drunk. To
wit: Dostoevsky, involved in some sort of
countercultural reading circle, got appre
hended by the police and sentenced to
death. He stood on the platform, bowed his
head to give his last shout-out to God, and as
every step ot the executioner raised goose
bumps on his neck, he waited. Ten seconds
before he was about to be put to death, the
executioner informed him that by order of
the tsar, he and his fellow prisoners' lives
would be spared.
