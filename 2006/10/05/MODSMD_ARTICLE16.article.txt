## I should've said something 
### 
I was in a room full of straight people the
other night and this girl cracked a joke
about anal sex.
Awkward.
Awkward because I'm gay. Awkward be
cause everyone in the room knew it. Awk
ward because 1 had to decide whether I was
supposed to say something about it.
1 didn't say anything. Should 1 have? I'm
honestly not sure. At the time, all I wanted to
do was to get the hell out of there. 1 was em
barrassed. Not embarrassed for myself be
cause I have anal sex. but embarrassed for
the girl who made the joke and embarrassed
for the room 112 ull of people who laughed at it.
People can be so stupid?
But later that night I started to feel guilty
for not saying anything. Moments ago, I had
been in a roomful of my peers, a roomful of
Stanford students who read hundreds of

pages a year and who arguably understand
what they're reading. If there were an audi
ence ripe for a queer politics education, it
had been sitting right there in front of me and
1 hadn't said anything.
So what would I have said? I'd probably
start off all wrong because 1 was mad, saying
something like: "That's screwed up, stupid
straight girl. How do you have the audacity to
tell an anal sex joke, in front of a gay guy, in a
roomful of straight people? Do you know
that people in the U.S. and throughout the
world are killed for having anal sex? Do you
know the disabling shame that can surround
gay sex? Do you know that it's people like
you that create and perpetuate that shame?
Stop flaunting your hetero privilege, stop
Haunting your ignorance ... do us all a favor
and stop talking."
But. to be honest. I would probably have

started crying right after, "That's screwed up.
stupid straight girl." Sexuality is a touchy
subject for a guy who spent a good decade of
his life feeling bad about himself because so
ciety taught him that liking other boys in
stead of girls is icky.
And maybe that's where I should have
started in confronting this girl's joke: "Hey
girl, did you know that jokes like that make
some kids feel bad about themselves? Did
you know that degrading anal sex makes
boys who are attracted to other boys feel like
they re dirty .' And that it makes other boys
and girls think that gay men are dirty? The
homophobic world we live in came from
somewhere. Much of it came from well-edu
cated. well-intentioned, liberal people like
you. 1 know you didn't mean to offend me,
