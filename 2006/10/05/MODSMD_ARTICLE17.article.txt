Yesterday, the Editorial Board
commended Provost John
Etchemendy for taking a
strong stand on Stanford's decision
to keep its early admissions program
("Standing our ground"). The Board
also considered the various pros and
cons of early admissions policies,
suggesting that eliminating these
policies is not the most effective way
to benefit low-income students.

Why is it that this argument rarely em

admit more disadvantaged students is noble
an< J reflects the intention of all major univer
sities. flush with the kind of endowment that
only aggressive investment strategies and
generations of successful alumni donors can
yield. But the vast middle class of this coun
try has contributed more to society and in
vention than either end of the educated eco

class opts out of the Harvard or Stanford
choice matrix because they can't afford it. So
what are we left with when the fruit of this
new mission is realized? A Harvard campus

Perhaps. areaslejc... but as someone
from a middle class background. I never let
financial concerns dissuade me from sim
ply applying. And given the number of mid
dle income friends I made while at Stan
ford. I'd question whether many of the high
school students in question really feel the
pressures of which you speak. Further
more. Stanford, Princeton and Yale all ma
triculate around 70 percent of their admit
ted students. Harvard draws in nearly 90
percent of the kids who get big envelopes.
If, as I suggest, middle income students
aren't dissuaded from applying and if the
bulk of accepted students choose to attend
(indeed, most of the students who turn
down Stanford end up at peer institutions,
not less expensive state schools), where is
evidence of the problem?

The negative aspects of early admission
programs for potential applicants far out
weigh the potential institutional benefits for
elite schools — even Stanford. It sounds as
though both Yale and Stanford are reluc
tant to adopt the reform (which Yale Presi
dent Levin strongly endorsed five years
ago) either because: (1) they don't want to
be viewed as "followers" — even if the
leaders are doing the right thing: or (2) they
hope to gain some short-term advantage by

toasting on 'early bird specials" at the ex
pense of Harvard and Princeton. Neither
motivation is particularly noble.

Many thanks to Hie Stanford Daily and
I rovost tor your well-reasoned defenses of
early action. A few additional thoughts on
Harvard and Princeton s moves: The often
repeated suggestion that poorer students
cannot understand the "hocus pocus" of
early admissions is, quite simply, insulting.
Students who are even thinking about Stan
ford. Yale and their peer schools should at
the very least be expected to understand
basic information. Yale and Stanford must
not allow Harvard and Princeton to frame
this issue in economic terms, because it's re
ally about Harvard s attempt to reassert its
unquestioned dominance over the best ap
plicants. In recent years, Harvard has lost a
large number of top students to Stanford
and Yale (though it still retains the majority
of cross-admits). Much of this is due to early
action piograms at those two schools, where
approximately 90 percent of those admitted
early eventually matriculate. If Harvard suc
cessfully manages to use a bogus financial
argument to pressure Stanford and Yale into
abandoning policies that are extremely ad
vantageous both to the institutions and their
applicants, it will have succeeded in one hell
of a con job against its two main rivals.
