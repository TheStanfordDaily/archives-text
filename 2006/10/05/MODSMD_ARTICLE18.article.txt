## BAD BACK SLOWS LOPEZ FRESHMAN TO MISS TIME AFTER SURGERY Duke matchup possible, Haryasz reports to Houston camp 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
It is a dangerous time to he a star Stanford
athlete. After injuries sidelined receivers Mark
Bradford and Evan Moore and ended fullback
Nick Frank's career, it seems no one is safe â€”
not even on the basketball court.
Stanford freshman forward Brook Lopez un
derwent surgery to repair a bulging disk in his
back Sept. 22 in Palo Alto. His status for the sea
son opener against Sienna on Nov. 11 has not of
ficially been announced, but it seems unlikely
that the 7-foot Lopez will be ready. Lopez is not
expected to get back on the court for practice and
conditioning for another three to four weeks.
The San Francisco Chronicle is also report
ing that Lopez is hopeful to be back in playing
shape at some point before the Cardinal open
the Pac-10 season Dec. 28 at Arizona State.
Lopez and his twin brother Robin, both Mc-
Donald's All-Americans out of San Joaquin
Memorial High School in Fresno, Calif., are ex
pected to be major contributors for a team that
lost its top four scorers from a 2005-2006 squad
that finished 16-13, failing to make the NCAA
Tournament for the first time since 1994.
The pair is part of a group of five freshmen
joining the team. The other freshman are Will
Paul (Corpus Christi, Tex.), guard Da'Veed
Dildy (Chicago) and guard Landry Fields (Los
Alamitos, Calif.).
Schedule Released
The schedule for the 2006-2007 men's bas
ketball season was officially released this week

and included a few surprises.
The Cardinal have an opportunity to square
off against Duke for the first time since the
2000-2001 season in the semi finals of the Col
lege Basketball Experience (CBE) Classic in
Kansas City, Mo. Stanford is one of four hosts
for the first two rounds, along with Duke, Texas
Tech and Marquette.
The Cardinal would face the Blue Devils on
Nov. 20 at Municipal Auditorium if both teams
advance out of their home regionals.The Cardi
nal have to beat San Jose State and then the
winner of the Air Force-Long Beach State
match to advance, while Duke must get past Co
lumbia and the winner of a game between UC-
Davis and Georgia Southern to move on.
Stanford is also slated to face Texas Tech for
the first time in school history and could poten
tially see the Red Raiders twice, if both teams
advance to the CBE Classic finals. The guaran
teed meeting will take place at the Pete Newell
Challenge at HP Pavilion in San Jose on Dec. 3.
The event, in its 10th year, will take place in San
Jose for the first time after nine years in Oak
land.
The Cardinal open the campaign at Maples
Pavilion on Nov. 11 against Sienna, a team Stan
ford has not faced since the 1991-1992 season.
Northwestern also renews their series against
the Cardinal with a preseason visit to Palo Alto.
It will be the Wildcats first trip to Maples Pavil
ion since 1968.
After that, Stanford will open the Pac-10 sea
son Dec. 28 with a trip to Arizona State. The
Cardinal will then host Arizona March 3 to
close the conference slate.
Other notable games include a Dec. 19 trip
to Fresno State and a midseason matchup with
Virginia in Charlottesville, Va., on Jan. 7. The
