# Through My Eyes:
## Neftalem Araia 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
In this weeks edition of "Through My Eyes,'"The
Daily caught up with redshirt junior Neftalem
Araia. He is fresh off a victory in the 8,000-
meter long course at last weekend's Stanford Invita
tional, beating Chico State's Scotty Bauhs by five
seconds.
Araia has returned to form since missing all of the
2003 championship season due to a series of injuries.
The Indianapolis native will lead the Cardinal to the
Pre-NCAA meet in Terra Haute, Ind.,on Oct. 14.

The road to recovery
I was injured on and off for the whole 2003 sea
son. When I broke my foot in February [2(X)4J,
I didn't race again until the middle of October.
In nine months of not racing you really get
rusty. It is easy to shut down and cruise it out,
but all my teammates were really encouraging.
They wanted to help m.e out. They wanted me
to be a part of the team. I was able to get out of
that rut and try to get back on the road.

Mastering the pain
One of the most basic things you learn when you
start to run is that it is a physical task to defeat your op
ponent, but more than anything it is a mental game. And
the mental game isn't with your opposition; rather, it is
with yourself.The more you run.the more you recog
nize where your pain threshold is.
On race day, when someone challenges you, you
have to wonder, is this person willing to dig deeper than
I am to take the title? In other sports or other activities,
you can look at stats and look at numbers and figure out
who is going to win. In running, on some days you get
amazing athletes upset by dark horses, because on that
day they are tougher. That is the big X-factor in our
sport that makes it so much fun and so enjoyable, but so
painful and grueling at the same time.

Youth is served
When you're young in a sport like this,
where experience is so important, you will yo
yo back and forth from a lack of maturity. But
a bunch of the young guys have had to step up
when guys are injured or having bad days.
One thing that is great about this program is
that no one is head and shoulders above any
one else. Everyone is capable of leading and
everyone is accomplished in their own right.

Humming along
Our team doesn't get too wound up in
superstitions or traditions. We don't like to
get to wound up before events. But the
one thing that we do ritualistieally is that
we do the same cheer: "One-'l\vo-Threc-
Stanford. Onc-Two-Machine." We really
try to follow this analogy of the team as a
machine. We arc all parts of this well-oiled,
well-refined machine. All the pieces are in
terchangeable.

Missing a championship
Part of me was frustrated, but that was just me being young.That team that won the
title was above and beyond.They were all amazing runners and they really came to
gether and grew as a team over their time at Stanford. Even if I was healthy and tried
to make it onto that team, it would have been destructive to what they built together.
I'm happy with the way that it turned out — that I could see a championship team be
a championship team — and then try to build that with my own teammates.
Being a leader
I think all the guys on the team are really encouraging this year. If any of us sees an
other guy struggling and we have a word of advice or have ever been in the same situ
ation, we always try to get them back on their feet. Cross country is a sport that takes a
lot of endurance and a lot of patience, and without encouragement and support from
each other, we wouldn't be the team that we are. As one of the older guys. I am always
looking out to see how I can help my teammates, as they are for me.
