## Students cry foul over athlete perk Athletes defend Training Table as nutritional necessecity 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Training Table's recent move from Jimmy V's
Sports Cafe to Branner Dining Mall for dinner has
reopened the debate among students and athletes
over whether the Athletics Department-funded
meal program catering to varsity athletes constitutes
an act of favoritism.
Training Table is a joint effort by the Athletics
Department and Dining Services to provide athletes
with flexible meal times and food choices. It takes
place five days a week in Branner Dining from 6:30
to 8:30 p.m. In addition to many of the regular food
options served by dining halls around campus. Train
ing Table offers athletes a number of healthier alter
natives. such as high-protein dishes and low-sugar
options. Some students said that the move to Bran
ner Dining visually juxtaposes athlete perks with the
reality of other students.
"There are a number of extracurriculars on this
campus that simply don't get the same perks as
sports." said junior Amin El Gamal. echoing a com
mon complaint among students. "It can be really
draining because programs like theater and art are
just as valuable and don't have the financial benefit."
Athletes have defended the program, however,
pointing to the unique physical demands of playing a
NCCA-Divison I sport.
"I can see why people might look down on it. but
it's really the only option we have a lot of times," said
senior Nji Nnamani. who plays volleyball. "It's a
great way to make sure everyone eats right, and it
also allows us to build more team chemistry."
And while Training Table is an all-athlete pro
gram. only certain teams receive free meals. Varsity
squads eat at Branner Dining with varying frequen
cy— the basketball and football teams eat there
nightly; a handful of other sports like women's gym
nastics and women's volleyball dine there regularly;
yet many other teams have little or no access to the
facility.
"My feeling is that athletes do
burn a lot more calories than the rest
of the student population and there
fore, should get certain preferential
treatment," said Chris Emme, a 2005
graduate and former cross country
runner. "But 1 don't know why some
teams have access to training table
and others don't. Why should one ath
lete get a food stipend in addition to
Training Table meals and another get
only the stipend or a regular meal
plan?"
Susan Burk, assistant athletic di
rector for student services, said it is
only the head-count sports — a cate
gory of the NCAA that assures that
everyone on the particular sports
team gets a full financial ride — that
participate in Training Table. These
teams include, football, mens and
women's basketball, women's gym
nastics, women's volleyball and
women's tennis. Players on these
squads also have their dining hall
meal plans paid for by the Athletic
Department, and athletes that live in

Mirrielees or oft campus also receive
a quarterly cash stipend for food.
Senior Rachel Dyke, who plays
lacrosse, cannot participate in Train
ing Table, but dismisses criticism of
the program, arguing that the Univer
sity's preferential treatment of ath
letes is minimal.
"1 can see if you've never played
sports and never been exposed to an
athletic department that you might
see certain favoritism," Dyke said.
"But compared to other universities
and even some high schools, Stanford
does not give athletes the extra push
at all.They support them.and it would
be almost criminal not to."
In addition to dinners at Branner
five nights a week. Training Table
breakfasts are offered at Jimmy V's
Sports Cafe. Certain student athletes
are given a specific budget that they
can use to choose from an extensive
menu. While the Cafe is associated
primarily with sports teams, owner
Jimmy V (who declined to give his full
last name) said it is a common mis
conception that the cafe is exclusively
for athletes.
"These athletes are not getting
anything that anyone else can't get."
he said, citing the fact that students
can pay for meals from the Cafe. "Any
student can come in at any time and

get what they want. People think of us
as just working for athletes because of
our location, hut I've done jobs for
the Drama department. Admit Week
end. various class reunions and [Can
tor] museum."
Many students who expressed
frustration with Training Table did so
under uncertainty over the source of
funding for the program.
"If the funding for this plan comes
from the general University funding
and not the Athletics Department,
then 1 think it's unacceptable because
it clearly favors a portion of the
school, and I think that Stanford is at
least as academic as it is athletic," said
Junior Sahand Rabbani.'i don't care
what they do as long as I'm not paying
for it."
According to Burk,the program is
funded by the Athletics Department
as part of the students' scholarships.
"Out of the 9(X) student athletes in
all of our 35 sports...only about 146
participate in Training Table, and
most of them live off campus so they
don't have a dining service," Buric
said. "It's unfortunate what students
think about the preferential treat
ment because compared to other
schools, we don't do anything to cater
our athletes. ITiey have to do every
thing themselves."

Sports Cafe to Branner Dining Mall for dinner has
reopened the debate among students and athletes
over whether the Athletics Department-funded
meal program catering to varsity athletes constitutes
an act of favoritism.
Training Table is a joint effort by the Athletics
Department and Dining Services to provide athletes
with flexible meal times and food choices. It takes
place five days a week in Branner Dining from 6:30
to 8:30 p.m. In addition to many of the regular food
options served by dining halls around campus. Train
ing Table offers athletes a number of healthier alter
natives. such as high-protein dishes and low-sugar
options. Some students said that the move to Bran
ner Dining visually juxtaposes athlete perks with the
reality of other students.
"There are a number of extracurriculars on this
campus that simply don't get the same perks as
sports." said junior Amin El Gamal. echoing a com
mon complaint among students. "It can be really
draining because programs like theater and art are
just as valuable and don't have the financial benefit."
Athletes have defended the program, however,
pointing to the unique physical demands of playing a
NCCA-Divison I sport.
"I can see why people might look down on it. but
it's really the only option we have a lot of times," said
senior Nji Nnamani. who plays volleyball. "It's a
great way to make sure everyone eats right, and it
also allows us to build more team chemistry."
And while Training Table is an all-athlete pro
gram. only certain teams receive free meals. Varsity
squads eat at Branner Dining with varying frequen
cy— the basketball and football teams eat there
nightly; a handful of other sports like women's gym
nastics and women's volleyball dine there regularly;
yet many other teams have little or no access to the
facility.
"My feeling is that athletes do
burn a lot more calories than the rest
of the student population and there
fore, should get certain preferential
treatment," said Chris Emme, a 2005
graduate and former cross country
runner. "But 1 don't know why some
teams have access to training table
and others don't. Why should one ath
lete get a food stipend in addition to
Training Table meals and another get
only the stipend or a regular meal
plan?"
Susan Burk, assistant athletic di
rector for student services, said it is
only the head-count sports — a cate
gory of the NCAA that assures that
everyone on the particular sports
team gets a full financial ride — that
participate in Training Table. These
teams include, football, mens and
women's basketball, women's gym
nastics, women's volleyball and
women's tennis. Players on these
squads also have their dining hall
meal plans paid for by the Athletic
Department, and athletes that live in

Mirrielees or oft campus also receive
a quarterly cash stipend for food.
Senior Rachel Dyke, who plays
lacrosse, cannot participate in Train
ing Table, but dismisses criticism of
the program, arguing that the Univer
sity's preferential treatment of ath
letes is minimal.
"1 can see if you've never played
sports and never been exposed to an
athletic department that you might
see certain favoritism," Dyke said.
"But compared to other universities
and even some high schools, Stanford
does not give athletes the extra push
at all.They support them.and it would
be almost criminal not to."
In addition to dinners at Branner
five nights a week. Training Table
breakfasts are offered at Jimmy V's
Sports Cafe. Certain student athletes
are given a specific budget that they
can use to choose from an extensive
menu. While the Cafe is associated
primarily with sports teams, owner
Jimmy V (who declined to give his full
last name) said it is a common mis
conception that the cafe is exclusively
for athletes.
"These athletes are not getting
anything that anyone else can't get."
he said, citing the fact that students
can pay for meals from the Cafe. "Any
student can come in at any time and

get what they want. People think of us
as just working for athletes because of
our location, hut I've done jobs for
the Drama department. Admit Week
end. various class reunions and [Can
tor] museum."
Many students who expressed
frustration with Training Table did so
under uncertainty over the source of
funding for the program.
"If the funding for this plan comes
from the general University funding
and not the Athletics Department,
then 1 think it's unacceptable because
it clearly favors a portion of the
school, and I think that Stanford is at
least as academic as it is athletic," said
Junior Sahand Rabbani.'i don't care
what they do as long as I'm not paying
for it."
According to Burk,the program is
funded by the Athletics Department
as part of the students' scholarships.
"Out of the 9(X) student athletes in
all of our 35 sports...only about 146
participate in Training Table, and
most of them live off campus so they
don't have a dining service," Buric
said. "It's unfortunate what students
think about the preferential treat
ment because compared to other
schools, we don't do anything to cater
our athletes. ITiey have to do every
thing themselves."
