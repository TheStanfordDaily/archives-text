# Seeing green and gold

Tuesday's Daily featured the
prediction of my fellow colum
nist. Andrew Lomeli, who sees
a Dodger postseason run reminis
cent of the last year that team won
more than one game in any postsea
son _ 1988. He sees the momentum
of Dodger Blue; the arms of Derek
Lowe,Greg Maddux and Hing Chih-
Kuo; and the bats of Jeff Kent,
Nomar Garciaparra, J.D. Drew and
Rafael Furcal as being more than
enough to lift the Dodgers to a cham
pionship and bring a series victory
home to Los Angeles.
1 disagree.
Of course, I'm blessed with a few
advantages my colleague lacked at
the time he wrote his piece on the
boys from Hollywood. For one, sev
eral postseason games are over and
done with. For another, I'm picking
an American League team to win it
all, which, judging by interleague
play this year, gives me a significant
advantage. And finally, my senses are
not obscured by a blue haze of good
old L. A. smog.
But maybe the best reason you
can trust my opinion is that 1 hate
giving it to you. As a Giants fan. I'm
fairly disgusted by the outcome 1
think we'll see this October. Maybe

it's more palatable than a Dodgers
championship, hut only just barely.
Because this year, there's going to
be a championship parade in Oak
land.
Putting aside the images of crime
sprees, looting and Raider jerseys
that came to my mind, I tried to think
about this whole postseason objec
tively. Barring a minor miracle, we
can start by saying the Al. will al
most certainly come out on top of
this year's World Series. Of the four
NL lineups in the postseason, the
only one that wouldn't be embar
rassed by any of its possible Al. op
ponents is that of the Mets, but New
York's pitching is currently in sham
bles.
Just two days ago. I was fully pre
pared to be writing this column
touting the Minnesota Twins as the
eventual 2006 World Champions.
But after two losses at home, over
coming Oakland's momentum
seems too tall an order for Joe
Mauer, Justin Morneau, Johan San
tana and company. The Tigers, from
all indications to date, are dead in

the water, leaving the A's and Bronx
Bombers to battle it out for the AL
Pennant.
Will it be an easy task for the A's
to overcome this incarnation of the
Murderers' Row? Of course not.
Randy Johnson and the rest of the
so-called pitching staff won't be
enough. 1 do not doubt the talents of
Mike Mussina. Mariano Rivera or
Chien-Ming Wang, but 1 would argue
that three competent pitchers are
not enough to make it to a World Se
ries.
But there's one more thing the
A's have to overcome to finally win
one in the Billy Beane era — their
own history of postseason inepti
tude. Yet there are signs that even
that dark cloud may finally be dissi
pating. For one. 112 rank Thomas has
added a dimension of raw power to
the Oakland offense that it has
seemingly lacked since the Jason Gi
ambi days. Added to a breakout sea
son from Nick Swisher and a solid —
if unspectacular — rotation led by
Barry Zito, the As feature a bal
anced team that doesn't really have
any huge weaknesses. Only closer
Huston Street has been somewhat of
a question mark as of late, and if you
consider that Byung-Hyun Kim was
good enough to win a championship
with the Diamondbacks,Street does

n't look half had.
Winning in the postseason in re
cent years has been about two things
— pitching and momentum. Until
lUesday, I thought the Twins had
both of those in excess, even without
young phenom Francisco Liriano in
their rotation. But the As charge
proved too much, and a sweep could
be in the cards for the team that had
been playing like there was no to
morrow since June.
And now,suddenly, there really is
no tomorrow for the Twins with an
other loss, making the As the undis
puted kings of momentum and
pitching in the AL„ thus the leading
candidates to win this year's World
Series.
Which is why I predict a sea of
green ruling October. A sea of green
wearing white cleats, perhaps the
biggest aesthetic faux-pas in all of
sports — surpassing even the
hideous all-yellow Oregon football
unis.
But as much I cringe a little bit at
the thought of that victory parade in
Oakland, it is still better than a
happy Tommy Lasorda.
