# Seeing green and gold

Tuesday's Daily featured the
prediction of my fellow colum
nist. Andrew Lomeli, who sees
a Dodger postseason run reminis
cent of the last year that team won
more than one game in any postsea
son _ 1988. He sees the momentum
of Dodger Blue; the arms of Derek
Lowe,Greg Maddux and Hing Chih-
Kuo; and the bats of Jeff Kent,
Nomar Garciaparra, J.D. Drew and
Rafael Furcal as being more than
enough to lift the Dodgers to a cham
pionship and bring a series victory
home to Los Angeles.
1 disagree.
Of course, I'm blessed with a few
advantages my colleague lacked at
the time he wrote his piece on the
boys from Hollywood. For one, sev
eral postseason games are over and
done with. For another, I'm picking
an American League team to win it
all, which, judging by interleague
play this year, gives me a significant
advantage. And finally, my senses are
not obscured by a blue haze of good
old L. A. smog.
But maybe the best reason you
can trust my opinion is that 1 hate
giving it to you. As a Giants fan. I'm
fairly disgusted by the outcome 1
think we'll see this October. Maybe
