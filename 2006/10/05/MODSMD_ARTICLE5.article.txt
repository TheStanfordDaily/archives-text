# With 10 pages to go, senior loses thesis, research when laptop swiped
## Starting from scratch 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It is every student's worst nightmare.
It was the theme of the 1994 comedy
"With Honors." And now.it is senior An
gela Steele's reality. With 30 pages down
and 10 to go. her honors thesis and every
trace of it have vanished after a thief
swiped her laptop bag from Roble Gym
two weeks ago.
" ITiinking about my thesis and the
fact that all of my work from the past
year had just completely disappeared —
that's what made me really hysterical,"
she said, describing her initial reaction to
the theft. She has been working on the

thesis — for the Cultural and Social An
thropology Department — about hip
hop culture in Beijing for over a year.
Steele said she was running late for
her first day of work at Roble Gym and
set her bag at the front desk while she
went to the bathroom. When she re
turned just minutes later, her bag —
keys, laptop, thumb drive, wallet, cell
phone included — had vanished. She
searched the area and filed a police re
port. but disbelief turned to hysteria
when she called her mother to cancel
credit cards.
"She thought 1 had been in a car acci
dent," she said. Steele had printed no
hardcopies, and the thesis backup file was

on the thumb drive, which was also stolen.
Steele didn't wait for action from the
police. She sent emails to dorm chatlists,
littered campus with flyers and talked to
instructors who were teaching classes at
Roble Gym at the time of the theft,but to
no avail.
"Nothing's turned up, and I haven't
had any leads," she said. "No one saw
anything. It was such a short amount of
time that it's really strange that it hap
pened at all."
One person she hasn't talked to yet is
her thesis advisor, but Steele isn't wor
ried.

Senior Angela Steele dropped her bag off at
her desk at Roble Gym and went to the bath
room. Three minutes later, the bag, her laptop
and every shred of her thesis were gone.
"She's really amazing, really supportive, so I'm sure
she'll just have really encouraging words," she said.
Other mentors have been lending support as well.
"All she wants is her thesis," said Susan Cann. Steele's
supervisor and the office manager of the Stanford Dance
Division. "All that work, all that time — you just can't re
place that."
Although she does have copies of earlier drafts
that she had emailed to her advisor, Steele said she
will have to recreate most of her work. The most im
portant information for her thesis, such as interview
transcripts and translated lyrics, were also on her com
puter.
Steele, however, said that she feels a responsibility to
do a good job and not to let down all the people who
helped her with research along the way.
"Everyone's telling me it's going to be better than be
fore because I'm going to go back and rethink ideas and
rework things," she said. "I hope so. Right now I'm not
motivated to do it at all."
Steele received dozens of email responses from other
students, who offered suggestions.
Varun Swarup, a co-terminal student in mechanical
engineering and a former Residential Computing Con
sultant (RCC), said you can triangulate the location of
any registered computer if it is using campus wireless.

After reading Steele's email, just two hours after it was
stolen, he located her laptop in the Escondido Village
network. In this case, however, the thief connected to the
internet using an Ethernet cable, and its exact location
could not be determined.
Steele still emailed the police to report Swarup's find
ings, but said she never received a response.
"1 think it is pretty standard for stolen property cases
that the police don't really do anything," she said. "They
just file a report and let it go, and if something turns up.
then something turns up."
According to Deputy Sheriff Ken Bates, there were 75
reported instances of laptop theft or burglary from Sep
tember 2005 through June 2006. Seven laptops have been
reported stolen since Sept. 1, he said. Bates urged stu
dents to report these thefts.
"It helps us figure out whether this is a random, isolat
ed occurrence or whether we are starting to see a trend."
he said. "Although Stanford is a relatively safe communi
ty, never turn your back on any of your property," he
added.
Steele had just one message for the thief.
"Keep everything else and just send me my thesis!"
Her paper is labeled on her desktop as "Thesis," and
can be sent anonymously to P.O. Box 17050, Stanford.
CA. 94309 or asteele@stanford.edu.
