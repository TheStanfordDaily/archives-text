# With 10 pages to go, senior loses thesis, research when laptop swiped
## Starting from scratch 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It is every student's worst nightmare.
It was the theme of the 1994 comedy
"With Honors." And now.it is senior An
gela Steele's reality. With 30 pages down
and 10 to go. her honors thesis and every
trace of it have vanished after a thief
swiped her laptop bag from Roble Gym
two weeks ago.
" ITiinking about my thesis and the
fact that all of my work from the past
year had just completely disappeared —
that's what made me really hysterical,"
she said, describing her initial reaction to
the theft. She has been working on the

thesis — for the Cultural and Social An
thropology Department — about hip
hop culture in Beijing for over a year.
Steele said she was running late for
her first day of work at Roble Gym and
set her bag at the front desk while she
went to the bathroom. When she re
turned just minutes later, her bag —
keys, laptop, thumb drive, wallet, cell
phone included — had vanished. She
searched the area and filed a police re
port. but disbelief turned to hysteria
when she called her mother to cancel
credit cards.
"She thought 1 had been in a car acci
dent," she said. Steele had printed no
hardcopies, and the thesis backup file was

on the thumb drive, which was also stolen.
Steele didn't wait for action from the
police. She sent emails to dorm chatlists,
littered campus with flyers and talked to
instructors who were teaching classes at
Roble Gym at the time of the theft,but to
no avail.
"Nothing's turned up, and I haven't
had any leads," she said. "No one saw
anything. It was such a short amount of
time that it's really strange that it hap
pened at all."
One person she hasn't talked to yet is
her thesis advisor, but Steele isn't wor
ried.

Senior Angela Steele dropped her bag off at
her desk at Roble Gym and went to the bath
room. Three minutes later, the bag, her laptop
and every shred of her thesis were gone.
