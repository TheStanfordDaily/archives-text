As the quarter's initial optimism settles into harsh I
reality, and students push sleep cycles later and later. \
breakfast often becomes a wistful dream of the past, I
and as you lie in bed in the hazy minutes between
snooze buttons, you might ask yourself a basic question:
Is it time to switch my meal plan from 19 to 14 meals a
week?
At the beginning of the year, students choose be
tween 19-, 14- and 10-meal plans, with fewer meals a
week meaning more Cardinal Dollars (credits that can
be used at Late Nite, Subway, the Coffee House, and
other retail locations). Students can change their plans
until tomorrow without penalty, but many late-sleepers
wanting the extra flexibility of fewer meals are doing
the math.
The $1,792 price tag of all plans roughly breaks down
into just over $9 a meal for the 19-meal option. But with
a 14-meal plan, students get just 155 Cardinal Dollars â€”
about $3 per meal gained.

"You can't survive

on $3 a meal for the rest of your meals," said fresh
man David Keeler, who said he wants more flexibility to
try out other campus eateries. "No lunch will be $3."
But Rafi Taherian, executive director of Stanford
Dining, defended this exchange rate, noting that since
dining halls cannot predict when students will fill cafete-,
rias, more food is inevitably prepared than consumed.
And while he said Dining takes student eating patterns
into account to plan meals and limit waste, operational
costs like labor, facility maintenance and utilities remain

constant regardless of the number of students at each
meal.
Freshman Fom Wiltzius said he sympathized with
Taherian's logic.
"Do they ever run out of food?" he asked. "No. It they
did. would everyone be hella pissed? Yes. So 1 can under
stand that reasoning."
But Taherian admitted that students with the 14- and
10-meal plans get the short end of the financial stick.
"The cost per meal for the 19 meals/week plan is
lower than all other meal plan options." he said." ITiesj
guys get the best mileage, the best deal tor their money.
Jason Helmers. meal plan coordinator and financial
analyst for Stanford Dining, estimated that between 300
and 400 students are on the 19-meal plan, and that that
the remaining 3,100 students are roughly divided be
tween the other two plans.
Dining officials said they recognized that many stu
dents are substituting a missed breakfast with late night
options at Lakeside and Stern Cyber Cate.
"We have expanded the late night menus this year to
account for students staying up later and eating regular
meals during late at night," said Senior Associate Direc
tor of Student Dining Eric Montell. lie guessed that 90

percent of students at Late Nite or Cyber Cafe use Car
dinal Dollars for late night purchases.
Dining officials said that they are constantly looking
for ways to improve services, often collaborating with
the ASSU and administrators. I lelmers announced l ues
day that students on the 14- and 10-meal plans will be
able to "roll over" unused meals to the next week (1 meal
for the 10-meal plan and up to 2 meals for the 14-meal
plan). Students on the full 19-meal plan will have three
additional guest meals allotted to them.
"The ASSU has been working very closely with Din
ing to fill our campaign promise and provide students
with rollover meals," said senior Elizabeth Heng.ASSU
president. "Dining has done a phenomenal job imple
menting this new initiative and there are a few more to
come."
Some students said they see further room for im
provement. Freshman Jordan I lurwich suggested a pos
sible solution for the students that eat lunch as their tirst
meal of the day, and depend heavily on Stern's Cyber
Cafe or Lakeside's Late Nite for their third meal.
"They should institute a meal plan that if you guaran
tee you won't go to breakfast, you get more points. It
would be a lunch, dinner, plus points plan."
