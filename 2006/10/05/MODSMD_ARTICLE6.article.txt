As the quarter's initial optimism settles into harsh I
reality, and students push sleep cycles later and later. \
breakfast often becomes a wistful dream of the past, I
and as you lie in bed in the hazy minutes between
snooze buttons, you might ask yourself a basic question:
Is it time to switch my meal plan from 19 to 14 meals a
week?
At the beginning of the year, students choose be
tween 19-, 14- and 10-meal plans, with fewer meals a
week meaning more Cardinal Dollars (credits that can
be used at Late Nite, Subway, the Coffee House, and
other retail locations). Students can change their plans
until tomorrow without penalty, but many late-sleepers
wanting the extra flexibility of fewer meals are doing
the math.
The $1,792 price tag of all plans roughly breaks down
into just over $9 a meal for the 19-meal option. But with
a 14-meal plan, students get just 155 Cardinal Dollars â€”
about $3 per meal gained.

"You can't survive

on $3 a meal for the rest of your meals," said fresh
man David Keeler, who said he wants more flexibility to
try out other campus eateries. "No lunch will be $3."
But Rafi Taherian, executive director of Stanford
Dining, defended this exchange rate, noting that since
dining halls cannot predict when students will fill cafete-,
rias, more food is inevitably prepared than consumed.
And while he said Dining takes student eating patterns
into account to plan meals and limit waste, operational
costs like labor, facility maintenance and utilities remain
