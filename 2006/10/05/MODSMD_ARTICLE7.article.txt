When it rains, it pours —at least with Nohel
Prizes.
Prof. Roger Romberg of the Stanford Medical
School was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
early yesterday morning for his research on the mo
lecular basis of eukaryotic transcription.
Kornberg could not be reached for comment, but
his son, Stanford junior Guy Kornberg, said he
thought the prize was well-deserved.
"Of course we were all very surprised to hear the
news," he said. "It's been really hectic at home ever
since about 3 a.m. this morning, but at the same time
it's a lot of fun and really exciting."
Kornberg, the Mrs. George A. Winzer Professor of
Medicine, has focused his efforts over the last several
years on understanding how the ge
netic code in DNA is transferred
into RNA. in a process known as
"transcription." He made the first
major breakthrough in this study in
2001, when he produced a molecu
lar image of RNA polymerase, a key
player in the transcription.
I (is studies on the way to the
Nobel Prize have earned Kornberg
many other accolades, including the
Harvey Prize in 1997, the Gairdner
International Award in 2000, the
Welch Award in 2001 and the Grand

Prix of the French Academy of Sci
ences in 2002.
His discoveries helped explain
how all of the genetic information
stored in a strand of DNA is ex
pressed — especially elucidating
how errors in transcription can lead
to cancer and birth defects.
Kornberg was notified of his
award only days after Andrew l ire,
also a professor at the Medical
School, was announced as this
year's Nobel Laureate for Physiolo
gy or Medicine for his work on
RNA interference. The two men
know each other well. In fact, they
met at Cambridge where they were
both post-doctoral researchers.
Roger is not the first Kornberg
to win a Nobel. His father Arthur

won the 1959 Award in Physiolo
gy or Medicine for his study of
how genetic information is trans
ferred from one UNA strand to
another.
Roger and Arthur Kornberg are
not alone as father-son Nobel duos,
however. There have been five
other such pairs, and one father
daughter pair.
Medical School Dean Philip
Pizzo applauded Stanford's second
Nobel Prize winner this week.
"Roger Kornberg is one of our na
tion's treasured scientists," Pizzo
said."l lis work has deepened our un
derstanding of the 'message of life'
and how it contributes to both nor
mal and abnormal human develop
ment. health and disease."
