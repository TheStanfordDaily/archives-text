## Curator: Univ not father of Valley boom Says Stanford was only partly responsible for Silicon Valley's birth

Lowood challenged the "proud papa" myth that the
University single-handedly spawned Silicon Valley in a
talk last night sponsored by the Stanford Historical So
ciety.
According to Lowood. several steps taken by the
University during the 1950s helped catalyze the migra
tion of technology companies into the Santa Clara Val
ley region now known as Silicon Valley Although he ac
knowledged that Stanford played a major role in the
Peninsula's development, he questioned the wide
spread notion that Stanford alone is responsible for Sil
icon Valley In his talk, he offered a complex alternative
view of the Peninsula's success in which Stanford re
search, federal grants and business strategies all played
significant parts.
"The origins of Silicon Valley are much more diverse
than the word 'spawning' suggests," I ,owood said, refer
ring to the talk's title, "How Stanford Spawned Silicon
Valley: A Historical Perspective."
He also reexamined the contributions
made by former Stanford provost Fred Ter
man, widely referred to as the "father of Sili
con Valley," in shaping the region.
While many sources point to Terman's
1953 development of the Stanford Industrial
Park as pivotal to the birth of Silicon Valley,
Lowood credits the influx of federal funds
and government contracts from companies
such as Defense-Aerospace as the most im
portant factor. ITiis federally-funded Univer
sity research, Lowood said, led to additional
research and innovation that eventually in
fluenced the Valley's creation Because of the
tactics Terman and the University employed
to attract government funding, he did ac

knowledge that Silicon Valley as it is known
today would not likely exist if Stanford had
not existed in the 19505.
"I would say Silicon Valley is a singularity,
and therefore it could not have existed with
out Stanford." Lowood said. "There would
have been some technology industry here."
As to the future of Silicon Valley and its
relationship with the University, Lowood
offered examples of how Silicon Valley is
quickly becoming "the new Hollywood" as
Silicon Valley-based Pixar are becoming
major players in on entertainment and
movies. In some respects, the area is even
beginning to rival major Hollywood compa
nies with the services and technology it pro
vides to all areas of entertainment, he said.

And Stanford, which continues to supply
the industries in the region with capital in
vestments, research and new personnel
flows of University graduates, stands to ben
efit even further.
"The two-way relationship between Stan
ford and Silicon Valley has expanded beyond
what Fred Terman could have dreamed of in
the 19505," Lowood said.
But while Silicon Valley has and remains a
major source of new technology, the image of
the area has changed considerably through
the years, he said.
"Geeks are dead — they're all capitalists
now," he said, describing the conventional
wisdom. But he argued that the "nerds" are
as present as they've ever been, and that

throughout its diverse history', businessmen
have always played as integral a role as
"geeks."
Audience members reacted favorably to
Lowood's lecture.
"I thought his talk was wonderful because
it didn't try to say that Silicon Valley was a
simple plan " said History Prof. Peter Stan
sky.
In addition to his role as curator of the
I listory of Science and Technology Collec
tions. Lowood is well known for his pioneer
ing works on the history of computer games,
including his book on their development.
"How They Got Game: Ibe History and Cul
ture of Interactive Simulations and
Videogames."
