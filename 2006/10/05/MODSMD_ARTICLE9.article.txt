l or alumna Jude Avery, a donation to Stan
tord is truly the gift that keeps on giving.
After Avery, chair of the Durfee Founda
tion.doled out a generous $10 million gift to the
Stanford Teacher Education Program (STEP)
a the School of Education, the University an
nounced that it would match the gift and allo
cate this funding toward a $20 million loan-for
giveness program to holster STEP's K-12
teacher recruitment and training efforts.
Under this new program, half of eligible
Sill' students' loans are forgiven if they teach
for two years, while those who teach for four
years will have all loan debts cancelled. All
ST I P students who commit to teaching in pub
lic school after graduating from the program
can qualify for loan forgiveness. Those who
teach in private schools serving underserved
communities may also qualify.
' 1 think this is transformative, and I think it
will make the program much more affordable,"
said Dean Deborah Stipek of the School of Ed
ucation. "It will attract students who before
thought either Stanford or being trained as a
teacher was too expensive, and so it should
bring new, talented people into the field of edu
cation."
Hie University matched Avery's gift to em
phasize its strong support for K-12 education,
according to a Stanford News Service press re
lease. In the same release, Stanford President
John Hennessy lauded Avery's generosity and
reemphasized Stanford's commitment to im
proving the K-12 education sector.
"This new program will permit Stanford to
support visionary and committed young people
who want to undertake one of the most impor
tant roles we have in our society," Hennessy said.
Hie fund will be named after Avery's moth
er. Dorothy Durfee Avery, who was also a
schoolteacher.
Rebecca T. Smith, associate dean for exter
nal relations for the School of Education, ex
pressed hope that Avery's generosity will be
well served with this n3ew loan-forgiveness
program.
"We're so overjoyed for what this generous
gift will mean for future candidates," Smith
said.
