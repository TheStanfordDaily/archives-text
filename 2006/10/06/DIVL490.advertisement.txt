IWear a sweater.
Put an extra blanket on the bed.
Keep your window closed.
It's been cooler ... Why isn't the heat turned on?' We typically
don't do that until late October when outside temperatures get and
stay cooler. It will be back in the 70's in a few days! Until then, you
can keep comfortably warm by wearing a sweater, using an extra
blanket, closing your window, and drawing the shades at night. Join
us in our commitment to conserve energy.
