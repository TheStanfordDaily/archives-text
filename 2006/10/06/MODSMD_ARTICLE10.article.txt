# BEYOND THE FARM
## NYT editor addresses students Describes difficulties of reporting from the front, says Arabic speakers needed 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
In the rough streets of Baghdad, the
Paper of Record spends $3 million a
year to maintain a compound com
plete with blast walls, a reporting staff
of about 80 Iraqis and full-time armed
guards, nicknamed the "New York
Times Militia."
From a staff fatality to following the
trail of two kidnapped correspondents,
the foreign editor of The New York
Times, Susan Chira, offered a striking
glimpse into the sophisticated news
gathering operation that is the Bagh
dad bureau, in a Thursday night speech
to a well-attended Tressider Oak

Room.
Reporting on the deepening sectar
ian violence in Iraq is perhaps more
challenging than the Herculean task of
establishing lasting stability in the war
torn country. I"he New York limes
must cope with this sobering reality
and deal with extreme challenges —
both physical and political. The stakes
are high, she said, and the risk is real.
"All of it is really unprecedented in
our experience," said Chira. while de
scribing the ever-declining freedom of
reporters to travel in Iraq.
Where protecting personal safety
and breaking the big story can be mu
tually exclusive, she said tough judg
ment calls must be made.
Chira said she gets calls at 3 a.m.
from her reporters in combat zones
wanting to know whether they should
risk traveling down a volatile road or
venturing into a hostile neighborhood.
"Insurgents actually read The
Times." she said. "We know they

Google it. And we know they know by
lines."
The immersion into the lives of sub
jects covered in The Times' stories has
become harder than ever in Iraq. Chira
said, because it's often not safe to ven
ture out into the streets or visit people
in their homes.
"It's a much more prolonged
process,and it requires a lot of patience
and filtering," she said. She offered re
porter Sabrina Tavernise as an exam
ple. who spent months trying to get all
the pieces for a story about the system
atic assassination of Shia bakers.
One of the ways ITie Times gathers
information is through locals who can
file dispatches from turbulent areas
not safe for Westerners. But this prac
tice has drawn concerns about bias, ac
curacy and verifiability of information
learned from inexperienced Iraqis.
"Over the years, we have been able
to winnow the people who are un
trustworthy and have agendas." she
said. "Wherever possible, we don't
rely solely on the Irac|i stall."
But even in the relatively harmo
nious newsroom of the Baghdad bu
reau. there is occasional conflict be
tween Sunni, Shiite and Kurd stall
members, she said — a microcosm of
the intractable clash of cultures with
in the Iraq theater.
"There are tensions that arise
when people are coming from a dit
ferent place," she said, mentioning
that tempers flared during the trial of
former Iraqi leader Saddam Hus
sein.
Another information-gathering
mechanism that The Times uses is
embedding reporters with military
forces. Some media observers criti
cize this tactic, worrying that Ameri
can officials can control what re
porters see and provide a misleading
view of what's happening by reiterat
ing the party line.
"Sometimes you sit there for 10
days and you can't get a helicopter

out and you're stuck and you're
screwed." she said.
But embedded reporters often
get good information from candid
soldiers at all ranks, Chira said.
"We've found great insights front
living with units for a period of time,
she said.
Other times, governments ma\
flat-out lie.
"What is truth?" Chira asked.
"There's a realK elastic definition,
and we don't find that Iraqi officials
are always candid with us."
Without full access, it's hard to be
sure about some important details.
She cited the lack of accurate civilian
casualty numbers as a symptom of
the larger informational deficiency.
The Paper of Record also comes
under fire in a more figurative sense
the consequence of a politically
charged climate and the high stakes
of the war.
"There's enormous pressure from
the perspective of supporters of the
war." she said. "And there is perhaps
greater pressure from critics of the

war who want The New York Times
to declare it a failure."
Chira, who has been foreign edi
tor since Jan. 2004. defended The
l imes' credibility, which came under
fire for its pre-Iraq war coverage.
" 1 lie New York l imes frames a
lot of perspectives, and we have a re
sponsibility to get it as right as we
can." she said. "You are always held
to a higher standard."
She said the paper has not been
perfect.
Only a few of the paper's Middle
Hast correspondents speak Arabic,
Chira acknowledged.
"I veryone else relies on transla
tors.' she said. "We're working really
hard to cultivate Arabic speakers
and bring them through the ranks."
But it will always take more than
fluenc\ in Arabic to win a coveted
foreign post from most widely re
spected newspaper in the world.
"You have to have a gut. and a gut
can save your life." she said. "I'm not
sending kids over there. It's not going
to happen."

New York Times Foreign Editor Susan Chira tells students of physical and political challenges in covering the Iraq war.
In the rough streets of Baghdad, the
Paper of Record spends $3 million a
year to maintain a compound com
plete with blast walls, a reporting staff
of about 80 Iraqis and full-time armed
guards, nicknamed the "New York
Times Militia."
From a staff fatality to following the
trail of two kidnapped correspondents,
the foreign editor of The New York
Times, Susan Chira, offered a striking
glimpse into the sophisticated news
gathering operation that is the Bagh
dad bureau, in a Thursday night speech
to a well-attended Tressider Oak

Room.
Reporting on the deepening sectar
ian violence in Iraq is perhaps more
challenging than the Herculean task of
establishing lasting stability in the war
torn country. I"he New York limes
must cope with this sobering reality
and deal with extreme challenges —
both physical and political. The stakes
are high, she said, and the risk is real.
"All of it is really unprecedented in
our experience," said Chira. while de
scribing the ever-declining freedom of
reporters to travel in Iraq.
Where protecting personal safety
and breaking the big story can be mu
tually exclusive, she said tough judg
ment calls must be made.
Chira said she gets calls at 3 a.m.
from her reporters in combat zones
wanting to know whether they should
risk traveling down a volatile road or
venturing into a hostile neighborhood.
"Insurgents actually read The
Times." she said. "We know they

Google it. And we know they know by
lines."
The immersion into the lives of sub
jects covered in The Times' stories has
become harder than ever in Iraq. Chira
said, because it's often not safe to ven
ture out into the streets or visit people
in their homes.
"It's a much more prolonged
process,and it requires a lot of patience
and filtering," she said. She offered re
porter Sabrina Tavernise as an exam
ple. who spent months trying to get all
the pieces for a story about the system
atic assassination of Shia bakers.
One of the ways ITie Times gathers
information is through locals who can
file dispatches from turbulent areas
not safe for Westerners. But this prac
tice has drawn concerns about bias, ac
curacy and verifiability of information
learned from inexperienced Iraqis.
"Over the years, we have been able
to winnow the people who are un
trustworthy and have agendas." she
said. "Wherever possible, we don't
rely solely on the Irac|i stall."
But even in the relatively harmo
nious newsroom of the Baghdad bu
reau. there is occasional conflict be
tween Sunni, Shiite and Kurd stall
members, she said — a microcosm of
the intractable clash of cultures with
in the Iraq theater.
"There are tensions that arise
when people are coming from a dit
ferent place," she said, mentioning
that tempers flared during the trial of
former Iraqi leader Saddam Hus
sein.
Another information-gathering
mechanism that The Times uses is
embedding reporters with military
forces. Some media observers criti
cize this tactic, worrying that Ameri
can officials can control what re
porters see and provide a misleading
view of what's happening by reiterat
ing the party line.
"Sometimes you sit there for 10
days and you can't get a helicopter

out and you're stuck and you're
screwed." she said.
But embedded reporters often
get good information from candid
soldiers at all ranks, Chira said.
"We've found great insights front
living with units for a period of time,
she said.
Other times, governments ma\
flat-out lie.
"What is truth?" Chira asked.
"There's a realK elastic definition,
and we don't find that Iraqi officials
are always candid with us."
Without full access, it's hard to be
sure about some important details.
She cited the lack of accurate civilian
casualty numbers as a symptom of
the larger informational deficiency.
The Paper of Record also comes
under fire in a more figurative sense
the consequence of a politically
charged climate and the high stakes
of the war.
"There's enormous pressure from
the perspective of supporters of the
war." she said. "And there is perhaps
greater pressure from critics of the

war who want The New York Times
to declare it a failure."
Chira, who has been foreign edi

l imes' credibility, which came under
