## NYT editor addresses students Describes difficulties of reporting from the front, says Arabic speakers needed 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
In the rough streets of Baghdad, the
Paper of Record spends $3 million a
year to maintain a compound com
plete with blast walls, a reporting staff
of about 80 Iraqis and full-time armed
guards, nicknamed the "New York
Times Militia."
From a staff fatality to following the
trail of two kidnapped correspondents,
the foreign editor of The New York
Times, Susan Chira, offered a striking
glimpse into the sophisticated news
gathering operation that is the Bagh
dad bureau, in a Thursday night speech
to a well-attended Tressider Oak

Room.
Reporting on the deepening sectar
ian violence in Iraq is perhaps more
challenging than the Herculean task of
establishing lasting stability in the war
torn country. I"he New York limes
must cope with this sobering reality
and deal with extreme challenges â€”
both physical and political. The stakes
are high, she said, and the risk is real.
"All of it is really unprecedented in
our experience," said Chira. while de
scribing the ever-declining freedom of
reporters to travel in Iraq.
Where protecting personal safety
and breaking the big story can be mu
tually exclusive, she said tough judg
ment calls must be made.
Chira said she gets calls at 3 a.m.
from her reporters in combat zones
wanting to know whether they should
risk traveling down a volatile road or
venturing into a hostile neighborhood.
"Insurgents actually read The
Times." she said. "We know they

Google it. And we know they know by
lines."
The immersion into the lives of sub
jects covered in The Times' stories has
become harder than ever in Iraq. Chira
said, because it's often not safe to ven
ture out into the streets or visit people
in their homes.
"It's a much more prolonged
process,and it requires a lot of patience
and filtering," she said. She offered re
porter Sabrina Tavernise as an exam
ple. who spent months trying to get all
the pieces for a story about the system
atic assassination of Shia bakers.
One of the ways ITie Times gathers
information is through locals who can
file dispatches from turbulent areas
not safe for Westerners. But this prac
tice has drawn concerns about bias, ac
curacy and verifiability of information
learned from inexperienced Iraqis.
"Over the years, we have been able
