## Huge gift to fund energy research $30 million donation from oil tycoon will establish new institute for energy efficiency 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford grad and oil millionaire
Jay A Precourt donated $30 million to
the University to create the Precourt
Institute for Energy Efficiency yester
day.
"I understand the importance of
improving the efficiency of energy con
sumption not only here in California
and the U.S.. but worldwide." Precourt
told The Daily. "Working with the
tremendous resources at Stanford and
being a catalyst for work in this area is

a real win-win from my point of view."
He argued that increased energy ef
ficiency would solve a wide array of the
nation's current domestic and interna
tional concerns.
"11 we can deliver the same amount
of service with less energy, it helps the
environment, reduces carbon emis
sions. increases our national security
because we're not importing petrole
um and natural gas, and it makes us
economically more competitive world
wide," said Precourt, who earned a
bachelor's degree in 1959 and a mas
ter's degree in 1960.
The Institute's research will con
centrate on increasing energy efficien
cy in three areas: transportation fuels,
heating and cooling fuels and electrici
ty distribution. These three fields deal
with the use of all major energy
sources, including petroleum, natural

gas and coal, as well as other sources of
electricity such as hydroelectric and
nuclear power, he said.
The $30 million gift will fund re
search by current students and facul
ty in addition to establishing an en
dowment which can be used to fund
new positions, said James L. Sweeney,
the newly-minted director of the in
stitute.
Collaboration and cross-discipli
nary integration is the name of the
game at the Precourt Institute.
Sweeney told The Daily. He added that
he has been working closely with Prof.
Buzz Thompson and Prof. Jeffrey R.
kolseff. Co-directors of the Woods In
stitute for the Environment. The two
institutes will share the currently un
finished Environment and Energy
Building when it is completed next
year.
"We are very excited about the
Precourt Institute," Koseff said in a
statement yesterday.
Sweeney also predicted collabo
ration with the Stanford Institute
for Economic Policy Research,
where he is currently a senior fellow.
He expressed a desire to incorpo
rate fields that have been previously
uninvolved in energy efficiency re
search.
"I think that one of the things that
we have been light on at Stanford
are some of the more social science,
behavioral issues that are involved
in energy efficiency," Sweeney said.
He pointed to the need to discover
reasons behind the "less than opti

mal rate of adoption of compact flu
orescent lights" by consumers, even
when they are the most cost-efficient
bulb.
"I would like to have word going
around that we're not just tradition
al science-engineering-economics,"
he added.
Although most of the research
will be performed by graduate stu
dents and University faculty,
Sweeney s;ud that the Institute will
make an effort to provide opportu
nities for undergraduates.
For now. Sweeney said the fledg
ling program will focus on involving
students and faculty in research,
spreading the word of its existence
and working out a number of ad
ministrative issues ranging from
finding workspace to establishing
internal accounts to distribute the
gift.
"There's a lot to be done." Pre
court said. "And we're right at the
beginning of this."
