Stanford grad and oil millionaire
Jay A Precourt donated $30 million to
the University to create the Precourt
Institute for Energy Efficiency yester
day.
"I understand the importance of
improving the efficiency of energy con
sumption not only here in California
and the U.S.. but worldwide." Precourt
told The Daily. "Working with the
tremendous resources at Stanford and
being a catalyst for work in this area is

a real win-win from my point of view."
He argued that increased energy ef
ficiency would solve a wide array of the
nation's current domestic and interna
tional concerns.
"11 we can deliver the same amount
of service with less energy, it helps the
environment, reduces carbon emis
sions. increases our national security
because we're not importing petrole
um and natural gas, and it makes us
economically more competitive world
wide," said Precourt, who earned a
bachelor's degree in 1959 and a mas
ter's degree in 1960.
The Institute's research will con
centrate on increasing energy efficien
cy in three areas: transportation fuels,
heating and cooling fuels and electrici
ty distribution. These three fields deal
with the use of all major energy
sources, including petroleum, natural

gas and coal, as well as other sources of
electricity such as hydroelectric and
nuclear power, he said.
The $30 million gift will fund re
search by current students and facul
ty in addition to establishing an en
dowment which can be used to fund
new positions, said James L. Sweeney,
the newly-minted director of the in
stitute.
Collaboration and cross-discipli
nary integration is the name of the
game at the Precourt Institute.
Sweeney told The Daily. He added that
he has been working closely with Prof.
Buzz Thompson and Prof. Jeffrey R.
kolseff. Co-directors of the Woods In
stitute for the Environment. The two
institutes will share the currently un
finished Environment and Energy
