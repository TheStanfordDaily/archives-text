## Editorial No such thing as a free lunch 
### 
Stanford Medical Center recently an
nounced a new policy prohibiting doctors
from accepting free drug samples or even
small gifts from pharmaceutical sales repre
sentatives. On the heels of similar announce
ments from University of Pennsylvania and
Yale, we think that Stanford's action is in the
best interest of both doctors and patients.
Physicians are well-paid individuals.
Hence, it seems very improbable, if not en
tirely impossible, that they could be enticed
into making unethical decisions concerning
the health of patients. A lunch, a pen, a cof
fee mug or a sticky tape can rarely be expect
ed to influence a physician s decision about
which medical regimen to prescribe — at
least on a conscious level.
But it is the time, money and effort allo
cated to such activities by drug companies
that makes one sit up and take notice. The
drug industry directs 90 percent of their $21
billion marketing budget at physicians, in
cluding the sponsorship of an estimated
300,000 educational events. There are ap
proximately 100,000 sales representatives
pursuing about 120.000 pharmaceutical pre
scribes. According to a recent article pub
lished in the New York Times, the new poli
cy would cost Stanford Medical Center and
its employees millions of dollars per year in
free meals and similar industry gifts.
The bottom line is: why would drug com
panies spend billions of dollars on market
ing if it were not working? Even small gifts
create a sense of obligation which is subtle
but powerful. If a drug company is wining
and dining seminar participants, it is unlike
ly they will criticize that company's drug. Re
moving subconscious biases from the deci
sion-making process would help doctors ob
jectively make judgments about the appro
priateness of drugs.

While concerns have arisen over whether
the new policy will negatively affect the ease
of obtaining information about drugs, we
feel these considerations are not decisive.
1 laving to pay for lunch with an industry rep
resentative isn't a tremendous barrier to
learning about a new drug. Physicians can
still obtain information at conferences,
which pharmaceutical companies can still
arrange for as long as they don't influence
the speakers or content. The extent of anoth
er possible side affect, restriction on the abil
ity of Stanford professors to pursue entre
preneurial ventures, remains to be seen.
Although Stanford's policy change may
not affect the pharmaceutical industry dras
tically, it's only opportune to ponder about
the response of pharmaceutical companies if
the rejection of standard marketing prac
tices becomes the norm. The industry may
just find more subtle ways to get gifts out to
doctors. Or they may appreciate the cost
cutting allowed by the decreased marketing
expense and pass on some of the savings to
consumers. Alternately, drug companies
could increase research on drugs without
blockbuster potential, or which address fi
nancially underprivileged customers.
Though an unlikely possibility, such efforts
in generating goodwill could possibly consti
tute a more effective marketing effort than
the current strategy of buying lunches and
pens for doctors.
We believe that Stanford's policy of re
jecting even small gifts is fair, appropriate
and ethical. It demonstrates the leadership
role that academic institutions ought to take
in bringing transparency to the prescription
drug industry. Universities are the breeding
grounds of tomorrow's physicians, and Stan
ford has taken the right step to attempting to
ensure the hiehest ethical standards.
