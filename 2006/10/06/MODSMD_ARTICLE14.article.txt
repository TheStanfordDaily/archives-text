# The 						courses that count
## 
### 
So, it's two weeks down and one week
until midterms begin (gotta love the
quarter system — you fall asleep in the
Bender Room and all of a sudden your final
paper is due tomorrow at 9 a.m. ). By now.the
a capella-table gauntlet has left White Plaza,
the succulent dishes at Stern dining have
begun reinventing themselves in bi-weekly
fashion (turkey dinner becomes turkey
meatloaf becomes spaghetti with turkey
meatballs) and the course lists have, hope
fully. been whittled down to the few, the
proud, the conveniently-scheduled and the
light in reading.
However, despite the fact that the Axess
deadline stroke of midnight looms in the
very near future, 1 am willing to bet that
more than a few of you are still debating be
tween four or five different classes. For
them, as well as for my fellow neurotics who
have begun plotting our next quarter/next
year/next degree, I present the highly subjec
tive Pearls of Wisdom Course Guide, featur
ing courses you are guaranteed to en joy now
and remember for the rest of your life.
1. Athletics classes
From tennis to horsemanship to sailing,
the Athletic Department offers an obscene
number of courses for the Future Country
Clubbers of America. Before you write these
courses off as frivolous, self-serving endeav
ors, let me introduce you to a good friend of
mine. In his five years at Stanford, my friend
scheduled no less than one activity course per
quarter (and no. he didn't take that many ath
letics courses; in yet another brilliant move in
his "take advantage of all that Stanford has to
offer" master plan, he cotermed). By the time
he received his B.S. and M.S. in Electrical En
gineering, he could sail, golf, play polo and
tennis and barbecue a mean steak.
Although the latter skill was not honed
in Roble Gym, he claims that his culinary
habits owe primarily to the need to replen
ish his energy supply following his exten
sive workouts. The icing on the petit four:
he currently "works" for a tech company in
Palo Alto that allows/requires him to golf
with the president on Fridays, come in late
on Mondays and take time off to go to
Hawaii. Vegas and LA — in the same
month.
More important than the potential im
pact athletics classes may have on your fu
ture career, however, is their direct impact
on the here-and-now: in the overscheduled
world of Stanford ducklings, a morning yoga
class may be the only time you have to sit still
without being required to take notes.
2. Activity classes
Similar in many ways to the athletic class
es above, activities courses can be found prac
tically everywhere — from the art depart
ment to the Bridge to the language houses.
Many activities courses, like Social Dance, are
extremely popular. Some, such as Viticulture
(aka the wine tasting class offered at the
French House), even have titles that look re
spectable on a transcript. All of them offer a
break from the often intense world of Stan
ford academics.
One warning: some activities courses,
namely Photo 1. are just as much, if not
more, work than a "regular" class. It you're

expecting to get four units for simply show
ing up, take EDGE.
3. Real Work! Courses
Theoretically, a college education is sup
posed to prepare you for life outside the
ivory tower. Realistically, however, most of
the skills you acquire while reading hun
dreds of pages a week and reproducing cor
rect codes for computer programs are of lit
tle help when it comes to paying rent, buying
groceries, handling an insane boss and work
ing with less-than-savory colleagues.
From a fiscal standpoint. Econ I, Stats h()
and the Financial Literacy course are very
wise investments. Your checkbook and fu
ture spouse will thank you.
From a social and professional stand
point, the most valuable real-world tool you
can acquire at Stanford is proficiency in a
foreign language. I know, 1 know, even the
sun would rather be asleep at 9 a.m., but an
hour or two of shuteye is a small price to pay
for what you gain. Think of it as cultural cap
ital. if you will. Whether your plans include
corporate America, grad school or non-prof
it work, learning a second (or a third or
fourth) language will make you even more
of a priceless commodity.
4. The Real Real World Course
Cheaper than therapy, more personal
than psychology and more intensely reveal
ing than most, if not all. Stanford courses,
the fiction- and poetry-writing classes of
fered by the Creative Writing program are
flat-out amazing. Taught by the future best
selling authors of America (also known as
current Stegner Fellows), these courses are
lull of interesting people, great (and short)
contemporary reading and frequently
mind-blowing discussions. Forget IHIJM:
workshopping 15 peers' short stories (in
cluding your own raw self-creation) raises
more questions about the human experi
ence than any textbook or ancient work
ever could. II that's not the point of college,
I'm not sure what is.

If the above list is entirely too fuzzy for your
tastes, blame it on Margaret .lacks. Lisa is cur
rently a Master's student in English — be
cause the first four years weren 7 nearly
enough. Additions to the list? Email
