# The 						History of Co-eds at Stanford
## 
### 
We were founded in IK 1 )I as a co-ed
school for the explicit purpose of
encouraging premarital sexual rela
tions. That was Jane Stanford's idea, at least.
Just because her own son passed away from
venereal disease after an infamous gondola
ride in Florence, Italy, it didn't mean that she
wanted to deny the children of California.
She even established the Sexual I lealth Peer
Resource Center in 1 <S ( )2 to prevent venereal
disease and bastard children, like poor little
Leland himself. She handed out five con
doms per quarter, which, taking inflation into
account, would be the equivalent of 125 con
doms, three diaphragms and a vibrator today.
Wow! Those were the days.
The stern and not handsome first Stan
ford president and Scientologist David Starr
Jordan tried to house the girls out in FroSo-
Co and the boys in Mirrielees so that they'd
be too lazy to walk across campus to see each
other. Jane, herself a vision of loveliness,
would have none of it, and she moved the
girls to Roble and the boys to Encina Hall.
'Hiis was before David Starr Jordan mur
dered Jane Stanford by testing sleep depi iva
tion on her in the Wilbur basement.
Jane was no fool, and before she died, she
capped the admission of Stanford girls at 500
(known as the "Female 500") even as the rate
of males grew exponentially. That way. girls
had a better chance of finding a male life part
ner. Meanwhile, due to the lack of girls. Stan
ford fellows dressed as Village People discov
ered everything that young men could enjoy
they could hangout with all the boys.
None of the Stanford men had to fight in
World War I because they all had college de
ferments. Those who couldn't defer because
they hadn't registered for classes by the study

list deadline tied to Canada. After realizing
that Canada was also lighting in World War I.
they returned to campus, where they prompt
ly tarred and feathered then-registrar Roger
Printup.Sr., who then let them re-enroll.
I"he girls watched this with much amuse
ment. They continued reproducing with
Stanford men because other American men,
who had actually fought in the Great War,
were impotent, just like Jake Barnes in I lem
ingway'sTTie Sun Also Rises — a hook upon
which the very first I HI JM,"Sexual I ncoun
tors and Identities," a.k.a. "Lady Ashley. You
a 1 lo." was based in 192fr.
There was this movement between the
two wars about getting women the vote and
then the right to smoke in public. Because of
one woman named Rosie the Riveter, who
had t-shirts printed up with her picture on
them during World War 11, feminism became
a reality. By the 19605, Jane Stanford was
pretty much dead, so at the age of 112 David
Stan Jordan admitted as many girls .is ap
plied to come here, creating a gender bal
ance. You know what that means.
That's right: co-ed showers.
Helen and Chandler Bing of the Bing
Wing and the Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram met in such a co-ed shower. Because of
their generosity and propagation, we now

have Bing Nursery.so that Stanford psychol
ogy majors can perform tests on small chil
dren without being sued. Most students in
the I l >7()s. however, became sociology majors
— they were still hung over from the 1%()s.
In fact, John C. Arrillaga was the only mem
ber of the graduating class of 1078 to major in
economics with a focus in Absurd Amounts
of Money, which worked out well for him and
us.Ted Danson also graduated in that class.
During the Reagan years, when ketchup
became a vegetable, students started eating
so much of the condiment that they got sodi
um poisoning. This was when Kicker dining
banned ail tomato products, including pizza
and Bloody Marrys. To this day, Ricker is a
tomato-free dining hall. We owe so much to
Ronald Reagan, including feminist backlash.
So skip ahead, like, seventeen years, and
there you have us at the present day. in 2006.

ly prescribed medication being birth control.
II it weren't for Jane Stanford and her dislike
of having sex with her rotund, robber baron,
United States senator husband, we wouldn't

would have had more children, gotten over
their grief for Leland, Jr. more easily and
built a race track instead.

nineteenth-century Italian prostitute,
"Thank goodness for birth control." Birth
control was created by a Stanford professor
named Robert Sapolsky in 1937, when he
was nine years old. I his is why his class on
human behavioral biology is so popular.

Jane was no fool, and before she died, she
capped the admission of Stanford girls at 500
(known as the "Female 500") even as the rate
of males grew exponentially. That way. girls
had a better chance of finding a male life part

they could hangout with all the boys.
None of the Stanford men had to fight in
World War I because they all had college de
ferments. Those who couldn't defer because
they hadn't registered for classes by the study

list deadline tied to Canada. After realizing
that Canada was also lighting in World War I.

I"he girls watched this with much amuse
ment. They continued reproducing with
Stanford men because other American men,
who had actually fought in the Great War,
were impotent, just like Jake Barnes in I lem
ingway'sTTie Sun Also Rises — a hook upon
which the very first I HI JM,"Sexual I ncoun

There was this movement between the
two wars about getting women the vote and
then the right to smoke in public. Because of
one woman named Rosie the Riveter, who
had t-shirts printed up with her picture on

a reality. By the 19605, Jane Stanford was
pretty much dead, so at the age of 112 David
Stan Jordan admitted as many girls .is ap

That's right: co-ed showers.
Helen and Chandler Bing of the Bing

In fact, John C. Arrillaga was the only mem

nineteenth-century Italian prostitute,
"Thank goodness for birth control." Birth
