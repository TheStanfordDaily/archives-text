Hie University of Florida solved this
problem by building a dining hall with an
all-you-can-cat meal price plan available to
all students/visitors etc. The athletes pick
their food from the same choices(many,
many different types) and check out at the
same cash registers. They do have a sepa
rate room (semi-private) so that they and
the coaches can cat "in peace."

You have got to be kidding me! I was a
former student-athlete at Stanford. For
these non-athletic undergrads to be moan
ing and groaning about "favoritism" is
RIDICULOUS!!! Seriously absurd. I have
many friends from around the country who

have played sports at their respective insti
tutions. and they have told me of the things
they receive. Stanford, BY FAR. does not
play favorites with their student-athletes.
Heck, if anything, we do (did not) receive
enough attention from the University.
These regular students should try, just for a
day or a week, to live in a student-athlete's
shoes!!! That will make them reconsider
their off-base remarks regarding training
table or "perks" we may receive!!! Beat Cal.

I think they should do away with the
athletics program completely. We are here
to learn, not bash our heads together on a
field like idiots.

a chance of pulling out a single win this

To the other Mike: I'm not sure if you're
simply indignant about "normal students"
not appreciating the student athlete's diffi
cult life, or if you feel the University owes
athletes more than it already provides. If
it's the latter. I have to ask: to what addi
tional perks should the athletes be enti
tled? A free education at one of the best

schools in the world leaves you feeling un
derappreciated? Remember: athletes
aren't the only people at Stanford who arc
committed beyond their means. I love
Stanford athletics and I don't have a prob
lem with the so-called "perk" addressed in
this article, but it always rubs me the wrong
way when athletes insinuate that other stu
dents can't relate to their tough schedules,
or that the cost of their services isn't fully
covered by free education.

Mike - you assume that all athletes at
Stanford are here on a full ride or even any
ride This is simply not true.The majority of
us are not receiving monetary compensa
tion for our performance on the
field/track/court. Yes, football, basketball
and baseball are more generous with their
money because they have greater amounts
of it - but for the rest ol us out services arc
voluntary, hence why most ot us don 't com •
plain about it. Just don't forget: we are here
to give our service to the University asking
only that they help us do so. not pave the
way to a free education.
