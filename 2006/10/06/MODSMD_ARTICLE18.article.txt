talking about judges for the awards,

industry to academia. We chose
President Hennessy because he is
someone from academia who. be
cause of his background in comput
er science and because of his enthu
siasm as a member of the Google
board of directors, would be an
ideal choice to judge

puter Science department and co
founder of MIPS Technologies.

to the field, but also because of
Stanford's reputation.

Stanford to judge the most intelli
gent gadget category because of the
university's strong background in
artificial intelligence." Ewing said.

selected by an algorithm and then
passed on without any identifying
markers to the judges, who will select
the best in categories such as Most
