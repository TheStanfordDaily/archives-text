# FIGHTING THEIRISH
## Card gunning for first win over Notre Dame since 2001 "We're not playing the Four Horsemen and we're not playing Joe Montana." Josiah Vinon, senior offensive guard 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
The preseason hype sur
rounding Notre Dame
this year was beyond

anything in recent memory. De
spite losing their eighth consec-

utive bowl game in 2005, the
Irish were ranked No. 2 in the

preseason Associated Press Poll
ii- i
and many pundits saw them as

national championship con
tenders. J

The general consensus was

that a stacked offense, including
Heisman-favorite quarterback!
Brady Quinn,6-foot-7 receiver 1
Jeff Samardzija and star tailbacl
Darius Walker, would lead
Notre Dame to their first con
sensus title since 1988.

GAITAN/Tt»e Stanford Daily
SerW quarterback Trent Edwards an hopes improve on
the offensive performance the Cardinal
put upw UCLA last week in a 31 -0 loss.

But once the season actually got under
way, it was clear that the road to the BCS
Championship Game was noi going to lie
easy.
ITie Irish escaped an upset against Geor
gia Tech in their opener, sneaking past the
Yellow Jackets 14-10.T wo weeks later, Notre
Dame was handed their first loss, an embar
rassing 47-21 defeat to then-No. 11 Michigan.
It took a 16-point fourth-quarter comeback
the next weekend to stun Michigan State and
avoid a devastating second loss.
The Cardinal (0-5) hope to keep the Irish
on the ropes, as they head to South Bend. lnd.
for a non-conference matchup with Notre
Dame (4-1).
Surprisingly.it has been the Irish's offense,
not the defense, which h;is stumbled out of
the gate. Notre Dame's offense is ranked a
middling 45th in the nation in total offense
(369.2) and 100 th in rushing offense (87.4
\ards per game).
Quinn. considered a possible first pick in
the 2007 Ni l. Draft, has done his part to lead
the offense, throwing for 280.4 yards per
game and 13 touchdowns, but he had three
costly interceptions in the loss to Michigan.
While he has lost his front-runner status in
the 1 leisman race, Quinn is still in the top ten
in the nation in passing yards per game, total
passing yards and passing touchdowns.
As much success as Quinn has enjoyed,
the same has not held true for the Irish's
other offensive leaders, Samardzija and
Walker. After catching for 1,249 yards and
15 touchdowns in 2005, Samardzija has just
319 \ards and four touchdowns so far this
season. Instead. Quinn's top target has been
senior Rhema McKnight, who leads the
Irish with 433 receiving vards and six scores.

After a stellar 2005 season in which he av
eraged nearly 100 yards per game on the
ground. Walker has also experienced his
share of difficulties in 2(K)<>. Through five
games he has run for 373 yards and two
touchdowns. By comparison, he ran for 186
yards and one touchdown in Notre Dame's
2(X)5 38-31 win over Stanford.
Ihat game, the final played at the old
Stanford Stadium, was another heartbreaker
for the Cardinal. Stanford took a 31-30 lead
vvith 1:46 to go, hut with the bulldozers ready
on the sidelines to send the Stadium out on a
positive note, the Irish drove 80 yards in 51
seconds to score the winning touchdown.
Ihe loss, which kept the Cardinal out of
the postseason for the fourth straight season,
was painful at the time. 1 lowever, it does give
Stanford a confidence boost entering this
year's trip to South Bend. Ind.
"Ihat shows us that we can play with those
gu\s," offensive guard Josiah Vinson said.
"[Offensive line coach Tom] 112 reeman told us
we're not playing the Four Horsemen, and
we're not playing Joe Montana. We're play
ing this team who we have played with before
and were ahead with a minute and a half togo
last year."
Hie Cardinal will have to dig deep to find
that confidence after being shut out in a 31-0

loss to UCLA last week. Injuries continued
to plague the squad as Trent Edwards strug
gled without his top receivers and running
back Anthony Kimble, throwing 117 yards
and no touchdowns. I le also turned the ball
over five times.
"It can be tough anytime a quarterback is
facing those kind of injuries. It makes you feel
like you need to make plays on your own or
do something extraordinary,just to get things
back in the light path," said Quinn of Ed
wards' situation." Ilie biggest answer is you
just have to try to play within yourself. Do
your job. still go through the same progres
sions and reads and do the best you can in
your specific spot. You can't control other
things that happen in a game like that."
The Cardinal will be without receiver
Evan Moore for the third consecutive week,
after he was pulled during the Navy game
with a stress fracture in his foot. Kimble is ex
pected to make his return after missing one
week with symptoms stemming from a con
cussion he suffered against Washington State.
Stanford is trying to beat Notre Dame for
the first time since a 17-13 win at Stanford
Stadium back in 2(K)I. ITie Cardinal have not
won at Notre Dame Stadium since 1992.
Kickoff is slated for 11:30 a.m PT. The
game will be televised nationally on NBC.

passing yards and passing touchdowns.
As much success as Quinn has enjoyed,
the same has not held true for the Irish's
other offensive leaders, Samardzija and
Walker. After catching for 1,249 yards and
15 touchdowns in 2005, Samardzija has just
319 \ards and four touchdowns so far this
season. Instead. Quinn's top target has been
senior Rhema McKnight, who leads the
Irish with 433 receiving vards and six scores.

After a stellar 2005 season in which he av
eraged nearly 100 yards per game on the
ground. Walker has also experienced his
share of difficulties in 2(K)<>. Through five
games he has run for 373 yards and two
touchdowns. By comparison, he ran for 186
yards and one touchdown in Notre Dame's
2(X)5 38-31 win over Stanford.
Ihat game, the final played at the old
Stanford Stadium, was another heartbreaker
for the Cardinal. Stanford took a 31-30 lead
vvith 1:46 to go, hut with the bulldozers ready
on the sidelines to send the Stadium out on a
positive note, the Irish drove 80 yards in 51
seconds to score the winning touchdown.
Ihe loss, which kept the Cardinal out of
the postseason for the fourth straight season,
was painful at the time. 1 lowever, it does give
Stanford a confidence boost entering this
year's trip to South Bend. Ind.
"Ihat shows us that we can play with those
gu\s," offensive guard Josiah Vinson said.
"[Offensive line coach Tom] 112 reeman told us
we're not playing the Four Horsemen, and
we're not playing Joe Montana. We're play
ing this team who we have played with before
and were ahead with a minute and a half togo
last year."
Hie Cardinal will have to dig deep to find
that confidence after being shut out in a 31-0

loss to UCLA last week. Injuries continued
to plague the squad as Trent Edwards strug
gled without his top receivers and running
back Anthony Kimble, throwing 117 yards
and no touchdowns. I le also turned the ball
over five times.
"It can be tough anytime a quarterback is
facing those kind of injuries. It makes you feel
like you need to make plays on your own or
do something extraordinary,just to get things
back in the light path," said Quinn of Ed
wards' situation." Ilie biggest answer is you
just have to try to play within yourself. Do
your job. still go through the same progres
sions and reads and do the best you can in
your specific spot. You can't control other
things that happen in a game like that."
The Cardinal will be without receiver
Evan Moore for the third consecutive week,
after he was pulled during the Navy game
with a stress fracture in his foot. Kimble is ex
pected to make his return after missing one
week with symptoms stemming from a con
cussion he suffered against Washington State.
Stanford is trying to beat Notre Dame for
the first time since a 17-13 win at Stanford
Stadium back in 2(K)I. ITie Cardinal have not
won at Notre Dame Stadium since 1992.

Junior center Alex Fletcher picks up a block in front of quarterback Trent Edwards. The offensive line play has slumped since a decent start.
The Cardinal enter tomorrow's game at Notre Dame 115 th of 119 Division l-A teams in sacks allowed per game.
The preseason hype sur
rounding Notre Dame
this year was beyond

anything in recent memory. De
spite losing their eighth consec-

utive bowl game in 2005, the
Irish were ranked No. 2 in the

preseason Associated Press Poll
ii- i
and many pundits saw them as

national championship con
tenders. J

The general consensus was

that a stacked offense, including
Heisman-favorite quarterback!
Brady Quinn,6-foot-7 receiver 1
Jeff Samardzija and star tailbacl
Darius Walker, would lead
Notre Dame to their first con
sensus title since 1988.

GAITAN/Tt»e Stanford Daily
SerW quarterback Trent Edwards an hopes improve on
the offensive performance the Cardinal
put upw UCLA last week in a 31 -0 loss.

But once the season actually got under
way, it was clear that the road to the BCS
Championship Game was noi going to lie
easy.
ITie Irish escaped an upset against Geor
gia Tech in their opener, sneaking past the
Yellow Jackets 14-10.T wo weeks later, Notre
Dame was handed their first loss, an embar
rassing 47-21 defeat to then-No. 11 Michigan.
It took a 16-point fourth-quarter comeback
the next weekend to stun Michigan State and
avoid a devastating second loss.
The Cardinal (0-5) hope to keep the Irish
on the ropes, as they head to South Bend. lnd.
for a non-conference matchup with Notre
Dame (4-1).
Surprisingly.it has been the Irish's offense,
not the defense, which h;is stumbled out of
the gate. Notre Dame's offense is ranked a
middling 45th in the nation in total offense
(369.2) and 100 th in rushing offense (87.4
\ards per game).
Quinn. considered a possible first pick in
the 2007 Ni l. Draft, has done his part to lead
the offense, throwing for 280.4 yards per
game and 13 touchdowns, but he had three
costly interceptions in the loss to Michigan.
While he has lost his front-runner status in
the 1 leisman race, Quinn is still in the top ten
in the nation in passing yards per game, total
passing yards and passing touchdowns.
As much success as Quinn has enjoyed,
the same has not held true for the Irish's
other offensive leaders, Samardzija and
Walker. After catching for 1,249 yards and
15 touchdowns in 2005, Samardzija has just
319 \ards and four touchdowns so far this
season. Instead. Quinn's top target has been
senior Rhema McKnight, who leads the
Irish with 433 receiving vards and six scores.
