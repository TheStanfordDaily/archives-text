The preseason hype sur
rounding Notre Dame
this year was beyond

anything in recent memory. De
spite losing their eighth consec-

utive bowl game in 2005, the
Irish were ranked No. 2 in the

preseason Associated Press Poll
ii- i
and many pundits saw them as

national championship con
tenders. J

The general consensus was

that a stacked offense, including
Heisman-favorite quarterback!
Brady Quinn,6-foot-7 receiver 1
Jeff Samardzija and star tailbacl
Darius Walker, would lead
Notre Dame to their first con
sensus title since 1988.

SerW quarterback Trent Edwards an hopes improve on
the offensive performance the Cardinal
put upw UCLA last week in a 31 -0 loss.
