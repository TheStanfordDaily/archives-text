# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## No. 6 Card welcome Bears for Big Spike "What we saw last week is that every Pac-10 team is good." John Dunning, Stanford coach 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
Coming off of a huge pair of victories over the Arizona
schools last weekend, the No. 6 Stanford women's volleyball
team looks to maintain that momentum as it hosts No. 7 Cal
ifornia tonight.
Outside hitter Cynthia Barboza may be going into
tonight's contest with a chip on her shoulder. The sopho
more tore her AO. on an improper landing the last time she
started against the Bears (14-1.31 Pac-10), putting an end
to her freshman campaign halfway through the season â€” at
a time in which she led the Pac-10 in kills.
"You can't completely get the past out of your head, but
I'm sure she'll get past it pretty quickly," coach John Dun
ning said. "She's had a lot of motivation for the whole sea
son and every single match. Oil is just such a great team that
we need to play her well."
Despite losing Barboza in the third game, the Cardinal
(12-2, 3-1 Pac-10) went on to win the match at California,
barely squeaking by the Bears 32-30 in the fourth game.
Stanford would take the teams' second meeting. 24-30, 30-
26,27-30,30-24,15-10, later in the season.
"What we saw last week [against the Arizona schools] is
that every Pac-10 team is good," Dunning said. "Our team
feels good after having improved on things we needed to
improve. I.ast week we identified some more things we
needed to work on for Oil, which we did."
Sophomore Foluke Akinradewo leads the team with a
.440 hitting percentage. Barboza owns the most kills on the
squad (198), to go along with a .314 average. Hie Cardinal is
averaging 3.4 blocks and 16.1 digs per game.
The Bears also swept the Arizona schools last weekend.
Freshman outside hitter ( at Dailey notched a team-high 19
kills against Arizona State on Friday, to go along with 17
kills off the hot hands of junior outside hitter Angie Pressey.
California dropped the second game 20-30 before collecting
30-19 and 30-26 wins en route to the 3-1 match victory.
One night later, ( alifornia took care of Arizona in four
games (28-30,30-26.30-18,31-29) to establish a new school
record of 13 consecutive home wins. Pressey paced the
Bears' effort with IS kills and 15 digs. Dailey and sopho
more outside hitter Morgan Beck contributed another 15
kills each.
