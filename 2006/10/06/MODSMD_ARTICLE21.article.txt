### ANDREW SHEN STAFF WRITER 
Attempting to snap a four-game losing
streak, the No. to Stanford men's water polo
team will travel to Spieker Aquatics Complex
to take on the No. 2 al Bears. Since starting
out with a perfect 5-0 record, the Cardinal
have struggled, dropping two matches to
1J CI A. as well as one each to Pacific and Cal.
After failing to get even with UCLA last
week, losing 10-8. Stanford has another
chance to strike hack at a conference rival.
Hie game lias immense implications for the
Cardinal's season, and the team knows it.
" lliis game is really important," junior
Peter I mlayson said. "Obviously any time
you play ( al the game has a little extra impor
tance tied to it, but in this case, it would be re
ally nice to get some good momentum head
ing into the SoCal tournament next week. It's
always special to go into someone else's pool
in front of their fans and take it to them —
that's what we have to do."
While the team's confidence will help, it
also lias to realize what it is up against. Cal's
John Mann is a strong candidate for the Peter
.). Cutino award, which honors the nation's
top collegiate player. I le leads the team with
an impressive W goals. Meanwhile, Cal's
fourth-best coal scorer has 23 on the season,

besting Stanford's number one option, soph
omore Will 1 lindle-Katel, who has only 19.
Moreover. Cal does not rely solely on
Mann, and sports a balanced scoring attack,
lileven Bears have scored more than lOgoals
this season, compared to only four of the Car
dinal. Iliis is despite the fact that Stanford's
season long mantra has been balance on of
fense.
"Cal is a very talented team with some of
the best players in the country,so we'll have to
really go after it. follow the game plan, and
play as a team." Finlayson said.'When we do
that, we are one of the best teams in the coun
try. We had a really good practice today and
we are confident that we'll give them a game
this weekend — we are excited and ready to
go."
In the teams' last meeting at the NorCal
tournament, Stanford suffered what was
probably the team's most painful loss of the
relatively young season, llie Cardinal were
leading 9-7 with just 4:l h left in the game, but
relinquished the lead in the closing minutes,
and lost 10-9. Had the Cardinal won. they
would have placed at least second in the Nor-
Cal tournament. Instead, the team finished
fourth, to mark the beginning of their current
losing streak.
Mann netted five goals in the last contest,
and was matched by I lindle-Katel with five of
his own. Yet Stanford is determined not to let
last game's disappointment wreck their confi-

dence.
"We need to step it up a notch
and take pride in doing the little
things that aren't really noticed by
the average spectator but win
games." Finlayson said. "I still think
we can have an amazing season. A
lot of other teams are looking past
us right now because we have a lot ot
young guys and we lost a few close
games."
The Cardinal have yet to defeat
any of the three elite Pac-10 teams
— UCLA, USC and Cal. The team
has also dropped out of the top four
— a position from which the squad
had rarely slipped in recent years.
Yet all of the games have been ex
tremely close, coming down to exe

young and brimming with confi

"Now we have a chance to make
a statement, and we are going to go
for it." Finlayson said. "We have our
work cut out for us again this week
end, but if we play smart water polo
and really go for it. we can knock
those guys off. We are a dangerous
team."
