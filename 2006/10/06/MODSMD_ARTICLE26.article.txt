### BETSY CONGDON BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION IRON CHEFS 
Good food and good company. That's the idea
for this week's Intermission. The company part is fit
ting. Here in the office, as we discussed in our edi
tor's note last week, we always are fortunate enough
to find ourselves in good company. But good food?
Appetizing cuisine is somewhat of a novelty when it
comes to The Daily's dining options.
Hence why we embarked on this week's theme.
Julia Child Presents: Intermission. We figured we
wouldn't know anything about good food based on

our experiences here, so why not let Ms.Child
(and by her, we mean our Intermission writers)
tell us a thing or two about it. We're offering you
age-old recipes, carefully passed down from gen-

eration to generation, now yours for the taking (err,
cooking). And unlike your mom's recipe book,
you'll be able to Google these tasty treats 30 years
down the road when you've forgotten whether it was
supposed to be two eggs or three.
So please, enjoy. If you're a resident of Mirrielees
or the like, you're off to a good start. You've already
got a kitchen. Now all you need to do is just abstain
from going to your Toyon Eating Club for a day to
whip up a new creation right there in your own dorm
room. And for those of you that don't have your own
kitchens? Two words. Foreman grill. Well, that or
the kitchen common area in your dorm. Really, it's
there, it exists and it isn't just for baking cakes for
your friends on their birthdays. Make some worth
while use of it already!
Also, before we sign off, we just wanted to thank

everyone for coming out to the Intermission garage
sale at last Friday's Activity Fair in White Plaza.
While we didn't make quite as much as we did the
year before (this year's haul was a measly $4.75 - and
75 cents of that was in anonymous IOUs), we feel
the point was achieved. Intermission delivered on its
promise of bringing the goods (random PR materi
als) to the people.

And really, it's not our

fault that the goods

kind of sucked.


P.S. Blame
Cosmin for the
