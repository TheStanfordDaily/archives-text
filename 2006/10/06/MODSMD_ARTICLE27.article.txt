# Wanta Janta? Don't cha?

### LAUREN OTERO INTERMISSION DECIDER 
i .ii,v;ery now and then, like
pregnant women, most of us
have a craving for a particular
type of food. Uulile pregnant
women, our craving is not hor
monal and usually excludes com
binations such as pickles and ice
cream. On this particular night. 1
was yearning for one cuisine
above all: Indian.
On the prowl for some tan
dyyri and a kick of flavorful
spices, I chose to take the path
less traveled. Instead.of sticking
to the normal University Avenue
jaunt lor a weekend meal, I made
- ' ~

my way to Lytton. a street a bit
over from the hustle and bustle.
Nestled in a corner and par
tially obscured by shrubbery sits
Janta, a small and very modest
restaurant. The decorations are
minimal and simplistic, and the
'"""•Qflff r'' J "r" nl is not much
more thjmffhome converted into
au eatery. Yet n is the simplicity
of the decor and the inviting
warmth of the home-style setting
that made me (eel as if 1 were eat
ing an authentic meal. The fact
that 1 could not pronounce the
names of the dishes on the menu
might have created an elevated
sense of authenticity. Either way,
I was already convinced that 1
au. ».<% «*

was in lor a treat.
I sat al dinner with my older
brother awaiting a sizzling plat
ter of tandoori, two orders of
Naan (a type of flat bread made
with wheat flour) and a spinach
and potato side dish (entitled
Saag A 1 oo) , 1 112, my
brother is less irfelimed to devi
ate from the usunl%nlled
cn Foreman-style. However,
the spice of the curried Saag
Aloo combined with the succu
lent tandoori chicken and the
doughy naan impaired my
brother's customary demand
for bland. Meanwhile, I savored
the flavor of the tandoori chick
en cutlets with their subtle taste

cnluinccd by morsels of onion.
Janla's cffcct is two Md; i or
the adventurous or pregfnlint. it
fulfills a craving. For the i'"> s
open-minded eater, much like
my brother, the taste buds might
come alive for a brief moment -
so don't foe startled. My brother
and I agree to disagree about
most things. But in the.cuic ol
Janta and the home-style cuisine,
there will be naan of that.
Janta is located at 369 Lytton Aft
cnue and is open seven
week. Make a reservation trt
vance to experience this co/y. •
crowded find. j
