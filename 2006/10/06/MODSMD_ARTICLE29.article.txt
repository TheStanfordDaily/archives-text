# DOWNLOAD FESTIVAL
## 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION ILLEGAL DOWSLOADER 
Last Saturday, some of the hottest acts in rock
took the stage beneath the twin erect nipples of
the Shoreline Amphitheatre. The Download
Festival, a yearly staple in the UK, made good on
its return to the States for the second year in a
row. Despite all the anticipation, the day started
out badly. Australian trio Wolfmother cancelled.
Our press passes weren't at will call. By the time
we got everything straightened out ("You have a
rider pass?" "No, a writer pass"), I was already on
edge due to some terrible Jams Joplin karaoke.
Then, the photographer got a pit pass while I was
stuck with a lawn ticket. Damn!
Nevertheless, we arrived just in time to catch
current band du jour: TV on the Radio. Unfortu
nately. ihe lawn is so far away from the stage that
giant monitors were the only way to see the band:

literally TV on the Radio on TV. Equipped with an awesome guitarist who resembles a black
Jerry Garcia, and another who insisted on hanging a wind chime from the frets of his Les Paul,
TVOR captivated the audience with their trademark soulful wailing and groovy eleclronoise.
It was during such a song that some dude stepped on my hand, but by way of apology gave me
a massage. Awkward ... Anyway, the band seems worthy of all the hype, lliev re sort of like
Gnarls Barkley, on ludes. but in a good way.
As we filed out after TVOR, a 35-year-old random said something along the lines of, "Boy.
am I going to practice my pick-pocketing skills tonight." People within earshot immediately
transferred their wallets to the front pocket. Interestingly enough, this balding skin head was
not the only entity intent on financially preying on the assembled. Corporate flagships were
out in full regalia. San Disk set up a huge autograph stand. Wells Fargo and their "The Fun of
Money Tour" set up plastic wind booths where you could catch fake paper money as it hurri-

caned around you. Napster was
giving away free stuff. Verizon,
accompanied by a fleet of tricked
out hummers, was there promot
ing a new cell phone version ol
Splinter Cell 2. VW sponsored a
side stage featuring a group
called Mutaytor. The 10-piece
band featured 5 percussionists,
Chinese dragons, belly dancers,
bondage, and hoolahoops. In
front of a "VWs Rock' sign

drummers
roved the stage
banging on
anything in
sight - railings,
lights. etc.
During ballads
the crowd held
up Volkswa
gen penlights
instead of
lighters. And

of course, Myspace.com was on hand to digitally document the event.
Every sign, ticket and booth loudly and edgily portrayed a company as
cool. Yahoo, perhaps bitter that they were not one of the festival's numer
ous sponsors, featured the show not in their entertainment pages, but in the
finance section. Go figure. At times it was hard to convince myself that the
bands were not just an excuse to get so many young people together in one
place in order to sell them things.
One of the more interesting aspects of a Festival concert is the existence
of more than one stage. In this case. Download 2006 offered two stages: the
main pavilion and the second, less prestigious but more hardcore, stage in
the parking lot. In order to catch all their favorite acts, concertgoers would
frequently stampede from one bandstand to the other. The Like - a firey all-

female band out of LA - complete with t
shirts with the apparent "1 Like the Like"
caption on the back, finished their set and
500 people immediately sprinted away
clapping toward the jubilant opening
chords of The Shins' "Kissing the Lipless."
The Shins, the band 1 primarily came
to see, were something of a disappoint
ment. Their ethereal, melodic sound trans
lated badly into the cavernous outdoor
amphitheatre, a fact that haunted a few of

the other bands as
well. The group
came out all dressed
in black and their set
came off as a sort of
hall-hearted snooze
fest. By way of con
ciliation, though,
they did announce
the completion of
their third album,
which is exciting.
The crowd was a
fairly uniform 17-25
set, all decked out in
their finest hipster at
tire. The Shoreline
was full of cool kids,
complete with Mv-
Space.com shoelaces.
Everyone was mug
gin' and smokin'. 'cuz
that's the cool thing
to do. Two twentvish
girls started dancing
down in reserved

seating. One tapped
>he other as if to say," Hey. dance like me," and they broke into a faux-Pulp

Fiction twist. Later the girl tapped her wildly dancing tnend - hut this time
tiic friend would have none of it. She continued to jump around flailing her amis to the thump
ing bass beat.
Back in the parking lot, Cohced and Cambria played to a huge crowd of D&D looking art
metal nuvs. The guitarist had huge hair -1 mean like Erika Badu hair, like boom, the set was
brought to a screeching conclusion by a Jimmy Page-esque violin bow guitar solo, which is sort
of sacred territory in terms of rock history, although 1 highly doubt anyone minded.
Then, as the sun set behind the upper lawn. Muse took the stage with a sound so hi-fi that
there was actually a video screen on every guitar. The trio blended funky emo. faux-indie.
and drum-n-base background for an exciting, up-tempo sound, even breaking for the oc-

al awesome piano solo. It was a tight set. with great use of light effects under the huge Shore
line canopy. Despite the annoying emo trappings, occasional whining and trite lyrics, they were
the peak of the festival. Later on, I passed a 40-year-old man wearing a lreshly bought Muse
Shirt - he must have been impressed, too.
In between songs, a chorus of cell phones were held aloft to take grainy pictures of the ac
tion occurring more than 200 yards away. The guy in front of me diligently recorded every song
in the set with his digital camera, sometimes zooming in for close-ups of the ant-like figures on
stage. Through the grainy screen, the musicians onstage looked mythic and surreal, like a pop
culture Bigfoot sighting. Even during an electric Muse set, much of the crowd was left expres
sionlessly bobbing their heads, faces illuminated by various recording devices.
Annoyingly. bands frequently addressed the crowd as San Francisco. As in. "We love you. San

Francisco!" Nothing wrong with love, but for the record. Mountain View is 40 miles outside
San Francisco, and undoubtedly closer to San Jose (about 15 miles). It's even closer to Stan
lord. so where's our shout out?
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs were next on the bill. But with the audience wrung to a clammy stu
por. Muse would prove a tough act to follow. Outre front woman Karen O. was absolutely and
expectedlv ridiculous. Clad in a green and yellow sequined leotard and a dinosaur hat, the le
male Steven Tyler with David Bowie sensibilities contorted her way around the stage in a flur
ry of scarves and eye glitter. Unfortunately, the deliciously bizzaro act got lost in the huge

rena. Despite compelling stripper drum beats, the New York club sound was a major miss.

Glam-garage is probably officially lame now. During the set. someone (doubtlessly chan-

neling Michael Scott) finally yelled out the most overused joke in rock history: "Play

Freebird!" Considering the circumstances, it was almost funny.




Beck topped off the show with a funktastic set that people have come to
expect from rock and roll's snarkiest son. It was all about the puppets. Before
the group entered the stage, two-foot tall effigies of the band members played
the first verse of "Loser." It was a good performance, and despite the nine
hour concert length and the freezing night there were people dancing every
where, Newsies style. Then, during the encore, two guys came out and wres
tled in bear suits ... what more could you want from a rock show?
How about a foot-tall effigy of a cell phone game character? Hell Y.e.s. In
the VZW Lounge up at the top of the lawn, Verizon was giving away crates of
huge figurines. Thousands of these five-pound monstrosities were handed out
indiscriminately. The extremely detailed, completely free, five-pound piece of
plastic now mugs silently between Tolstoy and The Sandlot on my bookshelf.
Word.
It's hard to render a final verdict on the 2006 Download Festival. On the
one hand, it was a good line up, there were some exceptional sets, and it was a
beautiful day. On the other, some great bands gave forgettable performances,
there was an annoyingly pervasive corporate vibe, and the lawn was really far
from the stage.
In (he end, it comes down to that huge figurine. Download Festival, you're all
right in my book.
