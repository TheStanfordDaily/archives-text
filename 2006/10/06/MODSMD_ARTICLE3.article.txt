# Inside The Game: Pitch And Catch
## 
### 
With the players to
execute it, Notre
Dame coach Charlie Weis'
highly effective offense
can attack all over the
field. Lined up in a pro set
on 3rd and 9, quarterback
Brady Quinn (10) gets
great protection from the
line and has over three
seconds to throw the ball
— enough time to find Ail-
American receiver Jeff
Samardzija (83) on a
crossing pattern.
Samardzija, who outran
the entire Stanford de
fense for a touchdown last
season, catches the ball
just three yards downfield
but stops on a dime and
uses his great speed to
gain nine more yards be
fore being tracked down at
the 33. Short passes like
this keyed Notre Dame's
35-21 win over Purdue.
