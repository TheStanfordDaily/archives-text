## Sometimes asking is the hardest part 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
All over campus, everyone is talking about
one thing: Freshmen. For the upperclassmen,
it can get a little tiring but you must bear with
Roxy one more time. There are a few awk
ward moments that you will all experience
your freshman year. Roxy wants to give you a
peak.
The first time you ask your PHE for a condom:
This conversation can go a variety of ways.
Just ask! Roxy has had to suck it up and ask
her beau's PHE. PHEs are trained for this
sort of thing. She is not your mother and she
won't look at you differently when you walk
down the hall tomorrow morning (well, she
might look at you with envy but at least she
won't judge you). Oh yeah, and guys, don't al
ways make the girls ask. If you want to have
sex then at least get the balls to ask for the
condom.
To avoid this conversation the next week,
go to Vaden. The Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center, SHPRC, gives each student
12 free male condoms each quarter. Con
doms not your thing? You can substitute
lube samples, female condoms, dental dams,
chemical contraceptives and massage oil
samples.
The first time you discover a rash... down there:

Maybe your Full Moon on the Quad got a little
too freaky (hopefully it didn't get too freaky with that
girl in your IHUM section because you will have to
sit next to her on Monday). Maybe it was with the
guy down the hall. Either way, Stanford is not com
pletely Isolated from the outside world and this sort
of stuff happens. Luckily, the SHPRC has an inter-

active, doit-yourself STD diagnosis Web page
IDs-html).
The first time you wake up next to someone you
don't know:
Roxy can't say it happens to everyone but it
will definitely happen to some of you. Roxy's
best move is the quick exit. Don't attempt to say
the person's name. Don't even put yourself in a
situation that would require you to say a name
or any information specific to the person. Grab
your clothes, say a quick goodbye and leave. It's
when you see that person in math section and
you STILL can't remember their name... Roxy
just can't help you there.

The first time... :
First of all, it will not be perfect. Even if it
is with the right person, it will be bad or bor
dering on bad, so don't have your expecta
tions too high. Some of the best advice that
Roxy ever got was to have her first time with
someone relatively random and then just

walk away. If that isn't your thing, well, just
be forewarned.
The first time you hook up with the girl down
the hall:
Everyone knows. Everyone. If it isn't a long
term thing, you better end it fast. Nothing hits
the fan harder than hall drama. In the end, it is
better not to start it unless it is a marriage - at
least for the year. Roxy has her own rules against
dating in her dorm. The boys in Cedro are just as
cute as the boys in Paloma, seriously.
Roxy knows that all of you will have sexual ■»
fun this year. Enjoy yourself! We all need some
sexual healing.
