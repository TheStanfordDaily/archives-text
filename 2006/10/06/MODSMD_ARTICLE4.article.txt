# In search of AN OFFENSE
## Stanford needs receivers to come up big against Notre Dame 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Last Saturday's 31-0 blowout loss to UCLA at the
Rose Bowl may have marked ;i revealing transition in
Stanford's season. While the defense showed dramatic
improvement, the Cardinal's offensive performance was
decidedly dismal.
Hi rough the first three quarters of play, Stanford (0-5,
0-3 Pac-10) — entering the contest with the worst
NCAA Division l-A run defense — allowed UCLA only
seven offensive points. Perhaps more encouraging, how
ever. was the sheer tenacity displayed by the Cardinal's
defensive unit, which found itself backed up in the red
zone on several early occasions and simply refused to
break.
The Cardinal's offensive performance, on the other
hand, was truly disastrous. Stanford only managed to net
166 yards of total offense for an average of 2.8 yards per
offensive play, solidifying the perception that the injury
riddled unit could have trouble scoring points for the rest
of the season.
"It has been extremely frustrating — especially this
year — because we have so many returning starters on
offense," said senior guard Josiah Vinson. "We have real

ly high expectations of ourselves individually, and as an
offense. II I had the answers. I guess I'd be the coach or
s< miething."
And the Cardinal will need to find answers quickly if
they hope to stand a chance against No. 12 Notre Dame
(4-1) this Saturday in front of a national television audi
ence. Based on last Saturday's result the offense has the
biggest strides to make.The key question may be whether
senior quarterback Trend lidwards will be able to mesh
with a young, injury-depleted wide receiver corps lacking
senior standouts Evan Moore and Mark Bradford.
"It's been a big adjustment period." Vinson said "We
have guys that have been preparing to play — but every
one else didn't expect them to play that much — and now
they're playing key roles. But we don't make excuses for
who we've lost, we just play with who we have."
The task of finding go-to receivers against a nationally
ranked opponent w ill be especially difficult given the way
Notre Dame's pass defense has performed so far this sea
son. In five games this year, the Irish have allowed only
one opponent's top receiver to gain over I (K) yards. Kven
more daunting, that receiver was Calvin Johnson of Geor
gia Tech. whom manv experts consider the best receiver in
the NCAA.
"On defense, I'm impressed with how well they run
and the speed of their corners," Stanford coach Walt I lar
r is said. "It will be a big challenge for us. but we're not re
ally concerned about Notre Dame — that can't be our
focus. Our focus has to be on ourselves and
doing the things that we do and are asked to
do."
One Cardinal receiver showing signs of
developing into the kind of true deep-threat
that the Cardinal so desperately need is
freshman Richard Sherman, who has had
two fairly successful outings this year, one
against San Jose State (six catches for 71
yards and a touchdown) and the other
against IJ( LA (four catches for 50 yards).
I iarris expressed optimism regarding Sher
man's future on the team.
"As [Sherman] continues to practice

well, he will lie rewarded with more playing
time." Harris said. "He did some nice things
in the game [versus UCLA] and competed
hard. I le gave us a little extra and right now
that is really important — it is what we
need."
Against the tough Irish pass defense,
though, it will not only be young receivers
that need to step up their game, but Ed
wards as well. Hie senior Cardinal signal
caller has had considerable difficulty in get
ting the ball to the unfamiliar faces tilling in
for Bradford and Moore.
"In many ways he is doing a great job,"

11 arris said. "You never see him complain
about the cards he has been dealt and has to
play with, and I admire him tremendously.
I le has made a lot of real good plays and has
scrambled for some first downs that were
great. I le just has to take care of his game
lie can't let everybody else's game affect
how his game is."
On Saturday, a national audience will see
if the Cardinal quarterback can do just that.
But perhaps more important, for both Stan
ford's present and future, is the improve
ment his surrounding cast hopes to demon
strate against the No. 12 team in the country.
