# In search of AN OFFENSE
## Stanford needs receivers to come up big against Notre Dame 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Last Saturday's 31-0 blowout loss to UCLA at the
Rose Bowl may have marked ;i revealing transition in
Stanford's season. While the defense showed dramatic
improvement, the Cardinal's offensive performance was
decidedly dismal.
Hi rough the first three quarters of play, Stanford (0-5,
0-3 Pac-10) — entering the contest with the worst
NCAA Division l-A run defense — allowed UCLA only
seven offensive points. Perhaps more encouraging, how
ever. was the sheer tenacity displayed by the Cardinal's
defensive unit, which found itself backed up in the red
zone on several early occasions and simply refused to
break.
The Cardinal's offensive performance, on the other
hand, was truly disastrous. Stanford only managed to net
166 yards of total offense for an average of 2.8 yards per
offensive play, solidifying the perception that the injury
riddled unit could have trouble scoring points for the rest
of the season.
"It has been extremely frustrating — especially this
year — because we have so many returning starters on
offense," said senior guard Josiah Vinson. "We have real

ly high expectations of ourselves individually, and as an
offense. II I had the answers. I guess I'd be the coach or
s< miething."
And the Cardinal will need to find answers quickly if
they hope to stand a chance against No. 12 Notre Dame
(4-1) this Saturday in front of a national television audi
ence. Based on last Saturday's result the offense has the
biggest strides to make.The key question may be whether
senior quarterback Trend lidwards will be able to mesh
with a young, injury-depleted wide receiver corps lacking
senior standouts Evan Moore and Mark Bradford.
"It's been a big adjustment period." Vinson said "We
have guys that have been preparing to play — but every
one else didn't expect them to play that much — and now
they're playing key roles. But we don't make excuses for
who we've lost, we just play with who we have."
The task of finding go-to receivers against a nationally
ranked opponent w ill be especially difficult given the way
Notre Dame's pass defense has performed so far this sea
son. In five games this year, the Irish have allowed only
one opponent's top receiver to gain over I (K) yards. Kven
more daunting, that receiver was Calvin Johnson of Geor
gia Tech. whom manv experts consider the best receiver in
the NCAA.
"On defense, I'm impressed with how well they run
and the speed of their corners," Stanford coach Walt I lar
r is said. "It will be a big challenge for us. but we're not re
ally concerned about Notre Dame — that can't be our
