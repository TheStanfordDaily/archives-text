## FMOTQ reaches out, embraces all Organizers seek to ditch traditional' sketchiness" with greater variety of entertainment and increased dry policy enforcement DAILY STAFF

You can't bring alcohol, you can't bring your bike,
but hot damn, you better bring your saliva.
l"he spit-swapping. Band-rallying, cold-sharing orgy
that is Full Moon on the Quad is upon us once again.and
every corner of campus has been scurrying to prepare
before the clock strikes twelve. Most notably, police and
dorm staff will step up their efforts to discourage public
drunkenness at the event.

Deputy Ken Bates, who does event planning for Stan
ford Police, said that there will be officers roaming the
Quad and patrolling its outer areas to keep Full Moon dry.
"We want to ensure that people don't partake in al
cohol [immediately] prior to coming in." Bates said. "If
we see anyone in there under the age of 21 in possession
of alcohol they could be cited."
Bates added that students deemed to be intoxicated
— defined as being unable to care for yourself or the
safety of others — may be subject to arrest.
Dina Contreras, a 2006 graduate and Vaden's peer
health coordinator, said that the staff is taking extra pre
cautions because the event is on a Saturday.
"We actually are slightly nervous about this Full
Moon because it's a weekend night," Contreras said.
"About half of the freshman will be returning from their
scavenger hunt that day so we're hoping that that may
minimize the front loading. But there is also a football
game before, so we're anxious that people might have
already been drinking." Vaden has also specifically
asked a number of residential staff to hold program
ming events in the hours before Full Moon to provide an
alternative to pre-gaming.
"We want them to dispel the myth that some fresh
men might have heard from upper classmen that this is
a gigantic orgy and kissing fest." Contreras said.
Some upperclassmen. however, were disinclined to
put those "myths" to rest.
"Spreading the love, welcoming the freshman to
campus." said a junior who would only give the name 'J.'
"I love Full Moon!"
Staff from the Vaden and dorm Peer Health Educa
tors will be out in full force tomorrow night, handing out
mouth wash, chocolate kisses and health pamphlets to
those who pass by.
The Band.still on indefinite provisional status, will carry
on its tradition of performing at midnight. Absolute Fun,
the undergraduate programming division of the ASSU.has
lined up an eclectic mix of artists, ranging from Alliance
Streetdance and the Hindi Film Dance team to senior Kris
tine Flaherty, the rapper better known as KFlay.
Sophomore Jordan Goldberg joined his fellow class
presidents to partner with Absolute Fun to plan enter
tainment to make Full Moon more inviting for students
whose lips are sealed he said.
"In the past it's kind of not been an event for every
body and some people don't feel comfortable going," he

said."We wanted to make it more of a concert, and make
it more fun."
Still, rumors about Full Moon abound among fresh
men, whose limited knowledge of the event they scrounge
from upperclassmen and past issues ofThe Daily.
"I hear it's a crazy orgy fest," said freshman Chris
Scales, an opinion echoed by others.
Freshman Sam Stone was barely able to contain his
excitement as he quoted the description of l ull Moon by
his Resident Assistants in Adelfa as "a crazy night of de
bauchery and lewdness."
But other freshmen did not share Stone's enthusi
asm; Freshman Lia Bonamasso said she was not sure she
would attend.
"Well, there's the typical mono/sickness, that's not
such a big deal," she said. "But the whole thing just
seems kind of weird — but it is a tradition."
And freshman Anne French said she would attend,
but strictly as a spectator.
"I heard it used to be some really Neanderthal ritu
al." she said. "Didn't they line frosh girls up and make
them kiss the senior guys?"
Goldberg said he was confident the extra entertain
ment would make the event palatable to more refined
tastes.
"The freshmen." he said."will be able to get a taste of
what Stanford's all about."
I lere's to hoping that taste is minty fresh.
