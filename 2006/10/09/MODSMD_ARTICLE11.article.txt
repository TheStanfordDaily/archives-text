## Editorial Full Moon is waning 
### 
As usual, Saturday's Full Moon on the
Quad involved a handful of arrests,
hospital visits and sneaky Paly High
students, hut this time, something essential
was missing. The University's overarching
presence through official activities, heavy
police presence, and dorm programming
was an understandable attempt to try and
keep a handle on the festivities. But the
meticulously planned character of the night
undermined the uniqueness of Full Moon.
We recognize the need for administration
involvement in terms of safety and risk man
agement. Every year, there are unfortunate
incidents and property is presumably dam
aged. But the need to provide police, sober
monitors and Listerine booths should not
extend into event organization.
With Full Moon as with Band Run. an
enormous amount of the event's inherent
appeal is in its spontaneity. Well-intentioned
as it may be. University interference takes
away from the atmosphere that created the
legend. Full Moon is not popular because it
is a concert. It is popular because it is a crazy,
unpredictable night, and there is a massive
entertainment value in both watching and
joining the fun. Above all. it is a tradition.
It's likely that most freshmen still en
joyed the night.The two most important fac
tors — intoxication and making out — were
still present in full force. But for those of us
who have seen previous Full Moons. Satur

day demonstrated a worrying trend of tame
ness. A number of people left before mid
night. apparently bored with the concert.
Even more disconcerting is the fact that, in
stead of serving as a catalyst for revelry, the
Band was allotted a metered time slot, just
like all the other performers.
We respect the fact that Full Moon is a
great venue for student performances, but
the Band deserves to be more than just one
in a list of featured entertainments. We don't
know it the measures were punitive or sim
ply an effort to level the playing field. In ei
ther case, the Band should be reinstated to
its former status at Full Moon. The
I.SJI IMB is one of the most important ele
ments in making Full Moon about Stanford,
tying it to our pride for our school and its at
mosphere. The Band's rally outfits, frenzied
songs and craz\ dance are emblematic of
the free spirit that night should celebrate;
Full Moon wasn't meant to be strictly ra
tional. proper or orderly — we should not
try to make it so.
Obviously, the Administration is trying to
be supportive and help make sure everyone
is safe. But ultimately. Full Moon thrives on
spontaneity — too much planning changes
this dynamic. In the future we would like to
see Full Moon on the Quad embraced for
the oddit\ that it is rather than compressed
into the formula of all other University
sponsored events.
