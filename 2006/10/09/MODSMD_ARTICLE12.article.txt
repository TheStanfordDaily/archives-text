I am in mourning today for Russian jour
nalist Anna Stepanovna Politkovskaya.
llie fight against despotism, arbitrary
rule and corruption is like a war against
darkness. The only way to defeat it is with
light, to provide the truth and to bring that
information to the public at large so that
people everywhere can see what was hidden.
The horrific murder of this courageous re
porter, whom 1 never met, strikes me as if she
was a close friend.
The world is darker today because of this
crime. Not only for her bold and committed
reporting, not solely for the strength ot her
example, nor merely for the reminder of the
dangers faced by reporters in "the New Rus
sia" should we mourn her passing. She was a
symbol of the Russian intelligentsia's Left, a
group of often disappointed but steadfast pa
triots who believed that Russia, like Europe
and the United States,could have democracy
and a free society with an open media, guar
anteed civil liberties and due process.
Anna Politkovskaya was found dead on
Saturday in her central Moscow apartment
building, just off bustling and cosmopolitan
Tverskaya Street. She was shot twice — once
in the head — and the murder weapon was
left next to her body, the calling card of a pro
fessional assassination. As a reporter,she had
been raking up mud and pounding her fist
into beehives since the years of "openness"
(glasnost') under Gorbachev in the 1980's.
The list of corrupt bureaucrats, politicians
and military officers that she exposed and in
furiated extends from those days, yet it was
not until 1999 that she became the most fa
mous source of criticism of the Kremlin.
In that year she began working for the
Russian periodical Novaya Gazeta, which
remains a bastion of constitutionalist, edu
cated, Westward-leaning Russians. It was for
this magazine that she covered the second
war in Chechnya, a conflict so brutal that its
horror can only be understood anecdotally.
None have been more searing in their cri
tiques of this war than Ms. Politkovskaya.
She brought the moral failures of the Russ
ian operation to all her readers, highlighting
its hypocrisy, futility and inhumanity in her
book, "A Small Corner of Hell: Dispatches
from Chechnya." Few have had her daring,
as a woman in one of the most dangerous
places on earth, to speak truth to the grow
ing power of the Kremlin, to tirelessly advo
cate peace and sanity around the world. 1 ler
prose was Russian writing of a high pedi
gree, her words daggers of compassion and
disappointment that tied us to the violent
immediacy of a living human reality.
A ceaseless opponent of corruption and
valiant champion of human rights, she fought
against corruption and for human rights: she
was due to publish an article this week on
acts of torture committed by the Moscow
backed Chechen president himself. In 2002,
when Chechen terrorists stormed a theater
in Moscow and threatened to kill the audi
ence and cast unless Russian troops with
drew from Chechnya, Ms. Politkovskaya was
one of the brave civilians who entered in di
rect negotiations with the terrorists. She was
a critic who believed that Russia could be
better if its leaders were held to account. She
carried her patriotism, her commitment to
human rights and her scrutiny of her home
land with equal vigor. And she did all this in
spite of threats to her life, attempts on her life
and on that of her daughter. On Saturday, she
died for her courage.
Who contracted her killer? Many will
speculate that the Chechen president, Mr.
Kadyrov, is responsible. No doubt some will
suspect the FSB (the reformed KGB) and
the Russian government itself. Nor need the
deed have been conceived from these

heights - Ms. Politkovskaya hail many ene
mies. and some were mere mid-level bureau
crats or law enforcement officials whose ca
reers had been derailed by her exposes. As
tempting as it is to see this as a high-level act
of political revenge, even this interpretation
has a flip side. Mikhail Gorbachev, who hap
pens to be a major shareholder in Novaya
Gazeta, remarked that the murder could
have been ordered by the Chechen presi
dent's political opponents to make Mr.
Kadyrov look suspicious in the upcoming
election. "Again there is somebody who
wants to cast a shadow both on the leader
ship of the country and on the positive
processes that are taking place in the North
Caucasus." he told Interfax.
No matter who is actually responsible for
Ms. Politkovskaya's murder, it is too soon
now to speculate on his identity. Yet losing
Anna Politkovskaya is a tragedy for all Rus
sians. and it comes at a very disturbing mo
ment in the country. A short walk from Ms.
Politkovskaya's apartment building in
Moscow is a street called Gruzinskiy Val,
which translates to "the Georgian Ram
part." Hie coincidence is ironic, because it is
indeed people like Anna Politkovskaya who
are needed to protect Moscow's Georgian
population in these dangerous times.
Due to the growing close ties between the
Georgia and the US/FU. and the recent
prospect that Georgia might be considered
for NATO membership, the Putin govern
ment has a serious bone to pick with Russia's
former satellite nation.These tensions came
to a head when, in recent weeks, the Geor
gian government detained four Russian mil
itary officers, accusing them of espionage.
The Russian response has been very severe,
including a cancellation of all land trans
portation and a stoppage of postal shipment
between the two countries, as well as the in
troduction of a deportation campaign direct
ed against Georgians, including refugees. It
has been reported that the Russian govern
ment is looking for ethnic Georgians by col
lecting student rosters from schools. When a
Georgian last name appears, the child is
sought out and brought home to his or her
parents, after which the family is interrogat
ed and possibly deported.
This policy isn't exactly ethnic cleansing,
but reports indicate that it is certainly ethni
cally motivated. It is not directed against
Georgia's Saakashvili government,but rather
immigrants, refugees and other working peo
ple. unfairly targeting them on the basis of
theii national origin. In a country that has
sold the books of KKK ideologue in the lobby
of its parliament building, where neo-Nazis
(whom I encountered there, and who target
ed my friend for "looking like a Jew") commit
brutal acts of gang violence and drivel on
about Mein Kampf, the government's re
sponse to the (ieorgian crisis is just one more
step backwards for democracy and human
rights.'Hie blame does not lie solely with Mr.
Putin — but reform must come from some
where. In this quest, last week's loss of Anna
Politkovskaya has dealt her country — and
the world at large — a tragic blow.

have been ordered by the Chechen presi
dent's political opponents to make Mr.
Kadyrov look suspicious in the upcoming
election. "Again there is somebody who
wants to cast a shadow both on the leader
ship of the country and on the positive
processes that are taking place in the North

No matter who is actually responsible for
Ms. Politkovskaya's murder, it is too soon
now to speculate on his identity. Yet losing
Anna Politkovskaya is a tragedy for all Rus
sians. and it comes at a very disturbing mo
ment in the country. A short walk from Ms.
Politkovskaya's apartment building in
Moscow is a street called Gruzinskiy Val,
which translates to "the Georgian Ram
part." Hie coincidence is ironic, because it is
indeed people like Anna Politkovskaya who
are needed to protect Moscow's Georgian
population in these dangerous times.
Due to the growing close ties between the
Georgia and the US/FU. and the recent
prospect that Georgia might be considered
for NATO membership, the Putin govern
ment has a serious bone to pick with Russia's
former satellite nation.These tensions came
to a head when, in recent weeks, the Geor
gian government detained four Russian mil
itary officers, accusing them of espionage.
The Russian response has been very severe,
including a cancellation of all land trans
portation and a stoppage of postal shipment
between the two countries, as well as the in
troduction of a deportation campaign direct
ed against Georgians, including refugees. It
has been reported that the Russian govern
ment is looking for ethnic Georgians by col
lecting student rosters from schools. When a
Georgian last name appears, the child is
sought out and brought home to his or her
parents, after which the family is interrogat
ed and possibly deported.
This policy isn't exactly ethnic cleansing,
but reports indicate that it is certainly ethni
cally motivated. It is not directed against
Georgia's Saakashvili government,but rather
immigrants, refugees and other working peo
ple. unfairly targeting them on the basis of
theii national origin. In a country that has
sold the books of KKK ideologue in the lobby
of its parliament building, where neo-Nazis
(whom I encountered there, and who target
ed my friend for "looking like a Jew") commit
brutal acts of gang violence and drivel on
about Mein Kampf, the government's re
sponse to the (ieorgian crisis is just one more
step backwards for democracy and human
rights.'Hie blame does not lie solely with Mr.
Putin — but reform must come from some
where. In this quest, last week's loss of Anna
Politkovskaya has dealt her country — and
the world at large — a tragic blow.

I am in mourning today for Russian jour
nalist Anna Stepanovna Politkovskaya.
llie fight against despotism, arbitrary
rule and corruption is like a war against
darkness. The only way to defeat it is with
light, to provide the truth and to bring that
information to the public at large so that
people everywhere can see what was hidden.
The horrific murder of this courageous re
porter, whom 1 never met, strikes me as if she
was a close friend.
The world is darker today because of this
crime. Not only for her bold and committed
reporting, not solely for the strength ot her
example, nor merely for the reminder of the
dangers faced by reporters in "the New Rus
sia" should we mourn her passing. She was a
symbol of the Russian intelligentsia's Left, a
group of often disappointed but steadfast pa
triots who believed that Russia, like Europe
and the United States,could have democracy
and a free society with an open media, guar
anteed civil liberties and due process.
Anna Politkovskaya was found dead on
Saturday in her central Moscow apartment
building, just off bustling and cosmopolitan
Tverskaya Street. She was shot twice — once
in the head — and the murder weapon was
left next to her body, the calling card of a pro
fessional assassination. As a reporter,she had
been raking up mud and pounding her fist
into beehives since the years of "openness"
(glasnost') under Gorbachev in the 1980's.
The list of corrupt bureaucrats, politicians
and military officers that she exposed and in
furiated extends from those days, yet it was
not until 1999 that she became the most fa
mous source of criticism of the Kremlin.
In that year she began working for the
Russian periodical Novaya Gazeta, which
remains a bastion of constitutionalist, edu
cated, Westward-leaning Russians. It was for
this magazine that she covered the second
war in Chechnya, a conflict so brutal that its
horror can only be understood anecdotally.
None have been more searing in their cri
tiques of this war than Ms. Politkovskaya.
She brought the moral failures of the Russ
ian operation to all her readers, highlighting
its hypocrisy, futility and inhumanity in her
book, "A Small Corner of Hell: Dispatches
from Chechnya." Few have had her daring,
as a woman in one of the most dangerous
places on earth, to speak truth to the grow
ing power of the Kremlin, to tirelessly advo
cate peace and sanity around the world. 1 ler
prose was Russian writing of a high pedi
gree, her words daggers of compassion and
disappointment that tied us to the violent
immediacy of a living human reality.
A ceaseless opponent of corruption and
valiant champion of human rights, she fought
against corruption and for human rights: she
was due to publish an article this week on
acts of torture committed by the Moscow
backed Chechen president himself. In 2002,
when Chechen terrorists stormed a theater
in Moscow and threatened to kill the audi
ence and cast unless Russian troops with
drew from Chechnya, Ms. Politkovskaya was
one of the brave civilians who entered in di
rect negotiations with the terrorists. She was
a critic who believed that Russia could be
better if its leaders were held to account. She
carried her patriotism, her commitment to
human rights and her scrutiny of her home
land with equal vigor. And she did all this in
spite of threats to her life, attempts on her life
and on that of her daughter. On Saturday, she
died for her courage.
Who contracted her killer? Many will
speculate that the Chechen president, Mr.
Kadyrov, is responsible. No doubt some will
suspect the FSB (the reformed KGB) and
the Russian government itself. Nor need the
deed have been conceived from these

heights - Ms. Politkovskaya hail many ene
mies. and some were mere mid-level bureau
crats or law enforcement officials whose ca
reers had been derailed by her exposes. As
tempting as it is to see this as a high-level act
of political revenge, even this interpretation
has a flip side. Mikhail Gorbachev, who hap
pens to be a major shareholder in Novaya
Gazeta, remarked that the murder could
have been ordered by the Chechen presi
dent's political opponents to make Mr.
Kadyrov look suspicious in the upcoming
election. "Again there is somebody who
