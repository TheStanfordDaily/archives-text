# You've got the cutest little baby face

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that
people find me trustworthy 1 mean, yes,
my friends aren't afraid I'm going to steal
their things (yet), but, more generally, it
seems like strangers really have the most en
dearing faith in me.
The suspicion first dawned when it seemed
like tourists stopped me abnormally often to
ask whereTVesidder Union was.Then a guy in
Green asked me to watch his books while he
went to the bathroom (against the off-chance
that somebody would check out that Milton
before he got a chance to, I guess). I noticed
Italian tourists in Europe started asking me to
take their pictures with expensive-looking
cameras, and then tourists of ;ill shapes and
sizes — tourists in RVs, drivers on tour buses,
women walking by themselves late at night, a
producer from Bollywood — all ol them
wanted to know if I could point them to May
field Avenue. ITiings reached a particularly
ridiculous point with the guy who planted
himself directly in the path of my bike, bring
ing me to a screeching hah so that he could
ask where the Quad was (it was the giant
sandstone structure five feet away).
1 know that Stanford students in general
seem to be considered walking maps by any
one who happens on campus, but I still think
that getting hailed from an RV on the road
constitutes an unusual amount ol attention.
There have been a few explanations of

fered for this phenomenon. It's true that I'm
young and female, which makes it seem less
likely that I'll steal the camera, library book
or wallet of the person talking to me. My
grandma has suggested that I look soft and
huggable, like a stuffed animal, but then
again, my grandma is eighty-five and says a
lot of things that don't make any sense. And
while I'd like to believe that it's due to my
overwhelming attractiveness, the fact that
the majority of those who stop me are either
a) middle-aged women or b) gruff Soviet
men, leads me to reject this hypothesis.
So I turn to the BBC, whose findings are
probably not groundbreaking but are deliv
ered in an authoritative British accent. Ap
parently, according to a show I dimly remem
ber watching, when people on the street are
asked to choose between sketches of two dif
ferent face types, they prefer round faces and
circular eyes to angular faces with narrow
eyes.

"'llia' one's nicer," a woman on the street
says, pointing to a picture that looks exactly
like my face.'it's so sot' lookin."
"You see." the announcer says, authorita
tively, "the roundedness of the face reminds
people of children and makes them consider
the person more trustworthy."
So in other words, the BBC is saying that
people trust me because I have a baby face. I
have a tiny baby face.and people think that a
baby wouldn't take someone's copy of
Chaucer while they're in the bathroom. I
guess it makes some twisted kind of sense. To
Joe Blow on the street, who wants a picture of
himself in front of the Charles Bridge but
doesn't want his camera stolen, he has to
make a split-second decision based on looks
alone as to who is trustworthy
And then he sees me, and he's like,"That's
a baby face. I'ma' trust her."
It seems kind of unfair, really — there are
so many sides to me besides my childlike coun
tenance. I can be disgustingly vulgar (No. seri
ously. Just ask me about your mom).and 1 have
the cynical mind of a chain-smoking forty-five
year old news editor, but I guess that just does
n't matter. And as one of my high school
friends pointed out when 1 told him about my
face shape theory."l seem to remember a cer
tain "baby-faced" person who loved to take

other people's things and see how
long it was until they noticed."
During my senior year of high
school. I went through a brief phase
where 1 took people's watches, jack
ets, etc. when they weren't looking

and hid them somewhere. lhe logic
escapes me now, but I guess at the
time I thought it was cute or quirky
and a surefire way to win popularity
lor myself when people were like,
"Where did my jacket g-... SIN I." And
then people would know my name! In
any case, my plan always backfired
because I would look so darn guile
less that people never thought I took
it. They would ask me if I did. and I
would look back at them with my

baby face, anil they would go arouiuj
the room interrogating everyone elsix
But anyway, my point is th.tt l id
not as innocent as I look.
