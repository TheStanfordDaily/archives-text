# Getting organized with Google Calendar
## 
### 
School is back in full swing and it's time to
get organized. For many Stanford students,
keeping track of their myriad activities,class
es and extracurriculars poses a constant
dilemma.
Pink Calendars? No thanks.
Over the years. I had grown accustomed to
using the little red official Stanford planners
sold en masse at our bookstore, rhese plan
ners had their downsides: by year's end, my
planner would invariably be so torn and
wrinkly from backpack abuse and leaky Nal
genes that it would be almost unusable.
Worse, this year the bookstore phased out
my beloved cardinal-red covered calendar
for ersatz pink and baby blue replacements.
Fortunately, there are a number of soft ware
based alternatives.
Digital calendars offer advantages over
traditional paper and pencil. For example,
they are easy to backup, share and print.
Moreover, digital calendars make keeping
track of regular events easy. Anniversaries,
birthdays and weekly class schedules need
only to be entered once —whereas on a
paper-based system they would require a te
dious marking of every instance
Corporate Calendars
Until recently there were only two cate
gories of computer-based calendars: corpo
rate server-based calendaring systems such

as Novell Netware or Microsoft Exchange
Server and stand-alone calendar clients such
as Outlook. iC'al or Sunbird. Server-based
systems accessible over networks allowed
for collaborating and sharing calendars. Un
fortunately, only corporations or large insti
tutions could afford them.The rest of us were
left with stand-alone clients. Stand-alone cal
endars are limited in use, because you can
only easily access your calendar from a single
computer. Ihose who had multiple comput
ers or wanted to take their calendar to work
were left in a lurch. 1 lowever, Google is now
offering a free full-fledged web-based calen
daring system called Google Calendar that
offers unrivaled features and services.
Google Goes Calendar
Google Calendar is accessible to those
with a free Google account at
calendar.google.com. Google Calendar
looks and acts very similar to iCal. Apple's
default calendaring system. Even though it is

browser-based. Google Calendar uses
Google's signature AJAX technology: so it
looks and feels like an application. Manipu
lating events is a breeze. You can click and
drag events, edit text inline and navigate
through different views without ever re
freshing your browser window. Behind the
scenes. Google Calendar supports the open
iCalendar standard which makes calendars
easy to export and alleviates fears that your
data will be lost in some Google-only propri
etary format.
11l ere are a number of features that
make Google Calendar stand out from all
other calendaring software. lb begin with,
Google makes it easy to find and subscribe
to other public calendars. Simply typing
"Stanford Academic Calendar in the
"Search Public Calendars" bar. for example,
yields a public calendar with all of the uni
versity holidays as well as add and drop
deadlines. You can include calendars for fed
eral I lolidays. sports team schedules or any
thing else. Users can even publish their cal
endars so that anyone with Google Calen
dar or an iCalendar compliant system can
subscribe. ITiis is especially usefui for dorm
events or for community groups. Moreover,
since Cioogle Calendar is web-based, as long
as you have Net access nearby you won't be
far from your calendar.

Google has been especially inno
vative in a number of areas. ('licking
"Flint" auto-generates a 1*1)1. which
makes for elegant printing. Google
also allows you to search your calen
dar just as you would search the web.
However, my favorite feature is the
"Quick Add," which ;ilK»\v n users to
add new events in a natural language.
For example.l can type "IM I Inmate
Frisbee at Sand 11 ill every Sunday 3-
4 p.m.." and Google, in all of its bril

liance, will understand what I wrote
and create the event. I find this par
ticularly useful because I can often
copy and paste text from emails or
other documents into the "Quick
Add" dialogue box, and Google will
do the rest. I have yet to see this serv
ice on an) stand-alone client, and 1
don't expect to anytime soon.
Google Calendar is undoubtedly
the best calendaring software avail
able, but no software is perfect.
There are couple of areas where
(Joogle could improve before Calen
dar jumps out of "Beta."The "Quick
Add" feature should give a preview
of the event it is about to create to
see if there are any conflicts. Also, in
Calendar View mode, Google onlv

allows you to manipulate events itj
increments of half an hour. Google
needs to allow finer adjustment*
This is exceptional!) obnoxious
when I want to push something back
15 minutes and instead have to opcu
a dialog box or change views. Lastly.
Google should add a "to-do" list,
which is a standard feature in mosl
other calendaring software. Despite
these flaws. 1 still find that I am niucfi
happier with Google Calendar than
ni\ tattered paper alternative.

School is back in full swing and it's time to
get organized. For many Stanford students,
keeping track of their myriad activities,class
es and extracurriculars poses a constant
dilemma.
Pink Calendars? No thanks.
Over the years. I had grown accustomed to
using the little red official Stanford planners
sold en masse at our bookstore, rhese plan
ners had their downsides: by year's end, my
planner would invariably be so torn and
wrinkly from backpack abuse and leaky Nal
genes that it would be almost unusable.
Worse, this year the bookstore phased out
my beloved cardinal-red covered calendar
for ersatz pink and baby blue replacements.
Fortunately, there are a number of soft ware
based alternatives.
Digital calendars offer advantages over
traditional paper and pencil. For example,
they are easy to backup, share and print.
Moreover, digital calendars make keeping
track of regular events easy. Anniversaries,
birthdays and weekly class schedules need
only to be entered once —whereas on a
paper-based system they would require a te
dious marking of every instance
Corporate Calendars
Until recently there were only two cate
gories of computer-based calendars: corpo
rate server-based calendaring systems such

as Novell Netware or Microsoft Exchange
Server and stand-alone calendar clients such
as Outlook. iC'al or Sunbird. Server-based
systems accessible over networks allowed
for collaborating and sharing calendars. Un
fortunately, only corporations or large insti
tutions could afford them.The rest of us were
left with stand-alone clients. Stand-alone cal
endars are limited in use, because you can
only easily access your calendar from a single
computer. Ihose who had multiple comput
ers or wanted to take their calendar to work
were left in a lurch. 1 lowever, Google is now
offering a free full-fledged web-based calen
daring system called Google Calendar that
offers unrivaled features and services.
Google Goes Calendar
Google Calendar is accessible to those
with a free Google account at
calendar.google.com. Google Calendar
looks and acts very similar to iCal. Apple's
default calendaring system. Even though it is

browser-based. Google Calendar uses
Google's signature AJAX technology: so it
looks and feels like an application. Manipu
lating events is a breeze. You can click and
drag events, edit text inline and navigate
through different views without ever re
freshing your browser window. Behind the
scenes. Google Calendar supports the open
iCalendar standard which makes calendars
easy to export and alleviates fears that your
data will be lost in some Google-only propri
etary format.
11l ere are a number of features that
make Google Calendar stand out from all
other calendaring software. lb begin with,
Google makes it easy to find and subscribe
to other public calendars. Simply typing
"Stanford Academic Calendar in the
"Search Public Calendars" bar. for example,
yields a public calendar with all of the uni
versity holidays as well as add and drop
deadlines. You can include calendars for fed
eral I lolidays. sports team schedules or any
thing else. Users can even publish their cal
endars so that anyone with Google Calen
dar or an iCalendar compliant system can
subscribe. ITiis is especially usefui for dorm
events or for community groups. Moreover,
since Cioogle Calendar is web-based, as long
as you have Net access nearby you won't be
far from your calendar.

Our Modern World
Make it Natural
Google has been especially inno
vative in a number of areas. ('licking
"Flint" auto-generates a 1*1)1. which
makes for elegant printing. Google
also allows you to search your calen
dar just as you would search the web.
However, my favorite feature is the
"Quick Add," which ;ilK»\v n users to
add new events in a natural language.
For example.l can type "IM I Inmate
Frisbee at Sand 11 ill every Sunday 3-
4 p.m.." and Google, in all of its bril

liance, will understand what I wrote
and create the event. I find this par
ticularly useful because I can often
copy and paste text from emails or
other documents into the "Quick
Add" dialogue box, and Google will
do the rest. I have yet to see this serv
ice on an) stand-alone client, and 1
don't expect to anytime soon.
Google Calendar is undoubtedly
the best calendaring software avail
able, but no software is perfect.
There are couple of areas where
