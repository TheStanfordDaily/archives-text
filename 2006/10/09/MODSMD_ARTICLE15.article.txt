# Getting organized with Google Calendar
## 
### 
School is back in full swing and it's time to
get organized. For many Stanford students,
keeping track of their myriad activities,class
es and extracurriculars poses a constant
dilemma.
Pink Calendars? No thanks.
Over the years. I had grown accustomed to
using the little red official Stanford planners
sold en masse at our bookstore, rhese plan
ners had their downsides: by year's end, my
planner would invariably be so torn and
wrinkly from backpack abuse and leaky Nal
genes that it would be almost unusable.
Worse, this year the bookstore phased out
my beloved cardinal-red covered calendar
for ersatz pink and baby blue replacements.
Fortunately, there are a number of soft ware
based alternatives.
Digital calendars offer advantages over
traditional paper and pencil. For example,
they are easy to backup, share and print.
Moreover, digital calendars make keeping
track of regular events easy. Anniversaries,
birthdays and weekly class schedules need
only to be entered once â€”whereas on a
paper-based system they would require a te
dious marking of every instance
Corporate Calendars
Until recently there were only two cate
gories of computer-based calendars: corpo
rate server-based calendaring systems such

as Novell Netware or Microsoft Exchange
Server and stand-alone calendar clients such
as Outlook. iC'al or Sunbird. Server-based
systems accessible over networks allowed
for collaborating and sharing calendars. Un
fortunately, only corporations or large insti
tutions could afford them.The rest of us were
left with stand-alone clients. Stand-alone cal
endars are limited in use, because you can
only easily access your calendar from a single
computer. Ihose who had multiple comput
ers or wanted to take their calendar to work
were left in a lurch. 1 lowever, Google is now
offering a free full-fledged web-based calen
daring system called Google Calendar that
offers unrivaled features and services.
Google Goes Calendar
Google Calendar is accessible to those
with a free Google account at
calendar.google.com. Google Calendar
looks and acts very similar to iCal. Apple's
default calendaring system. Even though it is

browser-based. Google Calendar uses
Google's signature AJAX technology: so it
looks and feels like an application. Manipu
lating events is a breeze. You can click and
drag events, edit text inline and navigate
through different views without ever re
freshing your browser window. Behind the
scenes. Google Calendar supports the open
iCalendar standard which makes calendars
easy to export and alleviates fears that your
data will be lost in some Google-only propri
etary format.
11l ere are a number of features that
make Google Calendar stand out from all
other calendaring software. lb begin with,
Google makes it easy to find and subscribe
to other public calendars. Simply typing
"Stanford Academic Calendar in the
"Search Public Calendars" bar. for example,
yields a public calendar with all of the uni
versity holidays as well as add and drop
deadlines. You can include calendars for fed
eral I lolidays. sports team schedules or any
thing else. Users can even publish their cal
endars so that anyone with Google Calen
dar or an iCalendar compliant system can
subscribe. ITiis is especially usefui for dorm
events or for community groups. Moreover,
since Cioogle Calendar is web-based, as long
as you have Net access nearby you won't be
far from your calendar.
