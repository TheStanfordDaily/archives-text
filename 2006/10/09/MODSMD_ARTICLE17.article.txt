## No luck with Irish OFFENSE FLOUNDERS AGAIN IN 31-10 LOSS Missal opportunities doom Card against powerful Notre Dame offense 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
SOI 111 BhND, Ind. Id one of coll cue football's most sto
ried venues, Notre Dame quarterback Bradv Quinn threw for
232 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Irish to an easy 31-
10 victory over Stanford.
" We ran into a good football team w •)- grxjd quarterback,
and they protected him tremendous!;, . and operated like
you expect them to," head coach Walt H • • nd.
And the discrepancy between the tc ~ talent manifested
itself on the field. Stanford (()-(>. 0-3 Pat-1 i ran just 49 offen
sive plays to Notre Dame's 77,0n e factor that helped the Irish
(5-1) to out-gain the Cardinal by 210 yards. 436-226, and pos
sess the ball for nearly 10 more minutes.
"I'm content with this game." Notre Dame head coach Char

lie Weis said."First of all. [I'm happy] with the offense. And when
the defense goes out there and gives them one long drive and ba
sically shuts them down the rest of the day, that's a good thing."
On the game's opening drive. Quinn capped a 17-play se

quence with an eight-yard touchdown strike to Ail-American
receiver Jeff Samardzija. Stanford responded with a 14-play
drive ending in a 19-yard field goal from junior kicker Aaron
Zagory to pull within 7-3 with 1:15 to go in the first.

But then Notre Dame turned up the pressure from its de
fensive line.
Hurried into bad looks. Stanford senior quarterback Trent
Edwards would throw for just 23 yards the rest of the after
noon. All told, the Irish held Stanford to just 72 rushing yards
on 31 carries and notched five sacks. Three of those sacks came
from defensive end Victor Abiamiri and even I lari is showed
relief when the game was over.
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but we won't have to face him
again?" 1 larris said.
Though the senior Abiamiri played his last game against the
Cardinal, many expect the pass-protection woes to continue.
Stanford has allowed 2b sacks this season, ranking 115 out of
119 in the nation.
"We might just try toget [Abiamiri] toseea psychologist see
if we can put an "S" on all these helmets we're going against be
cause he turns into a pass-rushing demon when we go against
them," Weis said.
