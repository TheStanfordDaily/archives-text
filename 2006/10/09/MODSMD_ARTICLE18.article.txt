# Inside The Game: Tailback Toss
## 
### 
Stanford's offense, lackluster since kicking a field goal on
the first drive of the game, finally found the end zone on
a halfback pass in the fourth quarter. Quarterback Trent Ed
wards faked a dive to the fullback and pitched the other way
to Anthony Kimble (26), with a play that had earned yardage
earlier in the game. This time, Kimble cocked back and threw
a bomb to a wide-open Kelton Lynn (86), who had been left
alone as Notre Dame defenders bit on the run action. Lynn
outran the secondary for the 57-yard score. The team's first
touchdown in eight quarters vas also its longest play to date
this season.
