## Campus concert hall in the works Surprise donation announced before Rigoletto opera simulcast 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It is not Lincoln Center, but the University took
one step closer toward being a cultural and arts hub
Friday when it presented a free, live opera at Frost
Amphitheater just hours after announcing a $50 mil
lion gift to build a new campus concert hall.
The big news came before the first note was sung,
as officials announced that Helen and Peter Bing had
donated money to build a new world-class concert
hall.
The University hopes to make the hall the center
piece of a new performing arts center on campus —
part of plans developed by the Stanford Arts Initiative,
a multidisciplinary effort that aims to bring more re
sources and attention to the arts on campus.
"We are grateful for such strong and early support
for the arts initiative,"said Assoc.Art Prof. Bryan Wolf,
one of two co-directors of the Stanford Arts Initiative.
"With this gift — and others that we hope will follow
— we intend to transform the arts at Stanford."
While the timing and details of construction have
yet to be determined, the University plans to build the
( )(K) seat concert hall and the rest of the performing
arts space next to the Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni
Center.
"It will be something that is very accessible to stu
dents and the campus community, and also to the com
munity outside of campus," said Jonathan Berger, the
other co-director of the Stanford Arts Initiative.
According to a University press release, the plans
for the concert hall include a studio theater, an out
door theater garden and other spaces, including a cos
tume shop and recording studios.
"The acoustics in the concert hall will be superb,"
Berger said. "And it will be a large enough venue for
performances by the 90-inember Stanford Symphony
Orchestra."
Berger could not publicly release other details
about the new center.
The Stanford Aits Initiative, in con
junction with the San Francisco
Opera, also arranged for the perform
ance that followed the announcement
of the new concert hall.
The simulcast presentation of
Rigoletto featured a nineteenth-cen
tury opera with a twenty-first century
twist. While operatic voices dazzled
the crowd on campus, the singers were
actually standing on a San Francisco
stage 40 miles away.
Utilizing state-of-the-art sound
equipment and custom cinematogra
phy, the performance could he heard
and seen at Frost Amphitheater simul
taneously with the actual performance
on stage at San Francisco's War
Memorial Opera I louse.
The Opera was also screened as a
simulcast at the city's Beaux A its Civic
Center Plaza.
"The opera actually approached us
about the idea,"said Mary Rafter)'. ex
ecutive director of the Stanford insti
tute for Creativity and the Aris. which
helped organize the event along with
Stanford Events and Stanford Lively
Arts.
Raftery said that Rigoletto was
the first step in a longer partnership
between Stanford and the San Fran
cisco Opera. She added that the Uni
versity is currently talking with the
Opera about a piece by renowned
composer Philip Glass, (ilass may
visit campus in the fall of 2007, when
his opera debuts.
More immediate collaboration be
tween the University and the Opera is
already underway.
"The partnership is being devel
oped on a number of fronts." Berger
said. "We'll be doing an IHUM and
perhaps a freshman seminar related to
the opera. We want to raise the sense

that opera is an exciting, vibrant art
form."
He added that group trips to the
Opera are being organized through
Residential Education, and one Row
1 louse had already made plans to go.
The high student attendance at Fri
day's performance appears to indicate
that there is definite interest in opera
on campus. Raftery estimated that
there were about 3,500 people in
Frost, which was "better than expect
ed."
And despite the free ice cream for
students, not all who attended were
freshmen.
" I was amazed at how many pet >ple
were there and how varied their back
ground was." said sophomore Liz
Brody. "There were people from the
community, students, and even people
on dates."
Other students remarked that the
comfort of Frost's relaxed seating and
the close-up views made for a better
experience than actually attending the
opera.
While Raftery claimed the resolu
tion for the simulcast was the same
quality as an LCD screen or a high def
inition television and that the sound
was of concert quality, some students
complained that the screen was too
small.
The equipment used for the simul
cast was arranged by the Opera ac
cording to technical specifications
from the University.The Stanford Arts
Initiative funded half of the cost of the
event, with help from the President's
Fund. ITie other half was covered by
the Opera.
Rigoletto takes place in the court
of the Duke of Mantua during the Ital
ian Renaissance and centers around
Rigoletto. a court jester whose acidic
temperament is tamed only by the
love he has for a daughter he keeps
concealed. When he finds that the
Duke has seduced his daughter. Rigo
letto plans to have the Duke killed.
But when plans go awry, his daughter
is killed instead.

( )(K) seat concert hall and the rest of the performing
arts space next to the Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni
Center.
"It will be something that is very accessible to stu
dents and the campus community, and also to the com
munity outside of campus," said Jonathan Berger, the
other co-director of the Stanford Arts Initiative.
According to a University press release, the plans
for the concert hall include a studio theater, an out
door theater garden and other spaces, including a cos
tume shop and recording studios.
"The acoustics in the concert hall will be superb,"
Berger said. "And it will be a large enough venue for
performances by the 90-inember Stanford Symphony
Orchestra."
Berger could not publicly release other details
about the new center.
The Stanford Aits Initiative, in con
junction with the San Francisco
Opera, also arranged for the perform
ance that followed the announcement
of the new concert hall.
The simulcast presentation of
Rigoletto featured a nineteenth-cen
tury opera with a twenty-first century
twist. While operatic voices dazzled
the crowd on campus, the singers were
actually standing on a San Francisco
stage 40 miles away.
Utilizing state-of-the-art sound
equipment and custom cinematogra
phy, the performance could he heard
and seen at Frost Amphitheater simul
taneously with the actual performance
on stage at San Francisco's War
Memorial Opera I louse.
The Opera was also screened as a
simulcast at the city's Beaux A its Civic
Center Plaza.
"The opera actually approached us
about the idea,"said Mary Rafter)'. ex
ecutive director of the Stanford insti
tute for Creativity and the Aris. which
helped organize the event along with
Stanford Events and Stanford Lively
Arts.
Raftery said that Rigoletto was
the first step in a longer partnership
between Stanford and the San Fran
cisco Opera. She added that the Uni
versity is currently talking with the
Opera about a piece by renowned
composer Philip Glass, (ilass may
visit campus in the fall of 2007, when
his opera debuts.
More immediate collaboration be
tween the University and the Opera is
already underway.
"The partnership is being devel
oped on a number of fronts." Berger
said. "We'll be doing an IHUM and
perhaps a freshman seminar related to
the opera. We want to raise the sense

that opera is an exciting, vibrant art
form."
He added that group trips to the
Opera are being organized through
Residential Education, and one Row
1 louse had already made plans to go.
The high student attendance at Fri
day's performance appears to indicate
that there is definite interest in opera
on campus. Raftery estimated that
there were about 3,500 people in
Frost, which was "better than expect
ed."
And despite the free ice cream for
students, not all who attended were
freshmen.
" I was amazed at how many pet >ple
were there and how varied their back
ground was." said sophomore Liz
Brody. "There were people from the
community, students, and even people
on dates."
Other students remarked that the
comfort of Frost's relaxed seating and
the close-up views made for a better
experience than actually attending the
opera.
While Raftery claimed the resolu
tion for the simulcast was the same
quality as an LCD screen or a high def
inition television and that the sound
was of concert quality, some students
complained that the screen was too
small.
The equipment used for the simul
cast was arranged by the Opera ac
cording to technical specifications
from the University.The Stanford Arts
Initiative funded half of the cost of the
event, with help from the President's
Fund. ITie other half was covered by
the Opera.
Rigoletto takes place in the court
of the Duke of Mantua during the Ital
ian Renaissance and centers around
Rigoletto. a court jester whose acidic
temperament is tamed only by the
love he has for a daughter he keeps
concealed. When he finds that the
Duke has seduced his daughter. Rigo
letto plans to have the Duke killed.
But when plans go awry, his daughter
is killed instead.
