## Campus concert hall in the works Surprise donation announced before Rigoletto opera simulcast 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It is not Lincoln Center, but the University took
one step closer toward being a cultural and arts hub
Friday when it presented a free, live opera at Frost
Amphitheater just hours after announcing a $50 mil
lion gift to build a new campus concert hall.
The big news came before the first note was sung,
as officials announced that Helen and Peter Bing had
donated money to build a new world-class concert
hall.
The University hopes to make the hall the center
piece of a new performing arts center on campus —
part of plans developed by the Stanford Arts Initiative,
a multidisciplinary effort that aims to bring more re
sources and attention to the arts on campus.
"We are grateful for such strong and early support
for the arts initiative,"said Assoc.Art Prof. Bryan Wolf,
one of two co-directors of the Stanford Arts Initiative.
"With this gift — and others that we hope will follow
— we intend to transform the arts at Stanford."
While the timing and details of construction have
yet to be determined, the University plans to build the
( )(K) seat concert hall and the rest of the performing
arts space next to the Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni
Center.
"It will be something that is very accessible to stu
dents and the campus community, and also to the com
munity outside of campus," said Jonathan Berger, the
other co-director of the Stanford Arts Initiative.
According to a University press release, the plans
for the concert hall include a studio theater, an out
door theater garden and other spaces, including a cos
tume shop and recording studios.
"The acoustics in the concert hall will be superb,"
Berger said. "And it will be a large enough venue for
performances by the 90-inember Stanford Symphony
Orchestra."
Berger could not publicly release other details
