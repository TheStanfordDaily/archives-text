# ANALYSIS
## Running out of chances 
### 
It's Saturday night and I'm in a
har. Cool enough,except I'm lie
hind a laptop writing this piece.
(In my defense though, the social
life in north-central Indiana isn't
exactly kicking. Let's just say the
women make Stanford's perform
ance at Notre Dame look beauti
ful).
With the extracurriculars out of
the way, let's get to some thoughts
after reaching the midpoint of Stan
ford's football season.
Thoughts on Notre Dame
In terms of architecture, climate
and football culture, Notre Dame
reminds me a lot of my hometown
University of Michigan. A couple of
caveats though: the stadium is small
er and the coaches and media rela
tions staff are much savvier and
more friendly (And the press buffet
is lightyears better — why do you
think Notre Dame gets its own tele
vision network and all the favorable
coverage?).
Oh. and the public is a tad more
football-obsessed. What gave me
that impression?
•Being forced to navigate a group of
several hundred fans after leaving
the post-game interview session.
This was an hour after the final
whistle of a three-touchdown
blowout. The fans were camped out
by the hundreds outside the gate by
the Notre Dame locker room, hop
ing for as much as a peek at their
team.
•It's hardly an isolated phenome
non. Mainstream media reported
quarterback Brady Quinn had so
many students — especially fe
males. knocking on his door for au


Daniel
Novinson
tographs that he had to move to an
unlisted location last summer.
Somehow I doubt Trent Edwards
has been forced to become the Dick
Cheney of Palo Alto. Come to think
of it, last time I saw that many Stan
ford students in line for anything
was seven-percent-off Thursdays at
the Bookstore.
•Instead of more mainstream
music, the Notre Dame band chose
to play other colleges' fight songs as
part of their pregame show. And it
sounded like 20,000 people sung
along.
• And my favorite.That wasn't a rest
stop on Interstate 90. That was the
Knute Rockne I ravel Plaza.
The John L. Smith Award
The honor is named after Michi
gan State's head coach, who melted
down at halftime of a nationally-tel
evised Ohio State game, screaming
to ABC sideline reporter Jack
Arute:" 1 hat's a dang coaching mis
take. rhe kids are playing their tail
off and the coaches are screwing it
up!"
I his week s coaching meltdown
came with three minutes to no in the

first half, with Notre Dame leading
7-3 and the ball at their 32. Credit
for close margin belonged to the
Stanford defense, which had stiff
ened to shut out the Irish after al
lowing a touchdown on the first
drive.
The Davids of this world some
times do slay the Goliaths.and Stan
ford, a 30-point underdog, might
well have pulled off the shocker in
South Bend if left to its own devices.
But I don't know of any David who
won with both hands tied behind his
back. How would he do it? In a
limbo contest? With an intimidating
stare?
Yet that is the position the
coaches (again) put the players in
with overly conservative playcall
ing. Here, defensive coordinator
AJ Christoff must shoulder the
blame for having only three players
rush the quarterback on the drive,
and ordering his secondary 10
yards off the line of scrimmage.
Predictably, in just two minutes,
Notre Dame pushed its lead to 14-
3. The defense never regained its
old form in the second half, and
Stanford would not close within
single digits again.
Starting this Saturday against
Arizona, I hope the coaches bend
over backwards to give their over
matched players the best shot at vic
tory. At a critical moment Saturday,

they gave up on a team that has yet
to quit,
Chasing history, halfway home
At 0-6, Stanford is now halfway
to its first win less season since
1%(). And with Washington look
ing stronger by the week, the only
remaining games where Stanford
will have a realistic shot at a win
come this week versus Arizona and
November 18 versus Oregon State.
1 figure, rather generously, that
Stanford has a 30 percent chance
this weekend and a 40 percent
chance against Oregon State, so the
odds are over 40 percent that Stan
ford will suffer the embarrassment
of being shut out entirely.
In the light of that. I give all the
credit in the world to a team that
continues to improve by the week. 1
don't know a lot of 0-6 teams that
haven't quit on their coaches yet,
and though Stanford won't see the
end of the tunnel this season,
there's reason to think these battles
could reap I heir rewards next sea
son.
And. to end on a lighter note...

tions staff are much savvier and
more friendly (And the press buffet
is lightyears better — why do you
think Notre Dame gets its own tele
vision network and all the favorable
coverage?).
Oh. and the public is a tad more
football-obsessed. What gave me
that impression?
•Being forced to navigate a group of
several hundred fans after leaving
the post-game interview session.
This was an hour after the final
whistle of a three-touchdown
blowout. The fans were camped out
by the hundreds outside the gate by
the Notre Dame locker room, hop
ing for as much as a peek at their
team.
•It's hardly an isolated phenome
non. Mainstream media reported
quarterback Brady Quinn had so
many students — especially fe
males. knocking on his door for au

tographs that he had to move to an
unlisted location last summer.
Somehow I doubt Trent Edwards
has been forced to become the Dick
Cheney of Palo Alto. Come to think
of it, last time I saw that many Stan
ford students in line for anything
was seven-percent-off Thursdays at
the Bookstore.
•Instead of more mainstream
music, the Notre Dame band chose
to play other colleges' fight songs as
part of their pregame show. And it
sounded like 20,000 people sung
along.

The John L. Smith Award
The honor is named after Michi
gan State's head coach, who melted
down at halftime of a nationally-tel
evised Ohio State game, screaming
to ABC sideline reporter Jack
Arute:" 1 hat's a dang coaching mis
take. rhe kids are playing their tail
off and the coaches are screwing it
up!"
I his week s coaching meltdown
came with three minutes to no in the

first half, with Notre Dame leading
7-3 and the ball at their 32. Credit
for close margin belonged to the
Stanford defense, which had stiff
ened to shut out the Irish after al
lowing a touchdown on the first
drive.
The Davids of this world some
times do slay the Goliaths.and Stan
ford, a 30-point underdog, might
well have pulled off the shocker in
South Bend if left to its own devices.
But I don't know of any David who
won with both hands tied behind his
back. How would he do it? In a
limbo contest? With an intimidating
stare?
Yet that is the position the
coaches (again) put the players in
with overly conservative playcall
ing. Here, defensive coordinator
AJ Christoff must shoulder the
blame for having only three players
rush the quarterback on the drive,
and ordering his secondary 10
yards off the line of scrimmage.
Predictably, in just two minutes,
Notre Dame pushed its lead to 14-
3. The defense never regained its
old form in the second half, and
Stanford would not close within
single digits again.
Starting this Saturday against
Arizona, I hope the coaches bend
over backwards to give their over
matched players the best shot at vic
tory. At a critical moment Saturday,

they gave up on a team that has yet
to quit,
Chasing history, halfway home
At 0-6, Stanford is now halfway
to its first win less season since
1%(). And with Washington look
ing stronger by the week, the only
remaining games where Stanford
will have a realistic shot at a win
come this week versus Arizona and
November 18 versus Oregon State.
1 figure, rather generously, that
Stanford has a 30 percent chance
this weekend and a 40 percent
chance against Oregon State, so the
odds are over 40 percent that Stan
ford will suffer the embarrassment
of being shut out entirely.
In the light of that. I give all the
credit in the world to a team that
continues to improve by the week. 1
don't know a lot of 0-6 teams that
haven't quit on their coaches yet,
and though Stanford won't see the
end of the tunnel this season,
there's reason to think these battles
could reap I heir rewards next sea
son.
And. to end on a lighter note...
