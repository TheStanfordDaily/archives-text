Senior captain JJ Garton scored a career
high five goals to lead the Cardinal to victory at
Berkeley and help snap the team's four-game
skid.
"JJ had an awesome game — in addition to

team fired up." said sophomore driver Chris Ja

After losing a number of contests by just
one or two goals, the Cardinal were finally able

Senior captain JJ Garton broke his career-scoring record on Saturday. His previous bes' was three goals in one game and
the Granite Bay, Calif, native scored five at Berkeley.
took home the Steve I leaston Tro
phy for winning this year's Biu
Splash.
Down 6-5 at halftime. Stanford
stormed back on the strength of the
goalie play of backup sophomore
Jimmie Sandman, who has been
playing the second half in many
games.
Sandman stopped of Cal super
star John Mann's penalty shot with
29 seconds left, putting an end to any
potential Bears' rally. Overall, he
held Cal to just three second half
goals and recorded six saves.
Freshman Drac Wigo and sopho
more Will Hindle-Katel (the team's
leading scorer) started Stanford's
second-half comeback rally with a
goal each.
At that point. Garton took over
on offense. I le scored at the end of
the third and the beginning of the
fourth to give the Cardinal a com
fortable lead. Sandman and the
Stanford defense did the rest.

But completely shutting out Cal
in crunch time wasn't an easy task.
Cal senior Andrija Vasiljevic and
Mann kept the game within the
Bear's reach, until Stanford's junior
two-meter Michael Bury respond
ed with two goals in the fourth
quarter.
Ilie last time the two teams met,
Stanford blew a ( )-7 lead with 4:16
left in the game. This time, every
team member and coach wanted to
make sure lightning did not strike
twice.
"For me, the turning point was
when Coach [John] Vargas called a
timeout in the fourth quarter to set
tle us down after Cal scored a goal to
bring the game within one." junior
two-meter Forrest Schwartz said.
"[The timeout] really settled our
team down and ruined Cal's momen
tum."
In addition to successfully accom -
plishing key feats that —like keep
ing Mann in check and scoring at
least nine or 10 goals - the Cardinal
did the little things.
"In regard to people playing their
role, one possession that really sticks
out in my mind is when [junior two
meter) Peter Finlayson came in to

defend two-meters for one posses
sion." Jacobson said. "He came off
the bench, worked hard to draw an
offensive foul and countered [Cal
senior] Brian kinsel as fast as he
could to the other side."
The Golden Bears have three
scoring options outside of Mann, all
of whom had more than 23 goals
coming into the game. Kinsel,
Michael Sharf and Brian Bacharach
have been excellent supporting play
ers. but Stanford took them out of
the game by holding them to three
combined goals.
It was a day of teamwork and a
balanced overall gameplan that
earned the spotlight after the game.
The match was critical for the young
Stanford squad, which has been
looking for a huge win to get them
back on track to the Final Four and
beyond. And anytime Stanford
faces Cal, it makes for a pivotal
game.
"We entered the game and
matched the intensity of the Berke
ley atmosphere and every one of our
players fulfilled their basic team
role," Jacobson said. "When the time
came, guys stepped up to make the
big plays."
