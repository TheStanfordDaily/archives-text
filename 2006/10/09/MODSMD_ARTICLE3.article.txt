## Indie singer performs in EBF lounge Venue represents a marked contrast from traditional SCN shows 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM 
Students packed into the lounge of the Enchant
ed Broccoli Forest Friday for the Stanford Concert
Network's (SCN) first show of the year — singer
and songwriter Jose Gonzalez.
"We wanted to bring Jose here because we felt
he produces intelligent,emotional music that push
es the boundaries of what everyone thinks a
singer/songwriter usually sounds like." said senior
Josh Constine, chief operations officer and vice
president of SCN. "He's way better than most of the
guys you hear at your local coffeehouse."
Of Swedish and Argentinean descent, Gonzalez
rocketed to fame in January of this year with the
song "Heartbeats." Gonzalez also collaborated with
UK duo Zero 7 to provide guest vocals on "In the
Waiting Line," a song featured in the popular"Gar
den State" movie soundtrack of 2004.
From his appearance, it is hard to tell that he is
the newest up-and-coming act in the indie music
scene. A gentle, unassuming man with short black
hair and a beard. Gonzalez wore a simple red polo
shirt and black pants.
Armed with only an acoustic guitar, he sat for all
of his songs and uttered a quiet, "Thank you so
much." at the end of each song as the crowd burst
into cheers and applause. As he nodded in time
and struck the guitar strings. Gonzalez seemed
obliv uuis to the constant chatter at the back of the
room and closed his eyes while crooning songs,
such as • ( losses.' "Love Will Tear Is Apart, and
the ever popular "Heartbeats," into the micro
phone.
I realK liked that it was in HBI instead ol one
of the auditoriums." said junior Amy Eshelman.
"It was so close and intimate."
Constine said the he felt that the small venue
was exciting and helped add to the atmosphere.
'Ihere were a lot of people packed in, and 1
know it was uncomfortable, but it made for a real
l\ high-energy show." he said.
Not all supported the size of the venue.
"It was really hot and there was absolutely no
loom." said senior Megan Reiss. "But it was Jose

He's way better than
most of the guys
you hear at your
local coffee house.

(Jonzalez.so it was worth it."
According to Constine, SCN gained significant
financial advantages hv holding concerts in small
er dorms rather than in the auditoriums.
"The University charges thousands and thou
sands of dollars to open their auditoriums, which
is an unfeasible price for us. since we are a spe
cial-fees group that runs entirely off of money
given to us b\ the ASSU." he said. "They also re
quire us to book the space months in advance,
which just doesn't work for the artists. With most
of the musicians we host, we have to work around
their tour schedules and availability. When we do
events in HBF ; or other dorms, we can book it on
our own terms."
Despite some concerns regarding the location,
the concert appeared to be an overwhelming suc
cess from student reactions. At the conclusion of
Gonzalez's set. the crowd leapt to its feet for a
standing ovation and repeatedly chanted. "One
more song." a request that Gonzalez willingly
obliged.
"There were so many people — the entire
patio was filled!" Constine said. "All of the feed
back I have been getting has been extremely posi
tive, which is encouraging to SCN. It shows us that
we don't have to stick to mainstream artists to
have a large student turnout."
Junior Dylan keil expressed similar enthusi
asm.

"I just love 'Heartbeats.'" he said. "The Sony
commercial that uses it is my first bookmark on
Safari, and the tag just reads 'amazing.' It was so
cool to actually hear it performed live l ight in front
of me."
SCN will kick of I their 750 and Coffee I louse
series this Thursday with a performance by John
Vanderslice in the 750 Pub. The series will contin
ue throughout the quarter, with the venue alter

nating every week between the two locations. Stu
dent groups will be featured at the CoHo, while
outside groups will perform at the 750.
Additionally, Constine promised that a big
name artist would perform at Memorial Auditori
um the weekend of Rig Game, but declined to
specify the name of the artist because the contracts
were still in the process of being signed.
