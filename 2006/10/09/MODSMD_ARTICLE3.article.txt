Students packed into the lounge of the Enchant
ed Broccoli Forest Friday for the Stanford Concert
Network's (SCN) first show of the year â€” singer
and songwriter Jose Gonzalez.
"We wanted to bring Jose here because we felt
he produces intelligent,emotional music that push
es the boundaries of what everyone thinks a
singer/songwriter usually sounds like." said senior
Josh Constine, chief operations officer and vice
president of SCN. "He's way better than most of the
guys you hear at your local coffeehouse."
Of Swedish and Argentinean descent, Gonzalez
rocketed to fame in January of this year with the
song "Heartbeats." Gonzalez also collaborated with
UK duo Zero 7 to provide guest vocals on "In the
Waiting Line," a song featured in the popular"Gar
den State" movie soundtrack of 2004.
From his appearance, it is hard to tell that he is
the newest up-and-coming act in the indie music
scene. A gentle, unassuming man with short black
hair and a beard. Gonzalez wore a simple red polo
shirt and black pants.
Armed with only an acoustic guitar, he sat for all
of his songs and uttered a quiet, "Thank you so
much." at the end of each song as the crowd burst
