### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hie Hand will be performing in the stands this Home
coming weekend for the Arizona match-up and women's
volleyball games, though it will not join in the pre-gameand
halftime festivities.
"Many students and alums have expressed hopes that
we would return to performing field shows, but I guess they
will have to wait another week," said Band Public Rela
tions Coordinator Chris Holt,a co-terminal student in Eng
lish. "'lhis will be the football premiere of the new Dollies
and the new Tree.Tommy Leep, and we share their excite
ment at this marquee event."
The Band's tentatively scheduled appearance will be its
first game-day performance all year at the remodeled Stan
ford Stadium and comes almost a month after the Univer
sity took disciplinary action against the student group. In
September. Vice Provost of Student Affairs Greg Board

man placed the Band on indefinite provisional status after
a I Jniversity report determined that members of the Band
vandalized their former Band Shak.a leased modular near
I ncina Commons and the Serra Complex, on July 17.
But the Dollies have been practicing all summer and the
Band has been "working tirelessly in the last month" to pre
pare for the football season, I lolt. who is also a columnist
for The Daily, said.
"We had our band boot camp a rigorous training regi
men that includes running while playing, eating cheese
burgers at great speed and back-flips," he said.
Ilie newly-created Band Reinstatement Committee
also met for the first time last Friday. Ctreated by the Office
of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs, the committee con
sists of University staff, a Stanford Band Alumni Board
representative, Stanford Band leadership and representa
tives from the Associated Students of Stanford University
(ASSU). While the agenda for the meeting was confiden
tial, the committee is expected to develop criteria for the
Band's reinstatement.
In the meantime, the University continues to require
that all Band activities, including rehearsals and perform-

have begun to work toward that goal.

addressing several organizational de

While I 'niversity restrictions pro
hibited the Band from performing at
any athletic events in September, the
Band was still allowed to recruit new
members via Band Run and the last
week's activities fair 111 White Plaza.
I lolt. who was unable to provide spe
cific recruitment numbers, was
pleased with the Band's popularity
among freshmen.
"The Band is very excited with the
freshmen who have come out thus
far," Holt said. "Our first rehearsal
brought out some bright new faces
that will spark and diversify our musi
cal and performance repertoire."
