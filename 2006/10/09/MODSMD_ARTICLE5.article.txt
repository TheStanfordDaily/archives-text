# Mayhem upstaged by shows
## FMOTQ evokes mixed reactions with scheduled performances 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Students descended upon the Main Quail last night,
intrigued by the mystique ot l ull Moon and expecting
the debauchery that traditionally marks the event. In
stead, some students said they encountered an abun
dance of musical and dance performances and a rela
tive modicum of spontaneous kissing.
"It's not as much of a make-out fest this year be
cause of the emphasis put on the show," sir! one jun
ior, who, like many students, refused to reveal her
name, after kissing a senior.
Organizers of the event arranged for a number of
performances from student hip-hop artists, dancers
and music groups. The action centered on a large stage
at the north end of the Quad, although it became in
creasingly difficult to see the performances as the area
became crowded.
According to Jordan Goldberg, one of foui sopho
more presidents who helped organize the event along
with Absolute bun. the scheduled entertainment was
part of an effort to make l ull Moon appealing to more
chaste attendees.
Many students, however, were critical of the
changes.
"The organization of Full Moon this year is terri
ble." senior Jackie Bernstein said. "It feels sterile and
forced, when it is supposed to be spontaneous."
Most tried to make the best of things. Junior Will
Rogers came clad in nothing but paint and a yellow
bandanna.
"I didn't know if I was even going to come tonight
and ended up coming naked," he said. "II you do any
thing naked, it is completely different."
Junior Mclanie Reynard, though clothed, sported
face and arm paint as well as blinking blue lights in her
hair.
"My goal is to dance and enjoy myself without
being self-conscious, to enjo\ the free-spirited energy,"
she said. "I went to lull Moon two years ago and peo
ple seem less intimidating now. I feel like I have more

control, more power
walking through the
crowd."

for alcohol con

however, said that it
appeared that there
was generally less al

than in past years
and that students ap

The Band also
made an appearance
to the Quad around

midnight with the Tree, decked out 111 shiny palm

chance to see the Band because it had been absent
from recent school events as a result of University dis

the Band was present.
