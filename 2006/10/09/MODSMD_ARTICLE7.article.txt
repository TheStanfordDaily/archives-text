## Full Moon Tradition or excuse for an orgy? A 						FULL MOON IS FULL CIRCLE No need to fear, sophomores and juniors, there is a place for you... 
### ROBERT CROOK FMOTQ REPRESENTATIVE MALE 
Have you heard Coltrane's "Ascension"? A con
tinuous barrage of dissonant and formless avant
garde jazz, it is the sound of rules being rewritten, of
phantasmagorical revelry, of "ascension" to a new
plane. It is also. then, the sound of my freshman year
— and beyond. I say "beyond" because just as first
time "Ascension" listeners come away feeling am
bivalent about what they've heard. I have found my
self in an awkward post-frosh transitional phase, un
sure of how to reconcile progressive inclinations with
doting on the epic experience that was freshman
year. Put simply, i have been in limbo. Put even more
simply, it's kind of sucked.
Yesterday, I resolved to make sense of this situa
tion at Full Moon on the Quad, that monument to
sketchiness. I reasoned that the role of the sopho
more in l ull Moon is a microcosm of Sophomore
Slump Syndrome (SSS). in lhat there is a lack of clar
ity, direction, identity, purpose. For the freshman and
the senior, the situation is simple:'lTie freshman must
kiss a senior if he or she is to become a "true fresh
man." and the senior, when not kissing a freshman,
must march around in a circle chanting."Fresh meat,
fresh meat, ooga-ooga-ooga." stopping only to wipe
the drool from his or her mouth. (Fine,so I made that
part up.) For the sophomore, and to some extent the
junior, and to some extent that 70-year-old man with
the missing teeth claiming he's an I MUM major, the
proverbial lines are fuzzier, which, as I discovered
Saturday night Sunday morning, is not necessarily a
bad thing.
My sophomore friends and I arrived at the pre
event show fashionably late, but I don't think anyone
noticed or cared, let alone thought it fashionable.
Slipping through cracks in the crowd, we oozed our
way to the designated front where we were afforded
a good view of several musical acts, among them the
mighty K. Flay. I couldn't understand a word she was
saying, but was impressed b\ her energy and breath
control. Taking stock of my surroundings in the main
Quad. I noticed some ot my friends were looking
rather unengaged.
"YVi IA I S I P? " I asked over crashing drums.
"WHOOM ABDH GIF," one responded.
"I CANT UNDERS TAND YOU." I yelled.
"GWOOMF AWGII NAWFT." he assured me.
"OH." I replied. "OK."
I began wondering why we even came.
Certainly my desire to sort out this sophomore
slump business sat at the front of my mind. But what
about "'The Group"? Why did we. a collection of dif
ferent people with different interests, decide to band
together and share this experience? Was it for the
kissing? We had all agreed we were not actively seek
ing it (that's code tor "We were prepared to go home
sad and alone"). Was it the music? I"he music was
tine, but really.does anyone attend l ull Moon for the
music? Was it a lack of better things to do? That like
ly played some role, but even that didn't seem to
equate with this need to go that so many people feel
this time every year.
'ITie nature of this X factor remained unclear to me
until about halfway through K. Flay's performance,
when familiar faces began materializing out of the
ether. One. then two. then three and four and five and
six — before I knew it. 1 was surrounded by people I
had seen every day of freshman year. Our exchanges
were unintelligible, our mannerisms flamboyant, our
collective reason for being there now boneheadedly
obvious: We went there to be there. Being there. Being
there in the company of others, in the middle of some
thing bigger than ourselves, embracing the idiosyn
crasies ot university life. That's the source of magic be
hind events like l ull Moon and even, one could argue,
behind the Stanford Experience.
Paradoxically, it seems the Experience and every
thing it entails (academics aside) can only make sense
when one is not trying to make sense of it. ITiankfully, I
realized this just as we hit midnight. A girl politely ap
proached me:
"Are you a freshman?"
: "No."'
"A junior?"
"Nope."
"A senior?"
i> "Hell no!"
"OK. let's do it!"
