# FULL MOON: NOT ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE

### CHRISTINA NGUYEN FMOTQ REPRESENTATIVE FEMALE 
Over dinner the other night, my roommate, Sita,
revealed that she wasn't going to be around on Sat
urday evening.
My RA, Carson, shook his head in disappoint
ment: "It's only the biggest event of the year."
I le was. of course, referring to Full Moon on the
Quad.
The first time I had encountered the event was in
the Unofficial Guide to Stanford, where 1 had imag
ined it as a spectacularly organized ritual — rite of
passage, even — with freshman lined up on one
side of the Quad and seniors on the other, midnight
marking the merging of the lines and 1.6(H) very
happy, very Stanford freshmen.
No, no, no. my RA had told me. All classes go,
some people kiss, some people don't. So my initial
version of 112 ull Moon was gone. Hut in it's place I
had concocted a new. more wild version, and I still
very much looked forward to this Stanford-wide
kissing party ... "The biggest event of the year."
So came Saturday, and 1 must say I was — mild

ly put — mildly disappointed.
Get there .. . huge crowd of people. Some
naked, some naked and painted, some scantily clad.
Some entertainment. Not bad. Stand around for an
hour or so, mingle, people watch. Someone starts
the countdown to midnight. 1 look around. Most
people have on nervous expressions. 1 hear one say,
uneasily. "All right, find your kissing partners."
Midnight! 1 am lucky enough to encounter an
absolutely gorgeous Asian sophomore whose kiss is
an orgasm in my mouth — my boyfriend. We stop
kissing, and I look up. Everyone is kind of just look
ing at each other.The brave ones go for it.The mass
just stand around. Oh, and the Band comes. I"hat
would h;ive been pretty sweet to see, had everyone
not been buttcheek-to-groin trying to push their
way to see them as well.
You're all wrong, you may say. And I may be.
Hell, 1 probably am one of the few who didn't have
a raging good time. I'm a freshman. I'm not way
hot. I wasn't scantily clad. And I wasn't inebriated.
Nonetheless, I figured that Full Moon would have
been — and still think it should be — an event for
the sober, lully clothed, non-way-hot freshman.

Students do the usual at Full Moon on the Quad on Saturday night. Roxy Sass would be proud of these
students diligently practicing her technique.
