# Everybody gets a ride
## 
### 
So you're thinking about riding the vil
lage bicycle. It happens to everybody.
Maybe you don't have the patience to
get your own bicycle. Maybe you like the
freedom that comes with the village bicycle:
You can ride it as far as you want, for as long
as you want, and then when you get tired of
it, you can throw it out on the street. Then
again, maybe you've never owned a bicycle,
and you'd like to get some practice riding
one before you get your own. Our grandpar
ents frowned on such things, but this is the
modern age, after all.
What's nice about the village bicycle is
that you don't need to treat it as nicely as
you'd treat other bicycles. For one thing, you
don't need to be exclusive. The village bicy
cle won't mind if you occasionally ride an
other bicycle. And you can do all those crazy
things you would never do with your own
valuable bicycle. You can ride it on the
beach, or on the floor. You can even ride two
bicycles at once.That would be crazy.
But you start thinking it over. An awful
lot of guys have ridden that village bicycle.
Who knows what kind of stuff you'll find on
the handlebars. The seat looks a bit loose.
The wheels have gotten all flabby with age. Is
that rust contagious?
Then again,you don't want the village bi
cycle because it's pretty. You want it because
it's there; it's easy.practically begging you to
hop on.
Just how does the village bicycle become
the village bicycle? Who is the tirst one to
ride it? Is it an impulse buy, instantly regret
ted and tossed aside on the street like com
mon trash, out there where anybody can
have it? Maybe it was some guy's first bicy
cle, and all it took was a couple of days to fig
ure out he was looking for something differ
ent. Or maybe this guy was a pro. Maybe he
picked up the brand-new bicycle and
showed it the ropes. Did he lose it by acci
dent. or did the village bicycle get tired of
him?
Who knows, maybe this village bicycle
could be more than just another village bi
cycle. Maybe you'll want to do more than
just ride it. Sure, its handlebars are a bit
droopy; sure, its pedals wheeze a bit from
years of hard living. But after all, you're a
Unique person. You don't want one of those

shiny new bicycles you see out in White
Plaza, glistening in the sun with their tall
thin frames. You want a bicycle with some
character. You want a bicycle that'll ride
you, occasionally-
After all, when you get right down to it,
isn't every bicycle a village bicycle? Nobody
ever buys their bikes brand new — unless
they want it to get stolen. Sure, some people
find themselves a bicycle the first day of
freshman year and then ride it for life. But
that's rare. Most of us go from one used bicy
cle to the next. We leave some marks on each
of our bicycles, and they leave a few marks
on us.
But hold on now. son. Let's think this
through. Even if you really did love the vil
lage bicycle — and not just love how long
you can ride it, I mean real love — it would
never really be your bicycle. Your buddies,
the ones who rode it before — what would
they think? Hell, what would you think?
What if every time you hopped on and start
ed riding,you were thinking about when Bill
had his ride, or Jesse, or Sean or Al? What if
the village bicycle was thinking of them,
too?
It's too much trouble, you think, riding
that old bicycle. You'd better just walk for
now. Further on you'll find a good deal,
maybe a used bike that's like new, or
maybe even a pretty young thing made up
with bright colors that still rides nice and
tight.
And then you get really drunk and you
sleep with the village bicycle. It happens to
everybody. Ibat's why it's the village bicy
cle.
