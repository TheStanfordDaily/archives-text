# Spoiled brats

Prejudice is a killer. As far back as 1 care
to study history, people have been
burned.gassed, shot and generally trod
den on for no other reason than a vague incli
nation.
Of course, since we're all good liberals
(well, most of us), such petty discrimination
is beneath us. We pass no judgements based
011 color or creed. Tolerance is regarded as
among the most virtuous of our virtues, and
should one fail in its implementation prepare
to be, erm, well, judged.
Needless to say, taking this broad-mind
edness too far is frowned upon. I mean, it's
okay to irrationally hate Republicans. And,
you know, while all religions are deserving of
our respect (and sympathy â€” poor, deluded
souls). Christians are occasionally evil.
The lists of exceptions to the "no preju
dice" rule is long. There are many stereo
types which are okay to believe (those want
ing a complete list should check out the "In
ternets"). but for today we're going to focus
on one: Stanford Undergraduates = Spoiled
and Over-Privileged.
Now, this is not a universal opinion. Nor, 1
suppose, is it common amongst undergradu
ates (though 1 imagine some have used rela
tive poverty to occasionally win an argu
ment). However, within the graduate student
population. I think at least one person holds
this view, which is enough for me to make
sweeping generalizations.
All grad students hate undergrads. We de
spise your youth (especially that whole
healthy vigor thing).The fact you apparently
have fun, get drunk and occasionally touch
members of the opposite sex are all reasons

for deep resentment. However, nothing irks
us quite so much as the fact that you're all bil
lionaires.
Each and every one of you was nurtured
from birth by a team of dedicated nurses, tu
tors and handmaidens in order to prepare
you for your role as an acolyte of the Farm.
A silver spoon was carefully inserted in
each of your mouths at birth, and it has
stayed there ever since (other than, obvious
ly. during occasional cleanings to maintain
the appropriate gleam of status).
You are the golden boys and girls of the
Golden State. Literally blessed by the Gods
(which don't exist, so that's even more im
pressive). everything you ever wanted was
delivered to you wrapped in gold leaf and
perfumed with frankincense and myrrh.
Nothing bad has ever happened to you.
l"he unfortunate washes off you like dirt
from the downtrodden. You exist to solve
problems, not to experience them.
All of these advantages do, however, have
some untoward consequences. Primary
among these is the fact that on the rare occa
sions you receive a setback, you don't always
take it well.
In our role as educators (a thankless but

noble task which we only undertake for the
general betterment of mankind), graduate
student TAs are often forced to hand out
lower than expected grades. Such castigation
is, of course, alien to most you, so occasional
ly you might complain.
Since there is absolutely no chance that
your complaint is valid, your TA is forced to
conclude that your spoiled upbringing is be
hind the grade tantrum. And so a foundation
for the edifice of prejudice is laid.
Other notable bricks in the wall include
collective whining at your workloads, having
fun instead of working and the pervading
stench of entitlement found in many of The
Daily's op-ed columns.
On the subject of entitlement, it is. hopeful
ly, now entirely clear why the entire graduate
student population is entitled to complain.
None of us have had any advantages in
life. No graduate student drives a BMW or
vacations in the Caribbean. Instead we are
all living on the edge of poverty, hardly able
to scrape together enough for more than one
ski trip a year. And above all else, we're here
through hard graft alone, not as a result of
our lofty place in society or our gilded pasts.
How to finish? Well. 1 suppose all I can do
is to urge my peers to continue in their en
tirely justified discrimination whilst simulta
neously insisting that our younger, shinier
counterparts give up their worldly posses
sions and try suffering a little.

Annoyed? Feel free to run me over in your
BMW. Alternatively, send complaints to
navins@stanford.edu, where they will ad
dressed with an appropriate level of contempt.
