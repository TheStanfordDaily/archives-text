In yesterday's paper, Daily
columnist Peter Durning
wrote of the recent death of
Russian journalist Anna
Stepanovna Politkovskaya ("A
Red October"). Politkovskaya,
who spent her career exposing
corruption in the Soviet and
Russian governments, was
found murdered in her Moscow
apartment. Readers reacted:

Soon, 1 fear, even those whose chief
weapon is the pen must pick up arms to de
fend themselves and freedom, awaiting a
future day when the written word will again
carry the strength of the sword.

Our reporters and even citizens report
ing the truth are being struck back here in
America. If you report a crime by a politi
cian or any official, there is a consorted ef
fort to hide it. If you remain steadfast in your
effort to bring it to an authority's attention

and demand action, then you likely may face
the same fate as Anna.Tlie only thing is. you
weren't world renowned and no one ties
your demise or death to whom you report
ed. If you "tie" your own suffering of harass
ment or persecution to these criminals, you
better have proof, otherwise people think
you're insane. We still live in the "Sure, we
get all the information and it's all truth"
world. Not so! We get what the White House
allows and most of it is lies. How difficult it is
to report this in America right now. We are
threatened with being called terrorists if we
do so. I 'm sad to say that America is just like
Russia these days. If you think not, try to go
to Guantanamo and write a book.

How very sad for all of us in the free
world. An outstanding journalist who loved
her country enough to put her life at risk, we
should all be so brave. God bless her forever

Peter, thanks for the article. Sandra, I'm
terribly sorry that you have allowed your
self to believe such untruths about your
country. Journalists in the U.S. are not in
fear of being shot. Many of them are in fear
of not having a job if they don't write arti
cles that people read, but that is a very dif

ferent proposition than fearing for your life.

Solzhenitsyn, Rushdie, among others
have had the right idea to slip into the banned
books abyss. Should all writers travel the
same hidden path in a search for freedom of
speech — even where it is not so free?

Sandra's vision of the U.S. seems overly
bleak — though we certainly have major
issues under the current administration.

Both author and most respondents are
making a trivial mistake: judging other cul
tures based on their own values. No wonder
life in Russia would not make sense to you.
Statements like "educated. Westward-lean
ing Russians" are very disrespectful of
Russian culture. However. I agree that what
happened is a tragedy Just like the tragedy
of Iraqis that are killed every day or those
people of different origins that are tortured

ii c
in CIA prisons every day.
