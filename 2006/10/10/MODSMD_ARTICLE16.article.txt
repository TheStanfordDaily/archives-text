## NFL blackout blunder 
### 
I've never been able to explain why,
hut for some reason or another,
I've always hated the San Francis
co 49ers.
Perhaps it's the squad's connection
to Candlestick Park — a venue that
once played home to the Dodgers'
wretched, Halloween-flavored rival.
Maybe it's their sheer inability to
string together a winning season late
ly, or possibly even just the fact that
they reside in the barren wasteland
that is Northern California.
Whatever the case, this past Sun
day I finally found some solid justifica
tion for my dislike of the NFC's bot
tom-dwelling squad.
For months 1 had been looking for
ward to the over-hyped Cowbovs-Fa
glesgame in which Dallas wide receiv
er Terrell Owens would return to
Philadelphia — his first time since
parting ways with Andy Reid's squad
last season. We all knew this match-up
would be one for the ages, and for
good reason.
Donnovan McNabb remains in the
midst of an MVP-like season, surpass
ing everyone's expectations after
missing the latter part of last season
due to injury. The lively Eagles' faith
ful were eager to receive Owens with
a good oP Philly welcome — not to
mention the fact that the Eagles and
Cowboys entered the contest ranked
first and second, respectively, in the
NFC East.
Yep. it was supposed to be a good
Sunday. And with my Dodgers
knocked out of the MLB playoffs just
a night earlier, 1 really needed the
comfort that could only be provided
by a nice, old-fashioned NFL slobber
knocker.
But as 1 Hipped the channel over to
FOX, all I could see was some old
episode of "Star Trek."" WTF, mate?"

Lomeli
The SoCal Bias
And I lien 1 saw the vile words gracing the bottom
of the scieen:"l)ue to NI L regulations, the Cow
boys-Eagles game has been blacked-out in this
market."
"WTF.mate?!"
"WTF.MATE?!!!"
Ves. it appeared that my weekend-long streak
of failure would continue through Sunday. First
the Dodgers. ITien l ull Moon on the Quad. And
now this.
Per the NFL blackout rule that went into ef
fect in I l ' •>.a channel without broadcast rights to
the market s home team cannot air another NFL
game at the same time the home team's game is
broadcast on another network, in other words,
because the less-than-epic 49ers-Raiders game
was shown on CBS at the same time, the NFL
prohibited I OX from broadcasting their "Game
of the Year."
I he NI L argues this rule simply encourages
fans to cheer on teams from their market. Funny,
the way I see it is that the NIL is forcing fans to
cheer on their market.
I in blessed to be from I ,os Angeles, where the
NI L provides us with each week's best games.
Apparently. Angelinos get access to each game
because we don't have a professional team;
though, contrary to popular belief, we do in fact
have a team called the I JSC Trojans— who just
happen to he more of a pro team than both the
Niners and the Raiders.

It's ridiculous to think that if I had grown up
as an Indianapolis Colts fan and found myself liv
ing in the Bay Area, 1 would be unable to watch
my squad, despite their appearance on national
television.
And chances are, I'm not the only relocated
football fan impacted by these absurd regula
tions. All throughout the country are fans of the
Packers, Cowboys and Steelers who would need
to purchase a special cable or satellite TV pack
age to watch games to which they were original
ly entitled.
There's a reason football is the nation's most
watched sport. The NFL is at the forefront of
sports management.The league just seems to get
what Americans want and then deliver with qual
ity entertainment. But this whole blackout rule is
just ridiculous.
I'm certain there were tons of people eager to
watch the "Battle of the Bay" on Sunday. But
then there were also people like me — fans who
wanted to see a real football game. Loyal Niner
and Raider fans alike would have watched their
game no matter what other matches were avail
able at the same time,so there's no sense making
the rest of us suffer.

Andrew Lomeli is depressed. What else would you
expect after the Dodgers looked liken Little League
team against the Mets last week. Mock him at
