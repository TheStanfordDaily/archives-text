## NFL blackout blunder 
### 
I've never been able to explain why,
hut for some reason or another,
I've always hated the San Francis
co 49ers.
Perhaps it's the squad's connection
to Candlestick Park — a venue that
once played home to the Dodgers'
wretched, Halloween-flavored rival.
Maybe it's their sheer inability to
string together a winning season late
ly, or possibly even just the fact that
they reside in the barren wasteland
that is Northern California.
Whatever the case, this past Sun
day I finally found some solid justifica
tion for my dislike of the NFC's bot
tom-dwelling squad.
For months 1 had been looking for
ward to the over-hyped Cowbovs-Fa
glesgame in which Dallas wide receiv
er Terrell Owens would return to
Philadelphia — his first time since
parting ways with Andy Reid's squad
last season. We all knew this match-up
would be one for the ages, and for
good reason.
Donnovan McNabb remains in the
midst of an MVP-like season, surpass
ing everyone's expectations after
missing the latter part of last season
due to injury. The lively Eagles' faith
ful were eager to receive Owens with
a good oP Philly welcome — not to
mention the fact that the Eagles and
Cowboys entered the contest ranked
first and second, respectively, in the
NFC East.
Yep. it was supposed to be a good
Sunday. And with my Dodgers
knocked out of the MLB playoffs just
a night earlier, 1 really needed the
comfort that could only be provided
by a nice, old-fashioned NFL slobber
knocker.
But as 1 Hipped the channel over to
FOX, all I could see was some old
episode of "Star Trek."" WTF, mate?"
