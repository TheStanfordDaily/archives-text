### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although there was no Stan
ford showdown in the singles fi
nals this year, the Cardinal were
well represented at last week
end's Bronco Classic in Santa
Clara, Calif. One Stanford player

earned a spot in the finals of his draw:
two players and one doubles pair lost to

the eventual champions of their respective
draws; and one doubles pair fell to the top-seeded
tandem in the semifinals.
In 2005, junior Phil Kao defeated fellow Cardi
nal sophomore Blake Muller in straight sets in the
finals of the "A-flight." Neither Muller nor Kao
competed in the tournament this year, but the six
Stanford players who did participate proved suc

season.

thinks they re playing great, but we're not really so
concerned about our wins and losses in this tourna
ment We're |ust trying to see where everyone's at
and what everyone needs to work on."

the first three in straight sets — to advance to the
finals of the' B flight' draw. Rasmussen then fell to
Santa ('lara's Jay Wong in a 6-2,6-4 defeat on Sun

ic like attempts from the Cardinal, the lefty Bron
co came up with enough passing shots and baseline
winners to defeat Rasmussen.
