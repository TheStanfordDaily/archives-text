# Card rackets tied up by brackets
## Men's tennis fails to advance to top of Bronco Classic, but individuals, pairs make their claim in consolation 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although there was no Stan
ford showdown in the singles fi
nals this year, the Cardinal were
well represented at last week
end's Bronco Classic in Santa
Clara, Calif. One Stanford player

earned a spot in the finals of his draw:
two players and one doubles pair lost to

the eventual champions of their respective
draws; and one doubles pair fell to the top-seeded
tandem in the semifinals.
In 2005, junior Phil Kao defeated fellow Cardi
nal sophomore Blake Muller in straight sets in the
finals of the "A-flight." Neither Muller nor Kao
competed in the tournament this year, but the six
Stanford players who did participate proved suc
cessful in one of the opening tournaments of the
season.
"1 think we did okay for our first tournament."
senior Dave Ryan said. "1 don't think everyone

thinks they re playing great, but we're not really so
concerned about our wins and losses in this tourna
ment We're |ust trying to see where everyone's at
and what everyone needs to work on."
Junior Chris Rasmussen won five matches —
the first three in straight sets — to advance to the
finals of the' B flight' draw. Rasmussen then fell to
Santa ('lara's Jay Wong in a 6-2,6-4 defeat on Sun
das afternoon. Despite a good effort and acrobat
ic like attempts from the Cardinal, the lefty Bron
co came up with enough passing shots and baseline
winners to defeat Rasmussen.
Senior 1 ric Mckean competed in the 'A-flight'
draw and won his first-round match in straight sets
before falling to the eventual champion, Washing
ton's Andy kuharsky, in three sets. Mckean was
down 2-5 in the first set and came back to pick up
the first in a tiebreaker, 7-3. However, kuharsky
rallied to win the second and third sets.
Ryan also lost to the eventual champion of his
draw. Ihe senior competed in the 'C-flight' draw
