# KNIGHT FELLOWSHIP
## Yahoo! grant draws scrutiny Fellows debate if benefits of grant outweigh moral concerns 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
After Yahoo! turned over information
about Internet search records to the Chi
nese government that led to the arrests of
journalists in 2004, protests arose from the
international media and the U.S. Congress.
So last month, when Yahoo! offered and
Stanford accepted a $1 million gift for the
University's Knight Fellowship program
to support press freedom in what many
saw as an act of atonement, some critics
worried the money came from a tainted
source.
A barrage of emails ensued as past
Knight Fellows from around the world
wrestled with an ethical dilemma. The de
bate over the donation has largely died
down, and the program's administrator
says it is keeping the money, but the argu
ment has become a symbol of constraints
on press freedom abroad.
"I have accepted this fellowship be-

cause
I know

there are no strings attached to it
from Yahoo!," said Imtiaz Ali. the first

Yahoo! International Fellow, a BBC re
porter based in Pakistan, in an email. "If
the Yahoo! money provides an invaluable
opportunity to one journalist to learn
more, it's not a bad deal."
James Bettinger, director of the Knight
Fellowships, told The Daily that program
administrators were cognizant of the
Yahoo! and China controversy when they
deliberated on whether to accept the gift.
"It served a need in our program, which

is to provide stable funding
for international fellows,"
he said."lt left the selection
process entirely up to us.
We thought this was a good

thing."
The email exchange
prompted an article in the

San Francisco Chronicle, a piece on Na
tional Public Radio's Morning Edition and
posts on a prominent journalism blog.
The Knight Fellowship program counts
some of the nation's most distinguished
journalists as alumni.
Kevin Fagan, a current fellow and San
Francisco Chronicle reporter, said news

papers frequently print ads from morally
questionable entities, such as cigarette and
alcohol manufacturers.
"It certainly is a conversation worth hav
ing, but I didn't see any question about tak
ing the money from the get-go," he said.
The Knight Fellowship program, one of
the most esteemed in journalism, brings

selected journalists to

r j
the University every year to
collaborate and to study. Fel-

lows are typically reporters who

are midway in their careers.
Journalists in countries with restricted

press freedom will receive the new inter
national fellowship, funded to l.ist 10
years.
Ali said that constraints on press free
dom remain an issue of concern through
the developing world.
"Three of my journalist friends have
been killed just in the last two years in the
line of their duties," he wrote in an email to
The Daily."l know how difficult the life of

their widows and children is
now."
China's record on
human rights has come under
fire after recent crackdowns. An

August Human Rights Watch re
port outlined how user informa

tion from Yahoo! has allowed the
Chinese to crack down on journalists who
had written or posted pro-democrac\ arti
cles.
An alumni email list had rarely been
used until the Knight Fellowship program

made the announcement on Sept. 18.
Ihe dormant list exploded with de
hate, with a sizable majority of
posters in support of accepting the
grant.
International journalists were
more likely to support accepting the
donation, Fagan said, because they
have seen firsthand the conse
quences of government intimida
tion.
"They seemed to feel most
strongly about it."he said. "You
would think they would feel feistier
about this, but they were saying
there's no question and we'll take
what we can get."
But turning down the gift was not

on the table, Bettinger said.
Yahoo! Co-founder Jerry Yang
said that his company was commit
ted to supporting "open access to in
formation on a global basis."
"We hope that fellows visiting
from press-restrictive nations will
have the opportunity to bring
change and enlightenment to their
home countries," he said in the state
ment announcing the gift.
Still, some former fellows, like re
tired Eugene, Ore. Register-Guard
reporter Don Bishoff, believed that
taking the money sent the wrong
message.
"For me. the underlying principle
is that it is from a company that was
complicit in fingering a dissident.'
Bishoff told the San Francisco
Chronicle.
But Srinija Srinivasan. Yahoo!'s
editor in chief, told The New York
Times that while Yahoo! was "pro

foundly distressed by the arrest" of
Shi. the endowment was "not about
regret."
Bettinger said it was good news
that a prominent Internet company
was taking a more active role in jour
nalism education.
"This is, to my knowledge, the
first instance of any of the Internet
news providers making a contribu
tion to this program or similar jour
nalism programs," he said. "We
think it is appropriate for compa
nies like this to take responsibility
for the improvement of journal
ism."
Ali. the recipient of the Yahoo!
gift, said he was excited for the
chance to study at Stanford and
pledged that he "will always stand by
my fellow journalists who face op
pression anywhere in the world, no
matter whoever is the oppressor or
helper in his or her suppression."
