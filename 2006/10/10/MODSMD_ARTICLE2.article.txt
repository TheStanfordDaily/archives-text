# KNIGHT FELLOWSHIP
## Yahoo! grant draws scrutiny Fellows debate if benefits of grant outweigh moral concerns 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
After Yahoo! turned over information
about Internet search records to the Chi
nese government that led to the arrests of
journalists in 2004, protests arose from the
international media and the U.S. Congress.
So last month, when Yahoo! offered and
Stanford accepted a $1 million gift for the
University's Knight Fellowship program
to support press freedom in what many
saw as an act of atonement, some critics
worried the money came from a tainted
source.
A barrage of emails ensued as past
Knight Fellows from around the world
wrestled with an ethical dilemma. The de
bate over the donation has largely died
down, and the program's administrator
says it is keeping the money, but the argu
ment has become a symbol of constraints
on press freedom abroad.
"I have accepted this fellowship be-

cause
I know

there are no strings attached to it
from Yahoo!," said Imtiaz Ali. the first

Yahoo! International Fellow, a BBC re
porter based in Pakistan, in an email. "If
the Yahoo! money provides an invaluable
opportunity to one journalist to learn
more, it's not a bad deal."
James Bettinger, director of the Knight
Fellowships, told The Daily that program
administrators were cognizant of the
Yahoo! and China controversy when they
deliberated on whether to accept the gift.
"It served a need in our program, which

is to provide stable funding
for international fellows,"
he said."lt left the selection
process entirely up to us.
We thought this was a good

thing."
The email exchange
prompted an article in the

San Francisco Chronicle, a piece on Na
tional Public Radio's Morning Edition and
posts on a prominent journalism blog.
The Knight Fellowship program counts
some of the nation's most distinguished
journalists as alumni.
Kevin Fagan, a current fellow and San
Francisco Chronicle reporter, said news

papers frequently print ads from morally
questionable entities, such as cigarette and
alcohol manufacturers.
"It certainly is a conversation worth hav
ing, but I didn't see any question about tak
ing the money from the get-go," he said.
The Knight Fellowship program, one of
the most esteemed in journalism, brings

selected journalists to

r j
the University every year to
collaborate and to study. Fel-

lows are typically reporters who

are midway in their careers.
Journalists in countries with restricted

press freedom will receive the new inter
national fellowship, funded to l.ist 10
years.
Ali said that constraints on press free
dom remain an issue of concern through
the developing world.
"Three of my journalist friends have
been killed just in the last two years in the
line of their duties," he wrote in an email to
The Daily."l know how difficult the life of

their widows and children is
now."
China's record on
human rights has come under
fire after recent crackdowns. An

August Human Rights Watch re
port outlined how user informa

tion from Yahoo! has allowed the
Chinese to crack down on journalists who
had written or posted pro-democrac\ arti
cles.
An alumni email list had rarely been
used until the Knight Fellowship program
