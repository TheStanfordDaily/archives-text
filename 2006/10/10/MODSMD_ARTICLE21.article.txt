of two good weeks of training, and the goals
were a result of us playing well as a team,"
Thompson said. "We moved the ball well
and kept possession. We played well from
the back and finished our chances."
While the Cardinal were outshot 19-8,
a stellar nine-save performance by fresh
man goalkeeper John Moore helped to
keep Washington scoreless. The game in

"I definitely felt like [my per

my position on the team," Moore
said. "As a freshman, you need to
earn your way — it's not just given
to you."
