## Hollywood to chronicle life and death of Pearl 
### DAVID HERBERT MANAGING EDITOR 
HBO draws the curtains tonight on a documentary that
follows the life and death of Wall Street Journal reporter
and Stanford alumnus Daniel Pearl, exploring how he and
his captor, Omar Sheikh, came from similar backgrounds
and end up leading such radically different lives that would
eventually, and tragically, intertwine.
"The Journalist and the Jihadi — I"he Murder of
Daniel Pearl" is the work of Pakistani-born Ahmed Jamal
and Indian Ramesh Sharma, filmmakers who said they
were drawn to the story in large part because of Pearl's en

during legacy as a voice for cross-cultural understanding.
"Even people in Pakistan who don't like America ad
mire Daniel Pearl personally." Jamal said.
This respect actually hindered the filmmakers' inter
views with Pakistanis who. Jamal said, were embarrassed
by the murder and were reluctant to go on camera.
But Sharma said that juxtaposing Pearl's life — from
his childhood in California to his investigation of the mili
tant Islamic underground that led to his 2002 murder — to
the similarly well-educated and affluent Sheikh was a par
allel begging to be explored.
"Both of them thought they were changing the world in
their own way," Sharma said. "Any filmmaker worth his

salt would be interested in this kind of documentary."
In making the film. Jamal and Sharma met with Pearl's
parents, Judea and Ruth Pearl, three times, gaining access
to family home videos and photographs that shed new
light on the journalist's youth.
The Pearls have hardly shied away from their son's
legacy: to the contrary, they founded the Daniel Pearl
Foundation after his death to spread his vision of interfaith
dialogue through music and journalism programs. Still.
Ruth Pearl acknowledged that sharing her son with the
filmmakers was not easy.
