## Hollywood to chronicle life and death of Pearl 
### DAVID HERBERT MANAGING EDITOR 
HBO draws the curtains tonight on a documentary that
follows the life and death of Wall Street Journal reporter
and Stanford alumnus Daniel Pearl, exploring how he and
his captor, Omar Sheikh, came from similar backgrounds
and end up leading such radically different lives that would
eventually, and tragically, intertwine.
"The Journalist and the Jihadi — I"he Murder of
Daniel Pearl" is the work of Pakistani-born Ahmed Jamal
and Indian Ramesh Sharma, filmmakers who said they
were drawn to the story in large part because of Pearl's en

during legacy as a voice for cross-cultural understanding.
"Even people in Pakistan who don't like America ad
mire Daniel Pearl personally." Jamal said.
This respect actually hindered the filmmakers' inter
views with Pakistanis who. Jamal said, were embarrassed
by the murder and were reluctant to go on camera.
But Sharma said that juxtaposing Pearl's life — from
his childhood in California to his investigation of the mili
tant Islamic underground that led to his 2002 murder — to
the similarly well-educated and affluent Sheikh was a par
allel begging to be explored.
"Both of them thought they were changing the world in
their own way," Sharma said. "Any filmmaker worth his

salt would be interested in this kind of documentary."
In making the film. Jamal and Sharma met with Pearl's
parents, Judea and Ruth Pearl, three times, gaining access
to family home videos and photographs that shed new
light on the journalist's youth.
The Pearls have hardly shied away from their son's
legacy: to the contrary, they founded the Daniel Pearl
Foundation after his death to spread his vision of interfaith
dialogue through music and journalism programs. Still.
Ruth Pearl acknowledged that sharing her son with the
filmmakers was not easy.
"It is difficult to view the movie,"
she told The Daily. "But at the same
time, the story needed to be told even
when difficult."
Her husband, Judea Pearl,
agreed that it was a good film and
one worth making, but added his
son's legacy might have called for a
different ending.
"I would have ended it on a more
positive note. " he said, suggesting that
it conclude with Beethoven's Sym
phony No. c ). ''I'lTie symphony] is an
outburst of hope and togetherness,
and this was Danny's claim to fame."
Hie 11 BO special is the first major
film on Pearl's life, but others will fol
low shortly after. I'vvo Hollywood
pictures are already in production,
one based on a memoir by Pearl's
widow Mariana and starring Angeli
na J(>lie,and another.fictionalized ac
count adapted from Bernard Henri
Levi's book "Who Killed Daniel
Pearl?"
Jamal dismissed the rival films.

"1 think they basically copied our
documentary," he said. "We're com
ing first, and those are based on
books that are written earlier, and
we've got new information."
For their part, the Pearls said they
hope that the new film will comple
ment the Foundation's work, efforts
that Judea Pearl said have already
sparked changes.
"We are seeing people in the Mus
lim world stepping up and saying no
to extremism," he said.
In addition to the successful

cluding one in Memorial Church last
Thursday) and journalism programs

What really matters is

mat Akbar Ahmed, in which the two
discuss Jewish-Muslim relations be

But Judea Pearl said collecting acco
lades was not his goal.
"It is comforting to know that our
efforts have generated so many posi
tive responses," he said." But what re
ally matters is by what means and to
