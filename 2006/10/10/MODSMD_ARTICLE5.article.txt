# New man in the Haas
## New Director Garcia to push students into public-service jobs, encourage service-learning on the Farm 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In Dr. Gabriel Garcia's ideal world, every stu
dent at Stanford would incorporate some sort of
public service work into his University education.
It is with this goal in mind that Garcia assumed
the position of faculty director of the 1 laas Center
for Public Service in September, succeeding Prof.
I.en Ortolano.This year, he will lead the 1 laas Cen
ter in guiding students toward careers in the public
service sector.
"The job w as a good fit for me," said Garcia, a
professor of medicine and associate dean of admis
sions at the Medical School."This is an amazing or
ganization."
His involvement at the Haas Center began in
1998 with his service on the Faculty Steering Com
mittee. The experience prompted Garcia to devel
op his sophomore seminar, "The Human Side of
Medicine," into a service-learning course. He also
served as faculty advisor for two Alternative Spring
Break trips.
"Little by little, I espoused the idea that I could
embrace experiential learning," Garcia said. "The
only way that one truly understands the way an in
dividual experiences different health and disease
states is through one-on-one interactions. You can't
read it in a book."
Hie 2004 creation of Garcia's position exempli
fies this aim to connect students' academic experi
ences with public service.
" Hie idea ol having a faculty di
rector is to embrace the dual re
sponsibility of the Center: to en
gage students in public service and
civic society and to align the mis
sion of the Center with the mission
of the University," Garcia said.
"The faculty director ensures that
our programs serve the dual mis
sions of the Center, and 1 take that
very seriously."
Suzanne Abel, director of exter
nal relations at the Haas Center,
added that the Center benefits from
the leadership of faculty members
by allowing their different perspec
tives. academic expertise and net
works to better inform the Center's
programs.
I his year, Garcia hopes to forge a
close relationship between the Haas
Center and the Career Develop
ment Center to ensure that students
have opportunities to pursue ca
reers in public service.
Its a great challenge, but one
we very much want to embrace," he
said.

The Haas Center recently sur
veyed 8,000 alumni involved in the
Center during their time at Stan
ford. Of the 25 percent who re
turned the surveys, seven in 10 ex
pressed interest in better connect
ing undergraduates to service.
"This is phenomenal." said
Nicole Taylor, managing director of
the Center. "It opens the resources
we have available for students."
Garcia and his staff will focus on
finding ways to take advantage of
these alumni through advising and
mentoring.
"We've really never had a formal
alumni program, but having done
this survey it's really clear to us that
they're a tremendous asset," Abel
said. "Postgraduate priority has re
ally come to the fore and alumni are
major assets in terms of opening up
doors for our graduating students."
Engaging students in a lifelong
commitment to service was central
to Garcia's vision.
"I want service to be an integral
part of students' education at all

levels, so that it doesn't end in grad
uate school or even with postgrad
uate students," he said. "I want
there to be a facilitated transition
between the service that you do
here and the service that you do
with whatever career you choose.
We believe that is a good outcome
for a graduate."
As for a possible mandatory
service requirement for graduation,
Garcia said that it was a curricular
issue that would probably left to in
dividual programs.
"We're working with many pro
grams this year who are very inter
ested in establishing required cours
es in service-learning,and we will fa
cilitate those," he said. "It's clear
that that 's part of the mission of our
school."
Garcia said that additional con
versations will assess the feasibility
of making a service-learning re
quirement University-wide.
"I think that's a discussion," he
said, "to be had with all the stake
holders."
