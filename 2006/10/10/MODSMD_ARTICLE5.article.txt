# New man in the Haas
## New Director Garcia to push students into public-service jobs, encourage service-learning on the Farm 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In Dr. Gabriel Garcia's ideal world, every stu
dent at Stanford would incorporate some sort of
public service work into his University education.
It is with this goal in mind that Garcia assumed
the position of faculty director of the 1 laas Center
for Public Service in September, succeeding Prof.
I.en Ortolano.This year, he will lead the 1 laas Cen
ter in guiding students toward careers in the public
service sector.
"The job w as a good fit for me," said Garcia, a
professor of medicine and associate dean of admis
sions at the Medical School."This is an amazing or
ganization."
His involvement at the Haas Center began in
1998 with his service on the Faculty Steering Com
mittee. The experience prompted Garcia to devel
op his sophomore seminar, "The Human Side of
Medicine," into a service-learning course. He also
served as faculty advisor for two Alternative Spring
Break trips.
"Little by little, I espoused the idea that I could
embrace experiential learning," Garcia said. "The
only way that one truly understands the way an in
dividual experiences different health and disease
states is through one-on-one interactions. You can't
read it in a book."
Hie 2004 creation of Garcia's position exempli
fies this aim to connect students' academic experi
ences with public service.
