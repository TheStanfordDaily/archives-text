## Law School's switch draws student debate School's change to quarter system not to take full effect until 2009 
### ADAM SOWLATI 
Students at the Law School will soon be grap
pling with a schedule enjoyed by many Stanford un
dergraduates: the quarter system.
After decades on the semester system, Stanford
I ,aw School is modifying its schedule this year in an
ticipation of a move to the quarter system in 2009.
Iliis year's modified semester system moves
first-year law students' first-semester exams to be
fore winter break.This allows theii second semester
to begin at the same time as the University's winter
quarter, allowing these students to take winter quar
ter classes in other departments. The year will still
end at the beginning of May.
"I do think it's a good idea because I do think it's
true that the Law School feels disjointed from the
University," said first-year Law School student
Whitney Sado, a 2006 graduate and public editor for
The Daily."lt is a little frustrating that it you want to
take classes within the larger University it gets com
plicated as far as scheduling goes, especially because
law needs to be so much more interdisciplinary than
in past decades. It is important to take courses in
medicine, business, sociology, all those things."
Adopting the quarter system will allow the Law
School to proffer a curriculum different than the tra
ditional law school curi iculum, by allowing students
to take non-legal courses. Furthermore, it will allow
the Law School to otter about 20
joint-degree programs, a difficult
feat under the constrains of the se
mester system.
"The move comes from our de
sire to enable our students to take
more classes outside of the Law
School.' Dean Larry Kramer said.
"For example, as an intellectual
property lawyer, it would be great
to Like courses in computer sci
ence."
Kramer said he also believes the
move will make the second and
thiid years of law school more inter
esting.
Ihc move has not been without
opposition.
Kurd year Law School student
Jenny Allen, a Stanford Daily sen
ioi staff writer, worried that the
switch to the quarter system will
create potential conflicts with in
ternships and hinder preparation
for the bar exam, because the year
will end later.
"One of my friends last year
could not attend graduation in mid-
Mas because he needed to start his
Bar review course in Virginia,"
Allen said "I cannot imagine how
he would have been able to com
plete his liar Review preparation if
he had graduated in mid-June."
While some solely supported the
adoption of the modified semester
system, according to Dean Kramer,
the majority of the faculty is in favor
of the move to the quarter system.
The move has created some
problems. Issues have been found
with registration and credit count
ing. which is part of the reason the
quarter system will not be instated
until 2(X)9.
Additionally.it has been difficult
getting information to Law School
students about classes outside of
the Law School, a problem Kramer
hopes to address by changing the
Law School's culture.
