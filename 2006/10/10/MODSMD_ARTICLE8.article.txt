## Editorial Revising advising 
### 
Every year The Daily, the ASSU and
individual students criticize the Uni
versity s academic advising programs
— especially when it comes to freshman ad
vising. And every year, the problems re
main the same. While Stanford's program is
better than those of many other institu
tions, there is still much room for improve
ment.
Freshman advising should focus on ques
tions such as which PWR section to take,
whether or not to apply for Introductory
Seminars and how many units to take fall
quarter — questions that should be relative
ly easy to answer. But anecdotal evidence,
suggests that many freshmen either receive
little help or are ted incorrect information,
such as this year's mistake of telling fresh
men that Econ IA will onlv be offered in the
fall.
Part of the problem is the division of the
academic advisor role to several different in
dividuals: the HPAC; the Peer Mentor; the
faculty advisor; the academic advising serv
ices in Sweet Hall; and the in-major faculty
advisor. And that's not to discount the "Aca
demic Directors" who work in several
dorms, including Wilbur and Florence
Moore Hall.
This means that within a student's first
two years at Stanford, he or she will probably
interact with at least five different academic
advisors in one form or another.This pletho
ra of resources, each with a different per
spective and specialty, is great in theory. But
in practice, students often feel unsure of
which resource should be their first, and the
advisors either can't answer simple ques
tions or give conflicting responses.
To solve these problems, it seems that the
University's response has been to simply
add more advisors. A more effective solution
would be to empower and better inform
those that currently exist. This way, each stu
dent will have at most two advising re
sources, both of whom will be familiar with
the subtleties of the undergraduate curricu
lum.
The administration could start by im
proving the Peer Mentor program, a highly
underused resource in the advising system.
Having recently gone through the freshman
experience themselves. Peer Mentors seem
to be best equipped to assist freshman in
their transition to Stanford. When it comes
to questions such as what I HUM is most in
teresting, when to take Math 51 and how to
go about fulfilling general education re
quirements, PMs can give freshmen advice
based on their own experiences, as well as
the experiences of their friends and dorm
mates. Th us. even if the PM is a fuzzy and the
freshman a techie (or vice versa), chances
are that the PM will still be able to give help
ful advice.

But in the current system. Peer Mentors
are told not to advise freshmen on what
courses to take, reducing their role to ex
plaining how to use the time schedule and
how to sign up for classes. The University
should empower, rather than marginalize,
this helpful resource, allowing PMs to advise
on questions of greater importance. Grant
ed. the effort level of PMs varies greatly, hut
it is easy to make PM a prestigious position.
Stanford could offer students pay or other
perks that would motivate them to con
tribute in meaningful way to the freshman
advising experience.
This is not to say that the role of the Fac
ulty Advisor should he eliminated or re
duced. But the system does need some im
provements. Assigning a faculty advisor to
each student was an innovation added dur
ing the reforms of Stanford's undergraduate
education during President Casper's tenure.
On the surface, it is a very good idea, giving
students an opportunity to interact with a
faculty member on a one-on-one level from
the very beginning of their freshman year.
But the nuts and bolts of the faculty program
reveal its shortcomings.
Much of the time, students are paired
with an academic advisor from a department
that has no relation to their area of interest.
And more importantly, many faculty advi
sors. while enthusiastic, are woefully under
prepared for the specifics of advising. Unlike
PMs, the majority of faculty advisors have no
first hand experience with Stanford's under
graduate system. Any advice they can offer is
usually based only on training they've re
ceived through the advising program or in
formation they've found on the Stanford
Web site.
There are. of course, some advisors who
have been participating in the program for
many years and are familiar with the system.
Students lucky enough to be assigned to
such advisors will probably get useful and
thorough advice. Other students may be
paired with an advisor whose interests
match their own. While these students may
not receive adequate advice on general
questions, they are likely to benefit from the
experience by receiving guidance on their
specific major. But such cases are, unfortu
nately. rare because the group of faculty ad
visors includes university administrators,
GSB. Law School and Medical School pro
fessors and graduate students, who are usu
ally not familiar with the undergraduate cur
riculum.
It is necessary to ensure that all faculty
advisors are informed of the basics of under
graduate education at Stanford: it is easy for
students to feel disillusioned with picking
courses if the faculty advisor, the one
charged with actually giving advice, cannot
help.

in practice, students often feel unsure of
which resource should be their first, and the
advisors either can't answer simple ques
tions or give conflicting responses.
To solve these problems, it seems that the
University's response has been to simply
add more advisors. A more effective solution
would be to empower and better inform
those that currently exist. This way, each stu
dent will have at most two advising re
sources, both of whom will be familiar with
the subtleties of the undergraduate curricu
lum.
The administration could start by im
proving the Peer Mentor program, a highly
underused resource in the advising system.
Having recently gone through the freshman
experience themselves. Peer Mentors seem
to be best equipped to assist freshman in
their transition to Stanford. When it comes
to questions such as what I HUM is most in
teresting, when to take Math 51 and how to
go about fulfilling general education re
quirements, PMs can give freshmen advice
based on their own experiences, as well as
the experiences of their friends and dorm
mates. Th us. even if the PM is a fuzzy and the
freshman a techie (or vice versa), chances
are that the PM will still be able to give help
ful advice.

But in the current system. Peer Mentors
are told not to advise freshmen on what
courses to take, reducing their role to ex
plaining how to use the time schedule and
how to sign up for classes. The University
should empower, rather than marginalize,
this helpful resource, allowing PMs to advise
on questions of greater importance. Grant
ed. the effort level of PMs varies greatly, hut
it is easy to make PM a prestigious position.
Stanford could offer students pay or other
perks that would motivate them to con
tribute in meaningful way to the freshman
advising experience.
This is not to say that the role of the Fac
ulty Advisor should he eliminated or re
duced. But the system does need some im
provements. Assigning a faculty advisor to
each student was an innovation added dur
ing the reforms of Stanford's undergraduate
education during President Casper's tenure.
On the surface, it is a very good idea, giving
students an opportunity to interact with a
faculty member on a one-on-one level from
the very beginning of their freshman year.
But the nuts and bolts of the faculty program
reveal its shortcomings.
Much of the time, students are paired
with an academic advisor from a department
that has no relation to their area of interest.
And more importantly, many faculty advi
sors. while enthusiastic, are woefully under
prepared for the specifics of advising. Unlike
PMs, the majority of faculty advisors have no
first hand experience with Stanford's under
graduate system. Any advice they can offer is
usually based only on training they've re
ceived through the advising program or in
formation they've found on the Stanford
Web site.
There are. of course, some advisors who
have been participating in the program for
many years and are familiar with the system.
Students lucky enough to be assigned to
such advisors will probably get useful and
thorough advice. Other students may be
paired with an advisor whose interests
match their own. While these students may
not receive adequate advice on general
questions, they are likely to benefit from the
experience by receiving guidance on their
specific major. But such cases are, unfortu
nately. rare because the group of faculty ad
visors includes university administrators,
GSB. Law School and Medical School pro
fessors and graduate students, who are usu
ally not familiar with the undergraduate cur
riculum.
It is necessary to ensure that all faculty
advisors are informed of the basics of under
graduate education at Stanford: it is easy for
students to feel disillusioned with picking
courses if the faculty advisor, the one
charged with actually giving advice, cannot
help.
