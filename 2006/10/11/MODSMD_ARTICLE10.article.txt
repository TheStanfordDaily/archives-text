Service learning deserves support
To service learning — and its soul mate,
civic engagement is the new "case study,"
a fundamentally new paradigm in education.
Ilie gathering momentum to make service a
standard component of education —and a
standard for educational excellence — sig
nals a new era of community involvement by
institutions of higher education. In accepting
a leadership role at the Haas Center, Dr.
Garcia is to he congratulated for joining Le
land and Jane Lathrop Stanford in seeing
that college is not just the door to a prosper
ous future, but also the beginning of, as Dr.
Garcia put it. a "lifelong commitment to
service." President Jimmy Carter has said:
"()ur centers of higher education must teach
students the value of service and how to

work in partnership with their communities
to decrease the gap between those who have
the means and those less fortunate who lack
the means or training to be effective in serv
ing others This community engagement by
our campuses can help reduce the chasm be
tween the rich and the poor by serving as a
tool tor economic development. Higher ed
ucation has the responsibility to train and
serve our young people to become better cit
izens by engaging them in academic commu
nity civic programs." Stanford. Dr. Garcia
and the I laas C enter are taking a position at
the crest of this new wave of service learning,
and deserve all of our support and encour
agement.
