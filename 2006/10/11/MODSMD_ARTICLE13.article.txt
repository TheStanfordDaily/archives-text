# Love is a bike accident waiting to happen
## 
### 
Recently, Stanford University an
nounced a new campaign to curb bike
accidents. I'm ecstatic. With all the
traffic directed from the Main Quad to one
or two intersections of constant traffic, my
social life couldn't be busier. Let me clarify:
like most Stanford students, 1 find the most
social interaction I can fit in my busy day is
the awkward calamity that is the bike acci
dent. Rather, without bike accidents. I would
get no dates at all.
I'm guessing some people may be against
my preferred method of finding a date at
Stanford. Some may call it "unsafe'' or "dan
gerous" or "random." But they could not be
more wrong! It's not random at all. My like
minded "Crash-daters" and I pick our targets
very carefully.Then we employ any variety ol
methods to get ourselves noticed. Sometimes
we'll just accidentally stop short in front ol
them. Sometimes we'll suddenly lose balance
and need assistance getting up. And some
times, toilet plungers fall from trees and get
stuck in the spokes of our bikes. Cupid's

arrow needs a little help, that's all.
Look, love hurts. 1 figure I can usually get
her name if I come away with a few scratch
es, maybe some bruises. I have to suffer sev
eral head wounds and a couple broken ribs
usually just to get a phone number, you
know, for insurance purposes. The women
are usually pretty kind as they help me into
the ambulance. If it doesn't look like I'll
make it through the night, well. I'm pretty
much guaranteed a first date. I mean, she
probably thinks I'm just in shock. And I am.
The shock of love. A concussion and some in

ternal bleeding is a small price to pay for
love. But constantly having to replace in>
bike isn't cheap.
()ne can see the correlation between grad
students' lack of social life and their propen
sity to wear protective helmets. Oh sure, they
ride around accident free, but then they go
back to their labs and name their test tubes
aftei girls they like, creating elaborate ro
mantic theatrical performances depicting
their sexual frustrations with 5 ml. of iron
bromine and a Petri dish of amoeba.Tonight,
folks, the role of Romeo will be played by the
understudy, carbon peroxide.
Right now, 1 just want the administration
to go further with their plans to limit where
people can bike. If they also outlawed bikes
in White Plaza, that would be awesome: Even
more traffic could be directed to key points
across campus. Fhese would be bike accident
"hot spots, 'or as I'd like to think of it "speed
dating opportunities." I'd meet so many peo-
