It's had enough that the Draw holds as
much power over our lives as it does. It
decides whether you get sexiled four
nights a week, or whether you can pick your
peeling feet in privacy without fear of inter
ruption. an embarrassing admonishment by
your roommate and a resulting forced and
awkward joint trip to the podiatrist. The
Draw holds so much authority over our lives
that I'm not really sure that "the Draw" is
just a complex "algorithm" on a "computet
as we are told. I can't help but think its real
ly a complex quasi-religious, age-old tradi
tion where seasoned housing higher-ups with
long white beards gather around a circular
mahogany table drinking whiskey sours. By
crackling fire-light they debate over which
good-hearted, well-meaning scholars de
serve a low number and which mean-spirit
ed, dweeby pupils warrant a membership in
the six thousand club.Then the housing guru
with the longest, whitest beard of all squints
and crinkles his brow and then broodingly
and definitively assign a precisely deserved
number to the case at hand.
Hut then they post the Draw numbers,
and that live-action role-plavinc, flip-flop

and-sock wearing, Renaissance Fair-going
four-eyes, whose social skills are as successful
as his last attempt at shaving, gets a seven
while you struggle to remember whether you
got a 1987 or a i 7 ( )K. And your conception of
the fair and just decisions handed down by
an omniscient demi-god is no more. That's
fine, you tell yourself. Your LARPing friend
probably needs a balcony, central location
and a basketball court for his LO I R re-en
actment tapings. All is for the best.
You're in a class with Larpster McDorkee,
and someone asks the prerequisite question of
dorm residence. Larpster replies "Xanadu."
The question-asker pauses a few moments,
knits his brow.squints,protrudes his bottom lip
out a few millimeters, nods his head and

in just the same way your mom mmed when
your dorky little brother told her he found a

1 at pie simply because he lives on the Row.
Ihe housing hierarchy extends beyond
even living on or off the Row — perhaps most
interesting is the inter-Row house pecking
order that is seemingly so well-entrenched in
our minds. At tirsl glance, it's obvious to me
why some houses are more desirable than oth
ers. Location is important (717 Dolores and

party stumble), rooms are crucial (with better
houses like Bob and Xanadu having more two

a Slavic movie presentation during finals week.

it because we are all closet Franco
philes who secretly fantasize that a
tall, dark and handsome Frenchman
will whisper gorgeously-accented
sweet nothings into our ears'.' Maybe
they have better food? But 1 don't re
member getting the campus-wide
Inter-Row-House Iron Chef Cook-
Off memo letting us all taste and com
pare a typical meal from each house.
Why do we have this strange affection
for certain houses on the Row specifi
cally and for the Row in general?
i have frustratingly seen the
squint-nod-mmm too many times.
Since when did getting a randomly
good number make you cool? Since
when did living anywhere — Row
house, sorority or co-op — automat
ically make anyone cool? There are
the duddlicst of duds laughing far too
hard at their duddly friends' poor
moves in " Risk: Lord of the Rings" in
every row house, and you can chance
upon the kindred-liest of kindred
spirits that you chance upon while
finishing a meal at FloMo dining.
1 lived in Twain my sophomore
year and am in Bob this year as a
senior. Admittedly, a Row house has
been a much more fun place to live,
with its progressives. Beer-B-Qs and
house-sponsored pre-parties. But
it's not more fun because the people
cool-o-meter ratings are off the
charts. Bob has the same cross sec
tion of students, just with more com
munity money to spend on parties
and a place to have them.

Although Katie lives in Bob, she still
happily picks her feet and plays Lord of
the Rings Risk in the privacy of her own
room. If you don t think that's too gross,
