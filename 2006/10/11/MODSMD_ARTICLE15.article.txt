For every Stanford student who

When you fast, you stand with the
over 3.5 million Darfuris who would
die without medical and food aid
daily. You stand with parents whose
daughters have been gang raped. You
stand with the sisters whose brothers

have been bound, beaten, and castrat
ed. You stand with and remember the
countless civilians who heard as they
were shot down: "We will kill all
blacks this is not your homeland."
When you last on Ihursday. you
demand that the United Nations Se
curity c ouncil realize its commitment
to genocide prevention and civilian
protection Although the UN author
ized peacekeepers for Darfur, these
peacekeepers will not deploy without
the Sudanese government's consent.
Naturally, during a time when they
have stepped up their bombing cam
paign against innocent Darfuris,
Khartoum's leaders will not comply.
lliree years into the genocide, with
no great power rising to confront Pres
ident Al Bashir, the burden of crisis
containment continues to be with the
African Union Mission in Sudan
(AMIS). AMIS does not have a man
date to protect civilians.and its force is
demoralized, outgunned and out
manned. Currently, if deployed
throughout Darfur.each AMIS moni
tor would have to patrol a patch of land
the si/e of Manhattan. More astonish
ingly. the Sudanese government can
impose curfews on the force and deter
mine the fuel supply of AMIS' few hel
icopters. In essence, AMIS can defend
only with the aggressor's consent.
I he people of Darfur need effec
tive multinational protection. When
you last on Thursday, you demand
that NATO intervene in Darfur im
mediately. The NATO Response
Force can deploy its forces anvwhere

in the word within live days, and its
troops ean survive without addition
al supplies for another 30 days. Fur
thermore, NATO has held training
exercises in Western Sudan, familiar
izing it with Dai fur's terrain Taking
these facts into account and under
standing the recent organizational
success of the NATO mission to
Afghanistan.it becomes evident that
the mission could not fail.
1 appeal to I he Daily's readers to
understand that this situation does
not have a diplomatic resolution.
Khartoum continues to violate the
conditions of the recent peace ac
cords. President Al-Bashir grows
boldei while the international com
munity verbalizes aimlessly with out
action. Recall Kosovo and remember
that although expensive, NATO in
tervention saved thousands from
death and millions from displace
ment. Recall the grainy black and
white print of liberated Holocaust
survivors and remember that inter
vention can be a force for good.
Fast for Darfur on Thursday. Send

against the genocide in Darfur. ITiis
time, instead of muttering under your

raise your voice for justice and the vic
