## BARBOZA IS BACK Sophomore, recovered from last season's ACL tear, is working harder and playing better than ever 
### BY REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
When the final whistle blew in the Stan
ford women's volleyball team's sweep of Cal
ifornia on Friday, it was a relief see Cynthia
Barboza celebrating the victory with her
teammates. After shaking off the memories of
her last outing against the Bears, the sopho
more outside hitter contributed 13 kills and
three blocks to the Cardinal's winning effort.
It was in Berkeley nearly a year ago that
Barboza landed on her extended left leg and
crumpled to the floor after a kill to start the
second game. In that moment, her promising
freshman campaign came to a premature
close, with a torn ACL keeping her off the
court for several months.
"1 knew 1 had done something pretty bad
to it." Barboza said. "But 1 had no idea of the
extent. 1 knew I was going to he out for the
rest of the match, but it wasn't until [team
doctor] Dr. Lambert called me with the diag
nosis that 1 knew it was the A( L.
When she was injured. Long Beach. Calif,
native Barboza, who has played with the US
National Team, was leading the Pac-10 in kills
and was one of the Cardinal s top performers
in every category. As strong as her stat sheet
was then. Barboza has improved in ever\ as
pect of her game this season, pushing her av
erages in kills, hitting percentage, assists, aces,
digs and blocks even higher in 2006.
Barboza currently ranks second in the
Pac-10 in kills per game (4.59) and aces (0.46)
per game, and is best in the conference in
points (5.47) — the total kills, aces and blocks
per game. She leads the Cardinal in kills with
211 and aces with 21 this season.
"One way that she helps our team is that
she has been a very consistent and high-level
performer," Dunning said. "When you have
someone who does that, it helps everybody
else on the team because you can count on
that person. She also brings a high level of in
tensity and is very competitive. The team can
count on that too."
Barboza is thriving this year, but it was not
an easy road back. She was on the sideline for
the Cardinal's final 11 matches, including a
season-ending loss to Santa Clara in the sec

ond round of the NCAA Tournament.
"It was definitely hard for me," she said.
"It's something that you never think is going
to happen to you and it was not something I
was prepared for It was really hard to sit and
watch the rest of the season on the sideline."
Bai boza did not get discouraged, however,
and she threw her-

self into rehabbing her knee with the same in
tensity that drives her on the court.
"I think she realized that her whole life she
thought that she was working hard." Dunning
said. "But when she was faced with the rehab
she had to do. she realized there is a whole
other level of hard work. [Now that she is
healthy.) she could just go out and play, but

she has worked hard every day. When we run
sprints in practice,she runs as hard,or harder,
than everybody"
The hard work has paid off. both physical
ly and mentally, and the sophomore is playing
at an even higher level that before the injury.

Sophomore outside hitter Cynthia Borboza was leading the Pac-10 in offense when she was hurt halfway through her freshman year. At the
same point in 2006, she has improved in every statistical category.
"1 think I came back physically
stronger than 1 was before because
of all the rehab." Barboza said. "And
now I am also very grateful for every
opportunity I have to get on the
court. It's something 1 don't take for

granted as much as I used to."
With her renewed dedication to
the sport, Barboza is one of the lead
ers on a deep and talented Cardinal
squad. Senior outside hitter Kristin
Richards was named Pac-10 Player
of the Week after hitting error-free
against Cal, sophomore middle
blocker Foluke Akinradewo, the
2005 conference Freshman of the
Year, is one of the most consistent
hitters and most smothering block

ers in the country and junior setter
Bryn Kehoe, a Second-ream All-
American last year, has led the team
to a cumulative hitting percent
age.
"I think that the difference from
last year is that we have matured as
a group, since we only lost two sen
iors last year and brought in two
good freshmen." she said."What it is
going to come down to this year,
with so much talent around the

country, is which team plays best to
gether. So we just want to keep
building our chemistry and see if we
can make something special hap
pen."
The Cardinal will be looking for
that something special when they hit
the road this weekend to face No. 3
UCLA and No. 4 I JSC. Neither the
Bruins nor the Trojans have dropped
a match this season, while the Cardi
nal has only two losses.

nosis that 1 knew it was the A( L.
When she was injured. Long Beach. Calif,
native Barboza, who has played with the US
National Team, was leading the Pac-10 in kills
and was one of the Cardinal s top performers
in every category. As strong as her stat sheet
was then. Barboza has improved in ever\ as
pect of her game this season, pushing her av
erages in kills, hitting percentage, assists, aces,
digs and blocks even higher in 2006.
Barboza currently ranks second in the
Pac-10 in kills per game (4.59) and aces (0.46)
per game, and is best in the conference in
points (5.47) — the total kills, aces and blocks
per game. She leads the Cardinal in kills with
211 and aces with 21 this season.
"One way that she helps our team is that
she has been a very consistent and high-level
performer," Dunning said. "When you have
someone who does that, it helps everybody
else on the team because you can count on
that person. She also brings a high level of in
tensity and is very competitive. The team can
count on that too."
Barboza is thriving this year, but it was not
an easy road back. She was on the sideline for
the Cardinal's final 11 matches, including a
season-ending loss to Santa Clara in the sec

ond round of the NCAA Tournament.
"It was definitely hard for me," she said.
"It's something that you never think is going
to happen to you and it was not something I
was prepared for It was really hard to sit and
watch the rest of the season on the sideline."
Bai boza did not get discouraged, however,
and she threw her-

self into rehabbing her knee with the same in
tensity that drives her on the court.
"I think she realized that her whole life she
thought that she was working hard." Dunning
said. "But when she was faced with the rehab
she had to do. she realized there is a whole
other level of hard work. [Now that she is
healthy.) she could just go out and play, but

she has worked hard every day. When we run
sprints in practice,she runs as hard,or harder,
than everybody"
The hard work has paid off. both physical
ly and mentally, and the sophomore is playing
at an even higher level that before the injury.

Sophomore outside hitter Cynthia Borboza was leading the Pac-10 in offense when she was hurt halfway through her freshman year. At the
same point in 2006, she has improved in every statistical category.
"1 think I came back physically
stronger than 1 was before because
of all the rehab." Barboza said. "And
now I am also very grateful for every
opportunity I have to get on the
court. It's something 1 don't take for

granted as much as I used to."
With her renewed dedication to
the sport, Barboza is one of the lead
ers on a deep and talented Cardinal
squad. Senior outside hitter Kristin
Richards was named Pac-10 Player
of the Week after hitting error-free
against Cal, sophomore middle
blocker Foluke Akinradewo, the
2005 conference Freshman of the
Year, is one of the most consistent
hitters and most smothering block

ers in the country and junior setter
Bryn Kehoe, a Second-ream All-
American last year, has led the team
to a cumulative hitting percent
age.
"I think that the difference from
last year is that we have matured as
a group, since we only lost two sen
iors last year and brought in two
good freshmen." she said."What it is
going to come down to this year,
with so much talent around the

country, is which team plays best to
gether. So we just want to keep
building our chemistry and see if we
can make something special hap
pen."
The Cardinal will be looking for
that something special when they hit
the road this weekend to face No. 3
UCLA and No. 4 I JSC. Neither the
Bruins nor the Trojans have dropped
a match this season, while the Cardi
nal has only two losses.
