With the NBA season on
the horizon, a look at the
rookies 0f2006
With baseball playoffs and the early
part of the football season stealing most
of the national headlines, the NBA pre
season has managed to slip under the
radar for most sports fans. Then again,
with the professional basketball season
stretching all the way from October to
June, it's almost impossible to keep tabs
on when the season isn't in session.
Before the Carmelos, Leßrons and
Dwayne Wades take the court in a few
days for regular season play, sports fans
and columnists around the nation are
arguing about which 2006 draft pick is
going to become the next young super
star, and which draft picks will go the
way of former overall number one,
Michael Olowokandi.
Every draft conversation starts with
the top pick, and this year's chosen one
is Italian Andrea Bargnani, drafted by
the Toronto Raptors. In one preseason
game against the Wizards, Bargnani
managed to score 8 points and grab 4 re
bounds in 13 minutes of play. However,
he also racked up five fouls.
So here's the deal. Raptors' fans are
holding their breath, hoping that
Bargnani will be the next coming of
Dirk Nowitzki. while naysayers are sure
that the 6-foot-10 Italian will more
closely resemble a Nikoloz Tskitishvili.
Ihe truth? He'll start his career off with
a little bit of Nikoloz but with a few
years under his belt, we'll see more and
more Dirk.
Coming into the league, Bargnani is
listed at a generous 225 pounds. As an
NBA power forward. Bargnani is going
to quickly learn that he'll have to
trade his Chicken Parmesan in forT
bone steaks. F.tan Thomas and Bren
dan Haywood exposed Bargnani's
physical weaknesses in his first ap
pearance by consistently taking it to
the rookie and forcing him to the
bench in foul trouble.
That said, Bargnani showed a
great shooting stroke that truly was
reminiscent of Dirk. And, in a year
where the Italians won the World
Cup, I'll be hard pressed to bet
against an Italian. Bargnani, as long
as you hit the gym and bulk up, all I
can say for the upcoming NBA sea
son is, "Viva Italia."
Skipping over the other interna
tional additions to the league, we
come to Brandon Roy, a Pac-10 tal
ent who, in my humble opinion, will
be the next Leßron. Roy, a four-year
player from Washington, will be
spending his rookie season in Port
land, not far from the masses of fans
he left behind at the UW.
As a Stanford basketball fan, I had
the unfortunate opportunity to watch
Roy in college, as he tore through de
fenses with an uncanny combination
ol speed, athleticism and basketball
IQ. Roy is penciled in as the Trail
Blazers' starting shooting guard, and
after his four years of tough Pac-10
competition, he should emerge as this

year's Rookie of the Year.
No rookie discussion can be com
plete without a mention of Adam
Morrison. I'll be honest: I've never
been a fan. To me, Morrison has al
ways been one of those players who
has drawn less attention for his bas
ketball than the other happenings in
his life. But with the opening of the
NBA season, Morrison has an op
portunity for a new start with little
mention of playing I lalo 2 against .1.1
Redick,crying at the end of a basket
ball game or questions about
whether his retro moustache means
he belongs on DVDs alongside Ron
Jeremy rather than on the court with
Ron Artest.
In one preseason game, Morrison
silenced doubters like me who said
he couldn't score at the NBA level
with bigger, quicker defenders. Mor
rison picked up just where he left off
at Gonzaga, pouring in 19 points in
24 minutes of play. A few more per
formances like that, along with a
shave, will bring me over to the Mor
rison bandwagon.
So while the baseball playoffs
heat up and the NFL standings start
to take shape, keep an eye out on the
NBA. For years now, the NBA has
been hunting for the next megastar
to replace Michael Jordan, and while
this year's draft may not have the
heir to Ihe Air. it might just have a
few Scottie Pippens.
