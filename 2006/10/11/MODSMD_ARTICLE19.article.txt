## PAC-10: Trojans hold off UW Arizona, with backup OB, falls to Bruins in last game before visiting winless Stanford 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
Unlike other polls, this one attempts to control for differences in schedules by
ranking the teams purely on how well they've played, not their win-loss
records. I like USC and the Michigan/Ohio State winner to meet in the title game,
but the Trojans had better hope Florida loses along the way.
1 Ohio State 1 Better than the 2002 squad?
2 Florida 3 Beat Auburn this week to gain the AP's top slot.
3 Michigan 4 Major man-crush on Mario Manningham.
4 iOXCIS 5 No one should come within 14 points the rest of the way.
5 Tennessee 9 Only second team ever to hang aver 50 points al Georgia.
6 USC 7 Win over Arkansas suddenly looks better.
7 Aubuir, 2 The rush D totals were horrendous.
8 LSU 6 Still favor this team over any ranked below it.
9 California 12 That's two big-game blowouts.
10 Notre Do 10 Bye this week, but UCLA no sure thing the next.
11 Louisvillf 13 Cruisingfora West Virginia bruising.
12 lowa 14 Should finish 10-2 with additional loss to Michigan.
13 V'QSI Virgins !6 Major dropoff in poll below Mountaineers.
14 Oklahoma 11 There goes the Stoops aura of invincibility.
15 Georgia 15 Tennessee should end the dream this weekend.
21 And I had them ranked last week too!
17 Clemson 18 Gutsy comeback at Wake Forest.
18 rtia lech 17 At this rate, 4-4 could win the ACC.
19 Oregon 8 There goes a potential quality win for USC's BCS run.
20 Missouri 25 6-0 after pantsing a good Texas Tech squad.
21 Boise State 20 Loss of Dan Hawkins doesn't seem to hurt too much.
22 Pittsburgh 22 Much stronger than overhyped Rutgers.
23 Nebraska 24 Two ugly wins in a row.
24 South Carolina 23 Seem to play to level of competition.
25 Washington — Played USC and Oklahoma tough.

Washington 20, No. 3 USC 26
For the second straight week USC faced a
team from the state of Washington. And for the
second straight week, the Trojans' victory was
n't assured until the final whistle.
Washington drove the ball to the USC 15-
yard line with two seconds left, hut they could
n't get off a final play, as the Trojans held on for
the win and remained undefeated. Last week,
USC needed an interception on the final pla\
of the game to fend off Washington State 28-
22.
The Huskies (4-2. 2-1) have looked like a
much improved squad after struggling to just
three wins over the last two seasons. Quarter
back Isaiah Stanback led the Washington of
fense. throwing for 212 yards and two touch
downs with no interceptions against the vaunt
ed USC defense.
His counterpart, USC quarterback John
David Booty, also had a fine game under cen
ter. Hie junior signal-caller passed for 243
yards, a touchdown and an interception.
The Trojans took an early 7-0 lead, scoring
on a beautifully executed fake field goal late in
the first quarter. Backup quarterback and
holder Michael McDonald took the snap, os
tensibly to set up for a 37-yard field goal try.
But instead McDonald rolled out and found a
wide-open Steve Smith for a score.
USC (5-0.3-0) was forced to play without
star receiver Dwayne Jarrett lor the second
straight week. I ie is expected to return for next
week's meeting with Oregon State.
No. 11 Oregon 24, No. 16 California 45
DeSean Jackson continued his explosive
start to the 2000 campaign, scoring two more
touchdowns in Cal's blowout win over Ore
gon. I le tallied his ninth touchdown of the sea
son on a first-quarter pass from quarterback
Nate Longshore and added number ten later
in the half on a punt return.
The win elevated the Bears to a first place
tie with USC in the Pac-1() Conference. The
Trojans visit Berkeley Nov. 18.
Longshore had another solid game, throw
ing for 1 yards, three touchdowns and one in
terception.
The Bears (5-1,3-0) played a majority of the
game without tailback Marshawn Lynch, who
resprained his ankle in the second quarter.
Backup Justin Forsett carried the load, rushing

for 163 yards on 27 carries with a score.
Oregon's usually potent rushing offense, was
stymied by the Bears' front line. Quarterback
Dennis Dixon and tailback Jonathan Stewart
combined for just 70 yards on carries.
The Ducks (4-1.2-1) try to rebound against
UCLA in Eugene this weekend.
Arizona 7, UCLA 27
In a battle of backup quarterbacks, UCLA's
Patrick Cowan outdueled Arizona's Adam
Austin. He was forced to replace usual starter
Ben Olson after he suffered a knee injury in
the first quarter, while Austin replaced Ari
zona quarterback Willie Tuitama after he was
knocked out with his second concussion of the
season.
Cowan looked like he could be a Pac-10
starter, going 20-for-29 with 203 yards, two
touchdowns and no interceptions. Cowan was
forced to carry the offensive load as the Bruins
could muster only 65 yards on the ground, a 15-

yard touchdown strike to Matt Willis with 7:25
left in the second quarter put the Bruins up for
good.
Austin, who will make the start for Arizona
(2-4. 0-3) this weekend against Stanford, also
held his own, passing for 191 yards and a score.
The Bruins (4-1, 2-1) have arguably the
most difficult stretch of their season over the
next two weeks and will have to go without
Olson, who will miss four to six weeks with a
sprained knee. UCLA faces Oregon next week
on the road, before heading to No. 9 Notre
Dame.
Washington State 13, Oregon State 6
Alex Brink carried Washington State with
270 yards and a touchdown, as the Cougars
earned their first win in Corvallis in ten years.
Last year against the Beavers, Brink threw
for a school-record 531 vards, but Oregon

Washington's Isaiah Stanback burned the USC defense for 212 yards and two scores but it was
n't enough for the Huskies. Ihe Washington offense ended the game 15 yards from an upset
State came out victorious, litis time
around. Brink didn't put up record
numbers, but helped his team to a
win.
Brink's favorite target was Jason
Hill, who recently became Washing
ton State s all-time leading receiver,
hauling in five passes for 121 yards
and a touchdown. I lill now has 2,504

career receiving yards, passing 1 high
Campbell who racked up 2.452 from
1960-62.
Oregon State's only points came
on a pair of Alex Serna field goals
from 42 and 41 yards, in the closing
moments of each half, Hie Beavers
struggled offensively all game, rush
ing for just o>4 yards.
Washington State (4-2. 2-1) hosts
two ol the Pac-10's elite teams, Ore
gon and ( al. in the next two weeks.
Hie Beavers (2-3,0-2) hit the road for
the first time in the conference sea

25 Washington — Played USC and Oklahoma tough.

Washington 20, No. 3 USC 26
For the second straight week USC faced a
team from the state of Washington. And for the
second straight week, the Trojans' victory was
n't assured until the final whistle.
Washington drove the ball to the USC 15-
yard line with two seconds left, hut they could
n't get off a final play, as the Trojans held on for
the win and remained undefeated. Last week,
USC needed an interception on the final pla\
of the game to fend off Washington State 28-
22.
The Huskies (4-2. 2-1) have looked like a
much improved squad after struggling to just
three wins over the last two seasons. Quarter
back Isaiah Stanback led the Washington of
fense. throwing for 212 yards and two touch
downs with no interceptions against the vaunt
ed USC defense.
His counterpart, USC quarterback John
David Booty, also had a fine game under cen
ter. Hie junior signal-caller passed for 243
yards, a touchdown and an interception.
The Trojans took an early 7-0 lead, scoring
on a beautifully executed fake field goal late in
the first quarter. Backup quarterback and
holder Michael McDonald took the snap, os
tensibly to set up for a 37-yard field goal try.
But instead McDonald rolled out and found a
wide-open Steve Smith for a score.
USC (5-0.3-0) was forced to play without
star receiver Dwayne Jarrett lor the second
straight week. I ie is expected to return for next
week's meeting with Oregon State.
No. 11 Oregon 24, No. 16 California 45
DeSean Jackson continued his explosive
start to the 2000 campaign, scoring two more
touchdowns in Cal's blowout win over Ore
gon. I le tallied his ninth touchdown of the sea
son on a first-quarter pass from quarterback
Nate Longshore and added number ten later
in the half on a punt return.
The win elevated the Bears to a first place
tie with USC in the Pac-1() Conference. The
Trojans visit Berkeley Nov. 18.
Longshore had another solid game, throw
ing for 1 yards, three touchdowns and one in
terception.
The Bears (5-1,3-0) played a majority of the
game without tailback Marshawn Lynch, who
resprained his ankle in the second quarter.
Backup Justin Forsett carried the load, rushing

for 163 yards on 27 carries with a score.
Oregon's usually potent rushing offense, was
stymied by the Bears' front line. Quarterback
Dennis Dixon and tailback Jonathan Stewart
combined for just 70 yards on carries.
The Ducks (4-1.2-1) try to rebound against
UCLA in Eugene this weekend.
Arizona 7, UCLA 27
In a battle of backup quarterbacks, UCLA's
Patrick Cowan outdueled Arizona's Adam
Austin. He was forced to replace usual starter
Ben Olson after he suffered a knee injury in
the first quarter, while Austin replaced Ari
zona quarterback Willie Tuitama after he was
knocked out with his second concussion of the
season.
Cowan looked like he could be a Pac-10
starter, going 20-for-29 with 203 yards, two
touchdowns and no interceptions. Cowan was
forced to carry the offensive load as the Bruins
could muster only 65 yards on the ground, a 15-

yard touchdown strike to Matt Willis with 7:25
left in the second quarter put the Bruins up for
good.
Austin, who will make the start for Arizona
(2-4. 0-3) this weekend against Stanford, also
held his own, passing for 191 yards and a score.
The Bruins (4-1, 2-1) have arguably the
most difficult stretch of their season over the
next two weeks and will have to go without
Olson, who will miss four to six weeks with a
sprained knee. UCLA faces Oregon next week
on the road, before heading to No. 9 Notre
Dame.
Washington State 13, Oregon State 6
Alex Brink carried Washington State with
270 yards and a touchdown, as the Cougars
earned their first win in Corvallis in ten years.
Last year against the Beavers, Brink threw
for a school-record 531 vards, but Oregon

Washington's Isaiah Stanback burned the USC defense for 212 yards and two scores but it was
n't enough for the Huskies. Ihe Washington offense ended the game 15 yards from an upset
State came out victorious, litis time
around. Brink didn't put up record
numbers, but helped his team to a
win.
Brink's favorite target was Jason
Hill, who recently became Washing
ton State s all-time leading receiver,
hauling in five passes for 121 yards
and a touchdown. I lill now has 2,504

career receiving yards, passing 1 high
Campbell who racked up 2.452 from
1960-62.
Oregon State's only points came
on a pair of Alex Serna field goals
from 42 and 41 yards, in the closing
moments of each half, Hie Beavers
struggled offensively all game, rush
ing for just o>4 yards.
Washington State (4-2. 2-1) hosts
two ol the Pac-10's elite teams, Ore
gon and ( al. in the next two weeks.
Hie Beavers (2-3,0-2) hit the road for
the first time in the conference sea
son, facing Washington in Seattle.
Unlike other polls, this one attempts to control for differences in schedules by
ranking the teams purely on how well they've played, not their win-loss
records. I like USC and the Michigan/Ohio State winner to meet in the title game,
but the Trojans had better hope Florida loses along the way.
1 Ohio State 1 Better than the 2002 squad?
2 Florida 3 Beat Auburn this week to gain the AP's top slot.
3 Michigan 4 Major man-crush on Mario Manningham.
