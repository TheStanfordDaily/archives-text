## Robot car to tackle city streets stanford Racing Team has big plans for 2007 Grand Challenge

Look, Ma, no humans.
Such is the rallying cry of the Stanford Racing
Team, composed of nearly forty Stanford faculty,
researchers and graduate students. The team has
been in collaboration with Volkswagen's Silicon
Valley lab to try to win the 2007 Defense Ad
vanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
Grand Challenge, seeking a car that can navigate
a simulated urban environment for sixty miles in
less than six hours, without any human guidance.
To win the $2 million prize money, the Stanford
team must do all this while finishing first in what
will likely be a field of more than thirty teams.
The Racing Team is fresh off a first-place finish
in the 2006 DARPA Grand Challenge, where its
robot car. a Volkswagen Touareg dubbed "Stan
ley," won a race through the desert.
Michael Montemerlo, senior researcher at
Stanford's Al Labs and software lead for the Rac
ing Team, said the squad faces additional chal
lenges this year.
"Last year, you had a robot that had to com
plete a course in the desert all by itself without any
manual intervention," Montemerlo said. "So you
press the go button and either it makes it or it
doesn't. In the urban challenge it also has to act
reasonably in the face of other traffic."
According to Montemerlo — the new car, a
Passat donated by Volkswagen — will have to re
liably detect and track a variety of new obstacles.
These will range from static hazards, such as curbs
and holes, to dynamic hazards including cars, bicy
cles and pedestrians. And it will have to do so
while obeying traffic laws, acting appropriately at
intersections and doing everything else an experi
enced human driver would.
David Stavens, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in
computer science and co-creator of Stanley, said
the team is in it for the "humanitarian aspect".
With 43,000 deaths on the road every year, count
less lives could be saved if human drivers were re
placed by machines that could potentially have
quicker reactions, better senses and never get
tired.
