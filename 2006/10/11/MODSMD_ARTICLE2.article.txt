## Robot car to tackle city streets stanford Racing Team has big plans for 2007 Grand Challenge 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Look, Ma, no humans.
Such is the rallying cry of the Stanford Racing
Team, composed of nearly forty Stanford faculty,
researchers and graduate students. The team has
been in collaboration with Volkswagen's Silicon
Valley lab to try to win the 2007 Defense Ad
vanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
Grand Challenge, seeking a car that can navigate
a simulated urban environment for sixty miles in
less than six hours, without any human guidance.
To win the $2 million prize money, the Stanford
team must do all this while finishing first in what
will likely be a field of more than thirty teams.
The Racing Team is fresh off a first-place finish
in the 2006 DARPA Grand Challenge, where its
robot car. a Volkswagen Touareg dubbed "Stan
ley," won a race through the desert.
Michael Montemerlo, senior researcher at
Stanford's Al Labs and software lead for the Rac
ing Team, said the squad faces additional chal
lenges this year.
"Last year, you had a robot that had to com
plete a course in the desert all by itself without any
manual intervention," Montemerlo said. "So you
press the go button and either it makes it or it
doesn't. In the urban challenge it also has to act
reasonably in the face of other traffic."
According to Montemerlo — the new car, a
Passat donated by Volkswagen — will have to re
liably detect and track a variety of new obstacles.
These will range from static hazards, such as curbs
and holes, to dynamic hazards including cars, bicy
cles and pedestrians. And it will have to do so
while obeying traffic laws, acting appropriately at
intersections and doing everything else an experi
enced human driver would.
David Stavens, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in
computer science and co-creator of Stanley, said
the team is in it for the "humanitarian aspect".
With 43,000 deaths on the road every year, count
less lives could be saved if human drivers were re
placed by machines that could potentially have
quicker reactions, better senses and never get
tired.
"We have a tremendous amount ot space
on this campus devoted to parking." Stavens
said. "But an automatic car could drop you
off and go park itself some distance away."
Stavens said that an automated car could
be a more efficient use of both time and
money. For instance, three or four people
could easily share one car, since it could drive
itself between their locations. And commut
ing time would no longer consist of wasted
hours stuck on either end of the working day.
In a self-driving car, the passenger's attention
could be focused on more productive tasks,
such as answering email.
"It could also affect traffic," Montemerlo
added. "With communication between vehi
cles, you could increase [traffic flow] substan
tially so you actually get places faster on the
highway. And you can imagine people driving
who can't drive today, such as elderly people
who can't see very well. Or even kids. Their
parents could put them in the car and send
them to where they need to go."
Montemerlo emphasized that the move
towards autonomous cars like Stanley and
the winner of the 2007 Grand Challenge
would not happen overnight.
"I don't think cars will become au
tonomous instantly," Montemerlo said.point
ing to "smart" anti-lock brakes that are al
ready in cars. "You should think of that car as
being just a tiny bit autonomous. Cars are
going to have more and more of these adap
tive systems and one day you'll wake up. and
you'll have a car that's able to drive itself."
The Stanford Racing Team is led by Sebas
tion Thrun. an assistant professor of comput
er science and the head of Stanford's 150-per
son AI Labs. Last year, Stanley was first out of
23 robot cars to compete in a 132-mile race
through the Nevada desert and one of only
four which successfully completed the drive.
The team took away $2 million from last
year's race. Some of the prize money was
used to fund this year's research, while the
rest went to the School of Engineering to
endow a scholarship.
"From now until pretty much indefinitely
there will be a student funded by Stanley's
prize money," Stavens said.
This year, the Racing Team sought money
from a variety of sponsors, including Mohr
Davidow Ventures, Intel. Google and NXP
Semiconductors. Sponsors donated money in
return for the right to put logos on the au
tonomous car and exchange information with
the team. The team also applied for and re
ceived a technology development grant from
DARPA. which may total up to $1 million.
The team also includes members of Volkswa
gen Labs, based in Palo Alto.

ready in cars. "You should think of that car as
being just a tiny bit autonomous. Cars are
going to have more and more of these adap
tive systems and one day you'll wake up. and
you'll have a car that's able to drive itself."
The Stanford Racing Team is led by Sebas
tion Thrun. an assistant professor of comput
er science and the head of Stanford's 150-per
son AI Labs. Last year, Stanley was first out of
23 robot cars to compete in a 132-mile race
through the Nevada desert and one of only
four which successfully completed the drive.
The team took away $2 million from last
year's race. Some of the prize money was
used to fund this year's research, while the
rest went to the School of Engineering to
endow a scholarship.
"From now until pretty much indefinitely
there will be a student funded by Stanley's
prize money," Stavens said.
This year, the Racing Team sought money
from a variety of sponsors, including Mohr
Davidow Ventures, Intel. Google and NXP
Semiconductors. Sponsors donated money in
return for the right to put logos on the au
tonomous car and exchange information with
the team. The team also applied for and re
ceived a technology development grant from
DARPA. which may total up to $1 million.
The team also includes members of Volkswa
gen Labs, based in Palo Alto.
