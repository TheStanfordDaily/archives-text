### TRANGDAI TRANGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Who cloth Shake this year?
When the Stanford Shakespeare Society held
auditions last week. Bard enthusiasts and aspiring
actors flocked to the stage. Everyone from fresh
men to graduate students tried out for the troupe,
boasting a wide range of majors from computer
science to history.
Though the hoard cannot release details about
those who auditioned, artistic director and junior
Nisa Ari revealed promising news — at tryouts
the first night, the gender ratio was almost equal.
What was StanShakes looking for in the audi
tion?
"In the audition room, we are looking for excit
ed. interesting, intelligent actors that both have a
passion for Shakespeare and for working in an en
semble-type setting," said Ari. "We expect every
one m the ensemble to bring something new to the
table, so we love talking to people about their pas
sions beyond the theater."
Junior David Terca, who auditioned for the
group, said that the members make StanShakes
special for him.
"1 know a few of the people in the group, and all
I can say is that they're wonderful people," said
Ferca. who helped out with last year's spring show.
"I only hope that I should be so lucky to work with
them."
All students were welcome to audition, regard

less of previous experience. Terca tried out. despite
his limited acting background. I le acted in his high
school's drama production for four years, yet he
never had to audition since there were only 120
people in his school.
Other students have had more experience in
theater. Junior Roselyn I lallett performed in high
school and community theater productions in
Montana, and junior Stephanie Shih boasts an
array of experiences.
"I did a lot of acting in high school. I did musi
cals. Shakespeare and dramas." Shih said.
Wondering how nerve-wrecking it could be to
go through with auditions?
"The audition is not something to be afraid of."
Terca said."l went in. recited my monologue to the
returning Shakes members and was out of there in
10 minutes."
The StanShakes directors are not shv in admit
ting their uniqueness from other Stanford per
formance groups.
"[This] is a different performing experience
than any other on campus because of our year
long commitment to each other as an ensemble."
Ari said. "After training together in the fall, we al
ready have learned to work in the group so that
when we start our full-length productions, we can
jump right into the real work without having to get
comfortable with one another."
Those who auditioned similarly sang Stan-
Shakes' praise.
I lallett. who said she appreciated "the group's
identity as a troupe," chose Stanford over the I Jni
versity of Southern California because of I"he
Farm's superior drama department.
This year's board includes Ari. executive
producer Matt Valesco, show directors Aaron

Berg and Shelly Ronen. producers Grant llin
derliter and Leah Schwartz, community out
reach coordinator J illian Keenan. social manag
er Anna Terteryan and technical director Amy
Leblang . The group already has big plans for
the year.
"What's new this year is our commitment to
bringing in guest lecturers and workshop leaders
during the fall for training," Ari said. "Although
we have worked with professionals in the past, we
have made an effort this year to bring in a more
diverse group of instructors to train us on every
thing from movement to silent comedy. Also, by
having a showcase at the end of fall quarter in
stead of an abridged version of a Shakespeare
show, we hope to better serve and challenge our
actors and their creative goals by creating an ex
perimental forum."
Expectations are high for this year's lineup.
StanShakes will be performing "Measure for Mea
sure," notoriously deemed as a problem play by
Shakespearean critics. However, the team is en
thusiastic to take on the challenge.
"We felt as an artistic team that Measure for
Measure' worked nicely with 'Macbeth' tocreate a
season centralized around themes of morality and
mortality." Ari said."Also, it was a play that our di
rector. Shelly Ronen, had a passion for. and when
that is the case, a 'problem play' becomes much
less of a problem and more of a challenge and ad
venture."
Ronen agreed.
"One of Shakes' missions is to tell stories, to en
liven what some see as inaccessible literature and
others as untouchable poetry." she said. "Stan-
Shakes works to engage and challenge our audi
ence by pushing boundaries."
