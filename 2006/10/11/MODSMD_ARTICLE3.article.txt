President John L. Hennessy unveiled "The Stanford
Challenge" yesterday, a five-year, $4.3 billion fundraising
campaign aimed at three broad areas: seeking solutions to
pressing global problems, educating students to become ef
fective leaders and sustaining a foundation of excellence.
"A lot of universities undertake campaigns, but they are
often 'more of the same,"' said University Trustee Chair
man Burton McMurtry. "We'll continue to do what we do,
but we'll also build on our strengths and focus our re
sources on four areas through this highly multidisciplinary

initiative.
According to McMurtry, the comprehensive Challenge
will channel resources into four primary initiatives, includ
ing human health care, international relations, environ
ment and sustainability and the arts. The University will
also allocate funds to improve both graduate and under
graduate education at Stanford. McMurtry said he was es
pecially pleased with the University's renewed commit
ment to promoting the arts and creativity.
"Historically, Stanford has invested [less] in the arts
than in other parts of the University," McMurtry said.
"Our students could benefit from this across-the-board
initiative."

The ambitious University-wide effort was unanimous
ly approved by the Board of Trustees and will focus on
multidisciplinary research and teaching initiatives.
In a University press release, Hennessy discussed the
campaign's goal of enabling Stanford to address complex
social and scientific challenges.
"Stanford is uniquely prepared among universities —
by its breadth of scholarship, entrepreneurial heritage and
pioneering faculty — to provide research and real-world
approaches to address many of these issues," he said.
The Stanford Challenge will emphasize collaboration
