# NEW INITIATIVE AIMS TO RAISE $4.3 BILLION
## Hennessy launches Stanford Challenge 
### KELLEY FONG JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
President John L. Hennessy unveiled "The Stanford
Challenge" yesterday, a five-year, $4.3 billion fundraising
campaign aimed at three broad areas: seeking solutions to
pressing global problems, educating students to become ef
fective leaders and sustaining a foundation of excellence.
"A lot of universities undertake campaigns, but they are
often 'more of the same,"' said University Trustee Chair
man Burton McMurtry. "We'll continue to do what we do,
but we'll also build on our strengths and focus our re
sources on four areas through this highly multidisciplinary

initiative.
According to McMurtry, the comprehensive Challenge
will channel resources into four primary initiatives, includ
ing human health care, international relations, environ
ment and sustainability and the arts. The University will
also allocate funds to improve both graduate and under
graduate education at Stanford. McMurtry said he was es
pecially pleased with the University's renewed commit
ment to promoting the arts and creativity.
"Historically, Stanford has invested [less] in the arts
than in other parts of the University," McMurtry said.
"Our students could benefit from this across-the-board
initiative."

The ambitious University-wide effort was unanimous
ly approved by the Board of Trustees and will focus on
multidisciplinary research and teaching initiatives.
In a University press release, Hennessy discussed the
campaign's goal of enabling Stanford to address complex
social and scientific challenges.
"Stanford is uniquely prepared among universities —
by its breadth of scholarship, entrepreneurial heritage and
pioneering faculty — to provide research and real-world
approaches to address many of these issues," he said.
The Stanford Challenge will emphasize collaboration

among Stanford's many depart
ments, centers and institutes, admin
istrators say.
"Stanford has a very strong tradi
tion of working across the disciplines
and being a nimble,collaborative and
entrepreneurial institution," said
Martin Shell, vice president of devel
opment. in an email to Ihe Daily.
"Stanford also has a rich tradition of
a pioneering culture that spans di
rectly back to the vision of Jane and
Lcland Stanford when they founded
the University. A major goal of 11k*
Stanford Challenge is to build upon
those traditions and address the is
sues and opportunities facing hu
mankind in this new century

Hie first component of the cam
paign seeks $1.4 billion to support
potentially transformative multidis
ciplinary initiatives, including the
three recently launched to address
global challenges. These initiatives
include the Initiative on Human
Health, the Initiative on the Envi
ronment and Sustainability. and the
International Initiative.
The campaign's goal of preparing
students to be effective leaders in
the 21st century will be achieved
through a $1.175 billion effort. Stan
ford will look to implement innova
tive academic and extracurricular
programs focused on improving K
-12 education, exploring new ways to
engage students in the creative arts,
and further enhancing undergradu
ate and graduate education.This will
include increasing undergraduate
and graduate financial aid. particu
larly through need-based scholar

ships for international undergradu
ates and loan repayment assistance
for graduate students who pursue
public interest work.
Ilie final piece of the campaign
strives to raise $1,725 billion to up
hold Stanford's excellence in both
teaching and research. It will achieve
this goal by increasing both Univer
sity-wide annual giving as well as
support for faculty and students.
This component. Shell said, "aims
to ensure that we continue to have
the core strengths — support for
faculty and students — that are nec
essary in order to do the multidisci
plinary work that is the focus of the
other two components."
Stanford was the first university to
raise $1 billion with the Centennial
Campaign,completed in 1992, as well
as the first to raise $1 billion exclu
sively for undergraduate education,
accomplished in 2(K)5 with the Cam

paign for Undergraduate liducation.
While Shell acknowledged that The
Stanford Challenge's financial goal is
bold, he was confident that this cam
paign would also end in success.
"We have compelling ideas and
strong leadership, starting with John
1 lennessy,whose vision for Stanford
is embodied in this campaign, and in
the incredible work that our faculty
and students are doing in the labora
tory and classroom," Shell said.
"Our success to date also is directly
tied to the world of our enthusiastic
and dedicated volunteers."
According to Hennessy. early
gifts to the campaign total almost
$2.19 billion.
Examining the big picture, Mc-
Murtry shared Shell's enthusiasm for
the project. "If universities don't step
up and try to solve some of the
world's big problems," he said. "I
think we'll have wasted our charter."

include the Initiative on Human
Health, the Initiative on the Envi
ronment and Sustainability. and the
International Initiative.
The campaign's goal of preparing
students to be effective leaders in
the 21st century will be achieved
through a $1.175 billion effort. Stan
ford will look to implement innova
tive academic and extracurricular
programs focused on improving K
-12 education, exploring new ways to
engage students in the creative arts,
and further enhancing undergradu
ate and graduate education.This will
include increasing undergraduate
and graduate financial aid. particu
larly through need-based scholar

ships for international undergradu
ates and loan repayment assistance
for graduate students who pursue
public interest work.
Ilie final piece of the campaign
strives to raise $1,725 billion to up
hold Stanford's excellence in both
teaching and research. It will achieve
this goal by increasing both Univer
sity-wide annual giving as well as
support for faculty and students.
This component. Shell said, "aims
to ensure that we continue to have
the core strengths — support for
faculty and students — that are nec
essary in order to do the multidisci
plinary work that is the focus of the
other two components."
Stanford was the first university to
raise $1 billion with the Centennial
Campaign,completed in 1992, as well
as the first to raise $1 billion exclu
sively for undergraduate education,
accomplished in 2(K)5 with the Cam

paign for Undergraduate liducation.
While Shell acknowledged that The
Stanford Challenge's financial goal is
bold, he was confident that this cam
paign would also end in success.
"We have compelling ideas and
strong leadership, starting with John
1 lennessy,whose vision for Stanford
is embodied in this campaign, and in
the incredible work that our faculty
and students are doing in the labora
tory and classroom," Shell said.
"Our success to date also is directly
tied to the world of our enthusiastic
and dedicated volunteers."
According to Hennessy. early
gifts to the campaign total almost
$2.19 billion.
Examining the big picture, Mc-
Murtry shared Shell's enthusiasm for
the project. "If universities don't step
up and try to solve some of the
world's big problems," he said. "I
think we'll have wasted our charter."
