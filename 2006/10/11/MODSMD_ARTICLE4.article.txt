## Compulsive buying not just for women School of Medicine studies reveal men are just as likely to have money spending disorder 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
From glossy pink chick-lit like "Confessions of a Shopaholic" to "Sex
and the City," women have traditionally been portrayed as more prone to
therapeutic shopping trips and lust for expensive shoes than men. But
new research from the School of Medicine rejects this conventional wis
dom and the statistic — that 90 percent of people suffering from compul
sive buying disorder are female — that has supported it.
"It's not true," said Dr. Lorrin Koran, emeritus professor of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences at the School of Medicine and senior author of
"Estimated Prevalence of Compulsive Buying Behavior in the United
States," which was published in the October 200b issue of the American
Journal of Psychiatry. "Eighty to ninety percent of people who respond to
advertisements about therapy and help [for compulsive buying) are
women, which makes people think that women have this problem more
than men do. But men and women are equally likely to suffer from com
pulsive buying."

survex and rated respondents on the Compulsive Buying
Scale, which asks seven questions about spending habits and
the respondent's level of fiscal control. One question was"!

bank, and respondents were asked to answer often, very
often, sometimes or never. Respondents were then scored on
a set scale, and those with scores lower than a certain mark

eral population sample, found that 5.8 percent of the respon

ITiough it has no formal definition, compulsive buying
disorder includes such symptoms as frequent, irresistible, in
trusive and senseless impulses to buy; marked distress; and
financial problems as a result of excessive buying. The seri
ous and habitual damage wreaked on sufferers and their
loved ones is the most important distinction between com
pulsive buying disorder and occasional impulse purchases.
Koran also noted that college students are at an age when
they can start to identify these patterns.

said. "And then, at least for the people who come for treat
