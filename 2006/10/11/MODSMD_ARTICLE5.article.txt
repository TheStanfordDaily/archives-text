# Alum creates networking site
## Project unites anonymous users based on similar experiences 
### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
For people who love Jack Johnson, hate Bush or
wish they went to Hogwarts, Facebook offers a
chance to meet up with others like them. But what
about those who want to talk about having a
toothache, remembering a first kiss or suffering
from depression? The Experience Project, a two
week old networking Web site, allows Internet
users to bond anonymously over just these kinds of
shared experiences.
"People don't want to share negative things
about themselves on 112 acebook or MySpace," said
Experience Project founder Armen Berjikly, a
2(H) 1 Stanford graduate. "They only share the
shiny, happy side of themselves and market them
selves to create what they think other people want
to see. The Experience Project makes people feel
like they have a place where they can be genuinely
who they are in real life."
