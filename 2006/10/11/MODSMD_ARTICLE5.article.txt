# Alum creates networking site
## Project unites anonymous users based on similar experiences 
### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
For people who love Jack Johnson, hate Bush or
wish they went to Hogwarts, Facebook offers a
chance to meet up with others like them. But what
about those who want to talk about having a
toothache, remembering a first kiss or suffering
from depression? The Experience Project, a two
week old networking Web site, allows Internet
users to bond anonymously over just these kinds of
shared experiences.
"People don't want to share negative things
about themselves on 112 acebook or MySpace," said
Experience Project founder Armen Berjikly, a
2(H) 1 Stanford graduate. "They only share the
shiny, happy side of themselves and market them
selves to create what they think other people want
to see. The Experience Project makes people feel
like they have a place where they can be genuinely
who they are in real life."

Berjikly got the idea for the Ex
perience Project after designing on
line health communities, which
allow people with common illnesses
to bond and receive support over the
Internet. The anonymity of the
groups allows users the freedom to
discuss themselves, and he decided
to expand on this concept with his
new networking Web site.
The Experience Project is de
signed around common experiences
posted by users, to which other users
can either share their own experi
ences or simply remark "Me too."
"Not me" or "I'm planning to."
I isers can browse by groups, stories,
people, secrets or dreams, and the
most popular groups include "I love
Steven Colbert" and"I loved some
one who didn't love me."
In a group about battling depres
sion, a poster identified as "punkin"
\\ rote,"l've had depression for many
years now and have been in and out
of its grasp. For about seven months
now I've been squeezed by it every
day. I cannot remember the last time
I felt happy or genuinely laughed."
Another poster."liesby," wrote in
a group about singing karaoke,"l've
only sung karaoke once, and it was a
couple of months ago during a trip to
Japan. About 20 of us went.and 1 was
determined to not get up there, but a
friend and 1 decided to go together.
She and I, plus two others, sang
'Somebody to Love' by Queen, and
we were absolutely horrible, but it
was still one of the best memories of
the trip."

A poster might confess to having
HPV or suicidal thoughts, but his
identity is protected by the website's
complete anonymity, a feature bor
rowed from the online health com
munities that Berjikly worked on be
fore and something that he considers
essential.
"Anonymity is one of the comer
stones of the online health commu
nity — people aren't necessarily
willing to put their names behind
those kinds of experiences in a pub
lic forum," he said.
But users of the Experience Pro
ject are also free to reveal their iden
tities if they want to by privately
messaging other posters with similar
experiences.
"The people themselves can
share information through private
messaging, which is most definitely
not illegal. It's actually implicitly en
couraged that people clump togeth
er. People who find themselves
forming very deep connections can
immediately start messaging each
other," Berjikly said.
Berjikly graduated from Stan

Computer Science and a Master's
