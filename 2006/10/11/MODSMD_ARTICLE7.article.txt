Analysts are still trying to better under
stand the test's veracity, but the US Geologi

from the Korean peninsula, which measured
4.2 on the Richer Scale

but in either case the message from North

tional nuclear technology
And. no matter what the size of the explo
sion. the symbolic meaning of North Korea
having the bomb has captivated U S foreign
policy thinkers
"This is a serious setback for U Sand glob
al nuclear non-proliferation efforts, especially
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)."
said Political Science Prof. Scott D Sagan.
"This is the first time that a state has been
caught cheating on its NPT commitments,
withdrew from the treaty and then developed
an atomic bomb."
Sagan. who has long been adamant about
the dangers of nuclear proliferation, is director
of Stanford's ( enter for International Securi
ty and Cooperation (CISAC) and co-author of
The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate
Renewed.
North Korea's flaunting of its nuclear capa
bilities seemed to catch the fiu-h administra
tion off guard, perhaps in no small part be
cause of the time officials had spent focused
elsewhere The administration has been
bogged down in recent weeks dealing with
Iraq. Afghanistan and the political fallout
from both.
Regional experts, however, expressed less
surprise about the test
"My first reaction was that this is not unex
pected. said Gi-Wook Shin, head of Stan
ford's Korean Studies program and Director
of the Walter H Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center (APARC). Shin said that he had

been expecting a test slightly later, but defi
nitely within the next year.
Daniel Sneider. Associate Director of
APARC. also felt the timing made sense. "I
thought for a long time that they wouldn't do
this because it's a line that once you cross it
you can't go back." he said. "But more recent
ly I'd come to conclude that they figured there
was more to be gained from [testing] "
North Korea's gamble may pay off. The
world's policymakers, the U S. in particular, are
paying rapt attention to the regime's every
move. And.for Kim Jong-Il.that may be exact
ly what is desired.
Selig S. Harrison, author of Korean
Endgame, w rote in the Washington Post Tues
day that "Paradoxical as it may seem. Py
ongyang staged the test as a last-ditch effort to
jump-start a bilateral dialogue on the normal
ization of relations that the United States has
so far spurned."
A stunt for attention would be nothing new.
In tact, even as the U.S. was debating whether
Iraq had or w as pursuing weapons of mass de
struction in 2003. Kim Jong-II was publicly de
claring North Korea's progress toward "nu
clear deterrence."
North Korea's requests for direct negotia
tion were repeatedly dismissed by the Bush
administration, which said it did not want to
reward bad behavior with engagement.
This week's events likely show that policy's
weakness Instead of an improving North
Korea striving to gain international accept
ance and credibility, negotiators must deal
with a new nuclear state wielding weapons as a
demand to be heard.
Others maintain he U.S. purposefully did
not engage North Korea during the past sever
al years in order to end ambiguity and lay all
the cards on the table. The test leaves little
doubt about what North Korea has been
working on. and what their intentions are.
"The hawks appear to have gotten their
way." The New York Times editorial board
opined Tuesday. "So why don't wc feel safer?"
Clarity may have come at the cost of giving
North Korea more time to develop their
weapons.
Assuming that North Korea is unlikely to
surrender its arms and the spotlight it has been
given, the main question for the rest of the
world is w hat to do next. As Condoleezza Rice
recently made clear in statements this week,
war is not on the table.
Besides the fact that the U.S. is already
overwhelmed militarily with troop deploy

ments in Iraq and Afghanistan, any military
action against North Korea would be extreme
ly risky.
Seoul is within range of conventional ar
tillery (let alone any nuclear attack) from the
North The South Korean capitol v. ould sustain
devastating damage in the event of an attack.
North Korea is also believed to have mis
siles staged within striking range of Japan. In
terms of any land action, the reclusive nation
possesses one of the world's largest armies
The overwhelming force couched in a defen
sive position could inflict heavy casualties on
attacking troops.
With force an unlikely response, the interna
tional community is left with much of the same
as before in terms of choices — negotiations or
sanctions The difference is a sense of urgency
Statements by John Bolton, the U.S. envoy to
the United Nations, seem to point toward sanc
tions. and other nations like previously resistant
China seem to agree that serious punishment
may be in line. Sanctions could include a reduc
tion or cutoff in areas like food aid. much of
which is currently provided by South Korea.
Such harsh actions will definitely be noticed,
but they may be a precursor to talks rather than
an immediate route to disarmament.
"I think there's still a possibility that these
types of measures will cause North Korea to
consider what they've done and come back to
some sort of bargaining process. I think the
more isolated North Korea feels the better at
this point." Sneider said, offering Cuba as a
cautionary tale of how sanctions can fail to
achieve intended consequences.
On the other hand, while immediate bilat
eral negotiations would satisfy North Korea,
they might send the wrong message to others
with nuclear ambitions, most notably Iran.
Should the U.S. reverse its current policy and
negotiate simply because North Korea has fi
nally acquired nuclear weapons. Iran may be
encouraged to proceed with its own develop
ment at a quickened pace, a situation both the
U.S. and Israel desperately want to avoid
Whatever the path, a unified effort by the
key actors — the U.S.. China. Russia. South
Korea and Japan — remains essential, schol
ars say.
According to Shin, one of the main reasons
diplomacy has failed thus far was the separate
policies of engagement by China and South
Korea, and the more hard line approach of the
U.S. and Japan.
"Unless they cooperate with each other."
he wrote, "neither policy can work."
