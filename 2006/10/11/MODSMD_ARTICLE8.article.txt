## Editorial 5-SURE deserves additional funding 
### 
Many students on campus arc proba
bly unaware of the Stanford United
for Rape I limination program. It's
better known by the acronym 5-SURE,
which is the program's contact number for a
ride late at night. Yet we feel it is crucial to
point out the words behind the acronym as
well as the widespread confusion over what
thev stand tor With good reason, the func
tion ot 5-Sl RI has expanded to more than
I List rape prevention — but its funding has
not. I he Administration's support and budg
eting for the service must increase if it is to
remain efficient and effective.
1 or those who have not seen or used the
golf carts with the flashinggreen lights, the 5-
St RI program offers students a nighttime
pickup and escort service designed to help
increase safety across campus. Simply dial
725 SURi (7873) and a golf cart will come.
The problem is that it won't necessarily
come ver\ quickly. Waits often exceed 30
minutes, a frustrating reality leading many
students to give up and leave before the cart
arrives. Phis in turn frustrates the driver and
dispatcher, who work from a coordinated
and prioritized list to try to help as many
callers as possible.
There is some validity to criticisms that
some abuse 5-Sl RI and use it out of lazi
ness rather than necessity But the real prob
lem lies with the structure and funding of the
program, which have not adapted to accom
modate the new responsibilities 5-SURE
has been given.
I he program was originally designed to
reduce the incidence of rape by providing an
alternative to women having to traverse the
campus alone at night. In recent years,thanks
to increased overall safety and a non-dis

crimination policy, this role has changed; 5-
SURE picks up anyone, whether alone or in
a large group, and takes the caller to whatev
er location he or she requests — even it it is
lust the next party. In fact.s-SURE's website
does not even display the original acronym.
Stanford United for Rape Elimination, but
bills itself as offering "security escorts."
Admittedly, more funding for shuttling
drunk students doesn't sound particularly
compelling in a budget expansion proposal;
consequently, no one is probably very eager
to have his or her name attached to it. But
trivial as carting around intoxicated party
hoppers may seem, doing so can have a pro
found impact in terms of campus safety —
one in which Stanford's Risk Management
Department should invest.
Police still ticket students both on bikes
and in cars for DUls. so providing a fully
equipped shuttle service would provide a
convenient alternative option. Even though
the campus is fairly safe, minimizing the
number of inebriated students stumbling
around would also reduce both injuries and
property damage.
As is. 5-SURE is still a useful program,
but it needs more golf carts and more driv
ers The current equipment would work if it
were solely dedicated to rape prevention,
but a renewed commitment will be neces
sary to provide Stanford with a true "securi
ty escort" service. The University is very
proud <>l its successful alcohol policy and the
fact that several years have passed since the
last alcohol-related death. While the lack of
major incidents may seem to imply that 5-
Sl RI is unnecessary, it's more than worth
the cost if it prevents even one rape or alco
hol-related death.
