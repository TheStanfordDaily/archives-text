# No-cook pasta sauces
## 
### 
Because this is the first installment of
"Cooking on Campus," I'm going to
take a lew words to explain what the col
umn is all about. It's going to teach you to
make food that's fast, easy and tastes good.
()l ten. like this week, you'll be able to make the
recipes without access to a kitchen. I'll almost
never suggest recipes that either require a lot
of equipment or take a lot of time to prepare.
Why bother cooking? For one, you can
cook yourself ;i tasty meal for much less than
ten dollars a pop. the general going rate at
Stanford dining halls. ( ooking can also help
you eat healthy, because you control exactly
what you put into your food. But the main
goal ot this column is to help make cooking
fun and easy, something you want to do.
M\ qualifications? I'm a Stanford stu
dent. I like to cook and I have spent far more
time watching I-bod Network than is healthy
or even safe. Ihat's it. So if I can make this
stuff, you probably can too.
Ihis week's column focuses on pasta
sauces Pasta's price makes it classic starv
ing student food. Experts debate its nutri
tional merit, but with protein and carbs, at
least it will keep you alive. And. like beer,
people have been consuming it for thou
sands ot years. I bet people will still be eating
pasta and drinking beer long after nutrition
experts are wiped out in a post-apocalyptic,
possibly ironic frenzy of cannibalism. 1 don't
know about >ou. but 1 find that comforting.
1 he tricky part is figuring out what to put
on your pasta. Many of lis have been brought
upon canned tomato sauces and have grown
to love them. But in case you get sick of
those, this week's column features two quick
from scratch pasta sauces: tomato and basil,
and ricotta. Ilie kicker is that neither re
quires any cooking, so really all you have to
do is boil a pot of water.
Ihe tomato and basil sauce is basically
just a tomato salad, made ahead of time to
allow the flavors to meld, tossed at the last
second with cooked pasta. Ibe pasta retains
enough heat to just warm up the tomatoes,
lliis is a great dish it you're having friends
over, because you can get everything ready
ahead of time. When people start showing
up. you just cook the pasta and mix it all up
at the table, so your triends get a whiff of the
basil and garlic aromas released by the heat.
It sounds obvious, but I think a lot of peo
ple haven't come to grips with the fact that
the food you make will taste pretty much

like the stuff you put in it Hint's especially
true for these recipes, because you won't he
doing any cooking to alter the flavors. So it's
worth going the extra mile to find good in
gredients: flavorful extra virgin olive oil (i.e.,
not Safeway brand) and ripe tomatoes.
I look for two things when I shop for
tomatoes. Hie first is softness. A ripe tomato
will have a good amount of give it you
squeeze it in your hand.The second is smell.
When you're at the store, take one of the
tomatoes and put it l ight up to your nose. If
it doesn't smell like a tomato, it probably
won't taste like anything. Finally, even
though I'm not entirely on board with the
whole organic movement. I w ill buy organic
tomatoes if 1 have a choice. Iliey tend to be
riper and taste noticeably better.
The second recipe is even simpler, just ri
cotta thinned out with olive oil and a little of
the cooking liquid and a grind of black pep
per to give it some kick. It has the same ap
peal as mac and cheese: rich.creamy, cheesy,
easy for just about everyone to enjoy.
Ricotta. Italian for "re-cooked," is made
by heating whey (the liquid component of
cheese-making) that has already yielded one
batch of curds (the solid component). It has a
creamy texture and mild flavor (you want the
soft, fresh variety, not the hard, sailed ricotta
salata). It would be nice if you could find fresh
ricotta.but it was still quite good when I made
it with the standard plastic-packaged stuff.

Half an hour before you want to
eat. toss everything but the pasta to
gether in a big bowl.'lTiis allows the
flavors time to combine.
At mealtime, cook the pasta ac
cording to the package instructions.
When done, drain the pasta com
pletely and add it to the bowl with
the tomatoes. Give it a quick stir to
combine everything evenly and
serve immediately.
Pasta with Kicotta Sauce
•2 cups ricotta
•1/4 cup olive oil
•Salt and freshly ground pepper
•Chopped parsley (optional)
• 1 lb. pasta
Serves 4-6
Cook the pasta according to the
package instructions. When done,
drain the pasta over a bowl, preserv
ing the cooking liquid. Return the
pasta to the cooking pot and dump
in the ricotta and olive oil. Stir
through and add the cooking liquid a
little at a time until you get a nice
saucy consistency. Add enough salt
to make it taste good, and as much
black pepper as you like (I think it's
best with a lot). If you feel it needs
color, you could stir in some fresh
parsley. If you have leftovers, they'll
still be good the next day;either cold
or reheated.

If you try one of these recipes, let me
know how it turns out at
nsoloni&stanforii.edu. Or you
could just invite me over for dinner.
