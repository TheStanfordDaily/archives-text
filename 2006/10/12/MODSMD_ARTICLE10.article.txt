## Editorial Board Pub Night is back 
### 
Stanford seniors can breathe a collective
sigh of relief. After a brief hiatus Senior
Night is back in business, with its tradi
tional festivities kicking ott around 10 p.m.
tonight at a swanky night spot on California
Ave. Working with the Office ol Student Af
fairs (OS A), the Senior class presidents have
finally hashed out the terms of the event.
While there are some new restrictions.a gag
gle of freshly minted sober monitors and a
page long waiver to sign, there's no doubt
it'll still be fun. So get excited. Ciet veryexcit
ed. But please â€” don't get too drunk.
A number of seniors (not to mention
some spirited 21-year old juniors) have
grumbled about the two-week delay and the
sttict new rules being put implemented.
Some common concerns: the administration
is cancelling traditions such as Senior Night
with little justification: the Administration is
unfairly punishing this year's seniors for last
year's mistakes; and the onslaught of new
regulations is unnecessary and worse, arbi
trary. Students have even taken their gripes
to Face book, with the group "When I was
your age. Stanford was fun." headlining a
complaint about Senior Night's delay
Such criticisms are fair, if only in light of
the fact that the administration has not
spelled out its reasoning behind the reforms.
But publicly explained or not. the adminis
tration does have a legitimate rationale for
its position. According to Nanci Howe, di
rector of the OSA, problems with Senior
Night are not unique to last year's seniors.
The event has faced recurring difficulties
over the last several years, with reckless use
of alcohol and problematic behavior jeop
ardizing both student safety and the Univer
sity's relationships with local establishments
and police.
To be clear, labeling student behavior
"problematic" is to say that there have been
repeated instances of vomiting on the Mar
guerite. out-of-control fights, disrespect to
ward bus drivers and hospitalizations for
binge drinking. It is not to say, however, that
such behavior has been the norm, or even

widespread. Unfortunately, such infractions
have been damaging to Senior Night's safe
ty and accountability record. Given the trou
bled reputation of the event, it has become
increasingly difficult to secure buses and
venues, and University officials have begun
to question whether senior fun should come
at the expense of Stanford's relationship
with surrounding communities.
I lie idea behind the reorganization of Se
nior Night is that "Senior fun" and "Stan
ford's reputation" shouldn't be mutually ex
clusive concepts. Hie administration wants
to address problems that the event has en
countered m the past and the class presi
dents want to make sure everyone has a
good time. Furthermore, by requiring stu
dents to sign off on their responsibilities, in
dividuals will be held accountable for their
actions and the poor behavior of a few won't
jeopardize the tradition for everyone. Both
the class presidents and the administration
have emphasized that the sustainability of
the event is in the hands of this year's seniors.
II the Senior Night tradition is to continue,
even senior must take personal responsibil
ity for his behavior at what is,after all,a Stan
lord sponsored event.Those who would pre
fer to drink irresponsibly can party on their
own dime.
As I lowe suggested. Stanford is not an is
land. it is a part of a larger community with
all the usual rules and regulations. Stanford
students are not above the law of the land,
despite that fervently held belief to the con
trary. So tonight, just remember: 11 it's the
difference between Senior Night and no Se
nior Night, put the drink down. And please,
don't be a bystander. II one of your friends
goes a little overboard, take responsibility.
Walk her to the bathroom, wait a few, and
then call a cab. A trip to Suites from Califor
nia Ave is not going to cost you more than
the $5 minimum cab fee. When that five dol
lars and a little consideration could be the
clincher between Thursday nights of fun or
Iliursday nights of problem sets and papers,
it might well be worth it.
