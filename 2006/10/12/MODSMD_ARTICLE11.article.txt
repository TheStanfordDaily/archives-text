Ladies and gentlemen, the sad story of
how I acquired my Metro Face. For
those of you who don't spend two
hours of each day getting sweated on hy
other people in the Moscow Metro system,
the Metro Face is the expression that virtu
ally all locals wear while taking public trans
portation. It's basically an Out of Order sign
for your face, a visual cue that you're going
to spend the next 40 minutes zoning out and
avoiding social contact, and would appreci
ate it it other people did the same.
To get the picture, stand in front of a mir
ror and first relax all of your facial features
until your 10 dips 12 points.'llien imagine
that the guy standing next to you smells like
garlic and is elbowing your ears. Hie best
Metro Facers look like they're listening to
meditation tapes by Charles Manson. Some
of the little old babushki who have been rid
ing around Moscow since before Stalin
jumped ship have Metro Faces that are vir
tually bulletproof. Or maybe the bullets just
got lost in all the wrinkles.
I he Metro Face is the key to successful
transportation in Moscow. I believe it was
John Locke's Ukrainian brother Boris who
wrote about the Social Contract of the
Moscow Metro: All who benefit from the
safety of the system must agree to sacrifice
any and all signs of human emotion.
Ihis is a problem for me: as an American,
mv default expression is irony; 1 even walk
with an accent. Alter two weeks. I managed
to whittle my Metro l ace from barely-sup
pressed laughter to mere smirking. But still
almost every day I got stared at. jeered at

and once quite rudely shoved on the shoul
der. Just for smiling. I low did Russians ever
get a reputation for being uptight?
Anyway, the legendary night of my first
Metro Face incident started as a simple trip
with a friend to an indie bar across town. We
elbowed our way onto the car and were just
congratulating ourselves on finding seats
when we heard a belch. Hie culprit: a fat
Asian man wearing a newsie cap catatoni
cally drunk in the seat in front of us. I le was
sitting in such a way that every jiggle of the
car made him sway precariously into the
handrail at the end of the seat. It took the
guy sitting next to him a stop and a half of
surreptitious ogling to figure out that he was
just drunk and not dead.
Much to the chagrin of the crossword
solving man sitting next to my friend, I let
slip a chaste little chuckle.
Then apparently we hit turbulence on the
tracks. The car was a-rocking and a-reeling
like the walkers-only section at a Bruce
Springsteen concert, and every time it
