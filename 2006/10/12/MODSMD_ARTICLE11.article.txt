Ladies and gentlemen, the sad story of
how I acquired my Metro Face. For
those of you who don't spend two
hours of each day getting sweated on hy
other people in the Moscow Metro system,
the Metro Face is the expression that virtu
ally all locals wear while taking public trans
portation. It's basically an Out of Order sign
for your face, a visual cue that you're going
to spend the next 40 minutes zoning out and
avoiding social contact, and would appreci
ate it it other people did the same.
To get the picture, stand in front of a mir
ror and first relax all of your facial features
until your 10 dips 12 points.'llien imagine
that the guy standing next to you smells like
garlic and is elbowing your ears. Hie best
Metro Facers look like they're listening to
meditation tapes by Charles Manson. Some
of the little old babushki who have been rid
ing around Moscow since before Stalin
jumped ship have Metro Faces that are vir
tually bulletproof. Or maybe the bullets just
got lost in all the wrinkles.
I he Metro Face is the key to successful
transportation in Moscow. I believe it was
John Locke's Ukrainian brother Boris who
wrote about the Social Contract of the
Moscow Metro: All who benefit from the
safety of the system must agree to sacrifice
any and all signs of human emotion.
Ihis is a problem for me: as an American,
mv default expression is irony; 1 even walk
with an accent. Alter two weeks. I managed
to whittle my Metro l ace from barely-sup
pressed laughter to mere smirking. But still
almost every day I got stared at. jeered at

and once quite rudely shoved on the shoul
der. Just for smiling. I low did Russians ever
get a reputation for being uptight?
Anyway, the legendary night of my first
Metro Face incident started as a simple trip
with a friend to an indie bar across town. We
elbowed our way onto the car and were just
congratulating ourselves on finding seats
when we heard a belch. Hie culprit: a fat
Asian man wearing a newsie cap catatoni
cally drunk in the seat in front of us. I le was
sitting in such a way that every jiggle of the
car made him sway precariously into the
handrail at the end of the seat. It took the
guy sitting next to him a stop and a half of
surreptitious ogling to figure out that he was
just drunk and not dead.
Much to the chagrin of the crossword
solving man sitting next to my friend, I let
slip a chaste little chuckle.
Then apparently we hit turbulence on the
tracks. The car was a-rocking and a-reeling
like the walkers-only section at a Bruce
Springsteen concert, and every time it


Lewin

Out and Aboutski
moved, the man's head slipped far
ther through the handrail and to
ward the floor. To prevent this, a
man jumped up from his seat and
stood by Drunk Asian Guy, using
his ass as a buffer from the floor.
Drunk Asian Guy started drooling
on Ass Pillow's slacks, but nobody
in the entire car moved a muscle.
I giggled so hard I snorted, caus
ing Crossword to lean halfway
across my friend's chest, staring re
proachfully at me with his Bassett
hound eyes, close enough to count
my pores. Without even looking
down, he opened a Big Gulp-sized
beer that was concealed in a bag in
his lap and calmly raised it to his
lips. Sipping and judging, judging
and sipping.
Before I could stifle it, out came
a full-fledged guffaw, causing the
two men standing over my shoul
der to stop their screaming match
about Ukrainian independence (or
maybe the latest episode of
"House" — I missed some of the
subtext) and stare. The bolder of
the two put one hand on my shoul
der and inexplicably started snap
ping the fingers of his other hand in
front of my eyes.
As I sat there with one man
snapping his fingers in front of my
face like an epilepsy test. Cross
word's eyeballs creating physical
humidity on my shoulder and Ass
Pillow bopping along to his iPod
like a stranger's nose wasn't
halfway up his Hanes, the drunk
man's hat fell off.
1 lost it. I laughed so hard for two
stops that a nearby doctor wrote out
a prescription for morphine. 1
laughed so hard I hyperventilated
— my abs are still sore. Between the
disapproval.confusion and outright
loathing of my laughter, I think the
only person in the car that still had
his Metro Face on by the end was
the drunk man. But it might have
just been a coma.
That's not when 1 acquired my
Metro Face, by the way. The Metro
Face part came later at the bar, as 1
watched some sloshed sorority girl
types engaging in attempted cultur
al exchange with a Russian chick. I
think it revolved largely around
shoe shopping tips and trying to
translate the phrase "1 heart you,"
but honestly 1 tuned out. I had my
Metro Face on.

Ever get kicked off'the Marguerite for
being too chipper? Kat doubts it.

ate it it other people did the same.
To get the picture, stand in front of a mir
ror and first relax all of your facial features
until your 10 dips 12 points.'llien imagine
that the guy standing next to you smells like
garlic and is elbowing your ears. Hie best
Metro Facers look like they're listening to
meditation tapes by Charles Manson. Some
of the little old babushki who have been rid
ing around Moscow since before Stalin
jumped ship have Metro Faces that are vir
tually bulletproof. Or maybe the bullets just
got lost in all the wrinkles.
I he Metro Face is the key to successful
transportation in Moscow. I believe it was
John Locke's Ukrainian brother Boris who
wrote about the Social Contract of the
Moscow Metro: All who benefit from the
safety of the system must agree to sacrifice
any and all signs of human emotion.
Ihis is a problem for me: as an American,
mv default expression is irony; 1 even walk
with an accent. Alter two weeks. I managed
to whittle my Metro l ace from barely-sup
pressed laughter to mere smirking. But still
almost every day I got stared at. jeered at

and once quite rudely shoved on the shoul
der. Just for smiling. I low did Russians ever
get a reputation for being uptight?
Anyway, the legendary night of my first
Metro Face incident started as a simple trip
with a friend to an indie bar across town. We
elbowed our way onto the car and were just
congratulating ourselves on finding seats
when we heard a belch. Hie culprit: a fat
Asian man wearing a newsie cap catatoni
cally drunk in the seat in front of us. I le was
sitting in such a way that every jiggle of the
car made him sway precariously into the
handrail at the end of the seat. It took the
guy sitting next to him a stop and a half of
surreptitious ogling to figure out that he was
just drunk and not dead.
Much to the chagrin of the crossword
solving man sitting next to my friend, I let
slip a chaste little chuckle.
Then apparently we hit turbulence on the
tracks. The car was a-rocking and a-reeling
like the walkers-only section at a Bruce
Springsteen concert, and every time it


Lewin

Out and Aboutski
moved, the man's head slipped far
ther through the handrail and to
ward the floor. To prevent this, a
man jumped up from his seat and
stood by Drunk Asian Guy, using
his ass as a buffer from the floor.
Drunk Asian Guy started drooling
on Ass Pillow's slacks, but nobody
in the entire car moved a muscle.
I giggled so hard I snorted, caus
ing Crossword to lean halfway
across my friend's chest, staring re
proachfully at me with his Bassett
hound eyes, close enough to count
my pores. Without even looking
down, he opened a Big Gulp-sized
beer that was concealed in a bag in
his lap and calmly raised it to his
lips. Sipping and judging, judging
and sipping.
Before I could stifle it, out came
a full-fledged guffaw, causing the
two men standing over my shoul
der to stop their screaming match
about Ukrainian independence (or
maybe the latest episode of
"House" — I missed some of the
subtext) and stare. The bolder of
the two put one hand on my shoul
der and inexplicably started snap
ping the fingers of his other hand in
front of my eyes.
As I sat there with one man
snapping his fingers in front of my
face like an epilepsy test. Cross
word's eyeballs creating physical
humidity on my shoulder and Ass
Pillow bopping along to his iPod
like a stranger's nose wasn't
halfway up his Hanes, the drunk
man's hat fell off.
1 lost it. I laughed so hard for two
stops that a nearby doctor wrote out
a prescription for morphine. 1
laughed so hard I hyperventilated
— my abs are still sore. Between the
disapproval.confusion and outright
loathing of my laughter, I think the
only person in the car that still had
his Metro Face on by the end was
the drunk man. But it might have
just been a coma.
That's not when 1 acquired my
Metro Face, by the way. The Metro
Face part came later at the bar, as 1
watched some sloshed sorority girl
types engaging in attempted cultur
al exchange with a Russian chick. I
think it revolved largely around
shoe shopping tips and trying to
translate the phrase "1 heart you,"
but honestly 1 tuned out. I had my
Metro Face on.

Ever get kicked off'the Marguerite for
