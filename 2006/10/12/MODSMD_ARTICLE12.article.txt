Take stronger action for Darfur
I praise and applaud James Vaughan's
passion, compassion, perseverance and de
termination regarding the Genocide in Dar
fur ("Darfur l ast 2(M)(r Stand against geno
cide," Oct. 11). I laving lived the Darfur crisis
as a full-time volunteer activist for many
months now gives me a perspective that I
wish to share with Mr. Vaughan — a man of
such promise. Mr. Vaughan. had you ap
proached your education with the relative
force implicit in a one-day-fast from luxu
ries, you would not be attending Stanford
University. You probably wouldn't even be
at tending a community college.
Let us either take the approach of giving
up Darfur to genocide explicitly, or let our
approach be realism and honesty about
what it will take to stop the genocide. Hut the
approach that has been followed by the vast
majority of Darfur activists thus far has been
to do what is convenient; to do what others

might likely "sign up" for; that is. to confine
ourselves to activities in which we could
"succeed" instead of pursuing activities that,
although more risky and demanding, have
the potential of stopping Darfur Genocide.
litis approach of convenience that we
have been taking is worse than taking no ac
tion at all. It is worse because it squanders
what energy is potentially available and in
correctly communicates to the onlookers
and participants alike that the actions being
proposed will be sufficient. Ihis approach
becomes a killing campaign of misinforma
tion. almost certain to result in Genocide
again and again, insuring a future filled with
regrets like Rwanda.
I.et us squarely face and admit to our
abandonment of Darfur, or let us become re
alistic about what is required to stop the
genocide.
