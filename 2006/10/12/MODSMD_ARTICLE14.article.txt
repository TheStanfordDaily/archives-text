# Foreign impressions

### 
(Chinese) Wo de sixiang hui geng shang yi
eenglou.
(English) My way of thinking will rise to a
higher level.
It's not that hard to impress most Chinese
(aside from Chinese language teachers)
with your speaking ability if you obvious
ly lack Chinese ancestry.This is fairly easy to
experience — on your way out of a Chinese
restaurant, simply toss "Xiexie, zaijian!"
(Thank you, good bye!) and you probably
won't make it to the door. You will instead
find yourself hounded into a corner by the
store owner demanding to know where you
learned to speak Chinese so well. I"his low
expectation of foreigners really can come in
handy when you're trying to buy things.
Drop "Tai gui le" (Too expensive) and. after
a short pause, the shopkeeper will state a
new price that's a good third less than the
previous. Granted, foreigners usually simply
dish out whatever outrageous amount of
money they're asked for, so this isn't all that
surprising. You are, in effect,given a discount
off of a marked-up price. Hey. it works.

Sometimes, however, there is that odd
foreigner that actually wants to learn enough
Chinese to communicate with others, not
merely impress strangers. These are the for
eigners that learn how to ask directions, read
and understand menus and even pay rent.
Within this group of odd foreigners, there is
an even odder group: the uppity foreigners
that wish to speak fluently enough to carry
on normal conversations, and perhaps even
sound well-educated. These are the only
people who would benefit from knowing the
introductory sentence: but they might bene
fit from it quite a bit. The phrase "Geng
shang yi eeng lou" is the key element to
sounding educated (and not merely uppity,
as the sentence might seem if you said in

stead "Wo dcsixianghui tigao," which means
the same but has fewer syllables). It is actu
ally the last line of a well-known Chinese
poem, and dropping it into a conversation or
paper is a way of marking yourself a snob,
which is a good thing there. Here, on the
other hand, it would be like someone mum
bling "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood"
with a wise expression on their face when
talking about choosing between law school
and med school. Which wouldn't be the best
way to increase your popularity.
I his might indicate a good reason for
our status in the world hierarchy of educa
tion, leaving us one less thing to wonder
about. T'he United States keeps slipping in
its education rankings internationally —
around fourth grade, our students still per
form above average, but by the time they
reach 12th grade, American students are
some of the, well, dumbest of the devel
oped world. But we spend more per head
than a lot of other countries, have smaller
class sizes and so on. ITiere are so many
reasons we could t»ive for this: Students
