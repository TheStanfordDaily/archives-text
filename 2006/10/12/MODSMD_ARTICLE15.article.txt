# The
						Last Word on the Bike Ban

### 
1 was still angry about the bike ban. I decid
ed to leave President Hennessy three
notes a day. I'd tear out a piece of binder
paper, jot a little anti-bike-ban screed and
slip it under his door. Plus I sent him regular
emails. Occasionally, I asked him what his fa
vorite flavor of ice cream was. 1 thought I'd
charm the secretaries who delete I iennessy s
junk mail.
Then I got an email from Dean of Stu
dents Maureen Powers. She wanted to meet
with me. Powers is new to Stanford. Last
month she told The Daily, "Stanford has a
tradition of involving students with decision
making, and I hope to ...always keep students
at the forefront of the decision-making
process." That is quite a thing to say. and she
was upholding her promise by talking to me.
She explained why the ban was created. A
Pedestrian Review Group installed it for two
reasons: 1) significant egress concerns, with
the preponderance of parked bikes blocking
emergency exit zones and causing lots of
"bumps and scratches," and 2) concerns for
"people with accessibility issues."
I asked her who was on the Pedestrian Re
view Group and what kind of research they
had conducted. I asked her exactly how often
people were injured. "All the time," she said,
repeating "bumps and scratches." She indi
cated that people were walking into parked
bikes, which is frankly impossible to imagine

in the physical universe we inhabit.
In fact. Powers admitted that she found
the security argument less convincing than
the issue of increasing accessibility for peo
ple with accessibility issues. In my experi
ence. bikers tend to give more leeway to peo
ple with such difficulties. Apparently, there
were too many bikes parked in the arcades,
and these people could not get through. I low
many hikes were there? She did not know.
She threw out the number "400 or 800,"
which is not exactly precise. Her arguments
made sense,but where were the facts? Where
was the research?
I asked for something concrete â€” com
plaints. statistics, the numbers of people with
accessibility issues, anything that actually
happened to directly motivate the ban. She
asked me. "Darren, if even one person with
accessibility problems has more accessibility
now. isn't that enough?"
I didn't say this to Powers,because she is a

smart woman and she offered me a bagel, but
that has to be the biggest load of horse shit 1
have ever heard. It is not an argument, it's a
U2 song. She was talking down to me. which
is not uncommon for our administrators.
112 ollow this "even one person" argument,
and you reach absurdity. If even one person
hikes across grass and trips over unsteady
ground, will we have security monitoring all
the grass? It even one person climbs on the
( law, falls oil, and breaks his leg, will there be
security preventing all fountain hopping that
isn t an Absolute Fun event? Sound ludi
crous.' The bike ban sounded just as ludi
crous in May.
I decided to try pragmatism. Let us start
Irom the presumption that bicycle accidents
are a problem. (I do not think they are, be
cause accidents will always happen.) In an in
terview with Ibe Daily, Sergeant Al James of
Public Safety (who also hadn't seen any sta
tistics) noted that if bikers "aren't riding in
the arcades, they would probably have to be
in the pedestrian malls." 1 wish James had
been on the Pedestrian Review Board, be
cause that makes serious sense.
I sketched the Quad for Powers, with a cir
cle representing the Intersection of Death,
though we all know that it is actually a
rhombellahedron. colloquially known as a
