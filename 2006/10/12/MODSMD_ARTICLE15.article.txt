# The 						Last Word on the Bike Ban
## 
### 
1 was still angry about the bike ban. I decid
ed to leave President Hennessy three
notes a day. I'd tear out a piece of binder
paper, jot a little anti-bike-ban screed and
slip it under his door. Plus I sent him regular
emails. Occasionally, I asked him what his fa
vorite flavor of ice cream was. 1 thought I'd
charm the secretaries who delete I iennessy s
junk mail.
Then I got an email from Dean of Stu
dents Maureen Powers. She wanted to meet
with me. Powers is new to Stanford. Last
month she told The Daily, "Stanford has a
tradition of involving students with decision
making, and I hope to ...always keep students
at the forefront of the decision-making
process." That is quite a thing to say. and she
was upholding her promise by talking to me.
She explained why the ban was created. A
Pedestrian Review Group installed it for two
reasons: 1) significant egress concerns, with
the preponderance of parked bikes blocking
emergency exit zones and causing lots of
"bumps and scratches," and 2) concerns for
"people with accessibility issues."
I asked her who was on the Pedestrian Re
view Group and what kind of research they
had conducted. I asked her exactly how often
people were injured. "All the time," she said,
repeating "bumps and scratches." She indi
cated that people were walking into parked
bikes, which is frankly impossible to imagine

in the physical universe we inhabit.
In fact. Powers admitted that she found
the security argument less convincing than
the issue of increasing accessibility for peo
ple with accessibility issues. In my experi
ence. bikers tend to give more leeway to peo
ple with such difficulties. Apparently, there
were too many bikes parked in the arcades,
and these people could not get through. I low
many hikes were there? She did not know.
She threw out the number "400 or 800,"
which is not exactly precise. Her arguments
made sense,but where were the facts? Where
was the research?
I asked for something concrete — com
plaints. statistics, the numbers of people with
accessibility issues, anything that actually
happened to directly motivate the ban. She
asked me. "Darren, if even one person with
accessibility problems has more accessibility
now. isn't that enough?"
I didn't say this to Powers,because she is a

smart woman and she offered me a bagel, but
that has to be the biggest load of horse shit 1
have ever heard. It is not an argument, it's a
U2 song. She was talking down to me. which
is not uncommon for our administrators.
112 ollow this "even one person" argument,
and you reach absurdity. If even one person
hikes across grass and trips over unsteady
ground, will we have security monitoring all
the grass? It even one person climbs on the
( law, falls oil, and breaks his leg, will there be
security preventing all fountain hopping that
isn t an Absolute Fun event? Sound ludi
crous.' The bike ban sounded just as ludi
crous in May.
I decided to try pragmatism. Let us start
Irom the presumption that bicycle accidents
are a problem. (I do not think they are, be
cause accidents will always happen.) In an in
terview with Ibe Daily, Sergeant Al James of
Public Safety (who also hadn't seen any sta
tistics) noted that if bikers "aren't riding in
the arcades, they would probably have to be
in the pedestrian malls." 1 wish James had
been on the Pedestrian Review Board, be
cause that makes serious sense.
I sketched the Quad for Powers, with a cir
cle representing the Intersection of Death,
though we all know that it is actually a
rhombellahedron. colloquially known as a


Franich

Ire and Vice
"clusterfuck." With more traffic in
that area, there would be even less
accessibility for physically disabled
people, not to mention a general
decrease in security. Whereas be
fore bikers were equally distributed
in the arcades and the street, now
the main entranceway is that tiny
gateway on the Education Building
side barely big enough for a suck
ling pig.
This was probably my best argu
ment. By coincidence, just as I was in
the middle of it. Powers' assistant
walked in and said that she was late
for a meeting. 1 begged Powers to
consider the Intersection of Death,
how it was bad for both security
AND accessibility: how by solving
one problem poorly, the administra
tion was creating several more; how
she is new and can change things and
she needs to make them understand
that they can't just keep taking
things away from us; how we need a
dialogue. "I'll look into it," she said,
proving that life actually is like the
movies. She opened the door, signi
fying we were finished.
I wasn't. Outside her office, with
her two assistants looking up from
their computers, my voice echoing
down the hall, I asked her to consid
er the slippery slope, told her that
once the ban is fully in effect it will
be even harder to change things.
Powers. I discovered, does not be
lieve in the slippery slope.
Powers did not know what the In
tersection of Death was. This is not
her fault. She is new here, and she
works in Tresidder. Anyway, I do not
think any other administrator
knows the area much better. I do not
see Etchemendy riding his bike
through White Plaza every day. Hen
nessy rides his cute electro-cart. In
fact, I would venture to guess that

most administrative staff do not ride
bikes on campus.
The bicycle ban may make sense,
but the administration is letting us
down if they think that this Pedestri
an Review Group does not need to
justify itself. "Bumps and bruises"
are not just cause. Accessibility is
valid argument, worth talking about.
But if the ban only creates more
problems, what good is it?
Why was this Pedestrian Review
Group called, when there are far
more important issues on campus?
Who was on this group? What re
search did they do? And what idiot
came up with the name "Ped
Zone?"
I agree that at peak hours traffic
is problematic, but a full-time ban is
excessive. At 5 p.m. there is almost
no one around, except happy
tourists and brides. 1 do not believe
the arguments brought up by the
administration are convincing. Stu
dents want evidence that this bike
ban is worthwhile, and not just the
aftermath of its implementation.
We want to be treated as equal
partners in this university. Techni
cally. there are more students than
administrators, more angry frater
nity boys than deans of students,
but we'll allow them a voice if they
deign to listen to ours. It is not crazy
to demand information. It is foolish
to deny it.
Yesterday President Hennessy fi
nally emailed me:
Dear Mr. Franich:
Thank you for your input on the
bicycle policy. We have passed it
along to the office responsible for
public safety.
Sincerely,
John Hennessy
He did not tell me his favorite fla
vor of ice cream. I hold no grudge.
Hennessy, the Dean of Students, the
Provost, the Vice Provost and the
Board of Directors — they are not

like us.They do not live at Stanford,
they just work here. 1 was waiting for
a personal conversation, but admin
istrators must guard what they say.
Many of my friends are going into
the corporate world: there is not
much idealism on Wall Street. And
Stanford is a corporation. Only for
us students, is it a way of life.
I admire Dr. Powers. She spoke to
me as if I was just another student,
and for a major administrator at a
top-ranked university, that says a lot.
1 hope that by disseminating what
she told me, I have helped to answer
the question many students have
been asking: Why? It is not her fault
that her arguments lack research. 1
don't know why she is worried. I am
giving people information they have
been asking for. In a way, I am doing
her job for her. We are all in this to
gether. after all.
At 5:30 in the afternoon, on a

clear day. there is something very
pleasant about biking through the
arcades — the echoing whirr of
wheels in the quiet of near-dusk. I
never used to appreciate that, before
the bicycle ban. We always forget the
little joys until they are gone. I do
not think Hennessy and Powers
have ever biked through the arcades
ot the Quad. That is a shame.
I'm finished with the bicycle ban.
Hut check this shit. All it took to get
a meeting with the tricking Dean of
Students was a bunch of scrawls on
binder paper laid on the President's
doorstep. That is pretty cool. Some
one will listen, if you are devoted, or
absurd, enough to trv.

/barren Franich will never write about
the Bicycle Ban again. Don 't bother
emailing him at dfranich@stanford

nessy's office is in Building 10.

she needs to make them understand
that they can't just keep taking
things away from us; how we need a
dialogue. "I'll look into it," she said,
proving that life actually is like the
movies. She opened the door, signi
fying we were finished.
I wasn't. Outside her office, with
her two assistants looking up from
their computers, my voice echoing
down the hall, I asked her to consid
er the slippery slope, told her that
once the ban is fully in effect it will
be even harder to change things.
Powers. I discovered, does not be
lieve in the slippery slope.
Powers did not know what the In
tersection of Death was. This is not
her fault. She is new here, and she
works in Tresidder. Anyway, I do not
think any other administrator
knows the area much better. I do not
see Etchemendy riding his bike
through White Plaza every day. Hen
nessy rides his cute electro-cart. In
fact, I would venture to guess that

most administrative staff do not ride
bikes on campus.
The bicycle ban may make sense,
but the administration is letting us
down if they think that this Pedestri
an Review Group does not need to
justify itself. "Bumps and bruises"
are not just cause. Accessibility is
valid argument, worth talking about.
But if the ban only creates more
problems, what good is it?
Why was this Pedestrian Review
Group called, when there are far
more important issues on campus?
Who was on this group? What re
search did they do? And what idiot
came up with the name "Ped
Zone?"
I agree that at peak hours traffic
is problematic, but a full-time ban is
excessive. At 5 p.m. there is almost
no one around, except happy
tourists and brides. 1 do not believe
the arguments brought up by the
administration are convincing. Stu
dents want evidence that this bike
ban is worthwhile, and not just the
aftermath of its implementation.
We want to be treated as equal
partners in this university. Techni
cally. there are more students than
administrators, more angry frater
nity boys than deans of students,
but we'll allow them a voice if they
deign to listen to ours. It is not crazy
to demand information. It is foolish
to deny it.
Yesterday President Hennessy fi
nally emailed me:
Dear Mr. Franich:
Thank you for your input on the
bicycle policy. We have passed it
along to the office responsible for
public safety.
Sincerely,
John Hennessy
He did not tell me his favorite fla
vor of ice cream. I hold no grudge.
Hennessy, the Dean of Students, the
Provost, the Vice Provost and the
Board of Directors — they are not

like us.They do not live at Stanford,
they just work here. 1 was waiting for
a personal conversation, but admin
istrators must guard what they say.
Many of my friends are going into
the corporate world: there is not
much idealism on Wall Street. And
Stanford is a corporation. Only for
us students, is it a way of life.
I admire Dr. Powers. She spoke to
me as if I was just another student,
and for a major administrator at a
top-ranked university, that says a lot.
1 hope that by disseminating what
she told me, I have helped to answer
the question many students have
been asking: Why? It is not her fault
that her arguments lack research. 1
don't know why she is worried. I am
giving people information they have
been asking for. In a way, I am doing
her job for her. We are all in this to
gether. after all.
At 5:30 in the afternoon, on a

clear day. there is something very
pleasant about biking through the
arcades — the echoing whirr of
wheels in the quiet of near-dusk. I
never used to appreciate that, before
the bicycle ban. We always forget the
little joys until they are gone. I do
not think Hennessy and Powers
have ever biked through the arcades
ot the Quad. That is a shame.
I'm finished with the bicycle ban.
Hut check this shit. All it took to get
a meeting with the tricking Dean of
Students was a bunch of scrawls on
binder paper laid on the President's
doorstep. That is pretty cool. Some
one will listen, if you are devoted, or
absurd, enough to trv.

/barren Franich will never write about
the Bicycle Ban again. Don 't bother
emailing him at dfranich@stanford
.edit. By the way. President llen
nessy's office is in Building 10.
1 was still angry about the bike ban. I decid
ed to leave President Hennessy three
notes a day. I'd tear out a piece of binder
paper, jot a little anti-bike-ban screed and
slip it under his door. Plus I sent him regular
emails. Occasionally, I asked him what his fa
vorite flavor of ice cream was. 1 thought I'd
charm the secretaries who delete I iennessy s
junk mail.
Then I got an email from Dean of Stu
dents Maureen Powers. She wanted to meet
with me. Powers is new to Stanford. Last
month she told The Daily, "Stanford has a
tradition of involving students with decision
making, and I hope to ...always keep students
at the forefront of the decision-making
process." That is quite a thing to say. and she
was upholding her promise by talking to me.
She explained why the ban was created. A
Pedestrian Review Group installed it for two
reasons: 1) significant egress concerns, with
the preponderance of parked bikes blocking
emergency exit zones and causing lots of
"bumps and scratches," and 2) concerns for
"people with accessibility issues."
I asked her who was on the Pedestrian Re
view Group and what kind of research they
had conducted. I asked her exactly how often
people were injured. "All the time," she said,
repeating "bumps and scratches." She indi
cated that people were walking into parked
bikes, which is frankly impossible to imagine

in the physical universe we inhabit.
In fact. Powers admitted that she found
the security argument less convincing than
the issue of increasing accessibility for peo
ple with accessibility issues. In my experi
ence. bikers tend to give more leeway to peo
ple with such difficulties. Apparently, there
were too many bikes parked in the arcades,
and these people could not get through. I low
many hikes were there? She did not know.
She threw out the number "400 or 800,"
which is not exactly precise. Her arguments
made sense,but where were the facts? Where
was the research?
I asked for something concrete — com
plaints. statistics, the numbers of people with
accessibility issues, anything that actually
happened to directly motivate the ban. She
asked me. "Darren, if even one person with
accessibility problems has more accessibility
now. isn't that enough?"
I didn't say this to Powers,because she is a

smart woman and she offered me a bagel, but
that has to be the biggest load of horse shit 1
have ever heard. It is not an argument, it's a
U2 song. She was talking down to me. which
is not uncommon for our administrators.
112 ollow this "even one person" argument,
and you reach absurdity. If even one person
hikes across grass and trips over unsteady
ground, will we have security monitoring all
the grass? It even one person climbs on the
( law, falls oil, and breaks his leg, will there be
security preventing all fountain hopping that
isn t an Absolute Fun event? Sound ludi
crous.' The bike ban sounded just as ludi
crous in May.
I decided to try pragmatism. Let us start
Irom the presumption that bicycle accidents
are a problem. (I do not think they are, be
cause accidents will always happen.) In an in
terview with Ibe Daily, Sergeant Al James of
Public Safety (who also hadn't seen any sta
tistics) noted that if bikers "aren't riding in
the arcades, they would probably have to be
in the pedestrian malls." 1 wish James had
been on the Pedestrian Review Board, be
cause that makes serious sense.
I sketched the Quad for Powers, with a cir
cle representing the Intersection of Death,
though we all know that it is actually a
rhombellahedron. colloquially known as a


Franich

Ire and Vice
"clusterfuck." With more traffic in
that area, there would be even less
accessibility for physically disabled
people, not to mention a general
decrease in security. Whereas be
fore bikers were equally distributed
in the arcades and the street, now
the main entranceway is that tiny
gateway on the Education Building
side barely big enough for a suck
ling pig.
This was probably my best argu
ment. By coincidence, just as I was in
the middle of it. Powers' assistant
walked in and said that she was late
for a meeting. 1 begged Powers to
consider the Intersection of Death,
how it was bad for both security
AND accessibility: how by solving
one problem poorly, the administra
tion was creating several more; how
she is new and can change things and
she needs to make them understand
that they can't just keep taking
things away from us; how we need a
dialogue. "I'll look into it," she said,
proving that life actually is like the
