## Cardinal swing through SoCal Sixth-ranked women's volleyball faces tough road blocks at No. 4 Southern California, No. 5 UCLA 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
With five teams ranked among the top 10
in the nation, the Pacific-10 Conference offers
little room for error for the No. 6 Stanford
women's volleyball team.
Just one week after an impressive win
over No. 7 California, the Cardinal (13-2,4-1
Pac-10) must travel to Los Angeles this
weekend for crucial conference match-ups
against No. 4 Southern California and No 3
UCLA.
Head coach John Dunning said his
squad's performance against the Bears last
weekend will provide positive momentum
heading into two of the season's toughest
matches.
"I'm really surprised we won the match the
way we did," Dunning said. "Confidence
comes from doing good things and playing
well consistently, like we did last weekend.
And we'll need that confidence on the road
this week."
Dunning described the Cal match as Stan
ford's best of the year — and rightfully so.
The Cardinal hit a whopping .354 as a team,
en route to the easy 30-20.30-22,30-21 victo
ry-
Sophomore Cynthia Barboza paces the
Cardinal's offense with 4.59 kills per game for
a .313 hitting percentage. Fellow-sophomore
Foluke Akinradewo is hitting .430 with 3.76
kills per game.
Stanford meets the Women of Troy (17-0,
6-0 Pac-10) tonight at the grand opening of
the new Galen Center at 7 p.m. USC nabbed
a tense, five-game win over Arizona State last
weekend before sweeping Arizona one day
later, despite hitting under .200 against the
Wildcats. Asia Kaczor leads the Trojans with a
.300 hitting percentage and 4.48 kills per
game.

"I don't know that USC has a weakness,"
Dunning said. "They've got a lot of new play
ers. but system-wise, they're as tough as they
were last year."
As a team, the Women of Troy are hitting
.266 while holding opponents to .133. USC re
turns three starters after having lost Ail-
American middle blocker Bibiana Candelas
to graduation.
The Cardinal took both matches from
USC last season by margins of 3-0 and 3-2.
Stanford then drives down the road for a
match-up against the Bruins (19-0, 6-0 Pac
-10) tomorrow at 7 p.m. UCLA also swept the
Arizona schools last weekend. Senior Nana
Mariwether leads the Bruins offense, hitting
.509 with 4.05 kills per game. UCLA is hitting
.252 for the season while allowing opponents
to hit just .152.
The Cardinal swept the season series last
year.
"UCLA is a team that came out of the gate
really quickly this season," Dunning said.
"They seem to make a lot of mistakes, but
they force others to make mistakes as well.
They've been playing at a consistently hard
level and have really improved over the past
two weeks."
Both USC and UCLA defeated No. 5
Washington — one of only two squads to
collect a win over Stanford so far in 2006.
None of the conference's top five teams
(UCLA, USC, Washington. Stanford and
California) have yet to lose at home, but the
Cardinal are hoping to change that streak
this weekend.
"It's a weird situation playing two unde
feated teams in your conference during the
same weekend," Dunning said. "They've
both had great wins so far, and we'll defi
nitely have our hands full. It's a chance for
us to play great volleyball against great
teams."
