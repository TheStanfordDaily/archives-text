# MEN'S SOCCER
## Washington, OSU look for revenge after last week's sweep Stanford hosts Pac-10 rivals following successful weekend in the Pacific Northwest 
### HALEY MURPHY 
After managing their road sweep over Wash
ington and Oregon State last weekend, the
Stanford men's soccer team returns home this
week for rematches against both squads.

The Cardinal (5-4-3,3-0-1 Pac-10) have won
six of their last seven games, and coach Bret
Simon said the team is excited heading into the
weekend.
"1 expect the matches to be close and com
petitive," Simon said. "There is always an inter
esting dynamic when you play a team twice in
such a tight time frame. We'll have to be at our
best to get results against Washington and Ore
gon State, who are both talented and well
coached teams."
The Cardinal will first encounter the

Huskies (8-4,1-4 Pac-10) in what many consider
Stanford's most important game of the season.
Washington missed their star offensive play
er Kevin Forrest in Stanford's 2-0 win on Oct. 6,
and the I luskics will try to earn their way back
into the national rankings with help from a tele
vised game at Maloney Field.
Forrest, who leads the I luskics with 10 goals
on the season, may be cleared to play in the
Stanford rematch after missing the last two
games with a knee injury. Regardless of For
rest's role on Friday, however, Simon said he

hopes the Cardinal will remain focused on their
own performances.
"Ultimately, we can't control who lines up
opposite us." Simon said. "So we'll prepare to
play our best no matter who our opponents put
on the field."
Pac-10 play will continue with the Beavers'
visit to Stanford on Sunday at noon. Oregon
State (5-7-1, 0-5 Pac-10) will try to repeat its
2005 victory at Maloney, where they captured a
3-1 decision. Senior forward Robbie
Findley leads the Beavers offensively
with five goals, though he has not
scored in the past five games.
Senior Bret Shimizu, who scored
in Stanford's 2-0 win against Oregon
State on Oct. 8, recognizes that other
factors will also contribute to the
Cardinal's success this weekend. I le
notes the importance of playing at
home in tough competitions.
"There is a huge advantage play
ing at home," Shimizu said. "The
home crowd is a big factor. I think
after the San Diego State game [a 2-1
win with 1.784 fans in attendance],
we'll get a good crowd, and that will
help us get amped for the game. It
boosts our confidence to play in front
of friends and family"
With momentum in Stanford's
favor, wins this weekend might help
to propel the Cardinal in the coming
weeks' games against UCLA and
California — the teams closest to de
throning Stanford's lead position in
the Pac-10.The men will rely on their
training, concentration and recent
wins as they strive for victory on the
pitch once more.
"Neither game will be an easy
win," Shimizu said. "We will have to
play at our best to come out with two
victories again. Both teams will defi
nitely come out with great intensity,
and we will have to counter with
more [intensity]."
