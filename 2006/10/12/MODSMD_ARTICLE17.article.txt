# MEN'S SOCCER
## Washington, OSU look for revenge after last week's sweep Stanford hosts Pac-10 rivals following successful weekend in the Pacific Northwest 
### HALEY MURPHY 
After managing their road sweep over Wash
ington and Oregon State last weekend, the
Stanford men's soccer team returns home this
week for rematches against both squads.

The Cardinal (5-4-3,3-0-1 Pac-10) have won
six of their last seven games, and coach Bret

Forrest, who leads the I luskics with 10 goals
on the season, may be cleared to play in the

play our best no matter who our opponents put
on the field."
Pac-10 play will continue with the Beavers'
visit to Stanford on Sunday at noon. Oregon

2005 victory at Maloney, where they captured a
