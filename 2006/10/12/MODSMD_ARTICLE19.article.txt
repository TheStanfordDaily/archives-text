# Through My Eyes: Lea MacKinnon
## 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
The Daily continues the "Through
My Eyes" series this week with
sophomore Lea MacKinnon. Al
though this midfielder is not a big talker
off the field, she took a few moments to
discuss her recent breakout, the team
and the Pacific-10 Conference.
MacKinnon began her Stanford ca
reer with a strong start, playing in 17
games her freshman year. She built on
these performances and broke out of
her shell this season by tallying three as
sists in the first five games of the season.
TWo of her assists helped the Cardinal
(7-5-1,0-1-1 Pac-10) in wins against Cal-
Poly and Long Island University.
In addition, MacKinnon recorded
her first collegiate goal against San
Diego State shortly after, putting an end
to nearly 25 minutes of scoreless play in
the second half, contributing to a 4-0
shut-out over the Aztecs.
With five goals so far this season,
MacKinnon is fourth on the team, and
has significantly contributed to a soccer
program that has consistently been
among the best in the country. However,

this hard-working sophomore does
not have a background of soccer â€”
she comes from a hockey family
Her father and two uncles played
collegiate and professional hockey
Growing up in a hockey family
"My dad and all of his brothers
played hockey their entire lives,so I
think 1 was bound to play for at least
a couple years. There wasn't much
hockey in Arizona, so it didn't last
too long 1 played for about three or
four years, and then just played for
fun every once in a while. I tried
about every sport at least for a while
when I was younger and ended up
sticking with soccer. I liked it the
most out of the ones 1 tried, and it
was probablv the easiest to partici
pate in as a youngster."
Scoring her first collegiate goal
"Scoring a goal is always great,
and finally getting one in college
was exciting. 1 tried not to think
about how long it had been to score
a goal, because extra pressure defi
nitely doesn't help you with some
thing like that. 1 just tried to go out
there and have fun, hoping that it
would come sometime soon. I guess
some things take longer than you
would like, but you have to just keep
plugging away and eventually it will
come."
The Pac-10
"Hopefully, we continue to im
prove in every game during Pac-10
play How we do in our conference
will determine if and where we get
placed in the NCAA Tournament.
We need to perform well and win
games in the upcoming weeks so we
can peak if and when we get into the
tournament. And of course it's al
ways nice to win. so winning the
Pac-10 championship would also be
a great accomplishment"
A changing team dynamic
"We are much younger this year
than we were last year. 1 think there
are around twice as many under
classmen as upperclassmen. We are
definitely still getting used to each
other, but it is starting to come to
gether right in time for Pac-10 play.
The team is really close, which is a lot
of fun and helps when we are out on
the field as well. Everyone is focused,
and we all have the same goals for
the season, which should help us in
the important games coming up."
The big weekend
"We have played pretty well, but
we haven't always gotten the results
we wanted and needed. It's good to
play well, but at this point in the sea
son, we need to start winning big
games. USC and UCLA were both
very good teams, but we could have
finished our chances better and the
outcome definitely could have been
different. Home games are always
different, and the atmosphere here
is a lot of fun. It's great to play in
front of a home crowd, especially
for conference games. We have a
doubleheader with the men's team
on both Friday and Sunday, which
also makes it a lot of fun."
