# STUDENT PUBLICATIONS
## At Leland, a literary success story New literary magazine says diversity in selections is key 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With more than 8(X) copies distributed since
its first volume was printed last month, the Ice
land Quarterly — a new campus literary maga
zine — appears to have overcome the tough
odds that face most fledgling student publica
tions.
"Hie reaction thus far has been very posi
tive," said junior Annie Wyman, an editor of the
magazine. "There was a lot of excitement over
our first issue, and just as much at the idea of
starting up again."
In addition to an extensive selection of fic
tion and poetry, the magazine includes artistic
reviews, political analyses and photography.
Junior Bob Borek. founder and editor of Ice
land Quarterly, hopes that students will see the
publication as a creative escape from their
classroom lives. In contrast to other literary
magazines, Borek said the Leland Quarterly
aims to bring students from various academic
backgrounds into the creative process.
"I think the effort being made with Leland
to connect with a variety of Stanford students
and draw them into the creative community is
much stronger than that of previous literary
magazines," Borek said. "Rather than simply
acting as a forum for creative work. Leland at
tempts to attract people to that forum. Our
thought is that we will not simply be recording
campus culture, but actively creating it."
The project, which receives funding from
the ASSU as well as both the Creative Writing
and PWR Departments, was conceived last
winter when then-sophomores Borek, Becca
Jacobs, Fran Guan and Nick Hoy noticed the
lack of writing outlets on campus.
"The magazine emerged to fill a void creat
ed by the disbandment of other established lit
erary magazines such as Word Choice and The
Mind's Eye," said senior Steven Tagle, a con
tributing writer for the magazine.
The aim was to create a publication that
would explore a variety of different writing
styles and subjects.
"The goal of putting several different types
of writing alongside each other is that someone
who is attracted to an article on. say, rhetoric in
political campaigns, might also stumble across a
poem that they never would have read other
wise. but can relate to and enjoy," Borek said.
Wyman attributes much of the magazine's
appeal to this broad range of topics.
"Leland's goal is to be 'general interest' for
every smart kid at Stanford, not just the ones
who like short stories and poetry."
Wyman said. "The Mind's Eye and
many other literary magazines are
showcases of creative work, a useful
function, but to me, Leland signifies
something a little different. It's an at
tempt to communicate, not just ex
hibit."
Literary magazines at Stanford
have experienced a lack of funding
and submissions in the past, but the
founders of Leland said they are con
fident that the wide variety of writing
opportunities will prevent these
problems.
" ITie writing community at Stan
ford is exceptionally strong, and
finding content for Leland should
never be difficult," Borek said. "Ad
ditionally, the variety of writing in
Leland along with the fact that it
comes out only once a quarter al
lows the magazine to be highly se
lective with the material that gets
submitted."
Eavan Boland, director of the
Creative Writing Department, ac
knowledged the difficulties of run
ning a student literary magazine, but

said she believed in the Leland Quar
terly's ability to make an impact on
campus.
"Success is a variable in terms of
student magazines," Boland said.
"But if by success we mean bringing
something vital and energetic and full
of talent and interest into the Stan
ford community then 1 have no doubt
at all this will be a success."
While the creative writing com
munity tends to get overshadowed by
Stanford's strong emphasis on sci
ence and engineering, staff and facul
ty associated with the Leland Quar
terly are confident the magazine will
shed light on the literary community
and opportunities on campus.
"The creative writing community
at Stanford is one of the University's
best-kept secrets," Tagle said. "Many
techie majors take creative writing
classes because if fulfills a basic
hunger for storytelling, a need that
can't be satisfied in any other way."
Boland said she was less con
cerned with the visibility of the de
partment than its availability
"I want students to know they can
come to creative writing," she said.
"They can take workshops. They can
learn the craft — whichever one it is.
And that their dreams of writing and
expression are just a short distance
away on this campus."
