With more than 8(X) copies distributed since
its first volume was printed last month, the Ice
land Quarterly — a new campus literary maga
zine — appears to have overcome the tough
odds that face most fledgling student publica

"Hie reaction thus far has been very posi

erary magazines such as Word Choice and The
Mind's Eye," said senior Steven Tagle, a con

The aim was to create a publication that
would explore a variety of different writing
styles and subjects.
"The goal of putting several different types
of writing alongside each other is that someone
who is attracted to an article on. say, rhetoric in
political campaigns, might also stumble across a
poem that they never would have read other
wise. but can relate to and enjoy," Borek said.
Wyman attributes much of the magazine's
appeal to this broad range of topics.
"Leland's goal is to be 'general interest' for
