# Rodriguez trade could prove costly
## 
### 
Honestly, 1 didn't want to do it.
I've been fighting this urge all
week. I even went so far as to
sketeh out some ideas for other things
to write about.
But no. this column has to be about
A-Rod.
I'm conflicted for simple reasons,
really. The attitude of George Stein
brenner, who believes that six years
without a championship is far too long,
magnified by the media that goes
along with the idea. Drumming up
hype about how many heads will have
to roll belittles the situation so many
other teams face. The Cubs have been
waiting for a championship since 1908,
the Indians since 1948, and the Giants
since 1954.
Why six years is too long for New
York I'll never be able to compre
hend. though I certainly do under
stand the frustrations over the team
with the highest payroll in baseball
exiting the postseason so meekly. But
it is baseball,and these things happen.
In a sport where you can be paid mil
lions of dollars for getting a hit in
three of 10 tries, everyone is going to
go cold occasionally.
Which is exactly why I'm praying
Alex Rodriguez is traded this offsea
son.
I low did the Yankees fans, players
and management do it? Somehow,
they've turned A-Rod from national
villain to hero-in-waiting. Rodriguez
was the athlete most associated with the
word "overpaid." 1 le perpetrated that
ridiculous running slap to knock the ball
from Bronson Arroyo's glove in the
2004 ALCS. He's always carried the
perceived stigma of being a phony with
the media. Supporting evidence for this
notion came with his identity crisis prior
to the World Baseball Classic when he
couldn't decide whether to play for the
Dominican Republic or U.S.
Moreover, he was playing for the
Yankees. Through no real fault of his
own. he was suddenly linked to the so
called "F.vil Empire" and one of its
most characteristically "evil" acts.'llie
trade that sent him to New York added
yet another star caliber player to a line
up that was brimming with them, the
final straw for many on the "Yankee
hater" fence.
And so. A-Rod became a villain,
standing for everything Yankee-haters
