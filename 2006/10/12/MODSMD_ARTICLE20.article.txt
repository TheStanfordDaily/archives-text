# Rodriguez trade could prove costly
## 
### 
Honestly, 1 didn't want to do it.
I've been fighting this urge all
week. I even went so far as to
sketeh out some ideas for other things
to write about.
But no. this column has to be about
A-Rod.
I'm conflicted for simple reasons,
really. The attitude of George Stein
brenner, who believes that six years
without a championship is far too long,
magnified by the media that goes
along with the idea. Drumming up
hype about how many heads will have
to roll belittles the situation so many
other teams face. The Cubs have been
waiting for a championship since 1908,
the Indians since 1948, and the Giants
since 1954.
Why six years is too long for New
York I'll never be able to compre
hend. though I certainly do under
stand the frustrations over the team
with the highest payroll in baseball
exiting the postseason so meekly. But
it is baseball,and these things happen.
In a sport where you can be paid mil
lions of dollars for getting a hit in
three of 10 tries, everyone is going to
go cold occasionally.
Which is exactly why I'm praying
Alex Rodriguez is traded this offsea
son.
I low did the Yankees fans, players
and management do it? Somehow,
they've turned A-Rod from national
villain to hero-in-waiting. Rodriguez
was the athlete most associated with the
word "overpaid." 1 le perpetrated that
ridiculous running slap to knock the ball
from Bronson Arroyo's glove in the
2004 ALCS. He's always carried the
perceived stigma of being a phony with
the media. Supporting evidence for this
notion came with his identity crisis prior
to the World Baseball Classic when he
couldn't decide whether to play for the
Dominican Republic or U.S.
Moreover, he was playing for the
Yankees. Through no real fault of his
own. he was suddenly linked to the so
called "F.vil Empire" and one of its
most characteristically "evil" acts.'llie
trade that sent him to New York added
yet another star caliber player to a line
up that was brimming with them, the
final straw for many on the "Yankee
hater" fence.
And so. A-Rod became a villain,
standing for everything Yankee-haters

I
despise: the clean-cut image; the
money he receives as a Gold Glove
shortstop to play third base; the seem
ingly disingenuous indecision on
which of his cultural identities he
would champion in the Classic. But
then the most amazing thing hap
pened — New Yorkers themselves de
cided to vilify him.
As the capstone to George Stein
brenner's recent strategy of recon
structing Murderer's Row with over
priced clean-up hitters (namely: Jason
Giambi and Gary Sheffield), Ro
driguez took the blame when the Yan
kees and that offense sputtered. New
York fans and media jumped all over
him. One disastrous playoff series

against the Tigers later, and A-Rod is
poised to bo the sacrifice offered up to
a rabid fan base.
And here's where things get inter
esting: If Rodriguez becomes a villain
in New York, then he's a hero for Yan
kee-haters everywhere, assuming he
makes the Yankees pay after he's trad
ed. Any success he has — every time
he drives in a game-winning run,
breaks another record or helps beat
the Yankees head-to-head — the New
York brass and Boss will look idiotic.
And nothing would please the anti-
New York crowd more.
So please Brian Cashman, find
some sucker out there willing to take a
future 1 fall of Famerand former MVP
off your hands. Steinbrenner, you may
need to pressure your GM into it,
given that Rodriguez is still in his
prime. And all you delusional Yankee
fans and media types: Be sure to keep
up your demands that he simply must

be moved. After all. 14 bad plate ap
pearances this year and a few more be
fore that must be indicative of a play
er's overall worth. Ignore the fact that
as recently as the 2(X)4 ALDS. A-Rod
was carrying your team through the
postseason.
And send him to some team where
a World Series will mean more than the
first in six years. Maybe, if we're all re
ally lucky it can even be some team
that will someday face the Yankees in a
game that matters, and Rodriguez can
try for a little payback. But that doesn't
need to happen for A-Rod to be a hero.
All he needs to do to outdo the
Yankees is do what they said he
couldn't: win.

Denis (iriffhi is probably hoping tlic Gi
ants can replace a washed-up, broken
down Harry Bonds with another over
paid hitter. Email him at djgriff@stan
