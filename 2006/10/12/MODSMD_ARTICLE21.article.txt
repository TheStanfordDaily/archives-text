Dave Whitis told radio station
WGFX.
"He was actually going to take me
up in his plane when he got here,"
Whitis said.
Lidle agreed to a $6.3 million, two
year deal with the Phillies in November
2(X)4. The contract contained a provi
sion saying the team could get out of
paying the remainder if he was injured
or killed while piloting a plane.
Because the regular season was
over, Lidle had already received the
full amount in the contract.
For nearly a decade, Lidle put to
gether a successful career as a major
league pitcher by living on the edge.
Not the hardest thrower, he worked to
the corners.
"Cory was a gambler. He always
tried to take chances," Oakland coach
Ron Washington said Wednesday be
fore the Athletics faced Detroit in the
AL playoffs.
Lidle went 82-72 with a 4.57 ERA in
a career that started in 1997.1 le played
for the New York Mets. Tampa Bay,
Oakland.Toronto.Cincinnati. Philadel
phia and the Yankees.
Still in the minors, Lidle played
one game for the Milwaukee Brew
ers in a 1995 spring training game
while major leaguers were on strike.
That one-inning stint as a replace
ment player haunted him later in his
career, and Lidle was taunted as a
"scab" by Phillies pitcher Arthur
Rhodes after being traded to the
Yankees on July 30.
ITien Lidle was dropped from
the Yankees' postseason rotation,
reduced to a relief role instead of
starting in the surprising four-game
loss to Detroit. After the defeat,
Lidle was quoted as saying the Yan

kees weren't as prepared as the
Tigers.
On Tuesday, aware that he was get
ting criticized on WFAN radio, he
called the station to defend himself.
What ensued was a testy interview,
with Lidle insisting his comments
were not directed at manager Joe
Torre.
"All I ever said was that they came
more ready to play than us. They won
that series. They outpitched us, they
outhit us, they outfielded us. They
were more ready to play than we
were," Lidle said on WFAN.
"1 want to win as much as anybody.
But what am 1 supposed to do? Go cry
in my apartment for the next two
weeks?"
Lidle said he was sure the Yankees
weren't happy about his plane, but
added that no one in the organization
had said anything to him about it.
Players flying airplanes is a trou
bling topic for the Yankees.Team cap
tain Thurman Munson was killed fly
ing his own plane during the 1979 sea
son in Ohio, and his catcher's gear still
hangs in a special spot in the Yankees'
clubhouse.
"This is a terrible shock," Torre

said. "I was with (coaches) Ron
Guidry and Lee Mazzilli when I heard
the news and we were just stunned.
Cory's time with the Yankees was
short, but he was a good teammate
and a great competitor. My heart goes
out to his family."
Lidle played in high school with
Jason Giambi, and they became team
mates on the Yankees this season.
"Right now. 1 am really in a state
of shock, as 1 am sure the entire MLB
family is," Giambi said in a state
ment.
"My thoughts are with Cory's rela
tives and the loved ones of the others
who were injured or killed in this
plane crash. 1 have known Cory and
his wife, Melanie, for over 18 years and
watched his son grow up. We played
high school ball together and have re
mained close throughout our careers.
We were excited to be reunited in New
York this year and I am just devastat
ed to hear this news," he said.
Lidle had a 6-year-old son, Christo
pher.
Lidle said he liked to fly around in
the offseason to see family and friends,
especially his brother, a former minor
league player, in Florida.

Dave Whitis told radio station
WGFX.
"He was actually going to take me
up in his plane when he got here,"
Whitis said.
Lidle agreed to a $6.3 million, two
year deal with the Phillies in November
2(X)4. The contract contained a provi
sion saying the team could get out of
paying the remainder if he was injured
or killed while piloting a plane.
Because the regular season was
over, Lidle had already received the
full amount in the contract.
For nearly a decade, Lidle put to
gether a successful career as a major
league pitcher by living on the edge.
Not the hardest thrower, he worked to
the corners.
"Cory was a gambler. He always
tried to take chances," Oakland coach
Ron Washington said Wednesday be
fore the Athletics faced Detroit in the
AL playoffs.
Lidle went 82-72 with a 4.57 ERA in
a career that started in 1997.1 le played
for the New York Mets. Tampa Bay,
Oakland.Toronto.Cincinnati. Philadel
phia and the Yankees.
Still in the minors, Lidle played
one game for the Milwaukee Brew
ers in a 1995 spring training game
while major leaguers were on strike.
That one-inning stint as a replace
ment player haunted him later in his
career, and Lidle was taunted as a
"scab" by Phillies pitcher Arthur
Rhodes after being traded to the
Yankees on July 30.
ITien Lidle was dropped from
the Yankees' postseason rotation,
reduced to a relief role instead of
starting in the surprising four-game
loss to Detroit. After the defeat,
Lidle was quoted as saying the Yan

kees weren't as prepared as the
Tigers.
On Tuesday, aware that he was get
ting criticized on WFAN radio, he
called the station to defend himself.
What ensued was a testy interview,
with Lidle insisting his comments
were not directed at manager Joe
Torre.
"All I ever said was that they came
more ready to play than us. They won
that series. They outpitched us, they
outhit us, they outfielded us. They
were more ready to play than we
were," Lidle said on WFAN.
"1 want to win as much as anybody.
But what am 1 supposed to do? Go cry
in my apartment for the next two
weeks?"
Lidle said he was sure the Yankees
weren't happy about his plane, but
added that no one in the organization
had said anything to him about it.
Players flying airplanes is a trou
bling topic for the Yankees.Team cap
tain Thurman Munson was killed fly
ing his own plane during the 1979 sea
son in Ohio, and his catcher's gear still
hangs in a special spot in the Yankees'
clubhouse.
"This is a terrible shock," Torre

said. "I was with (coaches) Ron
Guidry and Lee Mazzilli when I heard
the news and we were just stunned.
Cory's time with the Yankees was
short, but he was a good teammate
and a great competitor. My heart goes
out to his family."
Lidle played in high school with
Jason Giambi, and they became team
mates on the Yankees this season.
"Right now. 1 am really in a state
of shock, as 1 am sure the entire MLB
family is," Giambi said in a state
ment.
"My thoughts are with Cory's rela
tives and the loved ones of the others
who were injured or killed in this
plane crash. 1 have known Cory and
his wife, Melanie, for over 18 years and
watched his son grow up. We played
high school ball together and have re
mained close throughout our careers.
We were excited to be reunited in New
York this year and I am just devastat
ed to hear this news," he said.
Lidle had a 6-year-old son, Christo
pher.
Lidle said he liked to fly around in
the offseason to see family and friends,
especially his brother, a former minor
league player, in Florida.

Former Philly and Yankee pitcher Cory Lidle and a friend were killed when Lidle
crashed his small plane into a building in New York.
NEW YORK (AP) — Criticized by

self back home to California once the
Yankees lost in the playoffs.
Instead, the 34-year-old Yankees
pitcher was killed along with a second
person Wednesday when his small
plane crashed into a 40-story sky
scraper in Manhattan.
"This is a terrible and shocking
tragedy that has stunned the entire
Yankees organization." Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner said in a
statement.
Said commissioner Bud Selig: "All
of baseball is shocked and terribly sad
dened by the sudden and tragic pass
ing of Cory Lidle."
Lidle got his pilot's license last off
season, bought his own plane and tried
to spend every spare moment in the
air.
"Yeah, it's risky, but no more risky
than driving a car." he said in August.
A friend of Lidle's said the pitcher had
phoned earlier Wednesday to say he
would stop in Nashville. Tenn.. on his
way to California.
"He called me about 11:30 this
morning ... and said that he was still
planning on coming in. that there were
some weather cells around Nashville
and that he had a flight instructor with
him and that they'd be in about 5,"
