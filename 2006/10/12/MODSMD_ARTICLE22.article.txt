# Hate speech and violence
## 
### 
Dues the word "faggot" make you uncomfort
able? Imagine hearing it roared at you
through the window of a speeding car as
you're approaching the French House for a night of
revelry.
Let's rewind a bit. Last week, my co-columnist Vinni
wrote about missing an opportunity he had to speak up
against homophobia. Last weekend, he got the chance
to speak up, and he got pushed down in return.
Ilie car rolled by while the three teenagers inside
screamed "faggot' repeatedly. I shrugged and contin
ued on my w;iy. but Vinni spoke up. asking them (but
perhaps not very politely) to come back and say it to his
face. And they did.
'I'hey drove back, got out of their car and got in our
faces. They continued their ritualistic chanting of "fag"
until Vinni courteously confirmed their suspicions that
he was, in fact, gay (a surprise to no one who has ever
seen Vinni).They pushed him into the road and sped off
in their cars, while I related the license plate number of
their vehicle to a 911 dispatcher.
Moments later, a policeman arrived and took our
statements. Hie teenagers in question were stopped by
other friendly police-folk, and we were given a joyride
in the back of a police car to go identify them.
Not the greatest way to spend a Saturday night.The
guy who pushed Vinni was cited with a hate crime. Vinni
survived. Bharat was irritated.
So he spoke up. And what can we learn from this lit
tle episode?
L very one always talks about how Stanford is such a
safe place. When something like this happens, that bub
ble is burst. Violence and homophobia come pout ing in.
and Stanford is no longer such a safe space. 1 low do we
resolve this contradiction and handle these momentary
hiccups in Stanford's safety level?
Typically, we find a way of externalizing the violence.
In this case, the homophobes were not Stanford stu
dents. They came from the infamous "outside world." II
we can imagine them as being outsiders, as pieces of the
outside world that accidentally got on campus and that
can be just as easily removed, we can keep Stanford
"safe."
But how do we keep them out? One policeman in
formed us that the next time we see "suspicious charac
ters" on campus, we should call the police immediately.
What does "suspicious" mean? People of color? People
who drive an old car?

So by keeping Stanford separate from the real world,
we can keep the forces of evil out and maintain our
Edenic Utopia. Unfortunately, this is the same policy
that the Hush administration has employed in dealing
with "terrorism" — by placing the blame on outsiders,
on "suspicious strangers," and taking the violence to
their door. I las the amount of violence in the world as a
whole come down? Of course not —just take one look
at Afghanistan. Iraq. Lebanon and Sudan. Has the vio
lence in the United States gone down? Many would like
to think so.
Now we've figured something out. Safety isn't about
safety for everyone — it's about keeping us safe. We
don't care about violence and hatred as long as it occurs
somewhere else, safely removed from our homes and
our schools. A hate crime citation is not going to make
this kid stop hating LGBT people. If his community is
telling him that hate speech and violence against gay
men is acceptable, a citation is not going to change that .
People can rarely overcome the power of their environ
ment.
We have learned that since we have money, privilege
and a great police force, we can keep violence out. Our
juvenile offender has learned that it's better to attack
people who don't have access to money, privilege and a
police force. And the world, finally, is not a safer place.
Just safer for us.
I'm not advocating terror warnings or fear tactics.
I'm asking you to keep in mind that the Stanford bub
ble will always follow people with wealth or privilege.
It's important to figure out what's outside that bubble
and do something about it. Otherwise, your bubble
might get forcibly popped.
