# WINNERS AGREE THAT PRIORTY ON RESEARCH WILL NOT CHANGE
## Nobel duo to sail steady Laureates share tales of the phone calls that changed their lives 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
For Prof. Andrew Fire and Prof.
Roger Kornberg, the 2(X)6 Nobel Prize
laureates in Medicine and Chemistry
respectively, last week's early morning
phone calls first seemed like an annoy
ing misdial.
Kornberg had just arrived home
from Israel last Wednesday when the
phone rang at 2:30 a.m. Jolted awake
from what were his first few moments
of sleep in 48 hours, Kornberg was
stunned to hear that he'd won the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his contri
butions to DNA transcription.
"1 didn't have any first thoughts," he
said in an interview with The Daily "I
was initially bewildered."
Little did he know, that would be
end of his sleep for the night. Within 15
minutes of the official announcement,
the press corps was clogging his phone
line.
Two days earlier, Fire had received a
similar call." 1 thought it was a mistake,"
he said. "1 was not sure 1 was awake."
Fire, whose interest in science began
in middle school baking soda and vine
gar experiments, soon realized the call
was real. His work with a method called
"gene silencing" had earned him the
Nobel Prize in Medicine.
