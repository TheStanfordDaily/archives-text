# WINNERS AGREE THAT PRIORTY ON RESEARCH WILL NOT CHANGE
## Nobel duo to sail steady Laureates share tales of the phone calls that changed their lives 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
For Prof. Andrew Fire and Prof.
Roger Kornberg, the 2(X)6 Nobel Prize
laureates in Medicine and Chemistry
respectively, last week's early morning
phone calls first seemed like an annoy
ing misdial.
Kornberg had just arrived home
from Israel last Wednesday when the
phone rang at 2:30 a.m. Jolted awake
from what were his first few moments
of sleep in 48 hours, Kornberg was
stunned to hear that he'd won the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his contri
butions to DNA transcription.
"1 didn't have any first thoughts," he
said in an interview with The Daily "I
was initially bewildered."
Little did he know, that would be
end of his sleep for the night. Within 15
minutes of the official announcement,
the press corps was clogging his phone
line.
Two days earlier, Fire had received a
similar call." 1 thought it was a mistake,"
he said. "1 was not sure 1 was awake."
Fire, whose interest in science began
in middle school baking soda and vine
gar experiments, soon realized the call
was real. His work with a method called
"gene silencing" had earned him the
Nobel Prize in Medicine.

Professors Andrew Fire (right) and Roger Kornberg (left), this year's Nobel laureates for Medicine and Chemistry, respectively, say they will push on
with ongoing research and try to stay focused after their life-changing awards.
A week after the surprise, both pro
fessors say they hope to continue with
their lives and work as usual.
"1 plan to do the same work as we
were doing before, which I greatly
enjoy," Romberg said.'i want to press
on. I am certainly not done."
Fire and Romberg both plan to stay
grounded to their research and fami
lies, but it may not be so easy with the
heightened recognition that follows
Nobel laureates.
"It seems the best time to get the
Nobel Prize is when you're about to re
tire," said Physics Prof. Douglas Os
heroff, who won the award for physics
in 19%.
Osheroff said it can be hard to find
the balance between research, teach
ing and lecture invitations from presi
dents, kings and institutions around
the world. While he said it is always a
great experience to travel to exotic
places and reach out to young scien
tists, Osheroff had one piece of advice
to pass on to Stanford's two new win
ners:
"You have to learn to say 'no' at
times," he said.

For Fire, a modest and soft-spoken
Sunnyvale native, the week has been a
wild ride, but he said he is ready to take
up the extra responsibility.
"It's nice that Nobel Prize win
ners have the chance to promote the
science that's being done in the com
munity and bring it to the attention of
the public and Congress," he said.
"People listen to you. I think of it as
not exactly a burden, but a challenge."
The two professors say the road to
the Nobel is found in vital intellectual
curiosity, hard work and a bit of luck.
"Do whatever you do just as well
as you possibly can," Romberg said.
"After that, some people get lucky."
Fire emphasized that significant
contributions to science were made by
the collaboration of many minds.
"Listen to your colleagues, listen to
your students and other people
around you who have ideas and ques
tions," he said. "Science is a mix of
craft and questions. The craft comes
from years of experience, but the
questions don't."
So what more can you do when

I want to press on. I am certainly not done.
ROGER KORNBERG, Nobel Laureate 06

you've already won the most coveted
prize in science?The questions haven't
stopped for Fire.
"On Friday, Sept. 30,1 had a list of
things I wanted to do," Fire said.
" Iliey're still on the agenda. It would
he nice to translate some of the discov
eries to treatments that would help
people. One of the things 1 love about
the Stanford Medical School is the
close connection here between clinical
work and research science."
Kornberg, too, said he would stay
devoted to his research.
"It is certainly my hope nothing will
be very different," he said."l currently
have wonderful circumstances with
my family and my research. I want to
avoid the disruption of my work as
much as possible."
And of the $1.4 million prize
money?
"Well, as I always point out. half of
it goes to the government," Kornberg
said. "The rest will go to my children's
education and, if there's any left over,
maybe we'll replace our 20-year-old
Jalopy."

the public and Congress," he said.
"People listen to you. I think of it as
not exactly a burden, but a challenge."
The two professors say the road to
the Nobel is found in vital intellectual
curiosity, hard work and a bit of luck.
"Do whatever you do just as well
as you possibly can," Romberg said.
"After that, some people get lucky."
Fire emphasized that significant
contributions to science were made by
the collaboration of many minds.
"Listen to your colleagues, listen to
your students and other people
around you who have ideas and ques
tions," he said. "Science is a mix of
craft and questions. The craft comes
from years of experience, but the
questions don't."
So what more can you do when

I want to press on. I am certainly not done.
ROGER KORNBERG, Nobel Laureate 06

you've already won the most coveted
prize in science?The questions haven't
stopped for Fire.
"On Friday, Sept. 30,1 had a list of
things I wanted to do," Fire said.
" Iliey're still on the agenda. It would
he nice to translate some of the discov
eries to treatments that would help
people. One of the things 1 love about
the Stanford Medical School is the
close connection here between clinical
work and research science."
Kornberg, too, said he would stay
devoted to his research.
"It is certainly my hope nothing will
be very different," he said."l currently
have wonderful circumstances with
my family and my research. I want to
avoid the disruption of my work as
much as possible."
And of the $1.4 million prize
money?
"Well, as I always point out. half of
it goes to the government," Kornberg
said. "The rest will go to my children's
education and, if there's any left over,
maybe we'll replace our 20-year-old
Jalopy."
