## ASSU SAYS EARLY GRADES FOR EARLY BIRDS IN COURSE EVALS 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU leaders convened Tuesday night to implement a
new end-of-the-quarter grade viewing policy that will encour
age more students to complete course evaluations on time and
to revisit the door-to-door distribution policy debate.
Starting at the end of this quarter, the Registrar's Office will
enable students to see their grades as soon as they are posted
by instructors â€” provided that students have submitted
course evaluations.The new procedure is designed to encour
age students to complete course evaluations by rewarding
them with speedier receipts of their end-of-quarter grades
