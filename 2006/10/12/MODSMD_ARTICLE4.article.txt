## ASSU SAYS EARLY GRADES FOR EARLY BIRDS IN COURSE EVALS 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU leaders convened Tuesday night to implement a
new end-of-the-quarter grade viewing policy that will encour
age more students to complete course evaluations on time and
to revisit the door-to-door distribution policy debate.
Starting at the end of this quarter, the Registrar's Office will
enable students to see their grades as soon as they are posted
by instructors â€” provided that students have submitted
course evaluations.The new procedure is designed to encour
age students to complete course evaluations by rewarding
them with speedier receipts of their end-of-quarter grades
than students who do not. This does
not mean a delay in grade reports; it
is only a reward for those who punc
tually complete the evaluations.
Additionally, the results of the
door-to-door distribution poll will
he available to ASSU senators as
early as Friday. The tally of the on
line vote will determine which dor
mitories will allo'vv student publica
tions to be distributed to individual
doors, rather than to only dormitory
front doors or common areas.
Afterwards, the Executive Cabi
net members were introduced. For
students looking to get involved
with the ASSU, the Senate an
nounced it is still seeking applica
tions for Executive Aids and Senate
Associates. Finally, the application
for the position of Elections Com
missioner is now available.
