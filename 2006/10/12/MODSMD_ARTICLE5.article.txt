## Democracy for Muslims? Former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister defends democracy abroad 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
The increasing sectarian conflict in Iraq and the rise of
Islamist parties like Hamas and Hezbollah have put
American efforts to democratize the Middle East on hold
and raised doubts among experts and policy makers
about whether democracy is compatible with the Muslim
faith. But in a campus appearance yesterday afternoon,
former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim offered an ardent defense of democracy in the
Muslim world, telling a standing-room-only crowd in

Bechtel Conference Center that "men and women are
born free, even in the Islamic construct."
Alternating between serious and sporting through his
two-hour speech, Ibrahim broached many of the issues
aggravating relations between Islam and the West, in
cluding gender relations, American foreign policy,cultur
al assimilation in Europe and Pope Benedict XYTs re
cent comments about Islam. I lowever, he was most out
spoken regarding his home country — he was a political
prisoner in Malaysia for over four years — and rejected
the race- and religious-based affirmative action policies
that benefit the Malay majority there.
Returning repeatedly to the topic of Muslim democ
racy. Ibrahim drew from historical references and per
sonal experiences, citing the democratic regimes of In-
donesia and Iran of 19505.
"There was no debate then whether democ
racy was compatible with Islam," he said."Fifty
years later, we have our leaders in the Muslim
world telling us we're not ready."
The fundamental nature of democracy and
human rights is universal, Ibrahim empha
sized, adding that problems begin with cultur
al miscommunication.
"We have to debunk and reject the notion,
held by Muslims and non-Muslims alike, that
to support democracy and freedom is to sup
port America,"he said. "And it is important for
Americans to realize democracy is a value
cherished as much by Muslims as it is by Amer
icans.
"Misperceptions are unfortunate," he
added, elaborating on his impressions of
American culture. "This is a country full of
contradictions. The level of sophistication and
intellectual flavor is unparalleled. So why must
people be so prejudiced? Why is misunder
standing so pervasive? To say that Muslims are
entirely anti-America is wrong."
Ibrahim offered scathing criticism of his
fellow Muslims for violent reactions to both
the publication of caricatures of Mohammad
in a Danish newspaper in 2005 and to the
more recent comment by Pope Benedict XVI
referring to elements of Islam as "evil and in
human." The cartoon spawned riots killing
139 in Nigeria, Libya, Pakistan and
Afghanistan, while the Pope's remarks fueled
a maelstrom of controversy, including the
firebombing of Catholic churches throughout
the Middle East and the shooting death of a
nun in Somalia.
"There is a right to disagree but no one has
the right to cause destruction or destroy life,"
he said. "No one has the right to call for the
banning of newspapers."
Acknowledging that his comments were
not necessarily indicative of Islamic public
opinion, he said,"This view may not be shared
by all Muslims, but I am prepared to confront
them."
Ibrahim's penchant for speaking his mind
and sticking to his principles has dogged the
leader through a career of controversy. As a
young Malaysian activist in the 19705, he was

arrested during a student protest and spent 20
months in a detention camp. Following a mete
oric political ascent, he was named Deputy
Prime Minister in 1993, and many expected
that he was Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mo
hammad's chosen successor.
But their relationship turned sour, and in
Sept. 1998 Ibrahim was stripped of party mem
bership and incarcerated under charges of cor
ruption and sodomy.The charges were eventu
ally overturned and he was released in Sept.
2004.
Regarding Malaysian politics today,
Ibrahim expressed distaste toward his nation's
system of bumiputera — a system of econom
ic and social policies designed to favor ethnic-
Malays.
"I reject affirmative action based on race,"
he said. "Our policies should benefit the poor
and the marginalized."
Finally, he described the need for engage
ment between the Islamic world and the West,
criticizing the "extreme" foreign policy of the
United States and its refusal to negotiate with
regimes like Hamas.
"That policy is flawed." he said, adding that
"to refuse to engage is a recipe for disaster."
Ibrahim's talk was one in a series of lectures
sponsored by the Center for Democracy, De
velopment and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) ad
dressing relationships with non-Western cul
tures.
"There's not a topic that I think we need to
pay more attention to as a country, and there's
also not a topic that we're more ignorant about
today." CDDRL Director Michael McFaul
said while introducing Ibrahim.
Stanford's new $4.3 billion capital cam
paign seeks $1.4 billion for multidisciplinary
initiatives, including an International Initiative
aimed at making the University a hub for glob
al problem-solving. Issues pertaining to Islam
and the West. McFaul said, will be primary con
cerns.
"We don't have enough faculty to on cam
pus to discuss these issues," he told ITie Daily
after the event. "Speakers like this are great to
fill in the gaps. Hopefully, 10 years from now
we'll have dozens of faculty that can speak to
[these concerns]."

Anwar Ibrahim, the former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister, differentiates support for
democracy from support for America among Muslims during his talk, "Democracy in the Muslim
World."
The increasing sectarian conflict in Iraq and the rise of
Islamist parties like Hamas and Hezbollah have put
American efforts to democratize the Middle East on hold
and raised doubts among experts and policy makers
about whether democracy is compatible with the Muslim
faith. But in a campus appearance yesterday afternoon,
former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim offered an ardent defense of democracy in the
Muslim world, telling a standing-room-only crowd in

Bechtel Conference Center that "men and women are
born free, even in the Islamic construct."
Alternating between serious and sporting through his
two-hour speech, Ibrahim broached many of the issues
aggravating relations between Islam and the West, in
cluding gender relations, American foreign policy,cultur
al assimilation in Europe and Pope Benedict XYTs re
cent comments about Islam. I lowever, he was most out
spoken regarding his home country — he was a political
prisoner in Malaysia for over four years — and rejected
the race- and religious-based affirmative action policies
that benefit the Malay majority there.
Returning repeatedly to the topic of Muslim democ
racy. Ibrahim drew from historical references and per
sonal experiences, citing the democratic regimes of In-
donesia and Iran of 19505.
"There was no debate then whether democ
racy was compatible with Islam," he said."Fifty
years later, we have our leaders in the Muslim
world telling us we're not ready."
The fundamental nature of democracy and
human rights is universal, Ibrahim empha
sized, adding that problems begin with cultur
al miscommunication.
"We have to debunk and reject the notion,
held by Muslims and non-Muslims alike, that
to support democracy and freedom is to sup
port America,"he said. "And it is important for
Americans to realize democracy is a value
cherished as much by Muslims as it is by Amer
icans.
"Misperceptions are unfortunate," he
added, elaborating on his impressions of
American culture. "This is a country full of
contradictions. The level of sophistication and
intellectual flavor is unparalleled. So why must
people be so prejudiced? Why is misunder
standing so pervasive? To say that Muslims are
entirely anti-America is wrong."
Ibrahim offered scathing criticism of his
fellow Muslims for violent reactions to both
the publication of caricatures of Mohammad
in a Danish newspaper in 2005 and to the
more recent comment by Pope Benedict XVI
referring to elements of Islam as "evil and in
human." The cartoon spawned riots killing
139 in Nigeria, Libya, Pakistan and
Afghanistan, while the Pope's remarks fueled
a maelstrom of controversy, including the
firebombing of Catholic churches throughout
the Middle East and the shooting death of a
nun in Somalia.
"There is a right to disagree but no one has
the right to cause destruction or destroy life,"
he said. "No one has the right to call for the
banning of newspapers."
Acknowledging that his comments were
not necessarily indicative of Islamic public
opinion, he said,"This view may not be shared
by all Muslims, but I am prepared to confront
them."
Ibrahim's penchant for speaking his mind
and sticking to his principles has dogged the
leader through a career of controversy. As a
young Malaysian activist in the 19705, he was

arrested during a student protest and spent 20
months in a detention camp. Following a mete
oric political ascent, he was named Deputy
Prime Minister in 1993, and many expected
that he was Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mo
hammad's chosen successor.
But their relationship turned sour, and in
Sept. 1998 Ibrahim was stripped of party mem
bership and incarcerated under charges of cor
ruption and sodomy.The charges were eventu
ally overturned and he was released in Sept.
2004.
Regarding Malaysian politics today,
Ibrahim expressed distaste toward his nation's
system of bumiputera — a system of econom
ic and social policies designed to favor ethnic-
Malays.
"I reject affirmative action based on race,"
he said. "Our policies should benefit the poor
and the marginalized."
Finally, he described the need for engage
ment between the Islamic world and the West,
criticizing the "extreme" foreign policy of the
United States and its refusal to negotiate with
regimes like Hamas.
"That policy is flawed." he said, adding that
"to refuse to engage is a recipe for disaster."
Ibrahim's talk was one in a series of lectures
sponsored by the Center for Democracy, De
velopment and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) ad
dressing relationships with non-Western cul
tures.
"There's not a topic that I think we need to
pay more attention to as a country, and there's
also not a topic that we're more ignorant about
today." CDDRL Director Michael McFaul
said while introducing Ibrahim.
