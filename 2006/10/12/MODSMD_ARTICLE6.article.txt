# ON CAPITOL HILL
## Former pages say program is worth keeping 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
For 2(X)5 grad Chris Clark, the
road to Stanford began on Capitol
Hill.
A farm kid out of Western Illi
nois, 16-year-old Clark wanted to
"got out and get away" from home.
He snatched his golden opportuni
ty by joining the House congres
sional page program in 2(MH).
"Being a part of the page pro
gram was a stepping stone to Stan
ford for me," Clark said. A counselor

at the program urged him to apply to
Stanford, a school that he,"the kid

from the middle of nowhere," had never

considered. According to (Mark, the page

program changed his life.

I lowever, two weeks after ABC News

exposed Rep. Mark Foley for sending sexual
ly explicit emails and instant messages to for
mer congressional pages, a handful of elected
officials have suggested suspending the page

program altogether. But Clark and other Stan
ford students and alumni who participated in the
program have come to its defense.
Several former pages told The Daily that the
best part of the program was, in fact, the close in
teraction with members of Congress. Clark said
that to a certain extent, pages were vulnerable to
congressmen, but in general a good dynamic
formed between them.
"We really do kind of idolize a lot of the mem
bers of Congress, because that's kind of why
we're there," he said. "We want to see firsthand
the people who run our country. To have some

one take advantage of that is really unfortunate,"
Clark said.
Congressional pages, who range from ages lf>-
IX, populate the House and Senate floors, run
ning errands and answering phones while getting
an inside look at Congress in action.
"There were only a handful of members that
were really nice to us and took an interest in our
lives." he continued. "Those are the members we
remember, and that's why everyone would prob
ably remember Congressman Foley."
Clark described Foley as one of the few
"friendlier" members, but not in an unusual way.
"He was definitely one of those people who
would say hello and stop by to ask how things
were going. To me that didn't set off any alarms,
but in hindsight, it makes you wonder." Clark
said. "There were rumors flying around that he
was gay — 'cause you know, we're 16 and we talk
about these things — but that was it. rumors,
nothing about harassment."
Sophomore Theo Milonopoulos, who worked
as a page in 2(M)3. said he was shocked by the


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
Foley scandal, but strongly believed
the program is not to blame.
"I got to meet some members of
Congress while I was a page who
were extremely congenial. There
was no sense of discomfort or im
propriety," said Milonopoulos,
whose twin brother Niko was a page
the same year. "The flaw lies with
this particular congressman, and the
real problem is with the attempt of
the Congressional leadership to
cover it up."
Jess Lipschultz, a Stanford alum
and graduate of the 1999 page pro
gram, said the negative attention
would, if nothing else, discourage par
ents from allowing their teenagers to
participate.
"1 was 16, and it was difficult for
my parents to let me go to D.C. to
take part in the page program before
all this even happened. Some parents
will think twice," she said.
Lipschultz, who currently teaches
high school English now. said the re
cent controversy was unfortunate.
"I was going to promote the pro
gram to my students, but now I'm not
even going to go there until this
whole scandal blows over."
Stanford students and graduates
are not the only former pages leaping
to the program's defense. A new
Facebook group, "Save the Congres
sional page program." boasts more
than 420 members, all alumni of the
program.
Both Lipschultz and Clark said
the program would undoubtedly un
dergo reforms. In 1983. two sex scan
dals involving congressmen and un
derage pages led to previous reforms

of the page program.
Clark explained the current pro
gram is overseen by outsiders, the Of
fice of the Clerk and a board made up
of members of Congress, all of whom
may hesitate to "blow the whistle" on
something similar to a sex scandal.
ITie problem is compounded by the
fact that young pages would also hes
itate to incriminate a member of Con
gress.
"If a member had sent me emails
that made me uncomfortable. I'm not
sure I would have taken them to the
Clerk, just because it's a member of
Congress," he said. "We looked up to
them — and you don't want to start
something messy."
Clark suggested putting the pro
gram under the guidance of former
pages, who would be more approach
able counselors in cases of harass
ment. "I don't think a former page
would be as unwilling to blow the
whistle," he said.
Clark and the other interviewees
all agreed, though, the page program
was a memorable experience that
gave them the opportunity to see the
human side of the most powerful
people in the country.
"Regardless of whether they are
pages or not, there will be people in
power who exploit children," Lip
schultz said.
The Foley scandal, however, does
not reflect the nature of the page pro
gram, Lipschultz said.
The program showed me that [the
members of Congress] are passionate
and hardworking," she said. "It actu
ally made me a lot less cynical about
the way our government works."
Clark expressed that he still ad
mires the congressmen he observed
duringthe page program."lt'sstill my
dream job." Clark said. "I would love
to be a member of Congress some
day."

about these things — but that was it. rumors,
nothing about harassment."
Sophomore Theo Milonopoulos, who worked
as a page in 2(M)3. said he was shocked by the


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
Foley scandal, but strongly believed
the program is not to blame.
"I got to meet some members of
Congress while I was a page who
were extremely congenial. There
was no sense of discomfort or im
propriety," said Milonopoulos,
whose twin brother Niko was a page
the same year. "The flaw lies with
this particular congressman, and the
real problem is with the attempt of
the Congressional leadership to
cover it up."
Jess Lipschultz, a Stanford alum
and graduate of the 1999 page pro
gram, said the negative attention
would, if nothing else, discourage par
ents from allowing their teenagers to
participate.
"1 was 16, and it was difficult for
my parents to let me go to D.C. to
take part in the page program before
all this even happened. Some parents
will think twice," she said.
Lipschultz, who currently teaches
high school English now. said the re
cent controversy was unfortunate.
"I was going to promote the pro
gram to my students, but now I'm not
even going to go there until this
whole scandal blows over."
Stanford students and graduates
are not the only former pages leaping
to the program's defense. A new
Facebook group, "Save the Congres
sional page program." boasts more
than 420 members, all alumni of the
program.
Both Lipschultz and Clark said
the program would undoubtedly un
dergo reforms. In 1983. two sex scan
dals involving congressmen and un
derage pages led to previous reforms

of the page program.
Clark explained the current pro
gram is overseen by outsiders, the Of
fice of the Clerk and a board made up
of members of Congress, all of whom
may hesitate to "blow the whistle" on
something similar to a sex scandal.
ITie problem is compounded by the
fact that young pages would also hes
itate to incriminate a member of Con
gress.
"If a member had sent me emails
that made me uncomfortable. I'm not
sure I would have taken them to the
Clerk, just because it's a member of
Congress," he said. "We looked up to
them — and you don't want to start
something messy."
Clark suggested putting the pro
gram under the guidance of former
pages, who would be more approach
able counselors in cases of harass
ment. "I don't think a former page
would be as unwilling to blow the
whistle," he said.
Clark and the other interviewees
all agreed, though, the page program
was a memorable experience that
gave them the opportunity to see the
human side of the most powerful
people in the country.
"Regardless of whether they are
pages or not, there will be people in
power who exploit children," Lip
schultz said.
The Foley scandal, however, does
not reflect the nature of the page pro
gram, Lipschultz said.
The program showed me that [the
members of Congress] are passionate
and hardworking," she said. "It actu
ally made me a lot less cynical about
the way our government works."
Clark expressed that he still ad
mires the congressmen he observed
duringthe page program."lt'sstill my
dream job." Clark said. "I would love
to be a member of Congress some
day."
For 2(X)5 grad Chris Clark, the
road to Stanford began on Capitol
Hill.
A farm kid out of Western Illi
nois, 16-year-old Clark wanted to
"got out and get away" from home.
He snatched his golden opportuni
ty by joining the House congres
sional page program in 2(MH).
"Being a part of the page pro
gram was a stepping stone to Stan
ford for me," Clark said. A counselor

at the program urged him to apply to
Stanford, a school that he,"the kid

from the middle of nowhere," had never

considered. According to (Mark, the page

program changed his life.

I lowever, two weeks after ABC News

exposed Rep. Mark Foley for sending sexual

officials have suggested suspending the page

program altogether. But Clark and other Stan
ford students and alumni who participated in the
program have come to its defense.
Several former pages told The Daily that the
best part of the program was, in fact, the close in
teraction with members of Congress. Clark said
that to a certain extent, pages were vulnerable to
congressmen, but in general a good dynamic
formed between them.
"We really do kind of idolize a lot of the mem
bers of Congress, because that's kind of why
we're there," he said. "We want to see firsthand
the people who run our country. To have some

one take advantage of that is really unfortunate,"
Clark said.
Congressional pages, who range from ages lf>-
IX, populate the House and Senate floors, run
ning errands and answering phones while getting
an inside look at Congress in action.
"There were only a handful of members that
were really nice to us and took an interest in our
lives." he continued. "Those are the members we
remember, and that's why everyone would prob
ably remember Congressman Foley."
Clark described Foley as one of the few
"friendlier" members, but not in an unusual way.
"He was definitely one of those people who
would say hello and stop by to ask how things
were going. To me that didn't set off any alarms,
but in hindsight, it makes you wonder." Clark
said. "There were rumors flying around that he
was gay — 'cause you know, we're 16 and we talk
about these things — but that was it. rumors,
nothing about harassment."
