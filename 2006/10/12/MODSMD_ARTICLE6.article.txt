For 2(X)5 grad Chris Clark, the
road to Stanford began on Capitol
Hill.
A farm kid out of Western Illi
nois, 16-year-old Clark wanted to
"got out and get away" from home.
He snatched his golden opportuni
ty by joining the House congres
sional page program in 2(MH).
"Being a part of the page pro
gram was a stepping stone to Stan
ford for me," Clark said. A counselor

at the program urged him to apply to
Stanford, a school that he,"the kid

the people who run our country. To have some

one take advantage of that is really unfortunate,"
Clark said.
Congressional pages, who range from ages lf>-
IX, populate the House and Senate floors, run
ning errands and answering phones while getting
an inside look at Congress in action.
"There were only a handful of members that
were really nice to us and took an interest in our
lives." he continued. "Those are the members we
remember, and that's why everyone would prob
ably remember Congressman Foley."
Clark described Foley as one of the few
"friendlier" members, but not in an unusual way.
"He was definitely one of those people who
would say hello and stop by to ask how things
were going. To me that didn't set off any alarms,
but in hindsight, it makes you wonder." Clark
said. "There were rumors flying around that he
was gay — 'cause you know, we're 16 and we talk
about these things — but that was it. rumors,
nothing about harassment."
Sophomore Theo Milonopoulos, who worked
as a page in 2(M)3. said he was shocked by the
