## Comedy funding not so funny GSC softens some, not all, rules to fund the Stanford Comedy Club 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Even a good laugh is not worth breaking all the rules for.
the Graduate Student Council realized. Last night.it voted to
bend some, but not other, by-laws in funding the cash
strapped Stanford Comedy Club and the weekly comedy
nights held at the 750 Pub.
"In a way. we're a charity case now," said President
Melahn Parker, as he pleaded with the GSC for more money.
"We had members donate to keep the last two shows going."
His words were apparently not compelling enough to
convince the GSC to relax its rules.The amount his club had
requested, which would have been higher than almost any
other group the GSC funds, was technically not in line with
GSC by-laws, which place caps on how much funding each
student group can receive.
"I did what I could," said GSC Funding Committee Chair
Adam Berger when presenting the committee's suggestion
to cut funds below the requested amount. "We have several
funding caps, and I bent some, but this is all I could do."
The GSC, however, did not end the meeting on an entire
ly sour note. Bending some of its regulations, it approved an
amount larger than what Berger had suggested, although it
unanimously denied the club's original amount.
According to current by-laws, the Stanford Comedy Club
is not eligible for an entire year of funding since the GSC al
ready subsidizes some of the club's summer shows. But the
GSC softened on this rule and did not count the summer ex
penses against the group, which it deemed acceptable in this
particular case because the club, eligible for special fees,
would not be coming back to the GSC for more aid.
Ihe decision worried several GSC members over the
possibility of setting an inconvenient precedent.
"It's just a matter of the groups who will come the next
week and the week after that, asking us to bend our rules,"
said one representative who wished to remain anonymous.

"If it was an annual thing,we wouldn't bend the rules,"de
fended GSC Co-Chair Paul Gurney.
Some attributed GSC's funding to the Stanford Comedy
Club's extensive efforts to acquire as much funding as they
could.
"It's an impressive amount of work you've put into it,"
GSC co-chair Jenny Allen told Parker. "More student
groups should aspire to do what you did."
Ibe club organizes comedy nights starring professional
comedians every Tuesday at the 750. Attendance can reach
as high as 100 people on a good night. Its ultimate goal, Park
er said, is "to put Stanford on the map of comedy."
"We're very appreciative of every dollar we get," Parker
said after the GSC vote.
Though it has existed for a while, the club only recently be
came a student group in order to be eligible for more mone
tary support.
Three other student groups also received funding last
night. Shaking the Foundations, which organizes a two-day
workshop at the Law School that attracts upwards of 200 stu
dents, received much of the money they requested.
Ihe Biomedical Association for the Interests of Minority
Students (BioAIMS) received as much funding as they re
quested for student workshops.
The last group, according to junior and club representa
tive Jasmine Aarons, was "more like an idea." I ler house. Chi
Theta Chi,wants to put on a Halloween event in White Plaza.
"It would be a sober alternative to driving back drunk
from the Castro," Aarons said.
The GSC voted unanimously to give the event $S(K) and
promised to give Aaron suggestions for other sources of
money.
The GSC later examined non-monetary matters as repre
sentatives also discussed a future health-awareness event
with Carole Pertofsky, director ofVaden's I lealth Promotion
Services.
Ihe meeting closed with a list of long-term goals for the
GSC, in light of its upcoming meeting with the newly created
office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education. On a
night when money was more on the mind of GSC represen
tatives than anything else, this "GSC Checklist" received
only passing attention at the meeting's conclusion.
