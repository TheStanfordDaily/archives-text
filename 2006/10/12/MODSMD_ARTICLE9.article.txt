# THE 						PUB NIGHT CONTRACT: AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH
## 
### DAVID HERBERT MANAGING EDITOR 
Pub Night gives you its go-ahead
— right after you read and sign a 558
word participation agreement.
'ITie senior class presidents in
formed their constituents by email
yesterday afternoon that Senior
Night, formerly known as and still
referred to by many as "Pub Night."
will return tonight. ITie event was
postponed last week as organizers
scrambled to present the Office of
Student Activities a plan to control
the poor behavior — ranging from
vomiting on Marguerite buses to
scuffles at venues — that has
plagued the weekly tradition in re
cent years.
Hut to even board a bus headed
for the venue — this week the event
will be held at Illusions on Califor
nia Ave. — seniors must sign the
"Senior Night 2006-07 Agreement."
Among the sticking points: a senior
must agree to limit rowdiness on
Marguerites and at bars; to present
his SUID before getting on the Mar
guerite; and to both identify himself
and pay a $500 line if he vomits on
the bus. Would-be revelers must also
print out an email confirmation and
present it to organizers before rid
ing the bus.
Another new control will be
color-coded tickets, which planners
will give out on a first-come, first
served basis at the bus departure
point. The organizers hope that this
will prevent overcrowding on Mar
guerites.
In his email to the class of 2007.
President Paris Mohiuddin urged
seniors to review the contract care
fully.
"Do not gloss over the expecta
tions." he wrote. "You will be held
accountable to know and follow
them."
