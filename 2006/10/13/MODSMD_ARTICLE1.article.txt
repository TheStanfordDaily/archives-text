# INSIDE THE GAME: BUBBLE SCREEN
## 
### 
Atypical ball-control pass play, the
bubble screen simulates a run
ning play to the outside. Trent Ed
wards steps and throws laterally to
slot receiver Kelton Lynn (86). The
quickness of the throw neutralizes
any pass rush.
Because the pass is completed be
hind the line of scrimmage, the split
end Michael Miller (88) is allowed to
block downfield while the ball is in the
air. If executed correctly, the receiver
has momentum and room to run
down the sideline. The play can be
run from multiple formations and is
very effective for quickly getting the
ball into the hands of a special player
and letting him work his magic. Stan
ford ran this play with success to both
sides of the field against Notre Dame.

Stanford junior defensive end Pannel Egboh and the Cardinal defense hope to continue Arizona's offensive woes.
The Wildcats have been held to negative rushing yards in each of their past three games and are 0-3 in the Pac-10.
