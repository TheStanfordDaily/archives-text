## GO Pass service gets the red light University to discontinue funding for discount tickets used In off-campus students 
### CLAY BAVINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's red light for "GO Passes," as graduate students
used to riding the Caltrain to and from classes at a dis
eount will need to start searching for new ways to com
mute.
The Graduate Student Council Parking and Trans
portation Board announced recently that the University
will no longer he able to provide off-campus students
with yearlong Caltrain passes, known as GO Passes, as it
has done for the past two years.
Ilie CiO Pass was initiated by Caltrain several years
ago as an easy way to provide discount train passes to busi
nesses in the area, said Martin Mueller. Chairman of the
Parking and Transportation Board. If companies want to
buy the C i() Pass, they are forced to purchase one for each
of their employees, even if not all will use it. At around
$ 100 per year, the GO Pass is certainly not cheap. he nc>ted.
but employees see it as "an attractive salary benefit."
In 2004. the University negotiated a contract with
Caltrain to provide passes for each off-campus grad stu
dent. In the lirst year of this program, the University of
fered the passes to students free of charge.
However, purchasing one pass for each off-campus
grad student — there are 3.200 of them — at $100 each
cost the University $320,000 annually, a price that
Mueller called "quite high." But many students took ad
vantage of the subsidized ticket. While it was free. 2,(MX)
out of the 3.2(H) eligible students used the pass.

This year the P&T Board decided to charge students
who wished to use the pass $60 in an effort to defray
costs to the University.
When passes were no longer complimentary just
1 .100 students purchased the GO Pass. Mueller said.The
P&T Board interpreted this dropoff as a signal that stu
dents do not depend heavily on the pass, since they are
not willing to pay $60 for it.he said.
At last year's student election, the Graduate Student
Council included a special fee proposal for transporta
tion on the ballot. The measure would have charged all
graduate students a general parking and transportation
fee to raise funds to provide off-campus students with
(i() Passes as well as transportation services for students

living on campus, such as airport shuttles.
I lowever.he said the proposal failed to receive the 65
percent majority required for special fees requests, and
no University funds are currently allotted to provide
subsidized GO Passes for students next calendar year.
But the P&T Board refuses to admit defeat. Mueller
pledged to keep negotiating internally and with Univer
sity administrators to provide commuting solutions for
off-campus students.
"We are working toward a proposal for continuing
the GO Pass program into 2007 as well as a plan for sus
tainable funding for 2008 and beyond." Mueller said.
ITie committee plans to present its ideas at the GSC
meeting Nov. 3.

The Caltrain is utilized by over a thousand off-campus graduate students. Until now, the University has subsidized
these expensive tickets, but the free rides will end unless GSC members reach a compromise with the University.
