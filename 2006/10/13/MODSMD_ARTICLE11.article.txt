### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Only two percent of Fortune 500 companies are led by
women, and halt employ three or fewer women in exec
utive positions â€” stark figures that a new student group
on campus intends to change.
Stanford Women in Business kicked off last night with
a "power panel featuring three executive business
women. including a co-founder ofTiVo.The panelists an
swered questions ranging from career mistakes to jug
gling a personal life to handling the kind of obstacles
women face in the marketplace.
"Any woman here could do whatever she wants." Patty
Murray, a senior vice president at Intel, told the female
students in the audience. "But you have to want to do it.
For women, however, the path is sometimes fraught
with discrimination, the panelists said.
"Its 2006, but its still going on." Murray said. "Don't
kid yourself. At the same time, we've made it."
Panelist Sally Reiss told a story about her job in in
vestment banking in Japan, where she was told point
blank that she was not moving up the ladder because she
was a "bad investment."
Reiss is now the director of operations at Proteus
Venture Partners. Along the way, she helped found a
small company named TIVO.
One of the stepping stones on the road to success is
making mistakes, the panelists agreed.
"Women are paralyzed by their mistakes," Murray
said, offering the suggestion "fail brilliantly" instead.
