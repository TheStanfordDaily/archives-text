## High-power female execs share wisdom Lending businesswomen discuss burners, balance, success in the corporate world 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Only two percent of Fortune 500 companies are led by
women, and halt employ three or fewer women in exec
utive positions — stark figures that a new student group
on campus intends to change.
Stanford Women in Business kicked off last night with
a "power panel featuring three executive business
women. including a co-founder ofTiVo.The panelists an
swered questions ranging from career mistakes to jug
gling a personal life to handling the kind of obstacles
women face in the marketplace.
"Any woman here could do whatever she wants." Patty
Murray, a senior vice president at Intel, told the female
students in the audience. "But you have to want to do it.
For women, however, the path is sometimes fraught
with discrimination, the panelists said.
"Its 2006, but its still going on." Murray said. "Don't
kid yourself. At the same time, we've made it."
Panelist Sally Reiss told a story about her job in in
vestment banking in Japan, where she was told point
blank that she was not moving up the ladder because she
was a "bad investment."
Reiss is now the director of operations at Proteus
Venture Partners. Along the way, she helped found a
small company named TIVO.
One of the stepping stones on the road to success is
making mistakes, the panelists agreed.
"Women are paralyzed by their mistakes," Murray
said, offering the suggestion "fail brilliantly" instead.
The discussion also dealt with the
trials of managing a home and family
life.
"I have to decide what's on for
dinner and make sure the kids get
picked up," Reiss said.
The women gave suggestions for
juggling their different roles and
making space for their own personal
time — from having a "date night
with your partner" to "putting exer
cise in your schedule."
There is at least one thing in
women's favor, they said.
"One skill women have that men
don't so much is multi-tasking." Mur
ray said, drawing laughter from the
crowd of more than fifty.
In the end,evening the gender im
balance in business is a numbers

game, the panelists agreed.
"Women do need women role
models." said panelist Tami Reller. a
corporate vice president at Microsoft.
That is exactly where Stanford
Women in Business aims to come in.
While there a number of other
women-oriented groups on campus.
Nguyen added, most cater only to a
select few. She intends for her group
to appeal to a broader audience. Its
current roster of 350 members in
cludes both undergraduate and grad
uate students studying in a wide
range of fields, she said.
Though membership is open only
to women, the group intends to reach
out to the entire campus.
"By the end of the year. 1 hope
that that whole campus recognizes

Stanford Women in Business as a
central resource for exploring the
business world." Nguyen said.
The group will offer a set of work
shops and seminars for all Stanford
students and faculty that it calls "Busi
ness Basics," including last night's
power panel.The members-only "Pre
mium Programming," meanwhile,
consists of the more intimate events
the group organizes to promote net
working and building contacts.
In the long term, this network is
exactly what the group wants to
achieve.
"1 want the alumni of the pro
gram. plus guests and Stanford stu
dents. to become a community,"
Nguyen said. "A business network
and a set of contacts."
