## NBA is back in a big way 
### JACK SALISBURY 
What ever happened to the
NBA? I can remember growing up
as a kid. watching the "NBA on
NBC" promos which depicted leg
ends like Scottie Pippen, John
Stockton and I lis Airncss, Michael
Jordan. I would sit on my couch
and wonder how anything could
top watching the best athletes in
the world playing the game that 1
loved.
Then it happened.
Jordan did the unthinkable. He
left the game after winning his sixth
title with the Chicago Bulls. The
league saw a drop in ratings as the
Western Conference rose to
prominence, winning five consecu
tive championships. Sure, the Lak
ers brought us some good memo
ries with Robert Horry's remark
able shot against the Kings and
their Game 7 comeback against the
Trailblazers. but it just wasn't the
same. Critics of the league argued
that the word "defense" wasn't in
the modern player's vocabulary
and that the officials let players like

Shaquille "His Groundness"
O'Neal get away with traveling vi
olations on a regular basis. Hie
Western Conference Finals turned
into the NBA Finals, with the
champion destined to come from
either California or Texas each
year. The Eastern Conference was
iittle more than a punch-line. The
NBA had lost its luster. It was dead
to me.
But a marked change has taken
place recently, and it's finally safe
to say it: the NBA is back.
Two main factors have lead to
the rebirth of America's obsession.
The first is the league's newfound
parity. An Eastern Conference
team has won the title two of the
last three years — a notion that
people would have scoffed at dur
ing the years of the Lakers' three
peat. This parity has had the added
effect of producing exciting, fast
paced games (see: Steve Nash and
the Phoenix Suns). From year to
year, fans have drama to look for
ward to. because there won't neces
sarily he a repeat champion, and the
team left standing will come from
somewhere west of the Mississippi.
Ihe other cause behind the resur
gence of professional basketball is
the emergence of a new generation
of stars. The NBA has and always will
rely on the personas of its superstars
to carry the league and establish its
marketability. During the "Show
time" era. players like Larry Bird,
Magic Johnson and Jordan gave the
NBA an unrivaled spirit of freshness.
After Jordan's retirement basketball
sorely lacked these kinds of person

alities. Sure, there were Kobe and
Shaq, but people got tired of the dys
functional duo. The explosion of
players like Cleveland's Leßron
James and Miami's Dwayne Wade
has given the league a shot in the
arm. Both are diplomatic, mature
and freakishly good basketball play
ers all at the same time.
Leßron is a physical specimen,
checking in at 6-foot-8 and 245
pounds. His physical stature is only
matched by his pure athletic ability.
Throw that in with the work ethic to
improve his jump-shot, fearlessness
in getting to the basket and passing
savvy that many have compared to
the likes of Magic and you have a
bona-fide superstar. Well-spoken
and level-headed for a man of such
great talent, it's hard to remember

sometimes that he's only 21 years
old.
And then there's Dwayne Wade,
the newly crowned NBA Champion
and Finals MVP. Wade attacks the
basket with reckless abandon, exhil
arating crowds with his acrobatic
acumen and cool, mature demeanor
on the court. Wade, who has done ex
tensive community work in Miami, is
an even-tempered character who
represents his league and his team
the way a professional athlete
should. It's hard to contain the ex
citement I have in anticipating what
mark these guys will leave on their
sport over the course of their careers.
The NBA is back.
