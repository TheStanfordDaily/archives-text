## Ivy elite lose several athletes to arrests 
### MICHAEL SHANNON COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATOR  (COLUMBIA U.) 
(CSTV U-WIRE) NEW YORK -
Though controversy on any foot
ball team will garner some atten
tion. Harvard and Yale are two
teams that have the prestige and
talent to really draw a crowd. That
has been the case this season, as
both the Yale and Harvard football
squads have suffered arrests of star
players and been left with seasons
tainted by misbehavior.
Early in the morning of Oct. 1, a
fight erupted in front of a popular
New Haven deli between Yale var
sity hockey and football players.
Five athletes were arrested on
charges of breaching the peace and
criminal mischief, including star
running back Michael McLeod and
starting quarterback Matthew I'ol

hemus. The investigation into the
details of the event is ongoing, and
head coach Jack Siedlecki declined
to comment.
But Yale's misfortune is only an
echo of the ordeal the Harvard
Crimson has dealt with since the
summer. On June 5. Harvard line
backer and team captain Matt
Thomas allegedly broke into his ex
girlfriend's dorm room after a night
of drinking. When she returned, an
altercation arose and Thomas re
portedly attacked her. The young
woman was taken to hospital while
ITiomas was arrested for breaking
and entering, assault, battery, and
property destruction. His dismissal
from the team was announced in
August.
Matt Thomas' arrest was un
doubtedly the most glaring incident
on the 1 larvard football team, but it
was not the only one. In April 2006,
two players were suspended for sep
arate acts following a team barbecue.
Also over the summer, first-string
quarterback Liam O'l lagan was sus
pended for five games for an unspec
ified violation of team rules. Most re
cently. former wide receiver Keegan
Toci was dismissed from the team in
late September following the per
formance of an obscene skit at the

team's "Senior Skit Night."
At Ivy League media day in Au
gust. head coach Tim Murphy said."l
think that it [team unity] is an ongo
ing thing. It we can get that squared
away then, I think, everything else
will take care of itself
So far. the Crimson have been
able to withstand the squall of media
coverage, scrutiny, and absence of
key players. Murphy's efforts to min
imize the embarrassment and subse
quent diversion of his team's focus by
shedding the trouble spots on the
roster have proven successful. Har
vard is tied for first in the Ivy League
with a 4-0 record.
Much of Harvard's success falls

on the shoulders of Ail-American
running back Clifton Dawson. Daw
son's record-breaking season has not
only provided the Crimson with 11
touchdowns, but also with fodder to
distract the media.
As for Yale, it is still too early to
mark the consequences of
McLeod's and Polhemus' arrests for
the Yale Bulldogs. Both players are
still active on the roster. McLeod ran
for 198 yards this past weekend
against Dartmouth. Whether or not
the team can remain competitive
against Harvard and Princeton if
their quarterback and running back
are suspended will decide the Bull
dogs' season.
