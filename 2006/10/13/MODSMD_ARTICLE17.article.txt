Though controversy on any foot
ball team will garner some atten
tion. Harvard and Yale are two
teams that have the prestige and
talent to really draw a crowd. That
has been the case this season, as
both the Yale and Harvard football
squads have suffered arrests of star
players and been left with seasons
tainted by misbehavior.
Early in the morning of Oct. 1, a
fight erupted in front of a popular
New Haven deli between Yale var
sity hockey and football players.
Five athletes were arrested on
charges of breaching the peace and
criminal mischief, including star
running back Michael McLeod and
starting quarterback Matthew I'ol

hemus. The investigation into the
details of the event is ongoing, and
head coach Jack Siedlecki declined
to comment.
But Yale's misfortune is only an
echo of the ordeal the Harvard
Crimson has dealt with since the
summer. On June 5. Harvard line
backer and team captain Matt
Thomas allegedly broke into his ex
girlfriend's dorm room after a night
of drinking. When she returned, an
altercation arose and Thomas re
portedly attacked her. The young
woman was taken to hospital while
ITiomas was arrested for breaking
and entering, assault, battery, and
property destruction. His dismissal
from the team was announced in
August.
Matt Thomas' arrest was un
doubtedly the most glaring incident
