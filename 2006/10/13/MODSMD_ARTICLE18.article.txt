While the world waits, expectantly, for Maitreya* and deliver
ance, there still remains much to do to secure the planet and
mankind. Nevertheless, men have little time to wait for Maitreya to
begin His open service. Short, indeed, therefore, is the time left to
prepare His way, to tell men that help and hope are at hand, that
the Teacher is here, eager to speak directly to the peoples of all the
nations.
Speed, then, your efforts. Make haste to inform all who will
listen that the destined hour has arrived, that soon mankind will
rejoice in the presence of the Teacher. Tell them this and uphold
their hope and courage. Many will listen now who before did not;
anxiety and fear have taken their toll of men. The signs, too, have
done their work and awakened millions to expected happenings
and revelations. Never before in man's history have so many sensed
the coming changes nor understood their necessity. Hence, into an
expectant and prepared world will Maitreya emerge, sure in the
knowledge that His presence is longed for and eagerly anticipated.
Maitreya will outline for men the priorities which alone will
secure and safeguard planet Earth and all its peoples. The necessi
ty of peace is paramount for without peace all else is lost. Peace,
lie will affirm, can only be ensured through the creation of Justice.
The lack of Justice is the begetter of both war and terrorism.
Justice, Maitreya will maintain, can be achieved only through
Sharing. Sharing, therefore, is the key to world peace mul security.
Maitreya will turn the minds of men more urgently to the ills
of planet Earth, itself. Without a healthy and robust planet the

future of succeeding generations is in peril. Maitreya will stress the
urgency of action now to restore equilibrium to our suffering plan
etary home, and call all hands, old and young, to this primary task.

These are the immediate priorities, to make fast and secure
the future for men. Man's free will is sacrosanct and may not be
infringed; the speed of implementation of these primary require
ments is subject, therefore, to the will of men. Men now face the
choice: to see the world as One and share, and know security and
blessed Peace and happiness, or to witness the end of life on Earth.
Maitreya is emerging now to ensure that man's choice is wisely
made. Have no fear, Maitreya already knows man's answer, and is
glad.
