Trust me, the real world looks noth
ing like this. Even the fuzziest Eng
lish major (i.e.. me) can solve your
average differential calculus prob
lem, and, assuming "Freakonomics"
and The Economist count, there are
lots of well-read techies biking
through the Quad. Where the
Farm's population falters, however,
is in another realm of intelligence:
the fundamentals of social interac
tion.
While waiting for a class to begin
yesterday, I was privy to the follow
ing exchange between two typical
Stanford kids.
"Where are you from?" one po
litely asked.
"Oh my god," he shook his head
emphatically. "I hate that question."
He spoke vehemently, spitting on
her as he continued. "I've lived all
over Europe, okay? I mean, like, all
over. I really hate it when people ask
me that."
I'm not sure which universe this
individual comes from, but the last
time I checked, asking where some
one is from is about as harmless and
common as introducing oneself by
name. This homeless (and nameless)
individual has an Sl,or Social Intelli
gence, quotient of zero.
Borrowing from my high school
brilliance, 1 will assume that second
axis on which we are plotting men—
and. to be fair, women—ranges from

mean and arrogant to nice and
down-to-earth. (Obviously, when I
used the words "ugly" and "cute" in
high school, I was referring to per
sonality). We'll call this the Emotion
al Intelligence Quotient, or EQ.
Thus, we have four new cate
gories or. as proof of my mathemati
cal abilities, quadrants: low SI-low
EQ, low Si-high EQ, high SI-low EQ
and high Si-high 1 Q
Quadrant one contains low Sl
low EQ individuals such as the one
from the above exchange. Seemingly
oblivious to the acne scars and or
thodontia that should have made
him humble, he was not only arro
gant but perilously unskilled in the
social arena. My suggestion: put
down the video console and strike up
a polite conversation with someone.
Members of the second group are
similarly lacking in SI. but their kind
demeanor (high EQ) earns major
points. To them I say: Location, loca
tion. location. Sweet I lall is less than
five minutes away from the Lane
Reading Room. Choose wisely.
I he third and perhaps most dan
gerous horde of men is socially capa
ble but well-aware that this makes
them fairly valuable in Stanford's
relatively small, land-locked pond.
Many of this group's most notorious,
high SI-low EQ denizens are also
members of certain all-male organi
zations, and by senior year, even
those who are not can be fairly easi
ly identified as the future ibankers
and consultants of Stanford recruit
ing. Pretend all you want, but no one
here was that cool in high school.
lTie fourth and final illustrious
group seems to have it all. To a cer

tain extent, these socially capable,
genuinely nice individuals may most
exude Stanford's smart and sun
kissed image. Sadly, as in high
school, they're unavailable. Being
the picture-perfect people that they
are, some of them have even man
aged to maintain a long-distance re
lationship beyond that first ITianks
giving break, and thus have been un
available SINCE high school. In ad
dition to this group's old unavail
ability issues, there is also a new one:
priorities. These are the people who
say."l'd lov.' to talk/come over/meet
you at the Col 10. but I have a prob
lem set/program/paper due tomor
row/next week/next quarter and 1
haven't started yet."
There is nothing wrong with hav
ing academic goals; hopefully intel
lectual curiosity is what brought us
all here in the first place. The prob
lem arises when said goals take
precedence over anything and
everything else, all of the time. One
of the most amazing and precious as
sets. if not the most amazing, pre
cious asset, that Stanford has to offer
is the people on its campus. Just like
those incredible classes and world
famous professors, you owe it to
yourself to make the most of them.
Quadrant-jumping is possible, and
the only way to do so is through new
relationships.

Lisa Mendelman is a Master's candi
date in English who did not attend the
Career Fair last Friday. Instead, .she
plans to make her post-Stanford for
tune hy marketing her E(J-SI formula.

here was that cool in high school.
lTie fourth and final illustrious
group seems to have it all. To a cer

tain extent, these socially capable,
genuinely nice individuals may most
exude Stanford's smart and sun
kissed image. Sadly, as in high
school, they're unavailable. Being
the picture-perfect people that they
are, some of them have even man
aged to maintain a long-distance re
lationship beyond that first ITianks
giving break, and thus have been un
available SINCE high school. In ad
dition to this group's old unavail
ability issues, there is also a new one:
priorities. These are the people who
say."l'd lov.' to talk/come over/meet
you at the Col 10. but I have a prob
lem set/program/paper due tomor
row/next week/next quarter and 1
haven't started yet."
There is nothing wrong with hav
ing academic goals; hopefully intel
lectual curiosity is what brought us
all here in the first place. The prob
lem arises when said goals take
precedence over anything and
everything else, all of the time. One
of the most amazing and precious as
sets. if not the most amazing, pre
cious asset, that Stanford has to offer
is the people on its campus. Just like
those incredible classes and world
famous professors, you owe it to
yourself to make the most of them.
Quadrant-jumping is possible, and
the only way to do so is through new
relationships.
