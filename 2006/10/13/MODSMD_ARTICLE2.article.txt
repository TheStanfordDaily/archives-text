# Card try to get on track against Wildcats
## Searching for the first win 
### Denis Griffin Desk editor 
After losing 31-10 to the Fighting Irish in
South Bend, Ind. last Saturday, the Cardinal
return home to lace Arizona tomorrow. Both
teams have yet to win a game against a confer
ence opponent, and share the bottom spot in
the Pac-10 rankings.
Despite its record. Stanford (0-6,0-3 Pac
-10) has shown notable improvement in recent
weeks both defensively and in the running
game. In recent weeks the Cardinal's defense
has hung tough with both Notre Dame and
UCLA through the first half. Meanwhile, if
there has been a bright spot for Stanford's of
fense early in the season, it may be the devel
opment of two respectable rushing threats in
junior Anthony Kimble and true-freshman
I'oby (ierhart. who boast 3.9 and 4.2 yards
per-carry averages respectively.
'' Ibby is a real good back, really powerful,
especially between the tackles." Kimble said.
"I le can really pound it out and get it in there.
I try to be a little bit more of a slasher through
the defense. I ie's bigger than me by far, but I
feel that when we're in there, we both can
make it happen."
Saturday's game against Arizona (2-4,0-3)
represents an opportunity for one team to
climb out from the bottom of the Pac-10 heap,
as the winner will take sole possession of the
ninth spot in conference rankings. Stanford
will look for a big contribution from its run
ning back tandem against a Wildcat defense
that has given up an average of 127 yards on
the ground each contest.
Second-year Stanford coach Walt Harris
said he had seen continued improvement
from his rushing offense despite the losing
streak so far this season.
"1 thought it improved [against Notre
Dame]." Harris said. "If you take away the
sacks, which had a lot to do with the game sit
uation. I thought we ran the ball extremely
well especially when you consider how physi
cal they were. We were all pleased with that.
Anthony and Toby both ran very hard."
Nevertheless, senior cornerback Tim Sims
insisted that such improvements were mean
ingless without tangible results.
"You can never be satisfied with losing,"
Sims said. "You don't take consolation, but
you just try to play better every week. We want
to win. You can't take consolation in just play

ing better."
I larris and his players have no doubts
about the magnitude of this contest, having
reached the season's midpoint without regis
tering a victory. Particularly intriguing is that it
may be nearly as important a contest for the
Wildcats as it is for the Cardinal, with Ari
zona's two wins on the season coming against
Brigham Young and Stephen F.Austin.
" Hiis is a big game for both teams," 1 larris
said. "It's a huge game for us — it's homecom
ing and it's been a challenging season for our
players, our team, our coaching staff and our
team's supporters. We have got to play well,
continue to work on getting better and bring
the same type of intensity and focus, regard
less of the other things that go on. and find a
way to get it done."
An revamped Stanford defense will also
look to play a significant role against an Ari
zona offense that has been held to negative
rushing yardage for each of its past three
games. Despite a rough start, the Cardinal
rush defense has improved markedly after the
Sept. 16 home opener against Navy, giving up
an average of 133 fewer yards per game..
A unit that has seemed to regress since the
early going is the Cardinal passing game, in
part due to increased pressure on senior quar
terback Trent Edwards. In the past three
games. Stanford has given up 20 sacks for 138
yards. Kimble said lie knows that for the team
to succeed, that trend has to change.
"It's been hard the past couple of weeks
because we've played against a few really
good defensive teams," Kimble said. "But I'm
just trying to help our line any way 1 can to
protect Trent. When he's protected he can re
ally do some good things."
Hie game also represents the first opportu
nity for many Stanford students to see the
Cardinal in their newly upgraded stadium, as
the team returns after two weeks on the road.
I larris said he realized that it is up to his team
to bring life to the stands.
"The stadium is a great venue: it's a beau
tiful place,but it's up to us to get it cranking,"
I larris said. "The only way you get it crank
ing is to play well, and the only way you play
well is to execute your assignments consis
tently and practice hard. It's a great place to
be and this week is homecoming so there will
be a few more people coming by to check it
out. I lopefully we can give them a great foot
ball game."

you just try to play better every week. We want
to win. You can't take consolation in just play

ing better."
I larris and his players have no doubts
about the magnitude of this contest, having
reached the season's midpoint without regis
tering a victory. Particularly intriguing is that it
may be nearly as important a contest for the
Wildcats as it is for the Cardinal, with Ari
zona's two wins on the season coming against
Brigham Young and Stephen F.Austin.
" Hiis is a big game for both teams," 1 larris
said. "It's a huge game for us — it's homecom
ing and it's been a challenging season for our
players, our team, our coaching staff and our
team's supporters. We have got to play well,
continue to work on getting better and bring
the same type of intensity and focus, regard
less of the other things that go on. and find a
way to get it done."
An revamped Stanford defense will also
look to play a significant role against an Ari
zona offense that has been held to negative
rushing yardage for each of its past three
games. Despite a rough start, the Cardinal
rush defense has improved markedly after the
Sept. 16 home opener against Navy, giving up
an average of 133 fewer yards per game..
A unit that has seemed to regress since the
early going is the Cardinal passing game, in
part due to increased pressure on senior quar
terback Trent Edwards. In the past three
games. Stanford has given up 20 sacks for 138
yards. Kimble said lie knows that for the team
to succeed, that trend has to change.
"It's been hard the past couple of weeks
because we've played against a few really
good defensive teams," Kimble said. "But I'm
just trying to help our line any way 1 can to
protect Trent. When he's protected he can re
ally do some good things."
Hie game also represents the first opportu
nity for many Stanford students to see the
Cardinal in their newly upgraded stadium, as
the team returns after two weeks on the road.
I larris said he realized that it is up to his team
to bring life to the stands.
"The stadium is a great venue: it's a beau
tiful place,but it's up to us to get it cranking,"
I larris said. "The only way you get it crank
ing is to play well, and the only way you play
well is to execute your assignments consis
tently and practice hard. It's a great place to
be and this week is homecoming so there will
be a few more people coming by to check it
out. I lopefully we can give them a great foot
ball game."
