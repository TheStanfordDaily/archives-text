from my apartment. Some of us
don't have the luxury of walking 20-
30 minutes to get to lab. as we don't
have time to sleep much less walk
everywhere. 1 agree there is a huge
problem with bikes...just today the
bikes were parked solid across the
steps in front of math corner of the
quad, and I couldn't take the stairs
without moving the bikes. A lot of
people weave erratically, bike on
sidewalks, cut-off pedestrians, busses
and other bikers and in general do il
legal and dangerous things. The
problem cannot be fixed by a ban in
a particular location. Bikers need to
be educated and taught how to bike
respectfully and correctly. Another
issue I see is that cops often set-up in
front of all of the graduate resi
dences and hand-out tickets at night,
without targeting anyone else who is
part of the problem.

A short one to state that I agree
completely with what Jim Collins
said in his comment "Regardless of
what Dean Powers told you, the rea
son why those of us who use the Ar
cade — and the many other pedes
trian areas of campus..." 1 am com
pletely sick of yielding to bicyclists
while I walk and completely sick of
bicyclists that think that have some
kind of God given right to ride with
their bikes over every surface, and
over every pedestrian that they find
on their way. I applaud the bike ban
and urge the Stanford administra
tion to impose significant cash fines
to bicyclists who break the rules.

Dear Mr. Franich, Wow. I didn't
think it could get much worse than
your last column about the village
bicycle, but it did indeed. First of all.
"if even one person with accessibili
ty problems has more accessibility
now. isn?t that enough?? is not only
an argument, it's a valid one. If you
can't see this.try rolling around cam
pus in a chair for a day. or better yet.
try sitting in a dark room for five
minutes and thinking about some
one other than yourself. 1 know it's
hard. Secondly, your use of false
analogies is astounding! "If even one

person bikes across grass and trips
over unsteady ground, will we have
security monitoring all the grass?"
Yes, this is exactly the same argu
ment. except for the small fact that
the people parking and riding their
hikes in the arcades weren't incon
veniencing and injuring themselves,
they were inconveniencing and in
juring OTHERS. It's a fine line.
Again, the Daily does itself proud
with this piece.

Question to Wow — true, Franich
appears self-obsessed; but your re
sponse as to "thinking about some
one besides yourself" goes too far
and misses the point. If 1 (X) students
all want to ride their bikes through
the Quad, and one person with acces
sibility problems demands a ban (an
extreme measure that should be jus
tified). it is that one person who is
submitting the KM) to her will — this
may be justified, but then again, it
may not be. As 1 understand it. this is
essentially the case here — we have
a minority submitting the majority to
their will. If the inconvenience to the
majority is slight, other methods
have tried and failed, and the incon
venience to the minority is substan
tial — then when we weigh these fac
tors against one another, we come to
the conclusion that a ban is the only
course. If. for instance, there is a mid
dle ground that can both make the
lives of people with accessibility
problems easier and respect student
autonomy (and student decision
making). then perhaps that is the
course the Administration should
take. ITie University appears NOT to
have conducted such an inquiry,
weighing these factors, and it they
have — it seems suspicious that they
refuse to reveal evidence ol this. Why
not? Who really cares about this
issue anyway? Address it. move on
with it. On a separate note. I am sus
picious of this justification of "acces
sibility" — where are these people,
and why aren't their voices being
heard? In fact. I haven't heard one
testimonial from ;i person with these
concerns re: bike ban. All I see are a
select group of graduate students, ad
ministrators. faculty members (i.e.,
people older than 22) complaining.
