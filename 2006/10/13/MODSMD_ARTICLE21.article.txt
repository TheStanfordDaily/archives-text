Development will no doubt contin

donations to fund conspicuous new
projects around campus and over
seas. After all. it has announced only
some of the large, public donations,

like Phil Knight's pledge to the
Graduate School ot Business, within
the $2.19 billion already raised. Stu
dents and faculty should applaud
these announcements as they come,
but they should also keep an eye on
the bigger picture.
As for you. visiting alumni, you'll
probably be hearing quite enough
this weekend about lTie Stanford
Challenge. The I Jniversity still needs
to raise over $2 billion, and its got to
come from somewhere. We'll leave it
to them to sell the new campaign.
For the moment.all we want to say is:
"Welcome back."
