vided some original spin on a story
that could be found all over the In
ternet. by interviewing Kornberg's
son, a junior. Still, neither article was
the strongest that the editors had to
offer that night, and so were ranked
behind better-written and more sub
stantive articles. Nonetheless, these
lead stories were decidedly less
timely or important than the Nobel
Prize articles.
Second, the editors assumed, per
haps naively, that students would
read this Nobel news in other
sources like The New York Times.
By virtue of their time and re
sources. these sources had earlier
and more extensive coverage of the
Nobel Prize winners than The Daily
could provide. And students expect
The Daily to report on the Stanford
specific stories that The New York
Times won't cover.
This exemplifies a judgment call
The Daily's editors often must make
when they are in a unique posi
tion to offer coverage about campus
concerns, how much space should
they devote to an issue that students
will probably read about elsewhere?
Isn't their greatest service to readers
to keep them informed about news
they can't get anywhere else?
Well. yes. this is an extremely im
portant — and perhaps the ultimate
— function of The Daily as a student
newspaper. But I'm not convinced
that this justifies burying the two ar
ticles about the Nobel Prize wins.
This was undoubtedly the biggest
news story on each of those days,
and it should have been splashed
across the top of the paper. Even if
the paper's professed focus is on sto
ries that won't be covered elsewhere
— even if the editors sense that a
story about athletes' Training Table
is going to be more widely-read than
one about a Medical School profes
sor winning the Nobel Prize —it
still has a responsibility to promi
nently report on matters of global
relevance relating to Stanford, re
gardless of the novelty or insightful
ness of the reporting.
So did the editors make the cor
rect decision by not leading with
these two Nobel Prize articles? 1
don't think so. They can certainly
argue that they had legitimate
grounds for their choice, but I believe
that the objective overwhelming im
port of news stories such as this
should override the subjective analy
sis of an article's journalistic quality
In the paper's defense, yesterday's
issue had a great lead story on the
two winners. As soon as The Daily
was able to speak to the two win
ners, the monumental event was
adequately covered. But the fact
remains that when the Nobel
Prizes were fresh news, the stories
were not given the weight they de
served.
As a final note, I love the com
ments I've gotten from people who
are happy (and amused) that I'm
still working for The Daily, even
though my undergrad glory days are
behind me. I don't want to discour
age anyone from keeping those day
brighteners coming my way. but I
would definitely appreciate some
student feedback about the quality
of the paper, too.
