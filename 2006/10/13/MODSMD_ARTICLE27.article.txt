### BETSY CONGDON BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION CREW 
So it's Thursday Night at 9:33 pm, not bad really,
and we r r e in The Daily office. Where else would we
be? Betsy is sad because she is still not quite over the
Yankees being eliminated in the playoffs, and Bren
dan is kind of upset because he is already certain of
pulling an all-nighter. But, all in all, we are

quite happy.
Tonight's issue is about Inter

senior) a job. Admit
tedly, neither of us
face this fate — call it

schadenfreude, hut v
we're pretty psyched. *
We arc running 12 pages
of amazing content for you

— the reader. 1
Intermission also recently
launched Monday Mayhem.

brought to you by Intermission
last week. If you missed it, the
basic idea is that Intermission
takes over the second page of The
Daily every Monday. We will bring
you updates on what happened that
weekend, and hopefully we'll be able to
brighten your start of the week a bit as

well. 1
Monday Mayhem is also an opportunity
for us to bring you classics like Party Snooper
and Faces on the Farm, while wc also intro-

duce soon-to-be legends like Facebook Stalker and
EANAE (Equally Attractive Non-Alcoholic
Event). The EANAE column is a great way to find
out what is going on around campus on the week
ends outside of the house / frat party scene — not
that there is anything wrong with the house / frat
party scene (cough, cough).

The Monday section is only in its
infancy. So if you have ideas, sugges
tions or just want to write for it,
k please let us know

(intcrmission.daily@gmail.com).
We are also always open to
k ideas about Friday's Intermis
\ sion. We know that this
\ hasn't been the best editor's
note — some might even
find it boring. But we
had to get the informa
tion out there, so give
us some slack.
Things arc going
well for us — it's
Thursday night
at The Daily
and we have
been in the
bunnies
three
times in
the last
week.
