## 'Infamous' will never be as famous as 'Capote' 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION FAME GOD 
You've got to feel a little sorry for writer-di
rector Douglas
McGrath. Though McGrath has fashioned a
funny and moving account of author Truman
Capote's experiences writing "In Cold Blood,"
his film is largely obsolete. Last year's
"Capote" depicted the same events and fea
tured an Oscar-winning performance from
Philip Seymour Hoffman that this film's lead
(Toby Jones) had no hope of eclipsing.
How "Infamous" remained in production is
a great mystery. Written accounts suggest that

"Capote," "Infamous"

figure."

the script was considered too good to pass up
even though the producers knew about the
rival Capote movie. This is quite possible.
McGrath's screenplay is very witty while
being compassionate to both its characters
and its sometimes dark material The film's
excellent supporting cast, including San- J
dra Bullock and Daniel Craig, likely j
helped also. I

Like "Capote," "Infamous" begins
with the brutal slaying of a prominent
Kansas family. Intrigued by the mur

Capote (Jones) travels to the
sfnall town of Holcomb, with author Harper
Lee (Bullock) in-tow, hoping to write a "New
Yorker" article documenting the impact on the

local community. However, when the murder
ers are captured, the author quickly becomes
obsessed with showing their side of the story.
In the lead role, Jones is very good. "Infa
mous" has a much lighter tone than

"Capote" and

well-suited to its seemingly unending stream
of one-liners. (It's worth counting how many
times Capote is mistaken for a woman.) Jones'
command of the character in the film's dramat
ic moments is also competent but suffers from
unfortunate comparisons with Hoffman's truly

transformative performance. Hoffman rarely
seems like he's acting. Jones is having too much
fun to not be acting.

Yet the real highlight is Craig's por-

trayal of Perry Smith. The future James

Bond manages the difficult task of imbuing the
killer with both tenderness and rage. Though
Craig remains an unlikely choice to play lan
Fleming's secret agent, he may well prove to be
the most talented actor to assume the role.
Despite covering the same events as

"Capote," "Infamous" paints a very different
portrait of its central figure. While the former
seeks to demonize its subject, "Infamous" is
more sympathetic. McGrath's version of
Capote is that of a lovably effeminate homo
sexual who is the victim of his own compassion.
His looming mental breakdown, in particular,
is attributed to a love affair with Smith. And
the notion that the author sought to profit from
the misery of his subjects is largely absent from
"Infamous."
Of course, there's a certain irony to these
choices. The movie spends so much time de
picting Capote's efforts to humanize Smith but

somehow manages to ignore its protagonist's
own complexities. Though we are sympathetic
toward Capote in the film's closing moments, it
seems a little easy and little unearned.
"Capote" manages to elicit a similar feeling but
doesn't need to romanticize its subject to do so.
Nevertheless, though "Infamous"
doesn't challenge viewers the
same way

"Capote" does,
its combination of comedy

and tragedy is undeniably effective. If "Infa
mous" is forgotten in years to come, it's only
because a better biography of Truman Capote
was released several months earlier. It's cer
tainly no fault of writer-director
McGrath
