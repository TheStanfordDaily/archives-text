### Andrew Shen Staff writer 
Coming off of a key win over Cal last
Saturday, the Stanford menis water polo
team will travel to USC to participate in
the Southern California Tournament for
two days of competition starting tomor
row. Known as the SoCal Open, the event
will feature 12 of the nation's top 20
teams. Having snapped a four-match los
ing streak with the victory, the No. 5 Car
dinal will look to continue their recent
success at the event.
After reestablishing themselves as
one of the top teams in the nation, the
Cardinal will have the opportunity to rise
to a truly elite level, given the competi
tion they will face at the SoCal Open.The
win against Cal could prove to be a fan
tastic way to begin their ascent.
"The win against Cal was great." jun
ior Peter Finlayson said. "It gave us some
much-needed confidence and momen
tum going into this weekend. Because of
the seeding, we could get the chance to
beat Cal, UCLA and USC this weekend.
What a great opportunity for us."
Stanford's group will include No. 4
UCLA and No. 14 Long Beach State.The
Cardinal are used to being the top seed in
their bracket, as they were in the NorCal

tournament, but will be the underdog to
win their group, especially considering
their poor record against UCLA this sea
son. In two games against the Bruins, the
Cardinal lost twice, 7-6 and 10-8.
At many times during the team's los
ing streak. Stanford veterans urged that
patience was the key for their young
squad. Will Hindle-Katel, a sophomore,
and Janson and Drac Wigo. twin fresh
men. represent three of the team's top
four goal-scorers. Senior captain Tyler
Drake argued that now is the time for the
team to gel and overtake its rivals.
"I think the win showed that we are fi
nally maturing," said Drake, the team's
third leading scorer. "This tournament
will be a great chance for us to both show
other teams how quickly we are develop
ing and to see which areas we still need to
improve upon before the end of the sea
son."
While some might see a young and de
veloping squad as a negative, Finlayson
believes that, at this point of the season,
the Cardinal have a mental edge because
they feel like they have more room for
improvement than their opponents.
"1 think we have a big advantage be
cause I really feel like every time we play
