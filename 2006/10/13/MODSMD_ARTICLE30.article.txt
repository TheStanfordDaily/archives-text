## Not all Antarcticans are penguins 
### BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION ANTARCTICAN 
I first heard The Antarcticans
as I was driving toward the city on
a crisp autumn evening last year.
The track that was playing, "Burn
Your Fossil Fuels," isn't so much a
song as a nine-minute digressive
montage of climactic riffs inter
spersed with various meandering
ambient ramblings — in other
words, a work that seems to lack
any sense of formal structure yet
somehow manages to hold it all to
gether. Think of an unfocused yet
poignant rendition of My Bloody
Valentine and you'll start to get
the idea.
I shortly thereafter picked up
the group's self-titled 2004 CD. 1
was not disappointed. So when 1
saw that a new release from the
band, "Teach Children: Fear All
Teachings of Eternity," was now
in stores (or rather, available on
their Web site). I knew I had to get
myself a copy.
Self-described on their Web
site as an "instrumental-attack

noise group," the band's musical
approach is by no means a recipe
for mainstream pop success. But
that is as it should be. After all,
who is hungry for another slick,
over-produced and neatly pack
aged three-minute top-of-the
charts hit? Do we really only de-

sire reiterations of the same tired
concept, over and over again?
I lack the musical vocabulary to
properly identify the band's
sound, which a certain reviewer
pegs as "homegrown SoCal drone
rock," but 1 believe that this in
ability on my part is a notable
symptom of the genius behind the

effort of the album as well as The
Antarcticans project in general.
The band seeks to defy classifica
tion, if not violently tear down the
current system of labels altogether
in order to redefine the musical
landscape.
The introductory tune, "A.D.

Slaveship," is more a warm-up ses
sion of feedback than an actual
song. But the album soon pro
ceeds to "Escape Your Forever
Thought," perhaps the best track
on the CD. A 16-minute journey
of distortion-directed discovery
ensues. About eight minutes
through, what constitutes the main

charge of the song gets underway,
leading to a fierce five-minute vol
ley of sound before the piece
abruptly collapses into an eerie
drizzle, which then leisurely takes
the remainder of the track to bring
itself to a close.

The third song is the least co
herent of the bunch, while the
fourth track contains the catchiest
and most consistent hook out of
the five total tunes. But the closing
song, "Ghost of the Trees & The
Erase of Man," is classic. Starting
off with a mood suggestive of lin
gering reflection, shortly after the
song's halfway mark, its tone sud
denly shifts to suggest a renewed
sense of vigor on the part of the
band. It's as if, anticipating the
coming close of the album, the
group is defiantly battling against
the course of their own music, try
ing to maintain a frenetic pace that
will allow the sounds to continue
indefinitely. It almost appears that
they have succeeded until, with
four seconds to go, the song gives
out, and the album is over as unex
pectedly as it started.
