# Entering the real world? Get some real music
## 
### DAN BACON INTERMISSION MUSICAL ADULT 
Life is characterized by several sig
nificant transitions in musical tastes,
from "Sesame Street" songs to Brit
ney Spears and 'NSYNC at the ten
der age of 10, to 50 Cent and Snoop
Dogg upon the start of high school
Upon the conclusion of college, when
students leave the boundaries of the
Stanford bubble and enter that place
known as "the real world," they expe
rience one last musical preferences.
Just as you don't want to be that one
seventh grader who's still listening to
Raffi, you do not want to be that one
30-year-old guy at the gym who's jam
ming out to Ciara while doing the el
liptical machine. Although your col
lege roommate might have been
down with E-40 and the Hyphy
movement, your boss probably
won't. Yet this transition doesn't limit
your musical taste to classical and that
crap on the smooth jazz station: MA
TURE and GOOD music does exist!
Below are some suggestions that will

hopefully aid you in your transition.
A Tribe Called Quest
This is the group that started the
alternative hip-hop genre; without
them, there would be no Mos Def or
Common. Their laid-back jazz sam
ple-based tracks give the songs a very
different vibe than most rap, and Q-
Tips verses are some of the most flow
ing hip-hop rhymes ever recorded. A
Tribe Called Quest also confronted a
series of issues, such as black-on
black crime and the darker side of the
rap industry, when few other rappers
would.

Eric Clapton
Eric Clapton has proven to be the
most proficient guitarist on the music
scene since the 19605; from rock to
blues, from electric guitar to acoustic,
Clapton's skills are unparalleled. His
passion for guitar and his knowledge

of its blues and classic rock roots
seeps through everything he records.
A few years ago, Clapton teamed up
with blues legend 8.8. King and re
leased "Riding with the King," which
proved to be one of the most ener
getic and creative celebrity collabora
tions in years.

Miles Davis
Miles Davis was at the forefront
of every musical and stylistic innova
tion in jazz during his musical career.
From the cool jazz movement in the
late 19405, to bebop in the 19505, to
fusion jazz in the 19705. Miles Davis
was a leader. He is one of those artists
whose sound is so unique that the
moment you hear that melodic, inti
mate sound of the trumpet, you
know it is none other than Miles
Davis. His crisp, haunting tone and
his strive for perfection in his music

set him aside from the rest of his very
talented peers; you know that what
ever Miles Davis album you pick up,
it's going to be a purely amazing lis
tening experience.

Better known as the production

duo the Neptunes, Pharrell Williams
and Chad Hugo, along with friend
Shae Haley, are also in an alternative
rock band known as N.E.R.D (com
monly mispronounced as "nerd").
N.E.R.D. draws upon alternative
rock influences while also incorporat
ing that recognizable Neptunes hip
hop sound, creating music that spans
the genres, something very few artists
are capable of doing today. Pharrell's
brash tenor combined with his taste
for eccentric synth beats gives
N.E.R.D. distinctness and flavor that
no one but Pharrell and Chad Hugo
could create.
