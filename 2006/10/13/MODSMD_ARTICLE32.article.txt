## Epsilon Zeta: It's full of characters 
### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION FRAT MAN 
"Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to
go through life son," are the famous
words of Dean Wormer to Kent Floun
der' Dorfman in the fraternity classic
"Animal House." That phrase, along
with many others like it, have pigeon
holed fraternities into a set of stereo
types that are, at best, misleading.
Today, if one were to try and com
pile a list of fraternity stereotypes, it
wouldn't take long to come up with a
catalogue of generally negative labels,
events and characteristics. And while
fraternities themselves are far from in
nocent, the pop culture stigma at
tached to fraternity life has long been
accepted as the norm despite its exag
gerations and inaccuracies.
Working to give a completely differ
ent and unique perspective on fraterni-

ties and fraternity life, author Jock Young has released
"Epsilon Zeta". a novel set in the Epsilon Zeta fraternity
at the fictional Northwest Florida University. Based on
his own experience as a member of the Sigma Chi frater
nity at Florida State University in the late 1980's, Young
tells the story of a fraternity that collapses in on itself due
to inner turmoil over the course of an academic year.
However, what makes this work stand out from the
popular "Animal House" perspective is that author Jock
Young deals in a currency seemingly foreign to the fra
ternity genre: honesty. Young delves into the dark under
belly of fraternity life and makes no attempt to gloss over
its deep and often unpleasant secrets.
Following a group of college students coming into their
senior year at NFU, Young paints a highly detailed and
captivating picture of the realities of Greek life in the uni
versities of America.
The plot of the novel is nothing spectacular. Once you
get the general gist of the I rat politics the story becomes
nothing more than a series of guy drama. What keeps this
well-trodden story alive and morphs it into a page-turner

is the wonderful breadth and detail
of the characters.
Refusing to center on any par
ticular protagonist. Young instead
introduces us to a myriad of fraterni
ty brothers, each with their own
qualities and pitfalls. These are not
your typical cardboard cutout frat
boys; each character brings a unique
set of perspectives and biases to the
table, and it is these perspectives and
biases that make this novel stand out
from the rest. Many readers will like
ly agree with one side of the novel's
conflict while equally as many will
agree with the opposing side. In this
book, much like in the real world,
there is no hero, there are no easy
decisions and there are no happy
endings.
The writing isn't exactly mag
num opus level work but it gets the
job done. There are editing mistakes

here and there but they are hardly noticeable. It is a very
quick read due to the majority of the novel being cen
tered on rapidly transpiring events and conversations.
The simplicity of the writing style lends itself greatly to
the realism of the events taking place throughout the
novel.
The language itself is coarse and the dialogue is often
lewd or downright offensive at best, but it is exactly this
quality that makes "Epsilon Zeta" truly stand out.
Young's characters express their opinions on a myriad of
topics including racism, sexism, homophobia and drug use
in ways that would make most people cringe.
Young also gives a peak into the ritual and tradition
that makes up the legendary hazing and initiation com
mon among many fraternities, shining some light on the
facet of fraternity life that is most greatly shadowed in
mystery. Much of what he talks about will catch readers
off guard, from the creativity of certain events to the
downright cruelly of others. Again, Young pulls no
punches here and tells it like it is, for better or worse.
From start to finish. "Epsilon Zeta" is a captivating

novel that breaks new ground in the fraternity genre by
taking the seemingly unthinkable step of simply telling
the truth. The memorable and wonderfully detailed char
acters bring the somewhat dull story to life and allow
Young to expose issues that have been ignored or denied
for decades. If one wants to watch an entertaining, if in
accurate movie about fraternity life then "Animal
House" is my recommendation. But, if a reader would
like to experience a peak of the real frat life, politics and
brotherhood, then Jock Young's "Epsilon Zeta" is the
best offering in years.
