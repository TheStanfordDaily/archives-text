# HOW TO ACE A JOB INTERVIEW
## Safety Jobs!

Attitude

You have to make them want to hire you. There are two very easy ways to do that. First, be enthusiastic. Try to
be the kind of co-worker you'd like to encounter early Monday morning. Be excited about the position you're
applying for. A good way to make this easier is to get a good night's sleep. Don't stay up worrying about your
interview the next day. You're a Stanford student- they're also afraid you'll say no to them, not just the other way
around. Second, be confident. Show off your finest qualities! Don't be afraid to say "I'll be awesome at this job
because..." Also, you never want to come across as desperate for the job. Even if they do hire you, it will be very
hard for you to earn respect in your position.

What to say

Before the interview, research the position you're applying for. Don't
ask stupid questions, such as ones that are answered in the first few
lines of the job description on the company's website. Also, if possi-

ble, know a little background information about the person(s) who
will be interviewing you. It can never hurt to establish some

common ground ("1 golf there all the time!"). That said,
don't be afraid to ask intelligent questions and take notes.
You're also there to interview your interviewer, to find

out if this is really where you'd like to work. Write out
some questions beforehand. Make sure you listen at
tentively to answers, because potential employers

may also be judging you on this important skill.
What's also important is how you phrase your
k questions and answers. Speak in a friendly but

subdued manner, enthusiastic but sophisti
cated. And remember never to ask personal
questions or insinuate something about your
linterviewer or employer. It sounds obvious,
'but be careful something doesn't just slip out.

Greeting and departure

When you meet your interviewer, shake hands
and say "Nice to meet you" or "A pleasure to
see you again" or "1 think we spoke on the phone
last Thursday." Smile. Firmly grasp his or her

hand in yours; this is part of being confident.
When the interview is over, shake hands again and

say something appropriate about how you will next interact.

Make sure you know who will

contact whom. Are you sup
posed to follow up in a week?

Will they call you? Find out, and
refer to that moment confident
ly, not cockily, as you take your
leave. For example, "1 look

forward to hearing from
you."

1 Best of luck from the
' Daily to all Stanford in
terviewees.

Another year passes and we all grow older. We all move for
ward in life. We become wiser, more experience and most im
portantly, one year closer to graduating and having to leave the

comfort of Stanford — Egad.

Yes, Seniors, you will very soon have to begin not

just thinking about jobs, but in fact, applying to
them, and not just applying, but actual-

ly holding jobs. To many of you.

this concept is familiar.

You know
about

the nine to five workday, paycheck day, overtime, and other re
sponsibilities associated with holding employment. You even
know what field you're going into, and even what job you plan on
pursuing and even at which company.
But 1 know to many of you, this is just like college all over
again. You don't know much. You don't know where you're
going to apply or what you plan on applying for. You barely have
a sense of what you would really like to do with the rest of your

life. Many of you just think. "Hey, I need money."
Unfortunately for some of you, success does not always occur.

Not everything goes according to plan. Sometimes you have
to make concessions, just like in applying to college.
, Remember those concessions you made? Safety

schools? That's right, those schools you knew you'd get
into. A place where you would go if the rest of the world
> rejected you. Luckily, that didn't happen, and it probably

won't happen now. But you should be prepared for the
worst eventualities.

Which is why 1 have whipped up for you this
lovely little list of safety jobs you can fall back on.
Sure, they might not be the most desirable jobs, but
that's half the point. If they were, they probably
\ wouldn't be safe.

6. Google employee. This isn't to say that
, Google is not a fine company, nor that you

don't need to be talented to work there.
Quite the opposite in fact. 1 highly respect
Google. The reason 1 think Google will be

a safety job is that 1 think Google will end
up taking over all jobs. They will just ex
\ pand and infiltrate every part of every

market. Google will become all en
compassing. First it's Google, then it's
; Google maps, and next up: Google

domination. Not even Starbucks
stands a chance. The best they can

hope for is submitting to the all
l mighty will of Google and beg-

ging for mercy. They just might
\ receive is, since Google will be

an awesome and benevolent
ruler of sorts. Thus, if you

want a job, you'll have one
choice. Your one-stop

shop for all your employ
ment needs. Perhaps

you can work in Google
insurance, or maybe
' Google postal ser-

vice. Maybe even
Google military'.'

Which leads us to our next
I job:

5. Extra in a movie or rebel
army. I lump these two to
gether because they're es
sentially the same thing.

You don't get paid much.

nobody cares about
l you, you sacrifice
I ir c tk a

yourself for "a
greater good," and
there are probably a
lot of people who

untapped in the US! That's right! You'll
have zero competition, which means
you're sure to be hired. You'll be makin 10
cents to the pape, at 1000 papes a day, that's
a 100 quick bucks a day, going at your own

leisurely pace. The other thing that makes
this job so attractive is the movie "Newsies."
If you haven't seen it. do so immediately. It's
about the Newsies strike during the early
1900's. It's produced by Disney, and choreo-

would iiKe iu Kin yuu
because they hate

' what you do. especially
if you end up working

112 J i -
with Tom Cruise (I'm

sorry, Tom Cruise jokes just

don't get old to me). The truth

is, both industries are always looking for extra bodies, especially
fit ones. Disposable ones. Really it's just a matter of where you
want to live. Hollywood or some other sort of dangerous tropical
jungle. Either way you'll be eaten alive, and if you do manage to
make it back to civilization, you'll have a nasty case of syphilis.
But those are the breaks. Job tag: Exotic locations, ooooh.

4. Newsie. Ok, you may be saying to yourself, "What the fuck?"
Please, allow me to explain. 1 visited London, England pretty re
cently. As 1 was walking around the streets, 1 saw the usual affair
of high-end shoppers, common folk, theater goers, pickpockets
— anyone you'd expect to see in New York basically. But then 1
noticed a few individuals standing on street corners. They all had
metal wire racks containing stacks of newspapers. These people
were dressed in regular clothes and just shouting out the name of
the newspaper, expecting to sell it. And that's when 1 thought,
"God, 1 can do belter than that." And that's the basic idea. So can
you. See, as long as you've got a sales pitch, anything to capture
the audience's attention, then you're in like Flint. You're golden.
You'll be pushin' a thousand papes a day easy. All these two bit
hacks in London, they don't know how to work the audience, but
that's where you'll have the advantage, thanks to, well fuck,
you're just smarter than they are. It's really not that hard. Bullet
me let you in on a little secret that makes this job a great safety job
— right now, the newsie market is virtually

lyrics aren't your thing? That's ok.
Don't worry about it. Just steal a

line from a book or another

song, and just put it to a differ
ent tune, and then you're set.
Hell you can probably even
steal the tune too, but just add

a note. That's what Vanilla Ice
did anyway. This job is meant for
you to experiment, have fun, play

around, and make big bucks while
you're doing it. You don't have to be
able to sing, but almost all of you are
in an a capella group anyway, so
it's a moot issue.

2. Telemarketer. This is a
job that anyone from
Stanford ean find suc
cess with. Finally, all
those presentation
skills you ac
quired in

IHUM and

PWR can pay off. But the
best thing is, you don't even

course this is a dramatization.
Whoever it is you were talking to
probably hung up after sir, which
means you didn't even get that far.

3. Popstar. Right now, there are a lot of no talent hacks out there,
making it big because, well honestly, I have no idea why. Because
teenage girls are stupid. But you know what? That s fine. C ur
rently, the pop-music industry is charting even greater expansion
than the golden age of the early 2000's. New pop stars with less
and less talent continue to spring to greater and greater promi
nence. And all you need to get up there is a pretty face, a hip
dance move, and a terribly trite, conceived, and nonsensical cho
rus. There's the simple formula for success. Already, many of you
are off to a strong start. Don't forget that in 2002, Sports Illus
trated for Women voted our men's waterpolo team the sexiest
college sports team to ever walk the face of the earth in Speedos.
And being 2006, we could only have gotten sexier. As for a dance
move, I'm afraid I am unable to help you — I am absurdly white.
When I try to dance, people get hurt. Really.
Lyrics however, that I can help you with. You just need to give
the audience what they want, so all you have to do is know your
audience. Given that your audience is primarily teenage girls, you
can now figure out what they wa. t. If you're a girl, it doesn't re
ally matter what you say. They don't care about what you're say
ing, they just want to be you, so you can literally just go to your
local Chinese restaurant, order some rice, pick up a fortune cook
ie, and you'll have yourself a hit single in no time.
Guys, you have to work slightly harder, but not by much.
Teenage girls want to think that you're talking directly to them,
and lovingly. So, all you need to do is have a chorus with the words
"I," "baby," "love," "you," and "hot." Any combination of these
words will produce a hit single. For instance, the chorus. "Baby, I
love you hot." is a single waiting to happen. Also acceptable are
"Hot love, 1 baby you." "You hot, I love, baby." and"I you baby
love hot."' Don't feel limited to just these words. If you insert

But that is to be expected. After all, j
this is your safest safety job, which
means that you must be very well ac
quainted with the idea of rejection at
this point. But think about the bene-

fits. Work at home. Good pay. Talk
to interesting people, if only for a sec
ond. Gives you that time you always
wanted to write that novel you've
been thinking of. The possibilities are
virtually limitless. Of course, everyone
will hate you. Oh well.

1. Professional Student. I mean hell,
you're doing it already — you have a good
16 years experience at least. The big prob
lem which we were trying to address was
going out into the real world and getting a
job, but if you're a student all the time, it's

no longer a problem! Problem solved!
Sweet! Plus, who is going to reject a

your money? 1 mean, really.

So you see Seniors, you have
nothing to worry about. There

are plenty of job options available

other words, like "and," "yeah." or "mendula oblongata," people
will think you're original. And maybe

and waiting for you; you just have to go out there and
find them.
