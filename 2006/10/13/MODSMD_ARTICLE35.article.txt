11 you're looking for a quiet, hole-in-the
wall restaurant still full of charm, be sure to
check out Bangkok Cuisine, located right off
University Avenue on Lytton Avenue.
Don 't be surprised if you have to search a bit,
however; set amidst a slew of office buildings,
this Thai eatery is hardly noticeable, but it's
definitely worth the hunt.
You will most likely be seated as soon as
you enter — Bangkok Cuisine is never too
crowded — and expect nothing less than
friendly, prompt Service from any of the wait
ers. Most items are around ten dollars as well,
making Bangkok a great practical choice for
the typical college student.
If you'd like a cozy experience and don't
care too much about dtScor, inside seating is
fine. However, there is a patio in the back of
the restaurant ideal for parties, a delightful
first date or just a casual, cheery night out.
Complete with colored Christmas lights,
greenery, canopies, a candle on each table
and portable heaters, this seating area is just
festive enough to put you in a good mood
after a long day of work — yet not overdone.
Looking for a sweet, refreshing drink to
start off your meal? Try the Thai Iced Tea or
Thai iced Coffee for an exotic twist on your
regular beverage fare. Bangkok's tea is
sweeter and less strong than the typical
recipe, which works well for those unaccus
tomed to the acquired taste. However, if
you've downed a Thai Iced Tea or two in
your day, this selection might seem less fla
vorful than you expect.
For a tasty appetizer, go for Thai Crispy
Noodles, otherwise known as Mee-Grob.
This traditional Thai starter consists of crispy
rice noodles in a sweet and sour sauce, com
plete with shrimp and tofu. More sweet than
sour, Mee-Grob provides a light, crisp way to
start off your meal (or end it, if you're too
cheap for dessert).
Bangkok Cuisine also has an extensive
array of traditional Thai entrees, ranging
from meaty beef, pork or poultry dishes to
seafood items. In addition, the restaurant
provides a separate vegetarian menu for
those who prefer tofu. All entrees come with
your choice of steamed or brown rice, with
the exception of noodle or fried rice dishes.
A popular choice for chicken lovers is the
Pa-Nang Chicken. The chickcn is thinly
sliced, then cooked in a panany curry and co
conut milk broth, along with bell pepper and
sweet basil. The coconut milk has a some
what neutralizing effect on the spicy curry,
but mild tongues beware: keep a glass of
