### STEPHANIE VEZICH INTERMISSION FOOD HUNTER EMMA TROTTER FACEBOOK STALKER 
11 you're looking for a quiet, hole-in-the
wall restaurant still full of charm, be sure to
check out Bangkok Cuisine, located right off
University Avenue on Lytton Avenue.
Don 't be surprised if you have to search a bit,
however; set amidst a slew of office buildings,
this Thai eatery is hardly noticeable, but it's
definitely worth the hunt.
You will most likely be seated as soon as
you enter — Bangkok Cuisine is never too
crowded — and expect nothing less than
friendly, prompt Service from any of the wait
ers. Most items are around ten dollars as well,

making Bangkok a great practical choice for
the typical college student.
If you'd like a cozy experience and don't
care too much about dtScor, inside seating is
fine. However, there is a patio in the back of
the restaurant ideal for parties, a delightful
first date or just a casual, cheery night out.
Complete with colored Christmas lights,
greenery, canopies, a candle on each table
and portable heaters, this seating area is just
festive enough to put you in a good mood
after a long day of work — yet not overdone.
Looking for a sweet, refreshing drink to
start off your meal? Try the Thai Iced Tea or
Thai iced Coffee for an exotic twist on your
regular beverage fare. Bangkok's tea is

sweeter and less strong than the typical
recipe, which works well for those unaccus
tomed to the acquired taste. However, if
you've downed a Thai Iced Tea or two in
your day, this selection might seem less fla
vorful than you expect.
For a tasty appetizer, go for Thai Crispy
Noodles, otherwise known as Mee-Grob.
This traditional Thai starter consists of crispy
rice noodles in a sweet and sour sauce, com
plete with shrimp and tofu. More sweet than
sour, Mee-Grob provides a light, crisp way to
start off your meal (or end it, if you're too
cheap for dessert).
Bangkok Cuisine also has an extensive
array of traditional Thai entrees, ranging

from meaty beef, pork or poultry dishes to
seafood items. In addition, the restaurant
provides a separate vegetarian menu for
those who prefer tofu. All entrees come with
your choice of steamed or brown rice, with
the exception of noodle or fried rice dishes.
A popular choice for chicken lovers is the
Pa-Nang Chicken. The chickcn is thinly
sliced, then cooked in a panany curry and co
conut milk broth, along with bell pepper and
sweet basil. The coconut milk has a some
what neutralizing effect on the spicy curry,
but mild tongues beware: keep a glass of
Killer postcard. It made me laugh at least 3 times, and then
I read it again. And then once more just to be sure. We'll
most definitely discuss your new insights into Western
Culture.

Happy Birthday - don't bleb on the couch!
Sometimes I think I am "gangsta" and regularly wear my
all black, Stanford-issued "thug" gear around campus
just because you judge everything that moves doesn't
mean you don't do everything that moves.
My mother is an intelligent woman. She really is. Some
how, she never saw the irony in calling me "son-of-a
bitch."

ination.

Of course, you can adjust how hot you would like any entree,
which is probably a good idea if you can't handle anything too
spicy, particularly if you are ordering a curry.
If you're looking to get in the autumn mood and aren't afraid
to try something unconventional, order the Ka-Ree Pumpkin,
which consists of fried tofu, pumpkin, bell pepper, carrot, onion,
egg and curry powder. The pumpkin doesn't have much flavor
on its own but instead absorbs the essence of the curry, making
it seem more like potato only with a softer consistency. Overall,
however, the dish is delicious, albeit unusual.
Just want a normal, generic Thai dish? Get the Pad Thai and
you won't be disappointed. Bangkok's variation on this tradi
tional meal includes noodles with tofu, bean sprouts, onion, car
rot, broccoli, baby corn and egg. It is also on the milder side, per
fect for those averse to the sometimes fire-hot spice in much of
Thai cuisine.
And. of course, who doesn't save room for dessert? Bangkok
Cuisine has a fairly large selection of dessert items, including
Bangkok Ice Cream (which is homemade and has a jackfruit fla
vor) and deep-fried bananas, both sinfully delectable indul
gences.
Reasonably priced and filled with quaint appeal. Bangkok
Cuisine is a fabulous choice for the starving college student, or
anyone interested in authentic Thai cooking. It's only a five to
ten minute bike ride or two minute car trip away from the cen
ter of campus, so check it out on your next escapade into the
city!

Of course, you can adjust how hot you would like any entree,
which is probably a good idea if you can't handle anything too
spicy, particularly if you are ordering a curry.
If you're looking to get in the autumn mood and aren't afraid
to try something unconventional, order the Ka-Ree Pumpkin,
which consists of fried tofu, pumpkin, bell pepper, carrot, onion,
egg and curry powder. The pumpkin doesn't have much flavor
on its own but instead absorbs the essence of the curry, making
it seem more like potato only with a softer consistency. Overall,
however, the dish is delicious, albeit unusual.
Just want a normal, generic Thai dish? Get the Pad Thai and
you won't be disappointed. Bangkok's variation on this tradi
tional meal includes noodles with tofu, bean sprouts, onion, car
rot, broccoli, baby corn and egg. It is also on the milder side, per
fect for those averse to the sometimes fire-hot spice in much of
Thai cuisine.
And. of course, who doesn't save room for dessert? Bangkok
Cuisine has a fairly large selection of dessert items, including
Bangkok Ice Cream (which is homemade and has a jackfruit fla
vor) and deep-fried bananas, both sinfully delectable indul
gences.
Reasonably priced and filled with quaint appeal. Bangkok
Cuisine is a fabulous choice for the starving college student, or
anyone interested in authentic Thai cooking. It's only a five to
ten minute bike ride or two minute car trip away from the cen
ter of campus, so check it out on your next escapade into the

$$
Lunch: Mon-Fri 11-3, Sat-Sun 12-3
Dinner: Sun-Sat 5-10
11 you're looking for a quiet, hole-in-the
wall restaurant still full of charm, be sure to
check out Bangkok Cuisine, located right off
University Avenue on Lytton Avenue.
Don 't be surprised if you have to search a bit,
however; set amidst a slew of office buildings,
this Thai eatery is hardly noticeable, but it's
definitely worth the hunt.
You will most likely be seated as soon as
you enter — Bangkok Cuisine is never too
crowded — and expect nothing less than
friendly, prompt Service from any of the wait
ers. Most items are around ten dollars as well,

making Bangkok a great practical choice for
the typical college student.
If you'd like a cozy experience and don't
care too much about dtScor, inside seating is
fine. However, there is a patio in the back of
the restaurant ideal for parties, a delightful
first date or just a casual, cheery night out.
Complete with colored Christmas lights,
greenery, canopies, a candle on each table
and portable heaters, this seating area is just
festive enough to put you in a good mood
after a long day of work — yet not overdone.
Looking for a sweet, refreshing drink to
start off your meal? Try the Thai Iced Tea or
Thai iced Coffee for an exotic twist on your
regular beverage fare. Bangkok's tea is

sweeter and less strong than the typical
recipe, which works well for those unaccus
tomed to the acquired taste. However, if
you've downed a Thai Iced Tea or two in
your day, this selection might seem less fla
vorful than you expect.
For a tasty appetizer, go for Thai Crispy
Noodles, otherwise known as Mee-Grob.
This traditional Thai starter consists of crispy
rice noodles in a sweet and sour sauce, com
plete with shrimp and tofu. More sweet than
sour, Mee-Grob provides a light, crisp way to
start off your meal (or end it, if you're too
cheap for dessert).
Bangkok Cuisine also has an extensive
array of traditional Thai entrees, ranging

from meaty beef, pork or poultry dishes to
seafood items. In addition, the restaurant
provides a separate vegetarian menu for
those who prefer tofu. All entrees come with
your choice of steamed or brown rice, with
the exception of noodle or fried rice dishes.
A popular choice for chicken lovers is the
Pa-Nang Chicken. The chickcn is thinly
sliced, then cooked in a panany curry and co
conut milk broth, along with bell pepper and
sweet basil. The coconut milk has a some
what neutralizing effect on the spicy curry,
but mild tongues beware: keep a glass of
Killer postcard. It made me laugh at least 3 times, and then
I read it again. And then once more just to be sure. We'll
most definitely discuss your new insights into Western
Culture.
