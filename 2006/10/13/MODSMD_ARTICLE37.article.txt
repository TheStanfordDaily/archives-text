## Roxy does double duty 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Last week during her Public Policy lecture, Roxy
found it difficult to quell her delighted cackles as she
clicked her way through 500 questions of an online Pu
rity Test. Russian fingers, bondage, necrophilia? Oh
my. Besides reliving many of her fondest sexcapades,
Roxy added many a new trick to her ex-

tensive list To Do' list.
Roxy was also forced to recall a few of her more un
pleasant experiences, such as the time when she, a (rel
atively) innocent eight-year-old, made the horrible,
horrible mistake of grooming a horse to an impressive,
well, boner. Roxy kids you not. Bio majors, it was two
feet long. But that is another story for another time.
Roxy would much rather dwell on the many pleas
ant times she has committed an oops, then joined in or

fantasized about her long-term instructor or

Isshaved or shaped her hair down there in a
I particular design.
Roxy's purity score shall remain a secret,
J but find out your own, oh so bored Stanford
students, at http://www.puritytest.net. Roxy
guarantees a few laughs and some killer ideas
for your next sack session, trip to the Mau
soleum or whatever it is that lights your fire.
In addition to being inspiring and
generally a lot of fun, the Purity Test gave
Roxy an idea for this column. Is it appropriate
■ to have sex or otherwise fool around during a
| womanls period?
Roxy's personal opinion is, in short, yes.
Roxy is all about sex - whenever, wherever and
with whomever or whatever. But she knows
what you're thinking, sex-starved Stanford stu
dents, whose idea of a Friday night hook-up is

reading this column. Read on, and let Roxy spread your
horizons and, she dearly hopes, your legs.
For starters, it's just blood.
But ew, you are thinking. It is just plain gross. No!
Girls, everyone knows you menstruate every month,
and half the people on this campus are doing it with
you. Do you want to be ashamed of that? Do you want
to miss out on getting freaky for a week out of every
four? Roxy didn't think so!
Guys, if you use a condom (get your free twelve for
this quarter at Vaden's SHPRC!), odds are you won't
even notice. And girls, if you are starting to get mad at
Roxy for taking away your bona fide excuse to cuddle
instead, please don't send any threatening emails. Trust
her, it is easy to gross guys out about this. Not recom
mended, unless, for some inexplicable reason, you
don't want to have sex. Roxy can't understand it, but
you can always just say you have cramps. Feel free to go
into horrible detail.
If ayou choose to go for it, never look back! Roxy
would like to recommend, from her extensive personal
experience, cowgirl (just leave your panties on, ladies)
or modified missionary (blood can't defy gravity).
Enjoy yourselves, whether you're slender, regular, or
super plus!
