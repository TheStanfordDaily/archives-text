If not, hey, at least you got another sort of "OH"
2. Clubs
What better way to meet new people and be as
overachieving as you were in high school than
by joining a club? Clubs are a great way to find
that special someone with whom you can
share a mutual love of world peace, human
rights and ... bondage. Why not reenact the
violent arrests of Ejackistan in your dorm
room? Or, better yet, next to those creepy,
dark statues in the Quad. You'll fit right in
with the chains and handcuffs, and can
comment on how tortured they look while
inflicting (or receiving) some pain of your

•abroad once. She spent a year learning Spanish, al
ii it turned out the only words she really needed to
were si, no and cigarillo.
Considering the abo.ve three examples and the fact that the

Much Lust,
Roxy
P.S. When Roxy said "getting together like rabbits," she
didn't necessarily mean doin' it with somebody else. Check
