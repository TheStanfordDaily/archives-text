## 
### Andrew Lomeli Desk editor 
Last night ushered in a new era in Southern Cal
ifornia athletics, as the No. 6 Stanford women's vol
leyball team traveled to No. 4 USC in the grand
opening of the Galen Center â€” the home for Tro
jans basketball and volleyball.
But the opening was anything but grand for the
Trojans (17-1, 6-1 Pacific-10 Conference), who
dropped their first match of the season to Stanford
(14-2,5-1 Pac-10) in three games.
The Cardinal hit .309 for the match while hold
ing USC to .165. Sophomore outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza posted a .341 average,junior outside hitter
Franci Girard held a match-high .588 and sopho
more middle blocker Foluke Akinradewo collected
12 kills. Stanford also edged the Trojans in blocks,
seven to four.
Before last night, none of the Pac-10's five high
est ranked teams had lost a home game all season.
"I think it's huge," head coach John Dunning
said. "We played very well, and this will give us a lot
of confidence as we head to UCLA tomorrow."
The Women of Troy jumped to an early 5-0 lead
in game one, forcing Dunning to call the Cardinal's
first timeout. Barboza notched a kill out of the
break for Stanford's first point. Following the brief
USC run, the two squads exchanged points until
the Cardinal collected three straight to pull within
