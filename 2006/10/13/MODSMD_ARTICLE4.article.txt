# Card hand USC first home loss
## 
### Andrew Lomeli Desk editor 
Last night ushered in a new era in Southern Cal
ifornia athletics, as the No. 6 Stanford women's vol
leyball team traveled to No. 4 USC in the grand
opening of the Galen Center — the home for Tro
jans basketball and volleyball.
But the opening was anything but grand for the
Trojans (17-1, 6-1 Pacific-10 Conference), who
dropped their first match of the season to Stanford
(14-2,5-1 Pac-10) in three games.
The Cardinal hit .309 for the match while hold
ing USC to .165. Sophomore outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza posted a .341 average,junior outside hitter
Franci Girard held a match-high .588 and sopho
more middle blocker Foluke Akinradewo collected
12 kills. Stanford also edged the Trojans in blocks,
seven to four.
Before last night, none of the Pac-10's five high
est ranked teams had lost a home game all season.
"I think it's huge," head coach John Dunning
said. "We played very well, and this will give us a lot
of confidence as we head to UCLA tomorrow."
The Women of Troy jumped to an early 5-0 lead
in game one, forcing Dunning to call the Cardinal's
first timeout. Barboza notched a kill out of the
break for Stanford's first point. Following the brief
USC run, the two squads exchanged points until
the Cardinal collected three straight to pull within
one at 13-14.
The Trojans called their first
timeout, but it didn't help as Stan
ford quickly tied it up and took its
first lead of the match. The Cardi
nal took a three-point lead at 18-15,
prompting another Trojan timeout.
USC kept it close and came to
within two at 22-20, but Stanford
went on a 5-0 run to put the game
out of reach. A Trojan hitting error
at game point sealed the Cardinal
victory. 30-21.
"We called the timeout and
then just took it one point at a
time," Dunning said. "We clawed
back and ran some streaks at them
and just played well the whole
game."
Ilie two teams struggled for

control in the first half of game two,
though the Cardinal maintained
the minor lead until a media time
out was called at 15-14. Stanford
then struck with a 5-2 run capped
by a Richards kill, forcing I JSC to
call its first timeout. The Trojans
would close in on Stanford's lead,
but the Cardinal momentum
proved too much as Stanford sailed
to a 30-26 win. The loss sent USC
into halftime with their first 0-2
deficit all season.
Stanford looked strong out of
the gate in game three, nabbing the
early 17-12 lead. But the Women of
Troy responded to the deficit, col
lecting 10 straight points to steal
the momentum and the lead,22-17.
It appeared USC would run away

with the game when they earned
the 26-20 lead, but Stanford ex
ploded for a 9-2 run to force match
point. Girard then notched an ace
to secure the 30-28 win.
"It was a bizarre game," Dun
ning said. "We had worked our way
to a lead and then lost it and came
up with some great plays. It took
two great serves and a tough team
effort to overcome a crowd that
was going crazy."
The teams kept the third game
competitive as the Cardinal and
the Trojans hit .280 and .279. re
spectively.

morrow night at 7 p.m. The Bruins
