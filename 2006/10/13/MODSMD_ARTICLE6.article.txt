## Turnaround no easy task Stoops struggles to build winner in third year at the helm of Arizona program 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
In 2(X)3, Mike Stoops was at the top of
the college coaching world. He was co-de
fensive coordinator for then-top ranked
Oklahoma, had a national championship
under his belt and was a leading head
coaching candidate.
So when Stoops took the top post with
the University of Arizona program follow
ing the 2003 season, there was no shortage
of expectations. It was easy to predict big
things for Stoops, who had built one of the
stingiest defenses in the country at Okla
homa.
Stoops also came highly recommended,
albeit by his brother Bob, head coach at Ok
lahoma, who actively supported his broth
er's candidacy for head coaching vacancies.
Mike Stoops brought in a proven staff
around him. including younger brother
Mark as defensive coordinator.
At age 41. he came in young, ambitious
and eager to change the fortunes of a team
that went 2-9 in 2003.
"We're going to be ready to play when
we start in September," he said at his intro

ductory press conference in Nov. 2003.
"We're going to have a defense that attacks
people from a hunch of different ways, and
we're going to have an offense that's going
to spread people out and make them de
fend the whole field."
Nearly three years later, it has become
clear that turning around a program that
has failed to make a bowl appearance since
1998 is no easy task.
In his first two-plus seasons at the helm.
Stoops has led the Wildcats to just eight
wins, five against Division I-A opposition.
Arizona enters tomorrow's game against
Stanford tied with the Cardinal for last
place in the Pac-10.
"There are some things that are broken
and obviously need to be fixed," Stoops said
during his weekly press conference. "Things
don't seem to be working as well as we
would have liked."
That reality especially holds true on the
offensive side of the bail, where the Wild
cats are among the worst units in the coun
try. Arizona is last in the Pac-10 in rushing
offense, total offense and scoring offense.
As a defensive specialist, it has been a
painful experience for Stoops to witness the
ease with which opposing defenses have
dominated his offensive squad.
"We have three straight games with neg
ative rushing yards — that has severely lim
ited our progress offensively and has
stressed us in a variety of ways," Stoops said.
"People are blitzing us and attacking us on

the run and the pass. As a defensive coach. 1
know that is something that you shouldn't
be able to get away with, but they are. That
bothers me."
But it hasn't all been bad news for
Stoops and the Wildcats. Arizona's defense
has shown flashes of brilliance, reminiscent
of the dominant Sooners he once coached.
Against USC on Sept. 23. the Wildcats lim
ited the Trojans to 20 points — the fewest
USC had manufactured in their last 57
games.
Even last season, when the Wildcats fin
ished 3-8. there were some bright spots, in
cluding a 52-14 drubbing in the desert over
then-No. 7 and previously undefeated
UCLA.
Stoops has also used his powerful re
sume to help draw in recruits.The freshman
classes in both 2005 and 2006 were ranked
among the best in the nation. But the influx
of young talent makes the lack of overall
success even harder to stomach.
"We have some good players out there,
but we have to put them in better situa
tions," Stoops said after last week's 27-7 loss
to UCLA. "That's our responsibility as
coaches."
Even with a win over Stanford tomor
row, the Wildcats will likely still fall short of
a bowl for the eighth straight season. But a
victory would elevate Arizona out of the
bottom spot in the Pac-10 and give Stoops
something to build upon in the final weeks
of the season.

SPORTS BRIEFS
Cal linebacker suspended
indefinitely following
altercation at strip club
The UC-Berkeley Athletic Department
has suspended senior linebacker Chris Purtz
indefinitely from the football team after
Purtz allegedly used derogatory terms for a
homosexual and an African American dur
ing a physical confrontation with an employ
ee at San Francisco's Lusty Lady adult club
early Sunday.
According to Lusty Lady employee Dee
Timmons, a visibly intoxicated Purtz en
tered a video pornography booth at the club
while his friend asked for prostitutes for the
two men. as was first reported by the Daily
Californian yesterday. Purtz then insulted
Timmons with the homophobic and racial
slurs, according to Timmons and two other
club employees.
Club employees then claim they forcibly
removed Purtz from the building, and secu
rity camera footage viewed by the Daily
Californian shows Purtz "banging on the
door and yelling inside for several minutes."
Lusty Lady employee Tristan Heydt sent
an email about the incident to Cal Athletic
Director Sandy Barbour and the Daily Cal
ifornian. sparking the suspension of Purtz
and a formal investigation by Cal Athletics.
Purtz admits going to the club, but denies
any wrongdoing.
"After seeing that email, it's completely
inaccurate." Purtz told the Daily Californ
ian. "He tried to portray me as someone
who's racist — I'm not.Tried to portray me
as someone who's egotistical — I'm not.
"I would really hope that if anybody felt
that there's any truth to this man's claims
that they'd talk to me before they believe
any of it. I'm willing to talk to anybody about
this nonsense."
Nonetheless, Cal Athletics spokesperson
John Sudsbury said Purtz has been indeli
nitely suspended from the team.
"We're still evaluating the situation."
Sudsbury told the Daily California!!. "[lt is
Coach Jeff Tedford's| decision on if and
when he comes back."
Purtz, a reserve, has recorded two tackles
this season.
