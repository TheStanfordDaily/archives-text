## Cal linebacker suspended indefinitely following altercation at strip club 
### 
The UC-Berkeley Athletic Department
has suspended senior linebacker Chris Purtz
indefinitely from the football team after
Purtz allegedly used derogatory terms for a
homosexual and an African American dur
ing a physical confrontation with an employ
ee at San Francisco's Lusty Lady adult club
early Sunday.
According to Lusty Lady employee Dee
Timmons, a visibly intoxicated Purtz en
tered a video pornography booth at the club
while his friend asked for prostitutes for the
two men. as was first reported by the Daily
Californian yesterday. Purtz then insulted

Timmons with the homophobic and racial
slurs, according to Timmons and two other
club employees.
Club employees then claim they forcibly
removed Purtz from the building, and secu
rity camera footage viewed by the Daily
Californian shows Purtz "banging on the
door and yelling inside for several minutes."
Lusty Lady employee Tristan Heydt sent
an email about the incident to Cal Athletic
Director Sandy Barbour and the Daily Cal
ifornian. sparking the suspension of Purtz
and a formal investigation by Cal Athletics.
Purtz admits going to the club, but denies
any wrongdoing.
"After seeing that email, it's completely
inaccurate." Purtz told the Daily Californ
ian. "He tried to portray me as someone
who's racist — I'm not.Tried to portray me
as someone who's egotistical — I'm not.
"I would really hope that if anybody felt

that there's any truth to this man's claims
that they'd talk to me before they believe
any of it. I'm willing to talk to anybody about
this nonsense."
Nonetheless, Cal Athletics spokesperson
John Sudsbury said Purtz has been indeli
nitely suspended from the team.
"We're still evaluating the situation."
Sudsbury told the Daily California!!. "[lt is
Coach Jeff Tedford's| decision on if and
when he comes back."
Purtz, a reserve, has recorded two tackles
this season.
