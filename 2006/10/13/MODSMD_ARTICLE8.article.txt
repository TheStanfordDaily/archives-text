## Students fast for Darfur benefit Thousands sign petition, skip meals: fund helps raise $27,000 
### EMMA TROTTER 
More than 2.000 Stanford students pledged
to last yesterday in a show of solidarity with
the \ ie'.ims of the ongoing genocide in I )arfur.
Sudan, raising $27,000 in the process.
For the event, organized by Students Tak
ing Action Now: Darfur (STAND), partici
pants agreed to fast all day or give up a partic
ular food item. Some also donated to human
it.man organizations active in Darfur, includ
ing Doctors Without Borders. For each stu
dent participant, the Pierre and Pamela
Omidyar Fund donated an additional $5.
which, according to the World Food Program,
can feed up to 10 refugees. In addition, the
Fund will match one to one all donations by
Stanford affiliates.
Stanford STAND Coordinator Nikki Sera
pio. a senior, said that while not eating for one
day does not sufficiently put a student in a
refugee's shoes, it is still an important gesture.
"Fasting is a tool for reminding ourselves
that there's a genocide on our watch: there are
millions who are constantly hungry, thousands
who have been gang-raped, an entire people
who need NATO and UN protection now." he
said.
S TAND organizer James Vaughan, a soph
omore. agreed.
"STAND chose to fast as a way of acknowl
edging our lifestyles here and standing in soli
darity with the people in Darfur." he said, "it
was also a way to advocate and spread the
issue."
Because the fast coincided with the month
long Islamic holiday of Ramadan, many stu
dents said they simply signed up because they
were already going without food.
"I've been fasting for a month now.and it is
very difficult because you don't get anything
in the morning to get you going." said fresh
man Fahad Mahmood. w ho fasted.
Organizers said that the sponsorship of the
Omidyar Fund helped widen the impact of
STAND'S fast because of the Fund's substan
tial financial base and established tradition of
humanitarian aid.
"They've been an inspiring local leader in
providing food and care to the people of Darfur
among other things, they've contributed
over $1 million to the WFP's essential programs
in Western Sudan and Chad." Serapio said.
