# GRAND THEFT LAPTOP LOOTERS STRIKE EBF, POLICE URGE CAUTION
## 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRETER 
First, the Defenestration of Prague. Now
this.
Sophomore James Vaughan was the lat
est victim of crime through a window Tues
day night, when a thief cut a hole in his
screen and swiped his laptop, which he
called "an old, beat up Toshiba."
"1 looked at my desk, and my laptop was
not there." said Vaughan, who lives on the
first floor of Enchanted Broccoli Forest
(EBF). "I looked up and the cords were
hanging out of the window. 1 know I didn't
lose it.since 1 wouldn't have thrown my lap
top out the window."
But the night was still young for the EBF
thief. Forty minutes later, another EBF' resi
dent. sophomore Danny Neumann, found

his laptop missing. A purse and a wallet were
also stolen from the house sometime I'ues
day evening, Vaughan said.
Somebody, it seems, went four-for-four
that night.
According to the public crime bulletin,
the Stanford Police Department received
notice of the laptop thefts the same evening,
though the stolen purse and wallet were not
recorded. Police officials said they are work
ing on the case.
"It's not unusual for two laptops to be
stolen at once." said Detective Mark True
blood. the investigating officer on the case.
"We have had windows cut before. We've
had everything happen you could imagine."
Trueblood said that the thefts were relat
ed, suggesting that the thieves were proba
bly looking for a "quick grab."
The police reported no suspects and no

leads, but they do have an idea of where not
to look — other EBF residents.
"It's somebody from outside,"Trueblood
said."That's what it looks like."
Vaughan concurred, arguing that since
his room faces the most social area around
EBF, it was ideally located for someone to
steal his laptop on their way into or out of
the building. With his blinds open and his
laptop in plain sight, it was a prime target.
The house itself, however, was quiet. Ac
cording to Vaughan, there wasn't anything
going on that would attract people other
than residents.
Trueblood said that he was following
standard procedure for such situations, by
sending an email to residents advising them
to raise their levels of caution.
The officer who reported to the scene of
the crimes also dusted for prints and looked

for other forensic evidence, but the search
didn't turn up anything usable.
The next step is the "knock and talk."
"In this week and early next week, I'll be
knocking around.'Trueblood said."We'll be
looking for plate numbers and any descrip
tions."
But the chances of finding Vaughan's lap
top are not much better than it jumping back
through the window.
According to the Department of Public
Safety, there were 75 laptop thefts and bur
glaries reported from September 2005
through June 2006. From September 1.200b
through the beginning of October, they have
been seven such thefts.
Meanwhile, Vaughan has purchased a
new laptop, thanks to homeowner's insur
ance and understanding parents. And this
time, he has a lock.
