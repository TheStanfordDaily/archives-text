Harold P. Freeman, MD
President, Founder and Medical Director
Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention
Wednesday, October 18, 2006 at 5:00 pm
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Auditorium
Harold I'. Freeman, M.D., is president, founder, and medical director of the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention in New
York. Dr. Freeman is also senior advisor to the director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and is responsible for strategies to achieve
NCl's 20IS goal to eliminate cancer health disparities. He is a also professor of clinical surgery at Columbia University College of
Physicians and Surgeons. As national president of the American Cancer Society from l l )K8-l l ) 8 (), Dr. Freeman was the chief architect of
the Society's initiative on Cancer in the Poor and is a leading authority on the interrelationships between race, poverty, and cancer. In
addition, Dr. Freeman pioneered the "Patient Navigation Program' 1 which addresses disparities in access to treatment, particularly among
poor and uninsured people.
This program is designed to assist medically underserved patients in navigating their way through a complex health system by
overcoming barriers to timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The success of Dr. Freeman 's "Patient Navigation Program" hits led many
other health care organizations to adopt similar initiatives. Based on this model the Patient Navigator and Chronic Disease Prevention Act
was signed into law by President Hush in June 2005.
