### ALEX GOVERE INTERMISSION EDITOR 
Confused about what to do with the rest of
your life? Answer the following questions, and
we will tell you:
1. It's your first month living without the sup
port of mom and dad. You're a little short on
rent money, and have two days to make it. You...
a. Call daddy crying. He'll totally understand,
and might even drop some extra money for
that designer jacket you've been drooling over.
b. Call the landlord and explain that you can't
pay rent in full this month, but that you'll work
overtime until you've made the rest.
c. Sit on the sidewalk outside your apartment
with a sign that reads, "In all honesty, I spent
too much on the Gucci Fall Collection and VIP
at Marquee. I don't have the heart to return the
fabulous shirt I'm wearing, nor do I have the
balls to call my millionaire parents...Spare
change?"
d. Whore yourself for the money. Next time
somebody yells "How much?!" from their car
window, you plan on switching the usual "Fuck
you!" to "$2 dollars, please."
2. Rumor has it you and two of your coworkers
are being considered for a promotion at work.
To make sure you get the job. you...
a. Have daddy call your boss. They're old friends,
and you're sure he can work something out.
b. Impress The Man by working overtime. As a
banker, this means living at the office...As in
toothbrush and fresh undies in the top drawer.
c. Take your boss to dinner, during which you
mention your hard work and jokingly offer fel
latio for a promotion.
d. B + C - "jokingly"
3. Your boss dropped his wallet in front of your
desk. You...
a. Laugh. Your boss' wallet is so empty that it
fell without him noticing. In contrast.your par
ents just wired you birthday money, and your
wallet would probably cause an earthquake
upon hitting the ground.
b. Promptly return it whilst delivering his
morning cup of coffee.
c. Have a laugh at his driver's license photo and
steal a few dollars for lunch.

d. Use his credit cards to purchase illegal
pornography. Have it delivered to his house,
where his unemployed wife will almost certain
ly discover it before he does.
4.The fiat you most identify with is...
a. SAE. Popped collars remind you of your
childhood adventures at the country club.
b. Alpha Kappa Psi. Because you're all about
business.
c. Kappa Sig. Understated pimps.
d. Sigma Chi. Makin' the weekend start on
Thursday...
And now for the life-changing results! Based
on which answer you chose most frequently,
you have been categorized into one ignorant
and stereotypical category. Pay close attention,
as these rulings are permanent, and will have a
deep and everlasting effect on your life:
Mostly A: Trophy Spouse.
If the majority of your answers were 'A,' you're
probably best off being the fine piece of ass on
your husband or wife's arm. The employment
benefits are unbeatable...as long as you put out.
Mostly B: Corporate Bitch.
Seems you're most suited for a job that in
volves kissing butt, making connections, and
climbing a steep ladder to financial success.
Luckily, a Swiss bank account and brand new
Ferrari await your arrival at the top.
Mostly C: Grad Student.
Not quite ready to become the Corporate
Bitch, are ya? Grad school is the perfect place
to practice financial independence, yet remain
as drunk and uninhibited as you were during
your undergraduate years.
Mostly D: You Whore.
Have you ever considered working on cam
pus? And by "on campus," I mean the actual
street, where you should h;ive no trouble sell
ing yourself to desperate college students.
It's a Tie:
Unfortunately, you can't be stereotyped.
Maybe you're destined to become a Corporate
Whore or Trophy Student (otherwise known as
athletes and secretaries).
