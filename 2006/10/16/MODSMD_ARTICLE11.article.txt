Let's face it. Brunch on Sunday
(for those of us who wake up early
enough to catch it) is the best part of
the day. So what if that paper due to
morrow currently consists of noth
ing but a blinking cursor on a blank
Word document? And so what if
we've only touched the first prob
lem of our chemistry problem set.
discouraged by the fact the first one
was just 50... hard. The anxiety fades
away during the sacrosanct mo
ments of brunch, replaced only by
the mental strain of crafting the per
fect waffle or resisting that one last
tater tot.
The best but perhaps most unap
preciated part of brunch, however,
is the style - the unique quirks of
dress and manner that are rarely
witnessed due to the small popula
tion of breakfast-goers on the aver
age weekday. Here are a few trade
marks of the brunch "fashion"
scene:
Slippers
Not the Hip flops that we don every
morning in every season, but the
comfortable "I'm padding around
my house" footwear that make your
toes sing with happiness. Most of
these slippers were probably snuck
back into our suitcases after out
moms took them out and gently told
us that they could not leave the
house, but it's the ratty fuzz that
makes them charming. The most
noteworthy are the furry slippers
that feature ginormous animal faces
- or the ones that look as if they have
been chewed up by ginormous ani
mal faces. The sight of either one
will surely distract you from your
skillful waffle making.
Sweatpants, flannel pants and any
other sort of pajama pant that has
an elastic waistband.
Although many of us rely on these

trusty trousers when we can't hear
to dress ourselves like real grown
ups 10 minutes before class starts,
Sunday brunch features the best
pants of the week. Multicolored
polka dots, geometric designs, car
toon characters. You can tell a lot
about a person's authentic charac
ter from their choice of pant. It
takes some degree of gumption to
walk into the dining hall wearing
Dr. Seuss pants as a legal adult.
The extremes
These outliers break the usual
sweats/slippers/jeans/hoodie con
ventions. Examples include that
girl wearing an intricate Anthro
plogie sundress and matching ac
cessories or that that guy wearing a
spiffy, recently-pressed suit. "How
do they look so put together when
I am barely cognizant?" you won
der. No worries. They are probably
on their way to an interview. Or an
outing with their grandma. Or
maybe they are just really on top of
things. Sigh. Hie other end of this
spectrum includes the people who
don't even bother putting on
sweatpants and just stumble into
brunch wearing a robe. Feel right at
home, kids - as long as your sash
stays in place.
Yesterday-wear
No. this reference does not point to
wards vintage or Goodwill-clad
brunch goers but rather those who
are wearing the exact same outfit
you saw them in Saturday night.
ITiese people generally have good
stories to explain their wrinkly duds.
Except it they are doing their laun
dry. That's no fun (though it is gen
erally a good thing to do).
rhat about rounds out the Sun
day brunch scene. Although the or
ange juice button only yields slight
ly neon water and you are danger
ously close to developing scurvy, the
people watching is unbeatable. So
open those sleep-encrusted eyes
and enjoy.
