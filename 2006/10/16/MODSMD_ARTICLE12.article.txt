## Editorial A 						well-planned initiative 
### 
The Stanford Challenge, an enormous
fundraising campaign that President
Hennessy announced on Tuesday,
may look like the beginning of a sweeping
new phase in the University's develop
ment — a kind of coming-of-age, bringing
I .eland and Jane's famous experiment into
the 2Nt century. But, if you look carefully
at what's been going on for the last couple
of years, it's hard not to view the an
nouncement as the welcome but maybe
not so-surprising culmination of a lengthy
process. A quick look at the ambitious list
of projects to be funded by the five-year,
$4.3 billion campaign provokes more than
a few "A-ha!" moments — moments when
one realizes just how meticulously Hen
nessy and the Board ofTrustees have been
laving the groundwork for Tuesday's "big
news."
Allotting $1.4 billion for multidiscipli
nary initiatives? Well, ever since the Bio-
X program was announced back in 2000,
it's seemed as if Stanford has been rolling
out one well-funded initiative alter an
other. all to great fanfare. So no surprise
there. What about the greater focus on in
ternational students and faculty, coupled
with an emphasis on solving some ot
world's most intractable social and envi
ronmental problems? Well, anyone who
has been tracking President Hennessy's
speeches and travels (and. really, haven't
we all?) must know that, for some time
now. he has been touting our internation
al programs and collaborations as a top
priority, particularly with countries like
India and China. As for the emphasis on
K-12 education, we should have known
that the newly and centrally located Bar
num Center for School and Community
Partnerships signaled the progress of a
something bigger.
One can be forgiven for having failed to
connect the dots. After all. even The Daily,
when it reported on the Stanford Institute
for Creativity and the Arts back in May.
made it sound as it the initiative would only
involve the Art and Art History Depart
ment. Oops. Add to that the Creative Writ
ing, Drama, Music and Dance Departments,
not to mention a new $50 million
performing arts center, and you'll have a
better idea ot the scale the University has in
mind. (By the way, we were very pleased to
hear University Trustee Chairman Burt Mc-
Murtry admit toThe Daily that,"Historical
ly. Stanford has invested [less] in the arts
than in other parts of the University." He's

absolutely right, and change has been a long
time coming.)
Stanford was not the only top-tier uni
versity to announce a major capital cam
paign this fall. On Sept. 30, Yale launched a
five-year, $3 billion campaign called "Yale
Tomorrow" that looks eerily similar to ours
(or perhaps it's the other way around), right
down to the details. Like Stanford, Yale
plans to invest heavily in the medical sci
ences, in the arts, in environmental pro
grams and in international programs that
focus on the emerging Asian powers. And.
like Stanford, Yale is already about halfway
to reaching its goal, a testament to the effec
tiveness of the "silent phase" — the time
before the official rollout of a campaign
when schools line up big donors like the
Mings. Of course, Stanford's announcement
coming on the heels of Yale's will likely give
grist to the arguments of those critics who
feel that private research universities are
pulling an unfair distance ahead of their
public counterparts. But you won't hear us
complaining.
Some within the Stanford community
are going to shrug their shoulders and claim
that this is just the starting gun to another
fundraisingcampaign,a ploy to add to an al
ready enormous endowment that we should
be spending instead of hoarding. But we
feel there really is a broad and detailed plan
at work, a "figure in the carpet," to steal a
phrase from Henry James. The signs all
point to one conclusion:The Stanford Chal
lenge is an event that will shape the Univer
sity's reputation and the feel of the campus
for decades to come. As such, it should be
debated as well as celebrated. For example,
after looking at the broad outlines of the
campaign, two of the things we would like to
see given more emphasis are the quality of
graduate student life, not just its academic
programs, and a stronger reaffirmation of
Stanford's humanities and liberal arts tradi
tion beyond the creative and performing
arts.
In the short term, the Office of Develop
ment will no doubt continue to roll out a
procession of large donations to fund con
spicuous new projects around campus and
overseas. After all. it has announced only
some of the large, public donations, like Phil
Knight's pledge to the Graduate School of
Business, within the billion already
raised. Students and faculty should applaud
these announcements as they come, but
they should also keep an eye on the bigger
picture.
