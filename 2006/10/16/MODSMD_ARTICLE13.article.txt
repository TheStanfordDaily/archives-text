# Whitney Sado: The Public Editor
## 
### 
The Daily devoted two news articles,
one editorial, plenty of photos and an
entire page of feature stories to Full
Moon on the Quad during the past week.
That seems like a reasonable amount of cov
erage for one of Stanford's most, um. vener
ated annual events — until it's compared to
the amount of coverage that has been given
to the two Stanford professors who won
Nobel Prizes last week. One Nobel Prize
winner is big enough news; two Stanford
winners in a single year is titanic. All my love
to Full Moon, but it just can't compete with
an occurrence like that.
There was a brief article about each pro
fessor last week, but these articles weren't
even considered the top news stories of their
respective nights. When you picked up the
paper on Oct. 5 and saw two articles about
dining services ranked above the story about
our second Nobel Prize-winning professor
of the week, you may have wondered how
and why The Daily staff makes the choices it
does in highlighting certain stories.The arti
cle two days earlier about Stanford's first
Nobel Prize winner was similarly below the
fold.
It is often said that we Stanford students
live in a bubble, blissfully preoccupied with
our sheltered and privileged lives as stu
dents. We have a tendency to focus on
things like Full Moon on the Quad at the
expense of larger world issues, and perhaps
The Daily subconsciously reflects or even
encourages this trend. But there are other
factors involved here, and before writing
the student paper off as fluff, we should
consider what else is going on behind the
scenes.
First, when ranking an issue's stories, edi
tors must weigh the relative merits of each
article — not just on the newsworthiness of
the story, but also on the substance of the ar
ticle and the quality of its writing. Unfortu
nately. last week's Nobel Prize articles fell
far short on those secondary considerations.
Moth were essentially news releases that re
hashed information provided by wire servic
es.
Ihis is not really the fault of Daily
staffers, who were promised day-of-an
nouncement phone interviews with the win
ners that never materialized. The writers
were left relying on wire reports for infor
mation. It's hard to write a highly original ar
ticle about a Nobel Prize winner if you can't
talk to hini and most news organizations
have already published their stories. The ar

ticle on Prof. Roger Kornberg at least pro
vided some original spin on a story that
could be found all over the Internet, by in
terviewing Romberg's son, a junior. Still,
neither article was the strongest that the ed
itors had to offer that night, and so were
ranked behind better-written and more sub
stantive articles. Nonetheless, these lead sto
ries were decidedly less timely or important
than the Nobel Prize articles.
Second, the editors assumed, perhaps
naively, that students would read this Nobel
news in other sources like Hie New York
l imes. By virtue of their time and resources,
these sources had earlier and more exten
sive coverage of the Nobel Prize winners
than The Daily could provide. And students
expect ITie Daily to report on the Stanford
specific stories that The New York Times
won't cover.
Ihis exemplifies a judgment call The
Daily's editors often must make — when
they are in a unique position to offer cover
age about campus concerns, how much
space should they devote to an issue that stu
dents will probably read about elsewhere?
Isn't their greatest service to readers to keep
them informed about news they can't get
anywhere else?
Well, yes, this is an extremely important
— and perhaps the ultimate — function of
Ihe Daily as a student newspaper. But I'm
not convinced that this justifies burying the
two articles about the Nobel Prize wins.This
was undoubtedly the biggest news story on
each of those days, and it should have been
splashed across the top of the paper. Eiveti if
the paper's professed focus is on stories that
won't be covered elsewhere — even if the
editors sense that a story about athletes'
Training Table is going to be more widely
read than one about a Medical School pro
fessor winning the Nobel Prize — it still has
a responsibility to prominently report on
matters of global relevance relating to Stan
ford. regardless of the novelty or insightful
ness of the reporting.
So did the editors make the correct deci
sion by not leading with these two Nobel
Prize articles? I don't think so.They can cer
tainly argue that they had legitimate
grounds for their choice, but I believe that
the objective overwhelming import of news
stories such as this should override the sub
jective analysis of an article's journalistic
quality.
In the paper's defense, yesterday's issue
had a great lead story on the two winners. As
soon as The Daily was able to speak to the
two winners, the monumental event was ad
equately covered. But the fact remains that
when the Nobel Prizes were fresh news, the
stories were not given the weight they de
served.
As a final note. 1 love the comments I've

gotten from people who are happy (and
amused) that I'm still working for The
Daily, even though my undergrad glory
days are behind me. I don't want to discour
age anyone from keeping those day-bright
eners coming my way, but I would definite
ly appreciate some student feedback about
the quality of the paper, too.

In the paper's defense, yesterday's issue
had a great lead story on the two winners. As

stories were not given the weight they de

As a final note. 1 love the comments I've

gotten from people who are happy (and
amused) that I'm still working for The

eners coming my way, but I would definite

the quality of the paper, too.

The Daily devoted two news articles,
one editorial, plenty of photos and an
entire page of feature stories to Full
Moon on the Quad during the past week.
That seems like a reasonable amount of cov
erage for one of Stanford's most, um. vener
ated annual events — until it's compared to
the amount of coverage that has been given
to the two Stanford professors who won
Nobel Prizes last week. One Nobel Prize
winner is big enough news; two Stanford
winners in a single year is titanic. All my love
to Full Moon, but it just can't compete with
an occurrence like that.
There was a brief article about each pro
fessor last week, but these articles weren't
even considered the top news stories of their
respective nights. When you picked up the
paper on Oct. 5 and saw two articles about
dining services ranked above the story about
our second Nobel Prize-winning professor
of the week, you may have wondered how
and why The Daily staff makes the choices it
does in highlighting certain stories.The arti
cle two days earlier about Stanford's first
Nobel Prize winner was similarly below the
fold.
It is often said that we Stanford students
live in a bubble, blissfully preoccupied with
our sheltered and privileged lives as stu
dents. We have a tendency to focus on
things like Full Moon on the Quad at the
expense of larger world issues, and perhaps
The Daily subconsciously reflects or even
encourages this trend. But there are other
factors involved here, and before writing
the student paper off as fluff, we should
consider what else is going on behind the
scenes.
First, when ranking an issue's stories, edi
tors must weigh the relative merits of each
article — not just on the newsworthiness of
the story, but also on the substance of the ar
ticle and the quality of its writing. Unfortu
nately. last week's Nobel Prize articles fell
far short on those secondary considerations.
Moth were essentially news releases that re
hashed information provided by wire servic
es.
Ihis is not really the fault of Daily
staffers, who were promised day-of-an
nouncement phone interviews with the win
ners that never materialized. The writers
were left relying on wire reports for infor
mation. It's hard to write a highly original ar
ticle about a Nobel Prize winner if you can't
talk to hini and most news organizations
have already published their stories. The ar

ticle on Prof. Roger Kornberg at least pro
vided some original spin on a story that
could be found all over the Internet, by in
terviewing Romberg's son, a junior. Still,
neither article was the strongest that the ed
itors had to offer that night, and so were
ranked behind better-written and more sub
stantive articles. Nonetheless, these lead sto
ries were decidedly less timely or important
than the Nobel Prize articles.
Second, the editors assumed, perhaps
naively, that students would read this Nobel
news in other sources like Hie New York
l imes. By virtue of their time and resources,
these sources had earlier and more exten
sive coverage of the Nobel Prize winners
than The Daily could provide. And students
expect ITie Daily to report on the Stanford
specific stories that The New York Times
won't cover.
Ihis exemplifies a judgment call The
Daily's editors often must make — when
they are in a unique position to offer cover
age about campus concerns, how much
space should they devote to an issue that stu
dents will probably read about elsewhere?
Isn't their greatest service to readers to keep
them informed about news they can't get
anywhere else?
Well, yes, this is an extremely important
— and perhaps the ultimate — function of
Ihe Daily as a student newspaper. But I'm
not convinced that this justifies burying the
two articles about the Nobel Prize wins.This
was undoubtedly the biggest news story on
each of those days, and it should have been
splashed across the top of the paper. Eiveti if
the paper's professed focus is on stories that
won't be covered elsewhere — even if the
editors sense that a story about athletes'
Training Table is going to be more widely
read than one about a Medical School pro
fessor winning the Nobel Prize — it still has
a responsibility to prominently report on
matters of global relevance relating to Stan
ford. regardless of the novelty or insightful
ness of the reporting.
