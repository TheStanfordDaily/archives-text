# The
						history of towers at Stanford
## 
### 
Stanford University's founding grant, a
copy of which you'll find on the back of
your room's emergency escape plan,
was written in 1885 with several stipulations.
These included the mandatory wearing of
corsets for girls and garter socks for boys, a
practice still observed in Synergy because
their rule-by-consensus makes it difficult to
change anything without a six hour sit-in fol
lowed by 20 years of voting. The founding
grant also mandated that Stanford would
have at least one tower at all times and not be
affiliated with any religion.
Ihe original plans for the Quad, drawn up
in 1884. included a church. Because blue
prints were really hard to change in those
days, the founding grant was too late. Lucki
ly, the 1906 earthquake devastated the build
ing when its 70-foot clock tower crashed into
the facade and crumbled it. The first presi
dent of Stanford, the Jewish studmuffin
David Starr Jordan (named for the Starr ot
David), decided not to rebuild. He felt that
since Jesus was a carpenter, he would have
wanted it that way.
Jane Stanford, a Protestant who donated
heavily to Catholic charities so she would be
regarded as tolerant of dirty Italian and Irish
immigrants invading America — even
though she wasn't — died in 1905. Her will
stated the church should be rebuilt in case of
fire, earthquake or "nucular" attack. She had
signed it with the blood of her lover. I lerbert
Hoover, who was years her junior and
graduated from Stanford in the "pioneer
class" of 1895 with a degree in Belgian
Famine Relief and a minor in The Depres

sion.lTie school had to respect Jane's posthu
mous wishes.
When Herbert entered into gay marriage
with former Stanford classmate Lou Henry,
David Starr Jordan convinced the Board of
Directors that his signature, like that of all
gays, was no longer valid on any legal docu
ments. He destroyed the church and the
tower with it. Herbert Hoover was so dis
traught at the damage he had caused that he
grew determined to build a tower of his own
as soon as he was able to get it up.
During World War I. Herbert and Lou
I lenry led the effort for famine relief in Bel
gium. Since it is widely known that Brussels is
a hotbed of homosexuality, they were accept
ed there as they had not been at David Starr
Jordan's annual "Half Moon Bay Bash and
Weenie Roast." Lou Henry made off with
quite a collection of Belgian lace. (You can
still see it on display in the exhibit room ded
icated to him at Hoover Tower, open from 10
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. every single day, including
Sunday, the Lord's day.)
After reading F. Scott Fitzgerald's "This
Side of Paradise." the book upon which the
very first I HUM, "Sexual Encounters and

Identities at Princeton" a.k.a. "Rosalind
Connage, You a Ho," was based in 1920.
Stanford students and faculty joined the
then communist flapper movement. The
school even changed its mascot from the
borderline-racist Indian to the borderline
stupid Commie Red. Meanwhile, Hoover ex
tended his famine relief efforts in the 1920s
to Bolshevik Russia, inciting everyone on
campus to herald him as a prince among
queens.
In fact,the school allowed him to open the
Hoover Institution in 1919.The tower, which
posed as a conservative think-tank, was real
ly a cover for his second husband, J. Edgar
Hoover's, all-male nude revue and drag
show. When J. Edgar I loover became head ot
the F. 8.1, in 1924. he cut ties with Bert. His
mistake was in taking the costumes back to
Washington. D.C., a decision that would later
give political pundits reason to call him "a
fruit."
For propriety's sake. Hoover Tower was
kept off the campus maps until 1941. when
missiles became cool and the rest of the
country learned to accept phallic symbols. In
the 19905, Stanford Provost Condoleezza
Rice rewrote the history books to claim that
the tower did not even open until 1941 and
that it was a "library." Of course, there's good
reason students aren't allowed in the Hoover
Tower stacks to this day.
