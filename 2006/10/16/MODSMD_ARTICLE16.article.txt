# Smart, cute and unavailable
## 
### 
When I was a junior in high school, I
wrote a column for my school news
paper. "Guys suck," my teenage self
wrote in the Valentine's Day edition of
"Love, Life, and Lisa." "Although this sen
tence should be self-explanatory, approxi
mately half of Paly's population will not un
derstand it, given that they are male."
In a brilliant burst of adolescent oversim
plification, I went on to create four simple.
PG-titled categories into which all males
could be placed: dumb-ugly, smart-ugly,
dumb-cute and smart-cute. As you might
imagine, the line of guys standing outside my
parents' door tripled in size.
Never one to make snap, superficial judg
ments, I quickly dismissed the dumb-cute,
dumb-ugly and smart-ugly groups. Thanks to
my brilliant Darwinian instincts,even my high
school self was too concerned with the future
to date someone who could not hold up his
end of an intelligent conversation. The trou
ble with the one remaining group, I explained,
was that its smart-cute members were always
unavailable in one form or another — if they
weren't gay, then they were, inevitably, in a
rock-solid relationship,or,at the very least,on
the rebound from one (again, wise beyond my
years. 1 already understood the law of physics

that dictates that objects on the rebound have
a tendency to bounce more than once before
returning to equilibrium).
I now find my teenage Carrie Bradshaw
moment mildly amusing, but I also believe I
was onto something a bit more serious: for
better or worse, the column was my attempt
to understand the relationships (and the lack
thereof) in my midst.
And so it is that I present a Stanford-rele
vant update, alongside one disclaimer:
nowhere in this column do I assert that all
males fall into one of the following categories,
nor do I reassert my initial claim that "guys
suck." though the latter is still up for debate.
To a large extent, Stanford's admissions
process does a good job of weeding out the
lower end of the food chain in the "intelli
gence" category. However, as anyone who's
ever scored lower than 1600—I'm sorry.
2400 — on the SAT will tell you, there are
many, many different forms of intelligence
(and no standardized way of accurately as
sessing them without leaving a number of
smart children behind).
At Stanford, we are blessed to be sur
rounded by book-smart people. Trust me, the
real world looks nothing like this. Even the
fuzziest English major (i.e., me) can solve

your average differential calculus problem,
and, assuming "Freakonomics" and The
Economist count, there are lots of well-read
techies hiking through the Quad. Where the
Farm s population falters, however, is in an
other realm of intelligence: the fundamentals
of social interaction.
While waiting for a class to begin yester
day, 1 was privy to the following exchange be
tween two typical Stanford kids.
"Where are you from?" one politely
asked.
"Oh my god." he shook his head emphati
cally "I hate that question." He spoke vehe
mently spitting on her as he continued. "I've
lived all over Europe, okay? 1 mean, like, all
over. I really hate it when people ask me that."

Pearls of wisdom
I'm not sure which universe this individ
ual comes from, but the last time 1 checked,
asking where someone is from is about as
harmless and common as introducing one
self by name.This homeless (and nameless)
individual has an SI. or Social Intelligence,
quotient of zero.
Borrowing from my high school bril
liance. I will assume that second axis on
which we are plotting men — and, to be fair,
women — ranges from mean and arrogant
to nice and down-to-earth. (Obviously,
when I used the words "ugly" and "cute" in
high school. I was referring to personality).
We'll call this the Emotional Intelligence
Quotient, or EQ.
ITius. we have four new categories or, as
proof of my mathematical abilities, quad
rants: low SI low EQ. low Si-high EQ. high
Si-low EQ and high Si-high EQ.
Quadrant one contains low SI-low EQ in
dividuals such as the one from the above ex
change. Seemingly oblivious to the acne scars
and orthodontia that should have made him

humble, he was not only arrogant hut per
ilously unskilled in the social arena. My sug
gestion: put down the video console and
strike up a polite conversation with someone.
Members of the second group are simi
larly lacking in SI. but their kind demeanor
(high EQ) earns major points.To them I say:
Location, location, location. Sweet Hall is
less than five minutes away from the Lane
Reading Room. Choose wisely.
The third and perhaps most dangerous
horde of men is socially capable but well
aware that this makes them fairly valuable
in Stanford's relatively small, land-locked
pond. Many of this group's most notorious,
high Sl-low EQ denizens are also members
of certain all-male organizations, and by
senior year, even those who are not can be
fairly easily identified as the future ibankers
and consultants of Stanford recruiting. Pre
tend all you want, but no one here was that
cool in high school.
The fourth and final illustrious group
seems to have it all.To a certain extent, these
socially capable, genuinely nice individuals
may most exude Stanford's smart and sun
kissed image. Sadly, as in high school, they're
unavailable. Being the picture-perfect peo
ple that they are. some of them have even
managed to maintain a long-distance rela

tionship beyond that first Thanksgiving
break, and thus have been unavailable
SINCE high school. In addition to this
group's old unavailability issues, there is also
a new one: priorities. These are the people
who say, "I'd love to talk/come over/nieet
you at the CoHo, but 1 have a problem
set/program/paper due tomorrow/next
week/next quarter and 1 haven't started yet."
There is nothing wrong with having aca
demic goals; hopefully intellectual curiosi
ty is what brought us all here in the first
place. The problem arises when said goals
take precedence over anything and every
thing else, all of the time. One of the most
amazing and precious assets, if not the most
amazing, precious asset, that Stanford has
to offer is the people on its campus. Just
like those incredible classes and world-fa
mous professors, you owe it to yourself to
make the most of them. Quadrant-jumping
is possible, and the only way to do so is
through new relationships.

Quotient, or EQ.
ITius. we have four new categories or, as
proof of my mathematical abilities, quad
rants: low SI low EQ. low Si-high EQ. high
Si-low EQ and high Si-high EQ.
Quadrant one contains low SI-low EQ in
dividuals such as the one from the above ex
change. Seemingly oblivious to the acne scars
and orthodontia that should have made him

humble, he was not only arrogant hut per
ilously unskilled in the social arena. My sug
gestion: put down the video console and
strike up a polite conversation with someone.
Members of the second group are simi
larly lacking in SI. but their kind demeanor
(high EQ) earns major points.To them I say:
Location, location, location. Sweet Hall is
less than five minutes away from the Lane
Reading Room. Choose wisely.
The third and perhaps most dangerous
horde of men is socially capable but well
aware that this makes them fairly valuable
in Stanford's relatively small, land-locked
pond. Many of this group's most notorious,
high Sl-low EQ denizens are also members
of certain all-male organizations, and by
senior year, even those who are not can be
fairly easily identified as the future ibankers
and consultants of Stanford recruiting. Pre
tend all you want, but no one here was that
cool in high school.
The fourth and final illustrious group
seems to have it all.To a certain extent, these
socially capable, genuinely nice individuals
may most exude Stanford's smart and sun
kissed image. Sadly, as in high school, they're
unavailable. Being the picture-perfect peo
ple that they are. some of them have even
managed to maintain a long-distance rela

tionship beyond that first Thanksgiving
break, and thus have been unavailable
SINCE high school. In addition to this
group's old unavailability issues, there is also
a new one: priorities. These are the people
who say, "I'd love to talk/come over/nieet
you at the CoHo, but 1 have a problem
set/program/paper due tomorrow/next
week/next quarter and 1 haven't started yet."
There is nothing wrong with having aca
demic goals; hopefully intellectual curiosi
ty is what brought us all here in the first
place. The problem arises when said goals
take precedence over anything and every
thing else, all of the time. One of the most
amazing and precious assets, if not the most
amazing, precious asset, that Stanford has
to offer is the people on its campus. Just
like those incredible classes and world-fa
mous professors, you owe it to yourself to
make the most of them. Quadrant-jumping
is possible, and the only way to do so is
through new relationships.

When I was a junior in high school, I
wrote a column for my school news
paper. "Guys suck," my teenage self
wrote in the Valentine's Day edition of
"Love, Life, and Lisa." "Although this sen
tence should be self-explanatory, approxi
mately half of Paly's population will not un
derstand it, given that they are male."
In a brilliant burst of adolescent oversim
plification, I went on to create four simple.
PG-titled categories into which all males
could be placed: dumb-ugly, smart-ugly,
dumb-cute and smart-cute. As you might
imagine, the line of guys standing outside my
parents' door tripled in size.
Never one to make snap, superficial judg
ments, I quickly dismissed the dumb-cute,
dumb-ugly and smart-ugly groups. Thanks to
my brilliant Darwinian instincts,even my high
school self was too concerned with the future
to date someone who could not hold up his
end of an intelligent conversation. The trou
ble with the one remaining group, I explained,
was that its smart-cute members were always
unavailable in one form or another — if they
weren't gay, then they were, inevitably, in a
rock-solid relationship,or,at the very least,on
the rebound from one (again, wise beyond my
years. 1 already understood the law of physics

that dictates that objects on the rebound have
a tendency to bounce more than once before
returning to equilibrium).
I now find my teenage Carrie Bradshaw
moment mildly amusing, but I also believe I
was onto something a bit more serious: for
better or worse, the column was my attempt
to understand the relationships (and the lack
thereof) in my midst.
And so it is that I present a Stanford-rele
vant update, alongside one disclaimer:
nowhere in this column do I assert that all
males fall into one of the following categories,
nor do I reassert my initial claim that "guys
suck." though the latter is still up for debate.
To a large extent, Stanford's admissions
process does a good job of weeding out the
lower end of the food chain in the "intelli
gence" category. However, as anyone who's
ever scored lower than 1600—I'm sorry.
2400 — on the SAT will tell you, there are
many, many different forms of intelligence
(and no standardized way of accurately as
sessing them without leaving a number of
smart children behind).
At Stanford, we are blessed to be sur
rounded by book-smart people. Trust me, the
real world looks nothing like this. Even the
fuzziest English major (i.e., me) can solve

your average differential calculus problem,
and, assuming "Freakonomics" and The
Economist count, there are lots of well-read
techies hiking through the Quad. Where the
Farm s population falters, however, is in an
other realm of intelligence: the fundamentals
of social interaction.
While waiting for a class to begin yester
day, 1 was privy to the following exchange be
tween two typical Stanford kids.
"Where are you from?" one politely
asked.
"Oh my god." he shook his head emphati
cally "I hate that question." He spoke vehe
mently spitting on her as he continued. "I've
lived all over Europe, okay? 1 mean, like, all
over. I really hate it when people ask me that."

I'm not sure which universe this individ
ual comes from, but the last time 1 checked,
asking where someone is from is about as
harmless and common as introducing one
self by name.This homeless (and nameless)
individual has an SI. or Social Intelligence,
quotient of zero.
Borrowing from my high school bril
liance. I will assume that second axis on
which we are plotting men — and, to be fair,
women — ranges from mean and arrogant
to nice and down-to-earth. (Obviously,
when I used the words "ugly" and "cute" in
high school. I was referring to personality).
