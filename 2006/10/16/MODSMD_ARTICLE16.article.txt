# Smart, cute and unavailable
## 
### 
When I was a junior in high school, I
wrote a column for my school news
paper. "Guys suck," my teenage self
wrote in the Valentine's Day edition of
"Love, Life, and Lisa." "Although this sen
tence should be self-explanatory, approxi
mately half of Paly's population will not un
derstand it, given that they are male."
In a brilliant burst of adolescent oversim
plification, I went on to create four simple.
PG-titled categories into which all males
could be placed: dumb-ugly, smart-ugly,
dumb-cute and smart-cute. As you might
imagine, the line of guys standing outside my
parents' door tripled in size.
Never one to make snap, superficial judg
ments, I quickly dismissed the dumb-cute,
dumb-ugly and smart-ugly groups. Thanks to
my brilliant Darwinian instincts,even my high
school self was too concerned with the future
to date someone who could not hold up his
end of an intelligent conversation. The trou
ble with the one remaining group, I explained,
was that its smart-cute members were always
unavailable in one form or another — if they
weren't gay, then they were, inevitably, in a
rock-solid relationship,or,at the very least,on
the rebound from one (again, wise beyond my
years. 1 already understood the law of physics

that dictates that objects on the rebound have
a tendency to bounce more than once before
returning to equilibrium).
I now find my teenage Carrie Bradshaw
moment mildly amusing, but I also believe I
was onto something a bit more serious: for
better or worse, the column was my attempt
to understand the relationships (and the lack
thereof) in my midst.
And so it is that I present a Stanford-rele
vant update, alongside one disclaimer:
nowhere in this column do I assert that all
males fall into one of the following categories,
nor do I reassert my initial claim that "guys
suck." though the latter is still up for debate.
To a large extent, Stanford's admissions
process does a good job of weeding out the
lower end of the food chain in the "intelli
gence" category. However, as anyone who's
ever scored lower than 1600—I'm sorry.
2400 — on the SAT will tell you, there are
many, many different forms of intelligence
(and no standardized way of accurately as
sessing them without leaving a number of
smart children behind).
At Stanford, we are blessed to be sur
rounded by book-smart people. Trust me, the
real world looks nothing like this. Even the
fuzziest English major (i.e., me) can solve

your average differential calculus problem,
and, assuming "Freakonomics" and The
Economist count, there are lots of well-read
techies hiking through the Quad. Where the
Farm s population falters, however, is in an
other realm of intelligence: the fundamentals
of social interaction.
While waiting for a class to begin yester
day, 1 was privy to the following exchange be
tween two typical Stanford kids.
"Where are you from?" one politely
asked.
"Oh my god." he shook his head emphati
cally "I hate that question." He spoke vehe
mently spitting on her as he continued. "I've
lived all over Europe, okay? 1 mean, like, all
over. I really hate it when people ask me that."
