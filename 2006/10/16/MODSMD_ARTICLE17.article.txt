### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
rhere seemed to be only one good piece of
news for the Stanford football team after Satur
day s 20-" 7 loss to Arizona: there is no place to eo
but up.

Arizona 20

The Cardinal surrendered 220 yards on the
ground to the second worst rushing offense in
Division I-A, set a new school record for offen
sive futility and lost their starting quarterback
after just one series, all against the team widely
considered the second-worst in the Pac-10.
The Cardinal (0-7.0-4 Pac-10), led by back
up quarterback T.C. Ostrander for most of the
afternoon, limped to just 52 yards of total of
fense, making for a new single-game low in
Stanford history. The previous worst was 116
yards in a 33-10 loss to Tulane in 1979. The 52-
yard performance was also the fewest yards al
lowed in the Wildcats' Pac-10 history.
"We couldn't get anything going," junior
tailback Anthony Kimble said. "We shot our
selves in the foot on so many drives. We know
T.C. can get the job done. But. we did a terrible
job protecting him and there was a lot of mis
communication."
Ostrander entered the game on Stanford's
second drive of the game after starting quartet -
back Trent Edwards injured his foot while at
tempting to scramble for a first down on the
Cardinal's first offensive series. Edwards' sta
tus for the coming weeks is still up in the air.
pending a revaluation of his x-rays and an
MRI.
"It was kind of funny," Edwards said. "I got
up after being hit from behind and it was kind
of an awkward feeling as 1 was running off the
field. I couldn't really push off it very well and
the doctors took my shoe off and started mov
ing it around. Something didn't feel right, kind
of like a sprain or something."
Ostrander struggled to move the Cardinal
offense in the face of substantial pressure from
the Wildcats' front line. The Atherton native
finished the game 8-of-13 passing for 58 yards
and was sacked six times for -40 yards. 1 le also
fumbled once which led to one of two Arizona
first-quarter touchdowns. Ostrander injured
his knee on Stanford's final offensive play of
the game, but is expected to be ready to play, if
needed, next week against Arizona State.
"We obviously have a lot to work on." Os
trander said. "We made some communication
errors, we need to be a little more physical up
front and I need to get rid of the ball faster. I re
ally need to make my decisions faster and get
the ball out of my hands."
The Cardinal rush offense also floundered
against the stingy Wildcats defense. Stanford's
backs combined for -6 rush yards, the ninth
worst total in school history.
The Wildcats (3-4. 1-3) — behind a backup
quarterback of their own, Adam Austin —
struck for two early touchdowns. Already lead
ing 7-0 with 5:03 left in the first quarter, Ari
zona's Yaniv Barnett recovered the Ostrander
fumble at the Stanford 39-yard line.Three plays
later, running back Chris Henry wove through
the Cardinal defense for an 18-yard
touchdown run.
Henry, who rushed for just 91
yards on 35 attempts entering the
game, matched that total on 16 car
ries on Saturday. Fellow running
backs Chris Jennings and Xavier
Smith added 89 and 56 yards, re
spectively.
"They got great running efforts
from all their guys," senior line
backer Michael Ok wo said. "They
ran the ball harder than any backs
that we have seen all year."
The 220-yard rushing output by
the Wildcats offense blew past their
season average of 54.8 yards per
game. Arizona had not run for pos
itive yardage in its three games
leading up to Saturday's matchup.
"Pretty much all season we've
committed ourselves to the run,"
Arizona Coach Mike Stoops said.
"So that was very pleasing to see, to
control the line of scrimmage and
run the ball when they knew we
were going to run the ball."
Arizona, like Stanford, was
forced to play without its first
string quarterback. Willie Tuitama,
the Wildcats regular under center,
was not in uniform after suffering
his second concussion of the season
last weekend against UCLA.
But Austin also couldn't last the
entire game. In the closing minutes
of the second quarter the Arizona
backup was injured when he was hit
while throwing a deep pass down
the middle. The play ended up pro
viding one of the few bright mo
ments for the Cardinal, when cor
nerback and school record holder
tor the 100-yard dash Wopamo Os
aisai intercepted the errant pass
and returned it 72 yards for Stan
ford's only score of the day.
Third-string quarterback Kris
Heavner finished the game for the
Wildcats, completing all four of his
pass attempts for 11 yards.
Hie Wildcats picked up their
first score of the day on their open
ing drive, marching 63 yards in 4:01
for a touchdown. The drive culmi
nated on a 16 yard run by Jennings.
The loss leaves Stanford in sole
possession of last place in the Pac
-10 and officially ends the Cardinal's
2006 bowl hopes. Stanford will face
the only other Pac-10 team without
a conference win next week, when
it travels to Tempe, Ariz, to play
Arizona State (3-3,0-3).
"You play football to win and
right now. we can't be worrying
about anything other than getting
better," Stanford head coach Walt
Harris said. "I'm confident there
will be better days ahead for us —
hopefully sooner rather than later."
