but up.

Arizona 20

The Cardinal surrendered 220 yards on the
ground to the second worst rushing offense in
Division I-A, set a new school record for offen
sive futility and lost their starting quarterback
after just one series, all against the team widely
considered the second-worst in the Pac-10.
The Cardinal (0-7.0-4 Pac-10), led by back
up quarterback T.C. Ostrander for most of the
afternoon, limped to just 52 yards of total of
fense, making for a new single-game low in
Stanford history. The previous worst was 116
yards in a 33-10 loss to Tulane in 1979. The 52-
yard performance was also the fewest yards al
lowed in the Wildcats' Pac-10 history.
"We couldn't get anything going," junior
tailback Anthony Kimble said. "We shot our
selves in the foot on so many drives. We know
T.C. can get the job done. But. we did a terrible
job protecting him and there was a lot of mis
communication."
Ostrander entered the game on Stanford's
second drive of the game after starting quartet -
back Trent Edwards injured his foot while at
tempting to scramble for a first down on the
Cardinal's first offensive series. Edwards' sta
tus for the coming weeks is still up in the air.
pending a revaluation of his x-rays and an
MRI.
"It was kind of funny," Edwards said. "I got
up after being hit from behind and it was kind
of an awkward feeling as 1 was running off the
field. I couldn't really push off it very well and
the doctors took my shoe off and started mov
ing it around. Something didn't feel right, kind
of like a sprain or something."
Ostrander struggled to move the Cardinal
offense in the face of substantial pressure from
the Wildcats' front line. The Atherton native
finished the game 8-of-13 passing for 58 yards
and was sacked six times for -40 yards. 1 le also
fumbled once which led to one of two Arizona
first-quarter touchdowns. Ostrander injured
his knee on Stanford's final offensive play of
the game, but is expected to be ready to play, if
needed, next week against Arizona State.
"We obviously have a lot to work on." Os
trander said. "We made some communication
errors, we need to be a little more physical up
front and I need to get rid of the ball faster. I re
ally need to make my decisions faster and get
the ball out of my hands."
The Cardinal rush offense also floundered
against the stingy Wildcats defense. Stanford's
backs combined for -6 rush yards, the ninth
worst total in school history.
The Wildcats (3-4. 1-3) — behind a backup
quarterback of their own, Adam Austin —
struck for two early touchdowns. Already lead
ing 7-0 with 5:03 left in the first quarter, Ari
zona's Yaniv Barnett recovered the Ostrander
fumble at the Stanford 39-yard line.Three plays
