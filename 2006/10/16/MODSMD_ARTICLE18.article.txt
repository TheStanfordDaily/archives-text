A fellow junior and friend of mine
emailed me the following column
yesterday. Immediately, 1 scrapped
my story. For as big of a Stanford fan as 1 am,
it's simply not the same watching the game in
a press box in a tie as it is from the bleachers
in body paint.
1 le, and plenty of diehard fans like him.
have suffered through what's shaping up to
be the worst Stanford season in 80 years of
football,and at times like this, I think it's more
important to hear from the fans than ever. I'll
return next week, but without further ado,
here's the voice of a fan:
What happened Saturday afternoon was

an organizational failure. From the guy selling
lemonade in section 136, to the student sec
tion. the players, the coaches, and right up to
the Athletic Director — everyone screwed
up today.
First off, our student section is a joke. What
makes it worse for me is that I come from
ACC country, where college football actually
means something. Maybe my standards are
too high.That said. I don't think it's too much
to ask for Stanford students to come out and
support their team on a Saturday afternoon
(much less for homecoming) and to stay the

length of the game.
As for the players. I know that they train
incredibly hard, with an intensity that is im
possible to capture in words. That said, what
happened Saturday was a display of some ot
the worst fundamental football skills 1 have
seen since the I ( Davis game. Missed tack
les, missed blocks, a panicked quarterback —
the list could go on. We're |iist not translating
our effort into results on Saturday. I believe
that the men on our roster are capable of
more than what we saw this weekend. Our
team has the capacity to generate more than
52 total yards in a game. We need to mix it up
until we find 11 who can get it done on both
sides of the ball.

lint ultimately, any amount of talent is
constrained by the coaching staff s gameplan.
And that's why the lion's share of the blame
lays at the feet of the men with the clipboards.
We weren't even a factor offensively. Neg
ative five rushing yards. Let me write that
again. Negative six rushing yards. Four first
downs. Our 52 (check) yards of offensive out
put was the lowest in school history — by 54
yards! Arizona's six sacks were more than the
Wildcats had earned all season.
And as bad as the offense is. the defense is
worse. We've had a year and a half to try it out,
and the 3-4 isn't working. Perhaps it would
