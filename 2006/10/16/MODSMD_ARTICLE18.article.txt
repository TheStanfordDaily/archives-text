# All wrong now: the voice of a frusturated football fan

A fellow junior and friend of mine
emailed me the following column
yesterday. Immediately, 1 scrapped
my story. For as big of a Stanford fan as 1 am,
it's simply not the same watching the game in
a press box in a tie as it is from the bleachers
in body paint.
1 le, and plenty of diehard fans like him.
have suffered through what's shaping up to
be the worst Stanford season in 80 years of
football,and at times like this, I think it's more
important to hear from the fans than ever. I'll
return next week, but without further ado,
here's the voice of a fan:
What happened Saturday afternoon was

an organizational failure. From the guy selling
lemonade in section 136, to the student sec
tion. the players, the coaches, and right up to
the Athletic Director — everyone screwed
up today.
First off, our student section is a joke. What
makes it worse for me is that I come from
ACC country, where college football actually
means something. Maybe my standards are
too high.That said. I don't think it's too much
to ask for Stanford students to come out and
support their team on a Saturday afternoon
(much less for homecoming) and to stay the

length of the game.
As for the players. I know that they train
incredibly hard, with an intensity that is im
possible to capture in words. That said, what
happened Saturday was a display of some ot
the worst fundamental football skills 1 have
seen since the I ( Davis game. Missed tack
les, missed blocks, a panicked quarterback —
the list could go on. We're |iist not translating
our effort into results on Saturday. I believe
that the men on our roster are capable of
more than what we saw this weekend. Our
team has the capacity to generate more than
52 total yards in a game. We need to mix it up
until we find 11 who can get it done on both
sides of the ball.

lint ultimately, any amount of talent is
constrained by the coaching staff s gameplan.
And that's why the lion's share of the blame
lays at the feet of the men with the clipboards.
We weren't even a factor offensively. Neg
ative five rushing yards. Let me write that
again. Negative six rushing yards. Four first
downs. Our 52 (check) yards of offensive out
put was the lowest in school history — by 54
yards! Arizona's six sacks were more than the
Wildcats had earned all season.
And as bad as the offense is. the defense is
worse. We've had a year and a half to try it out,
and the 3-4 isn't working. Perhaps it would

work with a different personnel pack
age. Maybe in the NFI.. But not here.
Arizona ran three plays against us.
A screen pass, an occasional crossing
pass and then a shotgun draw, usually
up the middle/The Wildcats dared us
to stop their run game, and we failed.
Miserably. Never mind our lack of
fundamental tackling and coverage. A
team that averaged about 55 rush
yards per game rang up 220 on us. If
our coaches cannot adapt to being re
peatedly punched in the mouth, then
we have a serious problem.
It seems that we can't block, run or
defend. So why the continued ultra
conservative play calling? If we're
going to lose, why not go out shooting
with everything in the holster? In the
fourth quarter, when we finally dared
to look downfield. we actually enjoyed
some success. If you can't block any
body. sending your tailbacks up the
middle for a loss of two or letting both
your quarterbacks get killed is a silly
idea. Why not open up the playbook a
bit? The lone creative play we've
called all year (theTD pass from Kim
ble to Lynn at Notre Dame) is our
biggest offensive gain of the season.
What said it all was our punt with
about 90 seconds left and down by 13.
Typically, you let the other team ad

minister the coup de grace. And don't
tell me both our quarterbacks were in
jured — that's why you have a depth
chart.
Am I the only one struck by the
irony as our coaches lead an unpre
pared team to battle in a beautiful
new stadium?
I have heard all the excuses. Too
young. Not athletic enough to com
pete. A ton of injuries.The playcalling
says the same thing, "Hey, we stink.
But it's not my fault. Let's pooch punt
it again." I think that the time for
throwing our players, our classmates
and our friends under the bus is
through.
1 lere's a novel idea. If your starters
are being embarrassed, look down the
bench at some of the guys who are
killing themselves in practice and
would give anything for just one shot
to see what they can do. Giving Chris
Marinelli a stari was a good first step.
1 believe in the young men who put
it all on the line every fall Saturday af
ternoon. When they put on the uni
form, they represent you, me and
everyone at this school. 1 am proud to
call them my team. 1 believe they are
worthy of our support and. ultimately,
that they deserve competent leader
ship. 1 believe that the football pro
gram as it stands today is an embar
rassment the university and that it
needs radical change from the top to
the bottom. Our new AD has a chance
to start charting that new course im
mediately.

Perhaps we will not challenge US(
and Cal for the Pac-10 title. 1 lowever,
even with our current group of play
ers. I categorically reject the results we
have seen thus far.This program ranks
dead last (or very near) in just about
every relevant category in DT foot
ball. We can't fill up a brand-new,
much-shrunken stadium. We have yet
to see our team put forth a solid effort
in all phases of the game, for a full four
quarters. Even so. I still believe that
we can do better on all counts.
I have had my heart broken by this
football team more times than 1 care
to count: USC 2004. UCLA and Notre
Dame 2005, the entire 2006 campaign,
you name it. I've been there and had
my emotions crushed. 1 may not see a
Big Game win during my time at Stan
ford.
But. I'm a loyal college football
fan. No matter how bad it gets, I will
see it through until the end because I
believe that no matter how bad the
team is. you stick with them and you
go down fighting.
However, as a college football fan,
1 am also acutely aware of the tradi
tion and history that make this game
great. Stanford has an abundance of
both. Saturday was a dark day for this
program. We owe it to ourselves as
fans, players, and members of the foot
ball communitv to make it better.
