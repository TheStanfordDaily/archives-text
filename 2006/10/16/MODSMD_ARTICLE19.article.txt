# Inside The Game: Fullback Dive
## 
### 
The Cardinal occasionally run the ball from the fullback position, with the first man behind the quar
terback in the I formation. The fullback takes the handoff and pounds into the line, with the line
making a wedge at the point of attack. The speed of the play can catch the opponent off-guard, partially
due to a playfake after the handoff that resembles a frequently-run play (such as a sweep or tailback iso
lation) that distracts linebackers and safeties. Against a tough Arizona defense, starting fullback Emeka
Nnoli was Stanford's leading rusher on the day.
