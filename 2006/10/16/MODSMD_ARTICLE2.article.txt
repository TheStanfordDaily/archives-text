## Sigma Chi celebrates house revival After almost losing house to Univ. in 2002. Sigma Chi funds rebuilding with alumni donations 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Sigma Chi brothers of all ages gathered at
their house on Lasuen Mall Friday afternoon
to celebrate recently completed renovations, a
happy contrast to the fraternity's situation
four years ago.
In 2002, Sigma Chi was on the verge of los
ing its house to the University. School officials
demanded that the fraternity bring its Row
House up to the standards of the Stanford
Capital Improvement Program, and the Uni
versity offered to make the necessary im
provements in exchange for the deed to the
house. Unlike other fraternities and sororities,
Sigma Chi owned its house outright, and its
members were not about to hand control over
to the University. Aside from the issue of pride,
ownership gave the fraternity perks like being
able to stay in their rooms over winter and
spring break and renting out rooms over the
summer to raise money.
Instead, the fraternity ehose to pay for ren
ovations to the house — built in 1939 — itself.
Over the next few years, the group raised cash
for the construction project, primarily through
alumni donations. At Friday's ceremony, cur
rent brothers thanked the alumni for their
contributions, which included a gift of
$250,000 from 1946 alum Henry Segerstrom.
Stanford booster John Arrillaga, a member of
the class of 1960 and whose son was once pres
ident of the chapter, joined the construction
project last spring.
Construction took place over the summer,
with work crews making final touches and
adding sod during the first days of autumn
quarter. All of the surfaces in the house were
redone with new carpet and paint. Other
changes included landscaping around the bar
becue. the installation of new ceiling fans and
the replacement of carpet with hardwood
floor.
Friday's celebration was a reunion of sorts,
with brothers trading anecdotes and inside
jokes, and alumni marveling at the house's new
appearance.
"It is far better now than when I was here."
said 1966 grad Gary Jacobson. "It was pretty
beat up even in the 19605."
Current brothers expressed appreciation
for the financial support of alumni and singled
out Arrillaga's contributions as crucial to the
project's success.
"His involvement saved us a lot of construc
tion costs," said senior Paul Dreyer. "He of-
fered to do it at a discounted rate and
his company did a phenomenal job
of finishing a huge construction job
in the space of three months. 1 le was
a catalyst for getting this all done."
Along with the new features, the
house now tried to strengthen links
to previous residents. An old tradi
tion sent pledges on a nighttime mis
sion to the foothills to drag a boulder
hack to the house — rocks that are
worked into the backyard landscap

recalled one such evening.
"In the middle of the night we
were up there coming down Campus
Drive with this rock being towed by
2U pledges and the police stopped us
and asked us if we had permission to
be there." he said. "We said we did

and they let us finish. It was a big tra
dition and built unity among the
pledge class."
Still. Chuck Armstrong, a 2004
graduate, said that the current broth
ers will need to make the house their
own.

two vears from now."
