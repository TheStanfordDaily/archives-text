# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Cardinal upset Bruins in five 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
As if beating one previously undefeated team wasn't
enough to make a good weekend, the Stanford women's
volleyball team performed the feat twice and on back to
back nights. After sweeping No. 4 Southern California
on Thursday, the No. 6 Cardinal pulled out a five-game
win over No. 3 UCLA on Friday.
Stanford (15-2, 6-1 Pacific-10 Conference) won the
first game in Pauley Pavilion but then fell behind 2-1.
The Cardinal fought back to force a fifth game and won
it, 15-10. on an ace by senior outside hitter Kristin
Richards.

UCLA (2) 27 30 30 25 10 20-1 (7-1 PAC-10)
With the pair of wins in southern California, Stanford
became the first squad to win on the road against a
ranked team in the top-heavy conference — five Pac-10
teams were in the top seven in last week's national poll.
Coming into the weekend. UCLA. USC", No. 5 Washing
ton, Stanford and No. 7 California all had perfect home
records in 2006.Hie Cardinal changed that.
"It was really big," head coach John Dunning said.
"To go on the road, play two undefeated teams and come
away with two wins is huge. One of the most important
things for us is that we had not gone to five before. But
now we know that we have trained well enough and we
can play long matches and win."
It was only the second time all season that Stanford
played more than three games; the other a four-game

loss to Brigham Young in the preseason. Nevertheless,
the Cardinal stayed with the Bruins (20-1,7-1) point-for
point until the final surge to victory.
Stanford got off to a discouraging start when UCLA's
Rachell Johnson scored the first point, with two aces in
the first three points. The Cardinal trailed by four when
Richards and sophomore middle blocker Foluke Akin
radewo combined for four straight kills to tie the game at
I l.The Cardinal then took the lead for the first time at
14 13 on a kill by sophomore outside hitter Cynthia Bar
boza. UCLA fought back, but Stanford pulled away for
good at 24-23 and closed out the game. 30-27, with a
block by Akinradewo and sophomore light side Erin
Waller."
The Bruins and Cardinal matched each other point
for-point to start the second game before UCLA pulled
ahead 17-13. Stanford fought back to tie at 23 but could
not take the lead. The Bruins won the second game, 30-
27. on a kill by setter Nellie Spicer.
The third game was another battle, and this time Stan
ford pulled into a 12-7 lead. UCLA took advantage of
Cardinal errors and pulled ahead 24-21. forcing a Stan
ford timeout. Hie Cardinal won the first point out of the
break but the Bruins held on for the 30-25 victory.
l aced with a must-win fourth game. Stanford did
what it needed to do with a 30-25 win. Neither team led
by more than one point until the Cardinal edged up 13-
II with Richards' ace making it 15-12 at the halfway
point. An Akinradewo ace made it 20-13. the largest
margin of the match, and IJCLA could not close the gap.
Junior middle blocker I ranci Ciirard notched an ace to
seal the fourth and Stanford went to a fifth game for the
first time in 2006.
"At that point, after you win game four, it is all about
keeping your energy up and letting yourself get excited,"
Dunning said. "Out on the court you use your excite-
ment,so we don't let any point go by without cel
ebrating. You don't just go to the next one; you
celebrate together and build up your energy and
momentum and make the other team work for
everything."
The Cardinal did just that, beating the previ
ously perfect Bruins 15-10 to finish out the match.
UCLA led only once, at 2-1, but Stanford domi
nated from that point forward as they put togeth
er 12 kills on .435 hitting. After junior setter Bryn
Kehoe brought up match point with a dump kill,
Richards' ace finished off the Bruins.

... for the rest of
the season, we
control our own
destiny.

JOHN DUNNING,
Head women's coach
Richards, last week's Pac-10 Player of the
Week, led the way with match highs in kills (21)
and aces (3). Her 26 digs were double that of any
other player on the team.
Barboza had 21 kills as well as two of Stan
ford's season-high 12 aces. Akinradewo chipped
in 18 kills on .457 hitting and notched a match
high seven blocks, two of them solo. Girard had 13
kills, hitting .393, and finished with four blocks.
Kehoe dished out 66 assists — the third highest
total in her career — and also recorded five kills,
12 digs, four blocks and an ace.
Katie Carter paced the Bruins with 19 kills.
Nana Meriwether — who came in hitting a na
tion-leading .509 on the season — had 17 kills but
hit only .278. Meriwether led UCLA with five
blocks and libero Jordan Smith tallied 20 digs.
"They are a very good team," Dunning said.
"We knew that Nana was going to do some dam
age, but we didn't know about their outside hit
ters. ITiey changed a lot, but they all played very
well."
The teams were so well matched that the Car
dinal only outscored the Bruins by five points in
the match, the winning margin of the fifth game in
the 30-27,27-30,30-25,25-30,15-10 match.
ITie pair of huge wins should move the Cardi
nal up in the national rankings when they are
published Monday afternoon. It should also put
Stanford in good shape in the second half of con
ference play where hey have only one more road
game against a ranked opponent left to play.
" This [past] weekend puts us in the position
where, for the rest of the season, we control our
own destiny," Dunning said."Our success is in our
own hands and that is exactly what we wanted."
