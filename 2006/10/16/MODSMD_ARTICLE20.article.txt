### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
As if beating one previously undefeated team wasn't
enough to make a good weekend, the Stanford women's
volleyball team performed the feat twice and on back to
back nights. After sweeping No. 4 Southern California
on Thursday, the No. 6 Cardinal pulled out a five-game
win over No. 3 UCLA on Friday.
Stanford (15-2, 6-1 Pacific-10 Conference) won the
first game in Pauley Pavilion but then fell behind 2-1.
The Cardinal fought back to force a fifth game and won
it, 15-10. on an ace by senior outside hitter Kristin
Richards.

With the pair of wins in southern California, Stanford
became the first squad to win on the road against a
ranked team in the top-heavy conference â€” five Pac-10
teams were in the top seven in last week's national poll.
Coming into the weekend. UCLA. USC", No. 5 Washing
ton, Stanford and No. 7 California all had perfect home
records in 2006.Hie Cardinal changed that.
"It was really big," head coach John Dunning said.
"To go on the road, play two undefeated teams and come
away with two wins is huge. One of the most important
things for us is that we had not gone to five before. But
now we know that we have trained well enough and we
can play long matches and win."
It was only the second time all season that Stanford
played more than three games; the other a four-game

loss to Brigham Young in the preseason. Nevertheless,
the Cardinal stayed with the Bruins (20-1,7-1) point-for
point until the final surge to victory.
Stanford got off to a discouraging start when UCLA's
Rachell Johnson scored the first point, with two aces in
the first three points. The Cardinal trailed by four when
Richards and sophomore middle blocker Foluke Akin

not take the lead. The Bruins won the second game, 30-

what it needed to do with a 30-25 win. Neither team led
by more than one point until the Cardinal edged up 13-

point. An Akinradewo ace made it 20-13. the largest
margin of the match, and IJCLA could not close the gap.
Junior middle blocker I ranci Ciirard notched an ace to
seal the fourth and Stanford went to a fifth game for the
first time in 2006.
"At that point, after you win game four, it is all about
keeping your energy up and letting yourself get excited,"
Dunning said. "Out on the court you use your excite-
