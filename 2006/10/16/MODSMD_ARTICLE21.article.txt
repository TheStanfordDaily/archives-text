ish with wins against Pepperdine and Pacific.
I "he No. 5 Cardinal defeated the Waves, 7-3, in the first game on
Sunday. Senior drive and captain Tyler Drake and freshman Drac

3) met in a second round game.The Bruins had already defeated the
Cardinal two times this year, by scores of 7-6 and 10-8.

second half, each team scored only once, as UCLA — playing with
a lead — dominated the pace of the game.

pace the Bruins, and senior Brad Greiner added two. For Stanford,
Drake and freshman Janson Wigo each recorded two goals. Sopho
more driver Andrew Drake scored once, his second goal in the two
