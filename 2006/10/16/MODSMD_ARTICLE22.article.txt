Stanford men's golf keeps putting its way through the pre
season and heads to La Quinta, Calif, today, to face off with 14
other top teams in the nation — among the most notable, Cal
ifornia. Southern California and UCLA.
First-year head coach Ray Conrad is off to a good year with
first- and second-place finishes thus far. In Wayzata. Minneso
ta at their first tournament of the season, the Cardinal posted
a three-round total of 889 to win the Gopher Invitational title
over Minnesota and Southern Methodist
Senior Zack Miller tied for first place individually with
SMU's Colt Knost. both shooting 2-under-par 214. Freshman
Joseph Bramlett and junior Rob Grube did their part in the
Cardinal's team victory as they tied for 11th with nine-over
par 225. Rounding out the victory, junior Daniel Lim tied for
19th and freshman Jordan Cox tied for 26th overall.
After a great finish at the Gopher Invitational, the Cardi
nal traveled to Olympia Fields, Illinois to compete in the Illini
Invitational. Duke University edged out the Stanford team
for the win by six strokes (864). Grube finished on top for the
Cardinal with a tie at 1 1th place (217). Cox, Lim and Miller
finished one stroke behind Grube, tying for 13th. Bramlett
also helped out the team by coming in 24th.
With seven of nine players returning, the Cardinal have
high hopes for this season.Three seniors lead this year's team
Miller. Matt Savage and Matt Shin. Miller will captain the
team, with nine par and five under-par rounds under his belt
last year. He had two top 10 finishes and four top 25 finishes
with a 73.0 stroke average.
Savage finished in the top-25 twice, lie had three par and
three under-par rounds last year, turning in a 74.3 stroke aver
age. Shin competed in three Cardinal Golf events last year and
shot a personal-lowest round of 70 strokes with a 75.5 stroke
average for the season.
Hie two returning juniors are Teddy Collins and Grube.
Collins sat out last year as a redshirt but hopes to come back
for a strong season. Grube. last year's Pac-10 Co-Player of the
Year and clearly an asset to the team, won two tournament in-
dividual titles — The US Intercol
legiate and the Western Intercolle
giate. He had eight top-10 finishes,
with a team-low 71.2 stroke aver
age. He had 14 under-par rounds
and eight par rounds last season.
I"he last returning players for
the Cardinal are sophomores

had five under-par and six par
rounds and turned in a 74.3 stroke
average. He also posted a 10th
place finish at the Pac-10 Champi
onships. Lim had one top 10 finish,
a tie for eighth at the Western Inter
collegiate. He recorded two under
par and three par rounds last sea
son.
The two rookies of the team,
Bramlett and Cox hope to add
some fresh talent to the Cardinal
team this year. Bramlett, a Sarato
ga. Calif. native, graduated last year
from St. Francis High School as a
four-year letter winner in golf. At
14 years old, he was the youngest
player ever to qualify for the U.S.
Amateur in 2002. He worked hard
in 2002, becoming a U.S. Open
Local qualifier and a member of the
U.S. World Junior Golf Cup team.
In his high school career, he was the
2005 San Jose Sports Authority's
High School Athlete of the Year
and broke a 2006 WCAL League
Championship record with a low
score of 62.
Cox, a Redwood Shores. Calif,
native, is also a very experienced
freshman. A four-year letter winner
and captain of his golf team at Ju
nipero Serra High School in San
Mateo, Cox holds the record for
lowest WCAL scoring average and
was the runner up in the 2003
USGA Junior Amateur Champi
