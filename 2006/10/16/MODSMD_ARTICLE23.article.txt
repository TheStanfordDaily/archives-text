# Northeast Asia by the numbers
## 
### 
J ust over a week ago, a seismic tremor
with a magnitude of an approximately
4.2 rumbled through Northeast Asia, re
vealing that North Korea has become the
world's eighth nuclear power. U.S. intelli
gence experts estimated that the under
ground explosion's yield was less than a sin
gle kiloton (whereas the bomb that de
stroyed Hiroshima yielded more than 10
kilotons). Yet the event was still enough to
consume the schedules of top diplomats
from the five nations that have been trying
to negotiate through this proliferation crisis
for the past few years. What has been at
stake this week is summed up by a tale of
two constitutions — one well within the
media spotlight, the other hardly men
tioned. 1 am speaking of Chapter 7 of the
United Nations Charter and Article 9 of the
Japanese Constitution.
I"he controversy over Chapter 7 of the
UN Charter, which allows for military ac
tion to enforce a Security Council resolution
in case of a North Korean violation, has
been out in front. While the United States
has argued that the threat of military action
is a key credibility-giver to the resolution,
China and Russia have considerable reser
vations about such a commitment. Ulti
mately. this disagreement revolves around
certain lessons China and Russia have taken
from Iraq — namely.that the U.S. is not om
nipotent. It may,in fact.mishandle a military
operation and it may not have the commit
ment to fully rebuild the resulting mess.
On the other hand, the gray eminence of
George Schultz offered some justification of
the American approach this weekend at
Maples Pavilion. There is no such thing as
diplomacy without credible consequences,
he argued: "in the Marines, they taught me
that my rifle was my best friend, but never to
point unless I was willing to shoot.' The U.S.
diplomats responsible for the negotiations in
Northeast Asia seem to make the same argu
ment. Compelling though this logic may be. I
would argue against the American prefer
ence in this case, for the following reason.
North Korea is very good at provoking
crises. It is a "rogue," unpredictable state, hut
its upstart foreign policy relies very much on
the predictable behavior of the five nations

that hedge it in. To invoke Chapter 7 would
be to declare our preparations to the Kim
regime. In this scenario, the North could ei
ther call our bluff or escalate the military sit
uation. thereby provoking a bloody conflict
on the peninsula that would be tailored to Py -
ongyang's terms and intentions. Our pre
dictability in this regard would provide Kim
with an opportunity for reaction.Thus, by the
same logic that a definite timetable is unde
sirable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from
Iraq, it was correct for the United States to
compromise with the Chinese and Russians
by removing the references to Chapter 7.
'ITie more intractable question is Article 9
of the Japanese Constitution, which reads,
"The right of belligerency of the state will not
be recognized." The question of this "pacifist
clause" requires some historical background.
Arming Japan is part of a debate that is sev
eral decades old. Article 9 is the product of an
evolving argument about the military role of
Japan in the region.'lTiis is clear when Article
9 is compared with the directives of Douglas
Mac Arthur. who served in effect as Japan's
military dictator in the immediate aftermath
of World War II and who inspired the so
called "pacifist" element of the constitution.
Mac Arthur insisted that Japan renounce war
"even for preserving its own security" and
that "no Japanese Army, Navy or Air Force
will ever be authorized." Some months later,
the actual constitution tweaked this so that a
military could be maintained for self-defense,
but not aggression.
Even the supposedly iron fist of
Mac Arthur. could not prevent the new
Japanese state from maintaining some sort of
military institution. In this light.it is clear that
debate over the remilitarization of Japan
stems from the drafting of the 1947 Constitu
tion. 'ITie process of making Japan a "normal

country" —of revising Article 9 — is a
drawn-out event taking place over the long
term, and it would be foolish to rashly hasten
it in order to punish China or North Korea,or
make an example of Pyongyang for the sake
of Tehran. The dangers and complexities of
the current geopolitical scene should not
overly distract us from the principal issue at
play, the remilitarization of Northeast Asia.
This region is among the most economi
cally important in the world. It was also the
stage, almost a century ago, for brutal Japan
ese imperialism that remains a source of
powerful resentment among today's Chi
nese and Koreans. To quote Theodore Mc-
Nelly, "today two of the leading questions in
Japanese politics are how much Japan
should rearm and whether rearmament re
quires a change in the Constitution." Inter
estingly, this diagnosis was not offered to de
scribe the current crisis. It was written in
1952, shortly before the end of the war that
divided the two Koreas in the first place.
Although these questions return today,
their answers should be the same.The eventu
al abrogation of Article 9 and the develop
ment of Japan into a normal country are most
certainly inevitable. But this time of high ten
sions, strained coalitions and broken trust is
unquestionably not the hour for rearmament.
The same holds all the more so for the idea
of nuclearizing Japan. At this point, the Unit
ed States can make no principled argument
that proliferation is unacceptable for ene
mies but desired among friends.This years
American nuclear policy developments vis
a-vis India and Pakistan reflect the moral in
eoherency of our diplomacy. We cannot con
demn with one hand what we promote with
the other, and the Great Powers cannot en
force what they cannot justify. The United
States and all other nuclear-armed countries
must make a comprehensive effort to explain
why they should be the sole guardians of this
unholy fire. If the case cannot be made, we

nations, intend to dispossess it.

stake this week is summed up by a tale of
two constitutions — one well within the
media spotlight, the other hardly men
tioned. 1 am speaking of Chapter 7 of the
United Nations Charter and Article 9 of the
Japanese Constitution.
I"he controversy over Chapter 7 of the
UN Charter, which allows for military ac
tion to enforce a Security Council resolution
in case of a North Korean violation, has
been out in front. While the United States
has argued that the threat of military action
is a key credibility-giver to the resolution,
China and Russia have considerable reser
vations about such a commitment. Ulti
mately. this disagreement revolves around
certain lessons China and Russia have taken
from Iraq — namely.that the U.S. is not om
nipotent. It may,in fact.mishandle a military
operation and it may not have the commit
ment to fully rebuild the resulting mess.
On the other hand, the gray eminence of
George Schultz offered some justification of
the American approach this weekend at
Maples Pavilion. There is no such thing as
diplomacy without credible consequences,
he argued: "in the Marines, they taught me
that my rifle was my best friend, but never to
point unless I was willing to shoot.' The U.S.
diplomats responsible for the negotiations in
Northeast Asia seem to make the same argu
ment. Compelling though this logic may be. I
would argue against the American prefer
ence in this case, for the following reason.
North Korea is very good at provoking
crises. It is a "rogue," unpredictable state, hut
its upstart foreign policy relies very much on
the predictable behavior of the five nations

that hedge it in. To invoke Chapter 7 would
be to declare our preparations to the Kim
regime. In this scenario, the North could ei
ther call our bluff or escalate the military sit
uation. thereby provoking a bloody conflict
on the peninsula that would be tailored to Py -
ongyang's terms and intentions. Our pre
dictability in this regard would provide Kim
with an opportunity for reaction.Thus, by the
same logic that a definite timetable is unde
sirable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from
Iraq, it was correct for the United States to
compromise with the Chinese and Russians
by removing the references to Chapter 7.
'ITie more intractable question is Article 9
of the Japanese Constitution, which reads,
"The right of belligerency of the state will not
be recognized." The question of this "pacifist
clause" requires some historical background.
Arming Japan is part of a debate that is sev
eral decades old. Article 9 is the product of an
evolving argument about the military role of
Japan in the region.'lTiis is clear when Article
9 is compared with the directives of Douglas
Mac Arthur. who served in effect as Japan's
military dictator in the immediate aftermath
of World War II and who inspired the so
called "pacifist" element of the constitution.
Mac Arthur insisted that Japan renounce war
"even for preserving its own security" and
that "no Japanese Army, Navy or Air Force
will ever be authorized." Some months later,
the actual constitution tweaked this so that a
military could be maintained for self-defense,
but not aggression.
Even the supposedly iron fist of
Mac Arthur. could not prevent the new
Japanese state from maintaining some sort of
military institution. In this light.it is clear that
debate over the remilitarization of Japan
stems from the drafting of the 1947 Constitu
tion. 'ITie process of making Japan a "normal

country" —of revising Article 9 — is a
drawn-out event taking place over the long
term, and it would be foolish to rashly hasten
it in order to punish China or North Korea,or
make an example of Pyongyang for the sake
of Tehran. The dangers and complexities of
the current geopolitical scene should not
overly distract us from the principal issue at
play, the remilitarization of Northeast Asia.
This region is among the most economi
cally important in the world. It was also the
stage, almost a century ago, for brutal Japan
ese imperialism that remains a source of
powerful resentment among today's Chi
nese and Koreans. To quote Theodore Mc-
Nelly, "today two of the leading questions in
Japanese politics are how much Japan
should rearm and whether rearmament re
quires a change in the Constitution." Inter
estingly, this diagnosis was not offered to de
scribe the current crisis. It was written in
1952, shortly before the end of the war that
divided the two Koreas in the first place.
Although these questions return today,
their answers should be the same.The eventu
al abrogation of Article 9 and the develop
ment of Japan into a normal country are most
certainly inevitable. But this time of high ten
sions, strained coalitions and broken trust is
unquestionably not the hour for rearmament.
The same holds all the more so for the idea
of nuclearizing Japan. At this point, the Unit
ed States can make no principled argument
that proliferation is unacceptable for ene
mies but desired among friends.This years
American nuclear policy developments vis
a-vis India and Pakistan reflect the moral in
eoherency of our diplomacy. We cannot con
demn with one hand what we promote with
the other, and the Great Powers cannot en
force what they cannot justify. The United
States and all other nuclear-armed countries
must make a comprehensive effort to explain
why they should be the sole guardians of this
unholy fire. If the case cannot be made, we
must make it clear that we. the nuclear-armed
nations, intend to dispossess it.

J ust over a week ago, a seismic tremor
with a magnitude of an approximately
4.2 rumbled through Northeast Asia, re
vealing that North Korea has become the
world's eighth nuclear power. U.S. intelli
gence experts estimated that the under
ground explosion's yield was less than a sin
gle kiloton (whereas the bomb that de
stroyed Hiroshima yielded more than 10
kilotons). Yet the event was still enough to
consume the schedules of top diplomats
from the five nations that have been trying
to negotiate through this proliferation crisis
for the past few years. What has been at
stake this week is summed up by a tale of
two constitutions — one well within the
