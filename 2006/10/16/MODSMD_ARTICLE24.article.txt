# The 						column my roommate begged me to write
## 
### 
Before I get into exactly how my room
mate and I ended up swimming naked
with a bunch of other ladies, I should
say that my mom thought 1 was too much of
a prude to do it.
Yes. My mom.
You see, my mom wasn't born in a good.
God-fearing country like America. My mom
is from Finland, which is crazy and Euro
pean and has socialized healthcare, like the
Communists. You could say I'm from Fin
land too, but after having spent most of my
life in Alabama. I've picked up some disgust
ingly American values. Like wearing cloth
ing.
It's not the first time our cultural and gen
erational differences have surfaced, to put it
in an I-Hum way. There was also the time
when I was 14, and my mom told me. with
understanding in her eyes, that she would
buy me dirty magazines if I wanted any. To
her credit, her liberalism extends to sub
stances that are legal at 18 in Europe and 21
in the United States, so it's not all bad. But
now, at 19. we're having another misunder
standing centered around the fact that I'm a
Puritan for not wanting to get naked with
strangers.
"I don't see why it's such a big deal." my
mom said. "When I was in banking, all the
women took saunas together. The only girl
who didn't was one who probably had breast
implants and didn't want anyone to know,
which just goes to show that anyone who
doesn't go into the sauna naked has some
thing to hide."
This is brilliant logic, except that everyone
has something to hide — their naked bodies.
But I had to do it (somewhere out there,
my mom is snorting in righteous indignation
about my word choice), because my triend
and roommate Meghan was visiting me in
the great city of Helsinki. And if you're in
Europe, you pretty much have to do brave
European things while laughing obnoxiously
like ugly Americans. So we had already eaten
fried fish heads, gone for a heart attack in
ducing swim above the Arctic Circle and vis
ited the requisite Ice Bar. But 1 guess we
wanted to kick it up a notch, and my mom
thought it was absolutely ridiculous that we
might turn down a sauna just because the
other people in there wouldn't be wearing
any clothing.
In a development that was widely consid
ered a bad move, the bath house had allowed
swimming suits in the pool since 1999, but
there's no question of clothing in the sauna.
This was a prospect that Meghan and 1 found
frightening and embarrassing, to say the
least, which was beyond my mom's wildest
imagination.
"You girls." she scolded. "It's just other

women. And it's only two in the afternoon, so
you'll be the youngest ones there and you'll
get a preview of what your bodies are going
to look like in 50 years!"
1 think she considered that a bonus.
Anyway, the Roman Baths were surpris
ingly low key. I'm not sure what I expected
(Triple XXX's? Sordid neon?), but it was
just a nondescript brick building. The re
ceptionists were all respectably clothed and
not very impressed by our immense brav
ery, just handing out sterile hospital booties
as though people got naked every damn
day.
And inside... There were changing stalls.
There was a pool. There was some nice dec
orative tiling. And yeah, there were a bunch
of very naked, very old women.
We weren't going to do it. We would just
swim with our swimming suits on. like decent
people.
But then 1 looked over to the pool and
saw a rotund lady, well into her Golden
Years, moving from one swim lane to anoth
er by flopping her body over the barrier with
all the grace of a beached whale.
And I thought to myself, "She's not
ashamed of her body, or of appearing like an
aquatic mammal to any sniggering teenagers
who might be watching from above."
Meghan and 1 looked at each other, and
with one mind, we knew we were going to do
it. We were going into the pool sans pants.
I'll leave it to the readership to imagine
(or not) our naked exploits, but I should say
that there's something very refreshing about
the Finnish attitude towards nudity. Not to
get all "Love your Body" about it, but it was
kind of uplifting to see women with far from
"perfect" bodies, both young and middle
aged. being completely comfortable in their
own skin.
Plus. 1 finally proved to my mom. who is
all for the sauna but draws the line at naked
swimming, that I was more daring than she
was.
And that, my friends, is priceless. Price
less.

Sinis prudish American friend Meghan also
had a lot of fun, and Sini will tell you all about
Meghan's naked dance if you email her at

mom said. "When I was in banking, all the
women took saunas together. The only girl
who didn't was one who probably had breast
implants and didn't want anyone to know,
which just goes to show that anyone who
doesn't go into the sauna naked has some
thing to hide."
This is brilliant logic, except that everyone
has something to hide — their naked bodies.
But I had to do it (somewhere out there,
my mom is snorting in righteous indignation
about my word choice), because my triend
and roommate Meghan was visiting me in
the great city of Helsinki. And if you're in
Europe, you pretty much have to do brave
European things while laughing obnoxiously
like ugly Americans. So we had already eaten
fried fish heads, gone for a heart attack in
ducing swim above the Arctic Circle and vis
ited the requisite Ice Bar. But 1 guess we
wanted to kick it up a notch, and my mom
thought it was absolutely ridiculous that we
might turn down a sauna just because the
other people in there wouldn't be wearing
any clothing.
In a development that was widely consid
ered a bad move, the bath house had allowed
swimming suits in the pool since 1999, but
there's no question of clothing in the sauna.
This was a prospect that Meghan and 1 found
frightening and embarrassing, to say the
least, which was beyond my mom's wildest
imagination.
"You girls." she scolded. "It's just other

women. And it's only two in the afternoon, so
you'll be the youngest ones there and you'll
get a preview of what your bodies are going
to look like in 50 years!"
1 think she considered that a bonus.
Anyway, the Roman Baths were surpris
ingly low key. I'm not sure what I expected
(Triple XXX's? Sordid neon?), but it was
just a nondescript brick building. The re
ceptionists were all respectably clothed and
not very impressed by our immense brav
ery, just handing out sterile hospital booties
as though people got naked every damn
day.
And inside... There were changing stalls.
There was a pool. There was some nice dec
orative tiling. And yeah, there were a bunch
of very naked, very old women.
We weren't going to do it. We would just
swim with our swimming suits on. like decent
people.
But then 1 looked over to the pool and
saw a rotund lady, well into her Golden
Years, moving from one swim lane to anoth
er by flopping her body over the barrier with
all the grace of a beached whale.
And I thought to myself, "She's not
ashamed of her body, or of appearing like an
aquatic mammal to any sniggering teenagers
who might be watching from above."
Meghan and 1 looked at each other, and
with one mind, we knew we were going to do
it. We were going into the pool sans pants.
I'll leave it to the readership to imagine
(or not) our naked exploits, but I should say
that there's something very refreshing about
the Finnish attitude towards nudity. Not to
get all "Love your Body" about it, but it was
kind of uplifting to see women with far from
"perfect" bodies, both young and middle
aged. being completely comfortable in their
own skin.
Plus. 1 finally proved to my mom. who is
all for the sauna but draws the line at naked
swimming, that I was more daring than she
was.
And that, my friends, is priceless. Price
less.

Sinis prudish American friend Meghan also
had a lot of fun, and Sini will tell you all about
Meghan's naked dance if you email her at
