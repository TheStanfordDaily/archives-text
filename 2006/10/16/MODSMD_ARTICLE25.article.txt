Regardless of what Dean Powers told
you, the reason why those of us who use the
Arcade — and the many other pedestrian
areas of campus — are relieved with the
ban is because all of us have several times in
our Stanford careers been bumped, bopped,
bowled over or downright clobbered by
speeding bicyclists who are lost in thought
and not paying the least bit of attention to
what they're doing at 25 mph. 1 dodge
dozens of thoughtless bicyclists a day.
Frankly, I'm sick of it. If you guys can't ride
safely and share the way with pedestrians
and motor vehicles, then get off and walk. I
think before ANYONE gets on a bike, they
should be required to pass a test and get a li
cense. And I think that the Stanford Sheriff
and the Police Department should be atten
tive to the hazards that bicyclists pose on the
Stanford campus and handle the droves of
terrible bicycle operators here the same as
they handle poor automobile operators —
that is, by issuing tickets with fines and sus
pending privileges for repeat offenders.

Jim correctly states that there is a danger
posed by reckless biking. Jim also cites the
appropriate sanctions for recklessness —
citations, fines, or revocation of biking priv
ileges on Stanford campus. In the real world
beyond Stanford, there is a danger of reck
less driving (and biking), and we meet that
risk via such sanctions; these sanctions
should work on Stanford as well. The ad
ministration will then say that they lack
manpower to enforce a standard of due care
on the part of bikers, but this excuse has no
merit: Stanford has already stationed police

on the quad to enforce the ban — why can't
these same police attack the real root of the
problem, i.e., recklessness? Prohibition
should never be the first step. Live free or
die.

So. first, let me just say, what is the bike
ban? Would someone mind informing the
graduate students? And what are the ar
cades of the Quad? You know, there are
more graduate students than undergrade
and we are totally left out of ANY decision
on this campus that affects us. On the topic
of bikers...! am one. I bike every day from
my apartment. Some of us don't have the
luxury of walking 20-30 minutes to get to
lab, as we don't have time to sleep, much less
walk everywhere. I agree there is a the prob
lem with bikes...just today the bikes were
parked solid across the steps in front of
math corner of the Quad, and I couldn't
take the stairs without moving the bikes. A
lot of people weave erratically, bike on side
walks, cut off pedestrian and other bikers
and in general buses do illegal and danger
ous things. The problem cannot be fixed by
a ban in a particular location. Bikers need to
be educated and taught how to bike respect
fully and correctly.

I agree completely with what Jim Collins
said in his comment. I am completely sick of
yielding to bicyclists while I walk and com
pletely sick of bicyclists that think they have
some kind of God-given right to ride with
their bikes over every surface, and over
every pedestrian that they find on their way.
1 applaud the bike ban and urge the Stan
ford administration to impose significant
cash fines to bicyclists who break the rules.

Dear Mr. Franich. first of all,"if even one
person with accessibility problems has
more accessibility now, isn't that enough?"
is not only an argument, it's a valid one. If
you can't see this, try rolling around campus

in a chair for a day, or better yet. try sitting
in a dark room for five minutes and think
ing about someone other than yourself. 1
know it's hard. Secondly, your use of false
analogies is astounding! "If even one per
son bikes across grass and trips over un
steady ground, will we have security moni
toring all the grass?" Yes, this is exactly the
same argument, except for the small fact
that the people parking and riding their
bikes in the arcades weren't inconvenienc
ing and injuring themselves, they were in
conveniencing and injuring OTHERS. It's a
fine line. Again.The Daily does itself proud
with this piece.

Question to Wow. your response as to
"thinking about someone besides yourself"
goes too far and misses the point. If 100 stu
dents all want to ride their bikes through the
Quad, and one person with accessibility
problems demands a ban (an extreme meas
ure that should be justified), it is that one
person who is submitting the 100 to her will
— this may be justified, but then again, it
may not be. As I understand it, this is essen
tially the case here — we have a minority
submitting the majority to their will. If the
inconvenience to the majority is slight, other
methods have tried and failed, and the in
convenience to the minority is substantial
— then when we weigh these factors against
one another, we come to the conclusion that
a ban is the only course. If, for instance, there
is a middle ground that can both make the
lives of people with accessibility problems
easier and respect student autonomy (and
student decision-making), then perhaps
that is the course the Administration should
take.

Mr. Shingles: Of course it's justified. First
of all this isn't an "extreme" measure, learn
to walk an extra 40 feet to get to class. Sec
ondly. if just one person with accessibility
problems was blocked from getting access
to somewhere they needed to go, not incon

venienced, but BLOCKED (often times I
had a hard time getting to the newspaper
stand in the arcades and I have no accessi
bility issues...it would have been impossible
for someone in a wheelchair to do it), then
their request to keep 100 people, or howev
er many there are, from parking their bikes
there is far from unreasonable. Unreason
able would have been requesting that no bi
cycle riding be allowed anywhere on cam
pus.

Come on, everyone has been in a bike
accident or knows some one that has. How
about that for a statistic. Ride your bike to
the outside of the Quad, park outside of it.
It probably takes two to three minutes at
most to go from one end to the other. If it
takes longer, then change your schedule.
Improving the lives of the disenfranchised,
going out of your way to help your fellow
man — yeah it's worth it. You can't accuse
Stanford of being a corporation if you your
self don't care about the handicapped. It
hurts a lot less when someone bumps into
you versus when someone crashes into you
with their bike catapulting you to the
ground.

Response to Worst article ever, to be pre
cise, the students in this situation are the dis
enfranchised, as they had no say in the mat
ter. Also, to be precise, the "fellow man"
being helped in this situation appears to be
Messrs. Collins and Pancorbo, not Tommy
whose legs were shot off in the war.

I've been walking, biking and driving on
campus for 13 years, and quite frankly,
EVERYONE needs to be more consider
ate. Pedestrians walk all over the road,cross
whenever and wherever they feel like it
without looking and want to blame bikes
for almost knocking them over. Bikers do
run stop signs and don't signal. Cars do
rolling stops, don't signal and don't yield

right of way. (I know — I get almost run
over about two to three times a year.)
Everyone needs to start paying attention.
As for solutions, what the administration
really needs to do is provide better alterna
tives for parking bikes. There isn't enough
convenient bike parking around the Quad,
which is what causes people to park on the
arcades. They solved one problem without
thinking about how to deal with the effects
of their solution.

"Everyone." "Often." "Most." "Almost."
"Sometimes." If I've learned anything in my
three years and three weeks at Stanford, it's
that you simply cannot get away with these
words without at least some semblance of
due diligence. My main concern as a student
at a top research university lies with the lack
of evidence released by the panel that al
legedly spent a considerable amount of ef
fort studying the bike problem. It seems to
me that the administration has adopted a
stance of "we know what's best for you,"
which certainly does not sit well with a cam
pus full of mature, intelligent adults. From
what 1 gather, there has not been a legiti
mate, scientific study on the effects of biking
in the Quad. How such a decision was made
without hard evidence to back it up is com
pletely beyond me. What really ticks me off
about Stanford's stance is not so much the
ban itself, but that the policy is based on
hearsay and conjecture. And to everyone
who has taken the university's side: While
your near-accident anecdotes and support
for accessibility are not to be ignored, it
should be noted that not a single person af
fected by such accessibility issues has
weighed in with their opinion. I'd like to
hear from those people this policy is benefit

I agree completely with what Jim Collins
said in his comment. I am completely sick of
yielding to bicyclists while I walk and com
pletely sick of bicyclists that think they have
some kind of God-given right to ride with
their bikes over every surface, and over
every pedestrian that they find on their way.

Dear Mr. Franich. first of all,"if even one
person with accessibility problems has
more accessibility now, isn't that enough?"
is not only an argument, it's a valid one. If
you can't see this, try rolling around campus

in a chair for a day, or better yet. try sitting
in a dark room for five minutes and think
ing about someone other than yourself. 1
know it's hard. Secondly, your use of false
analogies is astounding! "If even one per
son bikes across grass and trips over un
steady ground, will we have security moni
toring all the grass?" Yes, this is exactly the
same argument, except for the small fact
that the people parking and riding their
bikes in the arcades weren't inconvenienc
ing and injuring themselves, they were in
conveniencing and injuring OTHERS. It's a
fine line. Again.The Daily does itself proud

Question to Wow. your response as to
"thinking about someone besides yourself"
goes too far and misses the point. If 100 stu
dents all want to ride their bikes through the
Quad, and one person with accessibility
problems demands a ban (an extreme meas
ure that should be justified), it is that one
person who is submitting the 100 to her will
— this may be justified, but then again, it
may not be. As I understand it, this is essen
tially the case here — we have a minority
submitting the majority to their will. If the
inconvenience to the majority is slight, other
methods have tried and failed, and the in
convenience to the minority is substantial
— then when we weigh these factors against
one another, we come to the conclusion that
a ban is the only course. If, for instance, there
is a middle ground that can both make the
lives of people with accessibility problems
easier and respect student autonomy (and
student decision-making), then perhaps
that is the course the Administration should
take.

Mr. Shingles: Of course it's justified. First
of all this isn't an "extreme" measure, learn
to walk an extra 40 feet to get to class. Sec
ondly. if just one person with accessibility
problems was blocked from getting access
to somewhere they needed to go, not incon

venienced, but BLOCKED (often times I
had a hard time getting to the newspaper
stand in the arcades and I have no accessi
bility issues...it would have been impossible
for someone in a wheelchair to do it), then
their request to keep 100 people, or howev
er many there are, from parking their bikes
there is far from unreasonable. Unreason
able would have been requesting that no bi
cycle riding be allowed anywhere on cam
pus.

Come on, everyone has been in a bike
accident or knows some one that has. How
about that for a statistic. Ride your bike to
the outside of the Quad, park outside of it.
It probably takes two to three minutes at
most to go from one end to the other. If it
takes longer, then change your schedule.
Improving the lives of the disenfranchised,
going out of your way to help your fellow
man — yeah it's worth it. You can't accuse
Stanford of being a corporation if you your
self don't care about the handicapped. It
hurts a lot less when someone bumps into
you versus when someone crashes into you
with their bike catapulting you to the
ground.

I've been walking, biking and driving on
campus for 13 years, and quite frankly,
EVERYONE needs to be more consider
ate. Pedestrians walk all over the road,cross
whenever and wherever they feel like it
without looking and want to blame bikes
for almost knocking them over. Bikers do
run stop signs and don't signal. Cars do
rolling stops, don't signal and don't yield

right of way. (I know — I get almost run
over about two to three times a year.)
Everyone needs to start paying attention.
As for solutions, what the administration
really needs to do is provide better alterna
tives for parking bikes. There isn't enough
convenient bike parking around the Quad,
which is what causes people to park on the
arcades. They solved one problem without
thinking about how to deal with the effects

"Everyone." "Often." "Most." "Almost."
"Sometimes." If I've learned anything in my
three years and three weeks at Stanford, it's
that you simply cannot get away with these
words without at least some semblance of
due diligence. My main concern as a student
at a top research university lies with the lack
of evidence released by the panel that al
legedly spent a considerable amount of ef
fort studying the bike problem. It seems to
me that the administration has adopted a
stance of "we know what's best for you,"
which certainly does not sit well with a cam
pus full of mature, intelligent adults. From
what 1 gather, there has not been a legiti
mate, scientific study on the effects of biking
in the Quad. How such a decision was made
without hard evidence to back it up is com
pletely beyond me. What really ticks me off
about Stanford's stance is not so much the
ban itself, but that the policy is based on
hearsay and conjecture. And to everyone
who has taken the university's side: While
your near-accident anecdotes and support
for accessibility are not to be ignored, it
should be noted that not a single person af

weighed in with their opinion. I'd like to

Regardless of what Dean Powers told
you, the reason why those of us who use the
Arcade — and the many other pedestrian
areas of campus — are relieved with the
ban is because all of us have several times in
our Stanford careers been bumped, bopped,
bowled over or downright clobbered by
speeding bicyclists who are lost in thought
and not paying the least bit of attention to
what they're doing at 25 mph. 1 dodge
dozens of thoughtless bicyclists a day.
Frankly, I'm sick of it. If you guys can't ride
safely and share the way with pedestrians
and motor vehicles, then get off and walk. I
think before ANYONE gets on a bike, they
should be required to pass a test and get a li
cense. And I think that the Stanford Sheriff
and the Police Department should be atten
tive to the hazards that bicyclists pose on the
Stanford campus and handle the droves of
terrible bicycle operators here the same as
they handle poor automobile operators —
that is, by issuing tickets with fines and sus
pending privileges for repeat offenders.

Jim correctly states that there is a danger
posed by reckless biking. Jim also cites the
appropriate sanctions for recklessness —
citations, fines, or revocation of biking priv
ileges on Stanford campus. In the real world
beyond Stanford, there is a danger of reck
less driving (and biking), and we meet that
risk via such sanctions; these sanctions
should work on Stanford as well. The ad
ministration will then say that they lack
manpower to enforce a standard of due care
on the part of bikers, but this excuse has no
merit: Stanford has already stationed police

on the quad to enforce the ban — why can't
these same police attack the real root of the
problem, i.e., recklessness? Prohibition
should never be the first step. Live free or

Mr. Shingles: Of course it's justified. First
of all this isn't an "extreme" measure, learn
to walk an extra 40 feet to get to class. Sec
ondly. if just one person with accessibility
problems was blocked from getting access
to somewhere they needed to go, not incon

venienced, but BLOCKED (often times I
had a hard time getting to the newspaper
stand in the arcades and I have no accessi
bility issues...it would have been impossible
for someone in a wheelchair to do it), then
their request to keep 100 people, or howev
er many there are, from parking their bikes
there is far from unreasonable. Unreason
able would have been requesting that no bi
cycle riding be allowed anywhere on cam
pus.

Come on, everyone has been in a bike
accident or knows some one that has. How
about that for a statistic. Ride your bike to
the outside of the Quad, park outside of it.
It probably takes two to three minutes at
most to go from one end to the other. If it
takes longer, then change your schedule.
Improving the lives of the disenfranchised,
going out of your way to help your fellow
man — yeah it's worth it. You can't accuse
Stanford of being a corporation if you your
self don't care about the handicapped. It
hurts a lot less when someone bumps into
you versus when someone crashes into you
with their bike catapulting you to the
ground.

Response to Worst article ever, to be pre
cise, the students in this situation are the dis
enfranchised, as they had no say in the mat
ter. Also, to be precise, the "fellow man"
being helped in this situation appears to be
Messrs. Collins and Pancorbo, not Tommy
whose legs were shot off in the war.

I've been walking, biking and driving on
campus for 13 years, and quite frankly,
EVERYONE needs to be more consider
ate. Pedestrians walk all over the road,cross
whenever and wherever they feel like it
without looking and want to blame bikes
for almost knocking them over. Bikers do
run stop signs and don't signal. Cars do
rolling stops, don't signal and don't yield

right of way. (I know — I get almost run
over about two to three times a year.)
Everyone needs to start paying attention.
As for solutions, what the administration
really needs to do is provide better alterna
tives for parking bikes. There isn't enough
convenient bike parking around the Quad,
which is what causes people to park on the
arcades. They solved one problem without
thinking about how to deal with the effects
of their solution.

"Everyone." "Often." "Most." "Almost."
"Sometimes." If I've learned anything in my
three years and three weeks at Stanford, it's
that you simply cannot get away with these
words without at least some semblance of
due diligence. My main concern as a student
at a top research university lies with the lack
of evidence released by the panel that al
legedly spent a considerable amount of ef
fort studying the bike problem. It seems to
me that the administration has adopted a
stance of "we know what's best for you,"
which certainly does not sit well with a cam
pus full of mature, intelligent adults. From
what 1 gather, there has not been a legiti
mate, scientific study on the effects of biking
in the Quad. How such a decision was made
without hard evidence to back it up is com
pletely beyond me. What really ticks me off
about Stanford's stance is not so much the
ban itself, but that the policy is based on
hearsay and conjecture. And to everyone
who has taken the university's side: While
your near-accident anecdotes and support
for accessibility are not to be ignored, it
should be noted that not a single person af
fected by such accessibility issues has
weighed in with their opinion. I'd like to
hear from those people this policy is benefit
ing.
