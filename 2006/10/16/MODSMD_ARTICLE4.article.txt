# ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY LEADERS TACKLE GLOBAL CRISES IN AN ERA OF ANXIOUS TIMES
## A 						21 st-century Challenge Panelists confront issues ranging from North Korea to shortage of dean water 
### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
The message behind the Stanford Chal
lenge rang loud and clear Saturday morning
at Maples Pavilion, where the University
elucidated the agenda of its five-year. $4.3
billion fundraising campaign with a round
table discussion featuring the co-founder of

the largest online network, a former secre
tary of state, a former secretary of defense,
the CEO of a pharmaceutical giant, a spe
cialist on biological terrorism and a US
Supreme Court justice.
The early morning discussion centered
around geopolitical issues ripped from the
headlines — from North Korean nuclear
proliferation to the lack of clean water —
and was moderated by reporter and Stan
ford alumnus Ted Koppel. who later told Hie
Daily that the forum was marked by "sur
prising freeness."
Though The Stanford Challenge was
never explicitly mentioned, the roundtable
came just four days after the University an

nounced the campaign and was held before
a 5,000-strong Homecoming Weekend
crowd composed largely of alumni and Uni
versity donors. President John 1 lennessy in
troduced the ground-breaking Stanford
Challenge on Tuesday, specifying that $1.4
billion would be devoted to research in
human health, environmental sustainabilitv
and international peace and security and
more than $ 1.7 billion would be spent to sus
tain current teaching and research pro
grams.
And if those goals seemed vague in last
week's press release. Stanford-educated in
dustry leaders and University faculty
brought those aims into focus.

"This is a global village, and borders
mean nothing to disease." said Jean-Pierre
Gamier, the CEO of the world s second
largest pharmaceutical company Glaxo-
SmithKline. regarding the possibility of a
pandemic. As a I'ulbright Scholar, Gamier
earned a Masters in Business Administra
tion from Stanford in 1974.

gram as he pressed the panelists on
the latest international problems.
Five minutes into the discussion.
Koppel had already broached the
global consequences of North
Korea's nuclear test and attempted
to elicit potential academic and poli
cy solutions to the crisis.
William Perry, a former secretary
of defense under President Clinton
and professor at Stanford's Freeman
Spogli Institute for International
Studies, was less than optimistic.
Perry, who received a bachelor's de
gree from Stanford in 1949. a mas
ter's degree in 1950, and his doctor
ate in 1955, predicted that Iran will
be close to follow and that North
Korea's purported nuclear test will
likely produce an escalating Asian
arms race. Distinguished Hoover
Fellow George Shultz, secretary of
state in the Reagan administration,
agreed with the Clinton adviser and
argued that the United States should
push for "high-level energetic diplo
macy" in multilateral talks with
North Korea.
During the two-hour discussion.
Koppel often introduced hypotheti
cal scenarios to force the panelists to
address real-life possibilities. When
Koppel asked what the United
States should do if a North Korean
ship evaded a potential naval block
ade. Shultz immediately responded
that "you have to follow them and
shoot." Sensing that it was a leading
question, the Reagan adviser contin
ued, "Are you trying to argue that
force doesn't work?"
But talk about North Korea was
n't just limited to foreign policy ex
perts. Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang,
who collected bachelor's and mas
ter's degrees from Stanford in 1990.
said that technology could spark in
creased dialogue between North
Korea and the outside world.
One topic that particularly
piqued the interest of the panel was
the spread of infectious diseases. De
velopmental Biology Prof. Lucy
Shapiro pointed to the recent out
breaks of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) and the West

Nile Virus, arguing that the United
States and the international commu
nity are grossly unprepared for a
pandemic disease.
"We need ordinary things like
face masks, food, water and hospital
beds," she said. "In a market econo
my, there tends to be a small invento
ry of such products. This is absolute
ly orthogonal to what you need to
deal with a pandemic."
In response. Gamier described
the need for pharmaceutical compa
nies to unite together to expand the
supply chain.
"We'll forget about competition,
money and profits." he said. "This is
bigger than us."
Gamier said that he has met with
other pharmaceutical executives and
agreed that, in the event of a pan
demic. their companies should dis
tribute vaccines to the first people
infected, adding that he had also met
with President Bush and that the
president agreed. But, he continued,
the Federal Trade Commission has
yet to approve a potential consolida
tion in a time of crisis because of
anti-trust regulations.
Koppel told The Daily after the
forum that this proposal was a sur
prise to him. *! !
'•Here's an American president
who has signed on to the notion that
medicine should be sent to. let's say,
Indonesia to impede the spread of
some disease," Koppel said. "Can
you imagine the political impact of
such a decision?"
Koppel also said he had not antic
ipated that Supreme Court Justice
Anthony Kennedy would "speak as
freely as he did." While most sitting
justices rarely speak publicly to
maintain an appearance impartiality,
Kennedy addressed some critical is
sues raised in the discussion.
The justice specifically delved
into the lack of clean water and its
global implications, especially in
sub-Saharan Africa. Kennedy said
that over two billion people in the
world have unsafe drinking water
and that Africans spend over eight
billion hours each year finding clean
water for themselves and their fami
lies. lie predicted that war in the
twenty-first century would not be
motivated by lack of oil but by lack
of water.
Shultz immediately chimed in.

"1 low many times do we have to
be hit in the head by a 2 x 4 to learn
that we have to use less oil." drawing
thunderous applause from the
crowd.
Koppel also addressed the state
of civil liberties in the I Jnited States
in a post-9/11 world, which sparked
Kennedy to passionately argue for
the importance of democratic tradi
tions.
" ITie ultimate security of our na
tion is our commitment to democra
cy." Kennedy said. "The President
and Congress must realize that they
too have a commitment to the Con
stitution," a statement which also
drew applause.
Kennedy added that."We are still
trying to find a way to have a ration
al. democratic discourse that is not
mundane, fractious and evasive."
The panelists also addressed edu
cational failures, especially among
younger generations, as panelists
pointed to deficiencies in basic math
and science literacy and civics
knowledge. Perry, however, defend
ed his students.
"1 have 200 people in my class,
and they are exceptionally well-in
formed," he said. "I understand that
this is not. by any means, an accu
rate cross-section of the population,
but these are our future leaders. 1
look at my students, and I have
great hope."
When the forum came to a close,
Koppel gave the panel an "A+" and
thanked the audience for spending
their morning listening to "a bunch
of smart people talk about tough is
sues."
Audience members said they ap
preciated the discussion, but some
complained that the forum tried to
cover too many issues.
"1 think it's really hard to delve
into so many issues in just two
hours." said 2004 graduate Anh Tan.
"They all had these ground princi
ples but nothing beyond that be
cause of lack of time."
Most members of the audience,
however, said that they were glad
they attended.
"It was fantastic," said 1956 grad
uate Richard Bush. "I liked the
breadth of the discussions and what
they had to say We're up for our fifti
eth reunion and this was the best
part of the trip."
