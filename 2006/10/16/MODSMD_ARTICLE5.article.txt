## Fighting disease, one processor at a time Folding@home allows gamers to accelerate data processing 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
When hardcore video game enthu
siasts put down hundreds of dollars for
a graphics card and are not constantly
playing Halo or Half-Life 2, they can
now help solve ailments like
Alzheimer's disease.
At least that is the hope of Stan
ford's Folding@home program, a
piece of downloadable software that
adds a computer's processing power to

a network of hundreds of thousands of
others engaged in simulating protein
folding. Ilie makers of the program
have just completed an update of
Folding(f?home to t;ikc advantage of
the huge processing power in ATI
Technologies graphics cards, which
have been marketed primarily toward
gamers.
Vijay Pande. an associate professor
of chemistry and manager of the re
search group that created
home, said that by using
these cards, the group has been able to
achieve speeds 40 times greater than
that of the typical Pentium 4 Proces
sor.
"That turns three years of calcula
tion into one month," Pande said.
Created to deal with issues too
complex to run on supercomputers,
distributed computer networks have
been used to provide information on
massive science problems. Fold-
specifically deals with the
three-dimensional shapes most pro
teins need to fold into in order to
function properly. Protein misfold
mg is common in many diseases, such
as Alzheimer's and Huntington's.
Pande described the immense
computational power needed to
study protein folding.
"What we're trying to understand
is a biological molecule using
physics," Pande said."Because ot the
application of physics, we don't need
to rely on prior experiments, but
work from first principles. But since
atoms move extremely fast, the time
increments we need to study are very
short, around a quadrillionth of a
second."
There are problems, however.

with using just one computer to map
protein formations.
"It's possible to do around one
million iterations in a day,"he said.
"So that gets you up to one billionth
of a second. It would take one billion
days t)ii one computer to get even
one second of data. Now. not much
that's interesting happens in a bil
lionth of a second, but some interest
ing things start to happen around
one millisecond. But even that is one
million days, which come out to
roughly thirty thousand years. But if
you have one hundred thousand
computers working on the problem
at the same time, that only takes ten
days."
Folding@home was released six
years ago in late 2000. In order to
make the program function proper
ly. the team had to develop the algo
rithms needed to enable hundreds of
thousands of computers in distant lo
cations to work in concert.
"Those algorithms are very im
portant." Pande said. "You could
imagine having 120 students taking
an exam in an hour. ITie professor
says to the students that they can all
work together on the exam, but they
have to finish in 30 seconds."

The algorithms also minimize de
mands on individual users' Internet
connections. Typically a computer
will be assigned a calculation that
takes anywhere from a few hours to
a couple days.The result of the calcu
lation is then relayed to a central
server. At most, only a couple
megabytes of information is passed
to the client computer and back,
meaning that even users with slow
connections can participate.
Folding@home is currently run
ning on 200.000 computers and. in
the six years since its release, nearly
two million computers have partici
pated. As a result, the Pande Group
has published 45 scientific papers
using Folding@home*s results.
After developing technology for
ATI graphic cards, Folding@home is
now working to expand to video
game consoles.
"We're also leasing software for
the PS3," Pande said. "Apparently
the chip in the PS3 is very fast.
Graphics Processing Units and the
Playstation 3 use something called a
streaming processor. Those stream
ing processors do very well for
games, the new thing here is our abil
ity to use them for science."
