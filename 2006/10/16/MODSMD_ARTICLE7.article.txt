## Party Planner: Pimpettes and Hos 
### ALEX GOVERE INTERMISSION PARTY PLANNER 
Pimps and 1 los. Back To School. Let's Get Physical. Why is
it that campus parties are always given names that encourage
girls to dress like strippers, school-girls or some other variant of
the common whore? I've even been to a winter event that
somehow managed to put a naked twist on things: Snowboard
ers tV Snow Bunnies. In this case, "snow" was just another word
for "Playboy." and any female who didn't trek across campus in
a matching bra-panty-ugg ensemble wasn't allowed in. Appar
ently. guys snowboard in warm pants and thick jackets, but us
girls always hit the slopes in our lingerie.
Inequality? Sexism? 1 think so.
Wait! Don't stop reading! ITiere will be no feminist (or sub
stantive...) rants in this article. I understand every man's need
to see some boobies, I understand every girl's reasons for show
ing some boobies, and I'm pretty sure the frats will never be
down for a night of "Pimps and Respectable Young Ladies."
Rather than even the score by suggesting a "Pope" theme for
SAL's next party, I'd like to bring another concept to the table:
Pimpettes and llos.
The P&H party - should it ever occur - will be just like any
other. Drinks, music, awkward encounters. However, unlike
your average rave, male attendants will be required to come
naked. 1 wanna see man-boobs, I wanna see beer guts and (I re
alize I'm about to break rule numero uno in the unwritten book
of macho laws, but...) I wanna see thighs.
Here's the formal invite to my non-existent party:
What' ? Pimpettes and Hos
Where ? Anywhere, as long as male attendants are
dressed (or rather undressed) for the occasion.
When ? On the coldest night of the quarter.
Why' ? Because Stanford boys don't fully understand what
it's like to walk from Mirrielees to the Row on a chilly Friday
night. Because the deservingly narcissistic frat boys need to be
distinguished from the "but-his-faces." And, most importantly,
because Free Willy is every girl's favorite movie.
Anything else, you crazy bitch?
Yes. I hate those awkward moments at parties when the lights
turn on for a few seconds. You know what I'm talking about.
They generally happen near closing-time, when the residents
of a once clean and puke-free house want you to get the hell
out The lights flash, and you suddenly regret not holding a lit
phone to your partner's face before agreeing to hit the dance
floor. For this reason,and because I'd like to invoke maximum
male-embarrassment, Pimpettes and Hos will be fully-lit at all
times.
I suppose I should end this with a clever declaration of who
can and cannot drink. As always, it will be "SUID to enter, vagi
na to get within 10 feet of the beer." Sorry boys. Even naked,
you ain't nettin' anywhere near the alcohol.
