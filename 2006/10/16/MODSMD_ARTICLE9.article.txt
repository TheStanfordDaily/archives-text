"I fell asleep while
giving an IHUM
presentation."
— Luke Beckman,
Class of 2009

"I left my room unlocked re
ally late at night and this guy,
who'd been getting drunk at
the party downstairs, must
have thought my room was
the bathroom because he
came in and peed all over
my stuff. It really trauma
tized my roommate, and we
locked the door after that."
— Jessica Hu, Class of 2007



"I peed on a water fountain.
Then I flushed by pressing
the little button. I didn't even
know about it until the next
morning."
—Alex, Class of 2009

"I wheelied my bike onto a curb
and busted my tire. It made a re
ally loud noise and everyone
stared at me for a short bit and
then went on with their lives."
— Nate Janewit, Class of 2006



"I fell off my bike three times in a
row. The first time was a couple
days earlier, but the last two were
in the space of about 15 minutes."
— Helen Chen, Class of 2007
