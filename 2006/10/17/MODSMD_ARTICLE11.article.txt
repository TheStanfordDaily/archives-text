Our Tragic Haw
The Hubble is a natural flaw in our uni
versity system that must be conquered
at every turn. On Day Three of NSO,
we freshly-minted bubbleheads, already dis
engaged from the natural flow of human ex
istence by 72 hours of palm trees and dorm
cheers, got our first "Bursting the Bubble"
talk, as inevitable as "the Birds and the
Bees" discussion in junior high.Trapped in
side of our snow globe campus, we lose sight
of the outside world. 1 low can you play intra
mural dodgeball when Chinese citizens still
face party censorship? How can you sip Or
ange Dream Machine when people still
wake up in Guantanamo Bay? How can you
speak of Kierkegaard when North Korea
just tested nuclear weapons? We are not liv
ing real life here at Stanford; across the free
way, beyond the IKEA and the Best Buy.
that's real life. For over two years now. my
freshman dorm has been waging email war
over how to spend the $600 left in our dorm
fund: C)ne camp insists we throw a party with
booze and bouncy castles, the other pushes
for donations to charity. For shame, bouncy
castles.
The Playground
The Bubble is the only world that should
matter to us. Maybe someday you can feed
the poor and solve the Middle East, but right
now we're still just kids. The problems will

still be there in four years, and if you think
Ibe Review or The Roosevelt Institution are
changing the world, you. Sir or Madame,
need to get laid. You can still cure cancer
when you're 23. but by that age, you can no
longer wake up in time for lunch, leave for
class unshowered wearing your pajamas and
flip-flops or flirt with the cute guy or girl in
your IHUM section. Check Google News,
watch "The Daily Show" or read "The Econ
omist" if you must, but don't bother me with
your supposed outside world. I've got more
important things on my mind.
Look, But Don't Touch
The Bubble is so shiny. Go work out in our
new gym. Watch football in our new stadium.
Watch them build the new Old Union, the
new Law School dorm and the new under
ground parking lot. Jamba Juice wasn't here
a few years ago. Neither was Subway. The
bookstore just got a spit shine. So did the
Treehouse. Don't you like all those plasma

screens? Doesn't Hoover Tower look freak
ishly clean? It is the beautiful cycle of recon
struction. Your dorm will look very different
in a few years. They recarpeted Larkin a few
weeks after my class moved out. There is no
sadness here, no nostalgia, because the im
portant places in your life are only memories.
It reminds me a bit of the Getty Museum in
Los Angeles — sparkly as a 30th century
Utopia, hollow as a plaster cast.
Role-Playing (iame
Ilie Bubble is an open-ended gaming
universe following the "Sandbox" model
epitomized by "Grand Theft Auto." Within
the boundaries, you can do anything you
want: run naked through the Quad, smoke
weed on theTheta Chi rooftop, throw empty
beer bottles off the balcony, sleep with ugly
people with low self esteem and beautiful
people with low self esteem. Sure, the cops
get on your tail every now and then, but you
can usually lose them, or, if need be, launch
a rocket launcher. In "Vice City," if you flew
too far away from the island, the graphics
got all woozy. It feels the same when you
leave campus —palm trees and bike lanes
give way to hills, a golf course, endless roads
and endless traffic down Palm Drive. The
world gets fuzzy, and then you're back in re
ality.

La Molilalia di Purgatorio
The world inside the Bubble is
Purgatory, a necessary step in our
steady climb toward a higher plane
of existence, which could be grad
school, med school or JP Morgan.
Ilie days are all the same here. Noth
ing ever really changes, but every
thing always moves forward. You see
the same people and the same faces.
Some people leave early, some peo
ple stay longer. Nothing we do here
really matters. That will come later,
when we enter the Paradise of Real
ity (which comes with a salary, a
stipend or a welfare check). You'll
find, at graduation, that you've
changed, but you won't know how.
Within the (ilass Bubble, Behind
the (»reen Wall
Ihe Bubble is a Utopian outpost, a
vision of the perfect future, a verita
ble City on the Hill whose light
shines throughout the world and in
the pages of the U.S. News and World
Report college rankings. We are the
lucky chosen few, selected for specif
ic genetic characteristics like intelli
gence, leadership capability,
Olympic-level physique and SAT
scores. Although we feel sad for our
friends and loved ones who remain
behind, we owe it to them to do

everything we can for the advance
ment of the human race. We will ex
pand our minds and perfect our bod
ies. Anything which is not useful —
parties, kegs in shopping carts, skate
boards. fun — must be cleansed, ac
cording toour Beloved Fundamental
Standard. All is perfect within our
Blessed Bubble. The streets are
clean. Dying Palm Trees are replaced
in the evening, out of sight of joggers.
Our feces smell of peppermint.
Like A Drug
The Bubble is addictive. By the
time you're a senior, you know
everybody, and the people you don't
know probably know everybody
else. This closeness is addictive; it is
similar to Manhattan, where you al
ways run into everybody, especially
when you don't want to. Once you've
lived in Manhattan, you can't live in
Omaha. And once you've lived at
Stanford, the rest of the world can't
help but seem all wrong — too spa
cious. filled with people you don't
know and never will. This is why so
many people stay here for as long as
possible, why there are so many
Stanford marriages, why so many
alumni still give so much to the
school even as they complain about
everything from the football team to
the "new" mascot (remember, they
were Indians.) Call it the Bravman
Complex.

Darren i'ranich thinks "Lost"is an al
legory for the Stanford experience.
