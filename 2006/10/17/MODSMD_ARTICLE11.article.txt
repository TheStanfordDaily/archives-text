Our Tragic Haw
The Hubble is a natural flaw in our uni
versity system that must be conquered
at every turn. On Day Three of NSO,
we freshly-minted bubbleheads, already dis
engaged from the natural flow of human ex
istence by 72 hours of palm trees and dorm
cheers, got our first "Bursting the Bubble"
talk, as inevitable as "the Birds and the
Bees" discussion in junior high.Trapped in
side of our snow globe campus, we lose sight
of the outside world. 1 low can you play intra
mural dodgeball when Chinese citizens still
face party censorship? How can you sip Or
ange Dream Machine when people still
wake up in Guantanamo Bay? How can you
speak of Kierkegaard when North Korea
just tested nuclear weapons? We are not liv
ing real life here at Stanford; across the free
way, beyond the IKEA and the Best Buy.
that's real life. For over two years now. my
freshman dorm has been waging email war
over how to spend the $600 left in our dorm
fund: C)ne camp insists we throw a party with
booze and bouncy castles, the other pushes
for donations to charity. For shame, bouncy
castles.
The Playground
The Bubble is the only world that should
matter to us. Maybe someday you can feed
the poor and solve the Middle East, but right
now we're still just kids. The problems will

still be there in four years, and if you think
Ibe Review or The Roosevelt Institution are
changing the world, you. Sir or Madame,
need to get laid. You can still cure cancer
when you're 23. but by that age, you can no
longer wake up in time for lunch, leave for
class unshowered wearing your pajamas and
flip-flops or flirt with the cute guy or girl in
your IHUM section. Check Google News,
watch "The Daily Show" or read "The Econ
omist" if you must, but don't bother me with
your supposed outside world. I've got more
important things on my mind.
Look, But Don't Touch
The Bubble is so shiny. Go work out in our
new gym. Watch football in our new stadium.
Watch them build the new Old Union, the
new Law School dorm and the new under
ground parking lot. Jamba Juice wasn't here
a few years ago. Neither was Subway. The
bookstore just got a spit shine. So did the
Treehouse. Don't you like all those plasma

screens? Doesn't Hoover Tower look freak
ishly clean? It is the beautiful cycle of recon
struction. Your dorm will look very different
in a few years. They recarpeted Larkin a few
weeks after my class moved out. There is no
sadness here, no nostalgia, because the im
portant places in your life are only memories.
It reminds me a bit of the Getty Museum in
Los Angeles — sparkly as a 30th century
Utopia, hollow as a plaster cast.
Role-Playing (iame
Ilie Bubble is an open-ended gaming
universe following the "Sandbox" model
epitomized by "Grand Theft Auto." Within
the boundaries, you can do anything you
want: run naked through the Quad, smoke
weed on theTheta Chi rooftop, throw empty
beer bottles off the balcony, sleep with ugly
people with low self esteem and beautiful
people with low self esteem. Sure, the cops
get on your tail every now and then, but you
can usually lose them, or, if need be, launch
a rocket launcher. In "Vice City," if you flew
too far away from the island, the graphics
got all woozy. It feels the same when you
leave campus —palm trees and bike lanes
give way to hills, a golf course, endless roads
and endless traffic down Palm Drive. The
world gets fuzzy, and then you're back in re
ality.
