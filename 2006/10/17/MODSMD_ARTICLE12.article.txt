I hate to say it to you guys, hut better
that you have "Not My Fault" Walt at the
helm than we do. Don't expect your recruit
ing to get better, either. He burned so many
bridges with high schools here, you can still
smell the smoke. I do. however, feel your
pain. The guy doesn't deserve a job in col
lege football. The so-called "offensive ge
nius" only got you 52 yards this week. Do
the smart thing, don't wait as long as we did

at Pitt. Can him now before he does more
damage to your program.

For such a nationally recognized univer
sity and with what Stanford can offer in
salary, great coaches should be (and proba
bly are) beating down your door to take
Harris's job. This isn't Division 111 football;
this is Pac-10, Division I-A football. How
can Harris be tolerated there? Rebuild
now. You drag the whole conference down
when you don't compete. If indeed Stan
ford has gone the way of the Ivy Leagues in
terms of athletics, then perhaps they should
drop out of the Pac-10 and into the Big
West.

Having been through the end of the
Elway and the beginning of the Green
era, I witnessed some tough times. A few
observations: High profile coaches can

get the best recruits. The real question â€”
is it worth the fuss and money? Stanford
excels in so many sports other than foot
ball. Admissions has to make fewer
stretches to do so. The student section has
always been drowned out by the visitors
section. The alums across the way are
even quieter. We don't have a fight song
that anyone knows. Stanford is filled with
grad students and undergrads who are en
gaged on so many levels that you can't ex
pect them to file loyally to the stadium
every week. They have other things to do
that are more fulfilling personally. The
Bay Area has so much to offer that it will
never draw local fans like Ohio State,
Penn State, Texas, Michigan, etc. Stanford
students should look at the record and re
alize that every few years we experience a
wonderful moment when we have enough
