I hate to say it to you guys, hut better
that you have "Not My Fault" Walt at the
helm than we do. Don't expect your recruit
ing to get better, either. He burned so many
bridges with high schools here, you can still
smell the smoke. I do. however, feel your
pain. The guy doesn't deserve a job in col
lege football. The so-called "offensive ge
nius" only got you 52 yards this week. Do
the smart thing, don't wait as long as we did

at Pitt. Can him now before he does more
damage to your program.

For such a nationally recognized univer
sity and with what Stanford can offer in
salary, great coaches should be (and proba
bly are) beating down your door to take
Harris's job. This isn't Division 111 football;
this is Pac-10, Division I-A football. How
can Harris be tolerated there? Rebuild
now. You drag the whole conference down
when you don't compete. If indeed Stan
ford has gone the way of the Ivy Leagues in
terms of athletics, then perhaps they should
drop out of the Pac-10 and into the Big
West.

Having been through the end of the
Elway and the beginning of the Green
era, I witnessed some tough times. A few
observations: High profile coaches can

get the best recruits. The real question —
is it worth the fuss and money? Stanford
excels in so many sports other than foot
ball. Admissions has to make fewer
stretches to do so. The student section has
always been drowned out by the visitors
section. The alums across the way are
even quieter. We don't have a fight song
that anyone knows. Stanford is filled with
grad students and undergrads who are en
gaged on so many levels that you can't ex
pect them to file loyally to the stadium
every week. They have other things to do
that are more fulfilling personally. The
Bay Area has so much to offer that it will
never draw local fans like Ohio State,
Penn State, Texas, Michigan, etc. Stanford
students should look at the record and re
alize that every few years we experience a
wonderful moment when we have enough
"student-athlete" football players
gel as a unit and put together a bowl
season. Enjoy them and appreciate
the effort your fellow students put
into their activities and sports. If
you want a school driven by big
money football and basketball pro
grams, you should have gone to
Notre Dame or Duke, to name a
few.

Bear Territory — Stanford does
n't pay coaches market rate. Ted Ice
land: ?The idea that we would pay
our football coach two times what
we pay the University president —
what kind of signal does that send??
Never mind that the University pres
ident is a millionaire.

From the "Tilings 1 thought 1
would never type" vault, is there any
chance we could get Buddy Teevens
back? I'm pretty sure his nifty draw
play could produce more than 52
total yards.

Take a look at what it took for

Cal to make a quick turn around:
more than ten junior college trans
fers. You aren't going to get away
with that at Stanford. Maybe the
program is doomed, but college
football coaches should not make
more than a university president.
Well, unless you think the identity of
school is defined by its big time foot
ball and basketball programs. Look
at the studies: big time programs vir
tually never turn the profits one
would assume.

1 am constantly depressed by our
football team, but 1 applaud Stan
ford for not placing it above our ac
ademics. Every member of our foot
ball team got accepted into Stan
ford for both their athletic skills
AND their academic record — no
dumb jocks here. And thank good
ness we don't pay our coach more
than our president. Stanford's foot
ball team may not be as good as
those at other schools, but at least
we have plenty of other things to be
proud about.

Why would athletics not be held
to the same standards as academics?
If students fail to perform in the
classroom, they don't last. Athletes
should be held to the same standards
within their sport. If it's OK to hold

professors to the "publish or perish"
rule, why should coaches not be ex
pected to produce results?

Why the heck didn't we hire
Norm Chow when we had the
chance? One thing that I still can't
wrap my head around is how the
head coach remarks every week that
we "can't compete physically." No
kidding. One thing 1 noticed with the
new stadium being so close to the
field is that I'm bigger than all but
one or two of the players/Iliat wasn't
the case when I was an undergrad six
years ago. (Yeah, so I put on a few
pounds, but you get my point.) And.
correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it
the responsibility of the head coach
to recruit, train and FEED his play
ers so that they CAN compete phys
ically in the Pac-10? Give me a
break. Walt. Get some linemen that
can protect your star OB and let him
show off.The program isn't dead: it'll
come back as soon as we find the
right coach. I have been a diehard
football fan since freshman year

some 10 years ago. and don't plan on
giving up now. Oh yeah. Buddy
Teevens was a heck of a lot worse
than Harris. Remember those are
11 IS players out there.

Okay, so I'm older than all you
gu\s put together. I started watching
Stanford football as a freshman in
1%7. I don't think I've ever seen
more boring, less inspired play selec
tion than what we're getting this
year. Saturday's game had ONE
mildly interesting offensive play and
it was a quick kick. Whoopee. I lan is
and/or his offensive coordinator
need to realize that Stanford AL
WAYS runs a few gadget plays, often
with some success. That's how you
make it fun for fans and try to bal
ance the talent deficit. (Or depth
deficit, to be more polite.) What does
it take to give these guys a clue?

Why would athletics not be held
to the same standards as academics?
If students fail to perform in the
classroom, they don't last. Athletes
should be held to the same standards
within their sport. If it's OK to hold

professors to the "publish or perish"
rule, why should coaches not be ex
pected to produce results?

Why the heck didn't we hire
Norm Chow when we had the
chance? One thing that I still can't
wrap my head around is how the
head coach remarks every week that
we "can't compete physically." No
kidding. One thing 1 noticed with the
new stadium being so close to the
field is that I'm bigger than all but
one or two of the players/Iliat wasn't
the case when I was an undergrad six
years ago. (Yeah, so I put on a few
pounds, but you get my point.) And.
correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it
the responsibility of the head coach
to recruit, train and FEED his play
ers so that they CAN compete phys
ically in the Pac-10? Give me a
break. Walt. Get some linemen that
can protect your star OB and let him
show off.The program isn't dead: it'll
come back as soon as we find the
right coach. I have been a diehard
football fan since freshman year

some 10 years ago. and don't plan on
giving up now. Oh yeah. Buddy
Teevens was a heck of a lot worse
than Harris. Remember those are
11 IS players out there.

Okay, so I'm older than all you
gu\s put together. I started watching
Stanford football as a freshman in
1%7. I don't think I've ever seen
more boring, less inspired play selec
tion than what we're getting this
year. Saturday's game had ONE
mildly interesting offensive play and
it was a quick kick. Whoopee. I lan is
and/or his offensive coordinator
need to realize that Stanford AL
WAYS runs a few gadget plays, often
with some success. That's how you
make it fun for fans and try to bal
ance the talent deficit. (Or depth
deficit, to be more polite.) What does
it take to give these guys a clue?

I hate to say it to you guys, hut better
that you have "Not My Fault" Walt at the
helm than we do. Don't expect your recruit
ing to get better, either. He burned so many
bridges with high schools here, you can still
smell the smoke. I do. however, feel your
pain. The guy doesn't deserve a job in col
lege football. The so-called "offensive ge
nius" only got you 52 yards this week. Do
the smart thing, don't wait as long as we did

at Pitt. Can him now before he does more
damage to your program.

For such a nationally recognized univer
sity and with what Stanford can offer in
salary, great coaches should be (and proba
bly are) beating down your door to take
Harris's job. This isn't Division 111 football;
this is Pac-10, Division I-A football. How
can Harris be tolerated there? Rebuild
now. You drag the whole conference down
when you don't compete. If indeed Stan
ford has gone the way of the Ivy Leagues in
terms of athletics, then perhaps they should
drop out of the Pac-10 and into the Big
West.

Having been through the end of the
Elway and the beginning of the Green
era, I witnessed some tough times. A few
observations: High profile coaches can

get the best recruits. The real question —
is it worth the fuss and money? Stanford
excels in so many sports other than foot
ball. Admissions has to make fewer
stretches to do so. The student section has
always been drowned out by the visitors
section. The alums across the way are
even quieter. We don't have a fight song
that anyone knows. Stanford is filled with
grad students and undergrads who are en
gaged on so many levels that you can't ex
pect them to file loyally to the stadium
every week. They have other things to do
that are more fulfilling personally. The
Bay Area has so much to offer that it will
never draw local fans like Ohio State,
Penn State, Texas, Michigan, etc. Stanford
students should look at the record and re
alize that every few years we experience a
wonderful moment when we have enough
"student-athlete" football players
gel as a unit and put together a bowl
season. Enjoy them and appreciate
the effort your fellow students put
into their activities and sports. If
you want a school driven by big
money football and basketball pro
grams, you should have gone to
Notre Dame or Duke, to name a
few.

Bear Territory — Stanford does
n't pay coaches market rate. Ted Ice
land: ?The idea that we would pay
our football coach two times what
we pay the University president —
what kind of signal does that send??
Never mind that the University pres
ident is a millionaire.

From the "Tilings 1 thought 1
would never type" vault, is there any
chance we could get Buddy Teevens
back? I'm pretty sure his nifty draw
play could produce more than 52
total yards.

Take a look at what it took for

Cal to make a quick turn around:
more than ten junior college trans
fers. You aren't going to get away
with that at Stanford. Maybe the
program is doomed, but college
football coaches should not make
more than a university president.
Well, unless you think the identity of
school is defined by its big time foot
ball and basketball programs. Look
at the studies: big time programs vir
tually never turn the profits one
would assume.

1 am constantly depressed by our
football team, but 1 applaud Stan
ford for not placing it above our ac
ademics. Every member of our foot
ball team got accepted into Stan
ford for both their athletic skills
AND their academic record — no
dumb jocks here. And thank good
ness we don't pay our coach more
than our president. Stanford's foot
ball team may not be as good as
those at other schools, but at least
we have plenty of other things to be
proud about.
