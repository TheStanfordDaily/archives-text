COACHING RECORDS AND FIND HERSELF ON THE
WINNING SIDE WITH THE CARDINAL, AS THE WOMEN'S
BASKETBALL HEAD COACH SIGNED A SIX-YEAR CONTRACT EX
TENSION YESTERDAY. ATHLETIC DIRECTOR 808 BOWLSBY
ANNOUNCED THAT VANDERVEER'S RESIDENCY ON THE FARM
WILL LAST THROUGH AT LEAST THE 2011-2012 SEASON.

"Tara VanDerveer has established herself as one of the elite coaches in women's basketball
and we are extremely proud to have her lead the Stanford basketball program into the
Bowlsby said in a press release.
VanDerveer, last year's Pac-10 Coach of the Year, has led Stanford to two NCAA champi
onships, five Final Four appearances, 14 Pac-10 titles and 18 consecutive NCAA appearances
in her 21 years at the helm of the women's

team.
Last year. VanDerveer led the Cardinal
to its third Elite Eight appearance in a row,

I with a 26-8 overall record. In a win against
Oregon State last February, VanDerveer reached

the 650-win mark of her Stanford career, and she V
now holds the fourth-highest career winning per
centage among active Division I women's basketball
coaches.
"I've had such a great time here,and I'm excited about

the team and its future," VanDerveer said. "I love living out
here. Stanford is a fabulous university to represent, and I feel
that it's a good fit for me with such high academic standards and
top athletics — it's excellent in both areas."

This year, the Cardinal women are ranked No. 4 nationally in pre
season polls by Street & Smith's College Basketball Yearbook and
Athlon Sports. Lindy's poll ranked the Cardinal No. 3 in the nation.

As for personal honors, VanDerveer was inducted into the Women's Bas-v

The hardest part is staying on top, hot
getting to the top;
TARA VANDERVhER, women's be • oach

With the respect and recognition
of her players, colleagues and the
public, VanDerveer has the oppor
tunity to pursue endeavors outside
Stanford, but she continues to be
comfortable with her current tenure
as head coach.
"You ask yourself if there are the
some places you should be instead,
or other things you should be doing,
but 1 was fortunate enough to go on
sabbatical for a year and coach the
women's Olympic team," Van-
Derveer said."lt's good to try differ
ent things,and I'm glad 1 had the op
portunity to go off for a year and
then come back to Stanford."
VanDerveer's turn as head coach
of the 1996 Olympic women's bas
ketball team yielded a gold medal.
However, VanDerveer isn't so much
focused on records and tangible
signs of accomplishment as she is the
improvement of herself and her

players.
"It's a big pleasure of mine to de
velop players and help them reach
their potential," she said. "It's un
derstandable that you always want
to improve, and I'm always trying to
refine what I do. I find a sense of ur
gency in taking teams as far as they
can go."
Coming to Stanford in 1985 after
two seasons (1978-1980) as head
coach at the University of Idaho and
five seasons (1980-1985) at Ohio
State, VanDerveer helped build
Stanford women's basketball as its
third coach in history. Now heading
one of the best programs in the na
tion. VanDerveer still finds inspira
tion to pursue even more success in
women's basketball.
"What I've found is that the
hardest part is staying on top. not
getting to the top," she said. "I came
here and helped build this program,
but now it's all about maintaining
it."
Bowlsby, whom VanDerveer is
excited to work with, agreed that she
has been an exemplary leader in
University athletics.

"In her 20 years at Stanford.
lara's teams have continually repre
sented excellence both on and off
the court, and her record ot success
speaks for itself." he said in a press
release. "She is recognized on a na
tional and international level as one
of the sport's premier coaches and
we are fortunate to have a coach of
Tara's caliber lead our women's bas
ketball program."
Grateful for the contributions of
her supporting staff, which Van-
Derveer said the contract extension
reflects well for. she now has her
focus set on the Cardinal's quickly
approaching season start.
"I'm glad we came to this agree
ment now; it had great timeliness as
we head into what should be an ex
citing season," VanDerveer said.
VanPerveer begins her 21st sea
son with the first of two Cardinal ex
hibition games Nov. 2 against Chico
State. The regular-season opener
follows one week later when Stan
ford hosts Loyola Marymount in the
opening round of the Preseason
Women's National Invitation Tour
nament (WNIT).
