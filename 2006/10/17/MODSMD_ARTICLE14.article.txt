# The
						not-socowardly Lyons
## 
### 
Much to my chagrin, this past Sat
urday marked the end of an era
for baseball and color commen
tary. After facing criticism for much of his
professional career, announcer Steve
Lyons saw the untimely demise of his
broadcasting career with his termination
by FOX.
Although his name may have been
forever tainted, the former tirst-round
draft pick can take some satisfaction in
his illustrious career, which is why 1 am
dedicating this week's column to the
man. the myth, the "Psycho": Steve
Lyons.
Lyons played with four different
squads from 1985 to 1993 after being
drafted 14th overall by the Boston Red
Sox in 1981. He played all nine positions
at the major-league level, including two
appearances as pitcher, where he surren
dered three hits and one run in three in
nings. Lyons hit .252 with 19 round-trip
pers during his career.
While playing with the White Sox in
1990, Lyons unwittingly mooned both a
packed house at Tiger Stadium and a na
tional television audience after attempt
ing to clean dirt out of his pants following
a head-first slide to first base. Only after
the Tigers faithful offered an appropriate
response did Lyons finally recognize his
error and pull up his pants.
Lyons left the field in 1993 and was
hired by FOX as an MLB color commen
tator in 1996. Unfortunately for FOX,
and baseball fans everywhere, Lyons con
tinued to earn his "Psycho" nickname
with years of questionable comments.
He did, however, have a strong fol
lowing. While walking around Dodger
Stadium in August, a group of fans ran
into Lyons and fellow broadcaster Kevin
Kennedy. Lyons said "nice poncho" to
one very special fan (me), forever earn
ing the fan's favor. That support some
what manifests itself in this very column,
but 1 can still relate with Lyons' many de
tractors.
For example, covering a Dodgers
game in 2(X)4. Lyons questioned former
Dodger Shawn Green's decision to sit
out a game on Yom Kippur.
"He's not even a practicing Jew,"
Lyons said during the broadcast. "He
didn't marry a Jewish girl. And from what
I understand, he never had a bar mitzvah.
which is unfortunate because he doesn't
get the money."
