# The 						not-socowardly Lyons
## 
### 
Much to my chagrin, this past Sat
urday marked the end of an era
for baseball and color commen
tary. After facing criticism for much of his
professional career, announcer Steve
Lyons saw the untimely demise of his
broadcasting career with his termination
by FOX.
Although his name may have been
forever tainted, the former tirst-round
draft pick can take some satisfaction in
his illustrious career, which is why 1 am
dedicating this week's column to the
man. the myth, the "Psycho": Steve
Lyons.
Lyons played with four different
squads from 1985 to 1993 after being
drafted 14th overall by the Boston Red
Sox in 1981. He played all nine positions
at the major-league level, including two
appearances as pitcher, where he surren
dered three hits and one run in three in
nings. Lyons hit .252 with 19 round-trip
pers during his career.
While playing with the White Sox in
1990, Lyons unwittingly mooned both a
packed house at Tiger Stadium and a na
tional television audience after attempt
ing to clean dirt out of his pants following
a head-first slide to first base. Only after
the Tigers faithful offered an appropriate
response did Lyons finally recognize his
error and pull up his pants.
Lyons left the field in 1993 and was
hired by FOX as an MLB color commen
tator in 1996. Unfortunately for FOX,
and baseball fans everywhere, Lyons con
tinued to earn his "Psycho" nickname
with years of questionable comments.
He did, however, have a strong fol
lowing. While walking around Dodger
Stadium in August, a group of fans ran
into Lyons and fellow broadcaster Kevin
Kennedy. Lyons said "nice poncho" to
one very special fan (me), forever earn
ing the fan's favor. That support some
what manifests itself in this very column,
but 1 can still relate with Lyons' many de
tractors.
For example, covering a Dodgers
game in 2(X)4. Lyons questioned former
Dodger Shawn Green's decision to sit
out a game on Yom Kippur.
"He's not even a practicing Jew,"
Lyons said during the broadcast. "He
didn't marry a Jewish girl. And from what
I understand, he never had a bar mitzvah.
which is unfortunate because he doesn't
get the money."

Fox suspended Lyons and apolo
gized on his behalf.
His blunders in 2006, however,
proved to be the final straw. During
Game One of the NLDS between the
Mets and Dodgers, Lyons and Thom
Brennaman mocked a fan wearing an
unusual device on his head at Shea
Stadium.
"Maybe he's in virtual reality,"
Lyons said. "He should stay there."
Stephen Teitelbaum is in fact near
ly blind and had been using a special

video device that allowed him to see
the field. After several complaints to
FOX, both the network and Brenna
man apologized for the comments.
And finally, while covering the
ALCS with Lyons this season, former
manager Lou Piniella used Spanish to
describe certain players,calling Frank
Thomas "frio" and needing to go "en
fuego."
"He's hablaing espanol." Lyons
responded, intentionally mispro
nouncing the Spanish word "habla."
Lyons proceeded to say he didn't un
derstand Piniella, and then accused
the manager of stealing his wallet.
FOX could no longer excuse
Lyons and fired him immediately fol
lowing the game. I don't know what's

next for Lyons,but I couldn't care less.
Although I will miss Lyons, his en
tertaining commentary and his pon
cho compliments, I'm glad to see
FOX take some initiative and put
Lyons in his place. His racially
charged comments on Piniella. along
with his remarks about Shawn Green,
are simply inexcusable; this is espe
cially true during a time in which
baseball must cater to a younger, fam
ily-based audience.
Hopefully. Angels broadcaster
Rex Hudler will be next to receive a
pink slip. He may not be a bigot, but
lie's just so damn annoying.
