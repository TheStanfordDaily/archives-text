With season-high attendance at Maloney Field
last weekend, the Stanford women's soccer team
dominated both Arizona State and Arizona.
The sophomore class led the Cardinal to a 3-2
win against the Sun Devils (5-6-2,0-3-0 Pac-10), on
Friday. Sophomore forward Hillary Heath scored
the game-winner in the last 25 minutes, pulling the
Cardinal (8-5-1, 1-1-1) out of a first-half deficit,
while sophomore defender Allison Falk put Stan
ford on the scoreboard in the first half off of a cor
ner kick from sophomore midfielder Lea MacKin
non. It was Falk's first goal of the season.

I have seen us play yet," 1 leath said." We played with
a lot of heart and confidence, and we really showed
we can battle."
ASU responded less than four minutes after
Falk's goal with a free kick when freshman midfield

nal offense had a chance to record another goal with
15 minutes left in the half. MacKinnon connected

In the 37th minute, the Sun Devils scored on an
other opportunity when freshman midfielder Dante
Perea put one past sophomore goalkeeper Alex
