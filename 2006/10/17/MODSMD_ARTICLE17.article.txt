# MEN'S SOCCER
## Men earn split at Pac-10 season midpoint 
### HALEY MURPHY 
With the first half of conference play
solidly behind, the Stanford men's soccer
team laced both Washington and Oregon
State for the second time in two weeks.
After upsetting the Huskies 2-0 last
weekend. Washington got their revenge
at Maloney Field on Friday with a 2-0 vic
tory. ITie Cardinal bounced back with a 2-
0 win over Oregon State on Sunday.
Despite a clean start to its Pac-10
schedule. Stanford's (6-5-3.4-1-1 Pac-10)
streak of wins and ties was halted by
Washington (9-5-0,2-5-0) Friday evening.
Hie game was the Cardinal's first home
loss since Sept. 8, and allowed Cal to claim
the Pac-10 conference lead. The Huskies
clinched the victory thanks to goals by
red-shirt junior forward Kevin Forrest
and sophomore forward Raphael Cox.
In a relatively quiet first half, the first
of Washington's three unsuccessful shots
came from junior forward Ely Allen dur
ing the 13th minute. Tliough Stanford
countered in the opening period with at
tempts by junior forward Dan Shapiro
and junior defender Ryan Oblak, neither
shot found net.
The return of Forrest, who was out on
injury for Washington's previous two

games, proved significant at 51:11 when
he scored the Huskies' first goal with a
header off of Cox's corner kick. Stanford
head coach Bret Simon noted that For
rest's goal was important in giving Wash
ington a mental advantage.
"1 think the key to the game was the
great goal scored by Forrest." Simon said.
"You have to give him credit. It changed
the face of a very even game and forced
us to change our style of play to try to
equalize."
With 10 minutes of play remaining, the
Cardinal tried to make up the deficit
when they maintained possession near
the Huskies' 18-yard box; however. Stan
ford failed to get a shot off. In the 88th
minute. Cox himself found the net after
receiving a pass from Allen. Stanford
quickly made an offensive reply, but
Washington goalie Rylan Hawkins was
able to stop the shot by junior midfielder
F.van Morgan.
Morgan's attempt was the last of Stan
ford's three in the game; the Huskies
posted 10. Freshman goalie John Moore
had four saves compared to Hawkins'
two.
Regardless of the score, Simon was
pleased with the team's perform
ance.
"1 think Washington is one of the
country's best teams," he said. "Split
ting games with them over the last
two weekends is certainly no dis
grace."
On Sunday, the Cardinal played
at home again in a meeting with Ore
gon State (5-9-1.0-7-0). Like Friday,
neither team scored in the first half,
but Stanford came out strong with a
shot on goal by senior midfielder
Galen Thompson in the 11th minute.
Over the course of the first half, the
Cardinal posted two more shots
while the Beavers posted three.
Oregon State senior forward

Robbie Findley had one of three un
successful shots just after halftime,
but Moore countered with his sec
ond of three saves on the game.
At 59:38, Stanford got a free kick
outside the 18-yard box, and Pac-10
Player of the Week Thompson
passed to junior defender Scott
Bolkan. who headed it in for his first
goal of the season. Simon likened
this sequence to the turning point of
the Washington game.
'"'The Oregon State game was de
cided in a similar fashion (to our
game against Washington)," Simon
said. "A pretty even game was wait
ing for an opening goal to force the
issue. This time, we scored the first
goal. After that, Oregon State had to
try to open the game and get the goal
back, and we were able to create a
few more chances."
One such chance came in the 74th
minute when Morgan landed a shot

from the left side off a pass from
Shapiro. The Cardinal dominated
play for the remaining 15 minutes,
securing the victory.
Simon was satisfied with the sea
son's midpoint weekend, and he is
looking forward to the remainder of
conference play.
"We are still enthusiastic and op
timistic about the season," he said.
"Our 4-1-1 record in the Pac-10 puts
us in the hunt for a conference cham
pionship. We'll continue to take one
game at a time. If we take that atti
tude, we'll have a good chance to get
a result in each game."
With this mindset. Simon and the
Cardinal are looking forward to tak
ing on Cal this Friday at Berkeley.
"Both (our) teams have been
strong in conference so far," Simon
said. "It should be a great game, and
we're looking forward to the chal
lenge."
