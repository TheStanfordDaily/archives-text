# BACK FROM THE DEAD
## Mausoleum party returns from five-year absence, President's Fund to pay

If Jane Stanford is rolling in her grave, at
least next Ii iday it will be to the beats of DJ
Osvaldo.
Since the last Mausoleum Party in 2001,
a seemingly endless stream of ASSU presi
dents and undergraduate senators have

made resurrecting the Halloween party an
annual campaign promise, and every year
an unfulfilled one. Last year, party
prospects looked promising, but organizers
ran short on time and money — the event
was axed four years ago when the Stanford
Alumni Association pulled its funding. But
senior and ASSU President Elizabeth lleng
said students should toss away their pencils
and mark their calendars in ink.
"The only thing that can stop it now is
the rain." she said.
Hie President's Fund, President John
Hennessy's discretionary programming
budget, will pick up the tab for the event
this year, which Heng said might reach

slo,ooo.The party, a I lalloween staple
for more than 20 years, will be held on the
grounds of the Stanford family mausoleum,
near the intersection of Palm Drive and
Campus Drive — Marguerite buses will
shuttle students from points around cam
pus to the distant site. And while the Oct. 27
party will feature tight security and sober
monitors sporting fluorescent neon neck
laces, I leng said she hoped the party would
be free of the same intense scrutiny that
marked this year's Band Run and l ull
Moon on the Quad.
At a time when Stanford traditions are
being scaled back — from a sanitized Full
Moon and Band Run to the Bike Ban and

flic Band's sus
pension — students wel

turn. But for a party that has not occurred
since 2001 .it's no surprise that awareness of
the event is limited.
"Urn, I don't even know what Mau
soleum Party is," said sophomore Michelle
Traub. "But if it involves kissing and sen
iors, I'm in."
For most students, the Mausoleum Party
exists only in the oral tradition of alumni
and old newspaper articles lleng said
that most of her knowledge of the event
was cohbled together from past issues of
The Dailv. Students unsure of what to ex

pcct have already begun drawing parallels
tn Stanford's more notorious social pro
gramming.
"It will be like Full Moon but in more of
a party atmosphere "said senior Chris Den
ton. "Less sketchy and more fun."
In keeping with the spirit of Halloween,
I long encouraged students to arrive in cos
tume.
"Trust me, you do not want to come
without ii costume,"she said. "I'm not going
to say why, but just don't."
