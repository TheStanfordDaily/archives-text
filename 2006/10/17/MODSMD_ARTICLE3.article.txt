## MoveOn.org founder fights for mothers Willams draws attention to pay gap, maternity concerns 
### ADAM SOWLATI 
When doting children think of their
mothers, many give flowers, cook dinners,
buy chocolates or send cards. Few think of
politics.
But Joan Williams, co-founder of the lib
eral Web site MoveOn.org, insisted that
moms merit the same political attention that
unions and religious groups do in a speech
last night organized by the Roosevelt Insti
tution.
"This is an attempt to put focus on an
issue that does not get media attention,"
Williams said, arguing that a free market

economy doesn't provide an ideal work
place for mothers.
The free market, she said, does not allow
women to take time off for maternity leave,
creating a need for governmental interven
tion. As part of her presentation, Williams
screened her documentary, "The Mother
hood Manifesto," which chronicles institu
tional bias against women in the corporate
world and single women's limited employ
ment prospects. The film offers several pos
sible remedies, including raising the mini
mum wage, legislating guaranteed paid sick
days and allowing paid maternity or paterni
ty leave for part-time workers.
Like the Web site she co-founded, which
was one of several political action groups
that weighed in heavily on the 2004 presi-

dential election, the documentary
was not without opposition. When
the documentary showed a mother
bottle-feeding an infant, one audi
ence member objected, saying that
breast-feeding should have been de
picted because of its benefits to in
fants.
Williams recently founded the
advocacy group Mom's Rising to in
crease awareness about the struggles
mothers face in society, and she
stressed that aiding mothers is not an
issue of partisan politics.

"We wanted to bring up issues
that cross political lines." Williams
said. "It's going to take a massive
amount of citizen support to get
things to happen. Our best shot is
massive organization of people to
make these changes."
Williams said over 55.000 people
have signed up in support of Mom's
Rising, far short of the three million
members that MoveOn.org boasts.
Williams said she hoped the docu
mentary would spark a public interest
by screening "The Motherhood Man
ifesto" on PBS and in film festivals.
William's also referenced
MoveOn.org in her remarks, saying
that the group is currently lobbying
for digital voting machines that cre
ate paper ballots.
