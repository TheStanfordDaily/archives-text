## Third-year law student to fight environmental case 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Baseball players dream of suiting up for
the World Series. Actors fantasize about
Broadway. For lawyers, arguing before the
Supreme Court is the ultimate aspiration.
Third-year Stanford Law School student
Paul Spitler isn't appearing before the
Supreme Court, but he will be arguing in

front of retired Supreme Court Justice San
dra Day O'Connor in San Francisco's Ninth
Circuit Court tomorrow.
Spitler started his work during a 2(X)5
summer internship at Stanford's Environ
mental Law Clinic under Director Deborah
Sivas and Fellow Molly Gordon. He repre
sents the plaintiffs in the case Friends of
Mope Valley v. U.S. Forest Service, which
centers upon whether the U.S. Forest Service

or Alpine County has the right to manage
Forest Service-owned land in the rural coun
ty just south of Lake Tahoe.The Court's rul
ing could affect thousands of federal lands
throughout the western United States.
Alpine County claims that a provision in
an 1866 mining law gives it jurisdiction over
Forestdale Road, which cuts through the
federal land.The Forest Service granted the
county the right to manage the road, effec

lively cutting the federally-owned land in
two. and setting a precedent that Spitler and
the Stanford Environmental Law Clinic be
lieved they had no choice to challenge with
Friends of I lope Valley
"Why this gets important, aside from the
individual case, is that there's literally thou
sands of these road claims across the western
United States and Alaska," Spitler
said."These include claims in nation
al parks, in wilderness areas, military
reservations; any type of federal land
you can imagine has some of these
road claims. If they were to be vali
dated. you'd have new roads
throughout all our parks and wilder
ness areas.'"
Friends of I lope Valley filed the
original suit in 2000. In 2004, the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern i)is
trict of California issued an opinion
reversing the U.S. Forest Service's
specific management plan for Hope
Valley, but upholding theii jurisdic
tion over the road, prompting the ap
peal to the Circuit Court.
Though not yet a lawyer. Spitler
can argue as a certified law student
because of the courses he has already
taken at Stanford Law School.
Spitler. who earned his bachelor's
degree from UC-Davis, will join two
others with a Stanford connection at
the trial. Justice O'Connor, one of
three judges to rule on the case, re
ceived both her undergraduate eco
nomics degree and law degree from
Stanford. Opposing council Matt
Sanders is also a Stanford Law
School and undergraduate alumnus.
Spitler said he hopes an opinion
will be issued within a year.
