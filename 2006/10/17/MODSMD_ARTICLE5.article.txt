## Scholar offers new insight on Mideast 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
"Please, don't list all of them," Ali Abunimeh
quietly asked during the lengthy introductory list
of his achievements and honors last night.
Abunimeh's discourse. "Ending Apartheid in
the Holy Land: A Future of Reconciliation," cen
tered upon the sensitive topic of similarities be
tween Afrikaaner Mlack ethnic relations in
apartheid South Af rica and Israeli Palestinian re
lations in the current Israel.
The Palestinian Abunimeh began his nearly
two-hour presentation with a quote from his
book. ()ne ( ountry.A Hold New Vision for Israeli-
Palestinian Impasse. I le compared South African
apartheid to the current situation in Israel, sup
porting his most controversial statements with
quotes from scholars, journalists and former
South African President Nelson Mandela. In both
cases, he argued, the established, minority govern
ment presented the majority population a choice
between submission and annihilation, with any
other action inevitably ending in conflict.
"My purpose here is not to argue whether Is
rael is or is not as bad as [the South African
regime], nor to deny the differences between the
two situations, but toconsider a recent experience
where people with fundamentally incompatible
views of history could emerge in peaceful recon
ciliation." Abunimeh said. "Can Israelis and
Palestinians afford not to learn all the lessons that
South Africa holds?"
In the past few years, many former South
African apartheid officials have addressed Israeli
leadership on that note.
Abunimeh is hopeful the situations in
South Africa and Israel exhibit one major
difference. In the case of South Africa, re
form took place only after widespread vio
lence and chaos. Abunimeh claims that the
violence in Israel's reform can be supplant
ed by extensive boycott, disinvestment and
sanction, on both a local and international
level. Abunimeh, who evoked an amal
gamation of all three of Sacha Baron
Cohen's "Da Ali G Show" characters, at
tacked Israel's self-proclaimed right to exist
as a primarily Jewish state. According to
Abunimeh. this is akin to the minority-ma
jority state of Texas declaring that it was a
"European state" and actively expelling mi
norities until it possessed the supermajority
to carry out its right.
A central topic of the night's discussion
was an emerging, alarming trend in Israeli
politics. Abunimeh noted that Israeli par
ties openly supportive of unilateral separa
tion (or wall-building) and Palestinian tran
sit (or deportation) have enjoyed a jump in
the polls and in the Israeli legislature.This
form of "ethnic cleansing," as Abunimeh
put it. is the result of a shift to the extreme
right within the Israeli electorate.
During his presentation, Abunimeh
made a clear attempt to remain objective,
despite his strong beliefs. 1 le expressed em
pathy for Israelis during his examination of
what he called "the illusion of Jewish
democracy."
The primary solution Abunimeh offered
for the rising tension is a unified state in
which Palestinians and Israelis would live
together in an open society of equality. He
struck down the idea of a split state by af
firming the "indivisibility" of the Palestin
ian people and recalling the past separation
disasters in Ireland, Cyprus and South
Africa.
Though the notion of this new nation is
not yet seriously considered on the interna
tional stage. Abunimeh offered eight princi

pies to guide such a country.These included
freedom of religion, universal suffrage, free
enterprise and a transparent state.
"Any one of a number of structures can
fulfill these principles," he said. Pur
thermore, he explained that it is crucial for
the international community to provide
"global civil resistance" through letters to
representatives and discussions about the
future of Israel.
Some audience members vehemently
disagreed with Abunimeh and made them
selves heard in the subsequent question
and-answer session. With a deliberate calm,
he answered questions ranging from clarifi
cation softballs to accusatory fireballs at
tacking the very core of his argument.
Notably, he dismissed the popular rumor
that Palestinian children were taught "the
Jews are our dogs" in school as a fabrica
tion. In reality, he said, Palestinian funicu
lar reform has been the most closely moni
tored in history.
The response to the event was generally
positive, with many audience members
staying afterwards to discuss the issues
raised.
"It was effective; [Abunimeh] was very
well spoken, sophomore Sammy Abusrur
said. "He tried to be as unbiased as possible;
he answered all the questions."
"We had a real sense of frustration,"said
event organizer Omar Shakir, a senior.
"When you talk about Israel-Palestine you
see the same kinds of arguments made on
both sides. When 1 saw Ali speak I was in
spired by his thinking. The perspective he
brought put the conflict in the context of
other historical issues."
The renowned journalist and Middle
East scholar addressed a near-full house in
the Geology Corner of the Quad. 1 lis pres
entation was a joint project of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, the Stanford Bookstore,
the Coalition for Justice in the Middle East,
and the recently founded Students Con
fronting Apartheid in Israel.

Mideast scholar Ali Abunimeh compared the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians to the Afrikaaner-
Black conflict in apartheid South Africa, a position former South African President Nelson Mandela supports.
