## Editorial Board Courses need to be offered regularly 
### 
Now that the add deadline has passed,
most of us have probably finalized
our course selection for this quarter.
While most Ireshmen had the freedom to
pick out whatever course caught their
fancy, many upperclassmen and graduate
students were busy searching for classes to
satisfy their Cil Ks and major require
ments. Unfortunately, the current system
ot course offerings makes it difficult for us
to plan our academic careers because
course offerings can be unpredictable and
erratic.
Hie c lass you wanted to t;ike since fresh
man year is suddenly unavailable; the bul
letin announces that it is "not given this
year." If you were planning to take STS 145:
I listory of Computer Game Design to sat
isfy your Technology in Society require
ment for an engineering major, for exam
ple. you may be surprised to learn that the
course hasn't been offered for the past two
years.
()ther courses, while offered every year,
are shuffled between quarters. FRIiNGEN
181: Philosophy and Literature, a required
course for the philosophy and literature
major track offered in seven diflerent de
partments, was offered in the winter during
2004-2005, shifted to fall last year and is now
back to winter quarter.
Some courses get assigned new course
numbers, while others get assigned new ti
tles. PHI! 122/222, which was Hegel's Phe
nomenology of Spirit last year, is now a
course on flume, while the Hegel course has
been changed to PHIL 130/230. Neither
course is offered this year.
These random changes can confound
even the most diligent among us. Our advi
sors constantly encourage us to prepare a
four-year plan, but in reality, the unpre
dictability of course offerings often makes
planning impossible.Things get even trick
ier if we decide to go abroad, double major,
declare an interdisciplinary major or. heav
en forbid, change majors junior year.
We accept the fact that not everyone will
get to take all the courses they want. Some
students will inevitably be disappointed
some of the time. We also understand that
tenured professors may want some variety

in the courses they teach,and should be free
to adapt their courses to their changing aca
demic interests. Nevertheless, with such a
wide array of classes available, there needs
to be some amount of consistency and pre
dictability in place.
lliis is especially important with classes
that are required for a particular degree
program, including those needed to satisfy
distribution requirements within a major.
Some of these "required electives" are not
offered often enough. The religious studies
department, for instance, requires students
take eight units of introductory level classes
to be chosen from IHUM 68A and B: Ap
proaching Religion and courses within the
department numbered 11-50. With the ex
ception of IHUM. however, only two of the
11 courses listed in the Bulletin that satisfy
this requirement are offered this year. Intro
ductory courses to Hinduism. Buddhism,
Judaism, Christianity and Islam are among
those not offered. The Bulletin gives no in
dication as to when, or if, these courses will
be offered again. As a result,students incor
rectly assume that they have a greater de
gree of choice and flexibility than they actu
ally do.
There are several suggestions that would
improve the situation:
Core classes should be offered consis
tently. TTiey should be taught at least once
every year, preferably always during the
same quarter. Any changes to the schedule
of core offerings should be widely an
nounced through The Daily or department
and student mailing lists.
Courses required lor certain concentra
tions within the major should be offered
with sufficient regularity,at least once every
other year.
Departments could consolidate some of
their scattered course offerings into course
sequences, and commit resources to offer
ing these sequences on a regular basis.
Courses not regularly offered should not
be required for the major or minor. Depart
ments should revise their course require
ments from time to time, removing courses
that are not regularlt offered.

The Bulletin should clearly re
flect all ol these details about course
offerings, and not merely indicate
that some courses are "not given this
year." Some departments already
indicate that certain courses are of
fered in "alternate years," and all de
partments should be encouraged to
follow suit. But the Bulletin could be
even more specific by indicating, for
instance, if certain classes will only
be offered once.
Courses that will never be of
fered again should be removed from
the Bulletin. As a rule of thumb,
courses not offered for two consecu
tive years should be removed.
Courses not offered this year
should still be assigned a member of
the faculty, preferably someone who
taught the course in a previous year.
The professors' names should be
clearly indicated, so students can
contact them to obtain a copy of the
syllabus or to find out when the class
will be offered again.
Students need to take responsi
bility for their academic careers.
Careful planning is required to nav
igate the complex requirements of
any major. However, departments
can do more to facilitate the plan
ning process by ensuring that
courses are offered regularly and
reliably.
