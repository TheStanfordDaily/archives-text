I appear to be misunderstood. Which, in a
way. is a good thing, for it is frequently
thus for geniuses — well, at least for
those who are worthy of book-length biog
raphies. With that in mind, I suppose I could
even interpret the apparent confusion
amongst a small fraction of my audience as
some kind of accolade.
Desperate grasping at dangling threads
of potential fame aside, maybe I should ex
plain what I mean by "misunderstood."
Apparently whilst most people (includ
ing the charmingly irate bunch that posted
comments on The Daily's Website) realized
that the purpose of last week's piece was to
highlight the utterly indisputable fact that all
Stanford undergraduates are so spoiled as to
be de facto royalty,some folks thought I was
making an ever-so-slightly more subtle
point ("Spoiled brats," Oct. 10).
These misguided fellows (and lellettes)
were laboring under the misconception that
what I was trying to say was that the irra
tional prejudices of some graduate students
were, well, irrational.
l or reasons that escape me, some inter
preted the comparisons between under
graduates and the baby Jesus as a deliberate
exaggeration, designed to highlight the ab
surdity of believing that each and every
younger member of our little institution has
led a charmed life.
I suppose,though,it's ultimately my fault.
I misled people by beginning the column
with a discussion of the dangers of prejudice.

I"his canard must have led people astray. I'm
sorry. I really wasn't trying to insinuate any
thing more than my assertions about overly
pampered children.
Ihe idiocy of a religious tolerance that
depends on the religion in question was ob
viously not relevant to the broader point,
and should really not have been mentioned.
As I re-read my work, I find other possi
ble points of potential confusion. By assert
ing the absolute infallibility ofTAs, 1 may
have given the impression that 1 wasn't
being entirely serious — after all. we all
know that infallibility is the purview of
Papal figures, not omniscient graduate stu
dents (we're just never wrong).
I urthennore, after deeper reflection, it
occurs to me that my whimsical observa
tions about the relative "hard graft" re
quired for graduate school could have been
taken in the wrong way (especially the snide
reference to ski trips).
Obviously what I meant to say was that al-
