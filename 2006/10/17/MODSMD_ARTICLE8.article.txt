I appear to be misunderstood. Which, in a
way. is a good thing, for it is frequently
thus for geniuses — well, at least for
those who are worthy of book-length biog
raphies. With that in mind, I suppose I could
even interpret the apparent confusion
amongst a small fraction of my audience as
some kind of accolade.
Desperate grasping at dangling threads
of potential fame aside, maybe I should ex
plain what I mean by "misunderstood."
Apparently whilst most people (includ
ing the charmingly irate bunch that posted
comments on The Daily's Website) realized
that the purpose of last week's piece was to
highlight the utterly indisputable fact that all
Stanford undergraduates are so spoiled as to
be de facto royalty,some folks thought I was
making an ever-so-slightly more subtle
point ("Spoiled brats," Oct. 10).
These misguided fellows (and lellettes)
were laboring under the misconception that
what I was trying to say was that the irra
tional prejudices of some graduate students
were, well, irrational.
l or reasons that escape me, some inter
preted the comparisons between under
graduates and the baby Jesus as a deliberate
exaggeration, designed to highlight the ab
surdity of believing that each and every
younger member of our little institution has
led a charmed life.
I suppose,though,it's ultimately my fault.
I misled people by beginning the column
with a discussion of the dangers of prejudice.

I"his canard must have led people astray. I'm
sorry. I really wasn't trying to insinuate any
thing more than my assertions about overly
pampered children.
Ihe idiocy of a religious tolerance that
depends on the religion in question was ob
viously not relevant to the broader point,
and should really not have been mentioned.
As I re-read my work, I find other possi
ble points of potential confusion. By assert
ing the absolute infallibility ofTAs, 1 may
have given the impression that 1 wasn't
being entirely serious — after all. we all
know that infallibility is the purview of
Papal figures, not omniscient graduate stu
dents (we're just never wrong).
I urthennore, after deeper reflection, it
occurs to me that my whimsical observa
tions about the relative "hard graft" re
quired for graduate school could have been
taken in the wrong way (especially the snide
reference to ski trips).
Obviously what I meant to say was that al-

Sketch
though the graduate student popula
tion almost certainly has a social com
position similar to the undergraduate
one, we're still justified in crying
"spoiled brat" because, well, I say so.
Sarcasm is a terribly dangerous
thing. Likewise, subtlety. And irony.
And indirectness. And all other liter
ary devices. In fact, any attempt to
say anything in any fashion that
doesn't spell things out clearly is
foolish, and possibly lethal. Which is
why I avoid them all, and only write
the Gospel Truth.

1 realize that this particular ap
proach might be considered inap
propriate. Many people (especially
those darned intellectuals) seem to
think that stating things directly is
some kind faux pas,not really appro
priate amongst the academic elite.
Hut you know, I believe in the
"No Spin Zone." If you're going to
say something, say it straight up.
Don't weave around the point, me

and turn between tautologies, lust be
yourself (unless "yourself" is subtle,
in which case be someone else).
The quest for truth is hard
enough without the accidental shad
ing that arises from a lack of clarity
So I'm truly sorry. For all of you that
thought I was mocking prejudice.

that was not my intention.
My apologies extend especially to
those who were insulted by the ap
parent suggestion that it wasn't okay
to think all the kids are spoiled. Of
course it is, and in no way would l,or
any other reasonable person, think
that tarring everyone with the same
proverbial brush was at all inappro
priate or unjustified.
I he aim in last week 's article, as in
this one and everything else I write,
was simply to draw attention to the
absolute, complete, certain inferiori
ty of undergraduates. I hope I've
cleared that up now.

It yon feel the above is insufficient,

a personal prostration and apology.
