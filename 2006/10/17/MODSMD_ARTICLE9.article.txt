## A 						message regarding your junior class presidents 
### LISA GUNN RAHUL KANAKIA 
I opened Sunday's email from Brett
I lammon.one of our junior class presidents,
with a great deal of excitement. Would I hear
about new programming, events, opportuni
ties f< >r juniors, perhaps even a smorgy? I .ast
year, as one of our sophomore class presi
dents, Brett made my inbox a little nest of joy.
I could immediately tell from the subject
line that this wasn't the ordinary bundle of
information delivered with his trademark
wit and brevity. Anil after reading the email.

whieh announced a mid-quarter change in
the roster of junior class presidents, I had to
get up and go check a map. Check a map to
make sure that we weren't living in France
or Mexico or some other piece of Not-
America. You see, I thought we were living
in a democracy,not some two-bit penny-ante
dime-a-dozen banana republic where our
"leaders" disappear during the night with
nothing more than some dictate to register
their passing.
I voted for Ana Shelli Victorino.
She wasn't perfect.but she was mine.
My junior class president. And if the
powers that be somehow deem her
unfit for service, you can replace her
nameplate, but you can't replace her
in my heart.
And as for this "replacement,"
this "Sean Sandoloski," if that is his
real name. I have grave doubts.They
begin with his I'accbook photo. His
eyes are conveniently obscured by
"aviator" sunglasses. What is he hid
ing'.' What lurks behind those dark

curtains? Is it the dead-eyed stare of
a dope fiend? Or the cold, brutal
eyes of a man who has wantonh
killed his own countrywoman!
Abroad. It's such a convenient
term isn't it? It can mean anything
Exile. Perhaps a nice new home,
deep under the sea. I challenge I I
Presidente Brett to tell us a little bit
more about this exile. Where has lie
sent this untiring public servant?
We won't put up with this any
longer. ITiey've been feeding us lies
for the past few years. Why?! Why
would they do this to us! Being a jun
ior class president should be like
playing on a rugby team II one man
goes down, you play a man down.
None of this BS about musical
chairs, never knowing who's in

charge until it's too late. The junior
class presidency has turned from the
pedestal of honor and dignity inhab
ited by Victorino to a dismal, sun
glass-wearing junta!
I urge you. my country people. Do
not wait for their next outrage! Rise
up! Rise up right now. Go to Brett or
email him at bhammon@stanford.edu
and throw a metaphorical brick
through the window that is the cor
rupt and depraved leadership posi
tion he has perverted for so long.
Viva la Revolucion!
