## A
						message regarding your junior class presidents 
### LISA GUNN RAHUL KANAKIA 
I opened Sunday's email from Brett
I lammon.one of our junior class presidents,
with a great deal of excitement. Would I hear
about new programming, events, opportuni
ties f< >r juniors, perhaps even a smorgy? I .ast
year, as one of our sophomore class presi
dents, Brett made my inbox a little nest of joy.
I could immediately tell from the subject
line that this wasn't the ordinary bundle of
information delivered with his trademark
wit and brevity. Anil after reading the email.

whieh announced a mid-quarter change in
the roster of junior class presidents, I had to
get up and go check a map. Check a map to
make sure that we weren't living in France
or Mexico or some other piece of Not-
America. You see, I thought we were living
in a democracy,not some two-bit penny-ante
dime-a-dozen banana republic where our
"leaders" disappear during the night with
nothing more than some dictate to register
their passing.
