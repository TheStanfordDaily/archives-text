# Crock Jams: Volume I

### 
Bike lock. iPod. Beer bong. Cell
phone. Pants. Slow cooker.
That's right: there's a new essential item
for college living. The slow cooker may not
he the sexiest appliance on the market, but
it can enrich your college experience more
than anything else on that list. Except for
maybe pants. And even then, the higher
your slow cooker to pants usage ratio, the
more fun you're going to have.
The slow cooker is nothing more than a
pot that plugs into the wall. It's often re
ferred to as a crock pot, which is actually a
trademark of Rival, the dominant slow
cooker producer. Whatever you call it, it's
designed for gradual cooking at a low tem
perature. The advantages over stovetop
cooking are numerous: whereas a slow
cooker runs $15-$3 O. a stove will set you
back at least $500, and if they find one in
your dorm room, you're screwed. Addi
tionally, the slow cooker requires no super
vision once plugged in. so you can fire it up
in the morning, go to I HUM lecture, hit up
Olives tor lunch, attend PWR class, go to
Taiko practice, grab a smoothie at Jamba
Juice, swing by Humbio study session,
check if any of your friends have changed
their Facebook profiles and still make it
back to your room for a home-cooked
meal.
Some foods are better suited to slow
cooking than others. Do use: meats with a
decent amount of fat (more on this later),
sturdy vegetables like onions and carrots,
dried spices. Don't use: milk or cream,
which will likely curdle; seafood, which will
dry out far too quickly; or fresh herbs,
which will lose their flavor. Foods from the
latter group can still be prepared in a crock
pot if you wait until the end of the cooking
process to add them.
Cuts of meat generally come in a spec
trum from tough and fatty, but flavorful
cuts to tender and lean, but blander cuts.
For slow cooking, the first group works
best.The longcooking time helps to tender
ize the meat, the fat keeps it from drying
out, and its flavor will seep into everything
in the pot. In contrast, meat from the other
group will end up dry and flavorless. Fortu
nately, the first kind of cut tends to be much
cheaper. Examples include pork shoulder,
beef pot roast or generally anything la
beled stew or roast. A lean, tender and very

expensive tenderloin would be totally
wasted here. If you're not sure what to get,
ask your butcher for help.
The slow cooker can work for just about
any recipe that involves cooking in liquid.
Just double the cooking time you would use
on the stovetop. This week's recipe, a
stripped down beef stew, is less about push
ing the limits of the slow cooker than about
showing how easy it is to prepare some
thing pretty tasty in a crock pot.
Bare bones beef slew
2 lbs. stewing beef, cut into roughly 1-
inch cubes
6 red or Yukon Gold potatoes, quar
tered
1 medium yellow onion, roughly
chopped
1 cup baby carrots
1 cup beef stock or water
Salt and pepper, to taste
Serves 4-6
Throw everything in the slow cooker
and cook for four hours on high or eight
hours on low. Taste and add more salt or
pepper if it needs it. Ladle into bowls or
plates and serve.
If you're inclined to kick it up, browning
the beef on the stovetop before putting it in
the slow cooker would add depth of flavor,
lake a skillet or Dutch oven coated with a
little oil. heat it over medium and add the
beef, in batches if necessary, turning until
all sides are richly browned. Another nice
touch would be to stir in chopped parsley,
basil or any other fresh herb right before
serving.

Nate thinks sonic Marvin Gaye, some
Luther Vandross or a little Anita would def
initely set this party off right. Email him at
