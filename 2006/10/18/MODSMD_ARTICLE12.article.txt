# THAT GIRL
## 
### 
Today, I'd like to do a tribute to one of
the arehetypes of college parties —
THAT GIRL.
The party needs a THAT GIRL — some
one who dances on the table even while the
DJ is setting up, who is often mistaken for
"topless too early in the evening girl" — the
girl who carries her emotional baggage in a
well-marked Prada bag which will be rum
maged through later in the night as someone
needs to call her roommate to pick her up be
cause she's begun to stumble like a narcolep
tic dog. The early hours of the party are basi
cally spent by people standing around wait
ing for her or for one of their own to become
her.
The herd is quiet and the silence will only
be broken when the timer hits zero and
THAT GIRL's own wires are cut and frayed
and somebody has done something like piss
her off/arouse her/look at her and boom!
She's out of the door of the girl's bathroom
and onto the middle of the dance floor.There
is a table that needs to be danced on, dammit,
get outta the way. Somehow, there is always a
table at these things.
If alcohol is a social lubricant, by day she
must be drier than Oscar Wilde's corpse be
cause at night she has so much in her that she
has decided to name her breasts "Kendall"
and "Jackson."THAT GIRL's sole nemesis is
furniture, which for some reason chooses to
animate itself like in some kind of trippy Dis
ney movie and attack her. It is always a race
against time to see how many things she can
run into at your house before she passes out.
But I love THAT GIRL. She's the fun al
ternative to TYPE A WOMAN. Type A
woman is going to med school or business
school — that's why she can't bother return
ing your calls. She has the bio-core to deal
with and med school applications and has to
be in the lab all weekend. You're really sweet

though, so she'll call you sometime during her
residency. Ok? Maybe you two can play "doc
tor" together? You'll get undressed and wait
naked for hours and by the time she sees you,
her inexperience socially combined with her
mechanical speed and efficiency will leave
you cold, naked and crouched in a corner like
some sad test subject from the Fruit-Roll-Up
factory. She will not cuddle afterwards.
THAT GIRL, on the other hand, is, well,
fun. She's the fart of the system that has sup
pressed college fun since the PC police first
smoked their cigars over the ashes of John
Belushi.The curtains have been drawn over
nudity and experimentation, and she's the
one who is letting us see a peep of craziness...
err, slightly more than a peep. You can put
your dress back on now. thanks. She's the last
drunken hiccup before the old geezer of col
lege fun is thrown in the casket by the gener
ation that bore it. I'll leave you to debate in
your English class whether it's poetic
tragedy,irony,or both that allowed the gener
ation that really defined college revelry to
then stomp it out of their children.
Maybe when they sobered up and the
smoke cleared, one of them decided that the
ultimate damn the man, the ultimate trip,
would be to become the Man and enforce
hypocrisy on the college student population.
Slipping LSD in our drinks would never have
compared to the trip the entire college popu
lation is enduring now.

Your college's administrators don't want
you naked, so they stopped the streaking
clubs, they canceled naked Olympics and
ruled that the Nudey-Bomb is a weapon of
mass destruction. They don't want you
drunk,so they took away the kegs in the foot
ball stadiums, the allowance of alcohol in
frosh dorms, and made community service in
spectors break up plastic cup politics faster
than you can say "MIP." And,shit, even Willy
Nelson is getting busted for possession.
So I don't mind when THAT GIRL spills
her drink on me when she leans in to tell me
"wheat notgings," (sweet nothings?). Be
cause all we've got now is her.
If we partake in the revelry she promotes,
we run the risk of expulsion or being ostra
cized by our peers, the pop-collared pluto
crats who think that normality is standing
around awkwardly in a dark room asking the
person's major, rank and SAT score.
While THAT GIRL and TYPE A
WOMAN are extremes, too often we have
encountered students who are convinced
that college is simply a step to something bet
ter— they don't stop and smell the Axe
cologne.
People get tight to mask the tightening of
the system. When we wake in the morning,
the hangovers are so loud that we can't hear
the latest change in "safety programming" or
"student life" to "enhance" the college expe
rience. It's hard to hear the sound of the po
litically correct troop boots, but be warned —
next time they won't just be asking to see
what's in that red cup.
In the meantime, I'm going dancing with
THAT GIRL.

Holt's Harangue
Today, I'd like to do a tribute to one of
the arehetypes of college parties —
THAT GIRL.
The party needs a THAT GIRL — some
one who dances on the table even while the
DJ is setting up, who is often mistaken for
"topless too early in the evening girl" — the
girl who carries her emotional baggage in a
well-marked Prada bag which will be rum
maged through later in the night as someone
needs to call her roommate to pick her up be
cause she's begun to stumble like a narcolep
tic dog. The early hours of the party are basi
cally spent by people standing around wait
ing for her or for one of their own to become
her.
The herd is quiet and the silence will only
be broken when the timer hits zero and
THAT GIRL's own wires are cut and frayed
and somebody has done something like piss
her off/arouse her/look at her and boom!
She's out of the door of the girl's bathroom
and onto the middle of the dance floor.There
is a table that needs to be danced on, dammit,
get outta the way. Somehow, there is always a
table at these things.
If alcohol is a social lubricant, by day she
must be drier than Oscar Wilde's corpse be
cause at night she has so much in her that she
has decided to name her breasts "Kendall"
and "Jackson."THAT GIRL's sole nemesis is
furniture, which for some reason chooses to
animate itself like in some kind of trippy Dis
ney movie and attack her. It is always a race
against time to see how many things she can
run into at your house before she passes out.
But I love THAT GIRL. She's the fun al
ternative to TYPE A WOMAN. Type A
woman is going to med school or business
school — that's why she can't bother return
ing your calls. She has the bio-core to deal
with and med school applications and has to
be in the lab all weekend. You're really sweet

though, so she'll call you sometime during her
residency. Ok? Maybe you two can play "doc
tor" together? You'll get undressed and wait
naked for hours and by the time she sees you,
her inexperience socially combined with her
mechanical speed and efficiency will leave
you cold, naked and crouched in a corner like
some sad test subject from the Fruit-Roll-Up
factory. She will not cuddle afterwards.
THAT GIRL, on the other hand, is, well,
fun. She's the fart of the system that has sup
pressed college fun since the PC police first
smoked their cigars over the ashes of John
Belushi.The curtains have been drawn over
nudity and experimentation, and she's the
one who is letting us see a peep of craziness...
err, slightly more than a peep. You can put
your dress back on now. thanks. She's the last
drunken hiccup before the old geezer of col
lege fun is thrown in the casket by the gener
ation that bore it. I'll leave you to debate in
your English class whether it's poetic
tragedy,irony,or both that allowed the gener
ation that really defined college revelry to
then stomp it out of their children.
Maybe when they sobered up and the
smoke cleared, one of them decided that the
ultimate damn the man, the ultimate trip,
would be to become the Man and enforce
hypocrisy on the college student population.
Slipping LSD in our drinks would never have
compared to the trip the entire college popu
lation is enduring now.

Your college's administrators don't want
you naked, so they stopped the streaking
clubs, they canceled naked Olympics and
ruled that the Nudey-Bomb is a weapon of
mass destruction. They don't want you
drunk,so they took away the kegs in the foot
ball stadiums, the allowance of alcohol in
frosh dorms, and made community service in
spectors break up plastic cup politics faster
than you can say "MIP." And,shit, even Willy
Nelson is getting busted for possession.
So I don't mind when THAT GIRL spills
her drink on me when she leans in to tell me
"wheat notgings," (sweet nothings?). Be
cause all we've got now is her.
If we partake in the revelry she promotes,
we run the risk of expulsion or being ostra
cized by our peers, the pop-collared pluto
crats who think that normality is standing
around awkwardly in a dark room asking the
person's major, rank and SAT score.
While THAT GIRL and TYPE A
WOMAN are extremes, too often we have
encountered students who are convinced
that college is simply a step to something bet
ter— they don't stop and smell the Axe
cologne.
People get tight to mask the tightening of
the system. When we wake in the morning,
the hangovers are so loud that we can't hear
the latest change in "safety programming" or
"student life" to "enhance" the college expe
rience. It's hard to hear the sound of the po
litically correct troop boots, but be warned —
next time they won't just be asking to see
what's in that red cup.
In the meantime, I'm going dancing with
THAT GIRL.
