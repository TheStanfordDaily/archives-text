# Letting go of that nerd pride
## 
### 
It seems that everyone has a secret super
power. Your freckly red-headed fresh
man year quadmate turns out to be a
world-renowned ping-pong player. Your
best friend's boyfriend went to the National
Spelling Bee at age twelve and was, in fact,
featured in the documentary "Spellbound."
Your vaguely attractive punky social manag
er had a weekly radio show in his hometown.
And apparently your dorky neighbor from
sophomore year, who worked on problem
sets more than he slept, is in fact one of
America's best flautists. You think back on
your own high-school resume and the only
things that jump to mind are your participa
tion on the high school diving team — the
swim team requiring too much cardiovascu
lar exertion — and your jaunt in the food
service industry at Cowboy Burgers.
Even though there are some us that didn't
perfect an esoteric skill during early-child
hood, we all worked hard in high-school,and
our Type A personalities have at the very
least gotten us here. However, if you take
1,600 Type A personalities a year, put 300 of
them in one class and then put seven of them
in a room for hours at time during weekly
study sessions, what you get is one gigantor

gurgling black pit of nerd pride.
Nerd pride, defined in the Oxford English
Dictionary as "a high or inordinate opinion
of one's own geeky dignity, dweeby impor
tance and wonky merit," abounds on cam
pus. Everyone is taking the Humßio core,
switching into CS 106 X, going pre-med.
When you ask an acquaintance at lunch what
she is up to that day, you ears are barraged
with a onslaught of extra-curriculars — it is
hard to go from the gym to interviews for
Stanford Consulting to tutoring six graders
in East Palo Alto because she has to pack so
many different sets of clothes in the morn
ing. You ask Acquaintance #2 what he is up
to this weekend, and you get hit with an un
expected and sidelong bombardment of
homework — two problem sets, a bio lab at

9am on Saturday,one midterm, two response
papers and a take-home essay test for Mon
day. Acquaintance #1 pipes in that she does
n't think that the problem sets in bio have
been that hard so far. and that hopefully the
midterm will probably be relatively easy.
Please God,' you whisper under your breath
as start to expect the worst.Then #2 narrows
his eyes, grits his teeth and cocks his head;
suddenly a casual explication of weekend
plans has now transformed into fierce pas
sive-aggressive nerd pride one-upmanship.
Hie two competitors are pitted head-to
head in a struggle to the death as they com
pare the difficulty of their classes, their re
spective work loads and the negative
amount of free-time their extra-curricular
packed lives allot them for both.
The nerd pride battle is as common as a
wasted freshman on a Friday night. And I
know 1 have been a competitor on occasion.
How can you let someone else complain
about their workload when you can barely
lind enough time to shower a couple of times
a week, and Webmaster is threatening to
bounce all of your e-mails unless you clean

out your inbox? We seem almost
compelled to share and compare
what we do — even if it so often
seems a self-congratulation of our
ability to juggle it all.
We have nerd pride and we are
nerd proud about it. We get good
grades, we work out, we help the
community. But we rarely disclose
how many hours of studying we
logged to get an TV on the final, or
how we stopped tutoring last quar
ter because we were too overloaded
with school. No one mentions the
C+'s, the incompletes, the dropped

classes or the twelve-unit quarters
that include Beginning Yoga. It is
hard for us to admit defeat,and even
harder for us to talk about it. We
don't want to he the non-deserving
legacy kid or the unfortunate strug
gling student. It seems as if we are
surrounded exclusively by Over
achieving McGraws and Office-
Hour-Going McGees who are un
aware that a 'B' is not just a pollinat
ing insect. And we will do anything
to keep our cover.
But less than a 4.0 GPA isn't em
barrassing. it's a more-than-realistic
actuality. Studying hard doesn't
mean you are stupid, it means you
spend time going over material so
you can remember it. Unashamedly.
1 can tell you that my resume isn't
perfect; 1 don't know what 1 want to

do after 1 graduate and I think
school is hard.
So here's to all of us that don't
have a national ranking, a research
grant, a killer internship, a Rhodes
scholarship or a shot at the
Olympics. Here's to the students
who struggle to get a B.' who try to
go the gym hut all too often end up
watching Netflix-ed movies in their
sweatpants, who study more than
others, who took CS 106 A instead
— we are all trying our best, and if it
is any consolation, I think we might
turn out okay in the end despite it
all.

bunch of pollinating insects in

1 can tell you that my resume isn't
perfect; 1 don't know what 1 want to

do after 1 graduate and I think
school is hard.
So here's to all of us that don't
have a national ranking, a research
grant, a killer internship, a Rhodes
scholarship or a shot at the
Olympics. Here's to the students
who struggle to get a B.' who try to
go the gym hut all too often end up
watching Netflix-ed movies in their
sweatpants, who study more than
others, who took CS 106 A instead
— we are all trying our best, and if it
is any consolation, I think we might
turn out okay in the end despite it
all.

It seems that everyone has a secret super
power. Your freckly red-headed fresh
man year quadmate turns out to be a
world-renowned ping-pong player. Your
best friend's boyfriend went to the National
Spelling Bee at age twelve and was, in fact,
featured in the documentary "Spellbound."
Your vaguely attractive punky social manag
er had a weekly radio show in his hometown.
And apparently your dorky neighbor from
sophomore year, who worked on problem
sets more than he slept, is in fact one of
America's best flautists. You think back on
your own high-school resume and the only
things that jump to mind are your participa
tion on the high school diving team — the
swim team requiring too much cardiovascu
lar exertion — and your jaunt in the food
service industry at Cowboy Burgers.
Even though there are some us that didn't
perfect an esoteric skill during early-child
hood, we all worked hard in high-school,and
our Type A personalities have at the very
least gotten us here. However, if you take
1,600 Type A personalities a year, put 300 of
them in one class and then put seven of them
in a room for hours at time during weekly
study sessions, what you get is one gigantor

gurgling black pit of nerd pride.
Nerd pride, defined in the Oxford English
Dictionary as "a high or inordinate opinion
of one's own geeky dignity, dweeby impor
tance and wonky merit," abounds on cam
pus. Everyone is taking the Humßio core,
switching into CS 106 X, going pre-med.
When you ask an acquaintance at lunch what
she is up to that day, you ears are barraged
with a onslaught of extra-curriculars — it is
hard to go from the gym to interviews for
Stanford Consulting to tutoring six graders
in East Palo Alto because she has to pack so
many different sets of clothes in the morn
ing. You ask Acquaintance #2 what he is up
to this weekend, and you get hit with an un
expected and sidelong bombardment of
homework — two problem sets, a bio lab at

9am on Saturday,one midterm, two response
papers and a take-home essay test for Mon
day. Acquaintance #1 pipes in that she does
n't think that the problem sets in bio have
been that hard so far. and that hopefully the
midterm will probably be relatively easy.
Please God,' you whisper under your breath
as start to expect the worst.Then #2 narrows
his eyes, grits his teeth and cocks his head;
suddenly a casual explication of weekend
plans has now transformed into fierce pas
sive-aggressive nerd pride one-upmanship.
Hie two competitors are pitted head-to
head in a struggle to the death as they com
pare the difficulty of their classes, their re
spective work loads and the negative
amount of free-time their extra-curricular
packed lives allot them for both.
The nerd pride battle is as common as a
wasted freshman on a Friday night. And I
know 1 have been a competitor on occasion.
How can you let someone else complain
about their workload when you can barely
lind enough time to shower a couple of times
a week, and Webmaster is threatening to
bounce all of your e-mails unless you clean

out your inbox? We seem almost
compelled to share and compare
what we do — even if it so often
seems a self-congratulation of our
ability to juggle it all.
We have nerd pride and we are
nerd proud about it. We get good
grades, we work out, we help the
community. But we rarely disclose
how many hours of studying we
logged to get an TV on the final, or
how we stopped tutoring last quar
ter because we were too overloaded
with school. No one mentions the
C+'s, the incompletes, the dropped

classes or the twelve-unit quarters
that include Beginning Yoga. It is
hard for us to admit defeat,and even
harder for us to talk about it. We
don't want to he the non-deserving
legacy kid or the unfortunate strug
gling student. It seems as if we are
surrounded exclusively by Over
achieving McGraws and Office-
Hour-Going McGees who are un
aware that a 'B' is not just a pollinat
ing insect. And we will do anything
to keep our cover.
But less than a 4.0 GPA isn't em
barrassing. it's a more-than-realistic
actuality. Studying hard doesn't
mean you are stupid, it means you
spend time going over material so
you can remember it. Unashamedly.
