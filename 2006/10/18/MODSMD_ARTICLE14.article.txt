In yesterday's Daily, Andrew
Lomeli wrote a column that
acknowledged the loss of
sports announcer Steve Lyons
but ultimately applauded FOX
for firing him due to his alleged
ly racist comments. Readers re
sponded with a barrage of over
30 comments. Here are a few:

I think that you totally missed the point
of Steve Lyons commentary. Lou Piniella
was commenting on the emergence of a
light hitting player and compared that to
finding a wallet. Lyons' comment on the
wallet was saying that he (Lyons) was light
hitting and couldn't find his wallet (He

himself could not hit). A PC move. Also,
Lyons' job is to add humor. As I said. A PC
move.

Once again a commentary based on inac
curacies. Lou Piniella was the one that
brought up the wallet comment. And they
were both speaking "Spanglish".The state
ment about not wanting to sit next to Lou
because he was afraid to get his wallet
stolen is something that that any guy would
have said to his buddy. 1 will agree that his
comments about Shawn Green were over
the line, but this was just a PC tempest in a
teapot.

What a shame that we live in a society
where people will protest the execution of
killers convicted of horrible murders and
call for the heads of others who try and add

a little humor to our daily lives.

Again, the media folds under the pres
sure of the liberal do-gooders. Anybody
watching that game knew there was no
racial tones to Steve's comments. If there
were, I am sure Lou would have called
him to task. As for the other incident with
the video device on the individuals head?
How many people watching that night
knew what that was? Not me. Whatever
happened to the sense of humor that the
American people have been so noted
for? Our soldiers dying in Iraq is some
thing to be concerned about. Steve
Lyons' stab at being funny and entertain
ing is not. Lighten up. Fox — that is what
you hired the guy for. As for Andrew?
Beat on another drum. You are falling on
deaf ears here.

I "his is really nonsense — and a
sorry testament to our hypersensi
tive times. Lou Piniella brought up
the wallet analogy, saying "it is like
finding a wallet with money in it one
day and expecting to find one on
Monday and Tuesday." He was re
ferring to the wisdom of depending
on a #9 hitter to carry your ball club.
He then said that what Frank
Thomas needed was "cold' and
needed to "get hot" using Spanish
words. Brennaman commented on
Lou Piniella's use of Spanish, saying
he was impressed that he could
"habla Espanol." Steve Lyons' com
ments were within the context of the
conversation, were witty and non
offensive to anyone who wasn't
looking to find offense already. His
comment referred to his own igno
rance of Espanol. his own light-hit
ting career and his lack of trust in
"sitting near" Lou Piniella under
those conditions. They were not
racial or ethnic and it is a great injus
tice to fire a man for something like
this.

Fox Network is the one that

should he fired! They have the base
ball contract all locked up so that
they choose if we see the NL game
or the AL game. And then we have
to put up with McGraver and Buck
and they wonder why the ratings are
down? They have every Saturday
during the regular season tied up
just for them, so the team stations
can not broadcast their own games?
Free enterprise in a FREE country?
They fire Steve Lyons who lightens
up the game and was a regular
human being. Steve did play base
ball and knows the game and will be
sadly missed. It is a shame we can
not fire FOX from carrying baseball
games as fast as they fired Steve
over an issue they knew nothing
about.

Gotta love all the comments about
the "liberals" and "left-wing media".
Fox=liberal? Are you kidding me?
Have you ever watched their "news"
(read: propaganda) network? The
"6()'s free-speech radicals"aren't run
ning Fox at any level. Lyons should
not have been fired. Get rid of Cap
tain Obvious McCarver. the annoy
ingly pompous, thinks-he-knows-it
all Morgan, and the "big voice
wannabe" Brenneman.and you're off
to a good start. Lyons and Piniella
were busting balls...nothing more.

Thank God for the comments about
Fox TV stealing from the serious base

ball fan. We pay for Extra Innings at
the rate of $170.00 per year and big
bad MLB and Fox say we can't see our
favorite team. Imagine that thief in
Baltimore (d'Angelo) blocking the
TV game when it is played in Boston
between the O's and the Sox. Satur
day is another matter. No games but
filthy fox.This has got to stop. It's com
munism. As for Lyons. Good luck.

Lyons wasn't that funny, but he
was certainly not making a racial
comment. Piniella is so boring that
he was just livening up the commen
tary so the audience would not fall
asleep. Before labeling the man, you
need to look closer. He is friends
with Green, who still doesn't get
what the fuss is about. Piniella was
laughing at his comments and not in
sulted. He takes pride in his ability
to respect all colors and creeds (his
grandson is bi-racial). It was a
vendetta by one Fox official. Lyons
knows that. Dottie, Lyons best at
tribute is that he is, as you said, "a
regular human being." BTW Roy, it
is not Remy that is rumored to go. It
is Jerry Trupiano. I lope he stays on.

Count me in as a Steve Lyons
supporter. I lis "punishment" was an
overreaction and a real loss to the
game. Steve Lyons is both funny and
informed. It was really "Much Ado
About Nothing."
