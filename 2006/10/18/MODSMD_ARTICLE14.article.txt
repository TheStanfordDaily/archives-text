In yesterday's Daily, Andrew
Lomeli wrote a column that
acknowledged the loss of
sports announcer Steve Lyons
but ultimately applauded FOX
for firing him due to his alleged
ly racist comments. Readers re
sponded with a barrage of over
30 comments. Here are a few:

I think that you totally missed the point
of Steve Lyons commentary. Lou Piniella
was commenting on the emergence of a
light hitting player and compared that to
finding a wallet. Lyons' comment on the
wallet was saying that he (Lyons) was light
hitting and couldn't find his wallet (He

himself could not hit). A PC move. Also,
Lyons' job is to add humor. As I said. A PC
move.

Once again a commentary based on inac
curacies. Lou Piniella was the one that
brought up the wallet comment. And they
were both speaking "Spanglish".The state
ment about not wanting to sit next to Lou
because he was afraid to get his wallet
stolen is something that that any guy would
have said to his buddy. 1 will agree that his
comments about Shawn Green were over
the line, but this was just a PC tempest in a
teapot.

What a shame that we live in a society
where people will protest the execution of
killers convicted of horrible murders and
call for the heads of others who try and add

a little humor to our daily lives.

Again, the media folds under the pres
sure of the liberal do-gooders. Anybody
watching that game knew there was no
racial tones to Steve's comments. If there
were, I am sure Lou would have called
him to task. As for the other incident with
the video device on the individuals head?
How many people watching that night
knew what that was? Not me. Whatever
happened to the sense of humor that the
American people have been so noted
for? Our soldiers dying in Iraq is some
thing to be concerned about. Steve
Lyons' stab at being funny and entertain
ing is not. Lighten up. Fox â€” that is what
you hired the guy for. As for Andrew?
Beat on another drum. You are falling on
