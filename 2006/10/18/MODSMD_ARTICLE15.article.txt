## UNLUCKY 
### BY CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford football team will have to
navigate their final five games without
quarterback Trent Edwards. The se
nior's college career is over due to a broken
foot he sustained in the first quarter of last
week's game against Arizona. The loss sends
the Cardinal (0-7. 0-4 Pac-10) to Arizona
State this weekend with fourth-year junior
T.C. Ostrander as the first-team quarterback.

series against Arizona. Edwards ran out of
the pocket and gained four yards before
going down. He did not return to the game.

being treated on the sideline by medical staff
before going to the locker room and return
ing on crutches. The Cardinal went on to lose
20-7 and set a dubious school record for
fewest offensive yards in a game (52).
In a press conference yesterday, Edwards
said was "proud to have played quarterback
at Stanford." Asked to describe his career, he
called it "a rollercoaster" — a fitting analogy

for a career spanning two head coaches, four
offensive coordinators, and numerous in
juries.
Asked if he thought there was a reason for
his troubles, Edwards demurred, but did say
that his religious faith had helped him cope
with disappointment.
Despite his playing career at Stanford
being over, Edwards pledged to "do every-

One more blow to reeling Cardinal: oil-injured quart* i bad Trent Johnson's senior
season cut short by broken foot, junior TC Ostrander will!inish tl te season under center

thing I can to help our other quarterbacks
out."
He did not detail his future involvement
in practice or film sessions, hut did say he
would "absolutely" be attending the Arizona
State game, regardless of whether he travels
with the team or on his own. Pac-10 con
ference rules limit the number of players that
can travel to road games.

"lie epitomizes what a Stanford football
player should hej Head coach and Edwards'
position coach Walt Harris said. "I believe he
lias a bright future both in the game of foot
ball and beyond."
Edwards is the sixth offensive starter or
contributor to miss significant time with in
jury this season. 1 le is the third to be declared
out for most or all of the season, joining cen
ter Hm Mattran (leg stress fracture, has not
played this season), receiver Mark Bradford
(foot injury against San Jose State) and full
back Nick Frank (congenital vertebral defect
that forced his retirement from football).

A 2002 graduate of Los Gatos
I ligh School in Los Gatos, Calif., Ed
wards led a powerhouse offense that
helped the Wildcats to a 26-0 two
year record and two Central Coast
Section championships. In high
school, he passed for 5,064 yards and
58 touchdowns and also set the Cali
fornia state record for completion
percentage (78.1 %) his junior season.
Edwards was among the top
rated quarterbacks in the 2002 re
cruiting season and grew up attend
ing Stanford games with his family.
He has been frequently noted by
media and fans for his competitive
nature, leadership, charisma, class.

unselfishness, positive attitude and
faithfulness to the Cardinal football
program.
Edwards' statistical ledger is
equally impressive, especially at a
school with a quarterback tradition
going back to the 19705. After red
shirting in 2002, he started 31 games
in three and a half seasons on the
Farm. He is in the top ten in several
career categories, including sixth in
completions and pass attempts (487
for 865). seventh in passing yardage
(5429), total offense (5628) and
touchdown passes (36), and tenth in
completion percentage (56.3%).
Edwards' size (6'4", 232 lb),
strength and athleticism have long
made him an interest of NFL scouts,
and he was projected by some to be
this year's Jay Culter, the nationally
unknown Vanderbilt quarterback
who rocketed into the first round of

last spring's NFL Draft after a strong
senior season.
New starter T.C. Ostrander has
significant experience, starting two
games in 2004 and playing in four in
2005 after a series of injuries to Ed
wards.
"1 always try to prepare as if I'm
the starter," Ostrander said.
The Atherton, Calif.-native antic
ipated more practice reps but no
other significant changes to his
weekly routine. Ostrander was 8-for
-13 for 58 yards against Arizona in re
lief of Edwards. He had to be helped
off the field after taking a hit on the
Cardinal's final offensive play, but
said he felt much better on TUesday.
Redshirt freshman Tavita
Pritchard. who has been working
with the wide receivers recently, will
