## Card ready for three-game Virginia trip Results this weekend will determine postseason seeding 
### BY ANNA PARLIN 
The Stanford field hockey team will finish
its regular-season play this week with a tour
through Virginia, facing the University of Vir
ginia, Longwood and Radford.
This season has been filled with narrow de
feats for the Cardinal (6-8. 3-1 North Pacific
Athletic Conference), including two games
that went into overtime. Six of the team s
eight losses have been determined by only a
single goal. The Cardinal did not play a Nor-
Pac opponent until its tenth game of 2006,and
six of the team's losses came in those non
conference matches.
"We have played a very tough schedule this
year," head coach Lesley Irvine said." Iliis has
helped prepare us for our conference oppo
nents."
In its past two games, the field hockey
team defeated Davidson 4-1 and Appalachi
an State 5-1, both NorPac opponents.The de
fense's aggressive and effective play enabled
Stanford to walk away with the two easy vic
tories and earned several ('ardinal players re
cent NorPac honors.
The attack has also done its part to keep
the team winning by increasing the linal shot
total, keeping the ball at the opponent s goal
circle and increasing the frequency of offen
sive penalty corners.
But after playing two of the cellar-dwellers
in the NorPac, the players will have their work

cut out for them during this East-Coast stint.
On Friday, Stanford will take on Virginia,
ranked sixth in the NCAA with a record of
10-4 overall and 6-1 in the South Regional.
According to Irvine, playing the Cavaliers will
be an "excellent opportunity" for her team.
Following the UVA game, the Cardinal
will face two conference opponents, starting
with Longwood (4-9. 1-1). The Lancers are
coming off of a five-game losing streak.

The Cardinal will finish oft its regular sea
son with a game against Radford (4-11. 1-2).
The Highlanders have lost their past six
games, three of which went into overtime.
These last two games are key for Stanford,
because they will determine the Cardinal's
placement in the upcoming NorPac Champi
onships.
"It is critical we take care of our confer
ence games in Virginia so we set ourselves up

as one of the top two seeds in our conference
tournament ;it the end of the month." Irvine
said.
Should the Longwood and Radford games
go ;is hoped. Stanford will end the regular sea
son with a 5-1 NorPac record and enter the
championships seeded in first or second
place.
Regardless. Stanford's first game of the
conference tournament will take place Nov. 2.
