## Time for a change for Redskins 
### 
Once again the kings of the off
season have proven to be the
goats of the regular season.
Six weeks into the 2006-07 NFL sea
son, the Washington Redskins stand
at an embarrassing 2-4 all alone in
the NFC East cellar and with an in
creasingly dim shot at the playoffs.
After a loss to the previously win
less Titans last week, every Washing
ton sports fan is asking the same
question: When are the Redskins,
with their fleet-footed receivers and
legendary coaching staff, going to
turn it around? The answer: Never.
That, of course, is a harsh word,
but the reasons for the Redskins'
chronic undcrachievement are too
deep-rooted for any other outcome.
Take, for instance, this year, when the
Redskins paid top dollar to bring in
slot receiver and punt returner
Antwaan Randle El. Or their signing
of 29-year-old Shawn Springs to a
six-year, $30 million contract with a
$10 million signing bonus in 2004.
And the one that takes the cake: the
2004 signing of then 34-year-old
quarterback Mark Brunell to a
seven-year. $43 million deal with an
$8.6 million signing bonus.
If the problem isn't obvious yet,
the attitude of the Redskins front of
fice is the exact opposite of what is
