## Time for a change for Redskins 
### 
Once again the kings of the off
season have proven to be the
goats of the regular season.
Six weeks into the 2006-07 NFL sea
son, the Washington Redskins stand
at an embarrassing 2-4 all alone in
the NFC East cellar and with an in
creasingly dim shot at the playoffs.
After a loss to the previously win
less Titans last week, every Washing
ton sports fan is asking the same
question: When are the Redskins,
with their fleet-footed receivers and
legendary coaching staff, going to
turn it around? The answer: Never.
That, of course, is a harsh word,
but the reasons for the Redskins'
chronic undcrachievement are too
deep-rooted for any other outcome.
Take, for instance, this year, when the
Redskins paid top dollar to bring in
slot receiver and punt returner
Antwaan Randle El. Or their signing
of 29-year-old Shawn Springs to a
six-year, $30 million contract with a
$10 million signing bonus in 2004.
And the one that takes the cake: the
2004 signing of then 34-year-old
quarterback Mark Brunell to a
seven-year. $43 million deal with an
$8.6 million signing bonus.
If the problem isn't obvious yet,
the attitude of the Redskins front of
fice is the exact opposite of what is
necessary to win. Rather than till their team s needs
through the draft, the Redskins have feebly tried to
plug all their off-season holes with free agent acqui
sitions. The result? Huge, expensive contracts for an
overpaid role player who can contribute only in very
select situations, a cornerback who has clearly lost a
step since his heyday and a quarterback who would
have been a great team leader, about six or eight
years ago.
The Red .kins need to take a page out of the book
of some of today's successful NFL franchises. The Pa
triots, for example, are the second most frugal team
in the NFL this year, yet they have a record of 4-1.
New England has managed to be a competitive team
for several years now with a simple philosophy: in
stall a system that works, find and cultivate super
stars through the draft and plug holes with high
value, but often low name-recognition, free agents.
The Redskins have to realize why every David
Patten or Brandon Lloyd that they sign to a big free
agent contract was not retained by his old team.
Aside from the cases where the salary cap forces a
change, teams like the Patriots let these players go
because they are too old, demand too much pay for
their talent or are simply overrated. So as long as the
Redskins keep their eyes on the free agent talent
pool rather than the draft board in a search for super
stars, the culture of underachievement in Washing
ton will go on.
This is not to say that the Redskins haven't made
a few good moves over the past several seasons.
Bringing Clinton Portis into the nation's capital laid
the foundation for a strong running game for years.
Draft picks LaVar Arrington, Champ Bailey and
Sean Taylor have all become legitimate NFL stars.
The only problem is that, of the three, only Taylor re
mains on the Redskins roster.
With all this said, perhaps Redskins owner
Daniel Snyder really does have the right blueprint
for success in place. Although he's managed to over
see only two playoff wins in his tenure so far, Sny
der's Redskins are currently the most lucrative NFL
franchise, as well as the most profitable sports fran
chise in all 01 U.S. sports. By adding new and exciting
names to the roster each year, Snyder has managed
to keep the Redskins' faithful filling the stadium and
hoping that maybe this year the Skins' record will
match the names on the back of the burgundy and
gold jerseys.
If the measuring stick of success for an NFL fran
chise is revenue, then the Redskins have a flawless
structure. But if success is measured in wins and loss
es, it's about time the higher-ups in the Redskins
front office make some major off-season philosophy
changes. And for the sake of Washington sports fans,
1 sincerely hope it's the latter.
