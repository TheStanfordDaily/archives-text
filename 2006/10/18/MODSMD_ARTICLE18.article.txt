## Cardinal impress in Blue and White Arianna Lambie leads women, Neftalem Araia paces men NCAA tune-up meet 
### SCOTT BLAND 
Stanford's men's and women's cross-country teams proved them
selves worthy of their lofty national rankings at the Pre-NCAA Invita
tional in Terre 1 laute, Ind., on Saturday.
The top-ranked women's team blew away the competition on their
way to first place in the Blue Race, heating out 35 other schools includ
ing eighth-ranked Pac-10 rival Arizona State.The fifth-ranked men fin
ished in second place in their White Race, coming in just behind No. 3
lona.
Junior Arianna Lambie led the way for the women's team by finish
ing second overall in the Blue Race with a time of 20:20, only four sec
onds behind the individual winner, Michelle Sikes of Wake Forest.
After third place was captured by a BYU runner, junior Teresa McWal
ters and senior Amanda Trotter came in fourth and fifth with times of
20:24 and 20:28. respectively, and senior Katy Trotter secured the
eighth-place spot (20:32). giving the Cardinal four of the top eight run
ners in the field. These high finishes propelled the team to a 45-point
total, a full 155 points lower than the second-place squad. No. 6 Min
nesota.
Team members said that put a lot of distance between themselves
and their opponents in the final standings was their top-to-bottom
strength.
"I'm especially excited at how deep our team has proven to be this
year," said Lambie, "Every runner is improving herself and pushing
everyone else forward."
The men's second-place result was powered by junior Neftalem
Araia, who placed fourth overall with a time of 23:30. Sophomore Gar
rett Heath came in eighteenth (24:00), senior Brett Gotcher finished
nineteenth (24:02) and sophomore Hari Mix secured the twenty-eighth
spot (24:09). but it was not quite enough for the Cardinal.They finished
with 106 points as a team, agonizingly close to first-place lona's 100. In
third place. No. 10 Florida finished far behind the top two with 217
points.
Both squads said they were pleased with such good races against an
elite field at the Pre-NCAAs. In particular, the women's commanding
performance shows that the Cardinal is prepared to defend its nation
al championship. This weekend's meet took place on the same course
where the NCAA Championships will be run in November, and Stan
ford's dominant showing is certainly a sign of strength.
"We took advantage of the Pre-NCAAs to feel out the champi
onship course, experience quality competition and see how the
strength of our team could work together." Lambie said. "Even if the
results had not been as great as they were, the experience would still
have been valuable. With such a positive outcome, though, our team is
confident in its abilities and even more motivated to keep the momen
tum going."
The Cardinal will next compete when the men and the women de
fend their Pac-10 titles on their home course on Saturday, October 28.
