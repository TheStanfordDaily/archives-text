## State politics are sexy too, says Senator California legislator shares career lessons 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"When you talk about politics in
California, you're talking sexy" Cali
fornia State Senator Jackie Speier said
last night, aiming to persuade students
that a state legislator, particularly in
California,can pass a great deal of im
portant policy.
Speier said she jumped at the op
portunity to speak to Stanford stu
dents. She spoke about the ways in
which politics can be successfully em
ployed to get policy through, using ex
amples from her 18 years of experi
ence in the California State Senate to
elucidate her assertions.
Speier, who finished second in the
Democratic primary for lieutenant
governor in June, spoke at Stanford as
the first of three speakers for a class
entitled "Creating and Analyzing
Public Policy: The Roosevelt Institu
tion." Guest lecturers in coming weeks
will include U.S. Congresswoman Zoe
Lofgren and California State Con
troller Steve Westly.


State Senator Jackie Speier
Junior Eric Mitzenmacher, presi
dent of the Roosevelt Institution and
lead teaching assistant for the class,
introduced Speier by emphasizing
the importance of state legislation.
"State-level politics are often
overlooked by students, because
they're not as sexy as federal poli
tics," he said. "But they are really
quite imperative to spur the balance
towards innovation, and that has
been Speier's path for the past few
terms."
The senator opened her speech
with examples of how California has
taken the lead on a number of impor
tant issues and continued by outlin
ing a number of premises she felt
were indicative of successful policy.
First,Speier discussed the value of
incrementalism, a tactic she used to
pass a bill on health insurance.
"You can move very sound public
policy by moving a portion of it and
then expanding on it." she said.
She also emphasized the impor
tance of perseverance in public pol
icy.
"You have to be willing to stick
with a bill, reintroduce it. until it gets
through," Speier said. She cited the
examples of a financial privacy bill
she introduced that passed after four
attempts and another that took three
years.
Speier then explained the impor
tance of research in forming good
policy. A hotly contested bill about
requiring proof of auto insurance at
the time of registration was success
fully passed because Speier was able
to show substantial savings for tax

payers if the bill became law.
Speier added that sometimes,
though, it takes a bit of serendipity to
pass a bill. At one point, said Speier,
she had been unsuccessful for three
years in passing a bill allowing birth
control pills to be covered by pre
scription drug plans. However, in the
fourth year, when the drug Viagra,
which was more expensive, was in
troduced and instantly covered by
prescription drug plans, the bill was
finally signed into law.
Another way to help pass public
policy is through the successful use of
the media, which can be helpful to
spotlight specific issues. She advocat
ed and spoke of successfully drawing
on real people, rather than lobbyists,
to make one's case.
For example, a bill she introduced
to create an organ donor registry in
California was successful because
Speier brought forward stories of
people who had lost loved ones or re
ceived organ donations.
"The stories were pretty com
pelling and effective at moving the
legislation forward," she said.
Speier also emphasized the neces
sity for legislators to identify relevant
issues, adding that senators are elect
ed to identify issues that are impor
tant to the public.
The senator's final point focused
on the need to understand the mem
bers of committees. She said that
votes often don't come from mem
bers of her own party, so she has to
find alliances with members of oppo
site parties.
After her 18 years on the state leg

islature, Speier cannot run again due
to limits.
"I'm at a crossroads now," she
said. "I'm not quite sure what I'm
going to do next."
Looking toward the future,Speier
encouraged students to get involved
in public policy and public service,
saying she found her work sustaining
and fulfilling.
"There's a difference between
knowing that something you did
helped raise stock figures a couple
points and knowing that you've just
passed a law that will help 36 million
people," she said. "There's just no
comparison."
Mitzenmacher said that Speier
was an innovative and visionary leg
islator in addition to being a wonder
ful speaker.
"Policy research is what these
students are here for." Mitzenmach
er said. "We could bring plenty of
politicians here who could talk
about battles over bills, but I think
she makes a fairly unique perspec
tive in that she approaches the en
tire policy process from a very simi
lar stance as a student. She sits
down, she reads, she has that bit of
inspiration, she goes to work on it.
and I think that's how students want
to interact with the policy process as
well."
Sophomore Julia Guth said she
found Speier's speech inspiring.
"I'm definitely more interested in
researching more about what exactly
state senators and assemblymen do,"
she said. "[I am] even considering a
career in politics or in public policy."
