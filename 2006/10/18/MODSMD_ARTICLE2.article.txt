## State politics are sexy too, says Senator California legislator shares career lessons 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"When you talk about politics in
California, you're talking sexy" Cali
fornia State Senator Jackie Speier said
last night, aiming to persuade students
that a state legislator, particularly in
California,can pass a great deal of im
portant policy.
Speier said she jumped at the op
portunity to speak to Stanford stu
dents. She spoke about the ways in
which politics can be successfully em
ployed to get policy through, using ex
amples from her 18 years of experi
ence in the California State Senate to
elucidate her assertions.
Speier, who finished second in the
Democratic primary for lieutenant
governor in June, spoke at Stanford as
the first of three speakers for a class
entitled "Creating and Analyzing
Public Policy: The Roosevelt Institu
tion." Guest lecturers in coming weeks
will include U.S. Congresswoman Zoe
Lofgren and California State Con
troller Steve Westly.
