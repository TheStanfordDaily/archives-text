The Stanford men's golf team came
off the course yesterday in La Quinta,
Calif., satisfied with their great perform
ance, taking both the team and individual
titles over No. 6 UCLA and UC-lrvine at
The Prestige.
The team fared well individually, with
three of its five players finishing the tour
nament in the top 10. The No. 7 Cardinal
held off UCLA by two strokes and fin
ished ten strokes over Irvine.
Senior Zack Miller captured the indi -
vidual win for Stanford, shooting an
overall score of 207 (nine under par), just
three strokes in front of Irvine's Jay
Choe and the Bruins' Lucas Lee. In yes
terday's final round, he finished with a
three-under 69. He started off slow in the
front nine, shooting three over par. but
went on to birdie six of the last nine holes
to claim the top spot.
"Zack Miller continued to play well in
a strong field." said head coach Conrad
Ray. "His back nine was great."
Next in the ranks for Stanford, was
freshman Joseph Bramlett, who tied for
seventh with 212 overall strokes, four
under par, after finishing with a four
under 68. He birdied four of the back
nine holes to earn himself a solid overall
score.

Finishing one stroke behind Bramlett
was senior Matt Savage, who posted a
score of 213. He started the tournament
in good form, sitting in fourth place after
the first day. Unfortunately it slipped
away from him in the final round, as he
scored 72 (even par) to earn a share of
the tenth-place spot.
Junior Rob Grube, who boasted the
team's second-best average score enter
ing the tournament, started out a little
slow, but pulled himself together in the
third round, scoring a one-under-par 71.
Grube finished with 219 (three over par)
overall in the tournament, putting him in
23rd place.
Rounding out the Cardinal scorers
yesterday was junior Daniel Lim. who
scored 223 (seven over par) overall and
posted a round three score of 73 (one
over par) yesterday.
Though sophomore Dodge Kemmer
did not contribute to the overall team
score, he scored 233 for the tournament,
good for 31st.
Overall the Stanford men scored a 15-
under-par 849, with a third-round score
of 280 (eight under par).
"The guys are really proud of their
second win," Coach Ray said. "The team
worked really hard for this one. Iliere
were lots of positives about today."
On Monday and Tuesday of next
week, the Cardinal will head to Bandon,
Ore., to face off with the top Pac-10
teams in the Pac-10 Challenge.
"Everyone is really excited for next
week, though it is going to be tough,"
Coach Ray said. "Oregon has a good
course, and we will be meeting the top
teams in the conference."
