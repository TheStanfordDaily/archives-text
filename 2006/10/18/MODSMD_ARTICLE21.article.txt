## 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
Arizona State 21, No. 3 USC 28
The Trojans needed a Chauncey Washing
ton touchdown with 4:29 remaining to escape
an upset for the third consecutive week.
USC blew a 21-0 first-half lead, but Ari
zona State quarterback Rudy Carpenter and
the Sun Devils offense couldn't complete the
upset, faillNG to move the ball on their final
drive after Washington's go-ahead score.
Down bv three touchdowns. Carpenter led
the Sun Devils to a pair of offensive scores,
but it was the defense that tied the score.Trail
ing 21-14 with 3:18 left to go in the third quar

ter, Keno Walter- White stepped in front of an
underthrown pass from John David Booty in
tended for Dwayne Jarrett and returned it 37
yards for a touchdown.
But Arizona State never managed to take
the lead. Booty led the Trojans on a 14-play,
74-yard drive that culminated in the Washing
ton touchdown run to give USC their 30th
victory in a row at the LA Coliseum.
Dwayne Jarrett hauled in his 33rd career
touchdown reception in the opening minutes
of the second quarter. Hie score moved Jar
rett into sole possession of first alltime in ca
reer touchdown receptions in Pac-10 history.
Hie loss was the third consecutive Pac-10
defeat to open the conference schedule for

Arizona State (3-3,0-3 Pac-10) â€” all against
ranked opponents.
USC (6-0, 4-0) has won each of its last
three games by one score. They are off this
week, before heading to Corvallis to face
Oregon State.
No. 10 California 21, Washington State 3
On a day when Cal's normally dominant
offense failed to blow the Cougars away, the
defense stepped up to give the Bears their
sixth consecutive victory and first at Martin
Stadium since 1979.
Tailback Marshawn Lynch led the offen
sive charge, rushing for 152 yards and two
touchdowns. But the defense really sealed the
Cal victory, holding Washington State to just
88 yards of offense on the ground and inter
cepting the Cougars twice. In three trips into
the red zone, the Cougars came away with just
one field goal and turned the ball over on
downs twice.
Washington State quarterback Alex Brink
did find some success, throwing for 227 yards
with one interception, but star wide receiver
Jason Hill was held to 23 yards on just two re
ceptions.
Cal quarterback Nate Longshore failed to
pass for a touchdown, but he did run one in
with 3:22 left in the third quarter to give the
Bears a 14-0 lead.
Cal (6-1, 4-0) returns to Berkeley to face
Washington this week, while Washington State
(4-3, 2-2) faces Oregon at home. The game
marked the third time this season that the
Cougars faced a team ranked in the top-10.
UCLA 20, No. 18 Oregon 30
A week after being humiliated against Cal,
Oregon rebounded behind strong efforts
from quarterback Dennis Dixon and tailback
Jonathan Stewart to get back on a winning
path.
The Ducks scored three first-quarter
touchdowns, and led by at least ten points the
rest of the way. Dixon got Oregon on the
board early with nn 11 -yard touchdown strike
to Dante Roario just three minutes into the
game. The Oregon signal-caller finished 10-
of-17 passing with 144 yards and two touch
downs.
Stewart also got back on track after strug
gling mightily against Cal last weekend. The
junior rushed for 121 yards on 20 carries, a
huge improvement over his 25 yards on 18 at
tempts against the Bears.
The Bruins ni;ide the game competitive
with a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown runs
from running back Kahlil Bell. UCLA was
forced to play without their starting quarter
back, Ben Olson, who could miss up to six
weeks with an injured knee. Patrick Cowan
started in his stead and finished 16-of-31 pass
ing with 112 yards and an interception.
Oregon (5-1,3-1) will play their next three
games against unranked opponents, including
Division 1-AA Portland State, before travel
ing to USC for a showdown on Nov. 11.
UCLA (4-2, 2-2) will head to South Bend,
Ind. for a matchup with No. 10 Notre Dame,
next weekend.
