# NEWS BRIEF
## ASSU ADDRESSES ABUSE AND NEW MASTER'S PROGRAM 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate recounted the story of seniors
Bharat Venkat and Vinni Intersi
mone last night, two gay undergrad
uates who were verbally abused by a
group of three non-Stanford stu
dents earlier this month while walk
ing on Mayfield Ave.
Junior Laura Mesa addressed the
Senate and encouraged the body to
issue a statement condemning the at
tack.
"We cannot be at the mercy of the
outside community," she said.
A Senate statement was particu
larly important, she argued, because
the only publicity about the crime
was a column — written by the vic
tims themselves— in the Oct. 12
issue of The Daily.
The Advocacy Committee will
meet Friday to discuss a possible re
sponse to the attack.
The other main item of business
was junior and Senate Chair Her
shey Avula's report that the Faculty
Senate has approved the Universi
ty's plan to start granting master's
degrees in African and African-
American Studies.
