# Lecture honors Daniel Pearl
## CNN Correspondent recalls legacy of journalist and alum 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
In a lecture notable for its candor and criti
cal edge, CNN Chief International Correspon
dent Christiane Amanpour offered a forceful
defense of journalism last night at Kresge Au
ditorium.

"I believe strongly that in this uncertain
world our profession has a particular and im
portant role and a particular and important
place in our societies and our democracies,"
Amanpour said. "Without robust journalists,
we as a society are weaker because we can't
tell the stories that we absolutely must be able
to tell."
Amanpour was the keynote speaker for the
inaugural Daniel Pearl Memorial Lecture, a
program sponsored by the Office of the Presi
dent. the Office for Religious Life, the Center
for Jewish Life, the Daniel Pearl Foundation
and the ASSU Speakers Bureau. Pearl, a 1985

Stanford graduate and a reporter for The Wall
Street Journal, was kidnapped and killed by a
Pakistani militant group in 2002. Iliis year's
lecture was the first in what is to become an
annual lecture series honoring Pearl's dedica
tion to the improvement of the human condi
tion through journalism, music and innovative
communication.
Hie lecture is part of a series of Pearl com
memorations. Last week featured the pre
miere of the HBO documentary "The Journal
ist and the Jihadi: The Murder of Daniel
Pearl," and the recognition of October 6-15 as
the Daniel Pearl World Music Days.

Prior to Amanpour's address. Pearl's for
mer classmate Howard Kaplan introduced
Ruth and Judea Pearl, who each honored their
son and thanked Amanpour for coming to
Stanford.
"By honoring Danny.she honors a commu
nity of dedicated reporters who risk their lives
so we can see reality from a different and new
prism of truth and on a new level of under
standing," Judea Pearl said. "[Amanpour]
honors the culture of modernity and open
mindedness that this university symbolizes.

from which Danny absorbed his cu
riosity and love of humanity."
"People like Christiane keep us
going and keep us from the tempta
tion of retirement," deadpanned
Ruth Pearl."We are grateful to Stan
ford for honoring our son in so many
ways." Amanpour, in turn,
thanked the Pearls for providing a
source of inspiration.
"The Pearl family has heroically
tried, and succeeded, in trying to turn
the violence in that period of hatred
into something that is optimistic,
hopeful, and something that can
bring understanding and promote
tolerance," she said. "I am so glad to
be here today, and I'm really pleased
that you've organized this annual
lecture, and very proud to be the first
one to be able to do it."
Speaking without notes to a
standing-room-only audience,
Amanpour offered insights, not only
from her experience as a prolific for
eign correspondent, but also as a crit
ic of her own industry and a first
hand observer of world conflicts. Her
subject matter ranged from dimin
ishing international support for the
War on Terror to her view that jour
nalism has become too heavily be
holden to profits and. consequently,
too trivial.
"The age that we are in right now
is the age of serious, but what we are
given is about the most banal and
frivolous diet you can imagine," she
said."l don't know where it's coming
from, or why the networks are ped
dling this kind of frivolity when we
desperately need to get to the bot
tom of these matters.
According to Amanpour, the
most important stories going untold
are those that inform the American
public about the culture clash that
dominates the international arena
— stories that convey facts that are
not manipulated for political utility.
"I've seen wholesale cuts in for
eign bureaus, wholesale retreat from
foreign news coverage," she said. "It
could not come at a worse time, with
the world so tense, with policy being
so heavily politicized that it is so dif
ficult even to figure out where is the
truth."
Amanpour did not shy away from
a stern appraisal of the American po
litical establishment. The strongest
criticism she extended was the fail
ure of the United States government
to take advantage of the internation
al coalition that formed after the
September 11 attacks, or of the high
regard in which members of the in
ternational community hold the U.S.
"[After September 111, people in
the most unlikely corners of the
world and in the most unlikely coun
tries lit candles, said prayers and sent
support." she said. "It is truly heart
breaking to go around the world and

see that, by and large, that coalition
of cooperation, genuine shock and
outrage doesn't exist anymore.
Something happened in the last five
years that has turned the world
against this great country whose val
ues are the best in the world —
whose democracy, whose economy,
whose morals, whose education are
sought in every corner of the world
— and that's not an exaggeration,
even in countries where you might
think people are hostile to the U.S.
Something has gone wrong."
Amanpour, however, did not

blame the war in Iraq for the failure
of the international coalition in the
War on Terror. Rather, she argued, it
was the lack of a coalition-presence
in the rebuilding process, along with
the US government's reluctance to
face reports of civil disorder in Iraq,
that sapped foreign support and de
creased the United States' credibili
ty
"I was there when Baghdad fell,
and people were happy.people want
ed to make this future work. But they
were never given a chance," she said.
"When we reported looting,we were

told that journalists were exaggerat
ing. When we reported that there was
a major insurgency growing, we were
told that we were too pessimistic."
"Five years later. |members of the
insurgency] are killing Americans,
and killing the American dream, and
killing the dreams of people in that
whole part of the world."
Amanpour also noted the failure
of the U.S. to act with appropriate
moral rigor.
"It is unbelievable that in this
country we are having debates about
torture and secret prisons," she said.

"Things like Abu Gharaib and
Guantanamo Bay have deeply af
fected the moral authority of this
country and have deeply compro
mised it."
Amanpour was not entirely pes
simistic. Ilie most important part of
Middle Eastern policy, she argued, is
to engage the numerous foreign citi
zens attracted to the opportunities
and philosophy of the United States.
"Everywhere 1 go in the world,
whether it is Afghanistan or with the
Palestinians, people want to come to
this country," she said. "They want to
come here to learn about this coun
try, to get the opportunities that you
have. These are the people that we
need to be pulling back into the fold,
and 1 don't think it's very hard to do
that. It may take many years, but 1
don't think it's a lost cause. But for
the moment there's such division
that's been created and such an in
credible politicization of policy that
the way out is a little confused."
In keeping with "Journalism and
the World," the lecture's title. Aman
pour noted the key role journalists
play in facilitating cooperation in the
world and conveying to internation
al audiences accurate facts that are
independent of political agendas.
Paraphrasing Samuel Johnson,
Amanpour said that journalism "is
the last refuge of the rascal."
"It is our duty to be free and inde
pendent." she emphasized to raptur
ous applause. "That is what this
country's constitution gave this
country's press — a duty given by no
other constitution in the world. Since
September 11. there has been a ten
dency by the powers that be that if
stories are reported that don't fit the
political vision, then it's the re
porter's problem — the reporters
are unpatriotic, the reporters are
comforting the terrorists."
"But we have a duty to say no, to
say no. because if we don't say no,
and if we don't expose it and stand
up against it. then our whole profes
sion is compromised."
Amanpour's optimism was based
on her vision that journalists, dedi
cated to the pursuit of truth, could
help remedy the missteps of the sta
tus quo.
"I truly believe that this profes
sion still is one of the unique profes
sions in the world," she said."We can
go out there, we can tell the story, we
can be your eyes and ears and we can
be an important part of civil society.
When we have the resources and we
are committed to telling the story
fully, I strongly believe that we can
make a difference and that we can
make a difference for the better."
"And that is what motivates me
and what motivated Danny Pearl."
said Amanpour. drawing her lecture
back to the journalist in whose
honor she had taken the podium.
"Each conflict we cover gets more
and more dangerous,yet we become
more and more determined to go
out and stay there and tell more sto
ries."

could not come at a worse time, with
the world so tense, with policy being
so heavily politicized that it is so dif
ficult even to figure out where is the
truth."
Amanpour did not shy away from
a stern appraisal of the American po
litical establishment. The strongest
criticism she extended was the fail
ure of the United States government
to take advantage of the internation
al coalition that formed after the
September 11 attacks, or of the high
regard in which members of the in
ternational community hold the U.S.
"[After September 111, people in
the most unlikely corners of the
world and in the most unlikely coun
tries lit candles, said prayers and sent
support." she said. "It is truly heart
breaking to go around the world and

see that, by and large, that coalition
of cooperation, genuine shock and
outrage doesn't exist anymore.
Something happened in the last five
years that has turned the world
against this great country whose val
ues are the best in the world —
whose democracy, whose economy,
whose morals, whose education are
sought in every corner of the world
— and that's not an exaggeration,
even in countries where you might
think people are hostile to the U.S.
Something has gone wrong."
Amanpour, however, did not

blame the war in Iraq for the failure
of the international coalition in the
War on Terror. Rather, she argued, it
was the lack of a coalition-presence
in the rebuilding process, along with
the US government's reluctance to
face reports of civil disorder in Iraq,
that sapped foreign support and de
creased the United States' credibili
ty
"I was there when Baghdad fell,
and people were happy.people want
ed to make this future work. But they
were never given a chance," she said.
"When we reported looting,we were

told that journalists were exaggerat
ing. When we reported that there was
a major insurgency growing, we were
told that we were too pessimistic."
"Five years later. |members of the
insurgency] are killing Americans,
and killing the American dream, and
killing the dreams of people in that
whole part of the world."
Amanpour also noted the failure
of the U.S. to act with appropriate
moral rigor.
"It is unbelievable that in this
country we are having debates about
torture and secret prisons," she said.

"Things like Abu Gharaib and
Guantanamo Bay have deeply af
fected the moral authority of this
country and have deeply compro
mised it."
Amanpour was not entirely pes
simistic. Ilie most important part of
Middle Eastern policy, she argued, is
to engage the numerous foreign citi
zens attracted to the opportunities
and philosophy of the United States.
"Everywhere 1 go in the world,
whether it is Afghanistan or with the
Palestinians, people want to come to
this country," she said. "They want to
come here to learn about this coun
try, to get the opportunities that you
have. These are the people that we
need to be pulling back into the fold,
and 1 don't think it's very hard to do
that. It may take many years, but 1
don't think it's a lost cause. But for
the moment there's such division
that's been created and such an in
credible politicization of policy that
the way out is a little confused."
In keeping with "Journalism and
the World," the lecture's title. Aman
pour noted the key role journalists
play in facilitating cooperation in the
world and conveying to internation
al audiences accurate facts that are
independent of political agendas.
Paraphrasing Samuel Johnson,
Amanpour said that journalism "is
the last refuge of the rascal."
"It is our duty to be free and inde
pendent." she emphasized to raptur
ous applause. "That is what this
country's constitution gave this
country's press — a duty given by no
other constitution in the world. Since
September 11. there has been a ten
dency by the powers that be that if
stories are reported that don't fit the
political vision, then it's the re
porter's problem — the reporters
are unpatriotic, the reporters are
comforting the terrorists."
"But we have a duty to say no, to
say no. because if we don't say no,
and if we don't expose it and stand
up against it. then our whole profes
sion is compromised."
Amanpour's optimism was based
on her vision that journalists, dedi
cated to the pursuit of truth, could
help remedy the missteps of the sta
tus quo.
"I truly believe that this profes
sion still is one of the unique profes
sions in the world," she said."We can
go out there, we can tell the story, we
can be your eyes and ears and we can
be an important part of civil society.
When we have the resources and we
are committed to telling the story
fully, I strongly believe that we can
make a difference and that we can
make a difference for the better."
"And that is what motivates me
and what motivated Danny Pearl."
said Amanpour. drawing her lecture
back to the journalist in whose
honor she had taken the podium.
"Each conflict we cover gets more
and more dangerous,yet we become
more and more determined to go
out and stay there and tell more sto
ries."

Christiane Amanpour speaks of journalism and politics in honor of slain journalist Daniel Pearl's life.
In a lecture notable for its candor and criti
cal edge, CNN Chief International Correspon
dent Christiane Amanpour offered a forceful
defense of journalism last night at Kresge Au
ditorium.

"I believe strongly that in this uncertain
world our profession has a particular and im
portant role and a particular and important
place in our societies and our democracies,"
Amanpour said. "Without robust journalists,
we as a society are weaker because we can't
tell the stories that we absolutely must be able
to tell."
Amanpour was the keynote speaker for the
inaugural Daniel Pearl Memorial Lecture, a
program sponsored by the Office of the Presi
dent. the Office for Religious Life, the Center
for Jewish Life, the Daniel Pearl Foundation
and the ASSU Speakers Bureau. Pearl, a 1985

Stanford graduate and a reporter for The Wall
Street Journal, was kidnapped and killed by a
Pakistani militant group in 2002. Iliis year's
lecture was the first in what is to become an
annual lecture series honoring Pearl's dedica
tion to the improvement of the human condi
tion through journalism, music and innovative
communication.
Hie lecture is part of a series of Pearl com
memorations. Last week featured the pre
miere of the HBO documentary "The Journal
ist and the Jihadi: The Murder of Daniel
Pearl," and the recognition of October 6-15 as
the Daniel Pearl World Music Days.

Prior to Amanpour's address. Pearl's for
mer classmate Howard Kaplan introduced
Ruth and Judea Pearl, who each honored their
son and thanked Amanpour for coming to
Stanford.
"By honoring Danny.she honors a commu
nity of dedicated reporters who risk their lives
so we can see reality from a different and new
prism of truth and on a new level of under
standing," Judea Pearl said. "[Amanpour]
honors the culture of modernity and open
mindedness that this university symbolizes.

from which Danny absorbed his cu
riosity and love of humanity."
"People like Christiane keep us
going and keep us from the tempta
tion of retirement," deadpanned
Ruth Pearl."We are grateful to Stan
ford for honoring our son in so many
ways." Amanpour, in turn,
thanked the Pearls for providing a
source of inspiration.
"The Pearl family has heroically
tried, and succeeded, in trying to turn
the violence in that period of hatred
into something that is optimistic,
hopeful, and something that can
bring understanding and promote
tolerance," she said. "I am so glad to
be here today, and I'm really pleased
that you've organized this annual
lecture, and very proud to be the first
one to be able to do it."
Speaking without notes to a
standing-room-only audience,
Amanpour offered insights, not only
from her experience as a prolific for
eign correspondent, but also as a crit
ic of her own industry and a first
hand observer of world conflicts. Her
subject matter ranged from dimin
ishing international support for the
War on Terror to her view that jour
nalism has become too heavily be
holden to profits and. consequently,
too trivial.
"The age that we are in right now
is the age of serious, but what we are
given is about the most banal and
frivolous diet you can imagine," she
said."l don't know where it's coming
from, or why the networks are ped
dling this kind of frivolity when we
desperately need to get to the bot
tom of these matters.
According to Amanpour, the
most important stories going untold
are those that inform the American
public about the culture clash that
dominates the international arena
— stories that convey facts that are
not manipulated for political utility.
"I've seen wholesale cuts in for
eign bureaus, wholesale retreat from
foreign news coverage," she said. "It
could not come at a worse time, with
the world so tense, with policy being
so heavily politicized that it is so dif
ficult even to figure out where is the
truth."

country's press — a duty given by no
other constitution in the world. Since
September 11. there has been a ten
dency by the powers that be that if
stories are reported that don't fit the
political vision, then it's the re
porter's problem — the reporters
are unpatriotic, the reporters are
comforting the terrorists."
"But we have a duty to say no, to
say no. because if we don't say no,
and if we don't expose it and stand
up against it. then our whole profes
sion is compromised."
Amanpour's optimism was based
on her vision that journalists, dedi
cated to the pursuit of truth, could
help remedy the missteps of the sta
tus quo.
"I truly believe that this profes
sion still is one of the unique profes
sions in the world," she said."We can
go out there, we can tell the story, we
can be your eyes and ears and we can
be an important part of civil society.
When we have the resources and we
are committed to telling the story
fully, I strongly believe that we can
make a difference and that we can
make a difference for the better."
"And that is what motivates me
and what motivated Danny Pearl."
said Amanpour. drawing her lecture
back to the journalist in whose
honor she had taken the podium.
"Each conflict we cover gets more
and more dangerous,yet we become
more and more determined to go
out and stay there and tell more sto
ries."
