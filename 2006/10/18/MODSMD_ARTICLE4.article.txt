In a lecture notable for its candor and criti
cal edge, CNN Chief International Correspon
dent Christiane Amanpour offered a forceful
defense of journalism last night at Kresge Au
ditorium.

"I believe strongly that in this uncertain
world our profession has a particular and im
portant role and a particular and important
place in our societies and our democracies,"
Amanpour said. "Without robust journalists,
we as a society are weaker because we can't
tell the stories that we absolutely must be able
to tell."
Amanpour was the keynote speaker for the
inaugural Daniel Pearl Memorial Lecture, a
program sponsored by the Office of the Presi
dent. the Office for Religious Life, the Center
for Jewish Life, the Daniel Pearl Foundation
and the ASSU Speakers Bureau. Pearl, a 1985

Stanford graduate and a reporter for The Wall
Street Journal, was kidnapped and killed by a
Pakistani militant group in 2002. Iliis year's
lecture was the first in what is to become an
annual lecture series honoring Pearl's dedica
tion to the improvement of the human condi
tion through journalism, music and innovative
communication.
Hie lecture is part of a series of Pearl com
memorations. Last week featured the pre
miere of the HBO documentary "The Journal
ist and the Jihadi: The Murder of Daniel
Pearl," and the recognition of October 6-15 as
the Daniel Pearl World Music Days.

Prior to Amanpour's address. Pearl's for
mer classmate Howard Kaplan introduced
Ruth and Judea Pearl, who each honored their
son and thanked Amanpour for coming to
Stanford.
"By honoring Danny.she honors a commu
nity of dedicated reporters who risk their lives
so we can see reality from a different and new
prism of truth and on a new level of under
standing," Judea Pearl said. "[Amanpour]
honors the culture of modernity and open
mindedness that this university symbolizes.
