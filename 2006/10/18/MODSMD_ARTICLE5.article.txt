## Comedy Night brings standup to Stanford 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to the newly formed Stanford Com-
edy Club, fans of stand-up comedy no longer 1
need to camp out by the Intersection of Death to
get their daily endorphin fix.
"History is being made," said club president
Melahn Parker, a graduate student in aeronautics
and astronautics. "This small event will grow to put
Stanford on the map of comedy."
Beginning last January, Comedy Night at the 750
Pub has been bringing Bay Area comedians to Stan
ford for free shows. While undergraduates may not
know about the weekly event, graduate students reg
ularly pack the bar on Tuesdays to watch lineups of
local talent live and uncensored. They can even step
up to the mic themselves.
"To me, stand-up comedy remains one of the
greatest performing arts, with an essentially ancient
history," Parker said. "I started this because I wanted
to bring comedy to campus. It seemed more conven
ient to bring the comics here, than to try and go off
campus to see them in the real comedy clubs where
you have expensive covers, and have to deal with
other less convenient things like driving, parking and
food and drink minimums."
Because of the "uncensored" aspect, however.
Comedy Night has faced more than its share of strug
gles since its inception.
In February. Comedy Night was almost shut down
when a student's complaint about a feature comedian's

"grossly

off en -
sive" politically incorrect jokes led the Graduate Stu
dent Programming Board to pull its funding.
The 750 Pub, however, kept Comedy Night afloat
while Parker sought alternate financial avenues.
"If you offend one person, that doesn't mean the
whole program should be suspended." said 750
owner Giuseppe Carrubba."People have fun,but it's
not a G-rated show. Can you imagine if the comedi
ans were censored?"
