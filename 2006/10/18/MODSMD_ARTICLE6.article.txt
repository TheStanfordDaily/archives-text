## Photographers finally join forces on campus New club provides students with photo opportunities 
### LIA HARDIN 
Hie road to hell is paved with good
intentions and failed photography
clubs, says an unofficial maxim that the
new Stanford Photography club hopes
to change.
"The goal is to increase the quality
of the photo community at Stanford,"
said co-founder Nick Kelley, a gradu
ate student in biophysics, of the latest
in a long line of attempts to form a vi
able organization for students on The
Farm interested in photography.
The group's 16 charter members
held their first general meeting last
night in the photography classroom in
the basement of the Thomas Welton
Art Gallery, and the initial awkward si
lence gradually gave way to quiet an
ticipation as Kelley informed the
group that it would have darkroom ac
cess, a "top of the line" Epson photo
printer and possibly even a fall quarter
photography show.
Hut Stanford Photography may not
want to look to past Cardinal shutter

bugs for inspiration. Junior Dan Ack
erman-Greenberg, administrator of
Stanford's photography interest group
on Facebook, is one of several who
have tried and failed to arouse campus
interest.
"I started the Facebook group with
the intention of creating some kind of
on-campus photo club, but it just never
materialized ," he said in an email to
TTie Daily.
And recent photography groups
that have managed to form officially
have not been "very visible or active,"
said Nanci 11 owe. director of the Office
of Student Activities.
Although photography is a com
mon interest among Stanford students,
the community has thus far remained
diffuse.
"People are creative," Kelley said,
adding that Stanford Photography has
the potential for success.
Kelley maintained that his group
will not suffer from the organizational
problems that have plagued others. He
said that with the help of the Art De
partment's photography instructors
and Craig Weiss, the photo lab manag-
er. his club will give off a more pro
fessional vibe. Perhaps most impor
tantly, Stanford Photography has al
ready managed to secure financial
support from The Stanford Fund.
The demand for darkroom ac
cess and equipment appears to be
one of many factors motivating stu-

dents to join the group. Freshman
James Hegarty said that he was ex
cited about access to the group's re
sources but was also happy about
"finding a group of people interest
ed in talking about photography"
that could critique photos.
Junior Erica McLain, a studio
arts major, said that although she al
ready has darkroom access, she
wanted access to galleries "to get
work up and out there," a goal
shared by many of the other group
members.

Kelley emphasized at the meet
ing that his goal is not to detraet
from the photography classes run by
the Art Department. He warned
that one of the quickest ways to lose
the Art Department's support
would he to compete with the estab
lished introductory photography
courses.
The group will meet again in two
weeks and will begin organizing a
photo show that will run for three
weeks in the subgallery adjacent to
the photography labs.
