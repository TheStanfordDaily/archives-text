## NEWS ANALYSIS Democrats Optimistic about Prospects Minority since 1994 set to take House, Senate outcome unclear but changes appear likely 
### ERIC SHOWEN 
With less than three weeks remaining until
Election Day, Democrats appear poised to
take control of the I louse of Representatives
for the first time since 1994.
Recent polls have indicated significant
leads opening up for Democratic candidates
in ke\ House races. A Washington Post-ABC
News poll released last week found that 54
percent ol registered voters plan to vote for
the Democratic candidate in their district,
while 41 percent prefer the Republican candi
date. Onlv 31 percent of those polled held a
favorable view of Congress's performance.
Such statistical indicators of overwhelming
voter discontent serve to illustrate the long
odds facing Republicans this election cycle, ac
knowledged in private by even the most opti
mistic GOP strategists. With Republican loss
es virtually assured, party leaders have adopt
ed a defensive strategy designed to curtail loss
es. By focusing resources on a handful of care
fully selected toss-up races. Republicans hope
to preserve a thin majority in the 1 louse.
Democrats must pick up 15 additional
seats to seize control of Congress's lower
chamber, with approximately 50 of 435 races
considered competitive.
The future balance of power in the Senate
remains shrouded in uncertainty, with De
mocrats' chances for a takeover thought to be
slimmer than in the 1 louse. The current com
position of the Senate with 55 Republicans. 44
Democrats and one left-leaning independent
requires Democrats gain six of 33 up-tor
grabs Senate seats to ensure a change of

power.
With Democrats primed to usurp seats cur
rently held by Republicans in Montana, Penn
sylvania, Ohio and Rhode Island, national
GOP party leaders are pouring resources into
tightly contested races in Missouri. Tennessee
and Virginia. GOP failure to hold two of these
three seats would likely create a Democratic
majority.
No Senate seats currently held by Democ
rats are expected to fall into Republican victo
ries, although Republican gains are possible in
New Jersey and Maryland.
I"he fallout surrounding former Rep. Mark
Foley's illicit correspondence with underage
Congressional pages has been a primary fac
tor plaguing GOP candidates' election
prospects in recent weeks.
While Republican strategists have sought
to portray the Foley scandal as an isolated
event with little bearing on the national elec
tions, prominent Democrats have charged
that House Republican leaders, including
Speaker Dennis Hastert, failed to respond
properly to early accounts of Foley's conduct.
Only 27 percent of those surveyed in a New
York Times poll approved of Republican
leaders' handling of the Foley scandal, and 54
percent of respondents deemed the contro
versy surrounding Foley to be of "very seri
ous" consequence to the nation.
"1 have been surprised by the ramifications
of the Foley scandal." said Political Science
Prof. Simon Jackman. "It seems to be the
straw that broke the camel's back."
The Foley scandal is by no means the only
cause for Republicans' woes, as discontent

over the war in Iraq, setbacks in the war on
terror, and the economy weigh heavily on vot
ers' minds.
Approval of the Iraq war reached an all
time low this week, with 34 percent of Ameri
cans in support and percent opposed.
Many experts anticipate that voter anger over
President Bush's policies will adversely affect
Republican candidates at all levels.
"This is a national election," Jackman said.
'ITie effect on voters of North Korea's det
onation of a nuclear device last week remains
to be seen. National security has traditionally
been a Republican strong point, yet North
Korea's demonstration of nuclear capability
"certainly hasn't helped" Republicans' elec
tion prospects, according to Jackman.
Despite the favorable electoral conditions
for Democratic candidates, members of both
parties have cautioned against jumping the
gun. Republicans still maintain a sizable cash
advantage over Democratic rivals, and the
OOP's legendary get-out-the-vote operation
could prove to be the X-factor preserving Re
publican majorities.
If Democrats succeed in asserting a major
ity in one or both houses, many pundits expect
the new Congress to be paralyzed by inaction
and partisan discord. A Democratic takeover
could portend a continuous string of investiga
tions into Bush Administration policies on
warrantless surveillance, the Iraq war. impris
onment of enemy combatants at Guantanamo
Bay and even the Administration's response
to Hurricane Katrina.
"I! Democrats take the House," Jackman
said, "watch for fireworks."
