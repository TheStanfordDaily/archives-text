## Editorial Board Economics department institues new requirements, alienates students 
### 
Mention of Human Biology's
"core." and its four-day-a-week
9AM lectures, may elicit moans
from the overloaded sophomores of
Toy on and Manzanita. But even if you're
not up for the core, but are interested in
related topics, you can still take "Critical
Issues in International Women's Health"
or other intermediate-level, applied
courses. This is true as well in other social
science majors — there are minimal or no
prerequisites in the Psychology Depart
ment it you want to learn about "Cogni
tive Development" or take "The Psychol
ogy of Gender." What if you're feeling
globally-minded and want to take a fling
at "International Economics"? Should be
easy, right?
Not so fast. For "International Eco
nomies." students from the class of 2010
and beyond must take Econ 1A and 18.
Math 51. and Econ 50,51 and 52 to regis
ter for that class on Axess. Other eco
nomics classes, such as "Political Eco
nomics" and "Money and Banking." have
similarly stringent requirements, some
thing also common in math-heavy majors
like physics. And while people may asso
ciate economics with other fuchie sub
jects like political science or psychology,
it is becoming more and more math-ori
ented, which to some degree explains this
policy.
Still, the growing network of prerequi
sites for economics classes is troubling for
two reasons. The Economics Core has
grown to encompass seven classes total
ing 35 units— Econ IA, 18. 50. 51. 52.
102 A, 1028 — along with the required
Math 51. This almost guarantees that un
less freshmen load up on courses, majors
will not be able to take many specific 100-
level courses (like, say. "Technology and
Economic Change") until junior year,
after having to take eight required cours
es in their first six quarters at Stanford.
Students with a strong affinity for math
might appreciate strengthened and highly
structured core that constitutes about
half of the major's required units (80 at
last count). But the long, daunting string

of classes with weekly problem sets runs
the risk of alienating students that are less
interested in Cobb-Douglass functions
than economics' overall ideas, strengths
and weaknesses.
Furthermore, the growing mathemati
cization of economics has ramifications in
the real world. Economics has contribu
tions to offer many of the topics relevant
or under frequent debate at the Farm
things like the merits of minimum wage
and unions, to how best to promote tech
nological innovation. By isolating itself
from the rest of the social sciences.it risks
turning off anyone who isn't majoring in
economics or political science from tak
ing its classes and encountering the eco
nomic way of thinking.
There is a trade-off here: economics is
a combination of mathematics and eco
nomic theory, and for better or for worse,
the Economics Department has chosen to
weight its introductory courses heavily
towards the mathematics side. And the
Economics Department certainly has rea
son to institute a rigorous and structured
"core" similar to Human Biology or Bio
logical Sciences. It is important that stu
dents have a solid understanding of eco
nomics that the economics core can pro
vide. But the Economics Department
should keep supply and demand in mind.
As price increases, quantity demanded
falls.The more requirements they add, the
fewer students will take their classes.
Moreover, it is possible for them to up
hold the rigor of the economics major
while allowing increased flexibility. For
example, allowing minors or non-majors
to substitute AP Econ and AF Stats as
prerequisites for the essentially equiva
lent Econ IA/1B and 102 A will encour
age them to take higher-level classes
without sitting through material they al
ready know.
Although we see the advantage in
making the economics major more rigor
ous. there should be increased accommo
dation for those who are interested in the
subject but do not want to be unfairly sub
jected to the new requirements.
