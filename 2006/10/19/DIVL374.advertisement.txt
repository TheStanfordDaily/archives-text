There's a lot to know about qualifying for the Earned Income Tax

have children, they must meet three qualifying tests. And that's 1.800.TAX.1040
i just to name a few. But the most important thing to know is you can
get help figuring it all out. Visit us on the web. call 1-800-TAX-1040
or ask your tax preparer. When it comes to getting help claiming Internal Revenue Service
everything you honestly deserve, consider it done. v/sM" www -' rs gov/eitc
