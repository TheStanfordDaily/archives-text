They 're all dead!
It you are one of those observant people
who has noticed the abnormally large
number of dead squirrels recently, con
gratulations. because that's what this col
umn's about. If you don't believe me. I have
the independent confirmation of one other
person not on behavior-altering substances
(I've had confirmation from several others
in such states, but I've heard such testi
monies don't usually hold up in court), so
this is obviously a statistically significant
trend.
Who cares? Well, for starters, this means
we're all going to die (and in the meantime,
it's important to know how to run around
White Plaza screaming in German about
everyone being dead). Hie squirrels go first,
then all of those higher mammals that we so
carefully keep for their cuteness factor (i.e.
puppies), then cute little kids and finally less
cute older people. According to my room
mate, these deaths are occurring because the
Cold War between the black squirrels and
the grey squirrels has finally warmed up.
turning into an all-out war.The black squir
rels are winning, seeing as I've only seen two
of them dead and five dead grey ones.
However, the truth could be scarier. In
stead of waiting for this war to spread up
ward toward larger and larger animals with
decreasing amounts of cuteness. it might be
that the bird flu jumped to squirrels. Given
one change, it could easily jump species
again. The mammals fall in order of decreas
ing cuteness, because the cuter you are. the

less resistant you are to disease. Cuteness is
a hu m of protection (albeit indirect) in itself

things with weaker immune systems (like
babies) possess it in order to draw sympathy
from less cute beings, who will offer im
mune supporting supplies, like breast milk
or a bubble to live in.
I lie final option (and evidence points to
tliis as the most likely) is that man-induced
climate change has taken its hold on the
Stanford campus. Iliat the adorable suffer
most at the hands of this human experiment
is widely evidenced. Inuit mothers can no
longer breast feed their infants, for exam
ple. because so many poisons have hopped
<>n the global winds and ended up in the
Arctic. ITie bodies of adults there contain
huge slews ot poisons and.consequently, the
milk they produce is extremely toxic. Grant
ed. even down here our bodies contain
enough toxins that we wouldn't meet the
standards for pork in the U.S.
Hut back to the squirrels. We must act be
fore we lose the cuties that add so much
(like practice dodging animals while in fast
moving vehicles) to our campus! But if

that's not enough to stir you to ac
tion. the fate of squirrels and drunk
enness are inextricably bound â€”
even Napa Valley's warming up. and
the wine growers there have begun
having to alter their growing meth
ods and stock in order to remain pro
ductive. It's likely that before this
current century is up,it will simply be
impossible to continue producing

wine there. Shoot. I had hoped to
find a scarier statistic than that. No
body cares about the end of the cen
tury, because everyone alive now will
be dead by then. Small wonder no
body ever does anything; why should
we care? It's our children's problem.
Or I could just be an alarmist like
any other. 1 ley, at least I gave you two
alternate options, which is more than
most do.'l here are always alternate ex
planations for every piece of evidence
for this global warming conspiracy. For
example, has anyone ever bothered to
mention that we might just be coming
out of the Little Ice Age? I didn't think

so. But see. I just did.
There have been mass squirrel
deaths before. Go to Google and
type in "Stanford dead squirrels."
The first article to pop up is a Daily
column about a previous epidemic
("Avenge the death of Fluffy." Feb.
23. 2004). We're not all dead yet. so
maybe this isn't anything to worry
about after all.

Kate, surprisingly enough, actually
does believe in global wanning, as well
as evolution. If you'd like to help
