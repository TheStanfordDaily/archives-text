They 're all dead!
It you are one of those observant people
who has noticed the abnormally large
number of dead squirrels recently, con
gratulations. because that's what this col
umn's about. If you don't believe me. I have
the independent confirmation of one other
person not on behavior-altering substances
(I've had confirmation from several others
in such states, but I've heard such testi
monies don't usually hold up in court), so
this is obviously a statistically significant
trend.
Who cares? Well, for starters, this means
we're all going to die (and in the meantime,
it's important to know how to run around
White Plaza screaming in German about
everyone being dead). Hie squirrels go first,
then all of those higher mammals that we so
carefully keep for their cuteness factor (i.e.
puppies), then cute little kids and finally less
cute older people. According to my room
mate, these deaths are occurring because the
Cold War between the black squirrels and
the grey squirrels has finally warmed up.
turning into an all-out war.The black squir
rels are winning, seeing as I've only seen two
of them dead and five dead grey ones.
However, the truth could be scarier. In
stead of waiting for this war to spread up
ward toward larger and larger animals with
decreasing amounts of cuteness. it might be
that the bird flu jumped to squirrels. Given
one change, it could easily jump species
again. The mammals fall in order of decreas
ing cuteness, because the cuter you are. the

less resistant you are to disease. Cuteness is
a hu m of protection (albeit indirect) in itself

things with weaker immune systems (like
babies) possess it in order to draw sympathy
from less cute beings, who will offer im
mune supporting supplies, like breast milk
or a bubble to live in.
I lie final option (and evidence points to
tliis as the most likely) is that man-induced
climate change has taken its hold on the
Stanford campus. Iliat the adorable suffer
most at the hands of this human experiment
is widely evidenced. Inuit mothers can no
longer breast feed their infants, for exam
ple. because so many poisons have hopped
<>n the global winds and ended up in the
Arctic. ITie bodies of adults there contain
huge slews ot poisons and.consequently, the
milk they produce is extremely toxic. Grant
ed. even down here our bodies contain
enough toxins that we wouldn't meet the
standards for pork in the U.S.
Hut back to the squirrels. We must act be
fore we lose the cuties that add so much
(like practice dodging animals while in fast
moving vehicles) to our campus! But if
