Editorial presents misleading infor
mation on Religious Studies
Tuesday's editorial ("Courses need to he
offered regularly") reports that Religious
Studies requires its majors to "take eight
units of introductory-level classes to be cho
sen from IHIJM hXA and B: Approaching
Religion and courses within the department
numbered 11-50." It goes on to claim that
besides IHIJM. only two courses are avail
able this year to satisfy the introductory re
quirement. Ibis interpretation of the de
partment's requirements as stated in the
Bulletin is incorrect and,consequently, mis
leading.
Majors who have not taken the two
quarter I HUM are to satisfy the introduc
tion to the major by taking two courses be
tween II and 99 (not 50). One of those
courses will be an introduction to a religious
tradition, the other an introduction to one
or more approaches to religion. Seen in this

light, the number of courses available this
year ;it the introductory level jumps from
two to live (18,4(\52.62,84).This is no small
feat for a small department also involved in
111 l M and the staffing of three freshman
introductory seminars.
In addition, all of our core classes (e.g.,
majors' seminar. Writing in the Major, sen
ior colloquium) are offered annually, just as
you propose.
Moreover, you'll be pleased to know we
have long followed your rule of thumb that
courses not offered in the last two years not
be included in the Bulletin. Of course, there
are occasional exceptions and oversights to
this rule, but thanks to your thoughtful edi
torial. I am recommitting myself to striking
dormant courses from our portion of the
2007 Bulletin.
