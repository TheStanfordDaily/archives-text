## In Russia, language speaks you 
### Paul Craft 
Moscow. Saturday night. I sashay tipsi
ly out of a crowded bar blaring early
'90s hits for a much-needed smoke.
My cheap lighter flickers a quiet death
against the wind, so I stagger over to a cute
Russky leaning against a wall, hoping for
some halted conversation along with my cig
arette.
"Hello." I say in Russian. "May I buy
you?"
Unfortunately he wasn't a police officer,
or he probably would have said yes.
You see, in the Russian language.for those
ol you blissfully unacquainted, the verbs "to
smoke and "to buy" are separated by only
one phoneme. One phoneme and one look of
abject horror.
I love Russian culture and literature, but
for some reason foreign languages and I go
together like Thanksgiving Dinner and roller
coasters. So naturally I was slightly con
cerned before heading out to spend three
months in the heart of Moscow. But my con
sternation began to melt away when I finally
got here and found Muscovites to be ex
tremely helpful. When I ask people on the
street where this bus stops (five feet away) or

that building is (it does not exist), they are
nothing lint nice. Very nice. Extraordinarily
nice. Perhaps... a little too nice?
People here treat me like a 50-year-old
woman in pigtails going door-to-door, selling
candy bars so her soccer team for the mental
ly challenged can go to nationals. They are
kind because they pity me. As a convenience
store clerk told me the other day. impatiently
snatching the correct number of rubles out of
my cupped hand while I struggled to pay for a
soda: "Its not your fault you're an American."
Most of my communication problems
stem Irom the language barrier. For some
crazy reason I just cannot get the hang of a
language with over 350 verbs of motion, in
cluding such pragmatic necessities as "to

climb around in circles" and "to approach fly
ingly. In addition to this, every noun has six
lorms. giving you virtually limitless opportu
nity to talk yourself into a hole in the ground.
II Latin is a dead language. I hereby nomi
nate Russian for justifiable homicide.
I ve been studying it for about two years
now, but what little progress I've made is
completely steamrolled by my innate, perva
sive, totally unmistakable American-ness. My
American accent is pretty thick when I'm
speaking English, let alone trying to work my
articulators over a cluster of seven Slavic
consonants that wouldn't even say hi to each
other il they met at a party. When poor ma
ligned Muscovites start to ask me for direc
tions on the street, the second I open my
mouth, they turn on their heels and walk
away. Paris Hilton will pass for a sentient
being before 1 pass as a native speaker of the
Russian language.
I'oi tunately, many Muscovites speak won
derful English, which leads to the Twilight
Zone situation ol my obstinately plodding
along po-russki. them answering in English.
