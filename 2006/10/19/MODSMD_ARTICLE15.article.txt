# Putting class back in the classroom
## 
### 
Sometimes I wonder if professors realize
that the books they assign cost money,
rhey're always so casual, so matter-of
fact, as they announce that students will have
to acquire half a dozen books and a reader in
order to take their classes. I even had a pro
fessor that thought it funny, cracking a joke
about how the bookstore rips us off on $100
readers. Let's just say that the prof was the
only one laughing.
I want professors to realize that assigning
a large amount of materials not freely avail
able on ( ourseWork disproportionately im
pacts Stanford students with less money.
Phe classic way Stanford professors blow
off the issue of costly reading materials is by
putting books on reserve in the library. In the
profs mind, those who can't afford to buy
their own books and those would rather not
buy them can simply go down to the library
and read them there.
I believe a more accurate interpretation is
that profs whojustify the expense of their read
ing materials by putting them on reserve in the
library are, in reality, assigning more work for
students who cannot afford to buy the books.
lime is money,especially for your typical
ly overcommitted Stanford student. Going to
the library every time you need to do your
reading is a burden — a"burden that wealthi
er students do not have to bear. ITiose who
can afford to buy their books can write in
them, easily access them when studying for

exams or writing essays and look back on
them when unsure of points brought up in
class. ITicir access to information is uncon
strained, while less wealthy students must
work to gain this same level of access.
One way students who can't afford to buy
books get around these burdens is by photo
copying them at the library or by trying to
buy them used online. One of my friends
does not want to read books on reserve be
cause his way of studying and preparing to
write essays involves writing in his books. I le
has thus spent countless hours at the library
photocopying books to save money while
still being able to write in them. I le also tries
to save money by buying books used online.
Iliese books not only take time to find, but
also take time to be delivered and often don't
arrive until a lew weeks into the quarter.
I lie situation is even worse for many art
classes. Introduction to photography, for in
stance, requires students to provide their
own materials. Even if a student can find a

camera to borrow, photo paper and other
materials can cost over $ I (K). This high cost
not only prevents some students from tak
ing the class, hut also puts students with less
money at a disadvantage because they must
be more conservative in their use of photo
paper and other materials. Unlike wealthier
students, they cannot always afford to ex
periment with materials to get the perfect
print.
Students' economic situations should not
impact their grades or their access to infor
mation. but it ciin when class materials are
expensive. Some professors understand this,
posting much, it not all. of the required read
ing on ( ouiseWork. But many profs seem
completely unaware that expensive materi
als are a real burden to less wealthy students,
.1 burden that disadvantages these students
because of their economic status.
1 understand that professors sometimes
need to assign a large amount of reading, and
I'm not nsking them to assign any less. I just
w.int them to try to lessen these dispropor
tionate burdens ;is best they can. And when
there s nothing they can do, I want profs to be
conscious of the burdens they place on less
wealthy students.
