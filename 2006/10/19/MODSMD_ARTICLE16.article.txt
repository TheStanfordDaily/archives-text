## The 						true Stanford Challenge 
### ZACH DEMBO 
Last week. President Hennessy
unveiled the Stanford Challenge. For
those unfamiliar with it. think of it
like the l ast 112 ood Challenge, only
substitute gobs of money for menu
items, and Stanford tor the fast food
patron. Upon hearing about it, I was
initially optimistic.
An organization I'm involved
with, the Climate Change Campaign
of Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford. seeks to put the University on
the road to carbon-emissions neu
trality." What greater vehicle for that
lofty goal than something called 'the
Stanford Challenge." I thought. Ea
gerly looking over the official Web
site, I found that the program does
allot $250 million to "helping to en
sure that current and future genera
tions can live well on our planet."
This seems an admirable, if nebu
lous, goal, with very little to argue
against. The) seem focused on har
nessing Stanford's expertise to help
the rest of the world live in a more
sustainable fashion. However, 1
could not find one cent devoted to
fixing the problems in our own back
yard. not one sentence discussing
how Stanford would lead by doing
instead of by telling. Given what I
knew about Stanford's utter lack of
action on climate change mitigation,
this was sadly just another piece of
the puzzle.
Earlier this year, representatives
from the Climate Change Campaign
met with President Hennessy and
asked him for an institutional com
mitment to reduce emissions 10 per
cent below 1990 levels of green
house-gas emissions by the year
2020. This was by no means a radical
request, reflecting the relatively con
servative goals of the Kyoto Protocol
and other prominent climate change
agreements. The group was told that
more discussion was necessary, and
was sent a follow-up letter telling
them to have a good summer. In
other words, the administration was
not prepared to undertake any ac

tion on this matter. For many who
follow environmental policy trends,
this seems a staggering non sequitur.
In April. Stanford's very own
Woods Institute released a poll to he
included in a publication entitled
"America's Report Card on the Envi
ronment." The poll revealed an as
tonishing 86 percent of Americans
said that they wanted "a great deal or
a lot to be done to help the environ
ment within the next year."This Sep
tember. Governor Schwarzenegger
of California signed into law the most
aggressive carbon-emissions reduc
tion bill in the United States.The bill
commits the state to a cut of 25 per
cent by the year 2020. and 80 percent
by 2050. Events like this are becom
ing increasingly commonplace, show
ing that Americans are restless for ac
tion to combat global warming.
Nowhere is this more evident or fer
vent than California.
National and statewide trends
make President Hennessy's decision
seem out of place, but events at Stan
lord itself make it seem positively
against the grain. Stanford is one of
the centers of progressive thought
and liberal discourse within the state.
Students, faculty and staff alike have
been addressing sustainability issues
for many years. Specific interest on
climate change remains high.Two re
cent showings of "An Inconvenient
Truth" were so heavily attended that
the venues could barely contain at
tendees. You may remember that Al
Gore himself came to deliver his
famed climate change presentation a
little more than a year ago.This bulk
of evidence would leave an outside
observer to conclude that Stanford
must be at the vanguard of climate
change mitigation. As was made
abundantly clear last June, that is not
the case. Why is there a discrepancy?
Sadly, it seems a lack of will to act,
something not usually in short sup
ply here.
What justifies this timidity, 1 do
not know. What they would say justi
fies it. however, is sadly predictable:
the age-old argument that environ

mentally responsible policy and eco
nomic growth are mutually exclu
sive, and that the latter is more im
portant. Stanford is in a period of
prodigious expansion, they say. and
we cannot afford to restrict this
growth by limiting it or diverting re
sources to deal with its conse
quences. (If it seems that the goal of
emissions reductions is too weighty
tor a huge research institution, it
should be noted that Harvard and
Yale agreed to such reductions sev
eral years ago, and Princeton has a
movement similar to ours underway
as we speak.)
rhe most exigent incarnation of
this "growth at any cost" attitude is
the Stanford Challenge. It would be
the acme of hypocrisy to tell devel
oping nations how to become more
environmentally friendly while our
paradisiacal campus continues
blithely burning more and more fos
sil luels with no end or moderation in
sight. Shouldn't we mend our own
fences first before telling others to do
so? Shouldn't we start by becoming
as sustainable as possible, especially
when we are in a climate so amazing
ly conducive to environmental pro
gressivism?
To answer these questions, and
many others, I hope you will attend a
campus-wide meeting on climate
change policy at Stanford this Sun
day. Sponsored by the Climate
Change Campaign, it will be held in
Bechtel International Center at 6
p.m., and dinner will be provided.
I lopefully. this forum will provide us
the tools necessary to affect change
and ensure that Stanford makes
good its obligations as a flagship in
stitution and global citizen. That
should be the true Stanford Chal
lenge.
