# Student hashers deserve more

### ANDREW PETERMAN 
1 write to the Stanford communi
ty in order to shed light upon the
grave injustice facing our student
hashers (dishwashers) on campus.
The student-managed eating
clubs have a long history of employ
ing and exploiting Stanford students
as hashers. Between 20 and 30 stu
dents rely upon the meager wages
from hashing to help pay for an
upper-echelon Stanford education.
The hashers work in the steamy
kitchens giving up many of the tradi
tional college activities to ensure that
ihe rest of the pampered bourgeois
student body can receive their meals
with little interruption from their
studies.

As an eating associate in one of
the eating clubs. I watch as these stu
dents toil and labor to clean our re
fuse. 1 have the luxury of enjoying an
after-dinner conversation or running
off to study without thinking twice
about who will clean up after me.
Hashers sacrifice their academics,
athletics and social pursuits to scrape
up a few more dollars.
We the students, who receive the
benefits of the hashers' hard work
day in and day out. have a responsi
bility to pressure management to
pay hashers more fairly. In addi
tion. management refuses to invite
hashers to any Suites functions, fur
ther exploiting them and treating
them inferior to many manual la
borers.

Please support the Suites eating
club hashers in their efforts for better
wages and proper benefits. Ihe stu
dent hashers are not making unrea
sonable requests, but pleading with
the management to treat them with
the highest level of respect that all
Stanford students and community
members deserve.
We owe our fellow students the
privilege of an educational environ
ment that bestows the esteem and in
tegrity in which Jane and Leland
Stanford founded this great institu
tion we call Stanford University.
