## CARD IN CONTROL 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
During a successful trip to l.os Angeles last
weekend, the Stanford women's volleyball team
proved they're in it for the long haul.This week,
they got their dues, climbing from No. 6 to No. 3
in tiie national AVC'A Coach's Poll.
Ihe Cardinal (15-2, 6-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) defeated two previously undefeated
squads last week in No. 5 Southern California
and No. 4 UCLA. Stanford is now the highest
nationally ranked Pac-10 team and trails both
I.A schools by just one win in conference stand
ings.

by sophomore outside hitter Cynthia Barboza's
4.63 kills per game. Sophomore outside hitter
Foluke Akinradewo is hitting .418, and senior
Kristin Richards has added 3.76 kills per game.
Junior setter Bryn Kehoe continues to lead the
offense, with over 12 sets per game.
Stanford has allowed opponents to hit just
.154 this season.
But despite Stanford's current spot, head
coach John Dunning understands that the Car
dinal is still a long way away from securing the
Pac-10 title.
"Big wins happen, and we are fortunate to
have beaten two undefeated teams," Dunning
said. "I know our team feels good about how
we're playing, but there's a lot of really good
teams in this conference."
The Cardinal must defend their No. 3 rank
ing this weekend when they host Pac-10 foes
Oregon and Oregon State â€” two of only five
Pac-10 teams not ranked in the national top 10.
Stanfoid first hosts Oregon State (3-13.0-7

feated the Beavers in 42 consecutive matches.

Cahoon with 11 kills. The Beavers ended up
dropping the three-game decision to the Wild
cats.
