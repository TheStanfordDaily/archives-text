# Stanford tunes up in Canada
## Men's volleyball begins exhibition season at Husky Dino Cup 
### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
First-year Stanford men's vol
leyball head coach John Kosty
has had plenty of time to learn
Itis trade. To be more exact, he's
had 16 years as the assistant
coach at Stanford, perfecting his
skills under some of the best
teachers around.
Kosty will finally get his
chance at the helm due to former
head coach Don Shaw's retire
ment last season. Luckily for
Kosty. the Cardinal will play a
few tune-up matches before the
actual season begins this January.
This weekend, Stanford will
head to Calgary to compete in
the annual Husky Dino Cup
tournament. The Cardinal will
play four games in all,concluding
with a medal match on Saturday.
Ken Shibuya will inherit the
vacated assistant coach spot. He
piloted his former team. Juniata
College, to three straight men's
Division 111 national champi
onships.
The Cardinal are a young
team this year, returning only
one senior in libero Brian Lind
berg. Stanford also returns only
three juniors and will need con
tributions from their 10 fresh
men and sophomores.
'This will be a good barome
ter of where we are with our
competitors,' Kosty said. I his
will be a good indication compet
itively where I see everybody [in
regatds to] theircompetitive atti
tude, their desire and their fight."
Just going off of their height,
vertical leap and overall under
standing of the game, Stanford
looks to be a promising team.
Stanford boasts one ot their
tallest freshman classes in recent
years. Iliree players stand 6 6 or
above - f-van Romero. Garret
Warner and tvd Howell. Outside
hitter Jason Palacios also stands
at 6'3".

Sophomore middle blocker Brandon Williams (right) and sophomore setter Miki Groppi will head
to Calgary this weekend to compete in the Husky Dino Cup.
Although he's listed as a setter,
freshman Kawika Shoji appears
able to play all six positions.
Naturally, the team will have to
deal with some rust this early in the
preseason.
"We've only had six practices so
far," said Kosty. "We're currently
running the basics. We're not get
ting too complex yet since we have
had so little time to [rehearse]."
ITie Cardinal are hoping to im
prove on last year's record, Iliey
finished 4-24 overall but just 2-20 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation, a far cry from their 1W na
tional championship finish.
Kosty, who was an assistant
coach back at the time, remembers
quite well the preparation and
training that went into that magical
season. When his squad met for the
first time earlier this year, lie passed
his championship ring around the
room in hopes of lighting a fire.
This Alumni Weekend brought
back two players from Stanford's
storied past — Mike Lambert and
Matt Fuerbringer.two current AVP
pro players from the Stanford 1997
team. They shared their stories, and
then played a friendly game of in
door volleyball.
The visit seemed to charge the
current team, which started hitting
harder and passing and setting
more accurately by the match's
end.
Though Kosty said that his main
goal is winning, lie also said this
weekend will be a little different.
He plans on toying with the lineup
before the season actually starts.
"Our drive is always to win."
Kosty said. "We're looking to win
this tournament, but we're not
going to win the tournament with
just one team. Everyone will get to
start at least one game."
Also, he plans on taking this op
portunity— away from dorm life,
classes and girls — to help the team
gel. Ilie team will be in Canada, a
far crv from the beaches and sand
courts they know so well.
"1 plan on letting the whole
team bond as a unit," said Kosty.
"During off time, we'll do some
team-oriented stuff: team meals,
team dinners, even go on a few
tours."
