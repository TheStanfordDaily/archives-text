### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
First-year Stanford men's vol
leyball head coach John Kosty
has had plenty of time to learn
Itis trade. To be more exact, he's
had 16 years as the assistant
coach at Stanford, perfecting his
skills under some of the best
teachers around.
Kosty will finally get his
chance at the helm due to former
head coach Don Shaw's retire
ment last season. Luckily for
Kosty. the Cardinal will play a
few tune-up matches before the
actual season begins this January.
This weekend, Stanford will
head to Calgary to compete in
the annual Husky Dino Cup
tournament. The Cardinal will
play four games in all,concluding
with a medal match on Saturday.
Ken Shibuya will inherit the
vacated assistant coach spot. He
piloted his former team. Juniata
College, to three straight men's
Division 111 national champi
onships.
The Cardinal are a young
team this year, returning only
one senior in libero Brian Lind
berg. Stanford also returns only
three juniors and will need con
tributions from their 10 fresh
men and sophomores.
'This will be a good barome
ter of where we are with our
competitors,' Kosty said. I his
will be a good indication compet
itively where I see everybody [in
regatds to] theircompetitive atti
tude, their desire and their fight."
Just going off of their height,
vertical leap and overall under
standing of the game, Stanford
looks to be a promising team.
Stanford boasts one ot their
tallest freshman classes in recent
years. Iliree players stand 6 6 or
above - f-van Romero. Garret
Warner and tvd Howell. Outside
hitter Jason Palacios also stands
at 6'3".
