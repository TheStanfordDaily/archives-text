## After rebirth, FLiCKS gets lukewarm review Technical glitches and communication difficulties are cited 
### CAMILA TAPERNOUX 
Students have given FLiCKs
mixed reviews after its first three
weeks, with undergraduate students
taking technical glitches in stride
and graduate students complaining
that they have been kept out of the
loop.
The Sunday-night tradition has
caught flack from graduate students
for failing to keep graduate stu
dents informed about the film
schedule. And Maria Spletter, a
doctoral student in biological sci
ences, complained that the FLiCKs
Web site was down until recently.
"1 had been waiting all summer
to see 'Pirates of the Caribbean 2'
because 1 was sure it would be at
FLiCKs," Spletter told ITie Daily in
an email. "It was the first movie
[shown] and because there was no
advertising, I didn't even know, so 1
missed it."
FLiCKs is in its first year as a
Volunteer Student Organization,
which gives it access to special fees
money and allows for free admis
sion. The flip side of this largess is
that students must approve its fund
ing every April in the ASSU special
fees elections, a fact that was not
lost on the disappointed Spletter.
"I'd hope FLiCKs would be in
terested in advertising to grads,or at
least trying to get some grads in
volved, so they don't endanger their
special fee money in the spring,"she
warned.
With admission now free, stu
dents are learning that you get what

you pay for, with long delays and
sound problems the past two weeks.
These difficulties, however, have
not slowed attendance, and stu
dents said instead that glitches can
he a source of entertainment.
The 40-minute delay before the
10 p.m. showing of "Cars" Oct. 8
prompted an extended paper fight,
a FLiCKs tradition. Last Sunday at
the late showing of "A Scanner
Darkly," audio problems — the vol
ume began ear-splittingly loud and
then dropped off to a whisper —
led to the usual taunts and shouted
witticisms. And the change of venue
for "Pirate of the Carribean: Dead
Man's Chest" from Memorial Audi
torium to Cubberley Auditorium
went unannounced, but students
said the Band's performance before
the show more than made up for the
last-minute switch.
Even though FLiCKs circulates
surveys before each quarter to
gauge what movies might be popu
lar, some students said they came
for the atmosphere and stayed for
the movie. Freshman Chelsea
Sprick said she heads to Memorial
Auditorium every Sunday to let off
steam after a long day of home
work.
"I go even when 1 don't know
what movie will be showing," she
said.
FLiCKs Producer Michael
Priest acknowledged the technical
difficulties that have befallen
FLiCKs in recent weeks and attrib
uted the pitfalls to faulty film reels
(the distributors are sending re
funds).
And if the student projectionists
are ever to blame for a glitch?
"[We are] making the projec
tionists watch 'Gigli,' 'From Justin

Students enjoy a film at the first FLiCKs showing in Cubberly Auditorium on September 30th,
before different problems started drawing a disgruntled audience.
To Kelly' and Battlefield Earth' if
they ever make a mistake," he said.
Priest said he has seen an in
crease in attendance so far this year
despite the poor advertising and
technical difficulties, and did not
mince words in trying to explain it.
"I think the fact that there's noth
ing else to do on campus helps tot),"
he said. "Although 1 hear Absolute
Fun has some great ideas now that
they've finished Full Moon on the
Quad, like pumpkin carving with
butter knives."
