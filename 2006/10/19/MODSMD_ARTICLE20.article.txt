# Wanted: A franchise QB
## 
### 
America and I have a little tradi
tion every Sunday. We wake up. turn
on the television and watch Peyton
Manning commercials with snippets
of football scattered throughout our
viewing experience.
Ihere was a time when we'd also
see Tom Brady with his linemen and a
Visa card — and maybe even Dono
van McNabb and his Campbell's
C 'hunky Soup. But those golden days
of yesteryear are gone now. for the
Ni l. marketing machine says there is
only one quarterback and his name is
Manning.
It wasn't always this way. There
was a time only a few short years ago
when franchise quarterbacks seemed
to grow on trees. II you didn't like
Aikman.you could be a fan of Young.
If the Dolphins' pastel uniforms made
you queasy, you could support Elway
over Marino. Brett Favre was still a
young quarterback prone to big mis
takes and bigger successes, rather
than the veteran prone to the reverse.
Names like Jim Kelly. Phil Simmsjoe
Montana and Boomer lisiason were
recent history rather than ancient.
Those were the good old days. Ihe
story lines were more compelling, as
we watched players we knew we
could call great duel on Sundays to
determine how their greatness would
be remembered. Hie play on the field
was better — the modern offense
flows through the quarterback, so the


Griffin

Ranis and Raves
better the quarterback, the cleaner
the offensive play.
Then, somehow, the league
slipped from that enviable posi
tion, as future 11 all of Fame players
— at the most important position
— retired and were not replaced.
We went from the age of Montana,
Marino and 1-1 way to that ofVinny
lestaverde. Drew Bledsoe and
Kerry Collins.
Year after year, fans league
wide failed to find a new genera
tion of signal callers to take the
place of the old. The likes of Akili
Smith, Tim Couch, David Carr and
Joey Harrington all proved to be at
best decidedly mediocre NFL
players and at worst busts of the
highest order.
Did the talent dry up? Perhaps
in part, but it seems likely that a
changing league image and atti
tude played a significant role as
well. The highlight culture that
seems to pervade sports more and
more with each passing year sim
ply isn't conducive to the develop
ment of young talent in any sport,
and even less so for the players at
the most visible position in the na
tion's most popular league.
Perhaps the most prime exam
ple of this is the current rise of San
Francisco quarterback Alex
Smith. As a fan of the team, the
negative statistics of a year ago are
seared into my mind because the

"We went from the
age of Montana,
Marino and Elway to
Testavarde, Bledsoe
and Collins"

rookie couldn't be mentioned
without them. A 40.<S QB rating.
Eleven interceptions and only one
touchdown. A 2-5 record as a
starter.
It was as if people forgot that he
was throwing to the likes of Bran
don Lloyd and Arnaz Battle and
handing off to the great kevan
Barlow, who currently boasts a 2.8
yards-per-carry average with the
Jets. Oh, and that he was a rookie
playing in a pro-style offense for
the first time in his career. His
name was a punch line to a joke
team.
One year later, the kid looks
like a star in the making.
It's the perfect illustration of
the modern fan's unreasonable ex
pectations. Everything has to hap
pen now, and the modern quarter
back knows it. So if you're a young
signal caller in the league,you have

less time than ever to prove your
self capable of the job. With that in
creased pressure comes more mis
takes. as young players struggle to
drive away the boos with big plays
that can often go bad in the form ot
interceptions and sacks.
But now for the good news:
The drought appears to be over.
Finally, the league seems to have a
plethora of young quarterbacks
worthy of getting excited about,
and even if only some of them
ever truly become franchise play
ers. the league could still have the
richest level of talent at the posi
tion that it's had since the late '80s
and early "90s.
Carson Palmer's i ise to stardom
seems inevitable, and given the
early returns of this season, Smith,
Philip Rivers and Matt Leinart
seem to be well on their way as
well. Throw in a still-young Eli
Manning and the raw and obvious
potential in Ja\ Cutler and Vince
Young, and you realize that the fu
ture ot the quarterback position
seems to be on firmer ground than
it has been in a long time.
Ihc NFL is about to get a lot
more interesting. 1 mean. Bledsoe
looks ready to retire, right?

Denis Griffin is a junior w ho's still
waiting for the Niners to pick up a
decent win. Email him at

Then, somehow, the league
slipped from that enviable posi
tion, as future 11 all of Fame players
— at the most important position
— retired and were not replaced.
We went from the age of Montana,
Marino and 1-1 way to that ofVinny
lestaverde. Drew Bledsoe and
Kerry Collins.
Year after year, fans league
wide failed to find a new genera
tion of signal callers to take the
place of the old. The likes of Akili
Smith, Tim Couch, David Carr and
Joey Harrington all proved to be at
best decidedly mediocre NFL
players and at worst busts of the
highest order.
Did the talent dry up? Perhaps
in part, but it seems likely that a
changing league image and atti
tude played a significant role as
well. The highlight culture that
seems to pervade sports more and
more with each passing year sim
ply isn't conducive to the develop
ment of young talent in any sport,
and even less so for the players at
the most visible position in the na
tion's most popular league.
Perhaps the most prime exam
ple of this is the current rise of San
Francisco quarterback Alex
Smith. As a fan of the team, the
negative statistics of a year ago are
seared into my mind because the

"We went from the
age of Montana,
Marino and Elway to
Testavarde, Bledsoe
and Collins"

rookie couldn't be mentioned
without them. A 40.<S QB rating.
Eleven interceptions and only one
touchdown. A 2-5 record as a
starter.
It was as if people forgot that he
was throwing to the likes of Bran
don Lloyd and Arnaz Battle and
handing off to the great kevan
Barlow, who currently boasts a 2.8
yards-per-carry average with the
Jets. Oh, and that he was a rookie
playing in a pro-style offense for
the first time in his career. His
name was a punch line to a joke
team.
One year later, the kid looks
like a star in the making.
It's the perfect illustration of
the modern fan's unreasonable ex
pectations. Everything has to hap
pen now, and the modern quarter
back knows it. So if you're a young
signal caller in the league,you have

less time than ever to prove your
self capable of the job. With that in
creased pressure comes more mis
takes. as young players struggle to
drive away the boos with big plays
that can often go bad in the form ot
interceptions and sacks.
But now for the good news:
The drought appears to be over.
Finally, the league seems to have a
plethora of young quarterbacks
worthy of getting excited about,
and even if only some of them
ever truly become franchise play
ers. the league could still have the
richest level of talent at the posi
tion that it's had since the late '80s
and early "90s.
Carson Palmer's i ise to stardom
seems inevitable, and given the
early returns of this season, Smith,
Philip Rivers and Matt Leinart
seem to be well on their way as
well. Throw in a still-young Eli
Manning and the raw and obvious
potential in Ja\ Cutler and Vince
Young, and you realize that the fu
ture ot the quarterback position
seems to be on firmer ground than
it has been in a long time.
Ihc NFL is about to get a lot
more interesting. 1 mean. Bledsoe
looks ready to retire, right?
