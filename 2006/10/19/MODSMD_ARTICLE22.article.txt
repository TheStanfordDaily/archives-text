# Top field heads to the Farm for Stanford Intercollegiate
## No. 6 women's golf hopes to continue winning ways as event host 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN 
Fresh off their first victory of the season, the No.
6 Stanford women's golf team hopes to carry mo
mentum into this weekend's Stanford Intercolle
giate at the Stanford Golf Course.
The Cardinal will compete in a field of 15, in
cluding seven Pacific-10 Conference squads and
nine ranked opponents. Challengers include No. 12
Arizona. No. 21 Arkansas. California. No. 2 Duke,
No. 15 New Mexico. Oregon State, Oregon. San
Jose State. Tulsa, No. 3 UCLA, No. 9 Vanderbilt,
Washington. Washington State and top-ranked
Georgia.
In a strong pool with the top three teams in the
nation, the Cardinal seek to fare better than last"
year's ninth place finish at the tourney. Last year,
Duke (834) took the event with a commanding 27-
stroke victory over second-place UCLA (861) and
set a new course record over 54 holes. Southern Cal
ifornia (863), Pepperdine (869) and Arizona State
(882) rounded out the top five.
In the individual field. Duke's Elizabeth Janan
gelo took top honors with an 11-under (70-67-65
202). Teammates Anna Grzebien (71-71-67)
and Amanda Blumenherst (70-71-68) tied for sec
ond, shooting a four-under (209). The Cardinal
team was led by then-freshman Mari Chun, who
finished 10th with a two-over (75-72-68 — 215).
Following Chun were Kelly 1 lusted (75-73-73 —

221) at 28th, Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana (77-73-
75 — 225) at 43rd. Lauren Todd (77-75-78 — 230)
at 65th and Ki-Shui Liao (76-79-76 — 231) at
73rd.
"We certainly know the Stanford Golf Course
better than anyone," head coach Caroline O'Con
nor said. "We've seen most of these teams at least
once, if not twice already this year, and beat almost
all of them. We'll need to be very sharp in our deci
sion making and shot selections."
Their win at last week's Ldean Ihlanfeldt Invita
tional at Sammamish. Wash. — their first since the
2004 season — garnered them Golfweek's Team of
the Week award. Sophomore Mari Chun's individ
ual performance earned her Golfweek's Player of
the Week as well. The Cardinal had prevailed in a
six-stroke victory over New Mexico and eight Pac
-10 opponents, led by Chun's 215.
"The win was certainly a huge momentum
builder after two impressive starts in Japan and
Nashville," said O'Connor. "Sahalce [home of the
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational] is one of the more
challenging courses we'll see in collegiate golf.
Mari's win was really impressive — again, it was a
great field and she really played solidly all week."
The Stanford Intercollegiate is a three-day event
featuring 18 holes a day for a total of 54 over the
course of the weekend.
The tourney will be Stanford's last of 2006, as play
will piek up again in February at the Northrop Grum
man Regional Challenge in Palos Verdes I states,
Calif.
"Our goal is to be in position on the final day to
win every tournament whether it's the first or last of
the season." O'Connor said. "We've proven that we
can win against the best on a challenging course, so I
think our expectations are very high."
