# Ryan a true student-athletem
## Life on The Farm has been a fairy tale for senior Dave Ryan, who was discovered by Cardinal coaches after a year away from tennis 
### BY CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
About three and a half years ago. senior
Dave Rvan accepted his admission to Califor
nia and was even assigned a dorm room. Ryan
had ultimately chosen to be a Golden Bear.and
the decision seemed only natural at the time
Ryan's older brother was attending Berkeley,
and Ryan enjoyed his \ isits to Cal.
It seemed certain that Ryan would be sport
ing the blue and gold every year at the Big
Game. But when Ryan later learned of his ac
ceptance to The Farm, he quickly traded in all
of his Cal gear for Cardinal red.
"I'm glad he didn't go to ( ,'al." men's tennis
head coach John Whitlinger said. "I'm really
happv that he's been on the team for the last
two years because he has just been one of the
best team members you could ever have."
Rvan began his first year of college like
many freshmen — starting off with a light
course load, setting his alarm to ensure that he
wouldn't sleep through lunch and adjusting to
the college lifestyle. Despite playing through
out high school. Ryan rarely touched a tennis
racket during his first year of college.
Senior Eric McKean one of Ryan's
friends from high school played tennis for
Stanford, and the two remained good friends
through college, even joining Sigma Nil frater
nity together at the end of their freshmen year.
Early in their sophomore year. Ryan and
McKean were having a hitting session and hap
pened to be spotted by Whitlinger.'Hie coach
approached McKean and inquired about his
hitting partner, ultimately offering Ryan a try
out.
"I had hit with my dad a lot the summer be
fore, and I happened to be hitting really well."
Ryan said."My dad and I both noticed it. out of
nowhere, my game just got a lot better in a short
amount of time.
"It [was] a coincidence that [Coach
Whitlinger saw me play] then, because I bet if
he had seen me six months earlier, he never
would have thought (to give me a tryout]."
Ryan said.
As luck would have it. both senior James
Pade and junior Chris Rasmussen decided to
red-shirt in 2(X)4. leaving an open spot on the
team. Rvan began his two-week-lona tryout.

"When I was going through the tryout, Eric
trained with me outside of his regular prac
tice." Ryan said. "He hit with me. went run
ning with me a lot and set up forme to hit with
other guys on the team. Once I got on the
team, he eased my transition really well, and
that was all a huge thing for him to do. | Being
on the team] lias been one of the coolest parts
of my Stanford experience, and 1 owe a lot of
that to [Eric]."
Once the Los Angeles native joined the
team, he was able to experience something that
few others can say they've done: live the life of
both a regular student and a student-athlete.
(ione were the days of sleeping in past noon,
and in its place came early-morning workouts.
But in addition to the conditioning came an ir
replaceable network of teammates and friend
ships.
"It's like having a little family within Stan
ford." Ryan said."l can go in the team room or
the [Taube Family Tennis] Stadium, and it feels
like a home base. It's kind of [incredible] to feel
at home in a place that's so amazing.To feel at
home in the trophy room with 30 national
championship trophies is just surreal."
Ryan said he appreciates the high quality of
fered by both athletics and academics at Stan
ford. Having been both a typical student and a
student-athlete, Ryan is able to offer a unique
vantage point. Ihe senior believes the academ
ic standards should not be sacrificed simply for
the sake of a few more wins.
"I feel like people want to have it both
ways." Ryan said. "You always hear people
bragging about how Stanford is able to have
both high academic and high athletic standards.
Implicit in that brag is we're only taking ath
letes that are of a high academic quality. But as
soon as a team starts not having success, [peo
ple think] you can't have it both ways."
An ITA Scholar-Athlete. Ryan maintains
that lie would much rather be able to make the
claim that Stanford brings in athletes of high ac
ademic and athletic caliber rather than have the
school lower its admissions standards and start
winning a few more championships — espe
cially when Stanford already boasts the na
tion's best athletic program.
Ryan believes that the success of his team
comes down to adopting a winning attitude,
and he is confident that with this mindset, Stan-

ford tennis has
tremendous potential
for the upcoming season.
"When I first joined the
team. [Whitlinger] and [assis
tant coach] Dave 1 lodge told
me that the goal and the ex
pectation for Stanford tennis
every year is to win an
NCAA championship,"
Ryan said. "Since that day,
my goal has been to help our
team achieve that. It hasn't
happened yet. and it is going
to be tough again this year be
cause there are some other re-

ally good teams out there.
"I honestly believe that with

the team we have, we are fully ca
pable of winning a championship. I

think the single biggest factor for us is
that everyone on the team believes
that. If everyone does, and is willing to
go for it, we absolutely have the guys to
doit." M 'pP*

Ryan said."My dad and I both noticed it. out of

"It [was] a coincidence that [Coach
Whitlinger saw me play] then, because I bet if
he had seen me six months earlier, he never
would have thought (to give me a tryout]."
Ryan said.
As luck would have it. both senior James
Pade and junior Chris Rasmussen decided to

team. Rvan began his two-week-lona tryout.

"When I was going through the tryout, Eric
trained with me outside of his regular prac
tice." Ryan said. "He hit with me. went run

other guys on the team. Once I got on the
team, he eased my transition really well, and
that was all a huge thing for him to do. | Being

Ryan said he appreciates the high quality of

ford. Having been both a typical student and a
student-athlete, Ryan is able to offer a unique
vantage point. Ihe senior believes the academ
ic standards should not be sacrificed simply for
the sake of a few more wins.
"I feel like people want to have it both
ways." Ryan said. "You always hear people
bragging about how Stanford is able to have
both high academic and high athletic standards.
Implicit in that brag is we're only taking ath
letes that are of a high academic quality. But as
soon as a team starts not having success, [peo

claim that Stanford brings in athletes of high ac
ademic and athletic caliber rather than have the
school lower its admissions standards and start
winning a few more championships — espe

Ryan believes that the success of his team
comes down to adopting a winning attitude,
and he is confident that with this mindset, Stan-

ford tennis has
tremendous potential
for the upcoming season.
"When I first joined the

me that the goal and the ex
pectation for Stanford tennis
every year is to win an
NCAA championship,"
Ryan said. "Since that day,
my goal has been to help our
team achieve that. It hasn't
happened yet. and it is going
to be tough again this year be
cause there are some other re-

ally good teams out there.
"I honestly believe that with

the team we have, we are fully ca
pable of winning a championship. I

think the single biggest factor for us is
that everyone on the team believes
that. If everyone does, and is willing to
go for it, we absolutely have the guys to

but he's a great guy. He works hard and
going to be successful in whatever he does."

About three and a half years ago. senior
Dave Rvan accepted his admission to Califor
nia and was even assigned a dorm room. Ryan
had ultimately chosen to be a Golden Bear.and
the decision seemed only natural at the time
Ryan's older brother was attending Berkeley,
and Ryan enjoyed his \ isits to Cal.
It seemed certain that Ryan would be sport
ing the blue and gold every year at the Big
Game. But when Ryan later learned of his ac
ceptance to The Farm, he quickly traded in all
of his Cal gear for Cardinal red.
"I'm glad he didn't go to ( ,'al." men's tennis
head coach John Whitlinger said. "I'm really
happv that he's been on the team for the last
two years because he has just been one of the
best team members you could ever have."
Rvan began his first year of college like
many freshmen — starting off with a light
course load, setting his alarm to ensure that he
wouldn't sleep through lunch and adjusting to
the college lifestyle. Despite playing through
out high school. Ryan rarely touched a tennis
racket during his first year of college.
Senior Eric McKean one of Ryan's
friends from high school played tennis for
Stanford, and the two remained good friends
through college, even joining Sigma Nil frater
nity together at the end of their freshmen year.
Early in their sophomore year. Ryan and
McKean were having a hitting session and hap
pened to be spotted by Whitlinger.'Hie coach
approached McKean and inquired about his
hitting partner, ultimately offering Ryan a try
out.
"I had hit with my dad a lot the summer be
fore, and I happened to be hitting really well."
Ryan said."My dad and I both noticed it. out of
nowhere, my game just got a lot better in a short
