## Senator Simitian says K-12 education is failing 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
California's K-12 education system is
a sinking ship with no quick fix in sight.
State Senator Joe Simitian told a near
capacity crowd in Cubberley Auditorium
last night.
"The best starting point is to acknowl
edge that it's dysfunctional," said Simit

ian. who represents San Mateo, Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz counties. "Rather
than ensuring equal opportunity for all,
we may have ensured an equal lack of
opportunity across the board."
Addressing a full house, Simitian and
Professor Emeritus of Education and
Business Administration Michael Kirst
unpacked the mess of school finance is
sues that weieh heavily on the minds of

students, parents and educators in the
state. The event, co-sponsored by the
School of Education, The Roosevelt In
stitution and 1 huts Center for Public Ser
vice's Call to Serve, was partly advertised
as a forum on Proposition 88, which
would raise $500 million a year for k-12
schools. Yet both speakers steered away
from the proposition and instead
broached the problems at the core of the

education finance system.
"I was really surprised they didn't talk
about Proposition 88. because I was ac
tually here to listen to them talk about
it," said Mark Lieber, a co-terminal stu
dent in media studies. "They probably
didn't talk about it much because it has
no chance of passing."

"The best
starting point
is to acknowl
edge that its
dysfunctional."

State Senator Joe Simitian speaks about California education financing at a speaker event co-sponsored by The Roosevelt In
stitution and Haas Center for Public Service's Call to Serve. Education and Busniess Administration Prof. Emeritus Michael Kirst
is at right.
Simitian kicked off discussion by
outlining the governmental barriers
it) promoting adequacy and efficien
cy within the school finance system.
The system itself is at fault, he ar
gued, because it perpetuates a blame
game between bureaucrats and offi
cials who refuse to take responsibili
ty for policy failures and pass the
buck to their colleagues.
To make matters worse, those in
the community who want to help the
education system are discouraged
from doing so because they cannot
understand it, Simitian said.
"1 think we're never going to be
successful if people can't compre
hend how the system works," he said.
"It's all so difficult that it just makes
the average citizen just want to
throw up their hands and walk
away."
Simitian urged the audience to re
solve these issues through incremen
tal progress rather than revolution
ary aims. Given California's track
record with resolving school finance
issues, the likelihood of dramatic

change is not high, he added.
"We have to commit ourselves
and keep our eye on the big picture
so that we can make progress when
and where we can," he said.
Kirst voiced similar concerns, but
broadened the discussion with his
own set of scholarly recommenda
tions on how to buoy the sinking sys
tem. Among them, he advocated a
merit-based pay system that links
funding to academic standards. 1 le
also lauded the upwelling of success
ful charter schools across California,
which run independently of public
school systems and are fashioned in
a way that meet individual commu
nity needs.
"1 think parents are showing they
want charter schools," Kirst said.
"They provide support for popula
tions that have been lost here, in
cluding dropouts."
Takafumi Kirimura, a graduate
student in education visiting from
Kyoto University, found that the
talk helped him draw parallels be
tween the problems facing both
America and Japan's educational
systems.
"I felt like the education system
in Japan is following suit with Amer
ica's." Kirimura said. "The education
situation in Japan is out of control."

But Devin Ozdogu, a graduate
student in education, said he left the
talk wanting more.
"It's curious that neither speaker
spent a significant amount of time on
the distribution and training of the
teacher workforce since the quality
of teachers plays a huge — if not the
biggest — role in educational out
comes," Ozdogu said.
Lieber said he too left the talk
with a bad taste in his mouth.
"It seemed like the message was
that we just need to wait out this bad
period," Lieber said. "I left feeling
like there's little I can do because it's
so ridiculously complex. I left feeling
more ignorant about everything
than when I came in."
Simitian closed the discussion by
reemphasizing the importance of
school finance reform and touted the
commitment of audience members
towards addressing a difficult and
often discouraging topic with world
wide implications.
"We have to commit ourselves,"
Simitian said. "To the extent we hold
our society as a story of equal oppor
tunity, our public schools are the
clearest means to making that a real
ity. This is a matter not only of oppor
tunity and viability, but of global se
curity."
