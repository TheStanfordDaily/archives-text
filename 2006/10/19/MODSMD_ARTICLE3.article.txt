## Senator Simitian says K-12 education is failing 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
California's K-12 education system is
a sinking ship with no quick fix in sight.
State Senator Joe Simitian told a near
capacity crowd in Cubberley Auditorium
last night.
"The best starting point is to acknowl
edge that it's dysfunctional," said Simit

ian. who represents San Mateo, Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz counties. "Rather
than ensuring equal opportunity for all,
we may have ensured an equal lack of
opportunity across the board."
Addressing a full house, Simitian and
Professor Emeritus of Education and
Business Administration Michael Kirst
unpacked the mess of school finance is
sues that weieh heavily on the minds of

students, parents and educators in the
state. The event, co-sponsored by the
School of Education, The Roosevelt In
stitution and 1 huts Center for Public Ser
vice's Call to Serve, was partly advertised
as a forum on Proposition 88, which
would raise $500 million a year for k-12
schools. Yet both speakers steered away
from the proposition and instead
broached the problems at the core of the

education finance system.
"I was really surprised they didn't talk
about Proposition 88. because I was ac
tually here to listen to them talk about
it," said Mark Lieber, a co-terminal stu
dent in media studies. "They probably
didn't talk about it much because it has
no chance of passing."

"The best
starting point
is to acknowl
edge that its
dysfunctional."
