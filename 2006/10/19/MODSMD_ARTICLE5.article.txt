# HENNESSY TO REVAMP EDUCATION
## President lends ears to new education reforms including inrceased financial aid and greater emphasis on science 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University President John 1 lennessy said he is interest
ed in reviewing a series of suggested reforms put forth by
Education Secretary Margaret Spellings last month, a list
that includes retooling financial aid and increased focus
on science education.
"It is a beneficial exercise to stop and examine the
state of U.S. higher education and what can be done to im
prove our colleges and universities." Hennessy wrote in
an email to The Daily. "The report made a number of rec
ommendations and merits further review, but several of
their recommendations appear to be worthy of serious
consideration in the near term."
The recommendations include calls for increased fed
eral investment in student financial aid. increased federal
investment in science, technology, engineering and math
ematics (STEM) fields and a database for colleges and
universities to swap ideas and pool experience.
Higher education has long been the domain of states
and private interests, with the federal government largely
staying out of the way. Hut recent studies have highlight
ed increasing tuition costs, inequality for economically
disadvantaged applicants and poor graduation rates
across the country. While nearly two-thirds of high school
graduates enroll in a two- or four-year college, more than
40 percent drop out .The Department of Education report
demonstrated that even literacy capacity and reading
comprehension are declining amongst college graduates.
While Stanford does not suffer from these most of
these shortcomings, the administration and Board of
Trustees are moving to address some of these concerns,
especially those regarding college preparation for K-12
students.
"I agree that this is a serious national problem and I
believe that our nation's leading universities need to play
an important role in bringing improvement to our na
tion's schools," Hennessy said. "To that end. we have re
cently announced a $20 million loan forgiveness program
to offset the eost for students who
enroll in yearlong Stanford Teacher
Education Program."
Chief among Spellings' concerns
was the inequality of the financial aid
system, pointing to the complicated
aid application process. The depart
ment's report outlined a plan to
work with states to use existing in
come and tax data to help students
complete the application for federal
aid in significantly less time.
I lennessy agreed with Spellings'
concerns over financial aid. but em
phasized Stanford's ongoing com
mitment to need-based applicants.
"Stanford is one of a handful of
colleges and universities that has
maintained its commitment to need
based financial aid and. as a result,
we have put programs in place that
allow us to attract the best students
regardless of their ability," he said.
Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper said she was aware of the
current complexities and was sup
portive of efforts to reduce these am
biguities.
"We would like to see a thought
ful review of federal application
forms and policies as suggested by

Secretary Spellings," Cooper said.
"The strongest step the federal gov
ernment can take to support access
for low-income students is to in
crease the value of the federal Pell
Grant as recommended by the com
mission."
ITiis fall. 1 lennessy took a step to
ward implementing a more flexible
financial aid program by eliminating
financial contributions for families
with incomes below $45,000.
"This was an effort to reach out to
those low-income students who find
the financial aid process intimidating
and confusing in an effort to encour
age them to apply and investigate the
opportunities available to them."
Cooper said.
Data from the 2005-06 academic
year shows that Stanford undergrad
uates received nearly $76 million in
scholarship aid from an array of I Ini
versity sources. This contrasts with
the slightly more than $5 million that
Stanford students received in federal
assistance, I lennessy said.
In her report. Spellings also en
couraged the creation of an informa
tion-sharing database to allow col
leges and universities to learn what

their peer institutions are doing to
address universal issues like finan
cial aid and grade inflation. Spellings
argued that a Web site allowing in
depth comparisons between schools,
ranging from student progress to
teacher salaries, could be useful.
The database has been met with
some support on the national level,
but others in the education commu
nity are worried that too much cohe
sion could jeopardize the individual
ity of schools.
"1 will monitor carefully new fed
eral efforts to collect data." Senator
Lamar Alexander (R-TN), a former
president of the University of Ten
nessee and one-time U.S. education
secretary under President George H.
W. Bush, said in a press statement
following the department's report.
"Information for consumers is a
good thing. But American higher ed
ucation does not need a barrage of
new regulations imposing new costs
so someone in Washington can try to
figure out how to improve the Har
vard classics department and
Nashville Auto Diesel College —
both of whose students are eligible
lor federal grants and loans."
