## Internationals face uphill battle for aid University hopes to soon extend needblind aid policy to internationals 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
University financial aid has received an increasing
amount of attention across the nation in recent months —
from Harvard and Princeton's decision to drop early ad
missions because of its alleged advantage to affluent stu
dents to a report from Education Secretary Margaret
Spellings that the aid application process is too complex.
And while Stanford boasts its need-blind financial aid
program and its decision last spring to waive tuition re
quirements for families making under $4.\(K)() a year, the
University is not as generous to international applicants.
Unlike the procedure for American citizens and per
manent residents.an international applicant must declare
from the outset whether he or she is asking for financial
aid. Applicants that do not pursue financial aid go through
the same process as domestic applicants, though they
must provide proof that they can af
ford to attend, if accepted. And these
students are barred from seeking fi
nancial aid at a later date, regardless
of any change in their economic cir
cumstances.
Those international applicants
who do ask for financial aid are put
into a separate pool. Director of Fi
nancial Aid Karen Cooper described
the process as highly competitive.
"For international students, es
sentially what happens is that early
in the process the financial aid office
tells the admission office the amount
of money that we can give for aid,"
Cooper said. "So there's some back
and forth of "do these students fit.'
We are very much paying attention
to the dollar amount of these stu
dents. Basically we're not going to
admit a student that we can't commit
to funding."
Stanford will not admit an inter
national applicant who requests fi
nancial aid unless that aid can be
granted, hut there is only $1.5 million
dollars of financial aid available for
international undergraduate stu
dents. In recent years, only about 35
incoming international students re
ceived aid.
Cihan Baran. a junior from
Turkey who did not seek financial
aid, said everyone from his high
school, the prestigious Koch School
in Istanbul, that applied for financial
aid from Stanford was rejected.
"Most people know that asking
for financial aid strictly limits your
chances," Baran said. "That's the

general sentiment. If you're applying
to some school like Stanford and
you're asking for financial aid. the
college counselor will tell you not to
be hopeful."
Cooper argued that financial con
trols out of the University's hands
prevent international students from
receiving the same consideration as
other applicants.
"It's very different from the fund
ing for domestic students in that the
institutional funds are the only funds
we have available to us," Cooper
said, "while for domestic students,
there are federal loans and state
grants that we have available to
make up their need."
Another difference is how that
aid is awarded. Cooper said.
"If they come from Western Eu
rope or Canada, countries where
they are going to have the ability to
make payments on loans once they
finish their education, we do expect
them to borrow. But from develop
ing countries where it is impossible
for them to return home and make
payments on a loan, they don't have
a loan component in their financial
package."
In recent years, financial aid for
international students has increased.
Though 35 aid recipients may seem
small, five years ago only 20 students
were admitted with financial aid.
And President John Hennessy an
nounced last year that he wants Stan
ford to be need-blind for interna
tional students by 2010.
But there is still a large disparity

between aid for domestic and inter
national students. Financial aid to in
ternational students, who make up 6
percent of the undergraduate stu
dent body and roughly 10 percent of
the applicant pool, is supported by a
mix of special endowments and un
restricted funds assigned to that pur
pose by the University. However, the
fund for domestic applicants is
roughly $6h million dollars, more
than 40 times the $1.5 million allot
ted to international students.
