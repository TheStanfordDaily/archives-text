# World & Nation NEWS ANALYSIS The Other War
## 
### MICHAEL WILKERSON 
There is no industry to speak of. and agricultural output
has been decimated by ongoing war. The main inputs of
cash are foreign aid and opium production.
The Taliban forcefully prohibited poppy growing, and
brought the opium trade to a standstill. But production sky
rocketed after the 2(X)1 invasion. The coalition forces are
placed in an awkward position — trying to decrease what is
seen as a drug trade without offering a viable alternative.
The drug production has sustained a class of war
lords who provide a limited degree of protection and
economic security to those in their dominion. These
strongmen have been resistant to the stronger national
government.
Ali said establishing security and stability must be the
first priority. Without it.he said, attempts at democracy
and economic growth will be severely handicapped.
"If people are feeling insecure and face famine, then
they will feel no difference between the totalitarian
regime of the Taliban and the democratic government of
Hamid Karzai" said Ali. who speaks Fashto. one of
Afghanistan's main languages.
He said the consequences of failure are great.
"In the current scenario," Ali said,"not onl\ the future
of Afghanistan but simultaneously the U.S. role as world
leader and the future of NATO are at stake."
MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY

Ever wonder what happened to Afghanistan?
After Sept. 11, it was the first campaign in America's
"War on Terror."
But observers fret that the focus on the insurgency in
Iraq, the fighting in Lebanon over the summer and North
Korea's apparent nuclear test last week have distracted
Americans from the worsening situation on the ground
in Afghanistan.
The past year has seen a major rebirth of the Taliban,
steady increases in lighting and significant growth in
opium harvests.
"I think that Afghanistan is passing through its worst
period of violence since the U.S. led invasion," said Imitaz
Ali. a reporter for the BBC in Pakistan and a Knight Fel
low at the University this year.
"Suicide attacks were a totally unknown phenomenon
in the Afghan conflict until a few months ago." he said.
"But now it has become almost a daily routine."
LACK OF CONTROL
Much of the violence revolves around the Taliban,
which though soundly beaten by coalition forces in 2(X)2,
has come back to haunt international troops and Presi
dent Hamid Karzai's government.
"Many of the fighters opposing Hamid Karzai and
foreign forces have adopted the banner of the Taliban as
a rallying symbol, even if they are not under the com
mand of a unified Taliban leadership," said History Prof.
Robert Crews, a specialist on central Asia and Islam.
The Taliban, involved in major clashes with NATO
and coalition forces, has claimed responsibility for a large
number of recent attacks. NATO leaders estimate there
are between four and five thousand active Taliban fight
ers in the country.
Lt. General David Richards, commander of NATO
forces in Afghanistan, maintains the renewed strength of
the rebels should not indicate that the general population
supports the group.
"This is not a huge popular uprising." Richards told
the New York Times last week. "People do not want a re
turn to the Taliban."
The Taliban is largely aligned with the majority Pash
tun ethnic group concentrated in the south of the coun
try. and has historically clashed with minority groups in
the North like the Tajiks and Uzbeks. The U.S. backed
government led b\ Karzai is structured to share power
between the groups.
Crews agrees with the military leadership that theTal
iban would not be welcomed back into power.
"While neo-Taliban have deployed new tactics, by
drawing on the expertise of Iraqi insurgents and perhaps
al-Qaida (who have offered training in car bombings and
improvised explosive devices), their aim is. like the origi
nal Taliban, to appeal to and mobilize Pashtuns," he said.
Still, dissatisfaction with both the Afghan government
and its foreign sponsors is prevalent across ethnic and
tribal alignments. Crews pointed to demonstrations in
May by Tajiks in Kabul even though they hold many of
the most powerful government positions.
Security is one of the major grievances. There are
31.(KM) international troops in Afghanistan. 12.(XX) arc
Americans recently transferred under NATO control.
Additionally, the U.S. still directly controls about 10.(XX)
soldiers, but these lorces have never been large enough to
stabilize the country.
While Americans have kept the capital relatively se
cure. the warlords have allowed insurgents to wreak
havoc in the countryside.
As a result. Karzai is called the"The Mayor of Kabul."
American and NATO commanders have requested
more troops but requests have been denied.
ECONOMIC WOES FEED VIOLENCE
The shaky economy is blamed by observers for slow
ing the path to a lasting peace. Years of relative calm
under the Taliban were preceded by a decade of civil war
and years of Russian occupation.

Inhere is a spreading concern that the
U.S. is letting its chance to "fix"
Afghanistan slip away.

"The U.S. does not seem to
have a policy," said Crews, who
worries America may not

leave the country tri
umphantly.
He emphasized that the
Soviets suffered an embar
rassing defeat and were
forced to withdraw after 10
years of bloody and costly
occupation. The Bush ad
ministration seems unwill
ing to commit the same
level of force that the .
Russians did. '

Bringing peace and
democracy to

Afghanistan would require
creative strategies. Crews said,
like trying to harness opium farming
for legal pharmaceutical uses.

"But the fate of Afghanistan since 2001 has become so
tied up with domestic American politics that any truly
imaginative solutions appear to be beyond the capacity

Remember Afghanistan?
A resurging Taliban, despondent economy and rising violence hurt prospects for peace and democracy

of American elites of either political party" he said.
"It is doubtful that they will admit to themselves that
Afghanistan has been lost."

The Taliban forcefully prohibited poppy growing, and
brought the opium trade to a standstill. But production sky
rocketed after the 2(X)1 invasion. The coalition forces are
placed in an awkward position — trying to decrease what is
seen as a drug trade without offering a viable alternative.
The drug production has sustained a class of war
lords who provide a limited degree of protection and
economic security to those in their dominion. These
strongmen have been resistant to the stronger national
government.
Ali said establishing security and stability must be the
first priority. Without it.he said, attempts at democracy
and economic growth will be severely handicapped.
"If people are feeling insecure and face famine, then
they will feel no difference between the totalitarian
regime of the Taliban and the democratic government of
Hamid Karzai" said Ali. who speaks Fashto. one of
Afghanistan's main languages.
He said the consequences of failure are great.
"In the current scenario," Ali said,"not onl\ the future
of Afghanistan but simultaneously the U.S. role as world
leader and the future of NATO are at stake."
MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY

Ever wonder what happened to Afghanistan?
After Sept. 11, it was the first campaign in America's
"War on Terror."
But observers fret that the focus on the insurgency in
Iraq, the fighting in Lebanon over the summer and North
Korea's apparent nuclear test last week have distracted
Americans from the worsening situation on the ground
in Afghanistan.
The past year has seen a major rebirth of the Taliban,
steady increases in lighting and significant growth in
opium harvests.
"I think that Afghanistan is passing through its worst
period of violence since the U.S. led invasion," said Imitaz
Ali. a reporter for the BBC in Pakistan and a Knight Fel
low at the University this year.
"Suicide attacks were a totally unknown phenomenon
in the Afghan conflict until a few months ago." he said.
"But now it has become almost a daily routine."
LACK OF CONTROL
Much of the violence revolves around the Taliban,
which though soundly beaten by coalition forces in 2(X)2,
has come back to haunt international troops and Presi
dent Hamid Karzai's government.
"Many of the fighters opposing Hamid Karzai and
foreign forces have adopted the banner of the Taliban as
a rallying symbol, even if they are not under the com
mand of a unified Taliban leadership," said History Prof.
Robert Crews, a specialist on central Asia and Islam.
The Taliban, involved in major clashes with NATO
and coalition forces, has claimed responsibility for a large
number of recent attacks. NATO leaders estimate there
are between four and five thousand active Taliban fight
ers in the country.
Lt. General David Richards, commander of NATO
forces in Afghanistan, maintains the renewed strength of
the rebels should not indicate that the general population
supports the group.
"This is not a huge popular uprising." Richards told
the New York Times last week. "People do not want a re
turn to the Taliban."
The Taliban is largely aligned with the majority Pash
tun ethnic group concentrated in the south of the coun
try. and has historically clashed with minority groups in
the North like the Tajiks and Uzbeks. The U.S. backed
government led b\ Karzai is structured to share power
between the groups.
Crews agrees with the military leadership that theTal
iban would not be welcomed back into power.
"While neo-Taliban have deployed new tactics, by
drawing on the expertise of Iraqi insurgents and perhaps
al-Qaida (who have offered training in car bombings and
improvised explosive devices), their aim is. like the origi
nal Taliban, to appeal to and mobilize Pashtuns," he said.
Still, dissatisfaction with both the Afghan government
and its foreign sponsors is prevalent across ethnic and
tribal alignments. Crews pointed to demonstrations in
May by Tajiks in Kabul even though they hold many of
the most powerful government positions.
Security is one of the major grievances. There are
31.(KM) international troops in Afghanistan. 12.(XX) arc
Americans recently transferred under NATO control.
Additionally, the U.S. still directly controls about 10.(XX)
soldiers, but these lorces have never been large enough to
stabilize the country.
While Americans have kept the capital relatively se
cure. the warlords have allowed insurgents to wreak
havoc in the countryside.
As a result. Karzai is called the"The Mayor of Kabul."
American and NATO commanders have requested
more troops but requests have been denied.
ECONOMIC WOES FEED VIOLENCE
The shaky economy is blamed by observers for slow
ing the path to a lasting peace. Years of relative calm
under the Taliban were preceded by a decade of civil war
and years of Russian occupation.

Inhere is a spreading concern that the
U.S. is letting its chance to "fix"
Afghanistan slip away.

"The U.S. does not seem to
have a policy," said Crews, who
worries America may not

leave the country tri
umphantly.
He emphasized that the
Soviets suffered an embar
rassing defeat and were
forced to withdraw after 10
years of bloody and costly
occupation. The Bush ad
ministration seems unwill
ing to commit the same
level of force that the .
Russians did. '

Bringing peace and
democracy to

Afghanistan would require
creative strategies. Crews said,
like trying to harness opium farming
for legal pharmaceutical uses.

"But the fate of Afghanistan since 2001 has become so
tied up with domestic American politics that any truly
imaginative solutions appear to be beyond the capacity

A resurging Taliban, despondent economy and rising violence hurt prospects for peace and democracy

of American elites of either political party" he said.
"It is doubtful that they will admit to themselves that
Afghanistan has been lost."
