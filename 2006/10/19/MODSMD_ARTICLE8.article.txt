# GRADUATE STUDENT COUNCIL
## GSC attends to community life Council to launch new surveys to tap into graduate opinions 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After spending almost $10,000
last week, the Graduate Student
Council decided last night to give
their pocketbook a break.
Instead, they spent most of their
time discussing the overall state of the
graduate community — announcing
the first graduate-student survey in
five years, meeting with representa
tives from two University offices and
ironing out details for the annual
Thanksgiving Dinner for graduate
students.
GSC Co-chair Jenny Allen an
nounced that the GSC was putting to
gether a new survey targeted to the
entire graduate-student population.
The last time such a broad survey was
done was in 2001.
"We need to better understand the
graduate community — their demo
graphics, their finances, their advoca
cy needs and their programming
needs — to serve them better." said
Rebecca Kaplan, a second-year busi
ness student in charge of organizing
the survey who "used to do this for a
living."
Kaplan asked for 10 questions
from each GSC advocacy committee
that will then be compiled and edited
for the final survey, which will be con
ducted online. She also suggested the

GSC offer incentives to ensure peo
ple take the survey.
Chris Griffith. Ken 1 Isu and Andy
Hernandez, all from the Graduate
Life Office (GLO), introduced them
selves to the GSC and discussed fu
ture collaboration with the GSC.
GLO is an office within that of the
Vice Provost for Student Affairs.
One area in need of work. GLO
and GSC representatives agreed, are
the concerns of off-campus graduate
students.
"We want to incorporate off-cam
pus students into the life on campus,"
said Griffith, director of GLO.
Hernandez, assistant dean of stu
dents. pointed out that more informa
tion is needed about off-campus grad
uate students with children.
"The University has no idea who is
out there with children," he said.
Hsu, meanwhile, added that just
bringing together the graduate com
munity was difficult.
"With undergrads, people start to
gether as freshmen and then go to
separate departments," he said. "With
graduate students, it is the opposite.
We have to figure out how to bring
people in different departments to
gether."
The GSC also decided to collabo
rate with GLO on instituting a
"cadre" of student conflict mediators
and on developing more leadership
programming.
When the newly created office of
the Vice Provost of Graduate Educa
tion (VPGE)came up. however, there
was no clear answer.
"We're not sure yet," Hernandez
said, when asked how GLO plans to
work with the VPGE. "It will be a

transition over the next couple
months."
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center, also
made an appearance at last night's
meeting, discussing the role of the
Center on campus and answering
questions about federal regulation on
international students.
I le said that approximately 60 new
federal regulations came into effect
after Sept. 11, and was aware that
these rules worried many internation
al students.
"On one hand, we don't want them
to worry," Pearson said. "But on the
other, we do need to tell them there is
this climate in the United States."This
"climate," he added, has brought
more attention on international stu
dents over the last five years.
While there was much talk last
night, there was very little cash being
thrown around.
As compared to last week's spend
ing spree, the GSC only handed out
$500 last night, money that went to
the Halloween party Elm Street Mur
ders, hosted by Chi ITieta Chi.
The GSC did. however, discuss the
upcoming ITianksgiving dinner for
graduate students, for which $45,000
has been allocated.
After receiving complaints from
graduate families last year that the
venue of Wilbur dining hall was not
family-friendly, the GSC decided to
make sure there was an area especial
ly for families at this year's dinner.
Three possible caterers were also
discussed for the food. Stanford Din
ing. which provided the food at last
year's dinner, submitted the lowest
bid this year.
