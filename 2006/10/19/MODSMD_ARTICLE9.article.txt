## Editorial Board The 						choice between "Fun" and "fun" 
### 
T "V espite the fact that the date for
9 the 2006 Mausoleum Party has
already been set. we have he
come cynical enough as a result of past
Mausoleum disappointments to believe
that the party will not happen even next
year unless real change takes place with re
gards to party planning and organization
the responsibility lies with both student
leaders and the administration." That is
what the Editorial Board wrote around this
time last year, after learning that the Mau
soleum Party would remain in the grave for
at least one more year after plans to resur
rect it didn't cohere in time.
OK. we will spare you the puns. Hut suf
fice to say it looks like the party is back for
good this time.
Poor class of'o6.They are destined to re
main the only graduating class in over two
decades that will not have seen a Mau
soleum party during any of its four years.
One commentator posted the following
succinct analysis on The Daily's Web site: "1
think we can categorically state that the
Stanford administration, the Stanford com
munity. nay, even the world at large have
spent the last four years conspiring how to
make the class of '06 miserable." Unfortu
nately, with the bike ban. Band Run
changes, a losing football season and a re
markably subdued Full Moon on the Ouad
(let's not even get into world events), the
class of '07 was beginning to feel the same
way Will the generous gesture from Hie
President's Fund. President John Hen
nessy's discretionary programming budget,
dissipate this gathering cloud of bad feel
ings? Not entirely, but it's a step.
Undergraduates and graduates alike are
grateful that Hie President's l und rose to
the occasion, as well as ASSI) Executives
Elizabeth Heng and Lauren Graham, who
made sure things came together this time.

We think the fact that the President's
Office had to intervene at all. instead of
Absolute Fun. which has a budget for these
types of things, gives evidence of the latter
group's ineffectiveness. Not since Presi
dent Bush's "Clean Air Act" have we seen
such spectacularly deceptive misnaming.
Perhaps "University-Sanctioned Fun" or
"Fun-by-Committee" would have been
more apt. We join ASSU President I leng in
expressing our hope that the Mausoleum
Party will avoid the presence of hoards of
police and administrators that made many
participants of Band Run and Full Moon
on the Ouad feel like political protesters
surrounded and constrained to a small
area.
Heng also warned that, "If students
drink too much, we won't be able to contin
ue this tradition." We won't follow her on
that one, true as it may be. This kind of atti
tude makes students feel as if they are on
constant probation. In fact, we don't think
that recent classes have been markedly
worse than previous years, and there's no
reason they should feel that way.
Rather, the intense scrutiny on such stu
dent social events stems from an increasing
ly litigious culture, from stricter enforce
ment measures that catch more bad behav
ior (generally a good thing, but not when
the I 'niversity uses it to prove how "bad"
the current crop of students is), and from
the increased coverage of collegiate culture
in the national media.
Telling students that almost all of Stan
ford s cherished social traditions are hang
ing on by a thread will only lead to anxiety
and resentment, not better behavior. Can't
we just leave it at."l lave fun and be safe"?
We're not looking for an expensive,
over-produced spectacle. We're just looking
for some "fun" with a lowercase "112." We
hope the Mausoleum Party "f'-its the bill.
