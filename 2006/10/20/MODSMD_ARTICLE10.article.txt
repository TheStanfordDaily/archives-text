### MANEESHA LIMAYE 
Organizers and attendees hailed Stanford s
fifth annual National C 'oming ()ut I )ay in White
Plaza yesterday afternoon as a success, praising
University support for the gay,lesbian,bisexual
and transgender community on campus.
National Coming Out Day (NCOD) was
founded in memory of the first march for gay
and lesbian rights, held in l ( )X7 in Washington
DC.
Event coordinator Nicole Hartfield, a
sophomore, explained that although the offi

cial NCOD is celebrated on Oct. 11, the
I ,GB I Community Resource Center decided
to observe it a week later because of the late
start of Stanford's autumn quarter.
George Morris, a junior and the event's
other coordinator, said. "Personally, 1 think
the events objective is to teach Stanford stu
dents and faculty the meaning of 'being' or
'coming out' with respect to issues that extend
beyond the queer definition."
The event included performances by Stan
ford Spoken Word and loudspeakers project
ing recordings of students' coming out stories.
" I really do believe in the message of a safe
space for all identities," said senior Jessica
Lewis, a member of Spoken Word. "The
theme Tace Yourself is not just about sexual
ity; it can be about issues like race or cultural
identity. It's really about everything."
2005 graduate Marlon Footracer. a Native
American.said he found strength and comfort

for his coming out by reciting a Navajo prayer
entitled "Beauty Way Chant."
"It's a chant you say to make yourself bal
anced and whole," he said, "a way to create
harmony and peace within yourself."
Whether people came to mingle, eat food or
hear their classmates narrate their struggles and
triumphs, students said they sensed a feeling of
solidarity and support among participants.
"The gay community is so open and proud
here." said freshman Teak Sowaprux, who
represented the Queer Asian Society at the
event."It really does feel like a family."
Morris said he was also impressed with the
level of participation and attendance.
"It's important to have events like these
year after year," he said."to introduce and in
vite our newest students and faculty to recog
nize and respect that diversity is an important
