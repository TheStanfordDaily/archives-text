## Editorial Board Women in higher ed: A constant struggle 
### 
Six months ago, a seasoned reporter at
the New York Times published a
provocative expose entitled "At Col
leges. Women Are Leaving Men in the
Dust." In the article, writer Tamar Lewin
reported that women now make up a signif
k mt majority <>n college campuses nation
wide a statistic that holds for all but the
very highest income bracket. Citing figures
trom the Department of Education, she
highlighted that in contrast to men. women
are more likely to receive bachelor's de
grees. more likely to complete their degrees
in four or five years and more likely to re
ceive honors. In past years, this growing
gender gap in university attendance and
performance lias led some in the popular
media to declare a "boy crisis." However,
the scholais Lewin cited were dismissive of
such a phenomenon. As she stressed, the
success of women at the collegiate level
conies with one important caveat: while un
dergraduate women may outperform men
scholastically. there is a steep drop-off after
graduation.
1 lie same women who earn better
grades, take more honors courses and com
plete more internships are dominated on
the professional playing field by their male
counterparts. In just about every major
lield. including business, law and medicine,
and especially in male dominated disci
plines such as engineering, women hold a
small minority of leadership positions and
consistently earn less than men — even
while working in the same positions. Al
though similar numbers of men and women
enter medical school and law school, fewer
women enter and complete graduate school
overall,and even fewer become full-fledged
professors, a disparity that is especially
marked in the sciences. According to a
panel of experts recently convened by the
National Academy of Sciences, women

make up approximately 30 percent of doc
torates in the social and behavioral sci
ences, but less than 15 percent of the profes
sors in the same fields. The life sciences
have similar statistics and are the only other
field within science and engineering to
boast percentages in the double digits.
At Stanford, the percentage of female
members faculty hovers around 24 percent,
an increase of seven percent over the last 10
years. This is consistent with the statistic at
top research universities, where males com
prise on average well over 70 percent of lac
ulty. Although Stanford prides itself on its
efforts to recruit and retain diverse faculty,
women are still vastly underrepresented,
particularly in tenure tracks. In our engi
neering departments, women faculty are
practically nonexistent. Iliis trend is not pe
culiar to academia. One need only browse
the most recent statistics on the number of
women leading Fortune 500 companies
(eight) or representing their respective
states in the United States Senate (14), to
confirm that while strides have certainly
been made since feminism's heyday in the
seventies, true gender equity is still a long
way off.
ITie question of why that is still draws
considerable attention. A little over a year
ago. Louise Story, a young reporter at
Lewin's publication wrote a very different
sort of article which broached this conun
drum, "Many Women at Elite Colleges Set
Career Path to Motherhood." Drawing on
extensive research she had conducted at
Yale and other Ivy League institutions.
Story reported on a new trend she saw
emerging: that of top notch female students
rejecting career paths in leadership for the
more traditional role of stay-at home
mother. In fact, roughly 60 percent of the
hundreds of undergraduate women
she interviewed said that when they
became mothers, they planned to cut
back on work or stop working com
pletely. Many said that they would
not pursue tenure tracks or did not
intend to become CEOs; the priority
<>1 motherhood trumped their educa
tional or work-related goals.
This is a complex problem. While
first-generation feminists declared
the duty of each woman to work full
time as a productive member of soci
ety. later generations of women have
questioned the price their children
pay when left in the care of round
the-clock nannies. Perhaps the last
ing impact of the feminist movement
has not been to impart a value on
women's work but rather to present
women with a choice: the choice of
whether to pursue work — or not. If
Story's study is any indication, many
women of our generation are reeval
uating that choice. Though ideally
the role of primary caregiver could
be played by either parent, the de
fault is still the woman. Even when
women work full-time jobs, labor
statistics have shown that they carry
the bulk of domestic responsibilities.
Ihere remains a great deal of socie

tal pressure for women to fulfill what
is seen as their traditional role.
The competing pressures be
tween career and family have at
times put women in a double bind.
Decades ago, many graduate schools
rejected qualified female applicants
on the grounds that female alumni,
many ot them stay at home mothers,
were not putting their degrees to use.
By their logic, it made little sense to
invest in an individual who would
not make "good" on that investment.
The same sort of bias is still perva
sive in hiring practices. Companies
ask: Why hire someone who will quit
five years down the line? Why hire
someone with no aspirations for
leadership? Such underlying preju
dice is typical of the kind that can so
frustrate women who aspire to
something other than simply the de
mands of motherhood. Even when
women do succeed in advancing,
many face challenging assumptions
about their intentions or their talent.
In this respect, Stanford's gradu
ate program in Chemistry has been a
model for positive change. Last year,
the department implemented a new
policy to accommodate pregnant
graduate students in the post-partum
period. Acknowledging the gender
asymmetries intrinsic to childbearing
and child care, the new department
policy allows young mothers to main
tain lull-time student status while
taking a 12 week maternity leave and

facilitates the subsequent return to
work. Independent of the depart
ment. the Stanford Chemistry
Women's Committee on Graduate
Life provides quarterly seminars
called "Perspectives" which provides
students with successful and innova
tive female role models. ITie student
group provides a much needed sup
port network while the policy gives
women the power to have it both
ways: to be both mother and student.
Following the lead of the Chem
istry Department, the associate dean
of graduate policy. Professor Gail
Mahood. recently unveiled a univer
sity wide policy for graduate moth
ers. Under the new policy, all gradu
ate women are now given six weeks
paid maternity leave while maintain
ing full-time student status. lTiis is
certainly a step in the right direction,
but there is still much work to be
done. With thoughtful policy reform,
departments in every field can open
doors to women to help bridge the
divide. While we cannot control the
systemic problems that contribute to
that gap in the first place. Stanford
can continue to make the conscious
decision to accommodate women in
every aspect of university life. For a
student or faculty member here, the
choice between a career or a child
should never have to be an
"either/or" decision. Motherhood
need not be a glass ceiling to educa
tional pursuits.

back on work or stop working com
pletely. Many said that they would
not pursue tenure tracks or did not
intend to become CEOs; the priority
<>1 motherhood trumped their educa
tional or work-related goals.
This is a complex problem. While
first-generation feminists declared
the duty of each woman to work full
time as a productive member of soci
ety. later generations of women have
questioned the price their children
pay when left in the care of round
the-clock nannies. Perhaps the last
ing impact of the feminist movement
has not been to impart a value on
women's work but rather to present
women with a choice: the choice of
whether to pursue work — or not. If
Story's study is any indication, many
women of our generation are reeval
uating that choice. Though ideally
the role of primary caregiver could
be played by either parent, the de
fault is still the woman. Even when
women work full-time jobs, labor
statistics have shown that they carry
the bulk of domestic responsibilities.
Ihere remains a great deal of socie

tal pressure for women to fulfill what
is seen as their traditional role.
The competing pressures be
tween career and family have at
times put women in a double bind.
Decades ago, many graduate schools
rejected qualified female applicants
on the grounds that female alumni,
many ot them stay at home mothers,
were not putting their degrees to use.
By their logic, it made little sense to
invest in an individual who would
not make "good" on that investment.
The same sort of bias is still perva
sive in hiring practices. Companies
ask: Why hire someone who will quit
five years down the line? Why hire
someone with no aspirations for
leadership? Such underlying preju
dice is typical of the kind that can so
frustrate women who aspire to
something other than simply the de
mands of motherhood. Even when
women do succeed in advancing,
many face challenging assumptions
about their intentions or their talent.
In this respect, Stanford's gradu
ate program in Chemistry has been a
model for positive change. Last year,
the department implemented a new
policy to accommodate pregnant
graduate students in the post-partum
period. Acknowledging the gender
asymmetries intrinsic to childbearing
and child care, the new department
policy allows young mothers to main
tain lull-time student status while
taking a 12 week maternity leave and

facilitates the subsequent return to
work. Independent of the depart
ment. the Stanford Chemistry
Women's Committee on Graduate
Life provides quarterly seminars
called "Perspectives" which provides
students with successful and innova
tive female role models. ITie student
group provides a much needed sup
port network while the policy gives
women the power to have it both
ways: to be both mother and student.
Following the lead of the Chem
istry Department, the associate dean
of graduate policy. Professor Gail
Mahood. recently unveiled a univer
sity wide policy for graduate moth
ers. Under the new policy, all gradu
ate women are now given six weeks
paid maternity leave while maintain
ing full-time student status. lTiis is
certainly a step in the right direction,
but there is still much work to be
done. With thoughtful policy reform,
departments in every field can open
doors to women to help bridge the
divide. While we cannot control the
systemic problems that contribute to
that gap in the first place. Stanford
can continue to make the conscious
decision to accommodate women in
every aspect of university life. For a
student or faculty member here, the
choice between a career or a child
should never have to be an
"either/or" decision. Motherhood
need not be a glass ceiling to educa
tional pursuits.
Six months ago, a seasoned reporter at
the New York Times published a
provocative expose entitled "At Col
leges. Women Are Leaving Men in the
Dust." In the article, writer Tamar Lewin
reported that women now make up a signif
k mt majority <>n college campuses nation
wide a statistic that holds for all but the
very highest income bracket. Citing figures
trom the Department of Education, she
highlighted that in contrast to men. women
are more likely to receive bachelor's de
grees. more likely to complete their degrees
in four or five years and more likely to re
ceive honors. In past years, this growing
gender gap in university attendance and
performance lias led some in the popular
media to declare a "boy crisis." However,
the scholais Lewin cited were dismissive of
such a phenomenon. As she stressed, the
success of women at the collegiate level
conies with one important caveat: while un
dergraduate women may outperform men
scholastically. there is a steep drop-off after
graduation.
1 lie same women who earn better
grades, take more honors courses and com
plete more internships are dominated on
the professional playing field by their male
counterparts. In just about every major
lield. including business, law and medicine,
and especially in male dominated disci
plines such as engineering, women hold a
small minority of leadership positions and
consistently earn less than men — even
while working in the same positions. Al
though similar numbers of men and women
enter medical school and law school, fewer
women enter and complete graduate school
overall,and even fewer become full-fledged
professors, a disparity that is especially
marked in the sciences. According to a
panel of experts recently convened by the
National Academy of Sciences, women

make up approximately 30 percent of doc
torates in the social and behavioral sci
ences, but less than 15 percent of the profes
sors in the same fields. The life sciences
have similar statistics and are the only other
field within science and engineering to
boast percentages in the double digits.
At Stanford, the percentage of female
members faculty hovers around 24 percent,
an increase of seven percent over the last 10
years. This is consistent with the statistic at
top research universities, where males com
prise on average well over 70 percent of lac
ulty. Although Stanford prides itself on its
efforts to recruit and retain diverse faculty,
women are still vastly underrepresented,
particularly in tenure tracks. In our engi
neering departments, women faculty are
practically nonexistent. Iliis trend is not pe
culiar to academia. One need only browse
the most recent statistics on the number of
women leading Fortune 500 companies
(eight) or representing their respective
states in the United States Senate (14), to
confirm that while strides have certainly
been made since feminism's heyday in the
seventies, true gender equity is still a long
way off.
ITie question of why that is still draws
considerable attention. A little over a year
ago. Louise Story, a young reporter at
Lewin's publication wrote a very different
sort of article which broached this conun
drum, "Many Women at Elite Colleges Set
Career Path to Motherhood." Drawing on
extensive research she had conducted at
Yale and other Ivy League institutions.
Story reported on a new trend she saw
emerging: that of top notch female students
rejecting career paths in leadership for the
more traditional role of stay-at home
mother. In fact, roughly 60 percent of the
hundreds of undergraduate women
she interviewed said that when they
became mothers, they planned to cut
back on work or stop working com
pletely. Many said that they would
not pursue tenure tracks or did not
intend to become CEOs; the priority
<>1 motherhood trumped their educa
tional or work-related goals.
