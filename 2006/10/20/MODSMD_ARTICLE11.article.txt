## Editorial Board Women in higher ed: A constant struggle 
### 
Six months ago, a seasoned reporter at
the New York Times published a
provocative expose entitled "At Col
leges. Women Are Leaving Men in the
Dust." In the article, writer Tamar Lewin
reported that women now make up a signif
k mt majority <>n college campuses nation
wide a statistic that holds for all but the
very highest income bracket. Citing figures
trom the Department of Education, she
highlighted that in contrast to men. women
are more likely to receive bachelor's de
grees. more likely to complete their degrees
in four or five years and more likely to re
ceive honors. In past years, this growing
gender gap in university attendance and
performance lias led some in the popular
media to declare a "boy crisis." However,
the scholais Lewin cited were dismissive of
such a phenomenon. As she stressed, the
success of women at the collegiate level
conies with one important caveat: while un
dergraduate women may outperform men
scholastically. there is a steep drop-off after
graduation.
1 lie same women who earn better
grades, take more honors courses and com
plete more internships are dominated on
the professional playing field by their male
counterparts. In just about every major
lield. including business, law and medicine,
and especially in male dominated disci
plines such as engineering, women hold a
small minority of leadership positions and
consistently earn less than men â€” even
while working in the same positions. Al
though similar numbers of men and women
enter medical school and law school, fewer
women enter and complete graduate school
overall,and even fewer become full-fledged
professors, a disparity that is especially
marked in the sciences. According to a
panel of experts recently convened by the
National Academy of Sciences, women

make up approximately 30 percent of doc
torates in the social and behavioral sci
ences, but less than 15 percent of the profes
sors in the same fields. The life sciences
have similar statistics and are the only other
field within science and engineering to
boast percentages in the double digits.
At Stanford, the percentage of female
members faculty hovers around 24 percent,
an increase of seven percent over the last 10
years. This is consistent with the statistic at
top research universities, where males com
prise on average well over 70 percent of lac
ulty. Although Stanford prides itself on its
efforts to recruit and retain diverse faculty,
women are still vastly underrepresented,
particularly in tenure tracks. In our engi
neering departments, women faculty are
practically nonexistent. Iliis trend is not pe
culiar to academia. One need only browse
the most recent statistics on the number of
women leading Fortune 500 companies
(eight) or representing their respective
states in the United States Senate (14), to
confirm that while strides have certainly
been made since feminism's heyday in the
seventies, true gender equity is still a long
way off.
ITie question of why that is still draws
considerable attention. A little over a year
ago. Louise Story, a young reporter at
Lewin's publication wrote a very different
sort of article which broached this conun
drum, "Many Women at Elite Colleges Set
Career Path to Motherhood." Drawing on
extensive research she had conducted at
Yale and other Ivy League institutions.
Story reported on a new trend she saw
emerging: that of top notch female students
rejecting career paths in leadership for the
more traditional role of stay-at home
mother. In fact, roughly 60 percent of the
