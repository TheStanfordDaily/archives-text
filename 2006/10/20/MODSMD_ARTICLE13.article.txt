# The 						history of Stanford Dining, 1891-2006
## 
### 
When Stanford opened its doors in
1891. there were no dining halls.
Asa "Uncle John" Andrews shut
tled students in a carriage led by his horse
Marguerite from their dorms to Palo Alto
for meals.
Back in 1891. the town of Palo Alto was
nothing more than a train depot. Three
times a day and twice on Saturdays and Sun
days. the Central Pacific Railroad, which
I.eland owned and operated, rolled into
town with rations. Within a couple of
months, enough rug dealers had established
stores on University Avenue to make an
eatery profitable, and Chicken Pot Pie My
I lea it opened in 1892.
When the depression worsened in 1893
and there was no longer a chicken in every
pot pie, the restaurant settled on making
pizza and manufacturing Big Game t-shirts.
I lerbert I loover (class of 1895) was deeply
affected by this incident — so much so that
it intluenced his 1928 presidential cam
paign Ihe students egged and toilet pa
pered Marguerite to protest their meatless
diet until Jane Stanford relented and
slaughtered the last of the stock farm ani
mals foi the opening of Stanford's very own
Lagunita dining hall.
World War I saw the establishment of
"victory gardens." where vegetables like let
tuce and marijuana were grown. Columbae
was later built in the middle of this garden,
lb show its patriotism, which traditionally
takes the form of dissing the enemy country
or pretending like the country never exist
ed. the Lag dining staff renamed its ham
burgers "liberty sandwiches" and sauer
kraut "gas causing cabbage."
Jan 16,1920 was a dark day for Stanford
dining, when the Eighteenth Amendment,
known in common parlance as the "Getting
America ()ff the Jug" law. took effect. Din
ing halls stopped serving alcohol with their
meals, which had been tradition. Every
evening, dipsomaniac and Quaker David
Starr Jordan had proposed a toast to the
memory of the Stanfords over a glass of ar
senic-tinged sherry.
Thanks to Prohibition, however, two of
Stanford's favorite traditions,steam tunnel
ing and fountain hopping were introduced.
The steam tunnels were used for bootleg
ging. ()n any given night, one could hear the
underground screeches of black Fords,
shooting ot guns, and shattering of glass, just
like in the movies. Bathtub gin was. of
course, popular in the 19205, but because
there were no bathtubs on campus, foun
tains became the chosen storage place for
hard liquor. Fountain hopping was soon a
favorite Stanford pastime.

Alcohol is a depressant. Stanford students
have always known this deep down but to
this day refuse to admit it. It should he no
surprise, then, that following the alcoholic
debauchery of the roaring '20s. a Depres
sion occurred. With his "chicken in every
pot pie" campaign and his wife and fellow
Stanford alum Lou Henry at hand. Herbert
Hoover made it to the White I louse. During
his presidency Hoover solved the Depres
sion with bread lines. 1 le felt bread lines, or
B lines as they were called, were effective
because 1) standing in line numbs the brain
and 2) carbs make you happy.
War rations during World War II meant
that most of the campus started eating
Spam, except for a select few who pretend
ed to be allergic to fake ham and entered the
disabilities draw to live in a house with an
open kitchen.
Since Stanford facilities were used as
army training camps during World War 11.
there were many students and faculty mem
bers preparing for war.To train them for the
monotonous food on the battlefront, "Des
tination Dining" was introduced. There
were two destinations: "the South Pacific"
in Wilbur and "Europe" in l ag Dining. Food
at these two dining halls was served accord
ing to these themes, so Wilbur chefs became
quite adept at Asian cuisine and Lag Dining
started serving nothing but pasta.
In the aftermath of the war. Destination
Dining became less cool than it originally
seemed. With the beatniks of the 19505, the
CoHo opened and students stopped eating
in the dining halls altogether,with a diet that
consisted only of coffee and Jack Kerouac,
author of "On the Road," on which the very
first I HUM. "Epic Journeys, Modern
Quests," a.k.a. "Dean Moriarty, You a Ho."
was based in 1957. With the hippies of the
19605, most students packed their meals so
they could eat and protest at the same time.
During one memorable protest on Sept. 23,
1%7. ( olumbae caught fire and. as a result,
all of South campus was high for the next
two weeks.
In the 21 st century, we have looked to past
decades to bring back unflattering styles.

When Stanford opened its doors in
1891. there were no dining halls.
Asa "Uncle John" Andrews shut
tled students in a carriage led by his horse
Marguerite from their dorms to Palo Alto
for meals.
Back in 1891. the town of Palo Alto was
nothing more than a train depot. Three
times a day and twice on Saturdays and Sun
days. the Central Pacific Railroad, which
I.eland owned and operated, rolled into
town with rations. Within a couple of
months, enough rug dealers had established
stores on University Avenue to make an
eatery profitable, and Chicken Pot Pie My
I lea it opened in 1892.
When the depression worsened in 1893
and there was no longer a chicken in every
pot pie, the restaurant settled on making
pizza and manufacturing Big Game t-shirts.
I lerbert I loover (class of 1895) was deeply
affected by this incident — so much so that
it intluenced his 1928 presidential cam
paign Ihe students egged and toilet pa
pered Marguerite to protest their meatless
diet until Jane Stanford relented and
slaughtered the last of the stock farm ani
mals foi the opening of Stanford's very own
Lagunita dining hall.
World War I saw the establishment of
"victory gardens." where vegetables like let
tuce and marijuana were grown. Columbae
was later built in the middle of this garden,
lb show its patriotism, which traditionally
takes the form of dissing the enemy country
or pretending like the country never exist
ed. the Lag dining staff renamed its ham
burgers "liberty sandwiches" and sauer
kraut "gas causing cabbage."
Jan 16,1920 was a dark day for Stanford
dining, when the Eighteenth Amendment,
known in common parlance as the "Getting
America ()ff the Jug" law. took effect. Din
ing halls stopped serving alcohol with their
meals, which had been tradition. Every
evening, dipsomaniac and Quaker David
Starr Jordan had proposed a toast to the
memory of the Stanfords over a glass of ar
senic-tinged sherry.
Thanks to Prohibition, however, two of
Stanford's favorite traditions,steam tunnel
ing and fountain hopping were introduced.
The steam tunnels were used for bootleg
ging. ()n any given night, one could hear the
underground screeches of black Fords,
shooting ot guns, and shattering of glass, just
like in the movies. Bathtub gin was. of
course, popular in the 19205, but because
there were no bathtubs on campus, foun
tains became the chosen storage place for
hard liquor. Fountain hopping was soon a
favorite Stanford pastime.

Alcohol is a depressant. Stanford students
have always known this deep down but to
this day refuse to admit it. It should he no
surprise, then, that following the alcoholic
debauchery of the roaring '20s. a Depres
sion occurred. With his "chicken in every
pot pie" campaign and his wife and fellow
Stanford alum Lou Henry at hand. Herbert
Hoover made it to the White I louse. During
his presidency Hoover solved the Depres
sion with bread lines. 1 le felt bread lines, or
B lines as they were called, were effective
because 1) standing in line numbs the brain
and 2) carbs make you happy.
War rations during World War II meant
that most of the campus started eating
Spam, except for a select few who pretend
ed to be allergic to fake ham and entered the
disabilities draw to live in a house with an
open kitchen.
