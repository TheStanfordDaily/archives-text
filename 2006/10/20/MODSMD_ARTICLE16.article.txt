# Risk, rejection and the real world
## 
### 
Contrary to the belief held by most high
school seniors, the arrival of a particu
lar fat envelope does not mark the end
of the world's most painful application
process. Alongside the permission to enter
the ivory tower of higher education, the col
lege acceptance letter initiates an occasional
ly agonizing, frequently grueling bumpy road
known as the Avenue of Ups and Downs, the
Street of Dreams and Defeats, the Route of
Risk and Rejection and, for lack of a better
term, the 1 lighway of Life.
Sure, high school has its moments of po
tential disappointment: the talent show, var
sity soccer try-outs, scholarship applications,
the fabled popularity contest of Homecom
ing Court. But for all the tears you shed,
chances are. if you're here now. you probably
did fairly well during your first 18 years. Case
in point: several of my friends, who applied
early decision to Stanford, had never been
rejected when they drove down Palm Drive
lor the first time. One girl even managed to
avoid the college application process alto
gether: she was awarded a full athletic schol
arship in the first week of November. Need
less to say. the rest of the senior class stopped
talking to her until our own fates were
sealed.
Speaking of sealed fates, or at least the
fantasy of them, remember your beautiful
Stanford "S"-embossed folder which ex
tolled the virtues of your tireless dedication?
In case you've already forgotten, the same
packet also contained a number of addition
al forms for programs with funny acronyms
like I roSoCo and SLE. If Res Ed's marketing
ploys worked, little Amy Admit celebrated
her Stanford acceptance by beginning her
next round of applications.
Those who decided to steer clear of the
dubiously academic freshman housing may
have delayed their induction to the process,
but they were welcomed into the fold upon
dorm check-in. Somewhere in the 10x10
room lay a Stanford Bulletin,containing hun
dreds of exciting course descriptions. While
most of these courses offer open enrollment,
a select few come with a caveat or two. ITie
administration may be kind enough to move
the I lumßio core to Cubberley before reject
ing anyone, but there are limits to Stanford's
open-arms policy: freshman year, it's all
about the Introductory Seminars.
Day one of my Stanford career gave me a
chilling introduction to the dog-eat-dog way
of the Rejection/Acceptance Game. After I
had spent hours agonizing over my IntroSem
application, I determined that, aside from
I HUM and PWR's ancestor WCT, the course
"New Yorker Writers" was the only class

worth taking. From the doorway of an over
flowing classroom, the professor asked
everyone to go outside while she posted the
list of accepted students on the door; those
who made it were to come back in; those who
did not were asked to leave.
Although I was fortunate enough to be ac
cepted into the class (1 was right, by the way
— the class was. hands down, the best course
1 took at Stanford). I learned a painful lesson
that day; only those who apply to the popular
seminars face the risk of rejection. Risk
averse individuals need only wait for the sec
ond week of the quarter when the ad for un
filled seminars runs in The Daily.
Next up: the activities fair. From a cappel
la to spoken word, flamenco dancing to
rugby, the enticing tables set up in White
Plaza invite newcomers and seasoned vets
alike to try out for their next resume-padding
group. The problem, of course, is that the rest
of the applicant pool is comprised of Stan
ford students — not exactly the easiest kids
to beat.
So, you made it through your first year,
took an under-subscribed IntroSem and
joined some audition-free extracurriculars?
Interested in SoCo (that's Sophomore Col
lege, not Southern Comfort)? Studying
abroad? Going on an Alternative Spring
Break trip? Writing an Honors thesis? Get
ting funding for undergraduate research?
Unless you're one of those lucky people who
loves Russian or some other equally-obscure
academic subject, it's time to run the gauntlet
again. If, however, you happen to be from
South Dakota, you might be in luck. Another
Econ-related lesson; it's all about population
density. When I applied to (and was rejected
by) SoCo my freshman year, I just so hap
pened to be a member of the largest appli
cant pool — who knew there were so many
white, female fuzzies from California?
UROs and other research-related compe
titions introduce a new complicating factor:
money. Suddenly, there is something more at
stake than just your pride. Depending on
who you are, there may not be anything near
ly as valuable as your sense of self, but dollars
do have a way of upping the ante.
Those heightened stakes, of course, are

just a precursor to the real world version of
the Application Algorithm. For most fresh
men through juniors, the real world is only
visible several days a year when companies
descend upon campus for the free-product
giveaway known as the Career Fair, but once
your fourth October rolls around. Cardinal
Recruiting starts up and the heat is on. More
than any of its predecessors, the job search is
a daunting experience, perhaps because the
contest and its outcome are no longer the
side show. If you didn't make the Simps,
there's always next year. No luck with tour
guiding? Try writing for The Daily instead.
Didn't get a job during your senior year?
Time to move home with Mom and Dad.
Somehow, the last consolation prize is infi
nitely less appealing than the ones in the pre
vious scenarios.
In my senior year, I applied to work at
Google. Ignoring the fact that 1 was totally
unqualified for the position and had no de
sire to work eighty hours a week. 1 followed
every other scared lemming and headed to
Stanford Goes Corporate. Despite the Fri
day happy hours, the 1M volleyball, the din
ing halls and the "on-campus" speakers. I telt
like I was dressing up to play the part of an
adult. After five rounds of interviews,
stretching from October to January, I didn't
get the job.
As with all hindsight, however, this rejec
tion story comes with a happy ending: in con
trast to my out-of-body experience at
Google, when 1 walked on to the high school
campus where I'd spend the next year teach
ing, I felt at home immediately. Not surpris
ingly, I got the job.
Moral of the column? Rejection is both
everywhere and nowhere. That is, while you
can't escape the external application process,
you can, hopefully, learn to separate your ap
plications from yourself. The latter is much
easier said than done, and I would be lying if
I said my skin is now thick enough to resist
the emotional plunge that accompanies re
jection. But when it comes time to do it all
over again this spring, I hope to apply my
years of experience and not take the rejec
tions too personally. If all else fails, 1 will relo
cate to South Dakota, where.according to my
theory of population density, a Stanford
diploma will open handfuls, if not hundreds,
ot doors. 1 am only slightly concerned about
the supply and demand curves.

Despite the many doors opened by her BA in
English, Lisa Mendelman lias been rejected
hundreds of times and lived to tell the tale. Fel

the I lumßio core to Cubberley before reject
ing anyone, but there are limits to Stanford's
open-arms policy: freshman year, it's all
about the Introductory Seminars.
Day one of my Stanford career gave me a
chilling introduction to the dog-eat-dog way
of the Rejection/Acceptance Game. After I
had spent hours agonizing over my IntroSem
application, I determined that, aside from
I HUM and PWR's ancestor WCT, the course
"New Yorker Writers" was the only class

worth taking. From the doorway of an over
flowing classroom, the professor asked
everyone to go outside while she posted the
list of accepted students on the door; those
who made it were to come back in; those who
did not were asked to leave.
Although I was fortunate enough to be ac
cepted into the class (1 was right, by the way
— the class was. hands down, the best course
1 took at Stanford). I learned a painful lesson
that day; only those who apply to the popular
seminars face the risk of rejection. Risk
averse individuals need only wait for the sec
ond week of the quarter when the ad for un
filled seminars runs in The Daily.
Next up: the activities fair. From a cappel
la to spoken word, flamenco dancing to
rugby, the enticing tables set up in White
Plaza invite newcomers and seasoned vets
alike to try out for their next resume-padding
group. The problem, of course, is that the rest
of the applicant pool is comprised of Stan
ford students — not exactly the easiest kids
to beat.
So, you made it through your first year,
took an under-subscribed IntroSem and
joined some audition-free extracurriculars?
Interested in SoCo (that's Sophomore Col
lege, not Southern Comfort)? Studying
abroad? Going on an Alternative Spring
Break trip? Writing an Honors thesis? Get
ting funding for undergraduate research?
Unless you're one of those lucky people who
loves Russian or some other equally-obscure
academic subject, it's time to run the gauntlet
again. If, however, you happen to be from
South Dakota, you might be in luck. Another
Econ-related lesson; it's all about population
density. When I applied to (and was rejected
by) SoCo my freshman year, I just so hap
pened to be a member of the largest appli
cant pool — who knew there were so many
white, female fuzzies from California?
UROs and other research-related compe
titions introduce a new complicating factor:
money. Suddenly, there is something more at
stake than just your pride. Depending on
who you are, there may not be anything near
ly as valuable as your sense of self, but dollars
do have a way of upping the ante.
Those heightened stakes, of course, are

just a precursor to the real world version of
the Application Algorithm. For most fresh
men through juniors, the real world is only
visible several days a year when companies
descend upon campus for the free-product
giveaway known as the Career Fair, but once
your fourth October rolls around. Cardinal
Recruiting starts up and the heat is on. More
than any of its predecessors, the job search is
a daunting experience, perhaps because the
contest and its outcome are no longer the
side show. If you didn't make the Simps,
there's always next year. No luck with tour
guiding? Try writing for The Daily instead.
Didn't get a job during your senior year?
Time to move home with Mom and Dad.
Somehow, the last consolation prize is infi
nitely less appealing than the ones in the pre
vious scenarios.
In my senior year, I applied to work at
Google. Ignoring the fact that 1 was totally
unqualified for the position and had no de
sire to work eighty hours a week. 1 followed
every other scared lemming and headed to
Stanford Goes Corporate. Despite the Fri
day happy hours, the 1M volleyball, the din
ing halls and the "on-campus" speakers. I telt
like I was dressing up to play the part of an
adult. After five rounds of interviews,
stretching from October to January, I didn't
get the job.
As with all hindsight, however, this rejec
tion story comes with a happy ending: in con
trast to my out-of-body experience at
Google, when 1 walked on to the high school
campus where I'd spend the next year teach
ing, I felt at home immediately. Not surpris
ingly, I got the job.
Moral of the column? Rejection is both
everywhere and nowhere. That is, while you
can't escape the external application process,
you can, hopefully, learn to separate your ap
plications from yourself. The latter is much
easier said than done, and I would be lying if
I said my skin is now thick enough to resist
the emotional plunge that accompanies re
jection. But when it comes time to do it all
over again this spring, I hope to apply my
years of experience and not take the rejec
tions too personally. If all else fails, 1 will relo
cate to South Dakota, where.according to my
theory of population density, a Stanford
diploma will open handfuls, if not hundreds,
ot doors. 1 am only slightly concerned about
the supply and demand curves.

Pearls of wisdom
Contrary to the belief held by most high
school seniors, the arrival of a particu
lar fat envelope does not mark the end
of the world's most painful application
process. Alongside the permission to enter
the ivory tower of higher education, the col
lege acceptance letter initiates an occasional
ly agonizing, frequently grueling bumpy road
known as the Avenue of Ups and Downs, the
Street of Dreams and Defeats, the Route of
Risk and Rejection and, for lack of a better
term, the 1 lighway of Life.
Sure, high school has its moments of po
tential disappointment: the talent show, var
sity soccer try-outs, scholarship applications,
the fabled popularity contest of Homecom
ing Court. But for all the tears you shed,
chances are. if you're here now. you probably
did fairly well during your first 18 years. Case
in point: several of my friends, who applied
early decision to Stanford, had never been
rejected when they drove down Palm Drive
lor the first time. One girl even managed to
avoid the college application process alto
gether: she was awarded a full athletic schol
arship in the first week of November. Need
less to say. the rest of the senior class stopped
talking to her until our own fates were
sealed.
Speaking of sealed fates, or at least the
fantasy of them, remember your beautiful
Stanford "S"-embossed folder which ex
tolled the virtues of your tireless dedication?
In case you've already forgotten, the same
packet also contained a number of addition
al forms for programs with funny acronyms
like I roSoCo and SLE. If Res Ed's marketing
ploys worked, little Amy Admit celebrated
her Stanford acceptance by beginning her
next round of applications.
Those who decided to steer clear of the
dubiously academic freshman housing may
have delayed their induction to the process,
but they were welcomed into the fold upon
dorm check-in. Somewhere in the 10x10
room lay a Stanford Bulletin,containing hun
dreds of exciting course descriptions. While
most of these courses offer open enrollment,
a select few come with a caveat or two. ITie
