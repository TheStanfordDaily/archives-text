## Jack Salisbury Renewing a forgotten pastime 
### 
Phillies' first baseman Ryan
Howard is a behemoth. He
stands at 6-foot-4 and 225
pounds, with the kind of sheer power
rarely seen in the majors. Howard, in
his second year with the Phillies, had
an incredible season, clubbing 58
homers, just three shy of the pre
juiced era milestone of 61. Simply
put, the dude is a stud.
So, why in the world am I talking
about Ryan Howard when the
Phillies have long been eliminated?
Well. I have to make a confession.
Until Sports Illustrated featured
him in an article on him in niid-Sep
tember, I actually had no clue that he
was chasing the outdated home run
record of Roger Maris. 1 had heard
his name thrown around in the base
ball circles, but 1 didn't even know
that he had a chance to tie or beat
Maris going into the last two weeks
of the season.
"Who cares? Big deal." At least
that's what most people would say.
But my ignorance of Ryan Howard
and his brilliant season opened my
eyes. 1 had become ignorant of the
very sport that 1 grew up loving.
You see, times change. People
change. As a kid, I would wake up to
Sports Center every morning. It was
the best thing in the world.The tele
vision personalities who pervaded
my childhood were not Ash
Ketchum or Yu-gi-oh but Stuart
Scott and Dan Patrick. As a result of
my daily habit. I had an encyclopedic
knowledge of the world of sports.
Some might consider it pointless.
But pointless to some is invaluable
to others. To me, it was gold.
But then high school happened.
Like pretty much every other stu
dent on this campus, I got involved in
a wide variety of activities and took
a number of AP and honors courses.
When I got home after two and a
half hours of exhausting basketball
practice. I would have time to do my
homework, chat online a bit and go
to sleep. Sports Center had officially
exited my schedule.
Iliis cycle perpetuated itself for
the last four years. Sure, I made time
to watch all of my own team's games,
but, in general. I was watching a
whole lot less of sports.
Maybe cutting out my time in the
world of televised sports was neces
sary for me to progress as an individ
ual; maybe it wasn't. Maybe I would
n't even be at this university if 1 had
n't made that sacrifice; maybe I
would. But over the past four years I
still missed out a lot on one of my
passions.
I m sure this has happened to a lot
of us, some with activities other than
sports (I do realize that normal peo
ple like to do other things, you know,
like go on dates, go to movies, etc.).
Our lives are filled with places to go.
people to see and things to do.
Maybe the extracurricular activities
you participate in really are your
true passion; if so, more power to
you. But I'm positive that there are
plenty of us out there who are inter
ested in things that aren't necessari
ly affiliated with student groups.
So I'm making a pledge in honor
of Ryan Howard. With the whole
student body as my witness, I pledge
to watch Sports Center at least five
times a week for the rest of this year.
It's not going to be easy. I'm going to
have to set aside the time everyday
to accomplish my goal. But whenev
er I get lazy, I'll only need to recall
the mental sting of Ryan Howard
and my prolonged ignorance of his
spectacular season.
And with my own pledge, 1 issue
a challenge to the rest of you. Go
back to your roots. Set aside time to
do something that you used to love
(and maybe still do), and rekindle
that passion. If you're a sports fan
like me, I encourage you to partici
pate in the Sports Center revival.
Whatever it is that you used to do,
get off of your computer, get out of
the library and go do it!
As for me, I'm now aware of
Ryan Howard and his 58 home
runs this season. But it only starts
there. Mark my words: before the
end of the year, 1 will know the
names of the Arizona Cardinals'
outside linebacker, the Minnesota
Wild's goalie, and at least three
starters of every mens' basketball
team in the Big East Conference. I
can't be stopped; I can only be con
tained.

a challenge to the rest of you. Go
back to your roots. Set aside time to
do something that you used to love
(and maybe still do), and rekindle
that passion. If you're a sports fan
like me, I encourage you to partici
pate in the Sports Center revival.
Whatever it is that you used to do,
get off of your computer, get out of
the library and go do it!
As for me, I'm now aware of
Ryan Howard and his 58 home
runs this season. But it only starts
there. Mark my words: before the
end of the year, 1 will know the
names of the Arizona Cardinals'
outside linebacker, the Minnesota
Wild's goalie, and at least three
starters of every mens' basketball
team in the Big East Conference. I
can't be stopped; I can only be con
tained.
