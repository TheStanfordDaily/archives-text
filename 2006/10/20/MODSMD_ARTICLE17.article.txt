Phillies' first baseman Ryan
Howard is a behemoth. He
stands at 6-foot-4 and 225
pounds, with the kind of sheer power
rarely seen in the majors. Howard, in
his second year with the Phillies, had
an incredible season, clubbing 58
homers, just three shy of the pre
juiced era milestone of 61. Simply
put, the dude is a stud.
So, why in the world am I talking
about Ryan Howard when the
Phillies have long been eliminated?
Well. I have to make a confession.
Until Sports Illustrated featured
him in an article on him in niid-Sep
tember, I actually had no clue that he
was chasing the outdated home run
record of Roger Maris. 1 had heard
his name thrown around in the base
ball circles, but 1 didn't even know
that he had a chance to tie or beat
Maris going into the last two weeks
of the season.
"Who cares? Big deal." At least
that's what most people would say.
But my ignorance of Ryan Howard
and his brilliant season opened my
eyes. 1 had become ignorant of the
very sport that 1 grew up loving.
You see, times change. People
change. As a kid, I would wake up to
Sports Center every morning. It was
the best thing in the world.The tele
vision personalities who pervaded
my childhood were not Ash
Ketchum or Yu-gi-oh but Stuart
Scott and Dan Patrick. As a result of
my daily habit. I had an encyclopedic
knowledge of the world of sports.
Some might consider it pointless.
But pointless to some is invaluable
to others. To me, it was gold.
But then high school happened.
Like pretty much every other stu
dent on this campus, I got involved in
a wide variety of activities and took
a number of AP and honors courses.
When I got home after two and a
half hours of exhausting basketball
practice. I would have time to do my
homework, chat online a bit and go
to sleep. Sports Center had officially
exited my schedule.
Iliis cycle perpetuated itself for
the last four years. Sure, I made time
to watch all of my own team's games,
but, in general. I was watching a
whole lot less of sports.
Maybe cutting out my time in the
world of televised sports was neces
sary for me to progress as an individ
ual; maybe it wasn't. Maybe I would
n't even be at this university if 1 had
n't made that sacrifice; maybe I
would. But over the past four years I
still missed out a lot on one of my
passions.
I m sure this has happened to a lot
of us, some with activities other than
sports (I do realize that normal peo
ple like to do other things, you know,
like go on dates, go to movies, etc.).
Our lives are filled with places to go.
