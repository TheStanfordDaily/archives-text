### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
After of a solid two-win weekend against Arizona State and Ari
zona, the No. 19 Stanford women's soccer team travels north to face
both Washington teams. Friday night, Stanford's offense will square off
against junior Brynn Bemis,the Washington State goalkeeper and cur
rent leader in the Pac-10 in save percentage (.853). Ibe Cardinal will
cap the weekend Sunday against the Washington Huskies, one of the
youngest teams in the conference, with four freshmen starters and
three sophomore starters.
Freshman Kelley O'Hara had a standout weekend to help power
the Cardinal (9-5-1,2-1-1 Fac-10) past both Arizona teams. O'Hara tal
lied five points and earned her first Pac-10 Player of the Week honor.
Ali Riley recorded a goal and an assist against Arizona and Arizona
State and is tied tor third on the team for total
goals, with three this season. Stanford's fresh
man class has powered the attack, recording
nearl> half of the total goals scored this season.
The Cardinal offense will also need a big
game from senior midfielder Shari Summers
against Bemis and her defense Friday night.
Summers scored the game-winner last year
in the last ten minutes of a 1-0 game against
the Cougars. She has been among the best
Pac-10 offensive players throughout the sea
son and ranks in the top 10 for shots, points
and goals.
While the Cardinal are the odds-on fa
vorites. taking down the Cougars will not be an
easy task. Washington State (7-4-3, 2-0-1) just
won four home games in a row. But Stanford re
mains confident they can continue their win
ning ways.
"Our team is on fire right now." said fresh
man Kristin Stannard, who is tied for third on
the team with three goals."lt's really important
that we keep up our confidence going to Wash
ington. as away games definitely have some
what of a mental effect of some teams. 1 iowev
er. if we continue playing as well as we are right
now, not playing at home should have no effect
whatsoever on the outcome."
The Cardinal's defense will also be an im
portant part of the matches this weekend. Hie
Stanford defense has played a large role this
season and has limited 13 opponents to just two
shots on goal each. They have also registered
nine shutouts.
Sophomore defender Allison Falck had a
breakthrough weekend against the Arizona
teams, when she recorded her first career goal
against Arizona and an assist against Arizona
State. Last weekend marked junior backup
goalkeeper Erica Holland's first two season
wins and her third career shutout.
Stanford will conclude the weekend at
Husky Soccer Field against Washington (6-8,
1-2).The Huskies have made a drastically im
proved from last season (0-17-3) with the
help of sophomore leading scorer Melissa
