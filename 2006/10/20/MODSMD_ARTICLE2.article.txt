# T.C. TAKES OVER
## Backup Ostrander leads the Cardinal into desert for matchup with Arizona State 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
Tomorrow, starting quarterback T.C. Os
trander will drop back to pass. Starting fullback
Emeka Nnoli and right tackle Chris Marinelli
will lay key blocks as Ostrander searches down
field trying to find one of his two starting re
ceivers. Austin Yancy and Kelton Lynn.
Sound strange? Of those five players, none
were expected to see substantial time on the
field this season, much less play at all. Yet to
morrow. when the Cardinal (0-7, 0-4 Pac-10)
take on Arizona State (3-3, 0-3) at Sun Devil
Stadium,each will appear in the starting lineup.
"1 haven't ever been through a season like
this and I'm hoping this is my penance, so we
don't have to do it again," Stanford coach Walt
Harris said. "Not just me but all our coaches, all

our players and all the people who support
us loyally. Nobody wants to see anyone get
hurt, and the injuries leave us with a lot of
work to do."
After losing Trent Edwards for the sea
son with a broken foot in last Saturday's2o
- loss to Arizona, the Cardinal are left with
out six offensive starters — center Tim
Mattran. fullback Nick Frank, wide re
ceivers Mark Bradford and Evan Moore,
offensive tackle Jon Cochran and Edwards.
"We have 28 guys that have never played
[in college] before that are now playing, so
there's a learning curve," I larris said. "At a
lot of places people don't see the field for a
long. long, long time until they have gone
through the hard road of seeing how high
the expectations are of execution and have
fallen short of the mark.That's the meat and
potatoes of your football team — they don't
usually play until they're redshirt juniors
and now they've been through four years."
Ostrander will get the start in Edwards'
place, his first starting nod since Big Game
in 2004. I'he redshirt junior entered last Sat
urday's game with just over six minutes left
in the first quarter after Edwards injured
his foot during the Cardinal's first offensive
drive. Ostrander finished the game 8-of-13
passing with 58 yards, while leading Stan
ford to its worst offensive game in the histo
ry of the program.
It will be the third start of Ostrander's
career at Stanford. In his two previous starts
under center, the Atherton.Calif.-native led
the Cardinal to a 0-2 record with losses to
Oregon State and California in 2004.
"I'm not going to try to come in and re
place [Edwards|," Ostrander said. "He's a

tough guy to replace.There's a lot of things
I have to do better to be successful, so 1 just
need to focus on doing those things and im
proving. Iliat's really all I can do at this
point."
Ostrander will be backed up by sopho
more Tavita Prichard. who has never taken
a college snap. Prichard spent the three
weeks prior to Edwards' injury practicing at
wide receiver.
Hie Sun Devils have also experienced
their fair share of quarter'backing issues this
season. Prior to the opening game, Arizona
State coach Dirk Koetter named senior
Sam Keller the starter, before changing his
mind days later, appointing sophomore
Rudy Carpenter as the number one option
under center. As a result of the demotion,
Keller transferred to Nebraska, leaving the
Sun Devils with little depth.
Since the controversy. Carpenter has
struggled to find the same success that he
managed as a part-time starter in 2005.
After throwing for 17 touchdowns and just
two interceptions last season. Carpenter
has already been picked off nine times this
year with 12 touchdowns.
In last season's game against Stanford.
Carpenter nearly brought the Sun Devils
back from a 45-7 deficit. After entering the
game after halftime, the then-freshman
threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns
to pull Arizona State to within ten.
"I'll always remember that game, be
cause it was my first opportunity to play in
a college football game in which something
was still on the line," Carpenter said. "The
previous games 1 played in. the game was al
ready over. In that Stanford game we just

ran out of time."
Carpenter also ran out of time last week
in a 28-21 loss to No. 3 USC. Trailing 21-0
early, the sophomore pulled the Sun Devils
hack into the game at 21-21 with less than
five minutes remaining. But, USC scored a
touchdown with just over four minutes re
maining and Carpenter couldn't put togeth
er one final drive.
"I always talk to the team before the
game, and I told them that win. lose or draw
1 wanted USC to walk out thinking that
ASU is a pretty good team that we don't
want to play again because they gave us
their best shot," Carpenter said. "USC came
out fast, they gave us their best shot and we
had to weather the storm a little bit. Once
we did that, we settled down and came
back.The only thing is that it's hard to come
back from being down 21 points. TTiat's
something that we need to prevent by not
making stupid mistakes and penalties."
The Sun Devils started the season
ranked in the top 25 and won their first
three games of the season. But once the
Pac-10 season rolled around, the Sun Dev
ils found the road more challenging, start
ing the conference season with losses to
Oregon, Cal and USC.
".Even though Stanford is winless this
year, we are winless in the Pac-10, so we
need to be playing every game like it's the
Super Bowl," Carpenter said. "It would be
good to finish 9-3, but we have to get to 4-3
first. Every Pac-10 team is good this year,so
it's going to be tough no matter how you
look at it."
Kickoff is slated for 12:30 pm tomorrow
in Tempe, Ariz.

Tomorrow, starting quarterback T.C. Os
trander will drop back to pass. Starting fullback
Emeka Nnoli and right tackle Chris Marinelli
will lay key blocks as Ostrander searches down
field trying to find one of his two starting re

Sound strange? Of those five players, none
were expected to see substantial time on the
field this season, much less play at all. Yet to
morrow. when the Cardinal (0-7, 0-4 Pac-10)
take on Arizona State (3-3, 0-3) at Sun Devil
Stadium,each will appear in the starting lineup.

this and I'm hoping this is my penance, so we
don't have to do it again," Stanford coach Walt
Harris said. "Not just me but all our coaches, all

our players and all the people who support
us loyally. Nobody wants to see anyone get
hurt, and the injuries leave us with a lot of
work to do."
After losing Trent Edwards for the sea
son with a broken foot in last Saturday's2o
- loss to Arizona, the Cardinal are left with
out six offensive starters — center Tim
Mattran. fullback Nick Frank, wide re
ceivers Mark Bradford and Evan Moore,
offensive tackle Jon Cochran and Edwards.
"We have 28 guys that have never played
[in college] before that are now playing, so
there's a learning curve," I larris said. "At a
lot of places people don't see the field for a
long. long, long time until they have gone
through the hard road of seeing how high
the expectations are of execution and have
fallen short of the mark.That's the meat and
potatoes of your football team — they don't
usually play until they're redshirt juniors
and now they've been through four years."
Ostrander will get the start in Edwards'
place, his first starting nod since Big Game
in 2004. I'he redshirt junior entered last Sat
urday's game with just over six minutes left
in the first quarter after Edwards injured
his foot during the Cardinal's first offensive
drive. Ostrander finished the game 8-of-13
passing with 58 yards, while leading Stan
ford to its worst offensive game in the histo
ry of the program.
It will be the third start of Ostrander's
career at Stanford. In his two previous starts
under center, the Atherton.Calif.-native led
the Cardinal to a 0-2 record with losses to
Oregon State and California in 2004.
"I'm not going to try to come in and re
place [Edwards|," Ostrander said. "He's a

tough guy to replace.There's a lot of things
I have to do better to be successful, so 1 just
need to focus on doing those things and im
proving. Iliat's really all I can do at this
point."
Ostrander will be backed up by sopho
more Tavita Prichard. who has never taken
a college snap. Prichard spent the three
weeks prior to Edwards' injury practicing at
wide receiver.
Hie Sun Devils have also experienced
their fair share of quarter'backing issues this
season. Prior to the opening game, Arizona
State coach Dirk Koetter named senior
Sam Keller the starter, before changing his
mind days later, appointing sophomore
Rudy Carpenter as the number one option
under center. As a result of the demotion,
Keller transferred to Nebraska, leaving the
Sun Devils with little depth.
Since the controversy. Carpenter has
struggled to find the same success that he
managed as a part-time starter in 2005.
After throwing for 17 touchdowns and just
two interceptions last season. Carpenter
has already been picked off nine times this
year with 12 touchdowns.
In last season's game against Stanford.
Carpenter nearly brought the Sun Devils
back from a 45-7 deficit. After entering the
game after halftime, the then-freshman
threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns
to pull Arizona State to within ten.
"I'll always remember that game, be
cause it was my first opportunity to play in
a college football game in which something
was still on the line," Carpenter said. "The
previous games 1 played in. the game was al
ready over. In that Stanford game we just

ran out of time."
Carpenter also ran out of time last week
in a 28-21 loss to No. 3 USC. Trailing 21-0
early, the sophomore pulled the Sun Devils
hack into the game at 21-21 with less than
five minutes remaining. But, USC scored a
touchdown with just over four minutes re
maining and Carpenter couldn't put togeth
er one final drive.
"I always talk to the team before the
game, and I told them that win. lose or draw
1 wanted USC to walk out thinking that
ASU is a pretty good team that we don't
want to play again because they gave us
their best shot," Carpenter said. "USC came
out fast, they gave us their best shot and we
had to weather the storm a little bit. Once
we did that, we settled down and came
back.The only thing is that it's hard to come
back from being down 21 points. TTiat's
something that we need to prevent by not
making stupid mistakes and penalties."
The Sun Devils started the season
ranked in the top 25 and won their first
three games of the season. But once the
Pac-10 season rolled around, the Sun Dev
ils found the road more challenging, start
ing the conference season with losses to
Oregon, Cal and USC.
".Even though Stanford is winless this
year, we are winless in the Pac-10, so we
need to be playing every game like it's the
Super Bowl," Carpenter said. "It would be
good to finish 9-3, but we have to get to 4-3
first. Every Pac-10 team is good this year,so
it's going to be tough no matter how you
look at it."
Kickoff is slated for 12:30 pm tomorrow
in Tempe, Ariz.

we did that, we settled down and came
back.The only thing is that it's hard to come
back from being down 21 points. TTiat's
something that we need to prevent by not
making stupid mistakes and penalties."
The Sun Devils started the season
ranked in the top 25 and won their first
three games of the season. But once the
Pac-10 season rolled around, the Sun Dev
ils found the road more challenging, start
ing the conference season with losses to
Oregon, Cal and USC.
".Even though Stanford is winless this
year, we are winless in the Pac-10, so we
need to be playing every game like it's the
Super Bowl," Carpenter said. "It would be
good to finish 9-3, but we have to get to 4-3
first. Every Pac-10 team is good this year,so
it's going to be tough no matter how you
look at it."
Kickoff is slated for 12:30 pm tomorrow
in Tempe, Ariz.

Tomorrow, starting quarterback T.C. Os
trander will drop back to pass. Starting fullback
Emeka Nnoli and right tackle Chris Marinelli
will lay key blocks as Ostrander searches down
field trying to find one of his two starting re
ceivers. Austin Yancy and Kelton Lynn.
Sound strange? Of those five players, none
were expected to see substantial time on the
field this season, much less play at all. Yet to
morrow. when the Cardinal (0-7, 0-4 Pac-10)
take on Arizona State (3-3, 0-3) at Sun Devil
Stadium,each will appear in the starting lineup.
"1 haven't ever been through a season like
this and I'm hoping this is my penance, so we
don't have to do it again," Stanford coach Walt
Harris said. "Not just me but all our coaches, all


SHAMS SHAIKH/The Stanford Daily
Senior cornerback Tim Sims brings down Arizona's Xavier Smith in last weekend's 20-7 loss to the Wildcats. The Cardinal head to Arizona State still looking for their first win of the season.
our players and all the people who support
us loyally. Nobody wants to see anyone get
hurt, and the injuries leave us with a lot of
work to do."
After losing Trent Edwards for the sea
son with a broken foot in last Saturday's2o
- loss to Arizona, the Cardinal are left with
out six offensive starters — center Tim
Mattran. fullback Nick Frank, wide re
ceivers Mark Bradford and Evan Moore,
offensive tackle Jon Cochran and Edwards.
"We have 28 guys that have never played
[in college] before that are now playing, so
there's a learning curve," I larris said. "At a
lot of places people don't see the field for a
long. long, long time until they have gone
through the hard road of seeing how high
the expectations are of execution and have
fallen short of the mark.That's the meat and
potatoes of your football team — they don't
usually play until they're redshirt juniors
and now they've been through four years."
Ostrander will get the start in Edwards'
place, his first starting nod since Big Game
in 2004. I'he redshirt junior entered last Sat
urday's game with just over six minutes left
in the first quarter after Edwards injured
his foot during the Cardinal's first offensive
drive. Ostrander finished the game 8-of-13
passing with 58 yards, while leading Stan
ford to its worst offensive game in the histo
ry of the program.
It will be the third start of Ostrander's
career at Stanford. In his two previous starts
under center, the Atherton.Calif.-native led
the Cardinal to a 0-2 record with losses to
Oregon State and California in 2004.
"I'm not going to try to come in and re
place [Edwards|," Ostrander said. "He's a

tough guy to replace.There's a lot of things
I have to do better to be successful, so 1 just
need to focus on doing those things and im
proving. Iliat's really all I can do at this
point."
Ostrander will be backed up by sopho
more Tavita Prichard. who has never taken
a college snap. Prichard spent the three
weeks prior to Edwards' injury practicing at
wide receiver.
Hie Sun Devils have also experienced
their fair share of quarter'backing issues this
season. Prior to the opening game, Arizona
State coach Dirk Koetter named senior
Sam Keller the starter, before changing his
mind days later, appointing sophomore
Rudy Carpenter as the number one option
under center. As a result of the demotion,
Keller transferred to Nebraska, leaving the
Sun Devils with little depth.
Since the controversy. Carpenter has
struggled to find the same success that he
managed as a part-time starter in 2005.
After throwing for 17 touchdowns and just
two interceptions last season. Carpenter
has already been picked off nine times this
year with 12 touchdowns.
In last season's game against Stanford.
Carpenter nearly brought the Sun Devils
back from a 45-7 deficit. After entering the
game after halftime, the then-freshman
threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns
to pull Arizona State to within ten.
"I'll always remember that game, be
cause it was my first opportunity to play in
a college football game in which something
was still on the line," Carpenter said. "The
previous games 1 played in. the game was al
ready over. In that Stanford game we just

ran out of time."
Carpenter also ran out of time last week
in a 28-21 loss to No. 3 USC. Trailing 21-0
early, the sophomore pulled the Sun Devils
hack into the game at 21-21 with less than
five minutes remaining. But, USC scored a
touchdown with just over four minutes re
maining and Carpenter couldn't put togeth
er one final drive.
"I always talk to the team before the
game, and I told them that win. lose or draw
1 wanted USC to walk out thinking that
ASU is a pretty good team that we don't
want to play again because they gave us
their best shot," Carpenter said. "USC came
out fast, they gave us their best shot and we
had to weather the storm a little bit. Once
we did that, we settled down and came
back.The only thing is that it's hard to come
back from being down 21 points. TTiat's
something that we need to prevent by not
making stupid mistakes and penalties."
The Sun Devils started the season
ranked in the top 25 and won their first
three games of the season. But once the
Pac-10 season rolled around, the Sun Dev
ils found the road more challenging, start
ing the conference season with losses to

".Even though Stanford is winless this
year, we are winless in the Pac-10, so we

good to finish 9-3, but we have to get to 4-3
first. Every Pac-10 team is good this year,so
