NEW YORK (AP) — No way anybody was catching
Yadier Molina's ninth-inning shot. And by the time it
landed beyond the left-field fence, the St. Louis Cardi
nals were headed to the World Series.
Molina's tiebreaking homer and another Game 7
gem by Jeff Suppan helped St. Louis overcome Endy
Chavez's astounding grab, giving the Cardinals a 3-1
victory over the New York Mets on Thursday night for
the NL championship.
Adam Wainwright wriggled out of a bases-loaded jam in
the bottom of the ninth, striking out St. Louis nemesis Car
los Beltran to end it and leaving a stunned crowd in deflat
ed silence just moments after it had Shea Stadium shaking.
And with that, the Cardinals earned their second
pennant in three years and a date with the Detroit
Tigers on Saturday night in Game 1 of the World Series.
Hey Motown, here come the Cards.
"I think this is the best team — and we proved it,"
Molina said.
Molina, a .216 career hitter with only six home runs
during the regular season, drove the lirst pitch he saw
from reliever Aaron Heilman into New York s bullpen
for a 3-1 lead in the ninth.

Chavez, who made one of the most memorable
catches in postseason history just three innings earlier,
could only stand and watch at the fence as the Mets' title
hopes were dashed.
Scott Rolen, robbed of a homer by Chavez in the
sixth, started the St. Louis rally with a single.
But the Mets. resilient throughout their stirring sea
son. nearly came back in the ninth.
Jose Valentin and Chavez singled before pinch-hitter
Cliff Floyd struck out looking. Jose Reyes lined to cen
ter for the second out, but Paul Lo Duca drew a walk
that loaded the bases.
That brought up Beltran, who homered three times
in the series after hitting .417 with four home runs for
Houston in the 2004 NLCS against St. Louis.
Wainwright, a rookie filling in for injured closer
Jason Isringhausen.got ahead in the count immediately
and froze Beltran with a curveball for strike three.
"I can't let my team down right there," said Wain
wright, who has three saves in the postseason. "Our
team deserves it. We battled so hard in the playoffs."
The Cardinals, with their 17th pennant in hand,
charged out of the dugout and mobbed Wainwright in
front of the mound.
Suppan. who beat Roger Clemens in Game 7 of the
2004 NLCS, took home the MVP award this time for
two outstanding starts. He limited the Mets to one run
and five hits in 15 innings, and once again was at his best
in a big game.
"We never gave up. We always believed in our
selves," Suppan said.
