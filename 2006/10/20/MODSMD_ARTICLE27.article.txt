### THOSE WHO KNOW INTERMISSION CHIEFS OF STAFF 
Everyone is busy these days. Betsy has midterms,
Brendan has papers. We're sure you have some
thing important, too (although that doesn't explain
why you have the free time to even read this note in
the first place!).
Our theme this week is Inter-

mission Docs West Wing. What
exactly does it mean for our sec-

tion to "do" West Wing?

That's a good question.
We're not entirely sure,

hut we're pretty sure it

gives us the free-

dom to run gra
tuit o us

amounts of
material re-

latcd to the
TV series in

this week's edi
tion.

That is amazing,
because we all know

that Intermission loves
the DC. In fact, even
(KminK 11/oVn (Un \X/rvr»<

tnougn we re doing the west
Wing theme this week, this
isn't going to necessarily stop
us from doing a DC-themed

issue sometime soon. Heck,
maybe even next week.

And we're aware that we're kind of jumping the
gun on the whole "political" side of things since the
midterm elections aren't until next month. But let's

face it. It's clear where all of this is going. Trade
sports.com is telling us there's a 69% chance of the

Democrats taking the House. Even the Senate
might be in reach for those whacky left-wingers.
Why do we care? It's not necessarily that Inter
mission leans in nne Hirprtinn nr th#*

other. We just like a good shakeup
every once in a while. A month ago,
. it was looking doubtful that the
«ii • « -

election would be all that interest
ing, despite media hype to the

contrary. But now, thanks
to some douche named

r oley, we're guaran
teed a non-stop politi
cal thrill ride from
1 _ !1 1

here until early
November.
They're al-

ways saying on
the TV networks
that this is one of the

most partisan eras in
American political histo-

ry. So enjoy it. Congression
al elections aren't always

going to be this interesting. Get

informed, tune in, and don't miss
following the horse race (while
there's actually some suspense
about the outcome).
