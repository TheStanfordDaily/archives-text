# For Snicket, 13th a charmer
## 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION READER 
The end of something good is always a
little sad, no matter how good the end is. It
took me a lot of convincing to finally see
'The Revenge of the Sith" because 1
knew, no matter how incredible the movie
was. it would mark the end of the Star
Wars movies for me. ' The End," which,
fittingly enough, is the last book of Lemo
ny Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate
Events, promised to be doubly sad: It not
only marks the conclusion of an excellent
series, but also states, in the beginning,
that you. the reader, will be left with
"countless tears in your eyes."
That being said, "The End" is an excel
lent read. The 13th book of the series, it
marks the final chapter in the tragic stoiy
of the Baudelaire orphans, who have pre
viously braved countless misfortunes, and
who are now attempting to escape the
clutches of the evil Count Olaf.
The story begins with all four main
characters — Violet. Klaus, Sunny and
Count Olaf — stranded on a boat in the
middle of the ocean. After a terrible inde
scribable storm, the four wind up on an is
land that can only be described as a mix

ture of the island of Shakespeare's "Tem
pest Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe" and
Huxley's

"Brave New
World."
Despite the
fact A Series of
Unfortunate
Events' intend
ed audience
seems to be
eight to 12-vear
olds. "The End
is entirely full of
literary refer
ences that I

greatly enjoyed. The first person our
young protagonists meet on the island is
named Friday, and the island's ruler or
"facilitator." whose name is Ishmael, asks
the Baudelaire siblings to "call me Ish."
Furthermore, the islanders are pacified
with a drink that causes lethargy, much
like Soma in "Brave New World" and
lotus in "The Odyssey." And there are
minor characters with names like Miran
da, Ms. Marlow. Dr. Kurtz and Ariel, not
to mention other islanders with other such
literary names.
It almost seems, then, that the book is

not geared towards the younger set, but-!
towards an English major. Indeed,
throughout the story, there are words that
would be daunting to most 12-year-olds
and even those far older than 12, myselt in
cluded. There are words like aberrant,
which, as Snicket puts it. means something
"very. very, wrong and causing much
grief." Snicket defines the word hallmark'
as a word that "refers to something's dis
tinguishing characteristics, such as the
frothy foam and loud fizz that are the hall
marks of a root beer float, or the
tearstained photographs and the loud fizz
that are the hallmarks of a broken heart."
Snicket's hallmark, then, is his utterly
charming style. He writes with such vivac
ity and magnetism that the book is ex
ceedingly difficult to put down. Despite
the book's heft, (324 pages) 1 would have
easily read the book in one sitting, if 1 had
not reached my BART stop.
Snicket's highly original, charming
style drives the book. Unlike many other
children's authors, Snicket never writes-;
condescendingly and instead of bringing
his writing down to his audience, he brings
his young readers up to him.
