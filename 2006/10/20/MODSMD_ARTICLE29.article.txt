## LET MOVIEGOERS EAT CAKE! 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION CAKE EATER 
If you were going to make a movie about the
infamous Marie Antoinette, this is not the
movie you should make. The young monarch,
and Sophia Coppola, the young director, have
many things in common: Both are thrust into a

position of airy prominence (one by an
arranged marriage, the other by a re
cent Oscar win) and each uses her new
found power to pursue interests
deemed downright stupid by the rest of
society. Forgive the extended
metaphor, but Coppola's style of mini
malist characterscapes seems to appeal
exclusively to a close circle of admirers,
much the way Marie's three-foot hairdo
does to her courtiers in revolutionary

France. That being said, however misguided, the
movie is riveting, viscerally satisfying and utterly sexy.
Kirsten Dunst plays the young Antoinette, who at the
age of 14,/ Is snatched away from Vienna and married
to Louis XVI (played by Jason Schwartzman of Rush
more fame). The teenage queen must learn to survive
in the palace at Versailles, which proves to be a sort of
well-dressed, affluent high school, complete with gos
sip. drama and rampant drug use.
Coppola schemes to make the aplomb and circum
stance of an 18th century aristocracy immediately ac
cessible to the youth of today, right down to the sex-pis

with some sort of pre-colonial stereo held defiantly over
his head. The music is something music supervisor Briar
Reitzell calls "post-punk-pre-new-romantic-rock opera
odyssey." This involves the constant blend of tradition
al classical music with bleeding-edge pop for an ulti
mately effective effort. By taking the teenage Marie and
placing her in a modern context with music, it forces the
comparison of the rich and privileged in the sprawling
palaces of old France and the rich and privileged in the
sprawling pseudo-castles ol suburbia. This, combined
with the imagery, is the most compelling aspect of the
film.

Uy, the turn is a knockout, l he
cadence of the French monar
ated in loving detail. The sheer,
uxury is showcased over and
sh food, a bottomless supply of
, immaculate gardens, outdoor
, huge ensemble scenes and
parties. As much opulence that
shown, juicy dialogues that
seem inherent in the story are
cut out. When Marie's
brother comes to speak
$ with Louis about his sexu
al problems, the conversa
tion is voiced over. In fact,
there is very little dialogue at
all, and this is where the film
takes a wrong turn. The styl
istic portrayals of basic anti
thetical lost characters with
their blank stares and open,
•ursed lips do not work here as
they did in " Lost in Transla
tion." There is simply too
much to be conveyed by
non-action.
Dunst looks the part of An
toinette, but there is so much
Epore shading evident in her
character. The notorious
bitch-queen is an interest
s' ing vantage point from
0 which to view the French
P revolution, and we get
y just enough of her to
5 want more. Unfortu-

nately, as soon as the ethereal world of
the royals collides with the harsh reali
ty of the revolutionary France, the
movie comes to an abrupt close. Histor
ically, Marie is sentenced to death for
her perceived extravagance and indif
ference, but there is none of that here.
So much is left to be said, and Coppola
(who has never been completely forgiv
en for Godfather III) skips over it in
what seems like a lost effort to make a
hipper-than-thou movie. See it for the
wild parties, miles of cheesecake and
awesome frippery and /or foppery.
