# OSAISAI BRINGS SPARK TO SECONDARY
## Former sprinter making a splash after earning his first career start last weekend against Arizona 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
During Stanford's 20-7 loss to Arizona last Satur
day, a truly dismal day for Cardinal football, a
single flash of athleticism was all the crowd had
to cheer. Junior cornerback Wopamo Osaisai's 72-yard
interception return for a touchdown proved to be the
lone bright spot for Stanford in their Homecoming
game against the Wildcats, but the highlight-reel run
back would have been noteworthy in any setting.
Osaisai, a former track and field athlete who set a
school record with a 10.39-second mark in the 100-me
ters in 2(X)5. made a magnificent play on Arizona quar
terback Adam Austin's pass with 3:4b remaining in the
second quarter, using his sprinter's speed to return the
ball for a touchdown.
"You don't just see it on the return, you see it every
time he covers a punt — you see speed." Stanford coach
Walt Harris said. "They double team him, and he beats
both of them. I le's starting to accelerate to the ball . He's
really starting to put his athletic ability into his playing
ability, and that's what happens when you have a talent
ed young athlete and you give him playing time."
At the time, there was even reason to hope that the

momentous play could provide a spark for the rest of
the Cardinal. But while the Stanford defense allowed
just six points after the first quarter of play-and only
three after Osaisai's touchdown-the momentum never
translated to the offensive side of the ball, which put up
historically dour statistics. Osaisai said he certainly had
hoped the play would inspire his team to an improved
performance, but he nevertheless was glad to have
helped his Cardinal teammates in any way he could.
"To some extent I was thinking [it could be a spark),
hut really I was just trying to help the team in whatever
way possible," Osaisai said. "And I know that whatever
1 do. as long as it's positive, will help the team. It's not
like I intend to be the one who makes the spark or that
it's my main focus or centralized goal, but whatever I do.
as long as I do it right, helps the team."
It was a play that came close to never occurring.This
past offseason. Osaisai left the team to focus on track
and field before returning over the summer. Osaisai
credits his family with helping him straighten out his
priorities and make the decision to
return to football.
"I realized that football was in my
best interest," Osaisai said. '"1 had
time to talk to my family, and they
felt that since I had decided to come
in originally to play football that I
might as well pursue that to my
fullest ability. I never really had a
chance to see how well 1 could do in
football and 1 just kind of gave it up
because I was going through my own
personal issues.
"I've definitely grown a lot since
then," he added. "I had the entire
school year to deal with a lot of ad
versity in terms of what I wanted to
accomplish — my goals, my career.
So I've learned a lot through that
time and feel I came out for the bet
ter."
Harris pointed to Osaisai's in
creased dedication to learning about
the game of football and decreased
reliance on his sheer athletic ability
as factors that have helped the junior
cornerback improve this season.
"Football is a game where you
have to be a football player and not
just an athlete," Harris said. "What's
happened to Wopamo is he's getting
playing time, and he has pride in his
game. When he doesn't do well, he
tries to improve. I think the improve
ment of Wopamo is something all our
players should try to emulate."
Younger teammates could do well
to emulate his focus and positive out
look as well. Despite an 0-7 record.
Osaisai said he had no regrets about
his decision to return to the team and
that the key to improving their
record lay in maintaining a positive
outlook.
"We're still focused on winning,"
Osaisai said. "We're not going to sit
here and look at the season go down
the drain — that's not our focus at
all. We want to win and we keep on
working towards that goal. I feel like
everybody on the team has [been
staying focused). We can't be nega
tive about our season. We have to be
positive to turn it around, and every
one's been positive so far."
So, should Stanford fans expect to
see more Hashes of brilliance out of
the junior cornerback this season?
"1 feel like 1 have the ability to do
it, and I'd like to be able to do it." Os
aisai said. "1 don't want to say I am
the playmaker,' because that would
be a selfish mindset. It's more about
helping the team than making big
plays myself."

"We're not going to sit here and look
at the season go down the drain."
