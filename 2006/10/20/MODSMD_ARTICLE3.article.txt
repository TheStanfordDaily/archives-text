# OSAISAI BRINGS SPARK TO SECONDARY
## Former sprinter making a splash after earning his first career start last weekend against Arizona 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
During Stanford's 20-7 loss to Arizona last Satur
day, a truly dismal day for Cardinal football, a
single flash of athleticism was all the crowd had
to cheer. Junior cornerback Wopamo Osaisai's 72-yard
interception return for a touchdown proved to be the
lone bright spot for Stanford in their Homecoming
game against the Wildcats, but the highlight-reel run
back would have been noteworthy in any setting.
Osaisai, a former track and field athlete who set a
school record with a 10.39-second mark in the 100-me
ters in 2(X)5. made a magnificent play on Arizona quar
terback Adam Austin's pass with 3:4b remaining in the
second quarter, using his sprinter's speed to return the
ball for a touchdown.
"You don't just see it on the return, you see it every
time he covers a punt â€” you see speed." Stanford coach
Walt Harris said. "They double team him, and he beats
both of them. I le's starting to accelerate to the ball . He's
really starting to put his athletic ability into his playing
ability, and that's what happens when you have a talent
ed young athlete and you give him playing time."
At the time, there was even reason to hope that the

momentous play could provide a spark for the rest of
the Cardinal. But while the Stanford defense allowed
just six points after the first quarter of play-and only
three after Osaisai's touchdown-the momentum never
translated to the offensive side of the ball, which put up
historically dour statistics. Osaisai said he certainly had
hoped the play would inspire his team to an improved
performance, but he nevertheless was glad to have
helped his Cardinal teammates in any way he could.
"To some extent I was thinking [it could be a spark),
hut really I was just trying to help the team in whatever
way possible," Osaisai said. "And I know that whatever
1 do. as long as it's positive, will help the team. It's not
like I intend to be the one who makes the spark or that
it's my main focus or centralized goal, but whatever I do.
as long as I do it right, helps the team."
It was a play that came close to never occurring.This
past offseason. Osaisai left the team to focus on track
and field before returning over the summer. Osaisai
credits his family with helping him straighten out his
