Television and I had a falling-out some years ago,
at a time when the general audience was catching
the reality bug and placing a premium on "real" peo-

ple dealing with "real" stakes. The likes of "Sur
vivor," "American IdoL," professional poker and "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire?" thrived, but I wasn't sold.

"Thanks," I told Television, "but if I want reality, 111 go outside."
"I have candy," Television cooed, to which I proclaimed her trick
ery would not work on me this time.
The divorce was nasty; she was awarded custody of my friends.
1 got to see them on weekends, but all they ever wanted to talk
about was the latest episode of the latest big thing, of which I was
always ignorant. The separation was becoming too much for me to
bear, so one evening I, taken by passion, watched her. One episode
of "Lost" was enough to re-instill in me that old sense of investment
in a show, and it wasn't through a cheap tactic like the promise of a
million dollars waiting at the end of an arduous line of questions.
That kind of promise can sell a show all by itself, and I don't see
much sport in that. Of course, to be fair, the creators of "Lost" are
not above playing on basic emotions (indeed, these emotions are
vital to the show's huge success), but this is a show with all of its
bases covered.
The plot: A commercial plane crashes into the ocean, leaving the
survivors stranded on a strange island with no conception of where
they are and no means of contacting
"the outside world." The sur
rfflFth** * vivors

PI —"Losties" as some fans
I call them — hold out hope
for rescue, but it becomes in
creasingly clear that no one is com-

ing to save them and that they are going to have to con-

front the island's mysteries (among them a polar bear, a

computer,and a band of hostile island residents known
as The Others) if they are to survive. Sounds exciting,
no? It is, but it's often more "Usual Suspects" than "In
diana Jones." In other words, it's a character-driven
show comprised largely of flashbacks. Turns out each
of the Losties owns a past he or she would like to forget,
the juicy secrets of which are still being revealed three

seasons into the series.
For a show like this to work, the character de
velopment must be exceptional, which it is, and the
acting must be at least equally as impressive, which
it is. The damaged do-gooder (Matthew Fox's Jack
Shephard). the strong-willed vixen (Evangeline
Lilly's Kate Austen), the self-sure asshole you

love to hate (Josh Hollo way's Sawyer), the
overprotective father (Harold Perrineau Jr.),

the uneasy Korean couple (Yunjin Kim's

Sun Kwon and Daniel Dae Kinvs Jin

Kwon) — tliis cast has it all, each

member lovingly playing his or
her role with panache. You will

feel for the characters and their
plight. You will laugh, you will
cry. You will be seduced by
the cutting-edge marketing

techniques. You will

be absolute

addicted.
Speaking of addiction, genius diagnostician Dr. Gregory House
has a Vicodin problem. When he's not brazenly disregarding med
ical ethics to save a patient's life or reaching into his seemingly bot
tomless bag of witty insults to put down his crack team of underliug
doctors (Omar Epps's Dr. Eric Foreman, Jennifer Morrison's Dr.
Allison Cameron and Jesse Spencer's Dr. Robert Chase), he's pop
ping the painkiller like candy. House, played by the brilliant Huge
Laurie, makes no effort to conceal his habit, claiming, "I do not
have a pain-management problem, I have a pain problem." "But
who knows," he adds, "maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too stoned to

tell!" Such is the way of Dr. House.
If this sounds at all formulaic, it's because it is.
Most episodes of "House" follow the same basic
plot structure in which some poor fellow with
an utterly baffling ailment is brought under
House's crankily begrudging care at the fic
tional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital
of New Jersey. The patient is treated by House

and his team, gets better, gets worse and ap
proaches death before being cured in the eleventh hour

What is so remarkable about this show is the way it r

mains compelling despite its predictability. Laurie

who recently earned a Golden Globe for his por

trayal of House, deserves most of the credit

Even when wallowing in murky misery he's

electric, at once both loathsome and. having
been wounded physically and emotional
ly, someone anyone can relate to on the

deepest of levels. That's what 1 call reali
ty TV.

So, you want reality TN
"House" will deliver. You \v;u

"Survivor" on steroids?
"Lost" will deliver.

Whatever you do,
stop watching

poker!

Stanford may not have the

best pedigree when it comes to

producing presidential candidates
(Kerry, Bush. Clinton, Bush 5r.... must

have something to do with the inspiring New
Haven countryside), but that doesn't mean we
don't have our mind on Washington. Just
think: the talkative girl in your IR section

could be the next Hillary, and the guy who falls
asleep in the back of PoliSci 1 lectures might just be

Reagan incarnate. And you. Were you student body president?
Are you a people person? Ready to take J.F.K.'s words to heart and

do what you can for your country? I hope the following soundtrack inspires you at every step
along the way.

1. The Campaign Trail
Arguably the toughest part of any political career is convincing other people that
you're fit for the job, especially as a first-time candidate. Go for the ail-American artists that
radiate warmth, fuzziness and patriotism — like Bruce Springsteen. This will act as a mag
net for people over the age of 55, or anyone registered with the AARP. To get the young,
idealistic college student's vote, insist that you plan on revolutionizing society, first by erad
icating poverty iu your region. Use the hip Sri Lanken rapper MlA'ssong' Pull Up The Peo
ple" to show that not only are you "down" with the kids' music, but that you truly care about
supporting independent artists.

2. Victory

Hey! Way to go. You (hopefully) won the election. Breathe deeply, take
a bubble bath and celebrate. Any traditional song played at a wedding, bar/bat
. mitzvah or baseball stadium will do, for example: "Twist and Shout" by The Bea-

tles, "We Are the Champions" by Queen. "The Cha-Cha Slide'" by
Casper/Colta...

3. Workin' For The Man
After the party's over, your slow-twitch muscles have to kick in.
You could be stuck with this job for a while, so it's important to eat lots of
lean protein and drink Gatorade to keep up your endurance. Fhe Dis
tance." by Cake, will keep you motivated right from the starting line. Ready
to race, but don't know where to begin? I'd recommend downloading the
entire School House Rocks soundtrack, with particular emphasis on "I'm
Just A Bill." School House Rocks will take you up to about a fourth grade
understanding of the American government, though it may take a little more
work to get you to this level of English grammar.

4. 00p5... 1 did it again.
Oh. silly politicians. It's pretty difficult these days to keep a
clean record with the nosy media and modern technologies. We all know what

can happen with White House interns ("Let's Get It On'

Marvin Gaye), but even seemingly innocent burglaries

of the Democratic National Committee headquar
ters can get blown out of proportion ("Mission: Im
possible" movie theme). As much as we would like
to hold our nation's leaders to a higher standard,
we must come to terms with your humanity and

propensity to royally screw things up. However, this doesn't mean

you're off the hook. You have two courses of action:

4A. Deny, Deny, Deny
There's a chance that if vou tell enough people a rose-tinted version of events, you will
bemn to believe it vourself. Then at least your case will be more convincing. 1 he song that
fits this particular path like a wetsuit is Shaggy's classic "It Wasn t Me. Did they catch you

on the counter, in the shower, on camera? Repeat after Bill: "I did not have sexual relations
with that woman." Or the more universal Tom DeLay: "I have violated no law. no rule, no
regulation of the House." No matter what you've done, there will always be someone who's
denied having done it before in American politics.

48. Acknowle lge and Apologize
Owning up to the truth will make you sleep better at night
and with enough evidence, may be the inevitable outcome
of path 4A anyway. After holding confession with the
American public, you'll need to ask for forgiveness. Say i
you're sorry in several languages like Madonna in I

"Sorry" to cover all of your bases. If that s too direct,
apologize in stages like Badly Drawn Boy's "1 Was

Wrong" and "You Were Right." In the end, a con

stituency will he more likely to reelect an honest

candidate than one who is incredibly suspi
cious. Which leads us to the final step of

the process...

5. End of the term, considering reelec
tion?

All good things must come to an
end. with your term as a public ser
vant being no exception. You
should probably take a vacation
or two ("Holiday" —Weezer)
to clear your mind before decid- g
ing whether or not to give it an- J
other shot. Think you've had
. .

enough fun with Ameri
can politics for one life
time? It may be time to,

na na na na, hey hey
hey, kiss it goodbye.
If you think you've

got what it takes for
reelection, though,
at least you'll know
what you're get-

ting yourself into.
The music video
for Ok Go's
"Here It Goes
Again" sums it
up nicely. As a
politician, you
might be work
ing incredibly
hard only to feel
like you're going
nowhere, like
running on a
treadmill. Of
course, we can't
all have the sta
mina and wis
dom of The West
Wing's President
Bartlett, but CJ
even made it to
Chief of Staff as a
Cal grad. At least
we're all starting
off on the right
foot.
