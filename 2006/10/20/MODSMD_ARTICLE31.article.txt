### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION NAUGHTY GIRL 
To go along with the political theme of this
week's Intermission, Roxy figured she'd write
about something that politicians do best: sex
scandals. There are many levels of scandal. For
the purposes of this article, 1 have labeled them
one through five. Typically, these levels are not
determined by the scandalous act, but by the
people committing that act. Let's pick a sexual
activity — a good ol' fashioned blow job. for ex
ample — and see how it can become scandalous
on various levels.
A level one scandal involves everyday people
in slightly irregular situations. Perhaps you blew
your roommate's date to special dinner. (For
those of you who have no clue what special din
ner is, it's basically a night of cheap wine, good
food, and — if you're cute/lucky/drunk enough
— even better dessert.)
A level two scandal involves everyday people
in highly irregular situations. Say you blew your
roommate after special dinner. The combina
tion of oddity and dormcest make it a definite
dos.
Level three is much like level one, only it in
volves the alliance of everyday people with pub
lic or superior figures. Was your roommate's
date an athlete? Was he a grad student? Or,
worst case scenario, was it his or her incestuous
uncle Joe? A level one scandal can also escalate
to level three if, say, you are photographed in the
act and the photo is then repeatedly posted on
Face book.
As politicians are public figures, level three is

the minimum rating for a
political scandal. While
Bill and Monica are a
» famous three, a lesser
known story may be
that of President Hard
ing. Carrie Phillips, a
i regular Ohioan girl and
one of Harding's many
mistresses, was appar
ently given $20,000 to
keep their affair under
wraps. That's one ex
pensive blow job.
Roxy's personal fave
is level four, as it's the
most fun she can have
without breaking the
law. To achieve this rat
ing, a scandal must in
volve two or more pub
lic figures. Did football
players 6 and 9 blow
each other? Four for
sure. (Roxy apologizes
to Stanford players 6
and 9; she doesn't even
know if you two exist,
and if you do, she is sure
y'all and the rest of your
team are the living pro-

totypes of heterosexuality.
Even if you do shower together, wear pants
tighter than ballet costumes, slap each other's
asses on a more-than-regular basis and lose to
the most effeminate teams in the nation.)

If we're talking presidents, Bush and Dick
are a four waiting to happen-
Level five is a strange and perverted bunch.
A rating of five is given whenever minors are in
l/All/nrl Ciimriciri/tlii

voivea. surprisingly, lives
occur more often than
I you'd think. Is your
sixth-grade sister getting
it on with her prepubes
cent boyfriend? Five. Is
your significant other
still in high-school?
Five. Is that cute frosh in
your section still 17?
Five. As much as Roxy
loves a good virgin, she
unfortunately can't con
done hooking up with
your ProFros, or park
ing your Beemer outside
of Palo Alto High in
hopes of finding a lover
who hasn't been spoiled
by college and gonor
rhea.
Ex-Congressman
| Mark Foley knows a
i thing or two about fives.
J A number of sketchy on
line conversations he
once had with a 16-year
old boy were recently
uncovered and published

the world to see. For example:
Mafs4: we will be adjourned ny then
Teen: oh good

Mafs4: by
Mafs4: then we can have a few drinks
Mafs4: 10l
Teen: yes yes;-)
Maf 54: your not old enough to drink
Teen: shhh...
Mafs4: ok
Teen: that's not what my ID says
Teen: 10l
Mafs4: ok
Teen: I probably shouldn't be telling you that
huh
Mafs4: we may need to drink at my house so we
don't get busted
Mark, Mark. Mark. Or, should 1 say, Ma£s4.
This was a five waiting to happen. Also note the
non-sexual scandals present in this conversation.
A Congressman who uses "lol," condones teen
drinking, and doesn't know the difference be
tween "your and "you're." Good goin', Republi
cans.
Roxy's all for scandal, as long as it isn't of the
Foley type. In fact, she looks for it. Whether it's
one through four, with your roommate's uncle
Joe or with future presidents and Congressmen
of America, I'm there! If not to participate, get
ideas for my next kinky story.
