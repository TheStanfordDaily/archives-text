# Inside The Game: Trips Formation

### Christopher Anderson 
Arizona State coach Dirk Koetter brought a vertical passing game with him to Tempe when he
took the job in 2001. In this play, the Sun Devils cut USC's lead to seven by putting three men in
the pattern to the left side. The backfield receivers crossed and went upfield while tight end Zach
Miller (86) ran a hook route at the goal line. Quarterback Rudy Carpenter (12) picked out the open
man. One of Arizona State's most productive and versatile players, Miller made the catch at the one
yard line and fell over the Trojan cornerback for the touchdown.
