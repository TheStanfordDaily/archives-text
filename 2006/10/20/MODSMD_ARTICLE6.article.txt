## Hersh warns of Iraq meltdown Pulitzer-winning journalist bashes Bush at keynote speech for Abu Ghraib conference 
### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
The Abu Ghraib torture scandal has
wrought untold psychological damage to
American soldiers and to the U.S. reputa
tion in the Middle East, eminent inves
tigative journalist Seymour Hersh told a
packed house at Kresge Auditorium yes
terday evening.
"After Vietnam, our troops came back
in disgrace and were called babykillers,
but the Iraq war has engendered the
most violent soldiers we have probably
ever produced," Hersh said to students
and community members reclining in
seats, sitting in aisles, lining the walls and
listening to the broadcast outside. "The
carnage going on that troops have done
collectively is just breathtaking, but there
is no stigma.The soldiers are just as much
victims as the people they killed."
"Something is going on in Iraq now."
he continued. "God knows what, but it's
not good."
Hersh, an investigative journalist for
The New Yorker who broke the Abu
Ghraib prison scandal in 2004, gave the
keynote address for the two-day long
conference, "Thinking Humanity After
Abu Ghraib." The event, sponsored by
Stanford Continuing Studies and a broad
coalition of humanities departments and
institutes at the University, is meant to
address the torture scandal at Abu
Ghraib from legal, philosophical, psy
chological. political and ethical perspec
tives.
Hersh began his address by lambast
ing the Bush administration and then

compared the Abu Ghraib scandal with
the My Lai massacre, a story he received
the Pulitzer prize for breaking in 1970.
"By my reckoning, there are about
824 days left in reign of King George II,"
Hersh said. ITie good news is that to
morrow, there will be one less day."
Hersh accused the Bush administra
tion of doing irreparable damage to the
American image in the Middle East
through the Abu Ghraib scandal and said
that the Iraq campaign was driven by a
dangerous ideological fanaticism.
"I have an old friend, a very tough Is
raeli, who said to me, 'We can be really
vulgar in our prisons, but if we had done
to young Arab men what you had done in
Abu Ghraib and photographed it. we
would not be able to live with them. Do
you understand what you've done?' Re
venge in that society can be five genera
tions long," he said.
On Bush, Hersh commented."! be
lieve his motivation is democracy â€” he
really thought that if you overthrew Sad
dam. democracy would spread like
water, making the Middle East safer for
oil. yes, but also safer for America and
safer for Israel... Is there anything more
dangerous than a revolutionary unable
to think or grow?"
Hersh also argued that the situation
in Iraq will not improve in the next few
years and Iraq as a whole is "gone." leav
ing the U.S. few alternatives.
"We basically have two deadlines: ei
ther get out by midnight tonight, or get
out by midnight tomorrow." Hersh said
to riotous applause.
He then moved on to the Abu Ghraib

scandal,criticizing Bush for not speaking
out against the problem sooner.
"Bush knew about il in January and
what did the President of the United
States do about this flagrant action?
Nada...You want to know about chain of
command, there it is."
"I think it was great. He offered a
barrage of information and a wealth of

anecdotes not available anywhere else."
said Andrew J. Mitchell, co-organizer of
the event and post-doctoral fellow in phi
losophy."! Ie is .truly one of the premiere
journalists in the U.S."
The conference on Abu Ghraib will
continue tomorrow with talks bv various

speakers, including psychologist and
Stanford professor Philip Zimbardo,
longtime New Yorker staff writer
Mark Danner and clinical social

worker and psychotherapist Gerald
Gray.
I lei sh concluded his talk by com
paring the impact of Abu C ihraib with
the My Lai massacre. Both, he said,
did devastating psychological and
physiological damage to I J.S. soldiers
as well as the victims themselves.
"Above and beyond the chaos left
in Iraq, we have an emerging health

crisis that's going to create a stagger
ing problem," he said, noting that as
of 2005 the Department of Veterans
Affairs had reported I (>O,OOO people
with medical or psychological trau
mas.
"We're going to have a public
health issue besides the social issue,"
Hersh declared. "We haven't even
begun to see the effects of this war."
