## Former HP CEO tells GSB to take chances Fiorina addresses gender in business, argues against Fortune ranking of top businesswomen 
### CAMILA TAPERNOUX 
"The louder the noise, the more progress you are mak
ing." Carly Fiorina, former Hewlett-Packard CEO. told
her audience Thursday afternoon at a sold-out Bishop Au
ditorium.The response was deafening applause — a testa
ment to the progress Fiorina represents in her own life and
as an example for women in business.
A law school drop-out ousted from her position at HP
in 2005. Fiorina was the first female CEO of a Fortune 20
firm and was voted the most powerful woman in business
by Fortune magazine six years in a row.
"Whatever job you have, learn everything you can
from that job," Fiorina advised graduate students from a
variety of disciplines. She said she developed that philoso
phy during her first job as a secretary, where she was soon
asked to help the company executives write a deal.
"Leadership is all about seeing possibilities in people
and seeing possibilities in circumstances," Fiorina said.
Executives certainly saw possibility in Fiorina, who joined
AT&T in as a management trainee and rose to be
come executive vice president of AT&T affiliate Lucent
Technologies before joining HP in 199 1 ).
"There is a difference between leadership and man
agement," Fiorina continued. "Leadership is about chang
ing the order of things. It is natural to maintain the status
quo. People fear change, and a leader has to understand
that fear in order to motivate people to change."
Fiorina also emphasized the value in finding common
ground with business partners, illustrating her point with
unexpected anecdotes.
"Mv first job at AT&T was a lucrative account with an
older gentleman," Fiorina said. At
the last minute, her boss took her off
the account because they were meet
ing at a strip club. A determined Fio
rina, however, refused to lose her
first major deal and attended the
meeting anyway.
"1 really did look like an idiot.and
I was terrified," she said of the expe
rience. "But while 1 was terrified, I
would not be intimidated. While I
could not pick those circumstances, I
could choose how to deal with
them."

And Fiorina said that, while she
was honored by the recognition she
received from Fortune, she disagreed
with the idea of ranking top female
executives in their own list.
"It implies that there is a women's
ladder and a men's ladder,and there
fore that it is women versus men,"
she said. "Business ought to he a
sport where everyone gets to plav,
and when everyone gets to play, the
game is better."
The media, she added, should
"showcase leaders of all genders

and backgrounds as opposed to say
ing'let's talk about women leaders.'
An effective communicator is au
thentic, tells it like it is, and collabo
rates effectively with lots of differ
ent people," she said. "None of
these have anything to do with gen
der."
Second-year business student
Alexandra LeMacon said she was
impressed with Fiorina's stage pres
ence. Fiorina, she added, "emanated
confidence and power."
Menaka Kalaskar.a first-year law

student, said Fiorina's speech taught
her about the importance of commu
nication, especially with people from
different backgrounds. Kalaskar de
scribed Fiorina as "brilliant," adding
that Fiorina's tales of all levels of the
corporate world were enlightening.
"Many Stanford grads probably
go straight to high-level manage
ment positions and don't get to see
this perspective," she mused.
"She was really funny too,"
Kalaskar added. "1 was duly im
pressed."
