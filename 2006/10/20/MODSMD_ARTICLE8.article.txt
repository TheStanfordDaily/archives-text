## Judicial report shows rising sexual assaults Reported increase may be due to efforts to encourage victims to come forward

Reports of campus sexual assault and rela
tionship violence are on the rise, according
to figures out of the Office of Judicial Af
fairs on this summer's Judicial Panel hear

During the 2005-06 academic year,
seven students — five male undergradu

there were none.

to argue that the jump in reported assaults
does not necessarily mean that violent
crime is increasing.

"It is my personal opinion that the in
crease in reports of sexual assault and rela

Affairs is a result of victims' willingness to
come forward and ask that their assailant
he held accountable for their actions and
not as a result of an increase in incidents
which have occurred" said Judicial Advi
sor Laurette Beeson.
Beeson said her office has made the ju
dicial process more accessible to victims of
relationship violence and sexual assault.
Anyone can call the office anonymously to
get information about the process for fil
ing a complaint without any obligation to
do so, she added.
"One of the University's goals has been
to encourage those who have been affect
ed by sexual violence to report what has
happened to them and to seek resources,"
Beeson said, citing the creation of the Sex
ual Violence Advisory Board.
Other Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard violations remained at usual lev
