# CAMPUS AFFAIRS
## Judicial report shows rising sexual assaults Reported increase may be due to efforts to encourage victims to come forward 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Reports of campus sexual assault and rela
tionship violence are on the rise, according
to figures out of the Office of Judicial Af
fairs on this summer's Judicial Panel hear
ings.
During the 2005-06 academic year,
seven students — five male undergradu
ate students and two male graduate stu
dents — were reported for varying de
grees of relationship violence or sexual as
sault. During 2004-05, there were just two
cases reported, and in the three years prior
there were none.
But Judicial Affairs officials were quick
to argue that the jump in reported assaults
does not necessarily mean that violent
crime is increasing.

"It is my personal opinion that the in
crease in reports of sexual assault and rela
tionship violence to the Office of Judicial
Affairs is a result of victims' willingness to
come forward and ask that their assailant
he held accountable for their actions and
not as a result of an increase in incidents
which have occurred" said Judicial Advi
sor Laurette Beeson.
Beeson said her office has made the ju
dicial process more accessible to victims of
relationship violence and sexual assault.
Anyone can call the office anonymously to
get information about the process for fil
ing a complaint without any obligation to
do so, she added.
"One of the University's goals has been
to encourage those who have been affect
ed by sexual violence to report what has
happened to them and to seek resources,"
Beeson said, citing the creation of the Sex
ual Violence Advisory Board.
Other Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard violations remained at usual lev
els. The Computer Science Department
had ten students called before Judicial Af-
fairs this summer — all ten were in
volved in the same case, however.
ITiis number was the highest among
all departments — not a surprise to
Beeson. who said the Computer Sci
ence Department is a perennial con
tender for this dubious honor.
"Computer Science typically re
ports about 25 cases per year to
Stanford's Office of Judicial Af
fairs," she said. "Nationally, comput
er science departments report more
cases of academic dishonesty than
other departments, partially because

the violations are easier to detect
due to a software program called
M( )SS written by Stanford professor
Alex Aiken."
For the cases from the 2005-06
academic year heard thus far, the
harshest sanctions for 1 lonor Code
violations were a two-quarter sus
pension and 60 hours of communi
ty service issued to an undergradu
ate who copied extensively
throughout an in-class exam and a
four-quarter suspension issued to
an undergraduate who plagiarized
for the second time. And the three
Fundamental Standard cases for
2005-06 that received the harshest
sanctions involved the sale of
drugs, sexual assault, and relation
ship violence.
