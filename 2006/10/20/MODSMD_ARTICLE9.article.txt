# CAMPUS EVENT
## AIDS experts to speak at cross-campus conference MacArthur winner Kim to address FACE AIDS 
### EMMA TROTTER 
Students from universities across the
country will converge on the Farm for the
next two days to attend talks, panels and
workshops geared toward educating the
public about the spread of HIV and to
brainstorm about how to encourage stu
dents to create chapters of the Stanford
founded awareness group FACE AIDS at
other campuses.
Dr. Jim Kim, a winner of the

Mac Arthur Genius Grant and one of
Time Magazine's 100 most influential
people this year, will give the forum's
keynote address tonight at 7:00 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium. Kim is the co-founder
of Partners in Health (PIH), the interna
tional aid organization that will receive
the money raised by FACE AIDS. Fresh
men may recognize him as a central figure
in "Mountains Beyond Mountains," one
of the three books read and discussed by
the class of 2010 during their first week on
campus.
"The goal is to present an idea of why
FACE AIDS has chosen Fill as the recip
ient for its fundraising campaign," said
