As a Technology Associate at Bridgewater, you'll work on some of
the most challenging and complex computer science problems in
the world, with the rewards that you can get only at a financial
firm. From day one, you'll be running your own projects, which may
include building systems that compute our views on different mar
kets by processing gigabytes of up-to-the-minute economic data,
or developing autonomous agents that execute trades based on
the evaluation of real-time market conditions.
We believe Bridgewater provides better opportunities than soft
ware companies and other financial firms. Our culture is also dras
tically different. Even our most junior employees are encouraged,
and expected, to challenge and criticize management of all levels.
This isn't some ideal we print in our public literature; it's some
thing we practice every day. This approach allows us to constantly
improve our operations and consistently beat the markets.
Technology is central to our success and to maintaining our com
petitive edge. Our systematic approach to investing and creative
use of technology make our superior track record possible. With M
more than $160 billion in assets under management, we're one of W
the largest managers of hedge fund strategies in the world. With RR|[^(s^\A/VXT^R
fewer than 350 employees, your work will make a difference.
