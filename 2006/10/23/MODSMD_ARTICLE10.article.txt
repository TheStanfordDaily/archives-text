## Party pirates are real

Last Saturday I woke up with dried blood on my lip. 1 examined my
self in the mirror, trying to recall how 1 could have busted my lip open.
Nothing was coming, and then there on my chin: a bruise. 1 began to re
member...
I was partying upstairs in Phi Sig. It was a bedroom, so it quickly
grew too hot and sweaty and crowded.Taken with a restless feeling. I
shot up from my seat and descended the stairs. When 1 landed. I was
immediately swept onto the dance floor. After about 20 minutes of
doing the robot, i realized upstairs wasn't so bad. so 1 began making
my way to the stairs - only, unbeknownst to me. 1 was going the wrong
way.
Somehow, a conga line had formed behind me by the time 1 had
reached the front area of the house, and judging by the pushing and
shoving.some people were not taking kindly to it.Then, without warn
'<? ing. 1 was pushed from behind, which forced me to bump into some
one. She reeked of tequila and people and did not take kindly to our
contact. As she put it.
"AAAAAARRRRR. YA JACKASS!"
1 asked her if she were a pirate and she punched me in the face. 1
took that as a yes.
