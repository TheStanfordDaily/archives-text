## Editorial Board Has ITSS gotten the message?

Re:... widespread email problems?
A few weeks ago, when campus email
started acting up again. Stanford Informa
tion and Technology Systems and Services
(ITSS) spoke of it as an anomaly caused by
unusually high message volumes. At the
time, the details of what caused this spike
were sparse. A cyber-attack was not ruled
out. Now ITSS is more confident that it has
pinpointed the culprit as the unusually high
message load accompanying the return of
"Stanford.edu" users to campus this au
tumn. ITSS was clearly caught off-guard
and should have built in a greater "buffer
zone" to handle spikes in traffic. In the in
tervening time, it has taken steps to remedy
the oversight by adding new servers and
setting stricter limits on spam mail.
The Daily did a poor job of explaining
the problem and its effect on students. For
example, the headline of The Daily's Oct. 4
article, "Spam Deletion Causes Problems
with Webmail," was inaccurate. The prob
lems affected all campus email users, not
just Webmail users, and the new spam dele
tion measures were actually part of the so
lution, not one of the causes. It is worth ex
plaining how these measures actually work,
and what is different about them. As much
as 50 percent of the email that comes
through Stanford's can be identified as
spam through obvious signs like an incom
plete sender address; these messages have
always been caught and deleted automati
cally. Starting Oct. 3. ITSS also began delet
ing messages that have a more than a 90
percent likelihood of being spam, which ac
counts for about 25 percent of the emails
that make it through the first round of dele
tions. A higher accuracy rate than 90 per
cent for the second round would obviously
inspire more confidence, but.given the uni
versal importance of campus email, it was
smart to act immediately and count on
making adjustments later. ITSS plans to
allow students to opt out of the program,
and they should make this option available
soon. Students should do their part to he
good cyber-citizens by setting Spam limits
as strictly as possible. Can you remember
the last time a message marked (####]
turned out to be important?
The recent changes have prevented new
outbreaks of the most serious email prob
lems— extremely slow response times,
login failures and blank screens — but too
many minor annoyances persist, especially
with Webmail. Pages take too long to load,
document attachments fail to reach their
destination at an alarmingly high rate and
login problems still occur inexplicably from
time to time. Ihese issues hurt the produc
tivity of students and faculty, and they are
frankly an embarrassment at a school that
markets itself as a technology leader. ITSS
will be releasing an upgrade to Webmail in
early November that it claims will fix some
of these specific issues. The upgrade can

only be greeted as good news, but we will
save our elation until the upgraded pro
gram receives its true test from campus
users.
Ke:.. .The Webmail interface?
The Webmail upgrade slated for release
in early November will feature changes to
the program's notoriously mediocre inter
face. ITSS provided the editorial board with
a sneak peek at ;t pilot of the upgraded pro
gram. and we can attest that it contains
some significant and overdue improve
ments. For example, there is a convenient
tool bar on the left side of the page with
drop-down access to some basic functions,
following the format of more advanced pro
grams like Gmail. There is also a vastly im
proved address book, more convenient op
tions for setting Inbox filters and more effi
cient (though not perfect) message search
capabilities. The program appears to run
more quickly, although that could be attrib
uted to the "pilot" status of the one we were
using. Unfortunately. ITSS hasn't given up
on the drab earth tones that make using
Webmail feel like staring at a texture-less
piece of tree bark.
As a general trend.students who demand
high-performance functionality, like dorm
RCCs, already use other programs like
Thunderbird or Gmail. Only the lazy and
the "suckers" still use Webmail, or so they
say. While the latest upgrade lacks the bells
and whistles that might bring back apostate
users, ITSS wants you to know that Novem
ber will not be the end of the story. Starting
next year, it will begin a broader explorato
ry phase to reexamine the University's total
email offerings, and it hopes to formulate
recommendations as early as next summer.
As one ITSS representative told us."Begin
ning in 2007 we will look at what products
are available, both on the commercial and
the open-source marketplaces, and look to
see how those products might align them
selves with the needs of Stanford users."
This process could lead to major
changes. For example. ITSS might consider
licensing more sophisticated commercial
software, or it could decide to adopt some
thing like the email program that Google
now offers to colleges free of charge, with
built-in features such as instant messaging
and a page designing service. One of the
specific features ITSS says it is looking for is
better integration of email with other stan
dard functions such as the desktop calen
dar. which could prove to be a real benefit
to over-scheduled students. ITSS should
continue to solicit input from RCCs and
other computer-savvy individuals, as well as
regular users, to determine other helpful
features without sacrificing usability.
Here's to hoping that ITSS is in an ad
venturous mood as it goes about its re
search next year. As far as email is con
cerned. the more changes, the better.
