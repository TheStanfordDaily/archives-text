# NorKs go nuclear
## 
### 
Earlier this month, the North Koreans
defied the world by conducting an
underground nuclear weapons test.
This was bad news for US foreign policy
and it came as an embarrassment to the
Bush administration, whose critics said that
it may have invaded the wrong country. As
we shall see. the test may also have been
bad news for North Korean scientists.
Mounting evidence suggests that the test
was actually a flop.
In a statement released Monday, the
newly created office of the US Director of
National Intelligence confirmed that the
test was indeed nuclear, but the blast was
surprisingly small.
Amidst all of the political fallout, the
news has provided science enthusiasts and
armchair security buffs with plenty of excus
es to speculate. Was the North Korean nu
clear test actually a failure? If so, why? I low
do we know?
Rahlooic or Rurflop?
On October 9 at 10:36 a.m. local time,
seismographs on the Korean peninsula de
tected a tremor of magnitude 3.58 to 3.7.
which was independently confirmed by
countless other governments. When scien
tists around the globe began to crunch the
numbers, they realized that a tremor of this
size corresponded to a blast unusually small
for a nuclear weapon, on the order of one
kiloton or less. A kiloton is still enough to
destroy a good chunk of Manhattan,but it is
a far cry from the primitive 20 kiloton de
vice that the US dropped on Nagasaki, hi
ther the explosion was a failure or it wasn't
actually a nuclear bomb.
The North Koreans could have created a
similar blast using 500 tons of common min
ing explosive, such as ammonium nitrate
and fuel oil. We now know that this was not
the case.The United States can actually test
for the presence of these weapons from
afar.

Smelling a Rat
When an underground nuclear weapon
goes off. radioactive gases will often leak
into the atmosphere. Because these gasses
contain radioactive elements that are con
stantly decaying, their relative concentra
tion provides scientists with important clues
about the time of detonation and the
bomb's composition. Moreover, these
gasses can be detected from very far away.
For example, just 100 atoms of Xenon 133
and 135 in one cubic meter of air is enough
for scientists to determine the presence of
the North Korean test from 1000 miles into
the Sea of Japan. Under the US Air Force
Constant Phoenix program, modified WC-
I3SVV weather planes do just that by swab
bing the sky with the theoretical equivalent
of giant cotton swabs. Presumably a plane
such as the W( - 135W picked up radioactive
elements from the blast and allowed the US
to conclude that the North Korean explo
sion was actually a very low yield or failed
nuclear weapon detonation.
Generally nations test nuclear weapons
as a deterrent. In effect, testing nations are
saying/'Don't mess with us! We got nukes...
and they work!" Hie deterrent effect how
ever is lost if the nuclear weapons don't
work.The North Koreans have been work
ing on their nuclear project for many years.
One would have expected them to test a
bomb that thev were extremely confident

would work.This one didn't. So what
were the North Koreans doing? It
looks like they may have just
goofed.
Nobody Said it Was Easy
Making nuclear weapons isn't
easy. 'ITiere are a number of places
for a misstep. Moreover, the North
Koreans chose a difficult path by
opting to field a plutonium bomb in
stead of a simpler uranium one. We
know a lot about the North Korean
plutonium weapons project because
visiting Stanford professor and for
mer director of Los Alamos Sig
I lecker actually went out and visited
two years ago. I le even got to hold a

peanut butter jar full of their pluto
nium with his bare hands.
Whereas plutonium-239 is easier
to acquire than uranium — it can be
created covertly from nuclear power
reactors and doesn't need to be en
riched — the bombs produced by
plutonium are tricky to make. To
detonate correctly, plutonium
bombs require a perfectly spherical
implosion from conventional explo
sives timed to trigger just right with
a neutron source. If the convention
al explosives don't implode spheri
cally, or it the neutron source fires
too early, the plutonium will begin to
fission before it is compressed
enough to start a chain reaction.This
causes a lower yield explosion, like
the one the North Koreans wit
nessed.
One Step at a Time
Normally, nations can test these

non-nuclear components extensive
ly before a full-blown nuclear test.
However. North Korean scientists
may have lacked access to the equip
ment to make those tests worth
while, like super-fast cameras. Even
so.it appears that the North Koreans
may have gotten ahead of them
selves in other ways. Instead of test
ing a rudimentary bomb first, it
seems that the North Koreans
leaped ahead to test a more minia
turized and advanced design. The
New York Times reported that
North Korean officials had designed
the bomb for a four kiloton,yield im
plying that they had something else
in mind. In a recent article in Arms
Control Today, former US nuclear
weapons designer Richard Garwin
suggests that this 4-kiloton bomb
was probably designed to be small
enough to fit one of North Korean's
missiles.

So instead of taking it slow
testing a safe but simple design first
and working up to a missiles ready
design — the North Koreans took a
long shot and got burned.
Hack to the Drawing Hoard
The North Koreans may have
bitten off more than they can chew,
but they still got their point across:
they have nuclear weapons and are
willing to use them. They may not
have reached their design specs this
time around, but it is safe to say that
they will succeed in due time. Mean
while. I'll) su;v Kim Jong Il's chief
weapons designer — it he's still
around — has some explaining to
do.

countless other governments. When scien
tists around the globe began to crunch the
numbers, they realized that a tremor of this
size corresponded to a blast unusually small
for a nuclear weapon, on the order of one
kiloton or less. A kiloton is still enough to
destroy a good chunk of Manhattan,but it is
a far cry from the primitive 20 kiloton de
vice that the US dropped on Nagasaki, hi
ther the explosion was a failure or it wasn't
actually a nuclear bomb.
The North Koreans could have created a
similar blast using 500 tons of common min
ing explosive, such as ammonium nitrate
and fuel oil. We now know that this was not
the case.The United States can actually test
for the presence of these weapons from
afar.

Smelling a Rat
When an underground nuclear weapon
goes off. radioactive gases will often leak
into the atmosphere. Because these gasses
contain radioactive elements that are con
stantly decaying, their relative concentra
tion provides scientists with important clues
about the time of detonation and the
bomb's composition. Moreover, these
gasses can be detected from very far away.
For example, just 100 atoms of Xenon 133
and 135 in one cubic meter of air is enough
for scientists to determine the presence of
the North Korean test from 1000 miles into
the Sea of Japan. Under the US Air Force
Constant Phoenix program, modified WC-
I3SVV weather planes do just that by swab
bing the sky with the theoretical equivalent
of giant cotton swabs. Presumably a plane
such as the W( - 135W picked up radioactive
elements from the blast and allowed the US
to conclude that the North Korean explo
sion was actually a very low yield or failed
nuclear weapon detonation.
Generally nations test nuclear weapons
as a deterrent. In effect, testing nations are
saying/'Don't mess with us! We got nukes...
and they work!" Hie deterrent effect how
ever is lost if the nuclear weapons don't
work.The North Koreans have been work
ing on their nuclear project for many years.

bomb that thev were extremely confident

were the North Koreans doing? It
looks like they may have just
goofed.
Nobody Said it Was Easy
Making nuclear weapons isn't
easy. 'ITiere are a number of places
for a misstep. Moreover, the North
Koreans chose a difficult path by
opting to field a plutonium bomb in
stead of a simpler uranium one. We
know a lot about the North Korean
plutonium weapons project because
visiting Stanford professor and for
mer director of Los Alamos Sig
I lecker actually went out and visited
two years ago. I le even got to hold a

peanut butter jar full of their pluto
nium with his bare hands.
Whereas plutonium-239 is easier
to acquire than uranium — it can be
created covertly from nuclear power
reactors and doesn't need to be en
riched — the bombs produced by
plutonium are tricky to make. To
detonate correctly, plutonium
bombs require a perfectly spherical
implosion from conventional explo
sives timed to trigger just right with
a neutron source. If the convention
al explosives don't implode spheri
cally, or it the neutron source fires
too early, the plutonium will begin to
fission before it is compressed
enough to start a chain reaction.This
causes a lower yield explosion, like
the one the North Koreans wit
nessed.
One Step at a Time
Normally, nations can test these

non-nuclear components extensive
ly before a full-blown nuclear test.
However. North Korean scientists
may have lacked access to the equip
ment to make those tests worth
while, like super-fast cameras. Even
so.it appears that the North Koreans
may have gotten ahead of them
selves in other ways. Instead of test
ing a rudimentary bomb first, it
seems that the North Koreans
leaped ahead to test a more minia
turized and advanced design. The
New York Times reported that
North Korean officials had designed
the bomb for a four kiloton,yield im
plying that they had something else
in mind. In a recent article in Arms
Control Today, former US nuclear
weapons designer Richard Garwin
suggests that this 4-kiloton bomb
was probably designed to be small
enough to fit one of North Korean's
missiles.

So instead of taking it slow
testing a safe but simple design first
and working up to a missiles ready
design — the North Koreans took a
long shot and got burned.
Hack to the Drawing Hoard
The North Koreans may have
bitten off more than they can chew,
but they still got their point across:
they have nuclear weapons and are
willing to use them. They may not
have reached their design specs this
time around, but it is safe to say that
they will succeed in due time. Mean
while. I'll) su;v Kim Jong Il's chief
weapons designer — it he's still
around — has some explaining to
do.

Earlier this month, the North Koreans
defied the world by conducting an
underground nuclear weapons test.
This was bad news for US foreign policy
and it came as an embarrassment to the
Bush administration, whose critics said that
it may have invaded the wrong country. As
we shall see. the test may also have been
bad news for North Korean scientists.
Mounting evidence suggests that the test
was actually a flop.
In a statement released Monday, the
newly created office of the US Director of
National Intelligence confirmed that the
test was indeed nuclear, but the blast was
surprisingly small.
Amidst all of the political fallout, the
news has provided science enthusiasts and
armchair security buffs with plenty of excus
es to speculate. Was the North Korean nu
clear test actually a failure? If so, why? I low
do we know?
Rahlooic or Rurflop?
