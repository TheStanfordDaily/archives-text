# NorKs go nuclear
## 
### 
Earlier this month, the North Koreans
defied the world by conducting an
underground nuclear weapons test.
This was bad news for US foreign policy
and it came as an embarrassment to the
Bush administration, whose critics said that
it may have invaded the wrong country. As
we shall see. the test may also have been
bad news for North Korean scientists.
Mounting evidence suggests that the test
was actually a flop.
In a statement released Monday, the
newly created office of the US Director of
National Intelligence confirmed that the
test was indeed nuclear, but the blast was
surprisingly small.
Amidst all of the political fallout, the
news has provided science enthusiasts and
armchair security buffs with plenty of excus
es to speculate. Was the North Korean nu
clear test actually a failure? If so, why? I low
do we know?
Rahlooic or Rurflop?
On October 9 at 10:36 a.m. local time,
seismographs on the Korean peninsula de
tected a tremor of magnitude 3.58 to 3.7.
which was independently confirmed by
countless other governments. When scien
tists around the globe began to crunch the
numbers, they realized that a tremor of this
size corresponded to a blast unusually small
for a nuclear weapon, on the order of one
kiloton or less. A kiloton is still enough to
destroy a good chunk of Manhattan,but it is
a far cry from the primitive 20 kiloton de
vice that the US dropped on Nagasaki, hi
ther the explosion was a failure or it wasn't
actually a nuclear bomb.
The North Koreans could have created a
similar blast using 500 tons of common min
ing explosive, such as ammonium nitrate
and fuel oil. We now know that this was not
the case.The United States can actually test
for the presence of these weapons from
afar.

Smelling a Rat
When an underground nuclear weapon
goes off. radioactive gases will often leak
into the atmosphere. Because these gasses
contain radioactive elements that are con
stantly decaying, their relative concentra
tion provides scientists with important clues
about the time of detonation and the
bomb's composition. Moreover, these
gasses can be detected from very far away.
For example, just 100 atoms of Xenon 133
and 135 in one cubic meter of air is enough
for scientists to determine the presence of
the North Korean test from 1000 miles into
the Sea of Japan. Under the US Air Force
Constant Phoenix program, modified WC-
I3SVV weather planes do just that by swab
bing the sky with the theoretical equivalent
of giant cotton swabs. Presumably a plane
such as the W( - 135W picked up radioactive
elements from the blast and allowed the US
to conclude that the North Korean explo
sion was actually a very low yield or failed
nuclear weapon detonation.
Generally nations test nuclear weapons
as a deterrent. In effect, testing nations are
saying/'Don't mess with us! We got nukes...
and they work!" Hie deterrent effect how
ever is lost if the nuclear weapons don't
work.The North Koreans have been work
ing on their nuclear project for many years.
One would have expected them to test a
bomb that thev were extremely confident
