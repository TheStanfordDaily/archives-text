# There are places I remember

### 
I am a huge nerd. I'm not talking in the
"Stanford Nerd Pride" sense. For one
thing, there was already a column about
that last week, and I am well aware of that
column's existence, because I read every
page of the Daily every day (OK. that's a
dirty lie). But I'm not cool-nerdy in a "I'm
writing for the Stanford literary magazine
and doing my honors thesis while building an
electric car on the side and finishing my
memoir, which is being made into a movie
starring Lindsey Lohan" kind of way. I'm a
nerd in the nerdy kind of way. Or I was in
high school, at least, and I'm still recovering.
You see. I used to play computer games in
high school. A lot of them. Girly stuff like The
Sims and Rollercoaster Tycoon, sure, but also
Age of Empires 11, Unreal Tournament, Nox,
No One Lives Forever, Grim Fandango... And
I have extensive discussions about them, even
now. like about how the Morpheus level in
Unreal II was pretty kick-ass. except that I
had a tendency to fall into the void.
Playing computer games is the kind of
dork trap that girls don't usually fall into, but
I had an older brother, a lot of free time and
no hand-eye coordination. So I started out in
nocently enough with Reader Rabbit in my
youth and moved on to Monkey Island 1
through IV (Guybrush Threepwood? Any
body?). then The Sims and suddenly I'm hit

ting the hard stuff. Yeah. I'm talking Diablo 11.
What's really sad is that 1 wasn't even that
good at it. I would just play with my brother
and wait until something shiny appeared, and
then I was like,"That's a shiny necklace. I'ma
take it." And then, while I was admiring my
Amulet of Power, my brother would be left
alone to battle the undead hordes.
I was pretty decent at Age of Empires 11.
But, for the uninitiated. Age of Empires II
has a bunch of little workers and soldiers
whom you order around in order to build a
medieval society and work your way up
through the "ages." And what I actually ex
celled at was farming.
Yes! Not only did 1 play computer games,
but my specialty was agriculture.
The bright spot through all of this was that
playing computer games didn't carry quite
the same stigma for a girl. It even got me a lit
tle bit of attention from guys who were into

AoE II (Age of Empires 11, God), especially
at the math tournaments.
Oh, didn't I mention that 1 was a Hoover
High Mathlete? For five years?
Yeah. And it's not like I did it because 1
was the math equivalent of Bobby Fischer or
anything. This story doesn't end with me
winning the International Math Olympiad
against the USSR. It was more because when
they asked for volunteers to be on math
team in eighth grade, I was one of the few
whose "NERD ALERT" siren didn't go off.
In high-school. I kept doing it for the 2005
national math convention in Hawaii (hot ac
tion), and for the companionship. If not for
math team parties, how would I have spent
my Friday nights?
I mean, the invitations weren't exactly
rolling in after I recited "The Raven" from
memory in the middle of geometry class.
(Note: I wasn't Goth or anything. I had actu
ally memorized the damn thing in fifth grade
because I thought it was precocious. If I met
up with my fifth-grade self now, 1 would
smack her.) Luckily, it was math team geome
try, so the social damage wasn't too bad when
my teacher, who was skinny, wore glasses and
was probably the first kid on his block with an
Atari back in the day, asked me if I even want-


Sini
Matikainen
Slightly Sinister

i'd any friends. Oh. Mr. Parker, that
rascal. We ran him so ragged in
Geometry Team that he left to be
come an actuary, which sounds like
some nebulous religious position but
actually means that he loved matri
ces enough to marry them.
Anyway. I'm not even going to go
into my obsession with MST3K
(Mystery Science Theater 3000,
fool!), how much I loved Lord of (lie

Rings and Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy, the hand-crafted elf shoes 1
wore for luck for exams (... sigh), my
year of Scholar's Bowl, playing
Magic: The Gathering with my broth
er (1 just took the unicorn cards) or
the time I asked my E:nglish teacher
for a "vocabulary-enhancing novel"
that I could use to prepare for the
SAT, which is a story that I'm pretty
sure someone will still bring up at my
funeral service.
I'd like to think that I'm a func
tional member of society now. I have
a few friends (well, until this column
comes out), I go to the occasional
party and I usually refrain from

quoting my main man E.A. Poe dur
ing Math 51. But I'm not afraid to
risk these modest gains in order to
stay true to my past.
And if admitting I'm a nerd to the
population of a techie school
through a column that nobody reads
isn't bravery, then, sir. 1 don't know
what is.

Sini might not play too many comput
er games anymore, but she's jonesin'
for some AoEII action. Send an email
to Sinim@stan ford.edu if you have a
copy and want to hook a sister up. She
knows some people, and she wants to
party. LAN party, that is.

national math convention in Hawaii (hot ac
tion), and for the companionship. If not for
math team parties, how would I have spent
my Friday nights?
I mean, the invitations weren't exactly
rolling in after I recited "The Raven" from
memory in the middle of geometry class.
(Note: I wasn't Goth or anything. I had actu
ally memorized the damn thing in fifth grade
because I thought it was precocious. If I met
up with my fifth-grade self now, 1 would
smack her.) Luckily, it was math team geome
try, so the social damage wasn't too bad when
my teacher, who was skinny, wore glasses and
was probably the first kid on his block with an
Atari back in the day, asked me if I even want-


Sini
Matikainen
Slightly Sinister

i'd any friends. Oh. Mr. Parker, that
rascal. We ran him so ragged in
Geometry Team that he left to be
come an actuary, which sounds like
some nebulous religious position but
actually means that he loved matri
ces enough to marry them.
Anyway. I'm not even going to go
into my obsession with MST3K
(Mystery Science Theater 3000,
fool!), how much I loved Lord of (lie

Rings and Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy, the hand-crafted elf shoes 1
wore for luck for exams (... sigh), my
year of Scholar's Bowl, playing
Magic: The Gathering with my broth
er (1 just took the unicorn cards) or
the time I asked my E:nglish teacher
for a "vocabulary-enhancing novel"
that I could use to prepare for the
SAT, which is a story that I'm pretty
sure someone will still bring up at my
funeral service.
I'd like to think that I'm a func
tional member of society now. I have
a few friends (well, until this column
comes out), I go to the occasional
party and I usually refrain from

quoting my main man E.A. Poe dur
ing Math 51. But I'm not afraid to
risk these modest gains in order to
stay true to my past.
And if admitting I'm a nerd to the
population of a techie school
through a column that nobody reads
isn't bravery, then, sir. 1 don't know
what is.

Sini might not play too many comput
er games anymore, but she's jonesin'
for some AoEII action. Send an email
to Sinim@stan ford.edu if you have a
copy and want to hook a sister up. She
knows some people, and she wants to
party. LAN party, that is.
I am a huge nerd. I'm not talking in the
"Stanford Nerd Pride" sense. For one
thing, there was already a column about
that last week, and I am well aware of that
column's existence, because I read every
page of the Daily every day (OK. that's a
dirty lie). But I'm not cool-nerdy in a "I'm
writing for the Stanford literary magazine
and doing my honors thesis while building an
electric car on the side and finishing my
memoir, which is being made into a movie
starring Lindsey Lohan" kind of way. I'm a
nerd in the nerdy kind of way. Or I was in
high school, at least, and I'm still recovering.
You see. I used to play computer games in
high school. A lot of them. Girly stuff like The
Sims and Rollercoaster Tycoon, sure, but also
Age of Empires 11, Unreal Tournament, Nox,
No One Lives Forever, Grim Fandango... And
I have extensive discussions about them, even
now. like about how the Morpheus level in
Unreal II was pretty kick-ass. except that I
had a tendency to fall into the void.
Playing computer games is the kind of
dork trap that girls don't usually fall into, but
I had an older brother, a lot of free time and
no hand-eye coordination. So I started out in
nocently enough with Reader Rabbit in my
youth and moved on to Monkey Island 1
through IV (Guybrush Threepwood? Any
body?). then The Sims and suddenly I'm hit

ting the hard stuff. Yeah. I'm talking Diablo 11.
What's really sad is that 1 wasn't even that
good at it. I would just play with my brother
and wait until something shiny appeared, and
then I was like,"That's a shiny necklace. I'ma
take it." And then, while I was admiring my
Amulet of Power, my brother would be left
alone to battle the undead hordes.
I was pretty decent at Age of Empires 11.
But, for the uninitiated. Age of Empires II
has a bunch of little workers and soldiers
whom you order around in order to build a
medieval society and work your way up
through the "ages." And what I actually ex
celled at was farming.
Yes! Not only did 1 play computer games,
but my specialty was agriculture.
The bright spot through all of this was that
playing computer games didn't carry quite
the same stigma for a girl. It even got me a lit
tle bit of attention from guys who were into

AoE II (Age of Empires 11, God), especially
at the math tournaments.
Oh, didn't I mention that 1 was a Hoover
High Mathlete? For five years?
Yeah. And it's not like I did it because 1
was the math equivalent of Bobby Fischer or
anything. This story doesn't end with me
winning the International Math Olympiad
against the USSR. It was more because when
they asked for volunteers to be on math
team in eighth grade, I was one of the few
whose "NERD ALERT" siren didn't go off.
