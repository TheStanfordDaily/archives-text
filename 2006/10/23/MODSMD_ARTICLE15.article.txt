Everyone agrees that something is hap
pening in Iraq this month. Everyone
also agrees that no one knows what it
is.The number of U.S. troop deaths this Octo
ber is among the highest yet. Prime Minister
Maliki is meeting with the influential Shi'ite
religious and militia leaders. But experts are
beginning to question whether Iraqi militia
leaders can control their followers anymore.
Even if the Iranian star is rising, the concur
rent flush of factionalism hardly ensures that
Iran will simply inherit Iraq.The challenge of
controlling the country is daunting for all
parties. This month we are seeing things fall
apart, and in the times ahead, faction will be
the new common denominator, instability
the most dependable condition.
Now that we are beginning to see how
badly things are broken, we are getting a
sense of just how long this conflict — not the
"war on terrorism." but the war for a civil so
ciety in Iraq — will be. That is why it's inter
esting to read Iraq and Sri Lanka side-by
side. Because not only Iraq hangs in the bal
ance. The news from Sri Lanka, where the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelani killed at
least 90 and wounded 150 military personnel
with a truck bomb this week, may seem like
just another act of separatist violence from a
country that the American public probably
doesn't even know exists. But in the current
context it reads as a warning — separatist vi
olence is on the upswing all over the world.

and the insurgents (if they can be called that)
are not only in Iraq.
Now to the question I'm sure many of you
are asking: "what's a Tamil Tiger?"
South Asia in the 1970's was a rough
neighborhood. In the first part of the decade,
Bangladesh became an independent state by
separating from Pakistan in a nine-month se
cessionist struggle. As India was drawn to the
fight, the bloody civil war that brought about
Bangladesh's independence eventually en
gulfed the region. The result of this three
wind firestorm was one of the worst humani
tarian disasters of the second half of the 20th
Century, with a refugee crisis of several mil
lions, major military operations and troop
commitments and the largest P.O.W. popula
tion since the Second World War.
Nor was the chaos confined to the north.
Not far off the southeastern coast of the Indi
an subcontinent. Sri Lanka, a nation of
roughly 20 million on an island not much
larger than West Virginia, was entering a con

flict that would be almost as long and in
tractable as the standoff between India and
Pakistan.
rhere are two main groups in Sri Lanka.
Hie Sinhalese are the Buddhist majority. The
lamils are a considerable Hindu minority. In
the year 1972, only some months after the
creation ot Bangladesh, a group pressing for
Tamil political interests — including a cer
tain degree of devolution or autonomy —
was organized. Certain elements within this
group insisted on the creation of a Tamil state
on Sri Lankan land. In 1976 the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or Tamil Tigers, was
formed as a radical, paramilitary group of
Tamil lighters. By the early 1980's, there was
full-blown civil war.
Some 60.000 have died in the Sri Lankan
civil war from the 1980's and 1990'5. There
has been some good news — in 2002, a peace
accord was signed by both the Tigers and the
Sri Lankan government. Although further
peace talks are scheduled to take place on
Friday, this month's sudden escalation in vio
ence threatens to poison whatever coopera
xa C I " sti r ict m 'ght exist.The aftermath of last
Monday s attack on the Sri Lankan military
(which is composed not only of Sinhala sol
diers, but also Tamils and Muslims) has led to
successful counterattacks by government
forces, as well as follow-up suicide bombings
