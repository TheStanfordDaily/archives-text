# Globalkanization
## 
### 
Everyone agrees that something is hap
pening in Iraq this month. Everyone
also agrees that no one knows what it
is.The number of U.S. troop deaths this Octo
ber is among the highest yet. Prime Minister
Maliki is meeting with the influential Shi'ite
religious and militia leaders. But experts are
beginning to question whether Iraqi militia
leaders can control their followers anymore.
Even if the Iranian star is rising, the concur
rent flush of factionalism hardly ensures that
Iran will simply inherit Iraq.The challenge of
controlling the country is daunting for all
parties. This month we are seeing things fall
apart, and in the times ahead, faction will be
the new common denominator, instability
the most dependable condition.
Now that we are beginning to see how
badly things are broken, we are getting a
sense of just how long this conflict — not the
"war on terrorism." but the war for a civil so
ciety in Iraq — will be. That is why it's inter
esting to read Iraq and Sri Lanka side-by
side. Because not only Iraq hangs in the bal
ance. The news from Sri Lanka, where the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelani killed at
least 90 and wounded 150 military personnel
with a truck bomb this week, may seem like
just another act of separatist violence from a
country that the American public probably
doesn't even know exists. But in the current
context it reads as a warning — separatist vi
olence is on the upswing all over the world.

and the insurgents (if they can be called that)
are not only in Iraq.
Now to the question I'm sure many of you
are asking: "what's a Tamil Tiger?"
South Asia in the 1970's was a rough
neighborhood. In the first part of the decade,
Bangladesh became an independent state by
separating from Pakistan in a nine-month se
cessionist struggle. As India was drawn to the
fight, the bloody civil war that brought about
Bangladesh's independence eventually en
gulfed the region. The result of this three
wind firestorm was one of the worst humani
tarian disasters of the second half of the 20th
Century, with a refugee crisis of several mil
lions, major military operations and troop
commitments and the largest P.O.W. popula
tion since the Second World War.
Nor was the chaos confined to the north.
Not far off the southeastern coast of the Indi
an subcontinent. Sri Lanka, a nation of
roughly 20 million on an island not much
larger than West Virginia, was entering a con

flict that would be almost as long and in
tractable as the standoff between India and
Pakistan.
rhere are two main groups in Sri Lanka.
Hie Sinhalese are the Buddhist majority. The
lamils are a considerable Hindu minority. In
the year 1972, only some months after the
creation ot Bangladesh, a group pressing for
Tamil political interests — including a cer
tain degree of devolution or autonomy —
was organized. Certain elements within this
group insisted on the creation of a Tamil state
on Sri Lankan land. In 1976 the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or Tamil Tigers, was
formed as a radical, paramilitary group of
Tamil lighters. By the early 1980's, there was
full-blown civil war.
Some 60.000 have died in the Sri Lankan
civil war from the 1980's and 1990'5. There
has been some good news — in 2002, a peace
accord was signed by both the Tigers and the
Sri Lankan government. Although further
peace talks are scheduled to take place on
Friday, this month's sudden escalation in vio
ence threatens to poison whatever coopera
xa C I " sti r ict m 'ght exist.The aftermath of last
Monday s attack on the Sri Lankan military
(which is composed not only of Sinhala sol
diers, but also Tamils and Muslims) has led to
successful counterattacks by government
forces, as well as follow-up suicide bombings

from the Tamil Tigers. In all, 2006 has
been a bad year for the fragile cease
lire in Sri Lanka, where more than
2,(KM) people have been killed in the
lighting since April.
In spite of the heavy human cost,
the Tigers are not simply a terrorist
group. They are also something of a
wannabe regular military. It's true
that the Tamil Tigers have commit
ted many acts of political violence
that amount to terrorism. They as
sassinated Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 by suicide
bomb. I hey have intimidated and

terrorized civilian targets more
often than military ones, as in 1990,
when they expelled the entire Mus
lim population of tne city of Jaffna.
Yet they also concentrate a signifi
cant number of their offensives
against the Sri Lankan military.They
attack conventional and hard tar
gets. and they even have a primitive
navy. Simply calling them terrorists
will serve little purpose. To under
stand them, one must see them as
they see themselves: as an embryon
ic state, however restive, however vi
olent.
Increasingly, we are seeing groups
like the Tamil Tigers pop up around
the globe. As political contracts run
out, what the Russian Empire called
"the small people" are trying to buy
free agency with violence. Rioting in

Shenzhen reminds us that China is a
hotbed of class conflict.The forces of
separatism, from Sri Lanka to Pak
istan. the forces of ethnic and possi
bly religious malaise in France and
beyond, are collectively calling for
the greatest redistricting of the
world since the Treaty of Versailles in
1919. Russia remains weighted by
revolutionaries in the Caucasus.
Now this problem is spreading to the
region of Tatarstan in the center of
the country, where separatists are
now targeting the oil industry's infra
structure. Montenegro, meanwhile,
just voted to separate from Serbia.
As these kinds of conflicts become
more common, and as the groups
that fight them become more and
more sophisticated, the likelihood of
a minority receiving its autonomy

grows. Are we entering a new age of
insularity?
When Europe created the Balkan
states from the collapsing Turkish
Empire. German diplomats passion
ately opposed what they called "kle
instaaterei," the building of small
states based on ethno-religious com
monalities. So with the world's latest
surge in sectarian violence, with the
stalling of the European Union and
the social particularization repre
sented by the Internet age, someone
must ask: will the next stage of glob
alization be globalkanization?
