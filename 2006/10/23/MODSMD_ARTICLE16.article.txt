Difficult? Yes. Surprising? No. ;it least not
anymore.
While the old adage may say that there are
infinite ways to lose a football game, Stanford
lost its lOth-straight contest much like it has the
last nine. ITie oltense stalled on the ground and
sputtered through the air. the rush and pass de
tenses never made ii oil the plane.and turnovers
and sacks ensured the Cardinal lost in a
blowout.

Stanford 3

Iliis week, Arizona State had the honors,de
molishing Stanford 38-3 to snap a three-game
losingstreak in front of a I lomecoming crowd of
53,000.
"It's like a broken record; we were not phys
ical enough and not consistent enough to run the
hall for four quarters." Stanford coach Walt 1 lar
ris said. "I think we played good at times on de
fense, but we wouldn't get oft the field or we
would do something that would give them an
other shot."
A 27-yard Rudy Carpenter touchdown
strike to Ryan Torain and a 19-yard Jesse
Ainsworth field goal built a 10-0 Sun Devil lead
late in the first quarter. But it was I'orain's two
yard dash midway through the second quarter
that gave the Devils a 17-0 lead that effectively
iced the game. Tailback keegan I lerring found
the end zone twice in the third quarter to push
Arizona State's lead to 31-0. and halfback
Dmitri Nance capped the afternoon's scoring
from 13 yards out in the fourth.
Junior kicker Aaron Zagory's 35-yard field
goal late in the third quarter provided Stanford's
only points.
With the loss, the Cardinal (0-8,0-5 Pac-10) is
just four games away from their first winless sea
son since 1%0. Their 10-game skid, dating back

to last season, is the third-worst of Division 1-A's
I l l ) football programs.
"It was a tough day at the office," I larris said.
Junior quarterback T.C. Ostrander struggled
in his first start, where he replaced senior Trent
I dwards. who will miss the remainder of the sea
son with a broken foot. Misfires, constant pres
sure and drops from his young receivers forced
Ostrander into just a 48-yard afternoon on 7-of
-28 passing.
Meanwhile, Arizona State gained 206 rush
ing yards on a healthy 4.4 yards per carry aver
age. Sophomore quarterback Rudy Carpenter
looked more like a Heisman winner than the
scapegoat lie had become in recent weeks, com
pleting 17 of 19 attempts for 175 yards and two
touchdowns.
I Unsurprisingly, the Devils crushed the Cardi
nal in all statistical measures. ASU gained 236
more yards and 12 more first downs than Stan
ford, outpossessed Stanford by over six minutes
in the first half alone, converted 6-of-ll third
downs to Stanford's 3-of-14,scored on five of six
red zone trips and forced two turnovers and
three sacks.
Stanford's 145 offensive yards was the ninth
lowest total in 80-plus years of Cardinal football
history, while the 66 passing yards were the
third-worst in the record books.
"We held the Stanford offense to 145 yards
and about 50 of those yards came on one play,
when we missed a tackle," said Arizona State
head coach Dirk Koetter, referring to a 58-yard
third-quarter rush from junior tailback Anthony
Kimble. "This is the first game in awhile we've
been able to get pressure without blitzing. We
got pressure in a four-man rush, which allows us
to keep more guys in coverage."
I larris also pointed to the five-man offensive
line's inability to block four defenders as key in
the loss.
"Their offensive line was physical and their
defensive line was too much for our guys," he
said.
After a much-needed bye week, the Cardinal
will conclude their season by hosting Southern

ford, outpossessed Stanford by over six minutes
in the first half alone, converted 6-of-ll third
downs to Stanford's 3-of-14,scored on five of six
red zone trips and forced two turnovers and
three sacks.
Stanford's 145 offensive yards was the ninth
lowest total in 80-plus years of Cardinal football
history, while the 66 passing yards were the
third-worst in the record books.
"We held the Stanford offense to 145 yards
and about 50 of those yards came on one play,
when we missed a tackle," said Arizona State
head coach Dirk Koetter, referring to a 58-yard
third-quarter rush from junior tailback Anthony
Kimble. "This is the first game in awhile we've
been able to get pressure without blitzing. We
got pressure in a four-man rush, which allows us
to keep more guys in coverage."
I larris also pointed to the five-man offensive
line's inability to block four defenders as key in
the loss.
"Their offensive line was physical and their
defensive line was too much for our guys," he
said.
