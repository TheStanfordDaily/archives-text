## Inside Zone 
### 
Stanford's only scoring drive of
the game started with a run by
Anthony Kimble on 1 st-and-10 from
the Stanford 20-yard line. In a play
designed to go to the right, Kimble
(26) took the handoff and started
downfield. The Sun Devil corner
back, Keno Walter-White (8) blitzed
into the backfield, but took a poor
angle and allowed Kimble to cut
back to the left. Blocks from Erik
Lorig (80) and Allen Smith (67)
sealed the inside of the defense,
while Austin Yancy (38) obstructed
the free safety, Josh Barrett (19). The
result was a huge lane down the left
sideline. Kimble sped down the line
until he was taken out of bounds at
the Arizona State 22-yard line. The
58-yard run was Stanford's longest
offensive gain of the season.
