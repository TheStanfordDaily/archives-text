# Sifting through the "coachspeak"
## 
### 
While football coaches (and
by extension, their players)
are notorious for "coach
speak"— attempting to convey as
little information as possible in as
many words as possible — it doesn't
exactly take a psychologist to parse
the meaning out of the quotes out of
'lcmpe this past weekend. For while
Arizona State tried to be gracious in
victory and Stanford upbeat in de
feat, it was apparent the Cardinal did
not belong on the same field as the
Sun Devils.
Quote: "1 thought we dominated in
all aspects of the game, on offense
and on defense. I'd still like to see the
penalties cut down a lot. It might af
fect us in later games. We thought we
could win convincingly and we did
so." — Arizona State quarterback
Rudy Carpenter.
Translation: "We whooped their
butts up and down the field. The
penalties are a bummer — it could
cost us against a team with a pulse.
We thought they stunk, and sure
enough, they did."
Quotes: "We knew we were going to
be able to take advantage of the four
man rush this week." - Arizona State
defensive lineman Kyle Caldwell.

"This is the first game in awhile we've
been able to get pressure without
blitzing. We did get pressure in a (bur
man rush which allows us to keep
more guys in coverage and the pass
rush certainly helps the pressure." —
Arizona State head coach Dirk Koet
ter.
"The defensive line was too much for
our guys." — Stanford head coach
Walt Harris.
Translation: Stanford's five-man of
fensive line (more if one counts block
ing running backs and tight ends) has
not been able to block four rushers all
season, and, accordingly, is one of the
worst units in the nation.
Quotes: "I think throughout the
game they figured out that all of our
corners are decent and they had to
try to find something else that would
work for them." — Former wide re
ceiver/current cornerback Rudy
Burgess.
Translation: "The ASU secondary is
one of the worst in the league — just
look at our defensive statistics or the
fact the coaches had to move me. one
of the fastest guys on the team, to cor
nerback. But wow, are their receivers
slow."
Quotes: "We played a ton of guys
today. We got a lot of people in and its
great to see them working hard at
practice and showing up on Satur
days." — Koetter.
"I think we showed our depth at tail
back. even though Shaun DeWitty

continues to be out. We scored with
three different tailbacks." — Koetter.
"We used a nice rotation to keep me
healthy and fresh on the field; it was
fun." — Burgess.
Translation: Arizona State was confi
dent enough that its third-stringers
could beat Stanford that they rotated
throughout their three-deep Saturday.
It was fun.
And, my personal favorite: "We got
beat by a good football team. How
good? They're in the process of prov
ing how good they are." — I larris
Translation: "They're not very good
right now. We're even worse."
As the above quotes and Pac-10
season to-date should more than
prove, Stanford simply is not physi
cally comparable to most of the op
ponents on its schedule. Poor recruit
ing evaluations, three years of Buddy
Teevens, Stanford's academic re
quirements and poor talent develop
ment have all taken their toll. It is a
five-year-plus hole Stanford has dug
itself into, and to expect that a new
coach, incoming star recruit, playcall
ing or stadium will suddenly erase
years of mismanagement of the foot
ball program is delusional.
On that note, fans need to under
stand the scope of Stanford football's
problems and stop making Walt I lar
ris the scapegoat. Yes, he is not espe
cially engaging in public, or. from
what I understand, behind closed
doors. Yes, I know some players are

giving less than 1 (K) percent. Yes. the
playcalling is had and cost wins last
year and points this year. Yes. a dif
ferent coach could have led Stanford
to a bowl last year and gained more
than 250 yards over the last two
games.
So with this hypothetical new
coach (without considering why in the
world said coach would want to come
here) let's assume a win at San Jose
State and I'll he generous and add in
another victory. Would the fans be
happy with 2-6? Of course not. and if
Knute Rockne couldn't do better,
then maybe it's not all the coach's
fault.
What Stanford needs right now is
fans with the patience to suffer
through several disappointing years
in a rebuilding effort for a brighter fu
ture. Just like you. I can name about
50 coaches who I think would be bet
ter here (starting with Michigan de
fensive coordinator Ron English),
but it doesn't matter. To can Harris
two years into his tenure would just
set Stanford football back that far.
and doom the program to several
more, potentially fatal years of em
barrassment.
It's painful, but if you're a fan, you
need stay the course and support the
two men in the football program with
the longest track record of winning —
Walt Harris and Bob Bowlsbv.

to a bowl last year and gained more
than 250 yards over the last two
games.
So with this hypothetical new
coach (without considering why in the
world said coach would want to come
here) let's assume a win at San Jose
State and I'll he generous and add in
another victory. Would the fans be
happy with 2-6? Of course not. and if
Knute Rockne couldn't do better,
then maybe it's not all the coach's
fault.
What Stanford needs right now is
fans with the patience to suffer
through several disappointing years
in a rebuilding effort for a brighter fu
ture. Just like you. I can name about
50 coaches who I think would be bet
ter here (starting with Michigan de
fensive coordinator Ron English),
but it doesn't matter. To can Harris
two years into his tenure would just
set Stanford football back that far.
and doom the program to several
more, potentially fatal years of em
barrassment.
It's painful, but if you're a fan, you
need stay the course and support the
two men in the football program with
the longest track record of winning —
Walt Harris and Bob Bowlsbv.

While football coaches (and
by extension, their players)
are notorious for "coach
speak"— attempting to convey as
little information as possible in as
many words as possible — it doesn't
exactly take a psychologist to parse
the meaning out of the quotes out of
'lcmpe this past weekend. For while
Arizona State tried to be gracious in
victory and Stanford upbeat in de
feat, it was apparent the Cardinal did
not belong on the same field as the
Sun Devils.
Quote: "1 thought we dominated in
all aspects of the game, on offense
and on defense. I'd still like to see the
penalties cut down a lot. It might af
fect us in later games. We thought we
could win convincingly and we did
so." — Arizona State quarterback
Rudy Carpenter.
Translation: "We whooped their
butts up and down the field. The
penalties are a bummer — it could
cost us against a team with a pulse.
We thought they stunk, and sure
enough, they did."
Quotes: "We knew we were going to
be able to take advantage of the four
man rush this week." - Arizona State
defensive lineman Kyle Caldwell.

> Analysis
"This is the first game in awhile we've
been able to get pressure without
blitzing. We did get pressure in a (bur
man rush which allows us to keep
more guys in coverage and the pass
rush certainly helps the pressure." —
Arizona State head coach Dirk Koet
ter.
"The defensive line was too much for
our guys." — Stanford head coach
Walt Harris.
Translation: Stanford's five-man of
fensive line (more if one counts block
ing running backs and tight ends) has
not been able to block four rushers all
season, and, accordingly, is one of the
worst units in the nation.
Quotes: "I think throughout the
game they figured out that all of our
corners are decent and they had to
try to find something else that would
work for them." — Former wide re
ceiver/current cornerback Rudy
Burgess.
Translation: "The ASU secondary is
one of the worst in the league — just
look at our defensive statistics or the
fact the coaches had to move me. one
of the fastest guys on the team, to cor
nerback. But wow, are their receivers
slow."
Quotes: "We played a ton of guys
today. We got a lot of people in and its
great to see them working hard at
practice and showing up on Satur
days." — Koetter.
"I think we showed our depth at tail
back. even though Shaun DeWitty

continues to be out. We scored with
three different tailbacks." — Koetter.
"We used a nice rotation to keep me
healthy and fresh on the field; it was
fun." — Burgess.
Translation: Arizona State was confi
dent enough that its third-stringers
could beat Stanford that they rotated
throughout their three-deep Saturday.
It was fun.
And, my personal favorite: "We got
beat by a good football team. How
good? They're in the process of prov
ing how good they are." — I larris
Translation: "They're not very good
right now. We're even worse."
As the above quotes and Pac-10
season to-date should more than
prove, Stanford simply is not physi
cally comparable to most of the op
ponents on its schedule. Poor recruit
ing evaluations, three years of Buddy
Teevens, Stanford's academic re
quirements and poor talent develop
ment have all taken their toll. It is a
five-year-plus hole Stanford has dug
itself into, and to expect that a new
coach, incoming star recruit, playcall
ing or stadium will suddenly erase
years of mismanagement of the foot
ball program is delusional.
On that note, fans need to under
stand the scope of Stanford football's
problems and stop making Walt I lar
ris the scapegoat. Yes, he is not espe
cially engaging in public, or. from
what I understand, behind closed
doors. Yes, I know some players are

giving less than 1 (K) percent. Yes. the
playcalling is had and cost wins last
year and points this year. Yes. a dif
ferent coach could have led Stanford
to a bowl last year and gained more
than 250 yards over the last two
games.
So with this hypothetical new
coach (without considering why in the
world said coach would want to come
here) let's assume a win at San Jose
State and I'll he generous and add in
another victory. Would the fans be
happy with 2-6? Of course not. and if
