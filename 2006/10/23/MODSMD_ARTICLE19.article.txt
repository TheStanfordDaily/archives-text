# Sifting through the "coachspeak"
## 
### 
While football coaches (and
by extension, their players)
are notorious for "coach
speak"— attempting to convey as
little information as possible in as
many words as possible — it doesn't
exactly take a psychologist to parse
the meaning out of the quotes out of
'lcmpe this past weekend. For while
Arizona State tried to be gracious in
victory and Stanford upbeat in de
feat, it was apparent the Cardinal did
not belong on the same field as the
Sun Devils.
Quote: "1 thought we dominated in
all aspects of the game, on offense
and on defense. I'd still like to see the
penalties cut down a lot. It might af
fect us in later games. We thought we
could win convincingly and we did
so." — Arizona State quarterback
Rudy Carpenter.
Translation: "We whooped their
butts up and down the field. The
penalties are a bummer — it could
cost us against a team with a pulse.
We thought they stunk, and sure
enough, they did."
Quotes: "We knew we were going to
be able to take advantage of the four
man rush this week." - Arizona State
defensive lineman Kyle Caldwell.
