# Speaker lends a face to AIDS forum
## Kim decries lack of political will for health care 
### KELLEY FONG AND CHRISTIAN TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
Internationally-renowned AIDS ac
tivist Dr. Jim Kim rejected the claim that
the world lacks the financial resources
to treat AIDS-afflicted Africans, argu
ing instead on Friday that it is a matter
of public awareness and political will.
Raising funds for AIDS treatment
has not been easy. Kim told a packed
Kresge Auditorium in a lecture entitled
"Facing AIDS: Why We Can't Wait."
With his peers in the medical field years
ago telling him "what can't be done," he
said it was as if "35 million people in
Africa were being told to die."
But Kim refused to listen to those
critics. While at the World I lealth Orga
nization. he created the "3 by 5" initia
tive, with the unheard-of goal of treating
three million HIV-infected people in
developing nations by the year 2005.
Against enormous odds. Kim said that
he would continue to fight for funding,
describing the problem as a lack of a
public outcry.
"We spend $2 billion per week in
Iraq." he said. "No one ever convinced
me that there is not enough money to
provide health care for everyone in the
planet. It'sjust a matter of political will."
The address began with junior
Jonny Dorsey, co-founder and execu
tive director of FACE AIDS, introduc
ing Kim as one of his personal heroes.
Dorsey's organization, which co-spon
sored Friday's talk, now has over a

hundred college chapters devoted to
generating awareness about AIDS in
Africa. FACE AIDS also kicked off a
$1 million fundraising effort last
month — money that will go to Part
ners in Health (PIH), an assistance
group that works on the ground in
Africa, which Kim co-founded in 1987.
Many students were already famil
iar with Kim and PIH, both featured in
Tracy Kidder's bestseller "Mountains
Beyond Mountains" — required read
ing for incoming freshmen this sum
mer.
"It was really powerful to get physi
cal proof that the book is nowhere near
fiction," said sophomore Ellen Truxaw.
Kim pointed to Lesotho as a sobering
picture of the disease's impact. Life ex
pectancy has decreased by 20 years, he
said, and at times there has been an av
erage gap of just 25 days between an
AIDS diagnosis and death.
"We have not seen life expectancy
drops like this since the Black Plague,"
Kim said.
But while the death and misery
AIDS wreaks is tough to take in. he said
he still finds reasons to be optimistic.
"Today, 1.7 million people are on
treatment," Kim said. "Most would say
this never would have been possible."
Kim is currently the chief of the So
cial Medicine Department at Harvard
Medical School, and he said he will con
tinue to use that position to promote in
novation. support scholarship, train and

leaders and cultivate communities of
practice by utilizing the Internet.
Kim's speech kicked off a week
end long FACE AIDS forum de
signed to bring college activists from
around the country together to brain
storm ways to raise awareness and
encourage students to create FACE
AIDS chapters at other campuses.
Saturday morning's program in
cluded two panels. llie first, entitled
"America's Response to AIDS in the

20th Century" featured a discussion
about America's reaction to the glob
al AIDS epidemic,as well as the spe
cific responses from American corpo
rations and religious institutions.
While there were considerably fewer
students in attendance at the discus
sions, as compared to Kim's address,
students said they enjoyed the panel.
The second panel, "The Emer
gence of Treatment Programs in Re
source-Poor Settings," focused on the
recent shift towards treatment, espe
cially as a result of PlH's successful
work in Haiti.
Saturday's programming also in
cluded workshops on issues involving
AIDS' relationship with women,
youth, the media and 11IV care.

On Saturday, Dr. Henry Epino, a
IW4 Stanford graduate and medical
director for the PI H clinic in Rwanda,
delivered a second keynote address
describing his experiences in the
strife-ridden African nation — a
speech FACE AIDS Director of
Events Caity Koch a. a senior, called
"one of the most poignant of the con
ference."
The forum concluded with leader
ship training modules for national
FACE AIDS organizers.
"We're trying to set up this struc
ture of teaching others how to put
their FACE AIDS chapters together
on their respective college campus
es." Rocha said." It's only going to get
bigger from here."
