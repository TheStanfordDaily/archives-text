# Speaker lends a face to AIDS forum
## Kim decries lack of political will for health care 
### KELLEY FONG AND CHRISTIAN TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
Internationally-renowned AIDS ac
tivist Dr. Jim Kim rejected the claim that
the world lacks the financial resources
to treat AIDS-afflicted Africans, argu
ing instead on Friday that it is a matter
of public awareness and political will.
Raising funds for AIDS treatment
has not been easy. Kim told a packed
Kresge Auditorium in a lecture entitled
"Facing AIDS: Why We Can't Wait."
With his peers in the medical field years
ago telling him "what can't be done," he
said it was as if "35 million people in
Africa were being told to die."
But Kim refused to listen to those
critics. While at the World I lealth Orga
nization. he created the "3 by 5" initia
tive, with the unheard-of goal of treating
three million HIV-infected people in
developing nations by the year 2005.
Against enormous odds. Kim said that
he would continue to fight for funding,
describing the problem as a lack of a
public outcry.
"We spend $2 billion per week in
Iraq." he said. "No one ever convinced
me that there is not enough money to
provide health care for everyone in the
planet. It'sjust a matter of political will."
The address began with junior
Jonny Dorsey, co-founder and execu
tive director of FACE AIDS, introduc
ing Kim as one of his personal heroes.
Dorsey's organization, which co-spon
sored Friday's talk, now has over a

hundred college chapters devoted to
generating awareness about AIDS in
Africa. FACE AIDS also kicked off a
$1 million fundraising effort last
month — money that will go to Part
ners in Health (PIH), an assistance
group that works on the ground in
Africa, which Kim co-founded in 1987.
Many students were already famil
iar with Kim and PIH, both featured in
Tracy Kidder's bestseller "Mountains
Beyond Mountains" — required read

"It was really powerful to get physi
cal proof that the book is nowhere near
fiction," said sophomore Ellen Truxaw.
Kim pointed to Lesotho as a sobering
picture of the disease's impact. Life ex
pectancy has decreased by 20 years, he
said, and at times there has been an av
erage gap of just 25 days between an
AIDS diagnosis and death.
"We have not seen life expectancy
drops like this since the Black Plague,"
Kim said.
But while the death and misery
AIDS wreaks is tough to take in. he said
he still finds reasons to be optimistic.
"Today, 1.7 million people are on
treatment," Kim said. "Most would say
this never would have been possible."
Kim is currently the chief of the So
cial Medicine Department at Harvard
Medical School, and he said he will con
