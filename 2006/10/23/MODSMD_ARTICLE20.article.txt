### BY REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
After pulling off an upset across the Bay the night be
fore, the Oregon women's volleyball team came to Stan
lord with high hopes on Friday night. I lowever. the No. 3
Cardinal dashed those hopes and cruised to an easy
three-game victory, 30-20. 30-18, 30-18. in less than an
hour and a half of play. The Ducks had beaten No. 8 Cal
ifornia in four games the previous night, but had no such
luck against Stanford.
"Oregon has really proven itself in the first half of the
season, and now it is in the top half of the conference."
