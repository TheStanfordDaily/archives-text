After pulling off an upset across the Bay the night be
fore, the Oregon women's volleyball team came to Stan
lord with high hopes on Friday night. I lowever. the No. 3
Cardinal dashed those hopes and cruised to an easy
three-game victory, 30-20. 30-18, 30-18. in less than an
hour and a half of play. The Ducks had beaten No. 8 Cal
ifornia in four games the previous night, but had no such
luck against Stanford.
"Oregon has really proven itself in the first half of the
season, and now it is in the top half of the conference."
Stanford head coach John Dunning said. "1 thought that
we really prepared for them well. When they beat ( al. it
made us understand how well they are doing because get
ting wins like that against good teams is so tough."
Although the defense held the Cardinal (17-2,8-1 Pac
-10 Conference) toone of their lowest hitting percentages
of the season. Oregon (15-4,5-4) could not build any mo
mentum on the attack, hitting a negative percentage in
every game and managing to take a lead only once, dur
ing a short stretch early in the third game.
Though the Cardinal s overall offensive output was
less potent than usual, sophomore Foluke Akinradewo

kills on .476 hitting and nine blocks.
"Defensively, we played extremely well," Dunning
said. "We blocked well and played some good defense
and seemed to exert pressure on them. And they started
making errors more than we expected. They are a big
team and run a [two-setter system], so they always have
big blockers up there against us. It made it harder for us
offensively, but the defense and blocking got it done for
us."
I arly in the first game, it was sophomore outside hit
ter Ii in Waller who put the Cardinal in a commanding
lead. Waller's blocking against the Oregon right-side at
tack was smothering and she stuffed three balls in the
game. A kill by Akinradewo, two by sophomore outside
hitter Cynthia Barboza and a Waller block gave the Car
dinal a 13-5 advantage.The lead then ballooned into dou
ble digits at 26-15 after back-to-back kills by junior mid
dle blocker Franci Ciirard and senior outside hitter
Kristin Richards. Waller notched a kill to finish off the
game.
"lirin Waller really got it started for us," Dunning said.
"She made the right side feel some pressure and they
struggled for the rest of the night on
that side. They kept attacking there,
hut we played well against them."
After a block by Wallei and after
Akinradewo scored the first point of
the second frame, the Ducks kept
pace with the Cardinal for a while,
tying it 3-3. But the Cardinal defense
stepped up with nine digs and two
blocks and left the Ducks behind at
the media timeout. 15-8. Senior right
side Nji Nnamani saw an overpass
find the floor to make it 20-9. ITie
lead would hold as junior setter Bryn
Kehoe ended a rally with a powerful
tip to close out the game.
Akinradewo's four blocks paced
the Cardinal in the second game.
Barboza notched four kills and soph
omore libero Jessica Fishburn
notched eight digs.
The Ducks started the third game
with their best volleyball of the
match, taking a 9-6 lead over a Cardi
nal squad that suddenly began mak
ing mistakes. But the Cardinal right
ed the ship and regained the lead at
10-9 off an Oregon error. Stanford
scored seven straight points with
Richards servjng, until the Ducks fi
nally answered with a pair of their
own to close the deficit to five. The
Cardinal put together another long
run and a Waller kill put her team up
by 10 at 25-15. Nnamani's second ace
of the night ended the game.
The sophomore class had a fan
tastic night with Akinradewo. Bar
boza, Waller and Fishburn powering
the squad to victory. Barboza was
second in kills behind Akinradewo
with nine, while Waller chipped in
five. Akinradewo blocked a match
high nine balls,often combining with
Barboza and Waller, who finished
with six and four respectively. In the
three games, Stanford tallied a sea
son-high 15 blocks.
The Cardinal outdug the Ducks
42-37 with Fishburn notching a team
high 12. Oregon's libero Katie Swo
boda played scrappy defense and fin
ished with a match-high 17 digs.
With the first half of the Pac-10
season finished, the Cardinal are
currently tied for first place with No.
4 UCLA. Each squad has an 8-1 con
ference record.
"It is a very strong conference
and everyone has wins outside of the
conference, high winning percent

ages in the preseason and against
other teams," Dunning said. "Ore
gon State struggled some hut they
had two injuries right before playing
us. Other than that, everybody has
been tough and we feel good to have

done as well as we have."

Head coach John Dunning credited sophomore outside hitter Erin Waller for
getting things rolling for the Card on Friday. Waller's kill sealed the first-game
victory and Stanford completed an easy sweep over Oregon.
After pulling off an upset across the Bay the night be
fore, the Oregon women's volleyball team came to Stan
lord with high hopes on Friday night. I lowever. the No. 3
Cardinal dashed those hopes and cruised to an easy
three-game victory, 30-20. 30-18, 30-18. in less than an
hour and a half of play. The Ducks had beaten No. 8 Cal
ifornia in four games the previous night, but had no such
luck against Stanford.
"Oregon has really proven itself in the first half of the
season, and now it is in the top half of the conference."
Stanford head coach John Dunning said. "1 thought that
we really prepared for them well. When they beat ( al. it
made us understand how well they are doing because get
ting wins like that against good teams is so tough."
Although the defense held the Cardinal (17-2,8-1 Pac
-10 Conference) toone of their lowest hitting percentages
of the season. Oregon (15-4,5-4) could not build any mo
mentum on the attack, hitting a negative percentage in
every game and managing to take a lead only once, dur
ing a short stretch early in the third game.
Though the Cardinal s overall offensive output was
less potent than usual, sophomore Foluke Akinradewo
had an outstanding night. She posted match highs of 10

kills on .476 hitting and nine blocks.
"Defensively, we played extremely well," Dunning
said. "We blocked well and played some good defense
and seemed to exert pressure on them. And they started
making errors more than we expected. They are a big
team and run a [two-setter system], so they always have
big blockers up there against us. It made it harder for us
offensively, but the defense and blocking got it done for
us."
I arly in the first game, it was sophomore outside hit
ter Ii in Waller who put the Cardinal in a commanding
lead. Waller's blocking against the Oregon right-side at
tack was smothering and she stuffed three balls in the
game. A kill by Akinradewo, two by sophomore outside
hitter Cynthia Barboza and a Waller block gave the Car
dinal a 13-5 advantage.The lead then ballooned into dou
ble digits at 26-15 after back-to-back kills by junior mid
