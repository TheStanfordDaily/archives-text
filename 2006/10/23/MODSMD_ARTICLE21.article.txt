# MEN'S SWIMMING
## Card place second in Stockton 
### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's swim
ming team had a jam-packed after
noon last Saturday when they trav
eled to Stockton. Calif, for the second
and final day of theTYR Pacific Invi
tational. Within a three-hour session,
each man competed in four or five in
dividual and relay race against Pac-10
opponents Southern California and
Washington.
The Cardinal placed first in six of
Saturday's 10 events. The big winner
of the day was senior Hongzhe Sun.
Sun took first-place honors in the 100-
and 200-yard backstrokes and was a
member of the winning 800 freestyle
relay along with junior Phillip Morri
son and seniors Shaun Phillips and
Andy Grant.
The other Cardinal event winners
included sophomore Jason Dunford,
who claimed both the 100 free and
100 fly, and his classmate Paul Korn
feld who captured the 200 breast
stroke.
Even though the Cardinal men
only swam half of the two-day meet,
they still scored 619.5 points â€”
enough for second place. Only No. 7
USC, who swam both days, scored

higher with 970 points. Nonetheless,
according to Phillips, team scores are
not what the team is focusing on at
this point in the season.
"The reason we went to this meet
was to practice racing and to get feed
back from our coaches and team
mates about what we could do bet
ter," Phillips said. "Our coaches told
us that racing hard was more impor
tant than the score or how fast we
swam."
Since the men are currently facing

the toughest training of the year,
Phillips claims that the meet went well
even if the times weren't spectacular.
"Nobody swam really fast times,
and some guys were a bit disappoint
ed because they didn't swim quite as
fast as they hoped," he said. "Because
this is the hardest part of our season,
we're all pretty broken down. But I
think that despite that we did a great
job of racing across the board."

The Stanford men's swim team was satisfied with its results this oast weekend.
The team finished with a solid score, though senior Shaun Phillips admitted no
one swam very fast times. Still, the focus was on practice rather than scores.
