## Few profs share syllabi Students find online program insufficient 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
A pilot version of Stanford Syllabus,
an online repository for class syllabi, hit
the Web last week, but students are al

sors have posted course information, lim

Geophysics Prof. Rosemary Knight
was one of the lead organizers of the site.

which she was inspired to create two

"I read an article in The Daily suggest
ing that much of the confusion of the
shopping period could be avoided if the
syllabi for courses were available in ad

Knight worked last spring with Lois
Brooks, the director of Academic Com
puting, and junior Kat Kershner, then
chair of the Undergraduate Senate's stu

299 syllabi are already posted for fall
quarter classes, and she encouraged un
dergraduates to press faculty to add their

syllabi.

pressed by the number of syllabi. Sopho-
