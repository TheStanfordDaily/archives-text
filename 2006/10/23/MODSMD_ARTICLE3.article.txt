## Few profs share syllabi Students find online program insufficient 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
A pilot version of Stanford Syllabus,
an online repository for class syllabi, hit
the Web last week, but students are al
ready complaining that too few profes
sors have posted course information, lim
iting the usefulness of the site.
Geophysics Prof. Rosemary Knight
was one of the lead organizers of the site.

which she was inspired to create two
years ago.
"I read an article in The Daily suggest
ing that much of the confusion of the
shopping period could be avoided if the
syllabi for courses were available in ad
vance," she said.
Knight worked last spring with Lois
Brooks, the director of Academic Com
puting, and junior Kat Kershner, then
chair of the Undergraduate Senate's stu
dent life, housing and education commit
tee, to put the site online. Brooks said that
299 syllabi are already posted for fall
quarter classes, and she encouraged un
dergraduates to press faculty to add their

syllabi.

j
While many

syllabi are available
through Coursework. students

must be registered through Axess to see
them, making it impossible for students
to look at the syllabi for the various class
es that they may be shopping.
Hut many students were either un
aware of the site's existence, or unim
pressed by the number of syllabi. Sopho-

more Savil Srivastava was bewil
dered when informed of the Stan
ford Syllabus.
"What is it?" he asked, a common
reaction among interviewed stu
dents.
Sophomore Nicki Lui stated that
she had only visited the Web site be
cause of an email from the sopho
more class presidents. Initially, she
felt the site was "not necessary." but
now says that it could be helpful
down the road.
"We're already amidst the first
round of midterms." she said. "It's
just bad timing."
However, many students ex
pressed doubts about the site's po
tential. citing that many "core"
courses like Economics 50. Chem
istry 3IX. CS K)bA. Biology 41. Psy

chology 1 and the primary Engineer
ing classes do not have syllabi avail
able.
Students are often not familiar
with academic Web sites that fail to
deliver. Stanford Courseguide, an
ASSU site designed to pool course
evaluations and information, never
succeeded in achieving a critical
mass of up-to-date content, and the
site is no longer online.
But despite being discontent with
the site, students said they were in
trigued by the idea behind
syllabus.stanford.edu.
Freshman Paris Georgoudis said
he had used the site to scroll through
the Econl A syllabus.
"You know the books you have to
buy; you know when the exams are
going to be," he said. "You practical
ly do not have to go shopping the
first week of class by having the syl
labus online."
Sophomore Pouya Fatemi is peti
tioning to use his credits from Com
putational Mathematics for Engi

neers (CME) to get an exemption
from Math 51 — but the class of 433
students has no syllabus posted on
line yet. Still. Fatemi said that the site
could have been useful.
"1 could just go to this Web site,
get the syllabus for Math 51 and
compare the material with the stult
my CME classes covered last year
without having to attend the actual
lecture," he said.
Students were quick to offer ad
vice on how to improve Stanford Syl
labus in order to ensure that the site
does not share the fate of Stanford
Courseguide. Many complained that
too much information about classes
is spread out between Axess,
Coursework. the Bookstore Web site
and now Stanford Syllabus. They ar
gued that much of this should be in
corporated into Axess. That's not to
say, however, that students are en
amored with the Axess interface —
many said they preferred Stanford
Syllabus' user-friendly layout.
