## Six Degrees holds concert to promote human rights awareness 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Six Degrees sponsored a six-hour concert ex
travaganza in White Plaza Saturday in an effort
to raise human rights awareness, with campus
groups manning informational tables as bands
Jazz Mafia, K23 Orchestra and Albino played
under the Birdcage for a crowd of students,
tourists and local residents.
Dozens of passing students stopped to talk
with the various groups during the course of the
afternoon, and several students lounged on the
grass, chatting or reading as the bands per
formed. lending the concert a low-key air.
"I thought it was a really friendly,chill atmos
phere," said senior Brian Pfeiffer. "The good
weather definitely helped."
Six Degrees president Bradley Heinz, a jun
ior, said the concert served a dual purpose.
"It was both a celebration of activism and an
event to encourage collaboration between dif
ferent student groups. NGOs and the general
public," he said."We wanted to create a large au
dience so that groups could hand out petitions
and talk to people. Basically it was about bring

ing together a lot of people and groups working
similar causes."
According to I leinz, Six Degrees originally
focused itself to solely publishing a quarterly
journal that provided students a venue to de
scribe their experiences with activism and cover
issues ignored by the mainstream press. Recent
ly, the student group introduced an advocacy
branch, which was designed to encourage stu
dent discourse about human rights by attracting
speakers to campus and organizing events like
the recent concert.
Matt "Sniitty" Smith, a member of the band
Albino, expressed enthusiasm about the meld
ing of music and activism.
"We tend to be very active in progressive
causes across the board." Smith said. "Just this
week we played for the Rainforest Action Net
work. We try to support a good cause when we
can. I think it's almost a necessary thing to do."
"A lot of our songs have an activist compo
nent to them," he continued. "We try to keep
them rooted in the issues of the day. Its a lighter
way to get people's ears open. Since they're often
so mired in the day to day, it's a lot better than
standing in a street corner with a bunch of fliers."
