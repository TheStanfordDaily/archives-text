# Torture Panels Shock Audiences
## 
### LIA HARDIN 
Journalists, lawyers and psychologists spent
Friday detailing alleged abuses of power in Iraqi
prisons and discussing recent legislation decrimi
nalizing abuses as part of the conference "Think
ing Humanity after Abu Ghraib."
Psychology prof. Philip Zimbardo, New Yorker
reporter Mark Danner, visiting Law Prof. David
Luban, Law Prof. Jenny Martinez, psychotherapist
Gerald Grey and UC Berkeley Rhetoric Profes
sor Judith Butler gave the audience a crash course
in human rights, the Bush Administration's efforts
to escape legal and political criticism and the Sen
ate's recent legalization of torture.
Zimbardo, whose 1 1 >71 Stanford Prison Exper
iment demonstrated the power of situational
forces to turn normal students into brutal guards,
argued that Americans in general and Stanford
students in particular are not challenging the ad
ministration on what constitutes dramatic human
rights abuse.
"I think students at Stanford are clueless about
torture," Zimbardo told The Daily before his talk.
"I think they could care less about it except to be
against it on principles of vague
human rights. 1 mean one of the
problems with Stanford — I've
been here twenty years — is that
there's too much sun; there's too
much beauty. It is hard to get people
motivated."
In front of a packed room. Zim
bardo discussed the topic of his up
coming book "The Lucifer Effect:
How Good People Turn Evil." He
described how situational forces at
the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq con
verted normal, good people into the
torturers captured on film in 2004.
"We have substituted social psy
chology for Dr. Jekyll's chemicals,"
he said.
According to clinical social work
er and psychotherapist Gerald Grey,
the government specifically used
/imbardo's famous Stanford Prison
Experiment to set up a system that
would inevitably lead to torture at
prisons like Abu Ghraib. "No U.S.
torture is accidental," Grey said.
"It's all planned; it's a policy."
The six-hour long series of lec
tures was emotionally charged —
with audience members viscerally
reacting when Ximbardo flashed im
ages of Abu Ghraib torture victims
on a slideshow. Earlier, during a
question and answer session, a self
described Republican stood up and
passionately stated his opposition to
President Bush and expressed frus
tration at his difficulty in learning
about changes to torture laws.
According to Mark Danner. the

Hush administration escaped much
blame for the Abu Ghraib scandal,
in part because the images released
in 2004 were shocking enough to
make it difficult for the public to be
lieve that the torture had been sanc
tioned. Quoting from the testimony
of an Abu Ghraib detainee and from
investigative reports and public
statements made by members of the
Bush administration, Danner ar
gued that officials knew about the
Abu Ghraib abuses and subse
quently lied about that knowledge.
"Officials lie in the full light of
day."he said.
Hie speakers also discussed the
Military Commissions Act. which
President Bush signed into law last
week, claiming the bill would save
American lives.
Legal experts Luban and Mar
tinez disagreed with the President's
assessment. Luban obtained what
was perhaps the most enthusiastic
audience response of the conference
when he called the Secretary of De
fense and other administration offi
cials "war criminals." under federal
law.The audience began to applaud,
but Luban cut them off, saying, "the
Senate fixed that."
He repeated that the Military
Commissions Act granted the presi
dent authority to review parts of the
Geneva Convention, removed de
tainee habeas corpus cases from the
courts and exempted some forms of
torture from war crime status
retroactively to before the begin
ning of the War on Terror.
Martinez pointed out that giving
the president this degree of authori
ty echoed the "king's prerogative" in
British monarchical history.
Each of the speakers expressed

palpable disappointment in the fail
ure of the American public to
demonstrate opposition to the Abu
Ghraib abuses and the Military
Commissions Act. Luban noted that
the government's human rights vio
lations were accompanied by "pretty
widespread public indifference" and
Danner responded to an audience
question by saying, "There is a sense
in which this implicates the country."
Zimbardo argued that Stanford
students are also to blame.
" I~he responsibility of a student
in a democratic society is to oppose
things you feel are wrong," he told
ITie Daily."But it all takes time. And
you know [that for] every student at
Stanford, every faculty member at
Stanford, the mantra is: i don't have
enough time.'"
Senior Galen Panger challenged
Zimbardo's pessimism. After at
tending the conference, he set up a
Facebook group called "Stanford
Against Torture" and has begun to
brainstorm ways to raise awareness
of the issues covered at the confer
ence.
In addition, in order to make the
information on the Abu Ghraib
abuses publicly available. Continu
ing Studies has posted recordings of
all of the presentations at the con
ference on the Stanford iTunes Web
site. According to Law School Dean
Larry Kramer, the Stanford Law
School elected to co-sponsor the
event precisely because public
knowledge of Abu Ghraib is so im
portant.
"Everyone who thinks and cares
about law and the legal order," he
wrote in an email to The Daily,
"needs to ponder and explore what
happened at Abu Ghraib."

" I~he responsibility of a student
in a democratic society is to oppose
things you feel are wrong," he told
ITie Daily."But it all takes time. And
you know [that for] every student at
Stanford, every faculty member at
Stanford, the mantra is: i don't have
enough time.'"
Senior Galen Panger challenged
Zimbardo's pessimism. After at
tending the conference, he set up a
Facebook group called "Stanford
Against Torture" and has begun to
brainstorm ways to raise awareness
of the issues covered at the confer
ence.
In addition, in order to make the
information on the Abu Ghraib
abuses publicly available. Continu
ing Studies has posted recordings of
all of the presentations at the con
ference on the Stanford iTunes Web
site. According to Law School Dean
Larry Kramer, the Stanford Law
School elected to co-sponsor the
event precisely because public
knowledge of Abu Ghraib is so im
portant.
"Everyone who thinks and cares
about law and the legal order," he
wrote in an email to The Daily,
"needs to ponder and explore what
happened at Abu Ghraib."
Journalists, lawyers and psychologists spent
Friday detailing alleged abuses of power in Iraqi
prisons and discussing recent legislation decrimi
nalizing abuses as part of the conference "Think
ing Humanity after Abu Ghraib."
Psychology prof. Philip Zimbardo, New Yorker
reporter Mark Danner, visiting Law Prof. David
Luban, Law Prof. Jenny Martinez, psychotherapist
Gerald Grey and UC Berkeley Rhetoric Profes
sor Judith Butler gave the audience a crash course
in human rights, the Bush Administration's efforts
to escape legal and political criticism and the Sen
ate's recent legalization of torture.
Zimbardo, whose 1 1 >71 Stanford Prison Exper
iment demonstrated the power of situational
forces to turn normal students into brutal guards,
argued that Americans in general and Stanford
students in particular are not challenging the ad
ministration on what constitutes dramatic human
rights abuse.
"I think students at Stanford are clueless about
torture," Zimbardo told The Daily before his talk.
"I think they could care less about it except to be
against it on principles of vague
human rights. 1 mean one of the
problems with Stanford — I've
been here twenty years — is that
there's too much sun; there's too
much beauty. It is hard to get people
motivated."
In front of a packed room. Zim
bardo discussed the topic of his up
coming book "The Lucifer Effect:
How Good People Turn Evil." He
described how situational forces at
the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq con
verted normal, good people into the
torturers captured on film in 2004.
"We have substituted social psy
chology for Dr. Jekyll's chemicals,"
he said.
According to clinical social work
er and psychotherapist Gerald Grey,
the government specifically used
/imbardo's famous Stanford Prison
Experiment to set up a system that
would inevitably lead to torture at
prisons like Abu Ghraib. "No U.S.
torture is accidental," Grey said.
"It's all planned; it's a policy."
The six-hour long series of lec
tures was emotionally charged —
with audience members viscerally
reacting when Ximbardo flashed im
ages of Abu Ghraib torture victims
on a slideshow. Earlier, during a
question and answer session, a self
described Republican stood up and
passionately stated his opposition to
President Bush and expressed frus
tration at his difficulty in learning
about changes to torture laws.
According to Mark Danner. the

Hush administration escaped much
blame for the Abu Ghraib scandal,
in part because the images released
in 2004 were shocking enough to
make it difficult for the public to be
lieve that the torture had been sanc
tioned. Quoting from the testimony
of an Abu Ghraib detainee and from
investigative reports and public
statements made by members of the
Bush administration, Danner ar
gued that officials knew about the
Abu Ghraib abuses and subse
quently lied about that knowledge.
"Officials lie in the full light of
day."he said.
Hie speakers also discussed the
Military Commissions Act. which
President Bush signed into law last
week, claiming the bill would save
American lives.
Legal experts Luban and Mar
tinez disagreed with the President's
assessment. Luban obtained what
was perhaps the most enthusiastic
audience response of the conference
when he called the Secretary of De
fense and other administration offi
cials "war criminals." under federal
law.The audience began to applaud,
but Luban cut them off, saying, "the
Senate fixed that."
He repeated that the Military
Commissions Act granted the presi
dent authority to review parts of the
Geneva Convention, removed de
tainee habeas corpus cases from the
courts and exempted some forms of
torture from war crime status
retroactively to before the begin
ning of the War on Terror.
Martinez pointed out that giving
the president this degree of authori
ty echoed the "king's prerogative" in
British monarchical history.
Each of the speakers expressed

palpable disappointment in the fail
ure of the American public to
demonstrate opposition to the Abu
Ghraib abuses and the Military
Commissions Act. Luban noted that
the government's human rights vio
lations were accompanied by "pretty
widespread public indifference" and
Danner responded to an audience
question by saying, "There is a sense
in which this implicates the country."
Zimbardo argued that Stanford
students are also to blame.
" I~he responsibility of a student
in a democratic society is to oppose

ITie Daily."But it all takes time. And
you know [that for] every student at
