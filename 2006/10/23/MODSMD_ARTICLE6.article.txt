## Group calls for lower emissions Students cite inadequacies in Stanford Challenge 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Global warming has become a hot issue at
Stanford with the University's announcement of
new sustainability institutes and funding increases
for environmental research in the past few years.
Yet students at last night's kickoff for the Stan
ford Climate Change Campaign, a subset of the

student group Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford. expressed concern that the University is not
taking action fast enough.
Senior Zach Dembo spoke to a group of about
70 students and stall in the Bechtel International
Center about convincing the I Jniversity to reduce
its greenhouse gas emissions and establish targets
similar to that of the Kyoto Protocol. The group
has specifically demanded that the University re
duce emissions by ten percent of the 1 WO emission
levels by the year 2020 and eventually work to
ward achieving zero-net carbon emissions.
