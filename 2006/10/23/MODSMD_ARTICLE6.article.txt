## Group calls for lower emissions Students cite inadequacies in Stanford Challenge 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Global warming has become a hot issue at
Stanford with the University's announcement of
new sustainability institutes and funding increases
for environmental research in the past few years.
Yet students at last night's kickoff for the Stan
ford Climate Change Campaign, a subset of the

student group Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford. expressed concern that the University is not
taking action fast enough.
Senior Zach Dembo spoke to a group of about
70 students and stall in the Bechtel International
Center about convincing the I Jniversity to reduce
its greenhouse gas emissions and establish targets
similar to that of the Kyoto Protocol. The group
has specifically demanded that the University re
duce emissions by ten percent of the 1 WO emission
levels by the year 2020 and eventually work to
ward achieving zero-net carbon emissions.
To the campaign's organizers, the
proposed policy was everything but
ambitious.
"I wish I could tell you that what
we're proposing to you now is cutting
edge, that we're pushing the enve
lope, but the fact of the matter is,
we're behind," Dembo said. "We're
behind our other benchmark institu
tions, we're behind in the state, and 1
believe we're behind in the nation."
Founded during the winter of
2006, the campaign met with Presi
dent John Hennessy in the spring.
Dissatisfied with Hennessy's re
sponse. the group's leaders hope to
meet with the president again this
year and secure his approval for the
plan by the end of this school year.
In recent years, the University has
announced several new plans for en
vironmental action. In the spring of
2004. the University created the
Ward W.and Priscilla B.Woods Insti
tute for the Environment, which is
headed by faculty members Jeffrey
Koseff, Pamela Maston and Barton
11. "Buzz" Thompson. Jr.
Designed to promote interdisci
plinary research and address envi
ronmental issues from a variety of
fields, the institute will be housed in

the new Energy and Environment
Building, tentatively scheduled for
completion by the end of 2007. The
building will serve as a central loca
tion for interdisciplinary environ
mental research on campus.
And just this month, the Universi
ty announced The Stanford Chal
lenge, which aims to make Stanford a
more effective global citizen by es
tablishing a $250 million goal for the
Initiative on the Environment and
Sustainability.
Alumnus Jay Precourt. who has
spent most of his career in the oil and
energy industry, also recently gave
$30 million to establish the Precourt
Institute for Energy Efficiency at
Stanford. The Precourt Institute will
attempt to improve the efficiency of
energy use. focusing on buildings,
transportation, fuels and power dis
tribution.
Academic departments and stu
dent groups have mobilized in recent
months as well. Jordan Wilkinson, a
member of the Environmental Engi
neering department, spoke about
plans to test wind turbines on campus
and in the surrounding area. The de
partment of Civil and Environmental
Engineering, meanwhile, continues
to promote the Green Dorm project,
which has brought together a group
of students, faculty and industry ex
perts to design and build a sustain
able dorm on campus. The project's
goal is to introduce cutting-edge en

vironmentally-friendly technology to
the campus and make the Green
Dorm the most desirable housing for
students.
Organizers of the Climate
Change Campaign, however, high
lighted the importance of green
house gas testing on campus. Dembo
said he was surprised when he dis
covered that Stanford didn't already
have emissions reduction plan in
place.
"I figured, it's Stanford — we're a
center of liberal thought in one of the
most aggressive states on climate
change." he said. "If you're going to
tell me that Stanford, the home of
Yahoo and Google, can only inno
vate when it comes to computers and
not when it comes to other things, in
cluding public policy, then I would be
ashamed."
1 lammad Ahmed, a senior major
ing in international relations and one
of the Climate Change Campaign or
ganizers, said that a formal study to
assess the level of carbon emissions
on campus may be completed by Feb.
2007 with the University's support.
Most students at the meeting ex
pressed a determination to work with
the University and raise the level of
awareness among students.
"(Climate change] is one of the
most important issues in the world
today." said freshman Teresa Rob
bins. "Tilings are going dramatically
wrong very fast."
