## Monday Mayhem presents: Tower Wars 
### BRANDON DAVID SILBERSTEIN INTERMISSION TOWER WARRIOR 
Let's face it people. Stanford is downright
amazing. As far as I'm concerned, we're
the best damn school in the country. We
have the best students, the sports
(please disregard football for the moment), the
best atmosphere, the best professors -we're pret
ty close to perfect.True, the administration has its
problems, like not giving a crap about the arts
(and hopefully that's even changing), but that is
for a separate scathing opinion piece. This, this is
much different.

I say we're the best,
but as I speak it,
there's an asterisk
there, a little foot
note denoting a

slight modifi
cation to

thisstate
men t .
And
you
L may

wonder, with everything so perfect, what could
/ this possibly refer to? There's a simple answer.
' It's not the lack of In 'N' Out on campus. It's not
that bike accidents take place everyday - in fact.
I think that adds character. No. it's much simpler
than that.
Hoover Tower. Hoover's last stand. Hoover's
erection.
Hoover Tower has stood proudly since 1941,
and many people have climbed to the top and
looked out lipon its magnificent view. So many
smiles have been ignited by that perch high atop
campus. Hoover Tower, in and of itself, is won
derful. There's no inherent problem there.
But that's where Berkeley comes into play.
Fucking Berkeley. You see, ladies and gentle
men. Sather Tower (a.k.a. The Campanile), the
giant clock tower on campus, built in 1914, is big
ger than Hoover Tower by 22 feet. It has 61 caril
lon bells, which is 13 more than Hoover Tower.
And it has a clock, nay. not just any clock, not just
one clock, but, the biggest freakin' FOUR clocks
in all of California. And you know what? We
can't starld for this any longer.
That's right, friends. It's time to unite. Hoover
Tower has served us well as it is. but it needs to be
bigger, better, bolder and, most importantly,
meet the following specifications known as Pro
ject Viagra:

1. It must be at least three hundred
and EIGHT feet tall.
2. It must have at least SIXTY
TWO carillon bells.
3. It must have FIVE clocks with
hands measuring at least EIGH
TEEN FEET each.
4. It must still look like a
giant penis.

Now, what 1 have compiled here- are the mini
mum requirements that would make Hoover
Tower minimally superior to Sather Tower. But 1

mean, honestly, let's think about this. Are we re
ally content with just being slightly superior to
Berkeley? Of course we want to be superior to
Berkeley, but that's not the point. We're pretty
much superior to the rest of the world. Which
means, that list up top needs to have the follow
ing corrections made to it:
Number one shall be amended to read, "It
must be at least ONETHOUSAND SIX HUN
DRED AND SIXTY EIGHT FEET," thus
beating out the title of the Taipei 101 for tallest
building in the world, and finally sending the
title back to America where it belongs. Also, the
clause shall be added, "and must be visible from
space."
Number two shall be amended to read, "It
must have at least 78 bells " thus beating out the
Kirk-In-The-Hills Presbyterian Church in
Bloomfield Hills. Michigan for the title of
largest carillon in the world. Also the clause
shall be added "and must be audible from
space." (Keep in mind that this will be extreme
ly difficult,considering that sound cannot prop
agate in space).
Number three shall be amended to read, "It
must have FIVE clocks with a diameter measur
ing at least FIFTY FEET," thus beating out the
Flower Clock in Tehran for the title of the world's
largest clock. Also the clause shall be added "and
must be able to tell space-time."
Number four shall stand as is.
Finally, a fifth specification shall be added,
which reads, "It must also be a giant Transformer
with the ability to travel through space and space
time."
By following these simple specifications.
Hoover Tower will easily be the best tower in the
world.
Now, some of you might call Project Viagra
"Tower Envy," and you might be right, but you
know what I call it? Justice.
That's right. We're Stanford University. We are
well endowed with over 12 billion dollars, and I
think it should be put to use on something worth
while. Let's show the rest of the world that we are
the best, and let's show it to them so they can see
it from space. Don't you see? We're not compen
sating for anything. We don't have Freudian com
plexes. We're just building the largest phallic
shaped object in the world because it's a wonder
ful idea. Let's do it for the Hoover. Let's do it for
all of us.
OK? Great. Good. *Cough*PENlS*Cough.*
Sorry, I have a cold. Ahem.
