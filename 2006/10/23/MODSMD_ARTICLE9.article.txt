Why waste precious time (that could be spent studying!) read
ing the blogs of your friends when you can rely on Stanford
BlogStalker to quickly gather all the best quotations from the
University blogosphere, completely out of context?
"The crazy cat is climbing as high as he can. playing a solo game
of'king of the mountain'. He also had tun with my old Furby
from college days.... alter we dug it out (upon hearing it start up
because we jarred the box), Wirt sniffed.
"Where's the photocopier, where do I pick up packages, how do I
avoid infecting myself with super-bacteria and where do I go it I
do - that kind of thing."
"Water only comes from a stream and deodorant is synonymous
with bear attacks.'
"The photograph of a man riding a bike with a pig is admittedly
hard to top. but I realize 1 have a couple other photographic gems
that warrant sharing."
"1 finally decided to go back to the orphanage."
"We came to this vacation house to celebrate the birthday of my
grandmother's cousin's husband (who also happens to be. ironi
cally, my grandfather's close childhood friend).
"1 took a picture of what the inside of a mouse looks like."
"One of the greatest challenges that befalls a frenzied medical
student is ascertaining which of her passions she hangs onto, and
of which she places on a back burner in Bogaloosa."
"I'm in Mango heaven :-)"
