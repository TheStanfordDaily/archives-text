If ||r Technology Associate
'Sfet Resume Deadline: TOMORROW
All majors encouraged.
No finance experience necessary.
At Bridgewater Associates, even our most junior employ
ees are encouraged, and expected, to challenge and criticize
management of all levels. This isn't some ideal we print in
our public literature; it's something we practice every day.
This approach allows us to constantly improve our opera
tions and consistently beat the markets. It will allow you to
make a difference in the way we do things in an environment
where everyone's opinion is valued equally.
As a Technology Associate, you'll be running your own proj
ects and you'll have the freedom to make an impact from day
one. In these respects, we believe Bridgewater provides a
better opportunity than software companies and other finan
cial firms. Technology is central to our success and to main
taining our competitive edge. Our systematic approach to
investing and creative use of technology make our superior
track record possible. With more than $160 billion in as
sets under management, we're one of the largest managers
of hedge fund strategies in the world. With fewer than 350 M
employees, your work will make a difference. *
