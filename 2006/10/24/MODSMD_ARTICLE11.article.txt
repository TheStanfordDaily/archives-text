There do you see yourself in 10
\/V / years?" This favoured question
▼ V of unimaginative interviewers
and second rate speakers is much more fun
when you look hack on it. Instead of inquir
ing about the future, think about the present:
Ask yourself where you thought you would
be. and compare it with where you are.
I spent my Saturday night talking about
mattresses.That's right. Saturday. Night . Mat
tresses.
Had I. tor example, been bouncing up and
down on a mattress whilst having this conver
sation it wouldn't have been so bad. Sadly,
however. I was at a party having what passes
for "fun" in my ever more depressing life.
When I was younger, I thought of my 2()s
as a golden time. A time filled with promise.
A time of whirlwind success and lots of sex. I.
and most of peers, thought we would be shap
ing the world in between celebrity-fuelled
drug binges.
Needless to say, things aren't quite as 1 had
imagined. I m not actually partying with stars
(or partying at all); and. while I'm achieving
my lifelong ambition to be a physicist (yes, I
know I'm lame), I'm not actually very good at
physics.
Personal failings, however, are not what 1
wish to lament in this week's lament. Rather
it is the ordinary and the common that besets

Throughout the past, the underlying no
tion behind all of my dreams has been that
my days would sparkle — against a feature
less backdrop the bright glow of glorious tri
umphs would be the sum of my existence.
In a way this is a universal theme: when
contemplating the future we think not of the
details, but rather of the larger events that
shall come to pass. Whilst this sort of thing is
fine for idle reflection, it is not how life actu
ally is.
Life is mundane. Our existence is defined
by the trivial minutiae of the everyday. We
are not the wild, hedonistic party on the mat
tress, we are the 20-minute conversation
about which mattress we should buy.
The fact that existence comes down to se
quences of inconsequential events is. I sup
pose. not as depressing as one might imagine.
For. like all good generalizations, the domi
nation of the insignificant is an absolute
Truth. And those troubles that afflict us all

are not so much troubles as they are just rules
of the game.
Of course, this "everybody's screwed"
principle is a somewhat less than cheery way
to look at life. After all. we still have to go
through the pain that accompanies one's re
alization of the supremacy of the trifling.
It is easy, and common amongst us all dur
ing our youths, to maintain the delusion that
the past is irrelevant, the present transitory
and the future definitive. That delusion is
roundly smashed with the passage of time —
accumulating more "past" is a sure way to see
the hopelessness of the future.
And here (finally) we come to the point.
Saturday night discussions of mattresses are
not bad in and of themselves. After all, day
to-day life is defined by day-to-day things.
What s upsetting is the gradual realisation
that this is all there is.
The rest of my life (and yours) will be
filled with the humdrum and the common
place. All we have to look forward to is, well,
more of the same. And given how utterly de
pressing "the same" is, that's a terrifying
prospect.

Sorry, /his whole column was supposed to be a
wry look at late night discussions. Somehow it
morphed into something of a sadder note.
Apologies for that, and Ill make up for it with
a joke if you email navins@stanford.edu.
