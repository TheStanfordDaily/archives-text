Bike Ban is long overdue
Regarding the editorial. "University
should justify new hike policy" (Oct. 3), I
believe a rigorous bike policy is long over
due.
At my 60th class reunion, I rode the shut
tle bus. no seat belts. Jhe driver stopped sud
denly to avoid an errant cyclist; I was thrown
inside the bus, broke six ribs and hospital
ized for 12 days, barely surviving pneumo
nia.
Somewhat later, feeling sorry for myself, I
wrote to President John Hennessy on March
15.2004 suggesting implementation of tough
rules for cyclists. No response.
On April 15 I wrote to Hennessy again.
On April 30 the office of the General Coun
sel did respond.
I'm happy to hear that three years later
the University is taking action.

Daily editorial mistakes
economics situation
The premise of The Daily's editorial,
"Economics Department Institutes New Re
quirements, Alienates Students" (Oct. IK) is
false in two important ways.
The Editorial Board suggests that eco
nomics, like other Stanford departments,
should offer upper division courses of two
kinds, some with rigor for our majors and
others with low entry costs, so that a large
number of students from many different ma
jors could take them. We agree. That's why
we offer a wide range of upper division
courses; many, many courses of both kinds.
The Board's suggestion that we should
"keep supply and demand in mind" and be
concerned that "fewer students will take
|our] courses" in the second, low-entry-cost,
category seems a little premature. In the typ
ical quarter.around 750 non-majors (i.e.,stu
dents who are not present or future majors)
take economics courses. That's about half of

the total demand tor our courses, and seems
to offer a little headroom before we hit the
empty classroom.
More importantly, we spent a great deal
ol time working with students and with fac
ulty in many other programs to design our
meet-both-demands approach. It strains
available resources right to the limit to offer
so many diverse courses, but we are commit
ted to it. Hi is is important, and it is hard
work. We are committed both to offering
majors (and those with similar training) a
ligorous experience and offering a wide va
riety of students the opportunity to use the
concepts of economics on interesting prob
lems.
ITie other way the Edit Hoard goes off the
i ails is with this weird "alienates students"
charge. TTie changes the Board bemoans are
a response to the most frequent request we
have had from majors since putting in place
the new economics core in 1997. Stanford
students want rigorous and com
pelling courses in their chosen
major. Faculty members want to
teach them, too. ITiis isn't alienation;
it is the Stanford model of under
graduate education at work.
There are a number of other,
smaller, errors in The Daily's editori
al, so students' relying on it as a guide
to choosing classes or programs is a
bad idea.

Response to North Korea
Andrew Leifer's column in yes
terday's Daily on North Korea's nu
clear test is representative of the un
necessary and misdirected Ameri
can obsession over technical devel
opments in the country's program

("Norks go nuclear"). Every time
Kim Jong II upsthe ante, politicians,
journalists and even college stu
dents rise to the occasion, declare he
is defying the "world" and proceed
to make fun of the North Korean
leader.
If people actually knew some
thing about this political issue and
cared about peace on the Korean
peninsula, they would instead be
asking the most fundamental ques
tions. Why do we fret about North
Korean nuclear weapons when we
can tolerate them elsewhere? Why is

North Korea so bent on acquiring
nuclear capabilities despite the enor
mous American pressure not to?
Why is South Korea, the nation most
vulnerable to North Korea, in favor
of engagement rather than hostile
sanctions? Bashing and wagging
your finger at a perceived enemy is
the easiest thing to do in the world.
Stanford students should know bet
ter and strive for a deeper under
standing of North Korea.
