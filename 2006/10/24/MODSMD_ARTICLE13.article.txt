## World Series of misfits 
### 
The Detroit Tigers and the St.
Louis Cardinals: two teams that
stumbled, bumbled and fell into
the 2006 MLB playoffs.
It was only three years ago that the
Detroit squad set an American League
record for most losses in a season with
119. Nine current Tigers were part of
that disastrous team and remember it
well.
After appearing to have clinched
the AL Central with a major league
best 59-29 record at the All-Star break,
the Tigers let a huge lead slip past
them, surrendering the division crown
to the Minnesota Twins on the last day
of the regular season. And after drop
ping Game One of the ALDS to the
Evil Empire, it seemed Detroit's first
playoff appearance since 1987 would
be a short one.
But the magic that carried the
Tigers through the season followed
them through the postseason,allowing
Detroit three straight wins against
New York and then a sweep of Oak
land in the ALCS.
The NL Central title is given each
season in St. Louis, though the Red
Birds almost posted one of the worst
regular-season collapses in history dur
ing the final week of play. The Cardi
nals blew an eight-game division lead
in late September, finally clinching the
title only after a Houston loss on the
season's final day.
St. Louis then traveled to San
Diego and spanked the Friars before
clinching the World Series with a his
toric finish in Game Seven of the
NLCS at Shea Stadium.
