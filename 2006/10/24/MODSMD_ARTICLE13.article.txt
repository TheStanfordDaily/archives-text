## World Series of misfits 
### 
The Detroit Tigers and the St.
Louis Cardinals: two teams that
stumbled, bumbled and fell into
the 2006 MLB playoffs.
It was only three years ago that the
Detroit squad set an American League
record for most losses in a season with
119. Nine current Tigers were part of
that disastrous team and remember it
well.
After appearing to have clinched
the AL Central with a major league
best 59-29 record at the All-Star break,
the Tigers let a huge lead slip past
them, surrendering the division crown
to the Minnesota Twins on the last day
of the regular season. And after drop
ping Game One of the ALDS to the
Evil Empire, it seemed Detroit's first
playoff appearance since 1987 would
be a short one.
But the magic that carried the
Tigers through the season followed
them through the postseason,allowing
Detroit three straight wins against
New York and then a sweep of Oak
land in the ALCS.
The NL Central title is given each
season in St. Louis, though the Red
Birds almost posted one of the worst
regular-season collapses in history dur
ing the final week of play. The Cardi
nals blew an eight-game division lead
in late September, finally clinching the
title only after a Houston loss on the
season's final day.
St. Louis then traveled to San
Diego and spanked the Friars before
clinching the World Series with a his
toric finish in Game Seven of the
NLCS at Shea Stadium.
1 suredidn't pick either one of these

two teams to make the Series, and I
doubt many writers entered spring
training with hopes of spending cold
October nights in Detroit.
But fans and analysts were quick to
jump on the Detroit bandwagon. Over
70 percent of fans predicted the Tigers
would roll over the Cards in an ESPN
poll. St. Louis then dominated Game
One and came within a hit of taking
Game Two in Detroit as well.
But I do admit I'm getting tired of
the same old October story. The Dia
mondbacks, the Angels, the Marlins,
the Red Sox and the White Sox — all
teams that had no business playing in
the World Series and still ended up
winning it all. Either St. Louis or De
troit would make a nice addition to the
list.
Jeff Weaver? Yadier Molina?
WTF? Where the hell was Weaver
when he played in Los Angeles? This
guy was released by Anahei — errr,
the Angels — after losing his place in

the rotation to his younger brother.
And now. he is as reliable as they come
in the postseason, despite his loss on
Sunday. And then there's Yadier Moli
na. who hit .216 during the regular sea
son. delivering the Cards into the
World Series with a ninth-inning
homer against the Mets in Game
Seven of the NLCS.
There's also the rebirth of Kenny
Rogers, who has not allowed a single
earned run in 23 innings this postsea
son. Not bad for a guy who appeared
to have forever tainted his career by
attacking a cameraman last season.
But Rogers can't seem to avoid
controversy. Several camera shots re
vealed a brown substance on his hand
during his Game Two start. If 1 were
Tony Laßussa after spotting the sub
stance from my dugout, I would have
jumped over hoops to get the umpires
to check Rogers' hand. Even if the
stuff was simply dirt — as Rogers ar
gues it was — it wouldn't have hurt to
try to get inside the pitcher's head and
halt his ridiculous momentum. 1 un
derstand Rogers may have broken the
rules, but I'm not willing to make a big
deal about it if the Cardinals aren't.
And how about that wonderful De

troit weather? According to ESPN,
Jim Edmonds was wearing a wind
breaker under his uniform. You've got
to love that sense of fashion.
But none of these stories can
outdo the awesome game that tran
spired Sunday night.Trailing by three
runs and down to their final strike in
the ninth inning, the Cards posted an
incredible rally, collecting a run and
bringing the go-ahead run to the
plate. Detroit closer Todd Jones
eventually collected the final out to
bring a collective sigh of relief to
Comerica Park.
Yet despite the media hype. Game
One drew in the worst television rat
ings for the opener in history. Go fig
ure.
Don't worry loyal readers; I'll be
sure to come up with a controversial,
idiotic position next week, as soon as 1
dry the tears that overflowed from
checking my email last Tiiesday after
noon. Man, readers can be harsh —
and incoherent. Oh, and Lyons still de
served to be fired.
I love my job.
