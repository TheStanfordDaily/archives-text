tough." Falk said."l think in the first
half of both games we didn't come
out to play, but in both games we
stepped it up the second half and
were able to keep better possession
of the ball. We kept working hard
and finished out enough chances on
goal to win. In saying that, our play
and possession of the ball wasn't
great, but it was enough to get us the
win."
