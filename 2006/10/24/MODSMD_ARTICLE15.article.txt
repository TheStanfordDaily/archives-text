The No. 19Stanford women'ssoc

ence wins last weekend in Washing
ton, lifting them to third in the Pac-10
standings, behind only first-place
UCLA and second-place Oregon.
Junior goalkeeper Erica I iolland led
the defense in recording Stanford's
10th and 11th shutouts of the season.
Sophomore defender Allison
Falk recorded her second goal of the
year against the Cougars (7-5-3,2-1-
1 Pac-10), pulling the Cardinal (11-5-
1,4-1-1) past Washington State last
Friday in a 1-0 victory. Although
Stanford was not at the top of their
game the first half, the team was cer
tainly fired up from the start. Fresh
man forward Kelley O'Hara took
three shots in the first 12 minutes.
Washington State goalkeeper Brynn
Bernis, who entered the weekend
leading the conference in save per
centage, stopped all three attempts.
"Both Washington teams were
tough." Falk said."l think in the first
half of both games we didn't come
out to play, but in both games we
stepped it up the second half and
were able to keep better possession
of the ball. We kept working hard
and finished out enough chances on
goal to win. In saying that, our play
and possession of the ball wasn't
great, but it was enough to get us the
win."
The Cardinal attack got another
good chance early after earning a
corner kick in the first half. Sopho
more midfielder Lea MacKinnon
took the kick and found Falk, but the
midfielder's shot was picked up by
Bernis. Cougars forward Anna
Miller followed up with a shot on

goal in the 17th minute. I lolland de

at the start of the second half, putting
Stanford on the defensive. I lowever,

Junior defender April Wall prepares a kick against Arizona. Women's soccer swept both Washington teams last weekend, defeating the Cougars 1 -0 and the
Huskies 2-0 in their 1 4th and 1 sth shutout matches of the season, respectively, bringing the team up to third in Pac-1 0 standings.
the end of the game, while Stanford
outshot Washington State, 15-7.
Two days later, Stanford cruised
past Washington 2-0 in Seattle, out
shooting its opponent for the 15th
time this season. O'Hara and fellow
freshman Kristin Stannard recorded
one shot each to lead their team to its
fourth conference victory.
"We knew that both Washington
games would be tough, especially on
the road,'" Stannard said."Basically it
came down to whoever wanted it
more. We earned a lead in each game
and had to fight tooth and nail to
keep it, and to not let down."
Sophomore forward Hillary
Heath found Stannard in the center
of the box, who put the Cardinal on
the scoreboard in the first three min
utes of play; this marked Stannard's
fourth career goal. Stanford regis
tered four more shots during the first
15 minutes of play.

Stanford's defense, aided by the
strong offensive attack, prevented
the Huskies from getting a shot dur
ing the first 30 minutes of play. Wash
ington took three shots in the 31st
minute, but Holland and her defense
stopped all three attempts.
The Cardinal finished the first half
leading 1-0. Holland recorded two
saves going into halftime.
Washington had a stronger sec
ond-half start, with three shots in the
first 10 minutes. Stanford followed
with four shots, and in the 63rd
minute Stannard and O'Hara com
bined efforts to put another mark on
the scoreboard for Stanford. Stan
narrd found O'Hara outside the box,
giving the forward a one-on-one op
portunity against Huskies goalkeep
er Kelsey Rasmussen. O'Hara blew
the ball past Rasmussen to post her
sixth goal of the season. She is now
tied with Summers for the team lead
in goals.
In the time remaining. Washing
ton sent five shots at the Cardinal de
fense, including another corner kick.
But Stanford's defense locked up the
game and kept the Huskies off the

scoreboard. Sunday marked Hol
land's third shutout and fourth win
this season.
"Everyone is very excited about
our wins the past weekend, and that
momentum hopefully will carry over
into this coming weekend," Falk said.
"However, although we won this past
weekend, we didn't play as well as we
could have. We definitely need to
step it up this coming weekend, and I
think playing at home will help us
with that."
The Cardinal return to Maloney
Field this weekend to play the Ore
gon schools. Stanford will face Ore
gon State Friday night at 7 p.m. The
weekend concludes with Senior Day
on Sunday at 1 p.m. against Oregon,
who are currently undefeated in the
Pac-10.
"It is going to take a lot of heart
and fight from everyone on the roster
to win these games this weekend,"
Holland said. "We have the skills
down and we know what to do; now
we just need to let it out and play. As
[former 49ers quarterback] Steve
Young says, 'Trust your instincts and
let it fly."'
