Stanford 0

Despite outshooting the Cardinal 9-3 in the
first half. Cal remained scoreless until just before
halftimc. At 44:22. sophomore midfielder Pat Mar
ion scored off a cross from junior midfielder Luke
Sassano.and the Bears took a 1-0 lead. Coach Bret
Simon pointed out that the goal shifted the bal
ance of the match.
"I think we were disappointed in giving up a
goal so late in the first half," Simon said, 'in a 0-0
game on the road, we should have been extra vigi
lant late in the half.'lTiat goal changed the face of
the game and forced us to make changes in our tac
tics at halftimc that we would have preferred to
avoid."
In the second half, two of the Cardinal's five
shots came from senior midfielder Galen Thomp
son and freshman midfielder Brant Bishop, both
of whom had two shots on the game, but neither
was able to find net. I lowever. the Bears came out
strong again, and redshirt sophomore midfielder
Jacob Wilson headed in Cal's second goal with 38
minutes left of play.
Ihe Bears' next attempt came in the 62nd
minute, when redshirt senior midfielder Nick
I latzke found junior forward Javier Ayala-Hil for
a header. Stanford's freshman goalie John Moore
notched one of his 10 saves on the play. Moore,
though, was not satisfied with his performance,
which yielded his 50th save of the season.
"I am disappointed whenever we lose," Moore
said. "I have the potential to stop every goal, and I
wish I could do so every time 1 step onto the pitch,
but the ball didn't bounce my way this time."
In the 66th minute. Ayala-Hil nearly had anoth
er chance after stealing the ball from the Cardinal.
However, the ball went out-of-bounds before
Ayala-I lil got a good look at the goal.

ers. Regardless of Cal's dominating
play, though, Moore partially attrib
uted the loss to the Cardinal not
playing at their full potential.
"We knew that Cal would be a
very tough opponent and we were
tactically and technically prepared
for the match," Moore said. "It
seemed that we came out flat as a
team. Coach Simon gave us the tools
to complete the job. but we failed to
utilize our full arsenal."
Although Cal's win also came on
its celebratory Senior Day, Simon

didn't believe that game sentiments
turned the tide.
"1 don't think Senior Day makes
much of a difference," Simon said.
"We each have plenty of good rea
sons to prepare and be at our best no
matter what the particular pre-game
ceremonies were."
Like Simon. Moore said that the
Cardinal's concentration remained
on the match,and that the team didn't
let outside events influence play.
"We tried to focus on the oppo
nent as a team, and not so much on
the standings or on their Senior Day,"
Moore said. "We consider those
things to be distractions that shift our
focus from the game, so we do not de
vote our energies towards them."
The Cardinal will next travel over
the weekend to UCLA and San

Diego State, where they will meet the
conference's third- and fourth
ranked teams.
"The trip to UCLA and San Diego
State will be a great way to measure
ourselves," Simon said." We had a win
and a draw versus these two teams
earlier in the year at Stanford, but
both have played better at home than
on the road."
Moore agreed that the Cardinal
would have to rebound from Friday's
loss if they hope to succeed in their
upcoming matches.
"Our goal is to win the next three
games," he said. "This is vital for us to
win the Pac-10 Conference and get a
tournament bid. We have proven that
we can win in big games; it's just a
matter of responding positively after
a tough loss."

vote our energies towards them."
The Cardinal will next travel over
the weekend to UCLA and San

Diego State, where they will meet the
conference's third- and fourth
ranked teams.
"The trip to UCLA and San Diego
State will be a great way to measure
ourselves," Simon said." We had a win
and a draw versus these two teams
earlier in the year at Stanford, but
both have played better at home than
on the road."
Moore agreed that the Cardinal
would have to rebound from Friday's
loss if they hope to succeed in their
upcoming matches.
"Our goal is to win the next three
games," he said. "This is vital for us to
win the Pac-10 Conference and get a
tournament bid. We have proven that
we can win in big games; it's just a
matter of responding positively after
a tough loss."
