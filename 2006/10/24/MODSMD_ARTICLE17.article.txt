### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The results for the Stanford men's
tennis team at the ITA Northwest Re
gional for the singles and doubles
fields swapped from last year to this
year.
In 2005's tournament, recent grad
uate KC Corkery won the singles draw
without losing a single set. while cur
rent senior James Pade advanced to
the semifinals before dropping a tight
three-setter. In doubles play, however,
no Stanford duo made it past the third
round last year.

This year, no Stanford player ad
vanced past the Round of 16 for sin
gles competition, hut a doubles team
battled to earn a spot in the finals.
Sophomore Blake Muller and fresh
man Paul Morrissey won four matches
together to advance to the finals today
at 10 a.m. against California's Pierre
Mouillon and Daniel Sebescen, the
No. 2 seed.
Over the last three days, Morrissey
and Muller earned their first four wins
as a duo, including an upset on Sunday
of the top-seeded pair, Washington's

Freshman Paul Morrissey readies for a return swing. Morrissey and sophomore
Blake Muller advanced to the ITA Regional doubles finals, today at 1 0 a.m, fac
ing California's Pierre Mouillon and Daniel Sebescen, the No. 2 seed.
Daniel Chu and Alex Slovic.
"I'm really happy with their per
formance right now." head coach
John Whitlinger said. "They beat a
very good team in Slovic and Chu.
We've taken our lumps with those
two guys, so that was definitely a
good win."
The pair displayed strong
serves, good communication and
aggressiveness this weekend.
Muller and Morrissey faced Wash
ington's Derek Drabble and Andy
Kuharsky Monday morning and
sent the Huskies home for a second
time.
The semifinal match remained on
serve until 4-all before the Cardinal
finally broke serve with a Husky
double fault. Up 5-4. Muller held
serve before they managing another
break to go up 7-4.
Morrissey was slated to serve out
the match, and Stanford went up 30-
love before Washington won two
consecutive points to even the score

at 30-all.The freshman from Ireland
then fired off two aces to punctuate
the win for the Card.
"Obviously, this [pair is) clicking
right now; I'm really excited that
they're in the final," Whitlinger said.
"They both hit a big serve, and if they
can return well, they're going to be
tough to beat. Up until [4-all], one
guy would return well and the other
would be missing â€” that happens in
doubles. But when they're [both re
turning] like they were the last four
games [on Monday], that's a pretty
good combination."
Stanford advanced one other
pair to the Round of 16. Junior
Chris Rasmussen and sophomore
Jeff Zeller earned two wins over Cal
Poly and Pacific before falling to
Hawaii in the third round on Sun
day. Senior Eric McKean teamed up
with Richard Wire and dropped a
close 9-8 decision to Cal Poly after
receiving a bye in the first round. Fi
nally, a duo from Washington hand
ed senior Dave Ryan and freshman
Kevin Kaiser an 8-3 loss in the first
round.
In singles action, of the nine Stan
ford entrants, only McKean and
Wire were able to advance past the

third round. McKean won his first
three matches in straight sets and
then met California's Kalim Stewart
in the fourth round. The Bear picked
up the first set in a tiebreaker. McK
ean was able to rebound and win the
second set 6-4, but Stewart edged out
the Card 6-4 in the third.
As the seventh seed. Wire re
ceived a bye before earning two
straight set wins, giving up no more
than four games in each match. Wire
then faced Sascha Heinmann of
Hawaii and dropped a tight 6-4,4-6,
6-3 decision in the Round of 16.
"I thought Eric McKean played
the best singles I've ever seen him
play," Whitlinger said. "He didn't
quite pull it out against Kalim Stew
art, but he played a great match. I
think Richard is a very talented play
er. With the match he lost, I'm not so
sure that the result would be the
same next time.
"I'm really pleased with how
well the guys are competing, and
that's what you need," Whitlinger
continued."l'm OK with the singles
[results]. I'm not ecstatic about
[them], but I know we're getting
better and that's what I'm really
happy about."
