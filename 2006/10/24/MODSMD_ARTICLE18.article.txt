## Card earn consolation prize Men defeat 2003 NCAA champion Lewis in Dino Cup match 
### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team finished the Husky Dino Cup
Tournament on a high note Saturday,
taking down powerhouse Lewis Uni
versity, the 2003 NCAA champions,
in the consolation game.
Stanford's first game of the sea
son came against the University of
Saskatchewan. The Cardinal had a
tough time finding a rhythm, and fell
to the Huskies in straight sets, 19-25,
23-25,21-25.
Friday, the Cardinal tried to right
their wrongs against Lewis, their first
of two matches that weekend with
the Flyers in the round-robin tourna
ment. However, they fell just short in
five matches, losing 21-25,25-22,29-
27,21-25,12-15.
Freshman outside hitter and set
ter Kawika Shoji played extremely
well, racking up kill after kill. He was
awarded Player of the Game, even
though that prize usually goes to a
member of the winning team.
Stanford then suited up for their
second game of the night against
tournament host University of Cal
gary. The night looked bleak after the
Cardinal lost both of their first two
games. Stanford was making a multi
tude of errors â€” missed serves, mis
communication and unpredictable
hitting.
The Cardinal came back with a
vengeance in the third and fourth
games, knowing that this would be
their last shot at making the tourna
ment championship. However, their
energy had run out by the fifth game
and Stanford lost, 22-25,23-25,27-25,
25-21,7-15.
Senior outside hitter Scott Price
and fifth-year senior setter Glen
Handley were crucial in the final out
come of the game.

On Saturday they faced l.ewis
again in the consolation match. Al
though Lewis, based in Chicago, is a
Division 11 school, they won the Di
vision I NCAA championship in
2003 with huge upsets against domi
nant Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation teams. The Flyers have been
struggling since outside hitter Gusta

vo Meyer was ruled ineligible and
their national championship was re
scinded.
The Cardinal's luck finally
turned, and once they got to the fifth
game, they were able to hold on for
the win,2s-1 l ). 22-25.23-25.25-22.15-

Sophomore setter Miki Groppi jumps for a return. The men's volleyball team
fell into consolation at the Husky Dino Tournament last weekend, but came
out with a win over 2003 NCAA champion Lewis University.
