### ANTHONY NGUYEN 
The No. 6 Stanford women's golf team was
unable to hold on to their second-round lead,
finishing fourth at the Stanford Intercollegiate
last weekend on the par-71 Stanford Golf
Course.
Entering the final round with a five-stroke
lead over No. 12 Arizona, the Cardinal fired a
15-over-par 299 (863 total after rounds of 286
and 278). Meanwhile, No. 9 Vanderbilt shot a
nine-under-par 275 (288-292-275 — 855), the
lowest team round of the tournament, catapult
ing them to victory over 12th-ranked Arizona
(277-292-291 — 860). No. 1 Georgia (284-286-
292 — 862) and San Jose State (297-300-280 —
877) round off the top five teams.
The best finishers, Vanderbilt, Arizona,
Georgia and Stanford, finished in the top slots
after each round. Most of the four ended a
round in first place, but Vanderbilt came out on
top. Following the second round, fourth-place
Vanderbilt swapped places with first-place
Stanford to take the tourney. Second-ranked
Duke (292-293-297 — 882) finished notably in
seventh and third-ranked UCLA (298-296-290
— 884) ended in eighth.
Playing in a tough field did not seem to rat
tle the Cardinal women.
"It's always great to play with the teams that
are playing the best," senior Lauren Todd said.
"I feel it brings out the best in our games."
Among the individuals, Arkansas' Stacy
Lewis (71-67-69 — 207) and Arizona's Alison
Walshe (67-71-69 — 207) tied for first. Stan
ford's Todd (70-68-70 — 208) and Arizona's
Adriana Zwanck (68-71-69 — 208) tied for
third. In the third round, Georgia's Whitney
Wade (67-69-73 — 209) fell from first to fifth in
a tight finish. The top five women were separat
ed by only two strokes.
Behind Todd were sophomore Mari Chun
(71-70-76 — 217) at 17th, senior Jennifer
Tangtiphaiboontana (72-71-76 — 219) at 23rd,
freshman Catherina Wang (73-69-78 —220) at
26th, and sophomore Ki-Shui Liao (83-77-77 —
237) at 63rd. As individual participants, fresh
man Angela King (74-73-71 —218) tied for
21st in her first collegiate tournament. Seniors
Saana Rapakko (77-79-78 — 234) and Jenna
Seki (79-85-76 — 240) finished 59th and 66th,
respectively.
Despite their third-round collapse.Todd was
optimistic about the team's potential.
"If we can [beat the No. 1 team] for two days,
we can do it for four [rounds of NCAA tourna
ments]," she said."We proved to ourselves we can
take it deep. Our second round was a great per
formance and this team is capable of much more.
"However, we were really disappointed
about not winning. Our goal is to finish strong
and to play at least as well as, if not better, than
our previous two rounds. Clearly, this week we
were unable to do that and everyone was disap
pointed," Todd continued.
The Stanford Intercollegiate was the Cardi

nal's last tourney of the year, as they prepare for
the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in
February 2007. Their fourth-place finish at this
weekend and their victory at the Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invitational end their year on an opti
mistic note.
"In the spring, I fully expect this team to

shoot some more low numbers," Todd said. "I
have so much faith in this team. We can win
NCAAs. and if we all play well the week of na
tionals, I would fully expect us to be in con
tention. 1 do not see any limitations in this team:
everyone works really hard and we all are real
ly competitive."
