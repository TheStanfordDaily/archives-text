# 'Hezbollah represents much more than a terrorist organization
## —RAMI KHOURI, Editor-at-Large of the Lebanese Star Editor: U.S. media favors Israel 
### ADAM SOWLATI 
The editor of u Lebanese daily newspaper argued last
night the media's coverage of the Lebanon War has been
biased against Hezbollah during the recent conflict.
"News coverage in the Middle East is abominable in
the United States," said Rami Khouri,the editor-at-large
of the English-language Lebanese Star and a visiting fel
low with the Center on Democracy, Development, and
the Rule of Law (CDDRL). "Generally speaking, the
portrayal of the Lebanon War has been quite distorted
and incomplete."
Khouri argued that Hezbollah has been painted with
too broad a brush as a terrorist group and assigned too
much blame for sparking the conflict.
"The reality is that Hezbollah represents much more
than what it's accused of being: a terrorist organization,"
he said, pointing to the social services they provide to
Lebanese civilians.
The first volley of the conflict began in July, when
Hezbollah units crossed the border into Israel, killing

three Israel soldiers and kidnapping two more. Khouri
argued that Hezbollah expected a retaliation on the
same level, and that the group was surprised when Israel
responded with air and artillery strikes on the Lebanese
civilian infrastructure. Hezbollah, he argued, did not re
alize that these kidnappings would lead to all-out war.
"The kidnappings created a traumatic situation for
Israel," said Khouri, explaining this response. "There was
a sense that the conflict with the Arabs was getting to a
dangerous situation."
Iliough the speech,co-sponsored by the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East, was mainly attended by a
crowd sympathetic to Khouri's arguments, his views did
not go unchallenged. During the question and answer
session after the talk, one audience member argued for
Israel's right to defend itself. Khouri responded that
while Israel is obliged to protect itself, if it kills civilians,
it must be held accountable.
While the recent conflict surprised many observers,
Khouri said it was a culmination of years of tensions be
tween Hezbollah and Israel. The media, he continued.

has unfairly thrust all the blame for the war on Hezbol
lah while Israel has not been held accountable for its
bombings of civilian areas.
Khouri also argued that this partisanship was divid
ing the world into two camps.
"A new cold war is forming in the Middle East," he
said. "What you have is the formation of a group of par
ties on one side, which includes Israel, the United States,
England and parts in Lebanon. On other side you have
Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Arab opinion and many of the
other governments in the world."
Yet despite this polarization, Khouri said that the
media has not highlighted the divisions within Lebanese
society over the war. He said that there was significant
infighting among various Lebanese factions during the
war over whether to support Hezbollah. Now. he said,
most of the society has coalesced behind the group.
Khouri also could not help but touch on the elephant
in the room.
"You have to have an Israeli state and a Palestinian
state at some point."
