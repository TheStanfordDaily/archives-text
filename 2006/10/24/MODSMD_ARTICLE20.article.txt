# More green for green projects
## New research will look to reduce the polution caused by coal power

ITie Global Climate and Energy Project (GCEP) yes
terday announced $1.15 million in awards for two re
search new programs and two exploratory research ef
forts that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emis
sions.
Spanning the research areas of biomass, advanced
coal utilization and integrated assessment of biofuels,
these projects bring the total number of GCEP-funded
programs to 32, with a total of $4b.6 million spent since
the project started in December 2002.
ITie first program."Microbial Synthesis of Biodiesel,"
hopes to genetically engineer a specific bacterium to im
prove biodiesel production. Led by Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering Prof. Chaitan Khosla, the project
could produce groundbreaking ways to make new types
of liquid fuels from biomass.
The second research program, "Technology Potential
of Biofuels: Feasibility Assessment," aims develop a way

to produce quantitative estimates of the total biomass re
source that is sustainably available and the necessary
costs to produce this biomass for energy. ITie project is
headed by Biological Sciences Prof. Christopher Held
and Rosamond Lee Naylor, the Julie Wrigley Senior Fel
low at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies and the Woods Institute for the Environment at
Stanford.
ITie other two exploratory project efforts will offer an
opportunity for researchers outside of Stanford to collab
orate on evaluating the potential of a novel coal-energy
conversion research concept. Both under the title "Inte
gration of Coal Energy Conversion with Aquifer-Based
Carbon Sequestration," these activities are spearheaded
by Chemical Engineering Associate Prof. Larry Baxter
and Mechanical Engineering Associate Prof. Dale Tree. If
successful, these projects could find a way to decrease
harmful global warming side effects of coal-based power
generation.
"These new research activities are based on excellent
science and step-out ideas," said GCEP Director
Franklin Orr Jr. in a press release.
The GCEP sponsored by corporate giants like Exxon-
Mobil. GE, Schlumberger and Toyota, plans to continue
to invest $225 million across the span of a decade to en
courage environment-friendly projects.
