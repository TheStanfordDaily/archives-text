# No cash for car contest
## Defense bill signed by Bush may deny winners $2 million prize RESEARCH 
### ARAM HUR DESK EDITOR 
When Stanford's research team walked away victo
rious from last year's Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency Grand Challenge, they did so with
pride,smiles and a fat $2 million check.This \ ear's win
ners-to-be may have 2 million fewer reasons to be elat
ed.
The prize money for the annual competition
this year the contest is looking for a car that can navi
gate a simulated urban environment for 61) miles in
less than six hours, without any human guidance — is
traditionally funded by the Defense Advanced Re
search Projects Agency (DARPA).the Pentagon's re
search branch. But after President Bush signed legisla
tion earlier this week that redraws the lines for de
fense spending, that cash award is in jeopardy. The de
cision to award prize money to this year's winners lies
no longer in DARPA's hands, hut in those of its boss —
the Director of Defense Engineering and Research.
Although Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Brian
Maka has not made an official statement rescinding
the award, some expressed worries that such a deci
sion might flag the motivation of participants. Hie lack
of financial incentive could also result in difficulties in
attracting corporate sponsors and a decrease in the
number of participating groups.
"Some groups are on the bubble of securing corpo
rate funds, so it may affect the participation of those
few teams," said Michael Montemerlo, senior re
searcher at Stanford's A 1 Labs and software lead for
Stanford's participating Racing Team.
However, Montemerlo predicted that any impact
from the loss of the prize money would be minimal.
"I don't think people actually compete in this gov
ernment contest for the money," Montemerlo said.
"The chances of winning are so slim,so it doesn't make
sense to do this for the money."
David Stavens.a fifth-year Ph. D.candidate in com
puter science and co-creator of Stanley, last year s win
ning race car. agreed, noting that these teams have
more humanitarian reasons for being in the game.
"The Urban Challenge is really a community ot
people who are excited about self-driving cars,"
Stavens said. "Self-driving cars have the potential to
change — and save — countless lives."
For innovators, he said, the reward does not lie in
dollar signs.
"In 10 or 20 years, when self-driving cars are every
where, [they] can say i was part of that.'" Stavens said.
"That's much more satisfying than a prize."

SUN-STAINED: First-years Josh Friedman and Elizabeth McCrillis enjoy the unseasonably warm weather outside the Law School.
Temperatures reached the high 70s yesterday.
According to Stavens, 89 teams
are currently registered for the up
coming race in November, hailing
from all parts of the U.S. as well as
countries like Australia, Austria,
China, France and Germany. While
the numbers are a bit shy compared
to the 195 participating teams last
year, Montemerlo said that "the
group of teams is getting better."

Indeed, this year's contest will
require more advanced groups, as
competitors will face a higher-tech
nology task. Unlike last year's race.

which had teams navigate an un
manned car through the Mojave
Desert, this year's participants must
carry out mock military missions by
negotiating standard city traffic,
complete with stop signs, traffic
lights and the possibility of colli
sion.
Started in 2(K)4. the DARPA con
test was launched with the goal of
developing smart vehicles that could
be used in real battle situations in
order to reduce casualties. With
more than 43.0(H) casualties on the
road every year, DARPA aims to en
able a third of all military vehicles
unmanned by 2015. The agency, cre
ated during the Cold War. is most fa
mous for its contributions to found
ing the Internet.

For those competing this year.
DARPA Director Tony Tether
promised that if he can't deliver a $2
million check, he will still have a nice
prize for the winners.
"1 promise that the trophies will
he given because I'll personally huy
them myself."Tether said in an inter
view with The San Francisco Chron
icle.
And despite the potential loss of
the $2 million prize, Stavens said he
is still looking forward to Novem
ber's competition.
"Stanford engineering is a fantas
tic environment for these kinds of
endeavors," he said. "There's already
excitement, and soon, there will be
innovation. It's going to be a great
year, regardless of prize money."
