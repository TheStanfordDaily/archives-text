# No cash for car contest
## Defense bill signed by Bush may deny winners $2 million prize RESEARCH 
### ARAM HUR DESK EDITOR 
When Stanford's research team walked away victo
rious from last year's Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency Grand Challenge, they did so with
pride,smiles and a fat $2 million check.This \ ear's win
ners-to-be may have 2 million fewer reasons to be elat
ed.
The prize money for the annual competition
this year the contest is looking for a car that can navi
gate a simulated urban environment for 61) miles in
less than six hours, without any human guidance — is
traditionally funded by the Defense Advanced Re
search Projects Agency (DARPA).the Pentagon's re
search branch. But after President Bush signed legisla
tion earlier this week that redraws the lines for de
fense spending, that cash award is in jeopardy. The de
cision to award prize money to this year's winners lies
no longer in DARPA's hands, hut in those of its boss —
the Director of Defense Engineering and Research.
Although Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Brian
Maka has not made an official statement rescinding
the award, some expressed worries that such a deci
sion might flag the motivation of participants. Hie lack
of financial incentive could also result in difficulties in
attracting corporate sponsors and a decrease in the
number of participating groups.
"Some groups are on the bubble of securing corpo
rate funds, so it may affect the participation of those
few teams," said Michael Montemerlo, senior re
searcher at Stanford's A 1 Labs and software lead for
Stanford's participating Racing Team.
However, Montemerlo predicted that any impact
from the loss of the prize money would be minimal.
"I don't think people actually compete in this gov
ernment contest for the money," Montemerlo said.
"The chances of winning are so slim,so it doesn't make
sense to do this for the money."
David Stavens.a fifth-year Ph. D.candidate in com
puter science and co-creator of Stanley, last year s win
ning race car. agreed, noting that these teams have
more humanitarian reasons for being in the game.
"The Urban Challenge is really a community ot
people who are excited about self-driving cars,"
Stavens said. "Self-driving cars have the potential to
change — and save — countless lives."
For innovators, he said, the reward does not lie in
dollar signs.
"In 10 or 20 years, when self-driving cars are every
where, [they] can say i was part of that.'" Stavens said.
"That's much more satisfying than a prize."
