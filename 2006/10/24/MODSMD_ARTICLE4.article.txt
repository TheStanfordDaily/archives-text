## Law students team up with ACLU to fight for illegals Lawyers decry detainments lasting up to four years 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the past month, the Stanford Law
School Immigrants' Rights Clinic has been
working closely with the American Civil Lib
erties Union to secure the release of four im
migrants in southern California who have
been detained for periods as long as four
years without a hearing.
Ihe group filed a motion Oct. 10 asking
U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter to grant the
detainees immediate hearings or release
them under conditions of supervision, but

I latter dismissed the case last Tuesday on the
grounds that each plaintiff's defense should
be brought forth separately.
Despite this setback, the ACLU and Stan
ford will push ahead with their challenge to
the policy.The problem with the current Im
migration and Customs Enforcement
Agency's policy, they argue, is that individu
als are routinely detained for extended peri
ods of time regardless of probable deport
ment in the future.
"People who are detained should get a
hearing to determine whether their deten
tion is justified," said Jayashri Srikantiah, di
rector of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic and
an associate professor at the Law School.
"This is not just limited to California. It is a
problem nationwide with the De
partment of Homeland Security's
immigration policies."
The four detainees include Ray
mond Soeoth, a 38-year-old Chinese
immigrant from Indonesia, John
Rasheed, a 37-year-old Nigerian,
Amadou Diouf. a 31-year-old Sene
galese man. and Victor Martinez, an
Ecuadorian immigrant.
' All four of the detainees have
been kept for more than 18 months.
Martinez, who has been detained for
nearly four years, has a nine-year-old
daughter who is an American citizen.
"A lot of these are people who, for
all intents and purposes, have lived in
the United States their entire life."
said Cecilia Wang, a senior staff
counsel for the ACLU Immigrant
Rights Project. "You wouldn't guess
that they're not American. They're
all working and contributing to their
communities."
Prior to his detainment. Soeoth
worked as a pastor in his community
and owned a small cell phone busi
ness.
"This man has no criminal convic
tions. and would be faced with perse
cution if he returned to his home
country," Wang said.
Srikantiah argued that the cur
rent detention process makes it al
most impossible for detainees to
seek legal help or advice.

lawyers, or finances or even their
families," Srikantiah said. "They are
prevented from seeking what they
need to get out of detention as a re
sult of being in detention.This is why
we need a uniform policy governing
the process, so that each person is
treated the same."
The recent motion came after
Stanford and the ACLU filed a class
action lawsuit, calling for the release
of six detainees. I"he motion led to
the release of two of the six plaintiffs,
but the reasoning behind the detain
ment of the other four remains un
clear.
"There really is no consistent pro
cedure," Srikantiah said. "One of the
challenges in this issue is that it ap
pears to have no rhyme or reason in
terms of who is released and who's
not."
In 2001, the Supreme Court ruled
in Zadvydas v. Davis that immigrants
awaiting deportation could not be
held in detention longer than six
months '"unless there is a realistic
chance that an immigrant will be re
moved." While this case pertained
only to those detainees under a final
order, Srikantiah said their eventual
goal is to have all detainees included
in this stipulation.
Virginia Kice.a spokeswoman for
the Immigration and Customs En
forcement Agency, said the ruling
does not apply to immigrants who

agency is required by law to detain
all immigrants convicted of certain
felonies, or those considered to be
flight risks or threats to public safety
or national security, Kice said.

deportation proceedings," Srikanti
