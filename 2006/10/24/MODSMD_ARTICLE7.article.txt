# #1 THE BIG STORY
## Former Enron CEO Skilling sentenced to 24 years, 4 months 
### JUAN A. LOZANO ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
Former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling
was ordered Monday to serve 24 years
and four months in prison, the harshest
punishment by far in Enron's scandalous
collapse and one that capped a string of
tough sentences for top executives in cor
ruption cases.
U.S. District Judge Sim Lake denied
Skilling's request for bond and ordered
him to home confinement, wearing an
ankle monitor. Lake, who told the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons to recommend when
Skilling should report to prison, suggested
the 52-year-old be sent to the federal facil
ity in Butner, N.C., for his role in a case
that came to symbolize corporate fraud in
America.
"His crimes have imposed on hun
dreds if not thousands a life sentence of
poverty," Lake said.
The former chief executive officer will
be eligible to shave up to 54 days a year off
his sentence for good behavior in prison.
Lake also ordered Skilling to undergo al
cohol and mental-health counseling. A
successful completion of that treatment
would take a year off his sentence.
Skilling, insisting he was innocent yet
remorseful in a two-hour hearing, was the
last top former official to be punished for
the accounting tricks and shady business
deals that led to the loss of thousands of
jobs, more than $60 billion in Enron stock
and more than $2 billion in employee pen
sion plans after the company imploded in
2001.
His remaining assets, about $60 mil
lion. will be liquidated, according to an
agreement among lawyers for Enron em
ployees, the company's savings and stock
ownership plans, prosecutors and
Skilling's legal team.
About $45 million will be put in a resti
tution fund for victims.The remaining $15
million will go to Skilling's legal fees, said
Lynn Sark, attorney for the Enron Corp.
Savings Plan and Stock Ownership Plan.
The Justice Department allowed Skilling
to set aside $23 million for his defense
when he was indicted; he still owed his
lawyers $30 million as of Monday.
Outside the courthouse, Skilling
vowed to appeal his sentence and also
asked that his restitution money go
straight to victims, instead of being seized
first by the federal government. His attor
ney, Daniel Petrocelli, said the restitution
will be held until all of Skilling's appeals
are exhausted.
Skilling had stood with his hands
clasped below his waist, with Petrocelli at
his side while being sentenced. He gave no
visible reaction. After court adjourned,
Skilling hugged Petrocelli.
Skilling's term is the longest received
by any Enron defendant; former Chief Fi
nancial Officer Andrew Fastow was given
a six-year term after cooperating with
prosecutors and helping them secure
Skilling's conviction.
It falls just shy of the sentence imposed
on World Com CEO Bernard Ebbers, who
received 25 years for his role in the $11 bil
lion accounting fraud that toppled the
company he built from a tiny telecommu
nications firm to an industry giant. Anoth

er CEO. Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco Inter
national Ltd., received a sentence of eight
and one-third to 25 years in prison in an
other fraud case.
Skilling's co-defendant, Enron founder
Kenneth I.av, died from heart disease on
July 5. Lay's convictions on 10 counts of
fraud, conspiracy and lying to banks in two
separate cases were wiped out with his
death.
Skilling's arrogance, belligerence and
lack of contriteness under questioning
made him a lightning rod for the rage gen
erated after Enron sought bankruptcy
protection in 2001. Lay was once a leading
city father whose charitable good works
and affable nature endeared him locally.
Skilling was little known outside Enron
until his anger at being caught brought his
personality into public focus.
"Your honor, I am innocent of these
charges," Skilling told Lake Monday."l'm
innocent of every one of these charges.
"We will continue to pursue my consti
tutional rights and it's no dishonor to this
court and anyone else in this court. But I
feel very strongly about this, and I want
my friends, my family to know that."

Skilling also disputed reports that he had
no remorse for his role in the fraud that
drove the company to seek bankruptcy
protection.
"I can tell you that's just the furthest
thing from the truth,"he said. "It's been
very hard on me, but probably, more im
portant, incredibly hard on my family, in
credibly hard on employees of Enron
Corp., incredibly hard on my friends and
incredibly hard on the community.
"And I want my friends, my family to
know this."
Skilling's second wife, former Enron
corporate secretary Rebecca Carter, was
in the courtroom.
Skilling's apologetic tone didn't last
long. Outside the courtroom later, he pre
dicted he'll be vindicated on appeal.
"The word 'Enron' conjures up some
really awful things," he said." I
don't fault the judge for what he did. I be
lieve I'll be vindicated."
Skilling said he never considered striking
a deal with prosecutors because he be
lieved he had done nothing wrong.
Skilling was convicted in May on 19
counts of fraud, conspiracy, insider trading

and lying to auditors. He was acquitted on
nine counts of insider trading.
On Monday, Lake set investor loss tied
to his actions at $80 million, which he re
lied on to set the sentence. With that fig
ure, Skilling faced up to 30.4 years in
prison.
Skilling also faces more than $18 mil
lion in fines for his crimes.
Victims unleashed nearly five years of
anger on Skilling Monday and begged
Lake to send Skilling to prison for life.
"Mr. Skilling has proven to he a liar, a
thiet and a drunk. Haunting an attitude
above the law." said 22-year Enron em
ployee Dawn Powers Martin. "He has be
trayed everyone who has trusted him.
Shame on me for believing the manage
ment of Enron."
I wo chose not to vilify Skilling, however.
"I can t state strongly enough, during
20 years, have I seen or heard anything
that he was leading a massive conspiracy
to mislead Enron shareholders and em
ployees," said one of them, Sherri Sera, a
former administrative assistant, and bene
fits but took blame for her own failure to
diversify.
