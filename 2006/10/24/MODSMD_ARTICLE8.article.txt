## Editorial Board Improving career counseling 
### 
The Stanford Career Development
C enter (( DC) has done a good job in
providing counseling, information
and databases to help students decide on a
careet But. like all good things, the CDC
still has room for improvement.
A major problem of the CDC is the lim
ited varietN ot job offerings represented in
its career fairs. Consulting firms and IT
companies dominate the fair, while stu
dents with backgrounds in unrelated the
disciplines, namely the humanities, often
find their interests and expertise unrepre
sented. I or example, publications and non
profit organizations are conspicuously ab
sent and there is a lack of foreign recruiting
efforts. Also the career fair is highly geared
toward undergraduates. Hither a separate
career fair for graduate students should be
arranged or there should be conscious ef
forts to attract firms seeking advanced de
gree candidates.
I he CDC also fails to provide compre
hensive comparative tools. Information ses
sions held b\ firms are helpful overviews,
but there is no information provided for
students to compare firms across industries
(consulting vs. investment banking, for ex
ample). Information sessions should be
arranged by the CDC comparing the pros
and cons of most popular job options and
the skill sets required for them.
112 urthermore, the CDC needs to better
utilize alumni as resources.There is a list of
alumni available on the career center Web
site who have agreed to help counsel the
students, but the list is outdated (many of
the profiles haven't been updated in four or
live years). Students would benefit im
mensely if the CDC arranged more events
m which current students could interact
with alumni in person.
Many employers unwittingly list restric
tive department or degree requirements on
the CDC Web site. When specifying the de-

partments, they sometimes are not aware of
the range of programs available at Stanford
and hence may not list them. The career
center then blocks such students from ap
plying through the Web site. The CDC
should work with the employers to ensure
that the requirements listed are as broad as
possible, giving more students an opportu
nity to apply.
( urrently. many students are not aware
of the location of the CDC at 563 Salvatier
ra Walk. II the location were better adver
tised. perhaps students would be more in
clined to visit the CDC for career guidance.
Moreover. CDC' events should be held in a
more central location such as Tressider or
Cubberley.
Hie caieer center has worked diligently
to enlist potential employers, organize
workshops and set up interviews. I lowever,
by incorporating some of the above sugges
tions. the career center could become even
more valuable for students looking for in
ternships or jobs.
Realistically, however, the CDC cannot
adequately accommodate all the majors
and interests of career-bound seniors. To as
sist such students with narrower interests,
individual departments should take a
proactive role in connecting students to ca
reer opportunities. Departments should
work to keep students informed of avail
able job positions, supplementing informa
tion provided by the CDC. Moreover, in
stead of simply reiving on email lists to relay
job offerings, department Web sites should
have a career section with a list of current
job openings relevant to the field. Finally,
departments should also take steps toward
networking reaching out to firms and alum
ni to help find students a career in their
field. With the joint efforts of an improved
CDC and aggressive departments, all stu
dents can be given a broader spectrum of
opportunities for their future careers.
