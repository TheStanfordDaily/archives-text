# The 						scourge of campus safety
## 
### 
There are too many police on campus.
Policemen take an oath to put their
lives on the line, which deserves lots
of respect. But when the majority of their
time is spent catching students — students
they are supposed to he protecting — for
minor infractions, something is wrong.
Someone needs to he the asshole who
brings this up, and it may as well he this ass
hole: Our policemen spend an inordinate
amount of time catching Stanford students.
During Alumni Weekend, they were over by
Mirrielees catching kids who were riding
their bikes listening to iPods. God Bless our
Policemen. Ending the Vile Scourge of
iPods on Bicycles! (1 read somewhere that
one kid almost died from that!) They also
ticketed several alumni cars for parking in
permit zones. (Those selfish alumni stole
our staff parking spaces!) I .ast week a ('am
pus Safety truck hovered outside of EBF
driving up next to the basketball courts.
What the hell were they doing there?
Five years ago. if my alumni sources arc
to be believed, policemen did not hover
around the outskirts of parties, c|uivering
with orgasmic anticipation at the prospect
of a fight, or broken glass or, horrors of all
horrors, a loud drunken student (who got a
1600 on his SATs).There were kegs in shop
ping carts. Freshmen could throw lame par
ties and not be accused of rampant im
morality. Police were not patrolling the
Quad.
Do the police protect us? There are
weekly reports of laptop theft. Are the lap
tops ever recovered? Hie University would
say that the key to prevention is increased
police presence. What bull. The answer is
lock your laptop, close your windows, lock
your room.
Iwo of my bikes have been stolen on this
campus, both "registered." never recovered.
I haven't bothered registering the new one.
Registering is great, because it doesn't help
if you have it.but it will be bad for you if you
don t. Vou can be cited by a policeman for
riding an unregistered bike. Of course, they
were secretly hoping you were Biking
Under the Influence. Police cream in their
jeans over Bl Kits like an early ( hristmas
present, because it's worth the same as a
DUI on your quota, and all you had to do
was wave your light at some biker coming
back from a Progressive in Casa.
My freshman year, the Groper had his
merry way with hundreds of our ladies.
Never caught, despite a composite sketch
which identified him as 1 lispanic.
Campus Safety will say they prevent
things like sexual assault. By stopping stu
dents carrying beer? By pulling over a car
for driving on a Saturday night (no doubt
they've been smoking reefer)? Chris Molt
wrote a column about being pulled over by

a policeman, who suspected him of drunk
driving, marijuana possession and perhaps
even police brutality ("How not to talk to
the police." Sept. 26). If there is any colum
nist less physically threatening than me.it is
Chris I lolt.
Ihe administration, disgustingly, em
braces overregulation. I told Dean Powers
that it did not represent our campus well to
have a policeman patrol the outskirts of the
Quad (part of the new Ped Zone policy).
Everything Edenic about the center of our
campus is lost when there is a police car
grooving his way up the road, daring any
vile undergraduate to ride a bike while lis
tening to earphones (The Horrific Scourge
of Bikers Listening to iPods! I Weep for Hu
manity!)
I do not think such a policy represents us
well, certainly not to the prospective stu
dents. Why would there be a police car in the
middle of campus unless there was some
thing from which we needed defense? (Of
course, the administration believes that
what we need defense from most is our
selves.)
"I always feel much safer when I see se
curity personnel." explained Dean Powers,
in the stilted manner of a White House
spokesman, or a scientologist. Of course.
Dean Powers does not ride a bike, streak
through the Quad or take keg stands,so who
can blame her for really, really loving law
enforcement?
Just what do these security personnel do
at parties? Last week one of those trouble
making Asian sororities threw a party at
Bob. 11l ere were two police cars parked in
the Bob backyard. There were police pa
trolling outside. They broke up a casual scuf
fle between two drunk kids, both of whom
instantly apologized — which is what al
ways happens when two drunk kids scuffle.
Of course our fights aren't serious; we're
Stanford students.
Ihe cops stopped a student walking quiet
ly by himself on the sidewalk, holding a beer.
Ihey asked for his ID. Sighing, he opened his
wallet and showed them his ID. They de
manded that he take the ID out so they could
get a closer look. Sighing again, he did so.
Glory be — he was 21! Another wasted ef-


Ire and Vice

Franich
fort! But what if he hadn't been? An
underage drinker minding his own
business, throw him to the lions!
(1 was only outside for about 10
minutes, so I probably missed when
the police stopped a burglary,caught
a serial rapist, pulled over someone
who actually broke a law or did any
thing to protect the students. They
just tried to arrest them.)
1 noticed a police car in the mid
dle of my parking lot. with lights
blinking. Two police officers were
walking away from the car they just
pulled over, having failed to discover
any open containers. I asked the po
licewoman. "What's going on?" as
she closed the driver side door.
She reacted as if I'd threatened
her with a Molotov cockatil, and got
back out of her car. "Excuse me?"
she said. When cops and women say
that, it sounds threatening.
"1 live here, and 1 was just won
dering what happened."
"Why?" Is it a crime to ask ques
tions?
"I'm a concerned citizen. Was

there a crime?"
"Just patrolling. Keeping people
safe." Every word, every syllable, she
was daring me to make some sort of
move. Move along. Nothing to see
here.
I should note that I was wearing
my geeky Stanford jacket and a blue
shirt with neon yellow German
words. 1 am a skinny white boy with
unwashed hair.There has never been
a less threatening personage in the
history of post-Lapsarian man.
The police become awkward
when you question them. I think she
was embarrassed, having pulled over
another wrong car. Maybe she could
salvage the night by giving me a
Drunk in Public, and locking my
non-confrontational, unthreatening,
stuttery ass in the Drunk tank. Cam
pus police feel questions are affronts
to their power. This is because, deep
in their hearts, they know that they
are doing not very much at all.
Interestingly, the increased police
presence is hardest on grad students.
One grad posting on The Daily Web
site said that police lurk near grad
residences and hand out tickets for
such horrific crimes as No Bike
Lights and Running Stop Signs (es
pecially when there are no cars
around). One student explained.

"Grad students are treated like out
right criminals just because they're
biking! While the Stanford 'police
officers' on duty at night have a few
drinks at the 750 Pub and then rev it
up to show their muscle on Escondi
do Road." Now, 1 can understand
mistreating me and Chris Holt, be
cause we are snarky assholes, but cit
ing our beloved graduates, who only
wish to learn? When did it become so
hard to live on this campus?
What angers me is that the ad
ministration. with their holier-than
thou attitude toward the students,
hears arguments like mine and calls
us selfish, entitled pricks. All we care
about is the well-being of a universi
ty we love. Ihe current situation is
silly.This is not Newark, or Compton
or the Gaza Strip. This is a university
composed of the brightest minds in
the world, their teachers and the
people who keep the veins of their
campus pumping. Most of us are
nerds, and for some reason we're
treated like criminals. God help me,
we're becoming a police state.

There are too many police on campus.
Policemen take an oath to put their
lives on the line, which deserves lots
of respect. But when the majority of their
time is spent catching students — students
they are supposed to he protecting — for
minor infractions, something is wrong.
Someone needs to he the asshole who
brings this up, and it may as well he this ass
hole: Our policemen spend an inordinate
amount of time catching Stanford students.
During Alumni Weekend, they were over by
Mirrielees catching kids who were riding
their bikes listening to iPods. God Bless our
Policemen. Ending the Vile Scourge of
iPods on Bicycles! (1 read somewhere that
one kid almost died from that!) They also
ticketed several alumni cars for parking in
permit zones. (Those selfish alumni stole
our staff parking spaces!) I .ast week a ('am
pus Safety truck hovered outside of EBF
driving up next to the basketball courts.
What the hell were they doing there?
Five years ago. if my alumni sources arc
to be believed, policemen did not hover
around the outskirts of parties, c|uivering
with orgasmic anticipation at the prospect
of a fight, or broken glass or, horrors of all
horrors, a loud drunken student (who got a
1600 on his SATs).There were kegs in shop
ping carts. Freshmen could throw lame par
ties and not be accused of rampant im
morality. Police were not patrolling the
Quad.
Do the police protect us? There are
weekly reports of laptop theft. Are the lap
tops ever recovered? Hie University would
say that the key to prevention is increased
police presence. What bull. The answer is
lock your laptop, close your windows, lock
your room.
Iwo of my bikes have been stolen on this
campus, both "registered." never recovered.
I haven't bothered registering the new one.
Registering is great, because it doesn't help
if you have it.but it will be bad for you if you
don t. Vou can be cited by a policeman for
riding an unregistered bike. Of course, they
were secretly hoping you were Biking
Under the Influence. Police cream in their
jeans over Bl Kits like an early ( hristmas
present, because it's worth the same as a
DUI on your quota, and all you had to do
was wave your light at some biker coming
back from a Progressive in Casa.
My freshman year, the Groper had his
merry way with hundreds of our ladies.
Never caught, despite a composite sketch
which identified him as 1 lispanic.
Campus Safety will say they prevent
things like sexual assault. By stopping stu
dents carrying beer? By pulling over a car
for driving on a Saturday night (no doubt
they've been smoking reefer)? Chris Molt
wrote a column about being pulled over by

a policeman, who suspected him of drunk
driving, marijuana possession and perhaps
even police brutality ("How not to talk to
the police." Sept. 26). If there is any colum
nist less physically threatening than me.it is
Chris I lolt.
Ihe administration, disgustingly, em
braces overregulation. I told Dean Powers
that it did not represent our campus well to
have a policeman patrol the outskirts of the
Quad (part of the new Ped Zone policy).
Everything Edenic about the center of our
campus is lost when there is a police car
grooving his way up the road, daring any
vile undergraduate to ride a bike while lis
tening to earphones (The Horrific Scourge
of Bikers Listening to iPods! I Weep for Hu
manity!)
I do not think such a policy represents us
well, certainly not to the prospective stu
dents. Why would there be a police car in the
middle of campus unless there was some
thing from which we needed defense? (Of
course, the administration believes that
what we need defense from most is our
selves.)
"I always feel much safer when I see se
curity personnel." explained Dean Powers,
in the stilted manner of a White House
spokesman, or a scientologist. Of course.
Dean Powers does not ride a bike, streak
through the Quad or take keg stands,so who
can blame her for really, really loving law
enforcement?
Just what do these security personnel do
at parties? Last week one of those trouble
making Asian sororities threw a party at
Bob. 11l ere were two police cars parked in
the Bob backyard. There were police pa
trolling outside. They broke up a casual scuf
fle between two drunk kids, both of whom
instantly apologized — which is what al
ways happens when two drunk kids scuffle.
Of course our fights aren't serious; we're
Stanford students.
Ihe cops stopped a student walking quiet
ly by himself on the sidewalk, holding a beer.
Ihey asked for his ID. Sighing, he opened his
wallet and showed them his ID. They de
manded that he take the ID out so they could
get a closer look. Sighing again, he did so.

She reacted as if I'd threatened

"Why?" Is it a crime to ask ques
