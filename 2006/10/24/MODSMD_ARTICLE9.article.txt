# The
						scourge of campus safety
## 
### 
There are too many police on campus.
Policemen take an oath to put their
lives on the line, which deserves lots
of respect. But when the majority of their
time is spent catching students — students
they are supposed to he protecting — for
minor infractions, something is wrong.
Someone needs to he the asshole who
brings this up, and it may as well he this ass
hole: Our policemen spend an inordinate
amount of time catching Stanford students.
During Alumni Weekend, they were over by
Mirrielees catching kids who were riding
their bikes listening to iPods. God Bless our
Policemen. Ending the Vile Scourge of
iPods on Bicycles! (1 read somewhere that
one kid almost died from that!) They also
ticketed several alumni cars for parking in
permit zones. (Those selfish alumni stole
our staff parking spaces!) I .ast week a ('am
pus Safety truck hovered outside of EBF
driving up next to the basketball courts.
What the hell were they doing there?
Five years ago. if my alumni sources arc
to be believed, policemen did not hover
around the outskirts of parties, c|uivering
with orgasmic anticipation at the prospect
of a fight, or broken glass or, horrors of all
horrors, a loud drunken student (who got a
1600 on his SATs).There were kegs in shop
ping carts. Freshmen could throw lame par
ties and not be accused of rampant im
morality. Police were not patrolling the
Quad.
Do the police protect us? There are
weekly reports of laptop theft. Are the lap
tops ever recovered? Hie University would
say that the key to prevention is increased
police presence. What bull. The answer is
lock your laptop, close your windows, lock
your room.
Iwo of my bikes have been stolen on this
campus, both "registered." never recovered.
I haven't bothered registering the new one.
Registering is great, because it doesn't help
if you have it.but it will be bad for you if you
don t. Vou can be cited by a policeman for
riding an unregistered bike. Of course, they
were secretly hoping you were Biking
Under the Influence. Police cream in their
jeans over Bl Kits like an early ( hristmas
present, because it's worth the same as a
DUI on your quota, and all you had to do
was wave your light at some biker coming
back from a Progressive in Casa.
My freshman year, the Groper had his
merry way with hundreds of our ladies.
Never caught, despite a composite sketch
which identified him as 1 lispanic.
Campus Safety will say they prevent
things like sexual assault. By stopping stu
dents carrying beer? By pulling over a car
for driving on a Saturday night (no doubt
they've been smoking reefer)? Chris Molt
wrote a column about being pulled over by

a policeman, who suspected him of drunk
driving, marijuana possession and perhaps
even police brutality ("How not to talk to
the police." Sept. 26). If there is any colum
nist less physically threatening than me.it is
Chris I lolt.
Ihe administration, disgustingly, em
braces overregulation. I told Dean Powers
that it did not represent our campus well to
have a policeman patrol the outskirts of the
Quad (part of the new Ped Zone policy).
Everything Edenic about the center of our
campus is lost when there is a police car
grooving his way up the road, daring any
vile undergraduate to ride a bike while lis
tening to earphones (The Horrific Scourge
of Bikers Listening to iPods! I Weep for Hu
manity!)
I do not think such a policy represents us
well, certainly not to the prospective stu
dents. Why would there be a police car in the
middle of campus unless there was some
thing from which we needed defense? (Of
course, the administration believes that
what we need defense from most is our
selves.)
"I always feel much safer when I see se
curity personnel." explained Dean Powers,
in the stilted manner of a White House
spokesman, or a scientologist. Of course.
Dean Powers does not ride a bike, streak
through the Quad or take keg stands,so who
can blame her for really, really loving law
enforcement?
Just what do these security personnel do
at parties? Last week one of those trouble
making Asian sororities threw a party at
Bob. 11l ere were two police cars parked in
the Bob backyard. There were police pa
trolling outside. They broke up a casual scuf
fle between two drunk kids, both of whom
instantly apologized — which is what al
ways happens when two drunk kids scuffle.
Of course our fights aren't serious; we're
Stanford students.
Ihe cops stopped a student walking quiet
ly by himself on the sidewalk, holding a beer.
Ihey asked for his ID. Sighing, he opened his
wallet and showed them his ID. They de
manded that he take the ID out so they could
get a closer look. Sighing again, he did so.
Glory be — he was 21! Another wasted ef-
