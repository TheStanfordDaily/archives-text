### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo
encouraged students to support a new initiative
that would put prosecutors in classrooms during a
Tuesday luncheon at the Law School, which organ
izers deemed a "major policy address."
"I saw the Office of the City Attorney as an op
portunity to take on the demons that plagued my
community and to make a difference in people's
lives," he said.
Since Delgadillo took office in July 2001. he
said the number of gang members in Los Angeles
has shrunk from approximately 57.000 to 39,000.
He attributed the decline, in part, to his Neigh
borhood Prosecutor Program, which encourages
city prosecutors to get involved in the lives of local
residents.The idea is for them to protect the com
munities they serve. Delgadillo also highlighted
his work to reduce truancy via prevention pro
grams such as Operation Bright Future, which
teaches parents about their legal responsibility to
keep their children in school.
Through his speech to a packed classroom, Del

gadillo encouraged Stanford students, especially
Law School students, to help him combat gang vi
olence after they graduate.
Delgadillo highlighted a new initiative, which
he hopes to launch soon, that will be modeled after
the Neighborhood Prosecutor Program. It will as
sign prosecutors to Los Angeles schools in an ef
fort to improve safety.
"Practice law with a sense of community, a
sense ol obligation," he said. "You have the train
ing. the skills and the opportunity to open doors
and level playing fields for the people around you.
What better profession to aid humanity and seize
control of our destiny, to lead this global commu
nity into a brighter future?"
Delgadillo lost with 26 percent of the vote to
Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown in the Democratic
primary for (California Attorney General this year.
He was introduced by a Stanford alumnus ai. 1
fellow loser in the Democratic primary. State Con
troller Steve Westly. Westly praised Delgadillo for
tackling truancy and gang problems in Los Ange
les head-on.
"Rocky Delgadillo is one of the good guys in
public service and is setting the standard for good
public policy in California," Westly said.
After explaining that Westly has greatly in
spired him. Delgadillo proceeded to describe the
career path that led him to pursue public interest
work in Los Angeles.
The event was hosted by the Law School, the

Graduate School of Business, Stanford Law and
Policy Society. Stanford I atino Law Student Asso
ciation, Street Law, Stanford Public Interest Law
Students Association and the Center for Public
Service and Public Interest Law.
Several students felt that Delgadillo captured
the audience with his recollections of gang vio
lence in Los Angeles and his approach that em
braces the power of communal concern.
"Unlike a lot of risk-averse politicians. Rocky
Delgadillo is willing to confront the serious issue of
gangs, which not only plagues Los Angeles, but per
meates our society," said second-year law student
Sierra Martinez, who serves on the executive board
of the Stanford I -atino I aw Student Association. "I
was impressed with his innovative solutions to tack
ling crime. Or rather, preventing crime. People
often forget that prosecution is only part of the so
lution. reaction without prevention is insufficient."
Second-year law and business school student
Alberta Tovar believes that Delgadillo demon
strates that "true leadership extends beyond the
confines of a job description."
"Rocky could have approached his job duties
myopically. paying attention solely on the typical
issues that many city attorneys focus," Tovar said.
"Rather. Rockv's approach is that he was elected
to lead the city on issues that are important to
everyone, and focus those efforts through the re
sources and responsibilities of the City Attorney's
Office."
