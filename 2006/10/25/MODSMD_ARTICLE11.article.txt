## Editorial Board Tobacco-funded research raises questions 
### 
On September 20. the University of
California's board of regents dis
cussed Lt. Governor Cruz Busta
mante's proposal that funding from tobac
co companies should no longer be accepted
for research. Although they admitted such
funding comprises an "extremely small por
tion" of overall research grants. Busta
mante and other proponents argued that
accepting such money undercuts the credi
bility of the University and its research.
The discussion was prompted by an Au
gust 17 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge
Gladys Kessler. which held that tobacco
companies are guilty of racketeering
charges for intentionally and fraudulently
misleading the public about the effects of
tobacco. Kessler wrote that companies
"marketed and sold their lethal products
with zeal, with deception, with a single
minded focus on their financial success and
without regard for the human tragedy or so
cial costs that success exacted."
Having already applauded the Medical
School's decision to cut off pharmaceutical
lobbying via seemingly trivial handouts, we
feel that the influence of grants by tobacco
companies is also worth examining.
Just as pharmaceutical salesmen do not
distribute pens promoting Xanex without
certain expected results, it is unlikely that
the tobacco industry would sponsor re
search with entirely innocent and altruistic
motives.
Still, the issue is more complicated than
free lunches. If we begin to limit research
grants based on the source of money rather
than how it is used, where do we stop? I ur
thermore, the UC' Academic Senate con
cluded in an October 11 meeting on the

topic, limiting grants could have a deleteri
ous effect on academic freedom. As a result,
thev made a formal recommendation to the
regents against the proposed restrictions.
We agree. Research must not be con
demned based on its source of funding. In
stead. the legitimacy of the research must
lie in the credibility of the data. If results
are significantly out of sync with the scien
tific community and cannot be replicated,
this is a much more telling sign of compro
mised research than the origin of the grant
money.
While it is still useful to keep in mind
what companies may try to achieve with
their contributions, the importance of aca
demic freedom to select and fund projects
with minimal bureaucratic interference.
Stanford's Public Affairs Office was only
aware of one current project involving any
tobacco-related funding and described such
funding as "rare."
We believe that both Judge Kessler's
condemnation of the tobacco industry and
the spirit of Bustamante's proposal to the
UC regents were spot-on. And it is impor
tant for our university to take morality into
its decisions, not through partisan political
positions, but rather avoiding complicity in
unethical behavior, in order to set an exam
ple for students and. indeed, the entire aca
demic community.
But because tobacco industry grants are
not a significant source of funding, because
Stanford has its own strict policies regard
ing academic and research standards and
because we trust our faculty's serious com
mitment to objectivity, we do not believe a
top-down ban on tobacco company money
is necessary.
