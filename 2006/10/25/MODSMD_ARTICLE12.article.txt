# Mixology 101
## 
### 
Making drinks is easy. All you have to
do is look cool while you pour stuff
into a cup. Then, if people say it
tastes bad, ask if it's too strong for them.
Nah. man. it's g00d...
Or. you could make a drink that actually
tastes good. Iliis boils down to combining
ingredients in the right proportions and. in
some cases, the right order. Pretty simple:
either look up a good recipe online, or taste
and adjust until you have something that
does it for you.
Easy as that sounds, I still have tasted a
lot of bad (and 1 mean really, strikingly
nasty) drinks at progressives. The progres
sive. for the uninitiated, is a party in which
you "progress" from room to room within a
dorm, trying different drinks, until you wake
up in a jail cell next to a guy named T-Bone.
Winning your progressive is one of the best
reasons to learn to mix drinks
I'd recommend against choosing drinks
like the mojito or old-fashioned that re
quire a lot of individual prep work. You
want to be mingling and trying other peo
ple's drinks, not crushing mint leaves for
every mooch that wanders into your hall.
The rule of thumb is that you should be
able to make your progressive drink in a
pitcher.
As far as finding recipes goes, there are
about a million roughly equivalent websites

for this, though www.wchtcnder.com has a
particularly useful "in my bar" feature that
allows you to search for drink recipes based
on the ingredients you have at hand.
I"his week's recipe is for simple syrup. Es
sentially sugar water, it's supremely useful
for mixing drinks, because whereas granu
lated sugar will sink to the bottom of the
glass, the syrup will mix right in. It also lends
itself to unlimited variations that are as
good for homemade sodas as they are for
cocktails.
The easiest way to use the syrup is to
pour it into plastic squirt bottles, which are
available at Draegger's Market in Menlo
Park: or. you could just take the ketchup
bottle from your dining hall and wash it out.
But you didn't hear it from me. Simply
spooning it out of a bowl would work fine,
too.

Simple Syrup
I cup sugar
1 cup water
Boil the water in a saucepan or water
boiler, whichever you have. Add the
sugar and stir until it's completely
dissolved. (Don't allow the mixture
to brown â€” you're not making
caramel.) Allow to cool and store in

the refrigerator, where it should keep
forever.
Variations: Add half a cup of fresh
berries, mint leaves, sliced ginger or
anything else you can think of (I
tried celery once; it wasn't bad)
along with the water. ()nee you've let
the whole mixture cool completely,
run it in the blender until smooth,
then pour through a fine-mesh
strainer.This will be somewhat more
perishable than straight simple
syrup, but should still keep up to ;i
week in the refrigerator. To make
soda, combine the syrup to taste in a
ylass with carbonated water and ice.

Vodka Lemonade
1 cup lemon juice
1 cup sugar
(i cups club soda
2 cups vodka
Make simple syrup like above, but
with lemon juice in place of water.
Combine the syrup, vodka, and club
soda in a pitcher. Serve in red cups
over ice.

Mate Solon once had to explain what
a progressive is in Spanish I Hope
fully your e-mail to nsolon&stan
fonl.edu w ill be more coherent.
