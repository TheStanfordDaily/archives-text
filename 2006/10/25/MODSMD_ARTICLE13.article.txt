# A 						look at a LARP

I had heard about it. I had laughed at it.
Now it was time to infiltrate. And so he
gins my jaunt into Live-Action Role-
Playing. better known as LARPing.
Of recent You lube fame, LARPing has
grown in popularity ever since its concep
iion during the late 1970'5. Morn out of his
torical battle reenactments. table-top role
playing games, in particular "Dungeon and
Dragons", and a love of departing from this
teality, LARPing is where a group of people
assume pre-determined characters and are
guided through an outlined set of scenarios.
My friend said he had seen a bunch of guys
in cloaks galloping around the Quad at mid
night a week ago on a LARP — 1 had to see
what it was all about.
After checking out Stanford Gaming So
ciety's extensive, easily negotiable and
rather-fittingly-well-put-together website. I
e-mailed the LARPing organizer to see if I
could join the next cloak-wearing Quad
venture. Luckily, the next LARP was sched
uled for I riday and was intended for begin
ners, so I signed myself up.
The next day, I opened my e-mail to dis
cover this descriptive gem of a blurb reca
pitulating the setting of the LARP: "In a fu
ture corrupted by the technological aspira
tions of powerful corporations, the battle
for primacy is coming to a head.There is an
'invisible war' between the government and
corporations, so named for the assassina
tions, political nianeuverings and backroom
dealings that are its weapons of choice." Fri
day seemed like it would never come.

On ITiursday, I received my detailed
character sheet, which not only disclosed
my actual name, secret relationships to
other players, appropriate dress code and
general backstory. but also provided me
with a list of my special skills and combat
abilities. In this self-described "cyber punk"
world 1 was to be Acid Burn, a young Har
vard student who had recently joined an
elite hacking group called the 'Data Angels.
I had a crush on a fellow Angel, an es
tranged police chief as my father and some
handy hacking abilities. As for battling, I
had mace, a mean kick, two small vials of
acid and a streaming flame-thrower which,
when used, was an attempted death attack.
Some mace and a love interest. What more
could a girl want?
When The Day finally rolled around, I
dressed, per instruction, as a Harvard prep
ster, printed out my character sheet and ea
gerly biked my way across campus.

which is where they LARP on a biweekly

hasis — my cars were met with an en
thusiastic buzz. About 20 co-
LARPers were already assembled
and waiting to begin. A couple players
introduced themselves explained
some ot the basics to role-playing to
me. It is not a competitive game with a
crowned winner, but more of a the
atrical improvisation where charac
ters interact with one other and react
to situations that arise in each invent
ed setting. Because the players are es
sentially performing a sort of im
promptu sci-fi drama, it is expected
that everyone remains "in character,"
or IC, unless it is necessary to momen
tarily step "out of character." OOC,
which you would use, for example, to
declare an entrance into stealth mode.
Standard I.ARPing procedures re
quire players to cross their fingers
while they are (X)C to clearly inform
others of their changed game status.
Once I had heard the basics, I met
with the Game Masters, or CiMs.
Iliey create the plot and characters
and do not I.ARP themselves, but
rather facilitate the role play by de
scribing settings, creating puzzles,
monitoring combats and ruling on
any questions that arise during the

night. After a debriefing on my char
acter. the combat card system and
the risks of implanting "biomods,"
using "energies" and taking "dam
ages," I was vaguely ready to start
role-playing.
I was put into a subway tunnel with
my fellow Data Angel, where we ran
into members of the Umbrella Corpo
ration who were looking for a lost
briefcase. It would soon become ap
parent that everyone, corporations,
government and secret societies alike,
were searching for this same bag. Both
my intended love interest. Crash
Override, and I landed jobs with Um
brella. and proceeded to help them in
their current investigation of"lost cor
porate data." With a GM bounding in
front of us to explain the set-up of
each new room we entered, our group
broke into sewer systems, found
rooms of fire and attacked a robot tur
tle. We were sent on a rescue mission,
discovered the central underground
room, stumbled upon the briefcase,
fought other corporations for it and
then chased the player who success
fully ran away with it.
I had arrived at 7:00 pm, and it
was now nearing midnight.The game
had finally drawn to a close, and we
sat down for an Epilogue to discuss
the ending, reveal our characters and
share some of our favorite moments.
Family members had become es
tranged, lives had been lost, loyalties

rerouted and the briefcase taken. We
laughed when a GM finally disclosed
that after these events unfolded, the
US government and all of the power
house corporations had joined
forces to try to take over the world
— everyone's actions had been un
fortunately inconsequential.
1 met some interesting folk that
night. I couldn't help but take note ot
the black nail polish, long braided
pig tails, abundance of man pony
tails. walking staffs, goggles, sweat
pants and plastic swords. Last Friday,
however. 1 also met a group of peo
ple who were creative and imagina
tive. who spent their free time forg
ing a detailed world into which their
fellow LARPers could get lost, and
who welcomed me and all the other
newcomers with open arms.
An admittedly bizarre assem
blage of a dinner murder mystery, an
overzealousness for the Matrix, and
improvisational theater, LARPing
proved itself a fascinating niche on
Stanford's campus. Over Spring
Break, about 25 members of the club
stay for a week long Epic LARP,
where they entertain more complex
and nuanced characters, clues and
story lines. I can't help but say that it
sounds a little intriguing.

Spring Break plans, e-mail Katie Tay

— everyone's actions had been un
fortunately inconsequential.
1 met some interesting folk that
night. I couldn't help but take note ot
the black nail polish, long braided
pig tails, abundance of man pony
tails. walking staffs, goggles, sweat
pants and plastic swords. Last Friday,
however. 1 also met a group of peo
ple who were creative and imagina
tive. who spent their free time forg
ing a detailed world into which their
fellow LARPers could get lost, and
who welcomed me and all the other
newcomers with open arms.
An admittedly bizarre assem
blage of a dinner murder mystery, an
overzealousness for the Matrix, and
improvisational theater, LARPing
proved itself a fascinating niche on
Stanford's campus. Over Spring
Break, about 25 members of the club
stay for a week long Epic LARP,
where they entertain more complex
and nuanced characters, clues and
story lines. I can't help but say that it
sounds a little intriguing.

I had heard about it. I had laughed at it.
Now it was time to infiltrate. And so he
gins my jaunt into Live-Action Role-
Playing. better known as LARPing.
Of recent You lube fame, LARPing has
grown in popularity ever since its concep
iion during the late 1970'5. Morn out of his
torical battle reenactments. table-top role
playing games, in particular "Dungeon and
Dragons", and a love of departing from this
teality, LARPing is where a group of people
assume pre-determined characters and are
guided through an outlined set of scenarios.
My friend said he had seen a bunch of guys
in cloaks galloping around the Quad at mid
night a week ago on a LARP — 1 had to see
what it was all about.
After checking out Stanford Gaming So
ciety's extensive, easily negotiable and
rather-fittingly-well-put-together website. I
e-mailed the LARPing organizer to see if I
could join the next cloak-wearing Quad
venture. Luckily, the next LARP was sched
uled for I riday and was intended for begin
ners, so I signed myself up.
The next day, I opened my e-mail to dis
cover this descriptive gem of a blurb reca
pitulating the setting of the LARP: "In a fu
ture corrupted by the technological aspira
tions of powerful corporations, the battle
for primacy is coming to a head.There is an
'invisible war' between the government and
corporations, so named for the assassina
tions, political nianeuverings and backroom
dealings that are its weapons of choice." Fri
day seemed like it would never come.

On ITiursday, I received my detailed
character sheet, which not only disclosed
my actual name, secret relationships to
other players, appropriate dress code and
general backstory. but also provided me
with a list of my special skills and combat
abilities. In this self-described "cyber punk"
world 1 was to be Acid Burn, a young Har
vard student who had recently joined an
elite hacking group called the 'Data Angels.
I had a crush on a fellow Angel, an es
tranged police chief as my father and some
handy hacking abilities. As for battling, I
had mace, a mean kick, two small vials of
acid and a streaming flame-thrower which,
when used, was an attempted death attack.
Some mace and a love interest. What more
could a girl want?
When The Day finally rolled around, I
dressed, per instruction, as a Harvard prep
ster, printed out my character sheet and ea
gerly biked my way across campus.

which is where they LARP on a biweekly

hasis — my cars were met with an en
thusiastic buzz. About 20 co-
LARPers were already assembled
and waiting to begin. A couple players
introduced themselves explained
some ot the basics to role-playing to
me. It is not a competitive game with a
crowned winner, but more of a the
atrical improvisation where charac
ters interact with one other and react
to situations that arise in each invent
ed setting. Because the players are es
sentially performing a sort of im
promptu sci-fi drama, it is expected
that everyone remains "in character,"
or IC, unless it is necessary to momen
tarily step "out of character." OOC,
which you would use, for example, to
declare an entrance into stealth mode.
Standard I.ARPing procedures re
quire players to cross their fingers
while they are (X)C to clearly inform
others of their changed game status.
Once I had heard the basics, I met
with the Game Masters, or CiMs.
Iliey create the plot and characters
and do not I.ARP themselves, but
rather facilitate the role play by de
scribing settings, creating puzzles,
monitoring combats and ruling on
any questions that arise during the

night. After a debriefing on my char
acter. the combat card system and
the risks of implanting "biomods,"
using "energies" and taking "dam
ages," I was vaguely ready to start
role-playing.
I was put into a subway tunnel with
my fellow Data Angel, where we ran
into members of the Umbrella Corpo
ration who were looking for a lost
briefcase. It would soon become ap
parent that everyone, corporations,
government and secret societies alike,
were searching for this same bag. Both
my intended love interest. Crash
Override, and I landed jobs with Um
brella. and proceeded to help them in
their current investigation of"lost cor
porate data." With a GM bounding in
front of us to explain the set-up of
each new room we entered, our group
broke into sewer systems, found
rooms of fire and attacked a robot tur
tle. We were sent on a rescue mission,
discovered the central underground
room, stumbled upon the briefcase,
fought other corporations for it and
then chased the player who success
fully ran away with it.
I had arrived at 7:00 pm, and it
was now nearing midnight.The game
had finally drawn to a close, and we
sat down for an Epilogue to discuss
the ending, reveal our characters and
share some of our favorite moments.
Family members had become es
tranged, lives had been lost, loyalties

rerouted and the briefcase taken. We
laughed when a GM finally disclosed
that after these events unfolded, the
US government and all of the power
house corporations had joined
forces to try to take over the world
— everyone's actions had been un
fortunately inconsequential.
