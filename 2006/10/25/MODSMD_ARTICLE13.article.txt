						look at a LARP

I had heard about it. I had laughed at it.
Now it was time to infiltrate. And so he
gins my jaunt into Live-Action Role-
Playing. better known as LARPing.
Of recent You lube fame, LARPing has
grown in popularity ever since its concep
iion during the late 1970'5. Morn out of his
torical battle reenactments. table-top role
playing games, in particular "Dungeon and
Dragons", and a love of departing from this
teality, LARPing is where a group of people
assume pre-determined characters and are
guided through an outlined set of scenarios.
My friend said he had seen a bunch of guys
in cloaks galloping around the Quad at mid
night a week ago on a LARP â€” 1 had to see
what it was all about.
After checking out Stanford Gaming So
ciety's extensive, easily negotiable and
rather-fittingly-well-put-together website. I
e-mailed the LARPing organizer to see if I
could join the next cloak-wearing Quad
venture. Luckily, the next LARP was sched
uled for I riday and was intended for begin
ners, so I signed myself up.
The next day, I opened my e-mail to dis
cover this descriptive gem of a blurb reca
pitulating the setting of the LARP: "In a fu
ture corrupted by the technological aspira
tions of powerful corporations, the battle
for primacy is coming to a head.There is an
'invisible war' between the government and
corporations, so named for the assassina
tions, political nianeuverings and backroom
dealings that are its weapons of choice." Fri
day seemed like it would never come.

On ITiursday, I received my detailed
character sheet, which not only disclosed
my actual name, secret relationships to
other players, appropriate dress code and
general backstory. but also provided me
with a list of my special skills and combat
abilities. In this self-described "cyber punk"
world 1 was to be Acid Burn, a young Har
vard student who had recently joined an
elite hacking group called the 'Data Angels.
I had a crush on a fellow Angel, an es
tranged police chief as my father and some
handy hacking abilities. As for battling, I
had mace, a mean kick, two small vials of
acid and a streaming flame-thrower which,
when used, was an attempted death attack.
Some mace and a love interest. What more
could a girl want?
When The Day finally rolled around, I
dressed, per instruction, as a Harvard prep
ster, printed out my character sheet and ea
gerly biked my way across campus.
As I walked into the spacious Lag lounge
which is where they LARP on a biweekly
