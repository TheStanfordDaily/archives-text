# Co-ed naked sex column
## 
### 
There is no sex in the stacks. Oh, there
are books in the stacks. But you don't
want books. You want sex. So why are
you in the stacks?
Because your local sex columnist told you
there was sex there. Your college's sex colum
nist makes it seem like your local college is a
hotbed of experimental, hip. exotic happen
ings. They paint a lavish picture filled with
satin and sexiles, secret forays and sensual
encounters with TAs.To live in their world is
to live where every conversation is a come
on, where around every corner is a love nest,
where every co-ed has been replaced by a se
cret army of frisky Jessica Alba clones.
All of it is made up.
The reason that every sex columnist
sounds like every other sex columnist is be
cause they all copy each other. It's a big liter
ary circle jerk of sorts. Sex columnists assume
their college is as much of an orgy as the col
lege of the next sex columnist. It's like look
ing over the shoulder of a classmate during a
test. A classmate who happens to be a prolif
ic nymphomaniac. Right. So, while sex
columnists find no evidence of an active sex

life on their campuses, instead of reporting
that nothing is going on. they choose to em
bellish things. It's not yellow journalism; it's
sticky and off-white colored.
Your first tip off should have been how
writers at the Citadel and Colorado School of
Mines were writing the same columns about
how to procure threesomes as columnists at
Delaware State and Syracuse. None of these
schools have this kind of action. Only in Cal
State Malibu does this go down.
Cal State Malibu is actually nothing but
sex — I should know, I took classes there last
spring. Every sport is co-ed naked, which isn't
as much fun as it sounds. Sure wrestling is fun

to watch, but it's tough being the only co-ed
naked football team in the SEC. Don't even
get me started on co-ed naked golf.
The students have difficulty studying be
cause the light gets reflected off the platinum
blondes and the chiseled chests. There is so
much sex that their spring semester appears
on "MTV Spring Break." "Girls Gone Wild"
is actually just a sociology lecture series gone
terribly awry. Those aren't college students
vacationing, that's higher education.
Cal State Malibu is what 1 would call a
progressive campus, in that all classes are
filmed so they can be viewed later if you were
hung over or having too much sex to see the
instruction.There's a guy in a tweed jacket in
structing kids about Shakespeare in the
background of these videos. Shall I compare
thee to a midsummer's bong? 1 think "Profs
Gone Wild" is filming in May, the DVD due
out a week later.
But back to the topic of sex columnists
lying; did you ever wonder where the e-mails
come from that every week they reply to? Do

people actually write in with their
problems to this so called "expert"?
Why does everyone adhere to the
same code of anonymity based on al
literations of your location and your
problem? Lonely in Lagos, Jaded in

questions they know the answers to.

thing they can handle. If thev actual

would be notably more awkward.
"So. um, do most sex columnists
have to wear a wrestler's mask to
get an erection?"
This brings up the importance ol
the pen-name. You don't want peo
ple to actually know who you are.
Dear Abby is the penname of some
old lady, obviously. Roxy Sass is the
penname of former provost Con
doleeza Rice. Kind ol explains a lot.
doesn't it? Even Chris I lolt is a pen
name for who I really am. an unfor
giving man who is going to beat I )ar
ren Franich like a red-headed
singing orphan.

You need something that sounds
vaguely sexual. Booty McSexbomb.
Dirk Donkeypunch. Sassy Hern
stein. You get the idea. Your real
name should not be attached to your
sex column or else you will actually
be asked for advice. 'ITien. the entire
charade will come crashing down
and no amount of smoke or mirrors
can hide the fact that you.you the sex
columnist, have never, ever, been to
C'al State Malibu — and therefore
have no idea what the hell you're
doing.
