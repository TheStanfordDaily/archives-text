More Criticism of Webmail
Your editorial on campus e-mail and
ITSS ("Has ITSS gotten the Message") re
minded me of a small beef I've had with
Web Login and Webmail since 1 was a fresh
man. Everyone's familiar with the scenario:
you type in your SUNet ID,your password,
hit enter, and then, rather than be directed
right to your content, you are forced to click
on another link on some confirmation page
in order to access that content. There does
n't seem to be a good reason for this confir
mation page to be there every time you at
tempt to log in, and though the individual in
convenience is small and we're already used
to being inconvenienced constantly by our
interfaces, the delay adds up over time. A
simple GOMS analysis (used to measure in
terface efficiency, see Wikipedia or Jef
Raskin's book,"The Humane Interface") il
lustrates that this extra step requires (1)
mental preparation. (2) movement of a
hand from the keyboard to the mouse, (3)
positioning of the cursor on the link, and (4)
clicking the link, which represents an aver
age of 1.35 seconds, .4 seconds, 1.1 seconds,
and .2 seconds of delay, respectively, for a
total average delay of 3.05 seconds per
login. If we assume that every student and
faculty member logs on through Web Login
twice a day for three 10-week quarters, and
with 14,881 students and 1,771 faculty (ac

cording to the Registrar), we're talking
about a total Stanford delay of roughly
5,925 hours per year. That is a lot of wasted
time, and if you consider the fact that Web
mail has its own confirmation page, requir
ing yet another 3-second delay, you're look
ing at even more inefficiency for those stuck
using it. Because we're all forced to use
Web Login to access certain content, ITSS
should take care to eliminate as many inef
ficiencies as possible — including interface
inefficiencies.

A closer look at Hezbollah
According to Rami Khouri, American
media has been biased against Hezbollah in
the recent conflict in the Middle East. I hear
this phrase thrown around a lot, so let's ex
amine what could possibly have led to such a
bias:
Hezbollah is financed and armed by Iran
and enjoys full support from Syria. It has a
long history of terrorist attacks; to cite a few:
1974 Hezbollah terrorists infiltrated an Is
raeli town of Kiryat Shmonah and killed 16
civilians, mainly women and children. The
following month, they attacked a school in
Maalot and killed 20 teenagers in cold blood.
They have hijacked planes, taken hostages.

and murdered indiscriminately, in pursuance
of their Hezbollah goals, as stated by Sheik
Ibrahim al-Amin in 1985: the eradication of
Western imperialism in Lebanon, the trans
formation of Lebanon's multi-confessional
state into an Islamic state, and the complete
destruction of the state of Israel. Anyone
feeling biased yet? In the most recent con
flict Hezbollah went across the border of a
sovereign nation unprovoked, killing a num
ber of soldiers and kidnapped two. During
the conflict it proceeded to bombard strictly
civilian targets with Katusha rockets, killing
a number of children (including Arab chil
dren). More than that: Hezbollah has posi
tioned its rocket launchers in schoolyards,on
hospital roofs, and other civilian areas in
Lebanon, knowing that Israelis' hands will
be tied since they, unlike terrorists, do every
thing possible to avoid killing civilians. Imag
ine I'S, or any other country, in the place of
Israel for a second: you have a cross border
raid, soldiers taken hostage, and civilian
areas bombarded. Think about it; check out
the Hezbollah history and timeline of at
tacks online, and then see if the statement
that "Hezbollah has been painted with too
broad a brush as a terrorist group and as
signed too much blame for sparking the con
flict" still rings true.
