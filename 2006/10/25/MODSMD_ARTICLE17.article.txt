## Guharay Steroids Double Standard 
### 
Every year, there is a time dur
ing which the excitement of a
new NFL season and the
drama of the close of MLB coincide.
This year, especially in light of recent
events in both leagues, I couldn't
help noticing some of the immensely
different attitudes of sports fans to
ward baseball and football.
Perhaps the most striking con
trast lies in our judgment of cheating,
moral standards and steroid policy in
the two sports. Over the past decade
or so, baseball has unwillingly ac
quired an image of rampant steroid
use and a general sense of lost sports
manship. The examples are endless.
Rafael Palmeiro, a long-beloved
first basemen for the Texas Rangers
and Baltimore Orioles, was found
with steroids in his system at the twi
light of his career.The result? A slug
ger with over 3000 career hits and
500 home runs will most likely be left
out of the I lall of Fame and remem
bered forever as a cheater and a liar.
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
captivated a nation for an entire
baseball season, trading home runs
until each had shattered Roger
Maris' single-season home run
record. But McGwire too has been
the subject of steroid rumors.
And then there's Barry Bonds,
the career all-star whose life has
been altered forever by the media
and its steroid accusations.
TTiis. of course, is in no way meant
to be a defense of these players. But
take a look at the contrast between
the marred careers of these sluggers
and the recent story of NFL defen
sive star Shawne Merriman.
Merriman, the reigning Defen
sive Rookie of the Year, tested posi
tive for the steroid nandrolone. At
lanta Falcons guard Matt Lehr and
Detroit Lions tackle Shaun Rogers
also tested positive for the drug.
Merriman contends that the nan
drolone was present in his system be
cause he had taken a supplement
that he thought to be safe. Regard
less of the truth, if Merriman cannot
clear his name in the appeal process,
he will face a four-game suspension.
The suspension itself.albeit a light
sentence, is not surprising. Rather,
it's the fact that on every sports talk
show on the radio and on television,
the Merriman story has found itself
in the shadows of Kenny Rogers'
horrific Dirtgate scandal â€” Rogers
supposedly used pine tar to grip a
