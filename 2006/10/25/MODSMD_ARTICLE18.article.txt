# Through My Eyes:
## Galen Thompson 
### BY HALEY MURPHY 
In this week's installment of "Through My
Eyes,"The Daily met Galen Thompson of
men's soccer.
With two of his fellow seniors — Michael Brown and Andrew Kartunen
— injured, Thompson has rallied to score three times this season, including
goals in each of Stanford's road wins against the University of Washington
and Oregon State. Thompson also registered two of his squad-leading four
assists in those matches, earning the Cardinal's first Pac-10 Player of the
Week honor this season.
Thompson, a Colorado native, will help to lead the Cardinal in their final
conference matches against UC LA, San Diego State and C alifornia.

All Blacks rugby team does before games. I think that would definitely
throw other teams off.
New Additions
The freshmen have done a great job of immediately stepping into important
roles on the team. We asked a lot of them right from the start and gave them
a lot of responsibility, and they have taken everything and done really well.
The freshmen, and the program as a whole, are learning what it takes to be
nationally competitive. The trials we have already overcome this season
