# Through My Eyes:
## Galen Thompson 
### BY HALEY MURPHY 
In this week's installment of "Through My
Eyes,"The Daily met Galen Thompson of
men's soccer.
With two of his fellow seniors — Michael Brown and Andrew Kartunen
— injured, Thompson has rallied to score three times this season, including
goals in each of Stanford's road wins against the University of Washington
and Oregon State. Thompson also registered two of his squad-leading four
assists in those matches, earning the Cardinal's first Pac-10 Player of the
Week honor this season.
Thompson, a Colorado native, will help to lead the Cardinal in their final
conference matches against UC LA, San Diego State and C alifornia.
'Ham 1 diversity
This year the team has a lot of variety in terms of personalities and playing
styles. We have a great team dynamic because guys tend to come at things
from very different angles. Sometimes that breeds a bit of conflict, but on
the whole we get along really well. We have held together through some re
ally good times and some really tough times already this season.
Prc-(iame Preparation
Some people have little rituals before games; I like to juggle tennis balls.
[The team has no big traditions] yet. although we are thinking about getting
Mark [Bartlett] to teach us the haka, [a Maori dance] that the New Zealand
All Blacks rugby team does before games. I think that would definitely
throw other teams off.
New Additions
The freshmen have done a great job of immediately stepping into important
roles on the team. We asked a lot of them right from the start and gave them
a lot of responsibility, and they have taken everything and done really well.
The freshmen, and the program as a whole, are learning what it takes to be
nationally competitive. The trials we have already overcome this season
have made us strong for this final
push of the regular season, the post
season and seasons to come.
Team Influences
My roles as a senior and leader have
been easy. We have a great group of
leaders on our team with the cap
tains leading the way. Other seniors
and underclassmen get involved, but
in general we are a team that [sets
goals) and goes after [them].
Great Expectations
This team will be successful this sea
son; we are growing improving and
working to prove that Stanford de
serves national recognition for our
soccer program. As a team, we let
ourselves — and each other —
down in the loss to Cal on Friday. But
we have addressed it.and already
everyone has come out determined
to finish strong and win our next
three games. We will win this week
end. we will make the tournament
and we will make a strong showing in
the NCAA tournament. We are as
good as anybody that we have
played this year, and we have shown
that we can play well enough to beat
any opponent. Now that we are
backed into a wall a bit, 1 expect
everyone to come out swinging.
FAN-tastic Moment
The greatest game of my career
would have to be the win over San
Diego State at home this year. We

needed a win to start the Pac-10
schedule and everybody came out
with fire, [allowing us to] beat a good
team. Not to mention the fact that
there were almost 2,000 people
there, [including a rowdy] student
section led by the Upper 90. We have
awesome fans, and it was great to get
a big win the first weekend that we
had fans on campus.
Individual Success
Individual honors are nice, but you
only get individual honors when the
team is doing well. [The Pac-10 Play
er of the Week) award was the result
of a great weekend of play for the
whole team, and it felt great that it
was recognized in the form of an
award. But more important than the
award were the two wins we got at
Oregon State and Washington. In a
conference as strong as the Pac-10, it
is always cool to be recognized: I ex
pect to see more Stanford players
grabbing awards as we play better
and better.
Moving On
My plans for next year are pretty up
in the air at this point. 1 am graduat
ing in December, and 1 hope to find
a place to continue my soccer career.
I don't know where I will be and I re
ally don't care that much. 1 just want
to keep playing. It will be tough to
leave Stanford: I really can't imagine
a better place with better people. 1
have had so much fun here, but I am
ready for the next challenge and I
am excited to go after the dream of
professional soccer. The program
and the guys are like my family at
Stanford and that will be hard to
leave.

and the guys are like my family at
Stanford and that will be hard to
leave.
