## Farm will fill dining halls with produce Community Farm aims to provide Stanford Dining with organic food 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to a new student-run Community Farm, which is
dedicated to providing organic produce to dining halls around
campus, Stanford's popular moniker "The Farm" will finally
hold true.
Located near Stock Farm Road in West Campus, the one
acre patch includes a fruit orchard, herb garden and a number
of individual plots maintained by Stanford students, faculty
and staff. Project organizers hope to contribute produce to
Stanford Dining by January 2007.
"The project aims to establish a connection between stu
dents and their food by growing food on campus for residen
tial dining halls and promoting sustainable agriculture among
students and staff," said Emmett Hopkins, director of the
Farm and sustainable foods coordinator for Stanford.
The project looks to eventually provide Stanford's 17 din
ing facilities with produce that they otherwise could not ob
tain due to price or availability.
"The Community Farm will assist Stanford Dining in pur
chasing more of its food locally, thereby becoming more sus
tainable," Hopkins said. "As backyard gardeners know, the fla
vor and freshness of a just-harvested vegetable is unparal
leled."
In addition to growing fruits and vegetables for Stanford
Dining, organizers of the Farm intend to use the space as an
educational outlet. A class on sustainable agriculture will be
offered in the spring, which will give students hands on expe
rience on the plot.
"A few classes at Stanford address these subjects on a glob
al scale," said senior Erin Gaines, one of the eight student gar-
den managers, "but none of them
focus on issues that are more directly
relevant to Stanford like the status of
family farms nearby, what is grown
seasonally in our area or how we can
make an impact as consumers. We
hope to provide this more tangible
link to the Stanford community."
The space that houses the new
farm has existed for nearly a decade,
but only in the last six months has it
started to take shape into what it is
today.
The project began in the spring of
2005 with the creation of "education
al gardens." Located at each major
dining hall on campus, the gardens
have been used to grow herbs and
other products in small quantities.
While limited in their size and capac
ity, the gardens have received posi
tive support from both the student
body and Stanford Dining.
"The gardens have been produc
ing now for over a year and dining is
verv pleased with them," said sopho
more Max Romano, a garden man
ager. "The goal was always to start a
community farm space, but that did
n't become possible until we submit
ted our proposal last spring."
Previous campus food and agri
culture projects have come and gone,
but organizers believe that the Com
munity Farm's numerous sponsors
will aid in its success.
"I think that this will become in
stitutionalized because we have
broad financial and educational sup
port across a lot of departments,"
Romano said. "While funding lor
previous projects was provided by
the ASSU and thus very transient, we
have support from Dining Services,
the Provost's office and other out
side sources. ITiat's the greatest at
tribute we have."
Hopkins said he hopes the cre
ation of the Farm will make students
more conscious of exactly what they
put in their mouths.
"In today's highly global food
production and distribution system,
food generally travels thousands of
miles before it reaches our tables,"
Hopkins said. "The ecological, social
and economic implications of this
disconnect are astounding. In the
long run we aim to maximize the per
centage of locally grown produce
coming into Stanford's meals."
