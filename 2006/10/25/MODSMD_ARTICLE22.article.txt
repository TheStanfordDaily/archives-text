## Card women dominant at ITA Regionals 
### BY JACK SALISBURY 
Freshman Lindsey Burdette flawlessly de
scribed the Cardinal's showing at the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association (ITA) Regionals played
in Berkeley this past weekend: "We came so close
to absolutely dominating the tournament."
Stanford had two players — senior Theresa
Logar and sophomore Jessica Nguyen — reach
the semifinals of the singles draw. Neither could
take home the title, though, as the championship
went toCal's Nina Henkel. Logar fell to Henkel in
the semifinals while Nvugen didn't have much
luck against her either in the championship match.
Nonetheless, the singles' half of the tournament
was dominated by the Cardinal, with half of the
entrants remaining in the quarterfinal round wear
ing red and white.
On the doubles side of the bracket, the duo of
Nvugen and junior Celia Durkin reached the fi
nals. but came up short against Cal's Zsuzsanna
Fodor and Susie Babos.
Nvugen was the star of the tournament for the
Cardinal, reaching the finals of both the singles'
and doubles' tournaments
"Jessica had a break-out tournament," head
coach Lele Forood said. "She came in having
played well in the All-American [Tournament]
and really showed us a lot of what she's going to
bring to the team this year."
Burdette also made an impression for Stanford,
reaching the quarterfinals in singles and the semi
finals of the doubles tournament with her partner,
senior Anne Yelsey.
Although Stanford put four players in the quar
terfinals and two in the semifinals of the singles
tournament as well as two duos in the semifinals of
the doubles. Stanford could not bring home the
title in either section of the ITA Regionals.
Burdette had a match point against her oppo
nent in the quarterfinal match that she would ulti
mately lose. Logar also had a match point in her
semifinal loss to Henkel.
"It was a difficult match," said Logar of her
loss to Henkel. "1 wasn't prepared for the pace,
and I was a bit fatigued. She had an aggressive
game and was a great shot-maker. In the end, she

outplayed me."
ITie ITA Regionals primarily featured teams
from Northern California, including Cal, Nevada,
San Jose State and St. Mary's.The singles' portion
featured a draw of 1% players, with every member
of the Stanford roster except for Yelsey competing
in the singles' tournament. 1 lie doubles' portion of
the tournament had (>4 different duos competing,
with four Cardinal teams in the draw.
"It was a difficult tournament as far as the
amount of play," Logar said. "We're not playing
our best yet, but it's only October."
The ITA Regionals was one of three major
tournaments on Stanford's fall schedule. Next on
the docket is the ITA National Indoors, held the
weekend of Nov. 2-5 in Columbus, Ohio. It should
prove to be the team's biggest tournament of the

fall season.
Overall, it was a solid showing for the develop
ing Cardinal squad this weekend. They have a lot
to live up to, considering the success of past Stan
ford teams, and the Cardinal hope that their best
tennis is still in the future.
"1 feel like our team was much more together
than it was at the All-American [tournament],"
Burdette said. "We were so much more ready to
go"
Sophomore Megan Doheny echoed that senti
ment.
"I think it was a good start to our upcoming sea
son," she said. "1 think we came out strong and
things are looking good for us. We sent a good mes
sage by having our doubles' team in the final and a
person in the singles' final as well."
