five-year
battle over
campus trails

In the latest chapter of a five-year long struggle between
Stanford and an environmental advocacy group, the Santa
Clara County Superior Court has ruled in favor of the Univer
sity and Santa Clara County in a suit regarding a trails project.
The lawsuit had challenged the formal agreement between
Santa Clara County and Stanford regarding the construction
of two trails, one along the eastern edge of Stanford lands,
known as S-l, and another trail tin the west side of campus,
called C-l.
"Stanford promised to build trails on Stanford land, as
shown in the master plans," said Brian Schmidt, Legislative
Advocate for the Committee on Green Foothills. "Instead,


ALEXANDER NARUHIKO CHEE/The Stanford Daily.
Stanford simply wants to expand a
sidewalk, which is in direct contra
diction of what was promised."
For its part, the University con
tends that the location of the trails
was specified previously, and that
Stanford was both fulfilling its legal
responsibilities and responding to
community needs in building the
C-l trail.
"We believe that we are ab
solutely fulfilling our obligation,"
said Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community relations
at Stanford.
In the Oct. 12 decision. Judge
Leslie Nichols ruled that the Com
mittee for Green Foothills failed to
file its lawsuit within the 30-day pe
riod established by state law for
submitting such challenges. The
Committee for Green Foothills ar
gued in its suit that the C-l trail
merely expanded an existing side
walk instead of creating a new trail.
This did not serve the purpose of
increasing recreational opportuni
ties for the neighboring communi
ty. argued the Committee, which
they say was the intent behind the
General Use Permit s requirement
for the trails.

The Signing of the General Use
Permit
On December 12, 2000, Santa
Clara County granted Stanford a
General Use Permit, which allowed
for expanded development in the
portion of University-owned land lo
cated in unincorporated Santa Clara
County.
The Permit — which included
permission for the expansion of aca
demic and academic-support uses,
student housing units, graduate
housing units, faculty housing and
parking spaces — counterbalanced
the allowed development by requir
ing the University to meet conditions
designed to minimize development's
adverse impact on the greater Santa
Clara community. Among these re
quirements was the stipulation that
Stanford "dedicates easements for.
develop and maintain the portions of
two trail alignments which cross
Stanford lands": Routes S-l and C-l,
which were specified in the 1995
Santa Clara Countywide Trails Mas
ter Plan.
The Final Environmental Impact
Report, which was certified by the
Board of Supervisors of Santa Clara
County concurrently with the Gen
eral Use Permit, stated that the de
velopment projects that would result
from the General Use Permit would
significantly affect recreational op
portunities for campus residents and

facility users. Housing development
would take place in areas that previ
ously served the community as recre
ational space, and Stanford's plans to
engage in habitat and environmental
restoration in the Dish would restrict
the establishment of formal trails
there.
The dedications of the S-l and C
-1 trails were, therefore, explicitly in
tended to "replace and expand recre
ational opportunities in the
foothills," as the Impact Report
noted."lmproved parks and dedicat
ed trail corridors will provide a high
er quality of recreational experience
for users, replacing the informal
recreational areas that will be con
verted to other uses."
The Report also stated that "cu
mulative population growth at Stan
ford will combine with regional pop
ulation growth to place additional
demand on recreational resources.
The project will also induce addition
al growth due to the multiplier effect
of new jobs on campus."
"No one ever dreamed Ihis would
be a controversial issue"
Whether the easements cut into
the University's land is critical, Nor
ton said, because once land is allocat
ed for public use, it can no longer be
used for private development by the
University.
"This is not a minor thing," he
said. "We are giving away this land

for perpetuity. The land involved in
the trails will no longer be available
to Stanford, which is why we never
agreed to an interior trail in the first
place. We would not have agreed to
give up the right of future genera
tions of Stanford students, faculty
and administrators to determine the
use of Stanford lands.
"No one ever dreamed this would
be a controversial issue," he added,
noting that the requirements in the
General Use Permit numbered 107
in total, and that the trails were but
one facet of these provisions. "We
have felt for many years that we have
been absolutely correct in our inter
pretation. and the documentation
supports us."
The Committee on Green
Foothills, however, framed the issue
differently. The most important
issue. Schmidt argued, was whether
the C-l path accomplished the re
quirement that Stanford cede ease
ments in order to build a path with
high recreational value and in order
to preserve environmental integrity.
" Ibe impact report mandates
easements." Schmidt said. "The Gen
eral Use permit says that Stanford
will build and maintain easements.
But there is no dedication of ease
ments in taking an already existing
sidewalk and expanding it. The vast
majority of the proposed trail is not
on Stanford land, or has already been
dedicated for public use."

Additionally, the Committee for
Green Foothills criticized the De
cember 13.2005 agreement between
the University and Santa Clara
County, in which Stanford agreed to
construct the S-l trail itself, but de
cided to provide San Mateo County
and the Town of Portola Valley with
the capital funds to construct the
portions of the C-l trail that lay
within their respective jurisdictions.
ITiis was an exclusion of the trail
from Santa Clara County, argued
Schmidt, which was unjust because
the trail rightfully belonged to the
residents of Santa Clara County in
exchange for the burdens that Stan
ford's expansion would place on the
County's infrastructure. The press
release prepared by the Committee
regarding the dismissal of the Com
mittee's lawsuit characterized the
act as "a substantive environmental
violation by the University and
County in eliminating a promised
trail from Santa Clara County."
Horton, however, argued that
the University was promoting re
sponsible and environment-friendly
growth.
"The General Use Permit includes
a requirement for an academic
growth boundary — Stanford is obli
gated to have no development along
the boundary for twenty five years,"
he said. He also noted that, by limiting
itself to a small area of development.
Stanford was undertaking infill devel

opment — development projects
that take place in proximity to exist
ing development, as to prevent
overdevelopment or irresponsible
destruction of undeveloped lands.
"What is important is that the Com
mittee for Green Foothills lost on all
counts." he added. "They have peti
tioned the court twice; the first time
they were given leave to file a new pe
tition, but the new petition was also dis
missed from the court. The Board ot
Supervisors of Santa Clara County
voted against them 4-1. in agreeing to
sign the agreement with us. All of their
arguments have been rebutted and
found false many times in the past, and
their arguments remain false today."
Ihe Committee on Green
Foothills, however, was not about to
concede defeat.
"We emphasize that the judge's
decision was based on a technical
issue," rebutted Schmidt. "It's not
about whether the Committee on
Green Foothills is right or not. There
is no independent third party saying
that we're wrong.
" Ibis is a chance for students to
get out and use the foothills that be
long to them, instead of being forced
to walk along one of the busiest sur
face streets in the area," he added.
I*he proposed sidewalk would be a
waste of student tuition and alumni
donations, and we are proud to be
keeping that kind of waste from oc
curring."

Advocacy
group loses
five-year
battle over
campus trails

In the latest chapter of a five-year long struggle between
Stanford and an environmental advocacy group, the Santa
Clara County Superior Court has ruled in favor of the Univer
sity and Santa Clara County in a suit regarding a trails project.
The lawsuit had challenged the formal agreement between
Santa Clara County and Stanford regarding the construction
of two trails, one along the eastern edge of Stanford lands,
known as S-l, and another trail tin the west side of campus,
called C-l.
"Stanford promised to build trails on Stanford land, as
shown in the master plans," said Brian Schmidt, Legislative
Advocate for the Committee on Green Foothills. "Instead,


ALEXANDER NARUHIKO CHEE/The Stanford Daily.
Stanford simply wants to expand a
sidewalk, which is in direct contra
diction of what was promised."
For its part, the University con
tends that the location of the trails
was specified previously, and that
Stanford was both fulfilling its legal
responsibilities and responding to
community needs in building the
C-l trail.
"We believe that we are ab
solutely fulfilling our obligation,"
said Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community relations
at Stanford.
In the Oct. 12 decision. Judge
Leslie Nichols ruled that the Com
mittee for Green Foothills failed to
file its lawsuit within the 30-day pe
riod established by state law for
submitting such challenges. The
Committee for Green Foothills ar
gued in its suit that the C-l trail
merely expanded an existing side
walk instead of creating a new trail.
This did not serve the purpose of
increasing recreational opportuni
ties for the neighboring communi
ty. argued the Committee, which
they say was the intent behind the
General Use Permit s requirement
for the trails.

The Signing of the General Use
Permit
On December 12, 2000, Santa
Clara County granted Stanford a
General Use Permit, which allowed
for expanded development in the
portion of University-owned land lo
cated in unincorporated Santa Clara
County.
The Permit — which included
permission for the expansion of aca
demic and academic-support uses,
student housing units, graduate
housing units, faculty housing and
parking spaces — counterbalanced
the allowed development by requir
ing the University to meet conditions
designed to minimize development's
adverse impact on the greater Santa
Clara community. Among these re
quirements was the stipulation that
Stanford "dedicates easements for.
develop and maintain the portions of
two trail alignments which cross
Stanford lands": Routes S-l and C-l,
which were specified in the 1995
Santa Clara Countywide Trails Mas
ter Plan.
The Final Environmental Impact
Report, which was certified by the
Board of Supervisors of Santa Clara
County concurrently with the Gen
eral Use Permit, stated that the de
velopment projects that would result
from the General Use Permit would
significantly affect recreational op
portunities for campus residents and

facility users. Housing development
would take place in areas that previ
ously served the community as recre
ational space, and Stanford's plans to
engage in habitat and environmental
restoration in the Dish would restrict
the establishment of formal trails
there.
The dedications of the S-l and C
-1 trails were, therefore, explicitly in
tended to "replace and expand recre
ational opportunities in the
foothills," as the Impact Report
noted."lmproved parks and dedicat
ed trail corridors will provide a high
er quality of recreational experience
for users, replacing the informal
recreational areas that will be con
verted to other uses."
The Report also stated that "cu
mulative population growth at Stan
ford will combine with regional pop
ulation growth to place additional
demand on recreational resources.
The project will also induce addition
al growth due to the multiplier effect
of new jobs on campus."
"No one ever dreamed Ihis would
be a controversial issue"
Whether the easements cut into
the University's land is critical, Nor
ton said, because once land is allocat
ed for public use, it can no longer be
used for private development by the
University.
"This is not a minor thing," he
said. "We are giving away this land

for perpetuity. The land involved in
the trails will no longer be available
to Stanford, which is why we never
agreed to an interior trail in the first
place. We would not have agreed to
give up the right of future genera
tions of Stanford students, faculty
and administrators to determine the
use of Stanford lands.
"No one ever dreamed this would
be a controversial issue," he added,
noting that the requirements in the
General Use Permit numbered 107
in total, and that the trails were but
one facet of these provisions. "We
have felt for many years that we have
been absolutely correct in our inter
pretation. and the documentation
supports us."
The Committee on Green
Foothills, however, framed the issue
differently. The most important
issue. Schmidt argued, was whether
the C-l path accomplished the re
quirement that Stanford cede ease
ments in order to build a path with
high recreational value and in order
to preserve environmental integrity.
" Ibe impact report mandates
easements." Schmidt said. "The Gen
eral Use permit says that Stanford
will build and maintain easements.
But there is no dedication of ease
ments in taking an already existing
sidewalk and expanding it. The vast
majority of the proposed trail is not
on Stanford land, or has already been
dedicated for public use."

Additionally, the Committee for
Green Foothills criticized the De
cember 13.2005 agreement between
the University and Santa Clara
County, in which Stanford agreed to
construct the S-l trail itself, but de
cided to provide San Mateo County
and the Town of Portola Valley with
the capital funds to construct the
portions of the C-l trail that lay
within their respective jurisdictions.
ITiis was an exclusion of the trail
from Santa Clara County, argued
Schmidt, which was unjust because
the trail rightfully belonged to the
residents of Santa Clara County in
exchange for the burdens that Stan
ford's expansion would place on the
County's infrastructure. The press
release prepared by the Committee
regarding the dismissal of the Com
mittee's lawsuit characterized the
act as "a substantive environmental
violation by the University and
County in eliminating a promised
trail from Santa Clara County."
Horton, however, argued that
the University was promoting re
sponsible and environment-friendly
growth.
"The General Use Permit includes
a requirement for an academic
growth boundary — Stanford is obli
gated to have no development along
the boundary for twenty five years,"
he said. He also noted that, by limiting
itself to a small area of development.
Stanford was undertaking infill devel

opment — development projects
that take place in proximity to exist
ing development, as to prevent
overdevelopment or irresponsible
destruction of undeveloped lands.
"What is important is that the Com
mittee for Green Foothills lost on all
counts." he added. "They have peti
tioned the court twice; the first time
they were given leave to file a new pe
tition, but the new petition was also dis
missed from the court. The Board ot
Supervisors of Santa Clara County
voted against them 4-1. in agreeing to
sign the agreement with us. All of their
arguments have been rebutted and
found false many times in the past, and
their arguments remain false today."
Ihe Committee on Green
Foothills, however, was not about to
concede defeat.
"We emphasize that the judge's
decision was based on a technical
issue," rebutted Schmidt. "It's not
about whether the Committee on
Green Foothills is right or not. There
