# For Resident Fellows, a constant balancing act
## 
### LIA HARDIN 
Senior Branner alums were dismayed
earlier this month when first-year Resi
dent Fellow Clyde Moneyhun elected to
prevent them from holding an impromp
tu reunion in the freshman dorm. Con
cerned that upperclassmen might provide
freshmen with alcohol. Moneyhun, who is
director of the Stanford Writing Center,
cancelled the event and forbade its organ
izer, senior Phil Kim, from returning to
Branner.

Other former Branner residents ex
pressed concern that they no longer felt
welcome in the all-frosh dorm that had
been their home when they first came to
The Farm.
"Moneyhun had every right to cancel
the [reunion] given his concerns about the
possible presence of alcohol." said senior
Tracy Shepard. in an email to Fhe Daily
But she called his tone "insulting" and un-
called for. Moneyhun did not respond to at
tempts for a comment.
The incident was a typical example of the
fine line that Stanford Resident Fellows (RFs)
must walk. They are charged with fostering
dorm community and enforcing discipline
while trying to avoid becoming parents or po
lice in the eyes of undergraduates. According
to Jane Camarillo, director of Residential Edu
cation, Jane Stanford outlined in Stanford's
Founding Grant that faculty, staff and students
should live together on campus as a "scholarly
community," a mission that administrators said
is much easier said than done.
This year that struggle has been particularly
tough, with new faces in 11 RF apartments —
Branner, Yost. Robinson. Ujamaa, West Lag,
Roble, Burbank, Toyon, Arroyo, Otero and
EAST house.
"It is a balancing act," said Haas Center Di
rector Nicole Taylor, who became the RF in
Burbank this year after former RFs Jazmin and
Lawrence Quill left. "ResEd is trying to figure
out how to have conversations about drinking
and alcohol."
Taylor pointed out that although she want
ed to make sure the dorm was comfortable for
all residents, forcing students to make respon
sible choices was not in her job description.
"These kids have parents,"she said."l'm not
here to be their parent. I'm here to encourage
them to take responsibility for their actions."
New RFs must learn to balance the instinct
to protect and guide students with the reality

that undergraduates are expected to make re
sponsible decisions.
For new RF Kate Chesley of Roble, living
with undergraduates is a privilege.
"Every day we get a chance to have conver
sations with some of the smartest, most talent
ed and interesting people we ever met," said
Chesley, who is associate director of University
Communications, in an email to The Daily.
Taylor agreed. As a Stanford alumnus, she
became an RF to meet and guide current stu
dents.
"1 thought of myself as a teacher since I did
the STEP program here," she said. "It's been
really valuable,"
Both Taylor and Chesley have children who
live with them in the dorm.
"College campuses are wonderful places for
children to grow up," said Chesley, who spent
parts of her own childhood on college campuses.
Taylor, who lives with her seven-year-old
son Evan, concurs.
"My son loves it," she said. "The students
are great with him. It's like having a little broth
er around. 1 try to set limits, though. 1 draw a
line so he's not exposed to everything."
Taylor admitted that she was unable to pro
tect her students in the same way.
"Students make decisions that we think
aren't smart," she said. "It's tough."
Shepard felt that policy for RF responsibili
ties was less clear, saying that the Moneyhun
had neglected to treat the Branner alumni like
adults in his correspondence.
"One of the most impressive things about
this University is its respect for its students,"
she said. "For instance, the fact that we are gov
erned by a student-run judicial panel shows
that we are treated as adults and equals in the
academic environment."
