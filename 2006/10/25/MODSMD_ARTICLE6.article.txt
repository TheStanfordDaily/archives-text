# Students debate hot topics on campus
## Political groups voice opinions on upcoming election issues 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the election less than two wet
away, campus political groups are nial

final push to get out the vote in California's most
hotly contested congressional races.

Since September, the Stanford Democrats have registered over
125 students with a campus-wide get-out-the-vote program. The
group's president,senior Bobby Lepore, said that the group will join
campus Democrats from Sacramento State University'. Chico State

University, UC-Davisand UC-Berkeley
in a door-to-door canvassing effort to
rally young progressive voters in the I
state's highly competitive 11th District, I
which includes Stockton and San
Ramon. With this district's Republican
incumbent Richard Pombo mired in
scandal, Lepore said that Democrats
have more than a fighting chance to pick
up this seat.
"Given that control of the House is
currently separated by a mere fifteen
seats, it's a great opportunity for stu
dents to have a real impact on the direc
tion of our national policy," Lepore said.
"Regardless of one's political persua
sion, the outcome of this race matters for
everyone in America."
The Democrats also plan to create a
voter guide to help students navigate the
complexities of this year's ballot propo
sitions and host upcoming events that
will educate voters.
"The Denis feel that if everyone has
the information, they'll vote for change

and help us win hack the House," said sophomore Beth D'Aunno,
field director for the campus Democrats.
In contrast, the Stanford College Republicans (SCR) were ab
sent at this year's Activities Fair and have not held a meeting since
the spring (they plan to hold a recruitment meeting Monday, eight
days before the election).
SCR President Megan Reiss, a senior, said that she regrets the
lack of liberal-conservative discourse on campus due to the void left
by the SCR's inactivity.
"There really hasn't' been a conservative voice." said Reiss.
"There was sort of a duck thing going on last year because we were
all so busy, and the Republicans just stopped being active."
The organization hopes to re-energize conservative activism on
campus with a kick-off event on Veteran's Day, which it hopes toco
sponsor with the chapter from Santa Clara University. Reiss also en
visioned a night in late November or early December for students
interested in obtaining political internships.

PROP 85
"Prop 85 is not a pro
life OR A PRO-CHOICE ISSUE,
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHETHER ABORTION IS RIGHT
or wrong. Prop 85 is
ABOUT PARENTAL RIGHTS AND
KEEPING YOUNG GIRLS SAFE.
MARY HO ;
president of SSFL.

Nevertheless, Reiss is concerned
that SCR's slow start may hamper
opportunities to recruit conservative
students.
"Freshmen don't even know we
exist, and that's going to be a chal
lenge," she added.
While the Republican-Democrat
divide on campus has been muted,
Stanford Students for Choice and
Stanford Students for Life (SSFL)
are vocally at odds over Proposition
85, which would amend California's
constitution to prohibit minors from
obtaining an abortion without
parental notification.
Meanwhile, SSFL is working
alongside local community organi
zations and churches to heip muster
support for the proposed measure.
"Prop 85 is not a pro-life or a pro
choice issue, and it's not about
whether abortion is right or wrong,"
said sophomore Mary Ho, president
of SSFL. "Prop 85 is about parental
rights and keeping young girls safe."
Campus pro-choice activists have
spearheaded opposition to the
measure with Students for Choice.
They hosted a party at the Women's
Center last week to galvanize oppo
sition to Proposition 85, to portray
the debate over the proposition as a
debate over a woman's right to
choose.
Junior Mishan Araujo, co-presi
dent of Students for Choice, said that
Prop 85 is obviously an abortion
issue because those who support it
share the goal of overturning Roe v.
Wade. Parental notification, she ar

gued, would also jeopardize stu
dents' safety.
"When teens are limited in their
options for making healthy deci
sions, they often take drastic meas
ures that can endanger their health,"
she said. "What we need to do is give
them access to safe medical care.
This proposition would put the most
vulnerable teens who come from
abusive families at serious risk."
Volunteers from the University's
NAACP chapter handed out ballot
information and registered voters
last Sunday at the Saint Samuel
Church of God and Christ in East
Palo Alto. Co-president Desiree
Cormier, a senior, said the event was
a success and that the NAACP plans
to host a registration drive this Sun
day at another church in East Palo
Alto or Redwood City.
The organization also hopes to
reach out to the broader University
community and encourage voters
from all political stripes and back
grounds to vote. Cormier added.
The group wants to mediate a de
bate over ballot initiatives between
the Stanford Democrats and Stan
ford College Republicans. Although
the Democrats are on board, the
event is in limbo because the Repub
licans have yet to respond to
NAACP organizers, Cormier said.
Although opinions diverge on
the issues, campus activists largely
share the same goal — getting peo
ple to vote. The NAACP which re
cently celebrated the renewal of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965, was espe
cially adamant about this issue.
"It's not that this election is more
or less important than any other elec
tion," Cormier said."lt's that we need
to go out and exercise a right that
many people fought and died for."

Junior Mishan Araujo, co-presi
dent of Students for Choice, said that
Prop 85 is obviously an abortion
issue because those who support it
share the goal of overturning Roe v.
Wade. Parental notification, she ar

gued, would also jeopardize stu
dents' safety.
"When teens are limited in their
options for making healthy deci
sions, they often take drastic meas
ures that can endanger their health,"
she said. "What we need to do is give
them access to safe medical care.
This proposition would put the most
vulnerable teens who come from
abusive families at serious risk."
Volunteers from the University's
NAACP chapter handed out ballot
information and registered voters
last Sunday at the Saint Samuel
Church of God and Christ in East
Palo Alto. Co-president Desiree
Cormier, a senior, said the event was
a success and that the NAACP plans
to host a registration drive this Sun
day at another church in East Palo
Alto or Redwood City.
The organization also hopes to
reach out to the broader University
community and encourage voters
from all political stripes and back
grounds to vote. Cormier added.
The group wants to mediate a de
bate over ballot initiatives between
the Stanford Democrats and Stan
ford College Republicans. Although
the Democrats are on board, the
event is in limbo because the Repub
licans have yet to respond to
NAACP organizers, Cormier said.
Although opinions diverge on
the issues, campus activists largely
share the same goal — getting peo
ple to vote. The NAACP which re
cently celebrated the renewal of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965, was espe
cially adamant about this issue.
"It's not that this election is more
or less important than any other elec
tion," Cormier said."lt's that we need
to go out and exercise a right that
many people fought and died for."
With the election less than two wet
away, campus political groups are nial

final push to get out the vote in California's most
hotly contested congressional races.

Since September, the Stanford Democrats have registered over
125 students with a campus-wide get-out-the-vote program. The
group's president,senior Bobby Lepore, said that the group will join
campus Democrats from Sacramento State University'. Chico State

University, UC-Davisand UC-Berkeley
in a door-to-door canvassing effort to
rally young progressive voters in the I
state's highly competitive 11th District, I
which includes Stockton and San
Ramon. With this district's Republican
incumbent Richard Pombo mired in
scandal, Lepore said that Democrats
have more than a fighting chance to pick
up this seat.
"Given that control of the House is
currently separated by a mere fifteen
seats, it's a great opportunity for stu
dents to have a real impact on the direc
tion of our national policy," Lepore said.
"Regardless of one's political persua
sion, the outcome of this race matters for
everyone in America."
The Democrats also plan to create a
voter guide to help students navigate the
complexities of this year's ballot propo
sitions and host upcoming events that
will educate voters.
"The Denis feel that if everyone has
the information, they'll vote for change

and help us win hack the House," said sophomore Beth D'Aunno,
field director for the campus Democrats.
In contrast, the Stanford College Republicans (SCR) were ab
sent at this year's Activities Fair and have not held a meeting since
the spring (they plan to hold a recruitment meeting Monday, eight
days before the election).
SCR President Megan Reiss, a senior, said that she regrets the
lack of liberal-conservative discourse on campus due to the void left
by the SCR's inactivity.
"There really hasn't' been a conservative voice." said Reiss.
"There was sort of a duck thing going on last year because we were
all so busy, and the Republicans just stopped being active."
The organization hopes to re-energize conservative activism on
campus with a kick-off event on Veteran's Day, which it hopes toco
sponsor with the chapter from Santa Clara University. Reiss also en
visioned a night in late November or early December for students
interested in obtaining political internships.

PROP 85
"Prop 85 is not a pro
life OR A PRO-CHOICE ISSUE,
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHETHER ABORTION IS RIGHT
or wrong. Prop 85 is
ABOUT PARENTAL RIGHTS AND
KEEPING YOUNG GIRLS SAFE.
MARY HO ;
president of SSFL.

Nevertheless, Reiss is concerned
that SCR's slow start may hamper
opportunities to recruit conservative
students.
"Freshmen don't even know we
exist, and that's going to be a chal
lenge," she added.
While the Republican-Democrat
divide on campus has been muted,
Stanford Students for Choice and
Stanford Students for Life (SSFL)
are vocally at odds over Proposition
85, which would amend California's
constitution to prohibit minors from
obtaining an abortion without
parental notification.
Meanwhile, SSFL is working
alongside local community organi
zations and churches to heip muster
support for the proposed measure.
"Prop 85 is not a pro-life or a pro
choice issue, and it's not about
whether abortion is right or wrong,"
said sophomore Mary Ho, president
of SSFL. "Prop 85 is about parental
rights and keeping young girls safe."
Campus pro-choice activists have
spearheaded opposition to the
measure with Students for Choice.
They hosted a party at the Women's
Center last week to galvanize oppo
sition to Proposition 85, to portray
the debate over the proposition as a
debate over a woman's right to
choose.
Junior Mishan Araujo, co-presi
dent of Students for Choice, said that
Prop 85 is obviously an abortion
issue because those who support it
share the goal of overturning Roe v.
