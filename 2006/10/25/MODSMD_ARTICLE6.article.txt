# Students debate hot topics on campus
## Political groups voice opinions on upcoming election issues 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the election less than two wet
away, campus political groups are nial

final push to get out the vote in California's most
hotly contested congressional races.

Since September, the Stanford Democrats have registered over
125 students with a campus-wide get-out-the-vote program. The
group's president,senior Bobby Lepore, said that the group will join
campus Democrats from Sacramento State University'. Chico State

University, UC-Davisand UC-Berkeley
in a door-to-door canvassing effort to
rally young progressive voters in the I
state's highly competitive 11th District, I
which includes Stockton and San
Ramon. With this district's Republican
incumbent Richard Pombo mired in
scandal, Lepore said that Democrats
have more than a fighting chance to pick
up this seat.
"Given that control of the House is
currently separated by a mere fifteen
seats, it's a great opportunity for stu
dents to have a real impact on the direc
tion of our national policy," Lepore said.
"Regardless of one's political persua
sion, the outcome of this race matters for
everyone in America."
The Democrats also plan to create a
voter guide to help students navigate the
complexities of this year's ballot propo
sitions and host upcoming events that
will educate voters.
"The Denis feel that if everyone has
the information, they'll vote for change

and help us win hack the House," said sophomore Beth D'Aunno,
field director for the campus Democrats.
In contrast, the Stanford College Republicans (SCR) were ab
sent at this year's Activities Fair and have not held a meeting since
the spring (they plan to hold a recruitment meeting Monday, eight
days before the election).
SCR President Megan Reiss, a senior, said that she regrets the
lack of liberal-conservative discourse on campus due to the void left
by the SCR's inactivity.
"There really hasn't' been a conservative voice." said Reiss.
"There was sort of a duck thing going on last year because we were
all so busy, and the Republicans just stopped being active."
The organization hopes to re-energize conservative activism on
campus with a kick-off event on Veteran's Day, which it hopes toco
sponsor with the chapter from Santa Clara University. Reiss also en
visioned a night in late November or early December for students
interested in obtaining political internships.

PROP 85
"Prop 85 is not a pro
life OR A PRO-CHOICE ISSUE,
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHETHER ABORTION IS RIGHT
or wrong. Prop 85 is
ABOUT PARENTAL RIGHTS AND
KEEPING YOUNG GIRLS SAFE.
