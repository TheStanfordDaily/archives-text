With Democrats poised to take back the House of
Representatives in two weeks, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-
San Jose) highlighted last night the tough time her
party has had on Capitol Hill since the Republican
takeover 12 years ago.
Lofgren, who is a member of the class of 1970 and
also the mother of a current Stanford senior, was elect
ed in 1994, the year that Newt Gingrich led the Repub
lican Party to the majority position in the House, after
fifty years of Democratic control.
"What you can do in the minority is very different
than what you can do in the majority," Lofgren said.
ITie congresswoman said a bill she wrote to fund
research into fusion power remained stalled because
the Republican I louse would not allow any bill au

thored by a Democrat to come to a vote.
"With the inauguration of the Gingrich Republi
cans, Congress became a winner-take-all system," Lof
gren explained. "And in the last few years Speaker
Hastert has announced that no bill would come before
Congress unless it was approved by a majority of the
majority."
Lofgren finally broke the impasse by getting Sher
wood Boehlert, a Republican who was the Chairman
of the Science Committee, to incorporate it into an
other bill. She used it as an example of the importance
of finding some sort of common ground, even with
members she largely disagrees with.
The congresswoman also said she felt that it has be
come harder to deliberate on bills before voting be
gins in recent years.
"We no longer have an appropriations process,"
Lofgren said."[ln the past], there were thirteen appro
priations bills that came out in September and you had
time to read everything."
That changed after the federal government tem-

porarily shut down in 1994 because
the proper appropriations had not
been passed. According to Lofgren.
since then there has only been one
massive omnibus bill, several feet
thick, and representatives were not
given enough time to read it.
"Given how fast some of this
works, it's just really hard to know
what's in the bills," Lofgren said.
"And you feel a responsibility, be
cause you can't vote against it or
you'll shut down the government."
Sophomore Kathy Cooper, direc
tor of the Health and Human Ser
vices branch of the Roosevelt Insti
tution. said she enjoyed Lofgren's
candor.

"I was surprised that she admitted
that a lot of [congressional represen
tatives] don't understand the bills
they vote for" Cooper s;iid. "And 1
think it's good that she recognized
how big of a problem this poses for
passing decent legislation."
Lofgren also speculated on the re
sults of a Democratic victory in the
midterm elections.
"A lot of hard feelings can be built
up in a dozen years of rude and unfair
treatment" Lofgren said. "But our
job is not to wallow in that, because
the country does not need that.
"If the Democrats gain control,
I'll have the choice of chairing one of
several subcommittees. And I think
I'll choose the immigration [one]. It'll
be interesting to try and find some
common ground with people on the
other side."
Lofgren's speech was given to a
class,set up through the Public Policy

Department by the Roosevelt Insti
tute, a nation-wide student think
tank dedicated to policy research. Ju
nior Eric Mitzenmacher, who is head
of the Stanford chapter of the Roo
sevelt Institute, commented on the
purpose of the class.
"There is this gap." he said.
"When you get to Stanford you learn
enough to do basic policy work. But
you can't do your own work until
you're a senior. [This] class is de
signed to allow students to do policy
research beyond what you can do in
a normal class, but below the level of
an honors thesis."
"The idea is that the students
write a ten page paper and op-ed to
sell that work," Mitzenmacher con
tinued. "Then we use the Roosevelt
apparatus to get that work into the
policy world."
The Roosevelt Institute has been
reaching out to local policy-makers.

including councilmen and women,
mayors and agency heads to see what
issues need more investigation.
Often these offices don't have
enough staff to pursue every idea,
and Mitzenmacher tries to see where
the Roosevelt Institute can fill those
gaps with student researchers.
" The mission of Roosevelt is
premised on students having tons of
ideas, but we don't really know how
to get them out," said senior Anthony
Sanchez."l've been focusing on local
open-government laws. It's great to
work on something that is so impor
tant."
Lofgren was recruited into the In
stitute by her son, and she now sits on
the advisory board.
"I think that this is iÂ» goodgroupof
students," Lofgren told The Daily. "I
have been impressed with the quality
of their thinking and I look forward
to hearing more from them."
