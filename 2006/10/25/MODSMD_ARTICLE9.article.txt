## Anti-gambling bill threatens online gaming growth 
### ADAM GOLDMAN AP BUSINESS WRITER 
NLW YORK (AP) — Gamblers
may look over their shoulder now,
but experts say a new Internet gam
bling ban won't keep bettors from
ponying up. just turn them on to
overseas payment services out of the
law's reach.
"It has put a terrible scare into
people," said I. Nelson Rose, who
teaches gambling law at Whittier
Law School. "But it won't by any
means wipe out Internet gambling."
The fright swept through the $12
billion industry on the heels of the re
cent arrests of two gambling compa
ny executives and a new law Presi
dent Bush signed Oct. 13 that seeks
to ban most online gambling and
criminalizes funds transfers.
The law has wiped out billions of
dollars in shareholder value of British
companies, leaving the industry's fu
ture in doubt as U.S. lawmakers ini
tially trumpeted they had found a way
to halt bets coming from America.
But serious questions remain
about whether the legislation can be
effective in stopping U.S. residents
from playing poker or betting on
sports.
The "Unlawful Internet Gam
bling Enforcement Act" goes after
the money, not the millions of play
ers. which would be nearly impossi
ble to enforce.
It will essentially try to choke off
the way Americans fund their gam
bling habits, hoping to prevent the
transfer of dollars to the popular In
ternet sites.
It's also widely understood that
the law has online poker in its gun
sights, identifying it as a game of
chance _ something the poker com
panies dispute. They believe poker is
a game of skill and therefore not sub
ject to the new rules.
But they're fearful nonetheless.
"Their mission is to kill the funding
of online poker, and that's what this
law does," said Mike Sexton, who hosts
the popular World Poker Tour and has
won millions as a professional player.
The new law comes amid an ex
plosion in online gambling, fueled by
the Texas Hold 'em craze and wide
spread access to the Internet. In addi
tion. dozens of Web sites have
sprouted up that allow any gambler
with a credit card to bet on any sport
they choose, for any amount of
money they want.
Industry experts say there are an
estimated 2,000 Internet sites that
take bets for sports and poker. Amer
ican players have fueled Internet
gambling, supplying $6 billion of the
$12 billion in revenues generated an
nually.
"The time has been one of rapid
growth." said Sebastian Sinclair,
president of Christiansen Capital
Advisors, a gambling consultant.
"This industry was well on its way to
becoming mainstream in a great part
of the world. Capital was tripping
over itself to fund these companies."
The new law gives the U.S. Trea
sury and Federal Reserve, along with
the Attorney General, 270 days to es
tablish policies and procedures.
"The regulations are clearly going
to prevent banks from doing electron
ic fund transfers to gambling sites, but

that is no big deal." Rose said.
Clamping down on the banks
won't serve as a panacea. Rose said.
In some cases, banks simply move the
money to payment processors,
known as e-wallets. Non-LJ.S. pay
ment processors such as the widely
used Neteller then transfer the
money to the Internet gambling sites.
The U.S. government has no au
thority over processors like Neteller
that are operating legally.
Anthony Cabot, a well-known
gambling lawyer in Las Vegas, thinks
language used in the bill provides a
loophole for the payment processors
and the U.S. banks that want to be
free to do business with them.
"Unless you have some fairly
Draconian measures ... the likeli
hood of stopping payment to them is
small," Cabot said.
Much damage has already been
done to the offshore sports betting
industry without the looming regula
tions.
British BetOnSports PLC folded
after its chief executive was arrested
in July by US. authorities. David
Carruthers faces 22 counts of fraud
and racketeering charges and re
mains under house arrest in the St.
Louis area.

Letting it ride online
Internet gambling generated an
estimated $12 billion in revenue
last year, with about $6 billion
coming from players in the U.S.
Global revenue
from Internet gambling

London-based Sportinghet's
chairman was detained last month in
New York on a state fugitive warrant
charging him with illegal online gam
bling. He was eventually freed.
Both arrests sounded serious
alarm hells for those running sports
wagering sites that take American
bets.
The new legislation has already
had a dramatic effect. It supposedly
clarifies the 1%1 Wire Act, explicitly
outlawing Internet gambling, includ
ing online poker.
It creates new criminal penalties,
which have rattled investors and ex
ecutives — although Rose said it
doesn't expand the act. and there's
no indication the Justice Department
is about to launch a huge campaign
to enforce the law.
Still, the biggest publicly traded
names in Internet gambling on the
London Stock Exchange and AIM,
the exchange's global market for

growing companies, could not afford
to flout American law. When news
broke earlier this month that Con
gress has passed the bill. Internet
gambling companies traded on those
exchanges lost a combined $7 billion
in market capitalization.
Party Gaming PLC, once the envy
of online gambling with its more than
$8 billion IPO in 2005, is now trying
to figure out how to save its business
model. It runs what was once the
world's biggest poker site. Party Po
ker, and has said it will no longer take
payments from the U.S., eliminating
nearly 80 percent of its revenue and
sending its stock plunging.
Another poker company, 888
Holdings PLC. also said it would stop
taking U.S. bets, ensuring its profits
will fall dramatically.
Sportingbet and Leisure & Gam
ing both sold their U.S. operations for
a dollar. Sportingbet said its exit
from the U.S. market cost it nearly
$400 million.
The bleeding didn't stop there.
Neteller and Fire One. which owns e
wallet Fire Pay, also saw their stock
price plummet. On Oct. 2. Fire Pay
announced it had stopped doing
business with sites that might take
U.S. bets, including Poker Stars. nit
decision forced Poker Stars. now the
biggest poker site in the world and a
registered business in Costa Rica, to
rely on Neteller to take money for
bets headed to its site.
"'lTiere are privately owned oper
ators that will continue to take play
as long as they have payment proces
sors that will work with them." said
Sue Schneider, publisher of the on
line gaming magazine Interactive
Gaming News. "I think the big ques
tion is whether the volume remains
the same. But I don't think any of this
means there will be less people play
ing on the Internet."
Neteller has said it is evaluating
the law. If Neteller abandons Poker-
Stars and other sites, their bottom
lines, no doubt, will be hit hard.
But so far, Neteller's decision to
work with Poker Stars has amounted
to good news for sites not afraid of
scorning U.S. law.
Experts say while the new law has
forced the public companies out of
U.S. market, it has left poker players
and bettors gravitating toward pri
vate companies.
Both Poker Stars and Full Tilt
have already seen traffic on their
Web sites surge, taking advantage of
any short-term gain now that some of
the competition has been sidelined.
On its Web site recently, Full Tilt
boasted: "We're Here to Stay!" and
offered bonuses to sign up.
This isn't the first time the indus
try has faced a serious setback. In
2001, Visa and MasterCard and other
merchant banks stopped allowing
money to be sent to Internet gam
bling sites.
Like then, Sinclair thinks Internet
gambling will recover again. It's sim
ply tot) lucrative.
"There will be a big hit to the in
dustry," Sinclair said. "A big hit. But
it's not going to be long term, it's
transitory until somebody finds a so
lution to whatever roadblocks are
put in their way. There's too much
money for it to go away."

A billboard promoting an online gambling site is shown in this Oct. 10, 2006, file photo in New York. Advertisements
like these, which the companies insist are legal, have helped attract millions of customers to online gambling, and
may have left the false impression among many that both the ads and online wagering are legal.
