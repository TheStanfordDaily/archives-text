Too lazy to trek to TresEx? Can't
find what you need at the bookstore?
No problem — your next candy bar
could be just a click away thanks to
Dorm Snacks.com, a student-owned and

-run website that caters to your door.
Founded by Brown University un
dergraduates in 2004, the Dorm Snacks
grocery service has since spread to three
other national universities, making its
Stanford debut two weeks ago.
Sophomores Jay Kilachand and
Omar Kl-Ayat, who launched the Stan
ford branch with help from Brown stu
dent Kevin Dixon, said they had a simi
lar idea last year when faced with a com
mon freshman dilemma: how to quench

the midnight munchies without a car.
"Its 11:50 and you go to the vending
machine and there's nothing there you
want; what do you do?" Kilachand
asked.
If you plan ahead, he said, you'll save
yourself the disappointing trip down
stairs to the laundry room machine.
Dorm Snacks.com provides students
with snacks and supplies, offering
everything from Doritos to Dove soap
— provided that you are willing to buy

in bulk, place your order by 2 p.m.
lTiursday and wait for Friday delivery.
Eventually, Kilachand and El-Ayat
said they hope to make deliveries avail
able a few times a week.
The two grocers deliver out of their
car. dubbed the "Snackmobile."
"At Brown they did deliveries in a
shopping cart, but Stanford is just too
big," Kilachand said.
Dorm Snacks takes credit card,
cash or check, and even offers a
"Snack Bucks" feature that lets stu
dents keep credit on the site. Prices
may look a little steep because stu
dents must buy in bulk, but delivery
is free.
So what's fueling Stanford's
studying?
"Junk food, soda and chips," Ki
lachand said. "But the biggest or
ders have been for bottled water."
He added that there has not been
much interest in sundry items.
The owners say customers have
been mostly undergrads.
"We are targeting freshmen and
other students without cars, but we
were surprised by a grad student
order last week," kilachand added.
Their advertising campaign ap
pears to be working. Freshman As
mita Kumar reported that she re
ceived an email about the service
and is interested in checking it out.

However, some remain leery of the
service's requirement that orders
be placed in large quantities.
"Maybe if things weren't all in
bulk, or you had the option to buy
individually, I would try it." fresh
man Teresa Wu said.
Others offered suggestions that
the Dorm Snacks business branch
out into delivery of other products.
"They should try it with hot
food." said freshman Daniel Gra
ham.
Others maintain that there is no
need to turn to Dorm Snacks for off
campus supply runs.
"I'm quite happy to bike to Safe
way or use TresEx," said senior Has
san Abudu.
In the two weeks they've been in
business, the Dorm Snacks boys say
they have served about 30 cus
tomers.
"It's pretty big at Brown," Kilac
hand said, adding that almost 700
students use the service in Provi
dence. "We hope in the next two
years that we get a big enough cus
tomer base at Stanford to get 20 to
30 orders per day and can offer next
day service."
