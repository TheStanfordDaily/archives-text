Too lazy to trek to TresEx? Can't
find what you need at the bookstore?
No problem — your next candy bar
could be just a click away thanks to
Dorm Snacks.com, a student-owned and

-run website that caters to your door.
Founded by Brown University un
dergraduates in 2004, the Dorm Snacks
grocery service has since spread to three
other national universities, making its
Stanford debut two weeks ago.
Sophomores Jay Kilachand and
Omar Kl-Ayat, who launched the Stan
ford branch with help from Brown stu
dent Kevin Dixon, said they had a simi
lar idea last year when faced with a com
mon freshman dilemma: how to quench

the midnight munchies without a car.
"Its 11:50 and you go to the vending
machine and there's nothing there you
want; what do you do?" Kilachand
asked.
If you plan ahead, he said, you'll save
yourself the disappointing trip down
stairs to the laundry room machine.
Dorm Snacks.com provides students
with snacks and supplies, offering
everything from Doritos to Dove soap
— provided that you are willing to buy

in bulk, place your order by 2 p.m.
lTiursday and wait for Friday delivery.
Eventually, Kilachand and El-Ayat
said they hope to make deliveries avail
able a few times a week.
The two grocers deliver out of their
car. dubbed the "Snackmobile."
"At Brown they did deliveries in a
shopping cart, but Stanford is just too
big," Kilachand said.
