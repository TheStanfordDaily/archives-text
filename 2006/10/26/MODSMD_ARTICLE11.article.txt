## Wheels fall off Bike Ban protest Officials encounter graffiti, thefts, but most students remain apathetic 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the Oct. 30 deadline for Bike Ban compliance
looming, student protests of the policy have been covert,
with thefts of signs, graffiti and an unsigned email calling
for a demonstration yesterday.
Before police begin ticketing and confiscating bikes
next week, senior Alicia Perry forwarded an email to sev
eral mailing lists during the week and encouraged stu
dents to reject the ban by parking their bikes in the ar
cades.

"Let our hikes stand in protest against the inhumanity
that is the unwanted 'pedestrian zone' in our Main Quad,"
Perry wrote.
But the mass of parked bikes promised by the e-mail
never materialized.The arcades of the quad stood as empty
as they have for weeks.
"I had the idea for the protest from the second week of
school," Perry told the Daily afterward. "I wish I had done
it then,since it would have had more support. It's not as big
of an issue now as it was then, but people are still against
it."
Meanwhile, workers for the Department of Public Safe
ty patrolled the arcades with yesterday, yellow flyers in
hand. They said they hadn't seen anything out of the ordi
nary.

A lone bike parked in the quad receives a citation while dozens of others are propped just feet away. A letter
urging students to protest by parking in the quad yesterday elicited little response from the campus population.
"I'd heard about [the protest], but
I haven't seen anything," said Public
Safety employee Steve, who said
workers were told not to give their
last names by supervisors.
Faculty members had also heard
about the planned protest, and. per
haps harkening back to days of more
vigorous rallies on Ilie Farm, were
worried.
"One instructor asked me
about the protest." said Carl de
Soto, another Department of Pub
lic Safety employee. "She said she
didn't want to be here when it hap
pened."
Student reactions to the would
be protest ranged from indifferent to
annoyed.
"I don't have any classes in Main
Quad and I don't have a bike, but I
am curious to know why the protest
did not happen." said Senior Parmi

ta Dalai.
Others were more critical.
"I think the fact that people are
protesting is ridiculous." said sopho
more Evan Purcell.
But de Soto said other forms of
anonymous protest continue.
"We've been having signs stolen
and graffiti by students," he said,
pointing to a spot on the ground that
had been washed of graffiti just that
morning.
Students also scrawled profanity
outside Memorial Church and in
other parts of the Quad arcades
Wednesday night, he said.
According to de Soto, one of the
sandwich board signs describing
the new biking rules was stolen yes
terday morning. The signs are
stolen even though the Depart
ment of Public Safety removes
them at 3 p.m.. when the workers go
home.
Beginning next Monday, enforce
ment of the rule will be handed over
to the Stanford Police Department,
who will start issuing citations and
fines to violators.
