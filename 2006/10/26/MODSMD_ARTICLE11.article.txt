## Wheels fall off Bike Ban protest Officials encounter graffiti, thefts, but most students remain apathetic 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the Oct. 30 deadline for Bike Ban compliance
looming, student protests of the policy have been covert,
with thefts of signs, graffiti and an unsigned email calling
for a demonstration yesterday.
Before police begin ticketing and confiscating bikes
next week, senior Alicia Perry forwarded an email to sev
eral mailing lists during the week and encouraged stu
dents to reject the ban by parking their bikes in the ar
cades.

"Let our hikes stand in protest against the inhumanity
that is the unwanted 'pedestrian zone' in our Main Quad,"
Perry wrote.
But the mass of parked bikes promised by the e-mail
never materialized.The arcades of the quad stood as empty
as they have for weeks.
"I had the idea for the protest from the second week of
school," Perry told the Daily afterward. "I wish I had done
it then,since it would have had more support. It's not as big
of an issue now as it was then, but people are still against
it."
Meanwhile, workers for the Department of Public Safe
ty patrolled the arcades with yesterday, yellow flyers in
hand. They said they hadn't seen anything out of the ordi
nary.

A lone bike parked in the quad receives a citation while dozens of others are propped just feet away. A letter
urging students to protest by parking in the quad yesterday elicited little response from the campus population.
