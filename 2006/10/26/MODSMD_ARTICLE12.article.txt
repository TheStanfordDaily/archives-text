## Editorial Board University should facilitate legal file sharing 
### 
File sharing has been making big news in
the US ever since the advent of Napster
in June of 1999. While file sharing tech
nology is legal, the vast majority of multime
dia files being exchanged over peer-to-peer
(P2P) networks are copyrighted, making
>uch exchanges illegal under intellectual
property right laws. Since Napster's heyday,
album sales are down by thirty percent and
the film industry is losing an estimated $5.5
billion to movie piracy annually. Since 2(X)3.
the recording industry has sent thousands of
cease-and-desist letters to illegal file swap
pers the nation over and has thus far filed
suit against over 17,(MKJ people, including an
estimated 1 .(XX) students.
I"his year, the Supreme Court took up the
issue, unanimously ruling in the case of
MGM v. Grokster that creating new technol
ogy that enables copyright infringement is
not illegal, but that actively encouraging it is
It comes as little surprise then that sharing
copyrighted files is also still certified illegal.
That being the case, hardly anyone seems to
have noticed. Billions of files are being ex
changed over P2P networks every month
and while a new crop of paid services like
iTunes and Yahoo Music has emerged over
the last several years, the fact remains that
ten times as many songs are downloaded il
legally through P2P networks than through
all the paid services combined.
It seems that while many file sharers
would openly acknowledge that their activi
ty is illegal, few would describe their activity
as unethical or morally troubling. While the
recording industry (RIAA) has equated
downloading copyrighted files with lifting a
CD from a musician's rack, such a connec
tion is often lost on even the most casual
downloaded Misconceptions seem to arise
for two main reasons.
first, many independent musicians have
begun openly distributing their music on the

Internet. According to some copyright ex
perts. the large majority of artists lose very lit
tle from copyright infringement; it is the cor
porate labels and big name acts that lose the
most. In the face of rising album costs, few file
sharers have expressed sympathy for the
handlul of superstars and record execs that
stand to lose a small share of their millions.
Second, the Internet has, over the past
decade, revolutionized popular perceptions
about what constitutes intellectual property
rights and how intellectual property should be
distributed. In 2(X)o,Charles (\ Mann,a writer
tor the Atlantic Monthly, referred to the P2P
phenomenon as the "heavenly jukebox," a
"vast intellectual commons [where] nothing
will ever again be out of print or impossible to
find; every scrap of human culture tran
scribed. no matter how obscure or commer
cially unsuccessful will be available to all."
ITie growth of open source projects in
programming has furthered this notion of a
"heavenly jukebox." Under the open source
model, projects are made available to the
larger community to modify and redistribute
as it sees fit. The driving aim behind open
source is to reduce copyright restrictions and
cut costs to the consumer, opening up wide
spread public access to products and thereby
facilitating innovation and exchange.
Stanford I aw School professor Lawrence
Lessig, currently on sabbatical in Berlin, has
backed this movement, advocating the de
criminali/.ation of file sharing and a legal re
definition of intellectual property under what
he calls the "Creative Commons," a more
limited and artist defined notion of copyright
that makes cultural products freely available
while still securing a sense of ownership and
commercial reward for the producer. Lessig
has argued that inflexible copyright laws
come at the expense of both the artist and the
consumer.Though Lessig could not be
reached for comment for this editori
al, he has gone on the record in the NY
Times as saying that "the freedom to
remix, not just words, but culture" is
essential to continued creative devel
opment.
Unfortunately, until legal head
way is made, the University must
abide by copyright statute unless it
wishes to open itself up to legal ac
tion. In 2(X)3, Provost Etchemendy
outlined the policy in a statement to
the university community, pressing
that "Stanford is committed to facili
tating access to information through
its computer networks as part of its
mission to pursue research and cre
ate knowledge. However, the Uni
versity's research and teaching mis
sion also depends on respect for the
rights of intellectual property and the

university will not facilitate the pirat
ing of intellectual property through
its computer networks." He further
warned that "sharing music, videos,
software and other copyrighted ma
terial in violation of copyright laws
can expose you and others to legal
sanctions, as well as sanctions under
Stanford's policies."
Such a policy makes good sense,
for the moment. If the University
were seen to endorse copyright in
fringement. it could be subject to the
same kind of suit Grokster faced and
then lost 112 urther, illegal file sharing
can introduce spyware and viruses
into the University network. Howev
er, since it appears that many students
continue to engage in file sharing de
spite the University's best efforts, it
makes sense to provide a legal opt-out
alternative to students and faculty
such as Yahoo! Music Services.
Yahoo! Music, which was offered
for free to students last year and is
currently being offered at a reduced
rate, has its drawbacks. While file
sharing networks boast some 25 mil

lion files, there are no more than two
million files offered by any legal serv
ice and only just over a million of
fered by Yahoo. More problematical
ly, Yahoo does not operate on Macs
and users must pay extra fees to add
songs to portable music players. On
the plus side, it only costs about $20 a
year for unlimited downloads from a
wide selection of music, and if the uni
versity ran an opt-out program, stu
dents could choose whether or not to
take advantage of the service.
Yahoo! Music may or may not be
the best service currently available,
but it does serve as a good example of
an attractive option the university
could offer students to reduce the
amount of copyright infringement
and to promote a new culture of ex
change. Currently, models of P2P net
works are in development that will
allow for legal file exchange at mini
mal cost. It would be in the best inter
est of the University to explore such
services for the upcoming year and to
evaluate the possible benefits of of
fering students alternatives.

File sharing has been making big news in
the US ever since the advent of Napster
in June of 1999. While file sharing tech
nology is legal, the vast majority of multime
dia files being exchanged over peer-to-peer
(P2P) networks are copyrighted, making
>uch exchanges illegal under intellectual
property right laws. Since Napster's heyday,
album sales are down by thirty percent and
the film industry is losing an estimated $5.5
billion to movie piracy annually. Since 2(X)3.
the recording industry has sent thousands of
cease-and-desist letters to illegal file swap
pers the nation over and has thus far filed
suit against over 17,(MKJ people, including an
estimated 1 .(XX) students.
I"his year, the Supreme Court took up the
issue, unanimously ruling in the case of
MGM v. Grokster that creating new technol
ogy that enables copyright infringement is
not illegal, but that actively encouraging it is
It comes as little surprise then that sharing
copyrighted files is also still certified illegal.
That being the case, hardly anyone seems to
have noticed. Billions of files are being ex
changed over P2P networks every month
and while a new crop of paid services like
iTunes and Yahoo Music has emerged over
the last several years, the fact remains that
ten times as many songs are downloaded il
legally through P2P networks than through
all the paid services combined.
It seems that while many file sharers
would openly acknowledge that their activi
ty is illegal, few would describe their activity
as unethical or morally troubling. While the
recording industry (RIAA) has equated
downloading copyrighted files with lifting a
CD from a musician's rack, such a connec
tion is often lost on even the most casual
downloaded Misconceptions seem to arise
for two main reasons.
first, many independent musicians have
begun openly distributing their music on the

Internet. According to some copyright ex
perts. the large majority of artists lose very lit
tle from copyright infringement; it is the cor
porate labels and big name acts that lose the
most. In the face of rising album costs, few file
sharers have expressed sympathy for the
handlul of superstars and record execs that
stand to lose a small share of their millions.
Second, the Internet has, over the past
decade, revolutionized popular perceptions
about what constitutes intellectual property
rights and how intellectual property should be
distributed. In 2(X)o,Charles (\ Mann,a writer
tor the Atlantic Monthly, referred to the P2P
phenomenon as the "heavenly jukebox," a
"vast intellectual commons [where] nothing
will ever again be out of print or impossible to
find; every scrap of human culture tran
scribed. no matter how obscure or commer
cially unsuccessful will be available to all."
ITie growth of open source projects in
programming has furthered this notion of a
"heavenly jukebox." Under the open source
model, projects are made available to the
larger community to modify and redistribute
as it sees fit. The driving aim behind open
source is to reduce copyright restrictions and
cut costs to the consumer, opening up wide
spread public access to products and thereby
facilitating innovation and exchange.
Stanford I aw School professor Lawrence
Lessig, currently on sabbatical in Berlin, has
backed this movement, advocating the de
criminali/.ation of file sharing and a legal re
definition of intellectual property under what
he calls the "Creative Commons," a more
limited and artist defined notion of copyright
that makes cultural products freely available
while still securing a sense of ownership and
commercial reward for the producer. Lessig
has argued that inflexible copyright laws
come at the expense of both the artist and the
consumer.Though Lessig could not be
reached for comment for this editori
al, he has gone on the record in the NY
Times as saying that "the freedom to
remix, not just words, but culture" is
essential to continued creative devel
opment.
Unfortunately, until legal head
way is made, the University must
abide by copyright statute unless it
wishes to open itself up to legal ac
tion. In 2(X)3, Provost Etchemendy
outlined the policy in a statement to
the university community, pressing
that "Stanford is committed to facili
tating access to information through
its computer networks as part of its
mission to pursue research and cre
ate knowledge. However, the Uni
versity's research and teaching mis
sion also depends on respect for the
rights of intellectual property and the

university will not facilitate the pirat
ing of intellectual property through
its computer networks." He further
warned that "sharing music, videos,
software and other copyrighted ma
terial in violation of copyright laws
can expose you and others to legal
sanctions, as well as sanctions under
Stanford's policies."
Such a policy makes good sense,
for the moment. If the University
were seen to endorse copyright in
fringement. it could be subject to the
same kind of suit Grokster faced and
then lost 112 urther, illegal file sharing
can introduce spyware and viruses
into the University network. Howev
er, since it appears that many students
continue to engage in file sharing de
spite the University's best efforts, it
makes sense to provide a legal opt-out
alternative to students and faculty
such as Yahoo! Music Services.
Yahoo! Music, which was offered
for free to students last year and is
currently being offered at a reduced
rate, has its drawbacks. While file
sharing networks boast some 25 mil

lion files, there are no more than two
million files offered by any legal serv
ice and only just over a million of
fered by Yahoo. More problematical
ly, Yahoo does not operate on Macs
and users must pay extra fees to add
songs to portable music players. On
the plus side, it only costs about $20 a
year for unlimited downloads from a
wide selection of music, and if the uni
versity ran an opt-out program, stu
dents could choose whether or not to
take advantage of the service.
Yahoo! Music may or may not be
the best service currently available,
but it does serve as a good example of
an attractive option the university
could offer students to reduce the
amount of copyright infringement
and to promote a new culture of ex
change. Currently, models of P2P net
works are in development that will
allow for legal file exchange at mini
mal cost. It would be in the best inter
est of the University to explore such
services for the upcoming year and to
evaluate the possible benefits of of
