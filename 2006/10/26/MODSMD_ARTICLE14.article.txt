# The
						history of Stanford bicycling
## 
### 
When Stanford opened its doors in
1891, students' preferred mode of
transportation was the pogo stick.
Faculty members who worked on the Quad
grew displeased at the amount of bouncing
and bounce noises outside their offices, so
arcades were built over the walkways to
prevent pogo-ing. Only one student rode his
pogo in the arcades and he. of course, died
of a head injury.
March 19, 1892 was the first Big Game
against Cal, which Stanford won 14-10. At
this point, the football players were so cocky
they decided they were above pogo-ing and
bought horses, lliey got to class more quick
ly on horses and looked cooler doing it.
ITiere was always the risk that drunken Paly
kids might steal the horses at night, but they
were still the offensive line's first choice for
transportation.
in 1893, Leland Stanford, Sr. died. No
longer dominated by her United States Sen
ator husband, Jane Stanford hopped on the
bicycle barjdwagon as many liberated
women were doing in the 1890s. In fact.it was
during this time that hikes become known as
"freedom machines." As an emancipated
woman. Jane even bought cardinal-colored
bloomers with "Stanford" printed across the
ass to wear while cycling around campus.
In a matter of weeks, all of the Stanford
women had switched to bicycles.The football
team remained on horseback and the average
Stanford man kept to his pogo stick to make
up for other lacking qualities. It was around
this time that American men grew wary of the
newfound independence that the bicycle af
forded women. Doctors started spreading ru
mors that bicycles were bad for women's
health because the cycling motion promoted
masturbation. Back then, masturbation
caused blindness, gonorrhea and nighttime

"headaches" whenever husbands wanted sex.
Since male doctors were right about
everything (except that strychnine poison
ing caused Jane Stanford's death). Jane
began enjoying her daily hike rides even
more. She and hei husband were celibate for
the first IS years ot their marriage, conceived
little I eland and then continued their celiba
cy for the last 25 years. What Jane didn't
know was that during his eight years in the
Senate, I.eland had several young Congres
sional pages hard at work. He even ex
changed sexually explicit telegrams with
them. Ibis exertion mayor may not have led
to his untimely death at the age of 69, but it
certainly led to Jane's connubial neglect.
In the 1910s, I lenry l ord made horses ob
solete. l-ootball players started driving
Model I \ to class. The administration was
forced to put up bollards to reduce the num
ber ol dead squirrels lying about the Quad.
Bollard jumping became the number one
cause of pogo stick injury. It was clear, there
lore, that bicycles would he the best mode of
transportation for all. In 1915, to signal the
end ot the horse era, ichthyologist and eu
genicist David Starr Jordan, chancellor of
the University at the time, had Leland Sr.'s
favorite horse, I lectioneer.dipped in bronze
and placed in front of the Red Barn.
