# The 						history of Stanford bicycling
## 
### 
When Stanford opened its doors in
1891, students' preferred mode of
transportation was the pogo stick.
Faculty members who worked on the Quad
grew displeased at the amount of bouncing
and bounce noises outside their offices, so
arcades were built over the walkways to
prevent pogo-ing. Only one student rode his
pogo in the arcades and he. of course, died
of a head injury.
March 19, 1892 was the first Big Game
against Cal, which Stanford won 14-10. At
this point, the football players were so cocky
they decided they were above pogo-ing and
bought horses, lliey got to class more quick
ly on horses and looked cooler doing it.
ITiere was always the risk that drunken Paly
kids might steal the horses at night, but they
were still the offensive line's first choice for
transportation.
in 1893, Leland Stanford, Sr. died. No
longer dominated by her United States Sen
ator husband, Jane Stanford hopped on the
bicycle barjdwagon as many liberated
women were doing in the 1890s. In fact.it was
during this time that hikes become known as
"freedom machines." As an emancipated
woman. Jane even bought cardinal-colored
bloomers with "Stanford" printed across the
ass to wear while cycling around campus.
In a matter of weeks, all of the Stanford
women had switched to bicycles.The football
team remained on horseback and the average
Stanford man kept to his pogo stick to make
up for other lacking qualities. It was around
this time that American men grew wary of the
newfound independence that the bicycle af
forded women. Doctors started spreading ru
mors that bicycles were bad for women's
health because the cycling motion promoted
masturbation. Back then, masturbation
caused blindness, gonorrhea and nighttime

"headaches" whenever husbands wanted sex.
Since male doctors were right about
everything (except that strychnine poison
ing caused Jane Stanford's death). Jane
began enjoying her daily hike rides even
more. She and hei husband were celibate for
the first IS years ot their marriage, conceived
little I eland and then continued their celiba
cy for the last 25 years. What Jane didn't
know was that during his eight years in the
Senate, I.eland had several young Congres
sional pages hard at work. He even ex
changed sexually explicit telegrams with
them. Ibis exertion mayor may not have led
to his untimely death at the age of 69, but it
certainly led to Jane's connubial neglect.
In the 1910s, I lenry l ord made horses ob
solete. l-ootball players started driving
Model I \ to class. The administration was
forced to put up bollards to reduce the num
ber ol dead squirrels lying about the Quad.
Bollard jumping became the number one
cause of pogo stick injury. It was clear, there
lore, that bicycles would he the best mode of
transportation for all. In 1915, to signal the
end ot the horse era, ichthyologist and eu
genicist David Starr Jordan, chancellor of
the University at the time, had Leland Sr.'s
favorite horse, I lectioneer.dipped in bronze
and placed in front of the Red Barn.

History of Stanford,
1891-2006
By the early 19305, bicycles were
so popular that F. Scott Fitzgerald's
"lender is the Night" was the book
upon which the very first IHUM.
"The Human and the Machine,"
a.k.a. "Dick Diver, You a Bicycling
Dick," was based in 1933. (See
Robert Wexelblatt,"F. Scott Fitzger
ald and D. H. Lawrence: Bicycles and
Incest." American Literature, Vol.
59, No. 3. (Oct.. 1987), pp. 378-388.]
In the 1950s.bicycles, which were
used instead of cars in the Soviet
Union, China, North Korea, Cuba
and Mississippi, were seen as a com
munistic influence. They were
banned from campus.
Bicycles use no gasoline, which is
why riding them in the arcades
would be like letting the terrorists

win. It wasn't with this in mind that
the Stanford administration institut
ed a bike ban in Sept. 2006.
In the same spirit of social ac
tivism displayed in the 19605, some
Stanford students tried to almost,
sort of, not really hold a bike protest
yesterday, Oct. 26,2006. by planning
to park their bikes in solidarity on
the Ouad — as if to say. "Fuck you
professors trying to exit your offices,
fuck you blind students who trip
over our bikes, or students who can't
get to the handicapped-labeled au
tomatic button door opener because
we parked our bike in front of it and
fuck you Mark Foley for taking at
tention away from real issues, like
the serious denial of basic rights to
us — Stanford students — the most
wronged group in the world."
