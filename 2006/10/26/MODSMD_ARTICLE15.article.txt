A critical note on Khoury
Regarding Editor Khoury's speech at
Stanford. I note that Khoury did not men
tion the blogosphere's role in finding nu
merous examples of biased reporting
against Israel. Littlegreenfootballs.com and
a few sites documented examples of pic
tures that were photo-shopped or manufac
tured as overt propaganda — and then pub
lished by major media.
As far as one writer's claim that "there is
an urgent need for political resolution."
what is this person talking about? Ihe right
of Hezbollah to take hostages and to try to
trade them for terrorists? Lebanon has no
political claims on Israel, but can't say so be
cause its government remains hostage to an

independent militia that continues to
threaten the freedom of every Lebanese cit
izen.
ITie two issues are related because 1 do
not believe Klioury is truly free,as an editor,
to express any opinion. Because of militias
within his area and the physical threat to his
paper, he cannot say what he really thinks
about the Hezbollah, lie is the Lebanese
equivalent of the old editor of the Soviet
news service "Pravda." I hat may sound
harsh, and Klioury may be doing his best
under the circumstances, but anything he
savs. Irankly. has to be taken with a train of
sait.
