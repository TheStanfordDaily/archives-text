# 'Til June do us part
## 
### 
It's the end of October and the honey
moon is over. No matter how much you
loved your roommate five weeks ago. the
dirty socks on the floor and the glass of milk
turned-yogurt on the bookshelf have a way
of betraying the reality: married life is hard.
There was a time not so long ago when you
enjoyed the blissful life of bachelorhood in
your parents' house. But a real mattress with
a desk more than two feet away is just one of
the minor sacrifices of the college experience.
The real loss is that of your single status.
Initially, the University takes it upon itself
to work as a matchmaker. Remember that
roommate survey you filled out? The one
where you said you went to bed between 10
p.m. and midnight? Those ridiculously deflat
ed numbers may have fallen by the wayside
upon arrival on the Farm, but they were the
rationale by which you were paired with your
year-long soul mate.
Although the freshman matchmakers do
their best, nearly every resulting couple has a
few stories that will go down in infamy. When
I arrived at Larkin 200 for the first time, I
found an open suitcase, a clothes-strewn
floor and a bed with a single, twisted sheet
draped over half of it. My lucky international
roommate had "moved in" to our room sev
eral days before freshman orientation.
I was willing to take the untouched corner
of the room, but there were bigger and better
stories ahead. Hie milk-turned-yogurt men
tioned above made its appearance mid-way
through October, and by then I'd become ac
customed to the 8 a.m. calls from her parents
on Sunday mornings (off-peak rates trump
time difference every time — and this was in
the days before cell phones, mind you).
Sharing a bedroom — if a lOxlOsquare in
Stern counts as such — with another living,
breathing, mess-creating person is certainly
stressful, but there are many positive aspects
to the roommate-marriage. For starters, cou
ple-hood may be the best teacher you en
counter at Stanford. You soon learn that
"clean" has a wide variety of definitions,
ranging from "no clothes on the floor" to
"fully vacuumed." "Bedtime" and "quiet"
also mean different things to different peo
ple, running the gamut from midnight to 5
a.m.. dead silent to low-volume heavy metal.
In addition to learning your spouse's na-

tive language, your unique union also gives
you the opportunity to observe a large num
ber of basic psychological phenomena. Some
confused souls simply cannot discern the dif
ference between your dresser and theirs,
while others, myself included, have an affini
ty for order closely resembling mild OCD. If
you think this is an overstatement, just ask
my sophomore roommate what happened
after she moved my candle from its place in
the middle of our coffee table — for the
tenth time.
Hut these difficulties can be negotiated.
Keeping your favorite shirt in the backseat of
your car or sleeping with earplugs and an
eye-mask are small concessions compared to
those required of the end-all-be-all room
mate challenge of the Sexile. This situation
raises the painful truth that, at least after five
beers and a tough week of mid-terms, some
one else is more important to your significant
other than you. It also means you get to
spend the night in the lounge.
With the wisdom and experience gained
from your freshman year liaison, the Univer
sity trusts you have the maturity to choose
your future partners. This freedom, of course,
brings with it a new set of issues, as most
drawmates are not just acquaintances but
good friends. 'ITius, there is much more at
stake; whoever said it was better to be friends
first has clearly never lived with someone.
For starters, the space you share is usually
even smaller than your former Wilbur cube.
Whether you're sharing the quint in Bob or
the classic two-room triple, more people in
less space means more issues more often.
And in case you're fantasizing about next
year in 680. neither room of the two-room
double has it easy (walking in versus being
walked in on — take your pick).
In addition to the lack of physical space,
good friends who live together also have less

emotional space. Iliis may he a bigger issue
for girls, but it is unquestionably harder to es
cape the daily social drama when part of its
root cause sleeps in the twin above you.
When the lack of physical and emotional
space doesn't disrupt the union, a few risk
takers have even been known to take on an
infamous relationship strain: offspring. In
the middle of sophomore year, my friends
Mike and Phil made the ambitious decision
to purchase two guinea pigs. Named "Mipe"
and "Phim," the hybrid-named pets were
golden children — until Mike went abroad
junior year. Phil decided he couldn't take
care of them on his own and a third party had
to take them to the pound. (Phil couldn't
bring himself to do it).
Aside from not adopting pets (which are.
by the way, technically not allowed in Stan
ford dorms), there are a few things you can
do to avoid drama. As someone who still
owns the futon 1 bought at the end of fresh
man year. 1 highly recommend making indi
vidual purchases when you co-decorate. It
may be easier and cheaper to split the cost
now. but it will be much harder in June when
you're arguing over the microwave.
1 would also recommend drawing up a pre
nup. in which everyone voices and writes
down expectations for cleaning, common
purchases, etc.The process may seem a bit te
dious now. but just ask Paul McCartney: it's
worth it in the long run.
Ot course,for all of its struggles, the room
mate-marriage has many redeeming quali
ties. No one will ever know you as well as the
person who sees you not only when you first
wake up but also after back-to-back all
nighters. To this day. I get nostalgic when I
smell the perfume worn by my roommate
from junior year or the cinnamon-vanilla
candles my last roommate loved. For every
time 1 complained. "You never take out the
trash! there were countless times when they
made me laugh, let me cry and listened pa
tiently to my latest male drama. One even
woke up at 7 a.m. to do my make-up before
my first big interview. If that's not true love, I
don't know what is.

112 Pearls of wisdom
It's the end of October and the honey
moon is over. No matter how much you
loved your roommate five weeks ago. the
dirty socks on the floor and the glass of milk
turned-yogurt on the bookshelf have a way
of betraying the reality: married life is hard.
There was a time not so long ago when you
enjoyed the blissful life of bachelorhood in
your parents' house. But a real mattress with
a desk more than two feet away is just one of
the minor sacrifices of the college experience.
The real loss is that of your single status.
Initially, the University takes it upon itself
to work as a matchmaker. Remember that
roommate survey you filled out? The one
where you said you went to bed between 10
p.m. and midnight? Those ridiculously deflat
ed numbers may have fallen by the wayside
upon arrival on the Farm, but they were the
rationale by which you were paired with your
year-long soul mate.
Although the freshman matchmakers do
their best, nearly every resulting couple has a
few stories that will go down in infamy. When
I arrived at Larkin 200 for the first time, I
found an open suitcase, a clothes-strewn
floor and a bed with a single, twisted sheet
draped over half of it. My lucky international
roommate had "moved in" to our room sev
eral days before freshman orientation.
I was willing to take the untouched corner
of the room, but there were bigger and better
stories ahead. Hie milk-turned-yogurt men
tioned above made its appearance mid-way
through October, and by then I'd become ac
customed to the 8 a.m. calls from her parents
on Sunday mornings (off-peak rates trump
time difference every time — and this was in
the days before cell phones, mind you).
Sharing a bedroom — if a lOxlOsquare in
Stern counts as such — with another living,
breathing, mess-creating person is certainly
stressful, but there are many positive aspects
to the roommate-marriage. For starters, cou
ple-hood may be the best teacher you en
counter at Stanford. You soon learn that
"clean" has a wide variety of definitions,
ranging from "no clothes on the floor" to
"fully vacuumed." "Bedtime" and "quiet"
also mean different things to different peo
ple, running the gamut from midnight to 5
a.m.. dead silent to low-volume heavy metal.
In addition to learning your spouse's na-

tive language, your unique union also gives
you the opportunity to observe a large num
ber of basic psychological phenomena. Some
confused souls simply cannot discern the dif
ference between your dresser and theirs,
while others, myself included, have an affini
ty for order closely resembling mild OCD. If
you think this is an overstatement, just ask
my sophomore roommate what happened
after she moved my candle from its place in
the middle of our coffee table — for the
tenth time.
Hut these difficulties can be negotiated.
Keeping your favorite shirt in the backseat of
your car or sleeping with earplugs and an
eye-mask are small concessions compared to
those required of the end-all-be-all room
mate challenge of the Sexile. This situation
raises the painful truth that, at least after five
beers and a tough week of mid-terms, some
one else is more important to your significant
other than you. It also means you get to
spend the night in the lounge.
With the wisdom and experience gained
from your freshman year liaison, the Univer
sity trusts you have the maturity to choose
your future partners. This freedom, of course,
brings with it a new set of issues, as most
drawmates are not just acquaintances but
good friends. 'ITius, there is much more at
stake; whoever said it was better to be friends
first has clearly never lived with someone.
For starters, the space you share is usually
even smaller than your former Wilbur cube.
Whether you're sharing the quint in Bob or
the classic two-room triple, more people in
less space means more issues more often.
And in case you're fantasizing about next
year in 680. neither room of the two-room
double has it easy (walking in versus being
walked in on — take your pick).
In addition to the lack of physical space,
good friends who live together also have less

emotional space. Iliis may he a bigger issue
for girls, but it is unquestionably harder to es
cape the daily social drama when part of its
root cause sleeps in the twin above you.
When the lack of physical and emotional
space doesn't disrupt the union, a few risk
takers have even been known to take on an
infamous relationship strain: offspring. In
the middle of sophomore year, my friends
Mike and Phil made the ambitious decision
to purchase two guinea pigs. Named "Mipe"
and "Phim," the hybrid-named pets were
golden children — until Mike went abroad
junior year. Phil decided he couldn't take
care of them on his own and a third party had
to take them to the pound. (Phil couldn't
bring himself to do it).
Aside from not adopting pets (which are.
by the way, technically not allowed in Stan
ford dorms), there are a few things you can
do to avoid drama. As someone who still
owns the futon 1 bought at the end of fresh
man year. 1 highly recommend making indi
vidual purchases when you co-decorate. It
may be easier and cheaper to split the cost
now. but it will be much harder in June when
you're arguing over the microwave.
