# The 						Public Editor
## 
### 
An exciting development inThe Daily's
Web site has been the introduction of
a feature at the end of each article
that enables readers to post comments. In the
past, if readers wanted to respond to an arti
cle, they had to submit a letter to the editor,
with no guarantee that this letter would be
selected for publication, and the understand
ing that the letter would be edited both for
clarity and for content. Ilie Web site's new
feature allows readers to respond to articles
immediately and without any kind of screen
ing process, resulting in an unmediated and
sometimes contentious dialogue that can be
an excellent means of directing accusations
against Ibe Daily.
In my experience working at The Daily,
nothing has been as consistently inflammatory
and capable of sparking numerous op-eds and
letters to the editor than coverage of speakers
or events relating to the Israeli/Palestinian
conflict. Sometimes it felt as though the Opin
ions page would never need to worry about
copy again, so inundated would the editors be
with indignant submissions.
While this year's editors so far have not
received quite the deluge of emails that cov
erage of a controversial Middle Eastern
speaker sometimes sparks, there have still

been enough responses to Tuesday's article,
"Editor: U.S. media favors Israel," that it
seems worth addressing just how The Daily
goes about choosing what to cover, and to
clear up some concerns and questions of bias
that have been raised by readers.
At its essence. Ilie Daily's policy is to cover
speaker events that either feature prominent
figures that many students have heard of. have
a high anticipated attendance or are spon
sored by a large campus group. Admittedly,
this policy is somewhat vague and subject to
editorial discretion. The main constraint on
The Daily's coverage of speaker events, how
ever, is its very limited number of reporters. I
remember all too well from my days as a news
editor how it was nearly impossible to find a
writer to attend a speaker event on a week
night. particularly during midterm season
(which, we all know, covers a period falling
roughly between Week Two and Dead Week).
In general, it is the nightly news editor's re
sponsibility to attend the event and write the
article if he or she fails to assign the job to
someone else. In practice, however, this isn't
always possible — the news editor's primary
responsibility is to ensure that there is a news
section in the paper the next morning, so his
efforts must first and foremost go toward

this. ITic result is that sometimes, regrettably,
speakers or events don't get covered. The
takeaway point here is that more people
should write for The Daily.
Monday night s talk by Rami Khouri, edi
tor-at-large of the Lebanese Star, was a signif
icantly-sized event attended by around 80
people, rhe subsequent article that has
sparked debate online and in print was an im
paitial account ol some of what was said both
in the talk and the question-and-answer ses
sion. 1 can see no evidence of editorializing in
the at tide itselt. For those angered by the one
sidedness, please remember not to shoot the
messenger. ITie Daily's duty is to report the
facts of what happened, and as far as I can see,
it did so. An editor even tried, though unsuc
cessfully, to get in touch with Hillel on Mon
day night to get its perspective on the talk.
There are also those who charge that The
Daily s alleged bias comes through not so much
in liiesday s article itself as in its decision to cover
that event while not covering similar events by Is
raeli or Jewish speakers. ITie Daily receives the
opposite critique from the other side when it cov
ers (as it docs) similar events by Israeli or Jewish
speakers. TTiis dissatisfaction is simply a conse-
quence of the nature of the divide on
the Israeli/Palestinian issue, it seems.
From what I have seen in my four-plus
years at lhe Daily, the paper does not
give more aiverage to one side than the
other — and if it somehow does, this is
certainly not a conscious decision.
Rather, it is merely a result of the
paper's limited resources.
The Daily aims to highlight the
ongoing deates regarding the sensi
tive and. for many students, personal
issues involved in the Israeli/Pales
tinian conflict (and related Middle
Eastern concerns) by running multi
ple articles throughout the year that
cover both sides' viewpoints. Ideally,
balance is achieved in this manner.
While it is still too early to be able to
judge if this equilibrium will ulti
mately result this year, hopefully
readers can give the paper the bene
fit of the doubt.

paitial account ol some of what was said both
in the talk and the question-and-answer ses
sion. 1 can see no evidence of editorializing in
the at tide itselt. For those angered by the one
sidedness, please remember not to shoot the
messenger. ITie Daily's duty is to report the
facts of what happened, and as far as I can see,
it did so. An editor even tried, though unsuc
cessfully, to get in touch with Hillel on Mon
day night to get its perspective on the talk.
There are also those who charge that The
Daily s alleged bias comes through not so much
in liiesday s article itself as in its decision to cover
that event while not covering similar events by Is
raeli or Jewish speakers. ITie Daily receives the
opposite critique from the other side when it cov
ers (as it docs) similar events by Israeli or Jewish
speakers. TTiis dissatisfaction is simply a conse-
quence of the nature of the divide on
the Israeli/Palestinian issue, it seems.
From what I have seen in my four-plus
years at lhe Daily, the paper does not
give more aiverage to one side than the
other — and if it somehow does, this is
certainly not a conscious decision.
Rather, it is merely a result of the
paper's limited resources.
The Daily aims to highlight the
ongoing deates regarding the sensi
tive and. for many students, personal
issues involved in the Israeli/Pales
tinian conflict (and related Middle
Eastern concerns) by running multi
ple articles throughout the year that
cover both sides' viewpoints. Ideally,
balance is achieved in this manner.
While it is still too early to be able to
judge if this equilibrium will ulti
mately result this year, hopefully
readers can give the paper the bene
fit of the doubt.
