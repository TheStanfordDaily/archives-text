## Salisbury Prevent D prevents victory 
### 
The prevent defense. It's some
thing that I'm sure many of
you have seen throughout
your gaming ventures in the "Mad
den." "Tecmo Super Bowl" or "NFL
Blitz" series. This passive defense,
which coaches often employ as a
means of securing a game in the final
moments against a desperate of
fense, in a word, sucks. It stands for
the strategy of passivity in football,
the counterintuitive notion of play
ing not to lose instead of playing to
win.
This meekness reared its ugly
head in a notable match-up between
UCLA and Notre Dame this past
Saturday.
In front of a pro-Irish crowd in
South Bend. Ind., the Bruins had
Notre Dame on the ropes for most of
the game. UCLA had led for the en
tire second half and their defense
was effective in stifling Notre
Dame's superstar trio of running
back Darius Walker, wide receiver
Jeff Samardzija and Heisman candi
date/pretty-boy quarterback Brady
Quinn. UCLA coach Karl Dorrell
was on the verge of a momentous vic
tory for his program.
With a little over two minutes re
maining in the game, the Bruins,
nursing a 17-13 lead, had the ball at
their own 35-yard line on first down.
Ten yards for UCLA would seal the
game. Dorrell was going to finally es
tablish himself and vanquish all the
doubts that had loomed over his pro
gram since his first season in 2004.
Ten yards. That's all he needed.
So, what did Dorrell do? He
called three unimaginative run plays
up the middle, and UCLA subse
quently punted the ball back to the
Irish. Quinn rallied his Irish from
their own 20-yard line for an 80-yard
touchdown drive in less than a
minute. 20-17 Notre Dame — game
over.
What was Dorrell thinking? Well,
he was playing not to lose. He decid
ed to take the careful route, running
three plays up the middle to unequiv
ocally prevent the possibility of a
turnover, forgetting that sophomore
quarterback Patrick Cowan had al
ready shown impressive poise and
composure in front of the hostile
Irish crowd. Dorrell just couldn't
bring himself to take the risk of
throwing the football.
On the other side of the ball, the
Bruins reverted to the prevent de
fense. They dropped everyone back,
leaving only three linemen to rush
Quinn.The Irish quarterback had an
eternity in the pocket on his game
winning pass to Samardzija in what
turned out to be a busted play.
UCLA had all the receivers cov
ered. but because Quinn had
enough time to heat himself up a TV
dinner while he stood in the pocket
searching for a receiver, Samardzija
broke free and ultimately dashed 45
yards for the victory.
It's pretty clear what happened.
As a coach. Dorrell took the easy
way out. I le decided to play it safe.
I le ran the ball, instead of throwing,
and employed the prevent defense,
which ironically prevented his team
from winning.
Football is a sport that takes guts
a coach has to have the kind of at
titude that winning is much more
important than not losing. That's
how I learned that Cal coach Jeff
Tedford (ugh) was for real. I recall
watching one of the Golden Bears'
games a few years back when Cal
had the ball in a similar situation.
Everyone in the stands was expect
ing Tedford to call running back
Marshawn Lynch's number. It only
made sense. But instead, he sent
quarterback Aaron Rodgers on a
bootleg,who threw to his wide open
tight end, and the Bears clinched the
game.
It's that kind of fortitude that
wins ballgames. Sure, the play could
have failed, and the media would
have gone after Tedford in the ensu
ing press conference. But that never
entered his mind when he made the
play call, lie took a calculated risk.
1 le was thinking about winning.
Say what you want about Tedford
(he does coach at Cal. after all), but
the man knows his football, and he
knows how to win. A huge part of
knowing how to win is being able to
go for the jugular. Unfortunately,
when you take a look around the
country (ahem — Karl Dorrell and
Mike Shula), many coaches don't
possess this trait.
Which brings me back to my
point. Football, and sports in gener
al. cannot be played counterintu
itively. You can't play not to lose —
otherwise, you'll never win.
I guess that a broader, universal
imperative can be drawn from this.
In life.the JeffTedfords will beat the
Karl Dorrells every day of the week
and twice on Saturdays. And as for
the Walt I lai rises of the world...
Let's not go there.
