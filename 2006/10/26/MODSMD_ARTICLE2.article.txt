# ON THE ATTACK
## Stanford travels to Arizona to play 'Cats and Devils 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team has endured a long and strenu
ous journey through the first half of
conference play and it doesn't look to
be getting any easier down the
stretch. But despite the tough compe
tition and the physical and mental toll
of being student-athletes, the No. 3
Cardinal sit atop the Pacific-10 Con
ference standings at the midway
point.
With just a single loss to No. 6
Washington and seven straight con
ference wins, Stanford (17-2.8-1 Pac
-10) heads to Arizona this weekend
ready to start its final push to the
postseason. While their classmates
worry about midterms, the players
have even more on their minds.
"We are still trying hard to im
prove our health and it has gotten to
the point in the season when school is
pretty tough," Head Coach John
Dunning said. "We are trying to do
the best we can and give the players
the time to do everything, but it is def
initely challenging right now."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal are
more than ready to close out the Pac
-10 season strong and carry that mo
mentum into the postseason. Stan
ford was picked to finish first in the
conference in the preseason coaches'
poll and is currently tied with No. 4
UCLA for the top spot.
"At this point in the season, every
body gets run-down, but we have
great depth." Dunning said. "So if
someone is tired or has aches and
pains, there is someone else ready to
step in and do their job. That is one
advantage for us in the second half of
the season — we have so many expe
rienced people ready to play."
Stanford will have the opportuni
ty to use that depth on the road this
weekend as they take on Arizona
State (11-9,3-6) and Arizona (10-11,
1-8), two teams that the Cardinal
swept at home early in the confer
ence season.
After losing five conference
matches in a row, the Sun Devils have
now won two of their last three,
sweeping Oregon State and winning
in four against Washington State.
Nicole Morton leads the offense with
251 kills and Staci Smith is hitting a
team-high .297 on the season. Marina
Mercer has — appropriately enough
for the weekend before Halloween
— 666 assists. Libero Sydney Don
ahue's 494 digs, at a rate of 6.86 per
game, put her second in the nation.
"One player who has done a very
good job against us in the past is Nina
Reeves, their right side hitter," Dun
ning said. "I think she had 11 kills in
the first two games against us and she
really kept them in the game from the
back row and the front. And. of
course, they have one of the better
liberos in the country."
Arizona State made the Cardinal
work for their victory in September,
but Stanford held on to win in three
games. The Sun Devils came within
three points of taking the first game,
but the Cardinal's superior hitting
made the difference down the
stretch.
"ASU has really stepped up their
play to another level and they are a
much better team than they have
been in the past," Dunning said.

"They did not win last weekend, so I
know they will be psyched up to play
us."
After Friday's match in Tempo, the
Cardinal will head to Tucson for a
matchup with Arizona. Ilie Wildcats
have struggled in 2006 and. after being a
top-10 team last year, have managed
only a single conference win — a four
game victory against Oregon State two
weeks ago.
When the Wildcats played at Maples

Pavilion in the second week of the Pac
-10 season, the hard-fought first game
ended in Stanford's favor, 35-33. The
Cardinal powered to victory, allowing
Arizona only 35 points total in the last
two games.
Brooke Buringrud. who led her team
with 15 kills against Stanford, spear
heads the Wildcats offense with 288 kills.
Middle blocker Dominique Lamb is
third with 191 kills and has posted team
highs in hitting percentage (.312) and

blocks (118). Setter Stephanie Butkus
has dished out 867 assists and libero
Brittany Leonard leads with 282 digs.
"The one girl who really hurt us last
time was Brooke Buringrud. She played
very well and we did not block very well
against her. She is definitely one that we
will be looking out for," Dunning said.
"And Dominique Lamb is pretty high
up in the statistics in the conference. She
had a good year last year and is very
good again."

With the second half of conference
play set to begin, the end is in sight for
the Cardinal. As has been the theme all
season, there is no such thing as an easy
win in the Pac-10 — especially on the
road. Stanford will need to fight, even
against teams at the bottom of the
standings.
"Arizona went to four games with
Washington last week," Dunning said.
"Any time you go on the road in this
conference, it is always so tough."
