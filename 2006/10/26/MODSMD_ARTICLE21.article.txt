# Upcoming opponents do battle in Corvallis
## Cardinal hoping to get insight into future toes when USC, Oregon State meet in Pac-10 matchup 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford fans will have to wait a
week for their Cardinal to return to
action as the team completes its bye
week. But that's not to say that
there aren't some intriguing Pac-10
match ups with interesting ramifi
cations for Stanford.
This weekend, the final two op
ponents Cardinal fans will have a
chance to see at the new Stanford
Stadium will square off in Corvallis.
Ore., as undefeated No. 3 USC (6-0.
4-0 Pac-10) faces Oregon State (4-3,
2-2). Interestingly, the Beavers and
Trojans may represent, respective
ly, the best and worst chances for a
victory remaining on Stanford's (0-
8.0-5) schedule.
USC will travel to Stanford next
Saturday as the Cardinal will be
greeted by arguably the most tal
ented team in the Pac-10. The Tro
jans have dealt with the loss of key
players to graduation and the draft
— including quarterback Matt
Leinart. runningbacks Reggie Bush
and LenDale White and safety Dar
nell Bing — remarkably well this
season. Despite having won a num
ber of games by uncharacteristical
ly narrow margins, they still have
yet to be defeated in the 2006 sea
son.
Perhaps the most significant sign
that the Trojans are still a force to
be reckoned with — not just in the
Pac-10 but the BCS as well — is
that coach Pete Carroll isn't satis
fied with an undefeated record
when it is accompanied by less than
dazzling outcomes. The Trojans
have won their past three games
against Washington, Arizona Stats
and Washington State by an aver

Oregon State runningback Yvenson Bernard has been a key component of the Beavers' attack this season. Bernard, hobbled by an ankle injury, may miss

age of only 6.33 points. Carroll ac
knowledged his frustration with his
team's inability to put the competi
tion away in recent weeks.
"I think I'm always impatient,"
Carroll said Tuesday in his weekly
press conference. "That's charac
teristic. We're always trying to find
better ways to do things and do
more and all that. 1 think that's just
part of it. [But] 1 have been pleased
with our ability to win the games
that we've won.
"I've looked at the matchups
and the games and how they were
played and what happened," he
continued. "1 don't think we were
lucky at all. I think we were able to
finish games the way we want to
finish them. 1 think we're doing it
well and 1 think thiit's part of what
this game is about."
Meanwhile, the Beavers are
limping into their contest with the
Trojans, as star runningback Yven
son Bernard may have to sit out
with an ankle injury. Bernard has
rushed for 746 yards and seven
touchdowns this season, and his ab
sence would be a huge blow to any
chance Oregon State has of pulling
off the upset. Moreover. Oregon
State coach Mike Riley said he still
regards the Trojans as among the
best in the country.
"Oh gosh. I've been impressed."
Riley said at a press conference
earlier this week. "The fact of the
matter is. when you're like USC —
been undefeated and been up at the
top of the nation for the last few

years — everybody is going to give
you their best shot. I think some
times. people forget that they've
been in some closer games but
they've withstood the challenges
and won the games and that's the
key. They do it impressively."
USC. on the other hand, appears
to be gearing up for a late-season
push, as the team on the whole
looks to be getting healthier.
"The kids are enthused about it
and feel a little better, getting a lit
tle stronger and healthier than
we've been," Carroll said. "We rest
ed guvs last week that helped us
feel a little bit better about our
selves and hopefully, we can hold
on to that and get going and get a
little momentum going here in the
second half beginning with this
Pac-10 match-up."
For the Cardinal, there can be
little doubt that neither opponent
will be an easy matchup. Now past
the midseason mark. Stanford
coach Walt Harris was quoted in
Wednesday's San Francisco Chron
icle as saying his team can't afford
to worry about going winless for
the season.
"I can't really get into their
minds, and with a young football
team, sometimes the focus be
comes bigger, rather than finite and
smaller," Harris said. "We need to
fine-tune our focus, so they are not
to be concerned about anything
else beyond [the next] play. I'll
make sure it's something 1 address
with them. Our focus has to be on
this play, not the next play, the last
play or the game down the road."
Pac-10 fans can see the USC-
Oregon State game on FSN Bay
Area. Kickoff is scheduled for
12:30 PST.
