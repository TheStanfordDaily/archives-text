nual wrestle-offs. It is likely that only four of 10
weight classes will be uncontested as the team moves
into the 2006-2007 season.

weight classes. At 133 pounds, redshirt freshman
Matt Kim takes on true freshman Cameron Teitel
man, and at 184 pounds Zack Giesen will square olt
against Jake Johnson in a battle ot true freshmen.
Meanwhile, at 165 pounds junior
Scott Loescher will face newly-niint

hand, sees a key contributor from
last season taking on a team captain
to fill the vacancy in the lineup left by

things happen with the program this
year," McCoy said. "I learned a lot in
my first year. As a second-year head
coach. 1 have a much better idea of
what to expect and that will make it
easier to achieve our goals. We are
ready to make Stanford the best pro
