# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Polo tries to stay on winning path Long Beach State, UC-Santa Cruz up next for No. 4 Hard 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN 
The Stanford men's water polo team
will host conference-rival No. 14 Long
Beach State on Saturday before traveling
to face UC-Santa Cruz in an away match
on Sunday to complete their weekend
double-header. Coming off a four-game
win streak, the No. 4 Cardinal squad looks
to carry momentum into its first home
game in five weeks.
"The team is excited to be at home and

play in front of the home crowd," head
coach John Vargas said. "We definitely feed
off the energy of the Stanford students, and
it's good to be back in our stadium."
Last weekend, the team collected two
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation wins
against No. 11 Pepperdine and No. 9 UC-
Santa Barbara. The Cardinal faced Pep
perdine for the second time in six days and
won an 8-6 decision at the Raleigh Run
nels Memorial Pool. Stanford was aided in
the win by two goals each from junior
Michael Bury, freshman Drac Wigo, and
senior Tyler Drake.
The next day, freshman Janson Wigo
lifted Stanford to an 11-10 double-over
time, sudden-death victory with a dramat

ic skip shot past UCSB goalkeeper Rick
Wright â€” completing his hat-trick for the
match. His two goals in the fourth quarter
helped to force the decisive overtime.
Despite the Cardinal's 10-game win
streak against Long Beach State, including
a recent 10-7 victory at the SoCal Open.
Vargas does not believe that his team's
dominance over the 49ers will guarantee a
win.
"Saturday is a conference game, and
each one of them is important because it
sets the seeding for the end of the season."
Vargas said. "What comes into play is that
it's a conference match, and that we will be
prepared for a battle. We can't take
any conference team lightly."
line Cardinal are currently 11-5
overall and 3-1 in the MPSF stand
ings, second to Southern California,
who boast a 17-game win streak.
Long Beach State is 5-11 overall
with a 0-3 MPSF record and is last in
the conference.
The 49ers suffered two home loss
es to No. 2 California and No. 6 Pacif
ic last weekend and are 1-5 in their
last six games. The match against
Long Beach State will be on Saturday
at noon at the Avery Aquatic Center.
Following the home match, the
Cardinal will travel to Santa Cruz,
Calif, to face the 5-15 Banana Slugs.
After facing and defeating many
ranked opponents, Vargas believes
that the team is primed to compete
against the best of the best.
"We're playing really good team
water polo right now. Players are
stepping up when the team needs
them to do so," Vargas said.
Vargas also mentioned senior J.J.
Garton and juniors Ryan Fortune
and Forrest Schwartz as key players
during their streak.
"Right now, those players [Gar
ton. Fortune, and Schwartz] are
playing really good defense for our
team," Vargas said. "Garton hasn't
scored as much, but he makes up for
it on the defensive end."
The results of this weekend's
matches will play a role in shaping
the conference standings heading
into a home matchup against No. 1
USC on Nov. 4.
