### YOUR EDITORS INTERMISSION ELITE 
There have been many things on our minds this
week: Being mad at The Daily (another story lor an
other time), midterms (it is midterm month), illness
(the plague has started again) - but really, we are
thinking about the elephant in the room.
Hold on — Brendan is checking
tradesports.com. But we are talking politics, not
sports. Everything was going so well: The presi
dent's approval rating was. well, better, former Rep
resentative Foley had proven that the Republican
Party was the true moral center of Congress and Bin
Laden was still hidden away in the foothills (we're
fighting him over there instead of here, right?).
There was even talk that the Democrats couldn't
shoot themselves in the foot this time around, that
they had to win at least one house of the legislative
branch. Here at Intermission, we are getting ner
vous. Can we really survive more two (or more)
years where you're either "with us or against us"? In
a country where the party of financial responsibility
has brought this country to the largest debt in histo
ry? Yes. that is the country we are currently living in.
Doh.
Now. we aren't saying that things are going to be
better if we hand things over to a different party (al
though we're kind of implying it). Well, at least it
would be different. In Iraq, we are now just falling
deeper and deeper in a hole that we. ourselves, arc
digging. Maybe the Democrats could at least choose
a different path — maybe not the right one, but a

different one. Even President Bush has finally ad
mitted that "staying the course" is not the best idea.
(Someone give a candy bar to the guy who finally
convinced Bush to stop saying it.)
We know that you have heard all of this before.
You don't need us to teH you why you should'be
angry at every new death in Iraq, every time the
president just happens to mention 9/11 and Iraq in
the same sentence as if they are somehow connect
ed and every time partisan politicians try and make
you feel dirty about thinking that it is a good idea to
let everyone have the rigWlo marry whomever he or
she chooses.
Many of you are anxiously watching your P.O.
boxes for your absentee ballots. Make your voice
heard, because remember, Betsy's vote doesn't even
matter because being that she is a resident of this na
tion's capital, she doesn't have a voting member of
Congress ("Shadow Representative" just doesn't
have the same ring to it). We all have to remember
that whatever happens this election day. someone
wanted it to be this way. In fact, the majority (or. uh,
plurality) did. Some of us might not have the privi
lege of being in the majority. However, that's the
way it goes — at least you can feel like your vote
went to something ... that's what democracy is all
about.
There is hope — from all places. New Jersey.
Legalizing gay marriage (or whatever it ends up
being called) in the state has opened new possibili
ties because there is no residency requirement
there. So it might become a rallying cry for partisan
turnout, but it is also progress. There's something to
be said for that.
