# Going under...the sea
## 
### SAM FRANCO INTERMISSION KISHHEAD 
So if you're writing about music "Under
the Sea." there's nowhere to start except with
that song. Yeah, the one from"The Little
Mermaid." Truth be told, the fact that that
song somehow became acceptable to sing in
public, or that televisions were not thrown
out of apartments, hud the pieces disintegrat
ed and their ears ripped off after hearing that
song boggles my mind. The song starts out
with a calypso beat. A calypso beat. Consid
ering that this movie was probably made by a
bunch of white people, they have no business
even touching a calypso beat. Heck, the only
exposure white people get to calypso music is
from lobby bands at expensive Caribbean ho
tels. Had this steel drum riff been put on any
other instrument, it may have become mar
ginally acceptable, but the song was doomed
before the vocals even came in. Oh. but that's
where the fun starts.
The first line begins, "The seaweed is al
ways greener/In somebody else's lake." Are
you kidding me? You take the worst possible
cliche, the moral of the "Three Billy Goats
Gruff for Christ's sake, and transpose it to
the ocean. Ah yes, but this isn't even a lake,
it's the ocean or sea. Whatever it is it is a salt
water body. Unless they're talking about the
Great Salt Lake, I don't know what lake thev

could have been in.
The song continues with its obnoxious,
Louie Armstrong meets Cab Calloway
singing crab. Why they decided a tiny crab
needed to sing like that, the world may never
know. Nevertheless, the lyrics only get more
bizarre. In the chorus, you can tell the crab has
really been around: "Darling it's belter, down
where it's wetter take it from me" (subtract
three points for the eighth grade humor). Ig
noring the innuendo. I'm pretty sure that the
sea remains at constant wetness. I don't think
any part of the sea is wetter than any other
part. Clearly this goddamn crab needs to take
a course on the principles of water. Or maybe
he knows the spot to pick up some of this
ultra-wet water goodness. If he docs, that
might not necessarily be a bad thing.
While continuing, our crab friend starts
ragging on us land folks, even insinuating that
what starts in our fish tanks ends up on our
dinner plates. This might seem like a below
the-belt shot at the human race from our crab
friend, but until you have tasted neon tetra, it
is not fair to judge. This actually makes me
curious which Disney writer suggested that it
was a perfectly natural thing to take fish from
the tank to the grill. I feel like this is a hobby
in some secret society of aquarium owners. 1
wonder how long those dolphins at Sea
World have until someone gets curious?
The redeeming factor about the crab is

that he starts making shoutouts to his funk
backing. The net playing the flute, the carp
playing the harp (while not that funky), the
bass on brass, and the fluke as the duke of
soul is pretty awesome. Despite the atrocities
of this song, anytime a Hat fish is turned into
the duke of soul, with the trout rocking out,
you've got a pretty tight group. The duke ol
soul might have been miscast though, as this
is a song of blind happiness. 1 feel like the
fluke could put Muddy Waters to shame be
fore all the money from the film inundated
his lifestyle. It's probably better, as blues are
more associated with the river crowd. I won
der what these guys sounded like before they
sold out to Disney. I feellike they could have
been like James Bro\Vn or Parliament with
out the misogyny or weird spacey stuff.
Oh yeah, and Ursula was sexy.
