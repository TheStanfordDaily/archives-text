## The

### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION WALK-AROUND 
Remakes almost invariably disappoint.
The reason for this, of course, is that the origi-

nal work is so incrcdibly good
that it is nearly impossible to live
up to the original. Witness, for
example, the weak remakes of
"Psycho" or "Planet of the
Apes." J
I've often wondered what
would happen if. instead of re
making the best classic movies.
Hollywood studio executive
chose to recreate bad movies
with good conccpts. Think of
how much better this would be.
since the director wouldn't have
to be worried about fans lament
ing changes from the first film,
but instead would have the
chance to adapt the source as he
saw fit.
The Walkmcn seem to trying
this approach with their latest
album. Pussy Cats. The Walk
men. whose past albums include
A Hundred Miles Off and Bows

112 I
& Arrows, seem to be trying this approach"
with their latest album, Pussy Cats. In Pussy
Cats. The Walkmen have covered, track-by
track. Harry Nicllson and John Lennon's lack
luster 1974 album.

So it's sad lhat despite the fact the they
don't have the pressure of covering an amazing
album. The Walkmen's most recent album is
often bland and disappointing. The album,
though it features a few pretty decent songs.

But Leithauser's sccond song, "Subter

lor the defects of the first. If you think you rec
ognize the song title, you do: Neillson covered
Boh Dylan from Dylan's album Bringing it All
Back.
The song sounds great, with incredible
playfulness and warmth. The artists are obvi
ously having fun. and The Walkmen do an ex
cellent job of adapting from the source mater
ial. Their version sounds very little like
Dylan's (are those kazoos I hear in the back
ground?), and creates an impressive reimagin
ingof Dylan's song.
Two songs later, "All My Life" is a charm
ing duet with Leithauser and Qucntin Stoltz
fus. It's entertaining, but a little shallow. De
spite this, it floats lightly and is a great song in
celebration of life.
The next three songs, "Old Forgotten Sol
dier," "Save the Last Dance" and "Mucho
Mongo" all suffer from their lengthiness. All
three linger for far too long, and, like The Re
turn of the King could have done with a swifter
ending.
"Loop De Loop" is a catchy song straight
