## The 						Walkmen: Aren't they supposed to be iPods by now? 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION WALK-AROUND 
Remakes almost invariably disappoint.
The reason for this, of course, is that the origi-

nal work is so incrcdibly good
that it is nearly impossible to live
up to the original. Witness, for
example, the weak remakes of
"Psycho" or "Planet of the
Apes." J
I've often wondered what
would happen if. instead of re
making the best classic movies.
Hollywood studio executive
chose to recreate bad movies
with good conccpts. Think of
how much better this would be.
since the director wouldn't have
to be worried about fans lament
ing changes from the first film,
but instead would have the
chance to adapt the source as he
saw fit.
The Walkmcn seem to trying
this approach with their latest
album. Pussy Cats. The Walk
men. whose past albums include
A Hundred Miles Off and Bows

112 I
& Arrows, seem to be trying this approach"
with their latest album, Pussy Cats. In Pussy
Cats. The Walkmen have covered, track-by
track. Harry Nicllson and John Lennon's lack
luster 1974 album.

So it's sad lhat despite the fact the they
don't have the pressure of covering an amazing
album. The Walkmen's most recent album is
often bland and disappointing. The album,
though it features a few pretty decent songs.
feels generic

and emo
tionless most
of the way
through.
Th c
album be
gins with
"Many

this flat feel
ing. While

Hamilton
Leithauser's
vocals leave
something to
be desired,
as if there
were no feel
ing behind

his words.
But Leithauser's sccond song, "Subter
ranean Homesick Blues," more than makes up
lor the defects of the first. If you think you rec
ognize the song title, you do: Neillson covered
Boh Dylan from Dylan's album Bringing it All
Back.
The song sounds great, with incredible
playfulness and warmth. The artists are obvi
ously having fun. and The Walkmen do an ex
cellent job of adapting from the source mater
ial. Their version sounds very little like
Dylan's (are those kazoos I hear in the back
ground?), and creates an impressive reimagin
ingof Dylan's song.
Two songs later, "All My Life" is a charm
ing duet with Leithauser and Qucntin Stoltz
fus. It's entertaining, but a little shallow. De
spite this, it floats lightly and is a great song in
celebration of life.
The next three songs, "Old Forgotten Sol
dier," "Save the Last Dance" and "Mucho
Mongo" all suffer from their lengthiness. All
three linger for far too long, and, like The Re
turn of the King could have done with a swifter
ending.
"Loop De Loop" is a catchy song straight

out of a sixties dance party. Despite its
generic qualities, "Loop De Loop" is
nonetheless satisfying. It certainly has more
emotion and energy than many of the other
songs on this album.

The album concludes with "Rock
Around the Clock." a cover of the song made famous by Bill Haley and His Comets.
It begins, in great contrast to the original, with the sounds of chainsaws revving up.
But the middle portion of the song sounds remarkably like an rock n roll band from
the fifties. If I had heard this song first. I would never have guessed that this was The
Walkmen covering this song, instead of an authentic fifties band.
Pussy Cats is a walk through the history of modern American music, and it's ob
vious how much The Walkmen care about their roots. Ultimately, though, this
album sounds more like a tribute than anything original. It has some good songs and
doesn't have any songs that could be labeled bad. but the lack of a spectacular song
dooms the album. Pussy Cats is worth a purchase if you're a die-hard Walkmen fan,
but everyone else might want to save their money for something more original.
