PAC-10 ROUNDUP
10/27 @ASU, 10/28 (©Arizona
The Cardinal ride a seven-match win
streak into this weekend, as they travel to
Arizona and Arizona State. Thanks to twin
upsets in Los Angeles two weeks ago,
Stanford jumped from No. 6 to No. 3 in
the AVCA coach's poll and the team re
mains in control of its own destiny in the
Pac-10. Head coach John Dunning cap
tured his 600 th career win in last Satur
day's sweep of Oregon. Stanford pum
meled Oregon State, 30-1 9, 30-1 7, 30-
20, one night earlier at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford's next big test may not come until
No. 4 UCLA looks for revenge at The
Farm on Nov. 10
10/26 @Washington St. W 3-0,
10/27 @Washington
The Bruins knocked off cross-town rival
Southern California in four games last
week. The Pac-1 0 named senior middle
blocker Nana Mariwether its Player of the
Week after she hit .486 with 1 9 kills
against the Trojans. UCLA visits Washing
ton and Washington State this week after
surviving a five-game nail-biter against
the Huskies on Sept. 28, winning game
five, 15-13. The Bruins' sole loss of the
season came at the hands of Stanford on
Oct. 12.

USC took the first game from the Bruins
before UCLA rallied for three straight
games to remain tied with Stanford for
the top spot in the Pac-10. This week, the
Women of Troy'venture to Washington
and Washington State — two teams USC
defeated by similar margins of 3-1 earlier
this season. Junior Asia Kaczor notched a
match-high 23 kills and eight digs against
the Bruins.
10/26 vs. USC W 3-1,10/27 vs. UCLA
The defending national champions have
their work cut out for them this season, as
the Huskies need to make up for their un
successful weekend in Los Angeles.
Washington took both matches from Ari
zona and Arizona State last weekend with
junior Christal Morrison recording 24 kills
against the Wildcats and 1 8 versus the
Sun Devils. The Huskies remain the only
Pac-10 team to have defeated Stanford
so far this season.
10/27 @oregon State
The Ducks have come seemingly out of nowhere to
claim fifth place in a tough Pac-10. Oregon picked
up a huge upset over California last week and looks
to ride that momentum into Corvallis this weekend for
their "Civil War" match with Oregon State. The Ducks
are hitting .207 while limiting opponents to just . 1 23.
Three Oregon hitters are averaging over three kills
per game.
10/27 (©Arizona, 10/28 @ASU
Cal was upset by Oregon, 3-1, last week at home.
The Bears responded the following night with a three
game victory over Oregon State. Junior Angie Pressey
leads Cal's attack with 4.36 kills per game and a
.301 hitting percentage. The Bears travel to Arizona
and Arizona State this week after defeating both
squads early in the season.
10/27 vs. Stanford, 10/28 vs. California
Stanford head coach John Dunning described Ari
zona State as the "most improved team in the confer
ence/' and with good reason. While their record may
seem humbling, the rebuilding Sun Devils have signif
icantly improved their hitting over last year. But even
that much team growth isn't enough to survive in this
conference. Arizona State hosts Stanford and Califor
nia this weekend.
10/26 vs. UCLA L 3-0,10/27 vs. USC
The Cougars defeated Arizona and fell to Arizona
State last weekend. The road doesn't get any easier
for Washington State, who will tackle two top-five
teams in UCLA and USC this weekend.
10/27 vs. California, 10/28 vs. Stanford
The Wildcats defeated the Cardinal twice last year
and made it to the NCAA Elite Eight, falling one hit
ting error shy of the Final Four. During the offseason
Arizona lost two Ail-Americans, an All-Pac-l 0 player
and two assistant coaches. Perhaps the national pre
season ranking of 1 8 may have been a bit too gener
ous. The Wildcats' sole conference win of the season
came against bottom-dwelling Oregon State. Arizona
welcomes Stanford and California this weekend.
10/27 vs. Oregon
It looks to be a long season for second-year head
coach Taras Liskevych, who has developed a reputa
tion for rebuilding programs. He may have met his
match in Corvallis. The Beavers will host rival Oregon
tonight.

Southern California in four games last
week. The Pac-1 0 named senior middle
blocker Nana Mariwether its Player of the
Week after she hit .486 with 1 9 kills
against the Trojans. UCLA visits Washing
ton and Washington State this week after
surviving a five-game nail-biter against
the Huskies on Sept. 28, winning game

season came at the hands of Stanford on
Oct. 12.

USC took the first game from the Bruins
before UCLA rallied for three straight
games to remain tied with Stanford for
the top spot in the Pac-10. This week, the
Women of Troy'venture to Washington
and Washington State — two teams USC
defeated by similar margins of 3-1 earlier
this season. Junior Asia Kaczor notched a
match-high 23 kills and eight digs against
the Bruins.
10/26 vs. USC W 3-1,10/27 vs. UCLA
The defending national champions have
their work cut out for them this season, as
the Huskies need to make up for their un
successful weekend in Los Angeles.
Washington took both matches from Ari
zona and Arizona State last weekend with
junior Christal Morrison recording 24 kills
against the Wildcats and 1 8 versus the
Sun Devils. The Huskies remain the only
Pac-10 team to have defeated Stanford
so far this season.
10/27 @oregon State
The Ducks have come seemingly out of nowhere to
claim fifth place in a tough Pac-10. Oregon picked
up a huge upset over California last week and looks
to ride that momentum into Corvallis this weekend for
their "Civil War" match with Oregon State. The Ducks
are hitting .207 while limiting opponents to just . 1 23.
Three Oregon hitters are averaging over three kills
per game.

Cal was upset by Oregon, 3-1, last week at home.
The Bears responded the following night with a three
game victory over Oregon State. Junior Angie Pressey
leads Cal's attack with 4.36 kills per game and a
.301 hitting percentage. The Bears travel to Arizona
and Arizona State this week after defeating both
squads early in the season.
10/27 vs. Stanford, 10/28 vs. California
Stanford head coach John Dunning described Ari
zona State as the "most improved team in the confer
ence/' and with good reason. While their record may
seem humbling, the rebuilding Sun Devils have signif
icantly improved their hitting over last year. But even
that much team growth isn't enough to survive in this
conference. Arizona State hosts Stanford and Califor
nia this weekend.
10/26 vs. UCLA L 3-0,10/27 vs. USC
The Cougars defeated Arizona and fell to Arizona
State last weekend. The road doesn't get any easier
for Washington State, who will tackle two top-five
teams in UCLA and USC this weekend.
10/27 vs. California, 10/28 vs. Stanford
The Wildcats defeated the Cardinal twice last year
and made it to the NCAA Elite Eight, falling one hit
ting error shy of the Final Four. During the offseason
Arizona lost two Ail-Americans, an All-Pac-l 0 player
and two assistant coaches. Perhaps the national pre
season ranking of 1 8 may have been a bit too gener
ous. The Wildcats' sole conference win of the season
came against bottom-dwelling Oregon State. Arizona
welcomes Stanford and California this weekend.
10/27 vs. Oregon
It looks to be a long season for second-year head
coach Taras Liskevych, who has developed a reputa
tion for rebuilding programs. He may have met his
match in Corvallis. The Beavers will host rival Oregon
tonight.
