# 'Crane Wife' doesn't fly to new heights
## 
### ROBERT CROOK INTERMISSION HIGH TIDE 
If you haven't picked up The Crane Wife
yet, you are really missing the boat. (Sorry for
the awful pun, but it is "Under the Sea"
week.) The Decemberists have never been
strangers to ambition. Alternately evoking
the eccentric folk styling of the mighty Neu
tral Milk Hotel and the ramblings of a crew of
curiously literate 17th century pirates, Colin
Mcloy & Co. have made a name for them
selves in both the indie realm and hip critic
circles for crafting richly detailed, idiosyn
cratic pop chanteys informed by history
books and folklore. With The Crane Wife,
the band's highly-anticipated fourth album
and major label debut, that distinctly dorky
brand of Decemberist ambition is as endear
ing as ever.
That does not necessarily mean this is the
band's best album, mind you. Indeed, The
Crane Wife is not without its weaknesses,
chief among them plodding stretches of time
and lyrics which are not always up to the high
standard Meloy (who boasts a degree in cre-

ative writing) set for himself on
the band's fantastic first two
_ A

albums. Castaways and
Cutouts and Her Majesty. A
prime example of the afore-

mentioned "dead time" is
the overly long (12:26)
"TUa Ir 1 n rl M c 1111 '.*)

"lhe island suite
which merges three
songs into one track.
It sounds exciting
when phrased this
way, but, in reality,
it's just three subpar
songs stuck together
to make one really
long subpar song.
Another example is
"Sons & Daugh-

ters," which has one
or two or three too
many verses of singing

in a round. And then
there are tracks six,
seven, and eight ("When
the War Came," "Shankill

Butchers" and "Summersong,"

respectively), a stretch I call the
Lazy Trinity for reasons you

can probably infer. Lyrical
ly, it sometimes feels like
Meloy is caricaturing

himself on this album,
saying certain things

for the purpose of
punctuating his
idiosyncrasies.
These grievances
aside, The Crane

Wife is a strong re
lease, besting its im
mediate predeces
sor — the critically
acclaimed Pi
caresque —in two
departments. First,

where Pi
caresque's mix
ing scheme
places Meloy's
voice low in the

mix, often forcing it

to battle for prominence with the frustrating
ly monolithic wall-of-sound instrumentation
as if everything were recorded through one
microphone, The Crane Wife gives Meloy's
voice and each of the instruments much more
room in the mix, ultimately offering a far
more nuanced sound. The consistently warm
tones don't hurt, either, and are certainly an
improvement on cold, sharp, reverb-coated
edges. Second, where Picaresque often
sounds written to meet quotas, as in "I'm
going to write a radio single because we need
one" ("16 Military Wives"), The Crane Wife
feels less insecure. Granted, the album has a
rather obvious single in "O Valencia!" Fortu
nately, however, this song is not as shallow as
"16 Military Wives." Certainly there are few,
if any, moments on this album that enter the
numbskullish territory of "'Cause America
can and America can't say no / And America
does if America says it's so."
The closest The Crane Wife comes to
walking that line is "The Perfect Crime,"

which
boasts the
chorus, "It
was ze per
fect, ze per-

fect,ze per
fect, ze perfect, ze perfect, ze perfect, ze perfect,
the perfect crime." Ridiculous, yes, but the sur
prisingly funky composition makes this one of
the album's most interesting tracks (kudos to
Nate Query for his bass work here). Another
standout number is "Yankee Bayonet," a breezy
duet between Meloy and guest musician Laura
Veirs that is concise and, thus, a welcome change
of pace from the meandering "The Island." It is
rather strange that "The Island" drags the way it

does considering how well the suite structure is
handled on the penultimate track, the excellent
"The Crane Wife 1 & 2." Here Mcloy draws in
spiration from an old Japanese folk tale in creat
ing one of the band's strongest emotional mo
ments on record. Interestingly, it's the album's
opener, "The Crane Wife 3," that provides reso
lution to the story, but the song works perfectly
fine as a standalone track. Finally,"The Crane
Wife 2" smoothly transitions to "Sons & Daugh
ters," which, despite the repetitive structure, is a
fine closer that ends things on an optimistic, an
themic note: "Hear all the bombs, they fade
away."
The bombs may be fading, but this band is
doing anything but following suit.
