### KELSEY MESHER INTERMISSION ORANGINA 
Southern California is notorious for its deli
cious surfer dudes, scantily clad, waify golden
girls, miles of scenic (and sometimes polluted)
beaches and of course: The OC.
I have to admit, it's hard to resist the drama,
the outrageousness and the awkward pleasure
that characterizes Orange County — which is
pioliably why I jumped at the chance to partic
ipate in a c(>nfercncc call with OC creator Josh
Schwartz.
As Schwartz Ls the youngest originator of a
network TV' show. I was itching to pick up
some how-to success tips—and of course, get
the inside scoop on season lour, which pre
mieres Nov. 2. While Josh did offer a bit of juicy
insight into his enchanting world of long
limbed. Chanel-donning, tragedy-prone beau
ties. I found that the real characters were my
inter-collegiate reporter colleagues:
lire Village Idiot:
Troy University News: What was the signifi
cance of the files Julie gave to Ryan?
Josh Schwartz: Have you seen the episode.'
Uh...Well I don't want to say anything 100 con
crete to give away the first episode 50...
TUN: Um...do get 1 get another questions or is
that it?
JS: 1 have no idea how this [conference call)
works.
TUN: 1 don't either. Uhh...Soare there going to
be any major character developments in the 112 u
ture episodes?
JS: Hopefullythere'll be lots of them. At the be
ginning of the season it will lie the Cohens bat
tling it out for Ryan's soul, and Seth and Sum
mer working out their long distance issues —
and Julie Cooper will be totally out of control
this year.
Tlr' Sentimentalist:
I Jniversity of San Francisco: What was your fa
vorite show growing up and can you find ele
ments of the show in the CXT?
JS: Well if you look at Alf...if you Ux>k at the
schematics of Alf — stranger coming into the
home, disrupts the fjimily.,.l think you could
see a lot of Ryan as a modern day Alf.
USF: Okav...?
JS: I'm just kidding. Sort of. Rut I did
enjoy that show as a kid. The Family
Ties? There's certainly a lot of the
Keatons in the Cohens when things
are going well. But I'm going to stick
with Alf. Ryan does not eatcats. how
ever. Just want to clarify.
IJSF: Do the characters represent any
people you knew in your high sch(x>l or
growing up?
JS: I went to USG and coming from Rhode
Island I'd never seen these OC kids before —
of which there were a lot in college — so I'd
never met the giant water polo player and I was
not familiar that being buoyant was a skill that

would help you with the ladies. So basically.
The OC was my attempt toavenge all the water
polo players.
The Realise
Columbia Daily Spectator: When I watch TV
shows where the kids go off to college I think,
wow this is unrealistic. They don't go to class,
they don't study. How will you make Summer's
experience at Brown more realistic?
JS: Weil, we certainly want to feel true to the
college experience — 1 don't think you'll see
every exam that she takes — but 1 definitely
think you'll see the idea that. college is a place
to reinvent yourself and that you go there and
nobody knows who you are and nobody knows
your past — that it's a real opportunity for
growth, and that's what we're exploring.
CDS: You were one < >112 the youngest creaU >rs of
a network TV show. Do you have any advice
for people in college and following thai path?
What did you do?
JS: 1 wrote a lot. 1 went to film school al USC
and tiK)k full advantage of all the opportunities
and I tried to write as much as possible. I think
you're always in the process of reinventing
yourself as a writer but the more you can do it,
especially when you're in college and you're
not being paid to do it, there's no outside influ
ences. it's just you figuring out your own way to
write. That and you'll probably end up having
to move out to California.

JS: Josh.
YPN: Oh Josh. Oh. my bad. Sorry. I was dry
cleaning and then I got to go next. So basically...
JS: You go to Yale?
YDN: Yeah. I go to Yale.
JS: I don't believe you.
YDN: You don't believe me? I'm sorry. Okay.
What are you most excited about for this sea
son? If I'm going up to a friend who hasn't
caught the first episode and wants to just get.
like, the gist of what's new. belter and different,
how would you describe it?
JS: I just think the heart and humor are back.
It's exciting—you've never seen this version
of the show before. I think the characters are oil
and in really different directions. The cast is just
giving it IK l percent. I think it's really fun again.
I think the people who watch it will really enjoy
it. If you've been a fan of the show at any point,
I think 'dial's who this season is really for.
The Narcissistic Asshole:
University of Southern California: Hey, "Fight
on!"
JS: "Fight on."
USC: Yeahhhhhh! USC Cinema School!

USC: I just have a quick question. I've been
working myself on a TV show and 1 was just
wondering what you think the best way U> pre
sent it is. Like how did you...what did you give
them? Like, what do you suggest 1 have, kind of
thing?
.IS: Well I think the best course of action is you
know, you have a script and then try to find an
appropriate agent...
USC: Well yeah. Did you have. like, multiple
scripts, like a...
JS:Well I had sort of an unusual situation. Isold
a couple pilots before 1 did The OC But I think
getting an agent and getting your script out
there. 1 mean, if you're at USC someone knows
somebody...
USC: (interrupting) Oh yeah. yeah. Do you
think that lhat made a difference?
Facilitator interrupts, tells USC his time is up,
USC: Iliis is a follow up to what he just said.
Can 1 keep going? 1 was just wondering how
much you thought already getting your stuff
bought made a difference.
JS: I mean it made a difference, but every
body's always looking for the next great script.
So it's totally possible.
The Inquisitive Intellectual:
The Stanford Daily: Is The OC meant to be a
social critique? What was your original mes
sage for your viewers?

JS: It was meant to be a lot of differ
ent things. It was certainly a social
critique and looking at the world of
OC hopefully...l meant there was a
reason all the characters on the show
were outsiders in their own way, I
thought that was probably the most
interesting prism with which to look
through in examining Orange Coun
ty. And I always wanted to be careful
that we weren't judging the place
that you know, that while we were
maybe tweaking it a little bit or hav
ing our fun with it.it was always very
inviting. It's also a show about family
and in the beginning and this year it's
a little bit a critique of the genre as
well.
TSD: How do you feel about shows
like Laguna Beach that clearly tie so
closely to your show?
JS: It's really flattering, to know
that the show has spawned its own
reality show component...But I think
they all kind of examine the world
from different places in dif
erent ways. I think it's inter
esting that narra
tively Laguna
Beach is like, how '• $'*%.. V
little story can we tell . y
in a given episode . i
while still being watch
able? Yeah absolutely it's ''
cool. I feel like we're all a part
of something. So I'm excited
bout that...
