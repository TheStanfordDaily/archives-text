\'es, it is the nipst basic attire
tor a day at the.beach. but swtrn
suit malfunctions are pretty cixn

large. You should be able to bend

but also when standing, not look
like you had an accident due to cx
<cess sagging.
Swimsuits
Ever since Micheline Bernar
dini modeled the first bikini in
J c )46, it has been a mainstay at the
beach and has gone through a se
ries of transformations (remem
ber the tankini?). So when pick

The Cover-up
Unless you feci corrtlortable
wearing a bathing suit all day long,
what is worn over the bathing suit;
is another important component*
