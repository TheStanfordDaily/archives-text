### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION AUSSIE 
It might be going a little too far to say that Intermission is themed "Under the Sea' this
week in honor of me studying abroad in Australia this quarter (specifically that I am missed).
I'm pretty sure it had more to do with "The Little Mermaid" being the Editor-in-Chjcf s favorite
vie. and he demanded Intermission put out a maritime-related issue. Since I have been
\ustralia for a month, and on the Great Barrier Reef now for a whole week. 1 am the
ideni expert on all things ocean-related. In my vast time here I have acquired
te a bit of knowledge that I will now impart upon you, dear reader. Without J
ther ado. I give you Caley's Australian Guide to the Sea: siY
)o not fear the sharks. There are many things in the ocean lhat will kill ' '\ V /

you. We had an entire lec- Jr w V
i h
jellyfish? Waaaay more likely to sting you. Wi
And none of that wimpy-slightyly-red-irritation
stinging. either. I'm talking, huge-welts-poison-you-could
die kind ot stinging. From something about l/2000th the size
jf a shark. toc». Let's be real: sharks don't really want to eat
ou. Humans are to sharks as btussel sprouts arc to five-year-

V olds: not tasty. They also don't like to eat things that tight back. Just
punch the shark in the nose and it will leave you alone, 1 promise. Punch
the jellyfish? You're waltzing into a world of pain. Think about it.

2. Underwater fashion is high fashion. I 'd say wetsuitsare the
new black except they are actually black. You can spruce
them up with colored stripes (mine is emerald green), and
they do come in a variety ol lengths (think about that rad

I lo hide in a wetsuit: little is left to the imagination. However, swimming out in
■ the open ocean can be a tad bit chilly, even here in Australia, and this may be
the only instance where function beats style every time. Its not just an aquatic
fashion statement, either, because anyone who said Australia was warm and that

It might be going a little too far to say that Intermission is themed "Under the Sea' this
week in honor of me studying abroad in Australia this quarter (specifically that I am missed).
I'm pretty sure it had more to do with "The Little Mermaid" being the Editor-in-Chjcf s favorite
vie. and he demanded Intermission put out a maritime-related issue. Since I have been
\ustralia for a month, and on the Great Barrier Reef now for a whole week. 1 am the
ideni expert on all things ocean-related. In my vast time here I have acquired
te a bit of knowledge that I will now impart upon you, dear reader. Without J
ther ado. I give you Caley's Australian Guide to the Sea: siY
)o not fear the sharks. There are many things in the ocean lhat will kill ' '\ V /

you. We had an entire lec- Jr w V

And none of that wimpy-slightyly-red-irritation
stinging. either. I'm talking, huge-welts-poison-you-could
die kind ot stinging. From something about l/2000th the size
jf a shark. toc». Let's be real: sharks don't really want to eat
ou. Humans are to sharks as btussel sprouts arc to five-year-

V olds: not tasty. They also don't like to eat things that tight back. Just
punch the shark in the nose and it will leave you alone, 1 promise. Punch
the jellyfish? You're waltzing into a world of pain. Think about it.

2. Underwater fashion is high fashion. I 'd say wetsuitsare the
new black except they are actually black. You can spruce
them up with colored stripes (mine is emerald green), and
they do come in a variety ol lengths (think about that rad

I lo hide in a wetsuit: little is left to the imagination. However, swimming out in
■ the open ocean can be a tad bit chilly, even here in Australia, and this may be
the only instance where function beats style every time. Its not just an aquatic
fashion statement, either, because anyone who said Australia was warm and that

5. Even coral wears sunscreen. No, seriously. And \\ hile it may be green and «

mucousy. it is still sunscreen. Coral produce a dark
green blobby mucous that protects it from UV
rays. We should all follow the coral's example and
wear sunscreen, too. Especially near water, be- 1
