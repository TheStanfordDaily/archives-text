### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Here at Stanford, we like to be on the cut
ting edge. Innovative technology, global
human rights movements, you name it, and
Stanford students are in on the ground floor.
So why are we sadly lacking when it comes to
new, exciting and different places to get a littie

Roxy sees no further encourage- X
meni necessary to spice it up a lit- J
tie. Or a lot! Read on for her exclu
sive tour of campus, the cream of the

crop of crazy places to get it on. Roxy
will lead off with a few of her wetter options, in
keeping with this week's Intermission theme of
"Under the Sea," or, as Roxy much prefers,

really, behind the screen of falling water in the
Hoop, you'll be enjoying something else en
tirely. The best part is that you'll already be
half-naked, so you really won't be breaking any
rules.
Lake I^ag
Roxy's personal favorite is pitching a tent
out there, during the dry season of course. You
will be harder to catch, however, if you choose
to venture out on some sort of floating object
when Lag is actually filled. The water once
again can provide a screen for the true nature
of your innocent-looking excursion. Bon

voyage.

Cantor Arts Center
if passing through the nude statues-gallery
puts you in the mood, Roxy assures you you'll
blend right in! Just be sure not to move around
or scream too much. Enjoy museum visitors
marveling at the lifelike quality of your quiver
ing skin.
Hoover Tower
You'll be riding high, Roxy promises, if you
choose to marvel at spectacular views a little
closer your person. Especially if it's raining,
you're likely to have the place to yourself Be
warned, the high elevation might just leave you
light-headed and short of breath.

In an elevator
This is a classic. Any elevator on campus
will do. Just pull the emergency stop, claim an
elevator malfunction, and get down to busi
ness. Watch out for cameras.

lii Vaden's SHPRC
They already know you plan on having sex
at some point, given that you just picked up
lree condoms, lube, and a dildo. Why not just
dash into a bathroom and stop pretending
you're as innocent as you were freshman year,
or, in Ro\7's case, in kindergarten. In a room
before your doctor's appointment works too.
At least you're being safe.

Take Roxy's words to heart, Stanford. It re
is icfuel to sexile your roommate during
midterms, meaning just about, every week of
our infamous quarter system. You can still
take your study break, but think outside the
box. It's a Stanford tradition.
