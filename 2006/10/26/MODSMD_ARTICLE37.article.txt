# Flagship Gordon Biersch still true to form
## 
### 
When you think of Gordon
Biersch, you think of the beer
— and for good reason. Gordon
Biersch features a wide range of
beers from light to dark, all fresh and locally
brewed. Each variety comes in a unique glass, a
distinctive addition to the already high-quality
product. Unlike most other microbreweries,
Gordon Biersch primarily brews lagers, not
ales, which are crisper, smoother beers.
Fortunately, if beer is not your style, Gordon
Biersch also has a full bar, stocked with all the
essentials. The high ceilings, views of the brew
ing tanks and plasma screens give the impres
sion of a very upscale bar, while the prices are
more than reasonable.
Gordon Biersch is a perfect venue for chilling
out and just enjoying a drink, but it is also a great
place for a delicious lunch or dinner. As could be
expected, the standard "brewery food" is fantas
tic (the rib-eye steak with gorgonzola butter is
especially delicious and the garlic fries are clas
sic), but so is the selection of healthier options,
lliey serve nearly a dozen different dinner salads
ranging from a standard Cobb to a goat cheese
and hummus salad. There are also a number of
pizzas available for both lunch and dinner. Of
course, the server is happy to recommend the
perfect beer to go with any dish.

You can enjoy a meal in the dining room or
at the bar — they offer the full menu throughout
the entire restaurant, including the bar area.
Gordon Biersch now has locations in 13
states, but it feels nothing like a chain. The Palo
Alto venue was the very first Gordon Bierch,
opened in 1988 by Dan Gordon and Dean
Biersch, and it retains that original local atmos
phere.
If you want to hang out with friends over a
beer or sit down for a full meal, Gordon
Biersch is your place. It is conveniently located
in downtown Palo Alto, right at the heart of
the social scene. ■
