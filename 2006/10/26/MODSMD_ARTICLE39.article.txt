# Stay classy, Vinyl Room
## 
### 
Though a bit of a trek, we
really couldn't justify
publishing a Nightlife
Guide without including
this classy lounge in Burlingame.
The reason: there is simply no place
like it anywhere in Palo Alto.
Whether it was the quality of the
music filling the air or the friendly
nature of the people on both sides
of the bar, I really had a hard time
pulling myself away from this place.
Of course, the stiff drinks definitely
contributed to that as well.
Upon entering The Vinyl Room,
you'll notice a startling lack of pre
tense that other bars of its quality
possess. The suede furniture is
classy, yet you're likely to find
someone lounging with their feet
up, enjoying the wireless Internet.
The sound system — from the
turntables at the door to the speak
ers all over the place — is expen

sive, but admiring it with a drink in
my hand didn't prompt yells from
the staff like I expected. Instead,
an interested "Do you spin?" was
the response I got. And though I
don't spin, on any given night there
is someone there who does.
Extremely well. Wednesdays and
Fridays are house music nights.
Thursdays are reserved for hip-hop
("True hip-hop," in the words of
the owner. "None of this top-40
sh**."), and Sunday's are for reg
gae. But Saturdays are the nights
when you definitely want to pack
your car for the 15 minute drive up
north. Not only will you find the
place packed, but before you even
walk in you'll understand why.
Because on Saturdays, such
notable Bay Area headliners as
Rick Preston, Julius Papp, Uneaq
and M 3 take the stage to mix up
some tracks. And with no cover

charge, not even Lime Wire can
give you that kind of a deal on
music.
So if you're trying to get away
from"The Bubble" without driving
all the way to SF or San Jo, 1 highly
recommend giving this place a try.
But only if you like really good
music. Otherwise, go ahead and
stay inside with your books and
your silence. I had a blast, though.
And so did the guy who bought me
a drink for being the only unfamil
iar face in the room. And for his
generosity, Carter will be immortal
ized in newsprint. "Everyone here
is really cool, without trying too
hard. It's welcoming, but still classy,
cool, fun. It's like Cheers meets
Sunset Blvd." And I couldn't agree
more, without the obvious addition
that the music in either of those
places can't hold a candle to The
Vinyl Room. ■
