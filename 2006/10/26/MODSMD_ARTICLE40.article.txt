# A 						dash of India at elegant Mantra
## 
### 
Step into Mantra and be transported to an
intimate world where class meets culture.
The restaurant and lounge on Ramona
Street bills itself as "elegant Californian
cuisine with a dash of India." The same could be
said of the ambiance. Elegance abounds among
amber-hued lighting and contemporary paint
ings. And the up-beat Hindi music adds exactly
that "dash of India."
An evening here might begin with a meal in
the dining room located to the side of the main
entrance. The dinner menu offers a wide range of
items that will satisfy almost any appetite —
whether it be for Indian food or not.
Don't skip the first course. The handmade
samonsas and paneer cuboid show the effort and
creativity put into even the appetizers. Each
samosa is served with a different sauce, or chut
ney, while the paneer cuboid is stuffed with gin
ger sauteed green peas.
Dinner entrees range from the standard tan
doori mixed grill to the more exotic peppermint
and mango dover sole. And for those with a pen
chant for the Californian, Mantra offers the roast
ed summer vegetable timbale — a variety of pre

pared vegetables served with a mild garlic sauce.
But the best part of Mantra comes after dinner.
Leave the dining area and enter the Daru Lounge,
one of Palo Altos finest after-dinner spots.
Either sit at the bar or, for the real Daru expe
rience, nestle into the intimate, cozy lounge seat
ing recessed into the wall. Just be sure to get
comfortable for the drinks to come.
The fully stocked bar — lit from behind to dra
matic effect — offers most anything for anyone.

But the specialty drinks are a must-try.
Each is uniquely designed to offer a
different taste, and all live up to their
name. Order the Indian Summer for a
fresh and fruity sensation or the
namesake Mantra for a stronger fla
vor.
And, for a moment, while sipping on
one of these unique concoctions, enjoy
the plush cushions, the Indian-influ
ence modern artwork, the plasma TV
screens above the bar, or the newest
Bollywood songs playing in the back
ground.
It is not a common experience. ■
