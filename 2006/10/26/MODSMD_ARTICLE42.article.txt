# Introducing The Stanford Daily's Nightlife Guide.

### 
A detailed look at all the local hot spots and what
they have to offer. You don't have to go to SF or
San Jose to have a good time. There are plenty of
great places to get tanked — right here in the
neighborhood. Whether you're looking for a rowdy
bar to watch the game or a quiet scene for a
romantic date, Palo Alto offers a wide variety of
clubs and bars, tailored to fit any occasion.
But hold onto this, because when you're sitting
around on a Friday night wondering what the hell
you're going to do with yourself, you'll be mighty
pleased that you didn't toss this in the trash.
So don't delay — the night is young
and last call isn't for another two
hours. It's time to burst this bubble.
