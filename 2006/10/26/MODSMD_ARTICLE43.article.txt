# Romance and relaxation

### 
Located just across the street from
Stanford with lots of free park
ing, Scott's Seafood Restaurant is
an easy and convenient place to
soothe your stress after endless hours of
responsibilities and studying at school.
Although this restaurant has a very classy
vibe with candles on each table, don't let
its upscale image scare you away. Come in
on Monday nights to fulfill your football crav
ings, and be sure to enjoy the complimentary
bar appetizers. If that still doesn't satisfy your
sports fix, you can come in anytime to watch a
sports game on one of their two TVs. You may
even be able to catch a Stanford game that you
you couldn't get tickets for.
If you're feeling a little more romantic,
Scott's is a great choice to take that special per
son you're trying to impress. Come in and jam
to the live, up-beat music playing every
Thursday and Friday nights from 6 to 9 p.m.
and get a taste of the dinner menu that's
always available.
If you are simply looking for a place to
chill out and relax, Scott's Seafood has you
covered there, too. Dinner runs from 5 to 9:30
p.m. and the waiters and waitresses are very
nice and friendly. Or you can enjoy some
drinks from the well-stocked bar at amazing
discount prices. Come in any day for Happy
Hour from 4 to 7 p.m., seven days a week.
