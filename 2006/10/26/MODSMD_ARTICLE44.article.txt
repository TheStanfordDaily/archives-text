The Seven Fifty Pub and Eatery
$-$$
750 Escondido Road, Stanford
Sun-Thurs until 12 a.m.
Fri-Sat until 2.am.

The Seven Fifty is more than just a campus bar - it's a chill
lounge and a cozy venue for comedians and bands alike.
More of a lounge than a bar, it offers students decent beer
and good entertainment in their backyard.
The Seven Fifty has an eclectic selection of beers and wines. Patrons
will find Guinness and Seven Fifty on tap, and a small selection of bot
tled beers. The pub also offers mixed drinks made with Korean shoju,
although the pub is not licensed to sell hard liquor. Wine connoisseurs
can bring their own bottle, but there is a $10 corkage fee.
The menu includes some interesting choices, including tasty mozzarel
la triangles, salads and chicken marsala. It's the first bar I have been to
where they pass out a beeper to alert you of the status of your order. The
pub also offers a catering service.
The best thing about the pub, however, is its location on campus.
Students can drink as much as they want and walk back to their resi
dence, without having to wait to sober up. Although the Graduate
Student ( enter is a bit sterile, the bathrooms are clean and the couches
are comfortable. Students will tind a pool table in the back and two plas
ma I Vs stationed around the small seating area. The relaxed atmos

phere makes the pub a nice place to hang out with friends on a Saturday
night and watch college football.
Every Tuesday night, the pub invites local comedians to take the stage.
On Thursdays, it showcases a local band. Last spring, the pub remained
open during finals week to show the World Cup, a decision applauded by
many students.
The pub opened on June 8 of last year. The Havana room, located next
to the pub, is frequently rented by students for events. ■
