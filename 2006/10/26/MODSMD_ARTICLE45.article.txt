# Hawaii at your doorstep
## 
### 
Stepping into Ramona Street's Hukilau, you cannot
help but feel like you're fresh off the plane in
Honolulu. Customers are greeted with an "Aloha"
at the door, just one of the many factors that lends
Hukilau a distinctly Hawaiian ambiance. Moving in from
the outdoor drinking and smoking lounge, the restaurant
is draped in bright colors, and provides great food and
huge portions for a low price.
Hukilau imports its food from Hawaii and remains
loyal to its theme. Starting out our evening with a few
drinks, we were pleased to find umbrellas gracing unusu
ally large servings — with a potent kick, to boot. We high
ly recommend you try the Mai Tais. They're a perfect way
to take the edge off a weekday evening or to kick off a
weekend of island relaxation. The restaurant features a
full bar, while also providing a private room if your party
wishes to relax in VIP status. Blended drinks and sake
bombs wrap up the bar's excellent repertoire.
Hungry for a bite to eat, we decided to keep the fare
traditionally Hawaiian. The food is served by an extreme

ly friendly staff, and comes in volcano-sized portions. We
highly suggest you try one of the Loco Mocos, essentially
a bed of rice with your choice of meat on top, covered
with gravy and sauce.
If you're coming for the entertainment rather than the
food, Hukilau provides everything but the luau.There are
TVs for the sports junkies to chill out at the bar and a
number of special events for the dining and lounging pub
lic. On Wednesdays, the restaurant hosts Hula dancers,
and Friday features live Hawaiian bands. On Nov. 4, the
club will feature the Mango Kings, a renowned Hawaiian
reggae band. We found the best bet to be Tiki Thursdays,
a special discount day that offers half-off house drinks,
select beers and appetizers — the perfect fit for a college
student looking for a quick, cheap fix.
It may not have sandy beaches, but Hukilau is as close
at it comes to having the true Hawaiian experience in
Palo Alto. For starving students dealing with the stresses
of midterms and extracurriculars, a jaunt to Hukilau may
be the perfect weekend vacation destination.
