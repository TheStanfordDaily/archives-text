are a great way for students to kick back and relax
with live music. Yearly events include their
"McFanny's" party on St. Patrick's Day and their
annual party on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.
Offering more than just upscale bar food, the
kitchen is known for a pleasing array of signature
entrees. Appetizers are served all the way until clos
ing time, and their dinner favorites — the Philly
cheese steak and Cajun chicken sandwiches — are
to die for. As the evening progresses, tables are
cleared away inside to make room for dancing with

DJs playing hip hop hits late into the night. While the
bar is supposed to elose at 1:30, it'll stay open later il
enough guests are still hanging out.
If you're not feeling the nightclub scene, just step
outside to one of the largest patios at any bar in the
area, with plenty of room to hang out. The outdoor bar
is a great place to grab a quick cocktail under the stars.
F&A's is often the host of official Senior Nights,
and, if you haven't noticed, "unofficial" bar nights
are at F&A's for a reason. Whether you're there for
dinner, happy hour or the nightclub, you'll be sure to
have a great time at F& A's. ■
