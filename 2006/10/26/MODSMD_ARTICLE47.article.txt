# Big club without the big trip
## 
### 
Blue Chalk Cafe provides a great
alternative for locals looking for
a big-club atmosphere minus the
30 minute trek to the City or San
Jose. On an average weekend, an estimated
S(X) people show up to this extremely popular
destination.
Catering to the 21 to 35 year-old crowd.
Blue Chalk attributes its success to its
friendly bartenders, two fully stocked bars,
pool tables, shuffleboards, great food and
PLENTY of dance space. Even the 150
patrons they expect on slow weeknights will
have no trouble finding room on the two
level dance floor. If the second floor bar is
too crowded, try making your way to the
first floor and its corncr bar, where you can
grab a cozy seat next to one of two fire
places. Too hot? Find a spot on the spacious
patio out front.
The weekend at Blue Chalk starts on
Thursday night with College Night and a live

DJ with '80s heats. As if Stanford students
weren't already regular goers, Blue Chalk
offers no cover with a college ID and has $3
wells and $2 Miller Draft.
For those who feel up to the feat, try Blue
Chalk's Absolut Mind Eraser Challenge.
Finish the 64 oz. concoction within 40 seconds
and you'll he immortalized on a hoard and get
the drink on the House. Cover is only $5 on
weekends and the DJ switches over to Hip-
Hop and R&B.
Blue Chalk stays open until 1:30 a.m. on
Sundays for Industry Night, though any small
or large group can reserve space any day of
the week. Parking is available across the
street under Palo Alto City Hall, providing
easy access — definitely a plus.
Blue Chalk's restaurant specializes in
Southern-inspired cuisine (Left at
Albuquerque menu) until 10 p.m.The main
attraction at Blue Chalk, however, is its
nightlife. ■
