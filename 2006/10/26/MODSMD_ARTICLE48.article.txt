# Coming Soon: Sehbali
## 
### 
This unique establishment is
located in the landmark
brick building constructed
in 1902, formerly filled by
Mill's the Florist. Mills remains in
the entranceway to the Cafe, and its
beautiful and fragrant florae create a
pleasant atmosphere. The Cafe con
tinues inward and leads to the
Hookah Shop in the rear. The
Hookah Shop is also accessible from
Ramona.
Opening in the next two or three
weeks, Sehbali will have an interna
tional flair, showcasing Indo-
Pakistani, Middle-Eastern and
Mediterranean drinks and cuisine.
With free high-speed wireless and
fast-ethernet wired connections, it
will be a great place to work while
enjoying some of their exotic and
unique coffees and teas, or even a
hookah.
The Cafe will feature coffees
imported from small roasters around
the world, with rare varietals that
change with the seasons. Some of
their flagship offerings include the

legendary "Monsoon" coffee of
India and a variety of genuine Indo-
Pakistani chais. Lassi and other spe
cialty drinks will offer interesting
new taste experiences.
Organic, shade-grown, and free
trade coffees can also be found here
â€” not your common espressos seen
around town.
Sumptuous specialty sandwiches
will be available with a wide variety
of paninis, in addition to daily spe
cials. If you don't find what you want
on the menu, you can even make
your own. The specials follow the
Cafe's Mediterranean/Indo-
Pakistani vibe, with Indian chaat
varieties. Their range of gourmet
desserts will make a mouth-watering
finale to any evening. Fortunately,
Sehbali Cafe also offers a wide vari
ety of sugar-free luxuries.
Weekend evenings will be "date
nights," featuring live music and a
special menu.
The hookah shop will sell
hookahs and supplies and will be a
great place to hang out, socialize

and study while enjoying the cultur
al experiences of a fine hookah
smoke. Hookahs (also called
"shishas") use hot coals to heat the
tobacco, and the light smoke is
drawn up through water into a hose.
It's all about socializing, and the
exotic, Arabian Nights atmosphere
