### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
Former war correspondent Chris Hedges and author
Anthony Swofford described the pornographic appeal of
war and the harrowing difficulties in readjusting to civilian
life in a well-attended talk at Kresge Auditorium yesterday.
rhe public discussion, part of the Aurora Forum program,
featured Hedges, a former New York Times reporter and au
thor of War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning, and Swofford,
author of the best-selling war memoir Jarhead. The dia
logue.entitled "TheTruth of War," was moderated by School
of Medicine Prof. David Spiegel. It touched mainly on the
horrors of war but also explored its "sexy" side.
"War is probably the most powerful narcotic created by
mankind." Hedges said. "It's so easy to hate war but still be
caught up and addicted to the experience, to the 'war high.'"
"It creates almost a temporary psychosis," Swofford
agreed. "It's sexy, this nearly sexual charge that comes
about in combat, the glory of dying for your country. Grow
ing up in the "80s, 1 used to get it from watching war films,
that there was something exciting, pornographic about
combat — a feeling which is obliterated about 30 seconds
into the first conflict."
Asked about how one dealt with feelings of helpless
ness during fighting. Hedges said that it was a combination
of sheer terror in the moment and an unbeatable high af
terwards.
"I remember lying in the dirt praying — and I never
pray — telling God that if he saved me 1 would never do it
again. And then a few hours later, I was sitting in a bar in
San Salvador, and its a big, cosmic joke."
Hedges and Swofford testified to the struggles of read
justing to society and engaging in normal relationships
after being in combat.
"1 remember seeing a buddy of mine a few years after
the Gulf War, and he was a psychological wreck," Swofford
recalled. "He was still wearing his fatigues, drinking a lot. I
was drinking a lot too — it dulled the pain, drinking, but
my friend was particularly unable to live or adjust."
