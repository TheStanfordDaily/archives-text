### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
Former war correspondent Chris Hedges and author
Anthony Swofford described the pornographic appeal of
war and the harrowing difficulties in readjusting to civilian
life in a well-attended talk at Kresge Auditorium yesterday.
rhe public discussion, part of the Aurora Forum program,
featured Hedges, a former New York Times reporter and au
thor of War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning, and Swofford,
author of the best-selling war memoir Jarhead. The dia
logue.entitled "TheTruth of War," was moderated by School
of Medicine Prof. David Spiegel. It touched mainly on the
horrors of war but also explored its "sexy" side.
"War is probably the most powerful narcotic created by
mankind." Hedges said. "It's so easy to hate war but still be
caught up and addicted to the experience, to the 'war high.'"
"It creates almost a temporary psychosis," Swofford
agreed. "It's sexy, this nearly sexual charge that comes
about in combat, the glory of dying for your country. Grow
ing up in the "80s, 1 used to get it from watching war films,
that there was something exciting, pornographic about
combat — a feeling which is obliterated about 30 seconds
into the first conflict."
Asked about how one dealt with feelings of helpless
ness during fighting. Hedges said that it was a combination
of sheer terror in the moment and an unbeatable high af
terwards.
"I remember lying in the dirt praying — and I never
pray — telling God that if he saved me 1 would never do it
again. And then a few hours later, I was sitting in a bar in
San Salvador, and its a big, cosmic joke."
Hedges and Swofford testified to the struggles of read
justing to society and engaging in normal relationships
after being in combat.
"1 remember seeing a buddy of mine a few years after
the Gulf War, and he was a psychological wreck," Swofford
recalled. "He was still wearing his fatigues, drinking a lot. I
was drinking a lot too — it dulled the pain, drinking, but
my friend was particularly unable to live or adjust."
"Upon my return. I was pretty much a
mess." Hedges agreed.
In response to a question about whether
there were any just wars. Hedges argued that
some wars were inevitable but none were just.
He alluded to the decision by families in Sara
jevo to take up arms in defense of their families
during the ethnic cleansing of the 19905.
"But that doesn't protect you from the poi
sonous effects of war. and once somebody em
ploys violence they become tainted, corrupted,
perverted by it,"he said.
Questioned about the possibility of war
with Iran, Hedges said,"l think the only option
left is. in Thoreau's words, individual revolt. So
if we go to war with Iran, I won't pay my taxes
anymore."
Hedges' comment was met with applause,
but afterwards, audience response to the forum
was mixed.
Josh Abend, a Stanford alum from the class
of 1950 and a World War II veteran, said that he
enjoyed how the conference brought everyone
together, but that it never came to a clear reso
lution.
"They were undertaking a tricky, deep sub
ject. and they just didn't have enough horse
power to do it."he said. "There was nothing de
finitive. They bit off a little bit. but what did
they ultimately teach our younger people, peo
ple of your generation? That war is bad?"
The best summary of the night's talk might
have come from Hedges, in response to a ques
tion about whether only people who have been
to war should be allowed to declare war. Swot
ford and Hedges agreed on the potential dan
gers of such a plan, including the long recovery
time that any engagement in combat requires.
"It's a long process in the recovery of your
own humanity," 1 ledges said.
