# IN FOCUS
## Series to feature faces on the Farm 
### 
How much do we miss as
we run to classes, activities,
the library or a party? Do
we spend enough time get
ting to know the person
next to us in a class, a pro- |
fessor whom we admire,
even our friends? Stanford
has an unbelievably varied
and rich collection of peo
ple and every person here
has had accomplishments <

thoughts that push boundaries
or levels. People here have

mixed academia with great creativity, won a varsity
sports game or match only hours after conducting re
search and made world-class scientific breakthroughs
before meeting an advisee for lunch.
These people are Stanford's real resources, its most
valuable wellsprings of learning and creativity. Yet no
move has been made to highlight their stories and share
them with the rest of the campus. Now, once a week, in
this space, a new feature will present the stories, as well as
the passion and innovation, of someone on this campus.
Each week the feature will focus on one member of
the Stanford faculty, staff or student body who has met
the world on his or her own terms and found success in
innovative ways. The people the feature will profile
have created their own path and, in doing so, gained ex
perience and/or expertise on real-world issues that af
fect both the global and personal spheres. I hope that
these stories not only inform the Stanford community,
but that they act as a creative stimulus and form of in
spiration.

If you know of anyone whose story you think should he
told in this feature, send an email to Vaughan Meyer at
vaughan.meyer@gniail.com.
