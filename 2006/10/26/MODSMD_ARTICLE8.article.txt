## Racy costumes to showcase Oct 31 spirit this weekend Police uniforms, angel, devil outfits to be seen at Mausoleum party tonight 
### ADAM SOWLATI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Stanford students, I lalloween can
provide an exotic outlet from the rigors
of academia — and clothing. For one day
out of the year (and one night at Exotic
Erotic), students can sport hardly any
thing without raising an eyebrow, and this

year promises to be no different.
Many Stanford girls are flocking to
websites like Trashy.com to buy racy out
fits. Popular costumes include police uni
forms, angel and devil outfits and lingerie,
all of which leave little to the imagina
tion.
Many view the scanty dress for girls on
1 lalloween as an escape.
"A costume allows you to be someone
else for the night," junior Blair Foley said.
Many noted the contrasts between
men and women's Halloween costumes.

men dress as battle-ready firefight
ers while women dress as naughty
firefighters with mini-skirts.
Some girls said that peer pressure
is an impetus to wear revealing
clothes on Halloween. Others worry
that these clothes leave women open
to unwanted advances from male
students.
"Dressing up for Halloween can
be an unhealthy outlet because too
many times men will try and take ad
vantage of girls," said freshman Juli
et ldiga."Yet it is the only time in the
year that someone can dress up like
a whore for a legit reason."
Some freshmen warned that men
might get a wrong impression when
they see women in revealing clothes.
"If you choose to wear something
slutty. it would be naive not expect
guys to not treat you differently,"
said freshman Emilv Dansereau.

What accounts for this differ
ence? In a recent New York Times
article, Adie Nelson, a sociology pro
fessor at the University of Waterloo,
stated that many girls get the idea to
wear sexual costumes at a young age.
She cited the various Disney hero
ines and femme fatale imagery pres
ent in popular culture.
Indeed, many girls acknowledge
that what is worn on Halloween is
only acceptable on Halloween.
if I were to wear these costumes
to class 1 would be uncomfortable,"
said freshman Ali Payne.
Ultimately, though, many consid
ered risque clothing as nothing more
than the spirit of the evening.
"I view it," said senior Milton
Solorzano, "as the uniform of Hal
loween."
