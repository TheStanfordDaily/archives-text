# War, the story OF A GENERATION
## Ex-Israeli soldiers say conflict dehumanizes Palestinians, occupiers 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE 
Former Israeli Commander Yehuda
Shaul emphasized the moral quandaries
faced by soldiers serving in the occupied
territories in a speech to students and
community members in Jordan 1 lall last
night.
"The national project in Israeli is to
remain silent," Shaul said during last
night's event. Breaking the Silence: An
Evening with Former Israeli Soldiers,
hosted by the Coalition for Justice in the
Middle East (CJMH).
Last night's event focused on the
role Israeli soldiers play in the occupa
tion of territories in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and the moral dilemmas they
face while serving.
"We know that war is an ugly thing,"
Prof. Hilton Obenzinger, moderator of
the discussion, said. "But we need to
take a look at the occupying power and
what the occupying power is supposed
to be doing."
"It is the story of my generation,"
Shaul began.
As a boy, Shaul said he felt it was his
duty to society to join the army. For him,
it was not a burden or an unwanted ob
ligation, but an honored responsibility.

armed forces in I lebron until 2(K)4.
"It comes time that your generation

has to stand up for your country," he
said. "My father did it. My younger
brother will do it."
But he said the feelings of honor and
pride faded away as he transitioned
from a commander to a civilian. Like
many soldiers, the moment of returning
home proved to be difficult for Shaul.
who called that moment "terrifying" but
also "enlightening."
"Suddenly, the reasons I gave to my
self for doing the things 1 did did not
apply anymore," he said. "It was like
waking up in the morning, standing in
front of the mirror and seeing horns on
your head."
The return to civilian life forced
Shaul to reevaluate his image of the
Palestinians he had encountered as a
soldier. In the army.Shaul explained.the
dehumanization of Palestinians was the
only viable way to continue fighting.
Soldiers divided residents of the occu
pied territories into two types: the
"wanted terrorists," who were taken for
interrogation, and the "detainees,"
those that committed small crimes like
leaving the house during curfew.
"He stops being a human, he is not
there, you cannot feel him." Shaul said
of his interactions with Palestinians in
the territories.
As a result, he said,"there was a need
to create between yourself and your sur
roundings a wall of silence."
In this moment of enlightenment,
Shaul said he and 64 others decided to
"break their silence" through testi
monies and exhibitions of photo al

Yehuda Shaul, a former commander in the Israeli Defense Force, warns
students and community members that the conflict between Israel and Palestine
is leading to the dehumanization of natives of the occupied territories.
bums.
"For me it is very simple," Shaul
said. "I see this as a way of taking re
sponsibility. I can't go back in time and
change the things 1 have done, but I
can stand up and break the silence."
He had always believed that as a
soldier, one should distinguish be
tween good and evil. But, he argued,
the conflict soon consumed simplistic
ideologies and beliefs.
"We are used to a life of black and
white,"Shaul said,"but the story in the
occupied territories is gray."
Obenzinger echoed the former Is
raeli soldier's sentiment.
"It's not as if the Israeli army is the
only one committing war crimes —
there's blood on everyone's hands."
he said. "But because Israel is the oc
cupying power, it has more force and
more ability to do harm and should
have more responsibility"
Shaul called Israeli the"the victim
of being a victimizer" and stressed the

importance of taking responsibility
for dehumanizing actions in the occu
pied territories.
"Responsibility in my eyes doesn't
end with occupiers: it is with every
human being around the world." he
said.
The talk was the latest in a series of
CJME-sponsored events aimed at
raising campus awareness of the situ
ation in Israel and Palestine.
Hie CJME is a student group com
mitted to promoting an understand
ing of current events and dedicated to
justice in the Middle East, said senior
Olivia Sohns, co-president of the or
ganization.
Shaul's decision to engage in an
open discussion of Israeli and Pales
tinian conduct during the conflict is
extremely important. Obenzinger
said.
"It's very hard for soldiers to speak
out — they don't want to betray their
country or the trust of their com
rades." he said. "So when they do, they
have something important to add to
the discussion of the Israeli-Palestin
ian conflict."
"When soldiers speak out." he
said,"change is possible."
