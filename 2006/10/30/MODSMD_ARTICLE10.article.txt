### Ms. Manners INTERMISSION ETIQUETTE CONSULTANT 
Dear Ms. Manners,
Last night, I finally decided to do laundry.
After a week of fishing through the dirty clothes
I had already thrown in the hamper and running
them through the smell test to see if they were
suitable to wear, I caved.
I sorted my whites from my colors, my colds
from my warms and then heaved my gigantic
pile down three flights of stairs. 1 opened up
the first machine that said "0 minutes" but
there were wet clothes inside. And then 1
opened the next one. Nope, clothes in there
too. Ms. Manners, there were WET CLOTHES
IN ALL OF THEM. 1 didn't know what to do
so I abandoned the laundry room and my laun
dry spirit. Now I'm here, writing to you in a
shirt I've already worn three times this week.
Help?
— Defeated and Dirty at Stanford

Dear Defeated,
This is a problem you will have to deal with
throughout the rest of your time at Stanford.
There are several different approaches to the
laundry dilemma. The first and most obvious
would be to simply remove wet pile from the ma
chine. Unfortunately, you must now struggle
through another conflict — where to put the
pile.
Here's an option to consider before you
make that decision. If you're feeling pretty
peeved or just want some new clothes, rifle
through the random wet piles and add some of
their clothes to your laundry. You can even put
some of those ugly socks your mom gave you
into their pile to compensate — it would be
like a good 'ol fashioned clothes swap. Sort of.
Unfortunately, the guy down the hall will prob
ably recognize his favorite boxers when you
parade down the hall in them, so you might not
be able to wear your new digs outside of your
room.
If stealing doesn't float your boat or you're
just lazy, there are three pile-placing options.
The first would be to find a surface that isn't
covered with either more wet laundry or nasty
Tide n' lint ick and then plop the wet clothes
there. The second would be to simply drop the
laundry on the ground. I'd highly advise you
against this one unless if you want people in
your residence to hate you or the future of your
own clothes to be endangered. (And who
wouldn't, really?)
The third and most complicated would be to
place the wet laundry into a drier. You will find
yourself more inclined to do this if you recog
nize that certain pieces belong to close friends
— they would not be pleased if their favorite t
shirt fraternized with the nasty surfaces of the
laundry room. While people will appreciate the
gesture, don't go so far as to actually turn on a
dryer setting. Nobody brought their dolls to col
lege so there is no need to create a wardrobe of
teeny-weeny clothing. And besides, Stanford
laundry machines already seem to have the un
canny knack of shrinking everything into Barbie
sizes.
Now. if you don't want to deal the ordeals of
moving (or swiping) the laundry, you're left with
a limited number of options. Either spam the
chat-list of your residence, asking the insensitive
brutes to remove their stuff. Or just hide out in
the laundry room in your soon-to-be-useless
Halloween costume, waiting for the people to
collect their wet laundry so that you can confront
them.That'd be fun. I'd advise bringing a book
and some snacks, though — you might be there
for awhile.
Then again, you could just give up and do
your laundry next Sunday. That shirt doesn't
smell that bad. Really.
(PS. For those of you on the other side of this
dilemma, check out www.laundryalert.com,

chines are free in your residence to letting you

a ridiculously nifty site like this, you have ab
solutely no excuse for leaving your laundry in
too long).
