# NEWS FLASH: Berkeley partners with Hanna-Barberea, gets mixed reviews
## 
### BRANDON SILBERSTEIN INTERMISSION BEAR EXPERT 
After a specially appointed review board deemed
University of California Berkeley's mascot to be "too
damned scary," the university decided it needed a new
image. After much deliberation which lasted for many
months, the university decided to partner with cartoon
giant Hanna-Barbera and adopt cartoon icon and
beloved children's star Yogi Bear as their new mascot for
the new academic year of 2(K)(->-2(K)7. ITiis will be the first
time a live bear has been the mascot since 1941.
As part of the deal. Yogi will indeed have to dawn a
( al Berkeley shirt, but the university says they will allow
him to keep his trademarked tie and green hat.
The old mascot, Oski the bear, has been universally
recogni/ed as perhaps the scariest bear in existence ever,
beating out the bear from the movie "The Edge," which
almost kills Anthony Hopkins (imagined survey). With a
stocky build, hunched shoulders, and completely dispro
portionately large head, Oski has been terrifying young
sters for a solid 65 years since his debut. The characteris
tic ear-to-ear smile and general pedophilic aura has
earned him a rather seedy reputation among other

schools. Worst of all is his "feeding tube" which inserts di
rectly into his eye, supplying vital alien nutrients to an ob
viously freakier than average bear. In a press release by
the university, the public relations head stated, "we want
to lose our shady image in place of something more re
spectable,cute, and friendly." University officials, howev
er. received shocking news that their plans to boost their
image had gone awry.
At first, the student body reacted very positively. In
coming Berkeley freshman Dylan Groves, from Los
Gatos, CA, said "At first I thought it was a great idea.
Yogi Bear was always my favorite cartoon growing up. I
used to wake up early Saturday mornings just to watch
him. But you know, after seeing his presentation at orien
tation week, I'm trying to remember why I was so capti
vated by him. They say they can really make some magic
on television, and now I'm starting to believe it."
Groves refers to an incident where Mr. Bear stumbled
into residential house Bowles Hall, an all male freshman
house, to purportedly make a speech to incoming fresh
man. but instead merely rambled off racial epithets. "I
was taken aback. You really don't expect this kind of be
havior from a celebrity, especially not a children's star
like him. He's supposed to be a role model," Groves

added.
Other reports have been filed against Mr. Bear by stu
dents recounting tales which put Mr. Bear in quite a dif
ferent light than his old television spot. One anonymous
report cited Mr. Bear for being drunk in public, indecent
exposure, making intimidating growls at passing stu
dents, and also, stealing picnic baskets.
One university official, who agreed to speak with us
on the condition of anonymity, expressed shock and dis
may over the charges, saying "We knew that the picnic
baskets could be a problem, and we warned Mr. Bear of
impending consequences should he break terms of his
contract, which included leaving alone all food items not
belonging to him. His behavior thus far has been ap
palling, and the university will take appropriate measures
to make amends."
A representative from Hanna-Barbera was not imme
diately available for comment.
However, not all students share the same opinions.
Senior Juniper Gin believes Yogi Bear brings new life to
the campus, which has been lacking school spirit recently.
"I'm glad they brought [Yogi] in. Quite frankly,our mas
cot was really damned scary. He looked like something
straight out of a nightmare, with that mannish body.

stooped shoulders, and that pudgy face reminiscent from
something out of a Stephen King novel. I've talked to
him, and yeah, he's not in his glory days anymore, but he's
still a good bear, and a hell of a lot better looking. The cap
and tie really add something. At least he tries." Many stu
dents have responded likewise, already signing Yogi up to
speak at other events. The football team has already in
vited him to participate in the halftime shows for their
games, which should be a crowd pleaser and added at
traction. "Everyone wants to see Yogi at least once," says
Gin.
Currently, the university has put Mr. Bear on proba
tion. The University's deal with Hanna-Barbera is a 'trial
run,' employing Yogi on a temporary basis for this year,
with the option to renew after the end of the academic
term. Yogi has issued an official statement of apology
saying "I'm very sorry. Normally I'm smarter than the av
erage bear, but this time, I wasn't. I didn't mean to turn
Gibson on you all." The future of Yogi Bear at Berkeley
remains very much unstable amid impending litigation,
but we can all hope for the best. "He's a good bear," says
Gin, "Sure he's done some questionable things, but
haven t we all? I mean, it is college." Whether the admin
istration will be as understanding, only time will tell.

him. But you know, after seeing his presentation at orien
tation week, I'm trying to remember why I was so capti
vated by him. They say they can really make some magic
on television, and now I'm starting to believe it."
Groves refers to an incident where Mr. Bear stumbled
into residential house Bowles Hall, an all male freshman
house, to purportedly make a speech to incoming fresh
man. but instead merely rambled off racial epithets. "I
was taken aback. You really don't expect this kind of be
havior from a celebrity, especially not a children's star
like him. He's supposed to be a role model," Groves

added.
Other reports have been filed against Mr. Bear by stu
dents recounting tales which put Mr. Bear in quite a dif
ferent light than his old television spot. One anonymous
report cited Mr. Bear for being drunk in public, indecent
exposure, making intimidating growls at passing stu
dents, and also, stealing picnic baskets.
One university official, who agreed to speak with us
on the condition of anonymity, expressed shock and dis
may over the charges, saying "We knew that the picnic
baskets could be a problem, and we warned Mr. Bear of
impending consequences should he break terms of his
contract, which included leaving alone all food items not
belonging to him. His behavior thus far has been ap
palling, and the university will take appropriate measures
to make amends."
A representative from Hanna-Barbera was not imme
diately available for comment.
However, not all students share the same opinions.
Senior Juniper Gin believes Yogi Bear brings new life to
the campus, which has been lacking school spirit recently.
"I'm glad they brought [Yogi] in. Quite frankly,our mas
cot was really damned scary. He looked like something
straight out of a nightmare, with that mannish body.

stooped shoulders, and that pudgy face reminiscent from
something out of a Stephen King novel. I've talked to
him, and yeah, he's not in his glory days anymore, but he's
still a good bear, and a hell of a lot better looking. The cap
and tie really add something. At least he tries." Many stu
dents have responded likewise, already signing Yogi up to
speak at other events. The football team has already in
vited him to participate in the halftime shows for their
games, which should be a crowd pleaser and added at
traction. "Everyone wants to see Yogi at least once," says
Gin.
Currently, the university has put Mr. Bear on proba
tion. The University's deal with Hanna-Barbera is a 'trial
run,' employing Yogi on a temporary basis for this year,
with the option to renew after the end of the academic
term. Yogi has issued an official statement of apology
saying "I'm very sorry. Normally I'm smarter than the av
erage bear, but this time, I wasn't. I didn't mean to turn
Gibson on you all." The future of Yogi Bear at Berkeley
remains very much unstable amid impending litigation,
but we can all hope for the best. "He's a good bear," says
Gin, "Sure he's done some questionable things, but
haven t we all? I mean, it is college." Whether the admin
istration will be as understanding, only time will tell.
