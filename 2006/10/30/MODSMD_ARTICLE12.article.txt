## Editorial Board No on Prop. 85 
### 
The Editorial Board urges readers to
vote No on Prop 85. If passed, the
proposition will require that a parent
or legal guardian be notified at least 48
hours before an abortion is performed on a
minor a change that will disproportion
ately hurt disadvantaged young women.
Pro-choice voters can be reasonably ex
pected to vote against this proposition,
which restricts a woman's reproductive
rights. An editorial arguing against the
proposition would be redundant for them
as we would be preaching to the choir. What
the Board would like to address seriously
and earnestly are the concerns of pro-life
voters and others who generally oppose
abortion.
The Board recognizes that pro-life vot
ers hold sincere and principled views
against abortion. The people who hold
these views represent a significant segment
of California's population, and it is neces
sary to engage respectfully with their be
liefs I or them, abortion represents nothing
short of the murder of an innocent life. The
Board recognizes the enormity of the deci
sions involved when a woman chooses to
have an abortion, and we hope that no one
makes these decisions flippantly.
It is not our intention to dismiss the
views of those who oppose abortion. Never
theless, your view of Prop 85 can be inde
pendent of your view on abortion. In fact,
the division between pro-life and pro
choice voters obscures the central issue of
Prop 85. Liven if you firmly oppose abortion
as a matter of principle, there are good rea
sons why you should vote against Prop 85.
Voting no for Prop 85 will not make
abortion illegal in the state of California.
But it will effectively eliminate the option
of an abortion for many who desperately
seek one. Instead of obtaining an abortion
performed by a medical professional, preg
nant teens may risk dangerous procedures
rather than risk notifying their parents.
If the intent of Prop 85 is to create a de
terrent for errant teenagers,be mindful that
many teenagers with unwanted pregnan
cies probably did not consider the conse
quences of their actions until it was too late.
It is unlikely that Prop 85 would seriously

impact the decision-making process of
teens. If it creates any dread or remorse, it
will only do so after

the fact, when the
damage has

already
been done.
If the in
tent of Prop
85 is to en
courage
family par
ticipation in
teen preg
nancies, con-

sider that many
pregnant teens

compelled to seek

out secret abortions are
unlikely to have supportive families. In
these scenarios, family "participation" could
entail domestic violence and abuse.
Some argue that Prop 85 would prevent
sexual predators from forcing pregnant
teens into having secret abortions. Howev
er, one needs to consider the stark asymme
try in the situation. There are multiple av
enues for concerned and loving parents to
find out if their daughter is having a secret
abortion. In contrast, a desperate pregnant
teenager from an unsupportive family
background faces a severe lack of options.
The reality is that Prop 85 will inordi
nately affect teenagers who are vulnerable
and disadvantaged. Some of us may be par
ticularly sympathetic to their plight, while
others may condemn their decision as irre
sponsible and chalk it up to weak moral
fiber or unfortunate social conditions.
Whatever the case, we cannot help but real
ize that the proposition will affect the indi
viduals who can least afford to bear its con
sequences.
These are the young women who have
the least recourse to alternatives. These are
the young women who are most likely to
seek unsafe abortions to circumvent
parental notification. It is precisely these se
verely disadvantaged young women whom
we need to protect. Regardless of your per
sonal objections to abortion, vote no on
Prop 85.
