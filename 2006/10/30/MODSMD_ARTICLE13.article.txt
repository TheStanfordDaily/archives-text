# A 						Weapon of Mass Distraction

What will Iran do with a nuclear
weapon? The many hypothetical
answers to this question are be
hind st) much of the urgency in the interna
tional situation today. Will so-called "apoc
alyptic Shi'ites" in the Islamic Republic
seize the initiative and destroy the state of
Israel? Will the Iranians take a lesson from
rogue nuclear scientist AO Khan and sell
their technology to the highest bidder or to
suicidal anti-Western proxies? Will they do
none of these things, but still unbalance the
fragile India-Pakistan detente enough to
bring South Asia into a nuclear war? Or
will the Iranian acquisition of a nuclear
bomb merely spark a regional arms race,
spurring undemocratic and less-than-sta
ble regimes like Saudi Arabia, Jordan or
Egypt to build nuclear warheads of their
own?
All of these options would lead to a dras
tically more dangerous world, and they are
all fairly plausible. But among the many
stabs that have been taken toward evaluat
ing Tehran's objectives and policy, few have
considered a motive that I believe to be at
least as likely as any other. Iran is not build
ing the bomb to use it TTiey are building it to
build it.
To explain what I mean by this, you have
to know something about Shi'ite Islam. In
the face of the Iraq war and the growing
Iranian nuclear program, Shi'ism has be
come an important social element of the in
ternational crisis that belongs to all of us
now. Iliis is certainly not to blame the
Shi'ite faith for recent developments, but if
we want to understand the impasse con
fronting the diplomatic community, it's
worth knowing the basics about the cultures
involved.
The origins of the Sunni-Shi'ite split lie
in a dispute over who should succeed
Muhammad as the leader of the Islamic
community. Shi'ites favored a blood relative
of Muhammad as their leader, while Sunnis
preferred to choose a ruler by election. In
the year b8() C.F., the conflict between
Shi'ite-supported Husayn and his rival
Yazid met a tragic end with the slaughter of
Husayn and his followers at Karbala.
Husayn became the central martyr of the
Shi'ite religion, and modern Shi'ites com
memorate his death yearly. Sympathy for
Husayn is a central feature of Shi'ism, and
bitterness against Yazid has reached such
extremes that, during the 1980s Iran-Iraq
war. the Iranian media ceased calling Sad

dam Husayn by his last name, preferring in
stead "Saddam Yazid."
Iraq is a historical center of Islamic tradi
tion, especially with respect to Shi'ism. but
also from the point of view of Islam in gen
eral. Not far from the original 1 lusayn's bur
ial shrine in Karbala is the city of Najaf,
where his father (Ali. a lawful successor of
Muhammad revered by both Sunnis and
Shi'ites) is enshrined. North of Baghdad,
meanwhile, is Samarra, which contains the
shrines of three of the 12 Imams, the historic
leaders of the Shi'ite community. While
these cities are unparalleled in their signifi
cance to the Shi'ite religion, the whole mass
of eastern Iraq is populated with cities that
have great significance for all Muslims, from
Basra to Kufa to Baghdad.
Not only does Iraq contain the heartland
of Shi'ite Islam, it also has ancient links with
pre-lslamic Iran. The Persian Sassanid Em
pire was centered at Ctesiphon, near the
eventual site of Baghdad. Not only does a
great part of the Iraqi state have immense
cultural links to the Islamic ideologues in
the Iranian government, it also has some
value to the considerable force of Persian
nationalism.
Given all the attractions for an expan
sionist, Persian.Shi'ite state like Iran,is it re
ally a far-fetched notion that the Ayatollahs
are interested in Iraqi territory? Not only is
there oil and manpower to be gained, but
also considerable religious and symbolic
capital. Are the Iranians holding out to pick
up the fragments of Iraq, in terms of oil, holy
sites and an enthusiastic mass of Iraqi
Shi'ites? Do the Ayatollahs believe that the
Shi'ite population of Iraq, persecuted and
brutalized by Saddam and terrorized by
Sunni militias, might be eager to align them
selves formally with the Islamic regime in
Tehran? Are they hoping that their fervor
might be the antidote to the lagging support
and religious apathy of Iran's secularist
middle class? Or are they merely hoping to

What will Iran do with a nuclear
weapon? The many hypothetical
answers to this question are be
hind st) much of the urgency in the interna
tional situation today. Will so-called "apoc
alyptic Shi'ites" in the Islamic Republic
seize the initiative and destroy the state of
Israel? Will the Iranians take a lesson from
rogue nuclear scientist AO Khan and sell
their technology to the highest bidder or to
suicidal anti-Western proxies? Will they do
none of these things, but still unbalance the
fragile India-Pakistan detente enough to
bring South Asia into a nuclear war? Or
will the Iranian acquisition of a nuclear
bomb merely spark a regional arms race,
spurring undemocratic and less-than-sta
ble regimes like Saudi Arabia, Jordan or
Egypt to build nuclear warheads of their
own?
All of these options would lead to a dras
tically more dangerous world, and they are
all fairly plausible. But among the many
stabs that have been taken toward evaluat
ing Tehran's objectives and policy, few have
considered a motive that I believe to be at
least as likely as any other. Iran is not build
ing the bomb to use it TTiey are building it to
build it.
To explain what I mean by this, you have
to know something about Shi'ite Islam. In
the face of the Iraq war and the growing
Iranian nuclear program, Shi'ism has be
come an important social element of the in
ternational crisis that belongs to all of us
now. Iliis is certainly not to blame the
Shi'ite faith for recent developments, but if
we want to understand the impasse con
fronting the diplomatic community, it's
worth knowing the basics about the cultures
involved.
The origins of the Sunni-Shi'ite split lie
in a dispute over who should succeed
Muhammad as the leader of the Islamic
community. Shi'ites favored a blood relative
of Muhammad as their leader, while Sunnis
preferred to choose a ruler by election. In
the year b8() C.F., the conflict between
Shi'ite-supported Husayn and his rival
Yazid met a tragic end with the slaughter of
Husayn and his followers at Karbala.
Husayn became the central martyr of the
Shi'ite religion, and modern Shi'ites com
memorate his death yearly. Sympathy for
Husayn is a central feature of Shi'ism, and
bitterness against Yazid has reached such
extremes that, during the 1980s Iran-Iraq
war. the Iranian media ceased calling Sad

dam Husayn by his last name, preferring in
stead "Saddam Yazid."
Iraq is a historical center of Islamic tradi
tion, especially with respect to Shi'ism. but
also from the point of view of Islam in gen
eral. Not far from the original 1 lusayn's bur
ial shrine in Karbala is the city of Najaf,
where his father (Ali. a lawful successor of
Muhammad revered by both Sunnis and
Shi'ites) is enshrined. North of Baghdad,
meanwhile, is Samarra, which contains the
shrines of three of the 12 Imams, the historic
leaders of the Shi'ite community. While
these cities are unparalleled in their signifi
cance to the Shi'ite religion, the whole mass
of eastern Iraq is populated with cities that
have great significance for all Muslims, from
Basra to Kufa to Baghdad.
Not only does Iraq contain the heartland
of Shi'ite Islam, it also has ancient links with
pre-lslamic Iran. The Persian Sassanid Em
pire was centered at Ctesiphon, near the
eventual site of Baghdad. Not only does a
great part of the Iraqi state have immense
cultural links to the Islamic ideologues in
the Iranian government, it also has some
value to the considerable force of Persian
nationalism.
Given all the attractions for an expan
sionist, Persian.Shi'ite state like Iran,is it re
ally a far-fetched notion that the Ayatollahs
are interested in Iraqi territory? Not only is
there oil and manpower to be gained, but
also considerable religious and symbolic
capital. Are the Iranians holding out to pick
up the fragments of Iraq, in terms of oil, holy
sites and an enthusiastic mass of Iraqi
Shi'ites? Do the Ayatollahs believe that the
Shi'ite population of Iraq, persecuted and
brutalized by Saddam and terrorized by
Sunni militias, might be eager to align them
selves formally with the Islamic regime in
Tehran? Are they hoping that their fervor
might be the antidote to the lagging support
and religious apathy of Iran's secularist
middle class? Or are they merely hoping to
