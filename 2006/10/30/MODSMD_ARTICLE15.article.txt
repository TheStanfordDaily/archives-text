# Fright Night

### 
I'm not normally the type of person who
writes topical columns, perhaps because
my topic of choice is generally myself, and
that, of course, is timeless. (Syllogism 1:
Thoreau said. "I should not talk so much
about myself if there were anybody else 1
knew as well." Syllogism 2. Thoreau's works
are classics. Conclusion: 1 am classy.)
But someone has to come out and say that
the Mausoleum party kind of sucked rocks.
For the sake of background, I should say
that I had a lot invested in the party, consid
ering the extensive preparations I had gone
through beforehand. 1 spent probably 45
minutes (including a trip to Target) working
on my costume, and in my mind, that de
serves something in return.
And Target, on the Friday before Hal
loween, is not for the faint of heart â€” espe
cially if it's a Target within easy reach of both
a large college campus and a local high
school. Beforehand 1 joked to my friend
Meghan, "You know that it's going to be
completely picked over, right? There's just
going to be, like, a stick. And you know what
else? We're going to buy that stick."
Actually, my prediction was completely

off. I would've been delighted to find a stick.
Instead, I eschewed Target's limited fares in
favor of my classic costume from the past few
years, which tends to be described as "what...
are you exactly?" It's a costume formed of
whatever object happens to be at hand,
which, in this case, was a Soviet military
medal (you know, like everybody has floating
around their junk drawers), a tank top, cargo
pants, and "combat smudges" under my eyes,
which makes for an instant communist revo
lutionary.
Right?
Well, whatever. The point was, I had put a
lot of thought into it, as had Meghan and her
visiting friend Clara, who had spent many
careful minutes putting cowboy hats on in

order to be Brokeback Mountain.
And then, after waiting for a few anxious,
confused minutes at the Tresidder bus stop,
the bus failed to appear. And then, after we
gave up and made the trek all the way to New
Mexico to get to the Mausoleum, we realized
that what we were wearing didn't even mat
ter.
Because you pretty much couldn't see any
hand in front of your face, much less identify
whether it was your own. Mood lighting is
nice, but having a small, poorly lit area
crammed full of unidentifiable people in cos
tumes takes Halloween from "fake scary" to
"in all honesty, no one would notice if you
disappeared into the whispering eucalyptus
trees and were never seen again."
"The horror, the horror!" 1 thought to my
self as 1 looked around at the half-lit, oddly
colored faces. A party that makes you think
ot "Heart ot Darkness" has gone awry some
where.
And then there was the music. Actually,
let's not even talk about the music, because,
hey! There wasn't any. Now, the word on the

it
street was that they ran out of gas,
which was supposed to power the
generator that created music. Or
something. And I guess when they
ran out. they had to go out and actu
ally build a new oil refinery in order
to produce the gasoline, and conse
quently it took a while for the music
to start.
Regardless of why it happened. I
felt had for Clara, who had never
been to Stanford before, and whose
first experience of a party here was
standing in the middle of a packed,
jostling crowd, in front of a crypt,
waiting for something to happen.
For while Messieurs Leland Sr. and
Leland Jr. may have been quite ex
citing in their time, after having been
dead for more than a century, their
skill at entertaining guests is not
what it used to be.
So, for future reference, party or
ganizers: Start drilling for oil a few
months in advance and try a lighting
scheme that doesn't look like the in
side of a closet.
Because if I'm at a party, and
there's not enough light for some
one to ask me what the hell I'm sup
posed to be. it's just not 1 ialloween.

Not that you could have seen her in
the murky darkness of the crypt, hut
Sini was the one carrying a two-head
ed battle ax, which happened to be at
hand and might have been a little
anachronistic. You can email her at
Sinim@stanford.edu.
