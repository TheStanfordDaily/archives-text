Branner RFs clear up misconception
The article about our decision not to allow
an impromptu gathering of seniors at Bran
ner ("For Resident Fellows, a constant bal
ancing act," Oct. 25) was mostly accurate, but
we'd like to correct one important misper
ception. Far from not welcoming Branner
alums to the hall, we hope alums will use
Branner for reunions and for networking
with current residents. Even as new resident
fellows, we already see that Branner must
hold good memories for Branner alums and
that they'd like the chance to gather there
and share old times. We want to help them do
just that.
What we objected to was the way these
specific seniors proposed doing it: unan
nounced and uninvited, without the permis
sion or even the knowledge of the current
residents or staff. Several seniors have
emailed me to express their concern over our
decision, and out of my replies to them (as
well as a follow-up meeting), we have

hatched a plan for a nice reunion, with re
freshments, publicity and the participation of
current residents and staff. A representative
of the seniors is in contact with one of our
RAs to find a date and make the arrange
ments. We think this is how it should have
been done in the first place, and we welcome
future proposals from Branner alums to
gather at the hall.

Reiterating the need for a
Stanford blog
I was quite flattered to see the new Face
book group I created, "Blog for Stanford,"
get a mention in The Daily ("Bloggers steer
clear of politics," Oct. 26), but was a little sad
that it was downplayed as having "only" 20
members. After all, the group was created
just four days ago, and as of Thursday night,
we were already at 26 members.

Also, the point of the group isn't neces
sarily just to unite people who are bloggers
â€” its actually to start a whole new student
venture. A Stanford Blog, if jou will, that
will be a forum for all kinds of student
media and commentary that would be inter
esting and entertaining for the Stanford
community, but which doesn't really have
much of an outlet among our current set of
student publications. My hope is that stu
dents will get to vote for posts they like, so
that the stories that rise to the top and are
featured are actually a reflection of what
students care about.
I am constantly reminded of the need
for such an outlet. Last night, I was watch
ing the Moonsplash video, thinking,
"Wouldn tit be cool to have somewhere
for students to post stuff like this for all to
see?" While the video has received wide e
mail circulation, there is so much cool stuff
that we aren't capturing in any of our other
student publications, because there
just isn't a forum for it. While we
may see a few Moonsplash or Mau
soleum or Synergy pictures in The
Daily and even get a somewhat
cantankerous report about how
they were all too crowded, or what
ever. would that really capture the
experience? And would we get to
hear from more than one perspec
tive?
Of course, talking about parties
wouldn't be the only thing a blog
for Stanford could accomplish. It
might also be a forum for students
to start expressing their thoughts
about tough issues, like torture, or
even just a place for students to try
out an idea and see how it catches
on. Either way. we're still in the
very early planning stages, and
would welcome the participation of
anyone who is excited by the con
cept.

Daily deserves applause for
coverage of Middle East
I have a small correction to Whit
ney Sado's article defending The
Daily's journalistic balance in re

porting campus events that deal with
important issues pertaining to the
Middle East ("Whitney Sado's Re
port," Oct. 27). Rami Khouri's talk
was attended by roughly 250-270
people, not the 80 people that were
mentioned in the article.
The Daily makes an admirable
effort to cover campus events that
have large audiences or are spon
sored by large student groups.
Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East (C'JME) has nearly 800 peo
ple on its announcement list, and
we work very hard to promote di
alogue and awareness by organiz
ing extensive speaking events with
authors, academics and journal
ists, among other types of pro
grams.
We are appreciative for Hie
Daily's articles covering our events,
not only because we work hard as a
student group to put them together,
but also because they further our
group's goal of promoting discus
sion on campus about topics per
taining to human rights and injus
tice in the Middle East and to West
ern involvement in the region. I am
encouraged that so many com
ments are generated on The Daily's
Web site about articles on CJME
events.
These are vital issues for people
to discuss at a time when the U.S. is
becoming further enmeshed in
conflict in the region.The Arab-Is
raeli conflict, though "controver
sial" and capable of evoking strong
emotional responses from people

of different political persuasions,
merits deep consideration because
of its importance to U.S. foreign
policy and the vital human rights
issues at stake. Thanks again to The
Daily for its diligence in reporting
events on the Middle East at this
critical time.

Response to Khoury letter
Daniel Jacobs' reference to The
Daily Star as the Lebanese "Pravda"
is just more proof of the unfortunate
ignorance that besets those whose
vision is instantaneously blurred
when criticism of Israel surfaces ("A
critical note on Khoury," Oct. 27).
The Daily Star (like other newspa
pers within Lebanon) has constantly
criticized various aspects of Hezbol
lah without facing the so called
"physical threats" that Jacobs
claims. It would indeed serve well if
individuals such as Jacobs did some
preliminary and constructive re
search (instead of just reading ideo
logically extreme blogs such as little
green footbiills.ct)m) concerning the
realities of the Middle East before
using ill-fitting analogies in their at
tempt to exonerate Israel of all ac
tions.
