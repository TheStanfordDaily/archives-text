Branner RFs clear up misconception
The article about our decision not to allow
an impromptu gathering of seniors at Bran
ner ("For Resident Fellows, a constant bal
ancing act," Oct. 25) was mostly accurate, but
we'd like to correct one important misper
ception. Far from not welcoming Branner
alums to the hall, we hope alums will use
Branner for reunions and for networking
with current residents. Even as new resident
fellows, we already see that Branner must
hold good memories for Branner alums and
that they'd like the chance to gather there
and share old times. We want to help them do
just that.
What we objected to was the way these
specific seniors proposed doing it: unan
nounced and uninvited, without the permis
sion or even the knowledge of the current
residents or staff. Several seniors have
emailed me to express their concern over our
decision, and out of my replies to them (as
well as a follow-up meeting), we have

hatched a plan for a nice reunion, with re
freshments, publicity and the participation of
current residents and staff. A representative
of the seniors is in contact with one of our
RAs to find a date and make the arrange
ments. We think this is how it should have
been done in the first place, and we welcome
future proposals from Branner alums to
gather at the hall.

Reiterating the need for a
Stanford blog
I was quite flattered to see the new Face
book group I created, "Blog for Stanford,"
get a mention in The Daily ("Bloggers steer
clear of politics," Oct. 26), but was a little sad
that it was downplayed as having "only" 20
members. After all, the group was created
just four days ago, and as of Thursday night,
we were already at 26 members.

Also, the point of the group isn't neces
sarily just to unite people who are bloggers
â€” its actually to start a whole new student
venture. A Stanford Blog, if jou will, that
will be a forum for all kinds of student
media and commentary that would be inter
esting and entertaining for the Stanford
community, but which doesn't really have
much of an outlet among our current set of
student publications. My hope is that stu
dents will get to vote for posts they like, so
that the stories that rise to the top and are
featured are actually a reflection of what
students care about.
I am constantly reminded of the need
for such an outlet. Last night, I was watch
ing the Moonsplash video, thinking,
"Wouldn tit be cool to have somewhere
for students to post stuff like this for all to
see?" While the video has received wide e
mail circulation, there is so much cool stuff
that we aren't capturing in any of our other
