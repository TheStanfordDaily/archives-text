## Living wage policy for all 
### ALEXANDRA GOLDMAN 
When President Hennessy an
nounced last May that he was raising
the "living wage" for subcontracted
workers by 10.9 percent, many on
lookers were led to believe that
Stanford's workers were finally gain
ing the recognition — and compen
sation — that they deserve for all the
work they do to maintain our cam
pus. However, what may appear to
be a treat is in fact no more than a
trick!
Hie principle behind the Living
Wage Policy is laudable and simple
enough:The University has an obli
gation to pay workers a wage that
will allow them to cover at least
minimal costs of living in this ex
pensive area. Hennessy has af
firmed this principle repeatedly, but
a glance at the fine print reveals
how little substance his policy actu
ally contains.
Hennessy's "living wage" policy
excludes workers in a union, work
ers at Stanford Hospital, workers
hired directly by Stanford Univer
sity, workers whose employers'
contracts are for less than a year,
workers whose employers' con
tracts are for less than $1 ()().()()() per
year and workers who work less
than 30 hours per week for six
months. We know of no worker

and despite all their research, the
Presidential Advisory Committee
on Workplace Policies(PAC) could
find no worker — who actually
qualified for a wage increase under
Hennessy's so-called living wage
policy.The PAC criticized the Uni
versity for its empty rhetoric, say
ing "We are unanimous in the be
lief that, if a living wage policy is
adopted by Stanford University, it
should be transparent and mean
ingful. That is, Stanford University
should not declare that it operates
a living wage policy, but then apply
conditions and qualifications that
have the effect of excusing many
Contracted workers from that pol
icy."
We agree wholeheartedly with
the PAC, and we believe that this
trick has gone on long enough. Stu
dents who agree may visit

telling President Hennessy to im
plement policies commensurate
with his rhetoric, with the founding
principles of the University, and
with the expectations of the Stan
ford Community.
