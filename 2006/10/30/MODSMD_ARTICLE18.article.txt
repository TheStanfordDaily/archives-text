## Prop. 85 would place vulnerable teens in danger 
### MISHAN ARAUJO 
For the second time in two years. 1 find myself
working to defeat an unnecessary, unrealistic and
unsafe proposition that would endanger Califor
nia's most vulnerable teens.
The proponents of Proposition 85 claim that by
requiring parental notification before a minor ob
tains an abortion there will be fewer teen pregnan
cies, increased family communication and better
reporting of abuse cases. The truth is that Califor
nia has reduced teen pregnancy rates by 46 per
cent in the last 10 years without laws like this.That
is something to be proud of — we've reduced teen
pregnancy by almost half without any intrusive
laws that put teens in danger.
We know that the real answer to reducing teen
pregnancy is strong caring families and compre
hensive sex education, including abstinence and
access to contraception. We all know that laws
can't mandate family communication. In reality,
the vast majority of teenagers involve their par
ents in abortion decisions already, but there is a
good reason that some do not: They are frightened
of being abused, scared of getting kicked out of the
house or worse. Finally, reproductive health clinics
do a fantastic job of reporting abuse cases, and as
a former employee of Planned Parenthood Los
Angeles, I take personal offense to any suggestion

otherwise.
What disgusts me most about this proposition
is its claim to promote teen safety. As many of us
know, not every teenager can talk to their parents
about sex. In the real world some teens live with vi
olent or sexually abusive parents. Rather than in
volving these abusive parents and risking the loss
of their family life, some teens will resort to dan
gerous self-induced or illegal back-alley abortions.
Some will go out of state, some will go across the
border,some will consider suicide, some will suffer
serious injuries and some may die.
Iliis is a reality that we must accept. These
young women need counseling and they need ac
cess to safe, confidential medical care. This propo
sition gives none of these things to California's
most vulnerable teens. Instead it presents waiting
periods, which delay access to care and increase
medical risks. If the proponents of Proposition 85
were genuinely concerned about teen safety they
would work to avoid teen pregnancy through
comprehensive sexual education, promote family
communication and fight against sexual and phys
ical abuse.This law is not about making teens safe;
it's about restricting their access to safe,confiden
tial, medical care.TTiat is why every major medical
organization in California, including the Califor
nia Medical Association, the California Academy
of Family Phvsicians and the American Acadenn

of Pediatrics, opposes this proposition.
Some proponents argue that for those teens
that do face abuse, there is a judicial bypass which
will allow them access to care.Take a moment and
think about this. You're scared, you're pregnant,
you come from an abusive home and now you
need to miss school, find your local juvenile court
house, find a clerk, file a claim and tell a judge
something you can't even tell your parents. How
many of you know where your local courthouse
is? How many of you know how to file a claim?
'lliis is unrealistic and unfair.
I know that many people, particularly people
our age, take for granted access to safe, legal abor
tions. Hut if we've learned anything in the last two
years, it's that our fundamental rights are being
challenged, lliis proposition is backed by Tradi
tional Values Coalition, Evangelicals for Social
Action and Right to Life of Central California.
These organizations are not quiet about the fact
that their main objective is to make abortion ille
gal. Now is the time to worry. Now is the time to
act. Vote No on 85. This is about the safety of
young women and the protection of Choice.
