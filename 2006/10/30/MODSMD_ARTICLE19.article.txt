## We could be legends 
### THE STANFORD TREE 
Stanford Football hasn't squeaked out a single
victory this season. Who's surprised? The squad
has been a fixture on ESPN's Bottom 10 list since
September. Not to mention that half the roster is
on the injury list. I'm drinking a bottle of absinthe
a week now (thanks, eßay).
Everyone's fingering her favorite culprit: the
Athletes, the Athletic Department or the Ad
ministration. Get those parties together and the
pooch gets screwed. Last time these three col
laborated, they gave us that part in the Band
Run where freshmen watched the LSJUMB
rock out on the field from confined perches in
the new stadium. I'm pretty sure they got that
idea from Saved by the Bell Season 3. Sticking
feathers up your butt does not make you a
chicken.
The team went to the Rose Bowl in 2000. It won
its seventh straight Big Game in 2001. It's been
five years since our fall from grace. Sack a few
coaches, tighten the alcohol policy, inflate student
ticket prices, abandon the Band and here we are.
Fireworks won't fill a stadium. They want you to
wave your credit cards in the air for the camera,
(lip the colored card when the PA tells you, stand
only one person to a plastic seat and pretend like

you're having fun when the camera pans your way.
Welcome to Stanford, and thanks for playing our
marketing game.The Farm Dog is just blended an
imal carcass. The New Stanford Stadium is just
concrete and plastic. You're not here to swallow
beast flesh or to be amazed at the versatility of
plastic polymers.
Over the last five years, Stanford has crushed the
student fan. But there's a way out of all this misery.
It's only after you've lost everything that you're free
to do anything. It's time for a comeback.
We're going 0-12 this season.This is our chance.
We could be legends. ITie guys on the football
team want badly to win a game. But more than
anything, they want students to be into the game.
They want support. We can do that. Supporting the
team is not about the Benjamins. It's about show
ing up. This is your college experience, and it's end
ing one minute at a time. Make it count. When you
take the dive, trust me, it's the best high in the
world.
Here's the 10-step plan:
1. Get tanked before every game and have your
roommate punch you in the face repeatedly.
2. Reject Stanford's propaganda.
3. Yell obscenities at opposing fans. You are supe
rior, so act like it.

3.50.The rawest dog? A dry, bare log.
4. Wear as much old school Stanford gear as possi
ble.
5. Watch Fight Club and listen to the soundtrack
on repeat.
(■>. Don't worship football players, but don't hate
them either. They're just like you, except their
necks are bigger.
7. Quiet down when we're on offense, and yell
your ovaries off when we're on the D.
8. Stay to the last whistle. Perv on the Dollies if
you're bored, like the alumni.
9. When you ride,come equipped with game.
10. When the Band plays All Right Now, jump the
f*** up.
The test comes this weekend: USC, fresh off a
loss. Hundreds of plastic faces are coming up in
buses with their Nick Lacheys in tow. Take the
pride of Stanford back into your own hands. Let's
make this one count. And one more heads up: Big
Game is at Cal this year. It's going to take more
than custom T-shirts, so start scheming. Damn
right, get your head right.
