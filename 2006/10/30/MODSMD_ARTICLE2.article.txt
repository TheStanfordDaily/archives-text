## MOSS captures cheaters Computer Science Dept. reports highest number of violations each year 
### EMMA TROTTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's not just the Honor Code that
prevents students in computer science
classes from cheating — the depart
ment employs the Measure of Software
Similarity Program (MOSS), written by
Prof. Alex Aiken, to systematically to
test student code against every section
of code ever run through the system.
Talk about pressure.
The Computer Science Department
annually reports the highest number of
Honor Code violations on campus, with
71 from the fall of 2003 to last spring, in
cluding 23 during the 2005-2006 aca
demic year. Aiken, however, said that
these figures may reflect the vigilance
of professors in his department, rather
than a higher incidence of cheating
among those students.
"A fair number of CS instructors use
tools like MOSS, while my impression is
that in most other departments system
atic checking for Honor Code viola
tions is less common." Aiken said.
Judicial Advisor Laurette Beeson ar
gued that unlike papers or problem sets,
programming presents a unique lure —
and opportunity — for cheaters.
"Students who are used to being
perfect spend 40 to 60 hours writing a
program, and they get frustrated when
one part doesn't work," she said. "It's
pretty tempting."
Nationwide, it is not unusual for
computer science departments to
record the highest number of cheating
incidences, Beeson added, arguing that
Stanford may even have fewer occur
rences than its peers.
"I think statistics have proven that
schools with honor codes have fewer vi
olations, and I think Stanford ranks
very well in that compared to other
schools," she said.
And while not all cases referred to
Judicial Affairs end with charges being
pressed against a student or students,
the numbers seem to reflect MOSS's
ability to root out cheats — of the 71 re
ports in the last three years, 52 resulted
in charges being brought.
An Honor Code violation in Com
puter Science usually falls into one of
two categories: the code in two current
students' programs may be identical or
nearly identical or the code in a cur-
