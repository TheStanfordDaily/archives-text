Swing dancing, running. Rice-
Krispy-egg-drop devices, camping,
Cheerios and jazz. As evidenced by
these varied interests and the words
of his family and friends, Guy Gra
zier G'Sell truly enjoyed every mo
ment of life and taught others to do
the same.
Grazier G'Sell, 22, of Saline,
Michigan died on July 13, 2006,
about one month after the physics
major walked at Commencement
20Oft. I le is survived hy his parents,
mother Kyle Grazier and father
William G'Sell. brothers, Max and

Gabe Grazier G'Sell, and his sister,
Alex Grazier G'Sell.
During summer 2001. G'Sell said
that his son was diagnosed with
brain cancer and deferred enroll
ment at Stanford for a year to un
dergo intense therapy and rehabili
tation. Additional cancer-related
surgeries and chemotherapy were
done in 2004 and 2005.
"After Guy was diagnosed with
brain cancer, his enthusiasm for life
only increased," G'Sell said.
"Throughout the five years of Guy's
disease, I never once heard him
complain of his predicament, ques
tion the unfairness of his situation,
or express self-pity. Instead, he was
open to new experiences and put re
newed emphasis on personal rela
tionships."
G'Sell described Grazier
G'Sell's ability to maintain a posi
tive outlook in the face of great
physical and mental challenges as
"remarkable."
"Guy did not focus on his disease
— he focused on his life," G'Sell
said. "Consequently, I've taken to
describing Guy as living with can
cer, rather than battling it."
For his family. Grazier G'Sell
was an "influential and loving men
tor and role model," according to
his father.
"Guy had an uncanny ability to
live in the moment and he endeav
ored to enjoy every moment of life,"
G'Sell said. "It is a lesson which is
not difficult to understand, but
which is very difficult to put into
practice as Guy did."
For his friends at Stanford, Gra
zier G'Sell served as an incredible
model of how to cope with illness.
"I will also never forget the re
markably upbeat attitude he had
when the tumor came back last
summer," said Stephanie Sud. who
graduated with her friend. "I spoke
to him the night before his surgery. I
think most people would be in a de
pressed or at least apprehensive
mood, but Guy was cheerful. He
showed me a strength and character
that few people can claim."
Grazier G'Sell's friend since
freshman orientation, graduated
senior Yoo-Yoo Yeh remembered
their entire sophomore-year dorm
"holdings its breath," when Grazier
G'Sell had a biopsy done on his
tumor.
"He shared of himself a lot," Yeh
said. "He was also really patient. His
smile was a full, big one. I will always
remember Guy smiling, happily."
Junior Tiffani Anderson, who at
tended a cancer support group with
Grazier G'Sell. admired him for his
commitment to supporting cancer
research via fundraising events.
"I will always remember walking
the laps with him at Stanford's
Relay for Life 2006," Anderson
said. "We signed a banner that was
later sent to the American Cancer
Society to thank them for all their
efforts in cancer research. That day
meant a lot to those of us who had
cancer, and I'm glad I could share it
with a good friend."
In spite of his failing health.
Stephanie Selover, '04, said Grazier
G'Sell was optimistic at commence
ment in June 2006.
"Guy has shown me how brave a
person can be," she said. "For the

last few months of his life, he
seemed to be feeling worse and
worse, but he was still the same
cheerful person. Even when he had
a hard time speaking, he was still
making jokes and was wonderful to
be around."
Many at Stanford will remember
Grazier G'Sell for how he made an
effort to befriend everyone.
"When 1 barely knew Guy, he
came by my room once and wanted
to know if I had any dinner plans,"
said Selover, '04. "When 1 said 'no,'
he insisted we go out and get dinner
together, so we walked down to
University Avenue and got Indian
food. 1 will always remember the
way that Guy just made himself a
part of my life, and how kind and
open he was."
Grazier G'Sell's former resident
advisor, Sud, noted that he brought
a "fun-loving spirit to the [Soto
dorm] community."
"I will always remember Guy
stopping by my room almost daily
to get a granola bar, ask about my
day and tell me about his," Sud said.
"I have great admiration for the
way Guy was so active in so many
realms of Stanford life — he partic
ipated in dorm events such as the
San Francisco scavenger hunt, went
on weekend camping trips and al
ways attended social dance events."
Catherine Chang, a coterminal
student in electrical engineering,
transferred to Stanford in fall 2003
and initially would often dine only
with her roommate, a fellow trans
fer student.
"One day, Guy, who must have
noticed we were never with other
people, just came over sponta
neously and introduced himself,"
Chang recalled. "He was incredibly,
genuinely friendly, so truly interest
ed in other people that you could
tell he only meant the best. I'm
never surprised when 1 hear from
others that Guy has done this many
times for other lonely, lost, new peo
ple on campus. He somehow could
tell when someone needed to chat,
and he'd make himself available, lis
ten patiently and add occasional
humor. Guy was a stunning example
of how to live with the right priori
ties — putting people and relation
ships with people before all else,
valuing life and every moment of it
and approaching everything with
cheerfulness, even if life itself was
uncertain."
During spring quarter 2005,
Jesus Javier "J.J." Tellez Loucel, '06,

met Grazier G'Sell when he attend
ed the Stanford@Sea program.
Tellez Loucel will remember Gra
zier G'Sell for his "cheerful person
ality" as well as his love for dancing
and jogging along the beach.
"Guy showed me that I need to
appreciate and be grateful every
day for the wonderful experiences
and opportunities 1 have enjoyed so
far," Tellez Loucel said. "Guy
showed me the courage to fight for
life and the strength to endure
through challenges and obstacles
with the intent to continue explor
ing, living, and enjoying the won
ders that lie ahead."
Tellez Loucel stated that several
of the nineteen members from Gra
zier G'Sell's Stanford@Sea voyage
are compiling their photographs
from Hopkins for his family.
"We all knew Guy's curiosity re
sulted in tons of thoughts and infor
mation flowing through because he
never ceased to amaze us with his
insight," Tellez Loucel said. "We
would like to let Guy's family know
that we deeply cherished and wor
ried about our late friend's wellbe
ing. We want to put something to
gether to show the unique life expe
rience and adventure in the South
Pacific that we shared with our
beloved shipmate."
Although saddened by Grazier
G'Sell's short life, his friends were
comforted by the fact that Grazier
G'Sell was able to spend his last few
years at Stanford.
"Guy always would say that he
would never have lived as long as he
did if not for Stanford," Selover
said. "Stanford gave him something
to live for — being around people
who loved him and keeping busy
with clubs,dancing, studying and so
cializing. Guy lived life as much as
he could."
G'Sell also noted that his son
loved his life at Stanford.
"Stanford provided the perfect
environment for Guy's life," G'Sell
said. "Social opportunities with
bright young people of similar in
terests encouraged Guy's personal
growth. A rich variety of education
al opportunities helped provide for
his intellectual growth. Hie many
other opportunities at Stanford al
lowed Guy constantly to explore
new pursuits, such as social dancing,
sprint triathlon and backpacking.
Many of these activities helped Guy
rehabilitate from his disease and
therapies, in addition to providing
exciting new experiences."

to know if I had any dinner plans,"
said Selover, '04. "When 1 said 'no,'
he insisted we go out and get dinner
together, so we walked down to
University Avenue and got Indian
food. 1 will always remember the
way that Guy just made himself a
part of my life, and how kind and
open he was."
Grazier G'Sell's former resident
advisor, Sud, noted that he brought
a "fun-loving spirit to the [Soto
dorm] community."
"I will always remember Guy
stopping by my room almost daily
to get a granola bar, ask about my
day and tell me about his," Sud said.
"I have great admiration for the
way Guy was so active in so many
realms of Stanford life — he partic
ipated in dorm events such as the
San Francisco scavenger hunt, went
on weekend camping trips and al
ways attended social dance events."
Catherine Chang, a coterminal
student in electrical engineering,
transferred to Stanford in fall 2003
and initially would often dine only
with her roommate, a fellow trans
fer student.
"One day, Guy, who must have
noticed we were never with other
people, just came over sponta
neously and introduced himself,"
Chang recalled. "He was incredibly,
genuinely friendly, so truly interest
ed in other people that you could
tell he only meant the best. I'm
never surprised when 1 hear from
others that Guy has done this many
times for other lonely, lost, new peo
ple on campus. He somehow could
tell when someone needed to chat,
and he'd make himself available, lis
ten patiently and add occasional
humor. Guy was a stunning example
of how to live with the right priori
ties — putting people and relation
ships with people before all else,
valuing life and every moment of it
and approaching everything with
cheerfulness, even if life itself was
uncertain."
During spring quarter 2005,
Jesus Javier "J.J." Tellez Loucel, '06,

met Grazier G'Sell when he attend
ed the Stanford@Sea program.
Tellez Loucel will remember Gra
zier G'Sell for his "cheerful person
ality" as well as his love for dancing
and jogging along the beach.
"Guy showed me that I need to
appreciate and be grateful every
day for the wonderful experiences
and opportunities 1 have enjoyed so
far," Tellez Loucel said. "Guy
showed me the courage to fight for
life and the strength to endure
through challenges and obstacles
with the intent to continue explor
ing, living, and enjoying the won
ders that lie ahead."
Tellez Loucel stated that several
of the nineteen members from Gra
zier G'Sell's Stanford@Sea voyage
are compiling their photographs
from Hopkins for his family.
"We all knew Guy's curiosity re
sulted in tons of thoughts and infor
mation flowing through because he
never ceased to amaze us with his
insight," Tellez Loucel said. "We
would like to let Guy's family know
that we deeply cherished and wor
ried about our late friend's wellbe

gether to show the unique life expe
rience and adventure in the South
Pacific that we shared with our
beloved shipmate."
Although saddened by Grazier
G'Sell's short life, his friends were
comforted by the fact that Grazier
G'Sell was able to spend his last few
years at Stanford.
"Guy always would say that he
would never have lived as long as he
did if not for Stanford," Selover
said. "Stanford gave him something
to live for — being around people

G'Sell also noted that his son

Swing dancing, running. Rice-
Krispy-egg-drop devices, camping,
Cheerios and jazz. As evidenced by
these varied interests and the words
of his family and friends, Guy Gra
zier G'Sell truly enjoyed every mo
ment of life and taught others to do
the same.
Grazier G'Sell, 22, of Saline,
Michigan died on July 13, 2006,
about one month after the physics
major walked at Commencement
20Oft. I le is survived hy his parents,
mother Kyle Grazier and father
William G'Sell. brothers, Max and

Gabe Grazier G'Sell, and his sister,
Alex Grazier G'Sell.
During summer 2001. G'Sell said
that his son was diagnosed with
brain cancer and deferred enroll
ment at Stanford for a year to un
dergo intense therapy and rehabili
tation. Additional cancer-related
surgeries and chemotherapy were
done in 2004 and 2005.
"After Guy was diagnosed with
brain cancer, his enthusiasm for life
only increased," G'Sell said.
"Throughout the five years of Guy's
disease, I never once heard him
complain of his predicament, ques
tion the unfairness of his situation,
or express self-pity. Instead, he was
open to new experiences and put re
newed emphasis on personal rela
tionships."
G'Sell described Grazier
G'Sell's ability to maintain a posi
tive outlook in the face of great
physical and mental challenges as
"remarkable."
"Guy did not focus on his disease
— he focused on his life," G'Sell
said. "Consequently, I've taken to
describing Guy as living with can
cer, rather than battling it."
For his family. Grazier G'Sell
was an "influential and loving men
tor and role model," according to
his father.
"Guy had an uncanny ability to
live in the moment and he endeav
ored to enjoy every moment of life,"
G'Sell said. "It is a lesson which is
not difficult to understand, but
which is very difficult to put into
practice as Guy did."
For his friends at Stanford, Gra
zier G'Sell served as an incredible
model of how to cope with illness.
"I will also never forget the re
markably upbeat attitude he had
when the tumor came back last
summer," said Stephanie Sud. who
graduated with her friend. "I spoke
to him the night before his surgery. I
think most people would be in a de
pressed or at least apprehensive
mood, but Guy was cheerful. He
showed me a strength and character
that few people can claim."
Grazier G'Sell's friend since
freshman orientation, graduated
senior Yoo-Yoo Yeh remembered
their entire sophomore-year dorm
"holdings its breath," when Grazier
G'Sell had a biopsy done on his
tumor.
"He shared of himself a lot," Yeh
said. "He was also really patient. His
smile was a full, big one. I will always
remember Guy smiling, happily."
Junior Tiffani Anderson, who at
tended a cancer support group with
Grazier G'Sell. admired him for his
commitment to supporting cancer
research via fundraising events.
"I will always remember walking
the laps with him at Stanford's
Relay for Life 2006," Anderson
said. "We signed a banner that was
later sent to the American Cancer
Society to thank them for all their
efforts in cancer research. That day
meant a lot to those of us who had
cancer, and I'm glad I could share it
with a good friend."
In spite of his failing health.
Stephanie Selover, '04, said Grazier
G'Sell was optimistic at commence
ment in June 2006.
"Guy has shown me how brave a
person can be," she said. "For the

last few months of his life, he
seemed to be feeling worse and
worse, but he was still the same
cheerful person. Even when he had
a hard time speaking, he was still
making jokes and was wonderful to
be around."
Many at Stanford will remember
Grazier G'Sell for how he made an
effort to befriend everyone.
"When 1 barely knew Guy, he
