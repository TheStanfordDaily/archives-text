# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Card sneak past Long Beach State Freshman Drac Wigo scores gamewinner as No. 4 Stanford hangs on 
### ANDREW SHEN CONTRIBUTING EDITOR 
Playing in its first home game since the start of the
academic year, the No. 4 Stanford men's water polo
team narrowly defeated No. 11 Long Beach State on
Saturday, 6-5.
In a game-long defensive struggle, the difference
proved to be freshman utility Drac Wigo'sgoal with
just over seven minutes left. Junior goalkeeper
Sandy Hohener, iced the match with a save as time
expired, preventing any overtime prospects.
Wigo led the team with two goals, while senior
captains Tyler Drake and JJ Garton. redshirt fresh
man two-meter Ryan McCarthy and freshman utili
ty Janson Wigo all chipped in with a goal each.
The win extended the Cardinal's win-streak to
five games, but the team was not necessarily satisfied
with its effort.
"We didn't play our best water polo," said junior
two-meter defender Peter Finlayson. "We feel that
we should have beaten these guys
by more than we did, especially
since we were playing at home.
Long Beach came out pretty fired
up and it seemed like we never
quite got going. We expect more of
ourselves than we showed."
Stanford had a 5-2 lead at half
time. but the Cardinal let the
creep hack into the contest. Long
Beach State scored two unan
swered goals in the third period to
cut the lead to one. Stanford's of
fense was struggling, but the de
fense and goalkeeping by Hohener
and sophomore Jimmie Sandman
kept the 4 l )ers at bay. Each team
scored only once in the fourth peri
od.
The pace of the game was unlike
any other Stanford has experienced
so far this season. An average match
for the Cardinal this season has usu
ally ended up with 17-20 combined
goals. ITie style of Saturday's game
harkens back to last year's champi
onship game, when Stanford lost to
Southern California 3-2.
Despite Stanford's offensive
struggles, holding any team — let
alone a top 15 team — to just five
goals is a defensive achievement.
"Defensively we did pretty well,
but we still need to tighten up a few
areas," Finlayson said.
While six goals is certainly not
much to show for offensively. Stan
ford was getting its fair share of
shots. But Long Beach State goalie
Steve Mackenzie kept his team in
the game as he recorded 14 saves.
The Cardinal followed up .Satur
day's narrow victory with a 13-5
blowout win against UC-Santa
Cruz in Santa Cruz. Limited infor

mation was available at press time.
Now sporting a record of 12-5
with a MPSF record of 3-1.
prospects for restoring last year's
success seem brighter.
"The important thing is that we
learn from this game and come out

fired up against USC next Satur
day." Finlayson said. "We expect
more of ourselves than we showed
today We need to move forward
with intensity and selfless play —
that's what will make us the great
team we feel we are and can be."
