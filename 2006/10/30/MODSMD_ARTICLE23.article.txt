# ROAD SWEET ROAD
## No. 3 volleyball gains in the win column but takes a hit in the wallet 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team came back from
Arizona this weekend with a pair of wins, though thev lost about
$1,200.
At a Safeway en route to Tucson and after a sweep of Arizona
State on Friday night, several of the Cardinal players and coaches
discovered that all of the large bills had been removed from their
wallets in the ASU locker room.
"Sounds lucrative" senior Nji Nnamani said. "From now on. 1
might play with my twenties in my spandex and my iPod in my sock."
Sophomore Foluke Akinradewo and the Cardinal (18-2,0-1 Pac
-10) took out their frustration the next night on the hapless Wildcats
(10-13,1-10). Akinradewo led her team to the sweep with 17 kills on
career-high .850 hitting and three aces.
"The key thing is that it is always hard to win on the road." head
coach John Dunning said. "Whenever you travel, if you let down you
are going to lose. So our goal has just been to play consistent and we
have done that."

tough [this weekend]," Dunning
said. "Lots of people got to play and
we still played nicely together."
While the Cardinal roster played
well top to bottom, Arizona man
aged only 34 kills in the match and
had no hitters in double digits. Mid
dle blocker Dominique Lamb had a
team-high nine kills and led the
Wildcats in aces (two) and blocks
(four).
The Cardinal will have a light
week of practice and then play just
once this coming week, a Friday
night battle with cross-Bay rival
California. The No. 11 Golden
Bears also won both matches in Ari
zona this weekend, each in four
games.
"In the last few weeks, the play
ers have had a lot of papers and a lot
of midterms and we know that they
have some aches and pains," Dun
ning said. "So we want to make sure
that, since we only have one match
this week, they get some time to
rest."
The No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team came back from
Arizona this weekend with a pair of wins, though thev lost about
$1,200.
At a Safeway en route to Tucson and after a sweep of Arizona
State on Friday night, several of the Cardinal players and coaches
discovered that all of the large bills had been removed from their
wallets in the ASU locker room.
"Sounds lucrative" senior Nji Nnamani said. "From now on. 1
might play with my twenties in my spandex and my iPod in my sock."
Sophomore Foluke Akinradewo and the Cardinal (18-2,0-1 Pac
-10) took out their frustration the next night on the hapless Wildcats
(10-13,1-10). Akinradewo led her team to the sweep with 17 kills on
career-high .850 hitting and three aces.
"The key thing is that it is always hard to win on the road." head
coach John Dunning said. "Whenever you travel, if you let down you
are going to lose. So our goal has just been to play consistent and we
have done that."
