## No. 3 volleyball gains in the win column but takes a hit in the wallet 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team came back from
Arizona this weekend with a pair of wins, though thev lost about
$1,200.
At a Safeway en route to Tucson and after a sweep of Arizona
State on Friday night, several of the Cardinal players and coaches
discovered that all of the large bills had been removed from their
wallets in the ASU locker room.
"Sounds lucrative" senior Nji Nnamani said. "From now on. 1
might play with my twenties in my spandex and my iPod in my sock."
Sophomore Foluke Akinradewo and the Cardinal (18-2,0-1 Pac
-10) took out their frustration the next night on the hapless Wildcats
(10-13,1-10). Akinradewo led her team to the sweep with 17 kills on
career-high .850 hitting and three aces.
"The key thing is that it is always hard to win on the road." head
coach John Dunning said. "Whenever you travel, if you let down you
are going to lose. So our goal has just been to play consistent and we
have done that."
