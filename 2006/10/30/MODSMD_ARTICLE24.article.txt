Stanford's No. 6 women's swimming and diving team
won 14 of the first 16 contested events in a two-day non
conference meet against Texas in Austin this past week
end. With the win. the Cardinal recorded their third dual
meet victory of the season with a 195-150 win over the No.
11 Longhorns. Stanford swimmers also reached NCAA
"A" times — which automatically qualify them for the
NCAA Championships — in four separate events.
Freshman Julia Smit put up "A" times in both of the

meet's individual medley events, winning Friday's 400 IM
by a margin of almost 10 seconds and competing as an ex
hibition swimmer in Saturday's 200 IM. Smit's time of 4
minutes. 10.% seconds in the 400 made her the N0.5 all
time Stanford performer in the event. Smit also won the
200 backstroke on Friday with an NCAA "B" time of
1:59.32. In addition, Smit's 100 back swim in the4oo-med
lev relay earned her another "B" time.
Freshman Elaine Breeden continued her impressive
performance this season, winning both the 100 and 200
butterfly and recording a "B" time — good enough to be
considered for a bid to the NCAAs — of 53.85 in the 100.
Breeden also swam to a third-place finish in the 100 free
with a "B" time of 50.34.
"Julia Smit and Flaine Breeden really showed that
they are uoing to be a threat to win in every meet we have

(liis year," head coach Lea Maurer said "We hope their
toughness becomes contagious on our team. All of our
freshmen have really added something to the program
and ii showed this weekend."
Junior Brooke Bishop reached the "A" standard with
her 2:10.19 time in the 200 breaststroke on Friday. She
also put up NCAA "B" times in two more first-place fin
ishes— in the 100 free and 100 back — with times of
49.61 and 54.59, respectively.
"Bishop has become the real 'go to' person on our
team over the past year and a half." Maurer said. "Her
presence gives all of her teammates confidence when she
steps on the blocks."
There was another "A" time to add to the list. Junior
Caroline Bruce's 22.71 exhibition
swim in Saturday's 50 tree was also
the fastest time in the race.
"For Caroline, this meet was a
nice affirmation that all of the hard
work she has been putting in rehabil
itating her shoulder following sur
gery last spring is on the right track."
Maurer said. "Her goals are set high
and she is off to a great start in reach
ing them at the end of the season."
Stanford's other individual win
ners included Cassidy K.rug in the 1-
meter diving event, Desiree Stahley
in the 500 free, Lauren Costella in
the 1,650 free and Whitney Spence in
the 200 free. All three swimmers put
up "B" times.
The Stanford women also won
the meet's first three relays and
recorded the fastest time in the
fourth as an exhibition team. The
women achieved "B" times in all
four relays.

relay, sophomore Madeline Rovira
