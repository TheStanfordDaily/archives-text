# First look at men's hoops
## Fans get a chance to check out the many new faces at open intrasquad game 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Just more than a week before the Stanford men tip off the ex
hibition season, Cardinal fans and community members re
ceived a sneak peak at Saturday's open practice and intrasquad
scrimmage at Maples Pavilion.
The scrimmage, which was followed by a fan interaction and
autograph session, was primarily aimed toward a younger
crowd. But for all in attendance, it was the first opportunity to
see a handful of fresh and familiar faces back in action.
There was 2005 graduate Nick Robinson, hero of the Feb.
2004 victory over Arizona, now patrolling the sidelines as an as
sistant coach. Former assistant coach Doug Oliver was also back
for the Cardinal after eight years as head coach at Idaho State.
But for many, the primary draw was the chance to finally see the
gems of the Cardinal's 2006 freshman class: 7-foot All-Ameri
cans Brook and Robin Lopez.
While Brook Lopez is still recovering from a Sept. 22 back
surgery to repair a bulging disc — an injury that will sideline him
through the season's opening games — his brother Robin start
ed at center for the white squad and immediately received the
ball in the post on the game's opening play. Although he missed
his first opportunity — drawing the obligatory sighs from an
anxious crowd — he treated fans to a variety of passes, post-up
moves, put-backs and hook shots en route to scoring eight

points.
Freshman forward Landry Fields,playing on the white squad,
and senior guard Carlton Weatherby, for the red. were the lead
ing scorers with 14 points in the two 20-minute periods. Weath
erby, making his case for the Cardinal's wide-open backup point
guard slot, displayed a knack for driving to the hoop and draw
ing fouls. Fields, meanwhile, showcased a deep range vmth his
juniper.
Senior forward Fred Washington, who missed nearly all of
the 2()05-2(K)(i season with a knee injury, was one of the more
polished players on the court Saturday. Washington scored 10
points as a power forward for the white squad on a series of
slashing baseline drives and transition finishes.
After the game, Washington said he was not entirely pleased
playing out of position in the four spot, but expected the move
to be temporary. Washington will likely play most of his minutes
at small forward, with junior forward Taj Finger returning to the
starting lineup at the four. Finger, who sat out Saturday's scrim
mage after experiencing back spasms on Friday, is not expected
to miss more than the next two practices.
Throughout the scrimmage, the Cardinal demonstrated rusti
ness easily attributed to the team still being two weeks away
from regular season tip-off. While official stats were not avail
able after the practice. The Daily's informal scorekeeping re-

four players in double figures.
Starting at the power forward posi
tion for the red team, he hit an
array of put-backs and outside
shots but missed a potential scrim
mage-tying three pointer at the end

of the second period.
Freshmen Da'Veed Dildy and
Will Paul and senior walk-on Chris
Bobel also made their Stanford de
huts at Maples. Dildy, a 6-foor-5
guard who gives the Cardinal an
option to go big at the point, scored
five points but struggled with
turnovers, at one point committing
back-to-back carrying violations.
Paul, a 6-foot-9 forward, scored
seven points and largely held his
ground against the height advan
tage held by Robin Lopez. Bobel
scored his two points on a drive
and-dish by Fields late in the first
period.
