# Beavers are no push-overs
## 
### 
The good news: football didn't
lose this week.
The bad news: you probably
won't say that for the rest of the sea
son.
The major headline from this
weekend in college football was
Oregon State's dramatic 33-31 victo
ry over Southern California.
Sparked by receiver Sammie
Stroughter's beautiful punt return
for a touchdown, four USC
turnovers and a rowdy home crowd,
the Beavers jumped out to a 23-
point lead against the Trojans. As al
ways. USC battled back, but Oregon
State defensive end Jeff Van Orsow
batted down USC quarterback John
David Booty's two-point conversion
attempt with seven seconds left to
ice the win.
Given Oregon State's come
from-ahead victory, a 0-12 season is
now all but certain for Stanford.The
optimistic had thought that Stanford
could squeak past the Beavers, a tra
ditional Pac-10 also-ran. But Ore
gon State will be playing with a new
level of passion and confidence the
rest of the v ay — it shouldn't be es
pecially close in the new stadium on
Nov. 18.
With a visit from USC and trips to
surprisingly resurgent Washington
and Berkeley left on the schedule, 1
have to predict the Cardinal lose by
a combined 100 points the rest of the
way.
I'm sure not too many of you
were watching this one on your
satellite televisions, but Temple
knocked off Bowling Green 28-14
on Saturday for its first win since
2004. The significance? Stanford
now joins Duke and Florida Interna
tional as the only winless football
programs in the nation.
Speaking of Duke — this is not a
football thought but let's take a
quick look at the preseason men's
basketball coaches poll. If Stanford
can get past San Jose State and Air
Force at home on Nov. 14 and 15. the
team will travel to Kansas City over
Thanksgiving break to face Duke,
who enters the season at No. 11.
Florida. North Carolina, and Kansas
are the top three and UCLA, Ari
zona and Washington represent the
Pac-10 at numbers 5. 10 and 16, re
spectively. Gonzaga, who visits in
February, is 26th. and Nevada. Trent
Johnson's old school, is No. 25. Stan
ford didn't receive a single vote.
