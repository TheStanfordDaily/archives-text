# Beavers are no push-overs
## 
### 
The good news: football didn't
lose this week.
The bad news: you probably
won't say that for the rest of the sea
son.
The major headline from this
weekend in college football was
Oregon State's dramatic 33-31 victo
ry over Southern California.
Sparked by receiver Sammie
Stroughter's beautiful punt return
for a touchdown, four USC
turnovers and a rowdy home crowd,
the Beavers jumped out to a 23-
point lead against the Trojans. As al
ways. USC battled back, but Oregon
State defensive end Jeff Van Orsow
batted down USC quarterback John
David Booty's two-point conversion
attempt with seven seconds left to
ice the win.
Given Oregon State's come
from-ahead victory, a 0-12 season is
now all but certain for Stanford.The
optimistic had thought that Stanford
could squeak past the Beavers, a tra
ditional Pac-10 also-ran. But Ore
gon State will be playing with a new
level of passion and confidence the
rest of the v ay — it shouldn't be es
pecially close in the new stadium on
Nov. 18.
With a visit from USC and trips to
surprisingly resurgent Washington
and Berkeley left on the schedule, 1
have to predict the Cardinal lose by
a combined 100 points the rest of the
way.
I'm sure not too many of you
were watching this one on your
satellite televisions, but Temple
knocked off Bowling Green 28-14
on Saturday for its first win since
2004. The significance? Stanford
now joins Duke and Florida Interna
tional as the only winless football
programs in the nation.
Speaking of Duke — this is not a
football thought but let's take a
quick look at the preseason men's
basketball coaches poll. If Stanford
can get past San Jose State and Air
Force at home on Nov. 14 and 15. the
team will travel to Kansas City over
Thanksgiving break to face Duke,
who enters the season at No. 11.
Florida. North Carolina, and Kansas
are the top three and UCLA, Ari
zona and Washington represent the
Pac-10 at numbers 5. 10 and 16, re
spectively. Gonzaga, who visits in
February, is 26th. and Nevada. Trent
Johnson's old school, is No. 25. Stan
ford didn't receive a single vote.

Analysis
Back to football, (JSC's loss
guaranteed yet another controver
sy in selecting the BCS Champi
onship Game participants.The win
ner of the colossal Ohio State-
Michigan tilt (which yours truly
might just he covering for the
Daily) is guaranteed one slot (bar
ring a major upset before then, of
course), but who will line up oppo
site them? In this week's BCS
standings No. 1 Ohio State and No.
2 Michigan have .99 and .97 points,
while a pack of West Virginia, Flori
da, Louisville. Auburn. Texas, (JSC,
Notre Dame, Cal and Tennessee
and Rutgers follow, in that order,
each with .70 to .79 points.

West Virginia. Louisville and
Rutgers, all undefeated, will each
play each other. If one of those
three finishes the season undefeat
ed, they will have a strong argu
ment for a berth in the BCS Cham
pionship Game — as will Florida
and Texas if they go on to win their
respective conference title games.
Michigan and Ohio State have such
a huge lead on the field (and such
love from the computers) that the
loser of that game might just back
its way into a rematch.
On the West Coast, USC has two
opportunities to impress with Cali
fornia and Notre Dame upcoming.
So who gets in?
After looking way too long at
the numbers, here's my take as to
the pecking order: undefeated
Ohio State/Michigan, Florida, one
loss Ohio State/Michigan, West Vir
gin ia/Louisvilie/Rutgers, USC.

Texas.
So, for example, USC would
need Florida and the Big East tri
umvirate to all lose, and either
Michigan or Ohio State to lose
twice to sneak back into the nation
al title game.
The problem for Stanford? USC
knows it has a long climb and
knows that it needs to show it is
dominant as ever to climb in the
polls. The Trojans have the play
makers and. after last week, the
anger and motivation to pile on
score after score on hapless Stan
ford. I think USC wins by over 40.
And it would be more without
these new game-shortening clock
rules, or if Pete Carroll and Walt
Harris weren't good friends.

guaranteed yet another controver
sy in selecting the BCS Champi
onship Game participants.The win
ner of the colossal Ohio State-
Michigan tilt (which yours truly
might just he covering for the
Daily) is guaranteed one slot (bar
ring a major upset before then, of
course), but who will line up oppo
site them? In this week's BCS
standings No. 1 Ohio State and No.
2 Michigan have .99 and .97 points,
while a pack of West Virginia, Flori
da, Louisville. Auburn. Texas, (JSC,
Notre Dame, Cal and Tennessee
and Rutgers follow, in that order,
each with .70 to .79 points.

West Virginia. Louisville and
Rutgers, all undefeated, will each
play each other. If one of those
three finishes the season undefeat
ed, they will have a strong argu
ment for a berth in the BCS Cham
pionship Game — as will Florida
and Texas if they go on to win their
respective conference title games.
Michigan and Ohio State have such
a huge lead on the field (and such
love from the computers) that the
loser of that game might just back
its way into a rematch.
On the West Coast, USC has two
opportunities to impress with Cali
fornia and Notre Dame upcoming.
So who gets in?
After looking way too long at
the numbers, here's my take as to
the pecking order: undefeated
Ohio State/Michigan, Florida, one
loss Ohio State/Michigan, West Vir
gin ia/Louisvilie/Rutgers, USC.

Texas.
So, for example, USC would
need Florida and the Big East tri
umvirate to all lose, and either
Michigan or Ohio State to lose
twice to sneak back into the nation
al title game.
The problem for Stanford? USC
knows it has a long climb and
knows that it needs to show it is
dominant as ever to climb in the
polls. The Trojans have the play
makers and. after last week, the
anger and motivation to pile on
score after score on hapless Stan
ford. I think USC wins by over 40.
And it would be more without
these new game-shortening clock
rules, or if Pete Carroll and Walt
Harris weren't good friends.
