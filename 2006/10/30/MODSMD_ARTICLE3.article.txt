### ANDREW VALENCIA 
If you knew that Sen. Joseph
Lieberman is the author of five
books, perhaps you should have at
tended the Quiz Bowl intramural
tournament on Saturday.
From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., 15 four
person teams were given the chance

to test their knowledge of a vast
array of trivia, ranging from history
and literature to popular culture, to
win prizes such as Sixth Man Club
memberships and gift certificates to
the Stanford Store.
Organizers designed the tourna
ment as a recruiting event and kept it
open to all students, attracting a
number of first-timers in addition to
students with past trivia experience.
"I've got a friend who's on the
Quiz Bowl team, and he kind of
talked me into it," said sophomore
Chad Bowling, a member of team
Eazzzyyy Company. "I'm also in it
for the love of the game."
Seeded at the tournament
through a preliminary test, the
teams sparred for seven hours in
Building 60. After several rigorous
matches, second-seeded Branner
Phil/Heading took the top prize, up
setting first-seeded favorite Steely
Dan in the championship round.
The fifth-seeded FroSoCo Prole
tariat rounded off the top three after
defeating fellow dorm mates from
the Bourgeoisie in the quarterfinals
match and the third-seeded Diabol
ic Acid in the consolation match.
Quiz Bowl organizers said that
they were pleased with the turnout.
"We got a lot bigger response this
year," said tournament moderator
Brian Lindquist, a graduate student
in physics.
Quiz Bowl aims to hold at least
one intramural tournament each
year to give students a taste of what
competing is all about, said Presi
dent Craig Boge, a senior.
"It provides a way for students to
escape studying for a little while and
enjoy a friendly, competitive atmos
phere," he said.
Boge said he looked forward to
seeing new faces at future Quiz
Bowl practices.
"I think we may have drawn
some interest from some people." he
said."! think the participants gener
ally had a good time, and we'll find
out how many we recruited based
on the upcoming practices."
The Quiz Bowl Club competes in
intercollegiate tournaments
throughout the year. Last year, the
team won the Division II Champi
onship Title at the National Colle
giate competition, beating out both
Harvard and Caltech.
