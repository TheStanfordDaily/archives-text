## MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING? 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Penguins, Care Bears, dominoes, and ob
noxious tourists came ready to party at the
Mausoleum Friday night. But while organiz
ers hailed the event a success, students com
plained about overcrowding,poor audio and
a power outage that left the sound system
and their spirits down.
Following a four-year absence, publicity
and word-of-mouth sent droves of students
streaming up Palm Drive on foot and by
Marguerite shuttles. Event organizers said
they distributed 4,(XX) wristbands before
midnight and admitted more than 1 .(XX) after
the wristbands ran out.
For their part, event organizers said they
were pleased with the party's outcome.

"It feels great to be a part of bringing back
a Stanford tradition," said Junior Class Pres
ident Brett Hammon. "It's nice to plan an
event that hasn't happened in the last five
years because I'm confident that it was the
best Mausoleum Party any of the undergrads
have ever been to."
After braving the cold and walking up to
two miles from their dorms, students gave
the event sub-par ratings.
"I was expecting a lot more,so this is kind
of below my expectations," said freshman
Robert Bonkowski, who arrived dressed as
Mozart. "Because this is such a pumped-up
event, and we haven't had it for five years. I
was expecting more â€” more people, more
dancing, in general more everything."
Crissy lglesias, a 2006 graduate and party
attendee, wasn't sure Friday night was worth

the wait.
"I don't think the Class of 2(X)6 missed out
on too much," she said.
Senior Rachel Lxvy agreed, rating the
party as "okay," hut said that she was glad the
University agreed to hold it.
"This is my fourth year here, and this is the
first time that I have seen the campus ob
serve 1 lalloween in a unified way," she said.
While students griped about the lack of
music, which began at around 11 p.m., many
said that they were impressed with the differ
ent costumes students wore. Sophomore
Alex Coley, who wore a pumpkin on his
head, said that seeing everybody in costume
was the highlight of the party.
"1 saw another guy with a pumpkin head.

Thousands of students attended the Mausoleum Party on Friday night but described the party as mediocre due to a deficient audio
system and overcrowding. Despite student complaints, Junior class and ASSU organizers deemed the event a success.
