# MAUSOLEUM PARTY ATTRACTS CROWDS BUT MEETS MIXED REVIEWS
## MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING? 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Penguins, Care Bears, dominoes, and ob
noxious tourists came ready to party at the
Mausoleum Friday night. But while organiz
ers hailed the event a success, students com
plained about overcrowding,poor audio and
a power outage that left the sound system
and their spirits down.
Following a four-year absence, publicity
and word-of-mouth sent droves of students
streaming up Palm Drive on foot and by
Marguerite shuttles. Event organizers said
they distributed 4,(XX) wristbands before
midnight and admitted more than 1 .(XX) after
the wristbands ran out.
For their part, event organizers said they
were pleased with the party's outcome.

"It feels great to be a part of bringing back
a Stanford tradition," said Junior Class Pres
ident Brett Hammon. "It's nice to plan an
event that hasn't happened in the last five
years because I'm confident that it was the
best Mausoleum Party any of the undergrads
have ever been to."
After braving the cold and walking up to
two miles from their dorms, students gave
the event sub-par ratings.
"I was expecting a lot more,so this is kind
of below my expectations," said freshman
Robert Bonkowski, who arrived dressed as
Mozart. "Because this is such a pumped-up
event, and we haven't had it for five years. I
was expecting more — more people, more
dancing, in general more everything."
Crissy lglesias, a 2006 graduate and party
attendee, wasn't sure Friday night was worth

the wait.
"I don't think the Class of 2(X)6 missed out
on too much," she said.
Senior Rachel Lxvy agreed, rating the
party as "okay," hut said that she was glad the
University agreed to hold it.
"This is my fourth year here, and this is the
first time that I have seen the campus ob
serve 1 lalloween in a unified way," she said.
While students griped about the lack of
music, which began at around 11 p.m., many
said that they were impressed with the differ
ent costumes students wore. Sophomore
Alex Coley, who wore a pumpkin on his
head, said that seeing everybody in costume
was the highlight of the party.
"1 saw another guy with a pumpkin head.

and that made my night," he said.
"Other than the costumes, it was a
regular party, albeit with way more
people."
Some students eschewed tradi
tional outfits altogether. Sophomore
( h.id Bowling took one dorm mate's
lemons and turned them into lemon
ade.
"There was a girl that wanted to he
a spoon, but that didn't work out," he
said. "So I turned it into a penis."
To ensure that the party ran
smoothly, a small contingent of police
officers were on duty in addition to

Special Event patrols. Police made
one arrest for public intoxication, and
two students were transported to the
emergency room for alcohol poison
ing. Deputy Ken Bates said.
Ihough the party was officially an
alcohol-free event. Hammon ac
knowledged that some students ar
rived at the party having already con
sumed alcohol.
"Fortunately, there were only a
few belligerent people, and they were
taken care of right away," he said.
Bates said that police were con
cerned about students "frontloading"

for the party, but that there were no
major issues relating to alcohol or il
licit activity.
"One very positive thing to note is
that there was not one noise com
plaint from anyone from the City of
Palo Alto regarding the party, which
is what shut it down last time." Bates
added.
Jessica Stanley, ASSU student life
exec, and a junior, said that the Mau
soleum Party's success meant it
would definitely be organized again
next year.
