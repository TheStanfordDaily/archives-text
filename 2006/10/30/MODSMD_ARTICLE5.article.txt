## Foreign films draw audiences UNAFF screens 31 international documentaries in five days 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
After kicking off Wednesday, the United Nations
Association Film Festival (UNAFF) screened 31
films spotlighting human rights violations through
out the world, ranging from the U.S. penal system to
brain disease in Tibet.
In its ninth year, the festival featured interna
tional documentary films from 30 different nations
in Cubberly and Annenberg Auditoriums during its
five-day run before closing last night.
Chris Jenkins, who received a masters' degree in
documentary film from Stanford in 1999 and was a
cameraman for the film "Refugee All-Stars," has
worked with the film festival since it's inception in
1998.
"1 think it's daring," Jenkins said of the festival.
"Some of these films expose things that happened
as a result of our country's actions. A lot of times
people don't realize the consequences of our way of
life."
The festival played to packed houses, with most
films attracting an eclectic mix of around 200 to 300
students, faculty and community members. After
many of the showings, the filmmakers held a ques
tion and answer session.
Sophomore Weena Pun saw the documentary
"Beyond the Call" last night, which featured three
aid workers in war-torn countries.
"When 1 first read the summary, 1 was not too ex
cited," Pun said."But I thought it was interesting be
cause more common people could do it. It was just
three people. It was so down to earth. Just normal
people saying." We should do this because we care'."
Festival founder Jasmina Bqjic, a lecturer with
the Interdisciplinary Studies in the Humanities De
partment, said the festival is a forum for ideas and
news absent in the mainstream media.
"Each film goes to the core of the problems, and
you have time to talk to the filmmakers," she said.
"Films are an amazing medium to discuss problems.
ITiis festival seeks to encourage people to dig deep
er into society's problems."
Junior Ben Henretig, co-president of the Stan
lord Film Society, said that the festival was impor
tant because it gave students a chance to watch
movies and share ideas together.
"It's important to see these things in a communi
ty atmosphere," he said. "And festivals are impor
tant because they're the only chance to see a diverse
collection of films at one time in one place."
Since its inception, the UNAFF, which is unaffil
iated with the United Nations, has grown consider
ably in influence in recent years.
"We show films that wouldn't be shown at any
other film festival in the country," Jenkins said. "For
example, a film that was shown here a few years ago
wasn't shown anywhere else in the country, but it
won the Barcelona film festival prize for Best Doc-
It is recognized
by the world as
one of the most
important in
film

Dawn Jackson, who helped pro
duce "True Whispers," a film about
the Navajo codetalkers during World
War 11, said a good screening can
boost a film's commercial success.
"It helped us to get it to a wider
audience, to get it shown on ITBS
and PBS," she said. "Our first version
was only fifteen minutes, and it was
shown at the Telluride Film Festival.
ITie tremendous response we got is
what pushed us to make a longer ver
sion."
With the main festival at Stanford
now drawn to a close. UNAFF will
hit the road, appearing in Santa
Rosa, Monterey, Berkeley, Harvard
University and the University of
Wisconsin-La Crosse.
"It has grown so much." Bojic
said. "It was a small two day festival.
Now it's a five day festival and it is
recognized by the world as one of the
most important in documentary
film."
