## Shaking public interest law Conference attracts law students to social justice 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At this weekend's "Shaking the Founda
tions" conference, law professors from
around the country bemoaned the national
lack of concern in public interest law and ar
gued that social justice issues should play a
more prominent role in their field.
The Law School's seventh annual "Shak
ing the Foundations" conference featured
interactive workshops that allowed audience
members to ask speakers specific questions
on issues ranging from the environment to
poverty, drawing hundreds of students to

eight panels over the course of Friday and
Saturday.
"'Shaking the Foundations' is important
because it gives students an opportunity to
work on issues about which they feel impas
sioned. because it touches on aspects of
being a lawyer that are at the heart of our
profession but all tot) often lost in the course
of law school and because the issues it deals
with are critical in their own right," said
Dean Larry Kramer.
In a panel on Hurricane katrina Friday
afternoon, Loyola University New Orleans
Prof. Bill Quigley wondered aloud why pub
lic interest law is the exception and not the
rule in the profession.

skills, the conference enabled law
students to interact with profession
als in the progressive legal communi
ty. Second-year law student Brian
Bilford, who co-organized a session
on the future of education litigation,
said that "Shaking the Foundations"
helped him remember why he en
tered law school in the first place.
"'Shaking the Foundations' was
not only an amazing learning experi
ence, but it also brought me face to
face with progressive lawyers of the
sort I one day hope to be," Bilford
said.
Emeritus Law Prof. Barbara Bab

cock said that the title of the confer
ence was somewhat misleading,
though, remarking that students are
not shaking, hut rather building on,
legal foundations.
"The attendees recognized the
degree to which the past has large
unmet visions to bequeath to the fu
ture," Babcock said."The panels and
workshops were extraordinary in
content and well-organized. One of
my favorite workshops featured the
Receiver for the California Prisons
and other prison law advocates. De
spite how desperate the prison
healthcare system is. the speakers
gave one hope that change is possi
ble."
Third-year law student Cindy
Liou coordinated a panel session ti
tled, "Genocide and the Law: Mak
ing Human Rights Count."

"I thought that our panel was
very successful and worked out very
well because our moderator. Prof.
Jenny Martinez, kept the conversa
tion dynamic, the audience engaged
and covered a broad range of issues
related to genocide, human rights
law and international criminal tri
bunals," Liou said. "It was helpful to
have panelists from academic, prac
titioner and activist backgrounds be
cause it brought different perspec
tives and priority of interests to the
discussion."
Jessa Barnard, a second-year law
student on the event steering com
mittee, said that Bryan Stevenson,
executive director of the Equal Jus
tice Initiative, delivered an "amaz
ing" keynote speech, adding, "there
was hardly a dry eye in the audi
ence."
