If you want to make a lasting impression
on trick-or-treaters both young and old, be
creative in your treat selection. One of the
highlights of my trick-or-treating career re
mains receiving a hockey puck instead of
the standard bar of chocolate. Actually, I
believe the cranky old man was aiming for
my head, but the point still stands.
It's Surprisingly Tough (o Find Bling
This past Thursday a friend asked if I'd
be interested in going to the Mausoleum
Party dressed as the notoriously crunk
rapper/producer, Lil John. Figuring it

would be reasonably easy to procure the
requisite bling, I agreed. Three hours and
four stores later, we found what we were
looking for. That's about two hours and
three stores too many.
The House of Humor
Still looking for a costume? Not feeling
like spending three hours shopping for
one? Visit The House of Humor. That's
where I found my bling. I am forever in
debted.
Pirates and Ninjas and Bands, Oh My!
If you want to be trendy, dress as a pi
rate. If you want to be staunchly un

trendy, be a ninja. If you enjoy shameless
self-promotion, add my band on My-
Space: myspace.com/pirateandninja.
Campus Halloween Parties = Lame
"Hey, what's up?"
"Not much, you?"
"Not much. What are you?"
"A pirate. What are you?"
"Bored."
Forget "Thriller"
My Bloody Valentine's Loveless is the
only music you need for a good Halloween
party.
....OK. fine. Loveless and "Thriller."

It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown:
Better With Age
For some reason 1 find this more enter
taining every year. A lot of today's TV
shows claim they appeal to both children
and adults, but honestly, I think the bal
ance this special strikes is damn near un
beatable.
Saying, "Wow, That's a Really
Convincing Cop Outfit."
Yeah, don't.
Cirad Students Need Not Dress Up
Dissss.
