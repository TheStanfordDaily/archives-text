# An ode to spam
## 
### BRANDON SILBERSTEIN INTERMISSION SPAMMER 
11l is article shall be devoted to a won
derful thing we call "Spam." SPAM is man
ufactured by the Hormel Foods company.
Since 1937, SPAM (spicy ham) has been
produced for mass consumption in handy
dandy little 12 ounce cans. Interestingly
enough, over h billion cans of SPAM have
been sold since its creation, and every sec
ond. another 3.6 cans enter the world. In
fact, if the cans were laid end to end. they
would circle the earth over 13 times.
Now you might be asking yourself, well,
how did they come up with the name
SPAM? This is actually a great story. Ap
parently. they held a contest, and the win
ner, Kenneth Daigneau, came up with
SPAM by putting the SP from 'spice' and
the AM from 'ham' together, to create the
glorious name. For his efforts, he won 100
dollars! Isn't that nifty? Spam comes in
over 13 delicious flavors and is available
for purchase nationwide and international
ly.
With good reason, SPAM has been glo
rified by many famous personas, including
Weird AT Yankovic and Monty Python.
SPAM is a great product, and the fact that
it's capitalized makes you sound very excit
ed even by saying it! And aren't you excit
ed? Thank you. SPAM.com, for all your
helpful information!
Of course, there's also a more serious
side to spam, a darker side: the world of
electronic spam. Defined as "irrelevant
or inappropriate messages sent on the In
ternet to a large number of recipients"
(Oxford American Dictionary), spam

plagues the email addresses of mil
lions upon millions of web users
daily. Now given this definition,
you might see certain problem
with defining exactly what consti
tutes spam. For instance, what is ir
relevant? What is inappropriate?
Maybe 1 would like to refinance my
home. Maybe 1 would like to en
large my penis. Maybe I would like
to enlarge my home AND refi
nance my penis. Maybe. But not
really. I already have a great APR
on my member. That's not the
point though. The point is, who
can say what is inappropriate or
irrelevant? By this definition,
many television commercials
could be considered spam if they
expanded the definition to in
clude other media of information
delivery, because 1 don't need
Rogaine. So doesn't spam have a
right to exist?
" No.

'Ilius we enter into a dangerous, tricky,
and deceitful world. As spam blockers be
come better and better, and anti-spam laws
become harsher and more prevalent, spam
has no choice but to evolve in order to sur
vive, becoming ever sneakier, and mis
spelling ever more words. "Nhaence Uyoß

I low can we stop this threat to society?
Current legislation hasn't stopped it. Cur
rent technology can't stop it. So what can
we do? We have to stop spam at the
source. That means there's only two things
we can do: 1. Vigilante justice, lynching

any spammer you see. We'll bring back the
town courts, stocks, pillory, gallows, every
thing. And there's a simple test to see if
you're a spammer or not. You see, spam
mers are actually satanic demon-creatures
from the underworld. So. if a person is
flammable, then clearly this person is not a
spammer, because demons don't burn. So,
if you want to know if someone's a spam
mer or not, just burn that person at the
cross. If that person survives, he's clearly a
spammer and should be shot. If not, then
well, umm... it was ok during the Spanish
Inquisition?
Alright, so maybe that technique won't
be palatable to most today. Which is why

we have plan 2: fight spam with
spam! Let's see how all those
fucking spammers enjoy receiv
ing such messages as "hey, check
this out," and have it link to a
freakin porno! 4(H) times a day!
Yeah! Though the odds are they
probably already receive spam in
such quantities, and they might
actually appreciate links to
porno (when you spend all your
time in your mother's basement,
there's not much else to do ex
cept watch porn. And yes, I am
implying that spammers are life
less sacks of shit with no moral
value or worth. I'm judgmental,
so sue me).
So I guess there's just
not much to do really. We can't
beat spam. Or can we? Maybe
we can learn from SPAM. After
all, SPAM brings joy to over 1.2

million Hawaiians; maybe some
thing good can come of this. Spam has an
interesting infrastructure set up. It's able to
reach millions of people already, so if we
just changed the message... do you see
what I'm getting at here people? Spam
with SPAM! That's right! It's so simple.
Alright, we're going to start it off right
here, right now. Send the following mes
sage out to everyone you know:
SPAM! It's delicious! It loves you! And
if you don't forward this to everyone you
know, they'll never know how much SPAM
loves them too! Get on the SPAM train!
SPAM for all! Unite the world with
SPAM!
Seriously, do it.

cross. If that person survives, he's clearly a
spammer and should be shot. If not, then
well, umm... it was ok during the Spanish
Inquisition?
Alright, so maybe that technique won't
be palatable to most today. Which is why

we have plan 2: fight spam with
spam! Let's see how all those
fucking spammers enjoy receiv
ing such messages as "hey, check
this out," and have it link to a
freakin porno! 4(H) times a day!
Yeah! Though the odds are they
probably already receive spam in
such quantities, and they might
actually appreciate links to
porno (when you spend all your
time in your mother's basement,
there's not much else to do ex
cept watch porn. And yes, I am
implying that spammers are life
less sacks of shit with no moral
value or worth. I'm judgmental,
so sue me).
So I guess there's just
not much to do really. We can't
beat spam. Or can we? Maybe
we can learn from SPAM. After
all, SPAM brings joy to over 1.2

million Hawaiians; maybe some
thing good can come of this. Spam has an
interesting infrastructure set up. It's able to
reach millions of people already, so if we
just changed the message... do you see
what I'm getting at here people? Spam
with SPAM! That's right! It's so simple.
Alright, we're going to start it off right
here, right now. Send the following mes
sage out to everyone you know:
SPAM! It's delicious! It loves you! And
if you don't forward this to everyone you
know, they'll never know how much SPAM
loves them too! Get on the SPAM train!
SPAM for all! Unite the world with
SPAM!
Seriously, do it.

11l is article shall be devoted to a won
derful thing we call "Spam." SPAM is man
ufactured by the Hormel Foods company.
Since 1937, SPAM (spicy ham) has been
produced for mass consumption in handy
dandy little 12 ounce cans. Interestingly
enough, over h billion cans of SPAM have
been sold since its creation, and every sec
ond. another 3.6 cans enter the world. In
fact, if the cans were laid end to end. they
would circle the earth over 13 times.
Now you might be asking yourself, well,
how did they come up with the name
SPAM? This is actually a great story. Ap
parently. they held a contest, and the win
ner, Kenneth Daigneau, came up with
SPAM by putting the SP from 'spice' and
the AM from 'ham' together, to create the
glorious name. For his efforts, he won 100
dollars! Isn't that nifty? Spam comes in
over 13 delicious flavors and is available
for purchase nationwide and international
ly.
With good reason, SPAM has been glo
rified by many famous personas, including
Weird AT Yankovic and Monty Python.
SPAM is a great product, and the fact that
it's capitalized makes you sound very excit
ed even by saying it! And aren't you excit
ed? Thank you. SPAM.com, for all your
helpful information!
Of course, there's also a more serious
side to spam, a darker side: the world of
electronic spam. Defined as "irrelevant
or inappropriate messages sent on the In
ternet to a large number of recipients"
(Oxford American Dictionary), spam

plagues the email addresses of mil
lions upon millions of web users
daily. Now given this definition,
you might see certain problem
with defining exactly what consti
tutes spam. For instance, what is ir
relevant? What is inappropriate?
Maybe 1 would like to refinance my
home. Maybe 1 would like to en
large my penis. Maybe I would like
to enlarge my home AND refi
nance my penis. Maybe. But not
really. I already have a great APR
on my member. That's not the
point though. The point is, who
can say what is inappropriate or
irrelevant? By this definition,
many television commercials
could be considered spam if they
expanded the definition to in
clude other media of information
delivery, because 1 don't need
Rogaine. So doesn't spam have a
right to exist?
" No.

'Ilius we enter into a dangerous, tricky,
and deceitful world. As spam blockers be
come better and better, and anti-spam laws
become harsher and more prevalent, spam
has no choice but to evolve in order to sur
vive, becoming ever sneakier, and mis
spelling ever more words. "Nhaence Uyoß
L-»I*B*I*D*0!!!!!!!!!@$#$%!#%$!# a @#
%s#%& % A & %$ A %! #
I low can we stop this threat to society?
Current legislation hasn't stopped it. Cur
rent technology can't stop it. So what can
we do? We have to stop spam at the
source. That means there's only two things
we can do: 1. Vigilante justice, lynching

any spammer you see. We'll bring back the
town courts, stocks, pillory, gallows, every
thing. And there's a simple test to see if
you're a spammer or not. You see, spam
mers are actually satanic demon-creatures
from the underworld. So. if a person is
flammable, then clearly this person is not a
spammer, because demons don't burn. So,
if you want to know if someone's a spam
mer or not, just burn that person at the
cross. If that person survives, he's clearly a
spammer and should be shot. If not, then
well, umm... it was ok during the Spanish
Inquisition?
