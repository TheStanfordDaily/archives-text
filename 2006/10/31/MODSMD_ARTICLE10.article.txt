### 
The Editorial Board urges readers t(
vote yes on Prop 87. The measure, ii
passed, would impose a tax on oil pro
duction in California, ihe revenues gener
ated by this tax will be used to fund the de
velopment <>t alternative energy technolo
gies.thus decreasing our dependence on oil
accelerating the adoption of cleaner tech
nologies and improving the envi-

ronment.
Prop 87 has set an ambi

•
tious goal to reduce the
use of petroleum in
California by 25 percent
within 10 years. Of the

billion in revenues gen
erated by the proposed
tax, 26.75 percent will
he reserved for grants to
("alifornia universities to
improve economic viahil

ity and accelerate the com
mercialization of renewable
energy and energy-efficient
technologies. Such grants will help

spur the technological innovations and
breakthroughs required for a wide-scale
adoption of alternative energy.
I lie measure also offers incentives toi
consumers and state and local government
to buy alternative-energy vehicles — in
eluding Ilex fuel, hybrid and electric cars —
that emit less pollution; $600 million of tin.
revenues generated by the tax will be usee
to replace pre-1987 diesel school buses. B\

87 will help reduce our dependence on oi
imported from politically unstable regions.
Prop 87 will also help alleviate environ
mental and health problems — which an
especially serious in California. Accordinj
to a recent report released by the Nationa
Environmental Trust. I.os Angeles-area in
fants will have inhaled enough toxic pollu
tants to reach the U.S. Environmental Pro
tection Agency's (EPA) lifetime limit fo
cancer risk by the time they are two month
old. By their first birthday, these childrei
will be more than six times over the limit
Clearly, this is a problem that the stat*
needs to address now. and Prop 87 provide

a strong stepping stone tor a reform ot oil
use not only in California, but nationwide.
As expected, some of the proposition's
main opponents are oil companies, which
are pouring millions into ad campaigns to
defeat the measure. Chevron, based in San
Ramon,Calif , has estimated that il Prop 87
is passed, the company will take a pre-tax

hit of $200 million a year. But to put
this number into perspective,

Chevron recorded a profit of
$5.02 billion in just the last
three months, according to a
recent report published in

The Wall Street Journal. All
other energy companies that
released their financial re
ports in the last few weeks
also show record-breaking

profits.
A more serious concern
held by many voters is that the

proposition would result in an in
crease in California's gas prices.

which are already among the nation's high
est. 1 lowever, the California State Attorney
General has confirmed that Prop 87 makes
it illegal for oil companies to pass new exists
onto consumers by raising gas prices. While
it is difficult to enforce this provision, other
economic factors might limit the extent to
which consumers bear the burden of the
tax. Because the prices of crude oil and pe
troleum are decided by supply and demand
on a global level. California oil producers
will not be able to demand a higher price
from refineries without losing a significant
amount of business. If producers do in
crease prices, it is likely that refineries will
choose to buy oi I from out-of-state produc
ers who are not affected by the new tax.This
consideration makes it likely that il there is
an increase in the price of oil. it will not be
significant.
'I Tie Board feels that these cost concerns
are outweighed by the overwhelmingly pos
itive consequences that can be expected
from Prop 87. By injecting $4 billion into al
ternative energy research, California can
lead the nation and the world in the effort to
reclaim a clean and healthy atmosphere.
