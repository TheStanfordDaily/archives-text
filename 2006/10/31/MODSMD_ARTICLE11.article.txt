# The 						tragic ignorance of Resident Fellows
## 
### 
As you get older, it gets harder to read
the newspaper. Freshman year, I
picked up The Daily for some light
reading over a hearty Stern lunch (spaghet
ti) or a hearty Stern dinner (spaghetti). I
rarely read any articles past the first para
graph, unless someone I knew was pictured
or misquoted. I smeared spaghetti grease
over those smarmy head cut-outs they give
columnists. (Go ahead, it makes you feel
like a big man.)
Now. reading The Daily is an angry, phys
ical experience. 1 backhand articles with
doublespeak quotes from University ad
ministrators; I slam my fist against the table
when I read how they're making Full Moon
"fun for non-drinkers;" and I tear a page
asunder whenever 1 read about the lack of
support for our football squad. And then I
have to hold the two halves together to fin
ish the article.
But nothing makes me want to stuff a
dirty rag into a bottle of Everclear and light
up a Molotov Cocktail like Clyde Money
hun's letter to the editor ("Branner RFs
clear up misconception," Oct. 30). Clyde
Moneyhun does not merely represent
everything wrong with Stanford, but with
21st-century America and our global com
munity Somewhere, a pretty little fairy
with luminous rainbow wings just read his
letter and committed weeping murder-sui
cide.
A dorm reunion is the most natural thing
in the world. Sophomores gather to surprise
the little freshmen at the dorm meeting,
bringing party favors in their backpacks.
That these party favors include alcohol
should surprise no one but popes and spin
sters. We are not fifth graders, and although
it is certainly possible to have a good time
without drinks, it is also entirely possible to
have an amazing time with drinks. Of
course, the reunions are disruptive, and
freshmen need to take a break from those
I HUM papers Turn it in late; it's a good skill
to learn.
Alas, for those reunions! The old room
mates can just make out their old room be
neath the new layout, the shadow of a bean
bag where the new kids put a refrigerator. It
was a transcendent experience: The former
freshmen looking back on the best, worst,
most formative year of their lives; the new
freshmen listening with wide-eyed enthusi
asm, only now beginning to realize what lay
ahead of them. Stories were swapped, beers
were kicked back, the co-op kids took the
freshman alt-rockers out on the balcony for

some medicinal cannabis and the fraternity
boys invited the freshman girls to their next
progressive, themed something clever like
"Golf Pros and Bikini Sluts.
Clyde Moneyhun will have none of that.
Clyde Moneyhun has plans for a "nice re
union. with refreshments, publicity and the
participation of current residents and staff."
Read that again. "Nice," as any fifth-grade
English teacher could tell you, is the worst
descriptive word in the English language. It
is vanilla. It is what you call someone when
you have no romantic interest in them what
soever. Reunions should be "loud, never
ending, mindfuckingly, unbelievably awe
some," not "nice."
But don't worry, kids, there will be "re
freshments" like blue POWERade. apple
juice and perhaps even the famous Money
hun Mix (POWERade AND apple juice)!
ITiere will be "publicity," though since many
seniors had already been prepared for the
first, Moneyhun-disallowed reunion, there
was already plenty of publicity before he
sunk his loving claws in. (Don't you love
that name? Moneyhun. Moneyhun.)
One of the things they stress on the
prospective students tour is that RFs are not
"dorm parents." Clyde Moneyhun is no ex
ception. Look at the language he uses:
"unannounced and uninvited, without the
permission or even the knowledge of the
current residents and staff... a representa
tive for the seniors... future proposals..." He
sounds like a middle manager covering his
ass. He sounds like a Dorm CEO. In my
mind, he looks like Steve Carell.
Wait. I take it back. I le is a dorm parent.
Futher into the letter, after discussing how
the new reunion has been fully planned out
to prevent any accidental fun. he notes that
he and the other Branner RFs "think this is
how it should have been done in the first
place, and we welcome future proposals
from Branner alums to gather at the hall."
I lie ignorance this statement represents is
insulting to my liberal sensibility. RFs


Darren
Franich
Ire and Vice
should have nothing to do with
dorm reunions. RAs should have
nothing to do with dorm reunions.
Notifying them ahead of time is a
courtesy; it is not an imperative.

Since when did RFs become dorm
KGB?
I do not mean to insult Mr. Mon
eyhun (MONEYHUN! MONEY
HUN!), and I hope the impression
able Branner freshman do not re
spect him any less for his fascistic
bureaucratizing. I feel a strong loy
alty to my own freshman dorm RF,
University Registrar Roger Print
up, even though he. too, did his

damnedest to prevent any unau
thorized fun from taking over
Larkin. He famously took pictures
of a party that was thrown (by
freshmen!) in our basement during
Thanksgiving â€” a party (oh, heav
en forfend!) with alcohol. With
zero evidence whatsoever, he then
accused a friend of mine of throw
ing the party, and even sent said
friend to the Residence Dean. A

year or so later, the basement of
Larkin was officially closed on
weekends.
All of which shows: RFs need to
chill the hell out.

If Darren Franich ever writes a war
movie, he's going to name the callow
young rookie who loses an arm Clyde
Moneyhun. Email him more ideas at
