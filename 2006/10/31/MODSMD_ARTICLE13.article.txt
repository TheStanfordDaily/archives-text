# BOOOOO!!!!

So, today is the scariest day of the year.
Ghosts rise from the grave. Witches
concoct devious spells to bewitch inno
cent young Christians. And fishnet stockings
are acceptable fashion items.
Ah. Halloween. A time of joy. A time
when we can forget oui collective troubles to
rejoice together — for what trouble can fail
to be eased by a lurid rubber mask?
Of course, this exuberant celebration of
costume and its attendant pleasures are par
ticularly American phenomena. The rest of
the world is not quite so ready to move
"dress-up" from its usual childhood place to
the realm of the adult.
Back in the old country, costume parties
rarely survive college days. Halloween has
no place for young adults — it is solely the
realm of children, parents and pedophiles.
Still, despite this predisposition to stare
wide-eyed and bemusedly at the masquerad
ing gaggles, one would think that such a vi
brant piece of Americana would easily elicit
the enthusiasm of a foreign traveler such as I.
After all. how better to appreciate a culture
than by appropriating its costume (for exam
ple, wear a kilt in Scotland and you've pretty
much grasped the whole point of the place).
Disappointingly, however, 1 have never
really had a chance to indulge in All Hal
lows' Eve festivities to the fullest extent.lTiis
is mostly because 1 have no friends to invite
me to cool parties, but also because adult
costume are somewhat, well, adult.
Far smarter (and better paid) commenta
tors than I have observed that there is a con
tinuing transition of Halloween to Slut-o
wcen and. since plagiarism is the heart of stu
dent journalism (at least the way I practice
it), let's run with that.
Actually, I'm inclined to say that the
aforementioned transition is not so much
ongoing, as it is inherent: ( ostumes are sex.
Whatever your apparent objective and
whatever your choice of outfit, when you
dress up there is only one message: "You
want to sleep with me."
(Ok, that's a bit of an exaggeration; there
are several variations on this message de
pending on the relationship status of the at
tendee and the distance of their significant
other.)
Maybe my analysis is not quite fair. But
it's still (mostly) true.
The interesting thing is, of course, their

relevance of intention. Whether you are a girl
dressed as a boy, a boy dressed as a girl, a fe
male Frankenstein's monster or a male mu
tant, it's all the same.The pervading stench of
an animal in heat will always win through.
If one were sociologically inclined. I sup
pose there exists a bullshit academic expla
nation that one could apply ...
Perhaps the unavoidable Discovery
Channel aura arises from the switching of
masks that marks the 31st of October. It is
the one night a year we are allowed (even re
quired) to drop the facade of normalcy and
embrace our true bestial selves.
Perchance the costuming is but a trick, a
device to hide a rare display of our inner
most desires on the dance floor. It is the ulti
mate defense mechanism; the deniability
that comes with Halloween is the perfect
shield and the perfect excuse for lewd
glances, inappropriate slurring and mistimed
groping.
I lowevei. we're not on a quest for a soci
ology PhD (and anyone who is and uses the
above brilliant analysis better cite me). So,
rather than concern ourselves with the
"why," let's reflect on the consequences of
oversexed soirees.
They're hard. Despite their obvious pur
pose. costumes don't hide, they expose. And
if you're the sort of person that prefers to op
erate in the shadows (where they can't see
the acne), that's somewhat uncomfortable.
It is unreasonably difficult to charm
someone with your wit whilst dressed as a pi
rate (not least because there is almost cer
tainly another, better-looking pirate just
across the room).
We train ourselves not to judge people by
the way they look. We invest time and effort
into forcing ourselves to take pause and give
people a chance to reveal their (almost cer
tain) idiocy before condemning them for it.
Dressing up changes that dynamic — ap
pearance is king.

The uniform of Halloween is an alluring
thing. The idea itself (especially given its
modern interpretation as a slut-fest) is laden
with promise. But, somehow, it never works
out quite like that.

I'm very busy this week. Please don't get in
touch. (Vicky made me put this in:
inn 'ins&stanfonl. edit.)
