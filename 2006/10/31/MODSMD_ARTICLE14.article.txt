Hypocrisy at the Medical School
Hypocrisy in action! The Daily and The
Stanford Report have recently chosen to
highlight the decision of the Medical School
administration to basically ban all pharma
ceutical company activities at the school.This
includes rejecting gifts of items or activities
promoting drugs, such as pens, pads, lunches.
etc.This is presumably to protect the innocent
from being seduced by the clever marketing
people who try to influence prescribing
habits. Vendors of medical devices seem to be
exempt from this prohibition.
The esteemed Medical School Dean Philip
Pizzo has championed this action with unusu
al anti-industry rhetoric. Now, take a look at
the photo of the Dean on page two of the Fall
2006 issue of Stanford Medicine. I le has cho
sen to have the photographer take a picture of
him with a model of a human skeleton at his
elbow.
Those of us who are recipients of "gifts"
from the pharmaceutical industry immediate
ly recognized that this model he has chosen to
be at his side is part of the marketing by Pfiz
er. Inc. of its anti-arthritis drug Celebrex.The
base plate is imprinted with the names Searle,
Pfizer and Celebrex. I assume the Dean has
chosen this prop because he liked the subtle
message the item projects!
So much for the purity and squeaky-clean
image of the anti-pharmaceutical administra
tion that seeks to protect their oh-so-vulnera
ble students in training from the evil market
ing by big pharmaceuticals!
