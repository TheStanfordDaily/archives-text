## MEN'S SOCCER Tough SoCal road trip wears out Card Last minutes critical in SDSU loss, tie with UCLA 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
rhe Stanford men's soccer team
learned a lesson in timing this weekend
when its tie with No. 10 UCLA and its
loss to San Diego State University were
both decided with less than five min
utes of play remaining.
On Friday, the Cardinal (6-7-4,4-3-2
Pac-10) traveled to Los Angeles, where
they were sent into overtime by the
Bruins' goal with only 4:12 left to play;
the game ended in a 1-1 draw.
Throughout the first half both teams
remained scoreless, registering only
two shots apiece. In the 21st minute,
UCLA (9-5-3,4-3-2) found its best op
portunity in a header by freshman for
ward David Estrada. Three minutes
later, Stanford also got a look off a
header by redshirt junior midfielder
Kyle Hency, but a Bruin midfielder
cleared the attempt.
The Cardinal opened the second
half with an offensive surge, and junior
forward Dan Shapiro took one of his
three shots of the game only 45 seconds
after the break. UCLA countered with
a strike by Estrada, but he was called
offside.
Finally, after nearly 68 minutes of
scoreless play, Stanford took a 1-0 lead
when junior Ryan Oblak registered his
second goal of the season.
Redshirt freshman Alex
Kozachenko sent Oblak a corner kick,
and Oblak's header found net after
being deflected by a Bruin defender.
Oblak noted that the goal kept the
team motivated and excited.
"We had been dominating play and
creating some really dangerous
chances, so it was nice to finally put one
away and take the lead," he said.
"Everybody was already really
pumped and I felt that we maintained
that same intensity after the goal."
The Cardinal held off attempts by

UCLA for the next 17 minutes, includ
ing a powerful shot by freshman
Michael Stephens that hit a Stanford
defender.
I lowever, at 85:48, a cross by fresh
man defender Chance Myers found
Estrada, who buried it to tie the game.
The goal was Estrada's fourth in five
games.
Although senior midfielder Galen
Thompson got a final shot with two
minutes to go. Stanford was unable to
reclaim the lead in regulation. The
overtime period passed without suc
cess by either team,causing the game to
end in a 1-1 tie — the same score the
two teams tied by when they met Sept.
24. Oblak, though, did not believe that
the score mirrored the Cardinal's con
trol of the game.
"1 don't think that the score was an
accurate reflection of the run of play, as
we generally dominated and had the
best chances to win," he said.
While Coach Bret Simon agreed
that the team had the potential to win
the match, he was pleased with the
team's performance.
"I was very proud of the team's play
this weekend," Simon said. "This is a
very difficult road trip. I'm not sure if
we've ever won at UCLA, so getting a
draw versus a very strong team was
pretty decent. We had a number of
great chances, especially in overtime.
We were proud to get the tie, but I def
initely felt like we could have left LA
with a win."
Stanford then traveled to the San
Diego State Sports Deck to meet the
Aztecs (9-5-3, 5-2-2). The match-up
again came down to the wire, but this
time San Diego State secured a 1-0 vic
tory when freshman defender Nick
Cardenas scored in the 88th minute.
In the 18th minute, Aztec goalie
Tally Hall saved Thompson's cross.

which was the Cardinal's only shot of
the half. Despite being outshot 4-1 in
the first half, Stanford was also able
to limit San Diego State's offensive
productivity, especially by prevent
ing senior forward Andrew DiCic
co's two goal-scoring opportunities.
Both teams were scoreless at the
break.
In the second half, the Aztecs reg
istered five more shots, including
redshirt junior midfielder Kraig

Chiles' header that went high at
67:12. Stanford senior midfielder
Bret Shimizu, junior forward Dan
Shapiro and sophomore midfielder
Tunji Munabi each posted shots in
the last 45 minutes, but none found
net.
Despite a solid three-save per
formance in goal by Cardinal fresh
man John Moore, San Diego State
took advantage of a corner kick in
the 87th minute,and Cardenas head
ed in his fifth goal of the season.Time
expired before Stanford was able to
respond. The game allowed the
Aztecs to take over second place in
the Pac-10 behind No. 6 California,
bumping UCLA and Stanford into a

tie for third.
Simon, though, recognized the
challenge faced by the team in hav
ing to play back-to-back road games
against tough opponents, especially
given that San Diego State was com
ing off a big win over Cal.
"The game at San Diego State
was very difficult," Simon said.
"Coming off an overtime game at
UCLA — a game that didn't end
until nearly 11 p.m. — we were
forced to take on a quality opponent
again. With little rest, traveling and
being a little beaten-up. we really
had to have a gutsy performance —
and we did. Unfortunately, we could
n't finish the game off and gave up a

late goal off a SDSU corner kick. It
really was a heartbreaker."
Although Oblak agreed that the
game was a physical battle, he felt
that the Cardinal could have come
away with a better result.
"To be honest, overall, the week
end was a disappointment," Oblak
said. "Coming in. we were all confi
dent that we could beat both UCLA
and SD State, so we were expecting
big things. [San Diego State] man
aged to sneak one in late, but I feel
that on a different day we might have
put that one in and won the game."

rhe Stanford men's soccer team
learned a lesson in timing this weekend
when its tie with No. 10 UCLA and its
loss to San Diego State University were
both decided with less than five min
utes of play remaining.
On Friday, the Cardinal (6-7-4,4-3-2
Pac-10) traveled to Los Angeles, where
they were sent into overtime by the
Bruins' goal with only 4:12 left to play;
the game ended in a 1-1 draw.
Throughout the first half both teams
remained scoreless, registering only
two shots apiece. In the 21st minute,
UCLA (9-5-3,4-3-2) found its best op
portunity in a header by freshman for
ward David Estrada. Three minutes
later, Stanford also got a look off a
header by redshirt junior midfielder
Kyle Hency, but a Bruin midfielder
cleared the attempt.
The Cardinal opened the second
half with an offensive surge, and junior
forward Dan Shapiro took one of his
three shots of the game only 45 seconds
after the break. UCLA countered with
a strike by Estrada, but he was called
offside.
Finally, after nearly 68 minutes of
scoreless play, Stanford took a 1-0 lead
when junior Ryan Oblak registered his
second goal of the season.
Redshirt freshman Alex
Kozachenko sent Oblak a corner kick,
and Oblak's header found net after
being deflected by a Bruin defender.
Oblak noted that the goal kept the
team motivated and excited.
"We had been dominating play and
creating some really dangerous
chances, so it was nice to finally put one
away and take the lead," he said.
"Everybody was already really
pumped and I felt that we maintained
that same intensity after the goal."
The Cardinal held off attempts by

UCLA for the next 17 minutes, includ
ing a powerful shot by freshman
Michael Stephens that hit a Stanford
defender.
I lowever, at 85:48, a cross by fresh
man defender Chance Myers found
Estrada, who buried it to tie the game.
The goal was Estrada's fourth in five
games.
Although senior midfielder Galen
Thompson got a final shot with two
minutes to go. Stanford was unable to
reclaim the lead in regulation. The
overtime period passed without suc
cess by either team,causing the game to
end in a 1-1 tie — the same score the
two teams tied by when they met Sept.
24. Oblak, though, did not believe that
the score mirrored the Cardinal's con
trol of the game.
"1 don't think that the score was an
accurate reflection of the run of play, as
we generally dominated and had the
best chances to win," he said.
While Coach Bret Simon agreed
that the team had the potential to win
the match, he was pleased with the
team's performance.
"I was very proud of the team's play
this weekend," Simon said. "This is a
very difficult road trip. I'm not sure if
we've ever won at UCLA, so getting a
draw versus a very strong team was
pretty decent. We had a number of
great chances, especially in overtime.
We were proud to get the tie, but I def
initely felt like we could have left LA
with a win."
Stanford then traveled to the San
Diego State Sports Deck to meet the
Aztecs (9-5-3, 5-2-2). The match-up
again came down to the wire, but this
time San Diego State secured a 1-0 vic
tory when freshman defender Nick
Cardenas scored in the 88th minute.
In the 18th minute, Aztec goalie
Tally Hall saved Thompson's cross.

which was the Cardinal's only shot of
the half. Despite being outshot 4-1 in
the first half, Stanford was also able
to limit San Diego State's offensive
productivity, especially by prevent
ing senior forward Andrew DiCic
co's two goal-scoring opportunities.
Both teams were scoreless at the
break.
In the second half, the Aztecs reg
istered five more shots, including
redshirt junior midfielder Kraig

Chiles' header that went high at
67:12. Stanford senior midfielder
Bret Shimizu, junior forward Dan
Shapiro and sophomore midfielder
Tunji Munabi each posted shots in
the last 45 minutes, but none found
net.
Despite a solid three-save per
formance in goal by Cardinal fresh
man John Moore, San Diego State
took advantage of a corner kick in
the 87th minute,and Cardenas head
ed in his fifth goal of the season.Time
expired before Stanford was able to
respond. The game allowed the
Aztecs to take over second place in
the Pac-10 behind No. 6 California,
bumping UCLA and Stanford into a

tie for third.
Simon, though, recognized the
challenge faced by the team in hav
ing to play back-to-back road games
against tough opponents, especially
given that San Diego State was com
ing off a big win over Cal.
"The game at San Diego State
was very difficult," Simon said.
"Coming off an overtime game at
UCLA — a game that didn't end
until nearly 11 p.m. — we were
forced to take on a quality opponent
again. With little rest, traveling and
being a little beaten-up. we really
had to have a gutsy performance —
and we did. Unfortunately, we could
n't finish the game off and gave up a

late goal off a SDSU corner kick. It
really was a heartbreaker."
Although Oblak agreed that the
game was a physical battle, he felt
that the Cardinal could have come
away with a better result.
"To be honest, overall, the week
end was a disappointment," Oblak
said. "Coming in. we were all confi
dent that we could beat both UCLA
and SD State, so we were expecting
big things. [San Diego State] man
aged to sneak one in late, but I feel
that on a different day we might have
put that one in and won the game."
