## MEN'S SOCCER Tough SoCal road trip wears out Card Last minutes critical in SDSU loss, tie with UCLA 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
rhe Stanford men's soccer team
learned a lesson in timing this weekend
when its tie with No. 10 UCLA and its
loss to San Diego State University were
both decided with less than five min
utes of play remaining.
On Friday, the Cardinal (6-7-4,4-3-2
Pac-10) traveled to Los Angeles, where
they were sent into overtime by the
Bruins' goal with only 4:12 left to play;
the game ended in a 1-1 draw.
Throughout the first half both teams
remained scoreless, registering only
two shots apiece. In the 21st minute,
UCLA (9-5-3,4-3-2) found its best op
portunity in a header by freshman for
ward David Estrada. Three minutes
later, Stanford also got a look off a
header by redshirt junior midfielder
Kyle Hency, but a Bruin midfielder
cleared the attempt.
The Cardinal opened the second
half with an offensive surge, and junior
forward Dan Shapiro took one of his
three shots of the game only 45 seconds
after the break. UCLA countered with
a strike by Estrada, but he was called
offside.
Finally, after nearly 68 minutes of
scoreless play, Stanford took a 1-0 lead
when junior Ryan Oblak registered his
second goal of the season.
Redshirt freshman Alex
Kozachenko sent Oblak a corner kick,
and Oblak's header found net after
being deflected by a Bruin defender.
Oblak noted that the goal kept the
team motivated and excited.
"We had been dominating play and
creating some really dangerous
chances, so it was nice to finally put one
away and take the lead," he said.
"Everybody was already really
pumped and I felt that we maintained
that same intensity after the goal."
The Cardinal held off attempts by

UCLA for the next 17 minutes, includ
ing a powerful shot by freshman
Michael Stephens that hit a Stanford
defender.
I lowever, at 85:48, a cross by fresh
man defender Chance Myers found
Estrada, who buried it to tie the game.
The goal was Estrada's fourth in five
games.
Although senior midfielder Galen
Thompson got a final shot with two
minutes to go. Stanford was unable to
reclaim the lead in regulation. The
overtime period passed without suc
cess by either team,causing the game to
end in a 1-1 tie â€” the same score the
two teams tied by when they met Sept.
24. Oblak, though, did not believe that
the score mirrored the Cardinal's con
trol of the game.
"1 don't think that the score was an
accurate reflection of the run of play, as
we generally dominated and had the
best chances to win," he said.
While Coach Bret Simon agreed
that the team had the potential to win
the match, he was pleased with the
team's performance.
"I was very proud of the team's play
this weekend," Simon said. "This is a
very difficult road trip. I'm not sure if
we've ever won at UCLA, so getting a
draw versus a very strong team was
pretty decent. We had a number of
great chances, especially in overtime.
We were proud to get the tie, but I def
initely felt like we could have left LA
with a win."
Stanford then traveled to the San
Diego State Sports Deck to meet the
Aztecs (9-5-3, 5-2-2). The match-up
again came down to the wire, but this
time San Diego State secured a 1-0 vic
tory when freshman defender Nick
Cardenas scored in the 88th minute.
In the 18th minute, Aztec goalie
Tally Hall saved Thompson's cross.
