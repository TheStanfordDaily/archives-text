# Fightin' the system

### 
I'm not going to lie to you. I hate
Notre Dame.
Maybe it's that the independent
school doesn't have to split its mil
lions of dollars from BCS game
shares with an entire conference.
Maybe it's that they took Oregon's
rightful spot in the 1 iesta Bowl last
year. Or maybe it's that heartbreak
ing win over the Cardinal ;it the final
game at the old Stanford Stadium.
But while I may detest the leg
endary squad. I understand the logic
of the strong fan base the school has
earned throughout its history. Ihe
storied winning tradition has quite
the past: an amazing story of a school
built by Irish and Polish immigrants
who reinvented college football by
traveling across the country to find
the toughest opponents.
Notre Dame is indeed the George
W. Bush of college football — the
polarizing force that tears one half of
the country against the other.
And this past Sunday,the I ighting
Irish tore one half of a dining-liall
table against the other.
My friend made his case for why
Notre Dame belonged in the Fiesta
Bowl last year, and I made my argu
ment for why Oregon deserved the
spot. He made the good point that
the Irish had the more difficult
schedule and were within inches of
going undefeated. I, meanwhile,
stood firm in my position that the
Ducks still owned the better record
and are ranked higher in the BCS —
the system we're supposed to be
using to decide which schools make it
