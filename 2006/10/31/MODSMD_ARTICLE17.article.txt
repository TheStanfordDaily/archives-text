# Fightin' the system

### 
I'm not going to lie to you. I hate
Notre Dame.
Maybe it's that the independent
school doesn't have to split its mil
lions of dollars from BCS game
shares with an entire conference.
Maybe it's that they took Oregon's
rightful spot in the 1 iesta Bowl last
year. Or maybe it's that heartbreak
ing win over the Cardinal ;it the final
game at the old Stanford Stadium.
But while I may detest the leg
endary squad. I understand the logic
of the strong fan base the school has
earned throughout its history. Ihe
storied winning tradition has quite
the past: an amazing story of a school
built by Irish and Polish immigrants
who reinvented college football by
traveling across the country to find
the toughest opponents.
Notre Dame is indeed the George
W. Bush of college football — the
polarizing force that tears one half of
the country against the other.
And this past Sunday,the I ighting
Irish tore one half of a dining-liall
table against the other.
My friend made his case for why
Notre Dame belonged in the Fiesta
Bowl last year, and I made my argu
ment for why Oregon deserved the
spot. He made the good point that
the Irish had the more difficult
schedule and were within inches of
going undefeated. I, meanwhile,
stood firm in my position that the
Ducks still owned the better record
and are ranked higher in the BCS —
the system we're supposed to be
using to decide which schools make it

to the bowl games in the first place.
Eventually, we had to agree to
disagree.
And then we discussed Notre
Dame's chances of winning a nation
al title.
"Not too likely," I said, referenc
ing the Irish's current No. 11 spot in
the AP Poll and their No. 9 spot in
the BCS.
But wait a second. I realized that
Notre Dame was ranked below USC
despite losing to the nation's second
ranked team, Michigan. USC. mean
while, lost to Oregon State — yes,
the Beavers.
How can USC be ranked above
Notre Dame when the Trojans laid
an egg against a team that's many
levels below the Wolverines? Well,
perhaps it's because USC came close
enough to squeak out the win in
their sole loss, while Notre Dame got
pummelcd in their only failure of the
season.
As it the whole situation weren't
confusing enough already, the plot
continues to thicken.
Notre Dame was leapfrogged by
Florida in last week's coach's poll,
despite the Irish's impressive last
minute win over UCLA and the
Gators' idleness during their bye
week.
For once, 1 agreed with Charlie
Weiss in his frustration with the
BCS.
"You know what?," I retorted to
my comrade, taking another bite out
of my omelet. "We could all agree
that we wouldn't be having this de
bate if the BCS were simply replaced
with a winner-take-all playoff sys
tem!"
"Ehhh. 1 don't know, mate," an
other friend said."Then you'd have a
bunch of 9-2 teams arguing over the

No. 8 spot."
Truf," I conceded.
Indeed, it seems as though there
just isn't a clear solution to the whole
college football problem, (iiven the
current conference format, it's im
possible to tell whether a 6-2 SEC
team like Louisiana State is truly
better than a 7-1 Pac-10 team like
California. We can't necessarily use
the Bears' 35-18 loss to Tennessee as
the measuring stick for the Pac-10 vs.
the SEC, as we may never know who
would come out on top of a USC-
Florida match-up. My God. the hor
ror and confusion!
And while I'm looking up rank
ings on Yahoo.com, is that Washing
ton State 1 see with the No. 25 spot in
the nation?! It must have happened
while I was sleeping during that
extra hour after the end of Daylight
saving time.
At the end of the day.it seems the
frustration shared by college foot
ball fans across the country is the
same thing that brings them togeth
er.
We. as fans, will forever be able to
debate the possibilities of a USC-
Utah game two years ago. or Florida
State's national title over Notre
Dame in 1993 despite falling to the
Irish on Nov. 13.
Despite the loads of work I had
on Sunday, 1 stayed at the dining
hall table for close to an hour debat
ing the problems that plague the
sport. Surely, I wouldn't have talked
college football for so long had
there not existed so much room for
argument. So, in a way, 1 guess I am
rather thankful for such a flawed
system that allows for so much dia
logue.
As much as we may complain
about the NCAA and the BCS, you
got to hand one thing to college foot
ball: it sure knows how to get people
talking.

Notre Dame is indeed the George
W. Bush of college football — the
polarizing force that tears one half of
the country against the other.
And this past Sunday,the I ighting
Irish tore one half of a dining-liall
table against the other.
My friend made his case for why
Notre Dame belonged in the Fiesta
Bowl last year, and I made my argu
ment for why Oregon deserved the
spot. He made the good point that
the Irish had the more difficult
schedule and were within inches of
going undefeated. I, meanwhile,
stood firm in my position that the
Ducks still owned the better record
and are ranked higher in the BCS —
the system we're supposed to be
using to decide which schools make it

to the bowl games in the first place.
Eventually, we had to agree to
disagree.
And then we discussed Notre
Dame's chances of winning a nation
al title.
"Not too likely," I said, referenc
ing the Irish's current No. 11 spot in
the AP Poll and their No. 9 spot in
the BCS.
But wait a second. I realized that
Notre Dame was ranked below USC
despite losing to the nation's second
ranked team, Michigan. USC. mean
while, lost to Oregon State — yes,
the Beavers.
How can USC be ranked above
Notre Dame when the Trojans laid
an egg against a team that's many
levels below the Wolverines? Well,
perhaps it's because USC came close
enough to squeak out the win in
their sole loss, while Notre Dame got
pummelcd in their only failure of the
season.
As it the whole situation weren't
confusing enough already, the plot
continues to thicken.
Notre Dame was leapfrogged by
Florida in last week's coach's poll,
despite the Irish's impressive last
minute win over UCLA and the
Gators' idleness during their bye
week.
For once, 1 agreed with Charlie
Weiss in his frustration with the
BCS.
"You know what?," I retorted to
my comrade, taking another bite out
of my omelet. "We could all agree
that we wouldn't be having this de
bate if the BCS were simply replaced
with a winner-take-all playoff sys
tem!"
"Ehhh. 1 don't know, mate," an
other friend said."Then you'd have a
bunch of 9-2 teams arguing over the

No. 8 spot."
Truf," I conceded.
Indeed, it seems as though there
just isn't a clear solution to the whole
college football problem, (iiven the
current conference format, it's im
possible to tell whether a 6-2 SEC
team like Louisiana State is truly
better than a 7-1 Pac-10 team like
California. We can't necessarily use
the Bears' 35-18 loss to Tennessee as
the measuring stick for the Pac-10 vs.
the SEC, as we may never know who
would come out on top of a USC-
Florida match-up. My God. the hor
ror and confusion!
And while I'm looking up rank
ings on Yahoo.com, is that Washing
ton State 1 see with the No. 25 spot in
the nation?! It must have happened
while I was sleeping during that
extra hour after the end of Daylight
saving time.
At the end of the day.it seems the
frustration shared by college foot
ball fans across the country is the
same thing that brings them togeth
er.
We. as fans, will forever be able to
debate the possibilities of a USC-
Utah game two years ago. or Florida
State's national title over Notre
Dame in 1993 despite falling to the
Irish on Nov. 13.
Despite the loads of work I had
on Sunday, 1 stayed at the dining
hall table for close to an hour debat
ing the problems that plague the
sport. Surely, I wouldn't have talked
college football for so long had
there not existed so much room for
argument. So, in a way, 1 guess I am
rather thankful for such a flawed
system that allows for so much dia
logue.
As much as we may complain
about the NCAA and the BCS, you
got to hand one thing to college foot
ball: it sure knows how to get people
talking.
