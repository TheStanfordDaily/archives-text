men claimed first, second and third place spots in
every event of the day.

Dunford. Though he specializes in sprint events,
Dunford swam to victory in the 500 free, lie also
contributed to the Cardinal winning the 2(H) medley
relay, along with senior Andy Grant and sophomores
Chris Ash and Dan Priestley. Dunford claims the
meet helped the men practice racing at an early
point in the season.
"We swam Bakersfield because il gave us a
chance to race and gauge where we are at in terms of
our training," he said. "I think it went well even
though we put a number of guys in unusual events.
There were some promising swims and relav splits."
Senior Kyle Ransom had similar
success, taking first in the 100 hack
stroke and swimming in the fastest
200-free relay of the day in an exhi
bition with freshmen Matt Crowe,
Alex Colville and David Dunford.

the event was swum exhibition.
In the divers' first competition of
the season, sophomore Dwight Du
mais took top honors in the one

meter. while junior Nathan Kim
posted the highest score in the
three-meter event.
Winning early on in the season
leaves the Cardinal optimistic they
can live up to some of their lofty
preseason goals.
"As always, we hope to win the
NCAA championship, but so far,
this year looks particularly promis
ing," 1 Dunford said. "We have a
team full of talent and a senior class
that has been one of the best swim
ming classes in Stanford history.
They will most certainly lead from
the front."
Up next for the Cardinal is a
meet against No. 6 California at
Averv Nov. 8.

"As always, we hope to win the
NCAA championship, but so far,
this year looks particularly
promising."
