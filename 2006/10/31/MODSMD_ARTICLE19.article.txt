In their first dual meet of the year, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's swim and dive team ruled the Avery
Aquatic Center on Friday, defeating ( al State Hak
ersfield 127-62. Dominating the meet, the Cardinal
men claimed first, second and third place spots in
every event of the day.
The top scorer of the day was sophomore Jason
Dunford. Though he specializes in sprint events,
Dunford swam to victory in the 500 free, lie also
contributed to the Cardinal winning the 2(H) medley
relay, along with senior Andy Grant and sophomores
Chris Ash and Dan Priestley. Dunford claims the
meet helped the men practice racing at an early
point in the season.
"We swam Bakersfield because il gave us a
chance to race and gauge where we are at in terms of
our training," he said. "I think it went well even
though we put a number of guys in unusual events.
There were some promising swims and relav splits."
