# CONCERT NETWORK
## Guster to be Big Game Show artist Folk-rock group follows in the footsteps of Talib Kweli, Jason Mraz 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
"One Man Wrecking Machine" won't just referto
a UC-Berkeley linebacker this Big Game weekend.
The folk-rock hand Guster will visit Memorial
Auditorium to perform in the annual Big Game
Show Sun., Dec. 3, the day after Big Game.
The Stanford Concert Network, responsible for
booking Guster and running the show, announced
the news last night. SCN Director Megan Green, a
senior, said that Spoon and Sufjan Stevens were
other possibilities, but Guster was the top choice.
"We've been using Facebook a little bit to figure
out who the students like, and Guster is way up
there in terms of Facebook rating," said Green, who
has seen Guster perform at the Warfield in San
Francisco. "We thought it was a good fit for Memo
rial Auditorium and Big Game."
Guster kicks off a 14-stop, four-month tour,
today in Omaha, Neb., mostly of college campuses.
The four-man group will perform in Geneva, N.Y.,
and Orono. Maine, before Stanford, the ninth stop
on the tour, and in Walla Walla, Wash., two days
after.
The tour stops are far from the biggest venues in
the country, but that's just fine for Stanford Concert
Network, a group that didn't want to spend all its
limited annual budget on booking one act.
"We went right down the list and people were ei
ther too big or dead," Green said. "We're excited be
cause our goal is to bring to campus someone people
really want to see and from everything we've tried to
gather, Guster is the one."
Hip-hop artist Talib Kweli and acoustic pop star
Jason Mraz performed at the last two Big Game
Shows in 2004 and 2003, respectively. SCN started
planning too late to book Memorial Auditorium for
last year's Big Game Show.
Mos Dot. Eve 6, Something Corporate, Nappy Roots, Jack
Johnson. Common and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy are among the
bigger names SC'N has brought to campus since 2(KH).
"We wanted to go with a rock show this year since it's been
hip-hop heavy," Green said.
Adam Gardner and Ryan Miller both sing and play guitar for
the band, which formed when the four were students at Tufts Uni
veristy in Boston. Percussionist Brian Rosenworcel and instru
mentalist Joe Pisapia round out the group.
Two of the band's most popular songs are "Amsterdam," off
the 2(M)3 album "Keep it Together," and "One Man Wrecking
Machine," off the "Ganging Upon the Sun" album released ear
lier this year.
The hand's lyrics reflect a questioning of one's identity all
too common to bands that pander to the college audience, but
also a tongue-in-cheek appreciation of life's small ironies.
"I built a time machine I'm going to see the homecoming
queen/Take her to the Christmas dance/Maybe now I'll get in
her pants, "opens"One Man Wrecking Machine
The band prides itself on environmental conservation, pow
ering it< bus (Mi biodeisel and its performances on wind in a re
cent toui rhe\ are donating a portion of their ticket revenues
at the Stanford concert to a carbon-offset program.
Tickets tor the show, which starts at 7:30 p.m.. will cost $23
for students. Dorm presales begin today, with the dorms buy
ing the highest percentage of tickets qualifying for priority
seating, and,possibly, a chance to meet and greet the band.
The general public will be able to purchase leftover tickets
Nov. b at $33 apiece.
