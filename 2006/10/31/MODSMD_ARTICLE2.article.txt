"One Man Wrecking Machine" won't just referto
a UC-Berkeley linebacker this Big Game weekend.
The folk-rock hand Guster will visit Memorial
Auditorium to perform in the annual Big Game
Show Sun., Dec. 3, the day after Big Game.
The Stanford Concert Network, responsible for
booking Guster and running the show, announced
the news last night. SCN Director Megan Green, a
senior, said that Spoon and Sufjan Stevens were
other possibilities, but Guster was the top choice.
"We've been using Facebook a little bit to figure
out who the students like, and Guster is way up
there in terms of Facebook rating," said Green, who
has seen Guster perform at the Warfield in San
Francisco. "We thought it was a good fit for Memo
rial Auditorium and Big Game."
Guster kicks off a 14-stop, four-month tour,
today in Omaha, Neb., mostly of college campuses.
The four-man group will perform in Geneva, N.Y.,
and Orono. Maine, before Stanford, the ninth stop
on the tour, and in Walla Walla, Wash., two days
after.
The tour stops are far from the biggest venues in
the country, but that's just fine for Stanford Concert
Network, a group that didn't want to spend all its
limited annual budget on booking one act.
"We went right down the list and people were ei
ther too big or dead," Green said. "We're excited be
cause our goal is to bring to campus someone people
really want to see and from everything we've tried to
gather, Guster is the one."
Hip-hop artist Talib Kweli and acoustic pop star
Jason Mraz performed at the last two Big Game
Shows in 2004 and 2003, respectively. SCN started
planning too late to book Memorial Auditorium for
last year's Big Game Show.
