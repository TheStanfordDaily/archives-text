## Prop. 89 would raise taxes and limit personal freedom 
### MEGAN REISS 
In the movie "Thank Vou For Smoking," the
lead character falls victim to the moral outrage
against special interest groups. His crime: serving
as a spokesman for the evil tobacco industry. His
punishment: suffering a nicotine-patch overdose
in the arms of Honest Abe.
Proposition 89 is taking a similar stand to the
smoke-free "enthusiasts" in the movie. The targets
of the proposition are special interest groups â€”
namely corporations, political committees and in
dividuals willing to shell out an extraordinary
amount of money to political campaigns and bal
lot initiatives.
The proposition is meant to level the playing
ground for all political candidates. Candidates will
have the option of receiving money from the state
to finance their campaign. Now all candidates,
after collecting a little seed money and a certain
number of five-dollar collections from voters, will
be able to escape the strong hold that big business

supposedly has around every candidate in Califor
nia.
However, there are three major issues with
Prop 89.
The first issue is that businesses and financial
institutions will experience a tax increase in order
to fund the campaign finance reform. And when
taxes go up. business passes the burden onto the
consumer.
In addition, the hundreds of millions of dollars
collected from the tax increase will go into a Clean
Money Fund (as compared to the dirty, tobacco
laced dollars that candidates currently use). Busi
nesses and consumers will have no say over where
their tax dollars go. So what if the oil company
ends up funding the Green Party candidate's bid
for senate?
The second major issue deals with personal
contributions. The proposition would place signif
icant limitations on how much an individual may
contribute to a candidate or even a political party's
election cycle funds.

Any time a law limits personal freedom, we
should step hack and re-evaluate why we are im
plementing censorship on ourselves. Do we really
want to hinder our right to spend our own money?
The final misgiving lies with the exemption
clause for non-profit organizations. Non-profit or
ganizations will he able to donate to ballot meas
ures and propositions as they see fit, as long as they
tell donators that some of the money may go to po
litical causes.
In other words, as long as the smoke-free "en
thusiasts" don't try to turn a profit, they can try to
buy a proposition. Small business is restricted, but
they are only in it for the money anyways.
Unless we are willing to increase our own taxes
in order to spend millions for a candidate's mud
slinging television ads, we will have to find an alter
native to Prop 89.
