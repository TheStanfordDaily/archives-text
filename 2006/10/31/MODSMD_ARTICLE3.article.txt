# An honest search for the truth or yet another conspiracy theory?
## 911 call on 9/11 response Leftist "Press jar Truth" documentary highlights governmental failures to secure safety, suggests cover-ups 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At a Friday screening of t he doc
umentary "9/11: Press for Truth" at
Gunn High School, Stanford grad
Paul Thompson and Berkeley Eng
lish Prof. Peter Dale Scott charged
the Bush administration of failing
to make Americans safer and
pointed to a governmental
cover-up at the film's Palo

Alto debut.
Much of the content. which
traces the events and govern-

ment actions leading up) to the
terrorist attacks, is based on
Thompson's book, "The Com
plete 9/11 Timeline." In addi-

tion to news clips and govern
ment evidence, the film uses
survivor statements to raise
provocative questions re
garding the attacks and
the role of the current ad
ministration.

k "In looking at
1 what happened since 9/11,1
don't feel like this country has
been secured or made safer in
any way, shape or form,"

Thompson said. "It is just so
shocking what has not been
done. This country is so open to
another attack. It wouldn't
even take A 1 Qaeda at this

point."
In a discussion session im-

mediately proceeding the
film, Thompson was joined by

|p Scott to gauge the film's politi
cal implications. Scott, who has
penned numerous articles on ter
rorism and the 9/11 attacks, ex
pressed serious doubts in the abili
ty of any administration to secure
the country against Al-Qaeda.
"We have a big problem
right now in which we need a more

serious remedy than a Democrat in
the White House," Scott said.
"There is this whole interlocking
milieu of intelligence agencies and
the terrorists they sponsor, and they
are so clearly imbedded in each
other that there is no clear decisive
action to stop them.The CIA is still
sponsoring terrorism, and after five
years of this 'War on Terror,' we can
say that the net result is a far more
dangerous world than we had be
fore."
Thompson said that while he
based his opinions on facts only,
government inaction leading up the
attacks reached a criminal level.
"If you follow the incompetence
theory, it would be such gross crimi
nal negligence to have so many
warnings and do absolutely nothing
in response that that alone should
lead to the impeachment of the
Bush administration," Thompson
said."lf you look at the untrue state
ments that we know the top officials
have said under oath, that right
there should be a minimum five
year prison sentence."
In addition to the administra
tion's role, the film focused on what
it labeled as gaps and contradictions
in the 9/11 Commission. It em
ployed the "Jersey Girls," a group of
four women widowed by the at
tacks, to trace the steps in the inves
tigative process.
"There has been a massive cover
up from the beginning," Scott said.
"And while we hoped that the Com
mission might do something to end
the cover-up, it actually participated
in it. The odd paradox is that it's not
just the mainstream press that does
n't want to go there. It's people like
Noam Chomsky that don't want to
go there. We have to make America

go there."
While most audience members reacted en
thusiastically towards the discussion and film's
content, a few felt that both stopped short of un
earthing some of the more controversial ques
tions. Dennis Galen Mitrzyk, a social activist
from Los Altos, said he was disappointed that
Stark and Thompson hadn't addressed what he
believed to be the administration's active role in
the attacks.
"I feel that Paul and Peter are both guilty of
taking a position known as the limited hang
out.'" Mitrzyk said."Paul is assuming that it is Al-
Qaeda who did it. My specialty is the collapse of
the towers, and the collapse was clearly con
trolled demolition, and if it was this, than it was
clearly not Al-Qaeda. It's a very different situa
tion if Bush and the neo-cons planned it."
A number of people walked out in frustra
tion during the discussion session, with one au
dience member loudly charging that the "de
struction of Israel" was all the U.S. needed to
maintain political stability.
