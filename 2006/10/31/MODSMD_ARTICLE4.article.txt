# COMMUNITY FARM
## Seeds of contention Farmers indignant over golf course construction 
### LYNDA BROWNING 
One day last spring, the Stanford Communi
ty Farmers came to their individual plots to find
that the quiet setting on the outskirts of West
Campus had changed. Bulldozers were churn
ing up the open oak woodland surrounding the
farm to clear the way for a new golf course.
Grasses and low shrubs gave way to a sea of
ruddy clay, leaving ground squirrels and go
phers hungry for a new home and food source.

As the displaced rodents fled into the farm
land, the farmers were forced to fight back: all
around the individual plots, cages have sprung
up. Downed tree branches are tied together and
strung with mesh to form fortress-like defenses
against the invaders; bright cherry tomatoes
poke through the netting.
Even with protection, crops are lost. "This
year ,aU of my vegetables were eaten, despite
the fact that most had wire cages below the
roots," said Elizabeth Miller. Professor of Geo
logical and Earth Sciences and farm user for the
past seven years.
