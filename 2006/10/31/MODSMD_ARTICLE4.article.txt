# COMMUNITY FARM
## Seeds of contention Farmers indignant over golf course construction 
### LYNDA BROWNING 
One day last spring, the Stanford Communi
ty Farmers came to their individual plots to find
that the quiet setting on the outskirts of West
Campus had changed. Bulldozers were churn
ing up the open oak woodland surrounding the
farm to clear the way for a new golf course.
Grasses and low shrubs gave way to a sea of
ruddy clay, leaving ground squirrels and go
phers hungry for a new home and food source.

As the displaced rodents fled into the farm
land, the farmers were forced to fight back: all
around the individual plots, cages have sprung
up. Downed tree branches are tied together and
strung with mesh to form fortress-like defenses
against the invaders; bright cherry tomatoes
poke through the netting.
Even with protection, crops are lost. "This
year ,aU of my vegetables were eaten, despite
the fact that most had wire cages below the
roots," said Elizabeth Miller. Professor of Geo
logical and Earth Sciences and farm user for the
past seven years.
A spray-painted neon orange line delineates
the new golf course's boundaries. The
official University sign for the Com
munity Farm is on the wrong side of
the border. So. too. are the bike path
and gravel road used by farmers to
carry tools and heavy loads of com
post to their crops.
University officials do not believe
that the golf course will affect the suc
cess of the Community Farm, given
that none of the actual farmland has
been taken away.
Farmers' Worries Take Root
Farmers disagree. And many are
offended by their lack of input in the
decision-making process.
No one involved with the farm
knew the golf course would be built
until the bulldozers moved in. Even
then, the farmers had to take a proac
tive approach to find out what was
going on. Some are still unclear,
'i still don't actually know what

the plan is." said Karen Zack.a mem
ber of the IT services staff and com
munity farmer of five years.
She also laments the loss of the
open space.
"My family and friends have had
sume wonderful times at the farm."
Xack said. "We've had Easter-egg
hunts in the field that is now built up
with dirt; we have had fall harvest fes
tivals with pumpkin carving, apple
tasting and educational walks
through the gardens. We've had more
picnics out there than I can count."
The closure of the access road and
the relocation of the Searsville bike
path has inconvenienced farmers and
commuters alike.
"As a bicycle commuter, it adds
nearly a mile to my commute," Steve
Masley said.
Masley has been an employee of
the University for 23 years, an organ
ic farmer for 20 and a Community
Farm member since June. As a Com
munity Farmer, he is also concerned
about the elimination of the farm-ac
cess road.
"When 1 put in my garden, I
brought in five truckloads of com

post, mulch and potting mix; I was
able to drive around the perimeter of
the garden and unload near my plot
this summer." he said. "But if current
plans had been in place then, I would
have had to haul 50 wheelbarrow
loads of these materials 150 yards to
my plot."
Masley recently lost 70 percent of
his tomato crop to ground squirrels,
despite surrounding his plot with net
ting.
"I was angry when they ripped up
open space last year. I was angry
when I found out how the Farm
would be affected and I'm angry now
that they closed down my bike path."
said second-year earth systems grad
uate student Jill Bible.
Bible also notes that she used to
cherish her commute to school, as she
often saw herons and owls in the open
space near the farm — but not any
more.
Though the surrounding area is
renowned for its beauty, the Commu
nity Farm is an odd mixture of treas
ure and trash.
"It's kind of junky at the moment;
we have a lot of work to do," said Em

mett Hopkins, former student and
current University employee. "A
homeless man lives on the other side."
Eleven shopping carts — Trader
Joe's, Mollie Stone's, Walgreens —
litter the Stanford Community Farm's
grounds. Hopkins walks by yards of
black, cracked drip tubing, hundreds
of white plastic seedling flats, a bike
trailer that used to ferry compost, a
weather station and a plump grey cat.
He also passes plots that are obvious
ly well maintained: towering tomato
plants, basil in neat little rows and
bright green leaves of strawberries
clustered along the ground.
And then, of course, there's the
stark boundary, beyond which trucks
grumble, bearing and depositing huge
loads of dirt. Hopkins points at the
neon orange line. It runs inches away
from spindly rose bushes and green
fruited citrus trees, extending around
the farm on two sides.
"They say we can't go over this
line," he said.
Overarching Development Scheme
Land-use decisions involving the
University are made in accordance

with the General Use Permit (GUF),
an agreement between the University
and Santa Clara County. Specifically,
the GUP designates zoning for "de
velopable areas" on Stanford land.
These areas include the open space
surrounding the Stanford Communi
ty Farm.
Why did the University make the
decision to develop this site? Funded
by anonymous donors, the new prac
tice course is for the use of Stanford
varsity golf: eight women and nine
men.
"The golf program has been seek
ing more practice facilities for quite
some time," said Charles Carter, di
rector of land use and environmental
planning. "It was not clear that it was
an institutional priority, but the need
has been there for quite a while."
Dave Schinski. assistant athletic
director, suggested that the new golf
course was a necessity for the team, as
the existing driving range has been
zoned as a housing corridor.
For his part. Carter said that the
University has never intended to turn
the golf course into residential devel
opments. However, both men agreed

that one of the main reasons for the
project is dirt. Dirt generated by the
Munger project — which cannot be
moved off-campus due to permitting
issues — had to be moved some
where. ITie Searsville path area was
identified as a dirt stockpiling site.
The current state of the site is not be
cause of impending golf course con
struction. but is instead due to its
stockpiling function. Once actual con
struction begins, the project will use
the dirt for landscaping.
Schinski and Carter both said that
the community was not involved in
deliberations on the dirt stockpiling
issue or the specifics of the golf
course.
"It's not necessarily a part of indi
vidual projects — to reach out to the
community." Carter said. "[There was
a] decision that there were no signifi
cant stakeholders that needed to be
consulted.
"None of the Stanford Communi
ty Farm has been taken away by this,"
he added. "It's a jump to assume that
it will jeopardize the farm in any way."
Part two of this series will appear in
tomorrow's Daily.
