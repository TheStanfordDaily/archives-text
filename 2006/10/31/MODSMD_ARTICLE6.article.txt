# FACULTY SENATE
## Plagiarism redefined Research misconduct wording now matches government's 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Academic Council approved revised
policies and procedures on Stanford's defini
tion of research misconduct last week, a move
that brings the University up to national stan
dards.

Presenting to the Academic Council on
TUesday, Management Science and Engineer
ing Prof. Elisabeth Pate-Cornell reported on
the actions of the Committee on Research and
the Academic Council during the 2005 school
year. Her report focused on the committee's
work revising the phrasing of the definition of
scientific misconduct. Doing so follows the ex
ample of major federal agencies such as the
Department of Health and Human Services,
which is Stanford's primary source of research
said Arthur Bienenstock, vice
provost and dean of research and
graduate policy.
The change essentially clarifies a
vague phrase from the list of "of
fences" that are characterized as re
search misconduct, Bienenstock said
in an email to the Daily.
In the presentation, "scientific
misconduct" was formerly defined as
fabrication, falsification, plagiarism,
or any other practice that seriously

deviates from those commonly ac
cepted within the scientific commu
nity for proposing, conducting or re
porting research.
The final phrase, in italics, was
considered vague and too loose of a
definition. Therefore, it was amend
ed in the year 2000, Bienenstock
said.
Now, as described in Pate-Cor
nell's presentation, the new defini
tion for nation-wide use defines re
search misconduct as "fabrication,
falsification, or plagiarism in propos
ing, performing, or reviewing re
search. or in reporting research re
sults."
Seeing as the change in wording is

not significant, the resulting effect on
research should not be great.
"It is not anticipated that the re
vised policies will impact research at
Stanford appreciably," Bienenstock
said.
Moreover, as Pate-Cornell
noted in her presentation to the
Senate, research misconduct does
not include such inaccuracies such
as "honest error or differences of
opinion."
Pate-Cornell also advised re
searchers to use one definition for all
research sponsors, "reduce vague
ness and ambiguity" and "conform
University policy to federal lan
guage" wherever possible.
