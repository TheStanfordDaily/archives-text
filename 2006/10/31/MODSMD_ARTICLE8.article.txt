## KFC drops trans fats from menu 
### DAVID B. CARUSO ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK (AP) - After two years
of secret taste tests. KFC said Mon
day it would stop frying chicken in
artery-clogging trans fats, hut New
York City restaurants heing urged to
do the same say it's not so easy.
KFC's announcement, which won
praise from consumer advocates,
came an hour ahead of a public hear
ing on a New York health depart
ment proposal to ban the unhealthy
fats in the nation's restaurant capital.
Industry leaders dished up a plateful
of reasons why such a plan shouldn't
be adopted.
The move would be a "recipe for
disaster that could be devastating to
New York City's restaurant indus
try," said E. Charles Hunt, executive
vice president of the New York State
Restaurant Association.
The shift by KFC and a handful of
other fast food chains _ and the ef
fort by New York health officials _
mark an aggressive crackdown on an
ingredient that is consumed in large
doses around the country.
An average American eats 4.7
pounds of trans fats a year, and the
oil is used as a shortening in baked
goods like cookies, crackers and
doughnuts, as well as in deep frying.
Experts say a ban in New York
would reverberate across the coun
try because the city's food industry is
so large.
The proposal would have taken
an especially harsh toll on KFC, but
the company said that by next April,
all 5,500 of its U.S. restaurants will
have switched from trans fat-rich
partially hydrogenated vegetable oil
to a new soybean oil believed to be
less likely to cause heart disease.
Some KFC sites have already
made the switch in secret trials to see
if customers would notice a differ
ence. They did not, and KFC Presi
dent Gregg Dedrick said he was con
fident the switch won't prompt com
plaints about taste.
"There is no compromise." he
said at a Manhattan news confer
ence. "Nothing is more important to
us than the quality of our food and

preserving the terrific taste of our
product."
Health advocates applauded the
company's switch. The Center for
Science in the Public Interest, which
sued KFC last spring over the trans
fat content of its food, announced
Monday that it was withdrawing
from the lawsuit.
"Colonel Sanders deserves a
bucket lull of praise," said CSPI ex
ecutive director Michael Jacobson.
"If KFC. which deep-fries almost
everything,can get the artificial trans
fat out of its frying oil. anyone can."
Burger King also said Monday that it
hopes to begin testing trans fat-free
cooking in some restaurants within
90 days. Wendy's has already
switched to a zero-trans fat oil. Mc-
Donald's had announced that it in
tended to do so as well in 2(X)3, but
has yet to follow through.
The New York hearing on the
proposed trans fat ban was packed
with doctors and paid industry
spokesmen. Long lines at the build
ing's security checkpoint and an
overflowing hearing room might
have deterred ordinary citizens or
restaurant owners from speaking.
But industry representatives like
I lunt spoke out.
"This ban threatens popular dish
es and affordable menus," he said.
"The city needs to get serious about
working with, not against, our restau
rant owners."
He and others said a ban would
leave cooks unable to find proper re
placement ingredients, and force
some to switch to bad alternatives.
Sheila Cohn Weiss,director of nu
trition policy for the National
Restaurant Association, suggested
that restaurant owners in need of a
quick fix would simply switch to an
other unhealthy substance like palm
oil. which contains unhealthy
amounts of saturated fat.
"'lTiis is a switch that cannot hap
pen immediately," she said.
KFC has concerns about supply,
too.
Dedrick said KFC and the creator
of the new oil, the Monsanto Corp.,
had to work with seed oil processors
to persuade farmers to grow more of

the special soybeans used in the
product. Among other things, farm
ers were offered a price premium to
grow the new soybeans.
Monsanto spokesman Chris
Horner said he expected the farm
land devoted to the company's new
seed to triple next year to 1.5 million
acres, up from 500,000 acres this year
and 100,000 in 2005.
Still, he added, demand for trans

fat-free oils has the potential to out
pace supply.
New York's health commissioner.
Dr. Thomas Frieden. said officials
have heard the supply argument be
fore and rejected it as unsupported.
"We're confident that there is
ample supply of healthy trans fat al
ternatives," Frieden said, although
he added that officials might consid
er giving restaurants more time. The

current proposal is an 18-month
transition.
Louis Nunez, president of New
York's Latino Restaurant Associa
tion, said a quick survey by his group
shows at least 980 of its members
don't know what trans fats are.
"If this goes in with no education,
there is going to be an avalanche of
fines," Nunez said.
Even with the development of

new oils, finding replacements for
every recipe may be tough.
KFC said that even after its
changeover, some menu items will
continue to contain artificial trans
fats, including its popular biscuits.
Although not fried, the biscuits
contain a trans fat shortening that has
proven difficult to replace. Dedrick
said the company would continue
trying to develop a substitute.

contain a trans fat shortening that has

trying to develop a substitute.

NEW YORK (AP) - After two years
of secret taste tests. KFC said Mon
day it would stop frying chicken in
artery-clogging trans fats, hut New
York City restaurants heing urged to
do the same say it's not so easy.
KFC's announcement, which won
praise from consumer advocates,
came an hour ahead of a public hear
ing on a New York health depart
ment proposal to ban the unhealthy
fats in the nation's restaurant capital.
Industry leaders dished up a plateful
of reasons why such a plan shouldn't
be adopted.
The move would be a "recipe for
disaster that could be devastating to
New York City's restaurant indus
try," said E. Charles Hunt, executive
vice president of the New York State
Restaurant Association.
The shift by KFC and a handful of
other fast food chains _ and the ef
fort by New York health officials _
mark an aggressive crackdown on an
ingredient that is consumed in large
doses around the country.
An average American eats 4.7
pounds of trans fats a year, and the
oil is used as a shortening in baked
goods like cookies, crackers and
doughnuts, as well as in deep frying.
Experts say a ban in New York
would reverberate across the coun
try because the city's food industry is
so large.
The proposal would have taken
an especially harsh toll on KFC, but
the company said that by next April,
all 5,500 of its U.S. restaurants will
have switched from trans fat-rich
partially hydrogenated vegetable oil
to a new soybean oil believed to be
less likely to cause heart disease.
Some KFC sites have already
made the switch in secret trials to see
if customers would notice a differ
ence. They did not, and KFC Presi
dent Gregg Dedrick said he was con
fident the switch won't prompt com
plaints about taste.
"There is no compromise." he
said at a Manhattan news confer
ence. "Nothing is more important to
us than the quality of our food and

preserving the terrific taste of our
product."
Health advocates applauded the
company's switch. The Center for
Science in the Public Interest, which
sued KFC last spring over the trans
fat content of its food, announced
Monday that it was withdrawing
from the lawsuit.
"Colonel Sanders deserves a
bucket lull of praise," said CSPI ex
ecutive director Michael Jacobson.
"If KFC. which deep-fries almost
everything,can get the artificial trans
fat out of its frying oil. anyone can."
Burger King also said Monday that it
hopes to begin testing trans fat-free
cooking in some restaurants within
90 days. Wendy's has already
switched to a zero-trans fat oil. Mc-
Donald's had announced that it in
tended to do so as well in 2(X)3, but
has yet to follow through.
