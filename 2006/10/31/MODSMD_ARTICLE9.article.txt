# Global warming will destroy economy, report warns
## 
### THOMAS WAGNER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LONDON (AP) - Raising the stakes in the
global warming dispute with the United States
and China, Britain issued a sweeping report
Monday warning that the Earth faces a calami
ty on the scale of the world wars and the Great
Depression unless urgent action is taken.
The British government also said Vice Pres
ident A 1 Gore has agreed to provide advice on
climate change — a clear indication of Prime
Minister Tony Blair's growing dissatisfaction
with U.S. environmental policy. Gore has
emerged as a powerful environmental
spokesman since losing the 2000 presidential
election.
The 700-page report argues that environ
mentalism and economic growth can go hand
in hand in the battle against global warming.
But it also says that if no action is taken, rising
sea levels, heavier floods and more intense
droughts could displace 200 million people by
the middle of the century.
The report said unabated climate change
would eventually cost the equivalent of be
tween 5 percent and 20 percent of global gross
domestic product each year. The report by Sir
Nicholas Stern, a senior government econo
mist, represents a huge contrast to the U.S. gov
ernment's wait-and-see policies.
Blair called for "bold and decisive action"
to cut carbon emissions and stem the worst of
the temperature rise.
Stern said acting now to cut greenhouse gas
emissions would cost about 1 percent of global
GDP each year. "The benefits of strong, early
action considerably outweigh the costs," he
said. "We can grow and be green."
Blair, Stern and Treasury chief Gordon
Brown, who commissioned the report, empha
sized that the battle against global warming
can only succeed with the cooperation of
major countries such as the United States and
China.
President Bush kept the United States —
by far the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide
and other gases blamed for global warming —
out of the Kyoto international treaty to reduce
greenhouse gases, saying the pact would harm
the U.S. economy.
Blair, Bush's top ally in the Iraq war. has indi
cated U.S. policies on climate change are unac
ceptable.
Kristen A. Hellmer, deputy director for
communications at the White House Council
on Environmental Quality,said Bush "has long
recognized that climate change is a serious
issue, and he has committed the U.S. to advanc
ing and investing in the new technologies to
help address this problem."
The United States, she said, "is well on track to

meet the president's goal to reduce green
house gas intensity of our economy 18 percent
by 2012."
Gore's office said that in his unpaid role as
an adviser, he would offer Britain's Treasury
his thoughts on developments in climate
change science, new technologies for cutting
emissions and ways of making the needed
changes happen quickly.
Vicki Arroyo, director of policy analysis at
the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in
Arlington, Va., praised the report for trying to
measure the cost of action and inaction against
global warming.The report focused on the eco
nomic impact of climate change, and did not
deal with any new scientific analysis,
"Economic assessments are inexact sci
ences. but they are used all the time in setting
insurance rates and government regulation of
highway safety, pollution control and food
safety. They are projections of what the risks
are and the benefits of averting those risks."
Blair signed an agreement this year with
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to de
velop technologies to combat the problem.The
measure imposed the first emissions cap in the
United States on utilities, refineries and manu
facturing plants in a bid to curb the gases that
scientists blame for warming the Earth.
The Stern report praised states such as Cal
ifornia for developing their own objectives and
policy frameworks regarding the battle against
global warming.
At a news conference, Stern said U.S. coop
eration is vital, and Foreign Secretary Mar
garet Beckett said she would advise the Bush
administration that climate change is an "ur
gent issue that has to be tackled."
But Blair and the report also said that no
matter what Britain, the United States and
Japan do. the battle cannot succeed without de
ciding when and how to control greenhouse
gas emissions by such fast-industrializing gi
ants as China and India.
"Britain is more than playing its part. But it
is 2 percent of worldwide emissions. Close
down all, all of Britain's emissions and in less
than two years just the growth in China's emis
sions would wipe out the difference," Blair
said.
The Stern report said at current trends, av
erage global temperatures will rise by 3.6 de
grees to 5.4 degrees within the next 50 years or
so, and the Earth will experience several de
grees more of warming if emissions continue to
grow.
It said such warming can have severe im
pact, including melting glaciers, rising sea lev
els, declining crop yields, drinking water short
ages. higher death tolls from malnutrition and
heat stress, and widespread outbreaks of
malaria and dengue fever. Developing coun

tries often would be the hardest hit.
Many major cities could be at risk of flood
ing from coastal surges, including New York.
Miami, London, Tokyo, Shanghai and Buenos
Aires, the study said.
Stern's report said "ignoring climate change
will eventually damage economic growth.''
"Our actions over the coming decades
could create risks of major disruption to eco
nomic and social activity, later in this century
and in the next, on a scale similar to those asso
ciated with the great wars and the economic
depression of the first half of the 20th century."
it said.
"Using the results from formal economic
models, the review estimates that if we don't
act, the overall costs and risks of climate
change will be equivalent to losing at least 5
percent of global GDP each year, now and for
ever. If a wider range of risks and impacts is
taken into account, the estimates of damage
could rise to 20 percent of GDP or more," it
said.
I"he report acknowledged its predictions re
garding GDP used calculations that had to rely
on sparse or nonexistent observational data
about high temperatures and developing coun
tries, and to place monetary values on human
health and the environment, "which is concep
tually, ethically and empirically very difficult."
Stern said the world must shift to a "low-car
bon global economy" through measures in
cluding taxation, regulation of greenhouse gas
emissions and carbon trading.
In a world where fossil fuels provide about
HO percent of the energy supply, he recom
mended a halt to deforestation, technology
aimed at clean power, heat and transportation
and developing ways to capture and store
greenhouse gas emissions.
The British government is considering new
taxes on cheap airline flights, fuel and high
emission vehicles. It also announced legislation
that would set a goal of cutting carbon dioxide
emissions by 60 percent from 1990 levels by
2050.
Under the Kyoto accord, 35 industrialized
nations committed to reducing emissions by an
average 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.
Britain is one of only a few industrialized
nations whose greenhouse gas emissions have
fallen in the last 15 years, the United Nations
said. It said Germany's emissions dropped 17
percent between 1990 and 2004, Britain's by 14
percent and France's by almost 1 percent.
Overall, there was a 2.4 percent rise in emis
sions by 41 industrialized nations from 2000 to
2004, mostly because former Soviet-bloc coun
tries increased emissions by 4.1 percent.
Stern is scheduled to discuss his report next
week at the U.N. Climate Change Conference
in Kenya.
