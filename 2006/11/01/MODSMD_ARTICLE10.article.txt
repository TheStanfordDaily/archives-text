## Editorial Board No on Prop. 83 
### 
Proposition S3 is a measure that could
only pass as a referendum. Lawmak
ers have repeatedly refused to consid
er it because of its massive infeasibility and
questionable logic. Hie proposal, known as
"Jessica's Law." would make sweeping
changes to California's penal code with the
intention of cracking down on repeat of
fenses by sex offenders and attempting to
keep them away from children. Its provi
sions include preventing registered sex of
fenders from living within 2000 feet

of a sehool or park and requir-

ing many of them to wear a
Global Positioning Sys
tem tracking device for
life. Prop. S3 follows a sim
ilar law just passed in
Florida after a previously
convicted sex criminal
kidnapped abused and
killed a 9 year old girl. Jes

It is always difficult to
trgue against better protec

tion of children. Because of

this.politicians across the state, in
cluding both Schwarzenegger and An
gelides, have said they are in favor of the
proposition. Nobody wants to be labeled as
on the side of sex offenders. However, it is
significant that the same law was proposed
multiple times in the state legislature and
never even made it out of committee hear
ings, let alone to a lull vote on the floor.The
"Yes on 83" campaign claims this is due to
ultra-liberals with extreme views, but it is
more likely that veteran lawmakers (even
in California) know a mess when they see it.
The hallmark of the proposition — the
requirement that registered sex offenders
not reside within 2000 feet of schools and
parks — is particularly problematic. The
idea is that children will be safer if sex of
fenders are kept away from places where
kids usually gather. But this rationale,
which has been largely influential in gather
ing signatures and political support for the
referendum, fails in real-life application.
According to the Department of Justice,
only seven percent of sex offenses against
juveniles were committed by strangers. It is

doubtful what effect if any the 2000-foot
limit would have. Other states like Col
orado and Minnesota have rejected such
zoning restrictions after conducting studies
which found no correlation between repeat
commission of a sex crime and proximity to
schools or parks.
In 2001, lowa passed a residence restric
tion similar to that in Prop. S3, but the pros
ecutors who once advocated it have recent
ly reversed their position,citing the expense

and overall ineffectiveness of the

regulations. It has caused unin
tended consequences, such as

pushing sex offenders to

rural areas which are less
equipped to monitor and
police them, as well as lead
ing some sex offenders to
not register and instead go
"underground."
'The Stanford Center on
Criminal Justice conducted
a report when the law was

proposed in the legislature
earlier this year, estimating that

large sections of cities like Los An
geles. San Diego and San Francisco would
he off limits to sex offenders with a 2000
foot ban. It is little wonder, then, why so
many cities have signed off on the referen
dum: they can ship their sex offenders off
for someone else to worry about, and state
funding will then have to pick up the tab.
If Prop. S3 passes, expect legal battles to
ensue over such issues as what to do with
sex offenders convicted before the proposi
tion. If they are evicted and forced to move,
the law could be challenged as ex post facto
or retroactive. Additionally, there is a strong
argument that measures essentially ban
ning sex offenders from cities may consti
tute cruel and unusual punishment.
Hie C iPS tracking component of the
proposition could cost in excess of $200 mil
lion per year, according to the state Legisla
tive Analyst's Office. California law already
permits the use of GPS tracking at state dis
cretion. but it is used primarily for high risk
offenders.
