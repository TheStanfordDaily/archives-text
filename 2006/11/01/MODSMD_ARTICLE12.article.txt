# The 						athlete outfit
## 
### 
I can recognize an athlete anywhere. The big
guy that sits in the corner of my Art I listo
ry section? Athlete. That blonde girl in the
third row of my English class? Athlete. And
it's not because they are necessarily freakishly
tall or abnormally broad-shouldered — I can
pick out the fencers and the javelin throwers
too. It is because of the athlete outfit.
ITie athlete outfit can take on multiple
forms, but these variations never deviate far
from its fundamental elements. Hie outfit
begins with a cardinal red T-shirt or sweat
shirt. which always says 'Stanford' in large
white letters and usually displays their own
sport's name, emblazoned across the bot
tom. (Let's be honest, no one is a big enough
Stanford Synchronized Swimming fan to
buy and wear that shirt. If you're wearing
one, you're on the team.) In lieu of the T
shirt or sweatshirt, occasionally there is also
the red fleece pullover, or the reversible, red
and black, waterproof, zip-up rain jacket.
Since neither of these is sold at the Hook
store. or at least not to us laity until the fol
lowing year, their distinction as gifts from
the Athletic Department makes the wearers
stand out from the tlabbv masses.The outfit

continues with either heavy, red, ankle-zip
pered sweatpants (also not sold at the Book
store) or perhaps even a pair of nondescript
jeans, if that athlete was looking to dress the
outfit up for the day.The ensemble is usually
completed by a pair of grey athletic shoes
with cardinal-red accents.
Now, I am not disparaging athletes or ac
cusing them of being elitist. If I got free.nice
stuff from the athletic department, I'd be
wearing it too. As a general practice, howev
er. to give one type of Stanford student clear
and obvious markers of their group stand
ing seems a bit strange. Join me, if you will,
in a brief thought experiment.

What would it be like if any other
subset of Stanford students wore dis
tinctive, expensive clothing which no
one else could buy and which was
gifted to them by their department?
Imagine with me an alternate Stan
ford where everyone with a 4.0 GPA
or higher strolled around in free
cashmere sweaters, embroidered
with a special 4.0-Club insignia.
Their freely-provided smart cardi
nal-red blazers, penny loafers and of
ficial khaki pants, all emblazoned
with the "4.0-Club" seal, would lay
bare to the world who was the
creme-de-la-creme in the world of
academia. The Music Department
would give every concert-level musi
cian a free tuxedo or sequined gown
(depending on gender), to be worn

at recitals. A white dress or tuxedo
for home recitals and cardinal-red
evening attire for performances at
other schools would be the norm.
The dance troupes would receive red
leg warmers. Pointe shoes, leotards
and warm-ups from the dance de
partment, not to mention free elabo
rate dance costumes and props.
What about the most promising
pre-meds? The best artists? Or a
capella groups? What if the most
beautiful people wore distinguishing
clothing?
There are lots of ways to achieve
excellence, and God knows there
are talented people swarming this
campus, but the recognition of this
cornucopia of achievement is un
equally afforded far too often. Al
though it boggles my mind to think
of how someone can use a bendy
stick to hurl themselves high in the
air. it is equally befuddling to know
how Joe "wearing what I can buy
from the Bookstore" Shmoe has

gotten an A+ in Organic Chemistry
or mastered the violin or starred in
Gaieties.
Admittedly, however, sports are
fun to watch, and while I've paid a lot
to see a basketball game, I've never
heard the Stanford Wind Ensemble
perform. Spectators mean money,
money means funds and funds mean
free, nice stuff from the Athletic De
partment. Taking into account my
lack of hand-eye coordination and
Olympian fitness level. I will just
have to wait until Stanford fully ap
preciates the importance of non-ath
letic excellence and rewards it with
free gear.
Meanwhile, I'll be nursing my Ath
lete Outfit envy out of my Depart
ment of English Nalgene.

If you, too, haven't received anything
good and free from Stanford since
your Admit Weekend shirt, e-mail
Katie at kttaylor@stanford.edu to
commiserate.
