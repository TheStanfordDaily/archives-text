# The
						athlete outfit
## 
### 
I can recognize an athlete anywhere. The big
guy that sits in the corner of my Art I listo
ry section? Athlete. That blonde girl in the
third row of my English class? Athlete. And
it's not because they are necessarily freakishly
tall or abnormally broad-shouldered â€” I can
pick out the fencers and the javelin throwers
too. It is because of the athlete outfit.
ITie athlete outfit can take on multiple
forms, but these variations never deviate far
from its fundamental elements. Hie outfit
begins with a cardinal red T-shirt or sweat
shirt. which always says 'Stanford' in large
white letters and usually displays their own
sport's name, emblazoned across the bot
tom. (Let's be honest, no one is a big enough
Stanford Synchronized Swimming fan to
buy and wear that shirt. If you're wearing
one, you're on the team.) In lieu of the T
shirt or sweatshirt, occasionally there is also
the red fleece pullover, or the reversible, red
and black, waterproof, zip-up rain jacket.
Since neither of these is sold at the Hook
store. or at least not to us laity until the fol
lowing year, their distinction as gifts from
the Athletic Department makes the wearers
stand out from the tlabbv masses.The outfit

continues with either heavy, red, ankle-zip
pered sweatpants (also not sold at the Book
store) or perhaps even a pair of nondescript
jeans, if that athlete was looking to dress the
outfit up for the day.The ensemble is usually
completed by a pair of grey athletic shoes
with cardinal-red accents.
Now, I am not disparaging athletes or ac
cusing them of being elitist. If I got free.nice
stuff from the athletic department, I'd be
wearing it too. As a general practice, howev
er. to give one type of Stanford student clear
and obvious markers of their group stand
ing seems a bit strange. Join me, if you will,
in a brief thought experiment.
