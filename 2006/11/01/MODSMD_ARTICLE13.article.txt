# Will be esoteric for food

### 
Litcrawl is Si 's annual literary night of
readings, where instead of crawling to
bars and getting progressively drunk
er, you crawl to coffee shops and get pro
gressively pretentious-er. By night's end,
you are convinced that the only person
worth knowing is this one guy you saw read
ing about how his potato salad is a micro
cosm of capitalist disenfranchisement.
Usually, I go to "up and coming" literary
readings because I support my fellow writ
ers. Some of the writers I've encountered in
college have been absolutely amazing. Hut
outside campus, my luck hasn't been as
good, rhere, the only thing up and coming
about literary readings is usually my lunch!
I.ike I've said before, I'm from Jersey,so I
don't shock easily. At Litcrawl. the readings
that contained graphic depictions of sex or
violence didn't bother me. I didn't think it
was a clever twist to depict an orgy with Jesus,
nor did I start crying of poor taste when one
reader's time was primarily a laundry list of
the dirty sexual positions you learned as a
school boy on the playground.There's a rea
son question ;ind answer sessions are not of
fered at readings. The most common ques
tion I have is: "How screwed up is you?"
I could fit right in if I grabbed the mike
and explained how I knew a talent agent

who saw this family act come into his office...
and. well, you know the rest. This reminds
me to plug my own forthcoming, ground
breaking book entitled "Holt's Harangue:
Dirty Words and Your Most Sacred Reli
gious Figure."
This one writer stuck out in my mind be
cause he represented caricature of all that is
wrong with the writing world. No. not J.M. Co
etzee. TTiis reader had the disillusioned faux
swagger that only the finest in creative writing
programs could produce. Last year, he was
hangingout in grad school with a sign that said
"will be esoteric for food," and today he's got
a book deal â€” and if you know how much lit
erary authors get paid nowadays, that means
he's not exactly holdinn out for the food.
