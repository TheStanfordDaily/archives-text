# Will be esoteric for food
## 
### 
Litcrawl is Si 's annual literary night of
readings, where instead of crawling to
bars and getting progressively drunk
er, you crawl to coffee shops and get pro
gressively pretentious-er. By night's end,
you are convinced that the only person
worth knowing is this one guy you saw read
ing about how his potato salad is a micro
cosm of capitalist disenfranchisement.
Usually, I go to "up and coming" literary
readings because I support my fellow writ
ers. Some of the writers I've encountered in
college have been absolutely amazing. Hut
outside campus, my luck hasn't been as
good, rhere, the only thing up and coming
about literary readings is usually my lunch!
I.ike I've said before, I'm from Jersey,so I
don't shock easily. At Litcrawl. the readings
that contained graphic depictions of sex or
violence didn't bother me. I didn't think it
was a clever twist to depict an orgy with Jesus,
nor did I start crying of poor taste when one
reader's time was primarily a laundry list of
the dirty sexual positions you learned as a
school boy on the playground.There's a rea
son question ;ind answer sessions are not of
fered at readings. The most common ques
tion I have is: "How screwed up is you?"
I could fit right in if I grabbed the mike
and explained how I knew a talent agent

who saw this family act come into his office...
and. well, you know the rest. This reminds
me to plug my own forthcoming, ground
breaking book entitled "Holt's Harangue:
Dirty Words and Your Most Sacred Reli
gious Figure."
This one writer stuck out in my mind be
cause he represented caricature of all that is
wrong with the writing world. No. not J.M. Co
etzee. TTiis reader had the disillusioned faux
swagger that only the finest in creative writing
programs could produce. Last year, he was
hangingout in grad school with a sign that said
"will be esoteric for food," and today he's got
a book deal — and if you know how much lit
erary authors get paid nowadays, that means
he's not exactly holdinn out for the food.


Chris Holt
Holt's Harangue
His images were full of nonsensical
phrases like "Embryonic robot."
"Stealth Porkchop." I think I heard a
"bicycle squid" in there someplace.
T.S. Eliot, eat your heart out.
After many years of writing and
ennui, or ennui writing, this "bud
ding" writer will return to school to
teach. There, his inner psyche will
still come out: "That was a great
analysis of 'The Great Gatsbv,'
Timmy.and to celebrate. I'm going to
throw motor oil and old shoes at
you."
People play characters to differ
entiate themselves, which of course
is what everyone is doing these days.
Wearing the beret and the black
turtleneck? Cliche. Now the pro
found author wears the mustard
stained wife-beater. And nothing
else. I'm glad we as a literary com
munity have emerged from years of
therapy and are now ok with our
selves. Our next challenge, it seems.

is the laundry.
I know I'm not alone in my feel
ings for these authors because I've
heard more clapping at Al Gore's
one-man comedy spectacular.
There was no uproarious "YES!
Man. 1 totally dug his reference to a
pig's testicles to describe loneliness.
Wow!" There was no stunned si
lence. There was the sound of
checking the time and looking
sheepishly at your date.
Some of these writers kept mak
ing references to the merchandise
table, kind of like a struggling punk
band would do if they were out of
songs. Somebody actually said."Well
if you enjoyed my depiction of doing
a Lord Jesus in the poop-shoot, I call
your attention to the merch table."
And 1 call your attention to going
back to that shrink of yours.
The references to the merchandise
and the constant reminder of who is
sponsoring the writers make these
readings seem, well, commercial.
Here at Esoteric Magazine we are
proud to support these writers,
whose books are right next to the
coffee bar. Tonight we have a special
offer of three books for the price of a

cappuccino.
I keep envisioning what would
happen if 1 ever pulled this shit in the
CoHo. "ITiank you. I call that piece
'Emotional Cutlery.' If you'd like to
read more dribble cleverly disguised
as profundity, buy my latest book ti
tled Holt's Harangue and the Acid
Rain Birthday Cake,' available for
purchase over there by my room
mate. We accept check or cash."
But despite all of my criticisms, I
want a Litcrawl at Stanford. I want to
have a night where people journey
from readings in the co-ops to the
CoHo, the English department to
Mem Aud, the frat houses to the bird
cage. I want us to have a myriad of
readings — we can get Black Ink out
there and the Chappie and find out
why the folks at Spoken Word are so
angry. Make a night of it. Now. may I
direct your attention to the merch
table where you can pick up a copy
of my latest book. "Holt's Guide to
Selling Out Your Own Column."
