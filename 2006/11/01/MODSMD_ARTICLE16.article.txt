# Gas, brake, dips
## 
### 
Easy, portable, and delicious, chips and
dips are the ultimate party foods. While
canned salsas taste pretty good when
you're drunk, and fine as long as you can keep
your mind from wandering down that whole
I'm-really-just-eating-soggy-vegetables path,
making fresh dips is so easy that there's no rea
son not to do it every once in awhile.
I decided against giving a recipe for the fa
miliar red tomato salsa, because it really
leans on perfectly ripe, flavorful tomatoes,
which aren't always available. Instead I've in
cluded a recipe for guacamole, maybe one of
the few dips more beloved than salsa and
ridiculously easy to make.
It seems like everyone has their own fa
vorite way of making guacamole. My mom al
ways just adds a little garlic and lemon juice to
the avocado, but I 've seen people who love to
mix in lots of chopped fresh cilantro or add
prepared salsa from a jar. As long as you fol
low your taste buds, it's hard to go wrong here.
One common addition 1 would advise against
is sour cream. Since the avocado is naturally
so creamy, it doesn't make much sense to add
a lot of fat to the dish. Anyway. I think a rus
tic, deep green guacamole of roughly mashed
avocados with a few flavorings is a lot more

appealing than the slimy, snot-green liquid
you'll get from adding a lot of sour cream.
Many stores now carry both the green
black, pebbly-skinned Hass, and the lighter
green, smooth-skinned Fuerte variety. The
1 lass's creamy texture makes it superior for
guacamole, but you can make something re
ally good with whatever type of avocado you
have on hand. Just make sure it's ripe. You
should be able to press your thumb into the
side and make a dent. Buying hard avoca
does is fine too — just leave them on the
counter for a few days to ripen.
(■uacamole
2 ripe avocados
1 clove garlic, minced

Lemon juice, to taste
Salt
Cut the avocado in half by running a knife
lengthwise around the pit, and twisting the
halves apart. Then, either lodge a chefs knife
into the pit with a firm whack and twist to re
move, or simply scoop it out with a spoon. Next,
use a spoon to scoop the avocado flesh into a
howl. Mash it roughly with a fork. Don?t he
afraid to leave it chunky. Stir in the garlic and
the lemon juice, a little at a time, until you get a
good acidity. It shouldn't take very much. You
can season it with a little salt, though if your
chips are salty you may not need it.
This is best made right before you want to
consume it. but will keep for a couple hours with
out turning brown if its refrigerated and cov
ered with plastic wrap. Supposedly, leaving the
pit in with the guacamole prolongs the process,
but I wouldn't put U)o much faith in that.
Variations: Diced tomatoes or onions,
chopped cilantro, chili powder or minced fresh
chilies are all common additions. Use what you
have and what you think tastes good.
