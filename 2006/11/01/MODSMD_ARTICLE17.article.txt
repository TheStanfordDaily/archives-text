## Supporting Prop. 85 just makes sense 
### NOELLE PATNO 
Any girl in California under the age of 18 can
legally obtain a taxpayer-funded abortion —
or be coerced into one — without the
knowledge of those responsible for her.
Such a legal environment fosters the will
ful ignorance of possible abuse and grants
sexual predators and profiteering strangers
the power to preempt parental rights, to
pocket the funds of those who do not support
abortions, and to endanger minors. Minors
are called "minors" because society does not
yet consider them mature enough to make
important decisions regarding health and
safety. There is no reason that abortion
should be an exception. Fortunately, Propo
sition 85 proposes to address this contradic
tion.
Under Proposition 85. a minor seeking an
abortion will be provided with two options: pa
perwork to notify her legal guardians within 48
hours; or a free, confidential petition to the ju
venile court for a waiver. If any other person
has attempted to coerce her into an abortion,
the measure requires that it be reported to a
child protection agency. Finally, the doctor will
be required to obtain the minor's consent be
fore performing the abortion.

Proposition 85, then, is nothing more than
common sense. It prohibits the cover-up of
abuse,circumvents coercion, and allows par
ents the opportunity to know that their child
is seeking an abortion. It thereby ensures the
young patient will be granted assistance in
making an informed decision, access to fami
ly medical history, and aid in post-treatment
follow-up. The same sound reasoning lies be
hind the fact that every other medical proce
dure for a minor — from an ear piercing to a
simple aspirin provided by the school nurse
— requires parental consent. An invasive
surgery should at least entail notification.
In Bellotti v. Baird.the Supreme Court rec
ognized that parents evaluate and select bet
ter health care providers than minors,and that
parental involvement will protect them from
unsanitary and unsafe abortion clinics, like
those exposed in The Seattle Times and The
Los Angeles Times. Parental involvement
also curbs abusive relationships in which older
men exploit young girls and use secret abor
tions to cover up their crimes. Such situations
are disturbingly widespread: a study of 46.000
pregnancies of school-age girls in California
revealed that 71 percent were caused by men
with a mean age of 22.6 years. Parents need to
know that this is happening.

Meanwhile, parental notification laws
have been shown not only to lower teen
abortion rates but actually to promote sexu
al responsibility on the part of minors. A
study by the Western Economic Association
International in 1994 states that, on average,
parental involvement laws reduce the rate of
adolescent pregnancies by 8 percent. For ex
ample, the Center for Disease Control re
ports that the rate of teen pregnancies (ages
15-19) in Pennsylvania dropped a staggering
15.3 percent from 1992 to 1995, following a
parental consent law enacted in 1992. A more
recent study by Michael New confirms this
trend in other states.
Young girls are understandably reluctant to
inform their parents of the upsetting news of a
pregnancy. However, the vast majority of par
ents will provide their daughter with the sup
port that only a parent, not a stranger who
profits from abortions, can give. Unplanned
pregnancy and abortion are serious issues;
thus, there is a significant temptation for young
teens, even from the best of families, to avoid
upsetting their parents by secretly obtaining an
abortion. But this natural reluctance indicates
the need for the law, not a problem with it.
