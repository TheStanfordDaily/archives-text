## THE
						CARDINAL MILE Cross-country head coach Tegen uses experience, knowledge to lead squad 
### SCOTT BLAND 
Despite being one of the most suc
cessful coaches at a university known
for its athletic achievements, cross
country head coach Peter Tegen can
walk around without garnering much
attention.
Perhaps it is to he expected for the
coach of a non-"glamour program." But
though Stanford's men's and women's
cross-country teams do not generate the
same hype and excitement as their col
leagues on the basketball court or on
the football field. Tegen's program re
mains one of the most successful at
Stanford.
A native of Germany,Tegen plied his
trade throughout the world before ar
riving in the United States, coaching in
his home country as well as in Africa
and South America. In 1971.he took the
reins of Peru's national track program
and led it to the Munich Olympics the
next year. One year later, Tegen began
his NCAA coaching career at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, taking charge of its
women's cross-country and track teams.
Over the course of three decades at Wis
consin. the Badgers finished in the na
tional top 10 an impressive 24 times, a
record which included two NCAA
Championships.
Then in June 2004, everything came
to a sudden end for the architect of Wis
consin's incredible success. Tegen re
signed. alleging that he was pressured
by Wisconsin administrators, and at 64
began transitioning into retirement.
A year later, Stanford came calling.
A new job was the last thing on Tegen's
mind —he was attending the World
Championship meet in Finland at the
time — but when he heard about Stan
lord's interest, his own interest was
piqued.
"Somehow 1 found out that [track
and field director Edrick Floreal) was
looking for me, and from thereon in
things moved very, very quickly,"Tegen
said.
He arrived at Stanford fairly late —
the fall quarter had already started by
the time Tegen reached the Farm. But
the Cardinal could not be happier about
the way things turned out. From then
on. his tenure has seen a whirlwind of
high achievements, including a women's
NCAA Championship in 2005.

we're all out there to accomplish."
