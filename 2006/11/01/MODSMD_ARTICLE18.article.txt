## THE 						CARDINAL MILE Cross-country head coach Tegen uses experience, knowledge to lead squad 
### SCOTT BLAND 
Despite being one of the most suc
cessful coaches at a university known
for its athletic achievements, cross
country head coach Peter Tegen can
walk around without garnering much
attention.
Perhaps it is to he expected for the
coach of a non-"glamour program." But
though Stanford's men's and women's
cross-country teams do not generate the
same hype and excitement as their col
leagues on the basketball court or on
the football field. Tegen's program re
mains one of the most successful at
Stanford.
A native of Germany,Tegen plied his
trade throughout the world before ar
riving in the United States, coaching in
his home country as well as in Africa
and South America. In 1971.he took the
reins of Peru's national track program
and led it to the Munich Olympics the
next year. One year later, Tegen began
his NCAA coaching career at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, taking charge of its
women's cross-country and track teams.
Over the course of three decades at Wis
consin. the Badgers finished in the na
tional top 10 an impressive 24 times, a
record which included two NCAA
Championships.
Then in June 2004, everything came
to a sudden end for the architect of Wis
consin's incredible success. Tegen re
signed. alleging that he was pressured
by Wisconsin administrators, and at 64
began transitioning into retirement.
A year later, Stanford came calling.
A new job was the last thing on Tegen's
mind —he was attending the World
Championship meet in Finland at the
time — but when he heard about Stan
lord's interest, his own interest was
piqued.
"Somehow 1 found out that [track
and field director Edrick Floreal) was
looking for me, and from thereon in
things moved very, very quickly,"Tegen
said.
He arrived at Stanford fairly late —
the fall quarter had already started by
the time Tegen reached the Farm. But
the Cardinal could not be happier about
the way things turned out. From then
on. his tenure has seen a whirlwind of
high achievements, including a women's
NCAA Championship in 2005.

we're all out there to accomplish."
ARIANNA LAMBIE, All-American Cross-Country Runner
Tegen stresses the importance of
"dynamic running" in his work with
the cross-country team. He has seen
the negative effects that training
over one distance or at one speed —
"pace-lock," in his words — can
have on runners, and he tries to in
corporate a variety of workouts to
push the runners to the height of
their abilities.
Both the length and the wide
scope of Tegen's experience have
helped to bring his coaching philoso
phy to where it stands today. His
early career as a sprint coach, and his
familiarity with other events, gave
him a broad perspective on which he
bases his strategy.
"There's a wide range of athleti
cism in the events that I've coached."
lie said. "You try to take the good
bits and pieces from one and try to
utilize them, if it is practical, in an
other event. Overall, I think the
more you've done in different
events, the more you have a pretty
good overview on how things might
eventually fit together, and the puz
zle can be almost solved."
Tegen's runners are well aware of
how much there is to learn from his
40-plus years of coaching experi
ence. Iliey have high faith in his
time-tested methods.
"He's extremely knowledgeable
from all his experience with coach
ing and research on running physiol

ogy," junior Ail-American Arianna
Lambie said. "And he's passionate
about applying that knowledge to
improving his athletes. [Tegen] be
lieves that his techniques will make
us better.That confidence of his, and
our trust in it. has made us successful
so far."
That passion is the other critical
element of Tegen's success. As much
as Tegen's technical coaching ability
is appreciated by the Cardinal, the
personality and character he mixes
in with his instructions are also high
ly valued by Stanford's runners.
Lambie likes the combination of
qualities that the coach brings to the
table.
"1 le always gives us something to
think about," Lambie said.
"Whether it's his never-ending puns,
his deliberate race strategies or his
challenging workouts, he keeps us
on our toes, and 1 think all those
things move us forward.
"He's fun, but he is serious about
the business we're all out there to ac
complish," Lambie added.
It is precisely that attitude that is
maintaining and improving the Car
dinal's powerhouse cross-country
program. He may have been on the
verge of permanent retirement, but
no one — not least himself — re
grets his decision to come back to
coaching NCAA cross-country.
"I had no intentions to start over
again,"Tegen said.
Fortunately for Stanford, the
Athletic Department had other
ideas, and now, the Cardinal is seeing
some of the abundant success that
has marked Tegen's career.

has marked Tegen's career.
Despite being one of the most suc
cessful coaches at a university known
for its athletic achievements, cross
country head coach Peter Tegen can
walk around without garnering much
attention.
Perhaps it is to he expected for the
coach of a non-"glamour program." But
though Stanford's men's and women's
cross-country teams do not generate the
same hype and excitement as their col
leagues on the basketball court or on
the football field. Tegen's program re
mains one of the most successful at
Stanford.
A native of Germany,Tegen plied his
trade throughout the world before ar
riving in the United States, coaching in
his home country as well as in Africa
and South America. In 1971.he took the
reins of Peru's national track program
and led it to the Munich Olympics the
next year. One year later, Tegen began
his NCAA coaching career at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, taking charge of its
women's cross-country and track teams.
Over the course of three decades at Wis
consin. the Badgers finished in the na
tional top 10 an impressive 24 times, a
record which included two NCAA
Championships.
Then in June 2004, everything came
to a sudden end for the architect of Wis
consin's incredible success. Tegen re
signed. alleging that he was pressured
by Wisconsin administrators, and at 64
began transitioning into retirement.
A year later, Stanford came calling.
A new job was the last thing on Tegen's
mind —he was attending the World
Championship meet in Finland at the
time — but when he heard about Stan
lord's interest, his own interest was
piqued.
"Somehow 1 found out that [track
and field director Edrick Floreal) was
looking for me, and from thereon in
things moved very, very quickly,"Tegen
said.
He arrived at Stanford fairly late —
the fall quarter had already started by
the time Tegen reached the Farm. But
the Cardinal could not be happier about
the way things turned out. From then
on. his tenure has seen a whirlwind of
high achievements, including a women's
NCAA Championship in 2005.

"He's fun, but he is serious about the business
we're all out there to accomplish."
ARIANNA LAMBIE, All-American Cross-Country Runner
Tegen stresses the importance of
"dynamic running" in his work with
the cross-country team. He has seen
the negative effects that training
over one distance or at one speed —
"pace-lock," in his words — can
have on runners, and he tries to in
corporate a variety of workouts to
push the runners to the height of
their abilities.
Both the length and the wide
scope of Tegen's experience have
helped to bring his coaching philoso
phy to where it stands today. His
early career as a sprint coach, and his
familiarity with other events, gave
him a broad perspective on which he
bases his strategy.
"There's a wide range of athleti
cism in the events that I've coached."
lie said. "You try to take the good
bits and pieces from one and try to
utilize them, if it is practical, in an
other event. Overall, I think the
more you've done in different
events, the more you have a pretty
good overview on how things might
eventually fit together, and the puz
zle can be almost solved."
Tegen's runners are well aware of
how much there is to learn from his
40-plus years of coaching experi
ence. Iliey have high faith in his
time-tested methods.
"He's extremely knowledgeable
from all his experience with coach
ing and research on running physiol

ogy," junior Ail-American Arianna
Lambie said. "And he's passionate
about applying that knowledge to
improving his athletes. [Tegen] be
lieves that his techniques will make
us better.That confidence of his, and
our trust in it. has made us successful
so far."
That passion is the other critical
element of Tegen's success. As much
as Tegen's technical coaching ability
is appreciated by the Cardinal, the
personality and character he mixes
in with his instructions are also high
ly valued by Stanford's runners.
Lambie likes the combination of
qualities that the coach brings to the
table.
"1 le always gives us something to
think about," Lambie said.
"Whether it's his never-ending puns,
his deliberate race strategies or his
challenging workouts, he keeps us
on our toes, and 1 think all those
things move us forward.
"He's fun, but he is serious about
the business we're all out there to ac
complish," Lambie added.
It is precisely that attitude that is
maintaining and improving the Car
dinal's powerhouse cross-country
program. He may have been on the
verge of permanent retirement, but
no one — not least himself — re
grets his decision to come back to
coaching NCAA cross-country.
"I had no intentions to start over
again,"Tegen said.
Fortunately for Stanford, the
Athletic Department had other
ideas, and now, the Cardinal is seeing
some of the abundant success that
has marked Tegen's career.
