# Hooked on the Internet
## Study shows that frequent email checking may be sign of obsessive behavior 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
Ever feel that need to continuously click
the refresh button on your Internet browser to
see if you've got mail? Ever show up late to
class because you were writing an email and
got distracted? Ever wake up at 4 a.m. and au
tomatically check Facebook?
If you answered yes to any of these ques
tions, you may be an Internet addict.
A new study from Stanford Medical School
found that excessive Internet usage can be
compared to alcoholism — and what may be
labeled as merely bad habits could be signs of
a compulsive disorder.
"Just think about the pandemic of email
once you get to college," said junior Jordan
Montcharmont.a Resident Computer Coordi
nator in Cedro."lt's expected of all students to
check their email all the time.Those who don't
miss out on things like announcements over
the dorm list saying Tm going to Safeway in a
few minutes, does anyone want to come
along?' or a teacher canceling class for the
day."
Add that to convenient social networking,
gaming, problem sets due online and an end
less flow of news and information, and it is no
wonder that students spend hours online each
day.

"1 check email every live minutes," said
senior Ethan Townsend. "You like to feel that
all the emails you've gotten are taken care of."
But is this constant behavior a warning
sign?
Dr. Elias Aboujaoude. director of Stan
ford's Impulse Control Disorders Clinic, re
cently surveyed 2.5(H) people in a nationwide
study of Internet usage.
TTie results showed 14 percent of the popu
lation found it hard to stay away from the In
ternet for several days at a time, while eight
percent used the Internet as an escape from
problems. Another six percent said their per
sonal relationships suffered directly from tot)
much time online.
A segment of the population — should
they be called junkies? — is even seeking pro
fessional help for the addiction.
At the Stanford clinic, Aboujaoude has
treated many patients, including University
students, for problems related to the Inter
net.
"People come in because they've been dis
ciplined or fired for spending too much time
on the Internet," Aboujaoude said. "They
know they have a problem, but find it hard to
stop."
I le compared excessive use to more serious

behaviors.
"It's too early to call it an addic
tion like we call alcohol an addic
tion," he said. "But sometimes the
cravings people feel can be similar,
sometimes they need to gradually
increase intake to get the same kind
of satisfaction, and when they cut
back, they might feel recklessness
and withdraw."
At the epicenter of the Silicon
Valley, it can be difficult to draw the
distinction between normal and

compulsive use.
"There's so much information on
the Internet that you can read and
watch." said sophomore Kimberly
Johnson. "You can basically do any
thing you want without getting up
from the computer. It's addictive be

some more addictive than others.
"There are definitely people who
get lost in applications of the Inter
net." he said. "Some people play
World of Warcraft and never come
out of their rooms."
He expressed doubt that the
problem stems from the technology

itself.
"You can get addicted to any
activity," he said. "You can be ad
dicted to the Internet but still
have a social life and do well at
school."
From a clinical perspective,
Aboujaoude agreed, but he also put
out a note of optimism.
"'lTie Internet can be a wonderful
thing," he said. "It's not always bad.
Some patients with social anxiety
wouldn't be able to ask people out
on a date if they didn't break the ice
with a few emails first. When you feel
your virtual life and virtual relation
ships are more important than those
in your real life, that is when it be
