## Wrestlers secure starting roles 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford wrestling team is all set to open the 2006-2007
season after determining the starting lineup at last Saturday's
annual Wrestle-Offs. Through five matches and two exhibi
tions, the Cardinal cemented what will most likely be their fea
tured roster for a good portion of the early season.
"It was nice to get some experience in a competition setting
rather than just in practice," second-year coach Kerry McCoy
said."l'm very happy with how we wrestled. We still have some
decisions to make in some weight classes, but the bottom line
is we'll be ready for next week."
Competition began in earnest after sophomore Rafael
Chavez and junior captain Tanner Gardner won exhibition
matches to start the day.The early matches ended largely as ex
pected. Sophomore Tyler Parker successfully defended his
starting spot against true freshman Lucas Espericueta with a b-
2 win at I4M pounds. Josh Zupancic
did the same, outwrestling redshirt
freshman Peter Miller 10-1 at 157
pounds.
Ihe most highly anticipated
match of the day came at 165
pounds, l ast year's starter at 157
pounds, junior Scott Loescher,
squared off against senior captain
Brian Perry, who saw little team
competition last year. Perry earned
the starting spot in a hard-fought
bout, winning 6-1. Afterwards,
McCoy was appreciative of the ef
fort both of his veteran wrestlers put
into the match.
it's always a tough situation
when you have two of your best guys
competing at the same weight class,"
McCoy said. "Last week in our two
challenge matches Brian won one
and Scott won one.so we didn't real
ly know what we were going to see.
and it was a close match. Scott
fought hard and that's what's going
to make those guys better. It was
definitely good to see that kind of
tire in both of them."
Competition continued with
sophomore Luke Feist pinning
freshman Alex Muller at 174
pounds, followed by a match up of
true freshmen Jake Johnson and
Xach ( iiesen at IS4 pounds. Giesen
earned a 6-2 victory over his class
mate. but McCoy was optimistic
about the futures of both freshmen,
given the experienced teammates
and coaches they would be learning
from in the coming months.
"1 think both Zach and Jake will
get a good shot at improving,"
McCoy said. "They're really fortu
nate because they've got Luke Feist
to wrestle with, they've got [last
year's captain] Ray Blake as their
coach, they've got [coach] Matt
Gentry. Obviously if I feel like I can
hang with them. Ill r01l around, but
it's good to have them both in here."
Heading into the season, McCoy
said he was pleased with the attitude
and hard work his team has displayed
in practices and training so far.
"We've got a lot of young guys,
but they've got a lot of experience,"
McCoy said. "The core of our team
is sophomores and juniors, as op
posed to last year when they were
freshmen and sophomores. So we're
looking to have a really good year,
and I'm really excited because
everybody's working very hard and
setting the pace, and that's really
what we need. Everyone needs to
believe that we can be the best team
in order for it to happen."
