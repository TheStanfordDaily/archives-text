### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
No. 3 USC 31, Oregon State 33
Oregon State handed the Trojans
their first regular-season loss since they
fell to California in triple overtime on
Sept. 27,2003. USC had won 27 consec

utive Pacific-10 Conference games, 38
straight regular-season games and 18
straight road games before falling in
Corvallis.
The Trojans trailed Oregon State 33-
10 with four minutes left in the third
quarter. But a flurry of Beaver miscues
and some strong play from USC quar
terback John David Booty helped the

Trojans recover and cut the deficit one
score with 12:09 to go in the game.
The Trojans nearly completed the
comeback when Booty found receiver
Steve Smith in the right side of the end
zone from two-yards out with seven sec
onds to go. But Booty's pass attempt on
the potentially game-tying two-point
conversion was batted down by Jeff Van
Orsow to seal the upset.
The Beavers were able to take a big
lead early in the game, primarily by cap
italizing on USC's mistakes.The Trojans
turned the ball over four times, while
the Beavers did not commit any
turnovers.
Oregon State quarterback Matt
Moore finished 21-of-32 passing with
262 yards and one touchdown pass. 1 le
also ran for a score.
The Beavers were forced to play
without their starting running back.

with a sprained right knee that he suf
fered in Oregon State's 17-10 win over
Arizona last week. Clinton Polk started
in his place, running for 100 yards on 22
carries.
Oregon State had a chance to put the
game away in the fourth quarter, but ;i
number of mistakes gave the Trojans a
chance. The Beavers fumbled a punt at
tempt deep in their own territory that
resulted in a USC touchdown,and kick
er Alexis Serna missed a late field goal
that could have iced the game. Serna did
kick four field goals on the game, includ
ing one from 53 yards.
Smith and Booty both did their best
to keep the Trojans in it, but the
turnovers proved too much to over
come. Booty finished 24-of-39 passing
with 406 yards and three touchdowns,
while Smith reeled in 258 yards on 11 re
ceptions with two scores.
