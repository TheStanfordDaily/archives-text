## A Cavs-Mavs finale
### 
Last night, the new-look Bulls
tipped-off the 2006-07 NBA
season, new hall and all, and
dethroned the Miami I leat. With the
addition of Ben Wallace (listed at
6'9". 7'o" with 'fro), the Bulls have a
stalwart in their front-court to com
plement their talented, young back
court of Kirk Hinrich and Ben Gor
don. The I leat. of course, returned
soft-spoken superstar PwayneWade
and the Big Aristotle, Shaq. Al
though their performance last night
was absolutely miserable, the Heat,
as well as the Bulls, will likely end up
in playoff discussions. And so. as we
open the 2006 season, here are the
top four teams in each conference:
Eastern Conference:
1. Cleveland Cavaliers — It's always
hard to pick against last season's
champs, unless you have a great rea
son. And that great reason is Leßron
James. James is reaching the point in
his career where the Michael Jordan
comparisons are about to start run
ning wild. If Larry Hughes and the
rest of the supporting cast can stay
healthy, this is the year Leßron car
ries the Cavs back to the NBA finals.
2. Miami Heat — It would be wrong
to put the Heat any lower than sec
ond in the Eastern Conference. After
all. they are the reigning NBA
