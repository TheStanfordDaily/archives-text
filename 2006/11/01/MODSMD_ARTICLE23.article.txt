## A 						Cavs-Mavs finale 
### 
Last night, the new-look Bulls
tipped-off the 2006-07 NBA
season, new hall and all, and
dethroned the Miami I leat. With the
addition of Ben Wallace (listed at
6'9". 7'o" with 'fro), the Bulls have a
stalwart in their front-court to com
plement their talented, young back
court of Kirk Hinrich and Ben Gor
don. The I leat. of course, returned
soft-spoken superstar PwayneWade
and the Big Aristotle, Shaq. Al
though their performance last night
was absolutely miserable, the Heat,
as well as the Bulls, will likely end up
in playoff discussions. And so. as we
open the 2006 season, here are the
top four teams in each conference:
Eastern Conference:
1. Cleveland Cavaliers — It's always
hard to pick against last season's
champs, unless you have a great rea
son. And that great reason is Leßron
James. James is reaching the point in
his career where the Michael Jordan
comparisons are about to start run
ning wild. If Larry Hughes and the
rest of the supporting cast can stay
healthy, this is the year Leßron car
ries the Cavs back to the NBA finals.
2. Miami Heat — It would be wrong
to put the Heat any lower than sec
ond in the Eastern Conference. After
all. they are the reigning NBA
champs, and not much has changed
since last year. Then again, Shaq is a
year older and the competition in
the Eastern Conference has stepped
up. Doesn't look like there's going to
be a repeat.
3. Chicago Bulls — Through excel
lent drafting and some key free
agent pickups, the Bulls have man
aged to turn around a franchise that
was lost after the departure of MJ.
On paper, the Bulls have everything:
the scrappy, sharp shooting point
guard in 1 linrich. Mr. Clutch in Gor
don. the hard-nosed, rough-edged
player in Andres Nocioni and the
dominating defensive presence of
Ben Wallace. But then again, that's
on paper.
4. Washington Wizards — Most peo
ple laugh at this pick, and perhaps
rightly so.The Detroit Pistons would
make a better number-four consid
ering their dominance of the Eastern
Conference over the last few years.
But with the Pistons' loss of Ben
Wallace, the Wizards just may sneak
into the Eastern Conference elite.
Gilbert Arenas is probably the most
underrated player in the NBA and
has the capability of carrying the Wiz
deep into the playoffs.
Western Conference:
1. Dallas Mavericks — 'ITie Maver
icks are poised to make a return to
the NBA finals with Jason Terry,
Jerry Stackhouse, Josh Howard and
Dirk Nowitzki forming the core of
one of the most talented starting
lineups in the NBA. With rising star
Devin Harris coming off the bench
and Dallas' improved defense, it's

going to be tough to knock them off.
2. San Antonio Spurs — With the
nucleus of Tony Parker, Manu Gi
nohli and Tim Duncan still intact, the
Spurs are early favorites to at least
make it to the Western Conference
Finals. They are an incredibly deep
team, with Michael Finley. Robert
1 lorry and Brent Barry all available
off the bench. The only question
mark is starting center, Francisco
Elson. But overall, the Spurs remain
towards the top of the Western con
ference.
3. Phoenix Suns— If Amare Stau
damire stays healthy, the Suns have a
formidable lineup with the capabili
ty to run on teams or slow it down
and bang it inside. Steve Nash quiet
ly racks up monster numbers every
year and has the luxury of either
leading a fast attack with Raja Bell
and Boris Diaw, or pulling up and
send it down to the block trt'either
Shawn Marion or Amare.
4. Los Angeles Clippers — It's tough
coming into a season thinking that
the Clippers will ever be mentioned
in any discussion involving the word
"playoffs." This season the Clippers
have a chance to prove that they are
legit by performing under the pres
sure of expectations; something they
haven't felt in years.
Granted, the NBA Finals are still a
few light-years away, most people
have already slated the Dallas Mav
ericks and San Antonio Spurs into
the Western Conference finals. Look
for the Cavs to beat the Wizards in
an unexpected Eastern Conference
finals showdown and then lose in an
epic seven-game series to the Dallas
Mavericks. You heard it here first.
