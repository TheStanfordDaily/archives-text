## Online poker plays its last hand New law prohibits Internet gambling, sites shut down 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If Congress has its way. playing online
poker may no longer he a way for stu
dents to pay off loans or buy new cars. A
new federal law against Internet gam
bling is stifling online poker rooms,
though its effectiveness in stopping the
online gambling craze is not yet clear.
Some of the more popular online
gambling sites, including Party Poker.net
and Pokerßoom.com, have already an
nounced that they will stop serving U.S.
customers.
"We will have implemented the tech
nical solution to restrict all customers
within the U.S. from accessing our real
money games starting Monday, Nov. 6,"
said Pokerßoom.com in an email to its
clients.The company will continue allow
ing U.S. players to access its "play
money" games.

Other online poker rooms, mean
while, are flouting the new rule and con
tinue to allow U.S. customers to play with
real money. Full Tilt Poker and Poker
stars are two that have seen more play
ers. including Stanford students, flock to
their sites since the new regulations.
Despite the new restrictions. Stan
ford's cyber poker sharks don't expect to
stop betting big anytime soon.
"1 suppose they'll just switch to
whichever sites are still operational,"
said senior and Daily columnist Nate
Solon about other online players.
"Though that itself is somewhat trou
bling, since only the least law-respecting

sites will keep running."
Other students confirmed that
they plan to continue playing online,
even if it means taking their business
to more difficult tables.
"The games are much tougher, as
people who take the trouble to rede
posit onto other sites are probably
good regulars anyway," said one
Stanford student, who wished to re
main anonymous because they plan
to break the new law."However, I've
still found it profitable and will con
tinue to play online poker."
While several online poker ven
ues remain open, it is not clear if
there will still be a way to transfer
funds online to these Web sites. Most
sites depend on third-party escrow
services to get money from their cus
tomers. Players deposit money into
these third parties before transfer
ring those funds again to the gam
bling site of their choice.
However, Neteller, the biggest
and most popular of these fund
transfer services, has already an
nounced that it will obey the law.
"Neteller, a company registered
outside the U.S., will comply with the
act and its related regulations as if it
were subject to the act's jurisdic
tion," the Canadian company said in

a press release.
Using credit cards is generally not
an alternative. Since 2001, Visa and
MasterCard have not allowed direct
transfer of funds from credit card ac
counts to online gambling Web sites.
Some students dismissed the im
pact of Neteller's decision, saying
that "there will likely be another
substitute that comes along."
While the reactions of the $12 bil
lion gambling industry have been as
mixed as those of online poker Web
sites, there is a consensus that the law
will not be as effective as some of its
sponsors may have hoped.
"Hie one thing that the senators
and the president fail to see is that
gamblers want action, and by passing
this law, the action has gotten a bit
more dark and scary and local and a
black-and-white version of illegal,"
said Jim Quinn, a spokesman for the
Off-Shore Gaming Association.
Others were a bit more reserved.
"The American Gaming Associa
tion does support the creation of a
study commission to look into how
the U.S. can best address the entire
issue of online gambling," said Holly
Thomsen, a spokeswoman for one
industry lobbying group.
The law. known as the Unlawful
Internet Gambling Enforcement
Act, was attached at the last minute
as an amendment to the SAFE Port
Act. Congress passed the bill on
Sept. 30. and President Bush signed
it into law on Oct. 13.
