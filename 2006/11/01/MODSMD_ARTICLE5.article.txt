## BioNeXus network links science students Web site provides students with educational tools and social activities 
### LIA HARDIN 
A new social networking Web site is
being pitched by grad students as an im
portant part of the strategy to improve
collaboration across disciplines in the sci
ences.
Students in the BioX Program will
soon have their very own version of
Friendster — a "geekster" Web site
which will allow students in the interdis
ciplinary life sciences to network with
peers, professors and even potential em
ployers. It will allow members to swap re
search supplies and technical know-how.
"Why do we have to reinvent the
wheel?" said MD-Ph.D. candidate Af
sheen Afshar, president of the BioX
sponsored student group BioNeXus,
which is developing the Web site. "As stu

dents, we are all intimately familiar with
a common problem — we are trying to
learn a certain skill, hut...we know that
someone at Stanford already knows how
to do it like the back of his hand."
The "geekster" site will help solve this
problem.
BioX, which is housed within the
Clark Center, is an interdisciplinary pro
gram that brings together researchers
and students from disparate parts of the
life sciences research community. It sup
ports interdisciplinary research by pro
viding faculty with seed grants for re
search not falling directly within the
scope of a single academic department.
Students from different departments in
volved in interdisciplinary research can
also be "within" BioX.
In 2005, staff and students established
BioNeXus, a group for graduate students
and postdocs within the program.
"The first goal of BioNeXus is for
[these] people to meet each other," said
Jill Sakata, BioX education and fellow-
ship manager.
Afshar and bioengineering grad
uate student Adam Grossman are
part of a group of BioNeXus officers
who want to create more of a com
munity within BioX, which has yet to
have an impact on the academic ca
reer of the average graduate stu
dent.
"[The] issue is that BioNeXus is a
Weh site and we want it to be more."
said Grossman. "We want to take
this great bunch of support and

make it more of an entity."
Afshar, Grossman and their fel
low officers see social networking as
a big part of that. In addition to the
upcoming Web site, BioNeXus has
sponsored a barbeque featuring a
salsa band, regular Happy Hours
where BioX students can meet and
mingle and funded lunches and din
ners for small groups.
Although BioNeXus directs its
efforts toward graduate students,
undergraduates in the life sciences
are not excluded.
"We want to be the student group
that brings people together from dif
ferent disciplines," said Grossman.
"We want to be inclusive of every
body."
