## Community Farm fights for rights Fanners to negotiate with course developers 
### LYNDA BROWNING 
This is the second of a two-part se
ries about the Community Farm and
the Golf Course. It is a continuation
of Tuesday's "Seeds of contention."
The Stanford Golf Course expan
sion has obstructed the University's
Community Farm, and farmers are
organizing to negotiate with the de
velopers of the Stanford Golf

Course. Emmett Hopkins and
Michael Bachmann are leading the
effort. 'Hie two self-fashioned, well
dressed farmers (M.S. and M.D.. re
spectively) sat down at Bytes ( ate in
the Gates Computer Science Build
ing to discuss strategy.
"The soil is clay here, so it drains
poorly." Bachmann said. "If you have
runoff from [the golf course], you'll
have puddles. Plants will drown in the
rainy season and in the summer when
they are watering."
Bachmann smiles; green does not
come naturally to the Bay Area in summer. For the orig
inal Stanford Golf Course, obtaining a sufficient irriga
tion supply — which involved increasing the capacity of
1 ell Lake — cost more than the actual course construc
tion cost. Unless courses are landscaped with native and
drought-tolerant grasses and plants, a process known as
xeriscaping, irrigation rates are high. (As of press time,
the specifics of the proposed golf course landscaping are
in flux. "To he honest, it just changes all the time," said
Athletics Department spokesman Gary Migdol.)
Fhe original proposal for the establishment of the
Community Farm envisioned a farm devoted to practic
ing, demonstrating and refining sustainable and organic
farming techniques. Designers hoped to conserve water
by building soil structure.
L.ike the author of the original farm proposal. Bach
mann envisions the farm as an educational center for sus

tainable agriculture practices.
Some departments in the University look to mirror
Stanford's academic pursuit of sustainability on a practi
cal level. Galvanized by student support, Stanford Dining
Services has undertaken an initiative to increase the sus
tainability of its food system. Community gardens now
decorate dining halls: produce from these gardens adds
local flavor to student meals.
1 lopkins, who was hired to spearhead this sustainabil
ity effort, had hoped that the Community Farm would in
crease local production and program visibility. This as
pect of the program has been complicated by the recent
construction.
1 lopkins recently led a work day to help increase the
farm's food production. Four students worked for four
hours,readying the ground and preparing to lay down de
fenses against the squirrels and gophers.
