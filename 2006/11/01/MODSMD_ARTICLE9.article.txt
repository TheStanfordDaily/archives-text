## NEWS ANALYSIS North Korea Comes back to the six-party talks Experts on Korea use past experiences to downplay and give perspective to revival of talks after the apparent nuclear explosion on Oct. 9 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
Experts were quick to throw water on the
hype surrounding Kim Jong Il'sTuesday
decision that North Korea would rejoin
the six-party talks over its nuclear weapons
program. A panel of University specialists ar
gued about what role the I Jnited States should
play in the North Korea crisis that erupted
after the totalitarian power's apparent nuclear
test on Oct. *■).
"The talks have always been an escape
valve for the North Koreans." said Daniel Snei
der. the associate director of the Shorenstein
Asia-Pacific Research Center (APARC).
"They could always opt to return to the six
party talks when pressure mounted from China
or South Korea, without particular cost to their
own government. They lose nothing by coming
back to the table, but we don't know if they're
interested in more serious negotiations."
The Chinese government played a crucial
part in pressuring Nin th Korea to return to in
ternational negotiations after more than a
year-long hiatus. In addition to being the host
for the six-party talks. China is North Korea's
largest trading partner and wields consider
able economic and military influence over
North Korea. Tuesday's announcement that
North Korea would be returning to the multi
lateral talks was made by China.
"China has been pretty clear about dis
pleasure with the test, and probabh h;is been
twisting Kim Jong li s arm a little bit." s;iid

China, which has traditionally been a close
ally of North Korea, has been cooperating
closely with the United States in attempting to
resolve the situation. In a groundbreaking
move, China voted for United Nations Securi
ty Council resolutions in July and October that
imposed sanctions against North Korea for its

nuclear testing.
"These are the first times that China has
supported sanctions targeting North Korea."
said Xiyu Yang, a career diplomat in the Chi
nese government, "but China supported the
sanctions because it wanted the sanctions to be
important in future diplomacy."
Yang was a counselor in the Department of
Asian Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Af
fairsof China, as well as the inaugural Director
of the Chinese Ministry's Office for Korean
Peninsula Issues.
Yang emphasized the limited role China
could play in resolving the conflict.
"Can we pull North Korea back to the
table?" he asked. "I say yes, because North
Korea has always wanted the resumption of
the talks. But the more critical point is whether
the talks can make a progress, and that answer
lies in Pyongyang's desires, not in what China
docs."
Sneider, who once covered North Korea for
the San Jose Mercury News, called Tuesday's
announcement an "important moment in
China-U.S. relations."
"Not that there aren't differences — differ
ent sets of interests — but in my memory, this
is the first time that China and the U.S. have
worked together to solve a security problem,
rhe outcome of this process is going to have a
huge impact on our relations down the road,"
he said.
Sneider criticized American policy with re
gard to the North.
"Ibis administration likes to talk about
how great the six-party talks are, that it spreads
responsibility and isolates North Koreans," he
said. "All of that has some truth to it. but the
real truth is that it's not a very good format for
engaging the North Koreans. Hie Agreed
I ramework negotiations involved thousands
of hours of direct talks between American and
Korean officials. A crisis of this scope can't be
resolved through a few hours of talk in Bei

jing."
The former Chinese official criticized the
Bush administration's unwillingness to engage
in direct bilateral talks with North Korea.
"China has always encouraged bilateral
talks." said Yang, "but in this administration,
the policy has become no bilateral talks at all."
But Macintyre argued that the Bush ad
ministration's unwillingness to engage in bilat
eral talks was not entirely unreasonable.
"1 think the U.S.'s issue is that, if North
Korea gets into bilateral negotiations with the
U.S.. North Korea will lose interest in the six
party talks, so the U.S. will be forced to make
concessions or risk having North Korea walk
out of the talks," he said.
"It's important to remember that in the last
few weeks since the nuclear test, the Republi
cans have been blaming Clinton for his deals in
the 1990s that let the North Koreans keep their
program, and Democrats have been blaming
Bush for not talking with the North Koreans.
There are two sides to this, and there's defi
nitely a downside to bilateral negotiations for
the United States."
Tuesday's panel discussion, which was
sponsored by the Forum for American/Chi
nese Exchange, brought out about 20 to the
Cypress Room ofTresidder Union.
Macintyre, who has traveled six times into
highly-restrictive North Korea, also reiterated
the need for an effective resolution of the con
flict. because any sanctions imposed upon
North Korea would likely affect the average
impoverished North Korean citizen.
"The talks do not help the situation of the
average North Korean who is still living in a
country where food is short," he said. "There
are a great number of malnourished North Ko
reans. particularly children, whose living con
ditions remain terrible. As the talks go on.
none of these issues are being addressed, and
North Koreans continue to grow stunted, un
dereducated and underfed."

ent sets of interests — but in my memory, this
is the first time that China and the U.S. have
worked together to solve a security problem,
rhe outcome of this process is going to have a
huge impact on our relations down the road,"
he said.
Sneider criticized American policy with re
gard to the North.
"Ibis administration likes to talk about
how great the six-party talks are, that it spreads
responsibility and isolates North Koreans," he
said. "All of that has some truth to it. but the
real truth is that it's not a very good format for
engaging the North Koreans. Hie Agreed
I ramework negotiations involved thousands
of hours of direct talks between American and
Korean officials. A crisis of this scope can't be
resolved through a few hours of talk in Bei

jing."
The former Chinese official criticized the
Bush administration's unwillingness to engage
in direct bilateral talks with North Korea.
"China has always encouraged bilateral
talks." said Yang, "but in this administration,
the policy has become no bilateral talks at all."
But Macintyre argued that the Bush ad
ministration's unwillingness to engage in bilat
eral talks was not entirely unreasonable.
"1 think the U.S.'s issue is that, if North
Korea gets into bilateral negotiations with the
U.S.. North Korea will lose interest in the six
party talks, so the U.S. will be forced to make
concessions or risk having North Korea walk
out of the talks," he said.
"It's important to remember that in the last
few weeks since the nuclear test, the Republi
cans have been blaming Clinton for his deals in
the 1990s that let the North Koreans keep their
program, and Democrats have been blaming
Bush for not talking with the North Koreans.
There are two sides to this, and there's defi
nitely a downside to bilateral negotiations for
the United States."
Tuesday's panel discussion, which was
sponsored by the Forum for American/Chi
nese Exchange, brought out about 20 to the
Cypress Room ofTresidder Union.
Macintyre, who has traveled six times into
highly-restrictive North Korea, also reiterated
the need for an effective resolution of the con
flict. because any sanctions imposed upon
North Korea would likely affect the average
impoverished North Korean citizen.
"The talks do not help the situation of the
average North Korean who is still living in a
country where food is short," he said. "There
are a great number of malnourished North Ko
reans. particularly children, whose living con
ditions remain terrible. As the talks go on.
none of these issues are being addressed, and
North Koreans continue to grow stunted, un
dereducated and underfed."





A panel discussion in the Cypress Room atTresidder Union (below) considered the North
Korean announcement that it would restart six-party talks. The panelists were pessimistic
about the prospects for new talks. The discussion came after North Korea's apparent nu

Experts were quick to throw water on the
hype surrounding Kim Jong Il'sTuesday
decision that North Korea would rejoin
the six-party talks over its nuclear weapons
program. A panel of University specialists ar
gued about what role the I Jnited States should
play in the North Korea crisis that erupted
after the totalitarian power's apparent nuclear
test on Oct. *■).
"The talks have always been an escape
valve for the North Koreans." said Daniel Snei
der. the associate director of the Shorenstein
Asia-Pacific Research Center (APARC).
"They could always opt to return to the six
party talks when pressure mounted from China
or South Korea, without particular cost to their
own government. They lose nothing by coming
back to the table, but we don't know if they're
interested in more serious negotiations."
The Chinese government played a crucial
part in pressuring Nin th Korea to return to in
ternational negotiations after more than a
year-long hiatus. In addition to being the host
for the six-party talks. China is North Korea's
largest trading partner and wields consider
able economic and military influence over
North Korea. Tuesday's announcement that
North Korea would be returning to the multi
lateral talks was made by China.
"China has been pretty clear about dis
pleasure with the test, and probabh h;is been
twisting Kim Jong li s arm a little bit." s;iid

reau chief from 2(X)1 to 2(X)h.
China, which has traditionally been a close
ally of North Korea, has been cooperating
closely with the United States in attempting to
resolve the situation. In a groundbreaking
move, China voted for United Nations Securi
ty Council resolutions in July and October that
imposed sanctions against North Korea for its

nuclear testing.
"These are the first times that China has
supported sanctions targeting North Korea."
said Xiyu Yang, a career diplomat in the Chi
nese government, "but China supported the
sanctions because it wanted the sanctions to be
important in future diplomacy."
Yang was a counselor in the Department of
Asian Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Af
fairsof China, as well as the inaugural Director
of the Chinese Ministry's Office for Korean
Peninsula Issues.
Yang emphasized the limited role China
could play in resolving the conflict.
"Can we pull North Korea back to the
table?" he asked. "I say yes, because North
Korea has always wanted the resumption of
the talks. But the more critical point is whether
the talks can make a progress, and that answer
lies in Pyongyang's desires, not in what China
docs."
Sneider, who once covered North Korea for
the San Jose Mercury News, called Tuesday's
announcement an "important moment in
China-U.S. relations."
"Not that there aren't differences — differ
ent sets of interests — but in my memory, this
is the first time that China and the U.S. have
worked together to solve a security problem,
rhe outcome of this process is going to have a
