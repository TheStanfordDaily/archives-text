# A 						defense of political correctness
## 
### 
Some readers have critieized this col
umn as being politically correct. Many
might be offended by this response,
but I'm inclined to thank them. 1 like being
politically correct.To me, it means I'm rec
ognizing that other social groups are subju
gated by the mainstream â€” the male,
white, European, upper-middle class,
American, heterosexual. Christian, middle
aged, able-bodied mainstream that con
sciously and unconsciously tries to make
everyone else fit into its own social norms
and expectations.
Last week, when my co-columnist
Bharat criticized Stanford's housing policy
for not allowing opposite-sex roommates,
he was making a politically correct argu
ment because he was saying that we do not
all fit into the norm of all men wanting to
room with men and all women wanting to
room with women. In fact, the entire idea
behind this column could be described as
trying to advance politically correct ideas
about social issues.
Cheshire Calhoun's entry on political
correctness in Routledge's "Encyclopedia
of Ethics" defines political correctness as
"any change in language, policy, social be
havior and cultural representation that is
aimed at avoiding or correcting a narrowly

Eurocentric world view and the long-stand
ing subordination of some social groups."
Much to my surprise, I found a passage in
the book "Democracy Matters" by the ex
tremely liberal Cornel West in which he de
scribes political correctness as "a term
coined by those who tend to trivialize the
scars of others and minimize the suffering of
victims."
ITiese two views of political correctness
may seem to contradict, but I don't think they
do. I believe West is referring to the way con
servatives have co-opted the use of political
correctness, making it into something silly.
Calhoun recognizes this co-optation when he
says political correctness is also used to
"imply that while [something politically cor
rect! correctly conforms to a liberal academ-

ie party line, it is... simply unnecessary
or silly."This use of the term belittles
the majority's subjugation of minori
ties rather than criticizing it.
Every column that Bharat and 1
have written has been called politi
cally correct in this way. When we
wrote that professors should be con
scious of how expensive reading ma
terials disproportionately burden
students with lower incomes, when
we wrote about how homophobic
jokes perpetuate a negative image of
gays and when we wrote about a sex
ist housing policy we were always
called politically correct. In all in
stances, the insuit of calling us "polit
ically correct" was used to silence us
by implying that we were being too
serious, too sensitive and therefore
just plain silly.
But I defend each and every one
of our politically correct columns on
the very basis that they are, indeed,
politically correct. In a society domi
nated by wealthy interests, the dis
proportionate burdens of less
wealthy students should be dis
cussed. In a society dominated by
heterosexual views, the negative ef
fects of homophobic jokes should be
made clear. In a university dominat
ed by heteronormative rules, hous
ing policy should be known for what

it is: sexist. I"hese topics are '"politi
cally correct topics" because they
discuss the mainstream's subjuga
tion of minority groups.
How did conservatives get away
with redefining political correctness
as something silly? I find this an ex
tremely important term, what Cal
houn suggests might be a "useful,
perhaps essential, part of our moral
vocabulary." It describes a type ot
thinking that emphasizes how ma
jorities are ignorant to the differ
ences between themselves and their
respective minorities and the conse
quences of that ignorance.
For instance, 1 recently learned
that many homeless people do not
want to be called homeless, prefer
ring the term "un-housed." I'm part
of a majority of people who has hous
ing. so I never even thought to stop
and think about how the minority ot
those who are without a residence
might wish to be called. I was igno
rant to the fact that calling someone
without a place to sleep "homeless is
actually incorrect. The un-housed
residents of Palo Alto consider Palo
Alto to be their home: they just don t
have a house or an apartment in
which to sleep. The consequence ot
my ignorance was to deny un-housed
Palo Altans their membership in our
community. I now embrace the polit
ically correct term "un-housed" be
cause it recognizes that people with
out a residence might very well still
have a home.
While I'm obviously an advocate

of political correctness,! should men
tion that I also see fault in some as
pects of its use. particularly when it is
used to hide prejudice and ignorance.
Just because I know to call a person
without a residence un-housed in
stead of homeless, for instance, does
not mean I understand why this dis
tinction is important. My use of the
term without this understanding
merely hides my ignorance. I still
don't know that one should use the
term un-housed because un housed
people still have a home. Using a po
litically correct term without under
standing why to use it hides rather
than eliminates ignorance.
So while I have problems with
some uses of political correctness, I
embrace what it tries to accomplish.
I agree with the feminist notion that
"the personal is political." Society
may have legally recognized the
need to protect minorities through
polices like the Equal Rights
Amendment, but laws do not force
people to treat minorities equally in
social interactions; they do not force
the majority to think about how the
minority differs from themselves.
Political correctness encourages this
type of thinking and so is an essential
part of our moral vocabulary.
