# The 						right to remain silent

(Spanish) El perico dice lo que sabe, pero no
sabe lo que dice.
(English) The parrot says what he knows, but
doesn V know what he says.
A Maryland court recently ruled that
if a woman consents to sex at any
point,she cannot withdraw her con
sent after the act has begun ("Court:
Woman can't say no after start of sex," As
sociated Press, Oct. 31). I say, good for
Maryland — even if they do have a long
way to go, at least they're heading in the
right direction. Other states need to join
the movement and get rid of these sad lib
eral policies from recent decades protect
ing rape "victims."
1 still don't understand how anyone ever
came up with the idea that such women are
victims. Only witches could make the
stronger sex act on such base impulses; it's
the men who are the real victims in these
cases. It's just another habit we need to
break. In the past several decades, our
once-proud nation has been steaming
ahead under the guidance of the liberal

agenda. We've instituted sexist policies that
favor women over men and enable women
not only to have sex out of wedlock, but also
to blame men for it.
Haven't the liberals had their fun? It's
time to get this nation back on track, and
we've been doing a pretty good job these
past few years. This is not the time to start
backsliding. Liberals are a bunch of par
rots: They say what they know they
"should" say — what the devil wants them
to say — but they don't know the meaning
behind what they're saying. When they say
that a woman should be protected from
rape, it's as much of a euphemism as claim
ing to be "pro-choice." These pretty words

hide the real meaning — they want to sac
rifice living souls in the latter case, and take
away a man's right to make decisions about
when he wants to have sex in the former.
According to a poll attached to an article
about the Maryland decision, only around 40
percent of people agree with the court's deci
sion. Iliis is the root of the problem. Because
we are a representative democracy, in order
to make real progress we have to sway the
majority; otherwise this stride forward will
simply be overturned after the next election.
Easy ways to move the masses involve
propaganda and scare tactics. (It's too expen
sive to present sound arguments, simply be
cause there are too many people who are ap
athetic or stupid or have had their reasoning
abilities permanently damaged by liberal
ism.) You never have to worry much about
people if you scare them. If people are scared
of you. you can get away with almost any
thing because they won't risk sticking their
necks out to complain. Sure, there's the
worrv that if you scare them too much (but

you'll get locked up. But that's usual
ly only if you kill people or injure
small children (and even these can
be taken care of by the right
lawyers).
But even if you don't want to go
to that extreme, there are smaller
things you can do to instill fear, and
over time they add up. It's best to di
vide and conquer in this case — let
women work themselves into a fren
zy about "getting raped:" get people
on the border scared of illegal immi
grants wanting to steal their jobs;
make sure people are primed to sus
pect anyone remotely different in

appearance or behavior as a poten
tial terrorist.
ITiis is why the Bush administra
tion is one of the best we've had —
how many people have come knock
ing since we started random bomb
ings. other than those few liberal
winners who are still holding out?
Iliis frees up the government to do
what needs to be done. 1 know I cer
tainly won't complain about the ad
ministration taking away a couple of
silly, little rights. I'm no terrorist, and
I'm certainly never going to be
"raped." so why should 1 risk my
neck for those sinners who bring
punishment on themselves? I know
they'll never come for me.
