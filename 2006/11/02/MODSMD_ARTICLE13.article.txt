# Letter to the Editor
## Note from an "Impressionable Freshman" 
### 
Yes, as columnist Darren Franich assured
fellow Stanfordites on TUesday, "reading The
Daily is an angry, physical experience" ("The
tragic ignorance of resident fellows," Oct.
31). It does hurt to pick up the paper in the
morning and discover that those you know
and respect have been trashed by your fellow
students. It hurts to digest the fact that fellow
Stanford students could childishly mock the
names and ridicule the appearances of those
close to you. And it hurts to believe that
columns like Darren Franich's could even
exist in a purportedly open-minded and in
tellectual university environment.
As a freshman in Branner Hall. 1 am new
to the Stanford community. And though
some, like Darren Franich, may assume I'm
an immature "little freshman," i feel I've had
sufficient opportunity to observe my sur
roundings and form my own opinions about
who and what are right and wrong. And I've
decided, along with the majority of my fellow
Branner freshmen, that I love our dorm RFs,
Clyde Moneyhun and Nancy Buffington.
These past few weeks have been a rough
time for Branner. We've been accused of act
ing as the NSO party dorm, we've been mis
quoted and now our RFs have become the
victims of disgusting, hostile, downright mali

cious slander. Our dorm was in shock when
The Daily was distributed Tuesday with
printed editorial comments naming our
much-loved Clyde Moneyhun as "everything
wrong with Stanford...with 21st-century
America and our global community." Wow.
Darren Franich takes umbrage at Clyde's
suggestion of a "nice" dorm reunion; he claims
that "any fifth-grade English teacher could tell
you [nice] is the worst descriptive word in the
English language." Really, Darren, watch your
own rhetoric. I've never met a fifth grade
teacher who specializes in Einglish. and what
about avoiding broad, general statements?
Everything wrong with 21st-century' America
and our global community '/ English 101. Dar
ren. Your "liberal sensibility" shakes with fury
at the mention of the terrible Clyde Money
hun? I guess George Bush, global warming and
genocide in Darfur simply pale in comparison.
I speak on behalf of Branner Hall in sup
port of Clyde Moneyhun's decision to cancel
the dorm reunion so cleverly titled "Fresh
men Disorientation." Sure, we're 18 and just
out of high school, but we got into Stanford
and we're smart enough to make our own
choices. We don't need upperclassman advice
about when to "take a break from those
IHUM papers." We don't need your desper
ately mature guidance on how to have a good
time, either — trust me, Branner has that
area well-covered. And as much as it's com

forting to know that a group of Stanford sen
iors has nothing more important to do that
hang out and drink with a hunch of freshmen,
we don't really appreciate the concept of a
progressive "themed something clever like
'Golf Pros and Bikini Sluts."' These concepts
are offensive and degrading; Clyde did us a
favor in closing the door on such visitors, and
we would have done the same. ITiis is not a
matter between Branner alumni and Bran
ner RFs;it's a matter between Branner pres
ent and past residents (and.anyway,you lived
in Larkin, Darren, so what do you care?). If
former Brannerites want to get together to
party, by all means, do so. but why do you
want current freshmen involved? It kind of
smacks of exploitation — don't you know
anyone your own age to play with .' And it's
our house now, anyway; if you want to come
visit, ask us, and show some courtesy.
Clyde and Nancy are not our parents; they
are quite, simply, the coolest, kindest, most
agreeable pair of RFs that any Stanford
freshman could hope to know. Don't worry
Darren; "the impressionable Branner fresh
men do not respect [Clyde] any less" for all of
your defamation. We love him even more. In
fact, what has impressed us most is how
unimpressive you are.
