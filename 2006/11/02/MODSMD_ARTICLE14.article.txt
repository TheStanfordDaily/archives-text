In Tuesday's paper, Daily
columnist Darren Franich
lamented Res Ed's current
implementation of alcohol poli
cy, citing the example of Bran
ner resident fellow Clyde Mon
eyhun ("The tragic ignorance
of resident fellows," Oct. 31).

Kudos to Mr. Moneyhun. Alco
hol is a dangerous drug that has de
stroyed many lives and it can only
interfere with obtaining an educa
tion. Yes, education and studies are
why students should go to Stanford
— not to drink. Mr. Franich. you
need to understand that drinking is
not cool.'l"here is nothing cool about
slurred speech and other aspects of
drunkenness. Mr. Franich, you need
to grow up. Again, I salute Mr. Mon
eyhun for looking out after the best
interests of the residents of Branner
and for having the guts to face the
predictable pablum from those sup
porting student drinking. Freshmen
have enough to deal with without
having the additional peer pressures
of drinking foisted on them.

Dear Mr. Franich: you are my
hero. Predictable pablum and all.
Underage drinking is a fine Ameri
can tradition, and it hurts me to see
people trying to strip it away from
us. Preach on.

Herb is right. Stanford's past is
littered with former alumni who
have been ruined by alcohol and
unauthorized fun that used to occur
regularly at Stanford. It's a good
thing the administration is cleaning
up this campus so that we can final
ly start graduating individuals who
might actually have a chance in life.
Seriously though, the former Stan
ford alumni I met all had much
more fun (with alcohol even) than 1
was allowed to have at Stanford,
and were all incredibly successful
individuals. I would even venture to
say there might be a correlation be-

tween the two. Ihe hand-wringing
over alcohol use is completely un
necessary. Congratulations to
Franich for taking a politically in
correct and unpopular stand that is
necessary for Stanford.

Bravo! Thank God someone fi
nally said what a ton of us feel. No
body is forcing these kids to drink.
Branner has really gone down the
crapper in recent years — with
Nazi RFs/RAs and a much more
mellow selection of students (they
are putting SLE kids in Branner
now). Stanford University: where
fun comes to die. We're nerdy
enough here, don't kill it for those
of us who try and rise above the so
cially awkward DnD playing popu
lation that inhabits the majority of
this University.

Hiding from challenges and is
sues in a bottle rather than dealing
with them. Congratulations, Mr.
Franich. Shall I pour you a drink?

For the two alumni posters: Al
cohol use does not equate to alco
holism. If the world were they way
you've painted it, all of Europe
would be on the streets begging for
change to buy their next $2 wine
bottle and drink their sorrows away.
Alcohol is an established social lu
bricant in cultures worldwide. It has
been around for thousands of years.
Taking a stance to prevent abuse is
admirable — that's what Stanford
had been doing for years prior to
the recent few. Drinking was a per
sonal decision, and if made illegally,
the individual was at risk. However,
it was not hidden and the residen
tial educators (RFs. RAs.et al.) did
not punish individuals for their
choices. Instead, they were there to
observe, to teach about safe ap
proaches to alcohol and parties and
to provide a safety net in case indi
viduals were abusive in their behav
iors. Now. Stanford is taking the
boarding school approach. Any evi
dence of anything will result in dou
ble-secret probation and expulsion.
Today's Stanford protects the stu-

dents from themselves too much.

1 think that what ticks off most of
the students who have heard about
this is the way that Moneyhun han
dled the situation. Instead of trying
to turn a potentially risky situation
into a better one, he slammed down
an iron fist right in the face of the
students who won't stand for that
type of treatment. Had he asked to
meet with the students before the
reunion and discussed that no alco
hol should be provided by the up
perclassmen, and then proceeded
to let them handle it on their own,
I'm sure we wouldn't be having this
ridiculous discussion. We as stu
dents all know that an RF can't
"let" underage students drink. We
know that it's their job to help us
learn and grow as young adults. At
the same time, part of that job is
providing guidance and letting us
choose the path we feel is best. and.
as has been mentioned thus far. let
ting us make the wrong choice
every now and then.

I don't understand how Stanford
made the mistake of admitting a per
son with such liberal ideas as
Franich! He is definitely poisoning
the minds of so many promising
youth with his nonconformist ideas.
However,should Mr. Franich decide
to run for an ASSIJ executive posi
tion next year. I would definitely
vote for him. Maybe it's time some
one will tell those money huns in the
administration that this University is
really here for the students!

You know, part of growing is
learning how to handle peer pres
sure and social pressures, such as
drinking. Stanford is a nice little
bubble that so many undergrads live
in and never have to experience the
real world. Well, guess what, in the
real world people drink and get ob
noxious. and there is a lot of alcohol
around all of the time if you want to
socialize and not hide alone with
your cat in your one-room apart
ment. Learning to drink responsibly
and handle yourself as an adult is as

important as any aspect of college
life, and outlawing alcohol or com
ing down with an iron fist alcohol
policy is only going to do one thing:
make people look for what they are
being denied all the harder.

I'm a current Brannerite, and
while 1 cannot speak on behalf of
my fellow Brannerites. I would like
to say that 1 support our RF com
pletely. There is no need for any
senior drunken "mentoring" and
Clyde was simply looking out for
our best interests. Mr. Franich,
while 1 respect your right to an
opinion, there was certainly no
need for the rude and insulting tone
you took in this article. 1 support
Clyde entirely.

Fight the man. Darren, especial
ly power-tripping mid-level admin
istrators like Moneyhun. Stanford
has progressively moved towards a
nanny-institution since my time
here began, and all it's created are
more dangerous conditions for stu
dent safety (e.g. unsupervised binge
drinking in rooms rather than social
occasions in lounges).

Quick comment on the Branner
ites posting here: Hey, great, you
support your RF... but the reunion is
half for the people coming back to
the dorms. Bringing booze back to
Branner isn't an alcoholic mentor
ing program — you're adults, you
choose to drink the beer or you
choose to not drink the beer. Feeling
pressure equates to not sticking up
for yourself.This is college, you're an
adult, everyone has the right to say
no to things. If you have trouble say
ing no to some friendly seniors with
a can of beer, you're going to have
bigger problems in the real world.
You shouldn't need a pseudo-daddy
RF to keep you safe. Be adults!
