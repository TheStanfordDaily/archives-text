There is a philosophy held by a
certain segment of Ml.B Gen

be a commitment to mediocrity to
being just good enough to beat out
the competition in the regular season

hoping that statistical anomalies
could allow the best teams to Hse to
inferior competition in best-01-five
and best-of-seven contests.

"Moneyball" approach unnecessary.
Teams like the Astros, Cardinals and
Giants have been following such a
strategy for years, some more openly
than others. Giants GM Brian
Sabean had even gone solar as to call
the postseason little more than a
"crapshoot."
I never understood such a policy. I
always thought that in sports you
