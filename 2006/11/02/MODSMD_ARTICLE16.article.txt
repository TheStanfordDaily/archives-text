# More than lucky

There is a philosophy held by a
certain segment of Ml.B Gen
eral Management that I used
to hate. It was perceived by many to
be a commitment to mediocrity to
being just good enough to beat out
the competition in the regular season
and then trust to luck in the playoffs,
hoping that statistical anomalies
could allow the best teams to Hse to
inferior competition in best-01-five
and best-of-seven contests.
It was a strategy for mid-market
teams — clubs that couldn't spend
the kind of cash that the Yankees,
Red Sox and the like could, yet had
markets large enough to support
some veterans, rendering an all-out
"Moneyball" approach unnecessary.
Teams like the Astros, Cardinals and
Giants have been following such a
strategy for years, some more openly
than others. Giants GM Brian
Sabean had even gone solar as to call
the postseason little more than a
"crapshoot."
I never understood such a policy. I
always thought that in sports you
were either genuinely trying to win it
all. or you weren't — there was no
middle ground.
Then St. Louis proved me wrong
by parading their 83-win club
through the playoffs and then down
Market Street after winning the
World Series over Jim Leyland's De
troit Tigers.The Cardinals showed lis

all that maybe the regular season really is
meaningless in this modern era of Wild
Card baseball. But I'm not buying it.
So how, then, did it come to pass that
St Louis won it all with its roster of regu
lar-season misfits and underachievers?
Well, for one, you have to give credit to
Cards GM Walt Jocketty, who pushed all
the right buttons with midseason trades
and acquisitions, lie took chances on
Ronnie Belliard. Preston Wilson and Jeff
Weaver, all of whom turned out to be key
contributors to the postseason reincarna
tion of the Redbirds.
Moreover, the team had several of its
own players suddenly return to form late
in the season. Centerfielder Jim Ed
monds. thud baseman Scott Rolen and
shortstop David Lckstein all came alive
when October rolled around. Their
slumps and injuries had been big factors
in dooming the Cards to their only slight
ly better than average regular-season
showing. Perhaps their efforts are the
best indication that St. Louis didn't win
with a bad team, but rather with an un
derachieving good team that got hot at
the right time.
It's too bad that this isn't where the
story of the 2006 Champs all ends. Maybe
then 1 could believe that, in any given
year, a bad team could catch fire at the
right moment and finish as champions.

And wouldn't that give hope to us all? At
least, all of us except for those Yankees
fans still seething that any team with a
payroll less than $100 million could finish
on top.
But that's only part of the story, be
cause there was one area in which the
Cardinals were truly among the elite in
the major leagues. Manager lony La
Russa clearly proved to anyone who did
n't already know that he is one of the
best. His brilliant job with the club in and
leading up to the postseason saved St.
Louis' season. Just getting the team's psy
che back, after a horrendous late-season
slump that almost knocked the Cardinals
out of the playoffs, was a minor miracle.
But La Russa kept his clubhouse focused
and the players responded.
La Russa's reputation as one of the
best strategists in baseball has been real
firmed. Not once was he clearly outma
neuvered in postseason play. But the sin
gle most brilliant aspect of La Russa's
playoff strategy didn't actually begin in
October — no. La Russa was making his
move all the way back in June and July
with his handling of young pitcher Adam
Wainwright who developed into the kind
of shutdown closer that is of vital impor
tance to a team's championship chances.
Anyone who followed the Cardinals
in 200(i knows that the bingest lie going

into October was that the injury to closer
Jason Isringhausen would prove detri
mental to the team's chances. In reality,
Isringhausen's absence was a relief to St.
Louis fans who had sweated through vir
tually every ninth inning the veteran
pitched.There were calls for him to be re
placed by Wainwright — clearly the
team's best reliever — throughout the
summer and into the fall. But La Russa
kept his cool, and kept the rookie under
wraps until the games really counted.
And suddenly the Padres, Mets and
Tigers found themselves facing a closer
they were relatively unfamiliar with, a
player they probably hadn't studied too
much as just one among many bullpen
pitchers during the season. But now, he
was dropping his big curve over the plate
for strikes and looking virtually unhit
table.
So the next time someone tells you the
Cardinals got lucky, or that theirs was the
worst team to win a championship in
decades, remember that their manager, at
least, began earning his World Series ring
all the way back in July. Because Tony La
Russa isn't just a step or two ahead of the
next guy — he's in the lead by about four
months.
