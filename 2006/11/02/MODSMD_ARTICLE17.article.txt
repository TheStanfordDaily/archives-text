tournament this weekend. It will be the third tournament of the fall season for the Cardinal women.
of Elizabeth Plotkin and Daniela
Bercek.
"This is an indoor tournament and
1 grew up playing indoors," Logar
said. "I feel like I'm playing on my
home turf."
Coach Brennan expressed similar

feelings about Logar's prospects.
"She has a very good chance." he
said."She always does well indoors. It
suits her aggressive style very well."
Brennan thought that Nguyen
might have a tougher time adjusting
to the unique style required in indoor
events.
"The surface will be a little differ
ent for her," he said. "She's not a very
big player, but she's still quick."
Nguyen has been a very pleasant
surprise for the Cardinal this year.

I"he sophomore was not a starter on
last year's championship team, but
this season she has become one of the
most exciting players on the court.
Brennan is hopeful that Nguyen
can carry her early-season momen
tum into this weekend's event.
"They're a tough team when they
get on a roll." said Brennan of
Nguyen and Durkin. "They will be a
real complement to each other."
The National Indoors will be per
haps the toughest tournament for

the Cardinal this season. Although
the tournament defers in stature to
May's National Championships, it is
an exclusive tournament, inviting
only the best of the best.
"Everyone in this tournament
earned their way here," Brennan
said. "There are no gimmes."
Despite the competitive nature of
the tournament, Brennan is still con
fident in the Cardinal's chances.
"1 think we're up to the chal
lenge," he said.
