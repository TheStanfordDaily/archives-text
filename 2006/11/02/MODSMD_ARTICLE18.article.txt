# The 						long and short of Zack Miller
## "Zack should definitely give it a shot...It would only be the natural succession for Zack to move on to the pros." 
### ROXIE DICKINSON 
When men's golf coach Conrad Ray
was asked if there was anything quirky
about senior Zack Miller, it didn't take
him long to respond.
"Miller plays with two putters." Ray
said. "He takes a lot of harassment from
the guys. It's really rare in golf to see a
golfer use two putters consistently but it
has worked well for him so far."
So ... Zack Miller uses two putters.
I"he shorter one is used for long putts, and
the longer one is used for short putts.
Of course, there is more to the quiet

and amiable Miller than just his quirky
putting.The senior is planning to pursue a
career in golf after graduation.
"It's an interesting yet uncertain
path." Miller said. "Once you turn pro

CONRAD RAY, Men's qolf coach

you're definitely on your own. Profes
sional golf is an extremely difficult pro
fession at first because people really only
think of golfers who are top players in
world."
But Miller may just have what it takes
to he one of those top players himself
someday.
"Zack should definitely give it shot,"
Ray said. "To be able to win and compote
with the high skill level in the Pac-10, it
would be only the natural succession for
Zack to move on to the pros. He has a
great short game and a great touch. All of
these things factor well into a great pro
fessional career."
Throughout the fall season. Miller has
consistently proven that he has the talent
to make it in the world of professional golf.
Most recently, he was named the Golf
World Golfer of the Week for his perform
ance in the Prestige at the PGA West Tour
nament in La Quinta, Calif.
ITie Prestige was the first individual
win of Miller's collegiate career. With the
tournament on the line. Miller had to
cover 30 feet with two putts. After over
shooting the first attempt, he pulled out
his long putter and sunk the winning putt.
"It was the best golf experience of my
life," Miller said. "What made it great was
just having my teammates there to cele
brate it with."
As a child, Zack was a three-sport ath
lete, none of the three golf. Rather, he fo
cused on baseball, football and basket
ball.
"Though I love baseball, it was a sort
of blessing that 1 was never on a good
team." Miller joked. "It turned me away
from the sport and opened me up to golf."
Miller's grandfather was the first to in
troduce him to golf, when he was just
seven years old. His grandfather remains
his biggest fan.
"My family tells me that I am a
younger version of him," Miller said.
Miller has received an overwhelming
amount of family support throughout his
career. In high school, his parents trans
ported him to tournaments all over the
world, including in Japan and Scotland,
leading to his inevitable recruitment to
Stanford. His parents have been extreme
ly supportive in his decision to follow golf.
"At the end of my junior year, I had to
figure out which internship or job I was
going to pursue for the summer," Miller
said. "In the end, I realized that I didn't
want to give up on golf just yet. So I spent
all summer going to tournaments and get
ting the best help possible to improve my
game for senior year."
Miller has had a fantastic fall season
thus far in 2006. He has won two tourna
ments — a tie for first at the Gopher Invi
tational and an individual win at the Pres
tige — and has compiled a 72.7 stroke av
erage.
"So far it's been a great year," Miller
said. "Up to this point we've been really
successful. If we can end it with a win, it'll
be one of the best falls we could have
asked for. It's nice to be a senior golfer on
a team that is competitive and that can do
really big things this year."
Though Miller has big plans, he keeps
things in perspective and stays humble.
"To deal with the pressure. I just re
member that at the end of the day,
whether I make this putt or not, my life
isn't going to change that much," Miller
said. "I'm going to hang out with my
roommate or talk to friends. At the match,
sometimes it feels like do or die, but life
goes on after I walk off of the course."
