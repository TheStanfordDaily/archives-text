## IRS rules in favor of University Donors could benefit from higher interest rates that the MEP offers 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a three-year battle, the Internal
Revenue Service (I RS) ruled this week to
allow Stanford donors to invest charitable
trusts directly into the Stanford Merged
Endowment Pool (MEP) for the first
time. This new management structure
may be a win-win situation for both par
ties, as the MEP historically boasts a high
er return interest rate than the limited in
vestment options previously available.
Stanford joins Harvard as the only
universities granted this provision by the
IRS.
"The I RS gave permission to Harvard
almost three years ago, and Stanford ap
plied right away," said Chris Yates, direc
tor of planned giving at Stanford. "There
were some issues raised after the Har
vard ruling that caused them to hold up
making any more decisions of this na
ture. Stanford and our tax council
worked with them over the last three
years to make them feel comfortable,
and apparently they got comfortable."
Currently the MEP produces about
five percent more annual interest than
other trust investment programs. By al
lowing certain charitable trusts to be in
vested directly into this endowment
pool, both Stanford and donors may be
able to enjoy increased overall returns.
Stanford will reap benefits of the trust
funds, while donors will receive higher
interest.
"Our hope is that higher ME:P returns
will produce higher beneficiary pay
ments for our donors and also in
crease the amount of the eventual dis
tribution of the trust to Stanford."
Yates said.
What this change means is that
donors must transfer their trust au
thority to the Univeristy. In return, the
donors will receive an annual income
of about 5 percent of the trusts value
for their lifetimes. Upon donors'
deaths, the remaining funds will be
distributed to Stanford for its use.
"In the short run. this will not af
fect Stanford's endowment, but over
the longer term as these special trusts
terminate, more dollars will be added
to Stanford's endowment than other
wise be the case if the investments do
well," said Howie Pearson, director of
principal gifts at Stanford.
According to Yates, the new provi
sion holds many long-term perks for
the University.
"This helps to increase gifts to the
University from potential donors who
are interested in supporting Stanford
by means of a charitable remainder
trust." said Yates. The higher invest
ment returns of the MEP are likely to
attract more benefactors, he added.
Pearson said he hopes the decision
will encourage further contributions
from those connected to Stanford.
"We hope that more alumni and
friends of Stanford will be interested
in establishing charitable remainder
trusts now that the wonderful oppor
tunity of receiving endowment invest
ment returns are open to these trusts,"
Pearson said
The ruling is expected to produce
increased funding for all areas of the
Stanford community.
"It will result in increased re
sources for all sorts of areas that can
impact students, including financial
aid, athletics, overseas studies, re
search opportunities and new or ren
ovated facilities," Yates said. "Howev
er, this effect will not be felt immedi
ately â€” it is a long-run thing."
Yates said he expected many uni
versities to join the program over the
next couple of years.
"I anticipate that after our ruling,
a number of universities have ap
plied for this," Yates said. "And 1 be
lieve that most will receive the same
ruling."
