## Off to the mats of Avalon Captains mirror diversity of experience on Cardinal squad 
### BY DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
This weekend, the Cardinal wrestling squad
will go on the road to Edinboro. Penn.. for the
Avalon Duals. At the meet, the Cardinal will
face Edinboro, Mercyhurst and Maryland to
open the season's competition.
Stanford coach Kerry McCoy is hopeful that
the event will be a good indicator of just how far
his team has come.
"We want to go out there and have a good
performance — we want to see our guys wrestle
hard." McCoy said. "Hut Edinboro has four or
five guys ranked nationally, so it will be a really
good opportunity to see how our guys match up.
It's just a step to get that big early trip going all
the way across the country and see what our
guys can do in those circumstances with three
matches in one day. I'm really excited about the
trip and I think we'll do well."
Coach McCoy also commented on the new
captains who will lead his squad in competi
tion this year. Of the three, only junior Tanner
Gardner, wrestling at 125 pounds, served in
the same capacity last year. He and fellow
captain redshirt sophomore Jared Boyer,

wrestling at 197 pounds, represent the team's
young core of returning sophomores and jun
iors— sophomore Luke Feist and juniors
Josh Zupancic and Scott Loescher are all
back to compete this season.
"Tanner is one of the most successful
wrestlers on the team, so that's what he brings —
his success and his fire," McCoy said. "He's one
of the hardest working people I've ever seen.
And Jared Boyer is a big guy, really commands
respect, so everyone on the team really looks to
Jared for leadership and guidance."
The team's third captain, fifth year senior
Brian Perry, defeated Loescher in the annual
Wrestle-Offs last Saturday. McCoy praised the
dedication to the program Perry showed in his
decision to return for the season.
"[Perry] could have graduated last year in
four years,gone out and got a job and be making
a lot of money right now," McCoy said. "But in
stead he decided to put himself in a little bit of a
financial backup — he had to work all spring
quarter and all summer — so he could come
back and get his fifth year of competition. And
that level of commitment and that dedication re
ally shows and helps the team.
"So now you've got a pretty wide spectrum,"
McCoy continued."Big guys, middle guys, lower
weights; a sophomore, a junior and a fifth-year
senior — we pretty much cover all our bases
with our captains and it's great to have that kind
of variety."
