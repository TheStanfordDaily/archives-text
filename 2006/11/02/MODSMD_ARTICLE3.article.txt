The Asian man stands awestruck as a
white man snags the lead role for "Miss
Saigon." Quite infuriated and embar
rassed, he wonders how an Asian role
could be assigned as such.
This scenario is precisely what will
happen in David I lenry liwang's upcom
ing play about ethnicity, "Yellow Face,"
which will premiere in April 2(X)7 at the
Mark Taper Forum. Stanford students
will get an early peek in February, howev
er, as Hwang and his staff have been se
lected as the next invitees to the Stan
ford's Public Theater Residency Pro
gram.
Hwang is the second artist to be se
lected for the residency since its debut in
February 2006. Most notable for "M. But
terfly"— which earned him the title of
the first Asian American to win the Tony
award — J Iwang is a Stanford alum and a
rising giant in contemporary American
theater.
The residency will host I Iwang,Public
Theater Artistic Director Oskar Eustis,
and the rest of the crew on campus for
