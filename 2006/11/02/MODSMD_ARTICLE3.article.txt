## Hwang tapped as next Public Theater Resident 
### ARAM HUR DESK EDITOR 
The Asian man stands awestruck as a
white man snags the lead role for "Miss
Saigon." Quite infuriated and embar
rassed, he wonders how an Asian role
could be assigned as such.
This scenario is precisely what will
happen in David I lenry liwang's upcom
ing play about ethnicity, "Yellow Face,"
which will premiere in April 2(X)7 at the
Mark Taper Forum. Stanford students
will get an early peek in February, howev
er, as Hwang and his staff have been se
lected as the next invitees to the Stan
ford's Public Theater Residency Pro
gram.
Hwang is the second artist to be se
lected for the residency since its debut in
February 2006. Most notable for "M. But
terfly"— which earned him the title of
the first Asian American to win the Tony
award — J Iwang is a Stanford alum and a
rising giant in contemporary American
theater.
The residency will host I Iwang,Public
Theater Artistic Director Oskar Eustis,
and the rest of the crew on campus for
approximately ten days, beginning Feb
ruary Bth. During his stay, 1 Iwang will be
involved both in coursework and extra
curricular activities, workshopping his
play with students.joining student events
and forums and holding a closing staged
reading.
The program comes as part of sev
eral arts initiatives launched by the
Stanford Institute for Creative Arts
(SICA) and the Stanford Arts Initia
tive. Other programs, like the Institute
for Diversity and the Arts, the visiting
professorship of Stan Lai in the
Drama Department and the Music
Department's Pan-Asian Music Festi
val. also fall under SICA's umbrella.
The goal of all of these programs is
to enhance the presence of art on
campus and extend what President
Hennessy calls an "arts way of think
ing" to a broad range of concentra
tions.
"The goal is highlighting the sorts
of virtues that we associate with the
arts — emphasis on imagination, cre
ativity. forms of self-expression and
critical thinking — not only within
arts, but in all other fields on campus."
said Bryan Wolf, the Jeanette and
William Hayden Jones Professor in
American Art and Culture and co-di
rector of SICA and the Stanford Arts
Initiative.
"By drawing from Stanford's
strengths in the arts, technology and
science, our unique residential educa
tion program and our geopolitical lo
cation on the Pacific Rim will help us
make the arts impact every aspect of
student life," added associate profes
sor of music Jonathan Berger, fellow

director of the two programs.
The residency's unique partner
ship between Stanford and the Public
Theater of New York is a win-win sit
uation for both parties. While Stan
ford has insufficient funds and re
sources to become a world-class art in
stitution on its own. it can now bring
first-rate resources to its campus. For
the Public Theater, having a West
coast base increases their range of ac
tivity. The theater is particularly
renowned for its Shakespeare in the
Park series that it hosts in Central
Park, New York.
"There are important overlaps in
our missions between the drama de
partment at Stanford and the Public
Theater," Wolf said. "One of them is a
deep concern to present and promote
contemporary American voices in
theater."
Indeed. Hwang is a leading con
temporary artist, but Wolf also cites
Hwang's compatibility and potential
for contribution to the Stanford com
munity as the overriding criterion for
making the choice.
"The play deals with questions of
how we view race and ethnicity today
in society and there are so many seg
ments within Stanford that are inter
ested in this question," Wolf said.
"Also, the play is about the business of
how plays get mounted and produced.
So in that way. we're also speaking to
the Graduate School of Business."
Despite the broad applications of
"Yellow Face," a few students have ex
pressed concern that the subject mat
ter of beina Asian American could be

too narrow.
"I'm not Asian, so I don't know
how I could relate to what the play is
talking about," said a sophomore who
wished to remain anonymous.
Professors and leaders involved
with the project, however, expressed
disdain at such thinking.
"The play uses the experience of
C 'hinese Americans to open up discus
sion on cross-cultural experiences to
people outside that group "said I larry
Elam. Drama Department chair and
director of the Institute for Diversity
and the Arts. "That's too bad. that's
their loss." he added, regarding about
people who would not partake in the
program because of its focus.
"Ethnicity isn't confined to per
sons of color," agreed Wolf. "I think
the larger questions [Hwang] raises
will address how we think about eth
nicity. how it effects our daily deci
sions. These are questions everybody
needs to address."
In light of President Hennessy's
recent announcement ofThe Stanford
Challenge and its emphasis on the cre
ative arts, the residency is not only
timely but a necessary' step in improv
ing the quality of university educa
tion.
"Education from now will go be
yond learning formulas; it will be
about thinking out of the box," said
Wolf."lt will be about finding new an
swers to old problems."
To Wolf, the role of arts in this shift
was undoubtedly clear.
"Art teaches not the answers, but
how to think."
