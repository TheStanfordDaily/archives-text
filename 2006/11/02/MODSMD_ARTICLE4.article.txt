### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the USC hand strikes up another rousing rendition
of "Fight On" at halftime. don't look to the Stanford Band for
a counter-punch: just like the Arizona game two weeks ago.
the embattled Band will he relegated to the Red Zone and
only allowed on the field to perform the National Anthem he
fore kickoff.
"Obviously, we're disappointed." said Band Public Rela
tions Coordinator Chris Holt, a co-terminal student in 1 Eng
lish. "We've behaved and cooperated with all of the adminis
tration's demands, but so far we are still not allowed to prop
erly serve the Stanford community. We hoped the administra
tion would respect the Geneva Convention, which mandates
that torturous field shows administered by stiff marching
bands must be counter-balanced by mirthful fun."
Band President Adam Cohen, a senior, said the lack of a
field show this weekend was particularly painful given the his
torical animosity between the USC and Stanford bands.
"It stinks," he said." 1 can imagine they are very, very happy
that their band gets to perform in our stadium and we do not.
1 just hope enough Stanford fans come out that we still have
home-field advantage.
Many students, like junior kat Kershner, expressed dismay
that the Band would not be out on the field.
"The Band is a Stanford tradition," said Kershner. who
serves as the Financial Chair of the Axe Committee. "Yes.

they're notorious, but they're also uniquely ours. 1 think it's
unreasonable that the Band as a whole is being held account
able for the irresponsibility of individual members."
Holt noted that due to the football team's disappointing
season, the Band's uplifting presence must be missed even
much more.
"The administration will gradually allow us to be once
again the spirit of the University, but they have not set a date
for when we shall return to doing field shows," I lolt said. "We
imagine this punishment comes because poorly behaved
marching bands like Wisconsin's are giving the rest of us mu
sicians a bad name."
When placing the Band on indefinite provisional status fol
lowing confirmation that Band members had vandalized their
former Band Shak. Vice Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman created the Band Reinstatement Committee,
which began meeting weekly in early October. The committee
is chaired by Associate Dean of Students Chris Griffith and
ASSU Vice President Lauren Graham, a co-terminal student
in Sociology; it is composed of staff, a GSC representative, the
Band music director, a Band alumnus and three current Band
members.
"To date, the committee has focused on the current struc
ture of the Band and is in the process of identifying crucial
topics of concern that need to be addressed." Griffith said.
" ITic committee's work will extend into winter quarter and
will result in recommendations to Vice Provost Boardman."
Griffith is currently working with Stanford Athletics to

prepare for the Bands participation in Big Game Week
events.
"The Band," Griffith said, "will perform at some Stan
ford/Cal joint activities in San Francisco and at on-campus Big
Game activities," Griffith said.
