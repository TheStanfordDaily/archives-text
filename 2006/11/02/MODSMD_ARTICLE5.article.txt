## For Europe, a call to unite 
### MIKE DING 
In the talk "Europe Now: Integration, S
ociety, and Islam in a New Europe" yesterday,
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a European Parlia
ment member, argued for the need to tran
scend cultural differences of separate na
tion-states in the European Union in order
to survive in the global era.
"Europe since the end of World War II
has been one of renewal," said Cohn-Bendit,
co-president at the Greens/Free European
Alliance Group. "After the war ended, peo
ple felt like they could have a fresh start, an
other try at maintaining a world free of in
roads on human rights."
In order to maintain that fresh start,
Cohn-Bendit argued that a true homoge

nization of nation-states under the Euro
pean Union must take place, a realization
that stems from the memory of the Yugosla
vian crisis in 1989. The biggest impediment
to accomplishing this unity, however, is the
lack of an EIJ constitution.
"The constitution for the European
Union is difficult to draft, because it de
mands compromise between constitutions
of separate European nations that have very
different constitutions," he said. "The French
constitution, for example, is one that arose
out of the energy and disorder of the French
Revolution, whereas the post-WWII Ger
man and Spanish constitutions both served
as responses to Hitler and Franco's fascist
states.
"The British." he joked, "have no consti

tut ion.
The most recent attempt at a European
constitution failed when an insufficient
number of EU states accepted it.
"Europeans voted no for the most re
cently proposed constitution because they
distrust the government and fear they will
lose certain human rights should the consti
tution be ratified." he said.
Though Cohn-Bendit criticized the pro
posed constitution as "horrible." he also said
it has potential for promise.
"Parts of the constitution are wonderful,"
lie said regarding certain passages on indi
vidual rights. "It is as if in these areas of the
constitution, Europe is finally putting up an

answer to its collective history."
In order to truly become collec
tive, however, Cohn-Bendit argued
for amendments to the constitution
ratification process. The current reg
ulation requires all 25 EU states to
approve. Instead, he proposed a
method where only 60 percent of
states are required.
The reasoning behind this pro
posal is that a unanimous decision is
almost impossible. Instead, dissent

ing countries should be given the
choice to remain in or leave the El/,
allowing the remaining members to
solidify their unity.
The need for a more unified Eu
rope. Cohn-Bendit claimed, is neces
sary to face various global problems.
On the one hand, uniting can pre
vent a possible environmental catas
trophe at the hands of the green
house effect.
"Switzerland has cleaned up its
factories, its air. but it is only one
country," he said. "Its improvement
makes little difference in the grand
scheme of things."
Decreased release of carbon
dioxide from industrial processes

over the entire continent of Europe,
however, would have a much more
significant effect.

constitutional ideals, Cohn-Bendit
said. He argued that the constitution
— which allows for personal free
dom of belief and does not entorce
one faithover any other— would
serve as the perfect counterexample
to religious fanaticism.
"Problems today can no longer
be solved by individual nation
states," he said. "Europe needs to
begin to deal with global problems
on a global level."
