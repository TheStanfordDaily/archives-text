## For Europe, a call to unite 
### MIKE DING 
In the talk "Europe Now: Integration, S
ociety, and Islam in a New Europe" yesterday,
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a European Parlia
ment member, argued for the need to tran
scend cultural differences of separate na
tion-states in the European Union in order
to survive in the global era.
"Europe since the end of World War II
has been one of renewal," said Cohn-Bendit,
co-president at the Greens/Free European
Alliance Group. "After the war ended, peo

Revolution, whereas the post-WWII Ger
man and Spanish constitutions both served
as responses to Hitler and Franco's fascist
states.
"The British." he joked, "have no consti

constitution failed when an insufficient
number of EU states accepted it.
"Europeans voted no for the most re
cently proposed constitution because they
distrust the government and fear they will
lose certain human rights should the consti
tution be ratified." he said.
Though Cohn-Bendit criticized the pro
posed constitution as "horrible." he also said
it has potential for promise.
"Parts of the constitution are wonderful,"
lie said regarding certain passages on indi

constitution, Europe is finally putting up an
