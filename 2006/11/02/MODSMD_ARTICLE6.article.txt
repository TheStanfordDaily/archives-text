## Roosevelt shifts to local policy More realistic policymaking opportunities expected 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford chapter fellows from The Roo
sevelt Institution, the nation's first student-run
think tank, are steering away from their previ
ous national policy making focus to team up
with Bay Area legislators to make headway at
the local level.
Ilie reason for this shift, organizers say lies
in the institution's dedication to making stu
dent-initiated policy waves —a much more
attainable goal at the local level, where net
working opportunities with officials are more
accessible.
To facilitate interaction between students
and local officials in the Bay Area. Roosevelt
leaders are in the process of establishing a pol
icy discourse forum where both parties will col
laborate on producing, polishing and dissemi
nating ideas to key policymakers. Chapter
President Eric Mitzenmacher, a junior, said
that fellows have already met with several local
officials, including Redwood City Mayor Bar
bara Pierce and Palo Alto City Councilmem
ber Peter Drekmeyer.
Roosevelt fellows will also work to lubri
cate local policymaking machinery by provid
ing legislators with research for their ideas,
added Mitzenmacher.
"Research infrastructures often lag behind
the material progress being made." he said.
"This leaves a gap that can be filled by stu
dents."
All it takes is a well-reasoned pitch from
the students and policy experts are on board
with the concept.said senior Leslie Flnger.pol
icv coordinator for the think tank.
"Policymakers realize that Stanford stu
dents — and university students in general —
have invaluable resources and have the ability
to do meticulous, original research," she said.
"They know that we are capable, committed
and passionate about policy. Combine that
passion with resources, and students can come
up with great policy ideas.They usual
ly are as excited about Roosevelt as
we are."
The organization is currently pair
ing local officials with one of the 12
policy centers whose interests best
align with their own. These centers
cover a broad spectrum of policy con
cerns, which range from environmen
tal issues to clean politics and voting
rights.
Junior Shivan Sarin, director for
the center on international security,
lauded the organization's forum

model for policy discourse provided
to students.
"By inviting policymakers and
high-name professors to advise us on
our policies, they get a good look at
what we are, and they guide us to a
correct goal," he said. "They also
make a connection to the policy, which
opens numerous channels for the pol
icy and the center in the future."
Mitzenmacher said that fellows
look forward to navigating the com
plexities of local policymaking, which
often faces unique federal constraints.
"Working within fairly strict
boundaries while still having to ad
dress some basic problems makes
local policymaking an exciting chal
lenge for students who want to make a
real impact." he said.

Although Roosevelt has yet to
achieve success at the local level. Fin
ger is optimistic the strategy will even
tually bear fruit. She cited 2006 gradu
ates Laura McCloskey and Maria
Ocampo's Op-Ed piece on Califor
nia's high school exit exam, which ap
peared last spring in the San Francisco
Chronicle, as an example of the im
pact Roosevelt fellows can make on
Bay Area discourse.
"We are a very new organization."
she added. "We've only been around
since winter 2004, and we're working
right now on establishing the frame
work through which we can have
working relationships and policy suc
cess with local policy makers. These
relationships will play out in the
course of the year."
