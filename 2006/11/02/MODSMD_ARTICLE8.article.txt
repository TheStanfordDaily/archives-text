## Editorial Board Yes on Prop. 86

If passed. Proposition 86 will raise the ex
cise tax on tobacco by $2.60 per pack of
cigarettes, nearly a 300 percent increase.
This will, in turn, raise the average price of a
pack of cigarettes in California to $6.55 —
the highest average in the country — and
turn the pack-a-day habit into a $2,400 year
ly expense. Too extreme? Perhaps. But a
glance at the country's current statistics on
smoking suggests that such extreme meas

California, 273,000 high school students
smoke one or more cigarettes daily, and
50,000 more become regulars every year.
Proposition 86, sponsored by the Coali
tion for a 1 lealthy California, will help allevi
ate many of these problems. Studies have
shown that raising the price of cigarettes is
both the best way to keep them out of the
hands of minors and an effective incentive for
adults to quit. According to projections, the

In contrast, tobacco companies are in
creasing their influence over new and current
smokers. On the one hand, money spent on
advertising is enormous. The California De
partment of Health estimates that the amount
spent on big tobacco marketing in California
is upwards of $920 million a year. On the other
hand, smoking is getting more addictive. The
Massachusetts Department of Health found
that cigarettes deliver on average about 10
percent more nicotine to a smoker's lungs
than they did just eight years ago.

Ilie overarching goals of this proposi
tion are clearly commendable. But the
measure is by no means perfect. Opponents
of the proposition, including big tobacco
companies, have argued that Prop 86 would
exempt hospitals from antitrust laws and
allow them to recklessly overcharge tax
payers for uninsured patients. But the
measure does not exempt hospitals from
antitrust laws directly. Rather, it allows local
governments to exempt hospitals from an

measure would only affect emergency and
