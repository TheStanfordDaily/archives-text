## Editorial Board Yes on Prop. 86 
### 
If passed. Proposition 86 will raise the ex
cise tax on tobacco by $2.60 per pack of
cigarettes, nearly a 300 percent increase.
This will, in turn, raise the average price of a
pack of cigarettes in California to $6.55 —
the highest average in the country — and
turn the pack-a-day habit into a $2,400 year
ly expense. Too extreme? Perhaps. But a
glance at the country's current statistics on
smoking suggests that such extreme meas

California, 273,000 high school students
smoke one or more cigarettes daily, and
50,000 more become regulars every year.
Proposition 86, sponsored by the Coali
tion for a 1 lealthy California, will help allevi
ate many of these problems. Studies have
shown that raising the price of cigarettes is
both the best way to keep them out of the
hands of minors and an effective incentive for
adults to quit. According to projections, the

often backfire or fail to target important seg

In contrast, tobacco companies are in
creasing their influence over new and current
smokers. On the one hand, money spent on
advertising is enormous. The California De
partment of Health estimates that the amount
spent on big tobacco marketing in California
is upwards of $920 million a year. On the other
hand, smoking is getting more addictive. The
Massachusetts Department of Health found
that cigarettes deliver on average about 10
percent more nicotine to a smoker's lungs
than they did just eight years ago.
While the number of smokers is still de

the estimated $2.27 billion dollars of

revenue generated by the proposed tax
would go toward improving California's
health care system: health insurance for
needy children, emergency services for the
uninsured, nursing education, tobacco pre
vention programs and disease research.
Ilie overarching goals of this proposi
tion are clearly commendable. But the
measure is by no means perfect. Opponents
of the proposition, including big tobacco
companies, have argued that Prop 86 would
exempt hospitals from antitrust laws and
allow them to recklessly overcharge tax
payers for uninsured patients. But the
measure does not exempt hospitals from
antitrust laws directly. Rather, it allows local
governments to exempt hospitals from an
titrust laws. Furthermore, the antitrust
measure would only affect emergency and

specialty services, not all hospital
services.
Others argue that if declining rev
enues from tobacco sales fail to
match the proposition's spending
mandate. Prop K6 would ultimately
contribute to a state deficit. While
spending mandates may indeed ex
ceed revenues and the pilot costs of
new programs could prove steep, the
state can potentially save billions
from reduced health care costs over
the long run because smoking-relat
ed health problems will presumably
decrease. It is difficult to see whether
the state will come out ahead, but the
overwhelming positive health conse
quences make Prop Kb a risk worth
taking.
A final objection against the
proposition is that such a significant
tax hike on cigarettes constitutes an
arbitrary restriction on consumer
freedom and will only contribute to
the growth of underground tobacco
trafficking. Because the tax punishes
not only tobacco companies,but also
tobacco addicts, some argue that

Prop 86 is burdening smokers with
more than their share of responsibil
ity. The question becomes whether
such a burden can be considered
just.
But if there is any justifiable eco
nomic restraint on a common con
sumer product, it is a cigarette tax.
Tax revenues from the proposition

would be a boon to the health care
system and the uninsured, while the
increase in cigarette prices would
significantly reduce the number of
smokers. Some people would quit
and many more would never start,
reducing the social cost of smoking
in addition to mortality rates.
Although this high tax incidental

ly targets those who already smoke,
it is not a good enough reason to re
ject all of its potential benefits.
'ITiis tax will help clamp down on
an industry that targets an addictive,
deadly product at minors who are
not yet mature enough to make a
truly rational choice about smoking.
Ultimately, Prop 86 will save lives
and reduce the burden placed on
California taxpayers by medical is
sues resulting from smoking.
