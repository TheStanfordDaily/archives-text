My fears were somewhat confirmed
when I got to my homestay apartment. To
get inside, you need to navigate six separate
doors with a combined total of seven locks.
My keychain is insured for ten million
rubles (approximately $20). Personally, I

your average Ivan was trying to scrape to

of the proletariat.

Coming from a small town in the
southwest. I assumed Moscow would
he filled with big-city slicksters, char
latans and general ne'er-do-wells. Fortu
nately, my hometown is a few miles from
Las Vegas, so I figured Moscow would feel
pretty much like home.
My fears were somewhat confirmed
when I got to my homestay apartment. To
get inside, you need to navigate six separate
doors with a combined total of seven locks.
My keychain is insured for ten million
rubles (approximately $20). Personally, I
think this is why communism failed: While
your average Ivan was trying to scrape to
gether a few kopecks to buy kasha, lock
smiths were feasting like kings on the blood
of the proletariat.
With apartment security tighter than
Mariah Carey's latest wardrobe miscalcula
tion, I obviously had good reason to be ter
rified. My first few days were a haze of para
noia. 1 freaked out about everything: people
pushing me in front of the subway, snipers.

Muscovites don't just extend heightened
security measures to themselves, though.
They're also moderately OCD in protecting

poli sci class we learned that Rus
sians were slow to grasp the concept
of private property — but once they

Every night I am gently lulled to
sleep by a symphony of car alarms
more cacophonous than Paris
Hilton's debut album. Shop windows
are guarded by two or three layers of
bars and a pony-tailed thug named
Dima. Once when 1 touched a book
on sale at an outdoor kiosk, the
owner threw a lit cigarette at my
face.
One of the most surreal displays
of this Uncle Pennybags (that pervy
looking guy on the Monopoly box)
mindset is what I affectionately call
the Watermelon Gulags. On every
street there are at least two or three
large cages, filled with literally hun
dreds of watermelons. Just in case
the USSR reunites and holds a sum
mer block party — with mandatory
second helpings. livery door to these
outdoor melon emporiums sports
five or six padlocks. At least in the
German program the watermelons
get visitation rights with the can
taloupes.
But these security measures have
nothing on the most tinhtlv guarded

possessions in all of Russia. No. it's
not the chambers full of retina-sear
ing diamonds in the Kremlin
peasants were trading sacks of dia
monds for hamburger buns during
the Russian Civil War. By far the
most guarded commodity in Russia
is toilet paper. Sure, in the renowned
Pushkin Art Gallery, you can get
close enough to wipe your greasy
mitts on a Rembrandt, but if you're
going to stop by the restroom, be
sure to bring a pack of Kleenex.
