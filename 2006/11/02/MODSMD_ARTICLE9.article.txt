# Yo, the KGB ain't got nothing on me

Coming from a small town in the
southwest. I assumed Moscow would
he filled with big-city slicksters, char
latans and general ne'er-do-wells. Fortu
nately, my hometown is a few miles from
Las Vegas, so I figured Moscow would feel
pretty much like home.
My fears were somewhat confirmed
when I got to my homestay apartment. To
get inside, you need to navigate six separate
doors with a combined total of seven locks.
My keychain is insured for ten million
rubles (approximately $20). Personally, I
think this is why communism failed: While
your average Ivan was trying to scrape to
gether a few kopecks to buy kasha, lock
smiths were feasting like kings on the blood
of the proletariat.
With apartment security tighter than
Mariah Carey's latest wardrobe miscalcula
tion, I obviously had good reason to be ter
rified. My first few days were a haze of para
noia. 1 freaked out about everything: people
pushing me in front of the subway, snipers.

rabid dogs, poison darts, angry babushki
with bricks in their shopping bags.The num
ber of times 1 have threateningly bran
dished an umbrella —in quite a swash
buckling manner, might I add — at a suspi
cious-looking trashcan cannot be counted
on one hand. The other hand, of course, is in
my pocket making sure no one has stolen
my wallet, passport or holy Metro card.
Muscovites don't just extend heightened
security measures to themselves, though.
They're also moderately OCD in protecting
