## Student seeks funds for Nigerian hospital GEANCO to build health center for poor 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE 
At a time when many graduate stu
dents are studying to become doctors,
third-year law student Afram Onye
ma is working to build a hospital.
"I have never, never doubted that
we will build the best hospital in sub-
Saharan Africa that is open to the
very sick and the very poor," Onye
ma said.
The hospital has been a long-time
dream for the law student's family.
Onyema's father. Dr. Godwin Onye
ma,emigrated from Nigeria to Amer
ica in 1974 for his medical residency
but never forgot his home country.
"He always planned to go back
and use his skills to serve his commu
nity and his family," Onyema said of
his father.
In 2005, the elder Onyema organ
ized the non-profit GEANCO Foun
dation. Named from a collection of
family initials, the organization is
dedicated to improving health condi
tions and medical services in Nigeria.
The foundation's preliminary
focus is to oversee and ensure the
planning and construction of Augus
tine Memorial Hospital, named for
Onyema's late grandfather, in
Anambra, Nigeria.
To this end, the GEANCO Foun
dation officially commenced its
fundraising campaign this summer
with a series of benefits held in major
cities around the United States, in
cluding Palo Alto. Later this month,
members of the organization will
travel to Nigeria to host a similar
benefit there.
A total of 80 law and business stu
dents. local doctors, attorneys, pro
fessors and business executives at
tended the Palo Alto event held at
the Sheraton on Sat., Oct. 21.
GEANCO advisory board mem
bers hailed the event as a success, but

tempered their optimism with the
knowledge that the organization's
goals cannot be met overnight.
"This is a long process — to gen
erate awareness of GEANCO and to
raise funds — and the Palo Alto
event was an important first step in
getting people in this area on board,"
said law student and GEANCO ad
visory board member Patrick Heller.
"1 think that a lot of people were
exposed for the first time to the seri
ousness facing specific communities in
West Africa, and a clear way they can
help," added Jake Kraft, another advi
sory board member and law student.
The need for a hospital in the area
is unequivocal. According to the
World Health Organization, Nigeria
is one of the 20 poorest countries in
the world. Consequently, many Nige
rians cannot afford to pay for their
own healthcare. Additionally, the
country is now home to the highest
number of HIV/AIDS-infected
adults in West Africa.
Currently, GEANCO has raised
$80,000, but Onyema and others
hope to reach $S(X),(XX) by the end of
the year.
"This will allow us to conduct the
feasibility studies and needs assess
ments that are necessary before the
hospital can be built," Onyema ex
plained.
He estimates that the construc
tion and maintenance of the hospital
will cost $22 million, with an addi
tional $2 million per year to run the
facilities and cover the costs of pa
tients who cannot pay for their care.
"Since I've been here at Stanford
Law, I've spent every day, literally
every day, doing something for the
foundation," Onyema said. "It is what
gets me up in the morning and keeps
me joyfully motivated during the day."
Initially, finding sponsors proved
to be difficult.
"Back then our business plan was
little more than a few paragraphs,
long on passion and short on details,"
Onyema said.
I"hc organization has also had to
combat media coverage of scandals
and frauds associated with the
Nigerian government. However.
Onyema said he is proud of the rep
utation GEANCO has created.
"We knew that we had to build
an organization strong enough and
honest enough to fight both disease
and doubt," he said.
To that end, GEANCO has
sought to ensure fiscal responsibility
by working with the accounting
partnership Ernst & Young and the
law firm Mayer, Brown, Rowe, and
Maw. Both firms are working pro
bono for the nonprofit.
Despite the setbacks associated
with building an organization from
the ground up, Onyema has never
once doubted that his and his fa
ther's dream would become a reali
ty.
"The healthcare crisis in Africa is
the great need of our time," Onyema
said, "but there is power enough
here at Stanford to help meet that
need, if only all hands and hearts
join in the effort."
