## Unlike IHUM, Freshman 15 may stick around Students blame dining halls, lack of exercise 
### HEATHER HEISTAND 
With rosy-faced first-years loading
up on Stern Dining waffles and Lake
side cheese sticks, the "freshman 15" is
übiquitous, but a recent study suggests
that it's not exactly what we thought.
The good news is that the "freshman
15" may be more fiction than fact. The
bad news is that the danger of weight
gain is not just a freshman phenomenon.
According to a recent study by
Brown University Medical School, the
"freshman 15"is more like a "five" for fe
male undergraduates and a "seven" for
males. However, the study of undergrad
uates at Brown and Purdue also found
that students continued to gain an addi
tional two to three pounds in their soph
omore years, raising concerns that the
trend will continue past graduation and
lead to higher obesity rates later in life.
While a similar study has yet to be
conducted at Stanford,students around

campus expressed contrasting views.
"The 'freshman 15' definitely does
n't happen to everyone," said freshman
Cory Quinn. "I've actually lost four
pounds," he said before going into his
yogalates class in the Arrillaga Sports
Center."But [Stanford] dining definite
ly can contribute to weight gain; I've
seen it happen and heard plenty of peo
ple express their displeasure about it."
Freshman Isaias Espinoza, another
Stern diner, voiced similar sentiments.
"Some of my friends have said
they've gained 10 pounds, but I'm not
too worried about it." But, he was
quick to point out that "some people
are losing weight too."
Sophomore Josephine Valenzuela
lamented her 15- pound gain last year,
though she has since managed to lose
almost all of it.
"It's pretty depressing, especially
here when everyone here is so thin!"
she said. "Stanford sets you up for the
•freshman 15' because you're away
from home and your friends and fami
ly, but you have FroYo — sweet deli-
