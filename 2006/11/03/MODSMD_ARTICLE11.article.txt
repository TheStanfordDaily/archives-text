## Unlike IHUM, Freshman 15 may stick around Students blame dining halls, lack of exercise 
### HEATHER HEISTAND 
With rosy-faced first-years loading
up on Stern Dining waffles and Lake
side cheese sticks, the "freshman 15" is
übiquitous, but a recent study suggests
that it's not exactly what we thought.
The good news is that the "freshman
15" may be more fiction than fact. The
bad news is that the danger of weight
gain is not just a freshman phenomenon.
According to a recent study by
Brown University Medical School, the
"freshman 15"is more like a "five" for fe
male undergraduates and a "seven" for
males. However, the study of undergrad
uates at Brown and Purdue also found
that students continued to gain an addi
tional two to three pounds in their soph
omore years, raising concerns that the
trend will continue past graduation and
lead to higher obesity rates later in life.
While a similar study has yet to be
conducted at Stanford,students around

campus expressed contrasting views.
"The 'freshman 15' definitely does
n't happen to everyone," said freshman
Cory Quinn. "I've actually lost four
pounds," he said before going into his
yogalates class in the Arrillaga Sports
Center."But [Stanford] dining definite
ly can contribute to weight gain; I've
seen it happen and heard plenty of peo
ple express their displeasure about it."
Freshman Isaias Espinoza, another
Stern diner, voiced similar sentiments.
"Some of my friends have said
they've gained 10 pounds, but I'm not
too worried about it." But, he was
quick to point out that "some people
are losing weight too."
Sophomore Josephine Valenzuela
lamented her 15- pound gain last year,
though she has since managed to lose
almost all of it.
"It's pretty depressing, especially
here when everyone here is so thin!"
she said. "Stanford sets you up for the
•freshman 15' because you're away
from home and your friends and fami
ly, but you have FroYo — sweet deli-

cious I'roYo," she sighed. "Hut its a
whole lot easier eating Row house
food."
bellow sophomore Anna Ruby
Waxham-Blackwell added that
weight gain didn't always come in
the form of desserts or I.ate Nite.
"It's not just food, though," she
said. "Part of the reason people gain
the 'freshman 15' is because of alco
hol. 'Ihat, and the fact we stay up so
late that we're up eight hours after
dinner, and it's perfectly natural to
be hungry six hours after eating."

Vivian ( risinan. a nutritionist at
Vaden's 1 lealth Promotion Services,
agreed that students' eating behav
iors and habits — not simply the din
ing hall food — are the major con
tributors to college weight gain.
"It's a myth to think that you can
st ill weigh the same as you did in high
school when you get to college." she
said."Some weight gain is normal for
incoming college students, who at 17
or 18 are not finished maturing."
Yet. while many of the students
('risinan helps are worried fresh
men. a significant number of sopho
mores also show up in her office
around the fifth week of fall quarter
wondering what to do about the
weight they are continuing to gain,
("risinan confirmed that not all

freshmen put on extra poundage.
"In fact, an earlier Penn State
study found that about a third of
their freshman gained weight, while
another third stayed even, and the
final third lost weight," she said.
According to Crisman, weight
gain is more about how you eat than
what you eat. "When they come to
me, I try to focus on eating behaviors,
not just 'numbers,'" she said. She cited
getting less exercise — for those for
merly involved in varsity sports —
late night snacking, social eating, buf
fet style dinning halls and more access
to alcohol as examples of the lifestyle
change that affeet freshmen.
"Make sure you think about what
you're eating," she said, "while
you're eating it."
