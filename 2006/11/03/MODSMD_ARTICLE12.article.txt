## Roberts calls for more family planning Non-profit organizer says education, women's rights key in combating overpopulation 
### CAMILA TAPERNOUX 
Reproductive health advocate Jane Roberts
called for worldwide support for family planning
yesterday in an address at the Law School.The re
tired French teacher and tennis coach has part
nered with Stanford alumnus Lois Abraham to
raise over $3 million in a grassroots effort sup
porting the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA).
Roberts said that limited access to family plan
ning constitutes a threat to the sustainable devel

opment of the world. She argued that acts of dis
crimination towards women such as forced early
marriage and female genital mutilation, only
serve to aggravate an already-critical overpopu
lation epidemic.
With a current population of 6.4 billion peo
ple and a projected 9 billion by 2050. Roberts
warned that humans will be fighting over necessi
ties as basic as water, pointing out that already
one in six people do not have access to the vital
resource. She pointed to family planning as a
means of alleviating threats stemming from over
population.
"When the world takes care of women,
women take care of the world," Roberts said.
ITie UNFPA seeks to address these issues by
educating women, organizing clinics in third
world countries and training doctors. The organi
zation is supported by over 100 countries.

Roberts said, hut the U.S. has withdrawn its fund
ing because of the popular belief that the UNFPA
supports abortion. This belief is unfounded.
Roberts argued.
The end of U.S. support has amounted to $34
million in lost funds. In response. Roberts and
Abraham started the 34 Million Friends cam
paign, asking 34 million Americans to send one
dollar to the UNFPA. Although Roberts said that
the campaign was initially belittled as a "splendid
symbolic protest," 34 Million Friends has already
raised $3.3 million, and donations continue to
flow in at a steady five to ten thousand dollars a
week.
The success of the project has made Roberts
optimistic about the program's chances to im
prove the women's lives.
"All roads lead from women to
social change," she said.
Roberts' impressive background
was an inspiration for Law Students
for Choice President Dorotha M.
Ocker, who met Roberts at a confer
ence in Washington D.C. and conse
quently invited her to speak at Stan
ford.

"I was fascinated and motivated
by a woman who used a grassroots
effort to overcome our govern
ment's deficiencies and help
women all over the globe gain ac
cess to valuable healthcare," Ocker
said.
Law Students for Choice is a stu
dent group that works to raise
awareness of reproductive rights is
sues in both law and public policy. It
often collaborates with many organ
izations such as Stanford Students
for Choice and the Feminist Law
Collective.
