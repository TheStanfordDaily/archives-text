## Editorial Board No on 89 
### 
Proposition 89, an attempt to limit cam
paign donations, is largely funded by
one major benefactor. The California
Nurses Association has spent more than $3
million supporting this proposition, which is
15 times more than any other group's in
volvement for either side. The CNA believes
that until campaign donations by large cor
porations and special interests are limited,
many public-interest efforts like reforming
health care are significantly disadvantaged. It
is interesting that the CNA has turned to
playing the role of the big spending

lobby group to pass the law, and
though their cause is worth-

while, Proposition 89
would not provide a
"clean money" reform to
campaigns. If the proposi
tion passes, legal battles
and attempts by donors to
find holes in the regula
tions will begin, and even if
it worked as planned, it
would not make a worth
while difference.

This June, in Randall v. Sor-

rell the Supreme Court struck

down a Vermont campaign-finance law
6-3, holding to the precedent set in Buckley v.
Valeo which defines donations as the free
speech of candidates and campaign contribu
tors. Justice Breyer wrote about the Vermont
law,"Well-established precedent makes clear
that the expenditure limits violate the First
Amendment...they impose burdens upon
First Amendment interests that are dispro
portionately severe." Proposition 89. through
a small tax increase on businesses and finan
cial institutions will offer public financing to
candidates who voluntarily accept spending
limits, including a possible $25 million to gu
bernatorial candidates. Also included in the
measure are stringent campaign contribution
limits.such as reducing the "total annual con
tributions to political parties for candidate
related expenditures" from $27,900 to $7,500
and contributions to a Political Action Com
mittee (PAC) independent of an official cam
paign from "no limit" to $1 .(XX).

It is likely that if passed, the Supreme
Court will strike down certain provisions if
not the entirety of this legislation as a viola
tion of the first amendment. But let us take
this proposition on its merit. TTie most
prominent rhetoric of Proposition 89's pro
ponents holds that the measure will "clean
up" politics and reduce the sway that

"money has over the political system." The
problem is that recent years have already
seen a swing toward independently wealthy
candidates who finance their own cam-

paigns. and the proposition is only

likely to increase that likelihood.

It promises to give equal fund
ing if all candidates accept

the public financing and
give up to four times this
amount if tine candidate is
running against another
who is privately financed.
But if the privately wealthy
opponent keeps spending,
the candidate who took pub-

lic money is capped, and can
not spend more effectively ru
ining his or her ability to corn-

pete. Even worse, candidates who

choose private funding can still receive
contributions from parties, interest groups
and PACs,just in smaller amounts, meaning
lots of small groups will form without much
overall change in cash flow.
Another issue is charging businesses and
financial institutions with the tax for the
funding.There is a certain irony in oil compa
nies' taxes being increased to fund the cam
paigns which will in turn fund Green Party,
but elections are a public good and benefit
more than private businesses and banks.
Placing the entire burden in these areas is
helpful in garnering the type of mass public
support a referendum needs since individuals
will not feel the tax, but it is still unfair.
The system of campaign finance in the
U.S. clearly needs help, but Proposition 89 is
simply not going to work.There are too many
ways to get around it, and it may be unconsti-
