# Staying the course: Apathy in the bubble
## 
### 
It's November 3. Do you know where
you're voting? In case you've been fully
consumed by life in the Stanford bub
ble for the past six weeks, let this serve as
your reminder: Election Day is four days
away. Now is the time to shake off your ac
cepted Stanford apathy, disprove the
stereotype, and exercise one of your con
stitutional rights.
Ok, I'll step down from my soapbox
(this is, after all, the Daily, not the Stanford
Review). This column is not about who you
should vote for or why you should vote —
the former would be inappropriate for a
column about life at Stanford and the lat
ter would take far more than 800 words to
defend. No, this column is about why Stan
ford students have long been associated
with the ignorant indifference of sandy
headed ostriches. Perhaps it's just in com
parison to our protest-happy friends across
the Bay, but the stereotype begs the ques
tion: are we really apathetic, or are we just
lazy?
I will be the first to admit that my person
al political career was short-lived. Like 95
percent of the Stanford population, I was in
volved with the dog-eat-dog world of high
school Student Body Government. While I
never gave a campaign speech quite as im
pressive as my friend who stood on stage
and drank an entire bottle of soy sauce, I
faired well enough in the popularity contest
to be a class rep. for four years running.This
glorious position earned me the privilege of
decorating the gym before dances, stressing
out about Spirit Week and cleaning up after
every conceivable event held on school
property.
Determined to take my political career
to the next level. I spent the summer be
fore my freshman year "working" for the
California Democratic Party. I had visions
of attending dynamic speeches and partic
ipating in raucous rallies, but 1 spent most
of my time stapling lawn signs and sorting
office supplies in a rented empty store
front on El Camino. (Six years later, the
space has been re-let by another local
campaign; you'd think someone might
have considered the outcome of the previ
ous elections and decided to change the
karma.)
Undaunted by my less-than-world
changing experience, i came to Stanford
armed to the teeth with a pile of voter regis
tration cards. Lazy? Apathetic? Hardly. In
the first week alone, I registered 50 out-of
state voters,campaigned for dorm president
and joined the Stanford Democrats.

But long before Election Day that year,
something happened. For one thing, presid
ing over the social lives of a hundred fresh
men was slightly time-consuming. For an
other, the long pilgrimage from Larkin to
the second floor of Toyon (where the Stan
ford Dems meetings were held) was less
than appealing at 11 p.m. on a Monday night.
Above all. though, I was barely studying, let
alone sleeping. The unregistered voters and
their potential contributions to the political
fate of our country would have to wait.
1 had run smack into the real Stanford
conundrum: too many options, not enough
time. A brief stroll through White Plaza dur
ing the Activities Fair suggests that apathy is
not our problem. The 30-odd tables for
groups dedicated to political and social
change take on all the big ones — AIDS,
poverty, developing nations, global warm
ing, etc. However, alongside RATS, SLAC,
SAAAC.SC'JP and their fellow acronym-ed
groups are hundreds of other time-grub
bing activities. Achieving world peace and
finding a cure for cancer are not exactly
small goals, particularly when they're sand
wiched between rugby practice, Talisman
rehearsal and social dance.
hut if the real problem is how many
balls we're all trying to juggle, then where
does the laziness accusation come from?
Stand in the middle of the Intersection of
Death at 10 a.m. on a Tuesday and anyone
can see we don't suffer from a lack of en
ergy. So if we're willing to pedal at speeds
upwards of a hundred miles per hour when
there's a Humßio lecture on the other
end. why can't we be bothered to read Hie
New York Times or follow the "war" in
Iraq? It's a question of urgency, immediate
return and my old favorite, supply and de
mand.
When the sky is blue nearly every day.it
can be hard to imagine that there's another
world out there, one in which your CS 106
assignment doesn't really matter. More
over, when the midterm counts for a third of
your quarter's grade, doesn't it seem slight-
