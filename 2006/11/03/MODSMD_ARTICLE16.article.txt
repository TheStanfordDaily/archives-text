# The 						history of Greek Life at Stanford
## 
### 
Immediately following opening convoca
tions on October 1. 1891, Fraternity
Rush commenced. Since there were no
existing Greek members to choose new
pledges, the founders of the University took
it upon themselves to initiate the frosh.
ITiey played a drinking game during which
each student had to chug a jigger of whiskey
every time the word "axe" was said during
the "Give 'em the axe!" cheer.
Leland Stanford Sr. liked to think of him
self as a womanizer. However, he couldn't get
a woman to come to his stock farm, as they
say, unless she was heavily sedated with a
"Little Leland" (two parts Everclear, one
part tequila) and was in a room so pitch
black. with music so loud, that she could nei
ther see nor hear him. With these signature
moves in mind, Leland founded Stanford As
sociated Enterprises, or SAE.
President of the University and surfer boy
David Starr Jordan was originally from
Gainesville, New York, but with his blond
locks and laid back "tude" he founded KA to
embody San Diegan values like sand volley
ball, court volleyball. Varsity volleyball and
mud volleyball in Lake Lag (until the sala
manders in Lake Lag went on the endan
gered species list and they had to stop).
When her husband passed away in 1893,
Jane Stanford needed something more to do
with her time than run her household staff.
She founded Pi Beta Phi so she could be

OCD about decorating name tags for Rush.
The very first Pi Phi pins were actually mosa
ic with real gold leaf.
From the 1890s to the 1910s, sororities
didn't really have distinguishing characteris
tics because sweatshirts hadn?t been invent
ed and everyone looks the same in black and
white. That all changed in the 1920s when
Coco Chanel introduced the "little black
dress." Sororities could set themselves apart,
as they had not been able to before, with de
signer labels and short skirts.
As if the Great Depression weren't stress
ful enough the University decided to lift the
"Female 500" ban on women's enrollment in
1933. There went the neighborhood, as they
say. Every two-bit floozy claiming to be Le
land's illegitimate granddaughter wanted to
come to Stanford. This is when the admis
sions office opened a special legacies divi
sion.
By World War II the sorority situation
was getting ugly, and not just because all of

the cute girls had been recruited as WACs
and WAVEs. Two factions formed as dormi
tory hos and sorority girls waged an all-cam
pus war. Since the real war made supplies
limited, the girls decided to have a wet t-shirt
contest.
The president of Stanford at the time, for
mer Secretary of the Interior and medical
doctor Ray Lyman Wilbur was caught with a
telescope on top of Hoover Tower, "conduct
ing research." Stanford dismissed him in
1943, and Donald B.Tresidder took his place.
As sex-segregated military units became
breeding grounds for lesbianism and gaiety,
fears of homosexuality ran amok in postwar
America. Sororities naturally came under
suspicion. The no-nonsense Tresidder, in an
oft-quoted 1944 speech said, "Sororities will
be banned, or my middle name isn't
Bertrand," which it was.
In 1977, the Board of Trustees allowed
sororities to return to campus. It wasn't until
1998 that sororities were finally given back
their housing after Jane Stanford appeared
to Nanci Howe in a dream and ordered her to
let the children of California be free of arbi
trary organizational conduct rules like col
lective responsibility.
