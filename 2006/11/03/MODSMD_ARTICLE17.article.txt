The depth of a residential community

As the Director of Residential Education, it
was with great disappointment that I read the
Lia Hardin and Darren Franich attack on a
Resident Fellow based on misinformation and
what seemed a desire to harm. It was not in my
view satire or irony; not eloquent nor inspired.
1 find it further discouraging as 1 read the tar
geted and anonymous insults being cast at one
of the newer members of Stanford who chose
to express an opposing opinion.
How has our residential campus at Stan
ford become so callous, as evidenced in these
comments on-line or through the forum of a
personal column in a student publication?
Stanford is and should be a place where we em
phasize a willingness to engage in a productive
and critical exchange of ideas, not in personal
and petty attacks on fellow Stanford members

whose opinions are different than ours. Our
student publications should be embraced by
this community as a forum to challenge our
thinking, inform us with accurate information
and allow the representation of alternative
views. Sadly, 1 feel that The Daily has lost this
sense of mission with the columns that have
been written or the personal strikes that have
been allowed in its anonymous "Comments"
section.
I am the person who is responsible for the
policies and practices that are applied in the
undergraduate residences. 1 invite any reader
to submit criticisms, comments or insults to me
directly tojanec@stanford.edu. If you have the
courage, identify yourself. Further, I invite you
to initiate a respectful discourse with any of the
Resident Fellows because I know that you will
find that this is why they do the hard work of
leading a residential community, i.e. to engage
one-on-one with students, mentor, advise and

learn from their residents and find common
ground on the issues that confront us all.
The issue that began this discussion was one
of dorm reunions. Unfortunately, I suspect that
readers have allowed lack of accurate informa
tion and less than full disclosure of communi
cations to guide their reactions. 1 want to set
the record straight that all Resident Fellows
encourage the positive connection of Stanford
students with one another regardless of their
class. What they also insure is that the environ
ments created in the residence are safe, healthy
and supportive of student life in their home.
Any opposition they might have to a proposed
event would likely he in conflict with those
goals.
F inally, I also issue to all a challenge. We
know that the Stanford life is a busy one for
students, staff and faculty. We embrace as a tool
