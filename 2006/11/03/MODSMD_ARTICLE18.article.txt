## Prop. 86 would save lives 
### STANFORD DEMOCRATS 
We'll be voting "Yes" on Prop 86 next
Tuesday. I"he proposition would raise the state
tobacco tax by 13 cents a cigarette to $2.60 a
pack and dedicate the revenue to improving
health care and reducing smoking in Califor
nia.
In general, we're not huge fans of ballot
initiatives. The process allows ordinary citi
zens with no particular expertise to perma
nently shape complex public policy. In addi
tion, laws passed by such initiative cannot be
easily amended by our elected representa
tives, preventing policy from adapting
quickly to new circumstances. For this rea
son many of the issues that make it onto the
ballot every November are really best left up

to the legislature — especially when it
comes to policies that impact the state budg
et. Thus, we look with skepticism on most
voter propositions each year. However,
when special interest lobbying and the per
verted incentives of elected officials stall
progress on an issue for many years, the ini
tiative process, as imperfect as it is, can be an
appropriate way to start the ball rolling
again. That's the case this year with Prop 86.
The most important thing to know about
Prop 86 is that it will save lives. Any tax on to
bacco encourages current smokers to quit, but
more importantly. Prop 86 will prevent over
700,000 kids from becoming smokers. These
two effects will combine to prevent around
300,000 deaths from smoking. In turn, this will
save $16 billion in health care costs — money

that comes from the pockets of all taxpayers.
Although the main goal of Prop 86 is to re
duce the number of smokers in California,
the tax will also generate approximately $2
billion in revenue annually. California's to
bacco taxes are below the national average,
so increasing the tax provides an opportunity
to raise revenues for necessary government
services at very low economic cost. Over half
of these funds will go to health services, in
cluding tobacco cessation programs, commu
nity health clinics and emergency room care.
Another 40 percent will be dedicated to
health maintenance and disease prevention,
most notably the expansion of children's
health insurance for low-income families. Fi-
