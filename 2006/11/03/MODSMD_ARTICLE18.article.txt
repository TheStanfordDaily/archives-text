## Prop. 86 would save lives 
### STANFORD DEMOCRATS 
We'll be voting "Yes" on Prop 86 next
Tuesday. I"he proposition would raise the state
tobacco tax by 13 cents a cigarette to $2.60 a
pack and dedicate the revenue to improving
health care and reducing smoking in Califor
nia.
In general, we're not huge fans of ballot
initiatives. The process allows ordinary citi
zens with no particular expertise to perma
nently shape complex public policy. In addi
tion, laws passed by such initiative cannot be
easily amended by our elected representa
tives, preventing policy from adapting
quickly to new circumstances. For this rea
son many of the issues that make it onto the
ballot every November are really best left up

to the legislature — especially when it
comes to policies that impact the state budg
et. Thus, we look with skepticism on most
voter propositions each year. However,
when special interest lobbying and the per
verted incentives of elected officials stall
progress on an issue for many years, the ini
tiative process, as imperfect as it is, can be an
appropriate way to start the ball rolling
again. That's the case this year with Prop 86.
The most important thing to know about
Prop 86 is that it will save lives. Any tax on to
bacco encourages current smokers to quit, but
more importantly. Prop 86 will prevent over
700,000 kids from becoming smokers. These
two effects will combine to prevent around
300,000 deaths from smoking. In turn, this will
save $16 billion in health care costs — money

that comes from the pockets of all taxpayers.
Although the main goal of Prop 86 is to re
duce the number of smokers in California,
the tax will also generate approximately $2
billion in revenue annually. California's to
bacco taxes are below the national average,
so increasing the tax provides an opportunity
to raise revenues for necessary government
services at very low economic cost. Over half
of these funds will go to health services, in
cluding tobacco cessation programs, commu
nity health clinics and emergency room care.
Another 40 percent will be dedicated to
health maintenance and disease prevention,
most notably the expansion of children's
health insurance for low-income families. Fi-
nally, around five percent of revenues
will be dedicated to health care re
search. Ideally, the proposition would
allow the legislature more flexibility
in the use of these tax revenues so
that they could tweak funding levels
to adapt to changing priorities. How
ever, this is not a reason to reject

Proposition 86.
Perhaps the best evidence of the
potential impact of Prop 86 is Big
Tobacco's campaign against the tax.
Numerous television ads claim that
Prop 86 is nothing but a "special-in
terest money grab" that allows hos
pitals to violate antitrust laws.
The antitrust line of attack refers
to a provision that allows emer
gency rooms to coordinate avail
ability of on-call specialists. Cur
rently, hospitals are required to
have all types of specialists either on

duty or on call 24/7/365, driving up
costs and causing shortages of key
types of specialists. Prop 86 simply
allows hospitals to negotiate agree
ments to share specialists without
running aground of antitrust laws.
The provision only, exempts hospi
tals from antitrust regulations for
this specific purpose — hospitals
would still be forbidden from all
other types of collusion.
We are certainly not experts on
antitrust law, and we will be the first
to admit that ballot initiatives are

probably not the appropriate in
strument for such extremely techni
cal policymaking. While it would
probably be best to have left this
provision out (or, at least, to have
left it to a separate proposition), the
provision seems mostly reasonable
to us. In fact, it seem that the an
titrust attack is just a Hail Mary by
Big Tobacco to try to derail a meas
ure that seems to be headed for
easy passage.
Ultimately this proposition will
save lives, improve health care and

save billions of dollars for all Califor
nia taxpayers. Prop 86, like the initia
tive process itself, has its flaws. But at
the end of the day we stand with the
American Cancer Society, the Ameri
can 1 ieart Association and the Amer
ican Lung Association. We urge you to
vote "Yes" on Prop 86.
