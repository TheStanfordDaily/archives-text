## Salisbury New ball generates controversy 
### 
I'm like a lot of other people — I
don't like to change. When Kobe
turned in his signature number 8
for 24.1 was appalled. When McDon
ald's took the Mcßib off of its menu,
I was heartbroken.
So what was my initial reaction to
the new microfiber ball that the
NBA introduced to the league this
past week? 1 hated it. Why fix some
thing that isn't broken? It just didn't
make any sense to me.
Many NBA stars agreed with me.
Shaquille O'Neal described his dis
dain for the ball when he said that it
reminded him of "one of those cheap
balls you buy at the toy store — in
door-outdoor balls."
And Shaq wasn't finished.
"I think the new ball is terrible,"
O'Neal said on Monday. "It's the
worst decision some expert, whoever
did it, made.The NBA's been around
how long? A hundred years? Fifty
years? So to change it now, whoever
that person is needs his college de
gree revoked. It's a terrible deci
sion."
Tracy "Megastar" McGrady of
the Houston Rockets also had con
tempt for the institution of the new
ball when, wide-eyed on a recent edi
tion of Sports Center, he said:
"Maybe its about money."
Other big names who have voiced
their opposition to the new ball are
Dallas Mavericks star Dirk Nowitz
ki, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns
and Toronto Raptors point guard T.J.
Ford.
To say the least, NBA Commis
sioner David Stern has not had the
most pleasant response to his league
wide implementation of a more tech
nologically-advanced ball.
But let's step back from all the
controversy. Let's forget Shaq, Nash
and T-Mac. Let's take an objective,
non-partisan look at this issue. I de
cided to do some research on the
topic to find out the exact details of
this new ball.
The new ball is made out of a mi
crofiber composite material, as op
posed to leather from cowhides.
Physicists from the University of
Texas-Arlington have thoroughly
experimented on the ball and come
to the conclusion that it bounces five
to eight percent lower than typical
leather balls when dropped from
four feet. It also apparently bounces
"30 percent more erratically." Now,
I'm not quite sure how you put a
quantitative measure to how erratic
something is, hut then again my
knowledge of physics is essentially
zilch.
The researchers also found that
the ball is less absorbent than the
leather one.This makes it more liable
to become slippery late in games.
This could definitely pose problems
for sweaty players (Shaq) or players
who have some unsanitary, compul
sive propensity for licking their
hands and then touching the ball
(Steve Nash).
Despite all of this, Spalding, the
creator of the new ball, says that it
"provides superior grip and feel
throughout the course of a game."
And Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant
has bluntly said."l like it."
Some opinions have indicated
that the design behind the ball will
also benefit the up-and-coming play
ers of the game such as Leßron
James. Dwayne Wade and Carmelo
Anthony. This can only be a positive
for the NBA. which will probably
formulate a large part of its market
ing strategy over the next decade
around the "new era" of players.
Even Tony La Russa, manager of
the recent world champs in baseball
and a staunch supporter of animal
rights, has voiced his approval over
the new ball, which no longer uses
leather.
So, who are we to believe?
I've played basketball nearly my
whole life with the traditional leather
ball, taking an almost nostalgic com
fort in that familiar feel the now "old
school" ball has.
But the more that I think about it.
this change might not be so bad. Peo
ple are always going to have their
gripes when something new and sig
nificant is instituted. It's just too
early to jump to conclusions about
the ultimate ramifications of the ball,
though. Most likely, there won't be
any ultimate, lasting ramifications
anyway. The game as a whole will
probably change very little.
On this issue. I'm taking the
stance that players like Viktor
Khryapa of the Chicago Bulls have
adopted. He took a broad, contem
plative view of the issue when he
said, "Its still a ball. It's like, if you
painted a room in your house pink.
You see the difference. But live
there a year, it's normal." In other
words, just give it time and every
thing will be okay. Times change,
things change. We adjust to these
changes.
Players like Shaq could take a
cue from Khryapa, or better yet,
from his very own teammate in
Miami, Dwayne Wade.
The mature-beyond-his-years
Wade said. "Hopefully over time,
you'll hear nothing about it and
we'll all stop complaining."
Here's hoping he's right.
