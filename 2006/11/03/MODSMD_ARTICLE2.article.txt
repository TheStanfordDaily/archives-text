# THE 						TROJAN WAR
## USC visits The Farm after first Pac-10 loss since 2003 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Never awake a sleeping giant. %
If the old adage holds true, USC t jofe
ball and the USC marching band mi£|S[
compete to see who can most dominflH
their Stanford counterpart
p.m.The Stanford Band, banned
field after kickoff. will have to listen to
USC's 40 renditions of "Fight On" from
the student section.
The football team, meanwhile, might
wish they were in the Red Zone against a
team infinitely stronger, faster, more tal
ented — and now angrier as well — than
the Cardinal.
The No. 9 Trojans (6-1, 4-1 Pacific-10
Conference) suffered the upset of the sea
son at Oregon State last weekemLas they
lost 33-31. Down by 23 in the third dfl&rter.
USC rallied with three
but Beaver defensive end Jeff VanXp»»\v
deflected a two-point conversijd|with
seven seconds left to seal the Trojans' fatg.
The loss, USC's first in 27 conference
games, came on the heels of three straight
narrow, sloppy victories, suggesting tfytf
Trojans were long in need of a wakeupdall.
Stanford, meanwhile, looks like it hac
yet to wake up. At 0-8. the Cardinal aft
two-thirds of the way to their first winless
season since 1%0. and judging by the
strength of the remaining opponents —
USC, Washington, Oregon State and Cal
ifornia — the odds of victory look even
slimmer. Duke and Florida International
are the only other teams in the
that have yet to win a game this season: *
Stanford last scored an offensive
touchdown 27 days ago. Given that the
score came on a 58-yard halfback pass
from junior Anthony Kimble, one has to
go back to September 23 for the last true
touchdown drive mounted by a unit that
is averaging just 73 yards per game on the
ground and 161 per contest in the air.
Over its last three Pac-10 games, Stan
ford's offense has scored just three points.
Don't expect the futility to end Satur
day. Junior quarterback T.C. Ostrander
will receive just his second start this season
in place of senior Trent Edwards, lost for
the year to a foot injur) against Arizona.
Ostrander has looked panicked in his ap
pearances this season, and given that Fid
wards — far and away the team's most tal

ented player — had trouble moving the
ball with the offensive unit, the backup Os
trander might not be able to either.
Linebackers Rey Maualuga (team
high 51 tackles), Keith Rivers and Dallas
Sartz are the strength of a USC defense
that holds opponents under 200 passing
and 1(X) rushing yards per game.
USC quarterback John David Booty
has stepped into Carson Palmer and Matt
Leinart's old position admirably,complet
ing 63 percent of his passes with a 16-to-5
touchdown to interception ratio. Behind
Booty, receivers Steve Smith (681 yards

and six touchdowns), Dwayne Jarrett and
a one-two tailback punch of starter
Chauncey Washington and Emmanuel
Moody (6.2 yards per carry), the Trojans
have put up over 400 yards per game, in
cluding a healthy 150 rushing.
Stanford's defense is one of the worst
in the country, allowing 35 points and 256
rushing yards per game.
The Stanford-USC series, one of the
oldest in the country, started in 1905. The
Trojans hold a 57-24-3 lead and a four
game win streak, including a 51-21 drub
bing in L.A. last year, and a come-from

behind. heartbreaking 31-28 victory in
Palo Alto in Buddy Teevens' last season in
2(XH.
As Stanford Stadium has grown in
creasingly empty by the game and I JSC's
fan base ever larger by the season, the
Cardinal may be facing a road atmos
phere in their home stadium. UCLA and
Notre Dame fans dramatically outnum
bered Stanford supporters last season, as
did USC fans the year before, but withon
campus disillusionment at an all-time
high, tomorrow might bring the highest
percentage of visiting fans yet.

ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Stanford true-freshman runningback Toby Gerharf rumbles ahead against Arizona. Gerhart and the Card will be led by senior
quarterback T.C. Ostrander against the No. 9 Trojans, who are still smarting from last week's 33-31 upset loss to Oregon State.
