# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Spikers rested, ready for Cal 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Two months into the season, the No. 2 Stan
ford women's volleyball team is starting to feel
the effects of all the intense training and compe
tition. Taking advantage of a week with only a
single match at No. 13 California tonight, the
Cardinal practiced this week only sporadically
â€” and in costume.
"It was a great week," sophomore Foluke
Akinradewo said. "On I lalloween, we had prac
tice in our costumes and that was really fun. It
was nice to have the time to let our bodies rest
and hopefully this weekend we will all be feeling
good."
Refreshed and ready to go, Stanford (19-2,
10-1 Pacific-10 Conference) heads to the Big
Spike primed to continue its winning ways, look
ing for a tenth straight conference win against
the Bears (17-5,6-s).The Cardinal have not lost
since the first week of the season and recorded
back-to-back sweeps in Arizona last week. Cal
has won three straight after being upset by No.
24 Oregon (then unranked) in Berkeley two
weeks ago.
When Cal came to Maples on Oct. 6. the Car
dinal claimed a three-game win. not allowing
more than 22 points in any game. Senior Kristin
Richards led a Stanford offensive juggernaut
with 13 kills at a .565 clip without a single attack
ing error in the match. Sophomore outside hitter
Cynthia Barboza had 13 kills as well, hitting .303
on the night. Junior setter Bryn Kehoe dished
out 30 assists and recorded a team-high 12 digs.
Akinradewo finished with a match-high seven
blocks.
Outside hitter Angie Fressey led Cal with 13

kills and 10 digs. Setter Samantha Carter tallied
33 assists and outside hitter Morgan Beck had a
team-high three blocks.
Since then, the Cardinal have moved up
steadily in the rankings, buoyed by a string of
sweeps and two crucial wins over No. 5 UCLA
and No. b USC, both on the road.
After the Los Angeles victories put the Car
dinal third in the national rankings, they finally
broke into the top two this week. Nebraska and
Penn State had held the top spots in every poll
in 2006 until the Nittany Lions were unexpect
edly swept by No. 10 Wisconsin and barely
squeaked by No. 12 Minnesota this past week
end.
The Cardinal have continually improved and
show no signs of slowing down after blowing
past Arizona and Arizona State last weekend.
"It's not really the fundamentals of volley
ball that have gotten better," Akinradewo said.
"We have just become a better team and be
come a lot closer. We get more excited when we
are doing well and come closer together when
we are not. It used to be that we were just indi
viduals on a court claiming to be a team, but now
we actually are a team and are really close with
each other."

As a team and individually, the Cardinal have
been turning in great performances match after
match. Akinradewo had a phenomenal week
end in Arizona,leading the Cardinal in kills both
nights and hitting a career-high .850 with 17 kills
against the Wildcats. She is hitting .450 on the
season, the fourth-best percentage in the nation.
In the win over Arizona, Richards recorded a
match-high 20 digs which puts her just 19 away
from taking over the top spot in Stanford histo
ry. She is second on the team in digs this season
with 1W behind sophomore libero Jessica Fish
burn. who has 255.
Barboza leads the team with 295 kills and 28
aces and is the top point-scorer in the Pac-10
when kills, blocks and aces are combined.
In Berkeley, Pressey leads the way with 334
kills and freshman Hana Cutura is second with
255. Cutura also has a team-high 21 aces. Senior
libero Jillian Davis has recorded 3bl digs and
middle blocker fillen Orchard has 107 blocks on
the season.
"They have great outsides," Akinradewo said
of the Bears. "Last time we played them, they
were mixing up their rotations a little bit and
weren't sure exactly what they were going to do.
But now that they have had some time to settle
in and get comfortable in their positions, it will
be a much tougher game than last time."
Though the Cardinal are the favorites head
ing into the weekend, the Bears will not be easy
to beat on their home turf. Only Oregon has won
in Haas Pavilion this season and Cal has 10
home wins.
"Every time we play Cal, it's a great game,"
Akinradewo said. "They are a great team and
really step up to the challenge when they play
us."
