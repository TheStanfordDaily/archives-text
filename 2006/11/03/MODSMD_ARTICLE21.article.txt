# MEN'S WATER POLO
## No. 1 USC next up for Card Trojans put 37-game win streak on line 
### ANDREW SHEN STAFF WRITER 
The top-ranked USC men's
water polo team will square off
against No. 4 Stanford this Saturday
at Avery Aquatic Center in the
teams' first meeting since last year's
championship game. USC has won
its last five contests with the Cardi
nal, including a nail-biting 3-2 victo
ry for the 2005 crown.
Riding an impressive six-game
winning streak, Stanford (13-5) has
plenty of momentum heading into
the game. However, that recent run
of success pales in comparison to
what they are up against, as USC
(18-0) has notched 37 consecutive
wins in a streak that stretches back
to last year. In their last 10 games
alone, the Trojans have outscored
their opponents by a combined
score of 136-66.
Yet. the Cardinal remain confi
dent in their abilities, and are hop
ing that their home-pool environ
ment will prove to he a significant
advantage.
"We are really excited about
this weekend," junior Peter Fin
layson said. "We feel like we match
up well against USC and are going
to go for it. We love that we have
the opportunity to play these guys
at home â€” we are really counting
on the fans making this a tough
place to play."
The Trojans sport a three-head
ed scoring monster composed of
seniors Juan Delgadillo and
Thomas Hale and freshman J.W.
Krumpholz. The trio has recorded
36, 33 and 31 goals respectively on
the year. 1 iowever, the Cardinal are
not without firepower of their own.
with senior captain Tyler Drake,
sophomore Will Hindle-Katel and
freshmen Drac and Janson Wigo all
notching over 25 goals.
Both teams also boast excellent
goalkeeping, with Stanford's tan
dem of sophomore Jimmie Sand
man and senior Sandy Hohener.
who are third and sixth respectively
in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration in saves per game. Mean
while, USC's Adam Shilling ranks
third in the MPSF in total saves.
While the Cardinal are prepar
ing for USC considering them the
best team in the nation and respect
ing their 37-game winning streak,
there are some signs that the Tro
jans are indeed beatable, despite
their 18-0 record.
For one, Stanford has had a
grand total of six home games this
season, in comparison to a dozen
for the Trojans, who played 11 home
contests in a row at one point.
Also, both teams have struggled
against UCLA. The Bruins have

been the bane of Stanford's season,
as the Cardinal have lost to the Bru
ins three times by margins of one,
two and three goals. Although USC
has beaten UCLA twice, both
games were one-goal victories and
one came in triple-overtime.
Even though USC is a heavy fa
vorite, the match will certainly be a
dogfight.
Nearly 3,000 fans are expected
to attend the game. Additionally,
the first 500 fans will receive a 10
percent discount on their next
American Airlines flight and two
tickets will be given away at half
time.
"If you only ever come to one
water polo game, make it this one,"
Finlayson said.
