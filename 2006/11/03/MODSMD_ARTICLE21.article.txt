### ANDREW SHEN STAFF WRITER 
The top-ranked USC men's
water polo team will square off
against No. 4 Stanford this Saturday
at Avery Aquatic Center in the
teams' first meeting since last year's
championship game. USC has won
its last five contests with the Cardi
nal, including a nail-biting 3-2 victo
ry for the 2005 crown.
Riding an impressive six-game
winning streak, Stanford (13-5) has
plenty of momentum heading into
the game. However, that recent run
of success pales in comparison to
what they are up against, as USC
(18-0) has notched 37 consecutive
wins in a streak that stretches back

alone, the Trojans have outscored
their opponents by a combined
score of 136-66.

ment will prove to he a significant
advantage.

this weekend," junior Peter Fin

up well against USC and are going
to go for it. We love that we have
the opportunity to play these guys
at home â€” we are really counting
on the fans making this a tough
place to play."
The Trojans sport a three-head
ed scoring monster composed of
seniors Juan Delgadillo and
Thomas Hale and freshman J.W.
Krumpholz. The trio has recorded
36, 33 and 31 goals respectively on
the year. 1 iowever, the Cardinal are
not without firepower of their own.
