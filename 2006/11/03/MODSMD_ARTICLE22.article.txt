## Pac-10 pride up for grabs Soccer celebrates senior day with visit from No. 10 Cal 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ITie Big Game arrives early for the Stanford
men's soccer team, as it hosts No. 10 California on
Friday at 7 p.m.The meeting will mark the end of
the regular season for both teams and will also be
the final home game for the Cardinal seniors.
Stanford (6-7-4,4-3-2 Pac-10) has not played at
home since Oct. 15, when it beat Oregon State 2-0.
In the interim, the Cardinal have registered a tie at
UCLA and road losses to Cal and San Diego State.
The Bears (12-4-1.7-2-0), meanwhile, have won
six of their last seven games, and have also domi
nated against Stanford in recent years, winning
seven of their last nine games against the Cardinal
with the other two contests ending in ties. In the
most recent meeting, Cal downed Stanford 2-0. Ju
nior midfielder Ryan Oblak noted the Cardinal's
desire to curtail the Bears' recent domination.
"Obviously, we are looking for a win." Oblak
said. "It has been a long time since we beat Cal, so
we would definitely love to get a 'W' on Friday."
Senior Galen Thompson was similarly hopeful
for a victory, but did not believe that the emotions
of Senior Day would influence the game.
"Cal has had a good season and they are a good
team — it is nice to finish the season with a quali
ty opponent,"Thompson said. "I know that noth
ing would make me happier than to finish my ca
reer here by beating them at home. [But] any time
we play Cal, we expect them to come out excited. 1
try not to look at it as a very emotional or special
day — the idea of playing Cal at home already has
all the excitement it needs to produce a great
game."
Coach Bret Simon agreed that the Bears would
not be intimidated playing on the road for the fi
nale for the graduating Cardinal seniors.

"Cal is certainly one of the top 10 teams in the
country and is playing quite well." Simon said.
"They have a number of quality senior players and
have played at Stanford many times."
Among the Bears' veteran players are leading
scorers junior Javier Ayala-Hill and senior Steve
Purdy as well as junior goalie Justin Meyers.
Cal's defense leads the Pac-10. allowing the
fewest number of goals over the course of the sea
son, while also registering eight shutouts.
Simon will be looking to the experience of his
own upperclassmen to contribute to Stanford's
overall performance with their presences on and
off the field.
"The Cal game is very important, as it's a signa
ture game for our seniors and it's a good way to
measure how far we've come," Simon said."Senior
leadership will be important for us on Friday night.
Even our injured seniors [goalie Andrew Kar
tunen and midfielder Michael Brown] will play a
vital role in helping us prepare, as we'll need every
player to be at the top of his game."
On the field, Thompson and fellow senior Bret
Shimizu as well as leading scorer junior Evan Mor
gan will lead the Cardinal offensively, while fresh
man John Moore defends Stanford's goal once
again.
After beating DC'LA 4-1 last week. Cal secured
the school's first Pac-10 title. Stanford remains tied
for third with the Bruins, behind San Diego State.
However, because Pac-10 teams cannot automati
cally qualify for the NC'AA Tournament, any se
lections would be considered at-large entrants.
The postseason implications of Friday's game are
therefore indefinite, but a win would certainly aid
the Cardinal's chances for consideration.
Regardless of the slim postseason possibilities.
Simon is pleased with the team's success this year,
a vast improvement over the 4-11 -3 record of 2005.
"Being competitive with the best teams on the
West Coast and on the road is a big improvement
for our team," Simon said."Add in the fact that we

juries and that we are only playing
two true seniors presently, and we
have to be proud of how we've pro
gressed. Our goals [for Friday] will
be to play well as a team, focus for
the full game and win the game to
put an exclamation point onto a
good season."
To help them do so, Stanford
hopes that the student body will
turn out to support the team as it did
for the Sept. 22 meeting with San
Diego State, at which almost 2.000

fans were in attendance.
"Playing at home is great be
cause our fans have been awesome,"
Oblak said.
Simon agreed, noting that fan
support would be of increased im
portance given the number of Bears
supporters in the area.
"A pro-Stanford crowd will help
us. But 1 think Cal will have a good
number of fans as well. I expect the
atmosphere to be exciting for both
teams."
Thompson, too. looked forward
to the competition and tradition
that contribute to such an atmos
phere.
"It's Cal. Any time we play them
it is a big game, regardless of the sit
uation," he said.

"Playing at home is great be
cause our fans have been awesome,"
Oblak said.
Simon agreed, noting that fan
support would be of increased im
portance given the number of Bears
supporters in the area.
"A pro-Stanford crowd will help
us. But 1 think Cal will have a good
number of fans as well. I expect the
atmosphere to be exciting for both
teams."

to the competition and tradition
that contribute to such an atmos

"It's Cal. Any time we play them
it is a big game, regardless of the sit

ITie Big Game arrives early for the Stanford
men's soccer team, as it hosts No. 10 California on
Friday at 7 p.m.The meeting will mark the end of
the regular season for both teams and will also be
the final home game for the Cardinal seniors.
Stanford (6-7-4,4-3-2 Pac-10) has not played at
home since Oct. 15, when it beat Oregon State 2-0.
In the interim, the Cardinal have registered a tie at
UCLA and road losses to Cal and San Diego State.
The Bears (12-4-1.7-2-0), meanwhile, have won
six of their last seven games, and have also domi
nated against Stanford in recent years, winning
seven of their last nine games against the Cardinal
with the other two contests ending in ties. In the
most recent meeting, Cal downed Stanford 2-0. Ju
nior midfielder Ryan Oblak noted the Cardinal's
desire to curtail the Bears' recent domination.
"Obviously, we are looking for a win." Oblak
said. "It has been a long time since we beat Cal, so
we would definitely love to get a 'W' on Friday."
Senior Galen Thompson was similarly hopeful
for a victory, but did not believe that the emotions
of Senior Day would influence the game.
"Cal has had a good season and they are a good
team — it is nice to finish the season with a quali
ty opponent,"Thompson said. "I know that noth
ing would make me happier than to finish my ca
reer here by beating them at home. [But] any time
we play Cal, we expect them to come out excited. 1
try not to look at it as a very emotional or special
day — the idea of playing Cal at home already has
all the excitement it needs to produce a great
game."
Coach Bret Simon agreed that the Bears would
not be intimidated playing on the road for the fi
nale for the graduating Cardinal seniors.

"Cal is certainly one of the top 10 teams in the
country and is playing quite well." Simon said.
"They have a number of quality senior players and
have played at Stanford many times."
Among the Bears' veteran players are leading
scorers junior Javier Ayala-Hill and senior Steve
Purdy as well as junior goalie Justin Meyers.
Cal's defense leads the Pac-10. allowing the
fewest number of goals over the course of the sea
son, while also registering eight shutouts.
Simon will be looking to the experience of his
own upperclassmen to contribute to Stanford's
overall performance with their presences on and
off the field.
"The Cal game is very important, as it's a signa
ture game for our seniors and it's a good way to
measure how far we've come," Simon said."Senior
leadership will be important for us on Friday night.
Even our injured seniors [goalie Andrew Kar
tunen and midfielder Michael Brown] will play a
vital role in helping us prepare, as we'll need every
player to be at the top of his game."
On the field, Thompson and fellow senior Bret
Shimizu as well as leading scorer junior Evan Mor
gan will lead the Cardinal offensively, while fresh
man John Moore defends Stanford's goal once
again.
After beating DC'LA 4-1 last week. Cal secured
the school's first Pac-10 title. Stanford remains tied
for third with the Bruins, behind San Diego State.
However, because Pac-10 teams cannot automati
cally qualify for the NC'AA Tournament, any se
lections would be considered at-large entrants.
The postseason implications of Friday's game are
therefore indefinite, but a win would certainly aid
the Cardinal's chances for consideration.
Regardless of the slim postseason possibilities.
Simon is pleased with the team's success this year,
a vast improvement over the 4-11 -3 record of 2005.
"Being competitive with the best teams on the
West Coast and on the road is a big improvement
for our team," Simon said."Add in the fact that we

have had a string of long-term in
juries and that we are only playing
two true seniors presently, and we
have to be proud of how we've pro
gressed. Our goals [for Friday] will
be to play well as a team, focus for
the full game and win the game to
put an exclamation point onto a
good season."
To help them do so, Stanford
hopes that the student body will
turn out to support the team as it did
for the Sept. 22 meeting with San
Diego State, at which almost 2.000

fans were in attendance.
