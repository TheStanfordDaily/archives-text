### YOUR EDITORS INTERMISSION HIGH ROLLERS 
It was our dream to go to Vegas. Betsy had the
privilege of trekking to Sin City last year lor Veg
oose, while Brendan was stuck in Kansas City for
some random "journalism conference" (although
he did enjoy the BBQ). This year, it was going to be
different. Brendan was going to lay a Hamilton or
two on that Blackjack table. Betsy was going to
check into a hotel other than the Howard Johnson.
Both of them were going to get to partake in the
wonder and awe of the $4.99 Power Combo at
Cocos.
But alas, it was not to be.
Brendan found himself unexpectedly burdened
by "essays" and "job recruiting." Betsy realized she
had two midterms on Monday and that she should
probably "study" for them. The future had seemed
so bright. What was there left lor us now?
In spite of it all. we find ourselves here at The
Dailv again, as we always seem to. Because we know
things always work out for the best. At least that's
what we've been told.
Vegas would have been amazing, but we were
denied its glory. Which means something better
must be coming down the pipeline. Like an amazing
free event in DC. Mavbe even one not run by a Lib
ertarian think tank that requires attendance for re
imbursement. Perhaps even including a five-star
hotel, delicious food, exclusive behind-the-scenes
interviews and Business Class tickets.
Here's to hoping.
