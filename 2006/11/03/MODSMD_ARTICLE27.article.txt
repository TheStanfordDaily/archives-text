## Showgirls: NC-17, and not much else 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION WALK-AROUND 
Last year's Las Vegas edition of Intermission looked back
on one of the best films to take place in Sin City, Leaving Las

Vegas. This year we
thought we'd look back
at one of the worst
films to lake place in
Las Vegas, "Show
girls."
Showgirls (1995)
I'm always skep
tical when people tell
me a film is "so bad
that it's good." I'm
skeptical because I re
ally can't think of many
movies that truly fit
into this category.
"Showgirls" is often
cited as one such
movie. But. having re
cently watched
sleazy excuse for film*
making. 1 simply cam
not agree. It's not "sH

bad lhat it's good." Its just plain In fact. Showgirls is lura
just a candidate for worst movie fjpbe set in Las Vegas.

is maddeningly simple. NomiMalone (Elizabeth Berkley) is

ridiculous sex
scene (more on
this later), a i

gratuitous rape
scene, a really

gratuitous blud
geoning and an un-

interesting revela- v
tion concerning Norni's

With an astonishing 13 nominations. '
"Showgirls" managed to win seven
Golden Raspberry (or Razzie) awards in
19%. These include worst film, worst
screenplay, worst actor, worst actress and
worst director. It is currently tied with

"Battlefield Earth" for recipient of the
most Razzies (though it had more nom-

inations). Interestingly, director Paul
Verhoeven appeared at the ceremony

to accept his "award" for worst director. He was the first di
rector to do this.
It's not difficult to see why Verhoeven and screenwriter
Joe Eszterhas were allowed to make "Showgirls." The two
had collaborated on "Basic Instinct" in 1992 which was a
huge success and launched the career of Sharon Stone. From
the perspective of studio attempting to replicate the
success of "Basic Ir >tinct," "Showgirls'" combination of sex,
nudity and violenc< would have been irresistible.
But it's difficult o understand what Verhoeven saw in the
movie. Prior to "J asic Instinct," "the Dutch director had
helmed and "Total Recall," which were fairly so
phisticated arillers. There's certainly nothing com
plex or d about "Showgirls." It's shallow, sleazy
and utterlylifcg} istic. But perhaps I'm not being cynical
enough? Esxternas eportedly received $ 1 million to write the
film's screenpfa*' Tio knows what Verhoeven was offered?

stand what Berkßy saw in the project. I

Last year's Las Vegas edition of Intermission looked back
on one of the best films to take place in Sin City, Leaving Las

Vegas. This year we
thought we'd look back
at one of the worst
films to lake place in
Las Vegas, "Show
girls."
Showgirls (1995)
I'm always skep
tical when people tell
me a film is "so bad
that it's good." I'm
skeptical because I re
ally can't think of many
movies that truly fit
into this category.
"Showgirls" is often
cited as one such
movie. But. having re
cently watched
sleazy excuse for film*
making. 1 simply cam
not agree. It's not "sH

bad lhat it's good." Its just plain In fact. Showgirls is lura
just a candidate for worst movie fjpbe set in Las Vegas.
candidate for worst movie of all time.
Though the film spans more than two hours its storyline
is maddeningly simple. NomiMalone (Elizabeth Berkley) is
on her way to Vegas hoping to make it big as a dancer. She
begins working as a lap dancer at a seedv strip club before at- «

trading the attention of a high profile
star (Gina Gershon) at a local

show and the hotel's talent direc-

tor (Kyle MacLachlan).

J Nomi lands a part in the
show and then ... ah. who

film's final "
third consists of a

ridiculous sex
scene (more on
this later), a i

gratuitous rape
scene, a really

gratuitous blud
geoning and an un-

interesting revela- v

With an astonishing 13 nominations. '
"Showgirls" managed to win seven
Golden Raspberry (or Razzie) awards in
19%. These include worst film, worst
screenplay, worst actor, worst actress and
worst director. It is currently tied with

"Battlefield Earth" for recipient of the
most Razzies (though it had more nom-

inations). Interestingly, director Paul
Verhoeven appeared at the ceremony

to accept his "award" for worst director. He was the first di
rector to do this.
It's not difficult to see why Verhoeven and screenwriter
Joe Eszterhas were allowed to make "Showgirls." The two
had collaborated on "Basic Instinct" in 1992 which was a
huge success and launched the career of Sharon Stone. From
the perspective of studio attempting to replicate the
success of "Basic Ir >tinct," "Showgirls'" combination of sex,
nudity and violenc< would have been irresistible.
But it's difficult o understand what Verhoeven saw in the
movie. Prior to "J asic Instinct," "the Dutch director had
helmed and "Total Recall," which were fairly so
phisticated arillers. There's certainly nothing com
plex or d about "Showgirls." It's shallow, sleazy
and utterlylifcg} istic. But perhaps I'm not being cynical
enough? Esxternas eportedly received $ 1 million to write the
film's screenpfa*' Tio knows what Verhoeven was offered?
