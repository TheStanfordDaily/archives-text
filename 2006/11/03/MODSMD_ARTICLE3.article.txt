# Staph infection outbreak continues to plague team
## 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's injuries throughout the 2(X)f> season have
been well documented. But the Cardinal have also had to
overcome an off-the-field concern â€” staph infections.
Junior linebacker Pat Maynor is the latest casualty and
will likely miss tomorrow's matchup against USC. Maynor,
who was diagnosed with a staph infection in his leg, is the
third Stanford starter to miss time due to such an infection.
Junior running back Anthony Kimble missed the start of
training camp and spent time in the hospital as a result of his
preseason infection. Senior offensive lineman Jon Cochran
missed the last two games with a similar ailment.
"1 don't know how much it's hit other places, but it's hit
us, and it's been pretty devastating," coach Walt Harris said
in his weekly press conference on TUesday.
The infections may have spread from unclean conditions
in the athletic facilities. A unsanitary locker room couch was
pinpointed as a possible cause.
"Obviously it is a problem," quarterback T.C Ostrander
said. "It spreads quickly and it's hard to contain. The foot
ball locker room is about the worst environment for some
thing like that. They took out the old couches and hopeful
ly we'll be able to curtail the problem."
Football hasn't been the only Stanford sport to face the
issue. Former Cardinal catcher John Hester missed part of
the 2006 season with an infection in his knee.
Redshirt freshman Fred Campbell will start in Maynor's
place if he is unable to play.
"The swelling in [Maynor's] leg is still there, so it makes
it impossible for him to bend his knee," Harris said on Tues
day. "Until he can get the swelling out and bend his knee
properly, he can't even consider playing."
Edwards update
Senior quarterback Trent Edwards' career ended after
he injured his foot while scrambling against Arizona. Two
weeks later some of the details of the in jury are still unclear,
even to Edwards.
The general nature of the injury was confirmed when
Edwards met with a second set of doctors this week, but the
extent of the damage is unknown.
"I met with another doctor and he told me pretty much
the same thing that the Stanford doctors saw," Edwards
said. "The sesamoid bone in my foot is still in two pieces
when it should be in one. It is fractured and there is still
some swelling in the area from the trauma that I took. It
takes a while for the swelling to leave your foot."
