# Staph infection outbreak continues to plague team
## 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's injuries throughout the 2(X)f> season have
been well documented. But the Cardinal have also had to
overcome an off-the-field concern — staph infections.
Junior linebacker Pat Maynor is the latest casualty and
will likely miss tomorrow's matchup against USC. Maynor,
who was diagnosed with a staph infection in his leg, is the
third Stanford starter to miss time due to such an infection.
Junior running back Anthony Kimble missed the start of
training camp and spent time in the hospital as a result of his
preseason infection. Senior offensive lineman Jon Cochran
missed the last two games with a similar ailment.
"1 don't know how much it's hit other places, but it's hit
us, and it's been pretty devastating," coach Walt Harris said
in his weekly press conference on TUesday.
The infections may have spread from unclean conditions
in the athletic facilities. A unsanitary locker room couch was
pinpointed as a possible cause.
"Obviously it is a problem," quarterback T.C Ostrander
said. "It spreads quickly and it's hard to contain. The foot
ball locker room is about the worst environment for some
thing like that. They took out the old couches and hopeful
ly we'll be able to curtail the problem."
Football hasn't been the only Stanford sport to face the
issue. Former Cardinal catcher John Hester missed part of
the 2006 season with an infection in his knee.
Redshirt freshman Fred Campbell will start in Maynor's
place if he is unable to play.
"The swelling in [Maynor's] leg is still there, so it makes
it impossible for him to bend his knee," Harris said on Tues
day. "Until he can get the swelling out and bend his knee
properly, he can't even consider playing."
Edwards update
Senior quarterback Trent Edwards' career ended after
he injured his foot while scrambling against Arizona. Two
weeks later some of the details of the in jury are still unclear,
even to Edwards.
The general nature of the injury was confirmed when
Edwards met with a second set of doctors this week, but the
extent of the damage is unknown.
"I met with another doctor and he told me pretty much
the same thing that the Stanford doctors saw," Edwards
said. "The sesamoid bone in my foot is still in two pieces
when it should be in one. It is fractured and there is still
some swelling in the area from the trauma that I took. It
takes a while for the swelling to leave your foot."
STANFORD

The sesamoid bone in the foot is embed
ded within the tendon underneath the big
toe.
The question still remaining is whether
Edwards suffered damage to the ligaments
in his foot.The length of Edwards' recovery
could depend on the extent of the ligament
damage.
"It is basically considered a really bad
turf toe," Edwards said. "The difference in
my case is that the sesamoid bone is frac
tured."
The good news is that doctors have re
ported that Edwards will not need surgery
to correct the problem. Instead, he should
make a full recovery with proper rest and
rehab.
"They have told me I shouldn't have any
lingering problems if I rehab it properly and
everything goes as scheduled," Edwards
said."lt is an injury that continues to bother
some athletes if they come back too soon or
don't do the right rehab or treatment. I have
to make sure I don't come back too quick
ly"
Edwards suffered the injury on Stan
ford's first offensive series in the Oct. 14 20-
7 loss against Arizona when he was tackled
from behind trying to scramble for a first
down. It was announced later that week
that Edwards would miss the remainder of

the season, ending his Stanford career.
"I would love to be out there on Satur
day playing against USC," Edwards said.
"I've come to grips with it a little better now
and I'm starting to learn my role a little bet
ter. My job now is to help the young guys
and T.C. out and make everyone's job a lit
tle easier."
Harris sits down with D
The Stanford defensive unit took advan
tage of last week's bye by holding a unique
film session. Harris took the time during the
off week to join the players and defensive
coaches for meeting to discuss the Cardi
nal's 38-3 loss to Arizona State.
"We tried to make it an open forum
where they could talk about what they were
thinking and what they thought they were
supposed to do" Harris said. "1 thought it
was very positive and hopefully the players
did as well. We ironed some things out. and
we improved our opportunity to coach and
play better. It's not what a coach knows, it's
what a player executes on the grass."
Among the topics discussed were com
munication issues between defensive units
and how to correct some of the more de
tailed defensive miscues.
"We learned that our communication
from coaching staff to players hasn't been

as good as it needs to be." senior safety
Brandon Harrison said. "We had a lot of as
signments where the players weren't sure
exactly what they were supposed to do, and
we didn't realize there was any confusion
until we talked about it. We got a lot of
things cleared up. and I think Coach Harris
was especially happy with the meeting. Now
we have a much more open line of commu
nication in a sense that we are not just mem
orizing what we are supposed to do, but ask
ing questions so the entire concept of the
defense fits in together."
