## BORAT, YA? 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION SEXY TIME 
Love him or "not get" him, it's
safe to say that there will never be
another comedic force like Borat.
For several years, comedian Sacha
Baron Cohen has traveled
throughout England and the Unit
ed States under the guise of ficti
tious Kazakh journalist Borat
Sagdiyev on a quest for cultural
discovery (and, ultimately, Pamela
Anderson). His appearauces on
Da Ali G Show are some of the
funniest, most poignant comedy
pieces to grace television in years,
brilliant satirical commentary
mascarading as a simple-minded
foreigner in a civilization he can't
begin to understand.
The popularity of the character
has now culminated in "Borat:
Cultural Learnings of America for
Make Benefit Glorious Nation of
Kazakhstan," a semi-fiction come
dy that is often every bit as hilari
ous and revealing as Borat's tele
vision appearances, although

somewhat bogged down by
the feature-length format.
The humor of the film is pure
genius, but, in attempting to
frame a fictional narrative
around brutal realism, the
filmmakers sacrifice some of
the authenticity that makes
Borat so special in the first
place.
The genre is a sort of
guerilla comedy: Borat inter-

views real-life individuals who
have no idea that he is really a co
median in disguise. Responses run
the gamut from hilarious to shock
ing and everywhere in between, al
most always too ridiculous to have
been planned. The idea isn't alto
gether original — many comedi
ans have used unwitting subjects
as their victims. But in addition to
an unparalleled commitment to
his character (he doesn't shower
or wash his suit before performing
in order to smell the part, for in
stance). Cohen's comedy is unique
in its treatment of his subjects.
In the film, Borat travels across
America in search of answers to
his own country's economic and
social problems. He interviews
everyone from feminist groups in
New York to rodeo attendees in
Texas, even approaching random

pants arc most often not the target
of the humor. Rather, it is the so
cial environment they represent:
the beliefs, habits and traditions.
But with Borat, the simple for
eigner, the interviewees are often
far too open about subjects they
would normally hide. And it can
be truly outrageous what Borat
manages to get many of them to
say.
The film is made up of two
types of comedy: a childish Borat
that says funny, unexpected
things, and Borat that goads oth
ers to say funny, unexpected, yet
horrific things. Over the course of
his road trip. Borat purchases a pet
bear, uncovers homophobia in un
likely places (hint: it's not just in
the conservative South), attempts
to drink alcohol in the middle of a
driver's test, listens to a talk about
why slavery should be reinstated
and innocently asks feminists
about women's "smaller brains."
These real-life interactions are
consistently hilarious while, at the
same time, revealing as no other

method could just how real and
persistent prejudice still is in
America. I can't emphasize
enough just how effective Cohen's
tactics are, bringing a brutal clarity
to American social consciousness.
Sometimes, the bits almost go too
far — the rant of a supposedly ed
ucated college student in the back
of an RV, for instance, is so ap
pallingly offensive that it will have
audiences squirming rather than
laughing. Perhaps that is what
makes Borat so effective — the
character's naive playfulness
leaves the audience all the more
vulnerable to the moments they'd
rather not watch.
If I haven't gone into much de
tail about the actual humor of
Borat, it is because it is the kind
that has to be seen to be appreciat
ed, reliant more on the in-the-mo
ment-ness of it all rather than Js
Cohen's immaculate character
acting and preparation. To try to

explain any of it would ruin it. Be
assured, Borat is a very funny
movie. If you find the TV show or
movie trailer amusing, you'll find
the film hysterical. Some of the
stuff in there is the funniest thing to
hit the big screen in years.
Unfortunately, the film does
have its faults, mostly when the im
promptu reality bits end and the
movie-ish parts begin. Alongside
Cohen is actor Ken Davitian as
Borat's assistant/manager, Azamat,
who does a good job yet detracts
from Borat. Their relationship not
only pulls the audience away from
the smart satire but provides what is
possibly one of the most shockingly
offensive movie moments of the
millennium, potentially funny until

it moves too far into Jackass territo
ry. A plot also arises with Borat on
a search for Pamela Anderson, but
it all leads up to a climax that
doesn't really satisfy.
Borat is at its best when the
journalist is releasing chickens on
subway cars and inviting prosti
tutes to formal dinners while ex
posing the inequities of our society.
When the film sticks to the guerril
la comedy, it works just as well as
anyone could ever hope. When
narrative-time kicks in, everything
slows. As a result, Borat is not a
perfect film (and it probably
couldn't be given the medium), but
it still stakes its claim as one of the
funniest and most important come
dies of our generation.

safe to say that there will never be

it all leads up to a climax that
doesn't really satisfy.
Borat is at its best when the
journalist is releasing chickens on
subway cars and inviting prosti
tutes to formal dinners while ex
posing the inequities of our society.
When the film sticks to the guerril

anyone could ever hope. When
narrative-time kicks in, everything
slows. As a result, Borat is not a
perfect film (and it probably
couldn't be given the medium), but
it still stakes its claim as one of the
funniest and most important come
dies of our generation.

Love him or "not get" him, it's
safe to say that there will never be
another comedic force like Borat.
For several years, comedian Sacha
Baron Cohen has traveled
throughout England and the Unit
ed States under the guise of ficti
tious Kazakh journalist Borat
Sagdiyev on a quest for cultural
discovery (and, ultimately, Pamela
Anderson). His appearauces on
Da Ali G Show are some of the
funniest, most poignant comedy
pieces to grace television in years,
brilliant satirical commentary
mascarading as a simple-minded
foreigner in a civilization he can't
begin to understand.
The popularity of the character
has now culminated in "Borat:
Cultural Learnings of America for
Make Benefit Glorious Nation of
Kazakhstan," a semi-fiction come
dy that is often every bit as hilari
ous and revealing as Borat's tele
vision appearances, although

somewhat bogged down by
the feature-length format.
The humor of the film is pure
genius, but, in attempting to
frame a fictional narrative
around brutal realism, the
filmmakers sacrifice some of
the authenticity that makes
Borat so special in the first
place.
The genre is a sort of
guerilla comedy: Borat inter-

views real-life individuals who
have no idea that he is really a co
median in disguise. Responses run
the gamut from hilarious to shock
ing and everywhere in between, al
most always too ridiculous to have
been planned. The idea isn't alto
gether original — many comedi
ans have used unwitting subjects
as their victims. But in addition to
an unparalleled commitment to
his character (he doesn't shower
or wash his suit before performing
in order to smell the part, for in
stance). Cohen's comedy is unique
in its treatment of his subjects.
In the film, Borat travels across
America in search of answers to
his own country's economic and
social problems. He interviews
everyone from feminist groups in
New York to rodeo attendees in
Texas, even approaching random

pants arc most often not the target
of the humor. Rather, it is the so
cial environment they represent:
the beliefs, habits and traditions.
But with Borat, the simple for
eigner, the interviewees are often
far too open about subjects they
would normally hide. And it can
be truly outrageous what Borat
manages to get many of them to
say.
The film is made up of two
types of comedy: a childish Borat
that says funny, unexpected
things, and Borat that goads oth
ers to say funny, unexpected, yet
horrific things. Over the course of
his road trip. Borat purchases a pet
bear, uncovers homophobia in un
likely places (hint: it's not just in
the conservative South), attempts
to drink alcohol in the middle of a
driver's test, listens to a talk about
why slavery should be reinstated
and innocently asks feminists
about women's "smaller brains."
These real-life interactions are
consistently hilarious while, at the
same time, revealing as no other

method could just how real and
persistent prejudice still is in
America. I can't emphasize
enough just how effective Cohen's
tactics are, bringing a brutal clarity
to American social consciousness.
Sometimes, the bits almost go too
far — the rant of a supposedly ed
ucated college student in the back
of an RV, for instance, is so ap
pallingly offensive that it will have
audiences squirming rather than
laughing. Perhaps that is what
makes Borat so effective — the
character's naive playfulness
leaves the audience all the more
vulnerable to the moments they'd
rather not watch.
If I haven't gone into much de
tail about the actual humor of
Borat, it is because it is the kind
that has to be seen to be appreciat
ed, reliant more on the in-the-mo
ment-ness of it all rather than Js
Cohen's immaculate character
acting and preparation. To try to

explain any of it would ruin it. Be
assured, Borat is a very funny
movie. If you find the TV show or
movie trailer amusing, you'll find
the film hysterical. Some of the
stuff in there is the funniest thing to
hit the big screen in years.
Unfortunately, the film does
have its faults, mostly when the im
promptu reality bits end and the
movie-ish parts begin. Alongside
Cohen is actor Ken Davitian as
Borat's assistant/manager, Azamat,
who does a good job yet detracts
from Borat. Their relationship not
only pulls the audience away from
the smart satire but provides what is
possibly one of the most shockingly
offensive movie moments of the
millennium, potentially funny until

it moves too far into Jackass territo
ry. A plot also arises with Borat on
a search for Pamela Anderson, but
it all leads up to a climax that
doesn't really satisfy.
Borat is at its best when the
journalist is releasing chickens on
subway cars and inviting prosti
tutes to formal dinners while ex
posing the inequities of our society.
