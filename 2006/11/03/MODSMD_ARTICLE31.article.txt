## Let us bond with My Chemical Romance 
### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION ROMANTICIST 
New Jersey quintet My Chemical Romance
suffers from a unique problem. On the one
hand, they are exceptionally mature musicians,
with a healthy mix of formulaic and experi
mental songwriting and one of the more un
derrated guitarists in modern music (the afro
graced Ray Toro).
But on the other hand, they have an im
mense image problem, with their nu-goth
haircuts, clothing, and "Don't turn on the
lights, I just want to cry in the dark" lyrics and
attitude.
To put it briefly, these guys are a world-class
band stuck in the body of a whiny 14-year-old
covered in eye shadow and black clothes.
However, I implore you to set aside your ha
tred for Hot Topic mall punks and their tear
filled lifestyles and give this album a fair shake;
as a whole its far and away some of their best
work to date. {
Their third album. The Black Parade is a i
welcome step away from their previous offer-"
ings of screamy pop emo-rock that, while en
tertaining and popular, begged to be expanded
on. It seems the boys of MCR finally listened
and at least tried to come through with a little
more evolved sound.
The album kicks off with the partnered
tracks " The End" and "Dead!" which take the
listener through a very familiar tumult of bois
terous happy choral vocals and driving pop
rock instrumentation. A good sign to start off
the album is the punctuated prominence of
lead guitarist Ray Toro; featuring a few heavi
ly layered lead lines and a fantastic shredding

solo, it would appear that Toro has finally
stepped into the forefront that he's belonged in
since day one.

The album's title track and first single,
"Welcome to the Black Parade," starts off with
a primarily vocal and piano duet coupled to a
roaring lead guitar line that should make any
Queen fan do a double-take. It smoothly tran
sitions into another up-beat and driving rocker
with a catchy chorus reminiscent of "Helena"
off of their last album, Three Cheers for Sweet
Revenge.
The guys show off a much more refined
sound in songs like "The Sharpest Lives" and
"Sleep." These tracks display a much heavier
and much more mature songwriting style than

any of their previous work.
The songs are extremely a
tight rhyth jm

mically and melodically, and the multi-layered
choral work exhibits lead singer Gerard Way's
vocals much better than their past scream
filled offerings.

Like their previous albums. The Black Pa
rade is a concept album, following an unspeci
fied man merely referred to as "The Patient"
who died at a young age from an untimely can
cer. It goes without the saying that the lyrics are
dark, at best.
However, unlike their previous batches of
crappy wrist-slitting, MySpace poetry, these
lyrics show a much more mature Way at work,
at least most of the time; some of the messages
are still very teen angst ridden and foster fits of
giggles rather than any form of

compassion, but it's a step
k in the right direction.

Also included are

a few songs that are there, seemingly, to give the
album a little more sonic diversity are rock ballad
inspired acoustic works like "I Don't Love You"
which sounds like a fruitier and fluffier version of
all of their other songs. Also, "Cancer" comes off
sounding like a carbon copy of Jet's "Look What
You've Done," which albeit not being all that
original, isn't a bad song to mimic. These songs
aren't terrible, but they aren't great either. They
don't take advantage of the powerhouse song
writing that the rest of the CD exhibits and while
Toro's solo work is more than welcome, it's too
little too late in both cases.
Their more experimental side is showcased
in a plethora of songs, from the Slavic folk
styled "Mama" to the big-band swing sound of
"House of Wolves." While creative, these songs
come off as very all-over-the-place. They aren't
nearly as tight or refined as the others. They are,
however, welcome interjections that prove that
My Chemical Romance is doing their best to
break away from the genre that pop culture has
stuck them into and flex their muscle as musi
cians rather than as corporate robots.
Overall, The Black Parade is a major leap
forward for My Chemical Romance. Not only
have they made great strides in breaking their
emo-pop mold through progressively more
. complex and intricate songwriting, but they
J have also noticeably matured as musicians,
a writing more meaningful and powerful songs.

a few songs that are there, seemingly, to give the
album a little more sonic diversity are rock ballad
inspired acoustic works like "I Don't Love You"
which sounds like a fruitier and fluffier version of
all of their other songs. Also, "Cancer" comes off
sounding like a carbon copy of Jet's "Look What
You've Done," which albeit not being all that
original, isn't a bad song to mimic. These songs
aren't terrible, but they aren't great either. They
don't take advantage of the powerhouse song
writing that the rest of the CD exhibits and while
Toro's solo work is more than welcome, it's too
little too late in both cases.
Their more experimental side is showcased
in a plethora of songs, from the Slavic folk
styled "Mama" to the big-band swing sound of
"House of Wolves." While creative, these songs
come off as very all-over-the-place. They aren't
nearly as tight or refined as the others. They are,
however, welcome interjections that prove that
My Chemical Romance is doing their best to
break away from the genre that pop culture has
stuck them into and flex their muscle as musi
cians rather than as corporate robots.
Overall, The Black Parade is a major leap
forward for My Chemical Romance. Not only
have they made great strides in breaking their
emo-pop mold through progressively more
. complex and intricate songwriting, but they
J have also noticeably matured as musicians,
a writing more meaningful and powerful songs.
