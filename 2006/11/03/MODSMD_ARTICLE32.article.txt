# When your dad's more rock and roll than you are
## 
### NATE SOLON INTERMISSION DAD BAND EXPERT 
"Your dad is loving his band. I think he's
going to quit his job," said my mom. I laughed.
My dad is a professor of economics at a highly
respected university. "I'm not joking," she said.
For as long as I can remember, we've had a
drum set (rock and roll variety, purchased circa
1960) in my basement. Every so often, my dad
would disappear and a rhythmic racket would
waft up through the house. A few years ago he
started an economics parody band with his co
workers for the department skit night. So far, so
nerdy.
But things got weird when he started laying
down drum tracks for a band of three grad stu
dents. They call themselves S Apostrophe, or,
jovially, the Plural Possessive. Apparently they
liked his drum work, because he gradually be
came a full-fledged member of the band. A real,
actual band.
Ail those years of practice in our basement
actually made him quite good. It's almost as
though his entire adult life was nothing but an

elaborate gestation in preparation for this tri
umphant return to adolescence. Suddenly the
45-year-old co-workers waving tambourines in
our basement were replaced with indie-looking
20-somethings with real guitars and amps, who
chatted and drank beers while I paced around
upstairs. Every so often I had to stifle a strange
urge to scream down the stairs, "Will you kids

cut it the hell out?!"
Soon they were playing real gigs in real
venues, like the Blind Pig, which has hosted the
Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana, among oth
ers. About a month ago, they released their
debut CD, I Was Bom in the Dollar Store. Re
cently, they were featured on NPR's Open Mic.
They say it's a sad day when a father outlives
his son. When a father outcools his son, that's
downright depressing. Hie album is... well, it's
pretty good. When I tell people my dad's in a
band, I think they expect some sort of retro
rock. Maybe 70s covers, something like that.
But that's not the sort of music S Apostrophe
plays.
Or, for that matter, listens to. I thought I was
pretty cool when I discovered the Pixies in high
school, until I found all their CDs already neat
ly filed in my dad's collection. On their website
(www.sapostrophe.com) the band lists their in
fluences as Garrison Keillor, Paul McCartney,
Johnnie Walker, Frank Black and Zack- Morris.
When I played the album for my friends, Spoon
and the Shins came up.
The songs on Dollar Store range from rock

abilly hand-clapper "Yellow Fever!" to moodi
er melodies like "Whiskey & Robitussin." The
lyrics display a literary bent in their self-con
scious manipulation of language: "When the
pretense runs shallow / and the shadows creep
cross the floor, /1 sit at my window and watch
the wind blow / without a metaphor." But they
also let their hair down in non sequiturs held to
gether by unexpected rhymes: "We could ditch
purgatory if we wrote our life stories about
marzipan and broken glasses fresh-cut lawns re
cycled plastics car alarms the light fantastic old
red barns and new black caskets..."
Ultimately this album is about missed op
portunities, failed romances, the way life seems
to build you up and let you down. But the up
beat melodies and skewed humor keep it from
getting bogged down in its own ruminations.
You can sample S Apostrophe's music at

CD is for sale at their website (www.sapostro
phe.com) and in the iTunes Store. I urge you to
support the band, especially if my dad does go
through with quitting his job. My tuition isn't
paying itself.
