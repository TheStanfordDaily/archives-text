### ANDREA FULLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Long after his Stanford Law School
days of going for cheeseburgers and beer
at what he called "Zot's," Jeff Bingaman
became a Democratic senator in New
Mexico. Bingaman has been repeatedly
re-elected since his first victory in 1982.
He received his Bachelor's degree in
government from Harvard University
and came to Stanford for his law degree.
The senator married a law classmate,
Anne Kovacovieh, with whom he has one
son. He said his greatest accomplishment
at Stanford was "probably finding my wife
and marrying her."
Doug Barton, who attended Stanford
with Bingaman and currently practices
law in San Francisco, recalled how highly
Bingaman's peers thought of him.
"Jeff is an extraordinarily engaging
guy," Barton said. "He's got a great sense
of humor, very dry sense of humor, and he
was just a great friend and very widely ad
mired in our class."
Law classmate and friend Jim Holden,

also a lawyer in San Francisco, agreed
with Barton's sentiment.
"He's always had a self-effacing,
thoughtful, calm personality, and being a
Senator, he's still self-effacing, down-to
earth and has a thoughtful personality,"
he said. "That's really wonderful becaase
sometimes, I think power goes to the head
of those in Congress and the Senate, but
not for him."
Barton recalled that Bingaman
served as a Stern Resident Assistant, at a
time when law students could take the
job to earn extra money. Bingaman also
participated in mock trial activities.
"I was active in the moot court com
petition at the Law School," Bingaman
said. "We basically practiced appellate
arguments on different legal cases that
we brought up."
Barton remembered a classic moment
from one mock trial with Bingaman.
"I remember that there was a murder
case, and he represented the defease and I
represented the prosecution. I remember
as arguing before the jury of the Stanford
law students. He said 'surely you jest,' and

that was his characteri
zation of our argu
ment."
Law school bud
dies hung out at the
Dutch Goose.
"It was a beer es
tablishment," Barton

said. "It was a favorite hangout for Stan
ford students, and became one for the law
students in particular. We could go out and
drink beer and shoot some pool. We took
some road trips. We'd have long philo
sophical discussions. It was clear at that
time he was quite interested in politics, so
we talked about that a lot"
Holden noted that one such trip went
awry.
"I remember driving over to San Gre
gorio Beach, and the gas fumes almost
aborted Sen. Bingaman's life," he said.
"He was just getting gassed in the back
seat. The gas fumes were so bad that Sen
ator Bingaman was turning green in the
back seat."
Holden observed that Bingaman was
looking ahead to a political career.
"He was interested in politics at that time,
and I think he thought he would be a sena
tor. I'm not sure that any of the rest of us
thought he would be a senator just because

the chances are fairly remote."
Upon graduation. Bingaman returned
to New Mexico to practice law. becoming
New Mexico Attorney General in 1978. He
said that his choice of career stemmed from
a lifelong interest in politics.
"I had always been interested in politics
and government," Bingaman said. "Grow
ing up, I had an uncle who was very involved
in politics in New Mexico, not as a candidate,
but as an active party member. That sort of
piqued my interest as a young person."
Bingaman currently serves as tanking
member of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee. He has worked to
devote federal funds to solar energy re
search and recently introduced several bi
partisan bills to reduce the nation's depen
dence on oil and natural gas.
"I've tried in the Energy Committee
to move us toward more use of clean en
ergy in the country, more development
of alternative energy and more emphasis
on efficiency in the use of energy," he
said. "Also, I've been trying to get the
necessary support to begin controlling
greenhouse gas emission nationwide."
Bingaman serves as ranking member
of the Subcommittee on International
Trade on the Finance Committee. He is
also a Senior Member of the Joint Eco

nomic Committee, as well as a member of
the Subcommittee on Health Care and
the Subcommittee on Social Security and
Family Policy, and the Health. Educa
tion, Labor, and Pensions Committee.
"I've also spent a lot of time on health
care issues through the Finance Commit
tee and through the Health and Education
Committee, trying to expand access to
healthcare and resist cuts in healthcare
funding," Bingaman said. "And I've been
quite involved in trying to improve acade
mic standards in our schools."
Bingaman has been an advocate for
funding for Border Patrol agents, surveil
lance cameras and vehicle barriers. He
has worked to devote resources to youth
dropout prevention, drug courts and re
habilitation and treatment service. He
has condemned secrecy surrounding de
tained terrorist suspects and supports
due process as well as bans on degrading
prisoner treatment.
Polls predict Bingaman will easily win
re-election again in 2006, but he ex
pressed uncertainty about the success of
Democratic candidates in general.
"I don't think it's clear if we'll regain
control over the Senate or not," he said. "1
think we'll pick up seats, but I don't know
if we'll win a majority."
