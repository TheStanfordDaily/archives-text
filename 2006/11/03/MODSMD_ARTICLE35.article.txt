As an undergrad, Rep. David Was proudest
achievement was a weekly ritual. Upon finding out
that the medical school library opened at 8 a.m. on
Sundays, the future congressman resolved to study
there every weekend.
"No matter how late I stayed up, I made sure I was

there when the dcx>r opened," he said, 'it was my way of disciplining the
weekend."
Wu, a Democrat who represents Oregon's First District, sits on the
House Education Committee and the Science Committee.
After graduating from Stanford in 1977 with a B.S. in Biology, Wu at
tended Harvard Medical School before deciding to pursue a J.D. at Yale. He
represented Oregon's technology sector in its fast-developing Northwest re
gion and parlayed a decade of legal experience into a congressional win in
1998.
Recalling his favorite Stanford memory, the Congressman mentioned his
time as a photographer for The Daily but ultimately settled on a recollection
of the campus's vernal ambiance.
"Around the Stanford campus in the springtime, the birds sing into the
night and you can smell flowers all night long," he reminisced. "Sometimes
you're just cruising from one place to another and you have that scent in the
air. It still strikes me as the single coolest memory."
Wu is the only Taiwanese-American in Congress. He made the decision
to enter public service after a lifetime of seeing public decisions impact his
family. Wu's mother and her children had to wait six years to follow his father
to America due to restrictive immigration laws, arriving only after the system
was reformed by John F. Kennedy in 1961. At a p<x)r public high school in
southern California, he watched the rising costs of the University of Califor
nia schools deter many of his classmates from attending college.
Wu is widely expected to win his fifth term on Tuesday. He faces a re
election challenge from two-term Republican state legislator Derrick Kitts.
The Oregonian recently reported that Wu had his rival "outmatched," rais
ing $1.3 million in the election period ending September 30 to Kitts's
$210,000.
Nevertheless, the incumbent says he is taking the election very seriously.
"I've been pounding the pavement for a month and I'll be back in Oregon to
morrow," Wu said from Washington, where he celebrated his wife's birthday.
"I don't make predictions because I tend to be lousy at it,"he added.
"You take care of the fundamentals — you block, you tackle, you play as
hard as you can — then the score's the score when the clock runs out."
Although reluctant to call his own race, Wu was optimistic about the De
mocrats' chances nationally.
"This is probably the best prospect I've seen in my eight years of restor
ing real checks and balances to the system," he said.
After the election, the 109 th Congress will reconvene for its lame duck
session — a period for which Wu says he is "boundlessly optimistic."
His biggest project for that session is the shepherding of a healthcare in
formation technology bill through the Science Committee. The bill, Wu says,
would fund health care IT research, train experts in both Gelds and "start the
process of developing standards so that different computers can talk with
each other in the healthcare arena." He said it holds the possibility of reduc
ing some of the industry's spiraling costs by making information sharing
among medical institutions more efficient.
