### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Between late night talks with her room
mate and having trouble picking a major,
Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren's (D-CA)
Stanford experience was pretty typical.

But Lofgren, who earned a B.A. in political science in 1970 and
currently represents San Jose and California's 16th District in the
U.S. House of Representatives, also recalled experiences unique to
her generation.
One of Lofgren's most vivid Stanford memories was the tear
gassing of her dorm.
"It was the '60s, so it was a tumultuous time," she said. "There
were demonstrations on campus because the Vietnam War was
going on. In a lot of ways it was a frightening time."
Lofgren lived in Braruier Hall her freshman year, which was then
all-female housing. She described how the residents of Wilbur Hall,
all freshmen boys, "stormed Branner Hall in a traditional panty raid."
"1 think it was the last panty raid," she said. "The next year, there
were co-ed dorms and everything changed."
Although Lofgren acknowledged that her campus impact and
involvement were minimal —"I wasn't very much for joining
things," she said — she did study in Britain for six months.
While abroad, she worked with political science Prof. Ray Wolfin

ger, now at UC-Berkeley, to conduct the first public opinion p< >11 in the
Midlands, which she rated as one of her most valuable experiences at
Stanford.
"When 1 was there, they had a mansion in the middle of the
Midlands," she said. "It was definitely an interesting experi
ence."
Lofgren said that deciding to major in political science was "re
ally rather random."
"We weren't as organized as your generation," she said. "I'm the
first in my family to go to college, so I got a scholarship and I really
didn't know what I was doing. As I got closer to graduation, I real
ized I needed to pick a major, so I picked the one I had the most units
in, which was PoliSci."
Similarly, Lofgren's entry into politics was not premeditated.
"I just bursted into it after I graduated," she said. "I went to Wash
ington without a job or really even a plan. I just went there thinking 1
could do something to make a difference."
Lofgren said she talked herself into a job with her predecessor in
Congress and ended up working for him for eight years. While on
his staff, she went to law school and got involved in local govern
ment. After running for and holding offices in local government,
Lofgren ran for Congress.
Lofgren said that she and the rest of the Democratic representa
tives aren't taking anything for granted in next week's elections.
"I know a lot of people are saying that the Democrats will take
control [of Congress), and that is possible, but by no means certain,
she said. "If Democrats do regain the majority, we have a whole

agenda that we wish to deliver."
This agenda includes a new emphasis
on science and basic research in educa
tion, energy independence in 10 years
and full broadband deployment to every
section of the country within five years.
These goals comprise what Lofgren
called an "innovation agenda," a pro
gram Lofgren unveiled at Stanford a lit
tle over a year ago.
Lofgren, first elected to Congress in
1994, serves on the Committee on
Homeland Security, the Committee on
the Judiciary and the Committee on
I louse Administration. Many of her leg
islative initiatives have involved energy
and Internet access issues.
