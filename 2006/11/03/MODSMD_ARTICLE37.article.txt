### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Like many Stanford students. Congressman Adam Schiff (D
-CA) found it hard to define himself as either techie or a fuzzy.
Schiff, who represents the Pasadena area in California's 29th con
gressional district, graduated from Stanford in 1982 with a B.A. in Po
litical Science and having fulfilled all the premedical requirements.
"I figured that one interest would work itself out over the other [in
college], but it didn't work that way," Schiff said. "I took the MCAT
and the LSAT to try and figure out what I was going to do."
Schiff ultimately decided to forego medical school to attend
Harvard Law School. He served with the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Los Angeles and in the State Senate before his election to the
House of Representatives in 2000.
"I realized that when I read Time Magazine, I never flipped to the
' What's New In Medicine' section," Schiff said, explaining how he made
the decision between medical school and law schcx>l. "But I always
wanted to know what was going on in the world and in government.
"I thought medicine would be interesting and satisfying, but it
didn't get me as excited as issues of public policy," he added.
Schiff said that his time at Stanford gave him a good founda
tion for his political career.
"'Hie faculty taught me to have good analytical skills and how to

approach and solve problems," he said.
Schiff s Stanford experience was far
more than academic, however.
"The other students taught me not to
take myself Ux) seriously," he said. "Pub
lic service is preeminently a people job
and the kind of people skills you learn in
college, interacting with your classmates
— it's just great preparation, all of it."

Schiff said he enjoyed his time on the Crew team his freshman
year. "Being out on the water was really wonderful," he said,
though he recalled painful memories of running the Stadium stairs
with the team.
He also fondly remembered seeing Casablanca for the first time
at Memorial Auditorium and staying up late talking to dorm mates.
Schiff, like many former and current students, also recalled
"going to the library late at night and dozing off in those over
stuffed chairs."
"I arranged my classes so I could sleep-in in the morning," he
said. "1 enjoyed getting up late, living at Roble and enjoying the
sunshine outside by Lake Lagunita."
Schiff encouraged Stanford students to stop by his office and
visit if they ever find themselves on Capitol Hill.
As for this year's election, Schiff predicted victories for his
party.
"I think Election Night is going to be a tremendous night for

Democrats," Schiffsaid. "I think it will
give us a ehance to anchor the direction
of the country and employ the checks
and balances of the government."
If reelected. Schiff said he will con
tinue his focus on national security and
work to implement the recommenda
tions of the 9/11 Commission.
A member of the House Judiciary
Committee and the House International
Relations Committee, Schiff has also di
rected attention to public transportation,
education, and children's healthcare.
What else would Schiff like to see ac
complished in his next term in office?
"I'd like to see us win back the Axe."
he said.
