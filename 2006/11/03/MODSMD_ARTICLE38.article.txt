### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Representative Jim Kolbe, 64, now serving his
eleventh and final term in the House of Representatives,
was the first Republican elected to represent southern
Arizona. He completed an MBA at Stanford in 1967 and
then served in the United States Navy during the Viet
nam War, before serving as Arizona State Senator from
1976-82.
For Kolbe, his strongest memory of Stanford was his
first day on campus.
"I had not been on the Stanford campus before. I had
applied to Stanford for my undergraduate degree, been ac
cepted, but then chose to go to Northwestern for my 8.A.,"
Kolbe said. "So arriving at Stanford on a perfect Septem
ber Saturday with a football game in the afternoon brought
a huge dawning realization to me: I had spent four years in
the Chicago climate when I could have been at Stanford all
that time!"
Kolbe recalled taking advantage of campus life, so
much so that he deemed graduating his greatest achieve
ment at The Farm.
"I had such a good time and was so active in so many
activities that I proudly say I graduated from the Stanford
GSB in the top 95 percent of my class," Kolbe said.
Kolbe's introduction to public service was as a page
for Senator Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican nom
inee for president and long-time Arizona senator. His ex
periences at the University solidified his interest in both
public service and the political arena, since he was in
volved with campus politics and in Ronald Reagan's first
campaign for governor in 1966.

Kolbe left the University with "nothing hut great
memories."
"Stanford was a very important formative part of my
younger life," he said. "When I go back now, I long wist
fully for the days when there were actually citrus or
chards in Mountain View and Sunnyvale."
During his final term in the House, Kolbe said his main
priority was getting his Foreign Operations Appropria
tion enacted into law.
Analysts expect Kolbe's seat to fall into Democratic
hands after next Tuesday's election. The twilight of
Kolbe's career has been dimmed by the firestorm over
the Mark Foley scandal. Kolbe was chair of the page
board in 2000 and has said he passed on to the House
Clerk reports of Foley's advances on pages.
Kolbe is one of only a few MB As in Congress. I le was
a classmate of the current GSB dean Robert Joss.
"My fellow members of Congress think I'm nuts to
have an MBA from Stanford and not be out using it to
make money," Kolbe joked during a 2002 visit to campus.
"I'm proud of the degree and I use the skills I learned in
business school, but it didn't create a fast track to Wash
ington."
