### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
U.S. Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND)
would have aced PWR 2, as he is now known
as the chartmeister of the Senate. When
people talk about "Chart Man," as Republi
can Majority Whip Mitch McConnell calls

him, the first thing to come to
mind is his fiscal astuteness and
his prolific use of charts. In a re
cent 37-minute presentation,
he used 37 of them.
Conrad, the ranking Demo
crat on the Budget Committee,
was labeled this year as one of
the 10 best U.S. Senators.
Conrad, who graduated
with a B. A. in 1970, is a senior
senator who embodies proto
typical Stanford qualities. For
example, he is fiercely true to

his word in a way that would make the au
thors of the Fundamental Standard proud.
This virtue makes for a good hit of Senate
trivia: Conrad is the only person to hold
two Senate seats in one day.
How is that possible? In his 1986 cam
paign, Conrad vowed to voters that he
would not rerun for his Senate seat in 1992
should the federal deficit not fall by that
time. The deficit stayed put and true
to his word — but much to the chagrin of

North Dakota residents — Conrad did
not run for reelection.
In Sept. 1992, the state's senior senator
unexpectedly passed away. Because he
was not running for re-election, Conrad
ran for and won the seat. He was sworn in
Dec. 5, 1992 and resigned his other seat
later the same day. making him the only

person to hold two Senate
seats on the same day.
In his role on the Hud
get Committee, Conrad and
fellow Democrats unsuc
cessfully fought to prevent
the Hush administration
from raising the U.S. debt
limit to $9 trillion and from
passing a $2.8 trillion budget
that has been projected to
increase the deficit to at least
$350 billion this year.
Conrad stays closest to

his alma mater's roots in his amiability ;uid abil
ity to appeal to voters. Despite representing a
traditionally Republican state, his appri >val rat
ing in August was 74 percent, the highest in the
U.S. Senate. He faces no serious challenge in
his quest for reelection next Tuesday.
He graduated from Philips Exeter
Academy in 1966 and earned his masters
in business from George Washington Uni
versity after leaving The Farm. Conrad is
the only Unitarian in the U.S. Senate.
