# Edwards passes the torch
## After career-ending injury, Edwards imparts experiences to Ostrander 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
October 14 was one of the darkest days in
Stanford football history. Not only did the
Cardinal fall to the second-worst team in the
Pacific-10 conference in a 20-7 loss to Ari
zona, they set a school record for offensive
futility in the process.
But what that day will likely be remem
bered for the most, is that it was the last time
that Trent Edwards would play a down for
Stanford. What started off as a promising ca
reer on the Farm four years ago, came to an
end on that sunny Saturday when the fifth
year senior quarterback fractured the
sesamoid bone in his foot trying to escape
the Wildcat pass rush on the first offensive
series of the game.

At the time, it was unclear whether the
four-yard scramble to the right would be the
official end to the Trent Edwards Era. With
out their senior leader at the helm, the Stan
ford offense went on to gain 44 yards the rest
of the game.
"Whenever I get hurt, I feel like I'm let
ting the team down by not being out there
and not being able to play," Edwards said.
"Everyone counts on me to be out there. For
me to not be able to help my team out —
and based on how the game went that day —
it was extremely difficult. It was homecom
ing, too. Every year you see the tents set up
on campus and know that if there is ever a
game to show off your skills as a player and
show what the offense can do. you want to
do it that weekend. That was just another
factor to add in on how tough that day was."

Just days later, the official word came
down that Edwards' college career was
over. 1 lis right foot would require significant
rest and rehabilitation if it was going to heal
properly. After throwing for 5,429 yards and
37 touchdowns in a Stanford uniform, Ed
wards became a spectator.
"I've told people before that it has been a
roller-coaster ride," Edwards said. "It has
had some highs and a few more lows than I'd
anticipated. I've changed a lot as a person
and that's what I focus on. I feel like I'm a
better football player, certainly, but I 'm also
a better person and a better teammate. I lad
we won every single game over the last four
years. 1 don't honestly know if 1 could be
telling you that right now. It has truly been a

Trent Edwards may have finished his Stanford playing career, but he still hopes to contribute by
mentoring his former backup, T.C. Ostrander. Ostrander will have to lead the Card into next year.
humbling experience.!
Edwards finished his career never hav
ing played in a howl game. He never beat
Cal. He was recruited by one coach and
played under two more. In retrospect, how
ever. Edwards said the hardships have
made him the person, and the football play
er. he is today.
"The Axe hasn't been in that case since
I've been here," Edwards said. "The school
that I was going to go to [UCLA] has shut us
out twice in the last three years. That stuff
starts to eat at you. What I've done is that I
haven't settled for being an average, com
placent football player. The struggles have
motivated me. Had we beaten UCLA or
had we had the Axe, but there was another
quarterback playing in front of me and I
didn't have to prove anything — that's not
the way I would have wanted it. I think I
would have rather lost those games and be
come a better football player and a better
person."
Now, on crutches and with his right foot
in a medical boot, Edwards must find new
ways to contribute. At the heart of his off
field responsibilities is helping redshirt jun
ior T.C. Ostrander take the reins.
"I've been out there and I know a lot
about what T.C. is thinking on certain plays,
because I've been there in those situations."
Edwards said. "I know he doesn't need an
other coach or another person in his ear —

he has plenty of those. I am just there as a
mentor. If something goes wrong I'll be
there to let him know that he is a good
enough player to get the job done."
This is not Ostranderis first chance as
Stanfordi's starter under center. As a red
shirt freshman in 2004, the Atherton, Calif.-
native started a pair of games against Ore
gon State and Cal while Edwards was out
with an injury.This time around, Ostrander
says he is more prepared for the responsi
bility.
"I think I am more able to handle start
ing," Ostrander said. "I have a much better
idea about what to expect. My approach to
the game is a lot better now than it was
when I was a redshirt freshman."
His task as starting quarterback goes
beyond lining up in the backfield. He must
also take over much of the leadership role
that Edwards played both on and off the
field. With the team 0-8 and facing USC
this weekend, that will not be an easy task.
But Ostrander says that despite the strug
gles thus far, the team has far from given
up.
"Given how the season has gone and
how disappointing it has been, the team ac
tually has a pretty positive attitude," Os
trander said. "No one is throwing in the
towel. We are all trying to win every game
and trying to get better. That is really all we
can do."

In his one start since Edwards' injury,
Ostrander struggled in a 38-3 loss to Ari
zona State. He finished 7-for-25 passing
with 66 yards, one interception and no
touchdowns.
But unlike in 2004, when Edwards was
a sophomore and still clearly the leader of
the future, this time around Ostrander's as
signment is long term — take over the of
fense for the final games of this season and
lead the turnaround in 2007.
"1 wouldn't say that anybody is actively
doing anything this year to affect next year,
but we're 0-8. Obviously things aren't going
well," Ostrander said. "But if guys said 'This
is not working. I'm not going to put any ef
fort into it,' it would hurt us next year, too.
These last four games have to be looked at
as an opportunity to get better."
Despite the immediate anguish that has
come with losing ten straight games, Os
trander believes that the travails of 2006
will lead to a tougher, battle-tested team in
the future.
"A lot of the guys that are on the team
now are going to be on the team next year,"
Ostrander said. "They are going to have to
remember this experience. We're not going
to a bowl game. We are still trying to win
games, but almost more than that we're try
ing to make everybody a better football
player. By doing that we'll set ourselves up
better for the future."
