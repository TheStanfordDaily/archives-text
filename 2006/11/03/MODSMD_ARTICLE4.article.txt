# Edwards passes the torch
## After career-ending injury, Edwards imparts experiences to Ostrander 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
October 14 was one of the darkest days in
Stanford football history. Not only did the
Cardinal fall to the second-worst team in the
Pacific-10 conference in a 20-7 loss to Ari
zona, they set a school record for offensive
futility in the process.
But what that day will likely be remem
bered for the most, is that it was the last time
that Trent Edwards would play a down for
Stanford. What started off as a promising ca
reer on the Farm four years ago, came to an
end on that sunny Saturday when the fifth
year senior quarterback fractured the
sesamoid bone in his foot trying to escape
the Wildcat pass rush on the first offensive
series of the game.

At the time, it was unclear whether the
four-yard scramble to the right would be the
official end to the Trent Edwards Era. With
out their senior leader at the helm, the Stan
ford offense went on to gain 44 yards the rest
of the game.
"Whenever I get hurt, I feel like I'm let
ting the team down by not being out there
and not being able to play," Edwards said.
"Everyone counts on me to be out there. For
me to not be able to help my team out —
and based on how the game went that day —

on campus and know that if there is ever a
game to show off your skills as a player and
show what the offense can do. you want to
do it that weekend. That was just another
factor to add in on how tough that day was."

Just days later, the official word came
down that Edwards' college career was
over. 1 lis right foot would require significant
rest and rehabilitation if it was going to heal
properly. After throwing for 5,429 yards and
37 touchdowns in a Stanford uniform, Ed
wards became a spectator.
"I've told people before that it has been a
roller-coaster ride," Edwards said. "It has
had some highs and a few more lows than I'd
anticipated. I've changed a lot as a person
and that's what I focus on. I feel like I'm a
better football player, certainly, but I 'm also
a better person and a better teammate. I lad
we won every single game over the last four
years. 1 don't honestly know if 1 could be
telling you that right now. It has truly been a

Trent Edwards may have finished his Stanford playing career, but he still hopes to contribute by
mentoring his former backup, T.C. Ostrander. Ostrander will have to lead the Card into next year.
