### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR)
started college at the Universi
ty of C alifornia, Santa Barbara.
But when he got a chance to
come to The Farm for free, he
snapped it up.
"I started at the University
of California at Santa Barbara
on a basketball scholarship
with the delusion I could play
in the NBA," said Wyden, at a
speech in April. "When reali-

ty set in. my mom had gotten a job as a librarian at Stanford,
and I transferred there. As a child of a Stanford employee,
1 was able to go to that fantastic college tuition-free. I saved
some more money by living at home."
He graduated from Stanford in 1971 with a degree in po
litical science. He was elected to the Senate in 19%, after
seven terms in the House. He was reelected in 2004 and will
be on the ballot in 2010 if he chooses to seek reelection.
Wyden is on the Finance, Intelligence, Energy and
Natural Resources and Budget committees. He also
works with the Special Committee on Aging, having at
one time taught gerontology.
Wyden is one of a few senators to publicly support
same-sex marriage. He is pro-choice and well-liked by
environmental protection groups. The senator has been
highly critical of the war in Iraq, having originally voted
against the use of military force. The Democrat is critical
of the estate tax and has proposed a "Fair Flat Tax Act."
On the Intelligence Committee, Wyden made a fuss
when the wiretapping program came to light. The Senate
Select Intelligence Committee member told The Daily in
February that he wanted a "new accountability."
"I've got an election certificate to be something other
than a potted plant," said Wyden at the time. "I have a
constitutional responsibility for oversight."
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn, a constitutional law
expert who retired in 1979 and died in 2002, was one of the
key figures that inspired Wyden to go into public service.
Horn was known as a conservative and traditionalist on a
predominantly liberal political science faculty.
"What was most important was that you thought and
you could arrive at a position you could support and de
fend," Wyden told The Daily at the time. "To this day, I can
hear his voice for approaching issues in a thoughtful way."
