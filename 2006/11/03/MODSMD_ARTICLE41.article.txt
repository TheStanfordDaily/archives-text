### ERIC SHOWEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has
earned the reputation as being
one of the Senate's most effective
lawmakers. Widely considered
the matriarch of California poli
tics, the senior senator from the
Golden State has enjoyed a sto
ried political career sp;inning five

decades at the local and national levels.
Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in a 1992
special election. In 14 years in Congress's upper
chamber, Feinstein has earned a reputation as a
pragmatic voice of reason amidst the divisive rancor
of Capitol Hill. Though a staunch supporter of such
traditional liberal causes as gun control and abor
tion rights, Feinstein has gained respect from both
sides of the aisle for her willingness to seek political
compromise and bipartisan solutions.
A San Francisco native, Feinstein graduated
from the University in 1955 with a degree in History.
At Stanford, Feinstein served as president of Roble

Hall, and was later elected vice president of the stu
dent body.
"Dianne was such a lovely person to everyone,"
recalled alumna Carole Cole, who lived with Fein
stein as a freshman in Roble. "It was obvious to all
of us that she was going to be a leader."
Feinstein first held major political office in 1969,
when she was elected to the S.in Francisco Board of
Supervisors. She became mayor when, as the presi
dent of the Board of Supervisors, Mayor George
Mosoone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassi
nated in Nov. 1978. In doing so, Feinstein became the
first female mayor of a large American city. She was
thereafter reelected to two full terms.
Feinstein inspired significant praise and in
curred some criticism from Democratic pundits
for her decision not to enter the gubernatorial re
call election of 2003, a race many believed she
would win. Feinstein had survived a 1984 recall at
tempt in her own right as San Francisco mayor.
Feinstein Ls thought to have been considered as a
running mate by then-Vice President A 1 Gore during
his run for the presidency in2ooo, before Gore settled
on Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman.

As a long-serving senator, Feinstein is privi
leged to serve on five permanent committees. As
the only female on the Judiciary Committee, she
garnered close attention for her deliberation dur
ing the confirmation hearings of Chief Justice
John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, Jr. Fein
stein ultimately voted against both nominees.
Feinstein invoked her time at the University
during the Roberts hearing, when she insisted that
the nominee take a firm position on abortion.
"As a college student at Stanford. 1 watched
the passing of the plate to collect money so a
young woman could go to Tijuana for a back-alley
abortion," she said.
Feinstein was the Democratic sponsor of a failed
Constitutional Amendment to ban flag-burning
this summer. Though her championing of this issue
angered some liberal supporters and First Amend
ment advocates, the fallout surrounding the failed
amendment does not seem to have affected Fein
stein's support among the general electorate.
With the Nov. 7 midterm elections only four
days away, Feinstein appears poised to win her
third full term. She leads Republican challenger
Richard Mountjoy by wide margins in opinion
polls and fundraising. and has devoted much time
to campaigning on behalf of other California
politicians.
