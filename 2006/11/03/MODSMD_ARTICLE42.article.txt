### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
By the time Max Baucus (D-MT) left the
Farm in 1967, he had seven years and two de
grees under his belt. But even while here,
Baucus' ambition exceeded even a place like
Stanford.
"I was a student at Stanford University,"
he said in an address in New Delhi last Janu-

ary. "I wanted to learn more about other countries. But I did not get as
much out of Stanford's six-month program in Tours, France, as I had
hoped. So I decided to hitch-hike around the world."
That ambition followed him as he left the Law School and moved
into private legal practice. He soon decided to pursue public service and
was elected to the Montana State Legislature in 1973.
Then, just one year later, Baucus found himself on Capitol Hill, hav
ing been elected in 1974 as a U.S. Representative. In 1978, only 11 years
after receiving his law degree from Stanford, he was elected to the 1 Jnit
ed States Senate as the junior senator from Montana.

He has served in that position since and is currently the ranking De
mocratic member on the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance.
But even as he became immersed in the struggles of Capitol Hill,
Baucus did not forget this University on the other coast.
When Political Science Prof. Robert Horn died in 2002. Baucus re
membered him as a crucial figure in his life.
"He changed my life. I would not have gone into the Senate without
him," Sen. Baucus told The Stanford Report. "His course was so fasci
nating; it taught me how we Americans organize a society. Looking
back, it was the main reason I went to law school. I carry the [U.S.] Con
stitution with me every day. I've been hooked [on the subject] ever
since."
Sen. Baucus is considered by some as a conservative Democrat, fre
quently breaking with the party line on some issues.
In 1999, for example, Sen. Baucus was the only Democrat to vote
against an amendment that aimed to "regulate the sale of firearms at
gun shows." He also voted for President Bush's 2001 tax cuts and has
since opposed efforts to repeal portions of that law.
On social issues, Baucus stands firmly liberal. He is pro-choice and
has received a 1 (X) percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America.
He also swings to the left on environmental issues, opposing drilling in
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
In his spare time, he enjoys riding his motorcycle through the Mon
tana countryside.
