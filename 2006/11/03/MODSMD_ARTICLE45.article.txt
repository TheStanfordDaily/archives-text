### ERIC SHOWEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Rep. Daniel Lipinski is in his first
term representing lllinois's 3rd Con
gressional District, yet he enjoys wide
spread name recognition in the nation's
fifth most populous state.
Lipinski, an assistant professor of po
litical science at the University of Ten
nessee, was elected in 2(X)4 to succeed his
father, powerful 11-term Congressman
William Lipinski. Though he entered the
2004 race only after his father's resigna
tion in August, Lipinski soared to 74 per
cent of vote in this heavily Democratic
southwest Chicago district.
Lipinski earned an M.S. in Engineer
ing-Economic Systems at the University
in 1989 after completing undergraduate
work in Mechanical Engineering at
Northwestern University. As one of
only 11 members of Congress with an
academic background in engineering,
Lipinski is well-suited for his present
role on the House Science Committee.
Lipinski also serves on the Small Busi
ness Committee.
Though he had not held political office

prior to assuming his current position, Lip
inski served on four separate congression
al staffs prior to entering academia, includ
ing those of current Illinois Gov. Rod
Blagojevich and former House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt.
Lipinski's politics have largely paral
leled those of his father. The current rep
resentative is an economic populist who
aligns with the right on many social issues.
Lipinski has been known to take pride in
branding himself a "Reagan Democrat."
Lipinski wrote his doctoral disserta
tion at Duke University on how mem
bers of Congress communicate with
constituents. Though the jury is still out
on whether Lipinski will succeed in
doing so with his own constituents, early
indications seem promising.
