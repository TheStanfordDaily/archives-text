# Inside The Game: Going Deep
## 
### 
Southern California fell behind 33-
10 against Oregon State, but
climbed within two points with a flurry
of big plays in the final 20 minutes.
Quarterback John David Booty (10)
got the Trojans within 8 points with a
37-yard fourth-quarter touchdown
pass. Receiver Steve Smith (2) flexed
out to the right side. Cornerback
Brandon Hughes (36) never even
looked at flanker Patrick Turner (1),
and instead shadowed Smith up the
field. Safety Sabby Piscitelli (24) at
tempted to apply inside leverage.
Neither man fazed Smith, who ran
right past both defenders, caught the
ball at the 8 and sped into the end
zone untouched. The absence of
Reggie Bush and the injury problems
of Dwayne Jarrett (8) have led to the
emergence of Smith as the big-play
man for USC, and he looked the part
against the Beavers with 11 catches
for 258 yards.
