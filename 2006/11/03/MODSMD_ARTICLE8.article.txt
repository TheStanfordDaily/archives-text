# Campus Activism Diminished
## Midterm elections elicit lower voter registration, volunteering for campus Dems, GOP 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the lead-up to the election two years ago.
Stanford students crammed White Plaza daily with
tables and speakers, and some traveled as far as
Nevada and Ohio to promote voter turnout ef
forts. But this fall, fewer competitive races, lower
issue awareness and dampened idealism have less
ened student participation in political organiza
tion — with the country now just four days away
from midterm elections.
The Stanford Democrats, the largest political

group on campus, has experienced a significant
drop in overall membership since 2(M)4.'lTie organ
ization registered fewer students to vote and had
one-tenth as many voter registration volunteers as
it did during the presidential election.
Stanford Democrats President Bobby Lepore,
a senior, argued that the decline could be partly at
tributed to the enormous success of the group's
2004 voter registration drive, which left a smaller
pool of potential voters to target this time around.
For its part, the Stanford College Republicans
have experienced a severe membership decline.
The group did not hold its first meeting of the aca

deniic year until Monday, effectively mitigating
any impact the group could have on any races or
registration.
Kai Stinchcombe. a 2005 graduate who was
president of the Stanford Democrats during the
2004 election, said that while students are politi
cally active, overall participation may have dipped
because less is at stake.
"Back then, if Kerry won, he could push an
agenda through," Stinchcombe said. "Right now,
even if Democrats win big, we will have a divided
government. There's going to be no
clean break here, no decisive rejec
tion of the past and change of
course."
College Republicans President
Megan Reiss, a senior, said that stu
dents were more active during the
2004 election because of its con
tentious, head-to-head quality.
"No matter what state students
hailed from, they had a common can
didate. Bush or Kerry, to get behind,"
Reiss said. "This election is just as
important, but students are support
ing candidates from the states where
they vote."
Lepore defended the Democrats'
election season effort and said that
many students were excited about
participating in progressive politics.
I le highlighted several of the group's
accomplishments, including the suc
cessful registration of 125 new vot
ers. And Lapore emphasized that
lower activism during midterm elec
tions is nothing new.
"1 think it's partly because
midterm elections in general just
generate less enthusiasm than presi
dential elections, not only among

students but also among the public at
large," he said. ---
Nevertheless, Lepore said that
President Bush's victory in the 2004
election might have tempered the
optimism of progressive students.
"Iliere's probably an extent to
which our generation of progressives
is a bit discouraged," he said. "That's
not to say that people care any less
deeply about the issues at stake, just
that there might be more people who
doubt their ability to make a differ
ence."
Former Stanford Democrats
President Marie Jonas, a senior, said
that in spite of past disappointments,
the Dems are cautiously hopeful.
"I think we're less pessimistic be
cause we have less to lose," she said.
"We're also just excited because we
have people actually telling us that
we could win an election."
But not all campus political
groups have fallen victim to midterm
election malaise. With Proposition
85 on the ballot, a measure that
would require minors to notify their
parents before obtaining an abor
tion. Students for Choice remains as
active as ever, said President Mishan
Araujo, a junior.
'ITie group is cosponsoring a rally
today with State Controller Steve
Westly and gubernatorial candidate
Phil Angelides, both Democrats, to

galvanize opposition to the measure.
Students for Life President Mary
Ho declined to comment, citing the
non-partisan identification of her or
ganization.
On the whole, Stinchcombe
agreed that students may not be as
politically active as they were in
2(X)4. but added that this might re
flect a defection by students who
have sought alternative paths to
change the system from the bottom
up through issue activism and policy
making.
"After 2(X)4. lots of people sort of
said,' Gee, it looks like we have a lot
of work to do,'" he said. "And so you
see people being involved in things
like human rights and the Constitu
tion, or science in public schools.
People don't believe in a silver bullet
anymore. We're in it for the long
haul, and 1 think that's a good thing."
