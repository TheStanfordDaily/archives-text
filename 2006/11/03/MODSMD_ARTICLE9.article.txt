### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
Policymakers and scientists de
scended on The Farm yesterday to
kickoff a new climate change policy
initiative between top California
universities, urging scientists to be
clear and succinct in their interac
tions with legislators.
The conference marked the of
ficial start of the Inter-University
Scholars Program: Engaging with
California Government on Cli
mate Change, which unites scholars
from Stanford, UC-Berkeley and
UC-Davis with "trainers." whose
goal is to educate them on how to
communicate effectively with poli
cymakers.
"By better understanding when,
how and why policymakers use re
search. we hope to create more ef
fective policy interactions and bet
ter policy." explained Linda Shuck,
the California Climate Change
Project (CCCP) director of the
Woods Institute for the Environ
ment.
"We anticipate that the scholars
will be called by policymakers for
advice and when the researchers
provide information and counsel, it
will be in a manner easily under
stood and used," she said.
The program, a joint effort of
the CCCP and the Woods Insti
tute's Leadership andTraining Pro
gram. selected five scholars from
each of the three schools in diverse
fields related to climate change. In
the coming months, the scholars
will meet at Stanford. Berkeley and
the state capitol with trainers such
as former California state legislator
Byron Sher and Arthur Rosenfeld,
commissioner of the California En

ergy Commission.
Lite kickoff began with a
keynote address by state assembly
member Ira Ruskin (D-Redwood
City). In his speech, Ruskin com
mended the scholars for their hard
work and expressed great hopes for
the future partnership.
"I'm very excited, and I think 1
speak on behalf of many policy
makers. very excited that you
have chosen to engage in this task
and that the Inter-University
Scholars Program exists," Ruskin
said.
"There is a great gulf between
those who are trained in science
and those who are not. If more peo
ple were trained in science or un
derstood it deeply, we could not
have an administration that's say
ing that global warming is not hap
pening," he said. "And that's just
the tip of the iceberg, and that ice
berg is melting."
The event also featured Adri
enne Alvord. principal consultant
for assembly member Fran Pavley
(D-Agoura Hills) and Bart Croes.
Air Resources Board Research di
vision chief.
Alvord briefed the audience
on the recent Global Warming So
lutions Act, in which California
has pledged to reduce emissions
drastically in a half-decade long
plan. She emphasized that legisla
tors are currently looking to re
searchers to help them under
stand the economics of a conver
sion to a low-carbon economy,
how climate change is affecting
California and which technologies
show the most promise. For the
scholars specifically, she urged
keeping the information easy to
understand.
"When talking to legislators,
don't put anything in words more
complicated than a Reader's Di
gest article," she said. "That's not
because legislators are stupid, we
just don't have the time to read all
the way through your reports.
