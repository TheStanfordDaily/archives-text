crucial issues like educa
tion policies and global

warming. Over the past year, he

has demonstrated a willingness to

compromise that seems to be more than
just a gimmick, lie deserves another term

as governor.
But let's begin with his flaws: He has
made loutish comments that were meant
to pass for humor. I le antagonized the leg
islature and then tried to go over its head
by calling a special election. I le has accept
ed far too much money from special inter
ests and done little to curb their influence
after making the issue a central focus of his
recall election campaign. Most seriously,
he has not been loud enough as a voice of
compromise on issues like national securi
ty and the war in Iraq, although he has
avoided the poisonous rhetoric of national
party leaders. Schwarzenegger prefers to
immerse himself in the economy rather
than debate the war. But his speech sup
porting President Bush at the 2004 Repub
lican National Convention is remembered
bitterly by many in the center and on the
left for blindly singing the praises of a ma
lignant and incompetent administration.
The focus of the War on Terror is the defin
ing issue of our time, and Schwarzenegger
cannot continue to hold himself above the
fray.
But since the humbling defeat of his
special election propositions in 2005. the
governor has begun to admit his mistakes
in other areas, and he has been working
well with Democratic legislators. His ap
pointment of Democrat Susan Kennedy
as his chief of staff was a masterstroke
that led to a more balanced focus on the

issues. He has allocated more money for
stem cell research, supported a raise in
the minimum wage and agreed on a bill to
reduce the state's greenhouse gas emis
sions by twenty five percent over the

next twenty years. Some Democ
rats point out that opposing

candidate Phil Angelides
would support the same
kinds of measures and

perhaps even go turther in
some areas. They ask, "It
you like Schwarzenegger
for acting like a Democ-

rat. why not just elect a
Democrat?" We would re
spond that Schwarzeneg-

ger does not behave like a

Democrat but like an inde
pendent. The main reason for

moderates of both parties to vote for
him is that he has the ability to convince
people on the other side of a debate, a
skill that is sorely needed today.
State Treasurer Phil Angelides was not
a good alternative to Schwarzenegger. He
won a divisive and negative primary
against the more centrist Steve Westly by
four points, and Angelides's lackluster
campaign makes us yearn for the man he
defeated. Angelides's policy ideas are
hardly distinguished. Warmed-over pro
posals like middle-class tax cuts, tax in
creases for the upper crust and increased
education funding have failed to inspire
Democrats, much less independents. His
campaign has taken almost no risks and
his rhetoric is uninspiring. Overall, he
sounds more like a policy wonk than a
leader, and obviously lacks the Holly
wood charisma of Arnie. We don't love
our current governor, but the alternative
is far more uninspiring. Why does the Cal
ifornia Democratic Party keep running
this type of candidate when other Democ
rats around the country are running bold
campaigns that focus on character and
leadership?
For his part. Schwarzenegger needs to
know that more will be expected from him
this time around. If he regresses back into
"girlie men talk or hides inside an eco
nomic cocoon, he will find his recent ad
vances disappear like so many tracks in the
sand. He needs to be a true independent,
even if he there is still an "R" next to his
name.
