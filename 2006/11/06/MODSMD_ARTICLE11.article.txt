Sasha Baron Cohen is funny, but Ins
movie, "Borat," is not. Let me tell you
why.
A few years ago, a close friend of mine
was taking a class on human rights. For her
final research project, she wrote about fe
male circumcision (the mutilation of the fe
male genitalia to remove pleasure from sex
ual activity), which is practiced in parts of
Africa with "culture" and "tradition" in
voked in its defense. Paying a visit one day, I
found her alone and in a truly foul mood. Re
sponding to my inquiries, she finally ex
plained."! feel like women all over the world
are made to suffer because of men. Men ben
efit from this suffering, and they don't do
anything to confront it — they usually don't
even recognize that their unfair advantage is
a problem. It's beyond the challenge of as
signing women equal rights. It's about assign
ing them human dignity, and at the moment,
I don't think that men. as a whole, even con
sider women to be human by their standards.
How can there be any discussion alter that?"
There cannot be. Then as now. I can say
nothing to address this objection except to
admit that the shameful number of men
who fight to build a more gender-equitable
world is shameful. Quite apart from the fact
that many men's interests in women are ex
clusively limited to their sexual potential, a
dishearteningly high proportion of male
culture has come to view "Feminism" as
synonymous with some imaginary, radical
and anti-man Aphrodite cult. As is so com
mon, this indeterminate and completely im
plausible conceptualization is more accessi
ble to the uninitiated than the actual mean
ing of the Feminist Movement, which is (so
much more simply!) justice for women.
Maybe this seems too abstract without
something to ground us in the problem, 112 e
male circumcision — ok. that's bad, but
that's also one of those "African problems."
Maybe Feminism is too. right'.' Maybe it
only applies to. say. Africa or the Middle

Hast, to some array of overtly foot-binding
countries that look different from us and
that aren't, as Borat says we are, very "nice"
Maybe not. Last week in Georgia an
Fthiopian immigrant was sentenced to 10
years in prison for mutilating the genitals of
his two year-old daughter with a pair of scis
sors in the United States' first case of female
circumcision. And this weekend I sat in a
112 ully packed movie theater — in the heart of
well-educated Silicon Valley — with a young
audience that howled with laughter when
Mr. Baron Cohen's character. Borat. joked
about the time his mentally-challenged
brother broke out of his cage and raped his
sister. Ihe case of the girl from Georgia is a
tragedy, whereas "Borat" is merely a traves
ty, but what they both demonstrate is that
feminism, the pursuit of equal rights for
women and their essential prerequisite of fe
male human dignity, is not an "over-there"
issue. Nor is it a question of personal decency
and inter-gender conduct. In this century, we
must think of women's rights globally.
Why take out so much indignation on Mr.
Baron Cohen's new movie? After all, the man
is a comedian, and it's only satire. To me this
question is the same as."why should we be of
fended. why should we take Feminism seri
ously?" I'm sure there are volumes upon vol
umes of studies relating to the bad public
image that Feminism has acquired, e.g., it's a
girls-only club, it's whiny and unproductive or
the ever-popular "subtle lesbian conspiracy"
