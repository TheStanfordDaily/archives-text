# How to go to L'Opera
## 
### 
So you want to go to the opera. Or maybe
you don't. Maybe this is a rhetorical de
vice to begin a column, and it doesn't re
ally matter. Anyway, let's assume that you
have some kind of interest in fancy clothing,
people screaming in foreign languages and
driving to San Francisco and let's go from
there.
The first thing you're going to want to do
is learn a foreign language. I recommend Ital
ian. since it means you can say "Ciao!" to
people and study abroad in Florence. You
could also learn German, but if you say
"Ciao!" to people in Germany, some rough
youths will probably beat you up.
As for the opera house, yes, they will prob
ably have translations scrolling across a mar
quee at the top of the stage, but you want to
do this properly. At a pivotal moment during
the opera, you want to be able to lean across
to your date and say smugly, "Actually, the
correct translation of that would be 'to mean
der' rather than 'to walk,"' so that he or she
can appreciate what a pretentious
douchebag you are.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Be
fore you get to the opera house,you are going
to need to buy something called a "ticket."
This may seem intimidating, especially since
there are so many different kinds — grand
tier, dress circle, balcony, box seats — but it's
not actually all that difficult to figure out. It's
really a question of visibility and its attenuat
ing cost. Can you really put a price on being
able to see the expression of torment on the
soprano's face? If you can. then you're prob
ably not rich enough to buy box seats.
No, you look like the kind — no offense
— who would be sitting in the "balcony" or

"nosebleed" section. Its OK. you can com
fort yourself with the fact that all the people
buying box seats will probably enjoy a better
view, but they will also pay dearly for the
privilege. On the other hand, they can proba
bly afford it. while your trip to the opera will
probably cost you several months' worth of
ramen.
Once you've got all that taken care of, try
to obtain some form of transportation. Now.
you have two options here: you can take a
gas-guzzling, fuel inefficient car. or you can
take the Caltrain.The car will probably take
longer, and you'll have to donate plasma so
that you have enough money to pay for park
ing. On top of that, you'll have to negotiate
San Francisco's curved streets in the middle
of the night, and you will be killing the envi
ronment as you go. Your other option is the
Caltrain. with all the freshmen.
Car it is. then.
Be sure to allot yourself plenty of time to
deal with the uncertain Bay Area traffic, and
make sure you have games to play with the
other people in the car. like "Would you
rather" or "Marry, Fuck, Kill." A quick warn
ing, though: if you are in a car with people you
don't know that well, you may not want to
make an inappropriate joke about, say. rap

ing a baby. It's going to be a long enough ride
back without the awkward silence.
And then here you are, finally! The opera
house. It's beautiful, isn't it? And all you have
to do is find your seat, sit back and enjoy the
opera. Walk up, past the grand tier, the box
seats, the orchestra premium seats, the dress
circle. Keep going. 1 leave yourself to the bal
cony. finally, your breath short from all those
flights of steps. Join the other unwashed
masses as you try to find your seats. Marvel at
how high up you are and the steepness of the
incline, and try to stitle your sense of vertigo.
But then, the opera starts. And you forget
about all of that. Yes. the baritone is the size
ot Polly Pocket down there, but you lean for
ward. the voice carries, the set sings, the or
chestra swells and it doesn't even matter.
Until you lean forward just a little too
much.
You lose your balance, tumbling over into
the balcony seats in front of you. You pick up
speed and other opera-goers like a growing
snowball, faster and faster, until you reach
the end of the balcony and are all flung into
the air, like a ball at the bottom of a slide. You
hang poised in the air for a moment until you
drop onto the orchestra seats far below.
Your last conscious thought will probably
be admiration at how beautiful the opera is
trom down here, and isn't that the point of
going in the first place?

Sini didn't actually start a terrifying human
snowball that crushed everyone below, but she
did enjoy I he Barber of Seville with her friends
front C asa. She hopes that someday, they won t
be afraid to go with her again. You can e-mail

probably cost you several months' worth of
ramen.
Once you've got all that taken care of, try
to obtain some form of transportation. Now.
you have two options here: you can take a
gas-guzzling, fuel inefficient car. or you can
take the Caltrain.The car will probably take
longer, and you'll have to donate plasma so
that you have enough money to pay for park
ing. On top of that, you'll have to negotiate
San Francisco's curved streets in the middle
of the night, and you will be killing the envi
ronment as you go. Your other option is the
Caltrain. with all the freshmen.
Car it is. then.
Be sure to allot yourself plenty of time to
deal with the uncertain Bay Area traffic, and
make sure you have games to play with the
other people in the car. like "Would you
rather" or "Marry, Fuck, Kill." A quick warn
ing, though: if you are in a car with people you
don't know that well, you may not want to
make an inappropriate joke about, say. rap

ing a baby. It's going to be a long enough ride
back without the awkward silence.
And then here you are, finally! The opera
house. It's beautiful, isn't it? And all you have
to do is find your seat, sit back and enjoy the
opera. Walk up, past the grand tier, the box
seats, the orchestra premium seats, the dress
circle. Keep going. 1 leave yourself to the bal
cony. finally, your breath short from all those
flights of steps. Join the other unwashed
masses as you try to find your seats. Marvel at
how high up you are and the steepness of the
incline, and try to stitle your sense of vertigo.
But then, the opera starts. And you forget
about all of that. Yes. the baritone is the size
ot Polly Pocket down there, but you lean for
ward. the voice carries, the set sings, the or
chestra swells and it doesn't even matter.
Until you lean forward just a little too
much.
You lose your balance, tumbling over into
the balcony seats in front of you. You pick up
speed and other opera-goers like a growing
snowball, faster and faster, until you reach
the end of the balcony and are all flung into
the air, like a ball at the bottom of a slide. You
hang poised in the air for a moment until you
drop onto the orchestra seats far below.
Your last conscious thought will probably
be admiration at how beautiful the opera is
trom down here, and isn't that the point of
going in the first place?

Sini didn't actually start a terrifying human
snowball that crushed everyone below, but she
did enjoy I he Barber of Seville with her friends
front C asa. She hopes that someday, they won t
be afraid to go with her again. You can e-mail
