# Online video...Ok Go!

What do four guys on eight treadmills
have to do with the Numa Numa
kid. an electric guitar rendition of
Pachabal's Canon or 500,000 superballs
bouncing down the streets of San Francisco?
All of the scenes listed above are internet
video sensations. Some, such as Jeong-Hyun
Urn's electric guitar performance of "Rock
Canon," have been viewed more then ten
millions times — a viewership that far ex
ceeds all but the most popular cable TV
shows.
It's no wonder then, that Internet video
has begun to grab headlines. Google's recent
acquisition of the video sharing company
YouHibe has only added to the flurry. But in
addition to being a profitable new market for
companies like Google, there is something
truly unique about the egalitarian nature of
online video.
Keadv, Set, Ok Go!
As an example.check out Ok Go's unoffi

cial music video "Hear it Goes Again," cur
rently ranked Kth most viewed video on
You Tube. Four flamboyantly dressed mem
bers of the band Ok (}o dance in concert atop
eight treadmills to the upbeat rhythms of
their song by the same title. Words fail to cap
ture the visual treat. 1 dare you to watch with
out smiling.
Ok Go's treadmill antics constitute my
new favorite video. On closer inspection,
however, many of the telltale signs of a well
produced film or even music video are lack
ing. ITie entire scene is uncut. There are no

special effects, no fancy backgrounds and
only one camera angle. It would appear as
though the band simply used a low-end cam
corder they found lying around. If Ok Go's
previous work is an indicator, they probably
did. On their first Internet video sensation.
A Million Ways." the band members are said
to have simply borrowed a neighbor's cam
era. TTiey purportedly released the film with
out even alerting or consulting their record
label first.
Nothing but Talent
()k ( io's video success rests wholly on the
band-members raw and unabashed talent.
There is no post-processing or fancy editing
to get in the way of the music and film. Other
Internet videos are similar. In his video "gui
tar .the formerly unknown Lim who goes by
"funtwo" online, displays an artistic mastery
of the guitar that ranks with the likes of Jimi

Our Modern World
Hendrix. Even the singing Numa
Numa guy offers a sincerity that I
often find all too lacking in other
mediums.
The media itself is refreshingly
earnest and simple.The standard five
minute video length forces video au
thors to he concise and to the point.
Even when fancy professional tech
niques are used, as in Sony Bravia's
"Color Like No Other" commercial,
the film is forced to focus on its sub
ject. in this case half a million super
halls bouncing down the hills of San
Francisco. Any film that deviates too
far from the straightforward risks
drowning in the hubbub.
Leveling the Playing Field
The medium of Internet video ap
peals to an American sense of equal
ity and meritocracy. Talented films
are shared and forwarded while
mediocre ones are banished to
cyber-obscurity. More importantly,
anyone with talent, creativity and a
camera, regardless of how obscure,
can quickly share their creations
with the world. 1 helped my room
mate upload his film. "Numismatic

Inquiry" to You Tube and in a few
hours he had already received 100
visits.'Hiis would have been unheard
of only years ago.
Jump on the Bandwidth
In fact, the present is a truly
unique moment for online video.
Five years ago, only a handful of such
videos existed. One of these films
was 405. released in 200(>. 405 was a
professionally produced three
minute comedy that featured a com
puter graphics 747 landing on Los
Angeles highway 405. When 405 was
released, Internet connections were
slow, web space was scare and the av
erage computer wasn't up to the task
of rendering highly compressed
video. 405 was a moderate success
but other films were slow to follow.
In the absence of video, the cyber
world made do with hokey cartoon
flash animations featuring Osama
Bin Laden, presidential candidates
or the destruction of Earth in a nu
clear holocaust.To borrow the words
of one such animation. "WTF,
mate?" Six years later, that has all
changed.
Now. increased bandwidth means
millions more people can easily up
load and download films. Countless
websites offer free video hosting and
increased processor speeds allow
new videos to more effectively take

advantage of existing bandwidth.
Won't go on Forever
Although bandwidth has in
creased, it is not unlimited.This has
the additional benefit of making
high end equipment less important
for online video. If everyone has to
cram their video down to a low-res
olution for the Internet, it means
more people can get by without ex
pensive cameras. In the YouTube
realm, Joe Shmoe can compete
with any top studio — at least for
now.
When the writers for John Stew
art's The Daily Show stopped by
campus to meet with students two
years ago. they took an informal poll
and asked how many people watch
the Daily Show online. Almost
everyone's hands went up. The writ
ers predicted that in a few years,
everyone will watch all of their video
online. When online video becomes
the realm of the major networks, I
hope people will still take the time to
stop and enjoy simple original con
tent. 1 have a feeling they will. Oh.
here it goes again.
