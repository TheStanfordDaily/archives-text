# Online video...Ok Go!

What do four guys on eight treadmills
have to do with the Numa Numa
kid. an electric guitar rendition of
Pachabal's Canon or 500,000 superballs
bouncing down the streets of San Francisco?
All of the scenes listed above are internet
video sensations. Some, such as Jeong-Hyun
Urn's electric guitar performance of "Rock
Canon," have been viewed more then ten
millions times â€” a viewership that far ex
ceeds all but the most popular cable TV
shows.
It's no wonder then, that Internet video
has begun to grab headlines. Google's recent
acquisition of the video sharing company
YouHibe has only added to the flurry. But in
addition to being a profitable new market for
companies like Google, there is something
truly unique about the egalitarian nature of
online video.
Keadv, Set, Ok Go!
As an example.check out Ok Go's unoffi

cial music video "Hear it Goes Again," cur
rently ranked Kth most viewed video on
You Tube. Four flamboyantly dressed mem
bers of the band Ok (}o dance in concert atop
eight treadmills to the upbeat rhythms of
their song by the same title. Words fail to cap
ture the visual treat. 1 dare you to watch with
out smiling.
Ok Go's treadmill antics constitute my
new favorite video. On closer inspection,
however, many of the telltale signs of a well
produced film or even music video are lack
ing. ITie entire scene is uncut. There are no

special effects, no fancy backgrounds and
only one camera angle. It would appear as
though the band simply used a low-end cam
corder they found lying around. If Ok Go's
previous work is an indicator, they probably
did. On their first Internet video sensation.
A Million Ways." the band members are said
to have simply borrowed a neighbor's cam
era. TTiey purportedly released the film with
out even alerting or consulting their record
label first.
Nothing but Talent
()k ( io's video success rests wholly on the
band-members raw and unabashed talent.
There is no post-processing or fancy editing
to get in the way of the music and film. Other
Internet videos are similar. In his video "gui
tar .the formerly unknown Lim who goes by
"funtwo" online, displays an artistic mastery
of the guitar that ranks with the likes of Jimi
