## Proposition 85 should not pass 
### TESSA ANDERMANN AND PETER SIMON 
As a medical student and future
doctor. I would like to respond to
Noelle Patno's article on November
I. 2(X)6 "Supporting Proposition 85
Just Makes Sense."
I agree that teenagers notifying
their parents about their desire to
undergo an abortion makes sense. I
certainh .mi dedicated to the health
of m\ future patients and will en
courage them in whatever way 1 can
to talk to their parents and the car
ing adults in their lives. Iliis argu
ment makes so much sense that in
practice, parental involvement is the
rule rather than the exception even
without a constitutional amend
ment mandating parental notifica
tion. In states without parental noti
fication laws. ()1 % of young women
report that either one or both par
ents were aware of their abortions
with 75% of those parents being in
formed by their daughters them
selves. And those numbers increase
as maternal age declines, with 90
percent of teenagers aged 14 or
younger reporting that their abor
tion had taken place with the knowl
edge of at least one parent.
In addition, Proposition 85 does
not take into account the fact that
teenagers who cannot talk to their
parents often find other adults to
talk to, including aunts, uncles and
clergy. Most teens — over SO per
cent report that they involved at
least one adult member in their de
cision. Most importantly: the propor
tion of minors who inform parents
about their intent to have abortions
does not differ between slates with
notification laws and those without.
In essence, those teenagers who
have parents they can talk to do so
already, without involving the legal
system. Several years ago. the Amer
ican Academy of Pediatrics issued a
statement saying that "mandating
parental notification does not
achieve the intended benefit of pro
moting family communication, but it

does increase the risk of harm to the
adolescent by delaying access to ap
propriate care." The academy's
statement is based on research con
ducted in states where similar re
strictive laws have been enacted. For
example, after a parental notifica
tion law was passed in Minnesota,
second-trimester abortions in
creased by 27 percent.) We all know
that second trimester abortions are
harder to access, more expensive
and pose a greater risk to teens'
health, although these risks are still
less than those of childbirth. When
parental notification laws are insti
tuted, teens travel out of state or en
danger themselves with illegal abor
tions. Parental consent laws put
teens in jeopardy.
If informing parents makes
sense, then why would some teens
not involve their parents? As Mis
han Araujo alluded to in her op-ed
piece, over 30 percent of young
women who chose not to involve
their parents in their abortion deci
sions did so because of fear of phys
ical harm, being kicked out of the
house or other abuse. Family unity
and communication cannot be man
dated and these high-risk teens must
be taken into account.
Make no mistake — laws about
parental notification are not about
teenager's health. Iliey are focused
on limiting women's access to abor
tion. ITiey move us progressively to
wards a pre- Roe r.v. Wade era in
which thousands of women took
abortion into their own hands and
died as a result. Many of us here at
Stanford are too young to remem
ber the hospital wards filled with
those women. Certainly, pro
life/anti choice groups like Stanford
students for Fife, Traditional Values
Coalition and Right to Fife of Cen
tral California — the groups in sup
port of Proposition 85 — don't want
us to remember that era.
