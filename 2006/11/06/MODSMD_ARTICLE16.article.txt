## Vote for a Sustainable California 
### KEVAN CHRISTENSEN 
As Election Day nears, many activists have fo
cused on Proposition 87 and its goals of promoting
the development of alternative fuels and a sustain
able energy future for California. But there's more
than one way that environmentally conscious vot
ers can protect California's rich natural treasures
and ensure the state's ecological health and in
tegrity for the future. On behalf of Students for a
Sustainable Stanford, I urge everyoneto not only
vote yes on Prop. 87. but to also vote yes on Prop.
84 and no on Prop. 90.
Prop. 84 would provide approximately $5.4 bil
lion in funding for numerous beneficial projects to
maintain the quality and safety of California's
water supply, such as improved wastewater treat
ment and provisions to ensure public water facili
ties meet safe drinking water standards. It would
also fund projects for flood control, the conserva
tion of vital natural habitats, and the expansion
and improvement of parks in the state. Fundingfor
the initiative would come from the sale of general
obligation bonds, which are paid off from the
state's (ieneral Fund.Thus, Prop. 84 will be 112 unded
from existing revenues and does not stipulate an
increase in taxes.
California's breathtaking natural resources,
from coastal waters to verdant forests to neigh
borhood parks, are not only a delight for state
residents but also a draw for visitors from around
the world.They provide the basis for much of the
state's economy and are an integral part of the
California lifestyle. But the state's population is
expected to increase by an astonishing 25 million
people by 2040. and such rapid growth is putting
a significant strain on the state's natural re
sources. Without a thought I ul and comprehen

sive plan for conserving, managing and supplying
these crucial resources, the very foundation of
California's livelihood will be unsustainable.
Not only are California's natural treasures at
risk, but the state's drinking water is in jeopardy as
well. The Department of Water Resources found
in a study of public water wells that among differ
ent regions in the state, between five and 42 per
cent of wells violate at least one drinking water
standard. Prop. 84 provides for the removal of
harmful chemicals and other contaminants from
the water supply. At the same time. Prop. 84 would
provide funding for programs to improve the
state's Hood control systems. Last year's tragedy in
New Orleans demonstrated the pressing need for
more flood control measures. A serious flood dis
aster in California could endanger countless peo
ple and leave millions without safe drinking water.
Prop. 84 will not only safeguard California's natu
ral resources, but it will also protect the health of
everyone in the state.
Opponents of Prop. 84 argue that it is designed
to benefit only a select few special interest groups
at a cost to the entire state. But the integrity of Cal
ifornia's water and other natural resources is of
concern to each and every one of the state's resi
dents. An investment in protecting these critical
resources now will ensure a sustainable California
for the future, and Prop. 84 is an essential step to
ward this goal.
On the other end of the spectrum is Prop. 90,
a disastrous attempt at restricting the powers of
eminent domain that has been referred to as the
"Taxpayer Trap" by opponents. Supporters want
voters to believe that it is a measure to protect
property owners from the government's power
of eminent domain. But Prop. 90 is really a de
ceptive initiative supported by developers and

wealthy landowners. The fine print of the propo
sition would allow property owners to sue the
government for huge amounts of money simply
by claiming that a government law or regulation
has reduced the value of their property. Taxpay
ers would then be forced to pay untold amounts
of money each year to developers and corpora
tions manipulating the law for their benefit.
Aside from the obvious negative effects on tax
payers across the state, Prop.9o would cause par
ticular harm to California's environment by great
ly hindering the state's ability to enact laws pro
tecting wildlife, habitats, and other natural re
sources. Property owners could sue the govern
ment for the costs of any environmental regula
tions, undermining vital laws to reduce pollution
and other ecologically damaging activities. Fur
thermore, the government would face an almost
impossible and exorbitantly expensive task when
trying to save California's natural treasures from
the hands of developers. Overall, Prop 90. would
have a devastating effect on both taxpayers and
the state's environment.
Prop. 84 will ensure the safety and quality of
California's water supply, as well as the integrity of
the state's natural resources, thus strengthening
the foundation for a sustainable future. Prop. 90
will undermine the government's ability to safe
guard California's treasures while making taxpay
ers liable for the activities of wealthy landowners
and developers. When you go to the polls tomor
row, be sure to vote for a healthy, sustainable and
environmentally sound California: Yes on 87, Yes
on 84 and No on 90.

from coastal waters to verdant forests to neigh
borhood parks, are not only a delight for state
residents but also a draw for visitors from around
the world.They provide the basis for much of the
state's economy and are an integral part of the
California lifestyle. But the state's population is
expected to increase by an astonishing 25 million
people by 2040. and such rapid growth is putting
a significant strain on the state's natural re
sources. Without a thought I ul and comprehen

sive plan for conserving, managing and supplying
these crucial resources, the very foundation of
California's livelihood will be unsustainable.
Not only are California's natural treasures at
risk, but the state's drinking water is in jeopardy as
well. The Department of Water Resources found
in a study of public water wells that among differ
ent regions in the state, between five and 42 per
cent of wells violate at least one drinking water
standard. Prop. 84 provides for the removal of
harmful chemicals and other contaminants from
the water supply. At the same time. Prop. 84 would
provide funding for programs to improve the
state's Hood control systems. Last year's tragedy in
New Orleans demonstrated the pressing need for
more flood control measures. A serious flood dis
aster in California could endanger countless peo
ple and leave millions without safe drinking water.
Prop. 84 will not only safeguard California's natu
ral resources, but it will also protect the health of
everyone in the state.
Opponents of Prop. 84 argue that it is designed
to benefit only a select few special interest groups
at a cost to the entire state. But the integrity of Cal
ifornia's water and other natural resources is of
concern to each and every one of the state's resi
dents. An investment in protecting these critical
resources now will ensure a sustainable California
for the future, and Prop. 84 is an essential step to
ward this goal.
On the other end of the spectrum is Prop. 90,
a disastrous attempt at restricting the powers of
eminent domain that has been referred to as the
"Taxpayer Trap" by opponents. Supporters want
voters to believe that it is a measure to protect
property owners from the government's power
of eminent domain. But Prop. 90 is really a de
ceptive initiative supported by developers and

wealthy landowners. The fine print of the propo
sition would allow property owners to sue the
government for huge amounts of money simply
by claiming that a government law or regulation
has reduced the value of their property. Taxpay
ers would then be forced to pay untold amounts
of money each year to developers and corpora
tions manipulating the law for their benefit.
Aside from the obvious negative effects on tax
payers across the state, Prop.9o would cause par
ticular harm to California's environment by great
ly hindering the state's ability to enact laws pro
tecting wildlife, habitats, and other natural re
sources. Property owners could sue the govern
ment for the costs of any environmental regula
tions, undermining vital laws to reduce pollution
and other ecologically damaging activities. Fur
thermore, the government would face an almost
impossible and exorbitantly expensive task when
trying to save California's natural treasures from
the hands of developers. Overall, Prop 90. would
have a devastating effect on both taxpayers and
the state's environment.
Prop. 84 will ensure the safety and quality of
California's water supply, as well as the integrity of
the state's natural resources, thus strengthening
the foundation for a sustainable future. Prop. 90
will undermine the government's ability to safe
guard California's treasures while making taxpay
ers liable for the activities of wealthy landowners
and developers. When you go to the polls tomor
row, be sure to vote for a healthy, sustainable and
environmentally sound California: Yes on 87, Yes
on 84 and No on 90.
