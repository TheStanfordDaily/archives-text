## USC wins every phase of the game Few bright spots for the Cardinal against defending Pac-10 champs 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Iliac comes a point in seasons gone had at which
fans aren't hoping for wins so much as they are for visi
ble improvement, especially among the players who will
be on the team in the future. It's only natural that in the
midst of a lost-cause season fans look for signs that next
year may not be so grim.
After Saturday's 42-0 loss to USCthe Cardinal were
left searching for any positives to take away from their
ninth loss in nine tries this season.
"We rail into a very good football team that was com
ing off a tough game." Stanford coach Walt Harris said.
"I thought we fought as hard as we could for as long as
we could. We tried to plav competitive."
Out-gained in every major statistical category, the
Cardinal were never really in the game. The Trojans
amassed 355 yards of total offense to Stanford's 208. and
won the turnover battle with two interceptions and a
fumble recovery.
Perhaps most telling was the time of possession dif
ferential while I JSC' was still playing its starters.Through
the first three cjuarteis of play, the Trojans had held the
ball for 29:38 to the Cardinal's 15:22. After last week's
upset loss to Oregon State, Stanford proved to be the
perfect remedy for I JSC's troubles.
"This game came out just right," DSC head coach
Pete Carroll said. "We were pretty explosive on offense
with some big plays. ITie defense was on the whole time
and did what they were capable of doing. Hie biggest op
portunity was to play a team that was struggling and then
bringing our game."
If there was anything positive that the Cardinal could
take away from the game it was the budding chemistry
between senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander and two of
his more talented options in the passing game â€”junior
running back Anthony Kimble and freshman receiver
Richard Sherman. Each caught three passes for 58 and
31 yards, respectively.
"I think we took some small steps." Ostrander said.
"A lot of it right now is trying to be the best team we can
be and focus on game management. We just need to try
to win every play from here tin out. If we do that, we can
improve."
Offensively and defensively outmatched, a bright
spot early for the Cardinal was the play of their special
teams. Punter Jay ()ttovegio pinned the Trojans inside
their own five yard line twice. Hut a costly fumble on a
kickoff return by junior Wopamo Osaisai and a crushing
blocked field goal that was returned for a touchdown by
USC'sTerreH lhomas meant that USCclearly dominat
ed all three phases of the game.
As the game went on. the I'rojans even won in the
stands.
The Stanford crowd to start the game was fairly size
able. but with little to cheer about, it soon became clear
that I JSC would be dominating the shouting match from
the sidelines as well.
"This was a great crowd, and it felt like a home game
to us,"Carroll said."l don't know how
many people were here, but the stands
were loaded with SC fans/Phis was re
ally cool to play here; it felt like we
were playing in a home game."
Playing a team reeling from in
juries and a winless start, Carroll
nonetheless asserted that the game

was a big win for his team as they re
turn home to Southern California to
finish out their season. The dominant
nature of that win only serves to ce
ment just how far apart the two pro
grams really are.
"We needed to have a game like
this where we have an opportunity to
get a lot of guys playing time and good
execution " Carroll said. "All in all. it
was a very successful trip, and we were
happy to get this win. We had a hard
loss last week, and it was good to get
this one done."
