What arc specific, concretc
steps that Stanford can take
to improve its football pro
gram?
I posed the question to profession
al and student journalists alike at the
USC game. Their answers are telling
and begin to present a picture of the is
sues that face the program.

"It's got to start with recruiting.
They've got to recruit not just tor tal
ent, but for depth. They've got to get
deeper. I think that a large part of the
problem with the injuries is that you
can still get a few four- or five-star
guys, but when you peel off that tirst
layer, the second- and third-team guys
aren't getting it done. And where they
are now, those guys have to play.
They're just inferior, unfortunately,
physically and athletically to the

teams they are playing.
"I think it begins and ends with
recruiting. You can make the argu
ment about academic standards, but
that's so entrenched that it's so hard
to get in there and find out what the
source of the problem is. Hut they've
got to get better athletes into the
school because this is not competi
tive."
Mike Eubanks, IheHootleg.com pub
lisher
"I think they have to be radically
better in strength and conditioning.
Some of Stanford's better athletes,
some of Stanford's best athletes, just
looked out of their league against
USC, even against USC's second and
third-string guys. Some of that is re
cruiting, some of that ought to be
within their control. I'm not saying it
falls on the head of any guy or any par
ticular institutional support, but they
really need to overhaul that, because 1
don't know if they can recruit their
way out of this mess, as Walt Harris
says. Hut they've got some raw tools
here that they need to make into bet
ter athletes and better football players
and that's the most immediate thing I
would do.
"Beyond that, keep getting T.C.
Ostrander better. Incredible as this
may sound after getting shut out, he
really took steps forward against USC
and he could do some things where I
could see him pulling off an upset in
an otherwise 0-12 year either this year
or next year."
Darren Sabedra, San Jose Mercury
News beat writer
"Stay healthy. This school, at this
point, at where it is, cannot afford in
juries. Last year. I think they avoided
the serious injuries; this year I think
they got wiped out before they even
got started. It's hard to gauge what the
offense could have done had it not
lost seven or eight starters. They also
have to recruit better, as Walt Harris
has said. It's too early to tell how his
recruits will turn out. since he's been
here less than two years, but they have
to get better players."
Bob Murphy, color commentator,
KNBR radio
"This has happened before and it's
not something that happened out of
the blue. All the players who graduat
ed last year were recruited by Tyrone
Willingham and there just was a re
cruiting lag [after Buddy Teevens re
placed Willingham]. It can't he any
thing else based upon the quality of
the players now versus the quality of
the players a year ago.
"Walt Harris had a situation very
much like this at Pittsburgh. He went
6-6 his first year, and we would have
gone to a bowl game had the call in
the UC-Davis game been correct.
But we have trouble this year just
like he did when he went 2-9 in his

second year in Pittsburgh. Uut then
he got it back to 5-6 and then he went
to five straight bowl games. That's
going to happen here and that's
going to be the pathway to success if
he can get momentum going.
"Obviously he's going to be the
coach here [next year]. You think
Stanford's going to fire a coach in two
years? No, that's not going to happen."
Christopher Anderson, football play
by-play, KZSU student radio
"The most important thing is that
they need to get the most out of the
players they can get into the school,
which means they need great assistant
coaches, they need people who will
stay year upon year upon year and
they need great support from the ad
ministrative staff, There has to not be
the impression that the administra
tors don't care. The administrators
have to say,'We want to have a good
football program and this is how we
propose to do it.'"
Alex Ciyr, Managing Editor of Sports,
football bear writer. The Stanford Daily
"I think it's going to be a real long
term process for Stanford, there's not
going to be any easy solution. Obvi
ously. injuries have played a huge
part.hut there are a lot of experienced
guys on this team and it's kind of dis
appointing the way things have gone
given how much experience the of
fensive line had, how much experi
ence Trent had. So it's not just going to
be something where experience is
going to make it better.
"Big changes are needed. I think
there's a lot made of admissions stan
dards. but I don't think it's the thing
that's really hurting the team right
now. Certainly.guys aren't getting in.
but in the past there have been people
who haven't gotten in and creativity in
terms of schemes has helped them
win. And Stanford has always been a
competitive academic school, but
they've also won Pac-10 titles as re
cently as six or seven years ago."
Gary Migdol, Senior Assistant Athletic
Director, Media Relations Director
"1 would say first of all, it's not a
short term fix. There's going to be
some time involved, a lot of long-term
work. 1 don't think it's any secret that
recruiting is a very important element
of the football program, so it's obvi
ously a combination of recruiting,
continuing to work hard under Coach
Harris and continuing to develop the
players that are here."
After the game, 1 asked Coach 11 arris
if there were a few, specific areas of
the team that he would most like to
improve.
Walt Harris
"1 don't think you can narrow it
down to just one or two things. I think
we got a lot of things we got to do to
improve. Where do you want to look?
kickoff coverage, kickoff return, field
goal/PAT protection, pass protection,
run blocking, doing your assignments.
There's just a lot of areas to look and
I'd rather not look."
