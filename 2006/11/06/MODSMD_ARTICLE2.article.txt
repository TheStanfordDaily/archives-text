# USC SHOWS WHO'S BOSS
## John David Booty rocking everywhere with three touchdown strikes 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR BY THE NUMBERS 
Years from now, Stanford fans may re
call this game as rock bottom.
In front of a Stanford Stadium crowd
packed with USC's cardinal and gold, the
Trojans thrashed Stanford 42-0 on the
strength of three second-quarter touch
down passes from John David Booty. With
the loss, Stanford tied a program-worst 11-
game losing streak dating to last season
and moved just three games away from its
first winless season since 1960.

"We fought as long as we could and as
much as we could," Coach Walt I larris
said."USC is USC. 1 think Stanford played
hard for what we have, and 1 commend our
football players for doing that. It would
have been really easy to get psyched out by
the skill and the talent that they have."
Instead of rushing against the Cardi
nal's (0-9,0-6 Pac-10) hapless ground de
fense, USC (7-1, 5-1) won with the deep
ball,racking up 247 passing yards on just 14
completions — a 17.ft yards per catch av
erage. All told, the Trojans completed six
passes of at least 20 yards against the Car

dinal, but just one pass of fewer than seven
yards. Standout receiver Dwayne Jarrett
led the way for the Trojans with I IS receiv
ing yards and a touchdown.
Tailback Chauncey Washington's 15-
vard run gave the Trojans a 7-0 first quar
ter lead, setting the stage for USC to blow
the game open with John David Booty in
the second. One minute into the quarter,
Jarrett hauled in a touchdown strike to put
the Trojans up 14-0. Junior cornerback
Wopamo Osasai fumbled the ensuing
kickolf after a vicious midair hit from two
USC defenders, one of three Cardinal

turnovers.
The very next play, USC scored one ol
its three touchdowns ol the afternoon off a
red-zone bootleg. After a play-action lake
to freeze the linebackers. Booty rolled to
his right and found Steve Smith wide-open
from seven yards out.
"One of the bootlegs, we got caught in
an inside linebacker blitz, so when they
came around, we didn't have anyone in the
back of the end zone for it." senior line
backer Michael Okwosaid.

USC tailback Chauncey Washington made Cardinal fans have Reggie Bush flashbacks, and not just for his warpaint, with a combination of power and shiftiness out of the backfield.
The other obvious lowlight for the Cardinal came in
third quarter. Down 28-0, with a fourth-and-8 at the USC
17-yard line — by far their deepest penetration of the
day — I larris decided to play conservatively and line up
for a field goal. USC defensive lineman Sedrick F'llis ex
ploded through the middle of the line to block the 33-
yard attempt the moment it left kicker Aaron Zagory's
foot. Corner Terrell Thomas recovered the kick and took
it the distance to put the Trojans ahead 35-0.
"We just got drove back," Harris said. "The ground
was slick: they got better footing than we did and just
drove us back.
"You can say we need a touchdown to win the game;
I'm just trying to play good, get some good things hap
pening. A field goal is positive, we'd be probably excited
to have the three points. A shutout is harder to live with
than the three points."
The decision to line up for the field goal wasn't 1 larris'
only conservative play call. Trailing hopelessly to USC
with an offense that last mounted a touchdown drive on
Oct. 7. Stanford faced three fourth downs inside the USC
44-yard line. All three times though, Stanford punted.

"You can second-guess all the things all the time."
1 larris said. "When you're 0-9, it's free, take your shots. 1
just felt like for our team it would help our defense and I
didn't feel comfortable with our [pass] protection, put
ting our protection in position to have more pressure
than they can probably deal with. So 1 took the conserva
tive way, and tried to give them the longer field.
"I'm sure there will be some calls that we would love
to have back, but we cannot physically get it done when
we get down in the [red zone]," he added. "And that's
pretty much the way it's been for quite a while."
The right call or not, Stanford has now scored ten
points in its last four Pac-10 games. Of 1 l l ) Division 1-A
teams, the Cardinal's scoring offense and rushing defense
are dead last, their total offense and sacks allowed are
second-worst, their turnover margin third-worst, scoring
defense sixth-worst and total defense seventh-worst.
Junior quarterback TC Ostrander did throw for 178
yards, 58 of'those to freshman receiver Richard Sherman,
but the players know finding a win in the remaining three
games will be an uphill battle.

Instead of rushing against the Cardi
nal's (0-9,0-6 Pac-10) hapless ground de
fense, USC (7-1, 5-1) won with the deep
ball,racking up 247 passing yards on just 14
completions — a 17.ft yards per catch av
erage. All told, the Trojans completed six
passes of at least 20 yards against the Car

dinal, but just one pass of fewer than seven
yards. Standout receiver Dwayne Jarrett
led the way for the Trojans with I IS receiv
ing yards and a touchdown.
Tailback Chauncey Washington's 15-
vard run gave the Trojans a 7-0 first quar
ter lead, setting the stage for USC to blow
the game open with John David Booty in
the second. One minute into the quarter,
Jarrett hauled in a touchdown strike to put
the Trojans up 14-0. Junior cornerback
Wopamo Osasai fumbled the ensuing
kickolf after a vicious midair hit from two
USC defenders, one of three Cardinal

turnovers.
The very next play, USC scored one ol
its three touchdowns ol the afternoon off a
red-zone bootleg. After a play-action lake
to freeze the linebackers. Booty rolled to
his right and found Steve Smith wide-open
from seven yards out.
"One of the bootlegs, we got caught in
an inside linebacker blitz, so when they
came around, we didn't have anyone in the
back of the end zone for it." senior line
backer Michael Okwosaid.

USC tailback Chauncey Washington made Cardinal fans have Reggie Bush flashbacks, and not just for his warpaint, with a combination of power and shiftiness out of the backfield.
The other obvious lowlight for the Cardinal came in
third quarter. Down 28-0, with a fourth-and-8 at the USC
17-yard line — by far their deepest penetration of the
day — I larris decided to play conservatively and line up
for a field goal. USC defensive lineman Sedrick F'llis ex
ploded through the middle of the line to block the 33-
yard attempt the moment it left kicker Aaron Zagory's
foot. Corner Terrell Thomas recovered the kick and took
it the distance to put the Trojans ahead 35-0.
"We just got drove back," Harris said. "The ground
was slick: they got better footing than we did and just
drove us back.
"You can say we need a touchdown to win the game;
I'm just trying to play good, get some good things hap
pening. A field goal is positive, we'd be probably excited
to have the three points. A shutout is harder to live with
than the three points."
The decision to line up for the field goal wasn't 1 larris'
only conservative play call. Trailing hopelessly to USC
with an offense that last mounted a touchdown drive on
Oct. 7. Stanford faced three fourth downs inside the USC
44-yard line. All three times though, Stanford punted.

"You can second-guess all the things all the time."

just felt like for our team it would help our defense and I
didn't feel comfortable with our [pass] protection, put

"I'm sure there will be some calls that we would love

we get down in the [red zone]," he added. "And that's
pretty much the way it's been for quite a while."
The right call or not, Stanford has now scored ten
points in its last four Pac-10 games. Of 1 l l ) Division 1-A
teams, the Cardinal's scoring offense and rushing defense
are dead last, their total offense and sacks allowed are
second-worst, their turnover margin third-worst, scoring
defense sixth-worst and total defense seventh-worst.
Junior quarterback TC Ostrander did throw for 178
yards, 58 of'those to freshman receiver Richard Sherman,
but the players know finding a win in the remaining three
games will be an uphill battle.

Years from now, Stanford fans may re
call this game as rock bottom.
In front of a Stanford Stadium crowd
packed with USC's cardinal and gold, the
Trojans thrashed Stanford 42-0 on the
strength of three second-quarter touch
down passes from John David Booty. With
the loss, Stanford tied a program-worst 11-
game losing streak dating to last season
and moved just three games away from its
first winless season since 1960.

"We fought as long as we could and as
much as we could," Coach Walt I larris
said."USC is USC. 1 think Stanford played
hard for what we have, and 1 commend our
football players for doing that. It would
have been really easy to get psyched out by
the skill and the talent that they have."
