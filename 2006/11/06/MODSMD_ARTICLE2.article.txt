# USC SHOWS WHO'S BOSS
## John David Booty rocking everywhere with three touchdown strikes 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR BY THE NUMBERS 
Years from now, Stanford fans may re
call this game as rock bottom.
In front of a Stanford Stadium crowd
packed with USC's cardinal and gold, the
Trojans thrashed Stanford 42-0 on the
strength of three second-quarter touch
down passes from John David Booty. With
the loss, Stanford tied a program-worst 11-
game losing streak dating to last season
and moved just three games away from its
first winless season since 1960.

"We fought as long as we could and as
much as we could," Coach Walt I larris
said."USC is USC. 1 think Stanford played
hard for what we have, and 1 commend our
football players for doing that. It would
have been really easy to get psyched out by
the skill and the talent that they have."
Instead of rushing against the Cardi
nal's (0-9,0-6 Pac-10) hapless ground de
fense, USC (7-1, 5-1) won with the deep
ball,racking up 247 passing yards on just 14
completions — a 17.ft yards per catch av
erage. All told, the Trojans completed six
passes of at least 20 yards against the Car

dinal, but just one pass of fewer than seven
yards. Standout receiver Dwayne Jarrett
led the way for the Trojans with I IS receiv
ing yards and a touchdown.
Tailback Chauncey Washington's 15-
vard run gave the Trojans a 7-0 first quar
ter lead, setting the stage for USC to blow
the game open with John David Booty in
the second. One minute into the quarter,
Jarrett hauled in a touchdown strike to put
the Trojans up 14-0. Junior cornerback
Wopamo Osasai fumbled the ensuing
kickolf after a vicious midair hit from two
USC defenders, one of three Cardinal

turnovers.
The very next play, USC scored one ol
its three touchdowns ol the afternoon off a
red-zone bootleg. After a play-action lake
to freeze the linebackers. Booty rolled to
his right and found Steve Smith wide-open
from seven yards out.
"One of the bootlegs, we got caught in
an inside linebacker blitz, so when they
came around, we didn't have anyone in the
back of the end zone for it." senior line
backer Michael Okwosaid.

USC tailback Chauncey Washington made Cardinal fans have Reggie Bush flashbacks, and not just for his warpaint, with a combination of power and shiftiness out of the backfield.
