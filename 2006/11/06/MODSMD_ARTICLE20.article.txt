# Inside The Game: The Bootleg
## 
### 

Just seventeen seconds after (JSC's second touchdown of the game, the Trojans cracked the Stan
ford end zone again. Quarterback John David Booty (10) took the snap at the 7-yard line, faked a
running play and bootlegged to his right. Slot receiver Steve Smith (2) ran a drag from the left to right
side of the field. The Cardinal bit hard on the play fake; as a refsult, Smith was wide open in the end zone
for the touchdown and the rout was on.
