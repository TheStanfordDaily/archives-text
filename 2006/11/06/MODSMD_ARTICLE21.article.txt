ahead for good. 23-22. The Bears kept it close the rest of the
way. but Richards sealed the match with an ace at 30-28.
"We served much tougher and passed well in game four,"
Dunning said. "Overall, our play was pretty solid, but that 6-0
streak for Cal made it a dog light. I am happy with the way the
girls handled the situation and the pressure."
Akinradewo said the team dug deep to pull the win out in
a tough atmosphere.
"We knew our level needed to go up." Akinradewo said.
"( al was playing very well, meaning we had to struggle and
needed to push. Our team chemistry is our biggest strength,
and in the end. that's what pulled us through tonight."
