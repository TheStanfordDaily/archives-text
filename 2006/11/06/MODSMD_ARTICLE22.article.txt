## Feinstein for Senate 
### STUART BAIMEL 
Dianne Feinstein. the senior senator from California,
has not bothered to run much of a campaign to win her
third full term in the Senate. She leads her token Repub
lican opposition, Richard Mountjoy, 59 percent to 33 per
cent in a recent poll and will coast to a landslide victory.
She has spent more time helping other Democratic can
didate's than campaigning for herself. Dianne Feinstein is
a California institution, easily the state's most popular
politician and one of the very few (our governor for the
foreseeable future might be the only other) that can at
tract significant support from the other party. In an era
when the Senate is partisan, divisive and fiercely polar
ized. Feinstein is one of the few senators who can still
forge a bipartisan consensus on issues that transcend
party lines.
A 1955 Stanford graduate, Feinstein distinguished
herself as mayor of San Francisco for nine years before
winning election to the Senate in 1992, in a special elec
tion to replace Pete Wilson, who became governor. She
won in her own right in 1994.2000 and is poised to win a
third and probably final term this election season, keep
ing both California's Senate seats firmly in the hands of
Democrats for another four years. Feinstein's most im
portant role in the Senate has been as the only woman on
the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is a strong, resolute
defender of the right to choose when the nation's leader
ship. both Democrats and Republicans, are trending pro
life, considering South Dakota's law banning most abor
tions and the Democratic Party's embrace of pro-life Bob
Casey's campaign for Senate in Pennsylvania. She has
consistently earned UK) percent ratings from Planned
Parenthood, and 0 percent from the National Right to
Life Committee. The Senate needs statesmen and

stateswomen like Feinstein to defend the right to choose
from constant infringements and restrictions, especially
when confirming judges. She voted against the nomina
tions of John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme
Court.
Outside of abortion-related issues, she has made her
mark as a senator capable of compromising and nego
tiating with Republicans. She voted for the Central
American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which
much of her party was against, and supported the orig
inal Iraq War resolution. The senator has since said, as
many senators have, that she was misled by the evi
dence presented and supports a no-confidence meas
ure targeting Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.
She has joined with many Democrats and some Repub
licans in urging the president to adopt a timetable call
ing for withdrawal from Iraq by the end of 2007, rather
than immediate withdrawal, as some Democrats are
urging. Feinstein also supported the bill funding the
construction of a fence on the border while supporting
an amnesty program, a pragmatic approach taking
ideas from both sides.
Feinstein has spoken to current Senate Minority
Leader Harry Reid and wants him to forge a bipartisan
consensus on major issues to end the era of wedge issues
that has been the hallmark of the Republican Congress.
This kind of sentiment has been rare in Congress the past
few years, and some in the Democratic Party, namely
Representative Henry Waxman.seem to be in no mood
to change it. The Democrats would then be squandering
an opportunity to put policy and legislation in the public
interest above partisan politics.
