# Letter to the Editor
## RF asks students to bring passion to class 
### 
Being an RF, and a new one to
boot. 1 was drawn to read the
polemics surrounding the Branner
incident. I was especially seduced by
the vehemence of the postings that
reacted to the several letters to the
editor, the initial article, and the
opinion piece. I had the impression
that 1 was back among fractious
Trotskyites, or perhaps closer to our
times listening in on a discussion be
tween Serbs, Croats, Bosniacs and
Albanians, over the fate of Yu
goslavia. Manv of us in the teaching

faculty would love to see similar en
ergies deployed in seminar or sec
tion. Too often are classroom discus
sions characterized by an exquisite
ly delicate refusal to counter a point
of view, either out of a charitable
care not to hurt the feelings of the
student who expressed it. or out of
some fear of a hostile retort. This
seeming kindness does not charac
terize every American or Huropean
institution I have dealt with. The
now famous Branner debate was
thus a divine surprise to me. 1 would
never suggest that you stop dis
cussing ResEd (or I HUM or any
other Stanford institution that im

pacts the God-given right to pursue
learning or happiness) with passion
and frankness. Although I would
call for a little more consideration to
go with this passion and frankness, 1
do hope that you will take off the
kids'
gloves as well when dealing with is
sues of war and peace, life or death,
truth and falsehood, and general
ethics, in the classroom and the polit
ical arena. It may be even more fun.
