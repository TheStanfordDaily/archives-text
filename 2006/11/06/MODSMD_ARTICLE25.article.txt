# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Top-ranked Trojans win defensive battle USC scores three fourth period goals to seal win 
### ANDREW SHEN STAFF WRITER 
In a much-anticipated rematch of
last year's NCAA men's water polo
championship game, the fourth
ranked Stanford Cardinal lost to un
defeated and top-ranked USC 6-2 on
Saturday afternoon.
I lie final score was not indicative
of how closely the game was played,
as Stanford (i-4-6) trailed by a single
goal at the end of the third quarter.
Nevertheless, USC (20-0) ripped off
three unanswered goals at the start of
the fourth quarter.
USC senior Juan Delgadillo
opened the scoring up with the first of
his two goals. Stanford senior captain
JJ Carton's response tied the game
up. hut freshman star J.W.
Krumpholtz scored to beat the half
time buzzer, making it 2-1 in favor of
the Trojans.
After a I JSC goal, sophomore Will
I lindle-Katel cut the lead to one with
Stanford's only goal of the third quar
ter.
But after three hard-fought quar
ters of defensive-minded water polo.

the Trojans exploded in the fourth
and Stanford simply did not have the
firepower to bounce back.
"()f course it's never good to lose,
hut there were a few encouraging
things that came out of yesterday's
game." said junior Peter Finlayson.
"First, our defense was great. We
held USC' to their lowest season total
all year — they are averaging 12-13
goals a game. To hold them to three
through the third quarter, and only
allow six total was solid. Now we just
need to get our offense firing at the
same level as our defense."
Stanford responded to the loss by
defeating No. 13 UC-Davis yester
day. 9-4. Seven Cardinal players
notched goals, led by freshman Jan
son Wigo and junior Ryan Fortune,
who each scored twice.
The Cardinal were absolutely
dominant, leading 7-1 after three
quarters. ITiey capitalized on man-up
opportunities, with freshman Sage
Wright and Wigo each scoring in
those situations. In total, Stanford
scored four man-up goals, including
three in under a minute.
"Today was huge, too. since we
went to Davis and beat them at their
home pool," said Finlayson."lt really
showed our toughness to be able to
bounce back from a tough loss and
still be able to play at a high level."

After not playing in the USC
game, sophomore goalie Jimmie
Sandman recorded 12 saves. Sand
man and senior Sandy Hohener usu
ally split halves, but this weekend
they split games.
Next up for the Cardinal are two
home games against UC-Irvine and
Santa Clara.

"We are still in pretty good shape
heading into the MPSF tournament."
said Finlayson. "Our goal is to get a
top-three seed and that looks doable
if we win next week against UCI and
the following week against HOP Our
team is still getting better every day
and we think we are going to peak
just in time for the end of the season."
