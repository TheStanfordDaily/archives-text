## Students, shots and Stanford Pragmatic alcohol policy enforcement creates varied rules, students praise flexibility 
### SAM BHAGWAT 
Leland Stanford Sr. was obsessed with winemak
ing. I le planted a vineyard on much of today's West
Campus, imported Trench workers to run the win
ery and dreamt of adding accomplished vinter to his
accolades. After his death. Jane Stanford, herself a
temperance advocate, continued to operate the
winery despite the attacks of Prohibition-minded
groups, calling the wine a medicinal product. The
grapes were later displaced by alfalfa and the win
ery closed, but Stanford has had a unique and com
plicated relationship with alcohol ever since.
Today, the University's alcohol policy is clear. It
reads, "All Universities must abide by state and
local laws, and all campus policies reflect the appli
cation ot law to University life," a statement that
translates to "it is illegal to drink if you are under
21." It was with this justification that in 2003 Resi
dential Education banned drinking in public areas
in all-frosh dorms.
But a series of extensive interviews with admin
istrators, dorm staff and students paints a picture of
a policy that is lenient relative to peer institutions
and focused more on the health and safety of stu
dents than preventing underage drinking. And de
spite the official policy, in practice, powei is delegat
ed to Resident Fellows and dorm staff to enforce
the policy.This decentralization of decision-making
power to individual RFs and residential staff has
yielded a spectrum of results, with some RFs taking
steps beyond the University policy to restrict alco
hol in their dorms, while others adapt a more prag
matic approach.
RFs and Stall Tweak Policy
Trancos, a four-class dorm that had an open
lounge policy for drinking last year, now requires
residents to apply for permission to drink in the
lounge, and that the host of any event must be 21.
The new rule, which staff say is designed to protect
freshmen, has rattled upperclassmen like sopho
more and two-time Trancos resident Ruven Chu.
"I'm not so much upset at the rule itself," lie said.
"I'm more upset that they felt like they had to make
the rule. They're not treating us like responsible
adults."
