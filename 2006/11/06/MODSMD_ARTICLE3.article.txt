# RESIDENTIAL EDUCATION
## Students, shots and Stanford Pragmatic alcohol policy enforcement creates varied rules, students praise flexibility 
### SAM BHAGWAT 
Leland Stanford Sr. was obsessed with winemak
ing. I le planted a vineyard on much of today's West
Campus, imported Trench workers to run the win
ery and dreamt of adding accomplished vinter to his
accolades. After his death. Jane Stanford, herself a
temperance advocate, continued to operate the
winery despite the attacks of Prohibition-minded
groups, calling the wine a medicinal product. The
grapes were later displaced by alfalfa and the win
ery closed, but Stanford has had a unique and com
plicated relationship with alcohol ever since.
Today, the University's alcohol policy is clear. It
reads, "All Universities must abide by state and
local laws, and all campus policies reflect the appli
cation ot law to University life," a statement that
translates to "it is illegal to drink if you are under
21." It was with this justification that in 2003 Resi
dential Education banned drinking in public areas
in all-frosh dorms.
But a series of extensive interviews with admin
istrators, dorm staff and students paints a picture of
a policy that is lenient relative to peer institutions
and focused more on the health and safety of stu
dents than preventing underage drinking. And de
spite the official policy, in practice, powei is delegat
ed to Resident Fellows and dorm staff to enforce
the policy.This decentralization of decision-making
power to individual RFs and residential staff has
yielded a spectrum of results, with some RFs taking
steps beyond the University policy to restrict alco
hol in their dorms, while others adapt a more prag
matic approach.
RFs and Stall Tweak Policy
Trancos, a four-class dorm that had an open
lounge policy for drinking last year, now requires
residents to apply for permission to drink in the
lounge, and that the host of any event must be 21.
The new rule, which staff say is designed to protect
freshmen, has rattled upperclassmen like sopho
more and two-time Trancos resident Ruven Chu.
"I'm not so much upset at the rule itself," lie said.
"I'm more upset that they felt like they had to make
the rule. They're not treating us like responsible
adults."
Trancos RA Maren Shipe. a junior, denied that
the new policy is designed to turn
hack the clock for upperclassmen.
"We're not treating our dorm like
a freshman dorm," she said. "We're
just trying to create a safe and fun so
cial environment for nondrinkers."
But Francos RF Joe Manning, an
associate professor of classics, said
that it was exactly the concentration
of freshmen in the dorm that necessi
tated restricting alcohol in public
areas.
"We don't think it's a proper use
of the lounge with a greater percent
age of freshmen in the house," he
said.
Not all changes imposed an out
right ban on alcohol use in common
areas. In Toyon, an upperclass dorm
with sophomore priority, RF Amy
Friedman last month emailed the list
last month to "clarify the Toyon alco
hol policy," informing residents that
dorm lounges must be alcohol-free
during the week, and that on week
end nights "alcohol in Toyon lounges
should comply with state laws and
University policy."
In some dorms, house-specific
policies have extended into private
spaces too. In upperclass Mirrielees,
RF Jim Cadena, also a Residence
Dean, has banned Beirut in common
areas and individual dorm rooms, a
move that has drawn the ire of some
residents.
"We should be allowed to live our
lives in our rooms," sophomore
Hiten Chawla said. "Many Mir
rielees residents are over 21, and it's
perfectly legal for them to drink."
Cadena declined to comment, but
Residential Education Associate Di
rector Josh Schiller said that such
policy changes were the prerogative
of RFs and dorm staff.
"Because alcohol use impacts
both the individual and the commu
nity, the RF and residence staff for
each house is responsible for making
decisions about the environment
with respect to alcohol use," Schiller
said in an email. "In four-class and
upperclass houses, they may choose
to further limit where and how peo
ple can have or consume alcohol, in
cluding from public spaces or at
house events."
While Residential Education
leaves individual RFs and dorm
staff to enforce the alcohol policy
and tighten it as they see fit. it also
insists on articulating policy
through a unified front. After a
Sept. 25 story in The Daily described
an apparent abundance of alcohol
in Branner during Orientation,
Schiller emailed dorm staff around
campus to discourage them from
talking to the media. He informed
staff that they were forbidden from
sharing information about Residen
tial Education and advised them not
to share personal opinions. If RAs
choose to share an opinion with a
reporter, Schiller continued, they
are "strongly encouraged" to email
their quotes beforehand to him or
Residential Education Director
Jane Camarillo for review. Similarly,
Schiller would only comment on the
record for this story by email, citing

fears of being misquoted.
University Emphasis on Safety
The University has traditionally
taken a hands-off approach with al
cohol. encouraging RAs to promote
safety and openness over policing
drinking. Many universities take a
much harder line towards alcohol. A
study by three professors in the I lar
vard School of Public I lealth showed
that almost half of institutes of high
er education prohibited alcohol in
"student gatherings in dorm rooms."
and over a quarter of all institutes
had an aggressively enforced ban on
alcohol in such situations.
"We're very fortunate to go to a
university like Stanford that cares
more about its students than how
many tickets they can write" said
junior Daniel Novinson.a Roble RA
and editor at Ihe Daily.
Senior Nundu Janakißam, a for
mer RA in all-frosh Alondra.agreed.
"Everyone's on the same page,
not to bust people for drinking, but to
make sure kids aren't dying," he said.
But staff also cited difficulties in
herent in enforcing a policy that must
to some degree go unspoken.
"They kind of dance around the
question in RA training," Novinson
said. "They can't come out and say,
'we're going to look the other way
when you break the law.'"
Janakißam agreed.
"We were never told, 'don't en
force the law,"' he said. "We were
told, 'there's the law, but safety's a
priority.'"
The fine line that dorm staff walk

is not without risks either.
Ralph Castro, manager of the
Substance Abuse Prevention Pro
gram at Vaden Health Center, said
that the University's policy is precar
ious.
"Stanford is always one or two se
rious alcohol-related incidents away
from a much more restrictive cam
pus environment in regard to alco
hol." he said.
One advantage the University en
joys in making changes to the alcohol
policy is that every fall brings a new
wave of freshmen unfamiliar with
old rules. Florence Moore East RF
Greg Watkins pointed to this lack of
institutional memory among stu
dents as a key to the success of the
2003 policy shift banning drinking in
all-frosh dorm common areas.
"It was a culture change for un
dergraduates," he said. "But it's a lot
different when it's taking place, when
upperclassnien remember what it
used to be like, than when under
graduates are coming in without per
spective."
Health is Top Priority for Law
Enforcement Too
While the alcohol policy is amor
phous and its enforcement varying,
police have also declined to break
out the handcuffs at the first sign of
drinking in dorms.Though police can
legally arrest people for drinking in
lounges and other common spaces, as
well as in people's rooms if. from the
hall, they can see such drinking oc
curring, arrests are extremely unusu
al on tlie Farm.Though they did issue

36 disciplinary referrals, Stanford po
lice only made one arrest for alcohol
possession inside dorms during all of
2005. And even that arrest. Officer
Ken Bates said, could have been pri
marily due to drug- rather than alco
hol-possession.
Bates said that, due to staffing
reasons, police rarely enter the
dorms for non-security-related rea
sons. 1 le also emphasized that when
police enter dorms in response to an
alcohol-related health emergency,
health is the primary concern.
"II somebody is getting sick, our
goal to the community is to get them
medical attention, not to arrest,"
Bates said.
Though police response — at
least inside dorms — to alcohol-re
lated incidents is rare, the I Iniversity
also has a response system in place.
Possible responses range from en
rollment in an alcohol education
class at Vaden to a formal Judicial Af
fairs hearing for a Fundamental
Standard violation to loss of Univer
sity housing privileges.
Schiller said that fall quarter was
usually the heaviest period of alco
hol related incidences, with at least
52 cases that triggered a University
response last fall.
Despite its myriad forms around
campus, Watkins defended the Uni
versity policy because it promotes di
alogue.
"I would say that for everybody it
is becoming tricky territory to nego
tiate." Watkins said. "The policy is
valuable because we should talk
about alcohol."

nity, the RF and residence staff for
each house is responsible for making
decisions about the environment
with respect to alcohol use," Schiller
said in an email. "In four-class and
upperclass houses, they may choose
to further limit where and how peo
ple can have or consume alcohol, in
cluding from public spaces or at
house events."
While Residential Education
leaves individual RFs and dorm
staff to enforce the alcohol policy
and tighten it as they see fit. it also
insists on articulating policy
through a unified front. After a
Sept. 25 story in The Daily described
an apparent abundance of alcohol
in Branner during Orientation,
Schiller emailed dorm staff around
campus to discourage them from
talking to the media. He informed
staff that they were forbidden from
sharing information about Residen
tial Education and advised them not
to share personal opinions. If RAs
choose to share an opinion with a
reporter, Schiller continued, they
are "strongly encouraged" to email
their quotes beforehand to him or
Residential Education Director
Jane Camarillo for review. Similarly,
Schiller would only comment on the
record for this story by email, citing

fears of being misquoted.
University Emphasis on Safety
The University has traditionally
taken a hands-off approach with al
cohol. encouraging RAs to promote
safety and openness over policing
drinking. Many universities take a
much harder line towards alcohol. A
study by three professors in the I lar
vard School of Public I lealth showed
that almost half of institutes of high
er education prohibited alcohol in
"student gatherings in dorm rooms."
and over a quarter of all institutes
had an aggressively enforced ban on
alcohol in such situations.
"We're very fortunate to go to a
university like Stanford that cares
more about its students than how
many tickets they can write" said
junior Daniel Novinson.a Roble RA
and editor at Ihe Daily.
Senior Nundu Janakißam, a for
mer RA in all-frosh Alondra.agreed.
"Everyone's on the same page,
not to bust people for drinking, but to
make sure kids aren't dying," he said.
But staff also cited difficulties in
herent in enforcing a policy that must
to some degree go unspoken.
"They kind of dance around the
question in RA training," Novinson
said. "They can't come out and say,
'we're going to look the other way
when you break the law.'"
Janakißam agreed.
"We were never told, 'don't en
force the law,"' he said. "We were
told, 'there's the law, but safety's a
priority.'"
The fine line that dorm staff walk

is not without risks either.
Ralph Castro, manager of the
Substance Abuse Prevention Pro
gram at Vaden Health Center, said
that the University's policy is precar
ious.
"Stanford is always one or two se
rious alcohol-related incidents away
from a much more restrictive cam
pus environment in regard to alco
hol." he said.
One advantage the University en
joys in making changes to the alcohol
policy is that every fall brings a new
wave of freshmen unfamiliar with
old rules. Florence Moore East RF
Greg Watkins pointed to this lack of
institutional memory among stu
dents as a key to the success of the
2003 policy shift banning drinking in
all-frosh dorm common areas.
"It was a culture change for un
dergraduates," he said. "But it's a lot
different when it's taking place, when
upperclassnien remember what it
used to be like, than when under
graduates are coming in without per
spective."
Health is Top Priority for Law
Enforcement Too
While the alcohol policy is amor
phous and its enforcement varying,
police have also declined to break
out the handcuffs at the first sign of
drinking in dorms.Though police can
legally arrest people for drinking in
lounges and other common spaces, as
well as in people's rooms if. from the
hall, they can see such drinking oc
curring, arrests are extremely unusu
al on tlie Farm.Though they did issue

36 disciplinary referrals, Stanford po
lice only made one arrest for alcohol
possession inside dorms during all of
2005. And even that arrest. Officer
Ken Bates said, could have been pri
marily due to drug- rather than alco
hol-possession.
Bates said that, due to staffing
reasons, police rarely enter the
dorms for non-security-related rea
sons. 1 le also emphasized that when
police enter dorms in response to an
alcohol-related health emergency,
health is the primary concern.
"II somebody is getting sick, our
goal to the community is to get them
medical attention, not to arrest,"
Bates said.
Though police response — at
least inside dorms — to alcohol-re
lated incidents is rare, the I Iniversity
also has a response system in place.
Possible responses range from en
rollment in an alcohol education
class at Vaden to a formal Judicial Af
fairs hearing for a Fundamental
Standard violation to loss of Univer
sity housing privileges.
Schiller said that fall quarter was
usually the heaviest period of alco
hol related incidences, with at least
52 cases that triggered a University
response last fall.
Despite its myriad forms around
campus, Watkins defended the Uni
versity policy because it promotes di
alogue.
"I would say that for everybody it
is becoming tricky territory to nego
tiate." Watkins said. "The policy is
valuable because we should talk
about alcohol."

Leland Stanford Sr. was obsessed with winemak
ing. I le planted a vineyard on much of today's West
Campus, imported Trench workers to run the win
ery and dreamt of adding accomplished vinter to his
accolades. After his death. Jane Stanford, herself a
temperance advocate, continued to operate the
winery despite the attacks of Prohibition-minded
groups, calling the wine a medicinal product. The
grapes were later displaced by alfalfa and the win
ery closed, but Stanford has had a unique and com
plicated relationship with alcohol ever since.
Today, the University's alcohol policy is clear. It
reads, "All Universities must abide by state and
local laws, and all campus policies reflect the appli
cation ot law to University life," a statement that
translates to "it is illegal to drink if you are under
21." It was with this justification that in 2003 Resi
dential Education banned drinking in public areas
in all-frosh dorms.
But a series of extensive interviews with admin
istrators, dorm staff and students paints a picture of
a policy that is lenient relative to peer institutions
and focused more on the health and safety of stu
dents than preventing underage drinking. And de
spite the official policy, in practice, powei is delegat
ed to Resident Fellows and dorm staff to enforce
the policy.This decentralization of decision-making
power to individual RFs and residential staff has
yielded a spectrum of results, with some RFs taking
steps beyond the University policy to restrict alco
hol in their dorms, while others adapt a more prag
matic approach.
RFs and Stall Tweak Policy
Trancos, a four-class dorm that had an open
lounge policy for drinking last year, now requires
residents to apply for permission to drink in the
lounge, and that the host of any event must be 21.
The new rule, which staff say is designed to protect
freshmen, has rattled upperclassmen like sopho
more and two-time Trancos resident Ruven Chu.
"I'm not so much upset at the rule itself," lie said.
"I'm more upset that they felt like they had to make
the rule. They're not treating us like responsible
adults."
Trancos RA Maren Shipe. a junior, denied that
the new policy is designed to turn
hack the clock for upperclassmen.
"We're not treating our dorm like
a freshman dorm," she said. "We're
just trying to create a safe and fun so
cial environment for nondrinkers."
But Francos RF Joe Manning, an
associate professor of classics, said
that it was exactly the concentration
of freshmen in the dorm that necessi
tated restricting alcohol in public
areas.
"We don't think it's a proper use
of the lounge with a greater percent
age of freshmen in the house," he
said.
Not all changes imposed an out
right ban on alcohol use in common
areas. In Toyon, an upperclass dorm
with sophomore priority, RF Amy
Friedman last month emailed the list
last month to "clarify the Toyon alco
hol policy," informing residents that
dorm lounges must be alcohol-free
during the week, and that on week
end nights "alcohol in Toyon lounges
should comply with state laws and
University policy."
In some dorms, house-specific
policies have extended into private
spaces too. In upperclass Mirrielees,
RF Jim Cadena, also a Residence
Dean, has banned Beirut in common
areas and individual dorm rooms, a
move that has drawn the ire of some
residents.
"We should be allowed to live our
lives in our rooms," sophomore
Hiten Chawla said. "Many Mir
rielees residents are over 21, and it's
perfectly legal for them to drink."
Cadena declined to comment, but
Residential Education Associate Di
rector Josh Schiller said that such
policy changes were the prerogative
of RFs and dorm staff.
"Because alcohol use impacts

lounges and other common spaces, as
well as in people's rooms if. from the
hall, they can see such drinking oc
curring, arrests are extremely unusu
al on tlie Farm.Though they did issue

36 disciplinary referrals, Stanford po
lice only made one arrest for alcohol
possession inside dorms during all of
2005. And even that arrest. Officer
Ken Bates said, could have been pri
marily due to drug- rather than alco
hol-possession.
Bates said that, due to staffing
reasons, police rarely enter the
dorms for non-security-related rea
sons. 1 le also emphasized that when
police enter dorms in response to an
alcohol-related health emergency,
health is the primary concern.
"II somebody is getting sick, our
goal to the community is to get them
medical attention, not to arrest,"
Bates said.
Though police response — at
least inside dorms — to alcohol-re
lated incidents is rare, the I Iniversity
also has a response system in place.
Possible responses range from en
rollment in an alcohol education
class at Vaden to a formal Judicial Af
fairs hearing for a Fundamental
Standard violation to loss of Univer
sity housing privileges.
Schiller said that fall quarter was
usually the heaviest period of alco
hol related incidences, with at least
52 cases that triggered a University
response last fall.
Despite its myriad forms around
campus, Watkins defended the Uni
versity policy because it promotes di
alogue.
"I would say that for everybody it
is becoming tricky territory to nego
tiate." Watkins said. "The policy is
valuable because we should talk
about alcohol."
