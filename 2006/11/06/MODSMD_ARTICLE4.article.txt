Counting down the days be
fore Tuesday's election and

trailing in the polls. Democ
ratic gubernatorial candi- 4
date Phil Angelides used Fri
day afternoon to rally stu
dents against Proposition
85, a ballot initiative for
parental notification widely
considered to be a wedge
issue among voters.

— — c
The rally reflected a concei

ed effort on Angelides' part to
ferentiate himself from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger,
who supported the nearly identical Proposition 73 that
failed last Nov. by a six percent margin.
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is standing with George

Bush and the anti-choice extremists in supporting this
measure," Angelides told a crowd of about 100 at the
Women's Center. "I'll protect a women's right to choose
and that's what a governor ought to do."
A Field Poll released Thursday shows 46 percent of
voters in support of Proposition 85 and 43 percent in op
position. With over 11 percent of voters still undecided.
Democrats and pro-choice activists expressed optimism
regarding a wide-open race.
"It looks like it's going to he razor-close,"' State Con
troller Steve Westly, Angelides' rival in the Democratic
primary and a Stanford graduate, told the crowd. "We're
at the inflection point now. Now is the time to decide."
Proposition 85 would require doctors to notify a par
ent or guardian when a girl under 18 asks for an abor
tion. Ifpassed.it would be the 35th such measure nation
wide.
While most polls show Schwarzenegger leading by an
average of 15 points, Angelides was hopeful that a wave
of Democratic gains nationally, and a boosted turnout at
home, would turn the tides in his favor on election day.
"We Democrats are united," Angelides said. "If we
get everyone we know to vote, we'll win this thing."

Democratic gubernatorial candidate and current state treasurer Phil Angelides rallies at the Stanford Women's Center
on Friday.
Like many Democrats nation
wide, Angelides attempted to capi
talize on the president's low ap
proval ratings and the growing un
popularity of the war in Iraq.
"Arnold helped reelect President
Bush," Angelides said in an inter
view after the rally. "I will do every
thing I ean as governor and as a citi
zen of America to bring our troops
home."
While perhaps overshadowed by
more controversial measures such as
the gasoline tax. both sides hope to
use Proposition 85 to rally their re
spective bases. Supporters of Propo
sition 85. and 73 before it. point to
the broader failure of Schwarzeneg
ger's special election measures last
fall as a sign that the jury is still out
on parental notification.
"There's a much more level play
ing field this year," Republican con
sultant Hern Hanretty told the San
Jose Mercury News on Friday.
For their part, opponents of 85
have portrayed the proposition as

part of a broader effort to curb abor
tion rights.
"Everyone's looking to see what
California does," Westly told The
Daily after the event. "This is not an
isolated election. It has implications
around the world."
And junior Mishan Araujo. co
president of Stanford Students for
Choice, warned that the measure
was in danger of passing despite the
state's left-leaning politics.
"It scares me because 1 think a lot
of people in California think it
would never happen here," said
Araujo, whose group organized the
rally. "That's not the case."
For some Democrats, the sight of
Angelides and Westly stumping to
gether might initially appear odd.
The heated and sometimes bitter
primary race, which Angelides won
by less than five percent, produced
such vehement rhetoric that
Schwarzenegger's camp began using
some of Westly's quotes in their own
campaign advertisements.
Now. however, Westly says that
the two have put their differences
aside and are steadfast allies for the
Democratic cause.
"1 am flattered that Gov.
Schwarzenegger has quoted me ex

tensively," he said. "But it's impor
tant that people know where I stand.
And here's where I stand: vote De
mocratic."
