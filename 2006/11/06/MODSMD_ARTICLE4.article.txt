The rally reflected a concei

ed effort on Angelides' part to
ferentiate himself from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger,
who supported the nearly identical Proposition 73 that
failed last Nov. by a six percent margin.
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is standing with George

Bush and the anti-choice extremists in supporting this
measure," Angelides told a crowd of about 100 at the
Women's Center. "I'll protect a women's right to choose
and that's what a governor ought to do."
A Field Poll released Thursday shows 46 percent of
voters in support of Proposition 85 and 43 percent in op
position. With over 11 percent of voters still undecided.
Democrats and pro-choice activists expressed optimism
regarding a wide-open race.
"It looks like it's going to he razor-close,"' State Con
troller Steve Westly, Angelides' rival in the Democratic
primary and a Stanford graduate, told the crowd. "We're
at the inflection point now. Now is the time to decide."
Proposition 85 would require doctors to notify a par
ent or guardian when a girl under 18 asks for an abor
tion. Ifpassed.it would be the 35th such measure nation
wide.
While most polls show Schwarzenegger leading by an
average of 15 points, Angelides was hopeful that a wave
of Democratic gains nationally, and a boosted turnout at
home, would turn the tides in his favor on election day.
"We Democrats are united," Angelides said. "If we
get everyone we know to vote, we'll win this thing."
