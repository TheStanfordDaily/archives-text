## Bella Luna BELLA LUNA ristorante A 						"beautiful moon" worth trying 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION ITALIAN 
■ Ella I.una means "beautiful
moon" in Italian. Uh. I think.
I Okay,so I'm not exactly sure what
M "Bella Luna" translates to in Fing
m lish. But 1 do know the place
serves relatively well-priced, tasty
Italian food.
Situated conveniently close to the Palo Alto
transit station on University Avenue, Bella
Luna is easy to access by both bike and the
Marguerite. It's a little small compared to
many other Palo Alto restaurants in the vicini
ty. but it's definitely a charming little restau
rant. A friendly host greeted us and we were
immediately seated, which especially im
pressed me since this was right after the USC
game (I expected there to be a longer wait).
The restaurant is lovingly decorated with blue
moon sculptures - this confused me for a bit
until I realized what "Luna" meant - and small
framed photographs on the walls. The only
problem I had with the ambiance of the restau
rant was that it was a little loud. There were a
few times when I couldn't hear either the wait
er or my friend.
Since it is an Italian establishment, I
thought it might be logical to try the "Italian
Soda." Sadly, it tasted like watered down Sprite
with only a hint of strawberry flavoring. At
three bucks, it's not worth the money (but at
least this meal was on The Daily's tab. right?).
A glass of water would have been sufficient.
The bread served was also somewhat taste
less and a little stale to boot. Luckily, though,
my main course arrived with surprising speed.
1 don't believe it took much more than 10 min
utes between ordering our food and its arrival.
My order,"Fettuccini ala Bella Luna" was a

simple pasta served in a creamy alfredo sauce
with mushrooms and chopped tomatoes. De
spite its straightforwardness, the pasta was ex
cellent. The creamy sauce was delicious, being
both creamy and salty enough to make my
taste buds quite happy.
My friend's steak was almost perfect, burst
ing with flavor and delightfully juicy.
ITie tiramisu isn't bad either. Wonderfully
soft and rich, it features an amazing coffee and
cocoa mixture taste. At first 1 was afraid that I
was so full that 1 would have trouble finishing
it. But after the first bite. I knew it was so good
that I was obligated to eat it all.
Despite a few minor weak points, Bella
Luna is a good restaurant overall. The food
isn't too expensive, but 1 would recommend
cash-strapped students to skip the drink and
dessert. And despite my initial confusion over
the name, I now know that this is a beautiful
moon well worth trying.

With easy access by bike, Marguerite and Caltrain, Bella Luna is worth a try. The charming little restaurant on University Ave. serves good
food at reasonable prices, but skip the drinks if you're on a tight budget.
