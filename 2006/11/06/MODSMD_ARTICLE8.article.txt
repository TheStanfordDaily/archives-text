# ELECTIONS 2006
## Absentee or simply absent? 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Just 47 percent of eligible voters under 24 cast their bal
lots in 2(X)4. and with no presidential race on tomorrow's
ballot, national youth turnout may well be lower yet. At
Stanford, where half of the student body hails from outside
California,students wishing to vote must conquer not only
their apathy, but also ignorance of local issues and absen
tee registration for elections thousands of miles from
home.
Civics Professors take solace. Many interviewed stu
dents did express eagerness to vote, as evidenced by the
proliferation of student political groups and voter registra
tion drives across campus. Like many students.senior Jere
my Hoffman of Bethesda, Maryland was excited to vote
this year, but he was nearly stymied by his local elections
board as his ballot did not arrive until last I riday.just one
business day before today's postmark deadline. Now. even
with ballot in hand. Hoffman said he felt handicapped by
the limited news he received about area politics.
"I have hardly been to Maryland in the last year.so I re
ally don't know any of the local issues, and I 'm reading the
Washington Post for endorsements," he said. "I still don't
know who I m going to vote for governor, the biggest race.
I might abstain or maybe I'll ask my parents. Most of my
political views are shaped from how they raised me any
ways."
Meanwhile, freshman Ryan Woessner said he was
eager to weigh in on a tight Senate race in Minnesota.
"This is my first election I get to vote in." he said. "I'm
really excited to make a difference."
Still, the realities of modern-day bureaucracy are leav
ing Woessner out in the cold — and quite possibly without

a ballot. Having submitted an online ballot request two
weeks ago to no avail. Woessner has resorted to calling
local officials for updates and is considering sending his
ballot, if it ever arrives, via priority mail for $10.
"I'd pay up to $20," Woessner said. "I've wanted to vote
ever since I was little."
Often though, once the novelty wears off. so does the
turnout.
National commentators stress students have rarely had
more incentive to vote than now — barely five years re
moved from September 11,2001, in the midst of controver
sial conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan and with party control
of the United States Senate and House very much on the
line. But time and again, some students, especially upper
classmen, said they feel no direct connection to these is
sues. and will likely stay home as a result.
Atherton. Calif, resident Megan So, a senior, lives just a
10-minute drive from campus, and vividly remembers vot
ing as a sophomore in Florence Moore I lall in 2004.
"I voted because I was mad at my dad. who was voting
for Bush, so I told him I'm going to vote for Kerry to can
cel out his retarded vote," So said. "That's the last time I've
voted, and I don't know if I'm going to vote this time."
Generally politically apathetic. So was comfortable not
voting — until she learned about Proposition 85. which
would mandate parental notification for teenagers seeking
abortions, and Proposition 86. which would tack a hefty tax
on cigarettes. Now, she's considering heading to the polls
Hiesday.
But even if So does vote, her ballot will still reflect her
apathy.
"I might go vote on those propositions and still leave
everything else blank." So said. "I'm really, really luke
warm when it comes to politics."
