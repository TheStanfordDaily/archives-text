# When I was younger
## 
### 
From ages zero to four. 1 don't really re
member much, just a blur here and a
smudge there. Life at its beginning
stages is vague and ill-formed, both in mem
ory and in fact.
The first clear recollection (at least first
with a time stamp) is the closing ceremony
for the 1984 Olympic games.There were fire
works.
Even at the tender age of five I had a
worldview. Possibly not a smart or reasoned
one. but it was definitely there and, more
over, I knew the future.
I dreamt of being a pilot. Flying superfast
jets in between racing superfast cars. I think
everything was red as well (though I'm not
sure why).
Today, though, things are different. I don't
fly jets (glasses and colour-blindness made
joining the RAF a non-starter) and. although
my car is red. I'm usually the annoying chap
edging nervously along, well under the speed
limit and stopping every few seconds to
check that the road is still there.
Still, my dreams of speed were fleeting. A
transitory goal, as it were. And. as the years
went by. I set my sights on other, loftier
(though ground-based) targets.
From six to 10 (well actually I kind of still
think about this one. but it's sort of embar
rassing to admit that in print), I longed for
wishes.
Well, not so much "longed for." as as
sumed that at any moment a genie would be
arriving to grant me a triplet of desires.
The wishes of choice varied as time went
by, but the overarching themes were power,
grace and style. I would ask for wealth, super

powers (obviously) and knowledge.
Today, though, things are different. No ge
nies have come. No wishes have been grant
ed. And while I pray (to a God that doesn't
exist) for a little luck. I no longer believe in it.
It was 11.12 and early teenage years that
set me more firmly in the realm of reality. I
started to contemplate life as lawyer for a few
years, followed by a move to the business
world and control of a corporate empire.
Siv-C orp (inspired by I .ex 1 uthor,no less)
was going to be the greatest company the
world had ever seen. We would control
everything.Trillions would pour into our cof
fers and we would use it to build a new. better
world.
Today, though, things are different. I still
want the world (who doesn't), but Siv-Corp
rarely crosses my mind. My interest in the law
extends only as far as the sandwiches in the
Law School and the thought of corporate life
makes me feel slightly ill.
Fourteen. That was when the career path
was truly laid down. I was going to be a scien
tist. Whilst there had been leanings previous
ly (like when I created a new substance with
my chemistry set at the tender age of 11). 14
was when I stopped looking for other things

to (Jo.
Of course. I was going to he Einstein. And
Gauss (well that one was only after I heard of
him). And Pasteur. And every other great
man and woman to grace the world of sci
ence.
Today, though, things are different.Today
I'm happy if 1 understand another line in a
textbook. I 'm delirious when something gets
published. And Ill probably reach the pinna
cle of I lomo Sapiens joy if I manage to get a
postdoc when I finish.
Teenage years are also where I started to
form the rest of my worldviews. Puberty con
vinced me that girls were not. in fact, ieky, so
I decided I was going to be a 20th century
Casanova. A brief side career as a porn star
was contemplated and much material was
studied to this end.
Today, though, things are different. I did
n't actually get laid until the 21st century, so
that whole Casanova thing never panned out
— strangely, women didn't throw themselves
at slightly awkward, spindly math majors
whilst I was at university.
As for the porn star plan... well, let's just
say that puberty ended and I realized that
nothing was going to grow any bigger.
Those barren years in college were when
the bitterness set in. I swiftly realized that
since I was no Newton and no Don Juan. I
needed a life philosophy to match.
Religion had been ditched a long time
previously; now I removed everything else
that had no basis in reason. Anything mysti
cal was rejected — no Karma, no fate and no
