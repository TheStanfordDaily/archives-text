## To vote or not to vote: Wasting time in the political circus 
### BLAKE MASTERS 
I love national elections. Observing one is
like going to the circus, only a few billion
dollars more expensive. Every election
TUesday we're treated with some of the most
entertaining and captivating spectacles
known to the modern world. It you don't be
lieve me, just check out all of the neat things
we get to enjoy: We can watch our friends
duke it out in meaningless "political" de
bates. Admire the Reps' and Dems' smear
campaigns. Pretend that it's the good guys vs.
the bad guys, that Prop. 98383 is going to do
something other than increase state power or
that the system is really "representative."
Watch an entire nation get sold on the idea
that the mainstream left-right spectrum con

stitutes the entire range of political philoso
phy, instead of the tiny sliver so cleverly prop
agandized and inflated by the state-corpo
rate complex. It would truly be hilarious it
the stakes weren't so high.
The great American satirist H.L. Menck
en once wrote that every election is an ad
vance auction of stolen goods. And he's right.
People who support what we euphemistical
ly call "democracy" or "representative gov
ernment" support stealing certain kinds of
goods and redistributing them as they see tit.
Of course, these supporter-bandits often dis
agree with one another on what to loot and
what to do with it. We call the two main
camps of bandits Democrats and Republi
cans. And in our frantic partisan rush we
completely ignore that a) voting is economi

cully pointless, b) the great majority of voters
are acting immorally when they go to the
polls and e) the scope of political debate in
this country is pathetic.
Fconomically speaking, you're wasting
your time at the polls. Sure.you can get all pa
triotic on me and claim some subjective inner
fulfillment of your duty as a good citizen and
all that mumbo jumbo. Fine. I can't argue
with you there. But your vote is meaningless
and it will not affect the outcome. Period.
"But wait!" cry the ever-faithful, "if every
body did it. then we could, like, change the
worldY"lliis is certainly true, but that doesn't
make it a smart thing to say.Try entering into
any serious economic or constitutional polit-
ical debate armed with the argument
that "things would work out if every
body did them" and see what hap
pens. II you prevail, then guess what?
You weren't engaged in a serious de
bate.
"What? The majority of voters are
acting immorally? What the heck are
you talking about?" No. I 'm not going
to give you the blanket "voting is im
moral" argument that my fellow lib
ertarian peers love to make. For vot
ing can indeed be immoral, but is not
necessarily so. For example, if 1 vote in
support of aggression against inno
cent people, then that's wrong. 1
shouldn't need to explain why. Simi
larly. voting for a tax increase that af
fects other people besides one's self is
wrong on the same principle. Since
most people do indeed vote for these
things, it's safe to say that most people
are voting to increase coercion
against others.That, I argue, is a moral
no-no. If you disagree, then we're
faced with quite a conundrum! 11mm,

perhaps we can settle our differences
with a mob vote and then use force
against the minority? If that's not in
sanity, 1 don't know what is.
So when is voting OK? Perhaps
an example will help. If a gunman
came into your house, for example,
and demanded either your wallet or
your car, would it be immoral for you
to choose between them? Not at all.
It would, however, be wrong to say.
"Actually, sir, take my wallet and
then please go next door to my
neighbor's house and steal his wallet
too because I think he should be
spending more of his money on pub
lic abortions, free education, oil sub
sidies and eradicating evil from the
face of the planet." What I'm saying
is so common-sensical that it should
be clear to any second grade student
in America. So long as they don't at
tend a government school, that is.
As far as the limited scope of ac
ceptable or mainstream political dis
course goes, I suspect most of you
will already agree with me from the
start. In fact, spending five minutes
talking politics with someone who
disagrees with this statement will
likely prove it to be true. As the say
ing goes, "When everyone thinks

alike, no one's really thinking."
I encourage you not to vote today,
because it's simply not worth your
time. You're merely choosing what
you see as the most appealing of var
ious forms of coercion that will be
applied to you and your friends, and
perhaps providing some tacit con
sent to the special interests that run
the show in the process. If you must
vote, of course, it seems that a vote
for less state control (less organized
violence) would be the way to go.
But let's be honest; it's a waste of
time and you know it. So my advice is
to kick back, crack open a beer or
two and enjoy the show.
My prediction? Dems take the
house with 230 seats while Reps
keep Senate by two seats. Which, of
course, is the best scenario: Imagine
getting attacked by two bandits at
the same time, who end up not being
able to loot anything because they
argue over what to take until they
get fed up (pun intended) and shoot
each other. Ah. the joys of the split
Congress!
Happy Voting.
