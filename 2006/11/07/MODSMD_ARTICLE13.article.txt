## To vote or not to vote: Wasting time in the political circus 
### BLAKE MASTERS 
I love national elections. Observing one is
like going to the circus, only a few billion
dollars more expensive. Every election
TUesday we're treated with some of the most
entertaining and captivating spectacles
known to the modern world. It you don't be
lieve me, just check out all of the neat things
we get to enjoy: We can watch our friends
duke it out in meaningless "political" de
bates. Admire the Reps' and Dems' smear
campaigns. Pretend that it's the good guys vs.
the bad guys, that Prop. 98383 is going to do
something other than increase state power or
that the system is really "representative."
Watch an entire nation get sold on the idea
that the mainstream left-right spectrum con

stitutes the entire range of political philoso
phy, instead of the tiny sliver so cleverly prop
agandized and inflated by the state-corpo
rate complex. It would truly be hilarious it
the stakes weren't so high.
The great American satirist H.L. Menck
en once wrote that every election is an ad
vance auction of stolen goods. And he's right.
People who support what we euphemistical
ly call "democracy" or "representative gov
ernment" support stealing certain kinds of
goods and redistributing them as they see tit.
Of course, these supporter-bandits often dis
agree with one another on what to loot and
what to do with it. We call the two main
camps of bandits Democrats and Republi
cans. And in our frantic partisan rush we
completely ignore that a) voting is economi

cully pointless, b) the great majority of voters
are acting immorally when they go to the
polls and e) the scope of political debate in
this country is pathetic.
Fconomically speaking, you're wasting
your time at the polls. Sure.you can get all pa
triotic on me and claim some subjective inner
fulfillment of your duty as a good citizen and
all that mumbo jumbo. Fine. I can't argue
with you there. But your vote is meaningless
and it will not affect the outcome. Period.
"But wait!" cry the ever-faithful, "if every
body did it. then we could, like, change the
worldY"lliis is certainly true, but that doesn't
make it a smart thing to say.Try entering into
any serious economic or constitutional polit-
