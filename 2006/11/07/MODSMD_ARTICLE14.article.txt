## FIELD HOCKEY Hockey falls to Cal in title game After win over Appalachian State, Card drop Championship match to No. 13 Bears. 3-1 
### ANNA PARLIN 
After defeating Appalachian State 3-0 in the semifinals of
the Northern Pacific Athletic Conference Championships,
the Stanford field hockey team suffered a 3-1 loss to No. 13
California in the tournament finals.
Because Stanford (9-10,5-1 NorPac) was seeded second
in the tournament, the team received a first-round bye and
entered directly into the semifinals. Cal (16-4, 6-0) also re
ceived a bye, while Appalachian State. Radford. Davidson
and Pacific had to battle it out on Thursday. Appalachian
State (2-16.0-6) upset Pacific 3-2 to advance to the semifinals,
and had to face the Cardinal on Friday.
"Appalachian State had not beaten a Division-I team all
season, and we had geared our game plan toward Pacific,"
sophomore Bailey Richardson said."We were shocked at the
outcome.That night, we had an emergency team meeting be
cause Appalachian State doesn't have any standout players
like Pacific. So we focused more on our own game plan and
didn't gear our play toward the other team."
Junior Jess Zutz scored two goals in the game against Ap
palachian State, helping Stanford earn a 3-0 victory.The Car
dinal came out onto the field in full force, with Zutz scoring
her first goal a mere 55 seconds into the game. She fired an
other one at 31:40 off of freshman Jennifer Luther's assist,
enabling the team to walk off the field with a 2-0 halftime
lead.
At 61:18, sophomore Bailey Richardson tallied another
Stanford goal to increase the Cardinal lead to 3-0. Both sen
ior Julia Drewes and sophomore I lillary Braun were credit
ed with assists. Stanford took 18 shots on Mountaineer goal
keeper Mikayla Paulson as opposed to Appalachian State's
four. Cardinal junior goalkeeper Madison Bell tallied three
saves in the game.
The win over the Mountaineers enabled the Cardinal to
move onto the finals of the NorPac tournament,
where they faced defending champion Cal. Despite a
valiant effort, Stanford could not withstand the Gold
en Bears' pressure and went down in a 3-1 loss.
Cal's senior Valentina Godfrid and sophomore
Ashley Glosz scored the first two goals of the game at
21:22 and 24:51. respectively. Just five minutes later,
Stanford senior Jamie Hais' unassisted goal made it a
one-goal game. Though the Cardinal came close to
tying up the score when a shot by sophomore Caro
line Hussey hit the crossbar just before halftime, the
first half ended with a 2-1 Cal lead.
Godfrid scored once again at 61:59, which proved
to be the final goal of the game. Though Bell made
four saves, the Golden Bears outshot the Cardinal 11-
7 and walked off the field as NorPac Conference
Champions.
Though the season may not have ended with the
title the team had hoped for, Stanford finished the
season with many individual honors. Zutz, Drewes
and senior Aska Sturdevan were three of 11 confer
ence players selected to the All-NorPac first team.
Bell and Richardson were both named second-team
all-league.
In addition, Nora Soza was named NorPac Fresh
man of the Year and sophomore Chloe Bade received
the Julie Nagle Extraordinary Teammate Award,

which is given to the conference player who most
"shows extraordinary care and support of her team
mates, genuine love for the sport and her academic in
stitution, possesses a great spirit and has deep appre
ciation for life and those around her."
Zutz leads the Cardinal in points with 34 (13 goals,
eight assists) and is ranked fifth in the conference.
Drewes, Stanford's next highest scorer, is ranked sev
enth in the NorPac with 23 points (nine goals, five as
sists). Sturdevan's 14 points (six goals, two assists)
placed her at tenth place in the conference.
Bell, who played every minute of every game this
season, has been named NorPac Defensive Player of
the Week four times this season and is ranked first in
the league in save percentage with an average of .738.
Richardson has helped both the offense and defense;
she is second on the team in number of assists with
seven, and has worked on defense to help the Cardi
nal earn three shutouts.
Having now finished all conference play, the team
only has the NCAA Tournament ahead, but its partic
ipation in that is pending wildcard results.
"The thing to focus on is that despite a 9-10 record,
this season was such an improvement and a step up,"
Bell said."We were pleased with how the season went,
and also looking optimistically forward because we're
a young team."
