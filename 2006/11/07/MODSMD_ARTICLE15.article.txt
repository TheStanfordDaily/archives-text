# Taking down the champs
## soccer beats Cal for the first time in ten tries to close regular season 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a dramatic end to the Cardinal's
best conference showing since 2002,
senior Galen Thompson led the Stan
ford men's soccer team to a 2-1 victory
over No. 10 California on Friday with a
game-winning goal in overtime.
After receiving a cross from junior
Dan Shapiro only a few minutes into the
extra period, Thompson maneuvered
around a Cal defender and managed to
find net past junior goalie Justin Meyers.
The goal gave the Cardinal (7-7-4,5-3-2
Pacific-10 Conference) its first victory
over Cal (12-5-1,7-3) in the last 10 meet
ings between the teams. Thompson and
the rest of the team were excited to fin
ish the season with a win over the con
ference's best team.
"It doesn't get much better than an
overtime win over Cal,"Thompson said.
"They are always a good team, and they

had a great season to win the Pac-10. It
is very nice to finally beat them when
they are at the top of their game."
Hie Bears jumped out to an early
lead, with a goal by leading scorer junior
Javier Ayala-Mill at 9:01. However.
Stanford outshot Cal 6-5 in the first half
and was finally rewarded with a goal by
its own leading scorer, junior Evan Mor
gan, in the 30th minute. It was Morgan's
fifth goal of the year.
Throughout the second half, the
teams remained tied 1-1. though the
Cardinal continued to dominate the of
fensive effort, outshooting the Bears 5-
4. Keepers for both teams were kept
busy during the match. Meyers posted
five saves for Cal in his l ) 7 minutes, while
freshman John Moore had two before
being replaced by redshirt freshman
Brent Stewart at the break. Stewart also
registered two saves.
At the end of regulation. Iliompson
said that coach Bret Simon told the

team to avoid giving the Bears opportu
nities by staying composed on offense.
"Going into overtime we were trying
to make sure we didn't get caught too
far forward and give up a counter at
tack." Thompson said. "Coach wanted
us to pick our chances and go forward
without leaving ourselves exposed at
the back. We did what he said, kept good
possession and allowed ourselves to get
into the attack and get a goal."
Simon also reminded the Cardinal to
be patient in case play was extended by
two full overtime periods.
"The only thing I emphasized going
into overtime was keeping our focus and
not getting too excited." Simon said.
"The important thing was to realize that
despite the overtime being golden goal,
there can be a full 20 minutes [of extra
play]."
Stanford, though, got excited only six

and a half minutes into the first over
time, when Thompson launched his shot.
Thompson, who was named Pac-10
Player of the Week for the second time
this season, was happy to end his career
at Stanford on a high note.
"I think this would have to replace
the San Diego State win as the best mo
ment of my career,"Thompson said. "To
finish the last game of the season with
an overtime golden goal over Cal (is)
the kind of thing you dream about your
whole career. Doing it at home in front
of a great crowd made it even better."
However, even with the Cal upset,
the Cardinal were overlooked by the
selection committee for the NCAA
College Cup Tournament. At-large bids
were granted to Cal, San Diego State

(9-5-4, 5-2-3) and UCLA (10-5-4, 4-3-
3). Despite the Bruins' fourth-place
Pac-10 finish behind Cal, San Diego
State and Stanford, UCLA was seeded
a conference-high eighth overall due to
its strength of schedule, as it met seven
of the tournament's 48 teams over the
course of the season.
Regardless, Simon is planning for the
future, and is looking forward to off-sea
son preparation that might bring about
another competitive year for the team.
"The end of a season is always bitter
sweet," Simon said. "I'll miss many of
the guys on the team and 1 believe this
group's best days lie ahead.
"I 'm certainly proud of our seniors,"
Simon continued. "They really were
great people to coach, and have helped
us get back to being competitive with
the best teams. I'm thrilled with the di
rection we are headed, but lots of hard
work sits in front of us, and we need to
have a great off-season to make the
next big stride."

possession and allowed ourselves to get
into the attack and get a goal."
Simon also reminded the Cardinal to
be patient in case play was extended by
two full overtime periods.
"The only thing I emphasized going
into overtime was keeping our focus and
not getting too excited." Simon said.
"The important thing was to realize that
despite the overtime being golden goal,
there can be a full 20 minutes [of extra
play]."
Stanford, though, got excited only six

match in 1 0 meetings with the Bears, 2-1, with an overtime goal by senior Galen Thompson.
and a half minutes into the first over
time, when Thompson launched his shot.
Thompson, who was named Pac-10
Player of the Week for the second time
this season, was happy to end his career
at Stanford on a high note.
"I think this would have to replace
the San Diego State win as the best mo
ment of my career,"Thompson said. "To
finish the last game of the season with
an overtime golden goal over Cal (is)
the kind of thing you dream about your
whole career. Doing it at home in front
of a great crowd made it even better."
However, even with the Cal upset,
the Cardinal were overlooked by the
selection committee for the NCAA
College Cup Tournament. At-large bids
were granted to Cal, San Diego State

(9-5-4, 5-2-3) and UCLA (10-5-4, 4-3-
3). Despite the Bruins' fourth-place
Pac-10 finish behind Cal, San Diego
State and Stanford, UCLA was seeded
a conference-high eighth overall due to
its strength of schedule, as it met seven
of the tournament's 48 teams over the
course of the season.
Regardless, Simon is planning for the
future, and is looking forward to off-sea
son preparation that might bring about
another competitive year for the team.
"The end of a season is always bitter
sweet," Simon said. "I'll miss many of
the guys on the team and 1 believe this
group's best days lie ahead.
"I 'm certainly proud of our seniors,"
Simon continued. "They really were
great people to coach, and have helped
us get back to being competitive with
the best teams. I'm thrilled with the di
rection we are headed, but lots of hard
work sits in front of us, and we need to
have a great off-season to make the
next big stride."
