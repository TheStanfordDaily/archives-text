# Viva la Copa Cardenal

### 
TT'm in a good mood.
Yes, with Thanksgiving just
around the corner. I've got a lot to be
thankful for this week.
After braving a two-and-a-half
hour trek to Berkeley via an odd
combination of biking, running,
boarding the ( allium and BART,
starting an impressive collection of
Sacagawea coins and being ridiculed
for reading a book on Christian dat
ing. I arrived at Cal's I laas Pavilion.
I was just m time that Friday night to
cover the No. 2 Stanford women's
volleyball team take on the Bears.
My voyage back to Stanford was a
much quicker and more enjoyable
experience aboard the team's char
tered bus. Hie Cardinal squad was
nice enough to give me a ride, and I
owe them a thousand thanks for their
generosity.
I also need to give a shot out to
Tom Brady for throwing four inter
ceptions— even though he was re
sponsible for only two of them —
keeping my Colts' record unblem
ished as they continue their march to
ward the Super Bowl.
1 offer thanks to the football fans
who stayed loyal to the Cardinal this
past Saturday and put together a
giant "We Believe in Stanford Foot
ball" banner, despite about three
quarters of the stadium waving two
fingers in "victory"
My final thanks must go to a spe-
