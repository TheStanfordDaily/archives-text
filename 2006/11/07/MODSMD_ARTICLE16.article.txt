# Viva la Copa Cardenal

### 
TT'm in a good mood.
Yes, with Thanksgiving just
around the corner. I've got a lot to be
thankful for this week.
After braving a two-and-a-half
hour trek to Berkeley via an odd
combination of biking, running,
boarding the ( allium and BART,
starting an impressive collection of
Sacagawea coins and being ridiculed
for reading a book on Christian dat
ing. I arrived at Cal's I laas Pavilion.
I was just m time that Friday night to
cover the No. 2 Stanford women's
volleyball team take on the Bears.
My voyage back to Stanford was a
much quicker and more enjoyable
experience aboard the team's char
tered bus. Hie Cardinal squad was
nice enough to give me a ride, and I
owe them a thousand thanks for their
generosity.
I also need to give a shot out to
Tom Brady for throwing four inter
ceptions— even though he was re
sponsible for only two of them —
keeping my Colts' record unblem
ished as they continue their march to
ward the Super Bowl.
1 offer thanks to the football fans
who stayed loyal to the Cardinal this
past Saturday and put together a
giant "We Believe in Stanford Foot
ball" banner, despite about three
quarters of the stadium waving two
fingers in "victory"
My final thanks must go to a spe-

The SoCal Bias
cial group on campus that rarely re

This past Sunday. Los Hermanos
de Stanford hosted their first annual
"Copa Cardenal," a soccer tourna
ment fundraiser benefiting Stan
ford's Dance Marathon.
The tournament ran from 10 a.m.
to 3 p.m. and consisted of four
rounds, including a first-round group
stage. Eighty players made up 16
five-member squads.
In the quarter-finals,"Bordele de
Bite" defeated the Burbank team;
"Team Del Playa" up-ended "Oran
je;" "The Ghana Boys" beat "AC
Zapata;" and "Pass the Face" se
cured a victory against "Hie Global
Ponies."
Bordele De Bite won out against
Team Del Playa in the semi-finals
while Pass the Face earned a spot in
the tourney finals by defeating The
Ghana Boys.
Pass the Face, consisting of
ThaisanTonthat, Jonnie Perez, Ross
Porter, Brian Rufio Inouye, Kasra
Omid-Zohoor, Ayo Jimoh and
Nathan Fenner defeatedThe Global
Ponies in the finals to win the tour
nament trophy — a soccer shoe
painted gold. A total of $160 was
raised for Dance Marathon.
"It was beautiful seeing so many
people come out to play some 'fut
bol' on such a beautiful day and for
such a good cause," said junior Juan
Mateos, Hermanos vice president.
"We're definitely thinking about
hosting a tournament again in the
future. Almost everybody who came
out kept a positive attitude and
helped make the event a success."
Copa Cardenal is just one of the
community service-based group's
many endeavors. Los Hermanos
sponsors a mentorship program
through which members spend
time with teens from the local com
munity and encourage them to go
to college. In the spring, the group
hosts "Club Caliente" to provide
scholarships for high-school stu
dents in the Bay Area and some
parts of the U.S.
"Our goal is to improve the male
minority image," Hermanos histo
rian Jose Padilla said. "We operate
chiefly through education, profes
sionalism and community service."
Despite so much involvement in
the community, Los Hermanos sel
dom garners much attention — and
the group wouldn't have it any other
way.
"We do community service for
the sake of serving the community
and helping our peers," Padilla said.
"It's not about the attention and
plastering of your name all over the
place — then it loses the point."
So Hermanos, keep doing what
you're doing. Maybe you'll even see
me later this year wearing one of
your black t-shirts — one that 1 did
n't steal from Mateos' room.
