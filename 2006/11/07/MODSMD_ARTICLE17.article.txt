## Mixed start in pair of tune-ups Wiggins sits out with bruise on as Card hold on in exhibition 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford women's basketball
team burst out of the gate last Fhursday at
Maples Pavilion, with a 103-57 exhibition win
over Chico State, but a more subdued 84-78
win over Love & Basketball on Saturday
showed the Cardinal lacking energy, specifi
cally that of a sidelined Candice Wiggins.
Junior guard Wiggins left Ihursdays
blowout of the Wildcats midway through the
first half with a supposed foot sprain. An MRI
before Saturday's game cleared Wiggins of
complications other than a bruise to her left
heel. The bruise was sore, though, so Wiggins
sat out the second exhibition.
When Wiggins left the court at B:2b in the
first half against Chico State, the Cardinal al
ready had a 29-16 lead, with Wiggins having
contributed only two points. laking the lead in
points then was senior post Brooke Smith,
who had a game-high 28 points in 23 minutes.
She was one of six Cardinal players to score in
the double digits. Forward Michelle Harrison
put forth a strong freshman effort with 12
points for the night, as all 12 members ot the
Cardinal spent time on the court.
Junior forward Amber Simons led the Wild
cats with 18 points and five rebounds, along with
senior guard Niki Simons, who had 11 points.
Despite their top-five rank among Division II
contenders, Chico State couldn t keep up with
the Division I Cardinal lor the entire night.
Leading 49-36 at the half. Stanford over
whelmed the physically weak Wildcats in the
second period, outscoring them 54-21. ( hico
State, coached by former C ardinal Molly
Goodenbour, was held to just a 34.4 shooting
percentage for the night, and ended up being
out-rebounded 53-28.
IWo days later, though, the Cardinal were
finding themselves lagging, despite a lead over
Love & Basketball for the entire game.
Taking charge in Wiggins absence again
were Smith and junior forward Kristen Newl-

in, who turned in 19 and 20 points, re
spectively. Love & Basketball, howev
er, did its best to counter the duo.
"They were really clamping in on
Brooke and New a lot," head coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "We need peo
ple opening it up â€” Candice would
normally do that."
Stanford started strongly in the first
half, gaining a 10-point lead within the
first five minutes, and going on to extend
that lead to as much as 15 near the end of
the half, which ended 50-37. However,
the Cardinal delved into mediocrity
with the start of the second half, in what
VanDerveer called a "D+" effort.
"Overall, it just wasn't inspired, es
pecially for a game that gave us a learn
ing opportunity to work without Can
dice," she said.
Love & Basketball came within six
after an 8-0 run to start the second half
, and although the Cardinal were able
to reaffirm their lead on a 7-0 run, a 10-
0 run by Love & Basketball in the last
four minutes kept Stanford on its toes.
The Cardinal then kept up its lead of no
more than seven to finish 84-78.
The large, aggressive Love & Basket
ball squad pressured Stanford, and made
24 of 32 free throws in the second half.
Also, freshmen point guards JJ Hones
and Melanie Murphy (six and four
points, respectively) struggled against a

large and aggressive Love & Basketball
squad that forced 23 total turnovers.
"They're tough players, they were
very competitive, and they forced a lot
of turnovers," Newlin said. "We needed
to focus and keep up, but that didn't
happen."
Instead, the upperclassmen were re
lied upon in the net. Sophomore for
ward Jillian Harmon had 12 points and
six rebounds while junior guard Cissy
Pierce stepped up with 14 points.
"I think Cissy's improved a lot,"
VanDerveer said. "We can expect a lot
more from her this season."
Overall, though, VanDerveer and
the rest of the squad were disappointed
by the team's effort, acknowledging the
energy and tempo Wiggins normally
brings to the game.
"1 think we really realized just how
much we miss Candice's energy, and we
need to find other ways to generate
that," Smith said." We were all out there,
and I think this really was, as coach said,
a missed learning opportunity; we just
didn't take advantage of it."
The team hopes that there are few
other opportunities without Wiggins
and she returns to full health soon. Van-
Derveer avoided speculating on Wig
gins' return, and she doesn't know if it
will be before this Thursday's start of
the preseason Women's National Invi
tation Tournament.
"For me, she has to be 100 percent
again," VanDerveer said.
