of new faces to the court, a year after
failing to make the NCAA Tourna
ment for the first time since the I 1 )93-
IW4 season. Only two starters from
last year's squad are back this season,
and one —junior forward Taj Finger

lar season opener against Sienna.

will likely be joined in the starting
lineup by sophomore Mitch Johnson,
sophomore Anthony Goods, sopho
more Lawrence Hill and senior l ied
Washington. But since it is an exhibi
tion. Coach I rent Johnson reported

find out as much as we can about our
basketball team before Saturday.
