### JACK SALISBURY 
The three-time defending nation
al champion Stanford women's ten
nis team finished off its fall tourna
ment season this past weekend at the
Inter-Collegiate Tennis Association's
National Indoors at Ohio State I Jm
versity.
Coach Frankie Brennan had pre
viously described the tournament as
the "toughest" of the year. With three

players in the main singles draw of 32
and one duo in the doubles portion
of the tournament. Stanford did not
come home empty-handed.
Celia Durkin completed an im
pressive run through the consolation
bracket, winning the championship
after she defeated Cal's Zsuzsanna
Fodoron Sunday. Ilie final took three
sets to decide, with Durkin winning
the long and grueling match by a final
tally of (v4. *4-6.7-6 (6). Brcnnan was
impressed by Dm kin's perseverance
in a match he described as "brutal."
Durkin won three consecutive
matches on her way to the consolation finals,
besting Pacific-10 Conference opponents from
both UCLA and Southern California.
Head coach Lele lorood had nothing but
praise for Durkin.
"it was a very strong tournament for Celia,"
she said. "She did a good job of winning some
very, very tough matches."
Sophomore Jessica Nguyen was the only
member of the Cardinal to advance past the first
round of the main singles draw after defeating
heralded USC freshman Sarah Fansler.
She had less success in the second round,
though, where she faced off against junior Jele
na Pandzic of Fresno Pacific (a National Asso
ciation of Intercollegiate Athletics school).
Pandzic would go on to reach the finals of the
tournament.
"I thought I played well,and I've had a good
fall season so far," Nguyen said."! hope to carry
it through the [winter] season as well."
The final Cardinal to compete in the ITA
National Indoors was senior Theresa Logar.
Logar, who reached the 112 inals of the National
Indoors last season, ended up having a disap
pointing tournament after bowing out in the
first round.
"Theresa had a tough couple of matches,"
Brennan said. "1 think she put a little too much
pressure on herself to reproduce what she did
last year."
l orood agreed with Brennan that Logar had
a difficult time living up to her lofty accomplish
ments from last year.
"Ilieresa was trying to live up to her finalist
position, and unfortunately it just didn't work
out for her," she said. "We'll get her going pret
ty soon."
In the doubles portion of the main draw.
Durkin and Nguyen had ;i first-round victory
over Duke's duo of senior Daniela Bercek and
freshman Elizabeth Plotkin.The team eventu
ally lost in the second round, though, against
William and Mary's senior Megan Moulton-
Levy and sophomore Katarina Zoricic.
"They just couldn't quite get it together,"
Brennan said. "Celia and Jessica will keep im-.,
proving."
Brennan described the team's overall per
formance as far from its best, but still displaying
some of the Cardinal's potential for the season.
"We sent a pretty good message that we still
have some good depth, but then again it's still
early in the season," he said.
I laving concluded its fall tournament season,
Stanford will next play in Honolulu against the
University of Hawaii duringllianksgiving break.
Brennan described the trip as an opportunity for
the team to have a "bonding experience."
After its match in I lawaii. the team will have a
clean slate until the start of the regular season in

January. Between this time, Brennan said that the
team will focus on the current deficiencies of
some of the players. In particular, many individual
players will work to fine-tune certain strokes and
certain shots. Several of the team's members also
live in Southern California, so they will be able to
get together to refine their respective games.
"1 would say that, as a whole, 1 think we did

a little bit better than expected [because of the
many team injuries]," Brennan said. "Qualify
ing three girls for the National Indoors is a pret
ty big accomplishment. It's not any drop-off
from last year. We were still missing [senior]
Anne [Yelsey]. and that's a big part of the puz
zle. Lele and I were both happy with the way
things went."
