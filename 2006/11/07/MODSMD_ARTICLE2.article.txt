# Kramer proposes overhaul
## Law School dean targets second and third years for changes, suggests joint master's degree program 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last month,The New York Times ran an article detail
ing the "21st century" tune-up Harvard Law School has
given its first-year curriculum. But changes brewing at
Stanford Law School could soon make Harvard's publici

ty-grabbing updates obsolete — and transform American
legal education along the way.
An email recently sent by Dean Larry Kramer to law
students outlined proposed overhauls to the Law School's
curriculum that focus on the second and third and intro
duce joint degrees that can be completed in the same time
as a single J.D.
"The problem is that legal education has traditionally
involved teaching one skill (thinking like a lawyer), and
doing so for three years," Kramer wrote. "The second and
third year curriculum is thus best described as'more of the
same.'"
According to the Kramer, almost every law graduate in
the country says that the first year of law school formed

the most significant part of their legal education. Often,
graduates said, their interest waned during the last two
years.
"It is, from that perspective,puzzling to see not just I lar
vard.but most schools that think about curriculum reform
focus all their energy on changing the first year," he said.
Instead of following in 1 larvard's footsteps, Kramer is
proposing that upper level courses should teach students
"how to think like the client" after the first year has taught
them "how to think like a lawyer."
To do that. Kramer proposes revamping Stanford's
clinical programs to attract and accommodate more stu-
ilents. introduce more upper-level
nurses where faculty and senate
problem solve together and encour
:e students to think about public
service.
But the centerpiece of the curric
ula overhaul are 20 joint J.D. and
inastei s degrees that students could
. omplete within three years — the
>ame time it currently takes to finish
i standard law degree.
"No other school has thought to
iio anything like this." Kramer said
in an interview with The Daily. "I
don't know why."
Not only would a master's degree
ive law students the skills and
knowledge the\ need to work with
l iients in the specific legal fields that
interest them, he said, but it would
also be "affordable and accessible to
students with no intellectual trade
off.
Before Kramer can begin hand
ing out two sheepskins instead of
one. however, the joint degree pro
grams must first be approved by the
Committee on Graduate Studies. It
is unclear how long that might take.
I'he issue is time," said Lindi
Press, a committee staff member.
This is a big change, and it can't be
discussed in two minutes."
According to Kramer, the joint
degree programs were scheduled
last spring to be discussed by the
committee on Nov. 1, but Press said
that was "a mistaken assumption"
by the dean.
She added that the committee
will begin discussing the proposal at
its Nov. 15 meeting but that the com
mittee may need more than one
meeting to make a final recommen
dation.
"It's going to be discussed." Press
said. "It's not being hidden under a
rock."
