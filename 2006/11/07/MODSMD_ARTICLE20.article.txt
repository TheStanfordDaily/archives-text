### ROXIE DICKINSON 
After being forced to suspend
play due to darkness, the Stanford
men's golf team came out on top last
night at the Corde Valle Tournament
in San Martin,Calif.The Cardinal are
overwhelmingly ahead of the second
and third-place competitors, Lamar
University and Arizona, respectively.
Though the second round is incom
plete, up to this point the Cardinal
are 22 under par, a full eight strokes
ahead of Lamar.
Leading the team to its significant
lead entering the third round is senior
captain Zack Miller. Finishing nine
under par in the second round, with
ten birdies and one eagle, Miller's
score of 63 broke the course record.
After an even par first round. Miller
was in 31st-place individually, but
went to first after the second round.
"1 was pretty upset with my first
round." Miller said. "1 played well
enough to shoot a 72 [even par] in the
first round, but 1 know that 1 under
achieved. Because 1 was upset with
how I played in the first round, 1
played with more aggression in the
second round. It was amazing; I have
never hit it so well before. 1 had
amazing putting which compliment
ed my ball striking.This was the best
round I could've asked for."
Head coach Conrad Ray was also
proud of Miller s second round.
"Zack's round was really impres
sive." he said. "His second round is
probably one of the five lowest
rounds Stanford golf history."
In second place is Dan Doyle of
Northwestern, who is eight under par
with two holes remaining. Tied for
third was fellow Cardinal junior Rob
Grube. Grube started the day three
under par in a tie for ninth but came
back in the second round,shooting five

birdies and an eagle to put him seven
under par overall. Only two strokes
separate the four-way tie for third, in
the very close individual competition.
I m really glad that 1 could help
with the consistent play for today,"
(Irube said. "We just have one round
left today, but it looks like we're
going to have a really good team
score and hopefully we can come
away with a win."
following Grube among the
Stanlord team was senior Matt Sav
age, with an overall two under par.
Savage had a four-under-par first
round, putting him in fifth place
going into the second round. How
ever, the second round proved to be
more difficult for Savage; a score of
two over par put him in a tie for 16th
overall.
The two Stanford freshmen,
Joseph Bramlett and Jordan Cox, are
neck-and-neck in a tie for 25th going
into today's third round. Though
they were unable to finish the second
round last night due to darkness,
Bramlett and Cox both had identical
rounds, each coming out with an
even par for the first round and one
under par for the second round.
Bramlett scored a total of six birdies
yesterday while Cox shot four birdies
and an eagle, keeping the two tied.
To finish up the second round,
play began at 7:00 a.m. today, with
the third round to follow at 8:30 a.m.
"We have really good chances to
morrow," Ray said. "We have to keep
up our level of play because we are in a
really good field. We are confident
going into today's rounds, and hopeful
ly we can produce a good outcome."
The Cardinal are in a great posi
tion going into today's finale. All five
golfers sit in the top 25 of the tourna
ment, with two in the top five posi
tions. Miller and Grube have their
work cut out for them with the top 10
individuals separated by only four
strokes. Stanford hopes to maintain
its lead and take home its third win to
close out the fall season.
