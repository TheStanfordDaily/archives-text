remaining in regulation to end Stan

For the first time in months, the
Cardinal (13-6-1, 6-2-1 Pacific-10

game in possession and shots. Play
ing without its leading scorer, fresh
man Kelley O'Hara, Stanford did not
find an offensive opportunity until 34
minutes into the game. Freshman
forward Alicia Jenkins fought past
(he Bears' defense, but her shot went
wide of the frame.
California (11-4-5,3-3-3), howev
er, found its first scoring opportunity
two minutes after the start of the
game and followed up with three

more shots. The Bears found their
best chance in the first half, 20 min
utes after the start, when freshman
forward Lisa Kevorkia nearly took
the lead for the Bears on a break
away play. Junior goalkeeper Erica
Holland made a diving save to knock
the ball off course.
Holland made three key saves
fewer than 20 minutes later to deny
the Bears the scoreboard. Bears jun
ior Caroline Lea had the first shot on
goal, but Holland made another div
ing play to keep the ball out of the
net. Sophomore defender Marisa
Abegg cleared the ball.
At the close of the first half, the
game remained scoreless, with Cal
outshooting the Cardinal 7-2. The
Bears continued to dominate posses
sion after the restart. Senior midfield
er Nadia Al-Lami shot a header on
goal, but Holland denied her. The
Cardinal followed with an indirect
free kick from senior midfielder
Shari Summers to sophomore Alli
son Falk.but Falk's header went high.
Stanford's best scoring opportuni
ty of the game came when freshman
forward Ali Riley's shot was deflected
off a Cal defender to the right side of
the net. Bears goalkeeper Anna Key
recovered from the defensive error
and kept Stanford off the scoreboard.
Less than five minutes later, Riley
fought past Cal's defense on a break
away play. The Bears' defense ended
the play when they cleared Sum
mers' shot. Fifteen minutes later,
with fewer than five minutes to play
in the game, sophomore midfielder
Lea MacKinnon sent Jenkins the ball
for one final opportunity. Jenkins'
shot went high.
The Bears responded to the at
tack by earning an indirect free kick
that set up the final, game-winning
play. With one minute left in regula
tion, California senior Alivia Mazura
sent the kick to Kevorkian, who
headed the ball off the frame. Fresh
man Brianna Bak headed the re
bound into the back of the net for the
only goal of the game.

shots on goal. Erica Holland ended
the weekend with a season-high six
saves. The Cardinal drops to third in
