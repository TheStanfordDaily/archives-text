Proposition 1a
This proposition earmarks transportation funding for projects that relieve congested areas ot traf
fic. It also enables safety and overall improvements to be enacted on local streets and roads. It stops
the state from allowing any type of sales tax on car fuels for any purpose other than improvements
in transportation. It authorizes loans of these funds only to be enacted in the case of major state debt.
If this happens the proposition allows for loans of revenues that are taken Ironi states sales tax on car
fuels to be fully repaid within three years. It also restricts loans from being given more than twice in
any 10-year period.
PRO —I"his proposition will make it so that our tax dollars will actually be used for road and
transportation projects and not given to other facts that don't help the general public. This will also
enable new roads and highways to be constructed. This will help our overall economy as our trans
portation mechanism for carrying goods will be more efficient.
CON — The problem with this proposition is if the economy declines in the future too much
money will be spent on new roads and better transportation mechanisms and not enough on welfare,
health care and public education.
Proposition 1b
This act makes safety improvements and repairs to state highways, upgrades freeways to re
duce congestion, repairs local streets and roads, upgrades highways along major transportation
corridors, improves seismic safety of local bridges, expands public transit, helps complete the
state's network of car pool lanes, reduces air pollution and improves anti-terrorism security at
shipping ports by providing for a bond issue not to exceed $19,925 billion. Fiscal Impact: State
costs of approximately $38.9 billion over 30 years to repay bonds.
PRO — The proposition jumpstarts traffic relief, mass transit and safety improvements in every cor
ner of the state without raising taxes. 1B builds new roads and transportation improvement projects that
enhance mobility and protect our economic future.
CON — California cannot afford to continue borrowing its way into a false sense of economic se
curity. More borrowing means worsening budget deficits. A no vote will force the Legislature to
focus on paying for our transportation needs with existing funds in a fiscally responsible manner.
Proposition lc
Proposition IC, also known as "Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006," re
volves around the creation of shelters for "battered women and their children" and disadvantaged
seniors.
The proposition also offers aid for the disabled, veterans and "working families" as well as offer
ing home assistance in repairs and accessibility to living spaces. In order to create these portions of
the proposition, California will issue $2,850,000,000 in bonds, having been paid with pre-existing
funds from the state.
PRO — With such groups as Habitat for Humanity (San Diego), AARP and the California Part
nership to End Domestic Violence united in support for this bill, one is assured that it bridges several
unique constituencies. These groups site the Proposition's effect on creating jobs, helping victims of do
mestic violence, and aiding senior citizens in independent home ownership as the basis for their support.
CON — Opponents of Proposition IC, notably California State Congressman Chuck DeVore,
call the initiative "fiscally irresponsible," noting that the bill relies upon the sale of bonds. This sale
of bonds, according to the opposition's argument, will exert pressure upon the legislature to raise
taxes for ('alifornians through a lack of capital for priority expenditures, those cited include schools,
prisons, and highways.
Proposition Id
Proposition ID would issue a $10 billion bond to fund public education. Specifically, the money
would go to earthquake renovation, vocational education in science and technical fields, expand
classrooms to meet a growing population and increase energy efficiency in public schools. The bond
would, after interest, end up costing the state $20 billion. Over half the funds would go to K-12
schools (including charter schools), while $3.1 billion to state colleges and universities.
PRO — Proponents argue that California schools are in desperate need of funding for renova
tion and expansion, and argue that Proposition Id would deliver this boost. Teachers unions are
among the largest supporters of 11).
CON — Opponents argue that the proposition does not adequately address the gap between rich
and poor school districts. By providing for local governments to "match" the funds allocated under
the bond measure it would give an increased advantage to richer areas.

Proposition 1e
Proposition IF. would authorize as 4 billion bond act to fund repairs to California's flood control
mechanisms. Specifically, levee failures, flash floods and mudslides would be addressed. Repairing
levees would also address the security of California's drinking water supply. The bond would cost the
state around $8 billion after the interest is paid off. Local property taxes would likely be reduced to
adjust for the state's larger role in these responsibilities.
PRO Supporters contend that the failure of the levee system in Katrina is a reminder of how
important it is to protect against flooding. This bond, they argue, is necessary to keep California pre
pared for a natural disaster.
CON Opponents say that California cannot afford another multi-billion dollar bond measure.
Furthermore, levees and other flood control structures are local responsibilities that should be ad
dressed at the local level.
Proposition 83
Phis proposition increases all penalties for repeated sex oftenders and child molesters.
It also stops any registered sex offender from living within 2,000 feet of parks and schools. It also
mandates a lifetime Global Positioning System be put on sex offenders that are registered as felons.
In also widens the definition of a sexually violent predator. It also erases the current two-year invol
untary civil commitment for a sexual predator to a commitment that is subject to an annual review
by the Director of Mental Health. They then have the ability to petition in court that the sexually vi
olent predator either have a conditional release or an unconditional discharge.
PRO — It will keep our children safe by making prison sentences for child molesters longer. This
will keep them away from public areas, especially public parks and schools. It will almost make sure
their movements are monitored once they are released. It will almost lower the amount of sexual as
saults and rape cases which right now occurs once every two minutes.
CON — This proposition would cost tax payers about five hundred million dollars and would ac
tually not increase child safety. This is because repeated sex offenders usually target people in their
own homes and these children would still be at risk even if this law is enacted. It would also waste re
sources on many sex offenders who don't pose a serious risk.
Proposition 84
This proposition helps to fund projects relating to drinking water, supply and quality and any type
of Hood control. It also protects waterways and natural resources. It decreases water pollution and
helps enable more contamination control in state and local parks. These improvements will allow
public access to natural resource and help water conservation efforts. The proposition provides fund
ing for emergency drinking water and prohibits these costs from being part of public contracts. It will
also ensure immediate action for public safety. Lastly, it authorizes $5,388,000,000 in general obliga
tion bonds to help fund projects which will be repaid from the state's General Fund.
PRO —The measure will help protect California's water, land and coastline. It will also enable
more safe water supplies to be built around this state. This will attract more tourism and help to keep
our economy on a steady incline.
CON — These dollars will not actually be used to help our water supplies and coastlines but will
be swallowed bv bureaucracy.
Proposition 85
This proposition amends the state to prohibit abortion for minors until 48 hours after
a physician has notified the minor's parent or guardian, except in medical emergency or with a parental
waiver. It mandates reporting requirements and authorizes monetary damages against physicians tor
violation. Fiscal impact: Potential unknown net state costs of several million dollars annually for health
and social services programs, court administration, and state health agency administration combined.
I'RO — Right now anyone can arrange a secret abortion for your minor daughter and you won t
even know. Don't permit your young daughter to be subjected to dangerous medical procedures
without your knowledge. Keep her life and health in your hands and not those of strangers.
CON — No law can mandate family communication. Vulnerable teenagers from abusive, violent
homes can't talk to their parents, can't navigate overcrowded courts and may resort to dangerous, il
legal abortions. Prop. 85 won't stop predators, won't protect teens and is the first step in overturning
Roe and banning all abortions.
Proposition 86
By imposing an additional $2.60 per pack excise tax on cigarettes and indirectly increasing taxes
on other tobacco products, the proposition would provide funding for various health programs, chil
dren's health coverage and tobacco-related programs. If passed, it means an increase in excise tax
revenues of about $2.1 billion annually in 2007-08 for the specified purposes outlined above.
I'RO — Reduces smoking and saves lives. A study by the California Department of Health Services
says Proposition 86 will keep 700,(XX) kids from becoming adult smokers and prevent 3(X),000 smoking
related deaths. The same study says Prop 86 will save over $16 billion in health care costs.
CON— Is really about hospitals using our Constitution and laws to pocket millions for them
selves and HMOs through a $2.1 billion tax hike. Section 9 even gives hospitals an exemption to an
titrust laws! It's another lottery mess and has no guarantees on how the money will be spent.
