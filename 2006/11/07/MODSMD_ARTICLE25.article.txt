# Alum Poizner poised to win Insurance job
## 
### CLARA LONG 
Steve Poizner likes fresh challenges. After
stints as a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, high school
teacher and White House fellow, the moderate
Republican and Stanford Graduate School of
Business alumnus has thrown his hat into the po
litical ring as a candidate in a hotly contested race
for insurance commissioner.
The 49-year-old Texan, who is competing with
current Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante to regulate the Si 19 billion insurance
industry, said in an email to The Daily that he
could no longer "sit on the political sidelines" after
leaving the technology industry six years ago.
Poizner founded the Silicon Valley startup
company Snaptrack in 1995, which developed
technology that allows emergency operators to ge
ographically pinpoint calls from cellular phones.
Qualcomm Corp. subsequently purchased the
company in March 2(XX) for $1 billion in stock.
After the sale. Poizner shifted gears. He arrived
in Washington to take up a year-long appointment
as a White House fellow the week before Sept. 11,
2001, where he worked under Richard Clarke,
then the president's special advisor on cyber secu
rity. Returning to California, he taught American
government to 12th grade students at the Mount
Pleasant High School in San Jose, earning the
"Rookie Teacher of the Year Award."
"At a certain point you make enough so that
you never have to worry about money again," said
Auren Hoffmanm, 32, chief executive of startup
Rap Leaf and a supporter. "You can concentrate
on other things that you value."
Buoyed by his personal fortune, Poizner first
ran unsuccessfully in 2(KW for state Assembly. He
co-chaired the failed 2(X)5 Proposition 77 redis
ricting effort, which would have handed redis
tricting power from the legislature to retired
judges. He spent $7 million of his own money on
the two failed campaigns.
"I knew I was on the right track when my major
opposition was both Republican and Democrat
party bosses," he said in a recent debate, reflecting
on the losing Proposition 77 campaign.
Bustamante and Poizner agreed at an Oct. 10
debate that the insurance commissioner, who pro
tects insurance consumers from fraud, plays an es
sential role in decreasing insurance costs for Cali
fornia businesses and families. Both agreed that
auto insurance rates should be more reflective of
consumers' driving records than where they live.
Ensuring health and disaster coverage for Califor
nians should also be a priority, they said.
Bustamante promised to continue the work of
current insurance commissioner and Democratic
candidate for It. governor, John Garamendi. to ad
dress insurance gaps with "a national disaster pro
gram for the entire nation." Poizner said he would
look first to redesigning disaster insurance prod
ucts offered within the state so that they would be
more accessible to consumers.
According to a recent industry report by the in
surance research firm A. M. Best, prohibitively
high premiums account for low rates of earth
quake insurance coverage in seismically active
areas like California, where only 12 percent of res
idential packages include earthquake coverage.
The Republican candidate has garnered a long
list of traditionally Democratic endorsements in
the so-called down-ticket race, including con
