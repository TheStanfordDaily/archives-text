# Water bond: largest in decade
## 
### CLARA LONG 
Voters wading through this year's flood of
ballot initiatives may not be surprised to see yet
another bond measure with the word "water" in
the title. If approved. Proposition 84 — the
Clean Water. Parks and Coastal Protection ini
tiative — would be the sixth resource bond en
dorsed by voters in the last decade.
The $5.4 billion bond sale would provide
funds to protect water quality, preserve coast
line, improve state parks and acquire public land
for conservation. The Legislative Analyst's Of
fice estimates the total cost of the measure to be
about $10.5 billion over 30 years.
"Proposition 84 is endorsed by more organi
zations and community and business leaders
than any other measure on the ballot," said Julie
Benson, spokesperson for the Nature Conser
vancy. Over 450 institutional and individual sup
porters from across the political spectrum are
listed on the Yes on 84 campaign website.
But at least one critic is concerned with the
fiscal priorities bond debts impose on the budget
process.
"I don't think we need to go into debt," said
Bill Leonard of the Board of Equalization. "We
have the money to pay for these projects in a pay
as you go basis." Proposition 84 would cost the
state about $350 million a year of debt payments.
Five resource bond measures in the last
decade authorized $11.1 billion in bond sales —
of which a $953 million balance remains — for
water quality and management as well as natural
resource conservation through land acquisition.
"There seems to be kind of a shift out of the
general fund to more bond issues," said Tracy
Billington, chief of the special projects section of
the state's Department of Water Resources.
"There were smaller initiatives and they have
been getting larger."

Billington's office uses money from Proposi
tion 50, a 2002 resource bond measure, to dis
pense grants to local water agencies for water
quality and supply activities. She said since the
program started last year, local water agencies
have requested about $1.4 billion for these pro
jects from a fund of only $150 million.
" There is just an immense need for water
quality projects," she said.
Funds earmarked for water projects make up
roughly half of Proposition 84's provisions,
while voter-approved bonds in the past decade
sent $3.7 billion towards water quality and man
agement projects. All of the previous bonds
combined funding for water projects with fi
nancing land acquisition for conservation and
recreation.
According to backers, water projects and
land conservation make a happy union.
Though the measure faces no organized op
position, over $9 million in contributions fill
proponents' campaign war chests, according to
campaign finance records. The Nature Conser
vancy, a prominent national environmental non
profit, contributed $3.5 million to the campaign.
Other environmental groups — including the
California Conservation Action Fund, the Na
tional Audubon Society, the California State
Parks Foundation, Save Mount Diablo, the
League for Coastal Protection and the Natural
Resources Defense Council — have each con
tributed over $10,000 in support of the campaign
committees, according to data available on the
campaign finance website Electiontrack.com.
According to critics, groups funding the cam
paign stand to benefit from up to $2 billion of
land acquisition grants provided for in the initia
tive. Because proceeds from the bond fund for
specific agencies, "various environmental


Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (left) and state Treasurer Phil Angelides (right) rally supporters in last-minute campaigning Monday. The governor is expected to easily secure reelection
groups will directly get state tax
payer money," said Board of
Equalization member Bill
Leonard.
The line print of the measure
earmarks various amounts of
money directly to environmental
agencies. But, as proponents point
out. these agencies are all public.
For example, it would provide $54
million to the state-run Sierra

Nevada Conservancy for various
forest conservation projects.
In the area of land conservation,
however, public and private agen
cies often work together to transfer
land into the public domain. Au
drey Rust, executive director of the
non-profit Palo Alto-based Penin
sula Open Space Trust (POST),
said her group helps state agencies
by acquiring land quickly and hold
ing it until it can be purchased with
government money-
Rust, who is on the executive com
mittee of the Yes on 84 campaign, said
her group provides private sector effi
ciency to the process of conservation

land acquisition by making deals
quickly and securing land.
The public process does not
"work very well if you are going to
compete in the marketplace" for
land, said Rust. Once POST, which
has contributed over $600,000 to
the Proposition S4 campaign, puts a
hold on land, "we look to various
agencies to participate," she said.
For POST, that may be the mid-
Peninsula Open Regional Open
Space District, the Department of
Parks and Recreation or even the
National Park funds. Proposition
84 would provide funds for public
agencies that POST works with.

For example, the Department of
Parks and Recreation would re
ceive $400 million for purchases of
state and local park land through
the measure.
POST is currently in negotia
tions for a set of purchases that
would preserve a stretch of land
through the Santa Cruz mountains
to the sea, with chunks in Santa
Clara, Santa Cruz and San Mateo
Counties. Because of the sensitivity
of negotiations, she declined to
state other details.
"Everyone who goes to Stanford
hikes and bike rides these hills,"
Rust said. "They couldn't do it

without these funds."
Baekers of Proposition 84. who
only started advertising in October,
are hoping to overcome what ap
pears to be lukewarm support. A
late October Field Poll found that
51 percent of voters tend to support
Proposition 84. with 31 percent op
posed and 18 percent undecided. A
Public Policy institute poll released
last week reported that only 42 per
cent of voters said they would vote
yes on the measure, with 43 percent
in opposition. Five other bond
measures, proposing another $37
billion in bond sales, accompany
the initiative on the ballot.
