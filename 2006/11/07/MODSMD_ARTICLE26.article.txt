# Water bond: largest in decade
## 
### CLARA LONG 
Voters wading through this year's flood of
ballot initiatives may not be surprised to see yet
another bond measure with the word "water" in
the title. If approved. Proposition 84 — the
Clean Water. Parks and Coastal Protection ini
tiative — would be the sixth resource bond en
dorsed by voters in the last decade.
The $5.4 billion bond sale would provide
funds to protect water quality, preserve coast
line, improve state parks and acquire public land
for conservation. The Legislative Analyst's Of
fice estimates the total cost of the measure to be
about $10.5 billion over 30 years.
"Proposition 84 is endorsed by more organi
zations and community and business leaders
than any other measure on the ballot," said Julie
Benson, spokesperson for the Nature Conser
vancy. Over 450 institutional and individual sup
porters from across the political spectrum are
listed on the Yes on 84 campaign website.
But at least one critic is concerned with the
fiscal priorities bond debts impose on the budget
process.
"I don't think we need to go into debt," said
Bill Leonard of the Board of Equalization. "We
have the money to pay for these projects in a pay
as you go basis." Proposition 84 would cost the
state about $350 million a year of debt payments.
Five resource bond measures in the last
decade authorized $11.1 billion in bond sales —
of which a $953 million balance remains — for
water quality and management as well as natural
resource conservation through land acquisition.
"There seems to be kind of a shift out of the
general fund to more bond issues," said Tracy
Billington, chief of the special projects section of
the state's Department of Water Resources.
"There were smaller initiatives and they have
been getting larger."

Billington's office uses money from Proposi
tion 50, a 2002 resource bond measure, to dis
pense grants to local water agencies for water
quality and supply activities. She said since the
program started last year, local water agencies
have requested about $1.4 billion for these pro
jects from a fund of only $150 million.
" There is just an immense need for water
quality projects," she said.
Funds earmarked for water projects make up
roughly half of Proposition 84's provisions,
while voter-approved bonds in the past decade
sent $3.7 billion towards water quality and man
agement projects. All of the previous bonds
combined funding for water projects with fi
nancing land acquisition for conservation and
recreation.
According to backers, water projects and
land conservation make a happy union.
Though the measure faces no organized op
position, over $9 million in contributions fill
proponents' campaign war chests, according to
campaign finance records. The Nature Conser
vancy, a prominent national environmental non
profit, contributed $3.5 million to the campaign.
Other environmental groups — including the
California Conservation Action Fund, the Na
tional Audubon Society, the California State
Parks Foundation, Save Mount Diablo, the
League for Coastal Protection and the Natural
Resources Defense Council — have each con
tributed over $10,000 in support of the campaign
committees, according to data available on the
campaign finance website Electiontrack.com.
According to critics, groups funding the cam
paign stand to benefit from up to $2 billion of
land acquisition grants provided for in the initia
tive. Because proceeds from the bond fund for
specific agencies, "various environmental
