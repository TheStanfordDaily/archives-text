### JULIET WILLIAMS ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LOS ANGELES â€” California's top
Democrats spent the waning hours before
Tuesday's election trying to boost voter
turnout amid fears that their weak guberna
torial candidate, Phil Angelides, could be a
drag on the ticket, even as Democrats are
expected to surge nationwide.
While campaigning with Angelides at ral
lies around the state Monday, top Democ
rats sought to link their Republican oppo
nents to extremist views and to remind vot
ers of their frustration with the Bush admin
istration. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has
successfully distanced himself from falter
ing Republicans this campaign season
through a series of bipartisan agreements
and centrist policies.
At a spirited rally at Los Angeles City
College, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Tues
day's election is about much more than who
controls California. She told around 200
students that their vole will send a message
to the White House about its policies on the
Iraq war, minimum wage, health care, edu
cation and stem cell research.
"1 remember the day when the Unit
ed States of America was the most ad
mired country in the world. Does any
one believe that's true today?" Feinstein
said to loud cheers of "No." "That's the
message this election sends, and there s

only one way to send it.... And that's by
voting for Democrats up and down the
slate."
Feinstein named more than half a dozen
candidates who were also on stage, some of
them in unexpectedly tight races: secretary
of state candidate Debra Bowen, state con
troller candidate John Chiang and Insur
ance Commissioner John Garamendi. who
is locked in a close race for lieutenant gov
ernor against Republican state Sen. Tom
McClintock.
Garamendi's campaign later announced
a one-minute ad by a Democratic-leaning
group. Majority Action, that was to run dur
ing prime time Monday in the Los Angeles
area, highlighting McClintock's opposition
to embryonic stem cell research. The group
also has run stem cell ads in congressional
districts in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana
and New York.
Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger on Monday
visited a GOP phone bank operation in
Irvine, where volunteers were urging Re
publican voters to vote yes on Proposition
85, which would require parents to be noti
ced when teenagers seek abortions.
I'he issue appeals to the Republican base,
although Schwarzenegger has not empha
sized it in his campaign for fear of alienating
moderates. When the governor got on the
phone, he ignored the abortion measure
and spoke instead about the five infrastruc
ture bonds on Tuesday's ballot.
