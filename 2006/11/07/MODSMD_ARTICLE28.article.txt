# More monitoring for offenders
## 
### JENNA COLLEY 
If supporters of Proposition 83 prove victorious
on Nov. 7, California will join a growing list of
states now able to track convicted sex-offenders
with Global Positioning Systems (GPS).
Massachusetts, Ohio, Oklahoma, lowa, Mis
souri and Washington have all recently imple
mented tracking programs despite a lack of empir
ical evidence supporting the effectiveness ol such
measures. Around 30 states now have GPS laws on
the books, with Florida leading the charge. The
southern state began tracking sex offenders with
GPS devices in 1997.
David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes
Against Children Research Center at the Univer
sity of New Hampshire, attributes the recent rise in
tracking laws to "social policy contagion. Sex of
fender legislation plays well with voters, said
Finkelhor.
"I'm not a fan of what's going on," said Finkel
hor. "I feel like it's been rather slapdash social pol
icy without any real attempt to [determine] what is
needed and what works.'
Supporters of GPS laws argue that the tracking
systems discourage repeat offenders. But despite
their increasing popularity, the GPS tracking laws
aren't popular among all victims' advocacy groups.
Finkelhor said there is no connection between a
rise in sex crimes against children and the upsurge
in GPS legislation.
In fact, sex crimes against children have de
clined in recent years despite misperceptions cre
ated by high-profile cases like those of Jessica
Lunsford — a nine-year-old Florida girl who was
raped and murdered by a sex olfender who had
served 10 years in prison before being paroled in
1980.
If passed. Proposition 83 would allow lawmak
ers to impose GPS tracking devices on the state's
90,000 registered sex offenders, a move that could
cost multi-millions, estimates the ( alifornia secre

tary of state.
California convicts about B,(XX) people of felony
sex offenses annually. When released, they could
also be subjected to the GPS devices — which can
cost up to $10 a day. Excluding the costs associat
ed with higher personnel to maintain the system,
rental of the GPS systems alone could cost up to
$29 million annually.
California already tracks some sex offenders.
U.C.-lrvine's Center for Corrections-Based Evi
dence currently evaluates the effectiveness of the
plan, which put GPS tracking devices on "High
Risk Sex Offenders" in San Diego County last
year, according to UCI.
Political opponents of the initiative question
the plan's financial feasibility. "It's just not good
public policy," said Mark Leno (D-San Francisco)
chairman of the Public Safety Committee for the
California State Assembly, which heard testimony
on the GPS plan last year. "When you ask the gov
ernor — who is the sponsor of this [Prop. 83] —
how he's going to pay for it when the state is al
ready $6 billion in debt, he just says, 'You can't put
a price tag on the safety of children,'" Leno said.
While the data supporting the effectiveness of
GPS tracking on deterring recidivism may prove il
lusive, proponents of the GPS system say the ben
efits associated with catching repeaters speak for
themselves.
Last year, Massachusetts lawmakers imple
mented GPS tracking for high-risk sex offenders.
"It can work really well," said Diane Rosenleld,
a Harvard Law School lecturer who has worked
with Massachusetts legislators in implementing
GPS measures. "If sex offenders breach their zone,
they are automatically reported to probation."
While California may be the latest U.S. state to
join the push, the trend doesn't stop stateside. Ear
lier this month the Correction Service of Canada
announced plans to launch a pilot project imple
menting GPS tracking for high-risk offenders
throughout the country by year's end.
