# Cities plan for Prop 90 restrictions
## 
### TED BOSCIA 
Pass or fail come Election Day, the legacy of
Proposition 90 might just be that it greased the
wheels of sluggish municipal governments
throughout California.
In towns like Palo Alto and Seal Beach,
local officials have accelerated the approval of
zoning ordinances this month to ensure that
new laws are on the books prior to Nov. 7. Sim
ilarly. lawmakers in larger cities like Oakland
and Berkeley have sought to ram through
housing ordinances as Proposition 90 looms on
the state ballot.
This flurry of llth-hour lawmaking has
been triggered by fears among city planners
that the passage of Prop. 90 would rob them of
the power to set local land use policies. The
measure, which would limit the use of eminent
domain to public projects, also contains provi
sions that would require government to reim
burse property owners for "substantial eco
nomic losses" that result from new laws. It
would exempt, however, laws that deal with
public health and safety and would not apply to
existing ordinances.
"If Prop. 90 passes, there's some question
about what we'll be able to accomplish," said
Palo Alto Planning Director Steve Emslie.
" That's part of the reason why we're trying to
get some of these changes through now."
In most instances, city officials have not
adopted these new laws solely as a reaction to
the initiative. But they have been compelled to
speed through any proposed regulations that
could require them to compensate property
owners under Prop. 90.
The Palo Alto City Council, for instance,
unanimously approved a so-called urgency or
dinance on Oct. 16 that immediately placed re
strictions on condominiums in certain residen
tial areas of the city. At issue was a mundane
dispute that arose between two landowners
about a loophole in the municipal code that al
lowed homeowners, in effect, to convert sec
ondary housing units into condos. Fearing that
such an amendment could be costly under
Prop. 90, the council took the unusual action to
pass an urgency ordinance, which it will have to
revisit within 45 days.
"This is a case where [under Prop. 90] the
city could have been sued by property owners
for devaluing private property," Emslie said.
In Seal Beach — a small beachfront town
nestled in the westernmost corner of Orange
County — lawmakers took a similar approach
when they were discussing limits on building
heights in their downtown district earlier this
month. In an effort to preserve this communi
ty's charm, the council had been deliberating
for months about an ordinance to disallow
buildings more than two stories tall.
But once local officials learned about Prop.
90, they decided to act swiftly rather than let a
vote on the height limitations linger past Elec
tion Day.
"Planning for this ordinance started way be
fore anybody had dealt with Proposition 90
and its possible implications," said Charles
Antos, a Seal Beach councilman. "We started
out with the usual planning sessions and hear
ings, and it dragged on for months. Once the
analysis started to come in on Proposition 90,
though, we felt that it was prudent to speed it
up in order to get our ordinance passed right
away."
As in Palo Alto, the new Seal Beach ordi
nance must be reexamined after the election.
In the Bay Area, city officials in Oakland
and Berkeley also worry that Prop. 90 could

diminish their control over land use decisions.
The Oakland City Council is currently at an
impasse over a planned "inclusionary zoning
ordinance that would shore up the city's pool
of low- and moderate-income housing. As it
stands, the measure's fate lies in the hands of
Mayor Jerry Brown, who must break the tie at
the council's next meeting on Oct. 31.
Oakland lawmakers in support of the mea
sure are pushing to win its immediate ap
proval, but a substitute plan to submit the
proposal to further review has the council
locked in a 4-4 vote. Its supporters say that
tabling the ordinance until after the election
could endanger it if Prop. 90 passes.
On the other hand, the Berkeley City

Council agreed on Oct. 24 to a measure that is
aimed at boosting the city's affordable hous
ing, but the new law will stand only if Prop. 90
passes. If it doesn't, the council's ordinance
will expire on Nov. 8.
Emslie, the Palo Alto planner, isn't sur
prised by municipal attempts to guard against
the initiative.
"We're not the only ones worried about
Prop. 90," he said. "Anyone else at the city
level will tell you the same thing."
Their fears are not unfounded. An August
Field poll showed the measure with a healthy
lead among likely voters, with 46 percent in
favor and 31 percent opposed. Still, 23 per
cent of voters were undecided.

pass an urgency ordinance, which it will have to
revisit within 45 days.
"This is a case where [under Prop. 90] the
city could have been sued by property owners
for devaluing private property," Emslie said.
In Seal Beach — a small beachfront town
nestled in the westernmost corner of Orange
County — lawmakers took a similar approach
when they were discussing limits on building
heights in their downtown district earlier this
month. In an effort to preserve this communi
ty's charm, the council had been deliberating
for months about an ordinance to disallow
buildings more than two stories tall.
But once local officials learned about Prop.
90, they decided to act swiftly rather than let a
vote on the height limitations linger past Elec
tion Day.
"Planning for this ordinance started way be
fore anybody had dealt with Proposition 90
and its possible implications," said Charles
Antos, a Seal Beach councilman. "We started
out with the usual planning sessions and hear
ings, and it dragged on for months. Once the
analysis started to come in on Proposition 90,
though, we felt that it was prudent to speed it
up in order to get our ordinance passed right
away."
As in Palo Alto, the new Seal Beach ordi
nance must be reexamined after the election.
In the Bay Area, city officials in Oakland
and Berkeley also worry that Prop. 90 could

diminish their control over land use decisions.
The Oakland City Council is currently at an
impasse over a planned "inclusionary zoning
ordinance that would shore up the city's pool
of low- and moderate-income housing. As it
stands, the measure's fate lies in the hands of
Mayor Jerry Brown, who must break the tie at
the council's next meeting on Oct. 31.
Oakland lawmakers in support of the mea
sure are pushing to win its immediate ap
proval, but a substitute plan to submit the
proposal to further review has the council
locked in a 4-4 vote. Its supporters say that
tabling the ordinance until after the election
could endanger it if Prop. 90 passes.
On the other hand, the Berkeley City

Council agreed on Oct. 24 to a measure that is
aimed at boosting the city's affordable hous
ing, but the new law will stand only if Prop. 90
passes. If it doesn't, the council's ordinance
will expire on Nov. 8.
Emslie, the Palo Alto planner, isn't sur
prised by municipal attempts to guard against
the initiative.
"We're not the only ones worried about
Prop. 90," he said. "Anyone else at the city
level will tell you the same thing."
Their fears are not unfounded. An August
Field poll showed the measure with a healthy
lead among likely voters, with 46 percent in
favor and 31 percent opposed. Still, 23 per
cent of voters were undecided.
