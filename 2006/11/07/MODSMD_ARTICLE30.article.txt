JL hroughout the past week, The Daily's Editorial Board
took a stance on five of the propositions on this year's ballot,
as well as on the gubernatorial election. Because we couldn't
cover every measure in the election, we attempted to focus on
those we felt to be most controversial and relevant to the stu
dent body. While we hope that we covered each issue in depth,
explaining what's at stake and giving counterarguments to our
position, we realize that many of the propositions in question
are far more complicated than can be summarized in 600
words. We urge readers to examine each issue further before
coming to a decision. But we hope that the following editori
als are a helpful starting point and that readers will consider
the arguments presented in each.

NO on Prop. 85
Voting no for Prop 85 will not make abortion
illegal in the state of California. But it will effec
tively eliminate the option of an abortion for
many who desperately seek one. Instead of ob
taining an abortion performed by a medical pro
fessional. pregnant teens may risk dangerous
procedures rather than risk having their parents
notified.
If the intent of Prop 85 is to create a deterrent
for errant teenagers, consider that many
teenagers with unwanted pregnancies probably
YES on Prop. 87
Prop 87 has set an ambitious goal to reduce
the use of petroleum in California by 25 percent
within 10 years. Of the $4 billion in revenues
generated by the proposed tax, 26.75 percent
will be reserved for grants to California univer
sities to improve economic viability and acceler
ate the commercialization of renewable-energy
and energy-efficient technologies. Such grants
will help spur the technological innovations and
breakthroughs required for a wide-scale adop
tion of alternative energy.
The measure also offers incentives for con
sumers and state and local governments to buy
alternative-energy vehicles — including flex

did not consider the consequences of their ac
tions until it was too late. It is unlikely that Prop
85 would seriously impact the decision-making
process of teens. If it creates any dread or re
morse. it will only do so after the fact, when the
damage has already been done.
The reality is that Prop 85 will inordinately af
fect teenagers who are vulnerable and disadvan
taged. Some of us may be particularly sympa
thetic to their plight, while others may condemn
their decision as irresponsible and chalk it up to
weak moral fiber or unfortunate social condi
tions. Whatever the case, we cannot help but re
alize that the proposition will affect the individu
als who can least afford to bear its consequences.
fuel, hybrid and electric cars — that emit less
pollution; $6(X) million of the revenues generat
ed by the tax will be used to replace pre-1987
diesel school buses.
A serious concern held by many voters is that
the proposition would result in an increase in
California's gas prices, which are already among
the nation's highest. However, the California
State Attorney General has confirmed that
Prop 87 makes it illegal for oil companies to pass
new costs onto consumers by raising gas prices.
The Board feels that cost concerns are out
weighed by the overwhelmingly positive conse
quences that can be expected from Prop 87. By
injecting $4 billion into alternative energy re
search, California can lead the nation and the
world in the effort to reclaim a clean and healthy
atmosphere.

YES on Prop. 86
Smoking, which will kill an estimated one
billion people in the next century if current
trends hold, is still the leading cause of pre
ventable disease and death in the United States.
Studies have shown that raising the price of
cigarettes is both the best way to keep them out of
the hands of minors and an effective incentive for
adults to quit. According to projections, the tax
would reduce cigarette consumption by more
than a quarter. The end result? An estimated
700,000 kids wouldn't become adult smokers,
hundreds of thousands of premature deaths
would be prevented and the state would save
some $16.5 billion in health care costs over the
long run.
NO on Prop. 89
Imposition 89 would not provide a "clean
money" reform to campaigns. If the proposi
tion passes, legal battles and attempts by donors
to find holes in the regulations will begin, and
even if it worked as planned, it would not make
a worthwhile difference.
Recent years have already seen a swing to
ward independently wealthy candidates who fi
nance their own campaigns, and the proposi
tion is only likely to increase that likelihood. It
promises to give equal funding if all candidates
accept the public financing and give up to four
times this amount if one candidate is running
against another who is privately financed. But if
YES on Prop. 83
In 2001, lowa passed a residence restriction
similar to that in Prop. 83, but the prosecutors
who once advocated it have recently reversed
their position, citing the expense and overall in
effectiveness of the regulations. It has caused un
intended consequences, such as pushing sex of
fenders to rural areas which are less equipped to
monitor and police them, as well as leading some
sex offenders to not register and instead go "un
derground."
The Stanford Center on Criminal Justice
conducted a report when the law was proposed
in the legislature earlier this year, estimating
that large sections of cities like Los Angeles,

Health care costs would decline partly be
cause taxpayers would pay considerably less for
medical costs due to smoking and partly be
cause the estimated $2.27 billion dollars of rev
enue generated by the proposed tax would go
toward improving California's health care sys
tem: health insurance for needy children, emer
gency services for the uninsured, nursing edu
cation. tobacco prevention programs and dis
ease research.
While spending mandates may indeed ex
ceed revenues and the pilot costs of new pro
grams could prove steep, the state can potential
ly save billions from reduced health care costs
over the long run because smoking-related
health problems will presumably decrease. It is
difficult to see whether the state will come out
ahead, but the overwhelming positive health
consequences make Prop 86 a risk worth taking.
the privately wealthy opponent keeps spend
ing, the candidate who took public money is
capped, and cannot spend more — effectively
ruining his or her ability to compete. Even
worse, candidates who choose private funding
can still receive contributions from parties, in
terest groups and PACs, just in smaller
amounts, meaning lots of small groups will form
without much overall change in cash flow.
Another issue is charging businesses and fi
nancial institutions with the tax for the funding.
Placing the entire burden in these areas is help
ful in garnering the type of mass public support
a referendum needs, but it is still unfair.
The system of campaign finance in the U.S.
clearly needs help, but Proposition 89 is simply
not going to work. There are too many ways to
get around it, and it may be unconstitutional.
San Diego and San Francisco would be off lim
its to sex offenders with a 2000 foot ban. It is lit
tle wonder, then, why so many cities have
signed off on the referendum: they can ship
their sex offenders off for someone else to
worry about, and state funding will then have to
pick up the tab.
It is always difficult to argue against better
protection of children. Nobody wants to be la
beled as on the side of sex offenders. However,
it is significant that the same law was proposed
multiple times in the state legislature and never
even made it out of committee hearings, let
alone to a full vote on the floor. The "Yes on 83"
campaign claims this is due to ultra-liberals with
extreme views, but it is more likely that veteran
lawmakers (even in California) know a mess
when they see it.
