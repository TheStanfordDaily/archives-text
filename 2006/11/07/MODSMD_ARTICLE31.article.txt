# Schwarzenegger for Governor
## 
### 
Many progressive Stanford students would argue that no ineumbent Republiean at any level of
government deserves to keep his or her office this year. This is a valid argument for many races
around the country, but not when it comes to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. I Jnlike
our national leaders, the governor has generally been respectful of the voice of the people, and his
conservative appeal presents a real opportunity to break the divisive stalemate on crucial issues like
education policies and global warming. Over the past year, he has demonstrated a willingness to
compromise that seems to be more than just a gimmick. He deserves another term as governor.
Since the humbling defeat of his special election propositions in 2005, the governor has begun to
admit his mistakes in other areas, and he has been working well with Democratic legislators. His ap
pointment of Democrat Susan Kennedy as his chief of staff was a masterstroke that led to a more
balanced focus on the issues.
For his part, Schwarzenegger needs to know that more will be expected from him this time
around. If he regresses back into "girlie men" talk or hides inside an economic cocoon, he will find
his recent advances disappear like so many tracks in the sand. He needs to be a true independent,
even if he there is still an "R" next to his name.
