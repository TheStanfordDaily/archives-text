M ore money has been spent this elec
tion than in any prior midterm in American
history. The Center for Responsive Politics
estimates that $2.8 billion will be spent this
year. The money primarily comes from big
corporate interests, but smaller gifts can
make the difference in tight races. The
Daily reviewed Federal Election Commis
sion records of contributions greater than
$200 made during this election cycle. Some
prominent University faculty have donated
large sums to favored causes or candidates.
The gifts tend to be for more liberal, tradi
tionally Democratic causes.

M ore money has been spent this elec
tion than in any prior midterm in American
history. The Center for Responsive Politics
estimates that $2.8 billion will be spent this
year. The money primarily comes from big
corporate interests, but smaller gifts can
make the difference in tight races. The
Daily reviewed Federal Election Commis
sion records of contributions greater than
$200 made during this election cycle. Some
prominent University faculty have donated
large sums to favored causes or candidates.
The gifts tend to be for more liberal, tradi
tionally Democratic causes.
