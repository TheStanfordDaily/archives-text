### JENNIFER LOVEN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PENSACX )LA. Fla. — The closer
the election came to the finish line, the
more President Bush's aides battled
the perception he was doing his party
as much harm as good and was un
wanted in many races.
On Monday. Bush jetted to a con
servative corner of Florida's Panhan
dle, about as far as he could get from
the state's three in-play House dis
tricts. To the White House's embar
rassment and irritation. Republican
('harlie Crist, whom Bush came to help
in his bid to succeed the president's

brother as governor, decided at the last
minute to skip the chance to he by the
president's side.
In a speech bracketed by raucous
foot-stomping to country music and an
explosion of metallic red-white-and
blue confetti. Hush won cheers for ap
plauding Saddam Hussein's convic
tion. lambasting Democrats on the war
on terror and accusing the opposition
party of plotting to raise taxes.
"The Democrats' philosophy is this:
If it breathes, tax it. And if it stops
breathing, find their children and tax
them," Bush shouted.
Next up was Arkansas, where Re
nnhliran Asa Hntrhinsnn remained

well behind in his race to keep the gov
ernor's mansion in Republican hands.
Bush kept upbeat, talking of a party
"roarin' into Election Day."
Finally, he wrapped up the last cam
paign of his political career Monday
night in Texas. It was somewhat of a
sentimental stop, taking him to his
home state, where he is more popular
than he is in many other regions.
It was still remarkable that, with so
many Republicans around the country
facing too-close-to-call races and with
GOP majorities in the House. Senate
and the nation's statehouses in jeop
ardy. Bush decided to spend capital on
HOP Gov Rirk Pprrv whn harHlv

needed the president's assistance to get
re-elected.
"It's been a tradition in our family
that we always end up the last stop in
Texas, and there's a reason why," said
Bush, wrapped in the adoration of
about 1(),(XX) supporters at the aptly
named Reunion Arena.
He wasn't welcomed by all. "Worst
President Ever," said one of the ban
ners held by protesters outside.
White House press secretary Tony
Snow said Bush's travels on Monday to
races more on the periphery of this
high-stakes midterm campaign were
nothing more than honoring "long
stawlino nrnniisps" tn Florida f?nv

Jeb Bush (his brother), Hutchinson (a
former top Bush administration offi
cial) and Perry (the president's succes
sor in Texas).
But Bush's final five-day sprint to
Election Day took on little of the ur
gency of the last days before the 2002
midterm election, or certainly the close
of his own re-election race two years
ago.
He's been starting later in the day
and finishing by bedtime, with just one
stop on Saturday and two on Sunday
— all in smaller, very GOP-friendly
areas. For the campaign's final three
nights, he even slept in his own bed in
CrawfnrH Tevas
