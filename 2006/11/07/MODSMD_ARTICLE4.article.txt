## Stanford shoots for the moon Alumni initiative funds lunar research, eyes eventual manned missions 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If a group of alumni and faculty have their way,
the next overseas studies destination for under
graduates could be the moon.
At a conference held in early October, more
than 1(X) alumni, faculty and administrators gath
ered to discuss Stanford's future role in lunar explo
ration. Ibe conference was hosted by Stanford on
the Moon, an alumni initiative founded by mem
bers of the class of 1965, and was the latest event in
the group's five-year campaign to increase Stan
ford's lunar presence.
"The goal is to show that the Stanford communi
ty is again a world leader in innovation," said Engi
neering Prof. Bob Twiggs, a member of Stanford on
the Moon. "We believe it to be a worthwhile, achiev
able goal with the expertise we have within Stan
ford."
Initiated by alum Steve Durst at his reunion
homecoming in 2(XX), the project has expanded in
recent years to include administrators, students and
faculty from a number of departments. Durst, who
now edits and publishes the Palo Alto-based news
service Space Age Publishing, said he hopes to use
Stanford's scientific strengths to participate in glob
al lunar talks.
"Stanford has always had an outstanding record
of graduates who become astronauts," Durst said.
"But outside a select group of individuals, it hasn't
had a very strong interest in the moon. In general.
