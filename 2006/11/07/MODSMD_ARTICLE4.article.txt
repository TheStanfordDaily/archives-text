## Stanford shoots for the moon Alumni initiative funds lunar research, eyes eventual manned missions 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If a group of alumni and faculty have their way,
the next overseas studies destination for under
graduates could be the moon.
At a conference held in early October, more
than 1(X) alumni, faculty and administrators gath
ered to discuss Stanford's future role in lunar explo
ration. Ibe conference was hosted by Stanford on
the Moon, an alumni initiative founded by mem
bers of the class of 1965, and was the latest event in
the group's five-year campaign to increase Stan
ford's lunar presence.
"The goal is to show that the Stanford communi
ty is again a world leader in innovation," said Engi
neering Prof. Bob Twiggs, a member of Stanford on
the Moon. "We believe it to be a worthwhile, achiev
able goal with the expertise we have within Stan
ford."
Initiated by alum Steve Durst at his reunion
homecoming in 2(XX), the project has expanded in
recent years to include administrators, students and
faculty from a number of departments. Durst, who
now edits and publishes the Palo Alto-based news
service Space Age Publishing, said he hopes to use
Stanford's scientific strengths to participate in glob
al lunar talks.
"Stanford has always had an outstanding record
of graduates who become astronauts," Durst said.
"But outside a select group of individuals, it hasn't
had a very strong interest in the moon. In general.

lunar interest from the engineering
departments has been consistent
with the national attitude. But the
moon is now rising in a lot of dimen
sions, and we'll see whether Stanford
will rise to that challenge."
Durst said he believed that con
tinued work with the Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP) could re
sult in an eventual campus on the
moon.
"We are continuing to build con
nections with BOSP and much of it
right now is just departmental
progress," Durst said. "But in time
why not a Stanford program on the
moon? 'ITiat's a big vision, but if we
work at it. it's possible."
But don't bank on a Bing trip to
Mars just yet. While undergraduate
space travel may be some years off,
Stanford on the Moon is also working
on more immediately feasible ideas
like lunar orbitals, robotic experi
ments and geology research. Engi
neering Prof. Bruce Lusignan said he
believed that lunar exploration could
lead to more extensive space studies.
" Ilie moon is an important site to
improve radio observation," Lusig
nan said. "There is also geologic evi
dence of the formation of the solar
system. By extension of cooperation,
the exploration of Mars could take
place."
One specific plan is the Stanford
Lunar Analysis Mission (SLAM), an
initiative to place small 10-centime
ter-long satellites, known as Cube-
Sats, into orbit around the moon.
"We would actually like to do a
lunar flyby by 2010." said Twiggs,
who developed SLAM. "These
CubeSats would be launched by a
carrier as it nears the moon to have
them get a gravity-assisted swing
around the moon and fly by the
earth, then out into space. We know

of at least four other groups involv
ing universities that have the same
goal i'.nd may beat our 2010 date."
For the last five years, Twiggs has
been working with students on a
satellite program that has successful
ly launched three satellites into
space. Twiggs said he hoped collabo
ration on the satellite projects would
remain confined to the University.
"We hope the funding for the
project can be generated internally
within the Stanford community so it
can be kept a total Stanford project."
Twiggs said. "If we cannot find the
funds within Stanford, then we will
make it a collaborative project with
government, industry and other uni
versity projects."
Stanford on the Moon has also
raised the possibility of manned mis
sions to the moon. ITie U.S., China
and Russia have all recently an
nounced that they plan to send as
tronauts to the moon in the near fu
ture. prompting a surge in lunar in
terest and competition.
L.usignan said that he believed
the international community's focus
on the moon would encourage fur
ther funding for lunar exploration.
"It is clear that the combined
budgets of Europe, Russia, China,
Japan and other nations can support
a manned moon mission without any
increase," Lusignan said. "And from
their announcements, this is clearly
underway, with or without the U.S.
While NASA's budget has been
slashed, there are many private per
sons that will participate even if the
U.S chooses not to."
While only the Engineering De
partment has contributed to the
lunar project so far. Durst said that
he hopes faculty and students from
all disciplines will get involved in the
near future.
"It's time for us to engage new,
broader sections of the University
community in this project." Durst
said. "I was a history major at Stan
ford, and I want to bring the human
ities into this effort."
