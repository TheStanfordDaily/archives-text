## Putnam perplexes the best Difficult problem-solving questions attract dozens of students each week 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
As midterm season comes and goes, many students
are left to contemplate the low scores on their chemistry
and biology midterms. But for a small contingent of Stan
ford, getting just one point out of 120 on a special test this
fall will be cause for celebration.
Each ycar.more than 3.s(H)college students,about 100
Stanford students among them, participate in the William
Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. Test-takers
have six hours to deliberate over 12 problem-solving
questions â€” the average student receiving a grade of less
than one.
Stanford students, however, have tackled this brain
crushing test with surprising success. Last year, Stanford
competitors held 37 of the top 500 scores in the nation,
placing the University among the top three schools in the
nation.
This vear, dozens of students have assumed the chal

lenge again. Every Monday evening, about forty students
of different disciplines meet in the Math Building to dis
cuss difficult problems under the guidance of Assoc.
Math Prof. Ravi Vakil in preparation for the exam, which
will be held on Dec. 2.
"Getting even a single point is a big deal," Vakil said.
"How well students do depends a lot on the day, the par
ticular problems, on the individuals themselves. They're
there right before finals for six hours in the morning."
Stressing creativity and inventiveness as opposed to
specific knowledge, the problems on the Putnam exam
ostensibly require a high school math background to an
swer. Yet, the median for the exam is only one point due
to strict grading and the apparent complexity of the
proofs.
Sophomore Kiat ChuanTan.a double major in electri
cal engineering and math and a silver medalist in the 2(X)1
International Math Olympiad, highlighted the impor
tance of innovativeness.
"Its an intellectually different experience because, for
classes, you're learning material from an established syl
labus," Tan said. "You learn to solve a certain type of
problem and then you take a midterm.That sets Putnam
