## Putnam perplexes the best Difficult problem-solving questions attract dozens of students each week 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
As midterm season comes and goes, many students
are left to contemplate the low scores on their chemistry
and biology midterms. But for a small contingent of Stan
ford, getting just one point out of 120 on a special test this
fall will be cause for celebration.
Each ycar.more than 3.s(H)college students,about 100
Stanford students among them, participate in the William
Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. Test-takers
have six hours to deliberate over 12 problem-solving
questions — the average student receiving a grade of less
than one.
Stanford students, however, have tackled this brain
crushing test with surprising success. Last year, Stanford
competitors held 37 of the top 500 scores in the nation,
placing the University among the top three schools in the
nation.
This vear, dozens of students have assumed the chal

lenge again. Every Monday evening, about forty students
of different disciplines meet in the Math Building to dis
cuss difficult problems under the guidance of Assoc.
Math Prof. Ravi Vakil in preparation for the exam, which
will be held on Dec. 2.
"Getting even a single point is a big deal," Vakil said.
"How well students do depends a lot on the day, the par
ticular problems, on the individuals themselves. They're
there right before finals for six hours in the morning."
Stressing creativity and inventiveness as opposed to
specific knowledge, the problems on the Putnam exam
ostensibly require a high school math background to an
swer. Yet, the median for the exam is only one point due
to strict grading and the apparent complexity of the
proofs.
Sophomore Kiat ChuanTan.a double major in electri
cal engineering and math and a silver medalist in the 2(X)1
International Math Olympiad, highlighted the impor
tance of innovativeness.
"Its an intellectually different experience because, for
classes, you're learning material from an established syl
labus," Tan said. "You learn to solve a certain type of
problem and then you take a midterm.That sets Putnam
apart from regular academic classes,
because you are constantly motivat
ed to he creative in solving the prob
lems."
Past experience, however, is still
important.
"The level of difficulty for each
question is different for everybody,"
he said. "It partly depends on what
people have been exposed to be
fore."
Some freshmen at the Monday
practices said that they felt pressured
about taking the Putnam without
having taken many college-level
math courses.
"I've done AIMH [American In
vitational Mathematics Examina
tion] before in high school, but these
problems are much more difficult."
said freshman Dinah Shender.
Each Monday. Vakil begins the
session by explaining a particular
problem-solving technique. Students
then break up into smaller groups to
tackle one or two problems over the

next hour. Even after the pizza ar
rives halfway through the session,
students typically remain mired in in
tense deliberation over the proofs.
When the problems are finally
diseussed as a group, most students
are eager to describe their individual
solutions and methods. During one
student's presentation of a problem,
another piped up.
"I don't doubt the validity of this
proof," he said."But I wouldn't know
how I 'd write a solution like that dur
ing the Putnam."
Vakil has arranged for Stanford's
participation in the Putnam exam
since he arrived in 2(K)1. Over the last
three years, he has organized the
weekly sessions and the master class
for advanced students as well.
While Vakil recognized that the
students in the sessions were limited
to mostly "techies." he acknowledged
the diversity in the group in terms of
age, race, gender and nationality.
Open to the entire academic commu

nity, the classes periodically entertain
high school and even middle school
students. And international students
hailing from Singapore, Japan and
Turkey also pack into the Math Con
ference Room each Monday.
Vakil said that he did not plan to
end his relationship with the Putnam
exam any time soon, which began
when he scored in the top live in the
nation for four consecutive years as
an undergraduate at the University
of Toronto. Whether as a student or a
professor, Vakil said that he loves it
when students "see problems they
don't know about at all and then
have an amazing idea about how to
tackle it by thinking creatively."
So far, it seems that Vakil is right
on track. When asked why he gives
up his Monday nights for the Put
nam. sophomore John Le was quick
to answer.
"The problems make my brain
light up." he said. "And when 1 solve
a hard problem it just feels so good."

"I've done AIMH [American In
vitational Mathematics Examina
tion] before in high school, but these
problems are much more difficult."
said freshman Dinah Shender.
Each Monday. Vakil begins the
session by explaining a particular
problem-solving technique. Students
then break up into smaller groups to
tackle one or two problems over the

next hour. Even after the pizza ar
rives halfway through the session,
students typically remain mired in in
tense deliberation over the proofs.
When the problems are finally
diseussed as a group, most students
are eager to describe their individual
solutions and methods. During one
student's presentation of a problem,
another piped up.
"I don't doubt the validity of this
proof," he said."But I wouldn't know
how I 'd write a solution like that dur
ing the Putnam."
Vakil has arranged for Stanford's
participation in the Putnam exam
since he arrived in 2(K)1. Over the last
three years, he has organized the
weekly sessions and the master class
for advanced students as well.
While Vakil recognized that the
students in the sessions were limited
to mostly "techies." he acknowledged
the diversity in the group in terms of
age, race, gender and nationality.
Open to the entire academic commu

nity, the classes periodically entertain
high school and even middle school
students. And international students
hailing from Singapore, Japan and
Turkey also pack into the Math Con
ference Room each Monday.
Vakil said that he did not plan to
end his relationship with the Putnam
exam any time soon, which began
when he scored in the top live in the
nation for four consecutive years as
an undergraduate at the University
of Toronto. Whether as a student or a
professor, Vakil said that he loves it
when students "see problems they
don't know about at all and then
have an amazing idea about how to
tackle it by thinking creatively."
So far, it seems that Vakil is right
on track. When asked why he gives
up his Monday nights for the Put
nam. sophomore John Le was quick
to answer.
"The problems make my brain
light up." he said. "And when 1 solve
a hard problem it just feels so good."

Dozens of students meet each Monday evening in the Math Building to hone problem-solving techniques for the
upcoming William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition on Dec. 2. The test's median score is one out of 120.
