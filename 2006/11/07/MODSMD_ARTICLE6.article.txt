## Run targets "silent killer" Asian Liver Center hopes to raise Hepatitis B funding 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
Just one year ago, Medical School student Steven
Lin had no idea that an obscure "developing world" dis
ease like liepatitis B could devastate his life.
That was before a close family member of Lin's
began to experience excruciating stomach pains
and constant nausea — finally to be diagnosed with
a severe form of the disease, known as the "silent
killer."
"lie was 23 and went to college just like me," Lin
said. "That's when I realized this is not a disease that
only affects older people in developing countries, peo
ple I don't know. It could easily have been me in his
shoes right now looking at a one in four chance of dying
from liver cancer."
On Nov. 11, Stanford's Asian Liver Center, where
Lin now serves as health and research coordinator, will
host the second annual LlVLRight run at Sand Hill

Fields to raise money and awareness for Hepatitis B.
the leading cause of liver cancer.
Though it has never drawn as much attention in the
U.S. as other global epidemics have. I iepatitis B affects
10 times as many people as does HIV/AIDS, with 350 to
400 million infected worldwide. The disease is particu
larly devastating to Asian-Americans — one in 10 is af
flicted with the disease.
LlVLRight aims to raise $ 1 (M).(KK) this year to help
provide outreach, education and low-cost screening
and vaccinations to at-risk populations, according to
Outreach Coordinator Kimberly Sue. Runners in the
event will have the chance to learn about Hepatitis B on
the 5K course, dotted with posters.
According to Lin, the disease is preventable — an
effective vaccine was developed over 20 years ago. The
problem, he said, is a matter of awareness.
"People do not have to die," Lin said. "The reason
people are dying is because there's a huge lack of
knowledge. Nobody's shouting about it."
A slow hut brutal illness. Hepatitis B gained the
moniker "silent killer" because it is often transmitted
through the body without the knowledge of the carrier.
"lt is so shocking just how many
people get infected and don't know."
he said."By the time you actually see
symptoms, it's usually really had or
too late."
According to Lin. the social stig
ma associated with the disease also
prevents effective treatment. In
Asia, home to the greatest number
of Hepatitis B carriers, individuals
diagnosed with 1 icpatitis B face con
siderable discrimination — just last
month. Chinese newspapers report
ed that 19 students who tested posi

tive for HBV were expelled from a
junior high school in the province of
Xinjiang.
Meanwhile, in the United States.
Lin said that because 1 iepatitis B af
fects only the Asian-American pop
ulation in considerable numbers, the
fight against the disease has not re
ceived much support from the feder
al government.
"A lot of funding is not going to
Hepatitis B prevention because
i Asian Americans are such a small
population and we don't have a
strong voice politically." Lin said.
Stanford's Asian Liver Center is
the only non-profit organization in
the country to address the high inci
dence of 1 lepatitis B in Asian-Ameri
cans. Recently, however, the center

has made strides in Congress, lobby
ing Rep. Mike Honda (I)-CA) and
Rep. ( liarles Dent (R-PA), and Sen.
Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Sen. Di
anne Feinstein (D-CA) to introduce
the first ever I lepatitis B legislation in
December 2(X)5 and June 200fi. re
spectively. Hie bill calls for a national
plan to provide research funding, edu
cation and treatment for Hepatitis B.
Lin stressed the importance of
overcoming social stigmas in order
to spread the word about the disease.
"We have to let people know that
they're not alone out there and that
there are resources for them to
seek," he said.
