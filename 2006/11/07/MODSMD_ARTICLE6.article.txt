## Run targets "silent killer" Asian Liver Center hopes to raise Hepatitis B funding 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
Just one year ago, Medical School student Steven
Lin had no idea that an obscure "developing world" dis
ease like liepatitis B could devastate his life.
That was before a close family member of Lin's
began to experience excruciating stomach pains
and constant nausea — finally to be diagnosed with
a severe form of the disease, known as the "silent
killer."
"lie was 23 and went to college just like me," Lin
said. "That's when I realized this is not a disease that
only affects older people in developing countries, peo
ple I don't know. It could easily have been me in his
shoes right now looking at a one in four chance of dying
from liver cancer."
On Nov. 11, Stanford's Asian Liver Center, where
Lin now serves as health and research coordinator, will
host the second annual LlVLRight run at Sand Hill

Fields to raise money and awareness for Hepatitis B.
the leading cause of liver cancer.
Though it has never drawn as much attention in the
U.S. as other global epidemics have. I iepatitis B affects
10 times as many people as does HIV/AIDS, with 350 to
400 million infected worldwide. The disease is particu
larly devastating to Asian-Americans — one in 10 is af
flicted with the disease.
LlVLRight aims to raise $ 1 (M).(KK) this year to help
provide outreach, education and low-cost screening
and vaccinations to at-risk populations, according to
Outreach Coordinator Kimberly Sue. Runners in the
event will have the chance to learn about Hepatitis B on
the 5K course, dotted with posters.
According to Lin, the disease is preventable — an
effective vaccine was developed over 20 years ago. The
problem, he said, is a matter of awareness.
"People do not have to die," Lin said. "The reason
people are dying is because there's a huge lack of
knowledge. Nobody's shouting about it."
A slow hut brutal illness. Hepatitis B gained the
moniker "silent killer" because it is often transmitted
through the body without the knowledge of the carrier.
