Arnold Schwarzenegger for Governor and
explored five noteworthy propositions on
the ballot.To that end, we are heartened by
the discussions that our editorials have gen

also on our online forums.
Granted, some of the propositions on the
ballot are highly technical. Propositions 89
and C X). which seek reforms in campaign fi
nance and property rights, seem particularly
confusing and uninteresting to students.
But there are many issues that students
may find easy to connect with and under

The world is quite literally in your hands.
Do the right thing. Go vote.
