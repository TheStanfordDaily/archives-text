# George Bush, Global Warming, Genocide in Darfur

### 
Don't you wish the world would just
end already? Sixty years since Hi
roshima. all that gossip about Nu
clear Armageddon has still come to nothing
— a couple meltdowns, an Arms Race
sponsored by the military-industrial com
plex and the occasional Cuban Missile Cri
sis. Despite all the buzz, the year 2000 didn't
destroy modern civilization. The seven an
gels have yet to sound their seven trumpets.
There's been no Armageddon. Qiyamah,
Acharit I layamim. not even a single solitary
Ragnarok. Oh sure, you've got North Korea
acting all big with their shrimpy megaton
tests, and Iran riding the anti-American
wave all over the Middle Fast, but you can
tell that it's all just another tease.The world,
in all probability, will go on spinning after
we die. How lame.
People always talk about how scary the
Cold War was. with the paranoia, the over
regulation and the tendency to characterize
an entire system of thought as evil. The
Boomers grew up in that environment.
There were school A-bomb drills ("Quick!
Under the desk!"). There were rumors that
the Russians were winning the Space Race.
Fear was everywhere.
God, how wonderful! Any day now, any
second now, the whole world is going to dis
appear in front of your eyes. The only thing
left of you will be a few spare atoms floating
through the amorphous ether that used to
be the third planet from the sun. You don't
need to worry about your future because it's
not going to last the decade; you don't need
to worry about your family because they'll
explode right along with you.
The boring people sought security be
hind McCarthy and bomb shelters.The cool
people, meanwhile, dropped out. tuned in,
went on road trips across the country, en
gaged in all manner of immoral sexual rela
tions and generally raised their middle lin
ger and shoved it up the government's ass.
But the Baby Boomers revealed them
selves as the Great Bullshit Generation
somewhere around the late '70s, when it
started to become clear that the world,
sadly, wasn't going to end. Some of them de
scended into depression, which gave rise to
the era of psychotherapy and Tony Soprano.
Some of them lost their souls and turned
Neocon. Most of them just started to make
money. I"he ones who stayed crazy couldn't
help but seem a bit childish (there's a reason
why Cartman hates hippies).
Read Hunter S.Thompson. His two great
"Fear and Loathing" books read like dime
postcards from the Inferno — echoing with
gleeful, addictive nihilism, like Armaged
don Chic. Now read anything from Ibomp
son's later years. The talent is still there —
that self-mocking I lemingway vulgarity, the
words that slice like credit cards through co
caine — but there is a deep sadness, too. as
if Thompson were more disappointed than
we were to find out he was still alive. What's
the point of living, if the world is just going
to leave you behind, eventually?

Well, the wheel has turned. Our politi
cians have gotten steadily dumber (Repub
licans) and more useless (Democrats.) Peo
ple still question global warming, as if hurri
canes and heat waves and every fricking sci
entist in the world isn't enough evidence
that there's something wrong. 1 know a few
people who insist it's a natural climate shift.
This is my recommendation for those peo
ple:
1. Kneel down so your nose and mouth are
directly in front of an SUV exhaust pipe.
2. Have you friend start the car.
3. Inhale deeply.
Once you've stopped weeping and gag
ging and choking up lungblood, ask your
self: Does that smell good for the environ
ment?
It's not just global warming. We've found
ourselves in a truly crap period of history.
Anything America does makes everything
worse for everyone — even when, as with
the midsummer Lebanon snafu, all we do is
nothing. Furope is going down the low
birth-rate crapper, China can buy or sell us,
the debt is growing and it seems like every
couple years there's a new genocide we ei
ther ignore or aimlessly dis-endorse. Every
one I know always talks about the '90s now
as some golden time, when the world was
nicer. Can you imagine? Our government
spent years prosecuting the chief executive
for a blowjob.
But we need to grow up. So the world is
getting worse. Ibis is an important realiza
tion. the first real lesson that defines you as
an adult. Rainforests give way to industry;
beauty fades to wrinkles; your bones ache,
your hands shakes, your vision gets dull and
you find yourself turning the iPod higher.
The Boomers thought they would be young
forever, but Pete Townshend didn't die be
fore he got old. We can be great because we
do not have the Armageddon safety net. We
can be great because we have been taught to
question authority, because whereas our
parents had "Dennis the Menace," we had
"The X-Files." We are not pointlessly cyni
cal. like the '90s Generation: Tyler burden
might have talked a lot about the plight of
the middle-class white male, but he was also
played by Brad Pitt.
John F. Kennedy once made up an old
Chinese curse:"May You Live in Interesting
Times." We kids, who grew up in what


Franich
Ire and Vice
seemed like the paradise after the
End of History, now have to face
down a world filled with poverty,
greed, violence, pointless death and
abject stupidity. We don't even have
the End of the World to look forward
to anymore. We will not live easy
lives, but at least it won't be boring.

directly in front of an SUV exhaust pipe.

nothing. Furope is going down the low

the debt is growing and it seems like every

abject stupidity. We don't even have

Don't you wish the world would just
end already? Sixty years since Hi
roshima. all that gossip about Nu
clear Armageddon has still come to nothing
— a couple meltdowns, an Arms Race
sponsored by the military-industrial com
plex and the occasional Cuban Missile Cri
sis. Despite all the buzz, the year 2000 didn't
destroy modern civilization. The seven an
gels have yet to sound their seven trumpets.
There's been no Armageddon. Qiyamah,
Acharit I layamim. not even a single solitary
Ragnarok. Oh sure, you've got North Korea
acting all big with their shrimpy megaton
tests, and Iran riding the anti-American
wave all over the Middle Fast, but you can
tell that it's all just another tease.The world,
in all probability, will go on spinning after
we die. How lame.
People always talk about how scary the
Cold War was. with the paranoia, the over
regulation and the tendency to characterize
an entire system of thought as evil. The
Boomers grew up in that environment.
There were school A-bomb drills ("Quick!
Under the desk!"). There were rumors that
the Russians were winning the Space Race.
Fear was everywhere.
God, how wonderful! Any day now, any
second now, the whole world is going to dis
appear in front of your eyes. The only thing
left of you will be a few spare atoms floating
through the amorphous ether that used to
be the third planet from the sun. You don't
need to worry about your future because it's
not going to last the decade; you don't need
to worry about your family because they'll
explode right along with you.
The boring people sought security be
hind McCarthy and bomb shelters.The cool
people, meanwhile, dropped out. tuned in,
went on road trips across the country, en
gaged in all manner of immoral sexual rela
tions and generally raised their middle lin
ger and shoved it up the government's ass.
But the Baby Boomers revealed them
selves as the Great Bullshit Generation
somewhere around the late '70s, when it
started to become clear that the world,
sadly, wasn't going to end. Some of them de
scended into depression, which gave rise to
the era of psychotherapy and Tony Soprano.
