## REPUBLICAN DOOLITTLE WINS OVER DEMOCRAT, CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONS 
### 
GOP Rep. John Doolittle beat down a
strong challenge lrom Democrat Charlie
Brown on Tuesday, winning despite a cam
paign that focused on the incumbent's ties to a
congressional corruption investigation.
Doolittle won 50 percent of the vote to
Brown's 45 percent with 83 percent of
precincts reporting. The margin was far closer
than usual for the powerful eight-term incum
bent and a measure of the inroads Brown
made in Doolittle's rock-solid Republican dis
trict.
Brown, a first-time candidate who's re
tired Air Force lieutenant colonel and a for
mer Republican, conceded defeat around
midnight.
Brown's candidacy initially was dismissed
by Democratic Party leaders in the district
that stretches from Sacramento to the Neva
da border and north to Oregon. Republicans
have a registration advantage of about IS
percentage points over Democrats in the dis
trict.
The Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal cost
Doolittle his comfort margin in polls as he
emerged with close ties to the former lobby
ist who pleaded guilty earlier this year in a
conspiracy to corrupt public officials.
Doolittle, a member of the House GOP
leadership and of the powerful Appropria
tions Committee, took campaign money

from Abramoff and interceded on behalf of
his clients, while his wife also worked for
Abramoff. Abramoff is cooperating in an on
going investigation.
