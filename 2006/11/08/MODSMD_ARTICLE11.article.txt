# POMBO EXPECTED TO LOSE HOUSE SEAT
## 
### 
In California's most hotly contested House
race. Democratic challenger Jerry McNerney
hung onto a narrow lead over GOP Rep.
Richard Pombo. Doolittle had 50 percent and
Brown had 45 percent with 82 percent of
precincts reporting.
Pombo, chairman of the House Resources
Committee and environmentalists' public
enemy No. 1 for his pro-industry legislating,
faced a rematch with wind-energy engineer
McNerney.
Pombo easily beat the little-known Democ
rat two years ago in his district straddling the
San Joaquin Valley and the eastern San Fran
cisco Bay area. This time around. McNerney
had help from big-spending environmental
groups, new questions about Pombo's ethics
and a national political mood going Democ
rats' way.
National Republicans spent more than $1
million to help Pombo hang onto his district,
where the GOP advantage is slipping as Bay
area commuters move in. But the Sierra Club,
Defenders of Wildlife and other groups spent
at least that much against him, incensed over
Pombo's fundraising from industry as he
aimed to rewrite species protections and in
crease oil drilling.
California's other House districts didn't
offer serious contests. The current breakdown
of the state's delegation is 33 Democrats and
20 Republicans.
Meanwhile, in California's U.S. Senate race.
Democrat Dianne
Feinstein easily beat Republican Dick Moun
tjoy in her bid for a third full term.
