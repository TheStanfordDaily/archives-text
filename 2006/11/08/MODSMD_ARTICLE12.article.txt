# JERRY BROWN BACK IN STATEWIDE OFFICE AS TOP COP
## 
### 
Jerry Brown won his first election the year
man walked on the moon.Tuesday, the Demo
crat once mocked as "Governor
Moonbeam," took his long and colorful career
to a whole new place by winning the race for
California attorney general.
Brown was a two-term governor, three
time presidential candidate and, for the last
eight years, mayor of Oakland.
He saw his crowded resume as good train
ing for attorney general.
"All of these things gave me a very broad
range of experience, which enables me to give
very sound advice to the governor and legisla
tors," he said.
With one of the best-known names — not
to mention nicknames — in California poli
tics, Brown started the race with a fundraising
edge over Republican Chuck Poochigian, a
state senator from Fresno.
That didn't change much despite Poochi
gian's scrappy attempt to convince voters that
a recent upsurge in Oakland crime meant
Brown wasn't ready to be top cop.
"My greatest challenge was to overcome
his name ID," Poochigian said. "His greatest
challenge was to overcome his record."
