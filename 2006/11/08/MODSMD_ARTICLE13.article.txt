## Editorial Board Resuscitate common rooms 
### 
The lounge is a vital aspect of Stanford
residential housing. It is a place to so
cialize, have meetings, do homework
and potentially have a party. Unfortunately,
many common areas in Stanford dormito
ries are ill-equipped to provide students
with anything except an open space. This
feature may be conducive to some forms ot
socializing, including parties, but it does not
offer a consistent environment for simply
relaxing for a few minutes and blowing ott
steam.
An important disclaimer: several resi
dences have beautiful lounges with working
electronic equipment, game tables and de
cent furniture. Regrettably, these houses
are the exceptions rather than the norm.
Most lounges have broken ping-pong
equipment, pool tables without cues or balls
and TVs that are barely, if at all functional.
Some camaraderie can be forged by trying
to coax decrepit pool or foosball tables into
working, but the fun fades fast.
Who is to blame for the state of disrepair
and minimal operation of so many common
room amenities? Doubtless, irresponsible
and destructive students could be cited for
most of the damage, and it is worth noting
that the slightly remote and fairly quiet
Manzanita complex has some of the best
lounges around. It is understandable that
University Housing would want to encour
age a policy of collective responsibility and
emphasize accountability for any damage,
but by leaving it entirely up to members of
individual residences to manage most
lounge features themselves, they have cre
ated an unfair inheritance structure.
In the existing system,students take over
lounges of varying quality when they move
in. If they are lucky, the previous year's res
idents were clean, careful and generous in
spending house funds on getting new equip
ment. If not, the new residents face a choice:
make do with a sub-par lounge, or spend
most of their house funds to spruce it up at
the costs of other residential activities like
snow trips. Particularly vulnerable are

freshmen who have little say in which resi
dence they are assigned to. and are hesitate
to spend house funds for fear of missing out
on freshmen dorm-bonding activities. Stu
dents have little incentive to spend money
on items like foosball tables that will only
be used by future residents.
The responsibility for outfitting lounges
should not be left solely to individual resi
dences. Instead of allowing continual disin
tegration. a basic standard should include a
functional TV and at least one fully
equipped recreational game table at the
start of each year.Then, if damage occurs or
anything goes missing, houses can be held
responsible, just as they are if something
happens to the nearby (but much better
maintained) computer cluster, which is
University property.
Another feature noticeably missing
from most lounges is cable. It may sound
trivial, but the ability to cheer a hometown
sports team, watch a favorite series or tune
into cable news shows would offer a serious
improvement for all lounges. Besides indi
vidual gratification, cable in lounges will
also provide a valuable social service. Some
sports games or dramas are on networks
and can be viewed in lounges, but if your
show is not on a major channel, you are out
of luck.
Difficulties arise because in order to
hook up a dorm to Stanford's subscription
services, a house must pay ITSS the same
amount as if every resident purchased cable
individually. Furthermore, students are for
bidden from purchasing cable from outside
sources like Dish or Comcast, creating an
effective monopoly for Stanford's cable
company. Cingular. who has a hold over
Stanford's cell phone market, at least pro
vides a discount for students.
Understandably, supplying free in-room
cable for all students would be too expen
sive. But making cable available in all com
mon rooms should not entail the massive

will not agree to this, residences
should be free to seek outside com

residential life, we should not over

common rooms. The opportunity to
relax with a game of ping-pong or
gather in the lounge every night for
an anticipated new episode, a big
game or election coverage has
tremendous value in fostering the
social environment Stanford should
have.
