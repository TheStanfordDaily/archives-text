# It's all in the pan

If your goal is to create the maximum
amount of flavor with a minimum of
time and effort, it's tough to beat pan
cooking. Master a few basic techniques and
you're well on your way to an easy one-pan
meal. As for the pan itself: they come in a
variety of materials and surfaces, from cop
per to stainless steel to nonstick, all of
which have advantages and disadvantages.
The important thing is to pick a heavy,
thick-bottomed pan. A thin, flimsy pan
doesn't distribute heat and makes it hard to
avoid burning your food. Once you've got
your pan, season your meat thoroughly
with salt and pepper and sear it confidently.
If you're concerned about sodium intake,
well,do what you have to do to stay healthy.
But I guarantee that delicious restaurant
filet you got on Parents' Week looked like it
had been left out in the snow before they
put it in the pan â€” that's how much salt
they use.
The first step for successful searing is a
really hot pan. Beginning cooks tend to get
skittish and start turning or adjusting the
meat as soon as they see any sizzle. Have
faith and let it go until you get that rich,
golden brown. Browning reactions are re
sponsible for some of the deepest flavors

around (think chocolate or coffee), and the
chance to thoroughly brown the surface of
the meat is the biggest incentive for pan
cooking in the first place. The bits of meat
that searing leaves behind on the pan can
form the flavor base for a quick and easy
sauce.The trick is to add a small amount of
liquid (usually,but not always,some sort of
alcohol) and scrape those stuck on bits off
the bottom of the pan. This technique is
called deglazing. As with searing, this is no
time to be shy. Really get in there with a
metal spatula (if you're using a nonstick
pan, stick to plastic) and scrape up all of
that flavor.The last step is swirling in a little
butter to finish the sauce. Again, balance
your own health concerns against the set-
