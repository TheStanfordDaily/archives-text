# Judgment day at the gym
## 
### 
The second you step into the gym. you
enter into a merciless judgment zone,
not intended for the weak of heart.
No one is safe from each other, and especial
ly not from themselves. Once inside the con
crete. windowless walls of the Arrillaga's
Recreational Gym. your generally friendly
thoughts are quickly swept to the wayside,
and a new ruthless mental code of conduct
immediately takes hold. The gym forces my
thoughts into the devil's lair of negativity —
the second I take off my sweatshirt and turn
on my iPod, the gym has already begun to
suck out my appreciation of humanity, fill
ing the gap with its repugnant spawn: brutal
comparisons, harsh judgments and vicious
self-deprecation.
The first step on every gym-goers path
towards condemnation is simple observa
tion. With little intriguing visual input, we
are forced to watch those around us, and we
start to notice patterns. No matter what day
you go or what strange time you show up.
hoping to snag a free elliptical, you run into
the usual gym suspects. Over in the free
weights area, there is always that guy
dressed in a skin-tight red Underarmour
shirt who is bench pressing. And bench
pressing. And bench pressing some more.
Without fail, on the elliptical next to you

who. depending on the day. is wearing either
knee-length spandex. chandelier earrings or
pink. Inevitably, two awkwardly old people
walk in together, bringing the average age
of the gym from 21 up to 30. And gracing the
stationary bike, there is always some hard
bodied hottie — a hidden treasure of fit
ness. You wonder who this incredibly in
shape, crazily sweaty, hard-working hunk
could be. until he puts his shirt back on and
you realize he's on theTrack and Field team.
You are casually people watching, pick
ing up on categories of gym-users. And then
suddenly and inevitably you start to get
sucked into the realm of judging. You can't
help but stare at Hulky McHottßutt as he

leans over to change the weights, but
of course he probably has to go to
the gym every day for hours to culti
vate his derriere. Celly McUlite
should probably take a cue from
Hulky, and Oldie McFart should
have two decades ago. Scrawnie Mc-
Graw and Twiggie McGee should
definiteh look into lifting together
before you confuse them with 12-
year old girls from behind again.
You start to draw ever harsher and
more irrational conclusions about the
strangers around you. You hate the
girl running on the treadmill in booty
shorts and a sports bra. but you run
ten minutes longer so you can look
like her. You hate the meat-head who
makes ridiculous noises as he does his
bicep curls for the eighth rep — but
you can't help picturing him in bed.
She is skinnier. I le is buffer. She is fat
ter. He is hotter, l itter. Better.
All of my ruthless judgments,
however, are ultimately measuring
sticks held up to my own body — 1
compare my abs, legs, work-out rou
tine and estimated fitness level with

every other Stanford student and
wayward faculty member that dares
step foot inside the combat zone. Not
only do 1 internally guffaw at Celly's
flabby arms as she pumps them back
and forth on the elliptical, but 1 then
check my arm's own movement to
see just how much more stationary
my tricep-area truly remains. She is
lifting ten pounds for that? Well I am
doing twelve and a half and with
damn better form.
My constant mental barrage of
judgment begs the question. Why do
I. why do any of us really go to the
gym? God knows it is not for the
view from the basement or the per
fumed air. Do we go to feel good? To
look g00d...t0 look better...to look
better than her? Life is a competi
tion to get good grades, to land jobs
and to date McHottbutt. and your
relationship resume seems to in
crease ten-fold when you can boast a
washboard stomach and a pair of
shapely gams.
I'm the first to admit that all too
often I work out for the wrong rea
sons. 1 want my new pair of jeans to
fit better. 1 want to be skinnier. 1
want guys to notice me more. I am so
busy drawing dangerous conclusions
about my self-worth and mentally
chopping down every pathetic gym

goer that happens to cross my visual
line of fire that 1 forget to congratu
late myself for simply working out.
Or for running a mile faster, or push
ing through more crunches. 1 never
stop to enjoy the release and relief of
a good work-out.
Our bodies are a frustratingly con
trollable part of our appearance, and
I think we all judge too quickly and
harshly about what type of person has
what type of body. But what if, just if,
we stopped drawing comparisons and
focused that attention inward? What
if we tried going to the gym for our
selves? I wouldn't know what to
think, but I am sure it would be a good
start down the path to strengthening
my all-too-feeble body image.
On the other hand, to all the varsi
ty athletes 1 have seen in the last
month in the Recreational Center: Se
riously, use the weight room at 6:00
a.m. with the rest of your team. You
are making us all feel bad about our
relatively spotty dedication and
mediocre will power, and your eye
candy just isn't worth the deeper blow
to our fragile sense of self-worth.

leans over to change the weights, but
of course he probably has to go to
the gym every day for hours to culti
vate his derriere. Celly McUlite
should probably take a cue from
Hulky, and Oldie McFart should
have two decades ago. Scrawnie Mc-
Graw and Twiggie McGee should
definiteh look into lifting together
before you confuse them with 12-
year old girls from behind again.
You start to draw ever harsher and
more irrational conclusions about the
strangers around you. You hate the
girl running on the treadmill in booty
shorts and a sports bra. but you run
ten minutes longer so you can look
like her. You hate the meat-head who
makes ridiculous noises as he does his
bicep curls for the eighth rep — but
you can't help picturing him in bed.
She is skinnier. I le is buffer. She is fat
ter. He is hotter, l itter. Better.
All of my ruthless judgments,
however, are ultimately measuring
sticks held up to my own body — 1
compare my abs, legs, work-out rou
tine and estimated fitness level with

every other Stanford student and
wayward faculty member that dares
step foot inside the combat zone. Not
only do 1 internally guffaw at Celly's
flabby arms as she pumps them back
and forth on the elliptical, but 1 then
check my arm's own movement to
see just how much more stationary
my tricep-area truly remains. She is
lifting ten pounds for that? Well I am
doing twelve and a half and with
damn better form.
My constant mental barrage of
judgment begs the question. Why do
I. why do any of us really go to the
gym? God knows it is not for the
view from the basement or the per
fumed air. Do we go to feel good? To
look g00d...t0 look better...to look
better than her? Life is a competi
tion to get good grades, to land jobs
and to date McHottbutt. and your
relationship resume seems to in
crease ten-fold when you can boast a
washboard stomach and a pair of
shapely gams.
I'm the first to admit that all too
often I work out for the wrong rea
sons. 1 want my new pair of jeans to
fit better. 1 want to be skinnier. 1
want guys to notice me more. I am so
busy drawing dangerous conclusions
about my self-worth and mentally
chopping down every pathetic gym

goer that happens to cross my visual
line of fire that 1 forget to congratu
late myself for simply working out.
Or for running a mile faster, or push
ing through more crunches. 1 never
stop to enjoy the release and relief of
a good work-out.
Our bodies are a frustratingly con
trollable part of our appearance, and
I think we all judge too quickly and
harshly about what type of person has
what type of body. But what if, just if,
we stopped drawing comparisons and
focused that attention inward? What
if we tried going to the gym for our
selves? I wouldn't know what to
think, but I am sure it would be a good
start down the path to strengthening
my all-too-feeble body image.

to our fragile sense of self-worth.

The second you step into the gym. you
enter into a merciless judgment zone,
not intended for the weak of heart.
No one is safe from each other, and especial
ly not from themselves. Once inside the con
crete. windowless walls of the Arrillaga's
Recreational Gym. your generally friendly
thoughts are quickly swept to the wayside,
and a new ruthless mental code of conduct
immediately takes hold. The gym forces my
thoughts into the devil's lair of negativity —
the second I take off my sweatshirt and turn
on my iPod, the gym has already begun to
suck out my appreciation of humanity, fill
ing the gap with its repugnant spawn: brutal
comparisons, harsh judgments and vicious
self-deprecation.
The first step on every gym-goers path
towards condemnation is simple observa
tion. With little intriguing visual input, we
are forced to watch those around us, and we
start to notice patterns. No matter what day
you go or what strange time you show up.
hoping to snag a free elliptical, you run into
the usual gym suspects. Over in the free
weights area, there is always that guy
dressed in a skin-tight red Underarmour
shirt who is bench pressing. And bench
pressing. And bench pressing some more.
Without fail, on the elliptical next to you

bounces the US Weekly-reading, hip-pop
ping. arms-flailing, ponytail swishing blonde
who. depending on the day. is wearing either
knee-length spandex. chandelier earrings or
pink. Inevitably, two awkwardly old people
walk in together, bringing the average age
of the gym from 21 up to 30. And gracing the
stationary bike, there is always some hard
bodied hottie — a hidden treasure of fit
ness. You wonder who this incredibly in
shape, crazily sweaty, hard-working hunk
could be. until he puts his shirt back on and
you realize he's on theTrack and Field team.
You are casually people watching, pick
ing up on categories of gym-users. And then
suddenly and inevitably you start to get
sucked into the realm of judging. You can't
help but stare at Hulky McHottßutt as he
