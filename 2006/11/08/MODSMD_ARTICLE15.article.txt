# Judgment day at the gym
## 
### 
The second you step into the gym. you
enter into a merciless judgment zone,
not intended for the weak of heart.
No one is safe from each other, and especial
ly not from themselves. Once inside the con
crete. windowless walls of the Arrillaga's
Recreational Gym. your generally friendly
thoughts are quickly swept to the wayside,
and a new ruthless mental code of conduct
immediately takes hold. The gym forces my
thoughts into the devil's lair of negativity —
the second I take off my sweatshirt and turn
on my iPod, the gym has already begun to
suck out my appreciation of humanity, fill

comparisons, harsh judgments and vicious
self-deprecation.
The first step on every gym-goers path

of the gym from 21 up to 30. And gracing the
stationary bike, there is always some hard
bodied hottie — a hidden treasure of fit
ness. You wonder who this incredibly in
shape, crazily sweaty, hard-working hunk
could be. until he puts his shirt back on and
you realize he's on theTrack and Field team.
You are casually people watching, pick

suddenly and inevitably you start to get
