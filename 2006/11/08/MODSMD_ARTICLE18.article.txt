# Do electric sheep dream of cyber sex?
## 
### 
The three-day rule. It's the unwritten
guideline that you wait three days after
getting a phone number to call some
one. Before three days, you're considered
desperate. Afterwards, you're inconsiderate.
Unfortunately, societal manners have not
caught up with technology to decide on ap
propriate rules for the Facebook, texting and
various other ways of communication. This is
one of those times where technology has ad
vanced to such a degree mankind cannot
fathom its implications. First snap bracelets,
now this. Thanks, science.
Maybe you've tried calling someone using
their Facebook-listed phone number, only to
hear Domino's Pizza on the other end. Or
you've poked someone and had their parents
contact you about wedding arrangements.
The wall-to-wall posting mechanism is inno
cent enough. That is, until that time you have
cyber sex and it goes on the newsfeed. The
best friend she's "married" to probably isn't
happy about that. When I wrote about Face
book.com three years ago, I never thought it
would be interweaved in the social tapestry
of college life as seamlessly as a wrecked old
tanker.
The issue that confronts our generation is
an uncertainty, a perpetual grey area in terms
of what is considered an appropriate way of
communicating with one another. Is an e
mail more casual than a message, a poke, a
wall post, a text? How long do you have to
know the person before you can message
them? Why does newsfeed keep posting my
social security number? Mark Zuckerberg is
the Oppenheimer of the college social scene,
and he can't take back the power that he has
unleashed upon confused undergrads. We're
now in a technological arms race, and to be
left out would be social annihilation. 1 hear

that North Korea might be developing a
"Facebook" weapon.
I wasn't surprised by the Daily's report on
how students may have obsessive behavior
about e-mail checking. The age of instant grat
ification has now gotten to the point where stu
dents not only want to be accessible by phone
at all times, but they want to read e-mails the
instant they are sent. G-mail is currently work
ing on a system so users can get e-mails before
they are actually written. G-Oracle.
While we struggle with these questions, we
remind ourselves that this is the age of conven
ience. Things are only going to get more con
venient from here on out. We're only going to
have more ways of instantly talking to people
and we will find new ways to digitally transfer
our social functions online. Dating. Slaying
Dragons. Even sex. Deus Ex MySpace.
I've known couples who share online
RPG characters rather than going out to din
ner. As they level up, the relationship does as
well. I'm sure their conversations on whether
they should sell the troll's blood or attack the
goblins opens a window into each other's
souls. They just wish those souls had USB
ports.
Isaac Asimov's novels on androids focus
on the idea that artificial intelligence can be
distinguished from humanity because hu

mans have empathy. Humans nowadays
worry so much about what others perceive in
their use of technology that they are actually
bound by it. We're afraid of being considered
sketchy, of scaring off that potential romantic
interest. The modern novel of manners in
cludes references to messaging, texting and
the hilarious mix-ups of finding love in the
digital age. Possible title: "I, Jane Austen (A
Victorian Android's Tale)." Our entire lives
can be read on newsfeed and our relation
ships can be reduced to a heart icon and a few
lines of text. A computer virus would only su
perficially wipe away what we know is al
ready gone: humanity.
Technology gives some people confidence
that the normal world does not. Being a level
60 wizard will do that for you. But the rise of
technology has also stunted and confused a
generation. College social traditions like cof
fee houses, kegger and water-boarding the
pledges have been taken away. The Stanford
Challenge would get more student participa
tion if it focused on concrete goals students can
relate to. like figuring out the poking feature.
But 1 don't think this is entirely a new
problem. We'll always have difficulty relating
to one another, and technology hasn't made
it any easier. It takes a conscious effort to
turn off AIM. put the cell on vibrate and tell
G-mail to shove it. As the electric sheep bleat
and we transfer our faces and figures to the
fictitious Facebook forums, I'll be whistling
my own merry tune as I walk in the cool night
air to find the last bastions of human resist
ance: a party. See you Cyberbodies around, I
hope.

Isaac Asimov's novels on androids focus
on the idea that artificial intelligence can be
distinguished from humanity because hu

mans have empathy. Humans nowadays
worry so much about what others perceive in
their use of technology that they are actually
bound by it. We're afraid of being considered
sketchy, of scaring off that potential romantic
interest. The modern novel of manners in
cludes references to messaging, texting and
the hilarious mix-ups of finding love in the
digital age. Possible title: "I, Jane Austen (A
Victorian Android's Tale)." Our entire lives
can be read on newsfeed and our relation
ships can be reduced to a heart icon and a few
lines of text. A computer virus would only su
perficially wipe away what we know is al
ready gone: humanity.
Technology gives some people confidence
that the normal world does not. Being a level
60 wizard will do that for you. But the rise of
technology has also stunted and confused a
generation. College social traditions like cof
fee houses, kegger and water-boarding the
pledges have been taken away. The Stanford
Challenge would get more student participa
tion if it focused on concrete goals students can
relate to. like figuring out the poking feature.
But 1 don't think this is entirely a new
problem. We'll always have difficulty relating
to one another, and technology hasn't made
it any easier. It takes a conscious effort to
turn off AIM. put the cell on vibrate and tell
G-mail to shove it. As the electric sheep bleat
and we transfer our faces and figures to the
fictitious Facebook forums, I'll be whistling
my own merry tune as I walk in the cool night
air to find the last bastions of human resist
ance: a party. See you Cyberbodies around, I
hope.
