How could anyone have a problem
with feminism?
In his November 6th column proclaiming
feminism as "The new Anti-Imperialism,"
Peter Durning wonders why "an accurate,
positive image of feminism has not grafted it
self onto mainstream America." He is correct
that stereotypes of feminism as "anti-male",
"whiny", a "girls-only club", or a "lesbian
conspiracy" are inaccurate and unfair. Those
stereotypes don't reflect my experience in
Feminist Studies courses at Stanford. Yet al
though the majority of feminists do not
"hate" men, there is a nontrivial minority of
feminists who say things about men that also
sound pretty inaccurate and unfair (see Mary
Daly, Marilyn French, Andrea Dworkin and
Catharine MacKinnon, for a start).
Mary Daly, for instance, wouldn't mind if
most males were wiped from the face of the
planet; in the interview "No Man's Land"
with the WIE Magazine she calls this a
process of "decontamination." Marilyn
French claims in The War Against Women

that "men's need to dominate women may be
based in their own sense of marginality or
emptiness; we do not know its root, and men
are making no effort to discover it" (if you
are a man who protests this statement, you
simply prove that you are making no effort to
discover all the awful things you do to
women). Durning approvingly quotes a
friend of his:"Men benefit from this suffering
[of women), and they don't do anything to
confront it - they usually don't even recog
nize that their unfair advantage is a problem.
[...] I don't think that men, as a whole, even
consider women to be human by their stan
dards." Although there are examples of dis
crimination that simultaneously benefit men
and cause women to suffer, such a broad
claim that men benefit from female suffering
and consider women to be subhuman only
makes sense if you view men as a monolithic
hive-mind without any kind of empathy for
women or interest in their well-being — a
view that dehumanizes men. Yes. discrimina
tion against women in the workplace benefits
me as a male worker, but it hurts me as a son

of a working mother. Likewise, female geni
tal mutilation benefits men who require it as
a condition of marriage, but it does not bene
tit men who oppose the practice.
It Durning cannot see why anyone would
have a problem with painting men with such
a broad brush, no wonder he is surprised by
feminism's negative image. If anyone made
such broad generalizations about women,
feminists (and probably Durning) would
rightly call it misogyny.
While it is unfair that all of feminism gets
tarred as man-hating, it is not surprising, es
pecially since feminists who don't bash men
tend to be lamentably slow in criticizing fem
inists who do. Durning himself doesn't ac
knowledge the existence of feminists who
may tullill some aspects of the negative
stereotypes of feminism, even to dismiss
these feminists as anomalies. Nor does he ac
knowledge the existence of any reasonable
critiques ot feminism, even to disagree with
them (for him, any criticism of feminism is
due to being "unitiated"). This one
sidedness is exactly the kind of rhet
oric that drives people away from
feminism.
If it was true that men don't rec
ognize that they have unfair advan
tages over women, then Durning
wouldn't have even written his arti
cle.and the entire pro-feminist men's
movement would not exist. He says
that "that the number of men who
fight to build a more gender-equi
table world is shameful." It would be
more accurate to say that the num
ber of people who fight to build a
more gender-equitable world is

shameful. Durning trivializes the
contributions of men against the op
pression of women, and the contri
butions of women to their own op
pression. as if women were passive
pawns of the patriarchy. As usual, it's
all men's fault.
Durning says that people who are
initiated into feminism know that
feminism is about "justice for
women." This is an empty answer:
the word "justice." like the word
"equality," is a concept that virtually
everyone accepts to be a good thing,
but which means different things to
different people. Durning might as
well say that feminists are for every
thing "good." Maybe feminist views
of justice and equality are better in
some way than non-feminist views,
but feminists will not convince any
one of this if they approach the dis

cussion with an attitude that they
hold the One True Way of defining
those terms.
Feminism is a complex move
ment with diverse perspectives
(some of which are unfortunately
negative towards men, and some
which are not). Conventional stereo
types about feminism fail to recog
nize this complexity, hut so does
Durning in his uncritical support of
feminism. Like any other political
movement, feminism contains a full
range of visionaries, zealots, healers,
and bigots. Instead of slamming fem
inists uniformly or devoting myself
to the cause religiously, I try to con
sider their arguments on a case-by
case basis.

"hate" men, there is a nontrivial minority of
feminists who say things about men that also
sound pretty inaccurate and unfair (see Mary
Daly, Marilyn French, Andrea Dworkin and
Catharine MacKinnon, for a start).
Mary Daly, for instance, wouldn't mind if
most males were wiped from the face of the
planet; in the interview "No Man's Land"
with the WIE Magazine she calls this a
process of "decontamination." Marilyn
French claims in The War Against Women

that "men's need to dominate women may be
based in their own sense of marginality or
emptiness; we do not know its root, and men
are making no effort to discover it" (if you
are a man who protests this statement, you
simply prove that you are making no effort to
discover all the awful things you do to
women). Durning approvingly quotes a
friend of his:"Men benefit from this suffering
[of women), and they don't do anything to
confront it - they usually don't even recog
nize that their unfair advantage is a problem.
[...] I don't think that men, as a whole, even
consider women to be human by their stan
dards." Although there are examples of dis
crimination that simultaneously benefit men
and cause women to suffer, such a broad
claim that men benefit from female suffering
and consider women to be subhuman only
makes sense if you view men as a monolithic
hive-mind without any kind of empathy for
women or interest in their well-being — a
view that dehumanizes men. Yes. discrimina
tion against women in the workplace benefits
me as a male worker, but it hurts me as a son

of a working mother. Likewise, female geni
tal mutilation benefits men who require it as
a condition of marriage, but it does not bene
tit men who oppose the practice.
It Durning cannot see why anyone would
have a problem with painting men with such
a broad brush, no wonder he is surprised by
feminism's negative image. If anyone made
such broad generalizations about women,
feminists (and probably Durning) would
rightly call it misogyny.
While it is unfair that all of feminism gets
tarred as man-hating, it is not surprising, es
pecially since feminists who don't bash men
tend to be lamentably slow in criticizing fem
inists who do. Durning himself doesn't ac
knowledge the existence of feminists who
may tullill some aspects of the negative
stereotypes of feminism, even to dismiss
these feminists as anomalies. Nor does he ac
knowledge the existence of any reasonable
critiques ot feminism, even to disagree with
them (for him, any criticism of feminism is
due to being "unitiated"). This one
sidedness is exactly the kind of rhet
oric that drives people away from
feminism.
If it was true that men don't rec
ognize that they have unfair advan
tages over women, then Durning
wouldn't have even written his arti
cle.and the entire pro-feminist men's
movement would not exist. He says
that "that the number of men who
fight to build a more gender-equi
table world is shameful." It would be
more accurate to say that the num
ber of people who fight to build a
more gender-equitable world is

shameful. Durning trivializes the
contributions of men against the op
pression of women, and the contri
butions of women to their own op
pression. as if women were passive
pawns of the patriarchy. As usual, it's
all men's fault.
Durning says that people who are
initiated into feminism know that
feminism is about "justice for
women." This is an empty answer:
the word "justice." like the word
"equality," is a concept that virtually
everyone accepts to be a good thing,
but which means different things to
different people. Durning might as
well say that feminists are for every
thing "good." Maybe feminist views
of justice and equality are better in
some way than non-feminist views,
but feminists will not convince any
one of this if they approach the dis

cussion with an attitude that they
hold the One True Way of defining
those terms.
Feminism is a complex move
ment with diverse perspectives
(some of which are unfortunately
negative towards men, and some
which are not). Conventional stereo
types about feminism fail to recog
nize this complexity, hut so does
Durning in his uncritical support of
feminism. Like any other political
movement, feminism contains a full
range of visionaries, zealots, healers,
and bigots. Instead of slamming fem
inists uniformly or devoting myself
to the cause religiously, I try to con
sider their arguments on a case-by
case basis.
