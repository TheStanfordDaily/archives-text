How could anyone have a problem
with feminism?
In his November 6th column proclaiming
feminism as "The new Anti-Imperialism,"
Peter Durning wonders why "an accurate,
positive image of feminism has not grafted it
self onto mainstream America." He is correct
that stereotypes of feminism as "anti-male",
"whiny", a "girls-only club", or a "lesbian
conspiracy" are inaccurate and unfair. Those
stereotypes don't reflect my experience in
Feminist Studies courses at Stanford. Yet al
though the majority of feminists do not
"hate" men, there is a nontrivial minority of
feminists who say things about men that also
sound pretty inaccurate and unfair (see Mary
Daly, Marilyn French, Andrea Dworkin and
Catharine MacKinnon, for a start).
Mary Daly, for instance, wouldn't mind if
most males were wiped from the face of the
planet; in the interview "No Man's Land"
with the WIE Magazine she calls this a
process of "decontamination." Marilyn
French claims in The War Against Women

that "men's need to dominate women may be
based in their own sense of marginality or
emptiness; we do not know its root, and men
are making no effort to discover it" (if you
are a man who protests this statement, you
simply prove that you are making no effort to
discover all the awful things you do to
women). Durning approvingly quotes a
friend of his:"Men benefit from this suffering
[of women), and they don't do anything to
confront it - they usually don't even recog
nize that their unfair advantage is a problem.
[...] I don't think that men, as a whole, even
consider women to be human by their stan
dards." Although there are examples of dis
crimination that simultaneously benefit men
and cause women to suffer, such a broad
claim that men benefit from female suffering
and consider women to be subhuman only
makes sense if you view men as a monolithic
hive-mind without any kind of empathy for
women or interest in their well-being â€” a
view that dehumanizes men. Yes. discrimina
tion against women in the workplace benefits
me as a male worker, but it hurts me as a son

of a working mother. Likewise, female geni
tal mutilation benefits men who require it as
a condition of marriage, but it does not bene
tit men who oppose the practice.
It Durning cannot see why anyone would
have a problem with painting men with such
a broad brush, no wonder he is surprised by
feminism's negative image. If anyone made
such broad generalizations about women,
feminists (and probably Durning) would
rightly call it misogyny.
While it is unfair that all of feminism gets
tarred as man-hating, it is not surprising, es
pecially since feminists who don't bash men
tend to be lamentably slow in criticizing fem
inists who do. Durning himself doesn't ac
knowledge the existence of feminists who
may tullill some aspects of the negative
stereotypes of feminism, even to dismiss
these feminists as anomalies. Nor does he ac
knowledge the existence of any reasonable
critiques ot feminism, even to disagree with
them (for him, any criticism of feminism is
