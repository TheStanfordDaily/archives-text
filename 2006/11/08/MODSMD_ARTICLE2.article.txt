## Democratic wins spur student celebrations, experts temper hopes 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
A tide of dissatisfaction with the presi
dent and the war in Iraq helped give Democ
rats a majority in the House of Representa-

tives, an apparent shot at control of

tne Senate and a strong majori
ty of governor's offices

around the nation. The re
turns, which came late
into the night, seemed to
additionally embolden
campus progressives with
hope that Tuesday's elec
tion was the beginning of
the end of the era of Re-

publican dominance.

As of publication time,
the Democrats appear to

have picked up 24 seats in the

House â€” 15 were needed for a ma-

jority. In the Senate, they gained four
seats, with Senate races in Montana and Vir
ginia showing narrow margins for Democra
tic candidates. If Democrats win both races,
they will control the Senate with a 51-49 ma
jority.
In rooms and lounges around campus,
left-leaning students ushered in the Democ
ratic victory with a celebration befitting New
Years. In the Slavinskii Dom row house, a
contingent of loyal Democrats shotgunned
cheap beers after the networks declared De
mocrats victorious in their quest to take the
House. Champagne bottles were uncorked
as student-revelers screamed heartily from

dorm lounges and group meeting rooms.
"There's a lot to be excited about," said
Bobby Lepore, the president of the Stanford
Democrats. "This will show people that
there are a lot of Americans who care about
progressive values. This will show we're not

dead because we lost a couple nail

biters for a couple of years. Peo-

ple are excited that this can

bring a lot of change in Wash
ington."

Students funneled into
three polling places on and ad
jacent to campus Tuesday,
with several hundred others
casting absentee ballots in
their home states. Campus
Democrat Dorm Captains
tried to pump up turnout by

reaching out to unregistered
voters. Other students worked as

volunteers at polling places.

At election sites, in more than a dozen in-

terviews, the normally apathetic community
expressed excitement about the prospect of
a change in the balance of power.
"Maybe the rest of the country could
look more like California," said Frank Vigil,
happy at the fulfillment of his prediction that
Democrats would regain control of the
House.
Adrian Pavon, 19, cast his first ballot
Tuesday. He said there was a lot of energy
surrounding the election.
"There was a friendly atmosphere
