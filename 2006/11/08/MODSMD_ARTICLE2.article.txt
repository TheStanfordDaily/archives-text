# A 						Sea Change
## Democratic wins spur student celebrations, experts temper hopes 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
A tide of dissatisfaction with the presi
dent and the war in Iraq helped give Democ
rats a majority in the House of Representa-

tives, an apparent shot at control of

tne Senate and a strong majori
ty of governor's offices

around the nation. The re
turns, which came late
into the night, seemed to
additionally embolden
campus progressives with
hope that Tuesday's elec
tion was the beginning of
the end of the era of Re-

publican dominance.

As of publication time,
the Democrats appear to

have picked up 24 seats in the

House — 15 were needed for a ma-

jority. In the Senate, they gained four
seats, with Senate races in Montana and Vir
ginia showing narrow margins for Democra
tic candidates. If Democrats win both races,
they will control the Senate with a 51-49 ma
jority.
In rooms and lounges around campus,
left-leaning students ushered in the Democ
ratic victory with a celebration befitting New
Years. In the Slavinskii Dom row house, a
contingent of loyal Democrats shotgunned
cheap beers after the networks declared De
mocrats victorious in their quest to take the
House. Champagne bottles were uncorked
as student-revelers screamed heartily from

dorm lounges and group meeting rooms.
"There's a lot to be excited about," said
Bobby Lepore, the president of the Stanford
Democrats. "This will show people that
there are a lot of Americans who care about
progressive values. This will show we're not

dead because we lost a couple nail

biters for a couple of years. Peo-

ple are excited that this can

bring a lot of change in Wash
ington."

Students funneled into
three polling places on and ad
jacent to campus Tuesday,
with several hundred others
casting absentee ballots in
their home states. Campus
Democrat Dorm Captains
tried to pump up turnout by

reaching out to unregistered
voters. Other students worked as

volunteers at polling places.

At election sites, in more than a dozen in-

terviews, the normally apathetic community
expressed excitement about the prospect of
a change in the balance of power.
"Maybe the rest of the country could
look more like California," said Frank Vigil,
happy at the fulfillment of his prediction that
Democrats would regain control of the
House.
Adrian Pavon, 19, cast his first ballot
Tuesday. He said there was a lot of energy
surrounding the election.
"There was a friendly atmosphere

around campus," he said. "People
were asking each other about who
they were going to vote for.There was
a lot of interaction."
C'ampus conservatives were quiet
and resigned to the losses across the
nation. Around 10 p.m., a few held
out hope that Republicans could con
trol two of four U.S. Senate seats in
play, with about half a dozen Repub
lican supporters remaining in a
Larkin room where the club had
gathered to watch returns.
"We're obviously disappointed,"
said Megan Reiss.the president of the
Stanford College Republicans. "At
this point in the night, we're still opti
mistic about retaining the Senate."
DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY
WILL BE CONSTRAINED
As results came in,campus leaders
already began thinking about what
the new Democratic House might
look like and what its agenda might
be. In 1994, the Republicans under

Speaker Newt Gingrich embarked
on an aggressive agenda dubbed
'"The Contract with America." With
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco)
poised to become Speaker of the
House, some students expressed high
hopes that the takeover could mean
new policy.
But University experts cautioned
the idealistic to be cautious, warning
that partisan rancor will likely in
crease with divided government.
"It clearly brings to an end this era
of Republican domination, which
means there will be a slowdown in the
ability of the party to accomplish its
policy agendas," said Political Science
and Communications Prof. Jon Kros
nick. "At the same time, unfortunate
ly, there's now going to be an increase
in partisan conflict.
"The Republicans haven't been
used to cooperating and they're now
going to be forced to in this new envi
ronment," he added. "The Democrats
have been really frustrated for quite
some time. 1 suspect they're going to

try to make up for lost time."
Political Science Prof. Larry Dia
mond. a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution and specialist on foreign
policy, predicted that the Democrats
would have more of a psychological
than political impact on the way busi
ness is done in Washington. Congress
has a "very limited number of levers
besides complaint and investigation
to induce a change in our policy," he
said.
"It's extremely unlikely that the
Congress in the next two years is
going to cut off funding or deny the
funding the president says he needs
because it would be seen as betraying
our troops."
Diamond said the change will
force Democrats to adopt a plan for
how to improve the situation in Iraq,
rather than simply criticizing the
president for not doing a good
enough job.
"The Democrats face a bit of a
challenge on whether they can rally
behind some kind of alternative strat

egy," he said. "The president holds
the cards. I very much doubt that the
Democrats will have the nerve and.
some might say, the imprudence to
use the blunt instrument of trying to
deny funding to change our policy."
CALIFORNIA INSULATED
FROM TIDE
Reiss said that the success of Cali
fornia Republicans gave her mem
bers some cause to celebrate. Gover
nor Arnold Schwarzenegger defeat
ed state treasurer Phil Angelides by
over a million votes, leading a tide of
GOP candidates that outperformed
expectations in down-ticket races.
Republican Steve Poizner, a Sili
con Valley billionaire, defeated two
term Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante in
the race for insurance commissioner,
a setback for state Democrats. With
60 percent of precincts reporting.
Democratic Insurance Commission
er John Garamendi took a slim lead
in the race for lieutenant governor
over state Sen. Tom McClintock. an
anti-tax conservative from Thousand
Oaks. Incumbent Secretary of State
Bruce McPherson, a Republican for
mer state legislator appointed by
Schwarzenegger last year, had 47

percent of the vote in a tight race
against Democratic state Sen. Debra
Bowen.
Bill Whalen. a research fellow at
the Hoover Institution who special
izes on identifying political trends,
said Angelides' inability to tire up his
base probably hurt Democratic
turnout and helped Republicans in
the other statewide elections.
"Democrats were not charged by
his candidacy," he said. "They didn t
come out in the numbers you normal
ly expect Democrats to turn out. It
had a much more chilling effect down
the ticket."
Whalen also attributed the insula
tion of California was somewhat in
sulated from the national trend of
Democratic wins to the gerryman
dering of the congressional districts.
One of two California Republi
cans linked to the Jack Abramoff lob
bying scandal was fighting for sur
vival. Rep. Richard Pombo, the chair
man of the House Resources Com
mittee, fell by 9,000 votes to Democ
rat Jerry McNerney. a 53-year-old
wind-energy engineer who holds a
doctorate in mathematics. In con
trast. Republican Rep. John Doolittle
defeated Democrat Charlie Brown, a
retired Air Force officer and decorat-

Ed war veteran.
The reason for the difference,
Whalen said, is that Doolittle's dis
trict has 15 percent more registered
Republicans than Democrats. In the
California 11th District, Pombo's ad
vantage is only six percent.
Lepore of the Stanford Democ
rats said that his members had been
watching Pombos race closely. Envi
ronmental groups had targeted
Pombo, and the Stanford Democrats
committed volunteers to McNer
ney's campaign.
Krosnick cautioned not to read
too much into the meaning of the
shift. He said that there had not been
a gigantic transformation in Ameri
can feelings or attitudes. The nation
remains closely divided politically, he
added.
The newly elected Democrats are
more moderate than the new leader
ship, other observers said.
"A lot of the Democrats elected
tonight are not exactly Bay Area De
mocrats by any means," said Whalen.
"They are in for a culture shock when
they get to Washington and meet with
their caucus for the first time."
