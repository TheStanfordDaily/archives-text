## Antarteb Guharay Poker: gambling or sport? 
### 
The poker craze has finally come
and gone. Or has it?
Three years ago, we all watched in
awe as Chris Moneymaker, the spit
ting image of a stereotypical average
American, walked away from the
World Series of Poker with $2.5 mil
lion in cash as well as the distinction
of having the weirdest last name of
all time. Since then, life has never re
ally been the same.
ESPN started covering no-limit
poker, opening the door for other
"sports" such as paintball to make it
onto the national scene. Home
games became more abundant than
poker color commentator Norm
Chad's painfully obscure jokes. And
the internet became a poker portal
— everyone from tenth graders with
a knack for statistics to grandmoth
ers looking to kill time found their
way to the virtual word of poker.
That was, of course, until Con
gress passed the Safe Port Act, which
includes the stipulation that online
gambling will now be illegal in the
United States. As a result, almost all
the major poker websites have
stopped taking bets from players that
have a permanent address in the US.
Obviously, there are ways to get
around most laws, but by and large,
the online industry has been cut
down.
In banning online poker, the act
throws poker under the general um
brella of gambling. In my opinion,
this is a gross oversight.
Poker is a game that, over a long
period of time, will always reward the
more skilled player. There's a reason
we don't have middle-aged women
playing slots or college students
blowing their tuition money at black
jack tables on spring break on prime
time ESPN. It's because those games,
unlike poker, promote a sense of
pure gambling, where the player has no control
over his or her fate. In poker, the competition is
against the house, rather than a set of live com
petitors. And so, even if you can't accept poker as
a sport, it has to he accepted as a legitimate form
of competition in which talent overrides luck.
Take, for instance, any other sport we watch.
General managers pay athletes directly based
upon their skill level. Consistent,skilled perform
ance leads to a big paycheck, whereas a flounder
ing player with a limited skill set finds himself out
of a job and thus out of money. Any activity that
works on these meritocratic principles deserves
to be separated from the general heading of gam
bling.
So where does that put us today? There is a
giant disconnect between our nation's policy and
interests. Our interest in poker clearly has not di

minished. judging by the high television ratings
across the nation and. on a more local scale, the
frequent late night poker games in Branner
lounge. Yet this new act from Congress flies di
rectly in the face of these interests. The result?
More and more players are finding alternative
ways to deposit onto poker sites, bypassing the
law. Hardly a favorable result.
ITiis isn't to say that the act is completely un
founded — poker can be disastrous for people
that treat it like a game of chance. But that is why
the game of poker must be limited, and not re
stricted. There are tons of ways to do this —
stricter enforcement of the minimum gambling
age, deposit limits, taxes on winnings. Regardless,
it remains a shame that the game of poker, or
rather, the competitive sport of poker is taken
away from the huge numbers of players that un
derstand the game for what it is — a game of wits,
mental endurance and skill that can be perfected
through practice.
