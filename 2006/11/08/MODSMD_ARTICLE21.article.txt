# KEHOE IN CHARGE
## junior setter relishes role as leader for national powerhouse Cardinal 
### ANDREW LOMELi DESK EDITOR 
Bryn Kehoe always knew she
wanted to be a setter.
After being born into a "volley
ball-oriented" family — both her
parents and a brother have played
at the collegiate level — the 2005
All-American fell in love with the
competitiveness and teamwork
that she saw going hand-in-hand
with the sport.
Soon enough,she became infat
uated with the idea of leading a
team's offense.
"1 always wanted to be the set
ter because 1 saw them as the peo
ple in charge," the junior said.
"When 1 was younger I would pray
at night that 1 would be short so
that 1 could be a setter, because
back then all the short players
would be setters."
Kehoe said her lack of strength
prevented her from setting initial
ly, and so she entered her freshman
year of high school as an outside
hitter. But her never-say-die atti
tude. combined with significant
physical training, finally got her to
her dream position. Today, Kehoe
is at the center of one of the na
tion s most potent offenses.
But with the glamour of setting
for the No. 2 Stanford women's
volleyball team comes tremendous
pressure. Kehoe understands the
importance of her role on the
team.
"1 enjoy having the ability to af
fect everyone on the court," she
said. "1 love being under pressure.
No athlete is great until they per
form under pressure — it's those
situations and the big matches that
count the most."

Heading into her sophomore
season, Kehoe had never in her life
missed a practice or game due to
injury. All that changed when she
broke her hand diving for a ball at
practice on Halloween last year.
Kehoe would miss the final seven
games of the Cardinal's regular
season.
"It was very difficult because
I'd never been hurt before," Kehoe
said. "Knowing my limitations was
pretty hard; 1 wanted to be right on
the court the next day, but I obvi
ously trusted my trainers and took
the time to properly rehab."
While it was hard for Kehoe to
watch from the sidelines, the setter
said she still found ways to con
tribute to the team's postseason
run while getting support and en
couragement for her own recov
ery.
"1 learned how to contribute in
other ways, through offering sup
port and enthusiasm," Kehoe said.
"My good friends on the team and
my loving family were really im
portant during that time because
sitting out wasn't fun, and I needed
someone to vent to.There's a lot of
people that care — it's just like
home, another family."
Kehoe's troubles didn't end
once she stepped back on the
court, however. Upon receiving
clearance to play, she was limited
to the back row and was not al
lowed to set the ball.
But even though she wasn't at
her natural position, her return
against Nevada in the first round
of the NCAA Tournament was still
special.
"When 1 came back, I wasn't

Junior setter Bryn Kehoe notches a kill on a tip against Oregon on Oct. 20. Kehoe has already tallied near

100 percent," she said. "But my parents made it
out to my first match back, and they told me I got
a standing applause. It was neat to see there are a
lot of people whi) really care about the team."
Just the next night, however, Kehoe would
face perhaps her most challenging moment at
Stanford. After completing a season that was
"meant to be," the Cardinal dropped a four-game
decision to Santa Clara, ending any hopes for a
national title repeat.
"1 had never seen so many strong people just
weakened," Kehoe said. "It was very emotional.
There was no reason for us to not be successful.
But we all learned a lot from the experience, and
everybody worked hard through the offseason to
improve."
Other than winning the national title in 2004
— when she became the first true freshman to
win the title setting in a one-setter system —

Kehoe's most cherished memories are the expe
riences she shared with her teammates. She looks
especially fondly at the squad's once-in-a-life
time tour of Europe this past summer.
"I love my teammates to death, even though
we're all a little crazy," she said. "One night in
Prague we went inside a 'discoteca' and it was just
the 12 of us and 10 European guys. Although it
was originally scary, the 12 of us just owned the
club. It was crazy. My team is so amazing in that
we can make something out of almost nothing
because it's such a great group of girls."
That team chemistry has been vital for the
Cardinal this season, as the squad has claimed
sole ownership of first place in the Pacific-10
Conference. And while she and her teammates
are focused on this year and bringing a record
seventh national championship to The Farm,
Kehoe has begun to look to the future.
"11 1 wasn't playing volleyball, I'd just be
working hard at something else," she said. "I
hope to continue playing volleyball, and my life
goal is to play in the (Olympics. But 1 have started
to realize that there will be life after volleyball,
which is kind of a scary thought."
