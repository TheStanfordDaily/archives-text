# KEHOE IN CHARGE
## junior setter relishes role as leader for national powerhouse Cardinal 
### ANDREW LOMELi DESK EDITOR 
Bryn Kehoe always knew she
wanted to be a setter.
After being born into a "volley
ball-oriented" family — both her
parents and a brother have played
at the collegiate level — the 2005
All-American fell in love with the
competitiveness and teamwork
that she saw going hand-in-hand
with the sport.
Soon enough,she became infat
uated with the idea of leading a
team's offense.
"1 always wanted to be the set
ter because 1 saw them as the peo
ple in charge," the junior said.
"When 1 was younger I would pray
at night that 1 would be short so
that 1 could be a setter, because
back then all the short players
would be setters."
Kehoe said her lack of strength
prevented her from setting initial
ly, and so she entered her freshman
year of high school as an outside
hitter. But her never-say-die atti
tude. combined with significant
physical training, finally got her to
her dream position. Today, Kehoe
is at the center of one of the na
tion s most potent offenses.
But with the glamour of setting
for the No. 2 Stanford women's
volleyball team comes tremendous
pressure. Kehoe understands the
importance of her role on the
team.
"1 enjoy having the ability to af
fect everyone on the court," she
said. "1 love being under pressure.
No athlete is great until they per
form under pressure — it's those
situations and the big matches that
count the most."

Heading into her sophomore
season, Kehoe had never in her life
missed a practice or game due to
injury. All that changed when she
broke her hand diving for a ball at
practice on Halloween last year.
Kehoe would miss the final seven
games of the Cardinal's regular
season.
"It was very difficult because
I'd never been hurt before," Kehoe
said. "Knowing my limitations was
pretty hard; 1 wanted to be right on
the court the next day, but I obvi
ously trusted my trainers and took
the time to properly rehab."
While it was hard for Kehoe to
watch from the sidelines, the setter
said she still found ways to con
tribute to the team's postseason
run while getting support and en
couragement for her own recov
ery.
"1 learned how to contribute in
other ways, through offering sup
port and enthusiasm," Kehoe said.
"My good friends on the team and
my loving family were really im
portant during that time because
sitting out wasn't fun, and I needed
someone to vent to.There's a lot of
people that care — it's just like
home, another family."
Kehoe's troubles didn't end
once she stepped back on the
court, however. Upon receiving
clearance to play, she was limited
to the back row and was not al
lowed to set the ball.
But even though she wasn't at
her natural position, her return
against Nevada in the first round
of the NCAA Tournament was still
special.
"When 1 came back, I wasn't
