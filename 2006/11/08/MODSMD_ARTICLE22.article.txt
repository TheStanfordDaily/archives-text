### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford wrestling squad re
turned from the Avalon Duals in Ed
inboro, Penn., happy with the strides
they made in winning their first dual
meet of the season against Mercy

hurst of Pennsylvania. But the Car
dinal also realize that improvements
will have to be made in order to im
prove on their 1 -2 start.
"1 think we did alright," sopho
more captain Jared Boyer said. "We
got to see a lot the things we need to
work on, but 1 think it was a good

start at this point. We definitely
know that we need to get a lot bet
ter."
Saturday began positively against
Maryland, as junior Ail-American
Tanner Gardner got Stanford's sea
son started with a pin of James Knox
in 5:19 at 125 pounds. Junior Josh
Zupancic at 157 pounds and true
freshman Zach Giesen, in his colle
giate debut at 184 pounds, also won
matches for the Cardinal. But that
was the end of the good news, as the
Terrapins downed Stanford 27-12.
"We started off the day kind of
flat," coach Kerry McCoy said. "1
don't know if it was because of the
teams we were wrestling. Maryland
isn't one of the best teams in the
country, but it's still one of the teams
outside of the Pac-10 that we don't
see very often. Our guys really
weren't on it."
Hie Cardinal next faced an Edin
boro team McCoy had called "one of
the most underrated in the country"
prior to the match. Though the Car
dinal were soundly defeated by the
score of 30-7, Stanford did manage
two important victories in the event.
Gardner continued his dominance
with a 13-0 major decision and 165-
pound senior Brian Perry earned an
11-8 victory against No. 4 Deonte
Penn.
"Obviously, the biggest bright
spot of the weekend was Brian
Perry," McCoy said. "He beat the
number four guy in the country, and
that was huge for us. It shows that
our guys can compete on the elite
level."
McCoy said Perry's preparation
for (he match and calm demeanor
against a ranked opponent were
keys to his victory.
"[Perry] just made very few mis
takes, and he took advantage of the
mistakes the other guy made," Perry
said. "We scouted [Penn], and we
saw some of his tendencies, so we
knew that if Brian just went out and
wrestled his style that |he had a
chance].The guy came out real fired
up, but Brian just stayed with him
and wrestled hard."
Stanford stepped up as a team in
the third and final match of the day.

Scott Loescher and Brian Perry battle in last week's intra-squad Wrestle-Offs.
At the Avalon Duals, Perry bested the fourth-ranked wrestler in the nation in
what coach Kerry McCoy called the "bright spot of the weekend.
defeating Mercyhurst 28-14. Gardner, Zupancic
and Boyereach pinned his opponent, while Perry
won a major decision 12-2. At 133 pounds, true
freshman Cameron Teitelman earned his first
collegiate win in an 11-4 decision. Boyer said the
performance of some of the team's younger
members, like Teitelman and Giesen, could play
a big role in the team's success this season.
"1 think the young guys did great," Boyer
said."Some of the freshmen put out some of the

best performances of the weekend and they re
ally provided a spark for us as far as battling and
fighting.They did well and they'll continue to do
well."
Next up for the Cardinal is the Bison Open
in Fargo, N. 1)., where McC'oy hopes his team
will benefit from facing more unfamiliar oppo
nents.
"Now is a good time for them to get out there,
spread their wings and see some people," McCoy
said. "Minnesota is the No. 1 ranked team in the
country and they're going to be there,so it will be
a good chance to see some of those guys. But ul
timately it's just a good chance to get some new
competition and not be wrestling the same guys
over and over again."
