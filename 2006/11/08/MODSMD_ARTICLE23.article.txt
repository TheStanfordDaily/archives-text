# FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK
## FIELD GOAL PROTECTION A SAFETY CONCERN 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
When USC blocked a third-quarter Aaron Zagory
field goal attempt in Saturday's 42-0 win over the Car
dinal, there may have been more going on than met the
eye. During Walt Harris's weekly press conference on
Tuesday, the coach reported that five Stanford players
were injured on the play.
I larris claimed that the main breakdown on the play
was the four-man USC rush up the middle overwhelm
ing the two-man Stanford protection unit.
"It was a combination of one of our guys not doing
what he was supposed to do and the power and the
strength of the push," I larris said. "We're going to have
to do something about that because it becomes a safety
issue. We call it the 'middle push.' You have four bodies
pushing on two bodies and it is really dangerous."
Of the live Stanford injuries on the play, some oc
curred on the 71-yard touchdown return by Terrell
Thomas, but Harris emphasized that the danger of the
"middle push" is a real concern.
"One of the great things about college football is
that they do a great job of removing the most dangerous

parts of the game," Harris said. "We're going to try to do
something about it from our perspective. There are
other teams that are having the same safety and health
issues that we are. We do it too,since it's in the rules. But
the rules committee is going to have to do something to
keep the game as safe as possible."
Regardless of whether the play is unsafe or not, Stan
ford is working to figure out how to prevent opponents
from blocking kicks in the future. The Cardinal have
had a number of field goals and punts blocked through
out the season.
Harris did not disclose which players were injured
on the play nor whether they would be healthy enough
to play this weekend against Washington.
Cardinal prepare for wet conditions
I lusky Stadium is never an easy place to play, but this
weekend may provide an especially difficult challenge.
Seattle has endured a serious rainstorm over the last
few days and the foul weather is expected to continue
throughout the weekend.The forecast calls for rain Fri
day and Saturday with high temperatures in the mid
40s.
"We're going to run a wet ball drill to prepare and
work on the center-quarterback exchange," Harris said.
"Messing up the exchange is a great way to lose a
game.
Luckily, Husky Stadium features turf rather
than natural grass, providing better footing in the
rain.
"Just because you practice in it, that doesn't
mean that you are going to be air-tight in the sit
uation," Harris said. "It takes an understanding
of details and discipline to get it right [in wet con
ditions]."
Harris has also pumped simulated crowd
noise into the practice field throughout the week
in order to prepare his team for the very loud
Washington crowd.
"We need to focus on our quarterback's

voice," 1 larris said. "We had some illegal proce
dure penalties last week, which is really uncalled
for this far into the season. We're just going to try
to do the best we can."
Huskies without Stanback
Against the Cardinal. Washington will be
without senior quarterback Isaiah Stanback for
the third consecutive game after his season-end
ing foot surgery on Oct. 17. Junior Carl Bonnell is
expected to start under center for the Huskies.
However. Bonnell suffered an injury two
weeks ago against Arizona State and was re
placed by third-string quarterback Jonny
Dußocher. In last week's game against Oregon,
though. Bonnell was back and took every snap
for the Huskies.
In 10 games this season, Bonnell has passed
for 527 yards and five touchdowns with eight in
terceptions.
