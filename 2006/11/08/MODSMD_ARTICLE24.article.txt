## Second half salvages opener Stanford rides 35-5 run to victory over British Columbia in exhibition 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Judging from last night's 79-59 exhibition win over
underrated British Columbia, Stanford men's basket
ball may not have the prettiest season, but they certain
ly have the potential to surprise the opposition.
After an ugly first half of just 33 percent (10-of-30)
shooting, the Cardinal finally found their range to pull
away from the undermanned Thunderbirds (4-0) in the
second. Down 31-28 one minute out of the break. Stan
ford went on a 10-minute 35-5 spurt to build a 63-36
edge.
"The shots didn't go down for us in the first, but I
thought defensively we did a good job," head coach
Trent Johnson said."To start the second, the ball started
to drop."
Indeed, the Cardinal shot 61 percent (19-of-31) in
the second half and 48 percent(29-of-61) overall for the
easy victory. Sophomore forward Lawrence Hill (5-of
-11. eight rebounds) paced Stanford with 18 points, with

senior forward Fred Washington (6-of-8) kicking in 15
and freshman forward Will Paul (5-of-9, five rebounds)
adding 12.
A young Cardinal squad took the court in front of a
sea of red with a packed student section but plenty of
empty chairs elsewhere. Sophomores Mitch Johnson
and Anthony Goods, Washington, Hill and freshman
Robin Lopez started at point guard, shooting guard,
small forward, power forward and center, respectively.
Within the first five minutes of the contest, freshman
forward Landry Fields replaced Washington, for a line
up entirely made up of underclassmen. Further high
lighting the team's youth, none of the Cardinal's re
turnees averaged over five points per game last season.
Whistles were almost constant, with 47 fouls called in
the game, including a questionable fifth foul on Robin
Lopez on a charge with 9:13 to go. Because of the fouls,
Robin Lopez played only 11 minutes, and with twin
brother Brook out with an injured back until Decem
ber, fans received only a passing glance at the most high
ly-touted recruits to ever sign with Stanford.
"I need to work on my positioning both offensively
and defensively," Robin Lopez said of his first outing. "It
was a fun experience."
