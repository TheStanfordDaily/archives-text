## Second half salvages opener Stanford rides 35-5 run to victory over British Columbia in exhibition 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Judging from last night's 79-59 exhibition win over
underrated British Columbia, Stanford men's basket
ball may not have the prettiest season, but they certain
ly have the potential to surprise the opposition.
After an ugly first half of just 33 percent (10-of-30)
shooting, the Cardinal finally found their range to pull
away from the undermanned Thunderbirds (4-0) in the
second. Down 31-28 one minute out of the break. Stan
ford went on a 10-minute 35-5 spurt to build a 63-36
edge.
"The shots didn't go down for us in the first, but I
thought defensively we did a good job," head coach
Trent Johnson said."To start the second, the ball started
to drop."
Indeed, the Cardinal shot 61 percent (19-of-31) in
the second half and 48 percent(29-of-61) overall for the
easy victory. Sophomore forward Lawrence Hill (5-of
-11. eight rebounds) paced Stanford with 18 points, with

senior forward Fred Washington (6-of-8) kicking in 15
and freshman forward Will Paul (5-of-9, five rebounds)
adding 12.
A young Cardinal squad took the court in front of a
sea of red with a packed student section but plenty of
empty chairs elsewhere. Sophomores Mitch Johnson
and Anthony Goods, Washington, Hill and freshman
Robin Lopez started at point guard, shooting guard,
small forward, power forward and center, respectively.
Within the first five minutes of the contest, freshman
forward Landry Fields replaced Washington, for a line
up entirely made up of underclassmen. Further high
lighting the team's youth, none of the Cardinal's re
turnees averaged over five points per game last season.
Whistles were almost constant, with 47 fouls called in
the game, including a questionable fifth foul on Robin
Lopez on a charge with 9:13 to go. Because of the fouls,
Robin Lopez played only 11 minutes, and with twin
brother Brook out with an injured back until Decem
ber, fans received only a passing glance at the most high
ly-touted recruits to ever sign with Stanford.
"I need to work on my positioning both offensively
and defensively," Robin Lopez said of his first outing. "It
was a fun experience."
Junior center Peter Prowitt was on
the sideline with an injured knee and will
be out for at least another two weeks.
After the game, Johnson was as
pleased as he has been after any contest
in the past few years, repeatedly praising
the team's intensity and execution. He
said offensive ball control and on-the
ball defense were areas for improve
ment. but added that such problems are
a natural byproduct of passionate play
and are easily correctable.
"We got a chance to play a lot of
guys," Johnson said. "It's nice to come

out of a hotly-contested game with
healthy bodies."
Similarly upbeat, the players took
special pride in their defense.
"If we're going to go anywhere this
year, it's going to be on the defensive
end." Washington said. "We need |jun
ior)Taj [Finger] and the older guys to set
the tone for us defensively, or else we're
going to repeat what happened last year.
But if we keep that defensive intensity
up all year, there's no limit to what we
can do."
British Columbia is one of Canada's

best teams. They won 33 games last sea
son with a perfect 20-0 conference
record and were ranked as high as sec
ond in the country.This year, they played
No. 10 Arizona tough in a preseason ex
hibition, falling by just 11 points.
Last night, however, was far from the
Thunderbirds' best game. The squad
committed an incredible 30 turnovers, 17
of them with the game very much within
reach in the first half. Star guard Casey
Archibald finished just 2-of-10. and the
team shot just 39% (16-of-41) on the
night.
