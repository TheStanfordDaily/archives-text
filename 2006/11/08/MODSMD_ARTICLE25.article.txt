## Wager is national champ 
### BY REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
For the first time since 1963, a Stanford sailor
is national champion. At this weekend's Inter
collegiate Sailing Association/Vanguard Men's
Singlehanded National Championships in
Rhode Island, Stanford senior Emery Wager
beat out a field of elite competitors to take the
title.

After finishing ninth two years ago and fifth
last year, Wager finally found himself at the top of
the podium. Sitting in seventh heading into the
final day of competition, Wager finished strong
with what head coach Jay Kehoe called in a press
release "a phenomenal second day."
Two sailors represented Stanford in the
women's championship. Junior Evan Brown took
fifth overall — up from seventh in 2005 — with
senior Caroline Young finishing in 15th.
