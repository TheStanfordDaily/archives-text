## IN MEMORY In loss, a hope for the future Students, faculty and staff contribute to McGlothlin fund 
### ADA YEE STAFF WRITER 
Nov. 16 marks exactly one year since the
death of Stanford's first casualty in Iraq — Lt.
Ryan McGlothlin, a graduate student in
chemistry. After he was killed in action, his
family established a memorial scholarship
fund that has drawn contributions from Stan
ford as well as from McGlothlin's neighbors in
his hometown of Lebanon, Virginia and
friends from his undergraduate days at the
College of William and Mary.
McGlothlin's parents, Donald and Ruth,
created the Ryan McGlothlin Scholarship
Fund to honor their son, who entered Stan
ford in 2(H) 1 as a doctoral candidate in chem
istry. A $ 1 ,(KK) scholarship will be given each
year to a high school senior who demonstrates
the values of honor, integrity and persever

ance that Ryan embodied, friends and family
say. The first recipient — to be selected
through an application process next May by
the McGlothlin family and his former football
coach — will be from Lebanon High School
(LHS), which McGlothlin attended.
"Ryan loved growing up in Southwest Vir
ginia, exploring the woods and mountains
with his brothers," his mother, Ruth, said.
"When his buddies from William and Mary
and Stanford came here for Ryan's funeral,
they asked to see the locations of some of the
crazy stories Ryan told about his childhood.
That's why we will start locally and grow from
there. The reach of the scholarship will, we
hope, grow as the funds grow," she said.
For the time being, the scholarship fund is
being administered by LHS, where Ruth Mc-
Glothlin is a guidance counselor. However,
the McGlothlins have applied to create a
foundation which will fund the scholarship in
future years. The fund currently contains
$60.(XK). donated in part by members of Ryan
McGlothlin's communities both in Virginia
and here at Stanford.

Students, faculty and staff alike con
tributed to the effort.
"1 was really touched by how students in
the chemistry department were very generous
in giving to the scholarship fund," said Roger
kuhn. student services manager for the chem
istry department, "liven students new to the
program who had never met Ryan were very
generous."
Kuhn accepted an invitation by Ryan Mc-
Glothlin's friends from William and Mary to
run in the U.S. Marine Corps Marathon, held
on Oct. 29, both to raise money for the fund
and to honor McGlothlin's memory. The race,
which stretches 2b.2 miles and ends in Arling
ton National Cemetery, was Kuhn's first.
"We raised a lot of money, but the
marathon was mostly about remembering
Ryan." Kuhn said. "There was a reception Sat
urday with several family members, and
everyone was sharing stories about what kind
of person he was. It was a very moving part of
a very moving weekend — running past so
many national monuments and past the Pen
tagon."
Prof. Richard Zare. chair of the chemistry
department, also contributed to the fund. Mc-
Glothlin joined Zare's research group in 2002
and worked in collaboration with Civil Engi
neering Prof. Dick Luthy and members of the
Luthy lab.
"I lis research with us helped explain how

certain organic contaminants may be taken up
by carbonaceous material in soils and sedi
ments" Luthy explained. "That information
leads to improved estimates of environmental
risk and supports studies on innovative treat
ment strategies to deal with contaminants in
place."
"Ryan was truly a team player, working
hard on a collaborative research project that
involved three laboratories, two here at Stan
ford and one in Greece," Luthy added. "Ryan
was working with us literally up to the mo
ment he left to join the Marines. His sense of
duty carried over to our joint project, making
sure that his contribution was complete be
fore he left for the Marines."
Though well on his way towards a doctoral
degree, McGlothlin — who was involved with
Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps
(ROTC) as an undergraduate — instead
opted to complete a master's degree and enlist
in the Marine Corps.
"Most of my lab and 1 tried to convince
Ryan to stay in graduate school, arguing that
he would do more for our country that way.
but Ryan always wanted to be a Marine and
he felt strongly that the country needed him as
a Marine officer," Zare said.
Ryan McGlothlin, who was a Marine Sec
ond Lieutenant, was killed during a firefight in
Übaydi, Iraq, near the Syrian border. His story
was heard across the nation last vear, when

President George W. Bush used it to end the
last of a series of speeches defending U.S.
strategy in Iraq.
"Ryan was a bright young man who had
everything going for him, and he always want
ed to serve our nation." Bush said in the Dec.
14 speech.
McGlothlin's colleagues at Stanford re
member the same, and more.
"Ryan had a wonderful smile that lit up the
room." Kuhn said. "He was a warm and caring
person, very humble and a little shy."
Several months ago. Kuhn and two of Ryan
McGlothlin's fellow graduate students put up
a temporary memorial under a tree in front of
Braun Auditorium.
"We put up the cross in memorial of
Ryan." said Marion Martin, a graduate stu
dent in chemistry and Ryan McCJlothlin's
closest friend at Stanford. "Anothei student,
E. Ray Watts, actually started as a Marine be
fore he came to Stanford, so in honor of a fel
low Marine.he built a white cross. Roger Kuhn
supplied the picture, and there was also a Ma
rine pendant."
"After Ryan became a Marine, we went to
go hang out with him at Camp Pendleton,
and you could tell he was really, really excit
ed about being a Marine." Martin said. "It
makes me a little bit easier about what hap
pened. knowing that he was doing what he
wanted to do."

which stretches 2b.2 miles and ends in Arling
ton National Cemetery, was Kuhn's first.
"We raised a lot of money, but the
marathon was mostly about remembering
Ryan." Kuhn said. "There was a reception Sat
urday with several family members, and
everyone was sharing stories about what kind
of person he was. It was a very moving part of
a very moving weekend — running past so
many national monuments and past the Pen
tagon."
Prof. Richard Zare. chair of the chemistry
department, also contributed to the fund. Mc-
Glothlin joined Zare's research group in 2002
and worked in collaboration with Civil Engi
neering Prof. Dick Luthy and members of the
Luthy lab.
"I lis research with us helped explain how

certain organic contaminants may be taken up
by carbonaceous material in soils and sedi
ments" Luthy explained. "That information
leads to improved estimates of environmental
risk and supports studies on innovative treat
ment strategies to deal with contaminants in
place."
"Ryan was truly a team player, working
hard on a collaborative research project that
involved three laboratories, two here at Stan
ford and one in Greece," Luthy added. "Ryan
was working with us literally up to the mo
ment he left to join the Marines. His sense of
duty carried over to our joint project, making
sure that his contribution was complete be
fore he left for the Marines."
Though well on his way towards a doctoral
degree, McGlothlin — who was involved with
Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps
(ROTC) as an undergraduate — instead
opted to complete a master's degree and enlist
in the Marine Corps.
"Most of my lab and 1 tried to convince
Ryan to stay in graduate school, arguing that
he would do more for our country that way.
but Ryan always wanted to be a Marine and
he felt strongly that the country needed him as
a Marine officer," Zare said.
Ryan McGlothlin, who was a Marine Sec
ond Lieutenant, was killed during a firefight in
Übaydi, Iraq, near the Syrian border. His story
was heard across the nation last vear, when

President George W. Bush used it to end the
last of a series of speeches defending U.S.
strategy in Iraq.
"Ryan was a bright young man who had
everything going for him, and he always want
ed to serve our nation." Bush said in the Dec.
14 speech.
McGlothlin's colleagues at Stanford re
member the same, and more.
"Ryan had a wonderful smile that lit up the
room." Kuhn said. "He was a warm and caring
person, very humble and a little shy."
Several months ago. Kuhn and two of Ryan
McGlothlin's fellow graduate students put up
a temporary memorial under a tree in front of
Braun Auditorium.
"We put up the cross in memorial of
Ryan." said Marion Martin, a graduate stu
dent in chemistry and Ryan McCJlothlin's
closest friend at Stanford. "Anothei student,
E. Ray Watts, actually started as a Marine be
fore he came to Stanford, so in honor of a fel
low Marine.he built a white cross. Roger Kuhn
supplied the picture, and there was also a Ma
rine pendant."
"After Ryan became a Marine, we went to
go hang out with him at Camp Pendleton,
and you could tell he was really, really excit
ed about being a Marine." Martin said. "It
makes me a little bit easier about what hap
pened. knowing that he was doing what he
wanted to do."
Nov. 16 marks exactly one year since the
death of Stanford's first casualty in Iraq — Lt.
Ryan McGlothlin, a graduate student in
chemistry. After he was killed in action, his
family established a memorial scholarship
fund that has drawn contributions from Stan
ford as well as from McGlothlin's neighbors in
his hometown of Lebanon, Virginia and
friends from his undergraduate days at the
College of William and Mary.
McGlothlin's parents, Donald and Ruth,
created the Ryan McGlothlin Scholarship
Fund to honor their son, who entered Stan
ford in 2(H) 1 as a doctoral candidate in chem
istry. A $ 1 ,(KK) scholarship will be given each
year to a high school senior who demonstrates
the values of honor, integrity and persever

ance that Ryan embodied, friends and family
say. The first recipient — to be selected
through an application process next May by
the McGlothlin family and his former football
coach — will be from Lebanon High School
(LHS), which McGlothlin attended.
"Ryan loved growing up in Southwest Vir
ginia, exploring the woods and mountains
with his brothers," his mother, Ruth, said.
"When his buddies from William and Mary
and Stanford came here for Ryan's funeral,
they asked to see the locations of some of the
crazy stories Ryan told about his childhood.
That's why we will start locally and grow from
there. The reach of the scholarship will, we
hope, grow as the funds grow," she said.
For the time being, the scholarship fund is
being administered by LHS, where Ruth Mc-
Glothlin is a guidance counselor. However,
the McGlothlins have applied to create a
foundation which will fund the scholarship in
future years. The fund currently contains
$60.(XK). donated in part by members of Ryan
McGlothlin's communities both in Virginia
and here at Stanford.

Students, faculty and staff alike con
tributed to the effort.
"1 was really touched by how students in
the chemistry department were very generous
in giving to the scholarship fund," said Roger
kuhn. student services manager for the chem
istry department, "liven students new to the
program who had never met Ryan were very
generous."
Kuhn accepted an invitation by Ryan Mc-
Glothlin's friends from William and Mary to
run in the U.S. Marine Corps Marathon, held
on Oct. 29, both to raise money for the fund
and to honor McGlothlin's memory. The race,
which stretches 2b.2 miles and ends in Arling
ton National Cemetery, was Kuhn's first.
