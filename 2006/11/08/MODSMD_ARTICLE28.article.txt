## ASSU hears reasoning behind the Bike Ban 
### CHRISTIAN TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I don't want to wait for some
one to break their arm before I do
what is the right thing and take
preventative steps." Chief of Po
lice Laura Wilson told the ASSU
Undergraduate Genate last night.
She was referencing the imple
mentation of the Pedestrian Zone,
known to many students simply as
"The Bike Ban."
Representatives from Parking
and Transportation Services
(P&TS) spoke with the Senate
Tuesday, joined by Wilson and
Stephanie Kalfayan, the Vice
Provost for Academic Affairs.
Kalfayan explained the impe
tus for the Pedestrian Zone came
nearly two years ago. when she saw
a startling melange of bicyclists,
pedestrians and delivery trucks all
converging on Lasuen Mall.
"We had no clear guidelines for
who should be where," she said.
Brodie Hamilton, director of
P&TS, presented a series of fifteen
images taken before the Pedestrian
Zone was implemented. Included
were slides of FedEx trucks parked
in streets shared with bicyclists and
pedestrians. Qther pictures showed
bikes left in front of doors in the
Main Quad, blocking handicapped
access buttons while bike racks lin
gered just around the comer.
The goals of the bike ban were
numerous, said Bill Larson, super
visor for the police for the Pedes
trian Zone. He cited "safety, aes
thetics, keeping everybody safe
and keeping traffic moving."
Both Hamilton and Larson
praised students for their high lev
els of compliance with the ban,
saying P&TS has received "lots of
positive feedback."
"Every one is responding really
really well," added Hamilton.
While police are writing cita
tions for motor vehicles in violation
of the Pedestrian Zone, there are
no immediate plans for issuing cita
tions to students who disobey the
bicycle rule, according to Larson.
Visibility — difficult in the

Main Quad owing to blind corners
and building doors without win
dows — has been cited as one of
the main reasons for the bike ban
in the arcades.
Despite her push for greater safe
ty. Wilson said she could not immedi
ately provide statistics on where
most bike accidents occur — in cov
ered arcades or in places unaffected
by the Pedestrian Zone. She noted
police statistics are less than perfect
because many bicycle accidents are
never reported to the police.
Despite the controversy regarding
the ban, ASSU officials admitted that
safety in the Quad has improved.
"When I'm walking, it's nice to
know I am not going to be de
stroyed by someone coming
through the arcades," said Senate
Chair Hershey Avula. a junior.
Students accepted some blame.
"It's our fault," said sophomore
Senator Nkemjika Ugonabo, re
ferring to upperclassmen who set
an unsafe example for new stu
dents by bicycling while using a
cell phone or listening to music —
both of which are illegal.
Looking ahead, more changes are
in store for the Quad as P&TS plans
to continue improving efficiency and
safety at the campus's center.
Changes to the areas around the
Quad will include the installation of
new pneumatic bollards and the ad
dition of approximately 500 bicycle
parking spaces. According to Hamil
ton. 100 have already been installed
since the start of the bike ban.
"Some say 'you're talking my
civil liberties,'" said Hamilton, ref
erencing a segment of the student
population which has denounced
the ban. "But our feeling was that
this was definitely a safety issue
and we needed to respond."
While police are writing citations
for vehicles in violation of the
Pedestrian Zone. Larson said there
are no immediate plans to issue cita
tions to students who disobey the
bicycle rule, beyond the notice cur
rently stapled to bicycles.
"We just want to make campus
safer for everybody," Kalfayan
said.
