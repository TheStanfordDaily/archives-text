# MIDTERM ELECTION
## Dems plan for a new direction Shift in House certain, while Senate results in limbo for Montana and Virginia 
### DAVID ESPO ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — Resurgent Democrats
won control of the 1 louse and challenged the
Republicans' grip on the Senate in midterm
elections early Wednesday, riding a powerful
wave of public anger over the war in Iraq and
scandal at home.
"Mr. President, we need a new direction in
Iraq," said House Democratic leader Nancy
Pelosi, celebrating her party's return to power
— and her own ascension as first female
speaker in history.
Aided by public dissatisfaction with Presi
dent Bush, Democrats won gubernatorial
races in New York. Ohio and Massachusetts
for the first time in more than a decade, then
put Colorado, Maryland and Arkansas in their
column as well.
At 3 a.m. in the East, Democrats had won
more than two dozen House seats held by
Republicans, more than enough to guaran
tee a return to power after 12 years in the
minority. Several GOP officials said they
expected Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-IlLto
step down as party leader and possibly
even retire from Congress.
Democratic challengers defeated Republi
cs incumbents to win Senate seats in Pennsyl
vania, Ohio. Rhode Island and Missouri.
Ihat left control of the Senate up in the air,
pending the outcome of races in Montana and
Virginia. Sens. Conrad Bums and George Allen
both trailed, and Democrats needed to win both
races to emerge with a majority.
Bush monitored the returns from the
White House as the voters picked a new
Congress certain to complicate his final
two years in office. He arranged to call
Pelosi on Wednesday morning, then hold
an afternoon news conference.
"They have not gone the way he would
have liked," press secretary Tony Snow said
of the election returns.
More than the party-run battle for control of
Congress and the statehouses were at stake.
South Dakota voters rejected the
toughest abortion law in the land — a
measure that would have outlawed the
procedure except when needed to save the
life of the mother.
In a comeback unlike any other, Sen.
Joe Lieberman won a new term in Con
necticut — dispatching Democrat Ned La
mont and thus winning when it counted
most against the man who had prevailed in
a summertime primary. Lieberman, a sup
porter of Bush's war policy, ran as an inde
pendent. but will side with the Democrats
when he returns to Washington.
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton coasted to
a second Democratic term in New York,
winning roughly two-thirds of the vote in a
warm-up for a possible run for the White
House in 2008. Charlie Crist was a rare
bright spot for Republicans, winning the
Florida governorship now held by the pres
ident's brother Jeb. GOP Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger won a new term in Cali
fornia. the nation's most populous state.
But that was cold comfort for the Re
publicans, who have controlled the White
House and both houses of Congress for
most of the time since Bush took office and
used their majority to pass large tax cuts
and back the war in Iraq.
Democrats defeated Republican Sens.
Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania, Mike
DeWine in Ohio, Jim Talent in Missouri
and Lincoln Chafee in Rhode Island _ four
lawmakers who covered the spectrum from
conservative to moderate.
But they came up short in Tennessee as
Republican Bob Corker won a hotly con
tested race,defeating Rep. I iarold Ford. Jr.,
who had hoped to become the first South
ern black senator since Reconstruction.
Bums, seeking a fourth term, trailed Demo
crat Jon Tester. Allen trailed his Democratic
challenger, Jim Webb, by a few thousand votes,
with a strong likelihood of a recount.
Indiana was particularly cruel to House
Republicans. Reps. John Hostettler. Chris
Chocola and Mike Sodrel all lost in a state
where Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels' un
popularity compounded the dissatisfaction

with Bush.
Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson lost in
her bid for a 13th term in Connecticut;
Anne Northup fell in Kentucky after 10
years in the House: Rep. Charles Taylor
was defeated in North Carolina.
One of the biggest surprises of the night
was Republican Rep. Jim Leach's defeat in
lowa after a career that spanned 30 years.
He lost to Dave Loebsack, a college profes
sor making his first run for elective office.
The two parties spent lavishly on television
commercials in dozens of districts deemed
competitive — but not that one.
Scandal took an undeniable toll on the
Republicans. Democrat Zack Space won
the race to succeed Bob Ney, who pleaded
guilty to corruption this fall in the Jack
Abramoff scandal. Republican Rep. John
Sweeney lost his seat in New York several
days after reports that he had roughed up
his wife — an allegation she denied. Re
publicans also lost the seat that Rep. Mark
Foley had held. He resigned on Sept. 29
after being confronted with sexually explic
it computer messages he had written to
teenage pages.
Rep. Don Sherwood lost despite apolo
gizing to the voters for a long-term affair
with a much younger woman; and Rep.
Curt Weldon, also from Pennsylvania, was
denied a new term after he became em
broiled in a corruption investigation.
J Tie GOP also lost the Texas seat once held
by former Majority Leader Tom DeLay.
Surveys of voters suggested Democrats were
winning the support of independents with al
most 60 percent support, and middle-class vot
ers were leaving Republicans behind.

About six in 10 voters said they disapproved
of the way Bush is handling his job. that the na
tion is on the wrong traek and that they oppose
the war in Iraq. Voters in all groups were more
inclined to vote for Democratic candidates than
for Republicans.
Over half of the voters registered dissat
isfaction with the way Republican leaders
in Congress dealt with Foley. They voted
overwhelming Democratic in House races,
by a margin of 3-to-l.
The surveys also suggested Democrats
were winning the support of independents
with almost 60 percent support, and mid
dle-class voters were leaving Republicans
behind. The surveys were taken by The As
sociated Press and the networks.
History worked against the GOP. too.
Since World War 11, the party in control ot
the White House has lost an average 31
House seats and six Senate seats in the sec
ond midterm election of a president's
tenure in office.
Santorum became the first Republican
senator to fall to the Democrats, losing his
seat after two conservative terms to Bob
Casey Jr., the state treasurer.
In Ohio, DeWine lost to Rep. Sherrod
Brown, a liberal seven-term lawmaker.
Chafee, the most liberal Republican in the
Senate and an opponent of the war. fell not
long afterward to Sheldon Whitehouse, for
mer state attorney general. Claire Mc-
Caskill, state auditor, defeated Talent in
Missouri.
"It's very hard to watch," lamented Dick
Armey, who was House majority leader
when the GOP gained power a dozen years
ago.

Anne Northup fell in Kentucky after 10
years in the House: Rep. Charles Taylor
was defeated in North Carolina.
One of the biggest surprises of the night
was Republican Rep. Jim Leach's defeat in
lowa after a career that spanned 30 years.
He lost to Dave Loebsack, a college profes
sor making his first run for elective office.
The two parties spent lavishly on television
commercials in dozens of districts deemed
competitive — but not that one.
Scandal took an undeniable toll on the
Republicans. Democrat Zack Space won
the race to succeed Bob Ney, who pleaded
guilty to corruption this fall in the Jack
Abramoff scandal. Republican Rep. John
Sweeney lost his seat in New York several
days after reports that he had roughed up
his wife — an allegation she denied. Re

Foley had held. He resigned on Sept. 29
after being confronted with sexually explic
it computer messages he had written to
teenage pages.
Rep. Don Sherwood lost despite apolo
gizing to the voters for a long-term affair
with a much younger woman; and Rep.
Curt Weldon, also from Pennsylvania, was
denied a new term after he became em
broiled in a corruption investigation.
J Tie GOP also lost the Texas seat once held
by former Majority Leader Tom DeLay.
Surveys of voters suggested Democrats were
winning the support of independents with al
most 60 percent support, and middle-class vot
ers were leaving Republicans behind.

About six in 10 voters said they disapproved
of the way Bush is handling his job. that the na
tion is on the wrong traek and that they oppose
the war in Iraq. Voters in all groups were more
inclined to vote for Democratic candidates than
for Republicans.
Over half of the voters registered dissat
isfaction with the way Republican leaders
in Congress dealt with Foley. They voted
overwhelming Democratic in House races,
by a margin of 3-to-l.
The surveys also suggested Democrats
were winning the support of independents
with almost 60 percent support, and mid
dle-class voters were leaving Republicans
behind. The surveys were taken by The As

History worked against the GOP. too.
Since World War 11, the party in control ot
the White House has lost an average 31
House seats and six Senate seats in the sec
ond midterm election of a president's
tenure in office.
Santorum became the first Republican

seat after two conservative terms to Bob
Casey Jr., the state treasurer.
In Ohio, DeWine lost to Rep. Sherrod
Brown, a liberal seven-term lawmaker.
Chafee, the most liberal Republican in the
Senate and an opponent of the war. fell not

WASHINGTON — Resurgent Democrats
won control of the 1 louse and challenged the
Republicans' grip on the Senate in midterm
elections early Wednesday, riding a powerful
wave of public anger over the war in Iraq and
scandal at home.
"Mr. President, we need a new direction in
Iraq," said House Democratic leader Nancy
Pelosi, celebrating her party's return to power
— and her own ascension as first female
speaker in history.
Aided by public dissatisfaction with Presi
dent Bush, Democrats won gubernatorial
races in New York. Ohio and Massachusetts
for the first time in more than a decade, then
put Colorado, Maryland and Arkansas in their
column as well.
At 3 a.m. in the East, Democrats had won
more than two dozen House seats held by
Republicans, more than enough to guaran
tee a return to power after 12 years in the
minority. Several GOP officials said they
expected Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-IlLto
step down as party leader and possibly
even retire from Congress.
Democratic challengers defeated Republi
cs incumbents to win Senate seats in Pennsyl
vania, Ohio. Rhode Island and Missouri.
Ihat left control of the Senate up in the air,
pending the outcome of races in Montana and
Virginia. Sens. Conrad Bums and George Allen
both trailed, and Democrats needed to win both
races to emerge with a majority.
Bush monitored the returns from the
White House as the voters picked a new
Congress certain to complicate his final
two years in office. He arranged to call
Pelosi on Wednesday morning, then hold
an afternoon news conference.
"They have not gone the way he would
have liked," press secretary Tony Snow said
of the election returns.
More than the party-run battle for control of
Congress and the statehouses were at stake.
South Dakota voters rejected the
toughest abortion law in the land — a
measure that would have outlawed the
procedure except when needed to save the
life of the mother.
In a comeback unlike any other, Sen.
Joe Lieberman won a new term in Con
necticut — dispatching Democrat Ned La
mont and thus winning when it counted
most against the man who had prevailed in
a summertime primary. Lieberman, a sup
porter of Bush's war policy, ran as an inde
pendent. but will side with the Democrats
when he returns to Washington.
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton coasted to
a second Democratic term in New York,
winning roughly two-thirds of the vote in a
warm-up for a possible run for the White
House in 2008. Charlie Crist was a rare
bright spot for Republicans, winning the
Florida governorship now held by the pres
ident's brother Jeb. GOP Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger won a new term in Cali
fornia. the nation's most populous state.
But that was cold comfort for the Re
publicans, who have controlled the White
House and both houses of Congress for
most of the time since Bush took office and
used their majority to pass large tax cuts
and back the war in Iraq.
Democrats defeated Republican Sens.
Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania, Mike
DeWine in Ohio, Jim Talent in Missouri
and Lincoln Chafee in Rhode Island _ four
lawmakers who covered the spectrum from
conservative to moderate.
But they came up short in Tennessee as
Republican Bob Corker won a hotly con
tested race,defeating Rep. I iarold Ford. Jr.,
who had hoped to become the first South
ern black senator since Reconstruction.
Bums, seeking a fourth term, trailed Demo
crat Jon Tester. Allen trailed his Democratic
challenger, Jim Webb, by a few thousand votes,
with a strong likelihood of a recount.
Indiana was particularly cruel to House
Republicans. Reps. John Hostettler. Chris
Chocola and Mike Sodrel all lost in a state
where Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels' un
popularity compounded the dissatisfaction

with Bush.
Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson lost in
her bid for a 13th term in Connecticut;
Anne Northup fell in Kentucky after 10
years in the House: Rep. Charles Taylor
