# Parental notice measure fails
## Prop. 85 galvanizes campus Democrats, pro-choice groups celebrate victories 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Seizing on the defeat of Proposition 85, campus pro-choice
leaders declared yesterday's election a victory for women's rights.
California voters rejected the measure, which would have re
quired a doctor to notify parents or guardians of minors seeking
an abortion,by an almost 10-point margin. At press time, the mar
gin was 54-46 with 84 percent of precincts reporting.
"I'm glad that California remains a proud, pro-choice state,"
said junior Mishan Araujo, co-president of Stanford Students for
Choice. "It's comforting that when [the right to choose is] put to
a test, people respond in a good way."
Noelle Patno, a member of Feminists for Life of America and
Stanford Students for Life, held out hope late into the night that
the measure could still pass.

Senator Dianne Feinstein won reelection with almost 60 percent
of the vote. The Democratic gains in the Senate are uncertain, as
results from Montana and Virginia were too close to call.
