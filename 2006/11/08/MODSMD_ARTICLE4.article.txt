# Parental notice measure fails
## Prop. 85 galvanizes campus Democrats, pro-choice groups celebrate victories 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Seizing on the defeat of Proposition 85, campus pro-choice
leaders declared yesterday's election a victory for women's rights.
California voters rejected the measure, which would have re
quired a doctor to notify parents or guardians of minors seeking
an abortion,by an almost 10-point margin. At press time, the mar
gin was 54-46 with 84 percent of precincts reporting.
"I'm glad that California remains a proud, pro-choice state,"
said junior Mishan Araujo, co-president of Stanford Students for
Choice. "It's comforting that when [the right to choose is] put to
a test, people respond in a good way."
Noelle Patno, a member of Feminists for Life of America and
Stanford Students for Life, held out hope late into the night that
the measure could still pass.

Senator Dianne Feinstein won reelection with almost 60 percent
of the vote. The Democratic gains in the Senate are uncertain, as
results from Montana and Virginia were too close to call.
"I still hope the proposition is
going to pass," she said. Not passing
the proposition "means that parental
notification will still not be required,
and minors can still be coerced into
abortions."
This was the second ballot initia
tive in the last year that would have
created a parental notification law. A
similar measure. Proposition 73, was
defeated last November.
Planned Parenthood, a leading
abortion-rights group, spent millions
of dollars on television ads urging
voters to vote no on Proposition 85.
Patno criticized these ads.
"I've read articles about how
Planned Parenthood's advertise
ments falsely claimed that the propo
sition did not include any exceptions
for minors from abusive homes," she
said.
In an election where the Democ
ratic nominee for governor failed to
fire up the liberal base. Proposition
85 brought many traditional Democ
rats to the polls. At the University, an
anti-Proposition 85 rally last Friday
was headlined by gubernatorial can
didate Phil Angelides and State Con
troller Steve Westly.
In exit polls conducted by The

Daily, several students like sopho
more Tien Le. 19, said that Prop 85
drove them to vote.
"No way in California," said Le.
I"he registered Democrat said voting
no would protect a woman's right to
choose.
Medical School student Matt
Goldstein, 24, said there was a lot of
discussion in his classes about Prop
85. On Tuesday morning, his Human
Health and Disease professor lob
bied the class to vote against the
measure before lecturing on the
male reproductive system.
"It was actually discussed a lot
and very heavily publicized," he said,
joined bv his girlfriend as he left the
El Centro Chicano lounge polling
site.
Araujo expressed relief that the
measure failed. She said it was one in
a string of victories this election.
"Choice is at a critical point in our
country." she said.
In Oregon, a parental notification
measure similar to Proposition 85
also failed. A far-reaching ban on
abortions in South Dakota, making
them illegal except when the moth
er's life is in danger, was also voted
down. And today, the Supreme Court

will hear oral arguments on the so
called "partial-birth abortion" ban
enacted by Congress in November
2003 but ruled unconstitutional by a
lower court. This will be a crucial
test on the new Supreme Court
under Chief Justice John Roberts
and Associate Justice Samuel Alito.
An article in today's Washington
Post says that Justice Anthony
Kennedy may be the swing vote in
the decision.
"1 think it's very important that
Americans are participating." said
Araujo."The vast majority of Amer
icans think a woman should have the
right to choose."
Proposition 85 was sponsored by
a San Diego-weekly newspaper
owner. California would have be
come the 16th state with a parental
notification law, according to the As
sociated Press. Another Instates cur
rently require parental consent.
While Araujo said she hoped
there would not be another notifica
tion measure on the ballot. Patno
said she didn't know if there would
be another initiative in the next elec
tion.
"It depends." she said, "on the
people of California."
