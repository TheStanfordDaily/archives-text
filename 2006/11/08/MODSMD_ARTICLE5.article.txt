LOS ANGELES — Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger claimed ;i second term TUesdax
with a decisive victory over Democrat Phil An
gelides,capping a yearlong comeback in which he
admitted mistakes, hoomeranged back to the po
litical center and spotlighted his celebrity to win
appeal across the voter spectrum.
In a year when Republicans struggled nation
wide, Schwarzenegger avoided the same fate by
positioning himself as an "Arnold Republican'
— a bipartisan dealmaker with strained ties to
the Bush White House. ITie actor-governor was
also blessed with a lusterless opponent who
failed to energize his own party, even in a state
known as a Democratic stronghold.

With more than 60 percent of precincts re
porting. Schwarzenegger had 57.5 percent of the
vote to Angelides' 37.5 percent.
"I love doing.sequels." Schwarzenegger said ;it
a victory rally in Beverly Mills where he was
showered with confetti." Iliis without any doubt
is my favorite sequel."
Schwarzenegger's victory was a demoralizing
blow to state Democrats who hoped to oust the
nation's best-known governor.
"From the day we started this campaign, we
stood up for what we knew was right." Angelides
told supporters in Sacramento. "We stood up for
the people who need a chance in government."
I'arly returns showed Schwarzenegger with
renewed popularity across party and geographic
lines, including in traditionally Democratic
coastal areas. An Associated Press exit poll
showed the governor capturing many self-de
scribed liberals, about a fifth of Democratic vot
ers and more than half the independents.
