LOS ANGELES — Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger claimed ;i second term TUesdax
with a decisive victory over Democrat Phil An
gelides,capping a yearlong comeback in which he
admitted mistakes, hoomeranged back to the po
litical center and spotlighted his celebrity to win
appeal across the voter spectrum.
In a year when Republicans struggled nation
wide, Schwarzenegger avoided the same fate by
positioning himself as an "Arnold Republican'
— a bipartisan dealmaker with strained ties to
the Bush White House. ITie actor-governor was
also blessed with a lusterless opponent who
failed to energize his own party, even in a state
known as a Democratic stronghold.

With more than 60 percent of precincts re
porting. Schwarzenegger had 57.5 percent of the
vote to Angelides' 37.5 percent.
"I love doing.sequels." Schwarzenegger said ;it
a victory rally in Beverly Mills where he was
showered with confetti." Iliis without any doubt
is my favorite sequel."
Schwarzenegger's victory was a demoralizing
blow to state Democrats who hoped to oust the
nation's best-known governor.
"From the day we started this campaign, we
stood up for what we knew was right." Angelides
told supporters in Sacramento. "We stood up for
the people who need a chance in government."
I'arly returns showed Schwarzenegger with
renewed popularity across party and geographic
lines, including in traditionally Democratic
coastal areas. An Associated Press exit poll
showed the governor capturing many self-de
scribed liberals, about a fifth of Democratic vot
ers and more than half the independents.

ALL EYES ON ARNOLD: Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger trounced his opponent, state
treasurer Phil Angelides, by almost 20 percentage points. Great expectations await his next term.
Schwarzenegger far outpaced his
2003 recall victory, when he won 48.6
percent of the vote. If vote trends
continue, Tuesday's contest would
rank among the most lopsided in a
California governor's race in
decades, all the more notable for a
Republican in a year of Democratic
gains nationwide.
The victory is sure to elevate the
governor's national stature and
bring a fresh round of speculation
about his political future.
Schwarzenegger has joked about be
coming president, but because he is
foreign born, it would take a consti
tutional amendment for him to run.
"The biggest Republican winner
tonight is the one guy who can't run
for president in two years," said
Claremont McKenna College politi
cal scientist John Pitney. "Many Re
publicans will hold him up as a
model for how the party can come
back. He's the example of how to
win."
Angelides' troubles were
summed up by Pat Spake. 77. of
Sacramento, who said her decision to
snub the Democrat was the first time
in her life she didn't vote with the
party's candidate.
Angelides, the state treasurer,
"had no impact whatsoever on the
voting public," said Spake, who was
tempted to vote for Schwarzenegger
but instead pulled the lever for the
Green Party's Peter Camejo. "He
has no charisma."
A year ago. the race was the De
mocrats' to lose.
The Republican governor's popu

larity collapsed along with his grand
scheme to realign political power in
Sacramento. Schwarzenegger, 59,
was forced to ponder the possibility
that his first term might be his last.
But the former muscleman and
Hollywood star abruptly changed
course. He stopped belittling "girlie
men" legislator and public employ
ee unions, and cut deals with Democ
rats on popular issues like global
warming and road-building. Aided
by a rolling economy, his campaign
won back Democratic and inde
pendent support by blending Rea
ganesque optimism with a return to
the middle-ground politics that
helped propel him into office in
2003.
Independent Marko Koosel. 35,
of San Francisco, was angered by the
Iraq war and voted for Democrats
for U.S. Senate and the House. But
for governor, he backed
Schwarzenegger.
"I felt Phil Angelides hasn't
shown anything special that would
separate him," Koosel said.
Angelides, 53, tried to convince
voters Schwarzenegger is a soul
mate of President Bush whose true
interests are nested with the corpo
rations and lobbyists that feed off
state government.
But Democrats were slow to
warm to his candidacy. Even in the
election's closing days, polls suggest
ed the liberal Democrat remained
unknown to many of the state's 37
million residents. The problem is
summed up by an adage in politics —
it's hard to beat somebody with no
body.
In many ways, Angelides inherit
ed the plight of national Democrats
in recent elections _ the vision thing.
With a haze of shifting messages, he
left himself open to questions about

what he stood for. Was he the anti-
Arnold? The education candidate?
Champion of the middle class?
Schwarzenegger is prevented by
term limits from seeking a third
term. Voters overlooked or forgave
much from his first.
Congressional Republicans
promised reform, didn't deliver and
suffered at the polls. Schwarzeneg

ger promised dramatic reform,
pledging to "blow up the boxes" of
state government, didn't deliver, and
scored a watershed victory.
If last year showed the limits of
Schwarzenegger's celebrity, this year
he used the advantages of incumben
cy and stardom to dominate media
coverage through much of the race,
excessive risk.
