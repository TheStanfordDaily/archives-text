# SOUTH DAKOTANS REJECT TOUGH ABORTION BAN
## 
### 
South Dakotans on Tuesday rejected a
toughest-in-the-nation law that would have
banned virtually all abortions, while Missouri
— in an extremely tight contest — approved
an amendment to ensure that stem cell re
search can be conducted in the state. Both
were sharp setbacks for conservative activists.
Seven states approved amendments to ban gay
marriage, but Arizona was poised to defeat a
similar measure — and become the first to do
so out of 28 that have considered the bans in
recent vears.
