## Editorial Board A 						step in the right direction 
### 
The American people, and the world,
woke up Wednesday morning with a new
political landscape. It is in a way similar
to 1994's so-called "Republican Revolu
tion," when the GOP captured 54 House
,ind eight Senate seats, promising a new,
accountable era for government. For a
thoroughly disappointed American peo
ple. a day like Wednesday was long over
due.
Hie Democratic Party has decisively
taken the House ol Representatives, taking
upwards of 30 seats from Republicans, and
surprised pundits everywhere by being in
an excellent position to also take the Sen
ate. pending results in Virginia. Controver
sial Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
submitted his long-awaited resignation yes
terday morning on the heels of the opposi
tion's gains. Six governorships and 10 state
legislative chambers moved from red to
blue. Democrats are now the single-party
government in 15 states compared to the
GOP\ 10. California was a rare Republican
bright spot, where Arnold Schwarzenegger
defeated Phil Angelides and most of the
propositions, including 86 and 87, failed.
But almost everywhere else. Democrats
made gains at the expense of the past
decade's dominant party.
I lowever. these generally laudable elec
tion results are meaningless unless the De
mocrats seize this opportunity to move
American politics in a new direction. The
Republican Congressional leadership has
been characterized in recent years by ram
pant corruption (Tom DeLayj. partisanship
(the filibuster debate) and politics for self
gain (the gay marriage constitutional
amendment). With a soiid majority in the
I louse and the crucial one-vote majority in
the Senate, the Democrats have an oppor
tunity to restore the American people's
confidence in Congress, the lack ol which
propelled them to power.
I or Congressional Democrats, they have
two main areas to address. First, how are
they going to address residual issues from
the Bush Administration and the Republi
can ( ongress? Ballooning deficits, the 9/11
Commission's recommendations and. most
of all, the Iraq War all merit attention from

new Speaker Nancy Pelosi and new Major
ity Leader Harry Reid.The sentiment for a
complete change in our policy in Iraq has
never been stronger, and the Democrats
would he wise to promote a concrete alter
native solution to the Bush Administra
tion's incompetence. Second, they must
move forward and implement legislation to
raise the minimum wage,fund stem-cell re
search. create a comprehensive immigra
tion plan and rewrite the prescription-drug
plan.
Both Pelosi and Democratic Congres
sional Campaign Committee chair Rahm
Emanuel spoke on I lection Night, at least
rhetorically, of reaching across the aisle and
working with Republicans. Iliis is very im
portant. especially for an\ investigations
that are to occur: these proceedings must be
in the public interest rather than in the De
mocratic Party's interest. One of the worst
features of the Republican Congress was
the blatant use of power to further their
own time in power, and the Democrats will
suffer the same fate that the Republicans
did for their hubris.
In California, Schwarzenegger achieved
a mandate by defeating his opponent 56-39,
attracting many votes from independents
and moderate Democrats. I lis bipartisan
record over the past year has been given a
seal of approval by the people of California.
Our governor should be careful not to be
tray the people's trust and continue to work
with Assembly and Senate Democrats for
minimum-wage protections, improving ed
ucation and protecting the environment.
Especially after Proposition 87. to fund al
ternative-energy research, failed, our gov
ernor must take special care to continue
California's record of environmental pro
tection and innovation.
Lastly, President George VV. Bush looks
increasingly weakened and with no political
capital left. Both parties are looking to 2008
already, and the task now falls to the House
and Senate leadership to propose new
ideas. Our country's political future took
one giant step in the right direction on Tues
day. But now that step must be turned into
something much more, an entirely new di
rection, which has been so lone overdue.
