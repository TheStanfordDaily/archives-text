# Moscow doesn't believe in tears
## 
### 
I saw a dead man lying on the steps of a
Moscow underpass. If I correctly fol
lowed the story of his distorted limbs at
their carnival-fun-house angles, he was
headed to an appointment — probably one
that seems less urgent now — in such a rush
that pedestrian matters like ice and
handrails held no meaning. Hie blood paint
ed on what used to be his jawbone was al
most black, with bubbles dried in it like tar.
()n his left eyelid, swollen like a grapefruit,
you could see through the blood something
shriveled and green. Possibly a dried leaf
blown on by the wind? Probably not.
But what do you do, right? Some of us
crossed ourselves, then we all went back to
our business, touring sites from the novel
"Master and Margarita." After a tense half
block, somebody ventured a tentative joke;
we laughed; the issue was gone, pushed
aside, but not forgotten. Over the next week
our computer cluster was choked with the
news. I read it in our blogs, caught it in
snatches of phone calls, accidentally
skimmed it in my friends' emails home: "I
saw a dead man."
Ihey say you'll never forget your time
abroad. Yeah, no joke.
The reason I share with you the story of
this discarded corpse is not to segue into a
rant on safety or reflect that in one way or
another commute kills us all (I've got my
eye on you. global warming) but simply be
cause it is one of my most vivid memories of
the city. I ve come to terms with the fact that
staying in a metropolis this big for this short
a time, there is no way I can really know
Moscow before I leave it in six weeks. Hut
when you really gel down to it. I don't know
everything about my hometown, or Stan
ford. or even my own mother — yet I still
love them. It's kind of a leap of faith. Flying
on that same momentum, I'm going tocome
right out and say it: I love Moscow, dead
guys and all.
Honestly, I can't exactly tell you why.
Nothing has a very simple answer here —
just try asking for directions to an Inglish
language bookstore — but this place has hi
jacked my brain not for its literature, histo
ry or language, but for the small change of
its social interactions. Although glib aener

ulizations and snarky punch lines have their
place, the heart of the city is in day-to-day
experiences.
Stray dogs roam the streets in packs here
probably all cousins many times re
moved. with the same loping mouths and
awkwardly long tails and clench up like
fists to sleep on the sidewalk. One day I
watched one of these creatures cautiously
cross the street when a car flew around the
corner, one tire crushing the dog's neck.The
next lour cars did not even swerve to avoid
the carcass.
Last weekend a friend and I decided to
re-experience American fine dining. As we
entered Domino s, we saw a heavy-set man
in a black leather jacket whose hand was
dripping blood on the counter; he fingered
through a thick wad of one-hundred dollar
bills in his wallet and wo immediately decid
ed he was a pimp. As we sat down with our
beers, he cornered us and told us he was try
ing to join a Russian motorcycle gang and
rapidly slurred the story of how he had bro
ken his arm that morning, spitting in my eye
every time he pronounced a "p" or a "b."
Twenty minutes later he explained that he
was kicked out of his home a few weeks be
fore because his mother was undergoing
chemotherapy for breast cancer; he looked
at his lap for 30 trembling seconds and we
waited for him to wipe away his tears with
blood smeared fingers. ITien, like nothing
had happened, lie came back to life and
taught us phrases of Russian prison slang.
(Jetting off at my metro stop, a young
man approached me with burned-out zom
bie eyes, holding a syringe; lie begged for 20
rubles "for a beer." After a moment of con
sideration. I handed him the money and got
