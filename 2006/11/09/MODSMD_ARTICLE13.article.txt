# There are monsters everywhere
## 
### 
As 1 write this column, I am distracted
by the incoming voter projections
broadcasted by online news services.
Democrats take the House and Senate and
the world is apparently on the brink of being
saved from llie perverse evil that has threat
ened it for the last six years. Then 1 scroll
down, and read the rest of the news.
Arizona approves English as its official
language in a virtual slap-in-the-face to im
migrants. This proposition reduces funding
for dual-language materials, seemingly to say,
"It you don't read English, we don't want
you."
Michigan decides to restrict affirmative
action.no longer allowing universities to give
preferential treatment to minorities and
women in regards to admission. Apparently
we already have more than enough college
educated women and people of color. Michi
gan voters seem to feel that they have done
enough to overturn the long history of op
pression and slavery in the United States —
enough is enough.
My personal favorites are the same-sex
marriage bans in Virginia, South Carolina,
South Dakota, Idaho, Tennessee, Colorado
and . . Wisconsin. Iliis last state, the state
where I grew up. where 1 spent the majority

of my life, has decided to denounce me at last.
Almost 70 percent of my hometown decided
that marriage is between a man and a
woman. Even worse, they've decided that un
married couples should not be allowed any
thing resembling the package of rights con
comitant with marriage. Throwing the do
mestic partnership out with the bath water, I
suppose.
There's a stark sense of betrayal in all of
this. I can't help but hate everyone I know
who voted for this ban. 1 can't help but want
to fly back to Wisconsin, ask each person in
dividually what their vote was and if they an
swer incorrectly, beat them senseless. And
now. as the violent longings slowly seep out of
me, they leave only a quiet sadness and a
sense of blame.

Although I'm not sure who I blame. Do I
blame the mother of one of my best friends,
who voted for this ban? When he told me this,
I could hardly resist the urge to tell him that
his mother was a monster. As it is. he's decid
ed not to speak with his mother for a while.
But is his mother really a monster? Is she
the one to blame? In her eyes, aren't I the
monster? Those immigrants who steal jobs,
those minorities who steal college slots, those
homosexuals who steal marriage rights and
tax money —aren't they the monsters too?
A monster is someone who you fear, a some
one who represents a threat to that which
you hold dear.
My triend's mother is Indian. I've known
her since I was a little kid. Her house is
stocked with incredible candy and she makes
the best bruschetta I ve ever had in my life.
She hugs me whenever I see her. Now. she is
the monster of my hometown. She is the
monster of my ethnic community. And worse,
she represents the monstrosity that my entire
hometown, my state, my country and my eth
nic community are capable of. And by mak
ing her into my own personal monster. I can
avoid dealing with the fact that she hurt me.
