(French) Le tnieux est I'ennemi du bien.
< English) The best is the enemy of the good.
While a French idiom warns against
striving too hard for perfection,
Fnglish speakers would more likely
identify with, "Shoot for the moon; even if
you miss, you will land among the stars."The
French might seem absurd, but if 1 had to go
with somebody, I'd probably go with Voltaire
over Brown. I know that pits me against the
prevailing mindset of this land of opportuni
ty, but 1 know there's a point when striving
too hard for perfection gets in the way of,
well. life. And a lot of other things. For exam
ple, what's the point of taking 20 units every
quarter if you're completely burnt out when
they hand you the degree and unwilling to
look at anything remotely related to your un
dergraduate career again?
What happens in a broader context,
though? What about the best-intentioned ac
tivists who decide that their life's work is
making the planet into their version of
Utopia? Sometimes things just don't work
that way. Sometimes, in trying to make the
whole world pure, you yourself rot from the
inside out.
Fhe problem is, this is exactly what we're

doing, on so many different levels. I'm just
one person; if I decide that I want to remake
the entire world into my image of Utopia be
fore I die. I 'm going to be miserable for a de
cent part of my life. That's not to say that I
should just give up entirely, but realistic goals
are important. And the same is true for na
tions. There's no point in trying to make the
world a spitting image of ourselves, because
that's our idea of Utopia, if we turn ourselves
into a quagmire of despicability in the
process. Because then even if we do pull off
creating a world in our image, all we will ac
complish is making the whole world into a
kind of miserable dystopia.
So, what do we think is a good idea? Turn
ing over our own rights? ITiat's exactly what
we've been doing recently. We can now be
thrown in jail indefinitely for no given rea

son; we can have our communications moni
tored without being notified even if there are
no specific charges against us: the govern
ment can demand records such as library
book checkouts and have the librarians pros
ecuted if they notify the people affected.
Sounds like a shining beacon of freedom
and democracy to me. But should 1 really be
surprised when people try to tell me that,
since things are so much worse over there,
these are just little things that I have to en
dure to make the whole world better and I
shouldn t be such a whiner? Somehow I don't
buy that. 1 don t think that having to worry
about being investigated tor no reason with
out even being aware of it will help other
people around the world become more
"free."
You might say the same thing about
women s rights. A popular "liberals are
hypocrites argument is that we re push
ing for women's rights here (abortion, bet
ter justice for rape victims, etc.) and bla
tantly ignoring women's rights overseas.
Conservatives are the ones going to the Is
lamic world, the place that treats its
women worst, and doing something to
