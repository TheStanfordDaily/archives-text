# MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Not-so-friendly tune-up with Cal Cardinal host rival in informal meet 
### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hie No. 2 Stanford men's swim
ming and diving team faced per
haps their toughest competition of
the season yesterday at the Avery
Aquatic Center. In an informal
dual meet, the Cardinal battled
their cross-bay rival. No. 4 Califor
nia.
The meet consisted of only two
diving events and 10 relays, includ
ing non-traditional races like 300-
vard relays of butterfly, backstroke
and breaststroke. Although the
races were not scored, senior Matt

Crowe said the team still walked
away with a sense of accomplish
ment.
"It was just a good chance to get
up and race Cal without worrying
about the scoring," Crowe said.
"The fun format allowed us to
enjoy ourselves and get work done
early in the season, all while racing
one of the best teams in the coun
try."
Of the twelve events, Stanford
earned top honors in five. The day
was especially successful for the
Cardinal divers, who sprung to vic
tory in both the one-meter and the
three-meter diving events. With a
composite score of 602.02 in the
one-meter, the Stanford "A" divers
dominated the second-place Bears
by over 70 points
Over in the competition pool, the
Cardinal swimmers emerged victori
ous in the 500-freestyle. 1500-
freestyle and 300-breaststroke relays.
Ihe breaststroke trio ol junior Karl
Boehringer and sophomores Chris
Ash and Paul Kornfeld smashed the
rest of the field in the three-man 300-
breaststroke relay. In the 1500-
freestyle relay — the day's only dis
tance event — senior Shaun Phillips
and juniors Phillip Morrison and Noa

Sakamoto each swam 500 yards to a
10-second win over the Bears. Phillips
and Morrison also joined senior Andy
Grant and junior Danny Beal for a
victory in the 800-free relay.
Iliough the non-scoring format
did not declare a winner, the next
meet against Cal is sure to be a bat
tle. Hi is year's "Big Meet," to be
held February 10th in Berkeley, is
traditionally considered the fastest,
most competitive dual meet in the
nation. Crowe said the men hope to

learn from yesterday's experience
against the Bears so that they can
112 ind ways to fine-tune their races or
dives and further build team cama
raderie.
"As a whole, the meet went pret
ty well," Crowe said. "We've been
working really hard in practice, and
this was just a starting point to see
where we are in our training. Most of
all, the point of the meet was to learn
from our mistakes so we can perform
better in the future."
