ming and diving team faced per
haps their toughest competition of
the season yesterday at the Avery
Aquatic Center. In an informal
dual meet, the Cardinal battled
their cross-bay rival. No. 4 Califor
nia.
The meet consisted of only two
diving events and 10 relays, includ
ing non-traditional races like 300-
vard relays of butterfly, backstroke
and breaststroke. Although the
races were not scored, senior Matt

Crowe said the team still walked
away with a sense of accomplish
ment.
"It was just a good chance to get
up and race Cal without worrying
about the scoring," Crowe said.
"The fun format allowed us to
enjoy ourselves and get work done
early in the season, all while racing
one of the best teams in the coun
try."
Of the twelve events, Stanford
earned top honors in five. The day
was especially successful for the
Cardinal divers, who sprung to vic
tory in both the one-meter and the
three-meter diving events. With a
composite score of 602.02 in the
one-meter, the Stanford "A" divers
dominated the second-place Bears
