Perhaps the trend in sports fan
dom 1 find most annoying in re
cent days is the need for every
thing to be "the best" as soon as we
see it.There's no time for reflection —
if Tom Brady wins an impressive
game, then he's this week's "best
quarterback."and when Peyton Man
ning does it the next week, then it's his
turn to be anointed the greatest. One
moment. Bill Belichick must be the
best coach ever, and the next it's Mike
Shanahan or Bill Parcells or the latest
one-year wonder (see: Nick Saban.
2005).
As if that weren't confusing
enough, not only do we. as fans, see
the need to debate the worth of the
players of today, but we also need to
compare them to the players and
teams of history as well. I want some
one to explain to me why we have to
compare the 2006 Chicago Bears to
the l l >Bs Bears. To be sure, both were
very good teams, but just how good
this year's Chicago team is has yet to
be determined. The Bears still have
half of the regular season and the
playoffs to go before anyone should
be anointing them the next great team
or even the next great defense.
So I'll be the first to admit it: 1 was
glad to see the previously undefeated
Bears fall to Miami this weekend. Not
because I have anything against
Chicago — no. 1 just don't like it when
history is written before it happens.
There was no more fitting opponent
than the Dolphins to bring Chicago
and the national media back down to
earth.
It was that famed '72 Miami team
that was the first and last team in the
Super Bowl era to complete the per
fect season en route to their Super
Bowl VII victory, and since then fans
have been waiting for it to happen
again. The Chicago Bears were this
year's supposed challengers to that
Miami team's achievement as the
only one to complete the "perfect sea
son."
Unfortunately, the only blemish
on the '85 Bears' season was their reg
ular season loss to a Dolphins team
led by Dan Marino. All of which
means that although we're done hear
ing about the Bears' quest for perfec
tion, we're not yet done with the com
parisons to '85 and Singletary. Payton
and Mike Ditka.
Ihe ultimate error of all this is that
the Bears of this year are actually a lot
closer to another Super Bowl team —
the 2002 Buccaneers. Running the
same "Cover 2" defensive scheme,
with similar personnel to the Bucs on
offense and defense and a young en
thusiastic head coach who might be
the defensive version of Jon Gruden,
the Bears of now are much closer to
the Tampa team of 02 than they are to
the "Monsters of the Midway" of the
mid NO's.
But the comparisons will just keep
on coming until the Bears lose again.
And they probably will, because, as
previously noted, they aren't their'Bs
counterparts.The Bears of now can be
beaten, and will be.
Just as the Buccaneers were in 02.
