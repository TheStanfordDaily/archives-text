# Reaching out to China
## University opts for a policy of inclusion rather than isolation 
### HAO YAN DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT 
Newsweek ranked Stanford second in their list of the
top 100 "global" universities this summer, and nowhere
is this international emphasis more apparent than in the
University's burgeoning relationship with China.
But as the ties between Stanford and the world's most
populous nation have grown, so too have the complexi
ties. Reporters and academics alike raised eyebrows
when Yahoo! donated $1 million to fund the I Jniversity's
Knight Fellowship for international journalists in Sep
temberâ€” Yahoo! had turned over Internet search
records to the Chinese government in 2004 that led to
the arrests of journalists. The University accepted the
money, making a statement that despite human rights
concerns, dialogue may be the best way to effect change.
"I think engagement is a better policy than isolation."
University President John Hennessy told The Daily. "I
ask the question. Are we all better off if Yahoo! has a
presence in China,or if Yahoo! says they would not go to
China until the laws change?" In the end. 1 favor engage
ment in those situations. But my belief in the long term is
that those things have to change."

Stanford is not alone. In

September. Yale
snagged a $50 million en
dowment from Maurice

Greenberg and the Starr
Foundation to establish
the Maurice R. Green-

berg Yale-China Initia
tive for "advancing the
Yale's collaborations with

China in critical areas."
And last month. The Paul

N. Nitz.e School of Advanced
International Studies at Johns

Hopkins University announced "the

Year of C hina" to "examine China and its evolving role
on the world stage as a special substantive theme for the
2006-07 academic year."

Not to be outdone, the University kicked off The
Stanford Challenge last month, a $4.3 billion fundraising
drive that looks in part to bolster Chinese studies and
boost financial aid to international students. Chao Fen
Sun. the newly appointed Director of the Center for East
Asian Studies, emphasized the importance of this mis
sion.
"Stanford is not only a leading U.S. university, but it is
also the leading university on the Pacific Rim and it must
have a major center of Chinese studies." he said. "The

goal for Chinese studies at Stanford should be to train a
new generation of world leaders who do not only have a
high degree of professional skill but can also speak Chi
nese. understand China's culture and history and know
how to deal with various issues and solve various prob
lems with a comprehensive knowledge of the world."

increased in popularity since its debut
in 2004, with a doubling of the number
of applicants to 30 since inception and
a recent Bing trip to Xinjiang.
"We offer students the chance to
learn about China in English from
local faculty and Stanford faculty, and
to experience the dizzying changes
firsthand," said program director Dr.
Jason Patent. "This city is just so full of
opportunit esand potential.it boggles
the mind."
Hennessy, who is no stranger to
China, having visited there several
times and been interviewed on state
run television, agreed.
"One of the most amazing places
to go is to the city planning museum of
Shanghai," he said. "You see not only
how thoughtful and detailed their
plans are, but how long-range their
plans are. You realize that China is
very much a country on the move, and
the role it is going to play in our world
is critically important."
While the University has sought
to send its students to China, The
Stanford Challenge also looks to
help bring Chinese students to The

Farm. International students have
traditionally struggled to study in the
United States because they are not
eligible for federal financial aid and
loans. But Dean of Admissions
Richard Shaw, who came from Yale,
another school known for its long
historical lies with China, said his of
lice is working to change that. ITie
class of 2010 has 16 students from
China and two from 1 long Kong, and
Stanford has been more actively pre
senting itself globally by sending ad
mission representatives to Europe,
I atin America and Asia. Admissions
representatives returned to China
this spring for the first time since
1999 to hold information sessions in
Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and
I iangzhou.
The Stanford tour to China, led by
former Director of International Ad
missions Anna Takahashi. was well re
ceived by prospective applicants from
local Chinese high schools. Shaw told
The Daily that while the biggest limi
tation for Chinese students who are
considering applying is financial aid.
Stanford does fund most of its under

graduate students from China in vari
ous levels.There is a "continuing com
mitment" to raise funds for interna
tional admits, Shaw said, with a cur
rent annual budget of $4 million
shared by around 100 international
undergraduate students and a possi
ble move towards a need-blind admis
sion policy for international students
within 5 years.
As China modernizes and grap
ples with human rights issues, Hen
nessy argued that Stanford could play
an integral role in the country's devel
opment.
"I think it is a society undergoing
dramatic changes and improvement,
both in the rights of citizen and op
portunities for people," he said. "And
I think it is critical for a university
like Stanford to be engaged not only
with the educational opportunities it
can provide to Chinese students and
to our students who go abroad to
China, but also increasingly in re
search areas as well, that 1 think
would be the betterment of the en
tire society, both in the U.S. and
China, in the lone term."
