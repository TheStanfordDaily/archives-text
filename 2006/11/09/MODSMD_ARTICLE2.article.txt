# Reaching out to China
## University opts for a policy of inclusion rather than isolation 
### HAO YAN DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT 
Newsweek ranked Stanford second in their list of the
top 100 "global" universities this summer, and nowhere
is this international emphasis more apparent than in the
University's burgeoning relationship with China.
But as the ties between Stanford and the world's most
populous nation have grown, so too have the complexi
ties. Reporters and academics alike raised eyebrows
when Yahoo! donated $1 million to fund the I Jniversity's
Knight Fellowship for international journalists in Sep
temberâ€” Yahoo! had turned over Internet search
records to the Chinese government in 2004 that led to
the arrests of journalists. The University accepted the
money, making a statement that despite human rights
concerns, dialogue may be the best way to effect change.
"I think engagement is a better policy than isolation."
University President John Hennessy told The Daily. "I
ask the question. Are we all better off if Yahoo! has a
presence in China,or if Yahoo! says they would not go to
China until the laws change?" In the end. 1 favor engage
ment in those situations. But my belief in the long term is
that those things have to change."

Stanford is not alone. In

September. Yale
snagged a $50 million en
dowment from Maurice

Greenberg and the Starr
Foundation to establish
the Maurice R. Green-

berg Yale-China Initia
tive for "advancing the
Yale's collaborations with

China in critical areas."
And last month. The Paul

N. Nitz.e School of Advanced
International Studies at Johns

Hopkins University announced "the

Year of C hina" to "examine China and its evolving role
on the world stage as a special substantive theme for the
2006-07 academic year."

Not to be outdone, the University kicked off The
Stanford Challenge last month, a $4.3 billion fundraising
drive that looks in part to bolster Chinese studies and
boost financial aid to international students. Chao Fen
Sun. the newly appointed Director of the Center for East
Asian Studies, emphasized the importance of this mis
sion.
"Stanford is not only a leading U.S. university, but it is
also the leading university on the Pacific Rim and it must
have a major center of Chinese studies." he said. "The

goal for Chinese studies at Stanford should be to train a
new generation of world leaders who do not only have a
high degree of professional skill but can also speak Chi
nese. understand China's culture and history and know
how to deal with various issues and solve various prob
lems with a comprehensive knowledge of the world."
