### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
To most Stanford students,squash
is a vegetable to be avoided in the
dining hall. Turns out, it's also an ex
citing sport.
The Stanford men's squash team

got their season underway last Satur
day when they challenged No. 15
Navy The No. 24 Cardinal (1-1) put
up a fight, but the Midshipmen (2-0)
proved too strong, as they took the 8-
1 win.
Hie Cardinal's lone point came in
a five-game decision at the No. 8 po
sition. Junior Ben Peterson battled
back from an 8-5 deficit in the fifth
game to capture a 10-8 victory over
Navy's Allen I lartley in the deciding
game.

"Man of the match definitely goes
to lien Peterson," sophomore Ned
Henningsen said. "He started last
year and he has made amazing
progress since then."
Only one other match went more
than three games. Senior George
kwon took Michael Beautyman. Jr.
to four games before falling. 9-6.3-9,
9-5,9-4.
'I"he Cardinal are one of just two
teams ranked in the top 25 that don't
have varsity status. No. 17 Denison is
the only other non-varsity squad
among the top teams.
The Cardinal found more success
last night when they took on No. 41
Cal in Berkeley ITiey handed the
Bears a 9-0 loss for their first win of
the season. Stanford played without

a number of starters, giving some of
the less-experienced players a
chance to play.
The Cardinal next head to 1 lamil
ton College in Clinton. N.Y.. for the
Hamilton Round Robin from Dec.
1-3. The competition at the event in
cludes No. 13 Franklin & Marshall.
No. 18 St. Lawrence and No. 20
