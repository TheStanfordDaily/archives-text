# Daniel Novinson's POWER 25

Unlike other polls, this one attempts to control for differ
ences in schedules by ranking the teams purely on how
well they've played, not their win-loss records. I like the odds
for the Michigan/Ohio State winner to meet Florida in the title
game, but watch out for those pesky Big East squads.

1 Ohio State 1 Might have been looking past Illinois a little.
2 Michigan 2 The defense alone won't beat the Buckeyes.
