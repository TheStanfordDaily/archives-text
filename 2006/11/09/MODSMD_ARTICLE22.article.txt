## From CEO to the ISS: A journey into space 
### NOEL BAKHTIAN 
I don't expect everyone to know
who Anousheh Ansari is. But I'm
going to tell you. In fact. I'm going to
11 > and convince you to come to her
talk on Friday. Why? Because I be
lieve that we are an educated bunch,
we're up on our world events, we
care about the future and we're priv
ileged to study at a university which
brines in incredible speakers for us to
interact with.
I lie Persian Students Association
(PSA), together with the
Aero/Astro, ML and HE Depart
ments (that's a third of the Engineer
ing School, people), the Internation
al Center, the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau and the Iranian Studies pro
gram have come together to support
Frida\ \s lecture. You might be think
ing. "Yeah, I'm not an engineer. 1
don't want to go to space. Next arti
cle." Well, fine. If you're not the least
interested in technology, different
cultures, space, women who have
climbed to the top or entrepreneur
ship and innovation, then 1 release
you from the obligation of reading
this article. But I say:
C ome on Friday. Meet some friends,
learn something new, ask a question,
dare to be inspired. After all, why
else are we here?
Most might recognize
Anousheh's name in association
with the Ansari X Prize and the re
cent news coverage of her historic
trip to space, but her story starts long
before. 1 laving moved to the United
States from Iran as a teenager, she
studied electrical engineering and

computer science at George Mason
University and obtained a master's
degree from George Washington
University. Starting her career at
MCI Telecommunications Corpora
tion. Anousheh worked in several
engineering capacities. In the early
■yi)s, she helped found and served as
CEO of Telecom Technologies, Inc.
( I'l I) which later successfully
merged in 2000 with Sonus Net
works, Inc. for $550 million in stock.
More recently, she co-founded and
now serves as chairman of Prodea
Systems, Inc., a company serving to
enhance the digital home experience
with the help of industry-changing
technologies.
The conjunction between
Anousheh's vision for new technolo
gies and her long-standing interest in
space exploration is demonstrated in
her contribution to the title sponsor
ship of the Ansari X Prize. This
space-related competition, whose
mission was to foster innovation and
"enable radical breakthroughs for
the benefit of humanity," offered a
$10 million award (the largest prize
in history) for the first private team
to launch a reusable manned space
craft into space twice within two
weeks. This feat was accomplished in
2004 by Burt Rutan and Paul Allen
of Mojave Aerospace Ventures with
the flights of SpaceShipOne.
Anousheh's support and interest
in space travel culminated this past
September in her trip to the Interna
tional Space Station (ISS), a voyage
set up through Space Adventures,
Ltd. Lifting off on the Soyuz
TMA-9 mission from Baikonur Cos

modrome in Kazakhstan on Sept. 18.
2006, Anousheh joined the Expedi
tion 14 crew (cosmonaut Mikhail
Tyurin and astronaut Michael
Lopez-Alegria) for the journey to
the ISS. During the eight-day stay on
the space station, she implemented
experiments designed by the Euro
pean Space Agency (ESA). tested
new Prodea Systems technologies,
and regularly posted to her blog with
updates on her activities. For the re
turn to Earth, she accompanied the
Expedition 13 crew, cosmonaut
Pavel Vinogradov and astronaut Jeff
Williams, who had just completed a
six-month stay aboard the ISS. In
total, Anousheh spent close to 11
days in space, becoming the world's
fourth (and first female) space
tourist and the first Iranian in space.
Asked about what she wished to
accomplish on this historic trip,
Anousheh said, "1 hope to inspire
everyone — especially young peo
ple, women and young girls all over
the world... to not give up their
dreams and to pursue them." She
serves as an example of how hard
work, creativity and an open mind
can lead to success... and even a jour
ney into space.
