# Fighting racism in Israel
## British born Jew argues against discrimination of Arabs in Israel 
### MIKE DING 
Susan Nathan, author of "'lTie Other Side: My
Journey across the Arab/Jewish Divide," argued that
Israeli Arabs suffer from a culture of systematic dis
crimination and called for change in the talk "One
Woman's Attempt to Challenge Segregation and
Racism" held last night.
A British-born Jew, Nathan moved to Israel toes
cape the discrimination she experienced in Britain.
Her parents were refuges from World War 11, and
Nathan was raised as a minority, being the only Jew
in her entire school of 400 students.
"Growing up, I always felt I was living on the out
side of society," Nathan said. "It was as if the shadow
of the Holocaust was constantly hanging over my
family."
Nathan said she even experienced anti-Semitism
first hand.
"When 1 was 16,1 passed complex exams to attend
a prestigious public university in Britain, only to be

told that though my scores were satisfactory, I could
not be admitted to attend the university because the
Jewish quota had already been met." she said.
Israel had always been ingrained within her mind
as a land of safety to which she could escape in case
things in Europe ever took a turn for the worse.
Once she moved to Israel. Nathan found that her
new country also suffered from discrimination. I low
ever. this time, Jews, rather than being discriminated
against, were the ones discriminating, she said. The
Arabs of Israel suffered from severe segregation
comparable to the plight during South Africa's
apartheid, she argued.
Wanting to see the reality of such treatment.
Nathan opted to live as the only Jew in the Arab vil
lage Tamra within Israel.
According to Nathan, Palestinians have suffered
persecution at the hands of the Israeli government
since the inception of the state.
"In 1 1 )48, in order to create the Israeli state, thou
sands of Palestinians were displaced as refugees,"
she said. "There were also several notable mas
sacres of Palestinians during this time as well. Many
of the Palestinians living in Israel today are descen-

dants of those early refugees who
survived."
Such unjust treatment continues
today, she said. Jews and Arabs are
allowed to live together; however,
lor the most part, they live in com
pletely separate cities, with Jewish
cities located on the hills and Arab
ones in the lowlands.
" There are huge discrepancies in
tunding between Jewish and Arab
municipalities," she said. "Whereas
Jewish towns are well developed
cities, many Arabs live in towns with
unfinished roads, faulty streetlights,
where the streets have no names and
the houses have no numbers. ITiey
are essentially living in refugee
camps."
At times, in order for room to be
made for inhabitance by Jews, Arab
houses will be demolished without
consent from the owners, she ex
plained.
" I"he police will arrive at five in
the morning with bulldozers" she
said. "They will uive families twentv

minutes to collect a lifetime worth of
possessions and leave before their
houses are razed to the ground."
The education system is another
aspect of Israeli society that suffers
from segregation, she argued, which
remains separate and very much un
equal.
"There is grotesquely little fund
ing to Arab schools," she said. "In
fact, many of the teachers who teach
at Arab schools are decidedly unfit
to be teachers. The students know
this and they are angry about it, so
the Arab schools are generally
rowdy and unruly."
But even for those Arab citizens
who manage to graduate from top
universities, job opportunities are
still extremely limited.
"Many corporations will not hire
Arabs on the grounds that they have
not served in the Israeli military,"
she said. "1 iowever, many Arabs re
fuse to serve in the military because
they have seen their peers go
through military service and still re
ceive none of the benefits entitled to
a full citizen."
Although Arabs are nominally
allowed to vote, they suffer from an
indirect disenfranchisement, she ar
gued. because any time they speak

out against the government's unjust
practices, they are denounced as
traitors.
Nathan felt an impetus to speak
out and change her society. She said
it was her responsibility as a Jew to
improve the nation in which she
lived. However, as a woman, she had
a hard time being taken seriously in
the male-dominated Israeli politics.
" ITie primary discourse in gov
ernment is militaristic and chauvin
istic," she said.
Nathan declared that something
must be done about the system of
discrimination in Israel. She put a
large part of the blame on the gov
ernment, which played a significant
role in creating the present, segre
gated conditions.
However. Nathan made clear she
was not in opposition to the state of
Israel itself.
"I'm not here tonight to bash Is
rael," she said."l'm not here tonight
to discuss matters from an emotion
al point of view. 1 am simply present
ing the cold hard facts so that some
thing can be done to improve the
conditions of Arabs living in Israel.
It is simply unacceptable to have to
live in an ethnic state at the expense
of another ethnic group."
