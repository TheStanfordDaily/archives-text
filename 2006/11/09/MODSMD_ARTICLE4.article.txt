## Shloss unveils hidden story of Joyce's daughter 
### VAUGHAN MEYER 
1 first picked up "To Dance in
the Wake" last September. Hie
biography, written by English/
Prof. Carol Shloss, evocatively!
tells the lost story of Lucia Joyce.
James Joyce's brilliant and mas
sively understood daughter.
Shloss weaves a portrait of this ex

plosive woman with threads of forgotten history
that both captivated and haunted me. As soon as I
thought of this feature I knew that 1 had to interview
Shloss. both for her intimate knowledge of Lucia Joyce
and for the passion that so obviously evidenced itself in
"To Dance in the Wake."
When 1 asked Shloss about what drove her to discov
er Lucia's story, she told me that her first step towards
tracking down Lucia's story came at a lecture she attend
ed on the meaning of physical gesture in Joyce's work.
Shloss already knew from a footnote that Lucia had
been a dancer,and she started to wonder how Lucia, who
studied and expressed herself through gesture as a
dancer, may have affected Joyce. Shloss said that seeing
this connection gave her a "hunch" that history had over
looked an extremely relevant story centering around
Lucia and her relationship with her father.

I laving found almost no information on Lucia in the
States, Shloss traveled first to Paris.hoping to at least to
discover who her dance teachers had been. However.
Shloss found bits of Lucia all over the City of Lights.
Pictures and articles centering both on Lucia and on
her art littered the historical art archives,and the dance
scene still showed strong Lucia influences.These rem
nants showed how Lucia had besieged the Parisian art

scene with her innovative, alluring dancing and light
ning-rod personality. They showed Shloss a portrait
of a fiery woman fiercely committed to dance who
could not, and would not, be ignored. But, Shloss
wondered, how could history have "overlooked" such
an individual?
