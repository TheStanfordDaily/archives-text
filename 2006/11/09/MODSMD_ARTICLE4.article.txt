## Shloss unveils hidden story of Joyce's daughter 
### VAUGHAN MEYER 
1 first picked up "To Dance in
the Wake" last September. Hie
biography, written by English/
Prof. Carol Shloss, evocatively!
tells the lost story of Lucia Joyce.
James Joyce's brilliant and mas
sively understood daughter.
Shloss weaves a portrait of this ex

plosive woman with threads of forgotten history
that both captivated and haunted me. As soon as I
thought of this feature I knew that 1 had to interview
Shloss. both for her intimate knowledge of Lucia Joyce
and for the passion that so obviously evidenced itself in
"To Dance in the Wake."
When 1 asked Shloss about what drove her to discov
er Lucia's story, she told me that her first step towards
tracking down Lucia's story came at a lecture she attend
ed on the meaning of physical gesture in Joyce's work.
Shloss already knew from a footnote that Lucia had
been a dancer,and she started to wonder how Lucia, who
studied and expressed herself through gesture as a
dancer, may have affected Joyce. Shloss said that seeing
this connection gave her a "hunch" that history had over
looked an extremely relevant story centering around
Lucia and her relationship with her father.

I laving found almost no information on Lucia in the
States, Shloss traveled first to Paris.hoping to at least to
discover who her dance teachers had been. However.
Shloss found bits of Lucia all over the City of Lights.
Pictures and articles centering both on Lucia and on
her art littered the historical art archives,and the dance
scene still showed strong Lucia influences.These rem
nants showed how Lucia had besieged the Parisian art

scene with her innovative, alluring dancing and light
ning-rod personality. They showed Shloss a portrait
of a fiery woman fiercely committed to dance who
could not, and would not, be ignored. But, Shloss
wondered, how could history have "overlooked" such
an individual?



ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Dail
SUBTLE AND BARBARIC: English Prof. Shloss explores the life of Lucia Joyce - dancer and daugh
ter of the famed James Joyce in her biography, "To Dance in the Wake.
To find an answer, Shloss had to
travel across much of Europe and
the States, hunting old manuscripts,
letters, diaries and pictures. Most of
the Joyce family's letters on Lucia, as
well as many that Lucia herself had
written, had been destroyed. The
James Joyce Estate, owner of the
copyright to all work by Joyce, with
held most of what remained. But by
piecing together what bits and pieces
she could. Shloss discovered that the
doctors who had proclaimed Lucia
mentally ill had almost no psychi
atric basis for their claims. They
acted upon suppositions and bogus
theories that showed no strict or for
mal scientific method. With the ex
ception of her father, who appeared
to both understand and appreciate
Lucia and her intelligence, none of
Lucia's family defended her sanity
or her right to a life outside of a psy
chiatric ward. Shloss believes she
was seen as insane by a society that
had no other response to young, out
spoken woman who had many lovers
and who wanted a career.
Yet Shloss found an even darker
truth lingering in Lucia's past: she had
been sacrificed for her father's genius.

Joyce and Lucia shared not only a
strong father-daughter bond, but also
influenced each other creatively.
Lucia was the only one of Joyce's
family who intimately welcomed her
father's genius into her life and al
lowed it to influence her. Similarly,
Joyce recognized his daughter's gift
and drew from her creativity to write
his books. However, most of James
Joyce's friends and other family be
lieved that Lucia constituted a dan
gerous distraction for Joyce and that,
in order that he might realize his liter
ary potential. Lucia must not lure
away his attention. So they labeled
her mad and locked her up.
Despite all of Shloss's work,
Lucia's story must still fight to truly
come to light. The James Joyce Es
tate demanded that Shloss remove
parts of certain books and letters —
including letters that Lucia herself
had written — from her work and
threatened to sue her if she did not.
But Shloss has not finished fighting.
She decided to sue the James Joyce
estate for her right to these quotes
and documents, many of which
Shloss had to personally scour the
world to find. Lawyers from the
Stanford Law School and a handful
of prominent law firms have joined
her.
When 1 asked Shloss about what
drove her to discover Lucia's hidden
past, she mentioned both that it is

easy to be passionate about Lucia
and her story and that she felt that a
great injustice had been done — first
to Lucia and then to herself. By
bringing the truth about Lucia to
light, she could help give Lucia back
her voice — not only her rightful
place in the Joyce story, but also her
rightful place as a remarkable indi
vidual. By fighting the James Joyce
estate, she could claim her own right
as a writer to tell a story that she had
bled to unearth.
Shloss described her hunt for facts
of Lucia's life a questioning of
"whose story is important enough to
tell." No one had deemed Lucia,
though she seemed to set the very air
around her on fire, important
enough to be celebrated or even re
membered. I find it then particularly
appropriate that Shloss' and Lucia's
story launch this feature. I started
this feature because I wanted to pro
vide the Stanford community with a
source of creative inspiration. I real
ize now that I also wanted to tell the
stories of the people around me. be
cause I honestly believe that each of
our stories are important enough to
tell and that they must not be over
looked.
