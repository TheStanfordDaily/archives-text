# COMMENCEMENT
## Bill dubbed as first choice Seniors campaign to bring Clinton as Commencement speaker 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIORSTAFFWRITER 
Seniors arc taking advantage of this fall's highly charged
political atmosphere to campaign for the selection of Bill
Clinton as Commencement speaker. With a tlyering cam
paign and a popular lacebook group, the movement has
begun to gain momentum in its uphill battle against skeptics
who doubt that Stanford could snag the 42nd president.
"We have a large cross-section of alumni. GSBer's, Med
School students. Law School students and, most importantly,
seniors who support ('linton for ("ommencement." said sen
ior Shane Walker, president of the l acebook group "Clinton
for Commencement." "Overall we've had over 500 people
show explicit support, as well as others who wish us the best
but assume it to be impossible. It is not."
The group's flyers list a number of recent grievances in
cluding a "sanitized l ull Moon" and a "terrible football
team." Many people behind the movement argue that bag
ging Clinton would be a positive development in an other
wise dim school year.
"There's a mentality that it never gets any better at Stan
ford." Walker said. "Mill Clinton would give us something to
look forward to at the end of the year. After so many setbacks
and pull-backs from the year before, Clinton would be a shot
in the arm for a class that deserves it."
The initiative started to take shape in early October as a
response to last year's Commencement speaker, former
NBC anchor lom Brokaw.
"Sure Brokaw was neat,"' Walker said. "But everyone
knew the most recent and popular president in recent histo
ry. who has extremely strong ties to Stanford, was the ele
phant in the room. 1 lie seniors of last year were a mixture of
excitement at the possibility of get
ting Clinton, but it was tapered with a
sense that it was just out of reach."
Hie movement has focused on the
2001 controversy in which Clinton
was turned down to speak at his
daughter Chelsea's graduation in
favor of former Hewlett-Packard
CEO Carlv Fiorina. Some students
behind the initiative felt that this
"snub" could jeopardize Stanford's
chance of getting him in the future.
"1 understand that hindsight is
20/20," said senior Andrew
Deeringer. a member of the Clinton
Facebook group. "But it surely oc
curred to someone that they were
turning down an American presi
dent. and not just some candidate.
Since that time, Clinton has ex
pressed firm refusal to go through
that sort of fumbled process again."
Amidst these efforts, however,
some students are wary of the choice,
arguing that Clinton's presence
might trigger unnecessary partisan

conflict.
'i would love for former presi
dent Clinton to speak at my Com
mencement." said senior Milton
Solorzano. "But only on the condi
tion that he avoid using the bully pul
pit to promote Hillary or partisan
politics. 1 don't want a stump-speech
from Bill.The ceremony is about you
and me,not him and Hillary."
Instead. Solorzano said he hoped
Clinton would focus on some of his
recent environmental work.
"His organization,riding the same
'philanthropic wave' seen with the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
and Buffet grant, signals a new era of
public giving — something not seen
since Andrew Carnegie," Solorzano
said."l would love to hear his philos
ophy on how we can contribute to
this very positive movement."
Although the process of choosing
a Commencement speaker is usually
kept secret from the student body,
this year class presidents are working
to poll popular opinion.
"We've had around 400 to 500 re
sponses from seniors about Com
mencement this year," said Senior
Class President Faris Ali Mohiuddin.
"From that we present a report to the

Office of the President on the overall
input from students. They then look
through it and exhaust every avail
able resource to get these individuals
to campus."
In addition to travel and lodging
expenses, Stanford pays a small
stipend that is usually given to the
speakers charity of choice. While cost
is sometimes an issue, Mohuiddin
cited scheduling difficulties as the
main deterrent for potential speakers.
"For the big East Coast schools,
it's often much easier for a speaker to
just get in a car and drive down to the
campus for a few hours." Mohiuddin
said. "But with Stanford it's really a
weekend commitment. In some
cases, people who are invited will be
grudgingly say no only because it's
not practical."
And while students are excited by
the prospect of Clinton speaking at
Commencement.it remains for many
just that — a prospect.
"I mean, it's one thing to say we
want to have Clinton, but it's another
thing to actively flier and send emails
and hold discussions on the issue."
said senior Stephen Adams. "I'm not
holding my breath on hearing
William J. Clinton anytime soon."

some students are wary of the choice,
arguing that Clinton's presence
might trigger unnecessary partisan

conflict.
'i would love for former presi
dent Clinton to speak at my Com
mencement." said senior Milton
Solorzano. "But only on the condi
tion that he avoid using the bully pul
pit to promote Hillary or partisan
politics. 1 don't want a stump-speech
from Bill.The ceremony is about you
and me,not him and Hillary."
Instead. Solorzano said he hoped
Clinton would focus on some of his
recent environmental work.
"His organization,riding the same
'philanthropic wave' seen with the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
and Buffet grant, signals a new era of
public giving — something not seen
since Andrew Carnegie," Solorzano
said."l would love to hear his philos
ophy on how we can contribute to
this very positive movement."
Although the process of choosing
a Commencement speaker is usually
kept secret from the student body,
this year class presidents are working
to poll popular opinion.
"We've had around 400 to 500 re
sponses from seniors about Com
mencement this year," said Senior
Class President Faris Ali Mohiuddin.
"From that we present a report to the

Office of the President on the overall
input from students. They then look
through it and exhaust every avail
able resource to get these individuals
to campus."
In addition to travel and lodging
expenses, Stanford pays a small
stipend that is usually given to the
speakers charity of choice. While cost
is sometimes an issue, Mohuiddin
cited scheduling difficulties as the
main deterrent for potential speakers.
"For the big East Coast schools,
it's often much easier for a speaker to
just get in a car and drive down to the
campus for a few hours." Mohiuddin
said. "But with Stanford it's really a
weekend commitment. In some
cases, people who are invited will be
grudgingly say no only because it's
not practical."
And while students are excited by
the prospect of Clinton speaking at
Commencement.it remains for many
just that — a prospect.
"I mean, it's one thing to say we
want to have Clinton, but it's another
thing to actively flier and send emails
and hold discussions on the issue."
said senior Stephen Adams. "I'm not
holding my breath on hearing
William J. Clinton anytime soon."
