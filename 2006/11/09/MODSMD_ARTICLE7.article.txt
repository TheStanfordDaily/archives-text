## For spring break, more students choose service Alternative Spreak Break program attracts 370 applicants this year 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
While spring break may seem a speck on the horizon for
most, students that submitted their applications for Alterna
tive Spring Break (ASH) last Sunday are already thinking
about spending their vacation learning about cultural and po
litical issues. This year, the steady increase in participation
culminated with 370 applicants, an increase from 2002, when
numbers first broke 300.
ASB. celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, is offering
trips to destinations scattered across California in addition to
El Paso.Texas. Washington, D C., New Orleans, Alabama and
Georgia. It is also sponsoring a separate 1 lillel ASB trip to
New Orleans as well, bringing the total number of trips this
year to 14. But the focus of the trips has not varied much over
the years; typically, the main issues covered include health,
identity, poverty and sustainable development.
Aside from the actual trip during break, participants are
expected to enroll in a one-unit directed reading course in
their subject led by the trip leaders during winter quarter,
commit firmly to the trip for the entire break and. finally,con
tribute a post-trip reflection during spring quarter.
Senior Cammie Lee. ASB program coordinator, believes
the existence of this program has an important impact on all
aspects of the Stanford community.
"This is one of the few service-learning opportunities of
fered on-campus." she said. "And another key characteristic
of ASB is that it does not require prior service experience."
For many students who need a way into the world of jobs
and service opportunities offered by nationally and interna
tionally renowned institutions.organizations and NGOs,par
ticipating in an ASB trip is the best way to begin.
Sophomore NgocTu Ngo participated in the "Crazies and
("ripples" ASB trip last year.during which she visited govern
ment agencies, non-profit organizations and rehabilitation
centers that offered aid to the disabled. Trip members also
went to a personal help center and helped disabled people
and those affected by a loved one's disabilities to cope with
their predicaments.
"Many of us are unaware that so
many people are inflicted," she said.
"Personally, this trip's purpose was
very comforting because it we were
ever in such a situation, then we can
still be optimistic because there are
people who care and so many aid sys
tems in place."
She also praised the directed
reading component of the ASB pro
gram.
"We get to know how people live
with disabilities in their daily lives."
she said. "However, it was important
to learn the background of their con
dition through readings and movies
during winter quarter."
Lee said her main goal for the pro
gram is to expose students to service
and urge further individual participa
tion and passion for integrating pub
lic service into daily life. Ngo. who is
now involved with I laas Center serv
ice events, hopes to pursue a form of

social entrepreneurship as a future
career and has applied to this year's
social entrepreneurship ASB trip.
Under the direction of Jon Mc-
Connell. the director of Student De
velopment Programs at Haas, trip
leaders must develop their own cur
ricula and strike the fine balance be
tween study and service, serious en
deavors and fun activities, and main
taining interest.
Senior Mark Liu will lead the
Asian-American issues trip this
spring, lie argued that students are
not aware of the stereotypically 'un
characteristic' circumstances that
many Asian Americans face.
"Asian Americans are generally
seen as the 'Model Minority,'" he
said. "What people don't realize is
that this myth masks members of our
community that struggle to pay for
rent, health care and food."
I.iu hopes that participating stu
dents will work on Asian-American
issues and social justice. I lis curricu
lum centralizes around immigration
law and exclusion acts and also cov
ers issues such as labor and global
ization.
Ultimately, l.ee said she believes

that the program will instill a sense of
urgency in participants that will con
tinue when they return to'llie Farm.
Popular service programs at Stan
ford like Night Outreach. SHAC
(Stanford Homeless Action Coali
tion). Street Forum, Project AIYME
(Asian American Initiative for Youth
Motivations and Empowerment)
and countless speaker series, docu
mentaries. publications and advocacy
groups have emerged as the result of
students' ASB experiences.
Lee believes that ASB is extreme
ly crucial to promoting public-service
awareness at Stanford and attempts
to make the program as accessible as
possible to the entire undergraduate
community.
Sophomore Theresa Zhen, a first
time applicant to an ASB trip, heard
many accounts of the trips held last
year.
"A great thing about ASB is that
they design the concept and curricu
lum to comfortably suit students from
a wide variety of majors." she said.
"Engineering and humanities stu
dents can easily merge their special
ized skills to further the main cause of
the trip, which is to better society."

"We get to know how people live
with disabilities in their daily lives."
she said. "However, it was important
to learn the background of their con
dition through readings and movies
during winter quarter."
Lee said her main goal for the pro
gram is to expose students to service
and urge further individual participa
tion and passion for integrating pub
lic service into daily life. Ngo. who is
now involved with I laas Center serv
ice events, hopes to pursue a form of

social entrepreneurship as a future
career and has applied to this year's
social entrepreneurship ASB trip.
Under the direction of Jon Mc-
Connell. the director of Student De
velopment Programs at Haas, trip
leaders must develop their own cur
ricula and strike the fine balance be
tween study and service, serious en
deavors and fun activities, and main
taining interest.
Senior Mark Liu will lead the
Asian-American issues trip this
spring, lie argued that students are
not aware of the stereotypically 'un
characteristic' circumstances that
many Asian Americans face.
"Asian Americans are generally
seen as the 'Model Minority,'" he
said. "What people don't realize is
that this myth masks members of our
community that struggle to pay for
rent, health care and food."
I.iu hopes that participating stu
dents will work on Asian-American
issues and social justice. I lis curricu
lum centralizes around immigration
law and exclusion acts and also cov
ers issues such as labor and global
ization.
Ultimately, l.ee said she believes

that the program will instill a sense of
urgency in participants that will con
tinue when they return to'llie Farm.
Popular service programs at Stan
ford like Night Outreach. SHAC
(Stanford Homeless Action Coali
tion). Street Forum, Project AIYME
(Asian American Initiative for Youth
Motivations and Empowerment)
and countless speaker series, docu
mentaries. publications and advocacy
groups have emerged as the result of
students' ASB experiences.
Lee believes that ASB is extreme
ly crucial to promoting public-service
awareness at Stanford and attempts
to make the program as accessible as
possible to the entire undergraduate
community.
Sophomore Theresa Zhen, a first
time applicant to an ASB trip, heard
many accounts of the trips held last
year.
"A great thing about ASB is that
they design the concept and curricu
lum to comfortably suit students from
a wide variety of majors." she said.
"Engineering and humanities stu
dents can easily merge their special
ized skills to further the main cause of
the trip, which is to better society."
