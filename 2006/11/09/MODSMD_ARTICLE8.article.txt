### DEB RIECHMANN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — President
Bush pledged Wednesday to work
with Democrats after the "thump
ing" his party got on Election Day.
He named a new defense secretary
to oversee the war in Iraq, a change
the president said was going to hap
pen whoever won the elections.
Bush said former CIA Director
Robert Gates would replace Donald
H. Rumsfeld at the Pentagon. The
president said Rumsfeld was a "pa
triot who served this country with
honor and distinction."
Bush said he had been talking
with Rumsfeld about whether it was
time for a fresh perspective at the de
partment. and the two agreed lues
day that it was appropriate for
Rumsfeld to resign.
"He, himself, understands that
Iraq is not working well enough, fast
enough." Bush said. Hie president
planned to meet with Rumsfeld and
Gates on Wednesday afternoon in
the Oval Office.
Bush called Democratic leaders
to congratulate them on their victo
ries in Tuesday's voting and he ex
pressed both disappointment and
surprise over the election results.
He admitted that he wrongly pre
dicted a Republican victory on
Election Day.
"Actually. I thouuht we were

going to do fine yesterday, shows
what I know," Bush said. "But 1
thought we were going to he fine in
the eleetion. My point to you is that,
win or lose. Boh Gates was going to
become the nominee."
Bush seemed stoic about the elec
tion. proclaiming: "This isn't my first
rodeo."
"I recognize that many Ameri
cans voted last night to register their
displeasure with the lack of progress
being made" in Iraq, the president
said. "Yet I also believe most Ameri
cans — and leaders here in Washing
ton from both political parties — un
derstand we cannot accept defeat."
Gates led the CIA from Novem
ber 1991 to January 1993 under for
mer President George H.W. Bush.
The president said he met with Gates
over the weekend at Bush's ranch in
Crawford.Texas.
"Bob Gates will bring a fresh per
spective and great managerial expe
rience," Bush said.
Bush was asked by reporters
whether he retained lull confidence
in Vice President Dick Cheney, a
chief advocate of the war, and
whether the vice president would
serve out the rest of his term.
"Yes he does, yes he will," Bush
replied.
Yet only a week ago. Bush told The
Associated Press and other reporters
in an interview that he expected
Rumsfeld and Cheney to stay

through the end of his last two years
in the White House. Asked Wednes
day about that comment, Hush ac
knowledged he intentionally misled
reporters because he want to avoid a
change at the Pentagon during a hotly
contested election.
"1 didn't want to inject a major de
cision about this war in the final days
of a campaign," Bush said. "And so
the only way to answer that question,
and to get you onto another question
was to give you that answer.The other
reason why is I hadn't had a chance to
visit with Bob Gates yet, and I hadn't
had my final conversation with Don
Rumsfeld yet, at that point."
The president joked that he had
given I louse Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi. in line to become the first fe
male speaker of the I louse, the name
of a Republican interior decorator to
help her pick out drapes for her new
office. The comment was poke at the
California Democrat's pre-election
remark about having her pick of
Capitol suites.
As to the role played in Tuesday's
widespread GOP losses. Bush said,"l
believe Iraq had a lot to do with the
election, but 1 think there were other
factors as well." I le suggested that a
variety of congressional scandals
may also have played a role.
He said he would seek to find
common ground with Pelosi, but
without either of them compromis
ing their principles.

Bush was asked at his East Room
news conference about Pelosi's past
derogatory comments describing
him as a liar and dangerous.
"I know when campaigns end and
governing begins" he said. "If you
hold grudges in this line of work, you
never get anything done."
Bush also got in a dig at his trusted
top political adviser, Karl Rove. Rove
is widely credited with Bush's presi
dential victories in 2000 and 2004 and
GOP gains in the 2002 congressional
elections. As recently as last week.
Rove predicted Republican would

retain both I louse and Senate.
"1 obviously was working harder
in the campaign than he was," said
Bush, who stumped hard for GOP
candidates, especially troubled ones
in traditionally Republican states.
In Tuesday's elections. Democrats
recaptured control of the I louse after
12 years of GOP rule and erased the
Republican majority in the Senate.
One race remained to be decided. Vir
ginia. where Democrat James Webb
held a slight lead of Republican Sen.
George Allen.
11 Democrats win that seat, thev

would have a 51-vote majority to a
GOP49-vote minority. If Allen wins,
the next Senate would split 50-50.
Bush said he wanted to hear
other views on Iraq, and was looking
forward to recommendations by a
commission headed by former Sec
retary of State James A. Baker 111
and former Democratic Rep. Lee
Hamilton of Indiana. Bush said ex
pected to meet with the group, which
includes Gates, early next week.
Still. Bush added, "We're not
going to leave before the job is
done."
