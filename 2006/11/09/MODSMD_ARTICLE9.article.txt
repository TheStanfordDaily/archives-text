WASHINGTON â€” Democrats
completed an improbable double
barreled election sweep of Congress
on Wednesday, taking control of the
Senate with a victory in Virginia as
they padded their day-old majority
in the I louse.
Jim Webb's victory over Sen.
George Allen in Virginia assured
Democrats of 51 seats when the Sen
ate convenes in January. That
marked a gain of six in midterm elec
tions in which the war in Iraq and
President Bush were major issues.
Earlier, State Sen. Jon Tester tri
umphed over Republican Sen. Con
rad Burns in a long, late count in
Montana.
With a handful of I louse races too
close to call. Democrats had gained
28 seats, enough to regain the major
ity after 12 years of Republican rule
and place Rep. Nancy Pelosi of Cali
fornia in line to become the first fe
male speaker in history.
"It was a thumping," Bush con
ceded at the White I louse. "It's clear
the Democrat Party had a good
night."
Allen's campaign issued a state
ment noting that state officials are
conducting a canvass of the votes
cast in Tuesday's balloting.
"At the conclusion of those ef
forts. Senator George Allen plans to
make a statement regarding the out
come," it said.
It had been clear for weeks lead
ing up to the election that Democrats
were strongly positioned to challenge
Republicans for House control.

But Democats began the year
with fewer seats than at any time
since Herbert Hoover occupied the
White House. Even the party
leader. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada,
mused aloud at one point that it
might take a miracle to capture Sen
ate control.
Webb's win capped a banner elec
tion year for Democrats, who bene
fited from the voters' desire issue a
searing rebuke of the status quo.
The president, who spoke of
spending his political capital after his
successful re-election two years ago.
acknowledged, "As the head of the
Republican Party, I share a large part
of the responsibility."
With power on Capitol Hill tilt
ing. Bush faced the reality of at least
half ol Congress in the opposition's
hands for the final two years of his
presidency. He announced that De
fense Secretary Donald 11. Rumsfeld

would step down as Democrats have
demanded.
The war in Iraq, scandals in Con
gress and declining support for Bush
and Republicans on Capitol Hill de
fined the battle for House and Sen
ate control, with the public embrac
ing the Democrats' call for change to
end a decade of one-party rule in
Washington.
"This new Democratic majority
has heard the voices of the American
people," said Pelosi, the California
Democrat in line to become the na
tion's first female House speaker,
adding that Americans placed their
trust in Democrats. "We will honor
that trust. We will not disappoint."
With the GOP booted from
power, lame-duck Speaker Dennis
I lastert. R-lll.,announced he will not
run for leader of House Republicans
when Democrats take control in Jan
uary.
