## Editorial Board University should get alums online 
### 
The University should consider ex
tending benefits to Stanford gradu
ates in an attempt to increase alumni
participation Hiis can be easily and effec
tively accomplished by granting recent
Stanford graduates continued access to on
line resources.
One suggestion is to allow Stanford stu
dents to keep their email address @stan
ford.edu. Students could opt to pay a small
administrative fee to retain access to their
current email addresses.
Currently. Stanford graduates have the
option to maintain an account @stan
fordalumni.org. However, this lacks the
punch of a legitimate Stanford address.
Moreover, many of us have grown fond of
(or will eventually grow fond of) our Stan
ford email addresses and would prefer to
keep them long after we graduate.
Having a Stanford email address would
be useful for those who want to continue
scholarly research after graduation. It
would also reduce the hassle of forwarding
our email to new addresses. If nothing else,
it would guarantee continued access to our
Facebook accounts.
Another suggestion is to grant Stanford
alumni members limited access to online
resources.This would again be an opt-in sys
tem, with students paying a fee to access
JSTOR, LexisNexis and selected online
journals.
Alumni members could continue to
gain access to valuable resources that they
would not have without paying exorbitant
fees. It would be nice, for example, to have
access to the Oxford English Dictionary
online; at an annual subscription rate of
$2 1 )5 per year, the cost of maintaining an in
dividual subscription is indulgently prohib
itive.
On the other hand, the University could
help bundle costs together and capitalize on
its existing arrangements with information
vendors.This approach would lead to a win
win situation for both alumni members and
vendors. First, it would lead to significant
savings for individual users, who would not
otherwise subscribe to these services. Sec

ond. it would result in an expanded cus
tomer base and increased revenue for ven
dors.
Not all alumni members would find this
arrangement attractive or even necessary.
Those who remain in academia will contin
ue to have access to online journals and
databases anyway; others who need such re
sources for work can have their companies
pay for them. But for those others without
such resources at their disposal, such an
arrangement would be invaluable.
We are not suggesting that the Universi
ty provide these services for free, or even at
a subsidized rate. Alumni members who
wish to enjoy such services should be re
quired to pay an annual subscription fee.
Hie cost of offering these services should
not be borne by current undergraduates or
graduate students, who already have to deal
with skyrocketing tuition and living expens
es. It would cost the University some
amount of money to maintain these servic
es. but we suspect that there may well be
sufficient interest in these services to justify
am additional costs incurred by the admin
istration.
Nor are we suggesting that the Universi
ty offer complete access to all its online re
sources. Rather, it can offer a multi-tiered
fee structure, much like a cable television
company. Alumni members could keep
their email addresses and select five of their
favorite online databases and journals for a
flat fee.
Nevertheless, it would be disingenuous
for the University to gouge alumni mem
bers keen on maintaining strong ties with
their alma mater. As such, the University
should earn only modest profits required to
support these programs.
In any case, the University stands to
profit enormously from such arrangements.
Programs like these would generate im
mense goodwill on the part of Stanford
graduates and possibly lead to increased
alumni donations. Thus, the University
should seriously consider implementing
such programs to reap the benefits of in
creased alumni participation.
