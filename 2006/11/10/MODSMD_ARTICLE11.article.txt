# The 						history of the Draw
## 
### 
Back in 1891, California was still part of
the Wild West. Stanford housing as
signments were made accordingly.
Starting in 1892, each roommate pair faced
off in a duel. They had to walk thirty paces
from each other, draw their guns and shoot.
The person left standing was guaranteed
housing for his or her second year, and the
other one was dead. This is how housing as
signments became known as "the Draw."
Eugenicist David Starr Jordan was a big
fan of the Draw because the poor, the effem
inate and the effete generally lost. Since Jane
Stanford was against anything that Jordan
supported, she opposed the killings, calling
them "very weird."
When her husband died in 1893, Jane de
cided to guarantee housing for everyone
based on a random selection system. Ameri
ca didn't have lotteries back in 1893. but they
did have picnic basket auctions, wherein
women made picnic baskets that men bought
at a charity auction. The highest bidder won
the basket, the girl who made it and a bottle
of 1 .evitra.This was Jane's inspiration for the
new Draw.
Roommates were paired according to
auction bids. There were some kinks in the
system, though, since all of the picnic bas
ket-makers were women and all of the bid
ders were men. ITie LGBT center on cam
pus tried to support women bidding for
other women but couldn't do it under the
strictures of the law. At that time, females
were not allowed to be in public with more
than a Susan B. Anthony dollar on them.
ITiis was ironic.
Because of these auctions, Jane Stanford
unwittingly became responsible for the first
co-ed housing on campus. When the admin
istration sorted out the mess, they acciden
tally left a girl named Lou Henry in a one
room double with Herbert Hoover, not
knowing she was female. After the scan
dalous 1895 "Screw Your Roommate"
dance incident in which the couple took the
title literally, I lerbert and Lou were forced to
marry.
Starting in the 19205, the Draw became
more similar to the experience we know and

love today. I"he housing department set up an
extremely large bowl in the Quad and filled it
with numbered balls. They put flasks of gin
and jazz records at the bottom of the bowl as
incentives for students to dive in for their
numbers.
During World War 11. there was a military
training base on Stanford campus. Venereal
diseases were rampant. Students were as
signed numbers based on their type of dis
ease and how close to Cowell Health Center
(now Vaden) they needed to be. This is when
the sororities were moved to the Cowell
Cluster.
During the Vietnam War. the Draw be
came a random number lottery system.
Many students mistakenly thought they were
being assigned their draft numbers and fled
to Canada.
With the fall of the Berlin Wall, former
communists were allowed to come to Stan
ford. In 1989, they rigged the computer system
so that it gave everyone the same draw num
ber. Students started taking to the streets
when they were all assigned to Flo Mo.
Hi at same year. God sent the Loma Prieta
earthquake to punish the communists. The
University's biggest loss was in the damage
to the church, inciting the following Stanford
Daily quote from the communists: "Neener,
neener. I"he joke's on You."
From that point on, the Draw has been
completely fair and unbiased. In 1998,
Chelsea Clinton got a 2409 and lived on the
row in Xanadu for the next three years.
