Imagine, if you will, the following scenario.
When you have a paper to write, you have
three options for computer access —
your room, a cluster or the library. If you
want to make plans, get directions or talk to
someone who's not standing beside you. you
head to your dorm room and hope that the
person you're calling is home too. When you
want to set the mood, you can either turn on
the radio or put a legally purchased CD in the
boombox. Oh, and when you need to take
notes in class, you pull out a pen and a spiral
notebook, then try to listen, think and scrib
ble at the same time.
Sounds horribly inconvenient, doesn't it?
Believe it or not. though, these confining cir
cumstances describe life as I knew it only six
years ago. Amazing how technology flies.
Now. as I sit in an off-campus cafe, typing on
a laptop while listening to my iPod in order to
drown out the man next to me on the cell
phone, 1 wonder: What have we given up in
the name of convenience?
In Y2K. the tech-speak term for the year
2000, 1 arrived on campus with two large
machines in tow: my gigantic bright-blue
iMac and a matching bicycle. Inside my
10x10 cube in Larkin, my roommate and I
agreed to split the cost of a landline, then
splurged on a cordless phone that would
allow us to make calls from as far away as
the stairwell just outside our door (provided
it was ajar).
Born and raised without a television, 1
have never been ahead of the technological
curve, but 1 was hardly alone in my anxiety
about a new service called "Napster." Un
like certain conscientious individuals, how
ever, my decision not to install the music
sharing software was not an ideological one;
copyright infringement meant nothing to
me, but the nightmare of corrupted files did.
In retrospect, of course, I might re-run the
cost-benefit analysis of this decision — high
ly unlikely potential virus then versus hun

dreds of thousands of free songs n0w....
Tough choice.
While my roommate downloaded every
eighties song I'd never heard, 1 dedicated my
online time to another relatively new inven
tion. In a brilliant PR move, AOL made its
unique instant messenger service AIM avail
able free of charge (yes, there was a time
when you had to be a dues-paying member).
Keeping tabs on my friends across the coun
try was fun, but I drew the line when my next
door neighbor struck up a conversation. I
could practically hear him typing on the
other side of the wall.
Alongside its social benefits, AIM also
presented the first of many opportunities to
practice multitasking in its new tech-driven
form. It took several months, but I eventual
ly learned how to carry on two. sometimes
three, conversations at once. However, I
soon realized that, while I viewed every in
teraction as a full-blown tete-a-tete, most
people were chatting with a half-dozen peo
ple while answering email and while playing
online chess. Waiting on the edge of my desk
chair for a three-letter abbreviated re
sponse. I not only felt anxious, I also actually
felt less connected to the people on the other
end.
By sophomore year. Napster was en
meshed in lawsuits and my AIM use had
dwindled to nothing. But the tech world has
a way of reinventing itself. Up next: the lux
urious, independence-threatening, cancer
causing cell phone. I could now walk, talk

and read The Daily at the same time, a truly
wonderful, if life-imperiling, feat. My initial
compromise — 1 would turn the phone off
whenever my full attention might really he
needed — soon gave way to an insatiable
desire to know who might call. Besides, what
else was I supposed to do with my non-steer
ing hand?
As often happens with objects we carry
everywhere, my cell phone gradually be
came an extension of myself. 1 do not know
at what point I stopped memorizing people's
numbers, hut when I misplaced my little
piece of plastic for a very lonely and panic
filled 48 hours, 1 realized that, without the
aid of my brain's newest extension. 1 would
only be able to call two places for the rest of
my life. It's a good thing 1 love my high
school best friend's parents as well as my
own.
Junior year brought with it my next theo
retically freeing technological advance. With
my sexy new laptop, 1 could work anywhere
on campus — in the CoHo, in the Quad, in
the back of the classroom.... Now. 1 am sure
many of my fellow laptop-users can check
Gmail/Wikipedia/Facebook while taking
substantive notes/listening attentively, but
my old-fashioned brain is simply not trained
to multitask that effectively.The unmitigated
fear that 1 might miss something really im
portant (as well as the weight factor) means
that my new laptop generally resided in the
same place as its predecessor — front and
center on my desk.
But despite its desk-bound fate, my laptop
also worked its way into my device depend
ency. By mid-November of my senior year,
with job applications and a 100 page thesis in
full swing, my aptly-named ThinkPad had be
come part and parcel of my writing process.
In a moment 1 have replayed hundreds of
times since. I spilled the teensiest, tiniest bit

on my own form of a breakdown.
Forget about plastic and wire — my
hard drive is comprised of my blood,
sweat and tears.
For all of my fears about sensory
overload, social ADD and physical
safety, though. 1 would be loathe to
return to the time before Google
was a verb and the Facebook was
something other than a physical
book of embarrassing high-school
senior portraits. Despite its potential
drawbacks, technology has undoubt

edly made life eaer for paper writers,
social butterflies and procrastinators
alike, and 1 count myself a member
of at least two of the previous cate
gories. I cannot imagine writing
without my laptop, driving without
my hybrid Honda Civic or running
without my Nano, and not just be
cause they make life easy — they
make life fun. At the sme time, how
ever. I write to be read, drive to meet
friends and run to play sports. For me
at least, it's the human interactions
enabled by technology that make it
all worthwhile.
