## The 						Public Editor 
### 
Who knew that a feature I lauded two
weeks ago would become such a
headache for The Daily a week later?
In my last column. I mentioned that the new
online anonymous commenting element of
The Daily was a great development because it
provided a forum for discussion about stories
and campus issues, without moderation or
control by editors or inhibition stemming
from poster reluctance to use one's name.
This new feature allows both for uncen
sored criticism or approval of Daily articles
and for open and immediate dialogue. Two
key results emerge from this. In the former in
stance, the public serves as editors for The
Daily by refining or verifying the accuracy of
stories and offering insight and advice regard
ing reader concerns. In the latter instance.The
Daily enters the fray of interactive journalism
and leaves behind the old-fashioned,one-way
communication that has characterized jour
nalism up until very recently.
Part of being on the cutting-edge, howev
er. involves trial and error.The Daily experi
ences the glitches that occur as the media test
this new medium, alongside newspapers such
as The Washington Post and The San Jose
Mercury News — while other papers, such as
The New York Times, have so far waited and
watched from the sidelines.
One such hiccup arose last week when
readers responded to a letter to the editor by
posting comments about the writer that

roughly ranged from uncivil to vicious and
crude. It is one thing to attack The Daily and
its articles in a public forum and another to
personally attack a student, especially one
not on The Daily's staff and who merely
wrote a letter to the editor.
By and large, posters on 'I"he Daily's Web
site have expressed their opinions intelli
gently, passionately and civilly. But this in
stance showed just how much the anonymity
of online posting can be abused.
As the system currently works, a poster
must supply a name (or title or phrase) be
neath which the comment will appear. He or
she must also supply an email address, but
this address is never publicly displayed. The
comment then appears on the page, with no
filtration or censorship or editorial oversight.
While editors do monitor the Web site, The
Daily has not yet hired a Web editor whose
sole job would be to supervise the online con
tent and potentially act as a screen.
Whether a screen would even be desir
able. however, is a question over which jour
nalists disagree. Some argue that since a jour
nalist's job is to make judgments, he must do
so regardless of the forum for communica
tion and that he should not lower his stan
dards for online content. Others argue that
the days of controlled conversation are over
and that a journalist's job should be to enable
and foster multi-way communication, not to
mimic a letters to the editor section online by

hand-selecting comments and editing them
for accuracy and merit.
Regardless, ITie Daily clearly must imple
ment some sort of mechanism to address the
power that accompanies the ability to post
anonymously. Taking potshots at writers
without adding anything credible or worth
while to the discussion is unacceptable. Just
as clear, I think, is the value of preserving the
anonymity feature. It encourages people to
express themselves assertively and without
worrying about their comments showing up
on a Google search by a potential employer.
Further, this aspect is standard for online
newspaper commenting.
Fortunately. The Daily plans to introduce
one of two remedies by the end of next week.
Hopefully, a flagging system will emerge
through which anyone reading online can
mark a comment as offensive. Editors will
then review the comment and remove it if
they agree that it should not be online. Less
ideally, the staff will apply a delay to the com
ment feature, giving the editors a chance to
read a poster s remarks and ensure they are
not offensive before putting them online.
Either way, the editors should create and
make known a policy of what constitutes an
offensive comment, ft may often be a subjec
tive determination but objective criteria
should be established. They need to be able
io justih the comments that they
ilUnv on the Web site, and readers
■should know the rationale behind
these decisions so that they can
make their own judgments about
a hat to try to post.
Admittedly. I'he Daily should
lave foreseen the likelihood of the
vVeb comments feature getting out of
•ontrol and being used for personal
ittacks Strapped for resources and
r\ ing to adjust to a Web site that was
ompleteh overhauled this summer,
lowever. the stall merits some un-
Jerstanding. And as soon as the edi
ois realized how vitriolic the com
nents had become, they did a good
ob of damage control, considering
heir technological and staff limita
ions, b\ deleting offensive posts and
costing a warning on the page that
;omments tud gotten out of line. It
ilso is simply a byproduct of technol
>gy that we are all now much more
.usceptible to broadh based public
lttack but that doesn't excuse
.uch attacks, and I"he Daily must do
hat it can to discourage them. Rest
issured that it intends to.
I inally. to follow up on the issue
»i Israeli Palestinian coverage that 1

addressed in my last column, there
have been more complaints that The
Daily's coverage perhaps reflects a
pro-Palestinian bias. Yesterday's ar
ticle. "Fighting racism in Israel," on a
speaker event expressing views criti
cal of Israel's treatment of Arabs
within its borders, failed to cover any
of the audience's perspective or to
treat any point of view that was not
that of the speaker. This is poor re
porting, but hardly indicative of bias
on a large scale.The Daily also failed
to cover an event that was pro-Israel
that fell on Election Day. but all of its
resources were devoted to election
coverage that night. This omission
was neither an oversight nor a con
scious choice, but merely reflected
office realities. Additionally, repeat
ed emails to Hillel from the News
Department requesting information
about upcoming events have gone
unanswered. Nonetheless, by the
end of the year the coverage should
balance out, as it typically does. It
may seem lopsided now, but that is
certainly not intentional, and it will
change.

Who knew that a feature I lauded two
weeks ago would become such a
headache for The Daily a week later?
In my last column. I mentioned that the new
online anonymous commenting element of
The Daily was a great development because it
provided a forum for discussion about stories
and campus issues, without moderation or
control by editors or inhibition stemming
from poster reluctance to use one's name.
This new feature allows both for uncen
sored criticism or approval of Daily articles
and for open and immediate dialogue. Two
key results emerge from this. In the former in
stance, the public serves as editors for The
Daily by refining or verifying the accuracy of
stories and offering insight and advice regard
ing reader concerns. In the latter instance.The
Daily enters the fray of interactive journalism
and leaves behind the old-fashioned,one-way
communication that has characterized jour
nalism up until very recently.
Part of being on the cutting-edge, howev
er. involves trial and error.The Daily experi
ences the glitches that occur as the media test
this new medium, alongside newspapers such
as The Washington Post and The San Jose
Mercury News — while other papers, such as
The New York Times, have so far waited and
watched from the sidelines.
One such hiccup arose last week when
readers responded to a letter to the editor by
posting comments about the writer that

roughly ranged from uncivil to vicious and
crude. It is one thing to attack The Daily and
its articles in a public forum and another to
personally attack a student, especially one
not on The Daily's staff and who merely
wrote a letter to the editor.
By and large, posters on 'I"he Daily's Web
site have expressed their opinions intelli
gently, passionately and civilly. But this in
stance showed just how much the anonymity
of online posting can be abused.
As the system currently works, a poster
must supply a name (or title or phrase) be
neath which the comment will appear. He or
she must also supply an email address, but
this address is never publicly displayed. The
comment then appears on the page, with no
filtration or censorship or editorial oversight.
While editors do monitor the Web site, The
Daily has not yet hired a Web editor whose
sole job would be to supervise the online con
tent and potentially act as a screen.
Whether a screen would even be desir
able. however, is a question over which jour
nalists disagree. Some argue that since a jour
nalist's job is to make judgments, he must do
so regardless of the forum for communica
tion and that he should not lower his stan
dards for online content. Others argue that
the days of controlled conversation are over
and that a journalist's job should be to enable
and foster multi-way communication, not to
mimic a letters to the editor section online by

hand-selecting comments and editing them
for accuracy and merit.
Regardless, ITie Daily clearly must imple
ment some sort of mechanism to address the
power that accompanies the ability to post
anonymously. Taking potshots at writers
without adding anything credible or worth
while to the discussion is unacceptable. Just
as clear, I think, is the value of preserving the
anonymity feature. It encourages people to
express themselves assertively and without
worrying about their comments showing up
on a Google search by a potential employer.
Further, this aspect is standard for online
newspaper commenting.
Fortunately. The Daily plans to introduce
one of two remedies by the end of next week.
Hopefully, a flagging system will emerge
through which anyone reading online can
mark a comment as offensive. Editors will
then review the comment and remove it if
they agree that it should not be online. Less
ideally, the staff will apply a delay to the com
ment feature, giving the editors a chance to
read a poster s remarks and ensure they are
not offensive before putting them online.
Either way, the editors should create and
make known a policy of what constitutes an
offensive comment, ft may often be a subjec
tive determination but objective criteria
should be established. They need to be able
io justih the comments that they
ilUnv on the Web site, and readers
■should know the rationale behind
these decisions so that they can
make their own judgments about
a hat to try to post.

I inally. to follow up on the issue
»i Israeli Palestinian coverage that 1

addressed in my last column, there
have been more complaints that The
Daily's coverage perhaps reflects a
pro-Palestinian bias. Yesterday's ar
ticle. "Fighting racism in Israel," on a
speaker event expressing views criti
cal of Israel's treatment of Arabs
within its borders, failed to cover any
of the audience's perspective or to
treat any point of view that was not
that of the speaker. This is poor re
porting, but hardly indicative of bias
on a large scale.The Daily also failed
to cover an event that was pro-Israel
that fell on Election Day. but all of its
resources were devoted to election
coverage that night. This omission
was neither an oversight nor a con
scious choice, but merely reflected
office realities. Additionally, repeat
ed emails to Hillel from the News
Department requesting information
about upcoming events have gone
unanswered. Nonetheless, by the
end of the year the coverage should
balance out, as it typically does. It
may seem lopsided now, but that is
certainly not intentional, and it will
change.
