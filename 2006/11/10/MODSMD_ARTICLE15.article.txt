## Sizing up the Pac-10 talent 
### 
Football season is (thankfully) coming to a
close. Basketball is just around the corner,
and 1 couldn't be more ready for another ex
citing year of Pac-10 hoops.
This year will see an influx of talented youth, as
the conference welcomes a heralded class of incom
ing freshmen — including McDonald's Americans
like Washington's Spencer Hawes, UCLA's James
Keefe and Arizona's Chase Budinger —to go
along with the returning sophomores who will rule
the league — including Washington's Jon Brock
man. UCLA's Luc Richard Mbah a Moute and Ari
zona's Marcus Williams.
In any case, the Cardinal will have its hands full
with the individual talent that pervades the confer
ence. Here are the Pac-10 players I'm keeping my
eye on this season.
Malik Hairston, Oregon, Jt
When 1 lairston first set foot on the University of
Oregon's campus as a freshman two years ago. he
claimed that he wanted to "Carmelo-ize" the
Ducks. Things haven't gone exactly as planned for
Hairston and coach Ernie Kent's squad, who fin
ished with a losing record last season.That said, the
6-foot-6 athletic wing was one of the lone bright
spots on a team that under-performed all season
long. Hairston is a smooth, athletic player with
range that extends to the three-point line. His
biggest task this season will not be leading the
Ducks in scoring (the junior averaged over 15
points per game last season), but whether he can
lead the Ducks previously underachieving squad to
a successful season.
Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, UCLA, So.
Last season's Pac-10 Freshman of the Year made
a splash on one of the biggest stages in all of college
hoops after his dominating performance against
LSU in the National Semi-Final. Mbah a Moute,
who is listed at 6-foot-8 and 230 pounds, has only
been playing basketball for six years. Despite his
relative inexperience, he plays with the kind of
knowledge and knack for the game that only a spe
cial few possess. The Cameroon native, a prince in
his home country, jumps the passing lanes with
adept instinct and has an uncanny ability to re
bound and finish around the rim. If this sophomore
forward is able to get to the rim off the dribble and
develop a solid jump-shot from 15 to 18 feet out,
watch out.
Marcus Williams, Arizona, So.
Williams is a silky-smooth player with a game
similar to Hairston's. He has the ability to take
other, less athletic wing players off the dribble and
has range that extends beyond the arc. Many dis
pute whether he or Mbah a Moute should have won
the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year title last season.
Those who argued for this play-making Wildcat
definitely have a case. Williams averaged over 13
points during his freshman campaign with the Wild
cats.and 1 would expect to see him play a larger role
in the offense this season. McDonald's All-Ameri
can Chase Budinger (read on!) will have plenty to
say about that, though.
Jon Brockman, Washington, So.
Brockman was a solid force for the I luskies as a
freshman, averaging eight points and six rebounds
a game. He will move up to a permanent starting
role with Washington's loss of power forward
Bobby Jones to the NBA. Brockman. who is built
like an ox. is the kind of player who is ripe for a
break-out season. Playing alongside highly-touted
