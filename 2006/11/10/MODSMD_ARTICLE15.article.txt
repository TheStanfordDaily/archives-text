## Sizing up the Pac-10 talent 
### 
Football season is (thankfully) coming to a
close. Basketball is just around the corner,
and 1 couldn't be more ready for another ex
citing year of Pac-10 hoops.
This year will see an influx of talented youth, as
the conference welcomes a heralded class of incom
ing freshmen — including McDonald's Americans
like Washington's Spencer Hawes, UCLA's James
Keefe and Arizona's Chase Budinger —to go
along with the returning sophomores who will rule
the league — including Washington's Jon Brock
man. UCLA's Luc Richard Mbah a Moute and Ari
zona's Marcus Williams.
In any case, the Cardinal will have its hands full
with the individual talent that pervades the confer
ence. Here are the Pac-10 players I'm keeping my
eye on this season.
Malik Hairston, Oregon, Jt
When 1 lairston first set foot on the University of
Oregon's campus as a freshman two years ago. he
claimed that he wanted to "Carmelo-ize" the
Ducks. Things haven't gone exactly as planned for
Hairston and coach Ernie Kent's squad, who fin
ished with a losing record last season.That said, the
6-foot-6 athletic wing was one of the lone bright
spots on a team that under-performed all season
long. Hairston is a smooth, athletic player with
range that extends to the three-point line. His
biggest task this season will not be leading the
Ducks in scoring (the junior averaged over 15
points per game last season), but whether he can
lead the Ducks previously underachieving squad to
a successful season.
Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, UCLA, So.
Last season's Pac-10 Freshman of the Year made
a splash on one of the biggest stages in all of college
hoops after his dominating performance against
LSU in the National Semi-Final. Mbah a Moute,
who is listed at 6-foot-8 and 230 pounds, has only
been playing basketball for six years. Despite his
relative inexperience, he plays with the kind of
knowledge and knack for the game that only a spe
cial few possess. The Cameroon native, a prince in
his home country, jumps the passing lanes with
adept instinct and has an uncanny ability to re
bound and finish around the rim. If this sophomore
forward is able to get to the rim off the dribble and
develop a solid jump-shot from 15 to 18 feet out,
watch out.
Marcus Williams, Arizona, So.
Williams is a silky-smooth player with a game
similar to Hairston's. He has the ability to take
other, less athletic wing players off the dribble and
has range that extends beyond the arc. Many dis
pute whether he or Mbah a Moute should have won
the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year title last season.
Those who argued for this play-making Wildcat
definitely have a case. Williams averaged over 13
points during his freshman campaign with the Wild
cats.and 1 would expect to see him play a larger role
in the offense this season. McDonald's All-Ameri
can Chase Budinger (read on!) will have plenty to
say about that, though.
Jon Brockman, Washington, So.
Brockman was a solid force for the I luskies as a
freshman, averaging eight points and six rebounds
a game. He will move up to a permanent starting
role with Washington's loss of power forward
Bobby Jones to the NBA. Brockman. who is built
like an ox. is the kind of player who is ripe for a
break-out season. Playing alongside highly-touted


Salisbury
Above the Rim
freshman center Spencer Hawes
will only be beneficial for Brock
man. He's a beast around the rim
and the antithesis of soft. Expect big
numbers from this 1 lusky.
Nick Young, USC 112 Jr.
Young doesn't get as much atten
tion as many of the other top players
in the league, but don't be fooled.
I"he junior swingman is a talent, no
matter how bad his hair is (he sport
ed a fro-hawk for all last season).
Young is 6-foot-8 and possesses the
kind of athleticism that makes both
fans and coaches drool. USC Coach
Tim Floyd will rely on the wing to
guide a Trojan team that could very
well make the NCAA Tournament
this season.
Chase Budinger, Arizona, Fr.
ITiere is a reason why Budinger is
the only freshman that i included on
this list. The 6-foot-8 redhead may
be the most heralded incoming
freshman in the history of Arizona
basketball. Even legendary coach
Lute Olson has said that Budinger is
the best freshman he has ever re
cruited.The forward is an all-around
athlete and can shoot the lights out:
he won co-MVP honors at the Mc-
Donald's All-American game this
past March. The hype surrounding
Budinger may be a little excessive
for a college freshman, but all signs
point to this kid being the real deal.
Note that none of the players 1
listed is a senior. The west coast is
going to see a lot of fun basketball
over the next few years.
As for who's going to win the
conference, 1 have no choice but to
go with the media-favorite UCLA
Bruins. Coach Ben Howland has
built something special in West
wood.

Jack Salisbury is a freshman. Email

over the next few years.
As for who's going to win the
conference, 1 have no choice but to
go with the media-favorite UCLA
Bruins. Coach Ben Howland has
built something special in West
wood.

Football season is (thankfully) coming to a
close. Basketball is just around the corner,
and 1 couldn't be more ready for another ex
citing year of Pac-10 hoops.
This year will see an influx of talented youth, as
the conference welcomes a heralded class of incom
ing freshmen — including McDonald's Americans
like Washington's Spencer Hawes, UCLA's James
Keefe and Arizona's Chase Budinger —to go
along with the returning sophomores who will rule
the league — including Washington's Jon Brock
man. UCLA's Luc Richard Mbah a Moute and Ari
zona's Marcus Williams.
In any case, the Cardinal will have its hands full
with the individual talent that pervades the confer
ence. Here are the Pac-10 players I'm keeping my
eye on this season.
Malik Hairston, Oregon, Jt
When 1 lairston first set foot on the University of
Oregon's campus as a freshman two years ago. he
claimed that he wanted to "Carmelo-ize" the
Ducks. Things haven't gone exactly as planned for
Hairston and coach Ernie Kent's squad, who fin
ished with a losing record last season.That said, the
6-foot-6 athletic wing was one of the lone bright
spots on a team that under-performed all season
long. Hairston is a smooth, athletic player with
range that extends to the three-point line. His
biggest task this season will not be leading the
Ducks in scoring (the junior averaged over 15
points per game last season), but whether he can
lead the Ducks previously underachieving squad to
a successful season.
Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, UCLA, So.
Last season's Pac-10 Freshman of the Year made
a splash on one of the biggest stages in all of college
hoops after his dominating performance against
LSU in the National Semi-Final. Mbah a Moute,
who is listed at 6-foot-8 and 230 pounds, has only
been playing basketball for six years. Despite his
relative inexperience, he plays with the kind of
knowledge and knack for the game that only a spe
cial few possess. The Cameroon native, a prince in
his home country, jumps the passing lanes with
adept instinct and has an uncanny ability to re
bound and finish around the rim. If this sophomore
forward is able to get to the rim off the dribble and
develop a solid jump-shot from 15 to 18 feet out,
watch out.
Marcus Williams, Arizona, So.
Williams is a silky-smooth player with a game
similar to Hairston's. He has the ability to take
other, less athletic wing players off the dribble and
has range that extends beyond the arc. Many dis
pute whether he or Mbah a Moute should have won
the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year title last season.
Those who argued for this play-making Wildcat
definitely have a case. Williams averaged over 13
points during his freshman campaign with the Wild
cats.and 1 would expect to see him play a larger role
in the offense this season. McDonald's All-Ameri
can Chase Budinger (read on!) will have plenty to
say about that, though.
Jon Brockman, Washington, So.
Brockman was a solid force for the I luskies as a
freshman, averaging eight points and six rebounds
a game. He will move up to a permanent starting
role with Washington's loss of power forward
Bobby Jones to the NBA. Brockman. who is built
like an ox. is the kind of player who is ripe for a
break-out season. Playing alongside highly-touted


Salisbury
Above the Rim
freshman center Spencer Hawes
will only be beneficial for Brock
man. He's a beast around the rim
and the antithesis of soft. Expect big
numbers from this 1 lusky.
Nick Young, USC 112 Jr.
Young doesn't get as much atten
tion as many of the other top players
in the league, but don't be fooled.
I"he junior swingman is a talent, no
matter how bad his hair is (he sport
ed a fro-hawk for all last season).
Young is 6-foot-8 and possesses the
kind of athleticism that makes both
fans and coaches drool. USC Coach
Tim Floyd will rely on the wing to
guide a Trojan team that could very
well make the NCAA Tournament
this season.
Chase Budinger, Arizona, Fr.
ITiere is a reason why Budinger is
the only freshman that i included on
this list. The 6-foot-8 redhead may
be the most heralded incoming
freshman in the history of Arizona
basketball. Even legendary coach
Lute Olson has said that Budinger is
the best freshman he has ever re
cruited.The forward is an all-around
athlete and can shoot the lights out:
he won co-MVP honors at the Mc-
Donald's All-American game this
past March. The hype surrounding
Budinger may be a little excessive
for a college freshman, but all signs
point to this kid being the real deal.
Note that none of the players 1
listed is a senior. The west coast is
going to see a lot of fun basketball
over the next few years.

conference, 1 have no choice but to
go with the media-favorite UCLA
