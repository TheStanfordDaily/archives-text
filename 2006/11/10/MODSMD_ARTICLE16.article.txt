# SoCal Showdown
## NO. 2 CARD WELCOME USC, UCLA TO THE FARM 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Women's volleyball in the Paeific-10 Confer
ence is always a battle, but this weekend the
stakes are higher than ever. No. 2 Stanford hosts
No. 6 USC and No. 5 UCLA on Friday and Sat
urday in a clash of the league's best. Among
them, the three schools have won 12 NCAA
championships, including four of the hist five.
"I think there should be a good number ot
people watching in a great facility with great
teams playing," Stanford head coach John Dun
ning said. "And these games really mean some
thing— the Pac-10 title race will definitely be
affected this weekend."
When Stanford (20-2,11-1 Pac-10) played the
Bruins(24-2,1 l-2)andTrojans(2l-3.10-3)on the
road earlier this year, the Cardinal handed each
their first loss of the season, both times in front of
raucous home crowds.
"When we got to that week, we didn't know
how good we were, and we wanted to show our
selves just how well we could play," Dunning said.
"It was exciting and a great challenge. We knew
that they were undefeated and we were playing on
their court. Wecame in excited and well prepared."
While this weekend's crowds may not reach
the reported 5000 who saw the USC match in
October, the Cardinal hope to pack Maples for
these crucial matches. Student admission will be
free for both matches, and faculty and staff will
get in for $2 Saturday. For such low admissions
fees, the fans should get quite a show.
Since those last meetings, the Cardinal have
not lost a match, most recently beating No. 12 Cal
ifornia on the road. Both UCLA and USC lost in
Seattle to No. 4 Washington, and the Bruins beat
the Trojans when they went head-to-head.
"1 don't think that they are any more beat
able now [than in Los Angeles], except for the
fact that, when you are undefeated, it doesn't
cross your mind that you can lose," Dunning
said. "They are good teams with good players
and well-coached and they are still confident,
but have some doubt this time.since we already
played and won on their court."
The Cardinal spoiled the opening of USC's
Galen Center, stunning the previously unde
feated Trojans with a three-game sweep, 30-20,

30-26,30-28. Sophomore outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza led Stanford with 1 <S kills, two aces and
14 digs. Sophomore middle blocker Foluke Ak
inradewo and senior outside hitter Kristin
Richards chipped in 12 each and junior middle
blocker Franci Girard notched 10 along with a
team-high five blocks.
Asia Kaczor had a team-high 15 kills for the
Trojans and All-American libero Debora Seil
hammer led all players with 21 digs.
Against the Bruins the next night. Barboza and
Richards again spearheaded the Stanford offense,
recording 21 kills each in the five game (30-27,27-
30,25-30,30-25,15-10) victory. Akinradewo con
tributed IS kills and seven blocks, while Richards
played phenomenal defense to finish with 2h digs.
Junior setter Bryn Kehoe dished out 66 assists
while her team hit .3(X) in the match.
Katie Carter led the Bruins with 19 kills, and
Nana Meriwether, just named Pac-10 Player of
the Week for the third time in 2006, had 17.
"With any team in the top 10 and even deep
er than that, there is usually someone you will
think is the best and is the most talked about,"
Dunning said. "[Kaczor and Meriwether] are
the players who get the most focus on those
teams, but any top team will have a handful of
great players. So you have to do your best to stop
those two, but you can't worry about just one
person — they may do their damage, but you
just have to play your best."
The Cardinal s best has been pretty good lately.
The team's .302 hitting percentage is the third best
in the nation and Akinradewo, hitting .444 is fifth
among individuals (Meriwether leads Division I
hitting at a .483 clip). Since returning from south
ern California, Stanford has scored four sweeps
and a four-game win last Friday in Berkeley.
"Last week's practice was unusual," Dun
ning explained. "Because we had been pushing
so hard for so long, playing high-level matches,
traveling and tons of school work — midterms
were really piling up on our team — we only
had one full team practice. 1 thought we were
road warriors, but played a step slower than we
had been. But there is nothing I think needs to
be changed from the weekend."

leads the Cardinal with 313 kills and
31 aces while Akinradewo has a
team-high % blocks. Kehoe is aver
aging 13.03 assists per game and
sophomore libero Jessica Fishburn
has tallied 263 digs. Richards, who is
second in defense with 203 digs, is
only six away from the all-time
record at Stanford, set by four-time
All-American Kristin Klein.'92.

"When people accomplish amaz
ing things,you owe it to them to pay at
tention." Dunning said. "It's just part
of what happens when you play at this
level, but she should be applauded be
cause it is quite an accomplishment.
She is a great player and we are happy
for her — she deserves it."
In addition to the free admission
for students. Stanford has made Sat

have the opportunity pledge money
to the Susan G. Komen Breast Can

thing— the Pac-10 title race will definitely be
affected this weekend."
When Stanford (20-2,11-1 Pac-10) played the
Bruins(24-2,1 l-2)andTrojans(2l-3.10-3)on the
road earlier this year, the Cardinal handed each
their first loss of the season, both times in front of
raucous home crowds.
"When we got to that week, we didn't know
how good we were, and we wanted to show our
selves just how well we could play," Dunning said.
"It was exciting and a great challenge. We knew
that they were undefeated and we were playing on
their court. Wecame in excited and well prepared."
While this weekend's crowds may not reach
the reported 5000 who saw the USC match in
October, the Cardinal hope to pack Maples for
these crucial matches. Student admission will be
free for both matches, and faculty and staff will
get in for $2 Saturday. For such low admissions
fees, the fans should get quite a show.
Since those last meetings, the Cardinal have
not lost a match, most recently beating No. 12 Cal
ifornia on the road. Both UCLA and USC lost in
Seattle to No. 4 Washington, and the Bruins beat
the Trojans when they went head-to-head.
"1 don't think that they are any more beat
able now [than in Los Angeles], except for the
fact that, when you are undefeated, it doesn't
cross your mind that you can lose," Dunning
said. "They are good teams with good players
and well-coached and they are still confident,
but have some doubt this time.since we already
played and won on their court."
The Cardinal spoiled the opening of USC's
Galen Center, stunning the previously unde
feated Trojans with a three-game sweep, 30-20,

30-26,30-28. Sophomore outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza led Stanford with 1 <S kills, two aces and
14 digs. Sophomore middle blocker Foluke Ak
inradewo and senior outside hitter Kristin
Richards chipped in 12 each and junior middle
blocker Franci Girard notched 10 along with a
team-high five blocks.
Asia Kaczor had a team-high 15 kills for the
Trojans and All-American libero Debora Seil
hammer led all players with 21 digs.
Against the Bruins the next night. Barboza and
Richards again spearheaded the Stanford offense,
recording 21 kills each in the five game (30-27,27-
30,25-30,30-25,15-10) victory. Akinradewo con
tributed IS kills and seven blocks, while Richards
played phenomenal defense to finish with 2h digs.
Junior setter Bryn Kehoe dished out 66 assists
while her team hit .3(X) in the match.
Katie Carter led the Bruins with 19 kills, and
Nana Meriwether, just named Pac-10 Player of
the Week for the third time in 2006, had 17.
"With any team in the top 10 and even deep
er than that, there is usually someone you will
think is the best and is the most talked about,"
Dunning said. "[Kaczor and Meriwether] are
the players who get the most focus on those
teams, but any top team will have a handful of
great players. So you have to do your best to stop
those two, but you can't worry about just one
person — they may do their damage, but you
just have to play your best."
The Cardinal s best has been pretty good lately.
The team's .302 hitting percentage is the third best
in the nation and Akinradewo, hitting .444 is fifth
among individuals (Meriwether leads Division I
hitting at a .483 clip). Since returning from south
ern California, Stanford has scored four sweeps
and a four-game win last Friday in Berkeley.
"Last week's practice was unusual," Dun
ning explained. "Because we had been pushing
so hard for so long, playing high-level matches,
traveling and tons of school work — midterms
were really piling up on our team — we only
had one full team practice. 1 thought we were
road warriors, but played a step slower than we
had been. But there is nothing I think needs to
be changed from the weekend."

31 aces while Akinradewo has a

sophomore libero Jessica Fishburn
has tallied 263 digs. Richards, who is
second in defense with 203 digs, is
only six away from the all-time
record at Stanford, set by four-time
All-American Kristin Klein.'92.

"When people accomplish amaz
ing things,you owe it to them to pay at
tention." Dunning said. "It's just part
of what happens when you play at this
level, but she should be applauded be
cause it is quite an accomplishment.
She is a great player and we are happy
for her — she deserves it."
In addition to the free admission
for students. Stanford has made Sat

ribbons worn by the players.
Women's volleyball in the Paeific-10 Confer
ence is always a battle, but this weekend the
stakes are higher than ever. No. 2 Stanford hosts
No. 6 USC and No. 5 UCLA on Friday and Sat
urday in a clash of the league's best. Among
them, the three schools have won 12 NCAA
championships, including four of the hist five.
"I think there should be a good number ot
people watching in a great facility with great
teams playing," Stanford head coach John Dun
