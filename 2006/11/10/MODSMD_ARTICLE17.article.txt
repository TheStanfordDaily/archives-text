## No. 4 hoops downs LMU in season opener Wiggins returns from injury and drops 16 on Lions 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
At the start of its season, the Stanford
women's basketball team came through in
the finish last night at Maples Pavilion
against Loyola Marymount. With the
Lions on their heels for much of the first
half, the Cardinal finally pulled away in the
middle of the second with a devastating
24-2 run. clinching an 88-61 victory in the
first round of the Women's National Invi
tation Tournament (WNIT).
From the starting whistle, all the ingre
dients were in place for the Cardinal. Ju
nior guard Candice Wiggins made her re

turn to the starting lineup after being out
with an injury, and she immediately put
the Cardinal on the board with a three
pointer. Senior center Brooke Smith fol
lowed with her signature hook, and Stan
ford seemed on its way to an easy win.
But, Loyola refused to let Stanford pull
away so easily. Although the Cardinal
were able to pull away from an even game
on an 8-0 run near the middle of the half,
the Lions countered with an 11-2 run later
and were down just 36-34 at the buzzer.
"LMU is an excellent team." head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "Obviously,
it was a game throughout the first half."
Unable to get inside Loyola's zone de
fense often enough, the Cardinal were
aiming for the three, but came out only 3-
for-10 for those efforts.
"They were quick, scrappy defenders,"
senior center Kristen Newlin said. "We've

been working on our zone offense, and
what we learned we'll take to practice and
work especially hard on."
'ITie Lions kept on Stanford's heels
once again at the start of the second half,
tying the game 39-39, with 18:08 left. But a
layup by Newlin got Stanford going on its
game-winning run.and left the Lions
scrambling to catch up.
Powered by eight straight points from
I larmon, the Lions tired and were unable
to keep up with the energized, aggressive
Cardinal. Loyola went on to make sloppy
shots and put up numerous air balls.
"It really helped us out — getting
points in the transitions and stepping up
the defense stopped some easy baskets,"
Smith said.
Going inside to Smith and Newlin, who
had 26 and 15 points, respectively, Stan
ford kept a consistent offense, while equal

ly stepping up its defense.
"We can't run if we don't play defense
and rebound," VanDerveer said.
The Cardinal finished the game with 42
rebounds for the night (10 from Newlin,
who earned a double-double) compared to
the Lions' 23. And in the second half. Loy
ola managed just 27 points to Stanford's 52.
Along with maturing efforts from
freshman guard J.J. I lones. who had six as
sists for the night, Stanford eagerly wel
comed Wiggins' return. I ier 16-point con
tribution complemented Wiggins' much
praised energy on the court.
"Candice just keeps everybody going,"
VanDerveer said.
Ilie Cardinal now move onto the sec
ond round of the the WNIT second round
— a match against the winner of tonight's
BYIJ and Idaho State match — at 7 p.m.
on Monday at Maples Pavilion.
