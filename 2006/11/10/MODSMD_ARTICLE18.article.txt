The Stanford women's swim team advanced to No. 3 in the national polls
after crushing their first three opponents. This weekend they travel across the
country to match up with No. 4 Auburn and No. 15 Tennessee.
tween tup-level swimmers, Stan
ford is treating all of the meet's
events with equal importance.
With four NCAA "A" qualifiers
and 11 "B" qualifiers, the Cardi
nal are already showing a lot of
depth early in the season.
"1 am looking forward to
every event [in the meet] he
cause in each race there will he a
challenge that the women will
face,"Stanford coach Lea Maul -
er said. "Sometimes the chal
lenge will be beating an NCAA
champ and in some other events
the challenge will be to remain
focused on what is going on in
your lane."
The Cardinal head into this
meet after an impressive 195-
150 defeat of No. 11 Texas last
weekend, but Maurer recog
nizes that the team will need
more than momentum to
achieve victory in Knoxville.
"I was very pleased with our
swims in Texas but. we are going
to have to be better this week
end if we think we have a chance
to give Auburn and Tennessee a
run," Maurer said, "it should be
a tremendously challenging

weekend both physically and
mentally."
The Cardinal have not com
peted against either Auburn or
Tennessee recently. In 2002,
Stanford lost to Auburn, tying
the series between the two
teams at 1-1. The Cardinal have
never faced Tennessee in a dual
meet situation.
Auburn comes into the meet
after a 176-115 victory over
Louisiana State on Oct. 6. Ten
nessee carries momentum from
a 187-113 win over Louisville
Oct. 20, and defeats of both
South Carolina (141-98) and
then-N0.23 Kentucky (131 108)
on Oct. 27.
Larly in the season. Stanford
is keeping the results of this non
league meet in perspective.
"We have to continue to train
hard and we are excited to race
tomorrow," Maurer said. "But
we are more excited for the
NCAA meet in March."
The swimming action will
begin at 4 p.m. on Friday with
the 200-yard freestyle relay. Fri
day will include six individual
races, two relays and one diving
event. Saturday's competition
will begin at 10 a.m. with the 200-
yard medley relay and will con
