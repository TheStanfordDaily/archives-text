# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Polo tries to get back on track No. 4 men open homestand with Irvine Santa Clara 
### ANDREW SHEN STAFF WRITER 
ITiis weekend the No. 4 Stanford
men's water polo team will face off
against No. 11 UC-Irvine and No. 17
Santa Clara for the first two games
of a three-game homestand heading
into the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Tournament.The Cardi
nal have not faced either team pre
viously this season.
Coming off a hard-fought loss to
undefeated I ISC, followed bv a trounc
ing of UC-Davis the next day, the Car
dinal (14-6) will look to run the table
against lower-ranked teams at home as
they close out the regular season.
To do so, Stanford will have to
tame the Anteaters (9-16). who are
essentially a one-man show with
junior sensation Colin Mello leading
the way. Recently named the MPSF
Player of the Week after notching an
incredible 13 goals in two games

against Long Beach State and Cal
Baptist, Mello leads the Anteaters
with 72 goals for the season.
On the Cardinal's side, balance
on offense is the key, with senior
captain Tyler Drake, sophomore
Will Hindle-Katel and freshman
twins Drac and Janson Wigo with
more than 25 goals each. Along with
senior captain JJ Carton's and jun
ior Michael Bury's l l ) goals apiece,
the Cardinal feature an attack that
is six players deep.
In games against Cal and USC,
the Cardinal have done a relatively
good job of shutting down the other
team's primary scorer.They held the
Bears senior John Mann and Trojan
senior Thomas Hale — both serious
candidates for the Peter J. Cutino
Award, given to the best player in
the country — to two and no goals,
respectively. Without a serious sec
ond scoring option, UC-Irvine could
have trouble mustering enough of
an offense against the Cardinal.
Similarly, Santa Clara (13-12) does
not display much depth or balance of
fensively, with sophomore Jack Wall
and freshman Liam Farrell scoring

just under hall of the Broncos' goals.
Defense has not been the Cardi
nal's problem recently, as the team
has struggled on offense, most no
tably managing just two goals
against I JSC. The defense, mean
while. has been superb, led by Gar
ton and redshirt juniors Ryan For
tune. Forrest Schwartz and Peter
Finlayson. as well as goalkeepers
senior Sandy 1 lohener and sopho
more Jimmie Sandman.
Throughout this season, the buzz
around this year's team has been its
youth, and whether or not the team
would gel after losing key players to
graduation. If there was ever a right
time to peak, this weekend and next
week's match against No. 8 Pacific
would be appropriate.
Right now it is clear that Stan
ford will not surpass USC, Cal. or
UCLA in the national rankings, but
holding onto their No. 4 ranking will
be key in terms of seeding in the
MPSF Tournament. From there,
anything can happen, as evidenced
by the Cardinal's extremely com
petitive games against the elite
teams.
