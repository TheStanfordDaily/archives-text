## Stanford battles the elements and the Huskies tomorrow in Seattle 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford will take one more step
toward closing the book on what may
be their worst football season in his
tory with a visit to picturesque Husky
Stadium this Saturday.
The fact that the Cardinal (0-9,0-

-6 Pacific-10 Conference) enter the
contest 19-point underdogs speaks
volumes about the distance between
them and Washington (4-6, 2-5 Pac
-10), the league's next-worst team and
losers of five straight. For former
Cardinal head coach Tyrone Willing
ham, next-to-nothing has gone right
this season for the Huskies.
Starting quarterback Isaiah Stan
back went down with an injured foot
just when the team (4-3 at the time)
— and Stanback himself — ap
peared to have finally turned the cor
ner. New signal caller Carl Bonnell
has struggled mightily, throwing five
picks to California in his first start
and an additional three in his last two
games. Stanford will need to harass
Bonnell into as many mistakes, if not
more, to have a shot tomorrow.
On defense, Washington has
yielded 26 points per game, and
looked helpless against the run last
week as Oregon racked up an incred
ible 31 first downs in a 34-14 blowout.
On the season, the Huskies have al
lowed 235 pass yards and 155 rush
yards per game, both next-to-last in
the Pac-10. However, the Huskies
have reshuffled their defensive front,
and an anemic Stanford ground at
tack might be just what the doctor or
dered.
With 68 yards per game, 2.2 yards

per carry and no running back aver
aging over four yards per touch, the
numbers reflect what the fans have
seen with their eyes: arguably the na

tion's worst rushing attack. Junior
Anthony Kimble had two of his best
runs of the season against USC and
freshman Toby Gerhart packs a

punch — though he lacks shiftiness
— but behind an outmanned offen
sive line, Stanford typically can gain
only a yard or two per carry early in

the game, and is therefore forced to
ditch the run game.

Junior quarterback T.C. Ostrander tries to elude the (JSC defense in last week's 42-0 loss to the Trojans. He will try to improve on his 55 yards per game
average this week against Washington in Seattle. It won't be an easy task, given the wet conditions expected for tomorrow's game.
