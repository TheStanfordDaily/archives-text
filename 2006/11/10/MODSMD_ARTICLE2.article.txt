## Stanford battles the elements and the Huskies tomorrow in Seattle 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford will take one more step
toward closing the book on what may
be their worst football season in his
tory with a visit to picturesque Husky
Stadium this Saturday.
The fact that the Cardinal (0-9,0-

-6 Pacific-10 Conference) enter the
contest 19-point underdogs speaks
volumes about the distance between
them and Washington (4-6, 2-5 Pac
-10), the league's next-worst team and
losers of five straight. For former
Cardinal head coach Tyrone Willing
ham, next-to-nothing has gone right
this season for the Huskies.
Starting quarterback Isaiah Stan
back went down with an injured foot
just when the team (4-3 at the time)
— and Stanback himself — ap
peared to have finally turned the cor
ner. New signal caller Carl Bonnell
has struggled mightily, throwing five
picks to California in his first start
and an additional three in his last two
games. Stanford will need to harass
Bonnell into as many mistakes, if not
more, to have a shot tomorrow.
On defense, Washington has
yielded 26 points per game, and
looked helpless against the run last
week as Oregon racked up an incred
ible 31 first downs in a 34-14 blowout.
On the season, the Huskies have al
lowed 235 pass yards and 155 rush
yards per game, both next-to-last in
the Pac-10. However, the Huskies
have reshuffled their defensive front,
and an anemic Stanford ground at
tack might be just what the doctor or
dered.
With 68 yards per game, 2.2 yards

per carry and no running back aver
aging over four yards per touch, the
numbers reflect what the fans have
seen with their eyes: arguably the na

tion's worst rushing attack. Junior
Anthony Kimble had two of his best
runs of the season against USC and
freshman Toby Gerhart packs a

punch — though he lacks shiftiness
— but behind an outmanned offen
sive line, Stanford typically can gain
only a yard or two per carry early in

the game, and is therefore forced to
ditch the run game.



ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Junior quarterback T.C. Ostrander tries to elude the (JSC defense in last week's 42-0 loss to the Trojans. He will try to improve on his 55 yards per game
average this week against Washington in Seattle. It won't be an easy task, given the wet conditions expected for tomorrow's game.
That puts the ball in the hands of junior
quarterback T.C. Ostrander. who has yet to
live up to the reputation with which he ar
rived on campus as ;i national top-five quar
terback recruit, l ike senior Trent 1 dwards.
the starter before a season-ending foot in
jury last month. Ostrander has alternately
held onto the ball too long, leading to 37
sacks allowed, and not long enough, leading
to incompletions. interceptions and two
yard scrambles aplenty. Ostrander is com
pleting just 45 percent of his passes for 55
yards-per-game. though to be fair, freshmen
and walk-on receivers have received the
bulk of playing time with senior starters

L*van Moore and Mark Bradford injured
for much of the season.
Whether the blame falls on the shoulders
ot the offensive line, quarterback, receivers
or play-calling is the ultimate Rorschbach
test for the Cardinal faithful, but the bottom
line is clear: The Stanford offense last engi
neered a touchdown drive in September.
The Cardinal have similarly found little
success in recent years against Washington.
Stanford has not won in Seattle since 1975.
and I luskies are 20-3 against the Cardinal in
the past 30 years.
The Huskies were the Pac-10's premier
program at the turn of this millennium.

However, after Rick Neuheisal stepped
down from the head coaching position
under a cloud of controversy, USC started
to snag the league's top recruits and Wash
ington has suffered ever since. The team
went just 2-10 last year and 1.-10 the in the
previous year. However, with wins against
Stanford this weekend and Washington
State in the season-finale Apple Cup, the
Huskies would he eligible for their first
bowl since a 2001 victory in the Granddad
dy of Them All — the Rose Bowl.
Kickoff is at 12:30 p.m. PST.The game is
not being covered on television, but will be
broadcast on KNBR 1050 am.
