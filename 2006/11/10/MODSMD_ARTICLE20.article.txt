### ANNAPARLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After losing to Cal 3-1 in the NorPac
Conference Championship Finals this
past weekend, the Stanford field hock
ey team was forced to wait for the wild
card results to see if they would take
part in the NCAA championships.
Days later, they received the upsetting
news that they were not selected to
compete in the event.
Stanford (8-9, 5-1 NorPac) faced a
tough slate of opponents this season, in
cluding No. 16 California, No. 10 Vir
ginia, No. 1 University of Maryland —
the defending NCAA champions —
and No. 2 Wake Forest, which had won
the three prior national titles. In light of
their difficult schedule, the Cardinal
pulled off an impressive record.
Especially commendable is Stanford's
NorPac performance. The only confer
ence loss came against Cal, a close 3-2 de
feat. The Cardinal were seeded second in
the NorPac Tournament, received a first
round bye and defeated Appalachian
State 3-0 to advance to the finals. Once
again, they put up a good fight but could
not overcome the Golden Bears.
Though losing to archrival Cal is a trying
experience for any Stanford team, the field
hockey players were not too disheartened.
"Overall, our experience at the tour
nament was a good one," sophomore

Caroline Hussey said. "Obviously it's
really frustrating to lose to Cal. but we
felt good. Our coach thought that in the
finals, we played better against Cal than
we ever have in the past."
Upon returning home, the team hoped
to receive a wildcard bid to enter into the
NCAA tournament, but failed to make
the draw. Now the team can only look for
ward to next year.
"Our goal is always to win the NorPac
tournament." Hussey said. "But next
year, our team is also hoping to be
ranked. We'll have a challenging sched
ule, which goes into the ranking process,
so if we take care of the games we need
to. 1 think we can make it happen. We
need to take care of the lowas and
Northwesterns — teams we did not beat
this year but are fully capable of defeat
ing. if we want to be ranked next year."
During the offseason the team will be
lose five seniors to graduation: captain mid
fielder Jaime Hais, captain defender Aska
Sturdevan. forwards Katherine Brooks and
Li/. Robinson and midfielder Julia Drewes,
Sturdevan was one of 38 college field
hockey players in the nation to be se
lected to play in the 2006 National Field
Hockey Coaches Association Division I
Senior All-Star Game, which will take
place on Nov. 18 at Wake Forest Univer
sity. Both Sturdevan and Drewes were
awarded First Team All-NorPac honors.
However. Stanford has plenty of youth

who will return next year — two juniors,
six sophomores and nine freshmen. Of
these underclassmen, many of them re
ceived conference honors.
Junior Jess Zuts was also named
First Team All-NorPac, leading the
Cardinal in number of points with 34
(13 goals, eight assists). She was ranked
fifth in the conference in total points.
Junior goalkeeper Madison Bell was
named Second-Team All-NorPac, and
was been named NorPac Defensive
Player of the Week four times during
the season. She finished the season
ranked first in the league in save per
centage with an average of .738.
Sophomore Bailey Richardson was
also named Second-Team All-League,
and Nora Soza was named NorPac
Freshman of the Year.
In addition, sophomore Chloe Bade
received the Julie Nagle Extraordinary
Teammate Award, which is given to the
conference player who most "shows ex
traordinary care and support of her
teammates, genuine love for the sport
and her academic institution, possesses
a great spirit and has deep appreciation
for life and those around her."
Though this season may wrapped up
early for the Stanford field hockey team,
they are already looking ahead. While
second place in the NorPac tournament is
undoubtedly a success, the Cardinal have
even more ambitious goals for the future.
