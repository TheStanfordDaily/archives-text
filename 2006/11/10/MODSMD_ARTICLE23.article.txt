## Editor's Note 
### THOSE WHO KNOW INTERMISSION ARMCHAIR GENERALS 
51. That seems to he the magic number of the day. Allen fell a few thousand short
after making some very inappropriate comments and. just like that, the Democrats
were given the sweeping Election Day victory they could have only dreamed of six
months ago.
But enough, that's just petty partisan politics. Veteran's day is tomorrow. A far more
serious matter... so why not get a head start by starting the commemoration today?
Therefore, this week at Intermission, we're honoring the war to end all wars: World
War 1.
But wait, why is this specific war so important to us? To the country? To the world?
First, it didn't really end war. We've had plenty of nasty conflicts since then - heck, we're
stuck in the middle of one now as we write this. But then why the commemoration?
For one, Americans like to remember wars won. We certainly owned in World War
I - not that we were in it all that long to begin with, of course. Second, regardless of our
late entry into the conflict, we still lost many soldiers. That in and of itself merits serious
thought and reflection.
But it is sad how only the victories, how only the lives of those who fought for win
ning causes, seem to be remembered. We often hear politicans pay their dues to veter
; ans of and those lost to the great wars that we "won," yet rarely hear anything of the
sort for those who fought in the battles that American didn't fare so well in.
So this Veteran's Day, while our issue's focus might be on World War I, we encour
age you to remember all the veterans out there. Not just those that fought in the flashy,
America-friendly conflicts. But all of them. It's the least you could do.
