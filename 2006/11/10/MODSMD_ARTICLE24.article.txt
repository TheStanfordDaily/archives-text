## 'Stranger' raises familiar themes 
### DI DANG INTERMISSION STRANGER 
A man named Harold Crick (Will Fer
rell) wakes up one morning to find that his
life is being narrated, specifically in "omni
scient third person" voiceover. He is just a
regular person who has come to find himself
as the main character of a novel. It's an in
teresting concept but unfortunately
"Stranger than Fiction" amounts to little
more than that.
We are presented with Harold as the
Everyman who leads a tedious existence.
His life consists of his work as a hated IRS
agent and his obsession with counting
things, like his steps to the bus stop and the
number of ounces in a soap dispenser. His
regimented life is disturbed one morning
when he begins hearing a disembodied
voice describing how he is counting the

number of brush
strokes it takes to
brush his teeth.
Harold thinks he is
going crazy.
Since no one
else can hear the
voice, he grows in
creasingly frustrated
with the inexplicable
and incessant narra

a professor of literary

character in a novel
by the reclusive au

(Emma Thompson).
While standing
at a bus stop, Harold
hears a devastating
narrative twist: that
his death is immi

frantic attempts to
save his death from
being written by Eif
fel and his real life
from ending.
This first
screenplay by Zach
Helm has been fre
quently described as
"Charlie Kaufman

light," which is an
honor that Helm doesn't quite deserve.
With films like "Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind" and "Adaptation," Kauf
man has proven himself to be a master at
creating complexly rich narratives that
never cease to amaze his audience. Helm
comes close in his conception of a Kauf
man-esque idea with "Stranger than Fic
tion" but the originality is quickly under
mined by the formulaic plot and empty
cliches.
For instance, the same day that Harold
wakes to Eiffel's narration, he is assigned to
audit a sexy, anti-establishment baker. Ana
Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). From the mo
ment Gyllenhaal appears on screen, it is im
mediately apparent to us that she is the rcq-
