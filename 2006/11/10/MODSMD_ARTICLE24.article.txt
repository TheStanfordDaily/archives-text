## 'Stranger' raises familiar themes 
### DI DANG INTERMISSION STRANGER 
A man named Harold Crick (Will Fer
rell) wakes up one morning to find that his
life is being narrated, specifically in "omni
scient third person" voiceover. He is just a
regular person who has come to find himself
as the main character of a novel. It's an in
teresting concept but unfortunately
"Stranger than Fiction" amounts to little
more than that.
We are presented with Harold as the
Everyman who leads a tedious existence.
His life consists of his work as a hated IRS
agent and his obsession with counting
things, like his steps to the bus stop and the
number of ounces in a soap dispenser. His
regimented life is disturbed one morning
when he begins hearing a disembodied
voice describing how he is counting the

number of brush
strokes it takes to
brush his teeth.
Harold thinks he is
going crazy.
Since no one
else can hear the
voice, he grows in
creasingly frustrated
with the inexplicable
and incessant narra
tion. With the help of
a professor of literary
theory, Jules Hilbert
(Dustin Hoffman),
Harold comes to real
ize that he is the main
character in a novel
by the reclusive au
thor Karen Eiffel
(Emma Thompson).
While standing
at a bus stop, Harold
hears a devastating
narrative twist: that
his death is immi
nent. Thus begins his
frantic attempts to
save his death from
being written by Eif
fel and his real life
from ending.
This first
screenplay by Zach
Helm has been fre
quently described as
"Charlie Kaufman

light," which is an
honor that Helm doesn't quite deserve.
With films like "Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind" and "Adaptation," Kauf
man has proven himself to be a master at
creating complexly rich narratives that
never cease to amaze his audience. Helm
comes close in his conception of a Kauf
man-esque idea with "Stranger than Fic
tion" but the originality is quickly under
mined by the formulaic plot and empty
cliches.
For instance, the same day that Harold
wakes to Eiffel's narration, he is assigned to
audit a sexy, anti-establishment baker. Ana
Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). From the mo
ment Gyllenhaal appears on screen, it is im
mediately apparent to us that she is the rcq-

uisitc cute free
spirited female
character who
will change
Harold's life.

II lowevcr. since Harold is. after all. the awkwardly up
tight IRS agent auditing her. they must clash heads
several times before falling deeply in love. And we all
I know that this will give 1 larold's life meaning and that
he will learn how to seize the day and live more fully

I afterwards.
"Stranger than Fiction" smacks strongly of a first
screenplay, and it comes across as Helm following too
I closely a beginner's manual for how to write. The film
is riddled with heavy-handed insertions of symbolism,
as evident in the unfortunately crucial and irritating
I watch that Harold wears, and foreshadowing, like the
little boy on the bicycle. These revelations do not spoil
anything since they appear at regular intervals through

the film, more than frequently enough to hit the audi
ence over the head with their significance.
The nature of the concept of "Stranger than Fic- I
lion" is clever. The premise rings of various familiar
topics - predeterminism versus free will, nihilism, the h
meaning of life, tragedy versus comedy, existentialism. I
God- and Christ-like figures, etc. It's a veritable cor- I
nucopia of literary themes, the kind of stuff that would
give your AP English teacher a wet dream.
"Stranger than Fiction" shows a lot of a promise. I
but instead of fully |

exploring any sig
nificant meaning, it I
merely dirts super- I
ficially with these ™
themes, only hint- m
ing at them. Helm I
could have reached I
for more and actu
ally inspired us to I
think on a deeper I
level, as Kaufman |
would, but he stops
short and fails us. I
He disappoints the I
inherent originality ™
of "Stranger than h
Fiction," allowing it I
to deteriorate into a I
mess of sappy
cliches. That being ■

said. "Stranger than Fiction" is cute. It will make you I
laugh here and there, and Gyllenhaal and Thompson |
arc especially fun to watch. But the film isn't particu
larly fulfilling, and it doesn't provide much in the way I
of substance. If you want a film that will both charm I
and challenge you, then save your money and rent ™
something by Kaufman. But if you are more in the mm
mood for something that is just sweetly corny, then go I
with "Stranger than Fiction" for tonight.

The nature of the concept of "Stranger than Fic- I
lion" is clever. The premise rings of various familiar
topics - predeterminism versus free will, nihilism, the h
meaning of life, tragedy versus comedy, existentialism. I
God- and Christ-like figures, etc. It's a veritable cor- I
nucopia of literary themes, the kind of stuff that would
give your AP English teacher a wet dream.
"Stranger than Fiction" shows a lot of a promise. I
but instead of fully |

exploring any sig
nificant meaning, it I
merely dirts super- I
ficially with these ™
themes, only hint- m
ing at them. Helm I
could have reached I
for more and actu
ally inspired us to I
think on a deeper I
level, as Kaufman |
would, but he stops
short and fails us. I
He disappoints the I
inherent originality ™
of "Stranger than h
Fiction," allowing it I
to deteriorate into a I
mess of sappy
cliches. That being ■

said. "Stranger than Fiction" is cute. It will make you I
laugh here and there, and Gyllenhaal and Thompson |
arc especially fun to watch. But the film isn't particu
larly fulfilling, and it doesn't provide much in the way I
of substance. If you want a film that will both charm I
and challenge you, then save your money and rent ™
something by Kaufman. But if you are more in the mm
mood for something that is just sweetly corny, then go I
with "Stranger than Fiction" for tonight.
