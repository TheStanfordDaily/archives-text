Most movie lists suck. They pass general
izations on good movies, indulge in spurious
and vague categorizations (liberal horror
movies, uplifting values movies) and spit out
catalogs of drivel that you have seen and
(should) have hated. â€ž
So this article is going to be different. If
you're expecting to find that movie about
Vegas that your roommate owns on DVD,
which you plan to watch tonight over a bowl of
couscous - yes, I'm talking about "Ocean's
Eleven" - I'll excuse you right now. Best of
luck, no offense taken.
On the other hand, if you're genuinely in
trigued about what some of the best-crafted
films have to say about those humans that
Vegas and its roulette tables lift and merciless
ly crush, I offer you a selection of five movies.
If you find the criteria of my selection some
what tendentious - if when you read the list you find
yourself saying that's no "Vegas movie" -1 apolo
gize, but bear with me. For I guarantee that watch
ing any of these movies will be more than sufficient
to soothe your outrage. I tried to select movies that
represented the phenomenon of Vegas - its allure,
rather than its geography.
Note: The order of the films is arbitrary and
does not contain any cinematic terms.
"Owning Mahowny"
A staik depiction of gambling addiction, courtesy of

Philip Seymour Hofiman's
portrayal of the Dickensianly
named Dan Mahowny. Ma
howrty, a bank executive, has a
secret He's a compulsive ganv
Wer. As his gEimbfing forays
take him deeper into debt. Ma
howny must use his position
and experience to save himself
km the casinos.
Hoffman gives a
power-house perfor
mance here and shames
those who only knew of
him after "Capote." The
movie also contains
(probably) the most
touching scene set in
Vegas (if you thought
that was Dustin Hoff
man's

seen e\.
in "Rain\
Man." you're v
a sucker but should read
on): A crowd gathers

around a roulette table to cheer when the cam
era slowly closes in on Mahowny, his eyes dart
ing reptiliously as his face succeeds, using
every twitch of will-power that he possesses, to
remain impassive.
"Bob le Flambeur"
The classic. The heist movie that influenced
a dozen or more films, including "Ocean's
Eleven" and another Hoffman vehicle, "Syd
ney," It was shot on a shoestring budget by
Jean-Pierre Melville, a Frenchman who
changed his name after reading... I'll let you
guess. Reportedly, Melville was so constrained
in his budget that the only actors he could hire
were sub C-rate. The film's starring girl (who
is, unfortunately, a bit annoying) was literally
picked off the street.
If this information alone is not enough for
you to check it out, I could tell you that Bob, an
old crook who is everyone's pal (the cops give
him a ride to his gambling den), decides that he
must return for one last score. If the plot
sounds a tad familiar, it's only because it has
been imitated endlessly. But the original still
exudes freshness with sharp narrative, bo
hemian decor (which Melville would license in
a later film, "Le Samourai") and the lively me
chanics of Bob's scheming mind.
"The Sting"
