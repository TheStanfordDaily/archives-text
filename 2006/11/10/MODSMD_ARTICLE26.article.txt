## Oh, the music that we bomb to... 
### RAHUL KANAKIA INTERMISSION TREE HUGGER 
Like the current war. World War 1
was started by a terrorist incident. Aus
tro-Hungarian Archduke Fran/ Ferdi
nand and his wife were killed after
Gavrilo Principe threw a bomb into
their horseless carriage while they were
taking a jaunt through Serbia, which

was currently languishing

under their rule.

Principe

was a member of the

Black Hand, which is probably 10

times cooler than the name of any cur
rent terrorist organization, mostly be
cause 1 can understand it since the
name isn't in Arabic and since they are
and have been completely uninterested
in killing me.
Immediately after the incident, a
swirl of popular music was released, in
cluding "The Blast That Spattered
Royal Brains Around the World" and
"The Damn Commies Did It", with its
chorus "Bomb The Hun". The effect of
the song is unknown, but shortly after
this minor terrorist incident, a massive
war started that killed 15 mil-

people and in
fjured 20 million
/more. With that short
/introduction, Inter
/mission would like to

/present the songs of 9 /
/11, with the hope that
/they won't be nearly as
/effective.

mf 1) "Courtesy of the Red,
and Blue" by Toby
- To me, this song per-
Wfectly encapsulates the feeling
Wafter 9/11.1 know that I wanted
â–  to put a boot in someone's ass. I
112 didn't know who it would be, and
'neither does the song. In fact, the

song doesn't really even venture to name
any candidates. It just gives off this gener
al air of ass-kicking.
2) "Have You Forgotten" by Darryl
Whorley - What is this guy talking
about? As soon as they started showing
new episodes of Friends, 1 instantly for
got the 24 / 7 news coverage on every
channcl (including the WB). This song
is less successful than the above, mostly
because it appears that Darryl Whorley
is having a very schizophrenic argu
ment with himself. Take this lyric for
example: "And you say we shouldn't
worry about Bin Laden / Have you for
gotten?" I don't need these sorts of ac
cusations! I'm Hipping the dial.
3) "Where Were You (When The World
Stopped Turning) by Alan Jackson - This
song came out so fast that some speculate
it was actually written before 9/11. Writ
ten... by the Jews! Or by Bush adminis
tration speechwriters. It's hard to keep up
on the conspiracies. Anyway, for Mr.
Jackson's information, if the world had
stopped turning we wouldn't be any
where really bccause the kinetic energy of
the atmosphere would tear us off the
earth's surface and rip us to shreds. More
seriously, I was in gym class, and I was
pissed because I was totally going to win
that game of dodgeball! It would have

been much
cooler if they
hadn't alerted
us and I had
gone home like
normal and my
mom was like
"Where the
hell were you?
The world

stopped turn
ing today!" And then I'd say, "Oh no!
We're in the midst of a six-month day!
We'll all burn to death!"

4) "The Rising" by Bruce Springsteen -
I see what the Boss was trying to do, but
this song is kind of a downer. I'd much
rather put a boot in someone's ass.
That's a bit more constructive than just

wallowing in the fact a whole lot
of people just died.

5) "Mosh," "Holiday" and al
million other songs written by"

"rebels" - These suffer from the^

same problem that most protest^

songs do. Why should I listen to*
you? You're self-described drug
users and criminals and you make a
living by marketing anger and resent
ment. And have you ever voted, Em
inem? Tell the truth now. Now if

Protest songs
1. "Courtesy of the Red. White and Blue" - Toby Keith
2. "Have You Forgotten" - Darryl Whorley
3. "Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turn
ing)" - Alan Jackson
4. "The Rising" - Bruce Springsteen
5. "Mosh" - Eminem
6. "Holiday" - Green Day

those Google guys wrote a protest
song, I would listen to that. Call me
reactionary, but if you're going to tell
me what to think, at least wear a tic or
something.
