Who says rock is dead? The Hold Steady's latest album.
"Boys and Girls in America," emphatically reminds us that
sometimes rock does indeed emerge in an utterly original and
incredible way.
This, the third album of New York City based The Hold
Steady, follows 2005's critically acclaimed "Separation Sun
day." And this album is even better. It's full of rollicking gui
tar riffs, great lyrics and strangely touching songs.
The album begins with a quote from Kerouac: "There are
nights when 1 think that Sal Paradise was right; Boys and girls
in America have a such a sad time today." For an album full
of songs about getting high and drunk, "Boys and Girls" is
eminently literary and lyrical.
It's almost as if the front man, Craig Finn, cares as much
about books as booze. With characters like Gideon and
Charlemagne, Finn elevates the life of drug users in the Twin
Cities to "kings and queens." He reminds us that everyone
matters - even dealers and dropouts.
What is remarkable about this album is how whole "Boys
and Girls" is. Many albums these days are simply a collection
of songs that the same band has performed, but all the songs
' - •' I

in "Boys and Girls" have /a definite unity. Characters in one
song reappear in another, and some even evolve from song to
song. Many of these characters appeared in "Separation Sun
day," but. like The Hold Steady itself, have grown, becoming
more nuanced and dynamic.
The album begins with "Stuck between Stations," and
compares life to being like what the song's title suggests.
Right from the start, we see a far more melodic, subtle sound
than in "Separation Sunday." Through many songs in "Sepa
ration Sunday," I felt like Finn was yelling at me, rather than
singing, but this never happens/ in "Boys and Girls." The
background piano, which sounds like something right out of
Alicia Keys, provides a contrast to the robust guitars and
Finn's voice, something that happens, to a beautiful effect, in
many other songs in the album.
Finn's vocals may provide a surprise to those who are used
to American Idol-like voices. It's harsh and it never feels like
Finn is technically singing: It's not rap and its not singing, but
some extremely strange amalgam of the two. This synthesis
may be strange at first, but it is original and fits the harsh re
ality of the band's songs.
"Chips Ahoy," the second track, demonstrates the band's
gorgeous lyrical composition abilities. It tells the story of the
singer's girlfriend, who doesn't have to work since she makes

money betting on horses. The song is fun and very catchy.
Like many of the other tracks, "Chips Ahoy" is full of
power chords, repeated lyrics and a lush background chorus.
But all the songs in the album are unique. The band displays
a surprising emotional range from those tunes that seem to be
the aural version of being high to songs with a tender sadness.
One highlight of "Boys and Girls" that proves oddly mov
ing is the album's penultimate song. "Chillout Tent." It is the
ballad of a girl and a guy who pass out at a music festival and
meet at the song's title location. While it appears the charac
ters are destined for each other, the song takes a surprising
twist, just as real life often does.
The tune is lovely, with gorgeous guest vocals by Dave
Pirner of Soul Asylum and Elizabeth Elmore of Sarge and
The Reputation. These provide a nice foil to Finn's harsh vo
cals. But "Chillout Tent" also reminds the listener that de
spite Finn's inability to truly "sing," he still can craft an en
chanting album.
"Chillout Tent" and every other song on the CD demon
strate The Hold Steady's passion for music. Perhaps this is
their greatest strength; it evens exceeds their stunning
melodies and lyrics. And just maybe, the "Boys and Girls of
America" wouldn't be so sad if they only just listened to this
incredible album.
