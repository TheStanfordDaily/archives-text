## Bollywood Opera? 
### JANET KIM INTERMISSION HERO HUNTER 
"Opera Meets Bollywood" is
the eye-catcher on the yellow flyers
advertising "The Sorcerer," and
the short answer is that the Stan
ford Savoyards manage to pull it
off. This Gilbert & Sullivan light
opera follows Alexis Iyangar, a
benevolent but misguided young
m;in who is convinced that the joy
of love can override all worldly un-

happiness.
When Alexis

The theme, however, proves
to be surprisingly attractive and
effective: bright silks adorn the
stage and chorus numbers are
livened up by Bollywood-style
choreography, which effortless
ly blends in with Gilbert & Sulli
van's original score. In fact, the
theme is executed so well that
one could legitimately wonder if
the opera was, in its original
form, set in an amicable Indian
village during the English occu
pation.
' The more difficult question
to answer may be how the
theme complicates the pres
sures normally associated with
the performance of a "light
opera": directing actors to bal
ance the pressures of singing,
dancing, and acting.

The cast makes a valiant cf-,
fort on all fronts, and there is'
certainly a good deal of talent in
the show. The show features an
endearing and active chorus of J
villagers, and the flurry of action
in the chorus pieces is one of the
most entertaining parts of the
show. Freshmen Alejandra(
