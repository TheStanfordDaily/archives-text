## Bollywood Opera? 
### JANET KIM INTERMISSION HERO HUNTER 
"Opera Meets Bollywood" is
the eye-catcher on the yellow flyers
advertising "The Sorcerer," and
the short answer is that the Stan
ford Savoyards manage to pull it
off. This Gilbert & Sullivan light
opera follows Alexis Iyangar, a
benevolent but misguided young
m;in who is convinced that the joy
of love can override all worldly un-

happiness.
When Alexis

commissions a
sorcerer to create

a love potion for the
entire village, minor
disasters ensue.

The theme, however, proves
to be surprisingly attractive and
effective: bright silks adorn the
stage and chorus numbers are
livened up by Bollywood-style
choreography, which effortless
ly blends in with Gilbert & Sulli
van's original score. In fact, the
theme is executed so well that
one could legitimately wonder if
the opera was, in its original
form, set in an amicable Indian
village during the English occu
pation.
' The more difficult question
to answer may be how the
theme complicates the pres
sures normally associated with
the performance of a "light
opera": directing actors to bal
ance the pressures of singing,
dancing, and acting.

The cast makes a valiant cf-,
fort on all fronts, and there is'
certainly a good deal of talent in
the show. The show features an
endearing and active chorus of J
villagers, and the flurry of action
in the chorus pieces is one of the
most entertaining parts of the
show. Freshmen Alejandra(

Geoff Schaeffer's portrayal
of sorcerer John Wellington
Wells is also notable in that he I
shows off vocal talent as well as
admirable comedic timing.
Schaffer's ability to enunciate
while singing quick, tongue-'
twisting lines is also a welcome
relief in a show in which vocals
are sometimes overpowered by |
the capable orchestra.
Jonathan Erman gives an en
ergetic and enthusiastic perfor
mance of Alexis Iyengar, and I
though his on-stagc happiness
feels a little gratuitous in parts,
he handles his numerous lines
with panache while unequivo
cally excelling as a vocalist. His
collaboration with sophomore

Aumna Iqbal, who plays
Alexis' oft-suffering wife
Aline, may be the best part
of the show. While Erman
and Iqbal do not have pal
pable romantic chemistry

onstage, their harmony is outstanding, and this vocal chemistry is
the driving force behind the show.
Iqbal, however, is a case study for the extensive pressures that
the Bollywood twist places on cast members. Though a capable
leading lady and an excellent soprano, lqbal appears distracted
as she leads an ensemble of female dancers in Bollywood-stvle
group dancing. I ler dancing is fine and her performance, in the
end. is one of the show's strongest, but her uneasy preoccupation
with perfecting the complicated choreography is mirrored
throughout the show in many other cast members who must jug
gle complex dance moves with singing and dancing.
Overall, this ambitious production is a worthwhile endeavor. For
one, this may be the only wedding of Bollywood and comedic opera
that this campus will ever see. Additionally, unlike many Gilbert & Sul
livan operas, "The Sorcerer" is not weighted down by lengthy plots that
meander pointlessly, hut explores an outrageous premise with a series
of deft, light scenes. It is a gtxxi story told in an entertaining manner,
and this production manages the essential integrity of the original while
executing a daring twist to satisfaction.
"The Sorcerer" will be running November 10, 11, and 18 at 8
p.m. and Nov. IIJl l J at 2:30 p.m. in the Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Tickets are $10 for students and children. $12 for seniors, and $16
for adults.

the show. The show features an
endearing and active chorus of J

in the chorus pieces is one of the
most entertaining parts of the
show. Freshmen Alejandra(

Geoff Schaeffer's portrayal
of sorcerer John Wellington
Wells is also notable in that he I
shows off vocal talent as well as
admirable comedic timing.
Schaffer's ability to enunciate
while singing quick, tongue-'
twisting lines is also a welcome
relief in a show in which vocals
are sometimes overpowered by |
the capable orchestra.
Jonathan Erman gives an en
ergetic and enthusiastic perfor
mance of Alexis Iyengar, and I
though his on-stagc happiness
feels a little gratuitous in parts,
he handles his numerous lines
with panache while unequivo
cally excelling as a vocalist. His
collaboration with sophomore

Aumna Iqbal, who plays
Alexis' oft-suffering wife
Aline, may be the best part
of the show. While Erman
and Iqbal do not have pal
pable romantic chemistry

onstage, their harmony is outstanding, and this vocal chemistry is
the driving force behind the show.
Iqbal, however, is a case study for the extensive pressures that
the Bollywood twist places on cast members. Though a capable
leading lady and an excellent soprano, lqbal appears distracted
as she leads an ensemble of female dancers in Bollywood-stvle
group dancing. I ler dancing is fine and her performance, in the
end. is one of the show's strongest, but her uneasy preoccupation
with perfecting the complicated choreography is mirrored
throughout the show in many other cast members who must jug
gle complex dance moves with singing and dancing.
Overall, this ambitious production is a worthwhile endeavor. For
one, this may be the only wedding of Bollywood and comedic opera
that this campus will ever see. Additionally, unlike many Gilbert & Sul
livan operas, "The Sorcerer" is not weighted down by lengthy plots that
meander pointlessly, hut explores an outrageous premise with a series
of deft, light scenes. It is a gtxxi story told in an entertaining manner,
and this production manages the essential integrity of the original while
executing a daring twist to satisfaction.
"The Sorcerer" will be running November 10, 11, and 18 at 8
p.m. and Nov. IIJl l J at 2:30 p.m. in the Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Tickets are $10 for students and children. $12 for seniors, and $16
for adults.
