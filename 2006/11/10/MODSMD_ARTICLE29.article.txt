### AMY STEINBERG INTERMISSION ART CRITIC 
The thing about art in a gallery is
that it is just that: art, in a gallery. A

typical gallery wall is a blank, sterile
abyss and erases any telling context
for the images it supports. For the
painting on this backdrop, there is
no definite history or inevitable fu
ture, only the relevance we manu
facture between the object and our
world today. While there are many
logical reasons for organizing art this
way, the viewer is always left to her
own devices in reconstructing the
life of a work of art, for better or for

worse.
The curators of "A New 19th
Century: The Mondavi Family
Gallery Reinstalled," however, have
taken a different approach to gallery

construction that nudges the viewer
into a Victorian paradigm. Instead
of meticulously wiping out any con
textual traces, the curators have
carefully orchestrated the gallery to
pfSSent the objects as they would
have existed in their infancy: in the
home of a prominent, upper class
19th century family. A family who
may just have had "Beat Cal" em
blazoned on their front door and a
young Leland Jr. running around

out back.
The room itself is a cornflower blue
an unusual color choice which, I'm told
really makes the paintings "pop." Ac
cents of white in the pillars, moldings,
and wooden paneling contrast with the
blue to compose an interior Victorian
ambience. Two columns marie the from
"doorway" and support Jean Coulon's
Celestial Hebe and Pierre Eugene
Emile Hubert's Mephistopheles.
Straight through the columns is the din
ing room, where the culinary arts are se
ductively idealized in Henri Fantin-La
tour's Still Life with Fruit, and where
stylistic renditions of trompe I'oleil
paintings, which oftentimes feature
freshly hunted game, enhance the mas
culine undertones of a Victorian feast
(while also providing a rather poignant
case for vegetarianism).
Continuing towards the right, past a
variation on Harnett's The Old Violin,
(at this point, in the fashion of a con
cerned tour guide, I should warn you to
watch your step over the large red car
pet), you will enter the parlor. Here, in/
what is officially titled "The Collector's
Comer," is an amalgamation of works
by both American and European
artists, which are vertically stacked and
horizontally cramped in the typical dis
play formation of a 19th century parlor.
Through the parlor we enter the ball
room. where William Keith's Upper
Kem River demands the back wall - a
position it actually occupied in the Stan
ford's mansion - along with various
