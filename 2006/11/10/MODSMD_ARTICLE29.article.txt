# Here we have our Renoir...

### AMY STEINBERG INTERMISSION ART CRITIC 
The thing about art in a gallery is
that it is just that: art, in a gallery. A

typical gallery wall is a blank, sterile
abyss and erases any telling context
for the images it supports. For the
painting on this backdrop, there is
no definite history or inevitable fu
ture, only the relevance we manu
facture between the object and our
world today. While there are many
logical reasons for organizing art this
way, the viewer is always left to her
own devices in reconstructing the
life of a work of art, for better or for

worse.
The curators of "A New 19th
Century: The Mondavi Family
Gallery Reinstalled," however, have
taken a different approach to gallery

construction that nudges the viewer
into a Victorian paradigm. Instead
of meticulously wiping out any con
textual traces, the curators have
carefully orchestrated the gallery to
pfSSent the objects as they would
have existed in their infancy: in the
home of a prominent, upper class
19th century family. A family who
may just have had "Beat Cal" em
blazoned on their front door and a
young Leland Jr. running around

out back.
The room itself is a cornflower blue
an unusual color choice which, I'm told
really makes the paintings "pop." Ac
cents of white in the pillars, moldings,
and wooden paneling contrast with the
blue to compose an interior Victorian
ambience. Two columns marie the from
"doorway" and support Jean Coulon's
Celestial Hebe and Pierre Eugene
Emile Hubert's Mephistopheles.
Straight through the columns is the din
ing room, where the culinary arts are se
ductively idealized in Henri Fantin-La
tour's Still Life with Fruit, and where
stylistic renditions of trompe I'oleil
paintings, which oftentimes feature
freshly hunted game, enhance the mas
culine undertones of a Victorian feast
(while also providing a rather poignant
case for vegetarianism).
Continuing towards the right, past a
variation on Harnett's The Old Violin,
(at this point, in the fashion of a con
cerned tour guide, I should warn you to
watch your step over the large red car
pet), you will enter the parlor. Here, in/
what is officially titled "The Collector's
Comer," is an amalgamation of works
by both American and European
artists, which are vertically stacked and
horizontally cramped in the typical dis
play formation of a 19th century parlor.
Through the parlor we enter the ball
room. where William Keith's Upper
Kem River demands the back wall - a
position it actually occupied in the Stan
ford's mansion - along with various


other harmonizing landscapes.
Beginning to circle

back around, we pass
by Degas' bronze
mold entitled Grand
Arabesque, and nearly
overlook the early ex
perimental, post-im
pressionist Picasso
(yes, Picasso!) in oil.
The back left corner is
a tribute to the west
ern frontier, featuring
Bierstadt's The Last of
the Buffalo in dramat
ic dialogue with a glass
case of Native Ameri
can beaded works.
William Keith's elec
tric Sunset on Mount
Diablo (Marin Sunset)
guides us to the next
alcove that explores
the development Of
photography into film
before we arrive in the
paper and prints sec
tion. It is here that a

study of watercolor techniques and
travel motifs culminate in a small
countryside rendering by Monet.
Finally we conclude in the portrai
ture room, where, looking up at an
adorable, yet seemingly bossy
young man by the name of Gordon

Fairchild (by John Singer
Sargeant) 1 began to ponder why it
is that students should visit this
gallery...aside from the very pretty
pictures.
Art in a gallery is art in a gallery.
Most of the time, no matter how
much I study the subject and no mat
ter how much I enjoy looking, I just
don't get it. But the reinstalled Mon
davi Gallery is more of a collection
of sentimental mementos, like walk
ing through a house of a family dead
and gone and piecing together who
they were by the objects that hung
on their walls. Simply by setting a
context through image arrangement
and plaster columns, the art in this
gallery becomes a series of clues that
beg the question, what compilation
of objects would accurately remem
ber you? It may sound like a materi
alistic quest for self-realization, but it
is something to consider during this
infamous time of "finding yourself."
So visit for some ideas of what great
individuals have left behind, for the
beautiful ride to cantor, and, if noth
ing else, visit for the pretty pictures.
Or, if that didn't work, here is
some serious name-dropping in the
spirit of promotional clips for the
arts: Monet, Picasso, Renoir,
Sargeant, Corot.

Bierstadt's The Last of
the Buffalo in dramat
ic dialogue with a glass

can beaded works.
William Keith's elec
tric Sunset on Mount
Diablo (Marin Sunset)
guides us to the next
alcove that explores
the development Of
photography into film
before we arrive in the
paper and prints sec
tion. It is here that a

study of watercolor techniques and
travel motifs culminate in a small
countryside rendering by Monet.
Finally we conclude in the portrai
ture room, where, looking up at an
adorable, yet seemingly bossy
young man by the name of Gordon

Fairchild (by John Singer
Sargeant) 1 began to ponder why it
is that students should visit this
gallery...aside from the very pretty
pictures.
Art in a gallery is art in a gallery.
Most of the time, no matter how
much I study the subject and no mat
ter how much I enjoy looking, I just
don't get it. But the reinstalled Mon
davi Gallery is more of a collection
of sentimental mementos, like walk
ing through a house of a family dead
and gone and piecing together who
they were by the objects that hung
on their walls. Simply by setting a
context through image arrangement
and plaster columns, the art in this
gallery becomes a series of clues that
beg the question, what compilation
of objects would accurately remem
ber you? It may sound like a materi
alistic quest for self-realization, but it
is something to consider during this
infamous time of "finding yourself."
So visit for some ideas of what great
individuals have left behind, for the
beautiful ride to cantor, and, if noth
ing else, visit for the pretty pictures.
Or, if that didn't work, here is
some serious name-dropping in the
spirit of promotional clips for the
arts: Monet, Picasso, Renoir,
Sargeant, Corot.
