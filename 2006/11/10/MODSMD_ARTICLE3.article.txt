# Kimble Searching for Daylight
## In the midst of a frustrating season, junior running back looks to improve and guide his team back to respectability 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
When the Cardinal take the football field this
weekend against Washington, it is more than likely
that the game will be played in less than optimal con
ditions. It has been raining all week in Seattle and the
bad weather is predicted to continue through the
weekend.
Stanford defensive players are expecting the
Huskies to adjust to the conditions by making heavy
use of their run game. Junior running back Anthony
Kimble is ready for the added responsibility should
Stanford decide to do the same.
"Being from Louisiana, it rained a lot during foot
ball season, so I'm used to playing in wet weather."
Kimble said. "Every day I work on my craft. 1 work to
get better. I'm still learning a lot. I'm not nearly
reaching my potential at the position, but I feel like
I'm getting a little closer every day."
Kimble leads the Cardinal in rushing with 333
yards and a 3.8 yards-per-carry average, but has also
seen his influence rise in the passing game, as senior
quarterback T.C. Ostrander looked to him as a check
down receiver early in last Saturday's game against
USC. Kimble was the second leading receiver in the
game for Stanford with 31 yards on three catches.
"[The running backs] are a big part of our passing
offense." Ostrander said. "Not every throw needs to
be downfield for it to be successful, and a lot of times
they're good outlets for pressure or when people are
covered downfield. I think that part of my develop

ment is being able to recognize when the backs are
open and get them the ball quickly ''
It could play a big role in Kimble's development as
a playmaker for the Cardinal as well. Kimble had
been nonexistent as a receiver in the previous two
games, as Ostrander led the offense after playing a
more significant role in previous weeks as an option
for Trent Edwards. Kimble was encouraged by the
progress his new quarterback made against the Tro
jans.
"1 thought he did a nice job coming down on his
reads, checking down to his running backs," Kimble
said. "And that's something that he has to do more
when receivers are covered downfield. That's some
thing I feel he's improved a lot on."
Overall though, one of the biggest challenges for
this Stanford team has clearly been keeping its focus
in the midst of an 11-game losing streak stretching
back to last year. Moreover, the offense has particu
larly struggled in recent weeks. The last offensive
touchdown by the Cardinal was a 57-yard halfback
pass from Kimble to junior Kelton Lynn on Oct. 10
against Notre Dame.
Despite all that, Kimble said he wasn't looking to
next year because he couldn't take his future for
granted.
"I really don't want our seniors to go out without
a win." Kimble said. "And 1 wouldn't want our
younger guys to be looking to the future and not play
ing to their full capabilities. Because you're never
