# Kimble Searching for Daylight
## In the midst of a frustrating season, junior running back looks to improve and guide his team back to respectability 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
When the Cardinal take the football field this
weekend against Washington, it is more than likely
that the game will be played in less than optimal con
ditions. It has been raining all week in Seattle and the
bad weather is predicted to continue through the
weekend.
Stanford defensive players are expecting the
Huskies to adjust to the conditions by making heavy
use of their run game. Junior running back Anthony
Kimble is ready for the added responsibility should
Stanford decide to do the same.
"Being from Louisiana, it rained a lot during foot
ball season, so I'm used to playing in wet weather."
Kimble said. "Every day I work on my craft. 1 work to
get better. I'm still learning a lot. I'm not nearly
reaching my potential at the position, but I feel like
I'm getting a little closer every day."
Kimble leads the Cardinal in rushing with 333
yards and a 3.8 yards-per-carry average, but has also
seen his influence rise in the passing game, as senior
quarterback T.C. Ostrander looked to him as a check
down receiver early in last Saturday's game against
USC. Kimble was the second leading receiver in the
game for Stanford with 31 yards on three catches.
"[The running backs] are a big part of our passing
offense." Ostrander said. "Not every throw needs to
be downfield for it to be successful, and a lot of times
they're good outlets for pressure or when people are
covered downfield. I think that part of my develop

ment is being able to recognize when the backs are
open and get them the ball quickly ''
It could play a big role in Kimble's development as
a playmaker for the Cardinal as well. Kimble had
been nonexistent as a receiver in the previous two
games, as Ostrander led the offense after playing a
more significant role in previous weeks as an option
for Trent Edwards. Kimble was encouraged by the
progress his new quarterback made against the Tro
jans.
"1 thought he did a nice job coming down on his
reads, checking down to his running backs," Kimble
said. "And that's something that he has to do more
when receivers are covered downfield. That's some
thing I feel he's improved a lot on."
Overall though, one of the biggest challenges for
this Stanford team has clearly been keeping its focus
in the midst of an 11-game losing streak stretching
back to last year. Moreover, the offense has particu
larly struggled in recent weeks. The last offensive
touchdown by the Cardinal was a 57-yard halfback
pass from Kimble to junior Kelton Lynn on Oct. 10
against Notre Dame.
Despite all that, Kimble said he wasn't looking to
next year because he couldn't take his future for
granted.
"I really don't want our seniors to go out without
a win." Kimble said. "And 1 wouldn't want our
younger guys to be looking to the future and not play
ing to their full capabilities. Because you're never
promised a next play â€” I could go out first
play at Washington and that could be the
last play of my career."
On a team that seems to be getting
younger by the week, as starters fall to in
juries. Kimble said he viewed it as his re
sponsibility to help keep the team's youth
ful players focused on each game from
week to week, as taking things one week at
a time has become Stanford's mantra this
year.

"Being an older guy, you've got to help
out to keep the younger guys' heads
straight and keep their eyes on the prize,"
Kimble said. "You've just got to go out
there, take every opportunity you get. and
try to get that first win."
Keeping hope alive in a season like the
Cardinal's is no easy task. Kimble, however,
said he still believed Stanford to be capable
of winning if the squad can play up to its po
tential in the coming weeks.

"We've been struggling, but 1 feel we're
a lot better than what we've been showing
on the field," Kimble said. "So the biggest
thing to me is just showing what we are and
doing what we're capable of doing. If we go
out there and play to our top capabilities
and Washington beats us. then they were
just the better team on that day. But it's al
ways disappointing when you come off the
field with regrets because the offense could
have played a lot better."


Junior running back Anthony Kimble ran for 22 yards and caught 31 yards last weekend against USC. Kimble has been forced to step into
a bigger role in the passing game in response to Stanford's struggles on the ground.
