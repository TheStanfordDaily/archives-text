### RAHUL KANAKIA INTERMISSION HISTORIAN 
World War I was a testing ground for anti-heroes. A whole genera
tion of villains sueked on the bloody teat of Verdun and the Somme, get
ting ready to spring forth upon a new and all together far more frighten
ing century. Here is a sprinkling of the bad boys of WWI, a group of peo
ple whose infamy would set the tone for wars to come.

1) Winston Churchill - Before he rid Europe of the Nazi threat and
delivered it to the Communist yoke, in one day, Winston Churchill
became the founding father of no less than three nations. During
the War To End War, Winston was First Lord of the Admiralty
and the planner behind the Gatlipoli landings. Although this bat
tle and its planner were widely reviled between the wars as a huge
defeat and needless waste of life, few could predict their long-term
impact. It was on that gentle slope leading into the maws of the
Turkish Artillery that the nascent republics of Australia and New
Zealand experienced their first crushing defeat, which they cele
brate every year on Anzac Day. And at the top of the hill, com
manding those artillery, a young Turkish officer Mustafa
"Ataturk" Kernal would gain the fame that would enable him to
do what European military officers had been trying to do for a
thousand years: topple the Ottoman Empire.

5) Henri Petain - This Frenchman had a troubled relation
ship with the Germans. He grew famous at the Battle of Ver
dun for saying "they shall not pass". One hundred twenty
thousand corpses later, he was proven right. Henri became a
hero, eventually becoming commander of all the French
armies during WWI. But during the next war, he became the
head of the Vichy government, a Nazi puppet regime. After
the war, he was tried for treason and shot. In France, he is still
widely regarded as a traitor.

2) Mata Hari - This exotic daoo r ,»nd courtesan was so famous
that she attracted thousands of w. mbers of high society to her
shows. Strictly for artistic purposes you understand. And she
counted so many military officers amongst her admirers that
she was recruited by the secret intelligence agencies of Britain,
France and Germany. It's not quite clear who she was working
for. but it probably wasn't the French, since they executed her
by firing squad in Nl7. lo tlu< day, this Dutch prostitute is
widely admired as a woman < if -.m passing independence.

3) The Red Baron - As a
boy Manfred Albrecht Frei
herr von Richthofen or "Albie"
was mocked even by his classmates.
Even Hans and Fritz laughed at the youth. But Man
fred took all the punishment in stride and swore to him
self that some day he would bear the greatest name c
them all. The Red Baron shot down eighty allied fight
ers before eventually being downed by a Canadian wit!
the equally humorous name Wilfrid "Wop" May. 1
doing so he became the first of the fighter jocks, a ma
whose fame passed the boundaries of victory and dc
feat and gave hope to short, socially inept little boy
around the world.

4) Eugene V. Debs - Until WWI, America had been doing a pretty good job of suppressing
those "peace-loving" radicals. A pinko commie by the name of Debs started mouthin' off
about the war, saying stuff like "Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all liv
ing beings, and 1 made up my mind that 1 was not one bit better than the meanest on earth.
I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a crim
inal element 1 am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free". President Wilson
took that a bit too literally and tossed him jail for the duration of the war. Years later, dur
ing the depression, he would get a million votes for the Presidency, the highest total a com
munist has ever recorded. After that defeat the commies spurned the ballot box and took to
the streets with their "civil-rights marches" and "sit-ins" and "immolating themselves in the
Pentagon parking lot".
