## LETTER SEX AIN'T THE SAME 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
As a rule, Roxy does not recommend long-distance relation
ships. What is the point, Roxy protests, of saving yourself for
someone far away when, especially at Stanford, there is so much
fine ass walking, talking, gasping, and moaning right in front of
you?
Alas, Roxy must recognize the fact that half of quite a few

thriving long-distance
relationships exist com
fortably at Stanford,
and. as always, she's
here to offer advice.
Read on for Roxy's siz
zling suggestions on
how to keep things spicy
from sea to shining sea.
First of all, realize that
you could have it a lot
worse. Roxy doesn't
know how people man
aged long-distance rela
tionships, during, for ex
ample, World War I. She
is quite glad that they did,
however, since without a
couple of long-distance re
lationships in that era,
there wouldn't be a Roxy.
During WWI, the
sexiest you could get
with your far-away part
ner would have been
somewhere along the
lines of "letter sex."
This dispatch, dripping
with ardor though it
may have been when
you wrote it, would most
likely have arrived in
your loved one's hands
torn open, read many
times by sex-starved
government officials,
and manually ceiv^^^^

At that point
in history, having a

long-distance relationship essen
tially meant resigning yourself to only

the barest and, um, stillest of communication for years at a time.
And Roxy isn't talking about the good way. Thankfully, though,
it is much easier now.
These days, technology allows for instant communication be
tween separated lovers. Unfortunately, however, this does not
mean that computer science majors will universally have mind
blowing cyber sex on a regular basis. Because using technology
for sexual communication with your significant other still re
quires stepping outside your comfort zone.

To get your partner's pulse-racing
from miles away, you really need to talk
dirty. Don't say, "Additionally, 1 will
i massage your clitoris as we have in-
L tercourse." Instead, whisper, "And
&J then, you enter me, quivering, drip-
Wf ping with desire, and I close my
warm, wet-" Roxy thinks you get
the idea.

Here is where using a phone can
make things a lot steamier. The sounds of
each other's voices and breathing will excite
you more than words on a screen. However,
if you're nervous, online is a good place to
. J • l I * „

start expanding your boundaries.

Better yet, buy a webcam. The naughty possibilities
are endless: strip teases, dirty dances, and of course just
being able to look into your significant other's eyes and

feel your connection. Webcams can be expensive, but
they sure beat cell phones and instant messaging. Plus,
with chat services like Skype, you can talk for free
whenever you want.
Snail mail is also still useful to the post-WWI long-distance
relationship. Send anything you want- candy, dirty pictures, or
even actual letters! They can be sweet if you are willing to put in
the time, and it's something each of you can cherish when you
can't be with the other person.

Also, transportation is a lot faster these days.
When you really can't take it anymore, your
lover is usually only a long drive or airplane ride
away. While maybe you can't afford this all the
time, just remember, you are still fortunate.
It's not like people could just take a week- J.

Finally, be sure * "Njjß--
you have a good supply of the
other person's stuff. Clothes and jewelry
work especially well, but anything that
reminds you of your lover will be benefi
cial to your relationship, whether it's the
ticket stub from your first date or the
empty can of the soda you shared last J
time you were together.
St) those of you who are in long-dis
tance relationships at Stanford, live it >
up! Do whatever you can to keep the
fires burning, because your bond will
be much stronger for it. And just re
member, you are at Stanford, and if
things don't work out long-distance, ,
you're surrounded by other options. J'
Hot other options. Over and out. ' j
