# Solving the Puzzle
## Early injuries are a concern for young team looking to play spoiler 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
In a world of spin, lies and video
tape. Trent Johnson is brutally
honest. Ask the Stanford men's
basketball coach about the up
coming season and he'll answer
with frank, unhesitating candor.
"We don't have all our pieces in
place," Johnson said of the realities faced
by his young team, which kicks off the reg
ular season tomorrow against Siena. "We
can be getting pieces in place here week to
week. We do have some deficiencies on
this basketball team."
With five freshmen, a transfer and a
walk-on, Johnson will be doing his fair
share of mixing and matching. Combined
with injuries to key players, it may be a
while before fans see how the final puzzle
comes together.
"The positive of all the injuries that we
have had is that we have been able to jug
gle guys and play people out of position
and have a competitive practice," John
son said. "1 really do like our group; we
have decent talent. Our freshmen take
things in like sponges. They are all looking
forward to the challenge of the season,
and 1 truly expect this team to get better
and stay together as a team."
Stanford will not return an all-league
player for the first time since 1995. Gone
are Cardinal mainstays Chris Hernandez,
Dan Grunfeld, Matt Harvasz and Jason
I laas. And while the freshman class, espe
cially All-Amcrican 7-foot twins Brook
and Robin Lopez, shows promise, John
son said comparisons with former Stan
ford standout twins Jason and Jarron
Collins were premature.
"Mark Madson and Tim Young, two
first-round picks, were here [during the
Collins' freshman year]," Johnson said.
"They're walking into a different situa
tion."
But what the Card may lack in experi
ence and depth, they more than compen
sate for in energy, effort and enthusiasm.
"Our strength will be to play hard and
hopefully take on the personality of our
coaching staff â€” defensive-minded, con
fident and have a killer instinct," said
sophomore point guard Mitch Johnson,

recently named team captain. "If we do
those things, we'll be all right."
The defensive focus was on display
Tuesday night, when the Cardinal held
British Columbia to 39 percent shooting
en route to a 79-59 exhibition victory.
"If we're going to go anywhere this
year, it's going to be on the defensive
end," said senior forward Kred Washing
ton. who is also expected to take on a lead
ership role after missing significant time


The Learning Curve

last year due to a knee injury. "If we keep
that defensive intensity up all year, there is
no limit to what we can do."
Getting the major pieces healthy may
help. too. Brook Lopez, recovering from
offseason back surgery, has no official
timetable for his return but is expected back
in December. Junior center Peter Prowitt,
sidelined with an injured knee, is still at least
two weeks away.
"If we keep Robin in the game, get his
brother back and get Peter back, we're a pret
ty solid defensive team." Washington said. "If
we keep that up. we can surprise some peo
ple. Not ourselves, but other people."
Picked to finish seventh in a preseason
Pac-10 coaches' poll. Stanford has the po
tential to play the spoiler role this year. The
conference won't be easy, with UCLA and
Washington reloaded after losing key
starters to the NBA. Arizona, picked for the
first time since 2(H) 1 to finish runner up. will
be its usual competitive self as well.
The prospect of playing perennial power
house Duke in the College Basketball Ex
perience Classic later this month, is also par
ticularly tantalizing and will prove an early
test for the young Cardinal. But Brook
Lopez said he and his fellow freshmen relish
the opportunity to learn on the fly.
"Everyone's in a position to step up and
make contributions." he said. "They've
made the adjustment already."
As for the sophomore captain. Johnson
said he was taking things one day at a time.
"Our chemistry is as good as it can be,"
he said with a mature, tempered optimism.
"But it's going to definitely take us a while."
Indeed, a sense of patience will serve the
Cardinal well, unusually befitting for a team
that seeks to play with a charged energy and
competitive intensity on the court. It starts
with the coach, unflappable even after his
squad hung with a top-25 ranked Nevada
team in a closed scrimmage last Friday.
"I learned we're going to need all our
players," Johnson said. "We need all our
players."

Nothing Easy
"Everyone is in a position
to step up and make contri
butions. "
