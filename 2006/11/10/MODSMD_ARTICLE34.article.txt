# Solving the Puzzle
## Early injuries are a concern for young team looking to play spoiler 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
In a world of spin, lies and video
tape. Trent Johnson is brutally
honest. Ask the Stanford men's
basketball coach about the up
coming season and he'll answer
with frank, unhesitating candor.
"We don't have all our pieces in
place," Johnson said of the realities faced
by his young team, which kicks off the reg
ular season tomorrow against Siena. "We
can be getting pieces in place here week to
week. We do have some deficiencies on
this basketball team."
With five freshmen, a transfer and a
walk-on, Johnson will be doing his fair
share of mixing and matching. Combined
with injuries to key players, it may be a
while before fans see how the final puzzle
comes together.
"The positive of all the injuries that we
have had is that we have been able to jug
gle guys and play people out of position
and have a competitive practice," John
son said. "1 really do like our group; we
have decent talent. Our freshmen take
things in like sponges. They are all looking
forward to the challenge of the season,
and 1 truly expect this team to get better
and stay together as a team."
Stanford will not return an all-league
player for the first time since 1995. Gone
are Cardinal mainstays Chris Hernandez,
Dan Grunfeld, Matt Harvasz and Jason
I laas. And while the freshman class, espe
cially All-Amcrican 7-foot twins Brook
and Robin Lopez, shows promise, John
son said comparisons with former Stan
ford standout twins Jason and Jarron
Collins were premature.
"Mark Madson and Tim Young, two
first-round picks, were here [during the
Collins' freshman year]," Johnson said.
"They're walking into a different situa
tion."
But what the Card may lack in experi
ence and depth, they more than compen
sate for in energy, effort and enthusiasm.
"Our strength will be to play hard and
hopefully take on the personality of our
coaching staff â€” defensive-minded, con
fident and have a killer instinct," said
sophomore point guard Mitch Johnson,

those things, we'll be all right."
The defensive focus was on display
Tuesday night, when the Cardinal held
British Columbia to 39 percent shooting
en route to a 79-59 exhibition victory.
"If we're going to go anywhere this
year, it's going to be on the defensive
end," said senior forward Kred Washing

ership role after missing significant time
