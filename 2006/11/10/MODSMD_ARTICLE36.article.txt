r . ■ "•he men's basketball team is banking on the fact
'that its latest big-man acquisitions, 7-foot twins
Brook and Robin Lopez, will intimidate the
largest of their opponents. But have the twins
had the same effect off the court on their more
diminutive classmates?
"People might say something (about my height) the first
time they see me, but they get used to it pretty quickly," Robin
said. "We start talking, and they forget about it. It becomes
normal to them."
Billed as the next chapter in Stanford's storied history of
big men, the approachable brothers have acted more like gen
tle giants off the court, taking part in their dorms' scavenger
hunts and getting involved in other activities like the Campus
Movie Festival, a one-week competition in which Robin par
ticipated.
Still, comparisons to Stanford players of years past are in
evitable. To Tim Young and Mark Madsen in the early 90's,
and, of course, to another set of towering twins, Jason and Jar
ron Collins, who arrived on The Farm in 1997.
Head coach Trent Johnson, who also helped to recruit the
Collins brothers, said that it was too early to make direct com
parisons — though he has also said that he believes the Lopez
twins have more potential than their counterparts.
"People like to compare between the [two sets of] twins,
but they're extremely young," Johnson said.
Those comparisons are hard to avoid, however. Both sets
were McDonald's All-Americans, both are roughly 7 feet tall
(Jarron was "only" 6-foot-ll). And Brook, like Jason, will
begin his career on the bench due to an injury.
Johnson is careful to temper his expectations about the
twins' immediate impact, but one difference is clear. Jarron
and Jason had a couple of years to get settled, coming to a
team that returned four starters and Mark Madsen. They
mostly watched as the Cardinal won their first 18 games and
swept into the Final Four.
Brook and Robin, on the other hand, will be expected to
make an immediate impact on a young team that failed to
make the NCAA tournament last year and lost its four top
scorers, including three all-league selections. The only two
scholarship seniors, Fred Washington and Carlton Weather
bv. hoisted a combined 16 shots last year. Junior big men Taj
Finger (6-foot-8) and Peter Prowitt (6-foot-10) have struggled
with injuries throughout the preseason.
Robin will find himself in the starting lineup in the team's
game against Siena tomorrow, but it may be a while before
Cardinal fans get to see the twins on the court together. A rup
tured disk in his back has kept Brook out of play since July 18,
and he had surgery on it in late September. He may be back
as early as December, but back injuries can be fickle. Johnson
hasn't set a timetable on his return, though Brook feels opti
mistic, saying that he has started sprinting and jumping off
both feet.
"He thinks he could play today," Johnson said. "He
thought he could have played a week ago. But we have to be
smart and have his welfare in our best interest."
Until then. Robin will have to carry the weight of the twins'
big expectations by himself. Johnson cautioned against hop

ing for too much, but did say that Robin would have to be a
post presence on the offensive end.
"It's real easy to get caught up in his size, and say that he
should average 15 points and 10 rebounds per game," John
son said. "But that's not the case. The bottom line is, he just
left high school. There's an adjustment period there.
"If it happened overnight, he wouldn't be here."
Robin is considered to be a true back-to-the-basket center
whose strengths lie in defense, rebounding and shot-blocking.
"Robin gives us a real presence," sophomore guard Mitch
Johnson said. "He's relentless. He plays hard, and he doesn't
take plays off. He makes up for any mistakes he makes by
playing hard."
Brook, meanwhile, is considered to have the more polished
offensive game — a fact that he disputes, in brotherly spirit.
"People have been saying that I'm better on offense, but I

think Robin has shown that he's just as good," Brook said.
Robin made all three of his shots in the Cardinal's first exhi
bition game against British Columbia on Tuesday, but fouled
out in only 11 minutes, showing that he still has a way to go be
fore he gets accustomed to NCAA play and referees.
Brook admits to some favoritism, saying that he was excit
ed by his brother's play in a closed scrimmage against Nevada
last weekend.
"He is my brother, but I thought he did really well," Brook
said. "It was really exciting. The whole team was into it, from
the first guy to the last guy on the bench." He added," Ibat
was me."
Stanford fans will be especially excited when Brook finds
his way onto the court. Until then, Robin will get used to play
ing without his brother. And those expectations will just have
to wait.

r . ■ "•he men's basketball team is banking on the fact
'that its latest big-man acquisitions, 7-foot twins
Brook and Robin Lopez, will intimidate the
largest of their opponents. But have the twins
had the same effect off the court on their more
diminutive classmates?
"People might say something (about my height) the first
time they see me, but they get used to it pretty quickly," Robin
said. "We start talking, and they forget about it. It becomes
normal to them."
Billed as the next chapter in Stanford's storied history of
big men, the approachable brothers have acted more like gen
tle giants off the court, taking part in their dorms' scavenger
hunts and getting involved in other activities like the Campus
Movie Festival, a one-week competition in which Robin par
ticipated.
Still, comparisons to Stanford players of years past are in
evitable. To Tim Young and Mark Madsen in the early 90's,
and, of course, to another set of towering twins, Jason and Jar
ron Collins, who arrived on The Farm in 1997.
Head coach Trent Johnson, who also helped to recruit the
Collins brothers, said that it was too early to make direct com
parisons — though he has also said that he believes the Lopez
twins have more potential than their counterparts.
"People like to compare between the [two sets of] twins,
but they're extremely young," Johnson said.
Those comparisons are hard to avoid, however. Both sets
were McDonald's All-Americans, both are roughly 7 feet tall
(Jarron was "only" 6-foot-ll). And Brook, like Jason, will
begin his career on the bench due to an injury.
Johnson is careful to temper his expectations about the
twins' immediate impact, but one difference is clear. Jarron
and Jason had a couple of years to get settled, coming to a
team that returned four starters and Mark Madsen. They
mostly watched as the Cardinal won their first 18 games and
swept into the Final Four.
Brook and Robin, on the other hand, will be expected to
make an immediate impact on a young team that failed to
make the NCAA tournament last year and lost its four top
scorers, including three all-league selections. The only two
scholarship seniors, Fred Washington and Carlton Weather
bv. hoisted a combined 16 shots last year. Junior big men Taj
Finger (6-foot-8) and Peter Prowitt (6-foot-10) have struggled
with injuries throughout the preseason.
Robin will find himself in the starting lineup in the team's
game against Siena tomorrow, but it may be a while before
Cardinal fans get to see the twins on the court together. A rup
tured disk in his back has kept Brook out of play since July 18,
and he had surgery on it in late September. He may be back
as early as December, but back injuries can be fickle. Johnson
hasn't set a timetable on his return, though Brook feels opti
mistic, saying that he has started sprinting and jumping off
both feet.
"He thinks he could play today," Johnson said. "He
thought he could have played a week ago. But we have to be
smart and have his welfare in our best interest."
Until then. Robin will have to carry the weight of the twins'
big expectations by himself. Johnson cautioned against hop

ing for too much, but did say that Robin would have to be a
post presence on the offensive end.
"It's real easy to get caught up in his size, and say that he
should average 15 points and 10 rebounds per game," John
son said. "But that's not the case. The bottom line is, he just
left high school. There's an adjustment period there.
"If it happened overnight, he wouldn't be here."
Robin is considered to be a true back-to-the-basket center
whose strengths lie in defense, rebounding and shot-blocking.
"Robin gives us a real presence," sophomore guard Mitch
Johnson said. "He's relentless. He plays hard, and he doesn't
take plays off. He makes up for any mistakes he makes by
playing hard."
Brook, meanwhile, is considered to have the more polished
offensive game — a fact that he disputes, in brotherly spirit.
"People have been saying that I'm better on offense, but I

think Robin has shown that he's just as good," Brook said.
Robin made all three of his shots in the Cardinal's first exhi
bition game against British Columbia on Tuesday, but fouled
out in only 11 minutes, showing that he still has a way to go be
fore he gets accustomed to NCAA play and referees.
Brook admits to some favoritism, saying that he was excit
ed by his brother's play in a closed scrimmage against Nevada
last weekend.
"He is my brother, but I thought he did really well," Brook
said. "It was really exciting. The whole team was into it, from
the first guy to the last guy on the bench." He added," Ibat
was me."
Stanford fans will be especially excited when Brook finds
his way onto the court. Until then, Robin will get used to play
ing without his brother. And those expectations will just have
to wait.
