# IMPORTANT GAMES TO WATCH
## 
### 
Dec. 3 vs. Texas Tech
The Pete Newell Challenge will be in held in San Jose
for the first time in the event's history. South Bay fans
will be in for a treat, as legendary coach Bobby Knight
brings his Red Raiders out west. The Cardinal have
never faced Texas Tech, but could face Knight's
squad twice this season. The teams could meet two
weeks earlier in the finals of the College Basketball
Experience Classic in Kansas City, Mo. That would
likely require the Cardinal get past Duke.
Dec. 30 @ Arizona
This will be the Cardinal's first real Pac-10 test. The
Wildcats beat Stanford three times last season, in
cluding a 73-68 win in the Pac-10 Tournament. Ari
zona lost their leading scorer from last season, Has
san Adams, to the NBA, but their young core is one
of the most talented in the conference.
Jan. 11 vs . Washington
This home matchup will be Stanford's first look at
highly-touted freshman center Spencer Hawes. The
Huskies, like the Wildcats, lost their best players,
Bobby Jones and Brandon Roy, to the NBA Draft.
But head coach Lorenzo Romar has turned the
Huskies into perennial powers. Expect him to work
his magic again this season. This will also be former
Cardinal Tim Morris' first trip to Maples in a Wash
ington uniform.
Jan. 31 VS. Gonzaga
No Adam Morrison, but still a potent foe. After
snatching victory away from the Card last year in
Spokane, Stanford is looking for revenge. Derek
Raivio and Sean Mallon lead the Bulldog's attack.
Feb. 24 @ UCLA
After falling short in the national championship
game, the Bruins will try to take down the Cardinal on
their senior day. UCLA spoiled Stanford's senior day
in 2006, now it is the Cardinal's will try to do the
same. Unfortunately, UCLA has no seniors, so it will
be a tall task, even for the Lopez twins.
