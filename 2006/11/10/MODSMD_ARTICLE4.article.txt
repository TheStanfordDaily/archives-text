# Inside The Game: Beating the Zone
## 
### 
Washington got on the
board against Cat three
weeks ago with a 49-yard
touchdown strike from Carl
Bonnell (11) to Anthony Russo
(5). The Huskies lined up in the
shotgun with three wideouts
and sent all five eligible re
ceivers deep. Cal dropped back
in a soft zone coverage. Russo
ran inside the cornerback and
escaped the left safety, who had
been drawn to the inside by the
inside receiver's post route.
Bonnell fired the ball into
Russo's hands at the 15, and
his separation ensured the
score. A Cal defensive lineman
who was not supposed to be on
the field can be seen running to
the sideline as the ball is
snapped.
