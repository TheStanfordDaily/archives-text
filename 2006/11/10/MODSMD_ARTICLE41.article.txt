Iter three years of ag

Tne No. 4 Stanford
i, women's basketball
team comes into the
A i .Jf1L.2006-2007 campaign
with the talent, confidence and focused
energy necessary to finally capture their
first NCAA championship since 1992.
In each of the past three seasons,
Stanford has been bounced out of the
NCAA Tournament in the Elite Eight,
just short of the Final Four. After a last
minute defeat by LSU in the spring, the
Cardinal comes back more determined
than ever to take the next step.
"We've learned a lot about sticking
with things, going through the ups and
the downs." senior forward Brooke
Smith said. "Hopefully this year we can
get over the hump and get into the Final
Four."
Stanford is as well-equipped to
achieve that goal as it could hope to be.
Although the team lost three-point spe
cialist Krista Rappahahn to graduation,
the rest of the core of last year's squad
(26-8. 15-3 Pacific-10 Conference) has
been retained. Smith — who averaged
17.2 points per game and led the team
with 7.5 rebounds per game last season
— returns to anchor a big frontcourt.
She will be joined by senior center Kris
ten Newlin and sophomore forward Jil
lian Harmon, both frequent starters last
season. Additional depth will come from
sophomore Morgan Clvburn. junior
Christy Titchenal and freshmen Jayne
Appel and Michelle Harrison.
Although she is currently injured,
sophomore Rosalyn Gold-Onwude will
return to the backcourt alongside two
time Ail-American and Pac-10 Player of
the Year Candice Wiggins, who led the
team and the conference in scoring with
21.8 points per game last season. Seniors
Clare Bodensteiner and Markisha Cole
man. junior Cissy Pierce and the new
comers — freshmen JJ Hones and
Melanie Murphy — round out the
guards.
Along with great depth, experience
up and down the roster is going to be one
of the keys for the Cardinal this year. Ac
cording to Wiggins, another year has

boosted the team's confidence and self
assurance and, by extension, their abili
ty
"I think this year you will sec every
one's game transform because of confi
dence," Wiggins said. "We trust in our
selves that we are a good team. We
didn't have that same amount of trust

Experience Counts

last year."
While Wiggins and Smith are the
established stars of the team, having
been chosen as preseason All-Amer
ican candidates, and Newlin and
Harmon have gotten individual
recognition in the past, the team has
a few sleepers that could be poised to
take the proverbial next step this
season.
"Cissy Pierce could have a fabulous
season as long as she's really working
hard defensively," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "And Clare Boden
steiner is a three-point threat."
However, VanDerveer cannot
emphasize enough the crucial impact
that role players will have on the team
this season.
"Defense and rebounding will de
termine our success," VanDerveer
said. "It's about the role players, the
people willing to do little things: set
ting screens. hustling, playing defense
and rebounding."
The four highly touted freshmen
will also get in the mix right away this
season. Although there is a learning
curve for rookies, they are expected
to contribute immediately and per
haps contend for spots on the Pac-10
all-frosh team at the end of the sea
son.
" This group amazes me every day,"
Wiggins said. "The freshmen have
tremendous confidence as a class."
Although much of the talk sur
rounding the Cardinal focuses on its

chances for a national title, it must
deal with the conference first. Stan
ford is heavily favored to win its sev
enth straight Pac-10 title this year, but
the conference is stronger than ever.
It has six teams in the preseason Top
25, including No. 12 Arizona State,
last season's runner-up. Last winter,
five Pac-10 teams advanced from the
first round of the NCAA Tourney.
While so much quality within the Pac
-10 will make the conference season
more challenging, the team is thrilled
to face such a high level of competi
tion on a regular basis.
"I think it's great," VanDerveer
said. "We want competition. We
might not have as glossy a record, but
we'll be better prepared for the
NCAA Tournament."
VanDerveer's players echoed her
sentiments.
"1 think all the talent in the confer
ence is really exciting," Smith said.
"To get recognition across the coun
try is good for the Pac-10 and good for
us."
But beyond everything else, the
thought of contending for the nation
al title looms large. Some of the na
tional media have already gone so far
as to project a No. 1 NCAA Tourna
ment seed for Stanford.
"Hvpe doesn't really faze me,"
VanDerveer said. "It's great, but you
have to be able to get it done on the
court."
The talented, yet grounded. Cardi
nal women are in complete agree
ment.
"We understand the goal, we are
very focused, and being ranked na
tionally is not going to make us lose
that focus," Wij>gins said.
