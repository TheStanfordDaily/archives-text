Iter three years of ag

Tne No. 4 Stanford
i, women's basketball
team comes into the
A i .Jf1L.2006-2007 campaign
with the talent, confidence and focused
energy necessary to finally capture their
first NCAA championship since 1992.
In each of the past three seasons,
Stanford has been bounced out of the
NCAA Tournament in the Elite Eight,
just short of the Final Four. After a last
minute defeat by LSU in the spring, the
Cardinal comes back more determined
than ever to take the next step.
"We've learned a lot about sticking
with things, going through the ups and
the downs." senior forward Brooke
Smith said. "Hopefully this year we can
get over the hump and get into the Final
Four."
Stanford is as well-equipped to
achieve that goal as it could hope to be.
Although the team lost three-point spe
cialist Krista Rappahahn to graduation,
the rest of the core of last year's squad
(26-8. 15-3 Pacific-10 Conference) has
been retained. Smith — who averaged
17.2 points per game and led the team
with 7.5 rebounds per game last season
— returns to anchor a big frontcourt.
She will be joined by senior center Kris
ten Newlin and sophomore forward Jil
lian Harmon, both frequent starters last
season. Additional depth will come from
sophomore Morgan Clvburn. junior
Christy Titchenal and freshmen Jayne
Appel and Michelle Harrison.
Although she is currently injured,
sophomore Rosalyn Gold-Onwude will
return to the backcourt alongside two
time Ail-American and Pac-10 Player of
the Year Candice Wiggins, who led the
team and the conference in scoring with
21.8 points per game last season. Seniors
Clare Bodensteiner and Markisha Cole
man. junior Cissy Pierce and the new
comers — freshmen JJ Hones and
Melanie Murphy — round out the
guards.
Along with great depth, experience
up and down the roster is going to be one
of the keys for the Cardinal this year. Ac
cording to Wiggins, another year has

boosted the team's confidence and self
assurance and, by extension, their abili
ty
"I think this year you will sec every
one's game transform because of confi
dence," Wiggins said. "We trust in our
selves that we are a good team. We
didn't have that same amount of trust

Experience Counts
"We've learned a lot about sticking
with things, going through ups and
downs."
