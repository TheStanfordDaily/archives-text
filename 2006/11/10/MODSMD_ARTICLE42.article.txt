Just a few months ago, "Brooke with the hook" was
dominating the court in the regional semifinal of the
women's basketball NCAA Tournament. Redshirt
senior center Brooke Smith was having an epic night,
scoring a career-high 35 points against Oklahoma, and
in the process toppling the Sooners' star player: then
freshman center Courtney Paris.
One game later, the Cardinal were saw their Final Four
dreams come to an end in the final seconds of a 62-59 loss to
Louisiana State. This season. Smith is looking finish out her ca
reer at the NCAA championship game.
"That's definitely the goal of the team this year: to go to the
Final Four and the national championship," Smith said. "We've
been so close the past couple years, and we're really hoping to
break through. 1 think we have the pieces of the puzzle — we
just need to put them together."
The pieces of Smith's personal puzzle have been coming to
gether for five years now. She came to Stanford as a transfer
from Duke, where she averaged 3.4 points and 2.5 rebounds off
the bench in 25 appearances. After redshirting for the 2003-04
season. Smith was ready to become a prominent force on the
Cardinal.
"1 feel like I've grown up a lot since [my time at Duke], and
I've gotten a lot more confident in my game and my abilities,"
she said.
Smith made her presence known immediately in her second
year at Stanford, averaging 13.4 points and 5.5 rebounds per
game. Along with 44 blocks. Smith earned her way to first-team
All-Pac-10 honors at the end of the season.
And last year, Smith started every game for the Cardinal, av
eraging 17.2 points per game and 7.5 rebounds while she aver
aged less than 31 minutes each game. She also crossed the 1 ,(KM)-
point mark with 584 for the season, and had nine double-dou
bles and 47 blocks. The stats earned her a KodakAVBCS All-
America honorable mention, as well as an All-Pac-10 selection
for the season and conference tournament.
"I've gotten a lot better by playing for [head coach Tara Van-
Derveer] — learning the system and getting the chance to play
with all these fabulous players here at Stanford — it's all helped
me so much," Smith said.
Along with her personal success. Smith has improved her
teammates better as a leader for Stanford. Last year, she
stepped into the leadership role along with then-sophomore
guard Candice Wiggins. Having lost five graduates, the team
was looking toward its star players to compensate for it. And
again this year, as Smith nears her own graduation, she makes
sure to look back on incoming and developing players like she
herself was a few years ago.
"I've been trying to teach them, help them get comfortable
with the system —just be there for them, really." she said.
Smith finds leading bv example equally important, and is
constantly working on her individual game to make the team
better overall. Known for her signature hook shot. Smith said
that she is honing her other skills this year, all for the sake ol the

team.
"I've been trying to expand my
game offensively, become more ver
satile and also really work on my re
bounding and defense because those
are two things I really need to improve
for this team to be successful," she
said.
VanDerveer agrees that Smith has
developed as a player, and immediate
ly in this past weekend's exhibition

games, she stepped up with 28 points
in 23 minutes against Chico State, and
19 points against Love & Basketball.
"Brooke has really expanded her
game and versatility, and worked hard
defensively," VanDerveer said.
Outside of improving as a player,
though. Smith has her sights on ending
the season on a good note, both for the
team and herself.
"I think as a team, we all want to
enjoy the whole year," she said. "It's
my last year, so I want to enjoy every
day. every practice and every game,
and not have any regrets about it. Per
sonally, 1 d like to do whatever it takes
to help my team win."
