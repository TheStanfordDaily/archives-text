# IMPORTANT GAMES TO WATCH
## 
### 
Nov. 24 at Tennessee
Tennessee has been a thorn in the Cardinal's side for
years. The Lady Vols beat Stanford in front of a sell
out crowd at Maples Pavilion last season. Candice
Wiggins and the rest of the squad will be looking for
a little early-season payback.
Dec. 20 @ use
Stanford's trip to USC will be the first Pac-10 road trip
of the season, as well as their first visit to the Women
of Troy's new arena. USC is one of the teams expect
ed to finish toward the top of the Pac-10.
Dec. 30 vs. Arizona State
Arizona State was the lone team that hung tough
with the Cardinal in the Pac-10 during the regular
season. This year they are looking to take the final
step to dethrone the reining conference champs.
The earl-season battle will give a good indication if
the Sun Devils have what it takes.
On. 6 @ California
The Cardinal have dominate the Bears in recent
years. But coming into the 2006-2007 season, Cal
finds themselves one of five Pac-10 teams ranked in
the top 25. Stanford's visit to Haas Pavilion will be a
big test for the up-and-coming Bears.
eb. 22 vs. Ucla
UCLA shocked the Cardinal in last season's Pac-10
championship game, taking a 85-76 overtime deci
sion. This year the schools face off on the final week
end of the regular season. If the Bruins can pull off
another upset, they could set themselves up in great
position heading to postseason play.
