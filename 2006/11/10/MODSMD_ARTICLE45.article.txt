While junior Candice Wiggins and
senior Brooke Smith have been the
focus of most of Stanford's preseason
excitement, four fresh faces will grace
the court with their esteemed team
mates. With four years of eligibility
before them, the freshmen are hope
ful about the season and the ways in
which they will contribute to the Car
dinal program.
J J Hones was the first of the class to
commit to Stanford. A 5-foot-10
guard from Beaverton, Ore., Hones
was honored as the 2(X)6 Gatorade
State Player of the Year and the 4A
State Plaver of the Year. She was a

First-Team All-State selection during
her senior year, and was also named
Metro League Player of the Year.
Hones was named a Parade Third
'l'eam All-American and a Street &
Smith's honorable mention All-
American before being invited to the
IJSA U2O Women's National Team
Trials. Hones, despite her high school
success, is already listening to the
coaching staff's instructions to stay fo
cused on personal performance,
which will lead to accomplishments as
a team.
"The coaches have really stressed
that we should be playing against our
selves," Hones said. "We know what
we need to do. and we just have to ex
ecute properly [to ensure success in
the Pac-10]" '
Fellow guard Melanie Murphy

hails from Brooklyn. N.Y., where she
set the all-time scoring record at Mid
wood High School. She was named
Madison Square Garden Tri-State
All-Star First Team and a Street &
Smith's honorable mention Ail-
American. Murphy was nominated
for McDonald's and WBC'A High
School All-American consideration.
In June, Murphy was also invited to
the USA UlB Women's National
Team Trials. Murphy agreed with
Hones that the toughest competition
for the team comes each afternoon in
Maples.
"I'm looking forward to [the sea
son opener) tomorrow." Murphy said.
"I think practice has gotten us ready
for the season; we find our hardest
competition here."
Jayne Appel, a 6-foot-4 center

from Pleasant Hill, Calif., helped the
UlB National Team win gold in Col
orado Springs, posting a double-dou
ble in the first round, and nine points.
12 rebounds and 2 blocks in the cham
pionship. Appel was the 2006
Gatorade State Player of the Year, a
McDonald's All-American a WBCA
All-American. and was named MVP
of the All-Star Game in San Diego.
Appel ranks third in California history
for blocks, and her offensive and de
fensive prowess earned her honors as
a USA Today Second-Team All-
American and a First-Team Parade
All-American. She believes that the
Cardinal have the potential to win
every game.
"I hope we get to the national
championship," Appel said. "[As a
freshman,] I'll do what I can to help us

get there."
Equally optimistic about the possi
bilities for 2006-07 was forward
Michelle Harrison of Orem, Utah. A
First-Team All-State selection in all
four years, in high school Harrison too
collected recognition as a McDonald's
All-American, Gatorade State Player
of the Year. Street & Smith's Honor
able Mention and Parade Third-Team
Ail-American. She was also invited to
the USA U2O Women's National
Team Trials with Hones. She can't
wait for Stanford's season to get un
derway.
"I'm very excited," Harrison said.
"It's the beginning of a great season. 1
think we get better and better every
day, and we're definitely ready to
show everyone what we're capable
of."
