## PWR awards honor research innovation Ceremony rewards writers who push limits, Daily staff win top honors 
### JULIE KLEIN DESK EDITOR 
Research papers are a rite of pas
sage for freshman, yet few students
think about their work after turning
in paper work in a Red Bull-induced
haze. The Stanford Writing Center
looked to reverse that trend Wednes
day when it handed out the first batch
of Innovative Research Awards
(IRAs) for exceptional PWR papers.
In the past, first-year students en
rolled in the Program of Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) only had hopes of
receiving the highly coveted Boothe
Prize for Excellence in First-Year
Writing, which is awarded to the best
research papers each quarter. Unlike
the Boothe Prize, the new. less tradi
tional IRA focuses on a more cre
ative set of objectives.
"Both the Boothe Prize and the
IRA recognize thoughtful, effective
writing," Wendy Goldberg, assistant
director of the Stanford Writing Cen
ter. wrote in an email to The Daily.
The IRA, alternatively, highlights
"writing that gives clear evidence of
originality with respect to subject, re
search methods and style."
PWR Associate Director Marvin
Diogenes said he hopes the IRAs
will inspire better papers by exposing
students to their peers' innovative
research.
"We're always looking for ways to
put students' research in front of the
wider campus community." he said,
"particularly new students orienting
themselves to intellectual life at a re
search university."
The first IRAs were presented
Wednesday in Branner I hill to soph
omores Andrea Fuller, kashmira
Daryanani.Tina Zoecoli Mayers and
James Hohmann. Each spoke in de
tail about what they studied and how
they performed their research.

Fuller, a former Daily staff writer,
studied how the children of immi
grants adjust to university life in her
paper entitled "First in a New Class:
First-Generation College Students
and lTteir Assimilation into College
Culture." With the help of Writing
Center Director Clyde Moneyhun,
she plans to start a discussion group
for first-generation students.
1 uller is also applying for a ( 'hap
pell Lougee grant to continue her re
search. As a first-generation student
herself, she has a personal invest
ment in her work.
"1 was really passionate about the
topic, and I wanted to know about
this subject [beyond my paper]," she
said. "I was interested in seeing how
my own experiences related to gen
eral patterns and trends."
Daryanani suggested new mar
keting strategies for Apple Comput
er. Inc. in her paper, "The Future of
Apple: A Look at the Company's
Shift from Personal Computers to
Consumer Electronics." She chose
the topic because of its relation to
her future career goals.
"The paper 1 wrote for this class
was an excellent preparation for case
study consulting work," Daryanani
said."Considering 1 want to take up a
consulting career in the future. I will
be able to put the knowledge and re
search skills 1 gained from this paper
to good use."
Like Fuller, she also plans to apply
for a grant to continue her research.
Mayers used her paper, "Cafe
Culture. Inc.: The Modern Subver
sion of Intellectual Space." to apply


ALEX CHEE/The Stanford Daily
the class topic of globalization ef
fects to her interest in cultural stud
ies. 1 ler paper focused on the Star
bucks Corporation. She plans to
continue her research while studying
abroad.
"I have some ideas for other in
tellectual spaces." she said. "I would
like to continue my research next
year in Paris."
Hohmann. a managing editor at
Hie Daily, based his paper. "What's
the Matter with Yucca Mountain?
Government mismanagement and
local opposition bogs down $8 bil
lion waste storage 'solution.'" on a
six-part series that appeared in Hie
Daily last year. For his research, he
spent a full week reporting from
Yucca Mountain in Nevada, devot

ing more than 100 hours to inter
viewing politicians and citizens on
nuclear waste.
"1 continue to follow the situation
as it is unfolding."said I lohmann.who
has considered writing ;i book on his
topic. 1 le chose his paper topic because
of its connection to the University.
"A lot of what happens, relating
to nuclear waste, can be traced back
to Stanford," he said.
Above all. the winning papers
were chosen for their innovative,
and even risky, research approaches.
"IRA essays often approach a
topic from an unconventional per
spective." Goldberg said. "They're
the kinds of essays that now and t hen
find an instructor worrying that per
haps a student has undertaken too
ambitious a project for a quarter's
work. There's great satisfaction for
student and teacher alike when the
student succeeds in negotiating the
various and often substantial chal
lenges that emerge along the way."
