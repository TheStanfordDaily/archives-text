## PWR awards honor research innovation Ceremony rewards writers who push limits, Daily staff win top honors 
### JULIE KLEIN DESK EDITOR 
Research papers are a rite of pas
sage for freshman, yet few students
think about their work after turning
in paper work in a Red Bull-induced
haze. The Stanford Writing Center
looked to reverse that trend Wednes
day when it handed out the first batch
of Innovative Research Awards
(IRAs) for exceptional PWR papers.
In the past, first-year students en
rolled in the Program of Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) only had hopes of
receiving the highly coveted Boothe
Prize for Excellence in First-Year
Writing, which is awarded to the best
research papers each quarter. Unlike
the Boothe Prize, the new. less tradi
tional IRA focuses on a more cre
ative set of objectives.
"Both the Boothe Prize and the
IRA recognize thoughtful, effective
writing," Wendy Goldberg, assistant
director of the Stanford Writing Cen
ter. wrote in an email to The Daily.
The IRA, alternatively, highlights
"writing that gives clear evidence of
originality with respect to subject, re
search methods and style."
PWR Associate Director Marvin
Diogenes said he hopes the IRAs
will inspire better papers by exposing
students to their peers' innovative
research.
"We're always looking for ways to
put students' research in front of the
wider campus community." he said,
"particularly new students orienting
themselves to intellectual life at a re
search university."
The first IRAs were presented
Wednesday in Branner I hill to soph
omores Andrea Fuller, kashmira
Daryanani.Tina Zoecoli Mayers and
James Hohmann. Each spoke in de
tail about what they studied and how
they performed their research.

Fuller, a former Daily staff writer,
studied how the children of immi
grants adjust to university life in her
paper entitled "First in a New Class:
First-Generation College Students
and lTteir Assimilation into College
Culture." With the help of Writing
Center Director Clyde Moneyhun,
she plans to start a discussion group
for first-generation students.
1 uller is also applying for a ( 'hap
pell Lougee grant to continue her re
search. As a first-generation student
herself, she has a personal invest
ment in her work.
"1 was really passionate about the
topic, and I wanted to know about
this subject [beyond my paper]," she
said. "I was interested in seeing how
my own experiences related to gen
eral patterns and trends."
Daryanani suggested new mar
keting strategies for Apple Comput
er. Inc. in her paper, "The Future of
Apple: A Look at the Company's
Shift from Personal Computers to
Consumer Electronics." She chose
the topic because of its relation to
her future career goals.
"The paper 1 wrote for this class
was an excellent preparation for case
study consulting work," Daryanani
said."Considering 1 want to take up a
consulting career in the future. I will
be able to put the knowledge and re
search skills 1 gained from this paper
to good use."
Like Fuller, she also plans to apply
for a grant to continue her research.
Mayers used her paper, "Cafe
Culture. Inc.: The Modern Subver
sion of Intellectual Space." to apply
