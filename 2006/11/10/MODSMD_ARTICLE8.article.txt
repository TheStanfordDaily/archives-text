## Researchers discover possible stress cure Engineered "chimera" gene may limit anxiety's affect on brain memory 
### ADA YEE 
Around midterm season, stu
dents know all too well how stress
can impede their abilities to learn
and remember. Stanford scientists,
however, have taken this fact of life
to the next level. Iliey have engi
neered a gene that can restore cogni
tive function in stressed-out rats.The
finding may eventually prove useful
in combating the neurological side
effects of steroids, a common treat
ment for asthma and auto-inflamma
tory diseases such as arthritis.
The study, which appeared in the
November issue of the Journal of
Neuroscience, showed that a man
made gene referred to as "ER/GR"
can improve learning and memory in
rats that have been subjected to
stress. "ER" and "GR" stand for "es
trogen-receptor" and "glucocorti
coid-receptor," respectively. Just as
its name indicates, the new gene is a
fusion, or "chimera," of existing
genes that naturally code for each of
these two receptors.
Glucocorticoids are known as
"stress hormones." Under condi
tions of stress, these molecules are
secreted by the body and land in a
certain region of the brain called the
hippocampus. The hippocampus is a
key player in memory consolidation,
which is how glucocorticoids can
have such cognitively detrimental ef
fects. In contrast, estrogen — better
known for its role as a sex hormone
— has been shown to enhance spa
tial memory.
Cells in the hippocampus have re
ceptors for each of these two types of
signals, glucocorticoids and estro
gen. Each receptor has a region that

senses the presence of the signal and
a region that affects changes in the
cell. ER/GR encodes a receptor with
the glucocorticoid "sensor" region
and the estrogen "effector" region.
"Basically, we can turn the "bad"
effects of glucocorticoids into the
"good" effects of estrogen signals,"
said Andrea Nicholas, the first au
thor of the study and adjunct profes
sor at St. Mary's College. She has
been collaborating with Biological
Sciences Prof. Robert Sapolsky, a co
author of the paper.
Members of the Sapolsky lab pre
viously used the ER/GR gene to pro
tect neurons against the effects of
chemically-induced brain damage.
The current study grew out of this re
search. published in 2004.
"The logical next step was do be
havioral studies," Nicholas said. "We
wanted to find out something more
about spatial memory, and about the
effects of stress on memory."
In order to test this, Nicholas and
colleagues used the Morris Water
Maze paradigm: rats are placed in a
pool of water with a "hidden island"
beneath the water's surface. During
training, the rats become quicker
and quicker at finding this platform,
onto which they can climb aboard to
rest. Then, the platform is removed
and scientists record how long it
takes the rat to remember the spot
where the platform once was and the
number of times rats swim across the
it-a measure of the rats' memory.
"The Morris Water Maze is the
gold standard for tests of rats being
able to remember," Nicholas said.
First, Nicholas measured the rats'
performance on the test both in the
presence and absence of stress.
Nicholas and colleagues varied
acuteness of the stressors and time
over which stress was administered;
the types of stressors included every
thing from simply handling the rats
to constraining their movement or
exposing to cold. More importantly,
the researchers had groups of rats
subjected to stress either before, im
mediately after or 24 hours after
training on the Morris Water Maze.
"This taps into three different do
mains and three different timings-the
effects of stress on learning, on stor
ing learned information as memory
and on retrieving that memory,"
Sapolsky explained in a press release.
The scientists found that stress im
paired memory most when it oc
curred 24 hours after training. The
clincher of the study, however, was
that when ER/GR was delivered to
the hippocampus — by injection of a
virus with F.R/GR incorporated into
its genome — it had a "rescue" effect.
Rats given the chimeric gene looked
sooner and longer for the missing
platform.presumably because in spite
of the stress they had undergone, they
had effective cognitive function.
Researchers emphasize the ap
plications of this research, particu-
its potential for gene therapies.
Patients of multiple sclerosis and
rheumatoid arthritis, for example,
tiike corticoids in the long term to
treat their diseases.
"People who take high doses of
these steroids can also get clinically
depressed," Sapolsky said in a press
release.'in principle, you could use
gene therapy to protect them as well."
In recent years, delivery of such
therapies has been an obstacle in sci
ence and medicine. Practically
speaking, it is difficult to deliver
gene therapy at the present time.
However, Nicholas argued that
when a method of delivery has been
found, developments such as the
ER/GR gene will prove valuable.
"There been a lot of complica
tions with people trying to use gene
therapy in humans, especially with
going into brain, because of the
blood-brain barrier." Nicholas said.
"But we can't stop developing ideas
for treatments. When we are ready
to deliver we have to have these
things ready to go."
For now. however.gene therapies
in the lab can still be scientifically in
teresting. according to Nicholas. In
the future, Nicholas hopes to contin
ue using these constructs to untan
gle more subtle mechanisms behind
stress and cognitive ability.
"Gene therapy for the moment I
think is important, because we can
use these as tools." Nicholas said.
"It's not just an endpoint in treat
ment for a disease. We have some
thing that lets us see the mechanism
of how something works."
Nicholas described the situation
as one of "gene therapy tomorrow
and good research tools today."

about spatial memory, and about the
effects of stress on memory."
In order to test this, Nicholas and
colleagues used the Morris Water
Maze paradigm: rats are placed in a
pool of water with a "hidden island"
beneath the water's surface. During
training, the rats become quicker
and quicker at finding this platform,
onto which they can climb aboard to
rest. Then, the platform is removed
and scientists record how long it
takes the rat to remember the spot
where the platform once was and the
number of times rats swim across the
it-a measure of the rats' memory.
"The Morris Water Maze is the
gold standard for tests of rats being
able to remember," Nicholas said.
First, Nicholas measured the rats'
performance on the test both in the
presence and absence of stress.
Nicholas and colleagues varied
acuteness of the stressors and time
over which stress was administered;
the types of stressors included every
thing from simply handling the rats
to constraining their movement or
exposing to cold. More importantly,
the researchers had groups of rats
subjected to stress either before, im
mediately after or 24 hours after
training on the Morris Water Maze.
"This taps into three different do
mains and three different timings-the
effects of stress on learning, on stor
ing learned information as memory
and on retrieving that memory,"
Sapolsky explained in a press release.
The scientists found that stress im
paired memory most when it oc
curred 24 hours after training. The
clincher of the study, however, was
that when ER/GR was delivered to
the hippocampus — by injection of a
virus with F.R/GR incorporated into
its genome — it had a "rescue" effect.
Rats given the chimeric gene looked
sooner and longer for the missing
platform.presumably because in spite
of the stress they had undergone, they
had effective cognitive function.
Researchers emphasize the ap
plications of this research, particu-
its potential for gene therapies.
Patients of multiple sclerosis and
rheumatoid arthritis, for example,
tiike corticoids in the long term to
treat their diseases.
"People who take high doses of
these steroids can also get clinically
depressed," Sapolsky said in a press
release.'in principle, you could use
gene therapy to protect them as well."
In recent years, delivery of such
therapies has been an obstacle in sci
ence and medicine. Practically
speaking, it is difficult to deliver
gene therapy at the present time.
However, Nicholas argued that
when a method of delivery has been
found, developments such as the
ER/GR gene will prove valuable.
"There been a lot of complica
tions with people trying to use gene
therapy in humans, especially with
going into brain, because of the
blood-brain barrier." Nicholas said.
"But we can't stop developing ideas
for treatments. When we are ready
to deliver we have to have these
things ready to go."
For now. however.gene therapies
in the lab can still be scientifically in
teresting. according to Nicholas. In
the future, Nicholas hopes to contin
ue using these constructs to untan
gle more subtle mechanisms behind
stress and cognitive ability.
"Gene therapy for the moment I
think is important, because we can
use these as tools." Nicholas said.
"It's not just an endpoint in treat
ment for a disease. We have some
thing that lets us see the mechanism
of how something works."
Nicholas described the situation
as one of "gene therapy tomorrow
and good research tools today."
Around midterm season, stu
dents know all too well how stress
can impede their abilities to learn
and remember. Stanford scientists,
however, have taken this fact of life
to the next level. Iliey have engi
neered a gene that can restore cogni
tive function in stressed-out rats.The
finding may eventually prove useful
in combating the neurological side
effects of steroids, a common treat
ment for asthma and auto-inflamma
tory diseases such as arthritis.
The study, which appeared in the
November issue of the Journal of
Neuroscience, showed that a man
made gene referred to as "ER/GR"
can improve learning and memory in
rats that have been subjected to
stress. "ER" and "GR" stand for "es
trogen-receptor" and "glucocorti
coid-receptor," respectively. Just as
its name indicates, the new gene is a
fusion, or "chimera," of existing
genes that naturally code for each of
these two receptors.
Glucocorticoids are known as
"stress hormones." Under condi
tions of stress, these molecules are
secreted by the body and land in a
certain region of the brain called the
hippocampus. The hippocampus is a
key player in memory consolidation,
which is how glucocorticoids can
have such cognitively detrimental ef
fects. In contrast, estrogen — better
known for its role as a sex hormone
— has been shown to enhance spa
tial memory.
Cells in the hippocampus have re
ceptors for each of these two types of
signals, glucocorticoids and estro
gen. Each receptor has a region that

senses the presence of the signal and
a region that affects changes in the
cell. ER/GR encodes a receptor with
the glucocorticoid "sensor" region
and the estrogen "effector" region.
"Basically, we can turn the "bad"
effects of glucocorticoids into the
"good" effects of estrogen signals,"
said Andrea Nicholas, the first au
thor of the study and adjunct profes
sor at St. Mary's College. She has
been collaborating with Biological
Sciences Prof. Robert Sapolsky, a co
author of the paper.
Members of the Sapolsky lab pre
viously used the ER/GR gene to pro
tect neurons against the effects of
chemically-induced brain damage.
The current study grew out of this re
search. published in 2004.
