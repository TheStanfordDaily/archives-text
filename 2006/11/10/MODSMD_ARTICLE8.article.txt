## Researchers discover possible stress cure Engineered "chimera" gene may limit anxiety's affect on brain memory 
### ADA YEE 
Around midterm season, stu
dents know all too well how stress
can impede their abilities to learn
and remember. Stanford scientists,
however, have taken this fact of life
to the next level. Iliey have engi
neered a gene that can restore cogni
tive function in stressed-out rats.The
finding may eventually prove useful
in combating the neurological side
effects of steroids, a common treat
ment for asthma and auto-inflamma
tory diseases such as arthritis.
The study, which appeared in the
November issue of the Journal of
Neuroscience, showed that a man
made gene referred to as "ER/GR"
can improve learning and memory in
rats that have been subjected to
stress. "ER" and "GR" stand for "es
trogen-receptor" and "glucocorti
coid-receptor," respectively. Just as
its name indicates, the new gene is a
fusion, or "chimera," of existing
genes that naturally code for each of
these two receptors.
Glucocorticoids are known as
"stress hormones." Under condi
tions of stress, these molecules are
secreted by the body and land in a
certain region of the brain called the
hippocampus. The hippocampus is a
key player in memory consolidation,
which is how glucocorticoids can
have such cognitively detrimental ef
fects. In contrast, estrogen — better
known for its role as a sex hormone
— has been shown to enhance spa
tial memory.
Cells in the hippocampus have re
ceptors for each of these two types of
signals, glucocorticoids and estro
gen. Each receptor has a region that

senses the presence of the signal and
a region that affects changes in the
cell. ER/GR encodes a receptor with
the glucocorticoid "sensor" region
and the estrogen "effector" region.
"Basically, we can turn the "bad"
effects of glucocorticoids into the
"good" effects of estrogen signals,"
said Andrea Nicholas, the first au
thor of the study and adjunct profes
sor at St. Mary's College. She has
been collaborating with Biological
Sciences Prof. Robert Sapolsky, a co
author of the paper.
Members of the Sapolsky lab pre
viously used the ER/GR gene to pro
tect neurons against the effects of
chemically-induced brain damage.
The current study grew out of this re
search. published in 2004.
"The logical next step was do be
havioral studies," Nicholas said. "We
wanted to find out something more
about spatial memory, and about the
effects of stress on memory."
In order to test this, Nicholas and
colleagues used the Morris Water
Maze paradigm: rats are placed in a
pool of water with a "hidden island"
beneath the water's surface. During
training, the rats become quicker
and quicker at finding this platform,
onto which they can climb aboard to
rest. Then, the platform is removed
and scientists record how long it
takes the rat to remember the spot
where the platform once was and the
number of times rats swim across the
it-a measure of the rats' memory.
"The Morris Water Maze is the
gold standard for tests of rats being
able to remember," Nicholas said.
First, Nicholas measured the rats'
performance on the test both in the
presence and absence of stress.
Nicholas and colleagues varied
acuteness of the stressors and time
over which stress was administered;
the types of stressors included every
thing from simply handling the rats
