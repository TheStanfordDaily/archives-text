Think guarding Michael Jordan was hard? Try
eradicating inequalities in public education, for
mer Phoenix Suns guard Kevin Johnson told a
crowd at Schwab Residential Complex last night.
"Let me get this out there early: I went to
UC-Berkeley," began Johnson — drawing
chuckles from the event's 100 attendees — be
fore launching intoan overview of St. I lOPE.his
community-building program. Founded in l l W)
in his hometown of Sacramento, St. HOPE
began as an after-school program at Johnson's
alma mater Sacramento I ligh. Since then, he has

expanded it to include a $1 million after-school
facility, a cultural center and public schools that
provide high quality education to nearly 2.000
students.
Johnson used history to explain why he found
ed the St. HOPE project, describing how slaves
used to dig pits in the ground to meet in at night
and teach each other to read and write.
"If people were willing to risk their lives for
education back then. I certainly feel a responsibil
ity to do my part now." he said. "You cannot deny
a great education to somebody because of the
ZIP code they live in. We all need to do every
thing we can to make sure every kid has access to
a high quality education."
St. 11( )PE's approach to addressing inequality
is comprehensive, working for economic devel
opment and community rcvitali/.ation along with
public education. Economically, the foundation
has worked to bring businesses like Starbucks to
low-income neighborhoods.

"If you have a Starbucks, you go from being a
ghetto community to being a "community in tran
sition,'" said Johnson, noting that the St. HOPE
program lias brought 14 businesses, 282 jobs and
oversl I million in development to the Oak Park
neighborhood in Sacramento.
"Kids in poor communities, once they leave
school and walk through their community, they
see dilapidated buildings and drug pushers," he
said. "Their world doesn't make sense."
Johnson also emphasized the importance of a
bipartisan approach to making a difference.
"Hducation should and does transcend poli
tics." he said.
And Johnson stressed making education a pri
ority. regardless of one's major or career.
"Vou gotta be radical, you gotta be a little bit
crazy, you gotta believe in young people," he said.
"Whatever you do, do not ever lower your expec
tations for children."
