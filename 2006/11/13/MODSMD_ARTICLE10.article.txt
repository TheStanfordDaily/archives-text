## A 						FISH OUT OF WATER 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION BRITON 
There's a scene in the first "Austin Powers" movie
where Austin sits at a bar in Las Vegas and a group of
people laugh at him from a nearby table because he's
dressed funny, pointing at his silly clothes and his atro
ciously bad teeth. After having spent a sufficient amount
of time in England, going to a variety of different social
situations — parties and whatnot — I've discovered
that the reason why those people laughed at Austin. And
it wasn't his groovy clothes.
It was because Brits don't know how to party.
Or interact in a dancing environment for that matter
either. As an American student in a foreign land. I was
expecting to run into some cultural differences. Gaso
line is petrol, pants are trousers, underwear is pants and
rubbers arc something you erase with, not something
you take on a date "just in case." I just wasn't expecting
the differences to translate onto the dance floor. The
other night a gang of us Stanford folks — because that's
how all Americans travel in England, apparently —
went out to the local club. It seemed like a normal place
when we went in. The dance floor was packed, lights
were shooting this way and that, and the DJ was playing
some god-awful techno crap that screamed "get that girl
pregnant." You know, the typical European club.
Only the British were there. All the stereotypes of the
British being rightfully "proper" hold true, especially in
a club. There they stood, like a herd of slothful wilde
beest, scarcely moving lest they spill the drinks in their
hand. I'm no Baryshnikov,but I'm pretty sure that dance
floors are made for a specific purpose. Not a soul was
dancing. Everyone stood around in their respectable,
stodgy manners trying to talk over the music. What's
worse, when we tried to assert our American-ness by ac-

tually dancing, they pushed us out of the way. Literally.
In my country, wars have been started for less. But not

wanting to start an international incident, we left.

English scene, uoing to a college party
(think frat party without the threat of STDs) on all

hallows eve. I expected to see the creative wit of Oxford's
brightest on display. At the very least, 1 expected girls in
skimpy outfits and self-confidence indirectly proportion
al to their self esteem. But. surprise surprise. 1 was dis-

appointed. Seemingly stuck at eight years old.

English guys dressed in scary costumes
of bloody ghouls and wilting mummies
completely unaware that Halloween
when you're in your 20s means trying to
"out-offensive" the next guys' Crocodil
Hunter vs. Stingray costume (too soon for

that joke?). Sticking to every social rule of
propriety, the women dressed in the most
conservative outfits leading me to the
conclusion that I lalloween in England is

an entirely celibate holiday.
How, then, do the time-honored traditions of
courtship get carried out if not in the party setting? Cer
tainly it's not at the clubs where female members of our
American gang have gone up to English men. asking
them to dance only to get a deer-in-headlights reaction.
Assertiveness is not a character trait the Brits find ap
pealing in a dance partner. Such stiff responses such
have led even the most sheltered of our crew to sigh in
desperation. "I want a male," a sentiment undoubtedly
shared by every female in Britain. How does this coun
try ever sustain its population?

The library. The only place to interact with members of
the opposite sex without getting a condescending sneer
is in a place where talking is prohibited. Ironic, isn't it?
Parties and clubs are merely the pre-party for the flirta
tions over the copy machine and the subsequently awk
ward "you want to get a pasty?" (Which, by the way, is a
pastry in Britain, not something you stick on your ex
posed breast.)
So be glad that you are in America. Your chances of
actually enjoying yourself when you go out dancing are
multiplied thousand-fold. Because let's face it, nobody
parties quite like the British.
