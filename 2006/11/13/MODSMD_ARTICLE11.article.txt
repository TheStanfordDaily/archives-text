From the alt-country melancholy of The Band and Lucinda Williams
to the indie mellowness of My Morning Jacket and Yo La Tengo,
here are thirteen different flavors of soothing timbres and lethargic
melodies for the partier unwinding after a long night of gratifying
exertion, the overwrought academic unshackling the mind from a
thousand theories or the leisurely lounger sinking slowly into a
couch of intense comfort. Immerse yourself in a sweeping aural
collage of washy ride cymbals, thick organ tones and sparse, rever
berating guitar lines; let the music soak into the walls, enveloping
you in a comforting sonic blanket, or just let it sound faintly in the
distance as you slowly drift away. For fans of downtempo, this will
help you chill-out, or just plain relax.
