# Prolific Oven offers precious pies
## 
### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION COOKIE EATER 
Walking down University Av
enue, you will see many a pastry
shop...and I am sure they are all pret
ty good. But, if you turn right on Wa
verly Street, you will find a bakery
called The Prolific Oven whose deli
cious desserts are truly worth your
time. The amazing array of pastries,
pies, cakes and cookies make up for
the lack of decoration in the rest of
the shop. Plus, if you are indecisive
like me. you will not even notice what
the store looks like because all of
your attention will go into choosing
which tasty treat is right for you.
The food not only looks great in
the clear displays, but it also tastes
great. As a huge pumpkin pie fan, I

know a good pumpkin pie when 1 eat
one, and the Prolific Oven's pumpkin
pie definitely made my good list. Also.
I would definitely suggest trying one
of their many coffee concoctions.The
Avalanche, which was a mix of white
chocolate, caramel, coffee and ice
cream, was a huge hit for my friends
and hit was undeniably a step up from
your typical Starbucks frappuccino.
The White Chocolate Strawberry
Cream Cake was delicious also, but it
was a little too rich and had too much
whipped cream (if you believe in such
a thing). The only big disappointment
was that they were out of carrot cake
(although that does, in a way. show
that the cake must be pretty popular).
Also, if you don't want to believe
me that the desserts were truly spe
cial. The Prolific Oven has won the

"Best Dessert" category in the Palo
Alto Weekly for the past few years. In
fact, you can see the numerous
awards it has won in the "Best Cake"
and "Best Dessert" categories hung
on the wall to the left of the register.
The prices are not great, but not
outrageous ($3.50 for a slice of pie,
$3.25 for the frappuccino), and the
staff is very friendly. Unfortunately,
the wooden seats and tables are kind
of boring, and the high ceilings make
the store a little less cozy than most
other pastry shops. But, like I said be
fore. t he quality of the food makes up
for these blemishes, and if you want
to have a tasty dessert in a casual, fun
store with your friends, 1 would defi
nitely recommendThe Prolific Oven.

verly Street will not go unrewarded.
