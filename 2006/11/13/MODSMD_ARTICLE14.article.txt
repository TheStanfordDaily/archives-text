Dear Ms. Manners.
My roommate is a little too chummy with her
snooze button. Whenever it goes off. she pushes it
repeatedly, every eight minutes, for the next
hour... every ..single...morning. Even though she
has class much earlier than me. 1 haven't been
able to enjoy that precious last hour of rest every
morning because I'm a really light sleeper. I 'd be
willing to do anything for uninterrupted slumber.
Suggestions? — Frazzled and Fatigued in FloMo
Dear Fatigued,
If you're feeling disgruntled about your lack of
sleep and want to go the meaner route, you
should just turn your roommate's alarm off either
after the first snooze-hit or sometime at night
after she goes to sleep. After she misses class a few
times, she'll learn not to be so friendly with Mr.
Snooze. Unfortunately, she will also have a
vendetta against you unless if you can convince
her that mysterious furry night creatures are re
sponsible for tampering with the alarm (the
thought will probably keep her up so the alarm
won't be needed anyway).
Then again, you're already tired so you might
as well have fun with this. 1 lere are some creative
suggestions if you don't mind sacrificing even
more sleep in hopes to potentially sever the tie
between your roommate and the Snooze (keep in
mind that you may simultaneously sever the ties
between you and your roommate in the process.
Oops!) Place her alarm in an unreachable place
— a pile of laundry, right outside of the door or. if
you're feeling extra devious, tie it from the ceiling
and suspend it inches above her desperately
drowsy grasp. Vou could also borrow or purchase
multiple alarms, set them to the same time and
scatter them throughout the room. 1 offer both of
these suggestions in hopes that by actually getting
up. your roommate will be roused from sleep — if
she is willing to get up. search, press multiple but
tons, half-contemplate if she's going insane and

STILL get back into bed only to do it all over
again eight minutes later, you are out of luck. kid.
If you'd rather forgo passive-aggressiveness
for all-out rage, there are several options for you.
Like throwing the alarm out the window (after
angrily ripping out the screen). You could also
snip the chord, take out the batteries,cancel Cin
gular or demolish whatever else is keeping that
alarm alive. Your neighbors might think you're a
little whack when you walk out of the room with
a sledgehammer and a bunch o' wires, but what
ever. It's for a good cause.
Actually, you could just, you know, talk your
roommate about her snoozing issues. That'd
probably be the easiest thing to d 0... short of get
ting ear plugs.
Dear Ms. Manners,
My roommate is driving me nuts. When she
wakes up. she's on her cell phone. Before she goes
to sleep, she's on her cell phone. In between her
classes, she's on her cell phone. Basically, she's al
ways on her cell phone. I adore her and all. but 1
really hate her cell phone. Mow can I get her to
stop talking so much on the phone while in our
room? — Ticked in Toyon
Dear Ticked,
This is a tough one. My knee-jerk response is
to tell your roommate to talk in the hallway in
stead. But then everybody in the dorm will get an
noyed and within days she will be known around
the dorm as "the girl that's always on her phone."
And you wouldn't want to do that to your

beloved roomie, would you? Yeah, I didn't think
so. So on to some other suggestions.
The easiest would be to somehow "accidental
ly" break her phone, but chances are she'll get it
fixed in a jiffy so that's a no-go. If she's talking to
her boyfriend or best friend, you could always try
to undermine their relationship by saying things
like, "You know... your boyfriend calls an awful
lot. Are you sure he isn't dependent on you and
trying to distract you from more important things
like studying and not driving your roommate
nuts?" Or you could answer the phone when your
roommate's in the bathroom, yelling into the re
ceiver. "Hey roomie, that crazy friend that you al
ways complain about is calling." lliat ought to
guarantee at least a week of silent treatment be
tween them, which translates into a week of peace
and quiet for you.
If you're feeling more industrious and have
some friends in the mechanical engineering de
partment,you could fashion a sound-proof booth
around your roommate's bed. There are lots of
benefits to this one. so if you have the resources,
I 'd get cracking now. No need to worry about the
contusion it will cause during room inspections
come winter break — as long as the booth isn't lit
by candles or halogen lights, you're good to go.
Another suggestion is to convince your room
mate to switch to Verizon. Her reception will be
so bad inside of the dorm that she'll have no
chance but to go outside. Although you'll proba
bly have to put up with her saying, "Hello!?
Hello!? I can't hear you" 100 times a day, it'll be
worth it when she leaves the room in exaspera
tion, waving her phone spastically as she searches
for reception.
Actually, you could just, you know, talk your
roommate about her cell phone issues. That'd
probably be the easiest thing to d 0... short of get
ting ear plugs.
