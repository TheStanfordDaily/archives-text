## Editorial Board A 						loophole in the housing system 
### 
Students who are currently studying
abroad at a Stanford program will re
ceive their housing assignments for
winter quarter on Nov. 19. This year, many
students are nursing high hopes of receiving
prime assignments. There are an unusual
number of desirable spots opening on the
row due to the re-opening of Durand and
the moving of Durand staff out Xanadu and
680. Although these events might provide
more prime housing than is usual for winter
quarter returnees, students coming back
from abroad might be surprised at exactly
how many of these spots have already been
snapped up. a problem that may threaten
the very foundations of Stanford's housing
system.
Before housing is assigned to returning
students, it is generally first assigned to an
other type of student — the crafty or diffi
cult student, depending on whom you ask.
Termination of Occupancy Cards (TOC's)
were due on Oct. 27.This means that on this
date, the 1 lousing Assignments Office knew
the majority of spots that would be open for
students wishing to get housing for the win
ter. This also means that students who were
on the look-out knew about these openings
as well. One such student, Merrit Baer, used
this knowledge to his advantage and will
live in Xanadu this winter.
Baer, a senior currently living in Haus
Mitteleuropa. said he believes that "there
are ways of getting housing that don't in
volve going through the draw. I don't think
those ways are cheating. I think that they
are part of the system."
This is a valid point. Although the poli
cies surrounding housing assignment at
Stanford strive to be fair, a few particularly
driven students seems to always find a way
to get assigned to top-housing in a manner
which other, less savvy, students might con
sider less than just.
Case in point: the Housing Assignments
Office guarantees housing for every stu
dent for all four years that they are on cam
pus. Technically. the policy is as follows: "A
guarantee constitutes a pledge of housing
only if you apply for housing by May 14.
2006 [for the 2006-2007 academic yearj and
are willing to live in any residence for which
you are eligible. You must select 'assign me
to any residence for which I am eligible' as
your final choice on your application in the
Draw in order to be guaranteed an assign
ment by the end of the first week of classes
for any given quarter." This policy was de

veloped to make sure that every undergrad
uate student has a place to live. I lowever, if
one were so motivated, one could in fact get
better housing by taking a gamble and fore
going the Guaranteed Housing Plan.
If a student received a terrible draw
number, he could avoid living in Burbank
by listing only the most desirable housing as
his top eight preferences. By not checking
the "assign me to any residence for which I
am eligible" box, he would most likely not
be assigned to any housing and added to the
waiting list. Iliis student would receive a
higher spot on the waiting list than students
who had done a non-Stanford program and
wanted to return to the Farm in the fall, as
well as be placed higher than students who
had refused their housing assignments pre
viously. Over the summer, the student
would wait to receive the results of his wait
ing list assignment. Waiting list assignments
are typically wild cards — the spaces that
open up may run the gamut from Serra to
Jerry. If the student is still not satisfied with
his assignment, he can even reject his wait
ing list assignment and enter the walk-in
pool, in which case he again is placed as a
high-priority student. Walk-ins are a gam
ble. but one that if you don't really need
Stanford housing, might be worth the risk.
Housing roulette is just one avenue that
motivated students can go down to try and
get the housing that they want. If all else
fails, there are always allergies, specific food
needs and old sport injuries to pave the way
into the disability draw, even after the offi
cial disability deadline has long-passed.
The problem with students finding cre
ative ways to get the housing they want is
that it threatens the entire housing assign
ment process. After all. our housing system
works because it is based on acceptance of
the (at times suspect) randomness of the
draw. Whether you are given a 35 or a 2850,
Stanford housing works because you accept
your fate.The minute that more than a small
minority chooses to exploit the loopholes in
the system is the minute that our system
breaks down. Perhaps this small minority
will never become large enough to merit a
change in the system. Perhaps the number
of people who care about their housing
enough to explore alternate avenues for as
signment is quite small. These individuals
do not seem to currently disrupt the system.
But, if this group of people continues to
grow, the housing system at Stanford may
indeed be in trouble.
