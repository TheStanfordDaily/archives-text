# A 						little PSA about HPV
## 
### 
I was sporting twin bandages on my upper
arms last Friday. One was from a He
patitis B vaccine, the other from an lIPV
vaccine. I told people pitifully when they
asked. I'm a huge wimp when it comes to
shots, and despite Vaden's unusually nice
nurse. I almost passed out in the lobby (I
managed to sit down and recover, which
was good, because passing out in the midst
of Vaden Health Center means leaving
yourself unconscious during Vaden medical
care).
But it I expected sympathy from my lis
teners (1 expect sympathy from a paper cut),
1 was rewarded with an awkward silence.
Most people didn't want to say anything, but
eventually someone asked, half kidding, if I
planned on having a lot of sex. then.
Ah.
See. it hadn't occurred to me beforehand
that there was anything potentially embar
rassing about the IIPV vaccine, or that it
might be interpreted as a sign of promiscuity,
of all things. We're talking about a vaccine
that's being recommended for girls as young
as nine, which is an age group that hasn't
fully moved past Barbie yet. The fact that a
link between the HPV vaccine and promis
cuity would even occur to someone reflects
a fundamental misunderstanding about just
how disturbingly prevalent the virus is.
So. ladies (and gentlemen), let's talk a lit
tle bit about the Human Papilloma Virus.
According to the CDC. about 20 million
people in the United States currently have
HPV. and SO percent—HO percent —of
women will have had a genital HPV infec
tion by the time they reach the age of 50.
Genital HPV (there are roughly 100 strains
of HPV. of which 40 are genital) can cause
such delightful symptoms as genital warts,
hut there are often no symptoms whatsoev
er. So. the virus can easily be spread by peo

pie who have no idea they are even carrying
it. including partners in a long-term, monog
amous relationship who could have been
carrying the virus for years. Condoms are
somewhat effective in preventing HPV, hut,
in Planned Parenthood's ominous words,
"Most people who have ever hail sex have
HPV at some point in their lives."
Delightful. But if there are often no
symptoms, what's the big deal?
Well, for one thing, there is a strong link
between HPV infections and certain types
of cancer, cervical in particular. While most
HPV infections go away without any ill ef
fects. according to the CDC, the infection
sometimes leads to cell changes that develop
into cancerous growths.
In fact. HPV is linked to almost all eervi
cal cancers, and 70 percent of cervical cancer
cases are caused by two specific strains of the
virus (American Cancer Society). Cervical
cancer itself causes about 190.000 deaths
each year worldwide, and is the second lead
ing cause of cancer death for women, second
only to breast cancer (Women's Cancer Re
search Institute).
I .uckily. we have some powerful weapons
in our arsenal: the mighty Pap smear, and the
new HPV vaccine.
First, the P;ip smear. Yes. it's awkward
and uncomfortable. But us ladies are lucky


Matikainen
Slightly Sinister
to have it — for one thing, guys are
also susceptible to cancers linked to
IIPV (penile and anal, for example),
but they have no equivalent of the
Pap smear. For another, cervical can
cer was once the leading cause of
cancer death for women in the U.S..
but the early detection offered by
Pap smears has drastically reduced
those numbers (ACS). Even after the
11PV vaccination,regular pap smears
are an important way to guard
against the other strains of the virus
that aren't covered by the vaccine.
Now. as for the HPV vaccine —
this is amazing stuff, guys. It was ap
proved last June by the FDA. in prac
tically record time. It protects against
the two HPV strains that cause 70
percent of cases of cervical cancer,
and the two strains of HPV that
cause 90 percent of genital warts.
The HPV vaccine is a good idea
for all women, but in particular,
women who aren't having sex will get

the most benefit from it.The vaccine
works best (obviously) if you get it
before you're exposed to the virus,
which is why the CDC has recom
mended that all 11 to 12 year old girls
be vaccinated. And the more people
who get it.the more difficult it is for
the virus to spread.
The American Cancer Society
cited a recent study which found that
more than half of college-age
women (our age.just to be especially
emphatic) will be infected with HPV
within four years of first having had
sex.
So while 1 understand that STl's
are awkward to talk about, there's no
reason to be embarrassed about tak
ing care of oneself.
If you're thinking of having sex
anytime soon (or anytime at all. real
ly). you should be considering this
vaccine very seriously, and verv soon.

I was sporting twin bandages on my upper
arms last Friday. One was from a He
patitis B vaccine, the other from an lIPV
vaccine. I told people pitifully when they
asked. I'm a huge wimp when it comes to
shots, and despite Vaden's unusually nice
nurse. I almost passed out in the lobby (I
managed to sit down and recover, which
was good, because passing out in the midst
of Vaden Health Center means leaving
yourself unconscious during Vaden medical
care).
But it I expected sympathy from my lis
teners (1 expect sympathy from a paper cut),
1 was rewarded with an awkward silence.
Most people didn't want to say anything, but
eventually someone asked, half kidding, if I
planned on having a lot of sex. then.
Ah.
See. it hadn't occurred to me beforehand
that there was anything potentially embar
rassing about the IIPV vaccine, or that it
might be interpreted as a sign of promiscuity,
of all things. We're talking about a vaccine
that's being recommended for girls as young
as nine, which is an age group that hasn't
fully moved past Barbie yet. The fact that a
link between the HPV vaccine and promis
cuity would even occur to someone reflects
a fundamental misunderstanding about just
how disturbingly prevalent the virus is.
So. ladies (and gentlemen), let's talk a lit
tle bit about the Human Papilloma Virus.
According to the CDC. about 20 million
people in the United States currently have
HPV. and SO percent—HO percent —of
women will have had a genital HPV infec
tion by the time they reach the age of 50.
Genital HPV (there are roughly 100 strains
of HPV. of which 40 are genital) can cause
such delightful symptoms as genital warts,
hut there are often no symptoms whatsoev
er. So. the virus can easily be spread by peo

pie who have no idea they are even carrying
it. including partners in a long-term, monog
amous relationship who could have been
carrying the virus for years. Condoms are
somewhat effective in preventing HPV, hut,
in Planned Parenthood's ominous words,
"Most people who have ever hail sex have
HPV at some point in their lives."
Delightful. But if there are often no
symptoms, what's the big deal?
Well, for one thing, there is a strong link
between HPV infections and certain types
of cancer, cervical in particular. While most
HPV infections go away without any ill ef
fects. according to the CDC, the infection
sometimes leads to cell changes that develop
into cancerous growths.
In fact. HPV is linked to almost all eervi
cal cancers, and 70 percent of cervical cancer
cases are caused by two specific strains of the
virus (American Cancer Society). Cervical
cancer itself causes about 190.000 deaths
each year worldwide, and is the second lead
ing cause of cancer death for women, second
only to breast cancer (Women's Cancer Re
search Institute).
I .uckily. we have some powerful weapons
in our arsenal: the mighty Pap smear, and the
new HPV vaccine.
First, the P;ip smear. Yes. it's awkward
and uncomfortable. But us ladies are lucky

Slightly Sinister
to have it — for one thing, guys are
also susceptible to cancers linked to
IIPV (penile and anal, for example),
but they have no equivalent of the
Pap smear. For another, cervical can
cer was once the leading cause of
cancer death for women in the U.S..
but the early detection offered by
Pap smears has drastically reduced
those numbers (ACS). Even after the
11PV vaccination,regular pap smears
are an important way to guard
against the other strains of the virus
that aren't covered by the vaccine.
Now. as for the HPV vaccine —
this is amazing stuff, guys. It was ap
proved last June by the FDA. in prac
tically record time. It protects against
the two HPV strains that cause 70
percent of cases of cervical cancer,
and the two strains of HPV that
cause 90 percent of genital warts.
The HPV vaccine is a good idea
for all women, but in particular,
women who aren't having sex will get

the most benefit from it.The vaccine
works best (obviously) if you get it
before you're exposed to the virus,
which is why the CDC has recom
mended that all 11 to 12 year old girls
be vaccinated. And the more people
who get it.the more difficult it is for
the virus to spread.
The American Cancer Society
cited a recent study which found that
more than half of college-age
women (our age.just to be especially
emphatic) will be infected with HPV
within four years of first having had
sex.
So while 1 understand that STl's
are awkward to talk about, there's no
reason to be embarrassed about tak
ing care of oneself.
If you're thinking of having sex
anytime soon (or anytime at all. real
ly). you should be considering this
vaccine very seriously, and verv soon.
