						little PSA about HPV

### 
I was sporting twin bandages on my upper
arms last Friday. One was from a He
patitis B vaccine, the other from an lIPV
vaccine. I told people pitifully when they
asked. I'm a huge wimp when it comes to
shots, and despite Vaden's unusually nice
nurse. I almost passed out in the lobby (I
managed to sit down and recover, which
was good, because passing out in the midst
of Vaden Health Center means leaving
yourself unconscious during Vaden medical
care).
But it I expected sympathy from my lis
teners (1 expect sympathy from a paper cut),
1 was rewarded with an awkward silence.
Most people didn't want to say anything, but
eventually someone asked, half kidding, if I
planned on having a lot of sex. then.
Ah.
See. it hadn't occurred to me beforehand
that there was anything potentially embar
rassing about the IIPV vaccine, or that it
might be interpreted as a sign of promiscuity,
of all things. We're talking about a vaccine
that's being recommended for girls as young
as nine, which is an age group that hasn't
fully moved past Barbie yet. The fact that a
link between the HPV vaccine and promis
cuity would even occur to someone reflects
a fundamental misunderstanding about just
how disturbingly prevalent the virus is.
So. ladies (and gentlemen), let's talk a lit
tle bit about the Human Papilloma Virus.
According to the CDC. about 20 million
people in the United States currently have
HPV. and SO percent—HO percent —of
women will have had a genital HPV infec
tion by the time they reach the age of 50.
Genital HPV (there are roughly 100 strains
of HPV. of which 40 are genital) can cause
such delightful symptoms as genital warts,
hut there are often no symptoms whatsoev
er. So. the virus can easily be spread by peo

pie who have no idea they are even carrying
it. including partners in a long-term, monog
amous relationship who could have been
carrying the virus for years. Condoms are
somewhat effective in preventing HPV, hut,
in Planned Parenthood's ominous words,
"Most people who have ever hail sex have
HPV at some point in their lives."
Delightful. But if there are often no
symptoms, what's the big deal?
Well, for one thing, there is a strong link
between HPV infections and certain types
of cancer, cervical in particular. While most
HPV infections go away without any ill ef
fects. according to the CDC, the infection
sometimes leads to cell changes that develop
into cancerous growths.
In fact. HPV is linked to almost all eervi
cal cancers, and 70 percent of cervical cancer
cases are caused by two specific strains of the
virus (American Cancer Society). Cervical
cancer itself causes about 190.000 deaths
each year worldwide, and is the second lead
ing cause of cancer death for women, second
only to breast cancer (Women's Cancer Re
search Institute).
I .uckily. we have some powerful weapons
in our arsenal: the mighty Pap smear, and the
new HPV vaccine.
First, the P;ip smear. Yes. it's awkward
and uncomfortable. But us ladies are lucky
