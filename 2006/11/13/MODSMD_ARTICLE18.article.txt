You're not going to believe this, but
American conservatives won a signif
icant international victory last week.
Buried beneath the drama and the many
analyses of the midterm elections' conse
quences. the Bush administration managed
to score points for a pro-globalization, con
servative economic agenda by bringing
Vladimir Putin's Russia closer to accession to
the World Trade Organization. And if they
played their cards light while making the
deal, they may have revitalized a faltering al
liance to better confront Iran's nuclear pro
gram.
Russia has been pushing for such an ac
cession since IW3. before the WTO had even
been founded to replace another interna
tional trade organization. Although the
Russian Federation controls the largest
economy outside the WTO. its battle to join
has been an uphill one. Issues ranging from
the Kremlin's foreign policy to its human
rights record to its failure to enforce intellec
tual property law have allowed Western crit
ics plenty of latitude to shut out their former
Communist nemesis. Hie climate for the
talks has been so bad that, as recently as last

July. Russia's chief negotiator on the WTO
issue. Maxim Medvedkov, pessimistically an
nounced that Russia would probably not
enter the WTO in 2006 or even 2007.
Kremlin behavior has not changed but. as
of last week. Western policy has. in spite of
continued Russian stonewalling on prescrib
ing punishments for the Tehran's nuclear
program. What could be behind this? To my
mind, there is another important factor in ex
plaining Washington's sudden generosity.
Iliis is Vietnam, which, as of last Tuesday, be
came the only nation to accede to the WTO
in 2006 Perhaps not eoincidentally, Friday's
Russo-American WTO agreement will be
signed and formalized this week in the Viet
namese capital of I lanoi.

Before I pursue this train of thought, this
is a good moment to address the question:
What exactly is the WTO? The World Trade
Organization is an economic consortium of
150 countries. Nominally, its role is to pro
mote international trade worldwide, primari
ly through reducing tariffs and regulating
trade disputes among its member states. In
existence since 1995 (when it replaced the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GAIT), the WTO is a key organ of so-called
globalization, regulating not only merchan
dising and industrial sectors of the global
economy, but the large and growing service
sector, as well.
From the point of view of nations with
comparatively small economies, one of the
major advantages of joining the WTO is that
it levels the playing field in international
trade negotiations. Because of the Dispute
Settlements Panels — a set of subsidiary or
ganizations within the WTO — major eco
nomic powers like the United States cannot
so easily abuse their influence when con
structing trade relations with weaker states

like Vietnam. Although many criti
cize the organization for maintaining
asymmetric trade relations between
the richest states and the developing
world,countries like Vietnam have a
better chance of getting a fair deal
with a WTO membership than with
out one.
This brings us back to the inter
esting question of why economic gi
ants like the United States would be
interested in making WTO members
of Communist-ruled Vietnam and of
an increasingly confrontational Rus
sia.
In the case of Vietnam, the an
swer might be simple dollars and
cents. Other Southeast Asian states,
but Vietnam in particular, are en
croaching on China's status as the
world's premier source of cheap
manufacturing. In some ways, Viet
nam today is where China stood 10
or 15 years ago — a state dominated
by the Communist Party, yet willing
to ignore Marxist economics in order
to play in the capitalist global mar

ket. Vietnam's accession to the WTO
is for this reason a victory for those
conservatives who believe that free
trade and democracy are mutually
promoting. A liberalization of trade
with industrious Vietnam plays into
the conservative article of faith that
such a capitalist expansion will one
day lead to political reforms. Given
the pro-middle class, protectionist
leanings of the new Democratic
Congress, the Bush administration
was perhaps more successful than
they imagined they would be in sub
tly advancing a pro-globalization
(pro-outsourcing) conservative
agenda.
Yet the proofs of the conserva
tive. "democracy-equals-capitalism
equals-democracy" philosophy have
been mixed in the case of oil-glutted
Russia. Here a transition to capital
ism has stalled on an ambiguous sort
of authoritarianism. But in principle
the same reformist arguments apply
as in Vietnam or China, provided
Moscow's energy revenues do not
remain so disproportionately high.
'ITie major question regarding Rus
sia's accession to the WTO has been
about how long the prospect of join
ing the WTO can be used to squeeze
reforms out of the Kremlin. Accord

ing to this strategy, cooperation on
the part of the Russians would be re
warded with less Western opposition
to their WTO accession until, even
tually, Russia joins as a full member.
Yet Putin's Russia has not been
cooperating with the West. Rather, it
has been impeding American initia
tives at virtually every turn. Why.
then, would the Bush team suddenly
choose this moment to reverse
course and bring Russia within reach
of an objective it has sought for al
most 15 years?
Scan your news outlets in the
coming weeks for an unexpected in
dication of Russo-American collab
oration. My money, and my hope, is
that we'll finally see some adjust
ment of Russia's softballing on Iran.
If Condoleezza Rice's diplomats
were smart and skilled enough to
bring Russia into the American-Eu
ropean camp on the Iranian issue by
advancing Moscow's WTO status,
then this White House might have
snatched not only an economic but
also a geopolitical victory from the
jaws of electoral defeat.
