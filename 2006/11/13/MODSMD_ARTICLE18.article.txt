You're not going to believe this, but
American conservatives won a signif
icant international victory last week.
Buried beneath the drama and the many
analyses of the midterm elections' conse
quences. the Bush administration managed
to score points for a pro-globalization, con
servative economic agenda by bringing
Vladimir Putin's Russia closer to accession to
the World Trade Organization. And if they
played their cards light while making the
deal, they may have revitalized a faltering al
liance to better confront Iran's nuclear pro
gram.
Russia has been pushing for such an ac
cession since IW3. before the WTO had even
been founded to replace another interna
tional trade organization. Although the
Russian Federation controls the largest
economy outside the WTO. its battle to join
has been an uphill one. Issues ranging from
the Kremlin's foreign policy to its human
rights record to its failure to enforce intellec
tual property law have allowed Western crit
ics plenty of latitude to shut out their former
Communist nemesis. Hie climate for the
talks has been so bad that, as recently as last

July. Russia's chief negotiator on the WTO
issue. Maxim Medvedkov, pessimistically an
nounced that Russia would probably not
enter the WTO in 2006 or even 2007.
Kremlin behavior has not changed but. as
of last week. Western policy has. in spite of
continued Russian stonewalling on prescrib
ing punishments for the Tehran's nuclear
program. What could be behind this? To my
mind, there is another important factor in ex
plaining Washington's sudden generosity.
Iliis is Vietnam, which, as of last Tuesday, be
came the only nation to accede to the WTO
in 2006 Perhaps not eoincidentally, Friday's
Russo-American WTO agreement will be
signed and formalized this week in the Viet
namese capital of I lanoi.

Before I pursue this train of thought, this
is a good moment to address the question:
What exactly is the WTO? The World Trade
Organization is an economic consortium of
150 countries. Nominally, its role is to pro
mote international trade worldwide, primari
ly through reducing tariffs and regulating
trade disputes among its member states. In
existence since 1995 (when it replaced the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GAIT), the WTO is a key organ of so-called
globalization, regulating not only merchan
dising and industrial sectors of the global
economy, but the large and growing service
sector, as well.
From the point of view of nations with
comparatively small economies, one of the
major advantages of joining the WTO is that
it levels the playing field in international
trade negotiations. Because of the Dispute
Settlements Panels — a set of subsidiary or
ganizations within the WTO — major eco
nomic powers like the United States cannot
so easily abuse their influence when con
structing trade relations with weaker states
