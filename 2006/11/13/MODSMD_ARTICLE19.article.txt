## What apartheid is and is not 
### AMICHAI MAGEN 
How would you react if a Stanford stu
dent organization announced the establish
ment of a new group called Students Con
fronting British Nazism, or Students Con
fronting Women's Blame for Rape? ()r how
about Students Confronting African Ameri
can Inferiority? Anyone with a moral bone in
his body would clearly be flooded by feelings
of incredulity, followed by outrage. Why? lie
cause these group names not only assert a
blatant lie. they are also deeply offensive and
dangerous. The British are no Nazis, women
are never to blame for rape and African
Americans are not "inferior" to anyone. The
purpose of such a group would be purely neg
ative — its very ambition to dehumanize and
delegitimize an entire group of people. Sure
ly no Stanford student organization would
stoop so low, right?
Wrong! By announcing last week that it
was creating a new group called Students
Confronting Apartheid in Israel — and
launching a series of assaults accusing Israel
of institutionalized racism, the Stanford stu

dent organization Coalition for Justice in the
Middle East (CJME) -demonstrated that
when il comes to the Jewish people, even the
most abusive and pernicious lies are fair
game on campus.
Apartheid — the official policy of racial
"apartness" — strangled South African non
whites for decades, crippling countless lives
with laws involving political, legal, and eco
nomic discrimination based on racial hatred.
The politicized claims of Israeli "apartheid"
distort the historical record and denigrate
the suffering of Black South African victims.
Hie analogy between apartheid and Israel
is absurd.The revival of national sovereignty
in the Jewish homeland is not a manifestation
of European colonialism, in contrast to the
white settlers (Afrikaans, English and oth
ers) who created Johannesburg and Pretoria.
Jews are indigenous to the Middle East as is
the Jewish national language, I lebrew. Any
one who has ever visited Israel knows that it
is one of the most diverse multi-ethnic
democracies in the world.
While South African apartheid was based
on denial of sovereignty for the black popu

lution, Israelis accepted the two-state solu- •
tion from the beginning, including the 1947*
UN partition plan. And while black labor was
exploited in slavery-like conditions under
apartheid. Palestinians are dependent on Is-*
raeli employment due to their leaders' own
corruption and economic failures. Israel does
not benefit from cheap and unskilled Pales-J
tinian labor. Rather, Palestinian dependency •
is a drain on both societies. It is not surpris
ing. therefore, that Columbia University t
president Lee Bollinger called the compari-'*
son ot Israel to apartheid "grotesque and of-'
fensive."
Apartheid? Israel is the sole liberal!
democracy in the Middle East. Is it perfect?
Ot course not. No human society can ever be.
I lowever. Israel is the only place in the Mid-«
die East where Arab citizens possess equal *
rights (for more details, visit Freedom House
at www.freedomhouse.org). Israeli Arab citi
zens have full parliamentary representation.*
vote their conscience, sit on Israel's Supreme
Court, worship freely and criticize the gov-
ernment (constantly!) without fear.
Meanwhile, the Saudi government
prohibits Jews, by law. from setting
foot in Saudi Arabia.
CJME's actions are not only
based on a spiteful myth, they are
also dangerous. Racism is the 21st
century's scarlet letter: Once brand
ed racist, you're an outcast. Those
who attempt to label Israel an
"apartheid state" are in effect cam
paigning against co-existence and
peace. Does one co-exist with
apartheid? No. Does one make
peace with apartheid? Of course not,
because to do so would be morally
wrong. By establishing the new
group. C'JME hopes that the repeti
tion of the rhetoric of demonization
("apartheid," "genocide," "racism")
will come to be accepted as truth,
creating an atmosphere of intimida
tion for Jewish students and animos

ity toward Israel.
Ah. but what about free speech?
While even hate propaganda may be
protected speech, this does not mean
that it is acceptable to spread offen
sive lies on campus. Would we toler
ate a Stanford student organization
whose sole purpose is to trash any
other religious, ethnic or gender
based community? Our culture of
respect and diversity makes this nor
matively unacceptable.
Equally disturbing is the one
sided, selective nature of the attack.
If they truly cared about protecting
fundamental rights in the Middle
East, the anti-Israel groups would
protest gender discrimination
throughout the region, where "reli
gious" thugs murder girls who don't
wear veils, or where fathers and
brothers kill sisters and daughters
who fall in love with a non-Muslims
(so-called "honor killings"). I"hey'd
protest ethnic discrimination in
Sudan, where Arab Muslims have
been ethnically cleansing African
Muslims and Christians for decades,
driving them off their lands, captur

ing, enslaving or slaughtering them.
They may even criticize the whole
sale ethnic cleansing of nearly the
entire Christian and Jewish popula
tions of the Arab world by Arab gov
ernments.
Like many of the student activists
at the University, the Stanford stu
dents who make up CJME have
been blessed with tremendous op
portunities. energy and organiza
tional talents. They can choose
whether to invest those assets in
building or destroying, creating
good or doing harm. Demonizing Is
rael so irresponsibly is wrong and
dangerous. Far better to work to
gether towards achieving the goals
of the UN Arab Human Develop
ment Report — democracy, self-de
termination. gender freedom, pros
perity, security and peace for all in
the Middle East: Christians, Jews
and Muslims.
