Anousheh Ansari, who became the first fe
male space tourist in 2(H)4. reminded a packed
Kresge Auditorium on Friday that it is impor
tant to shoot for the moon — or. at the very
least, for low earth orbit.
Ansari. who moved to the United States
from Iran at age 16.detailed her recent private
ly-funded excursion into space onboard a
Russian Soyuz capsule and her stay for several
days onboard the International Space Station
before a predominantly Iranian-American au
dience.
"My journey started a long, long time ago in
a country far. far away from here." she said.

Iranian-American Anoushe Ansari, the sponsor
of the Ansari X prize and the first female space
tourist, spoke before a packed audience in
Kresge Auditorium on Friday.
As a child, Ansari said,her dream to travel to space had
been dismissed with laughter. Today, no one is laughing.
After making a fortune in information technology, Ansari
has worked hard to develop the fledgling commercial
space-flight industry. As the title sponsor of the Ansari X-
Prize, the $10 million prize that was responsible for send
ing a commercial spaceplane SpaceShipOne into subor
bital space in Oct. 2004, Ansari has been a leader in the
push for private space travel.
"If anybody tells you you're crazy, all it means is that
you have a good idea," she said, before quoting Albert
Einstein and insisting that, "Imagination is more impor
tant than knowledge."
While Ansari said that she was both Iranian and Amer
ican,she emphasized her Iranian heritage throughout the
presentation. At one point, she showed the audience a
photograph of the Persian Gulf taken from the Interna
tional Space Station.
"It was the most wonderful view I could find — see,
there's no trouble there," she said, as the audience ap
plauded.
While Ansari said that Iranian culture comprised an im
portant part of her identity, she recognized that the I Inited
States had provided her with invaluable opportunities, in
cluding a college education in electrical engineering.
Officers from the Persian Students' Association
(PSA), which helped sponsor the event, said they hoped
that bringing Ansari to Stanford would help students see

Iran in a new light.
"It is not nice to hear our country's name in the news
only on political issues, "said PSA president Narges Asadi,
a graduate student in electrical engineering."lt is nice to
have something else to acknowledge."
After Ansari's presentation, students were quick to
note that commercial space travel — which costs about
$20 million — is currently only possible for the extremely
affluent. Ansari agreed but insisted that the commercial
price for suborbital flights would decrease with private
competition over time.
"I think the price will be out of reach for many, but it
will come down," she told The Daily. "It's just a starting
point."
Ansari was also asked several questions about
women's human rights issues in Iran and the Middle East.
Although the private astronaut said that she viewed her
self as a motivational figure, she did not appear to take a
decisive stand on current political topics. Rather, Ansari
emphasized that she supported a new type of philanthro
py. which would allow her to work more directly on the is
sues that she cared about.
Ansari's presentation was well-received by both Iran
ian-Americans and general students alike.
"She is a beacon," said Edgar Torres, a graduate stu
dent in aeronautics. "She represents a role model who left
Iran during the Revolution. She is living proof of the
American dream."
