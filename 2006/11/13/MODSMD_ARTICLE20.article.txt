## VBall promotes breast cancer research Dig for the Cure inspired by UCLA assistant coach 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The women's volleyball team hosted
the first-ever Dig for the Cure match Sat
urday night, with the squad encouraging
the crowd to make a donation for breast
cancer research for each dig that a player

made during the game.
According to associate head coach
Denise Corlett, women's volleyball teams
nationwide held similar Dig for the Cure
matches during October, but Cal and Stan
ford opted to wait until this past weekend
when both schools played UCLA to show
support for UCLA assistant coach Kim
Jagd, who is currently undergoing breast
cancer treatments. The drive collected
over $4,000 in flat donations Saturday for
the San Francisco chapter of the Susan G.
Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, in ad

dition to other pledged amounts.
"It was great to help out a colleague
and support her fight against the disease,"
Corlett said. "I'm also a UCLA grad, so
the fact that we were dedicating the match
to someone from UCLA made it all the
more important for me. We are hoping to
do Dig for the Cure on a yearly basis and
bring in even more donations for breast
cancer research."
Sophomore outside hitter Cynthia Bar-
boza was one of several players
earning digs against the Bruins.
"We were very happy to be a part
of the event," said Barboza, who
logged 15 kills for the Cardinal.
"Kim is an amazing woman who has
shown incredible determination
battling cancer, and we were hon
ored to be able to support her and
the thousands of others going
through the same thing."
Dig for the Cure was started
three years ago by Charlotte head
coach Lisa Marston, whose mother
had breast cancer. Proceeds from
the matches are typically given to
the Komen Foundation, which has
raised more than $740 million to
help fight breast cancer thanks to
events like the Komen Race for the
Cure.

It's a fact that many fire deaths
are caused by people attempt
ing to cook or smoke while
under the influence of alcohol.
There's more to responsible
drinking than taking a cab.
Don't put yourself
