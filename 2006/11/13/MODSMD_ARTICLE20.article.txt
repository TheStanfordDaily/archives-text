## VBall promotes breast cancer research Dig for the Cure inspired by UCLA assistant coach 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The women's volleyball team hosted
the first-ever Dig for the Cure match Sat
urday night, with the squad encouraging
the crowd to make a donation for breast
cancer research for each dig that a player

made during the game.
According to associate head coach
Denise Corlett, women's volleyball teams
nationwide held similar Dig for the Cure
matches during October, but Cal and Stan
ford opted to wait until this past weekend
when both schools played UCLA to show
support for UCLA assistant coach Kim
Jagd, who is currently undergoing breast
cancer treatments. The drive collected
over $4,000 in flat donations Saturday for
the San Francisco chapter of the Susan G.
Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, in ad

dition to other pledged amounts.
"It was great to help out a colleague
and support her fight against the disease,"
Corlett said. "I'm also a UCLA grad, so
the fact that we were dedicating the match
to someone from UCLA made it all the
more important for me. We are hoping to
do Dig for the Cure on a yearly basis and
bring in even more donations for breast
cancer research."
