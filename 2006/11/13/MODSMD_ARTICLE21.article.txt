What do John Arrillaga and John
Etchemendy have in common? In addition to
sharing the same first name, they also boast
Basque heritage.
Iliis winter,2o students will have the oppor
tunity to enroll in Introduction to Basque Stud
ies. a seminar taking a multi-perspective ap
proach to understanding Basque history, cul
ture and society taught primarily by Prof. Glo
ria Totoricaguena, the director of the Center
for Basque Studies at the University of Neva
da-Reno.
The interactive course will include a Basque
dance class and a trip to Piperade Restaurant
in San Francisco to sample Basque cuisine.The
president of the Basque Country has also been
invited to give a lecture at Stanford as part of
the class.

Senior Casey Nevitt initiated the course last
spring by securing guest instructors and a fac
ulty sponsor with Basque heritage — Provost
John Etchemendy.
"I've always wished there were a course at
Stanford on the Basques, who have a fascinat
ing and remarkable history," said Etchemendy.
who plans to take the course and hopes other
interested faculty and staff will also attend.'in
troduction to Basque Studies will provide an
opportunity for those who are interested in
Basque history, language and culture to learn
more about them from experts in the field."
Nevitt stated that the purpose of the class is
to spread awareness of historical and contem
porary perspectives on Basque culture, politics,
economics and society. She encouraged every
one interested in the subject matter to attend
the class, whether or not they are taking it for
academic credit.
"My great-grandparents were immigrants
from the Spanish side of the Basque Country
and I have increasingly become interested in
my heritage over the years." Nevitt said. "The
more I learned about the Basques,
the more interested 1 became and
the more I wanted to teach others
about the rich and unique history
and influences the Basque people
have had on the world."
Nevitt also hopes to that the class
will clarify misconceptions of the
Basque people, who are often linked
with the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna
(ETA), a paramilitary organization
seeking to create an independent so
cialist state for the Basque people.
"It is not uncommon to associate
all Basques with ETA, even though
ETA represents a small minority of
Basques," Nevitt said. "People typi

cally aren't aware that the Basques
played an important role in the Age
of Exploration and the rise of capi
talism — for instance, Basques built
Columbus' ships."
The class will also treat with lin
guistic and culinary facets of Basque
culture, Nevitt reported.
"One of the most interesting as
pects of the Basques is Euskera,
their language that unites them as a
people," she continued. "And
Basque cuisine has inspired a lot of
the cuisine that Spain is so well
known for."
Introduction to Basque Studies
will be offered through the Spanish
and Portuguese Department as a
Student Initiated Course during
winter 2007 and may be offered in
future quarters.
Since Nevitt first floated the idea
for the course, the department of

Spanish and Portuguese has wit
nessed a change in leadership. Joan
Ramon Resina, the new department
head, "is hoping to develop an Iber
ian Studies program at Stanford,
spanning all the peoples of the Iber
ian Peninsula," Etchemendy said.
"So it may turn out that the course
will continue under the sponsorship
of the Spanish and Portuguese de
partment, and contribute to this pro
gram."
Nevitt noted that a permanent
course would connect Stanford to a
network of Basque Studies Pro
grams that have been increasing na
tionally over the past few decades.
"I hope this class will turn into a per
manent course at Stanford because
it will bring awareness to an ethnic
group and culture that has impacted
world history and continues to play
a part in world politics," she said.
