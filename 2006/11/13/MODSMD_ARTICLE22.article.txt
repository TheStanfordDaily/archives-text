# ADMINISTRATION
## Graduate vice provost chosen 
### LIA HARDIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two is better than one, and that adage appar
ently goes for graduate administrators too.
Education Prof. Patricia Gumport is the first
Vice Provost for Graduate Education (VPGI ha
post that was created when the University split
the existing office of the Vice Provost and Dean of
Research and Graduate Policy into two new roles:
VPGI ! and Vice Provost and Dean of Research
(VPDoR).
Pediatrics and Microbiology and Immunology
Prof. Ann Arvin is the new VPDoR. Gumport and
Arvin replace former Vice Provost and Dean of
Research and Graduate Policy Arthur Bienen
stock, who will act as interim VPGE until
Gumport returns from her current leave of ab
sence.
The reorganization stems from a 2005 Stan
ford Commission on Graduate Education report.
The commission argued that Stanford should con
tinue to support decentralization in the adminis

tration of graduate education and that ihe new
positions are needed to combat "problems and in
efficiencies" which have arisen in graduate servic
es since the University disbanded the Graduate
Division 10 years ago.
In an email to the Daily, Gumport noted that
graduate education in the United States has his
torically been decentralized in an effort to allow
knowledgeable faculty to oversee graduate pro
grams. Yet this approach also introduces organiza
tional problems.
"There are problems and opportunities that
transcend particular programs, and this is where
the senior leadership of a university can help,"she
said.
Bienenstock dismissed the charge that organi
zational inefficiencies were an important factor in
the position split. He said that combating such is
sues was "a relatively minor part of the job."
Bienenstock added that the University's goals
in forming the new office were "to broaden the
graduate learning experience for
some of our graduate students, [to] in
crease the diversity of [the] graduate
student body and to improve [the stu
dents') quality of life."
Gumport said she anticipates
working closely with Stanford's other
vice provosts, because their roles as
University officials are "inherently in
terdependent."
Gumport. who is also director of
the Stanford Institute for I ligher Ed
ucation Research, was selected for hei
new position in August 2(X)6 by a com
mittee chaired by Applied Physics
Prof. Malcolm Beasley.
According to Bienenstock,
Gumport brings to the job strong sup
port for VPGE office goals, extensive
knowledge of finance in higher educa
tion, experience in educating gradu
ate students and "a genuine concern
for their welfare."
School of Education Dean Debo
rah Stipek holds parallel praise for
Gumport.
"Prof. Gumport is one of the most
respected researchers in the country
in the field of higher education," she
said in an email to The Daily."She will
bring a wealth of knowledge to her
new position."
Arvin emphasized that the split
will enable the University to focus on
graduate education beyond policy de
velopment. One reason for the split
was that the original position's re
sponsibilities have increased drasti
cally in recent years, and a single ad
ministrator would find it difficult to
oversee both Graduate Education
and Research in the future.
"One person really couldn't do
both in any sensible way." she said.
