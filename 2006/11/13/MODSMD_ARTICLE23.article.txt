# ANNOUNCEMENT
## Daily debuts cell phone updates Through Mozeo, readers can receive Daily headlines 
### EMMA TROTTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Powered by a privately-owned
company called Mozeo, minute-by
minute updates from The Daily are
now available by cell phone. The
content consists of headlines cover
ing all sections of the newspaper.
"We realize that many of our
readers are very busy individuals,"
said senior Jeremy Chou, an adver
tising manager in The Daily's Busi
ness Department. "We also know
that many of them text message.
Sometimes, you don't have the time
to pick up the paper and read
through it to get the information you
want."
Mozeo offers two services to
users. One is TxTCasting, which ITie
Daily uses to send headlines to sub
scribers. The service is available to all
users via the company's website.
The second service is Go Groups,
which are similar to the email list
groups widely used by dorms and
clubs at Stanford to communicate
with members, only using cell phones
instead of computers.
Both these services are free for
students. All Mozeo users can create

a free account and receive any
TxTCast they want, including those
from Mozeo itself about stocks,
news, business and weather.
"There is no charge by Mozeo to
get these TxTCasts on their phone,
and there is also no charge to join the
Mozeo community." said Nicholas
Fruscello, Mozeo's public relations
director. "Depending on their cur
rent cell phone plans, their carrier
may charge for receiving or sending a
text message, but Mozeo will never
charge."
What remains to be seen is
whether students will take advan
tage of the service. Elise Menke, a
senior who described herself as a fre
quent reader of Ilie Daily, said she
has mixed feelings about TxTCast.
"It's cool, but I wouldn't do it,"
she said. "I don't do news alerts on
my phone for anything: I'm not that
technologically advanced."
Junior Chris Elmore, on the other
hand, said he probably will opt to use
the service.
" There are things I'd like to read,
and most of my reading time is on my
Blackßerry while walking to class,"
he stated.
The Daily has introduced several
new features this year, ranging from
the Mozeo service to an overhauled
Web site.
"We try to remain open to any
and all new ideas." Chou said,"espe
cially when it makes life a little easi
er for students."
