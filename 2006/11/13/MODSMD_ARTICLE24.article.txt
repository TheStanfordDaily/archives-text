## 92-72 win kicks off season Freshman Robin Lopez shines in first regular season Stanford game 
### ALEX GYR MANAGINGEDITOR 
The already high expectations hanging over center
Robin Lopez took a leap to astronomical proportions
after his performance Saturday afternoon. In his first of
ficial game in a Stanford uniform, the 7-foot freshman
dominated Siena's undersized frontcourt. scoring 14
points while adding 15 rebounds in a ( )2-72 win.
"Robin played really well." Stanford coach Trent
Johnson said. "It's hard to say otherwise with 14 points
and 15 rebounds. He handled the double-teams they
were putting on him very well.especially for a freshman.
I'll take a performance like this every time out."
Senior I-red Washington was equally optimistic, es
pecially about Lopez's effort on the defensive end,
where he collected six blocked shots.
"Six blocks in the first game is amazing," said Wash
ington, motioning to a whiteboard in the pressroom that
indicated Lopez tied Curtis Borchardt. Matt Haryasz
and Lawrence I lill's school record for blocks in a game.
"That record is going down."

points scored by freshman
Robin Lopez

But Lopez wasn't the only Cardinal player to have a
breakout performance. Sophomore Anthony Goods
dumped in 30 points on 11-of-16 shooting, including 7-
for-11 from three-point territory.The performance oblit
erated his previous career high for points in a game. Be
fore Saturday, his best single game output was 12 against
UCLA on March 4,2006.
"After the first few shots went down I kind of knew 1
was feeling good." Goods said. "1 just kept shooting it. It
seemed like every time 1 had an open look it was going
down."
I"he Cardinal (1-0) used a fifty-point second half to
break the 90-point mark in regulation for the first time
since a 100-59 win over Harvard during the 2003-2004
season. After leading by seven at halftime, Stanford
pulled away by shooting 61.3 percent in the second peri
od.
"It is amazing how good you can look when the ball is
going down." Johnson said. "We kept our composure
against a good basketball team. We knew that Siena was
a good team and could cause problems, which they did in
the first half."
Siena hung tough with the Cardinal through the first
period of play. Although Stanford was able to build a 10-
point lead with 7:30 to go in the first half, the Saints bat
tled back to cut the Cardinal lead to 34-33 just five min
utes later.
Baskets by Washington and Goods in the closing min
utes of the period extended the Cardinal lead to seven at
the break.Two minutes into the second half, Stanford re
gained the 10-point margin and enjoyed a double-digit
advantage the rest of the game.
The Cardinal also got double-digit seining efforts
from Washington and sophomore forward Lawrence
