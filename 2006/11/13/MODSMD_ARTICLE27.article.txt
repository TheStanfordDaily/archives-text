# Hearing the worst of them
## 
### 
And you thought Stanford fans
had given up on their team.
Maybe it's because football
just means more to the fans in Wash
ington. Maybe, as backers of the Pac
l()'s premier program throughout the
years, they're used to more success.
Whatever the reason, the level of de
spondency coming out of Seattle ri
valed anything from the gloomiest of
Stanford faithful over the past two sea
sons. This from a team that was 4-1 two
short months ago.
Wrapping up 11 (yes, 11) straight
hours of Washington football coverage
on the local radio station, two washed
up ex-jocks — you know the type;
everybody's hometown sports station
has the exact same guys — bitched and
moaned over the air.
Stanford was "the slowest team
they'd seen in 30 years of covering
football." Washington just suffered "its
worst loss ever." This was the "lowest
day in I lusky history." And Washing
ton went 1-10 two years ago. 1 guess
losing to winless Stanford can upset
even the best of us.
In the stands, the seagulls slowly
took the place of the boo birds. What
was a half-full stadium at kickoff was
perhaps one-tenth full at the final
whistle — not counting, of course, the
dozens of seagulls that migrated over
from Lake Washington, just yards be
hind the east end zone.TWenty minutes
after the final, hundreds of these birds
were all that remained.
With the soft sun, it's a picturesque
location for a football game in a beau
tiful city. Too bad the ugly, rusting stadi
um isn't holding up its half of the bar
gain. Washington needs its John Arril
laga-makeover in a hurry.
Back at Stanford. I've never heard
people so upbeat about the football
team. On the one hand, thank good
ness. Ihese players deserve something
positive for a year of hard work, and so
do the fans that have supported the
program through these dark days.
Long-term, Stanford football isn't
going to turn the corner without an ar
dently supportive fan base.
But at the same time, the Daily
hired me not to wave the pom-poms,
but to be a journalist and columnist
and to think and report objectively
about what I've seen. I have gained
worlds of respect for any of the 85-plus
players that have fought through this
season, so I'm sorry to be the grinch
that stole Christmas and write this, but
here goes: Stanford didn't so much win
that game as lose it. only to watch
Washington lose it twice. If there are
games out there where both teams de
served to win. this one was probably
the opposite.
Consider: when's the last time you
saw a team win with 20 rushing yards
on 35 carries? What's the last team that
won with seven first downs — just one
of them i)ii the ground —or eight
punts or four sacks allowed? Injuries
have hit the offense hard, but far more
was expected out of the veteran unit
this season. That Stanford is and
doesn't have the players to. compete
with the top half of the league, falls
largely on its shoulders.
Iliat leaves the defense. It played,
both statistically and to the naked eye,
its best game of the season. Give the
defense all the credit in the world for
continuing to believe when lesser men
would have quit. Give sophomore
safety Bo McNally credit for somehow
finding the end zone and jump-starting
the entire team in his first start in a
Stanford uniform.
Give senior linebacker Michael
Ok wo credit for having the guts to quit
the team on Wednesday, then having
the humility to rejoin it on Thursday
after an hour-long talk with head
coach Walt I larris and then having the
passion Saturday to play with his hair
on fire. Okwo's always had the physical
gifts, but in Seattle he put it all togeth
er for the first time all season. One
first-quarter play in particular, which
saw him sprint all the way across the
I lusky backfield to drop the Washing
ton quarterback, will earn him another
million or two come mid-April.
Still.consider the opposition. Wash
ington was down to its third-string
quarterback (starter Isaiah Stanback
was lost to injury a month ago and sec
ond-stringer ('arl Bonnell sat, bruised
and bloodied, for many of the game's
