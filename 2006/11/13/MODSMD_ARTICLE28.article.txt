## Women slip, regain lead atop Pac-10 UCLA moves into he for first before falling to Cardinal 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
With control of the conference
lead on the line this weekend, the No.
2 Stanford women's volleyball team
came away still able to dictate its own
destiny. That is particularly good
news after the Cardinal experienced
a mixed bag in their toughest home
stand this season.
The Cardinal (21-3. 12-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) dropped just their
second conference match of the sea
son to No. 6 Southern California on
I rida\ night, allowing No. 5 UCLA
to slip into a tie for first in the Pac-10
with their win over No. 12 California

on the same night. Stanford took sole
possession of first place the next
night with a four-game victory over
the Bruins, 17-30,30-25.30-26.30-27.
"USC played very well and sur
prised us with their level of play,"
head coach John Dunning said of the
18-30,24-30,31 -33 loss. "But we have
a lot of proud, competitive people on
this team that were strong enough to
come back out and beat UCLA.
We're definitely going to hold on to
the lessons of this weekend."
USC (23-3. 11-3) entered the
weekend looking for revenge after
the Cardinal swept the Women of
Troy in Los Angeles on Oct. 12. The
tone was set early, as the Trojans
went on an early four-point run in
game one to secure the lead.
Richards started close in with a solo
block to make it 13-15, but USC re
sponded with an eight-point run that
sucked the energy out of Stanford.
The Trojans eventually took the

game on a Jessica Gysin ace.
The Cardinal kept it closer in
game two, hut USC's Asia Kaczor's
12 kills provided too much offense
for Stanford to handle, and the Tro
jans escaped with the win.
Stanford's offense rose to the
challenge in game three, tying USC's
mark of 21 kills in the same frame.
Both teams exchanged points and
the lead throughout the game, and a
kill by sophomore outside hitter
Foluke Akinradewo forced game
point for Stanford at 30-28. But the
Women of Troy would not buckle
under pressure as they scraped to
gether five points to take the nail
biter on a Cardinal attack error.
"There were a lot of factors be
hind our loss," sophomore outside
hitter Rrin Waller said. "We were
looking forward to UCLA more
than USC, but USC played great and
made us pay for it. We just weren't
communicating or playing our

game.
Stanford could see silver lining in
game three in that Richards became
the all-time digs leader in school his
tory with 1,457.
Kaczor led the match with 26 kills.
Akinradewo led Stanford with 15
kills but injured her shoulder in the
match.
Hie Cardinal looked to rebound
from their loss the next night against
the Bruins (25-3, 12-3) without the
help of Akinradewo. UCLA came
out strong in game one to claim the
early 5-1 advantage. The Bruins
would hang on to that momentum,
limiting the Cardinal to .158 hitting
en route to a 30-17 trouncing of Stan
lord.
It appeared the Cardinal would
make easy work of UCLA in game
two with a late 21-15 lead.The Bruins
exploded for a five-point run to pull
within one, but that would be as close
as they would come. A UCLA attack

UCLA (1 ) 30 25 26 27 23-3,11-3 pac-IO

error sealed the game for the Cardi
nal. The Bruins' 13 errors proved
costly, limiting them to .000 hitting.
Things looked troubling for Stan
ford early in game three as the Bru
ins put together an 8-3 lead, hut a six
point run for the Cardinal put Stan
ford ahead for good. The teams ex
changed rallies, but the Cardinal
were able to cash in on their early
runs to take the game on a successful
block of a UCLA attack.
It would look grim again for the
Cardinal when the Bruins posted a
16-10 lead in game four. Stanford
pulled it together one more time and

went on a 7-1 run to make it close at
16-17. The squads kept it tight in the
home-stretch with a tie at 27-all, but
a kill by sophomore outside hitter
Cynthia Barboza capped three con
secutive Stanford points to grant the
Cardinal the game. With the game
win came the match victory and sole
possession of first place in the na
tion's most competitive conference.
Barboza once again led Stanford
with 15 kills. She was followed by
Waller with 13 and Richards with 12.
