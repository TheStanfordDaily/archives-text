## Squad earns split in weekend games Men bounce buck after upset loss to UCI with win over Santa Clara 
### ANDREW SHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the end. UC-Irvine's Colin
Mello was the difference. The No. 4
Stanford men's water polo team
could not contain the junior driver,
as he scored four times in Satur
day's 9-8 upset loss to No. 11 Irvine.
Mello. who has 7b goals on the
season for the Anteaters (9-15, 1-
4 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) notched the game-winning
goal with 1:57 left. The Cardinal
(15-7. 4-3) have done a fine job in

the past containing teams with es
sentially one primary scorer but
could not find a way to stop
Mello.
"Saturday we just came out flat,
and never got out of it." said sopho
more two-meter Ryan McCarthy.
"A lot of us just didn't have good
games."
Stanford's offense was led by
senior captain Tyler Drake, who
scored four times. Fellow senior
captain JJ Garton, junior two-meter
defender Ryan Fortune and Mc-
Carthy all added goals as well.
Nevertheless, the loss has reper
cussions for the Cardinal's seeding
in the MSPF Tournament two
weeks from now. The team has
taken a step back to look at the larg
er picture and will not let the loss
ruin its focus.
"It was definitely a hard loss to

swallow on Saturday because it es
sentially takes us out of a potential
third place seeding in the MPSF
tournament," Garton said. "How
ever. what is really important is that
it does not change what we have to
accomplish at MPSFs. We have
known that we will have to win all
three games at MPSF to advance to
NCAAs. This is unchanged by the
loss on Saturday."
The Cardinal bounced back
nicely on Sunday, crushing No. 17
Santa Clara with a score of 13-5. It
was Stanford's game to win from
the start, and the Cardinal were up
8-1 by halftime.
"Today we came out and did
what we were supposed to do." Mc-
Carthy said. "Santa Clara [13-14] is
a good team and they play their op
ponents tough so we had to get on
them early and that's what we did.

[Stanford freshman driver] Sage
Wright had a great game today and
really opened things up for us."
Freshman utility Drac Wigo,
Wright and McCarthy all scored
three goals. Garton and sophomore
driver Chris Jacobson chipped in
with two goals as well.
"The Santa Clara game was a
good win for us after having a flat
game against UCI," Garton
said."We came out strong and
played well against them. We need
to take the momentum of this win
through the week and have a great
game this Saturday against UOP."
After Saturday's match against
Pacific, the Cardinal will move on to
the MSPF Tournament.
As the regular season winds
down, the postseason and its pres
sure lingers.

still have to win MPSF — though
our road will be a bit more difficult
— but we are keeping our focus on
our main season goal: making it to
the NCAA tournament," Garton
said. "What is important now is that
we learn from this weekend and
move forward so that we can peak
at the appropriate time. The rest of
the regular season is all about build
ing confidence and momentum into
the MPSF tournament so that we
