## Marathon reopens registration 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
841 down. 159 more to go.
At 5 p.m. on Wednesday, Stanford Dance
Marathon (DM) will reopen its registration
Web site to attract 159 more dancers in a drive
to reach its goal of I.(MX) participants for this
year's 24 hour dance.
Already shattering its total of 319 dancers
from 2(K)(i, the DM team said it had hoped to
have 650 dancers this year — a figure that par
ticipants "totally blew out of the water." said
DM co-chair Tory Kauer, a junior.
Mindful of a large number of stu
dents who either missed the deadline
or later heard about DM from their
friends, Kauer and fellow co-chair
Nicholas Cheng, a senior, said that
they expect all of the available spots
to fill up within hours of the reopen
ing of registration.
"Given the number of emails
we've received from people who
missed the deadline or heard about it
from friends," they wrote in an email
to The Daily, "we suspect registration
will close again in a matter of hours."
The co-chairs recommend that
dancers sign up immediately at 5 p.m.
to secure their spots. Dancers may
join preexisting teams, or create
teams of their own.

'Ihis year, DM plans to donate all
the money it raises to the Partners in
Health Clinic in Rwanda. Dancers
are required to raise a minimum of
$140 each, which according to the
DM team, will provide antiretroviral
treatment for one person with
HIV/AIDS for an entire year.
Kauer and Cheng attributed the
overwhelming response to DM to the
selection of "Mountains Beyond
Mountains" as one of the required
readings for incoming freshmen. Hie
hook documents Dr. Paul Farmer's
efforts to provide healthcare to some
of the world's poorest communities.
Farmer is slated to speak on cam
pus this Wednesday at an event host
ed by the student service group
FACE-AIDS, which has worked
closely with DM this past year. With
Farmer's scheduled speech. Stanford
will have hosted the three biggest
names in the fight against infectious
diseases — a list that includes
"Mountains Beyond Mountains" au

thor Tracy Kidder and Dr. Jim Kim.
the former head of the World Health
Organization's HIV/AIDS depart
ment.
"First we had Tracy Kidder come
to speak at the Three Book Event,
and then Jim Kim came as the
keynote speaker for the Face Aids
summit," Cheng wrote. "Now we are
fortunate enough to have Paul
Farmer coming to address what is
sure to be a sold-out crowd!"
Kauer and Cheng expressed confi
dence that the dramatic increase in
the number of students will not de
tract from the students' experiences
at the dance.
"We are really, really excited
about the increase in the size and
scope of the event, they said. "For
every dancer, the experience ot see
ing so many students coming togeth
er to have a positive impact on some
thing larger than themselves is what
makes Dance Marathon an amazing
experience."
