SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Bill Walsh, the Hall of
Fame coach who built an Ni l. dynasty with the San
Francisco 49ers and revolutionized the sport with his
West Coast offense, disclosed Friday that he has
leukemia.
Stanford officials confirmed that Walsh, who
served as the school's interim athletic director until
July, has told friends and colleagues there that he has
cancer.
"I'm positive, but not evangelistic," the 74-year
old Walsh told The (Santa Rosa) Press Democrat and
The Sports Xchange Web sites. "I'm pragmatically
doing everything my physicians recommend, and I'm
working my way through it."
Walsh said the cancer first was diagnosed in 2(H)4.
but he feels better since a series of blood transfusions
in the past month.
" Hie worst phase was three or four weeks ago. I ve
come back dramatically since, and I'm better," he
said.
Walsh lost his eldest child. Steve, to leukemia at
age 46 in May 2002. Steve Walsh was an ABC News
reporter who covered the fall of the Berlin Wall, the
Columbine High School massacre and other major
stories.
Walsh said he was going public now. because word
had begun to circulate.
Calls to Walsh's home went unreturned Friday.
Former Heisman Trophy winner and star NFL
quarterback Jim Plunkett, recruited to Stanford by
Walsh, said Friday night that he had known about
Walsh's condition for some time. Plunkett, who won
two Super Bowl titles with the Raiders, called the
news "sad," because he has such a long and special re
lationship with Walsh.
"He's not a complainer, that's for sure, even
though he wasn't feeling well." said Plunkett. while
attending a Stanford women's volleyball game. "We
all feel for him. and we're all praying for him and cer
tainly hope things will work out."
Walsh was 47 when he first became an NFI. head

coach,and he spent just 10 seasons
on the sideline. But he left an in
delible mark, winning three Super
Bowls and turning the 49ers into
the most successful team of the
1980s with his innovative offensive
strategies and teaching techniques.
"We have stayed in touch with
Bill Walsh over the years and we
hold him in very high regard,"
49ers owners John York and
Denise Dehartolo York said in a
statement Friday night. "He is one

of the greatest football minds of all
time and we wish him the best."
Few men did more to shape the
look of football into the 21st centu
ry. His cerebral nature and often
brilliant stratagems earned him
the nickname "The Genius" well
before his election to the Pro Foot
ball Hall of Fame in 1993.
"He's done a lot of things in his
lifetime â€” all very positive, both
in the NFL and at Stanford," Plun
kett said. "Everybody knows the
name Bill Walsh. He's beaten a lot
of things and hopefully he can beat
this."
Walsh went 102-63-1 with the
49ers, winning 10 of his 14 postsea
son games along with six division

titles. He was named the NFL's
coach of the year in 1981 and 1984.
Walsh twice served as the 49ers'
general manager, and George
Seifert led San Francisco to two
more Super Bowl titles after Walsh
departed. Walsh also coached
Stanford during two terms over
five seasons, and was the school's
interim athletic director until Bob
Bowlsby was hired in April.
"1 always felt I'll accept my fate
as it unfolds," Walsh said. "1 have
no regrets, and when it was life
threatening, I had a lot of consider
ations about my wife, Geri. It ap
pears I've gone through that
threshold and it may turn out OK,
at least for a while."
