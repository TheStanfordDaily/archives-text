SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Bill Walsh, the Hall of
Fame coach who built an Ni l. dynasty with the San
Francisco 49ers and revolutionized the sport with his
West Coast offense, disclosed Friday that he has
leukemia.
Stanford officials confirmed that Walsh, who
served as the school's interim athletic director until
July, has told friends and colleagues there that he has
cancer.
"I'm positive, but not evangelistic," the 74-year
old Walsh told The (Santa Rosa) Press Democrat and
The Sports Xchange Web sites. "I'm pragmatically
doing everything my physicians recommend, and I'm
working my way through it."
Walsh said the cancer first was diagnosed in 2(H)4.
but he feels better since a series of blood transfusions
in the past month.
" Hie worst phase was three or four weeks ago. I ve
come back dramatically since, and I'm better," he
said.
Walsh lost his eldest child. Steve, to leukemia at
age 46 in May 2002. Steve Walsh was an ABC News
reporter who covered the fall of the Berlin Wall, the
Columbine High School massacre and other major
stories.
Walsh said he was going public now. because word
had begun to circulate.
Calls to Walsh's home went unreturned Friday.
Former Heisman Trophy winner and star NFL
quarterback Jim Plunkett, recruited to Stanford by
Walsh, said Friday night that he had known about
Walsh's condition for some time. Plunkett, who won
two Super Bowl titles with the Raiders, called the
news "sad," because he has such a long and special re
lationship with Walsh.
"He's not a complainer, that's for sure, even
though he wasn't feeling well." said Plunkett. while
attending a Stanford women's volleyball game. "We
all feel for him. and we're all praying for him and cer
tainly hope things will work out."
Walsh was 47 when he first became an NFI. head
