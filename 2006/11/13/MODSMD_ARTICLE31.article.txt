## Overzealous ordinance bullies 
### EUGENE GU 
There is small but growing sentiment that the Stan
ford University Police Department has simply lost sight
of its calling. According to its Mission Statement, the de
partment "exists to provide a safe, secure atmosphere,
which is conducive to freedom of expression and move
ment" That sounds pretty good and might even make
people feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Yet how many
times have Stanford cops given citations to bicyclists who
rode with a broken headlight, did not register their "ve
hicle," listened to an Ipod or otherwise had the audacity
to commit an offense that cops in the real world would
not even bother to pursue?
While I completely support policies that enhance
public safety, it is easy to argue that Stanford cops
overzealously crack down on small-time violators, yet
fail to address far more flagrant safety issues. Where are
the campus police when a student gets robbed at gun
point in thc Toyon parking lot? Where are the cops when
the Marguerite corrals down the street, honking at all the
bicyclists to either get out of the way or get flattened into
a Cardinal pancake?
I know it is unreasonable to expect the police to be
around every time somebody commits a truly dangerous
act. But the fact of the matter remains that there are plen
ty of wild drivers, violent criminals and thieves to keep
them busy. Is there really any need to become the cam
pus bicycle Nazis when there are far more important du
ties to attend? It is unfortunate that when a normal stu
dent bicyclist sees a campus police officer, his heart starts
to race and he wonders if he is doing anything wrong. We

have become fugitives on our own campus.
To make matters worse, a plethora of new regulations
have come into place this year. In addition to making it a
crime to bike on the Quad and other "restricted areas,"
these regulations hint at a decadent campus police force
that would rather prosecute the community it is meant to
serve than devote resources to protect us in our time of
need. That's not to say that bike safety is an insignificant
issue. However, with over 12,000 bikes on campus, the
number of reported injuries has been surprisingly small.
And almost all of the most serious injuries have involved
at-fault car drivers who were either speeding or failed to
lawfully stop at an intersection. Targeting the bike riders
rather than the reckless car drivers is akin to projecting
blame onto the victims of violent crime.
Yet I am confident that our campus police officers are
not petty people at heart.They have just lost sight of their
greater vision — to be our benevolent guardians rather
than overzealous ticket writers. Perhaps if we open up a
student dialogue and communicate our concerns to the
Stanford Department of Public Safety, they will wise up
to the problem and change their ways. Instead of break
ing out the citation pad for the slightest violation, they
should give us cautionary warnings and advice about
laws we might not have known about. They should also
re-focus their attention on the individuals who represent
the greatest threat to public security.The Stanford police
should be our friendly protectors rather than small-time
ordinance bullies.
