## Rumors spin about bike tickets Email warns of crackdown, police claim no change in policy 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Already faced with a ban on riding and park
ing hikes in the arcades of Main Quad, students
received news of another crackdown on Friday,
with an email reporting increased police ticket
ing for running stop signs and listening to iPods
while hiking.
Representatives from the Department of
Public Safety, however, assured ITie Daily that
police enforcement of hike rules on Friday was
no different than on any other day.
"There has been no increase [in enforcement]
that I know of" said Sgt. Al James on Sunday.
Yet on Friday. Zach ("handler, a staff member
at the Division of Literatures, Cultures and Lan
guages, wrote an email, subsequently forwarded
to dozens of dorm chatlists, warning students of
the "dragnet on campus."
"I stopped to ask one of the sheriffs what was
going on, and he told me that the fines are equiv
alent to the same offense while driving a car,"
Chandler wrote in the email.

cle riders have the same rights and responsibili
ties as motor vehicle drivers do and are therefore

subject to the same citations and
fines, which are often hundreds of
dollars.
"You may be cited for running
stop signs, riding at an unsafe speed
for conditions, riding on the wrong
side of the road or upon sidewalks,
wearing headphones while riding and
not having legal brakes," the Depart
ment of Public Safety Web site reads.
Freshman Laura Brignone was
stopped by a police officer at the in
tersection of Santa Teresa St.and
Lomita Dr. but did not receive a tick
et. which she attributed that to the

fact that "the police officer was nice
and I'm a freshman."
The officer told Brignone that the
increased enforcement was due to
several bike accidents earlier in the
week, in which students were taken to
the hospital.
Sgt. James said that he had not
heard of an increase in bicycle acci
dents in the past week. "But," he said,
"we have accidents all the time."
Brignone said the officer gave her
a list of the most common laws bro
ken by bicyclists and a warning not to
run any more stop signs.
According to Sgt. David Lee. bicy
cle regulations are enforced all year.
"We make it a habit of doing en
forcement each week in different lo
cations and at different times," he
said.

James echoed those comments.
"There's nothing new about bicy
cle violation enforcement," he said.
"We've been enforcing these laws for
many years."
He acknowledged that there is
often an increase in enforcement if
officers are noticing a lot of violations
or when new students arrive.
Students, however, said that they
have not witnessed the strict enforce
ment of these regulations.
"1 bike through stop signs all the
time, and I've never gotten stopped,"
said sophomore Anish Mitra.
James warned that violations
could be enforced at any time.
"It just depends if there are offi
cers out there who have time to do it."
he said, "because we're a very busy
department."
