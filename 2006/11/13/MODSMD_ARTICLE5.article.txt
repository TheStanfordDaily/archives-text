SEATTLE — "We won the game! It feels so good! We won the
game! It feels so good! We won the game! It feels so good!"
Forgive Stanford football for having a simple victory chant.
After all. they hadn't used it in a year.

Eleven games, 364 days.The Cardinal's losing streak was the
second-longest in the country and as long as any in S5 years of
Stanford football history. The Cardinal had also struggled with
traditional Pac-10 power Washington (4-7. 2-6 Pac-10), going
just 3-20 since their hist win in Seattle in 1976. But all that histo
ry was mercifully put to rest Saturday as the Cardinal (1-9.1-6)
shocked Washington, 20-3.
"We have had so much had luck, the ball bouncing the other
way,and today it bounced our way in more situations then it had
the entire season." head coach Walt 11 arris said. "With the help
of our seniors, we fought through a lot of adversity and we

played well today."
Iwo quick-strike touchdowns for the Cardinal proved the differ
ence. First, sophomore safety Bo McNally s 49-yard interception re
turn for a touchdown gave Stanford its first lead since Sept. 9.
Diat s the first touchdown in a long time, so that was great," Har
ris said. "We were all whooping it up on the sidelines. Doesn't matter
if it was the defense scoring, offense scoring, special teams scoring —
we were scoring and that's what was great."
Washington quarterback Carl Bonnell (10-of-35,118 yards, one in
terception) sat out the third quarter with a bruised thigh and bloodied
nose, and third-stringer Johnny Dußocher (1 -of-9, four yards, two in
terceptions) struggled mightily in the fill-in role. What was possibly
Dußocher's worst pass came on a crossing route intended for his tight
end Michael Gottlieb early in the period.The throw, meant to be a 15-
yard bullet, was instead a 25-yard floater that fell right into McNally's
hands. As soon as McNally caught it. lie was thinking end zone.
"I was going to go down the sideline but 1 saw a tight end coming,
so I took a couple of steps in toward the field," McNally said."He went
in, so 1 took it down the sideline. 1 got a couple of big blocks, big hits
from my guys and just got it in there. 1 think right there, people start
ed to believe and just started to get it done."
McNally, a backup, only learned he was starting Thursday after in
juries forced senior salcty Brandon 1 larrison to cornerback. But with
another pick of a Dußocher wounded duck right after halftime, Mc-
Nally let his play do the talking.
"i was nervous and excited at the same time, and I was really look
ing forward to trying to make my mark for the team," said McNally of
his first career start. "It feels amazing. I am really glad that 1 could do
something to help out the team get our first victory of the year."
In the fourth quarter, a Stanford quarterback threw for a touch
down for the first time since a loss to Washington State on Sept. 23.
Freshman Richard Sherman (six catches, 177 yards) had reeled in two
bombs that set up a 29-yard field goal by junior kicker Aaron Zagory
that closed the first half at 3-apiece. I larris and junior quarterback TC
Ostrander (1 l-of-20, 206 yards, one touchdown) saw a weakness in
Washington's coverage of Sherman, one of the fastest men on the
team.
"The way they were covering him, we felt we could take advantage
with some deep balls, and we almost hit one earlier than that," Ostran
der said."He made a great adjustment on the first ball, and he made
an even better adjustment on the second ball to really make two big
plays."
Ostrander fired Sherman a bubble screen in the early fourth. Se
nior receiver Marcus McCutcheon blocked the cornerback on Sher
man. and all the speedster out of Los Angeles had to do was make the
safety miss.
"I broke the safety's tackle and that was pretty much it." said Sher
man of the team's longest play of the season. "1 was thinking,'! have
to score. I have to score. Do not get caught.'"
Ostrander was just as elated after the 74-yard touchdown pass, his
first on the season.
"1 saw him running, and 1 thought,' First down,"'Ostrander said. "I
saw him keep running, and I thought.'Touchdown.' I was the most ex
cited guv ever.That's the easiest 80-yard touchdown Ill ever throw in
my life."
Zagory added an insurance 37-yarder with 4:24 to go for the final
margin.
Washington struck first, with a partially deflected Michael Braun
stein kick from the 18 that snuck over the crossbar for a 3-01 luskv lead
in the early second.
Neither team established much of an offense on the afternoon,
marching for under 400 total yards, 20 first downs and just 59 rushing
yards — combined. Take away Sherman's big day and Stanford
gained just 49 yards of total offense.
Stanford's players admitted it was far from their best perform
ance and far from the prettiest game they've seen. Still, after a year
king drought, they're more than happy to come back home with the
victory.
"I didn't think there was a whole lot of pressure for the winless sea
son before the game, but the way I feel now. it's awesome to have that
one on the board." Ostrander said. "It's a good feeling."

"I was going to go down the sideline but 1 saw a tight end coming,
so I took a couple of steps in toward the field," McNally said."He went
in, so 1 took it down the sideline. 1 got a couple of big blocks, big hits
from my guys and just got it in there. 1 think right there, people start
ed to believe and just started to get it done."
McNally, a backup, only learned he was starting Thursday after in
juries forced senior salcty Brandon 1 larrison to cornerback. But with
another pick of a Dußocher wounded duck right after halftime, Mc-
Nally let his play do the talking.
"i was nervous and excited at the same time, and I was really look
ing forward to trying to make my mark for the team," said McNally of
his first career start. "It feels amazing. I am really glad that 1 could do
something to help out the team get our first victory of the year."
In the fourth quarter, a Stanford quarterback threw for a touch
down for the first time since a loss to Washington State on Sept. 23.
Freshman Richard Sherman (six catches, 177 yards) had reeled in two
bombs that set up a 29-yard field goal by junior kicker Aaron Zagory
that closed the first half at 3-apiece. I larris and junior quarterback TC
Ostrander (1 l-of-20, 206 yards, one touchdown) saw a weakness in
Washington's coverage of Sherman, one of the fastest men on the
team.
"The way they were covering him, we felt we could take advantage
with some deep balls, and we almost hit one earlier than that," Ostran
der said."He made a great adjustment on the first ball, and he made
an even better adjustment on the second ball to really make two big
plays."
Ostrander fired Sherman a bubble screen in the early fourth. Se
nior receiver Marcus McCutcheon blocked the cornerback on Sher
man. and all the speedster out of Los Angeles had to do was make the
safety miss.
"I broke the safety's tackle and that was pretty much it." said Sher
man of the team's longest play of the season. "1 was thinking,'! have
to score. I have to score. Do not get caught.'"
Ostrander was just as elated after the 74-yard touchdown pass, his
first on the season.
"1 saw him running, and 1 thought,' First down,"'Ostrander said. "I
saw him keep running, and I thought.'Touchdown.' I was the most ex
cited guv ever.That's the easiest 80-yard touchdown Ill ever throw in
my life."
Zagory added an insurance 37-yarder with 4:24 to go for the final
margin.
Washington struck first, with a partially deflected Michael Braun
stein kick from the 18 that snuck over the crossbar for a 3-01 luskv lead
in the early second.
Neither team established much of an offense on the afternoon,
marching for under 400 total yards, 20 first downs and just 59 rushing
yards — combined. Take away Sherman's big day and Stanford
gained just 49 yards of total offense.
Stanford's players admitted it was far from their best perform
ance and far from the prettiest game they've seen. Still, after a year
king drought, they're more than happy to come back home with the
victory.
"I didn't think there was a whole lot of pressure for the winless sea
son before the game, but the way I feel now. it's awesome to have that
one on the board." Ostrander said. "It's a good feeling."

Junior quarterback TC Ostrander (pictured last weekend against USC) was 11 -for-20 with 206 yards and one touchdown
to freshman Richard Sherman in the Cardinal's first victory of the 2006 season.
SEATTLE — "We won the game! It feels so good! We won the
game! It feels so good! We won the game! It feels so good!"
Forgive Stanford football for having a simple victory chant.
After all. they hadn't used it in a year.

Eleven games, 364 days.The Cardinal's losing streak was the
second-longest in the country and as long as any in S5 years of
Stanford football history. The Cardinal had also struggled with
traditional Pac-10 power Washington (4-7. 2-6 Pac-10), going
just 3-20 since their hist win in Seattle in 1976. But all that histo
ry was mercifully put to rest Saturday as the Cardinal (1-9.1-6)
shocked Washington, 20-3.
"We have had so much had luck, the ball bouncing the other
way,and today it bounced our way in more situations then it had
the entire season." head coach Walt 11 arris said. "With the help
of our seniors, we fought through a lot of adversity and we

played well today."
Iwo quick-strike touchdowns for the Cardinal proved the differ
ence. First, sophomore safety Bo McNally s 49-yard interception re
turn for a touchdown gave Stanford its first lead since Sept. 9.
Diat s the first touchdown in a long time, so that was great," Har
ris said. "We were all whooping it up on the sidelines. Doesn't matter
if it was the defense scoring, offense scoring, special teams scoring —
we were scoring and that's what was great."
Washington quarterback Carl Bonnell (10-of-35,118 yards, one in
terception) sat out the third quarter with a bruised thigh and bloodied
nose, and third-stringer Johnny Dußocher (1 -of-9, four yards, two in
terceptions) struggled mightily in the fill-in role. What was possibly
Dußocher's worst pass came on a crossing route intended for his tight
end Michael Gottlieb early in the period.The throw, meant to be a 15-
yard bullet, was instead a 25-yard floater that fell right into McNally's
hands. As soon as McNally caught it. lie was thinking end zone.
"I was going to go down the sideline but 1 saw a tight end coming,
so I took a couple of steps in toward the field," McNally said."He went
in, so 1 took it down the sideline. 1 got a couple of big blocks, big hits
from my guys and just got it in there. 1 think right there, people start
ed to believe and just started to get it done."
