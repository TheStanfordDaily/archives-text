## Cafe says Ciao! to waste PWR project inspires Terman cafe to test biodegradables 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Want to start doing your part to reduce waste?
Starting this week. Ciao!. the cafe located in the
basement of the Terman Engineering Building,
will he offering customers the choice of biodegrad
able service ware — trays, forks, knives, spoons,
napkins and soup cups will all be available for an
additional 15 cents per meal.
If the program is successful, Ciao! owner
Giuseppe Carruba will consider offering
biodegradable utensils at his other cafes on cam
pus, including Cafe Riacci and the Law School
Cafe, and may consider phasing out plastic and
Styrofoam utensils completely.
"If one out of two or three people choose
biodegradable, I will consider it to be successful,"
Carruba said. "We're losing money off of it com
pared to Styrofoam — it costs more than 15 cents
— but we want to keep it affordable for people."
Sophomores Dayoung Lee and Dawn Kwan
provided the inspiration for the new project in
their freshman Program in Writing anil Rhetoric
class "The Politics of Food" last spring. As part of
their Community Writing Project component,
they decided to work with the non-profit organiza
tion World Centric, which is based in Palo Alto and
produces bio-compostable food service and packag
ing products.
"We did a bunch of research about different natu
ral materials, Lee said. "We also did a campus-wide
survey, mostly undergraduates but faculty and grad
uate students as well, and asked how much more peo
ple would pay for products that were made of natural

materials. We got a lot of positive responses."
Lee and Kwan contacted several cafes on campus and
Ciao! expressed interest.The pair has been working with
Ciao! since the end ot spring quarter, when they finished
their final report and cost-benefit analysis in preparation
to implement the program.

Hie new service ware will include materials from
bagasse products, made of sugar cane, and bio-plastics,
made trom potato and corn starch. One of the several benefits of
the new products is that the materials can be composted instead
of crowding landfills.
Composting the service ware provided at Ciao!, however,
might be a challenge, as Stanford does not yet have a wide-spread
composting system and the cafe does not have easy access to a
bin. Although the long-term details have yet to be finalized, the
biodegradable material will currently be collected in a separate
trashcan and transferred to theToyon composting bins.
Project organizers expressed the need for increased use of
biodegradable materials across campus.
"Our goal is to eventually establish a more widespread com
posting program that includes direct service to cafes and row
houses," said sophomore Emily Humphreys, who is helping with
the composting details. "These products require much less ener
gy to produce and are made from renewable resources, so they
are an environmental improvement even if land-filled.
The new biodegradable service ware option at Ciao! is one of
several new efforts to make eateries at Stanford more green. Sim

-ilar programs may soon hit the Business School's Arbuckle Cafe
and Moon Beans. Some cafes on campus offer a discount to cus
tomers who bring their own mug.
'*We plan to do a consumer survey after a month or two-trial
period," Lee said. "We aren't forcing everyone to buy this and we
will track the percentage of customers who do. If it works out fine,
we will write up a report and try to implement it in other cafes
too."
The service ware will be available later this week, as soon as
advertising for the project has been completed.
