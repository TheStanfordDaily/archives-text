# K-Fed up with 8.5.?
## 
### RAHUL KANAKIA INTERMISSION TABIE 
One of the great tragedies of the midterm elec
tions was the way it obscured news of Britney
Spears' and Kevin Federline's divorce. In normal
times, 1 don't know how exactly the information
would be onveyed to me. I don't watch celebrity
gossip shows or read tabloids. But somehow each
new plot twist causes the collective unconscious
would begin to swirl and churn. The story would
start to come together, perhaps from a casual con
versation with a friend, a video on You l Ã¼be or a
message on that email list I keep meaning to unsub
scribe from.
But through the media savvy of Britney Spears
(or her general obliviousness to the world), the
news broke on November 6th, when the media was
so enthralled by our so-called democracy that they
neglected to give us the news we really want. In
stead 1 had to actually go on the internet and search
out the speculations of the paparazzi.
First of all. there are the reasons for the divorce.
The court papers cited irreconcilable differences.
And I'd be surprised if one of those differences
wasn't the ridiculousness of Kevin Federline's sin
gle, "PoPoZao." This is a woman who has bought
the best talent in the pop-music industry, a team of
experts who have cranked out dozens of mindless
ly fun songs. Now either Britney Spears withheld
that know-how from her husband, or he wasn't cun
ning enough to make use of it. Either way. it be
smirched the entire music industry and it's ability to
tell us what we like. There are also reports
that Britney may have caught K-Fed with another
woman, but 1 still think it's probably "PoPoZao."
Unfortunately for K-Fed. the sixty page prenup
tial agreement he signed gave away his rights to the
massive fortune Spears has built on the backs of
adolescent girls. But according to a News of the
World column, he may have decided to go into busi
ness for himself by selling off a four hour sex tape
that may or may not feature Spears performing the
wildest sexual acts ever conjured by the fevered
dreams of man.
Clearty,Spears is worried that this will injure her
reputation as a woman of upstanding morals. Two
married people having sex? What has happened to
the world?
And there are some kids too. whom no one cares
about except for the people who spawned them,
and maybe not even them. But I'm sure they'll
make excellent points of struggle in this ongoing
saga.
Now. you may be wondering, "Who cares? The
Dems just won the House and Senate! Don't you
know that they're going to raise our taxes, take away
our guns, and cut and run from Iraq like the two
faced cowards they are?"
But elections come every two years. It's always
new people, new issues, new faces, new ballot boxes
being stuffed. There's no continuity. Britney and I.
we have a relationship. She's been part of the Amer
ican legend for years. She's stepped into new roles,
going from shocking nymphet to trailer-park mil
lionaire. but she's valuable because she tells a story
that serve as a stand-in for actual moral education.
And as the movies have shown, stories are always
better when there are (formerly) hot people in them.
And when cooler heads prevail, we'll all realize that
the one thing lacking from politics is hot people.
Which is why. despite their seeming importance.elec
tions just can't win my attention for any extended pe
riod of time.
