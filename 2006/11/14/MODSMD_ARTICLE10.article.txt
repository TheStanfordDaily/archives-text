## Editorial Board IHUM would benefit from structural reform 
### 
IHUM has come a long way since the days
when Stanford students decried an earli
er version of the core curriculum, chanti
ng "Hey hey, ho ho. Western Civ has got to
go!" The fact that IHUM has endured this
long demonstrates that the University con
tinues to be enthusiastic about the program
and its potential.
But many freshmen do not share the ad
ministration's enthusiasm.
Instead. IHUM is often greeted with deep
ambivalence.Though a significant number of
students enjoy their IHUM experiences,
many freshmen hate IHUM with a
vengeance and are quite vocal about their
hatred. Freshmen seek catharsis by com
plaining about their obscure reading assign
ments. their confusing paper prompts and
their pedantic teaching fellows. Meanwhile,
making fun of IHUM has become a proud
Stanford tradition — the overly eager
"IHUM kid" is frequently ridiculed at Gai
eties during Big Game week.
The frustration that freshmen feel is
made worse by the poor grades they often
get on their first IHUM papers. While it
should be expected, it doesn't help that many
students who work hard on their paper get
the first B of their lives. In fact, many stu
dents expect to get a B regardless of how
hard they try. Hard work and a good attitude
are necessary but insufficient conditions for
a good grade in IHUM. This bitterness per
sists well beyond freshman year — some up
perclassmen still bemoan the impact of their
IHUM grades on their GFA.
Stanford students would probably be less
obsessed about grades if they thought that
IHUM gave them some greater benefit. But
on the whole,the perception is that IHUM is
woefully irrelevant to most students.
In particular, teehies find that the 15 units
and $7,500 in tuition spent on IHUM could
be more productively used. Although some
students benefit tremendously from the ex
posure to the humanities that they might
otherwise not receive, other students find
IHIJM a waste of time and money.
Perhaps students should realize that they
would benefit a lot more if they engaged
more actively in class. They might enjoy
IHUM much more if they actually read the
assigned texts. Imagine how different IHUM
would be if the entire class actually did the
reading — thoughtfully and diligently.

But the University could also do more to
make IHUM a more rewarding experience.
We applaud the University for offering a
wide range of courses to cater to diverse in
terests. Some courses focus on the master
pieces of Western thought, while others ex
plore more eclectic offerings. Ibis hetero
geneity is one of the program's strengths.
But what the program desperately needs
is a clearer articulation of its mission. If the
program seeks to prepare students for citi
zenship. then each professor should clearly
communicate how a particular course will
meet those lofty goals If the program seeks
to improve writing and critical thinking
skills, then maybe a course in PWR is better
suited to meet these practical ends.
And while there may be heterogeneity in
course content, the program needs a more
coherent structure across all IHUMs. Lec
tures and sections ought to be more closely
coordinated, while texts need to be well-inte
grated with course themes. All IHUM cours
es need to be subject to the same standards
to ensure consistent workloads and fair grad
ing procedures — not just across all IHUM
courses, but across individual sections as
well. Also, course credit earned through
IHUM should be more consistently applied
to relevant humanities majors.
The larger challenge, though, is to encour
age students to participate more actively in
the IHUM process.The many focus groups
organized by the IHUM program is a good
start and we also encourage students to
make their views heard through the pro
gram's online survey.
We trust that many good ideas will be
proposed in these forums, and hope that
these will be seriously considered.The Board
suggests that the focus groups explore cre
ative solutions — greater flexibility in
switching courses and sections within the
shopping period, more creative use of sec
tion time, collaborative grading procedures,
self-designed paper prompts and alternative
final projects. Or perhaps the entire fresh
man class could benefit from a reorganiza
tion of the IHUM sequence. Instead of three
quarters of IHUM and two quarters of
PWR, we wonder if students would be better
served through two quarters of IHUM and
one quarter of PWR. Such focus could lead
to a more efficient allocation of educational
resources.
