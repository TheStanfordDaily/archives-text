# Oh, thou blessed roll of my undoing
## 
### 
It is the middle of November, which
means fall quarter is three-fourths fin
ished, which means I'm behind on every
thing and struggling with everything else. 1
had a 15 page paper due last week that I had
to write in 24 hours because I had spent the
weekend studying for a midterm for a class I
forgot 1 was taking, and then trying to hook
up with girls who run away from me because
I'm too busy to get a haircut, shave, buy
clothes that aren't hand-me-downs or sopho
more leftovers or devote the proper time to
getting to know girls outside of parties that
smell of scavenged beer and raw sweat and
feature obnoxiously loud hip-hop I can't
dance to because I haven't had any time in
my life to develop physical grace.
Every fall quarter begins with that
leisurely swoon of the new school year, as
you shop different classes until you find the
ones with the most delectable syllabi. Each
fall. I find myself enamored with every class
in the Bulletin. "I've never taken a single
course in history. French literature or electri
cal engineering." I fill my life with the maxi
mum number of units. 1 join multiple student
groups. I go the gym five or six times a week,
developing my nerd muscle until 1 can lift
half as much as that girl who plays rugby. I go
jogging. I call up everybody I know and make
plans for dinners and reunions. I wake up
each morning feeling refreshed, sometimes
even in time for breakfast. I go to lectures.
Time passes. Papers, problem sets and as
signed readings come and go,slowly. We have
all the time in the world.
And then time is running out: You bomb a
midterm, you turn in homework three days
late, you write a paper about "On the Road"
using Sparknotes and bullshit, you keep miss
ing practice or rehearsal or whatever meetings
your groups hold during study sessions for
math or makeout sessions with your girlfriend
who complains she barely sees you or the
boyfriend you never see or whatever is in your
life that keeps getting in the way of everything
else, until you're in week seven and you're jug
gling 12 roaring chainsaws in the air.
Life is hectic on the quarter system. Our
beloved administration has done everything in
its power to make our lives more stressful,
what with the crackdown on iPod bikers and
stricter alcohol policies and underage spies in

fraternity parties and "Absolute Fun "swallow
ing all our old traditions — crunching all the
fun out of them in its bureaucratic digestive
tract and then defecating out events like the
Band Run (aka.New 112 ootball Stadium Adver
tisement) and the upcoming Big Game Block
Party, which features cotton candy and snow
cones for the second grader in all of us
But you know what? None of that is impor
tant. All we really need is one thing: three-ply
toilet paper. ResEd may supply us with free
laundry.clean bathrooms and housing suspen
sions. but for too long has it ignored our most
sensitive needs.The two-ply paper has to go. In
all our arguments about big issues, like labor
reform and ending world hunger, it's easy to
lose sight of the little things in life.Think of how
much better we'd all feel, especially given the
preponderance of bikes on this campus, if
ResEd could make life just a little bit less
harsh, a little bit... softer? It wouldn't take too
much, and it's easier than getting Bill Clinton
as a commencement speaker. By giving us that
scratchy prole toilet paper, the University is ig
noring one of the biggest problems currently
facing our undergraduate community. It's a
problem every day. Sometimes, it's a problem
two or three times every day.
We are the best of the best of the best stu
dents in the country; we spend our days rac
ing across campus from one thing to the next;
in a couple more weeks, we won't even be
showering or changing out of our pajamas,
because we won't have bothered with sleep
for over4K hours. I don't care how many con
struction projects need to be postponed; I
don't care whose salary you need to trim.The
Pain has to stop here. Life is hard, but three
ply paper is soft, so soft.
