Sometimes ] wonder what my life would
be like if it lived up to the reputation
that I occasionally pretend my column
gives me. Now, that was quite a long sentence,
let me repeat it just case you didn't get it all
the first time: Sometimes I wonder what my
life would be like if it lived up to the reputa
tion that I occasionally pretend my column
gives me.
Using the same adjective twice in the
same paragraph is a big no-no (as, for that
matter, is using the word "no-no" even once)
in the world of (barely) post-kindergarten
writing that we indulge in here at The Daily.
So, doubling up on sentences, well, that's a se
rious crime.
1 'm going to get away with it. though.This
is because I followed my faux pas with an ex
ercise of an even more fundamental rule of
columnisting: self-referencing. Well, that's
not really a rule,so much as a tenet. (See what
I did there?)
Now, why am I babbling on about the writ
ing of a column, rather than actually writing
one? What purpose is served by this drawn
out explanation of process? Why is this para
graph filled with rhetorical questions?

The answer to all of these is the same:
word limits.
Each week, 1 have to produce 600-800
words for The Daily. Most weeks 1 just ex
plain why I hate you, yes, you, all of you.
Sometimes, for variety, I explain why 1 hate
myself.
Every now and again, however, 1 am filled
with love for my fellow man and have taken
enough of a mental beating from my parents
(exercise more, drive safely, eat vegetables,
don't smoke, stop with the cocaine, leave the
little girls alone — it never ends) to continue
with the self-flagellation.
At times like this, 1 write solely to gener
ate words.
Ah, words.

I like words.
Words are good.
And. that was eight more without even the
slightest effort. Give me a challenge, people.
Columns and their columnists formed a
significant part of my weekend — on Satur
day night. I was at the inaugural Stanford
Daily Columnist Fun Fest. Okay, so I made
up the Fun Fest hit, but you get the idea.
Our resident Finn (the incomparably de
lightful Sini) lured several of us to The Daily
office for free beer and a couple of hours of
drinking, gossiping and, most importantly,
comparing hate mail. (Hey, negroidlatte, if
you're reading this, the guys thought your
email was hilarious. You should definitely get
in touch again.)
One thing that didn't come up, rather sur
prisingly. now that 1 think about it, is the ob
vious question of why we bother.
As CV-building goes, it's probably not
that useful, especially when compared with
simply joining the newspaper staff. No, col
umn-writing isn't about the future, it's about
the present.
