Sometimes ] wonder what my life would
be like if it lived up to the reputation
that I occasionally pretend my column
gives me. Now, that was quite a long sentence,
let me repeat it just case you didn't get it all
the first time: Sometimes I wonder what my
life would be like if it lived up to the reputa
tion that I occasionally pretend my column
gives me.
Using the same adjective twice in the
same paragraph is a big no-no (as, for that
matter, is using the word "no-no" even once)
in the world of (barely) post-kindergarten
writing that we indulge in here at The Daily.
So, doubling up on sentences, well, that's a se
rious crime.
1 'm going to get away with it. though.This
is because I followed my faux pas with an ex
ercise of an even more fundamental rule of
columnisting: self-referencing. Well, that's
not really a rule,so much as a tenet. (See what
I did there?)
Now, why am I babbling on about the writ
ing of a column, rather than actually writing
one? What purpose is served by this drawn
out explanation of process? Why is this para
graph filled with rhetorical questions?

The answer to all of these is the same:
word limits.
Each week, 1 have to produce 600-800
words for The Daily. Most weeks 1 just ex
plain why I hate you, yes, you, all of you.
Sometimes, for variety, I explain why 1 hate
myself.
Every now and again, however, 1 am filled
with love for my fellow man and have taken
enough of a mental beating from my parents
(exercise more, drive safely, eat vegetables,
don't smoke, stop with the cocaine, leave the
little girls alone — it never ends) to continue
with the self-flagellation.
At times like this, 1 write solely to gener
ate words.
Ah, words.

I like words.
Words are good.
And. that was eight more without even the
slightest effort. Give me a challenge, people.
Columns and their columnists formed a
significant part of my weekend — on Satur
day night. I was at the inaugural Stanford
Daily Columnist Fun Fest. Okay, so I made
up the Fun Fest hit, but you get the idea.
Our resident Finn (the incomparably de
lightful Sini) lured several of us to The Daily
office for free beer and a couple of hours of
drinking, gossiping and, most importantly,
comparing hate mail. (Hey, negroidlatte, if
you're reading this, the guys thought your
email was hilarious. You should definitely get
in touch again.)
One thing that didn't come up, rather sur
prisingly. now that 1 think about it, is the ob
vious question of why we bother.
As CV-building goes, it's probably not
that useful, especially when compared with
simply joining the newspaper staff. No, col
umn-writing isn't about the future, it's about
the present.

At some level, I'm sure many of my col
leagues care about issues. That Franich kid
(lovely chap, bt w. great hair) seems to be truly
into saving Stanford from itself (or, more pre
cisely, its deans). And Durning is obviously
into "the world." However, I suspect that
even for the most earnest of the pack, issues
are not the only important thing.
(I, of course, don't care. In fact, I would
goes so far as to say that I hate issues and wish
they would stop stealing our jobs and go back
to where they came from. Dirty ingrates.)
No. 1 fear that what we're after, is what
everyone else is after — a little fame.
Not, obviously, much fame, since The
Stanford Daily has a circulation of 10,000
(plus about 50,000 unique hits online each
week — Vicky made me put this in) and a
readership of about nine. (Well, I assume it's
only nine, because otherwise I and my bril
liant work would be receiving much more
fan mail.)
Fame is relative (1 measure mine through
Google — four and half pages, baby, four and
a half), but ultimately the idea is to be known.
Known by people who have never met you.
And writing a column is about the cheapest
way to do that if you're lazy and/or a talent
less hack (the latter is not true of anyone on
The Daily roster apart from me — had to say
that so they don't fire me).
Other than Sudoku success nothing gives
me quite the same joy as receiving emails due
to slightly illiterate Web crawlers. 1 rejoice in
knowing that somewhere there exist a few
lines of code that love me.
It's not clear why this should be the case.
The warm feeling of success is not accompa
nied by anything tangible. There's no offer of
money. No one has ever tried to seduce me
(still a mystery). And the glimmer of recogni
tion will vanish as soon as I move on from the
Farm.
The only explanation 1 can find is that I,
like everyone else, value celebrity for its own
sake. Whilst 1 claim only to care about the tan
gible, about changing the world and all that,
really I'm lying. As fickle as it is, all I want is
one thing.
Fame. I'm gonna live forever. I'm gonna
learn how to fly.

It's my birthday tomorrow. Send me a suit
ably congratulatory email (navins@stan
ford.edu) and I'll put you in my next column
so you can have a little of the glory rub off on
you. Oh, and apologies for the lame pop cul
ture reference.
