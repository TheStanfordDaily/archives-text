SCAI aims for peace
I would like to respond to Amichai
Magen's op-ed yesterday as a member of
both the Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East (CJME) and Students Confronting
Apartheid in Israel (SCAI) ("What
apartheid is and is not"). I write to clarify our
intentions and some misinformation so that
Magen and others who might initially charac
terize SCAI as racist and demonic would un
derstand it as a groundbreaking student
group deeply committed to social justice, tol
erance, and peace.
First of all, CJME did not create SCAI;
SCAI is a separate student group which
seeks to address institutionalized discrimina
tion and apartheid in Israel and the occupied
territories through direct action and campus
wide engagement. CJME fulfills a different
purpose on campus; namely, raising aware
ness about current events and injustice in the
Middle East, primarily by bringing speakers
to campus. Past speakers have included
scholars on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,
but also, for instance, on the war in Iraq
(Robert Fisk and Tariq Ali).
Second, I understand that Magen is out
raged that SCAI (as he claims) is "dehuman
ize[ing) and delegitimiz[ing] an entire group of
people." However, his dismissal of our group is
misleading.The group — a coalition which in

cludes Jews, Arabs and Christians, among oth
ers — seeks to confront Israeli apartheid as it
is implemented by the Israeli government. Our
actions parallel those who protest against
American government policy, which obviously
does not conflate to protesting against all
American citizens. Magen suggests that we are
racist and that our actions amount to hate
speech. His claims are analogous to those
made post-9/11 against those who opposed the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, who were la
beled "unpatriotic." Clearly, our goal is not to
malign Jews or Israeli citizens; we are merely
protesting government policies.
Third, and most importantly, I disagree
with Magen's claim that "the analogy be
tween apartheid and Israel is absurd," a claim
echoed by Columbia University President
Lee Bollinger. I empathize with Magen. I too
would feel moral repugnance if someone
claimed that a state so dear to my heart, a
state where I was born, raised and have such a
strong love for and attachment to, was labeled
an "apartheid state." However, while Magen
and Bollinger find the comparison ludicrous,
interestingly South African Archbishop
Desmond I\itu, the Nobel Laureate who op
posed apartheid in his own state, finds the
comparison quite lucid. On a trip to Israel,
Ilitu remarked. "I've been very deeply dis
tressed in my visit to the Holy Land; it re
minded me so much of what happened to us

black people in South Africa. I have seen the
humiliation of the Palestinians at checkpoints
and roadblocks, suffering like us when young
white police officers prevented us from mov
ing about. My heart aches. I say, why are our
memories so short?" ("Apartheid in the Holy
Land," The Guardian, April 29,2002). Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's new book, "Palestine:
Peace not Apartheid" (coincidentally re
leased today),similarly argues that the system
of Israeli apartheid is a major impediment to
peace. He writes that "[lsrael's current policy
in the territories] is a system of apartheid with
two peoples occupying the same land but
completely separated from each other, with
Israelis totally dominant and suppressing vio
lence by depriving Palestinians of their basic
human rights." Rather than "denigrat[ingj the
suffering of Black South African victims," as
Magen claims of this comparison. Archbishop
TUtu. President Carter, SCAI and other
groups committed to bringing peace to Is
raelis and Palestinians are drawing powerful
historical connections, however difficult they
are to swallow.
Finally, Magen suggests that one cannot
make peace with apartheid, and that SCAI's
campaign is effectively "against co-existence
and peace." In fact, SCAI seeks the opposite
— an end to unjust apartheid policies as a
