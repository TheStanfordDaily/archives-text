### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its first encounter with a top-25 op
ponent. the Stanford women's basketball
team was narrowly defeated 55-52 by No.
24 Brigham Young University last night.
The loss, which eliminated the No. 4 Car
dinal from the Preseason Women's Na
tional Invitation Tournament (WNIT),
dropped Stanford to 1-1 in pre-confer
ence play, while the Cougars improved to
2-0.
BYU put together an 18-2 run in the
final 7:23 to stun the Cardinal. With 18
seconds left, the Cougars were down by
one. Freshman Haley Hall came up big.
hitting the last of her team-high 15 points
from behind the arc. With junior Candice
Wiggins as her defender, Hall banked the
shot off the glass: it dropped and BYU
took a 54-52 lead.
Stanford had a final chance at the
other end, but a missed layup by Wiggins
and two missed put-backs by senior Kris
ten Newlin forced the Cardinal to foul
when Hall grabbed the defensive board.
Hall sunk one of the two free throws, and
the Cougars clinched a win, along with a
ticket to the semifinal round of the WNIT.
Stanford led throughout the first half,
but BYU remained close, opening the
door for a second-half turnaround. In the
first period, senior center Brooke Smith
led the team in scoring with eight points,
but the Cougars' ability to shut down her
signature hook shot caused only part of
Stanford's offensive struggles. Sopho
more Jillian Harmon and senior Clare
Bodensteiner followed with five points
each, while Wiggins contributed only two
points for the half.
Although the Cardinal led by eight
with 1:33 to play in the first half, three
pointers by I iall and junior Mallary Gille
spie brought BYU to within two at the

break. 28-26.
Smith recognized the Cougars' success
in preventing scoring opportunities for
the Cardinal's post.
"They have some pretty physical post
players." Smith said. "They did a good job
ol denying me and our other post players,
and they collapsed well as team."
With just over seven minutes remain
ing in the game, Stanford posted its
largest lead of the night. 50-37. However,
scoring droughts plagued the Cardinal in
the second half, making it difficult to hang
on to their advantage. Stanford had no
field goals as the clock ran from 14:25 to
10:50, and posted only one bv Wiggins in
the last 7:3(i of the game. 'Hie team was
also hurt by 17 turnovers, as well as by the
Cougars' 20 defensive rebounds and 11
three-pointers.
Coach Tara VanDerveer acknowl
edged HYlJ's high level of play, but also
attributed the loss to mistakes by her own
players.
"I think BYU played an excellent
game." VanDerveer said. "We knew com
ing in that they are a tough team, but I
think we were too far off people and gave
them a lot of open looks. It was a very
physical game, but we had opportunities
to win. Unfortunately, down the stretch
we made some bad turnovers, and some
bad decisions. Our team is very disap
pointed. but we're looking to young play
ers to contribute. Tonight, we just didn't
get it done."
Smith agreed that the game was decid
ed in large part by Stanford's execution
problems.
