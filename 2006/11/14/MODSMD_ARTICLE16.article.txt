# MLS bends like Beckham
## 
### 
1 stayed up "til 3 a.m., playing FIFA
'07 on Xbox last night, so I am
pretty darn tired.
This, of course, came at the heels of
a 13-hour "Desperate Housewives"
marathon on Saturday, meaning I
wasn't exactly productive this past
weekend. Nevertheless, 1 fought off
the urge to visit Wal-Mart, and in
stead decided to spend countless
hours running through-passes to
Ronaldinho, only to blow a two-goal
lead and lose in the seventh rounds of
penalty kicks.
But my loss to Argentina wasn't
the only soccer match to come down
to PK.s last night. In just their first
season in I louston after moving from
San Jose, the Dynamo captured the
MLS Cup by edging the New Eng
land Revolution. 4-3, in penalties.
"Fascinating," 1 thought. Well, not
really. But I figured I would at least
mention it to the crowd of soccer
junkies watching me battle it out on a
Xbox game so realistic that 1 thought
1 was in Brazil, watching the game
with a hot dog in hand.
"Ehh...."
My assumption was correct — no
body cared.
It's easy to see why Major League
Soccer doesn't garner the same atten
tion as other premier soccer leagues
throughout the world. Other than a
few nationally known players, such as
the Los Angeles Galaxy's Landon
Donovan, the MLS lacks serious star
power — the star power that comes
only with the arrival of international
ly recognized names.
Now, don't get me wrong. We
won't be seeing Ronaldinho or Zi

dane wearing a Revolution jersey any
time soon. But with the Designated
Player Rule that was signed this past
Saturday, the MLS may come one
step closer to securing a larger fan
base.
The " David Beckham" rule, as it is
commonly known, will allow each
MLS squad to sign one player whose
salary will not be counted toward the
$2-million salary cap per team.Teams
will be able to trade this special roster
slot among each other, but no team
will be able to possess more than two
designated players.
Now in its 11 th year,the MLS must
be foaming at the mouth at the
thought of acquiring names such as
Beckham, whose contract with Real
Madrid ends this year, and Ronaldo
— the all-time scoring leader in
World Cup history — who remains
unhappy on the bench for Real
Madrid.
Both the Galaxy and the New
York Red Bulls have been linked to
discussion with Beckham, who runs a
youth camp at the Galaxy's Home
Depot Center in Los Angeles.
We could very well be entering the
golden age of soccer in the United

States. In addition to the David Beck
ham rule, the MLS recently signed
several national television deals,
meaning every MLS game this season
will be broadcast somewhere on TV.
The United States has seen the
construction of four soccer-specific
stadiums since 1999, and two new sta
diums will be built for the 2007 MLS
season. Though two Florida teams
have been disbanded in the league's
11-year history, the addition of four
teams — the Chicago Fire in 1998.
Real Salt Lake and C'hivas U.S.A. in
2004 and Toronto FC in 2007 —
speaks to the growing momentum of
the league.
Though only two teams — the
Galaxy and F.C. Dallas — have yet to
turn an actual profit, the MLS is slow
ly en route to overall profitability,
with ticket sales rising 25 percent dur
ing the last off-season.
I couldn't even begin to fathom
the possibilities should names like
Beckham and Ronaldo find their way
over to the U.S. Maybe Americans
will finally be able to shell their impa
tience for physical brutality and come
to appreciate the intricate sport that
the rest of the planet already does.
It will take some years for U.S. soc
cer to truly gain the respect of the na
tion — including myself. After all, no
matter what may happen this offsea
son. my friends and I will still be cry
ing in 2010 when Mexico is eliminat-

Ed from the World Cup.
