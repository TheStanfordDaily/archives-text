# MLS bends like Beckham

### 
1 stayed up "til 3 a.m., playing FIFA
'07 on Xbox last night, so I am
pretty darn tired.
This, of course, came at the heels of
a 13-hour "Desperate Housewives"
marathon on Saturday, meaning I
wasn't exactly productive this past
weekend. Nevertheless, 1 fought off
the urge to visit Wal-Mart, and in
stead decided to spend countless
hours running through-passes to
Ronaldinho, only to blow a two-goal
lead and lose in the seventh rounds of
penalty kicks.
But my loss to Argentina wasn't
the only soccer match to come down
to PK.s last night. In just their first
season in I louston after moving from
San Jose, the Dynamo captured the
MLS Cup by edging the New Eng
land Revolution. 4-3, in penalties.
"Fascinating," 1 thought. Well, not
really. But I figured I would at least
mention it to the crowd of soccer
junkies watching me battle it out on a
Xbox game so realistic that 1 thought
1 was in Brazil, watching the game
with a hot dog in hand.
"Ehh...."
My assumption was correct — no
body cared.
It's easy to see why Major League
Soccer doesn't garner the same atten
tion as other premier soccer leagues
throughout the world. Other than a
few nationally known players, such as
the Los Angeles Galaxy's Landon
Donovan, the MLS lacks serious star
power — the star power that comes
only with the arrival of international
ly recognized names.
Now, don't get me wrong. We
won't be seeing Ronaldinho or Zi
