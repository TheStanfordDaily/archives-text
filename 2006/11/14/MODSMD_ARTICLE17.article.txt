## Men ready for Spartan battle Winning season opener excites Card for CBE Classic 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
After Saturday's 92-72 win
over Siena in the season opener,
it was difficult for Stanford's
men's basketball players to limit
their optimism.Three days later,
though, the Cardinal are spend
ing more time looking at what
they need to improve, than what
went right.
"You can't get too excited,"
said sophomore guard Anthony
Goods, who scored a career-high
30 points against the Saints. "We
made a lot of mistakes. We
turned the ball over 20 times â€”
that's way too many. There are
still a lot of things we need to
fix."
Stanford will get a chance to
correct some of those mistakes
tonight when they face the San
Jose State Spartans in the first
round of the College Basketball

The Spartans, unlike Siena, have a stable of talented frontcourt play
ers who should give freshman center Robin Lopez more of a challenge.
Listed as 6-foot-10, senior center Menelik Barbary will be the tallest
player that the Stanford freshman has faced in a college game.
"This will be my first time playing against a good-size post." Lopez
said."l'll have to see how I can handle that on a college level."
Lopez looked dominant in his first time out in a Stanford uniform.
The 7-foot newcomer tied a school record for blocks in a game with six,
while also scoring 14 points and pulling in 15 rebounds.
"After the British Columbia game, 1 realized that small things make
a big difference in college," Lopez said."lt turns out those things aren't
so small anymore."
Tonight's game is the first of potentially four games for the Cardinal
in the CBE Classic. The winner tonight will play the winner of this af

semifinals on the line. If the Cardinal can advance out of the Palo Alto
region, they would likely face No. 11 Duke in Kansas City, Mo.
