overcame wet and muddy conditions to
enjoy a successful Saturday at the NCAA
West Region Championships in Portland,
Ore. The top-ranked women's squad fin
ished first and the No. 7 men's team
claimed second place.
The team results were a repeat of not

also last month's Pac-10 Conference
Championships, at which the Cardinal
women placed first and the men placed
second.
Junior Arianna Lambie was the
women's individual winner for the second
year in a row, while fellow junior Neftalem
Araia finished first in the men's race.
As in the Pac-10 Championship, the
Cardinal stayed close together in the
women's 6,000-meter race and secured
three of the top four finishes among 199
runners. Lambie led the way with an im
pressive time of 20 minutes, 58.85 seconds,
followed closely in the runner-up slot by
