# CLUB SPORTS
## Students keep rackets swinging, serve up club tourney 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
You first picked up a racket when you
were nine. You played tennis throughout
high school, fitting hours of practice into a
schedule packed with academics and other
extracurricular activities. You were a pretty
good player, but you mostly just loved the
game and the thrill of competition.
And then you were admitted to Stanford,
where the players are more than just good,
where they are heavily recruited and where
most prepare for professional careers. How
do you give up a huge part of your life?
A group of Stanford students have re

fused to. Club Tennis sponsored a mixed
doubles tournament this weekend, hosting
ten teams of amateur students. With the
winners from each of the three brackets
facing each other in a round-robin final,
sophomores Tad Henry and Ana Pena
emerged victorious, while second place
went to Quin Garcia, a masters student in
Management Science and Engineering,
who played alongside his mother, Nancy
Garcia.
Most of the students in the tournament
were varsity tennis athletes in high school,
and the level of competition was fierce.
Henry had played on the varsity team at
Haverford University before transferring to

Stanford, but now plays on the club team.
"The biggest thing I miss from Haverford
is not being able to play tennis, so this is sort
of a substitute," he said.
Event organizer Carling Nguyen, a senior
and Daily staff writer, said that students
shouldn't leave a sport just because of the
high level of competition at Stanford.
"Everyone at Stanford is really talented at
what they do," she said. "And. Stanford
prides itself on its athletics. But there are a lot
of very competitive athletes here who might
not be of the caliber of varsity, but still want
to keep up with their passion."
To appeal to these types of athletes. Club
Tennis was founded two years ago and has

grown rapidly since. With 100 students and
other community members on their email list
and a core group of 25 players, the team won
the United States Tennis Association
(USTA) Northern California regional tour
nament last year and received a bid for the
national championships, where the team
competed against similar teams from dozens
of other schools.
Byron Yu.a sixth-year doctoral student in
Electrical Engineering, has been with the
team since its founding.
"In the beginning, it used to be a social
club, and officers organized tournaments
for the campus," he said. "But in the last few
years, the competitive aspect has been real

ly great."
Nguyen emphasized, however, that there
is still room for less dedicated members.
"A large base of our players are on the
club team, but we have a few non-core play
ers," she said. "Every Friday afternoon we
have an open practice to increase interest in
tennis."
The team continues to face considerable
problems with funding. Club Sports has de
nied the team money, forcing it to appeal to
independent organizations each year. I"he
tournament itself was motivated by a grant
they received, which required that the team
hold events on campus to promote tennis
among everyday students.
