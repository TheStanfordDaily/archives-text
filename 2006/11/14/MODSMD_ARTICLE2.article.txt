# Trent Johnson Exclusive Spotlight
## YOUNG, BUT NOT RESTLESS "Just because we're young, that's not going to be an excuse to play bad basketball." 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Last week.The Daily caught up with men's
basketball coach Trent Johnson before the
Cardinal's 92-72 season-opening win over
Siena. Johnson made no bones about the hur
dles this team faces — stressing that "it is what
it is" almost 10 times in the full, unedited 17-
minute interview — but he seemed as opti
mistic as ever in his third year at Stanford.

The Stanford Daily: If this year's team
through 21 practices played last year's team
through 21 practices, which team do you think

would be better on offense and on defense?
Trent Johnson: If 1 remember right, at this
time last year. Matt was banged up, Danny was
banged up, and that's hard because last year's
group wasn't very good at this time last year
either because we had so many injuries.
And this year's team is in the same situa
tion from the standpoint that we've got three
guys who are under the weather—[fresh
man] Brook [Lopez], [junior] Peter [Prowitt|
and [junior) Taj [Finger] is just now getting
himself back in. So our identity, how we would
like to play, being a predominantly inside-out
oriented team, we don't get that look, as op
posed to last year's group — we knew we were

going to be perimeter-oriented from the start.
The experience factor is what it is — that's a
hard gauge.
TSI): You mentioned inside-out this year ver
sus perimeter-oriented last year.
TJ: Last year. Matt [Haryasz] was a guy that
could go inside, but was more comfortable
shooting the 15-footer, more comfortable
shooting the 12-foot J. Danny [Grunfeld] and
Chris [Hernandez] were both guys who loved
to shoot from the perimeter and basically
loved to get things done off the dribble and off
screens.

Stanford Coach Trent Johnson stressed his team's youth in his interview with the Daily. "The reality is, we're young and there may be some people
we compete against who have better players," Johnson said.
Do we have some guys that are capable? That
depends on time. Anthony's a guy who's never
scored on this level on a consistent basis. Landry's
a freshman and Kenny Brown's getting an oppor
tunity. But with [freshman] Robin [Lopez], with
[freshman] Brook [Lopez], with their size and
their strength, though they haven't done it on a
consistent basis yet, that's what we have to estab
lish. Throw the ball inside. Find out what the de
fense is going to let us have. And if they collapse,
throw it back out. So we're going to have some
guys who are going to have to knock down some
open shots and finish around the basket.

"It is amazing how good you
can look when the ball is going
down."

TS1): Looking at the rest of the Pac-10, it should
be strong. What would be a successful league sea
son for this team?
TJ: Let's remain healthy and let's get better. 1
don't put wins and losses on anything — never
have, never will. Take care of the little things, the
details that become big things: taking care of the
ball, rebounding, defending, making the right
pass, practicing and competing at a high level,
staying together as a group through the rough
times, through the tough times. 1 like to think of
the five "A's" — have a positive attitude, be ag
gressive. understand you're going to have to ad
just at some point throughout the year, under
stand angles and be accountable to yourself and
to your teammates.
I've always stayed away from predictions be
cause the unknowns are what they are. Going into
last year, I said the predictions for that team
weren't fair. And I say that based upon, yeah you
have a guy [Grunfeld] who's All-League coming
back, but I saw what he went through to get him
self ready every day. And then Matt was very vul
nerable with his injuries. So it was a complete lack
of respect to our competition if you said we were
going to be this good [preseason No. 13 national
ly]. And look at it now.Cedric Bozeman's playing
for the Atlanta Hawks. Jordan Farmar's playing
for the Lakers. Danny's in Germany and Matt's
going to be in the NBA D-League.Talent is what
it is.
TSI): I low much time do you spend on recruiting
and is there anything in particular you do that
makes you a good recruiter?
TJ: A lot of people talk about this year's recruit
ing class. but let's judge them at the end of their
careers. I happen to have an opportunity to rep
resent Stanford University, which is the most
prestigious academic-athletic institution in the
country, so that's not a hard recruit. Do the lim
ited numbers affect us? Well, they do, but it is
what it is and the bottom line is, we've been able

to sustain a high level of success.
What makes me good, if I am good in anybody
else's mind, is that when I go into a young man's
home and speak to his parents, to his guardians, I
want them to have the impression of me that,
"He's going to be candid, he's going to be honest
and he's going to represent the institution he
works for and the people he works with in the ut
most fashion." I've always tried to surround my
self with quality players and quality coaches, and
it's pretty evident that you're only as good as the
people surrounding you.
TSI): How does having a young team change
your coaching approach?
TJ: Well it doesn't change my approach in that
patience isn't one of my strengths, but that's silly;
I know 1 have to be patient with this group. But in
terms of execution, that's going to be demanded
of this basketball team. Just because we're young,
that's not going to he an excuse to play bad bas
ketball. But make no mistake about it. I under
stand I'm going to have to be patient, knowing
that for the most part there are 12 guys who are
going into situations that they haven't been into.
And that's exciting: pressure, expectations —
those things never cross my lips with any team
I've ever had:excitement, opportunity do.
I'm going to give you an example: It's 25-24 at
the half of the exhibition game, but you know
what? We had 15 open jump shots. Was Anthony
Goods or Landry Fields trying too hard? Proba
bly, but I've never been one to get mad at a kid
when he misses a shot. I le's not trying to miss it,
he's not trying to miss a free throw. Now. if our ex
ecution was flawed or guys were trying to do too
many things on their own or be selfish, so to
speak, now that's different.
TSI): What does it take to sustain a winning pro
gram here at Stanford versus anywhere else?
TJ: You have to get good players, good student
athletes. I'll say this and it's the bottom line:Tliis
program, this institution.is what it is. You're going
to get good-quality student-athletes, and they're
going to overachieve and win. It's been like that
for years.
Bottom line, in any program here, when we
haven't been successful in everybody else's eyes,
it's been because of maybe numbers, maybe in
juries, but probably the opponent being better. It's
hard for people to accept that, but it's harder for
coaches and players to accept that because our in
stitution is everything that's right about college
athletics. It's the student-athlete and it's not an
NBA or NI- Loi WNBA feeder program or minor
league system, so to speak.
I'll be the first one. as it relates to our basket
ball program, to make sure everybody under
stands where we're at. I see these guys every day.
If you get good enough players and don't screw
things up. me as a head coach, you're going to be
successful. But the reality is, we're young and
there may be some people we compete against
who have better players. So as a coach, you have
to tip your hat to them. But in terms of us playing
to our ability and maximizing what we have as a
program, oh, that's always going to happen.
