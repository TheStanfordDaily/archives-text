# Trent Johnson Exclusive Spotlight
## YOUNG, BUT NOT RESTLESS "Just because we're young, that's not going to be an excuse to play bad basketball." 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Last week.The Daily caught up with men's
basketball coach Trent Johnson before the
Cardinal's 92-72 season-opening win over
Siena. Johnson made no bones about the hur
dles this team faces — stressing that "it is what
it is" almost 10 times in the full, unedited 17-
minute interview — but he seemed as opti
mistic as ever in his third year at Stanford.

The Stanford Daily: If this year's team
through 21 practices played last year's team
through 21 practices, which team do you think

would be better on offense and on defense?
Trent Johnson: If 1 remember right, at this
time last year. Matt was banged up, Danny was
banged up, and that's hard because last year's
group wasn't very good at this time last year
either because we had so many injuries.
And this year's team is in the same situa
tion from the standpoint that we've got three
guys who are under the weather—[fresh
man] Brook [Lopez], [junior] Peter [Prowitt|
and [junior) Taj [Finger] is just now getting
himself back in. So our identity, how we would
like to play, being a predominantly inside-out
oriented team, we don't get that look, as op
posed to last year's group — we knew we were

going to be perimeter-oriented from the start.
The experience factor is what it is — that's a
hard gauge.
TSI): You mentioned inside-out this year ver
sus perimeter-oriented last year.
TJ: Last year. Matt [Haryasz] was a guy that
could go inside, but was more comfortable
shooting the 15-footer, more comfortable
shooting the 12-foot J. Danny [Grunfeld] and
Chris [Hernandez] were both guys who loved
to shoot from the perimeter and basically
loved to get things done off the dribble and off
screens.

Stanford Coach Trent Johnson stressed his team's youth in his interview with the Daily. "The reality is, we're young and there may be some people
we compete against who have better players," Johnson said.
