## No. 1 Gophers dig Cardinal loss Men still optimistic for season, Cal-State Fullerton meet 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Things may not have been perfect
for the Stanford wrestlers at the
Bison Open in Fargo, N.D. last Satur
day. but there were plenty of reasons
to remain optimistic for the season.
The Cardinal placed seven wrestlers
in a tournament field that included
Minnesota, the nation's top-ranked
team.
Junior Ail-American Tanner
Gardner was Stanford's lone first
place finisher, wrestling at 125
pounds. Gardner earned two techni
cal falls and a pin before squeaking
out a 1-0 decision over Minnesota's
Jayson Ness. He finished the day 4-
0, remaining undefeated for the
year.
Coach Kerry McCoy praised
Gardner's dedication and dominance
in a spectacular season so far. but also
pointed out that the junior has yet to
face any ranked opponents.
"(Gardner J just goes out there and
forces his will on his opponents."
McCoy said. "Everyone knows what
he's going to do, they just can't stop it.
With the way he's pushing himself.

and how he's added a few things to
his arsenal, we really like what we're
seeing. He's going to be tested in the
next few weeks, though."
The Cardinal also placed junior
Josh Zupancic, who was second at
157 pounds. Junior Scott Loescher
and senior Brian Perry placed second
and third, respectively, at 165 pounds.
Loescher and Perry each lost just one
match, both to the same opponent no
less: Minnesota's Scott Glasser
pinned Perry at 4 minutes, 50 seconds
and won a 6-1 decision over Loesch
er. McCoy said he expected the com
petition between Loescher and Perry
to continue making both wrestlers
better.
"That's a situation where guys are
pretty competitive and we're just
going to have to gauge it as it goes,"
McCoy said. "Hopefully, having two
guys at that same weight, they're just
going to make each other get better.
They're going to push each other con
stantly. In the end, the best guy will
go. but they've got a lot of time to iron
it out."
Also placing for Stanford were
sophomore Luke Feist at 174
pounds and freshman Zach Giesen
at IX4 pounds who each took home
third place. Heavyweight junior
Phil Doerner earned a fifth place
finish.
"We're definitely moving in the
right direction," McCoy said. "One
thing that I keep stressing to our guys

is that we start about a month later
than everyone else, so we don't want
to be wrestling our best right now,
we're just trying to get better."
While the Cardinal did well over
all, they had consistent trouble with
the Golden Gophers, as Stanford
wrestlers were only 4-13 against Min
nesota.
"We're not in the same league
right now as Minnesota," McCoy
said. "But we're trying to get there,
and we need to see those teams so we
can work to be like them."
Stanford will open up conference
competition this weekend as they
travel to Fullerton, Calif., Friday to
take on Pacific-10 Conference rival
Cal-State Fullerton, just before they
face more West Coast competition in
Saturday's Fullerton Open.
"As far as the Fullerton dual,obvi
ously the way you compete against
conference opponents has big impli
cations because it's going to go into
conference seeding," McCoy said.
"And right now we're 1-2 in duals, so
we want to even up our dual record so
we can get back on the winning side.
On the other hand, the tournament is
going to help us get into the flow, and
we'll see some of the guys we're going
to have to beat."
Following this weekend's Fuller
ton Open, the Cardinal will see a
break in competition, and its next
event will be the Las Vegas Invita
tional, Dec. 1-2.
