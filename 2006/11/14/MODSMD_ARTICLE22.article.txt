its undefeated season, downing the defending-nation
al champion. No. 4 Auburn, and No. 15 Tennessee in
this weekend's double dual meet in Knoxville,Tenn.
Five consecutive wins late in the meet gave the Cardi
nal a 191.5-161 .5 victory over the Tigers and a 245-108
win over the Lady Vols.
"This was a breakthrough swim for our program.'"
head coach Lea Maurer said. "It was a big deal, be
cause this is a tough challenge to go on the road and
face schools like Auburn and Tennessee. We had some
great swims and just kept coming."
The Stanford victory looked questionable early on
Saturday, when Auburn won three events early in the
day and cut Stanford's 37-point lead after the first day
of competition. Hut Maurer was confident in her team
throughout the meet.
"We anticipated a tougher assignment today," said
Maurer."But, we stayed focused and composed even
when Auburn got close. We have some people that
showed they wanted to race against some of the best
swimmers in the country."
Freshman Julia Smit continued to lead the team,
recording three individual victories.along with wins in
the 2(X) and 400-yard medley relays. ()n Friday, Smit
recorded NCAA A' times in the 4(K) IM (4 minutes,

fourth- and fifth-best times in school history in the re
spective events. Smit also won the 2001 M on Saturday
with a time of 2:01.17.
"Julia was definitely the talk of the pool deck."
Maurer said. "People know she is making a mark on
Stanford and is starting to do so on a national level as
well. She is a composed and focused swimmer and
wants to be a part of rebuilding Stanford's tradition
and getting back to where we want to be on the na
tional scene."
Juniors Caroline Bruce and Brooke Bishop, fresh
man Elaine Breeden and senior Cassidy King also
were strong performers for the Cardinal, as each put
up two first-place times.
Bruce won the 200 breast with a 2:12.16, "A swim
and the 1 (K) breast with a time of 1:04.05. Breeden

and symbolized our tenacity today," Maurer said.

diving events, with scores of 285.40 and 315.30 points,
respectively.

into the swing of competing, deal with competition
nerves, focus on the right cues and hit my dives like I
do in practice," Krug said. "This meet was a big im
provement for me in that respect over our last one in
Texas, and the wins made it that much better. They
made me all the more excited to get back to the pool,
keep working, keep improving and get ready for the
next meet."

Stahley also put up strong swims for the Cardinal.
