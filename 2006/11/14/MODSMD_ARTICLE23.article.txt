# Return of the Movie Express
## Shuttle to theatres to return after hiatus 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Short days, cold nights, rainy
weather.This winter will be no differ
ent, except that students can now es
cape the elements with the ASSU's
new shuttle bus service to local
movie theaters.
Hoping to revive a now-defunct
tradition, the ASSU plans to reawak
en the Movie Express, which was ini
tially created to provide an alcohol
free, off-campus alternative for stu
dents and "to compensate for the
lack of transportation for students,
especially for freshmen," said sopho
more ASSU Senator Nabill Idrisi,
who is spearheading the effort.
"The Movie Express fits perfectly
as an additional means for an enter
tainment and social outlet." Idrisi
said.' [Both are] huge needs for the
average Stanford student who needs
a break after a busy week."
In the past, a shuttle picked up

students from Tressider Union every
half hour to take them to AMC Mer
cado. The shuttle ran weekly on Fri
day nights, making its last run in the
spring of 2(X)4.
While it ran for a few successive
years, the Movie Express was even
tually discontinued. Some students
said the shuttle service wouldn't nec
essarily serve a need.
"I wouldn't use it because 1 have a
car," said junior Isabel Kim. "I
wouldn't have used it when 1 was a
freshman because I knew people
who had cars."
But ASSU senators are hopeful
this year will be different.
"We're hoping that with greater
advertising, especially to freshmen
and first-year grads, we can increase
usage significantly this year," Idrisi
wrote in an email to The Daily.
While the final logistics are still
being finalized, the ASSU is leaning
toward Friday night shuttle services,
as in the past.
"There is usually more campus
programming on Saturday nights,"
Idrisi said. "And we don't want to de
tract from FLiCKS on Sunday
niiihts."

in addition, senators are debating
between serving C.'entur> Shoreline in
Mountain View or the AMC Mercado
in Santa Clara. They are, however,
leaning towards the AMC Mercado
because there are more entertainment
opportunities in the area and the fact
that the AMC is a larger theater.
Others had yet more ideas for the
location.
"1 vote for the Redwood City the
ater," said sophomore Pokey Reese.
"It's a brand new theater anil there's
more to do — it's better."
The ASSU plans to offer the serv
ice only in winter quarter, but will re
assess need for upcoming years. The
Movie Express will be totally free to
students, as it was in previous years,
with the President's office support
ing the $3,500 it costs to run one bus
for the quarter.
Idrisi, working with ASSU Presi
dent Elizabeth Heng, a senior, wrote
a proposal to "diversify the types of
activities that are available to stu
dents."
"I think it's a great thing for the
ASSU to do," said sophomore Evan
Purcell. "It gets students off-campus
and out into the real world."
