## In a quadrillionth blink of an eye, history captured X-ray captures image for uncharted first

A cube of one quadrillion pennies
would measure a half-mile on each
side — almost twice as long as the
Sears Tower — and weigh three bil

lion tons. To even contemplate the
number, one thousand trillions, bog
gles the mind. Yet. at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, re
searchers climbed into uncharted
territory — into the quadrillions —
to achieve a historic first.
SLAC researchers used a 25
quadrillionth-second X-ray pulse to
capture a high-resolution image of a
nanoscale object for the first time in

history.
"This result is a remarkable vali
dation of the concept of imaging
using single pulses from a free-elec
tron laser," said SLAC Director of
Photon Science Keith Hodgson.
Using the technique of flash dif
fraction imaging, an international re
search group including the SLAC re
searchers managed to capture an
image of the object just before the

laser destroyed it. "Nature Physics"
will publish the results in its Decem
ber print edition.
The next step for the group, fund
ed in part by the US. Department of
Energy, is to replicate the results with
"harder" X-rays, or those with short
er wavelengths. In turn, these rays
can be used to examine atomic- and
molecule-sized matter, such as pro
teins.
