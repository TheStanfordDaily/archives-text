## Ceremony, speeches honor vets Sparse, spirited crowd at lunchtime in White Plaza 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
The clouds, in a welcome gesture of
patriotism, did not hurst yesterday until
the conclusion of the Veteran's Day
Ceremony in White Plaza. Sophomore
Chelsi Butler of a cappella group Every
day People sung the national anthem,
and then Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neu
mann, dean of the Office of Religious
Life, took the podium.
Karlin-Neumann took the opportu
nity to stress the importance of unified
support for American democracy.
"Our democracy is comprised of
many voices, many paths," Karlin-Neu
man said."lt grows not in self-righteous
ness, but in self-correction. Freedom is
found when we treasure democracy.
Only if we each tend to this garden of

democracy will it grow strong and
healthy. Take the deal, enter the fray â€”
we are counting on you."
A common theme throughout the
ceremony was inclusive support of
American troops. In an effort to com
municate the inclusive nature of the
event, representatives from the College
Republicans, the Stanford Democrats,
and the ASSU attended, each offering
their own perspectives on the special oc
casion.
Senior Megan Reiss, president of the
College Republicans, spoke about
growing up in a military family and im
plored the crowd to devote themselves
to Thomas Jefferson's principles of life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
She praised military members for their
sacrifices, challenges like those she wit
nessed firsthand. Citing mistreatment of
soldiers after Vietnam, Reiss encour
aged students to support Iraq War veter
ans regardless of their views on the con
flict itself.
"We need to welcome home our

newest veterans," Reiss said. "We can
not hold them responsible for govern
ment policies."
Sophomore Niko Milonopoulos of
the Stanford Democrats agreed.
"These soldiers are on the frontlines
of justice and equality, ridding the world
of tyranny of oppression and replacing
them with the doves of freedom," he
said. "Let us set aside the political con
flict and remember the men and
women. Democrat and Republican
alike, fighting side by side for the ideals
that we all cherish."
Sophomore Sagar Doshi of the
ASSU argued that Stanford students
are lucky to be tucked away in the "bub
ble." but in doses.
" Illis privilege of security can blind
us every day on what it takes to achieve
it,"he said.
Lt. Col. Scott Murray, a National Se
curity Affairs Fellow at the Hoover In
stitution, noted that military veterans

make up eight percent of the popula
tion.
"All veterans personify one virtue
before all others,service before self,"
Murray said. "I am proud to be a
member of the United States Armed
Forces first and foremost because of
the opportunity to serve with sol
diers, sailors, marines, airmen, and
most importantly their families."
Murray shared a story of airmen
stationed in Indonesia after the 2004
Indian Ocean tsunami who dis
obeyed direct orders to evacuate in
order to help the people affected by
the disaster.
Drawn by hundreds of emails and
a Facebook event posting to drum up
support, the crowd was thin but at
tentive.
"I was happy that the people who
did turnout seemed to be really en
gaged in the discussion," junior
Marissa Cramer said. "It's always re
ally hard for one person to get the
word out about an event. The inspi
ration for this event came from my
fellowship with the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracy 1 thought
that it would be important and
meaningful to do a Veteran's Day

ceremony.
Hie event, a reincarnation of the
Sept. 11 memorial held last year, was
intended to be a reminder to stu
dents of how many sacrifices have
been made for their freedom.
"1 was really hoping that people
who don't have that connection [to
the military | would gain that connec
tion," she said. "You have to take a

few moments out of your life at Stan
ford to realize that people are fight
ing for the freedoms you enjoy here.
It's important that we have an appre
ciation for the people working to de
fend our security."
Graduate student Jeremy Wong
from the Stanford Wind Ensemble
played "Taps" on the trumpet to cap
off the event.
