# WINTER BREAK
## Left out in the cold at Hammarskjold International students bemoan housing crunch 
### LAURA RUMPF 
If you've been had all year, you may
receive a lump of coal in your stocking. A
raw deal — until you look at the dozens
of international students that will spend
the holidays sleeping on the floor of a
cramped Row House.
Every winter break, as many as 30 in
ternational students sleep on mattresses
on the floors of the small lounge in 1 lam
marskjold. unable to go home due to trav
el costs or visa complications. The Uni
versity restricted winter break housing a
decade ago,and then made matters worse
in 2004 when it decided to close graduate
student dorms and the Bechtel Interna
tional Center over winter break, making
1 iammarskjold the only on-campus hous
ing option for students.
Shirley Everett, vice provost of the Of
fice of Residence and Dining Enterprises,
cites limited security and energy costs as
reasons for closing all other facilities.Hie

office maintains that the mattresses and
the single kitchen in Hammarskjold have
adequately met students' needs for win
ter break housing in the past.
"It seems to have worked" Everett
said.
International students, however, beg
to differ Hammarskjold, they say. is far
too small for the number of housing re
quests it receives.
I lammarskjold, a co-op established in
1970 at the request of Bechtel Interna
tional C enter, houses 26 residents during
the school year but the lounge and
kitchen are the only areas kept open over
the winter.
Though the multicultural-themed
house is a popular residential option, for
mer Hammarskjold financial manager
Irungu Nyakera has experienced the
house's shortcoming firsthand. Nyakera
spent his freshman and sophomore win
ters in Hammarskjold's lounge, unable to
pay for an expensive ticket back to his na
tive Kenya.
"I slept on a mattress under the
piano." he said. "Other students slept in
the computer cluster.There is no pri
vacy when twenty six students are all
together in one room. You can't play
music; there is no room for guests to
come for the holidays."
Filip Krsmanovic, a 2006 grail,
echoed Nyakera's discontent.
"Just leaving Hammarskjold
open seems like another way the
University stiffs international stu
dents," he said. "A lot of internation
al [students) can't afford to go home,
especially when they're paying these
huge fees out here, so there is an ob
vious need to stay."
Nyakera argued that the Univer
sity's greatest concern should he in
ternational freshmen, who are least
likely to have friends or connections
off-campus or be able to find a sub
let.
"It's not just one person who's af
fected," he said. "Quite a few fresh
men stay."
However, Nyakera admitted that
he does not know exactly how many
international students are left with

out housing each winter. The Uni
versity does not either.
"We don't track that," Everett
said. "It's just not something we do."
Without the numbers to prove an
outstanding need for better lodging
over the break, international stu
dents say they have been ill
equipped to confront the University.
That may not be the case after this
year. At the request of several inter
national student leaders, ASSU
President Elizabeth Heng, a senior,
devised a survey to better gauge the
plans of international freshmen for
this winter.
lleng said the questionnaire is
only the first step in what she hopes
will be a reform process of the Uni
versity's current policy.
"I will be working very closely
with housing, the Alumni Center,
Bechtei International Center and
the President's office to move for
ward with this agenda," she said.
From a preliminary tabulation of
the responses. Heng estimated that
one fourth of the international fresh
men will have to stay in the United
States over break. Heng said she
hoped the data will prompt the Uni
versity to move forward with a poli
cy that accurately meets internation

al students' need for housing.
I! Stanford does opt for a differ
ent policy, it could look to East Coast
schools that make their campuses
available to students over the holi
days. At Princeton, Dean of Under
graduates Rachel Baldwin said all
residence halls remain open, allow
ing international students "the luxu
ry of staying in their own rooms."
Tufts University closes most of its
facilities, but offers several dorms to
international students free of charge
during the break. Harvard Universi
ty, like Stanford, does not allow most
international students to stay in the
dorms, but has established several
connections with non-profits off
campus that house and feed interna
tional students for the winter.
But at least for this Christmas.
Ilammarskjold will fill to the brims
with mattresses to shelter as many
students as possible for the three
weeks of break.
"Just one dorm, no dining hall
and nothing else open," Krsmanovic
sighed. "That's a bleak picture of
winter break. And come on. winter
break, that's Christmastime, time for
giving, not a time to be sleeping on
the floor and eating tuna from Safe
way."

ternational students sleep on mattresses
on the floors of the small lounge in 1 lam
marskjold. unable to go home due to trav
el costs or visa complications. The Uni
versity restricted winter break housing a
decade ago,and then made matters worse
in 2004 when it decided to close graduate
student dorms and the Bechtel Interna
tional Center over winter break, making
1 iammarskjold the only on-campus hous
ing option for students.
Shirley Everett, vice provost of the Of
fice of Residence and Dining Enterprises,
cites limited security and energy costs as
reasons for closing all other facilities.Hie

office maintains that the mattresses and
the single kitchen in Hammarskjold have
adequately met students' needs for win
ter break housing in the past.
"It seems to have worked" Everett
said.
International students, however, beg
to differ Hammarskjold, they say. is far
too small for the number of housing re
quests it receives.
I lammarskjold, a co-op established in
1970 at the request of Bechtel Interna
tional C enter, houses 26 residents during
the school year but the lounge and
kitchen are the only areas kept open over
the winter.
Though the multicultural-themed
house is a popular residential option, for
mer Hammarskjold financial manager
Irungu Nyakera has experienced the
house's shortcoming firsthand. Nyakera
spent his freshman and sophomore win
ters in Hammarskjold's lounge, unable to
pay for an expensive ticket back to his na
tive Kenya.
"I slept on a mattress under the
piano." he said. "Other students slept in
the computer cluster.There is no pri
vacy when twenty six students are all
together in one room. You can't play
music; there is no room for guests to
come for the holidays."
Filip Krsmanovic, a 2006 grail,
echoed Nyakera's discontent.
"Just leaving Hammarskjold
open seems like another way the
University stiffs international stu
dents," he said. "A lot of internation
al [students) can't afford to go home,
especially when they're paying these
huge fees out here, so there is an ob
vious need to stay."
Nyakera argued that the Univer
sity's greatest concern should he in
ternational freshmen, who are least
likely to have friends or connections
off-campus or be able to find a sub
let.
"It's not just one person who's af
fected," he said. "Quite a few fresh
men stay."
However, Nyakera admitted that
he does not know exactly how many
international students are left with

out housing each winter. The Uni
versity does not either.
"We don't track that," Everett
said. "It's just not something we do."
Without the numbers to prove an
outstanding need for better lodging
over the break, international stu
dents say they have been ill
equipped to confront the University.
That may not be the case after this
year. At the request of several inter
national student leaders, ASSU
President Elizabeth Heng, a senior,
devised a survey to better gauge the
plans of international freshmen for
this winter.
lleng said the questionnaire is
only the first step in what she hopes
will be a reform process of the Uni
versity's current policy.
"I will be working very closely
with housing, the Alumni Center,
Bechtei International Center and
the President's office to move for
ward with this agenda," she said.
From a preliminary tabulation of
the responses. Heng estimated that
one fourth of the international fresh
men will have to stay in the United
States over break. Heng said she
hoped the data will prompt the Uni
versity to move forward with a poli
cy that accurately meets internation

al students' need for housing.
I! Stanford does opt for a differ
ent policy, it could look to East Coast
schools that make their campuses
available to students over the holi
days. At Princeton, Dean of Under
graduates Rachel Baldwin said all
residence halls remain open, allow
ing international students "the luxu
ry of staying in their own rooms."
Tufts University closes most of its
facilities, but offers several dorms to
international students free of charge
during the break. Harvard Universi
ty, like Stanford, does not allow most
international students to stay in the
dorms, but has established several
connections with non-profits off
campus that house and feed interna
tional students for the winter.
But at least for this Christmas.
Ilammarskjold will fill to the brims
with mattresses to shelter as many
students as possible for the three
weeks of break.
"Just one dorm, no dining hall
and nothing else open," Krsmanovic
sighed. "That's a bleak picture of
winter break. And come on. winter
break, that's Christmastime, time for
giving, not a time to be sleeping on
the floor and eating tuna from Safe
way."
