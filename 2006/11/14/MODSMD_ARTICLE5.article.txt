## Building community one student at a time Partying adults, crying kids all in a day's work 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Graduate students live in a diverse
world, inhabiting a wide variety of off-cam
pus and student housing.Tliey bring wives,
husbands and children with them and leave
behind extremely varied work and life ex
periences. All of this creates unique chal
lenges and opportunities for the Commu
nity Associate (CA) program, which at
tempts to instill a sense of community in
University-owned graduate housing.
CAs are responsible for providing op
portunities for students and their families
to meet each other and provide informa
tion about campus resources. Chris Grif
fith. associate dean of graduate student
life, described the breadth of the commu
nity that the CA program in Escondido
Village (EV) serves, including couples, do
mestic partners and families with children.
"Some graduate students arrive here
directly out of their undergraduate expe

rience unci other students have worked in
professional positions before returning to
graduate school," Griffith wrote in an
email to The Daily. "So the needs within
our community are very diverse."
Terry Walker, a CA in EV whose hus
band is a graduate student, works in an
area filled with families.
"With families, the biggest concern is
working around children." Walker wrote
in an email to The Daily. "Not only would
three year olds not enjoy certain events,
like late night loud rowdy keg parties, but
a lot of single grad events would not be
safe for children. All of our EV-wide
events are a focus on our EV kids, and
most of our individual courtyard events
are also focused on children."
Walker described how CAs timed
their events to meet the needs of families.
"Typically our events run on kid time
and do not run late into the night, and we
try to avoid naptime," she said. "The
events are fun, vibrant and full of laugh
ing. playing children. I don't know of any
other place where we could have this kind
But there are also many commu
nities composed of single grad stu
dents. Andrew Lookingbill.a fourth
year doctoral candidate in electrical
engineering and CA in the Rains
Houses, described the atmosphere
that they were trying to create.
"The bottom line is getting people
to meet each other," Lookingbill
said. "Grad school can be a very insu
lar environment, so we foster a sense
of community through these events."
Julie Litzenburger, a fourth-year
graduate student in bioengineering

and CA in Rains, tries to put on a
variety of events.
"We have Rains divided into a
bunch of different neighborhoods,"
she said. "Every week we try to> do
an event with just our neighbor
hood and every few weeks we try to
do a Rains-wide event.The neigh
borhood events can be anything
from subsidized lunches, where we
pay to take residents to lunch. to
horseback riding on the beach or
trips to San Francisco."
CAs receive a stipend of $3C | 0 a
quarter, which is less than most un
dergraduate student staff receiive.
Some international graduate stu
dents also are not able to receive
the money if it endangers their stu
dent visa status. However, the job

does have some non-monetary
perks. Graduate students normally
have only one year of guaranteed
housing. But a CA is ensured a
place in university housing.
ITie CA program is organized by
the Graduate Life Office (GLO),
which was established roughly
seven years ago to unite graduate
community programs. Griffith, Ken
1 Isu and Andrew Hernandez serve
as the three GLO deans and are
available around the clock for
emergency purposes.
The GLO also works closely
with the Graduate Student Pro
gramming Board and Graduate
Student Council to co-sponsor
