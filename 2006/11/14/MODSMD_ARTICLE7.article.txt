## Bush trades ideas with Iraq Study Group 
### TOM RAUM ANNE PLUMMER FLA ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON - President Bush traded
ideas on Iraq with a bipartisan commission
Monday and promised to work with the in
coming Democratic majority toward "com
mon objectives." At the same time, he re
newed his opposition to any timetable for
withdrawing U.S. troops.
As Bush met with the Iraq Study Group,
the Democrat in line to lead the Senate
Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin of
Michigan, said the administration didn't see
that "we're getting deeper and deeper into a
hole."
Levin and other Democrats called for
some troops to come home right away, sug
gesting that would pressure the Iraqi govern
ment into assuming more responsibility.
Bush in turn had stern words for the De
mocrats, less than a week after they won con
trol of both chambers of Congress in
midterm elections in which the Iraq war fig
ured prominently.
Asked about proposals by Levin and oth
ers for a phased troop reduction Bush said.
"I believe it is very important ... for people
making suggestions to recognize t hat the best
military options depend upon the conditions
on the ground."
While Democrats agree that troops
should leave Iraq sooner rather than later,
they remain divided on the specifics. Rep.
John Murtha. D-Pa.. a contender to become
the next majority leader, supports an imme
diate withdrawal of all troops, whereas Levin
and others favor a slower phased withdrawal
and have been reluctant to suggest a firm
timetable.
Whereas Murtha and some others con
tend violence in Iraq will continue so long as
U.S. troops are present. Levin and others
warn that any withdrawal of troops must be
done slowly to avoid a collapse in security.
Baker's panel has been briefed on the De
mocrats' proposals and is considering a range
of options. In addition to considering
whether there should be any timetable to
pull out troops, the panel is studying many
other options, including whether to solicit
Iran and Syria to help stop the fighting.
The president met for more than an hour
with a 10-member panel headed by former
Secretary of State James A. Baker 111 and
former Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton. He
was joined by Vice President Dick Cheney,
Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and National Secu
rity Adviser Stephen I iadley.
The panel then stayed around for a longer
session that included other members of the

president's national security team, including
Secretary of State C'ondoleezza Rice and
outgoing Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld.
Baker and Hamilton later put out a joint
statement. "We were pleased to meet with
senior administration officials today and
look forward to our consultations with some
top Democrats tomorrow. We are working
expeditiously to complete our report and
recommendations," the statement said.
Bush discussed the meeting with re
porters during a picture-taking session in the
Oval Office with visiting Israeli Prime Minis
ter Ehud Olmert.
"1 was impressed by the questions they
asked. ITiey want us to succeed in Iraq, just
like I want us to succeed. So we had a really
good discussion," Bush said.
As to newly empowered Democrats, he
said. "What's interesting is they're beginning
to understand that with victory comes re
sponsibility, and I'm looking forward to
working with the Democrats to achieve com
mon objectives."
White House spokesman Tony Snow de
scribed the meeting with the Iraq panel as a
"general conversation about the situation
there." rather than a preview of what the
group will recommend. "This was not pro
posal-shopping by the Iraq Study Group."
Snow said.
I"he members asked questions of Bush,
and he of them. Snow said, "but there was
care taken not to sort of try to prejudge, or
also to get a jump on what they are going to
do."
Lawmakers barely had begun their post
election session Monday when debate broke
out over the war in Iraq and over Democrat
ic proposals to start bringing home U.S.
troops.
Levin said in a news conference that the
military had done what it could and it was up
to Iraq's politicians to find consensus. "We
cannot save the Iraqis from themselves," he
said.
In addition. Senate Democratic Leader
Harry Reid of Nevada went to the Senate
floor to lend support for a change in Iraq pol
icy.
But Republicans shot back, saying they
would oppose any timetable because it could
cause Iraq to collapse into chaos.
Opponents of Levin's proposal — at least
for now — include Sen. John Warner. R-Va..
outgoing chairman of the Armed Services
Committee. He says Congress must wait until
the Baker-Hamilton panel releases its rec
ommendations.

Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lindsey
Graham of South Carolina, two GOP mem

hers of the Armed Services Committee, said
they would oppose an arbitrary withdrawal
of troops. Collins and Graham have both crit
icized the Bush administration for its han
dling of the war.
Graham recently said Iraq was on the
verge of chaos and demanded accountability,
but on Monday he stood firm on his position
that more troops, not fewer troops, are need
ed to settle the violence there.
Opposing views could deadlock Congress
on the matter. While Republicans have the
majority until the new session begins in Jan
uary. they do so by a slim margin. And when
Democrats take over, they too will have a
razor-thin majority — far short of the 60
votes needed to cut off delaying tactics.
Meanwhile, Democratic leaders are lining
up behind legislation that would extend an
investigative office that unearthed millions

of dollars in waste and fraud associated with
the rebuilding of Iraq. Republican Collins
and Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold of Wis
consin introduced legislation that would
allow the office to continue through October
2008.
Under current law, it will expire in Octo
ber 2007.
Collins and Feingold offered the measure
as an amendment to a military construction
and veterans' spending bill that the Senate
will debate Tuesday. Collins said she will
press for the legislation to be taken up sepa
rately as well to improve its chances.
Rep. Ike Skelton. the incoming chairman
of the Armed Services Committee, intro
duced a similar bill Monday that would be
likely to keep the inspector general's office in
business through 2009 by asking it to investi
gate another $1.7 billion in Iraq funding.

Even before the Iraq Study Group's work
is finished, the panel's report is widely seen as
an opportunity to give the campaign-weary
Democratic and Republican parties a chance
at consensus — or at least a framework for
agreement.
Also on Monday. Gen. John Abizaid. head
of the U.S. Central Command, met with the
Iraqi prime minister to "reaffirm President
Bush's commitment" to success in Iraq, the
government said.
Baker, who served as the first President
Bush's secretary of state, has said the report's
recommendations are likely to fall some
where between the troop withdrawal strate
gy that
Republicans like to say Democrats favor
and the stay-the-course policy until recently
used by Bush and widely ridiculed by De
mocrats.
