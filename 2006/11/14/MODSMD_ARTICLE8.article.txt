SEOUL, South Korea - South Korea's nuclear envoy
said Tuesday that long-stalled, six-party talks on North
Korea's nuclear program could resume by mid-December.

On Monday, South Korea balked at Washington's de
mand that it fully join a U.S.-led effort to intercept North
Korean ships suspected of carrying supplies for the
North's nuclear and missile weapons programs.
I"he South insisted that it was already doing enough to
stem possible weapons proliferation from North Korea

and announced no new measures to sanction the North
under a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning
Pyongyang's first test of a nuclear device on Oct. 9.
North Korea agreed earlier this month to return to the
negotiations with China, Japan. South Korea, Russia and
the United States after staying away from the talks for a
year. A specific date for resuming the talks has not been
set.
"I think it's possible to resume (the talks) by mid-De
cember," Chun Yung-woo, Seoul's chief negotiator to the
talks, said on South Korean radio channel PBC.
"We are making preparations with the thinking that
it's more important to achieve substantial progress when
the six-party talks resume than how quickly we would re
sume the talks," he said.
Chun could not immediately be reached for comment.
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack also
said no date has been set for resuming the talks and he
ruled out November but said there is still hope for a
meeting in December.
Once the talks resume, the top priority will be on de
termining whether North Korea is willing to give up its
nuclear program, Chun said. He also said the North
should not expect rewards just for returning to the nego
tiating table.
Chun was expected to discuss strategy for the nuclear
talks with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts Wednesday
in Hanoi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
Meanwhile, Japan adopted a list of embargoed luxury
items as part of its sanctions imposed on Pyongyang.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki said the list
comprised 24 luxury goods believed to be used by senior
North Korean officials such as cigarettes, liquor, perfume
and motorcycles.
"We hope that North Korea will accept these meas
ures taken by Japan as the message of the international
community's strong concern and condemnation" of its
nuclear program, Shiozaki said.
The ban on luxury items is in line with U.N. sanctions

that ban the sale of major arms to North Korea and call
tor the inspection of cargo entering and leaving the coun
try. The U.N. resolution also calls for the freezing of assets
of businesses supplying the North's nuclear and ballistic
weapons programs, as well as restrictions on sales of lux
ury goods and travel bans on Pyongyang officials.
South Korea's hesitation to join the ship interception
regime underscored Seoul's reluctance to anger Py
ongyang and complicated efforts to resolve the standoff
over the North's nuclear program now that the commu
nist regime has agreed to return to nuclear disarmament
talks.
Seoul has joined the U.S.-led initiative, aimed largely
at stopping North Korean weapons traffic at sea, only as
an observer out of concern that its stopping and search
ing North Korean ships could lead to armed clashes.
Monitoring North Korean shipping would be much
more difficult without South Korea, because countries in
the initiative can only conduct searches within the terri
torial waters of participating countries. Ships on the high
seas have right of free passage under international law.
rhe South insists it could inspect North Korean ships
under an inter-Korean agreement but it has never done
so despite allowing dozens of the communist country's
vessels to transit its waters.
rhe United States played down South Korea's rejec
tion of the attempts to intercept North Korean ships sus
pected of carrying nuclear supplies, saying Monday the
decision would not harm international efforts to confront
the North's nuclear weapons program.
"I'm not going to sit here and second-guess the South
Koreans.They're valued allies," White House spokesman
Tony Snow told reporters." ITiey have taken some steps
that they'd never taken before with regard to North
Korea. And obviously they're serious partners in the six
party talks."
The two Koreas are still technically at war as the 1950-
53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. But
their relations have warmed since the first, and only, sum
mit of their leaders in 2000.
