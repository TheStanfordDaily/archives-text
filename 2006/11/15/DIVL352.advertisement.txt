Correction
Yesterday's article "Left out in views regarding winter break
the cold at Hammarskjold" incor- housing.The story also incorrectly
rectly attributed quotes to Vice stated that all graduate dorms are
Provost Shirley Everett. In fact, closed over winter break. Some
the statements attributed to her graduate student dorms will in
were made by another unidenti- deed be open over the break and
fied official in her office. The may house some international stu
quotes do not reflect Everett's dents this winter.
