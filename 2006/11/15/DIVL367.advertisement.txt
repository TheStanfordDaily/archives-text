Keeping Talent on the
Road to Success
1
Want to learn what leading-edge companies are doing to recruit and retain talented
employees? Interested in what strategies you can use to get onto the "on-ramp" of
career success while maintaining a vibrant work-life balance?
Join US in a conversation with Sylvia Ann Hewlett and executives from leading
edge companies Booz Allen Hamilton, Cisco Systems, and Intel Corporation who will
discuss the 'hidden brain drain' which refers to the experience of highly qualified
women and minorities who are either leaving the workforce or languishing on the side
lines as their talents are not fully utilized. Panel discussion will focus on emerging
best practices to counter this phenomenon.
Thursday November 16th
6:oopm - 8:oopm
Program starting promptly at 6:oopm
Reception at 7:oopm to 8:00pm
