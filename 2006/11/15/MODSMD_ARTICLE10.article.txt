## Editorial Board Keep up the Rep 
### 
One of the recent creeping trends of
college life is the growth in the num
ber of campus reps. ITiese are stu
dents who are paid to advertise and offer
discounts on the products of major corpora
tions. ITie benefit to the corporations is ob
vious: they build the best kind of publicity
among the best kind of consumer — the
young, hip. highly-visible, soon-to-be
wealthy college student — by word of
mouth, lor their part, the reps receive a
well-paying, low-intensity campus job, with
the possibility of free stuff to boot. But
what, if anything, does the rest of the cam
pus gain?
There's no point in taking a holier-than
thou position on the practice of "Repping."
as it is called. Most Stanford students will
end up working for a corporation at some
point in their lives, so it is understandable
that some would want to sign on for what is
essentially a marketing internship in order
to gain experience. But student reps should
make sure they are earnestly trying to help
their fellow students, rather than trading on
the communal spirit of a University by act
ing like door-to-door solicitors.The Univer
sity should also do a better job of keeping
outside corporate representatives away
from central academic and social areas such
as Tresidder. as well as minimize its own ver
sion of repping at events like football
games.
There are some kinds of campus market
ing that most students would not have a
problem with, such as companies who come
to give away free food or energy drinks.
Other practices are generally harmless but
can leave some students with a bad taste in
their mouths, no pun intended. For some,
the trend of having companies help sponsor
college parties may simply be an added in
centive to show up. while for others, it
makes the party feel more like a cheesy
nightclub than an opportunity for students
to let off steam with their peers.Two recent
examples, without passing judgment on ei
ther. were Sigma Nu's Moonsplash, partly
sponsored by an energy drink company.and
Lambda Phi Epsilon's Lights Out party at
Bob last Friday, at which Pepsi Party Packs
were given out at the door. And then, of
course, there are examples of the downright
nefarious, which usually do not involve stu
dents on the inside. Before Congress start-

Ed cracking down, the online gambling in
dustry would distribute free online chips to
students, or even offer to pay one's tuition
as a prize for winning a tournament.
In terms of student reps, the campus
probably has more than most would think.
Mirrielees has at least two reps for Apple, a
company that relies heavily on the support
of the young and educated. The travel in
dustry' also maintains a high profile on cam
pus with the help of students representing
companies like American Airlines and Jet-
Blue. College spring break, after all. brings
in billions of dollars a year for the industry.
Some of these reps are fairly unobtrusive.
They work quietly, handing out coupons or
sending e-mails about discounts to dorm
lists. On the other hand, some of the more
annoying reps are the ones who come
around the tables outside Tresidder and
Union Square during lunch, interrupting
conversations or quiet reading on the pre
text of a friendly "chat" about such-and
such product. Companies know that stu
dents have a hard time saying," Please leave
me alone" to other students. This is the en
tire point, and the entire problem.
Finally, the University, which often en
gages in repping on a much grander scale
(although they would never call it that),
should be careful not to let advertisers shill
to students at the expense of school spirit.
At the recent football game against USC,
for example, it seemed like the Athletic De
partment was more interested advertising
on the big screen and on the field during
breaks in play, than in getting students to
cheer. Ideally, there should be a balance of
both. After all, the department uses much of
the money it raises to support its teams. But
there is another, more fundamental way to
support the team, and that is getting an en
tire stadium on its feet, raising its collective
voice to a fever pitch. Just to give an exam
ple, one of the supposedly "fun" contests at
the recent home game consisted of getting
fans to raise their Wells Fargo Check Cards
into the air, in the hopes of making it on the
big screen to win a pizza. It was no surprise
that the stadium remained almost dead
silent during this trivial exercise, at a time
when the team could have most used vocal
support. In the end, it was a lucky USC fan
— not even a member of the home crowd
— who won the prize. Figure that.

company that relies heavily on the support
of the young and educated. The travel in
dustry' also maintains a high profile on cam
pus with the help of students representing
companies like American Airlines and Jet-
Blue. College spring break, after all. brings
in billions of dollars a year for the industry.
Some of these reps are fairly unobtrusive.
They work quietly, handing out coupons or
sending e-mails about discounts to dorm
lists. On the other hand, some of the more
annoying reps are the ones who come
around the tables outside Tresidder and
Union Square during lunch, interrupting
conversations or quiet reading on the pre
text of a friendly "chat" about such-and
such product. Companies know that stu
dents have a hard time saying," Please leave
me alone" to other students. This is the en
tire point, and the entire problem.
Finally, the University, which often en
gages in repping on a much grander scale
(although they would never call it that),
should be careful not to let advertisers shill
to students at the expense of school spirit.
At the recent football game against USC,
for example, it seemed like the Athletic De
partment was more interested advertising
on the big screen and on the field during
breaks in play, than in getting students to
cheer. Ideally, there should be a balance of
both. After all, the department uses much of
the money it raises to support its teams. But
there is another, more fundamental way to
support the team, and that is getting an en
tire stadium on its feet, raising its collective
voice to a fever pitch. Just to give an exam
ple, one of the supposedly "fun" contests at
the recent home game consisted of getting
fans to raise their Wells Fargo Check Cards
into the air, in the hopes of making it on the
big screen to win a pizza. It was no surprise
that the stadium remained almost dead
silent during this trivial exercise, at a time
when the team could have most used vocal
support. In the end, it was a lucky USC fan
— not even a member of the home crowd
— who won the prize. Figure that.
