# Reading on the John
## 
### 
Liveright is a 5k run/walk held to raise
awareness of Hepatitis Band liver
cancer.
Gaieties is looking for anyone with or
without acting, singing or dancing experi
ence.
Biversity talks are at nine p.m. on Mon
days at the Women's Center.
Face AIDS presents Dr. Paul Farmer on
Wednesday.
I know all of this not because I am a gay
Asian singer-actress pre-med, but because I
am an active bathroom reader.
I read absolutely everything that appears
on the inside of my bathroom stall — I am
hungry for input while on the john. I have
re-read flyers so many times i can repeat
them verbatim, and even when the date of
the event on the ad comes and goes, 1 leave
the flyer up so that I can continue to review
its contents. I scour each posting, drinking in
every scrap of information and analyzing
each picture.
Really, with all of my flyer reading, I'd
like to think that I have become a bit of a
flyer expert. I have seen so many come and
go that I know exactly what makes a fun,
eye-catching,easy-to-read ad. In fact. I think
that I have started to get a little flyer-cocky
— I have started to judge, with increasing
harshness, which flyers pale in comparison
to their more well-crafted counterparts. I
scoff at the novice flyer-making mistakes.
Are you really going to bring that no-pic
ture half-page flyer into my stall. Women's
Center? Yeah well, we'll see who shows up
to your meeting with that kind of amateur
advertising rubbish.
As I was reading the properly photo-rich
Gaieties auditions flyer for the billionth
time, I tried to understand why I so thor
oughly fine-tooth-combed every scrap of
paper that gets taped to the back of my
bathroom door. I am not sure whether bath
room reading is simply something to do
while you are doing your business, or
whether I subconsciously use flyer-reading
as a point of mental departure, a subtle way
to procrastinate without feeling like I am
slacking, since, after all, I am just going to
the bathroom. Either way. if someone left
their dissertation in the bathroom with a po
lite note asking for comments, I would leave
more detailed notes than their advisor.
Let's do the math. If, on average, it takes
one minute to do your business (for the
ladies, that is. Men, I would guess that it most
likely takes you less time),and the properly
hydrated person uses the porcelain god four

times a day, then that's four minutes a day,
for 365 days, whieh comes out to 24 hours
and 20 minutes a year of solid bathroom
reading. Just imagine what you could do
with a full days time. You could start — and
finish — "War and Peace." You could watch
a full season of 24. You could drive to some
where in the Midwest. And that is notwith
standing those with less than average quan
tities of fiber in their diet.
Bathroom reading is just one result of
the ever-hungry mind questing for visual
input — this thirst for information extends
into many other realms. I can't tell you how
many times I have inexplicably led Jimmy
Cheerio through a maze on the back of a ce
real box. Or browsed through the long list of
donors to the Arts Society in my playbill for
funny-sounding names. I read and answer
all of the on-screen 70's movie trivia that
plays before the trailers at movie theaters as
if it were the SATs. And I've somehow been
compelled to read through the emergency
procedures brochure on the airplane when
some previous passenger snagged my copy
of Sky Mall.
As humans, we are simply cursed with an
analytical brain. When I frustratingly look
again and again at a stupid bathroom stall
flyer.sometimes I can't help but think how I
cannot not be thinking. No matter how
much I want to let my mind be blank — to
take a mental nap — it seems I am always
on a semi-crazed mission to locate material
within my visual field, even in the throes of
a bowel movement. I suppose one could say
that bathroom reading is what separates us
from the apes, really.
Perhaps I should embrace the fact that
my brain is always begging for input, and
start bringing my textbooks into the water
closet with me. After all, it would save me
hours of time. I wonder if the University
would respond to a fix-it request asking for
shelves over the toilet...
