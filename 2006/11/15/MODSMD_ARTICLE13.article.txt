# One stop shopping
## 
### 
As you approach the Milk Pail Market
on 2585 California Street, you sec the
wooden stands of fresh fruits and veg
etables arranged outside. Employees move
about with large boxes, smelling and touch
ing for freshness as they restock the produce.
The customers range from college students
to young couples to grandmothers shopping
for their families. Everyone is absorbed in the
food, pointing, chatting and dropping bags
into their shopping carts.
About a month ago, I was lucky enough to
be checking out while owner Steve Ras
mussen was manning the register. He point
ed to a bottle of Spanish olive oil in my cart.
"I have a better oil for less money."
He led me through the store and poured a
sample from an innocuous looking plastic
bottle labeled simply "California Olive Oil."
It was indeed excellent, deep gold in color
and richly flavored. He explained that they
have the oil specially bottled and delivered to
the store as 1 thankfully replaced the olive oil
in my shopping cart.
This is a place where the ordinary laws of
nature do not apply. It's like the Bermuda Tr
iangle, but instead of ships mysteriously dis
appearing, great food mysteriously becomes
affordable. I suspect they're based on the
same physical principles.

To boot, it's the center in a constellation of
great food locations. Right next door is Bev
erages and More. I've already sung BevMo's
praises in this column, so I'll keep it short.
Huge selection of drinks, both alcoholic and
non-alcoholic, along with a few well-chosen
bar accessories. If you do plan on buying alco
hol here, make sure you and any friends you
bring along have valid IDs.They will check.
If the Milk Pail and BevMo can't satisfy all
your shopping needs, you can fill in the gaps
at the Albertson's next to BevMo or the Safe
way across the street. In terms of prices, selec
tion. and quality, there's not much choosing
between them. Still, for some reason I find
myself crossing the street for Safeway more
often than not. I think the chain owes much
of its success to its name. It just feels so...safe.
If you want to get off the beaten track, the
area also contains a couple ethnic food shops.

Dittmer's, located on 400 San Antonio, just
around the corner from the Milk Pail, is a tra
ditional German butcher shop that produces
all their own meats on the premises. The
prices may he higher than Safeway or Albert
son's. but this is a case where you definitely
get what you pay for. Personally, 1 find
shrink-wrapped meat congealing in a puddle
of its own juices a little off-putting. I love
being able to ask a butcher who's actually in
volved in preparing the meat what's especial
ly good that day. or have him help me with
cooking strategies for a particular meat.
Dittmer's also sells outstanding and afford
able deli sandwiches.
lake California a couple hundred more
yards and you'll find Mercado Marlen, a
Mexican carnicaria (butcher shop) and gro
cery store. Unless if you're fluent in Spanish,
it might be smart to stick to Dittmer's for
meats, since everything's labeled in Spanish
and a lot of the cuts are unfamiliar to Ameri
can shoppers. But for specifically Mexican in
gredients and supplies like chilli powders and
tortilla presses, Marlen's is the place to go.
ITiey also have a taqueria next door where
you can grab a burrito for the road.
