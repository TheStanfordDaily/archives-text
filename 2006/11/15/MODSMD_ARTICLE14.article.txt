# Aaron Sorkin may have a political agenda
## 
### 
You know, I think this character Aaron
Sorkin. writer and producer of the tel
evision series "Studio 60 on the Sunset
Strip" and the canceled airplane show, may
have some kind of political agenda. In be
tween the characters' razor-sharp dialogue
and complicated relationships, 1 believe
there is some subtle commentary on the cur
rent state of our nation. Here, I*ll come out
and say it: Aaron Sorkin should do a show
about the American Government.
I'm not a Hollywood producer, but I think
he has the talent and the passion to do it.
Judging by the subtle discussion of gay mar
riage on the last show, and the constant bick
ering with a Christian cast member on the
show, I'd guess that he's not a Republican. So
maybe, and this is part of the magic of fanta
sy, he could do a show on a Democratic-led
government. Maybe an upper-level congres
sional figure or heck, even the President! He
can call it something really long and esoteric,
like his current show. I'm thinking "Pennsyl
vania Ave" (because that's where the Presi
dent lives and it's more subtle than just say

ing "The White House.") Or possibly "Aaron
Sorkin's caricature of modern government."
For now, let's just call it "Untitled Liberal
Wet Dream."
So in this untitled show, I don't want
Aaron to take too many risks. It would be a
lot to take on the discussion of controversial
topics as racism, homophobia, the religious
right's influence on media and the govern
ment, etc. I wouldn't want him to do it with
actors he's never worked with before.
I le could get some of the current actors to
lay on the next show, and just put them in
suits and call them some fancy administrative
stuff and bam! You've got yourself smart.

(unny actors playing not so-smart, not so
funny real life government types. Sometimes,
tiction is more entertaining than reality. All
he needs is an outspoken liberal actor to play
the government person. Alec Baldwin seems
like a good fit; I wonder if he can be talked
into leaving that other show that is supposed
to be about Saturday Night Live.
Sorkin might be really into this idea. He
seems to like this whole "meta" thing he's got
going on â€” a TV show within a TV show.
Maybe instead of portraying a television
show that s not supposed to be funny about a
television show that's supposed to be funny
but isn t.he can depict gross distortions of the
media s perception of politics on a show that
is itself a gross distortion of the media's per
ception ot politics.That might work.
Hie other real appeal of Sorkin's work is
the snappy dialogue and the complicated rel
ationships that occur on a high-stakes, intel
ligent and controversial television show. A
show about the government would only
