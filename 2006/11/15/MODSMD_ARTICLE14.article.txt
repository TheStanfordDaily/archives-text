# Aaron Sorkin may have a political agenda
## 
### 
You know, I think this character Aaron
Sorkin. writer and producer of the tel
evision series "Studio 60 on the Sunset
Strip" and the canceled airplane show, may
have some kind of political agenda. In be
tween the characters' razor-sharp dialogue
and complicated relationships, 1 believe
there is some subtle commentary on the cur
rent state of our nation. Here, I*ll come out
and say it: Aaron Sorkin should do a show
about the American Government.
I'm not a Hollywood producer, but I think
he has the talent and the passion to do it.
Judging by the subtle discussion of gay mar
riage on the last show, and the constant bick
ering with a Christian cast member on the
show, I'd guess that he's not a Republican. So
maybe, and this is part of the magic of fanta
sy, he could do a show on a Democratic-led
government. Maybe an upper-level congres
sional figure or heck, even the President! He
can call it something really long and esoteric,
like his current show. I'm thinking "Pennsyl
vania Ave" (because that's where the Presi
dent lives and it's more subtle than just say

ing "The White House.") Or possibly "Aaron
Sorkin's caricature of modern government."
For now, let's just call it "Untitled Liberal
Wet Dream."
So in this untitled show, I don't want
Aaron to take too many risks. It would be a
lot to take on the discussion of controversial
topics as racism, homophobia, the religious
right's influence on media and the govern
ment, etc. I wouldn't want him to do it with
actors he's never worked with before.
I le could get some of the current actors to
lay on the next show, and just put them in
suits and call them some fancy administrative
stuff and bam! You've got yourself smart.

(unny actors playing not so-smart, not so
funny real life government types. Sometimes,
tiction is more entertaining than reality. All
he needs is an outspoken liberal actor to play
the government person. Alec Baldwin seems
like a good fit; I wonder if he can be talked
into leaving that other show that is supposed
to be about Saturday Night Live.
Sorkin might be really into this idea. He
seems to like this whole "meta" thing he's got
going on — a TV show within a TV show.
Maybe instead of portraying a television
show that s not supposed to be funny about a
television show that's supposed to be funny
but isn t.he can depict gross distortions of the
media s perception of politics on a show that
is itself a gross distortion of the media's per
ception ot politics.That might work.
Hie other real appeal of Sorkin's work is
the snappy dialogue and the complicated rel
ationships that occur on a high-stakes, intel
ligent and controversial television show. A
show about the government would only

heighten the tension. Imagine what
would happen it somebody was
sleeping with someone of the oppo
site party! That's gotta add some
points to the ratings, li may, howev
er. be a bit much to ask for viewer's
to suspend theii belief and accept a
show hinging on the premise that
high-powered Congressmen and
Executive Branch members, the
leaders <»l the free world have...lots
and lots of sex. Sex in Washington?
()h. its fun to imagine!
Surely, this new government
show would be expensive. Some
people may object that constructing
a model Capital Hill or hiring thou
sands of white balding male extras to
play congressmen would prove ex
pensive. Bui NB(' is already cutting
costs by combining all existing TV
shows with tie Law and Order fran
chise. Law and Order: Office Edi
tion. I aw and Order: Outrageous
Moments. I aw and ()rder: My Name
is I arl. District Attorney. Also, to
save money, they've clearly already
fired all the writers on "Medium."
Anyway, back to Studio 60. Right
now, I think the allusions to politics
are pretty subtle. It would be really
inappropriate it one were to refer
ence a real life event, like this past
week's elections that saw several

states ban gay marriages. It would he
like cramming a wolverine in your
kid's ski hoot. Your kid will get
mauled and need a rabies shot while
the wolverine will suffocate and the
fucking ski boot will stink like some
thing awful. Take this last week's
episode, for example. Upon careful
perusal, I was unable to find any di
rect references to the election this
past week intermingled in the show's
dialogue about sex. relationships,
gay marriage, limousine liberals who
need to be taken down a notch, the
right wing agenda and general intol
erance. 1 never knew Saturday Night
Live was so dramatic. Most of all, I'm
just glad that Aaron Sorkin isn't try
ing to cram his political agenda in a
show that has a great deal of promise
without being heavily laden with
these issues.
So NBC executives, 1 humbly
submit to you my proposal. Ihis
whole "comedy within a comedy"
idea is great, but I really think that
Sorkin character of yours has the be
ginnings of a political agenda.
Maybe you can get him to talk about
it more openly, because honestly, 1
think it is high time that people in
the media weighed in on what they
thought this country should be
doing. Otherwise, how about a show
satirizing Sports Center?

Chris thinks Sorkin should make up
his (Idiim mind about what this sliow is
supposed to he. Send complaints to
