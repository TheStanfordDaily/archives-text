## Hill guides hoops to win in CBE Classic Robin Lopez scores 12 points as Card advance to play Air Force 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
The event was called the College Basketball Experience
Classic, but it \v;is the Cardinal's youth that carried them to a
73-52 win over San Jose State last night.
Sophomore forward I .awrence 1 lill led all scorers with 1 7
points and freshman center Robin Lopez chipped in 12
points, as the Stanford men's basketball team (2-0) advanced
to the second round of the 16-team preseason tournament.
Lopez was a force down low for the second consecutive
game, but was limited to l(i minutes due to foul trouble.The
promising 7-footer finished 4-for-5 from the floor with two
rebounds and two blocks, while going against the Spartans 6-
foot-10 center Menelik Barbary for much of the game.
"Robin Lopez did a real nice job tonight." head coach
Trent Johnson said."We can't expect him to be a world-beat
er every time out. I le adjusts very well to the circumstances
that he is in. I le was frustrated with how tilings went at times,
but we tell him that some things are out of his control. I le has
been really impressive with his maturity."
Lopez helped the Cardinal pull away from the Spartans
early in the second half. Leading by just seven at the break.
Stanford doubled its lead to 14 points less than three minutes
into the half thanks largely to four points by Lopez over that
span.
The Cardinal didn't let up through the half and took their
biggest lead of the evening at 71 -46 when freshman guard
Da'Veed Dildy banked in a three-pointer with 3:19 left in the
game.
"We kept our composure in the second half for the sec
ond straight game." Johnson said. "1 give our guys a lot of
credit."
I lill scored his 17 points on 8-of-12 shooting in 27 minutes.
He was especially strong in the second half, missing just one
of his six shots during the period.
"We went to the fast break a lot toniglit," Hill said."Coach
J really wants us to do that more often than bringing it down
