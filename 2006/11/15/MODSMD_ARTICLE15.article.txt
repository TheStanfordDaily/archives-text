## Hill guides hoops to win in CBE Classic Robin Lopez scores 12 points as Card advance to play Air Force 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
The event was called the College Basketball Experience
Classic, but it \v;is the Cardinal's youth that carried them to a
73-52 win over San Jose State last night.
Sophomore forward I .awrence 1 lill led all scorers with 1 7
points and freshman center Robin Lopez chipped in 12
points, as the Stanford men's basketball team (2-0) advanced
to the second round of the 16-team preseason tournament.
Lopez was a force down low for the second consecutive
game, but was limited to l(i minutes due to foul trouble.The
promising 7-footer finished 4-for-5 from the floor with two
rebounds and two blocks, while going against the Spartans 6-
foot-10 center Menelik Barbary for much of the game.
"Robin Lopez did a real nice job tonight." head coach
Trent Johnson said."We can't expect him to be a world-beat
er every time out. I le adjusts very well to the circumstances
that he is in. I le was frustrated with how tilings went at times,
but we tell him that some things are out of his control. I le has
been really impressive with his maturity."
Lopez helped the Cardinal pull away from the Spartans
early in the second half. Leading by just seven at the break.
Stanford doubled its lead to 14 points less than three minutes
into the half thanks largely to four points by Lopez over that
span.
The Cardinal didn't let up through the half and took their
biggest lead of the evening at 71 -46 when freshman guard
Da'Veed Dildy banked in a three-pointer with 3:19 left in the
game.
"We kept our composure in the second half for the sec
ond straight game." Johnson said. "1 give our guys a lot of
credit."
I lill scored his 17 points on 8-of-12 shooting in 27 minutes.
He was especially strong in the second half, missing just one
of his six shots during the period.
"We went to the fast break a lot toniglit," Hill said."Coach
J really wants us to do that more often than bringing it down

'• } I W'' "SHAMS SHAIKH/The Stanford Daily
Freshman center Robin Lopez couldn't quite match his 1 4 point, 15 rebound, six block performance against Siena
in last night's 73-52 win over San Jose State. He scored 12 points with two rebounds a two blocks in the victory, to
help the Cardinal advance face Air Force tonight at Maples Pavilion.
the court slowly. There were times
tonight when we attacked them
where we should have and exe
cuted well. But there were times
when we got Out too fast and
turned the ball over. We still have
a lot to work on."
Even with Hill and Lopez
playing well on the offensive end,
the game had a much more defen
sive feel than the Cardinal's 92-72
win over Siena on Saturday. Stan
ford forced 16 San Jose State
turnovers and limited the Spar
tans to just 29.6 percent shooting
from the field and 15.4 percent
from three-point range.
"I thought the biggest thing
was Stanford's defensive pressure
and their physicality." San Jose
State coach George Nessman
said. "They just wore us out.
Trent's teams always play that
way. At this point they're a better
basketball team than us. I think
the way Stanford defended
tonight it would have been hard
for us to beat them."
Stanford, however, gave the
Spartans' defense trouble all
night. The Cardinal shot 47.4 per
cent from the field and tallied 16
assists to only 12 turnovers.
Sophomore point guard Mitch
Johnson set a new career-high
with nine assists without commit
ting a turnover.
"1 thought we were good in
spurts and ugly at times," Trent
Johnson said. "The way it works is
one bad turnover leads to another
bad turnover, which leads to an
other bad turnover. But we were
able to regroup. But against good
teams, we can't let that happen."
TTie Cardinal opened the game
with their biggest hot spurt of the
evening,scoring 14 straight points

to take an early 14-3 lead. But
every time Stanford seemed
poised to pull away in the first
half, San Jose State closed the gap.
The Spartans stayed competi
tive through the first twenty min
utes behind eight points from
Jamon Hill in the period. He fin
ished the game as San Jose State's
leading scorer with 12 points.
With the win. the Cardinal ad
vance to the championship of the
Palo Alto Regional where they
will face Air Force (2-0). The Fal
cons beat Long Beach State 69-68
to move on to the championship
game.
Air Force qualified for the
NCAA Tournament last season
and finished the campaign with
the stingiest defense in Division 1-
A.
"From what I've seen of Air
Force, I'm impressed with the skill
that they have at all five posi
tions," Coach Johnson said. "They
can cause problems because all
five spots can shoot from the
perimeter. The bottom line is that
they are a well-coached, tough,
hard-nose team. They are proba
bly a top 25-caliber team."
The winner of tomorrow's
matchup w ill advance to the semi
finals in Kansas City, Mo. where
they will face No. 11 Duke. The
Blue Devils won the Durham Re
gional with a 72-48 victory over
Georgia Southern on Monday.
Texas Tech and Marquette have
also already earned spots in the
semifinals.
