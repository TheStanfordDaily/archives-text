## Men's novice team earns four medals at Head of the Lagoon 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In a sign that bodes well for the upcoming spring
schedule, Stanford's crews —at least those that
were able to compete — posted strong finishes in
their final fall races.
The men's novice team swept through Foster
City's Head of the Lagoon on Sunday, picking up
three gold medals — in the freshman eight and four
as well as the open four — and took silver in the
freshman four.
The women and the rest of the men's team got an
unexpected week off when the Head of the Lake
Regatta in which they were scheduled to compete
was cancelled due to severe weather in the Seattle
area. The storms have brought rain and snow to
Washington and Sunday's strong winds made the
conditions too dangerous to row.
The 1 lead of the Lake is the largest fall regatta in
the western United States and has never before
been cancelled in its 25-year history.
Meanwhile, the lightweight women were com
peting in the Newport Autumn Rowing Festival,
held in southern California. In the women's open
eight race, the Cardinal finished fourth overall and
more than a minute ahead of Cal, the next fastest
lightweight crew in the race. Stanford also compet
ed in the freshman/novice eight and claimed sev
enth place.
The lightweight women will be back in Uction
March 10 at the Sacramento Invitational while the
men and women will kick off their spring season
March 31 at the San Diego Crew Classic.
