## Gardner must carry a big load 125-pound junior shooting for a national championship after All American season 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
In a Stanford wrestling program that seems to be on the rise. 125-
pound junior Tanner Gardner has come closer than any of his team
mates to the pinnacle of collegiate achievement in his sport. A re
turning captain and All-American.Gardner has already been a force
for the Cardinal in the 2006 season, and is undefeated through seven
matches thus far.
Gardner has set his sights higher than ever this year, but returns
for his junior campaign with the new knowledge that his aims are
within reach.
"It's pretty obvious that my goal this year is a national champi
onship." Gardner said. "I might have set my goal there |List season],
but I still had that doubt whether I could do it. But I think last vear

proved that I have that ability to
make the national finals and be a na
tional champion."
Gardner's accomplishments last
season were even more significant in
the context of Cardinal wrestling.

prowess has already begun to pay off beyond his individual accom
plishments.
"We use him as kind of a recruiting tool," coach Kerry McCoy
said. "We go out there and tell guys they'll have an All-American in

been named one of the team's capitains and is hoping to build on last year's performance.
the room to work out with for at least
a year — this year's freshman class
will have him for two — and that's
really a big draw. When you can say
that, it makes a big difference."
McCoy also touted Gardner's im
pact as a captain, instilling his own
toughness and dedication in his
teammates.
"He leads by example in that he's

working hard and doing all these
things, but he also brings guys along
and helps in that aspect," McCoy
said. "And he's also one of the first
ones to be yelling at guys to push
harder. He's just the total package of
a leader."
Gardner's leadership role may be
especially important this year. Most of
the wrestlers he competes against in
practice are underclassmen, some of
whom — like true freshman Cameron
Teitelman and redshirt freshman Matt
Kim — are entering their first year of
collegiate competition.
"I kind of take it upon myself to

help those guys out whether it's in
wrestling, school or just any part of
life in general." Gardner said. "1
think my success is a reflection of
them and I would hope that their
success is a reflection of me as well.
I'd like to think we make each other
better."
McCoy and Gardner each singled
out the the junior All-American's
work ethic as the key to his success
both this year and in the past, espe
cially in his willingness to work on his
own time.
"Anybody can come to practice
and do what's required," Gardner

said, "But 1 think that to get to the
next level you really have to put in
the extra time, do the extra workouts
and watch the extra video tape. And
I think it's paid off so far this year. I
haven't really wrestled any high-cal
iber opponents per se yet, but I think
these first couple weekends have
been great in preparing me for the
next couple of weekends which are
going to be some good tests for me."
This weekend, the team will face
its first Pacific-10 Conference com
petition in Fullerton, Calif., in a dual
meet against the Titans and later at
the Fullerton Open, where one of

Gardner's toughest opponents will
likely compete. Cal Poly junior Chad
Mendes,who finished sixth in the na
tion last year and has posed a diffi
cult challenge for Gardner in the
past, is scheduled to compete at the
Fullerton Open.
"[Mendes] has beaten me every
time we've wrestled so far. but 1
think it's just a matter of making the
adjustments that are going to be nec
essary to beat him," Gardner said.
"We're going to watch video tape
and work on a couple of his tenden
cies that he has that I'm going to
need to overcome to beat him. It's re

ally just about focusing on the
specifics at this point."
As far as the team goes, Gardner
is optimistic about their chances this
season.
"I'll tell you what, 1 think this is
the best lineup we've had since I've
been here," Gardner said. "From top
to bottom I think we're really tough,
but also really young at the same
time. Nobody expects us to, but I
think we have the potential to win a
Pac-10 title. It's a matter of guys put
ting in the time, working hard, and
also things falling into place at the
right time."
