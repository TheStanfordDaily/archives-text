# Julia Smit Spotlight
## INTANTIMPACT Freshman Smit has already earned three individual NCAA 'A' times in helping Cardinal to big early wins 
### SARA NORMINGTON 
Since the first time she dove in the water at the
Avery Aquatic Center, freshman Julia Smit has
shown she is ready to do big things for the Stan
ford women's swim team.
After her two victories in the Cardinal's season opener
against San Jose State and Oregon State, Smit has posted
five additional first-place finishes and achieved NCAA 'A'
times, automatically qualifying her for the NCAA Cham
pionships, in three separate events.
"I'm really excited about being this successful," Smit,
one of 12 freshmen on the Cardinal's roster, said.
Swimming success is nothing new for Smit, who has
been swimming since she was seven, and began to get seri
ous about the sport three years later.
"When I was ten, I stopped doing other activities and
started to really focus on swimming," she said.
While swimming for Mount Sinai High School in
Mount Sinai. N.Y., Smit was named the Most Outstanding
Swimmer at the state meet in three consecutive years. In
the spring, she won the 200-yard backstroke at the 2006
Spring Nationals, and in the fall, she was named to the Pan
American Games squad.
This past January, Smit was featured in the Faces in the
Crowd section of Sports Illustrated for the 2005 Year In
Sports retrospective issue.

In addition to this recognition for her athletic accom
plishments, she was also named a member of USA Swim
ming's Scholastic All-American team in 2006.
Smit credits her early accomplishments at Stanford to
the team chemistry, noting that the coaches and other
swimmers create a positive and encouraging atmosphere
to swim in.
"There is a much bigger team environment in college
swimming than for my club team," Smit said."lt is more fun
to compete when you are focusing on team results instead
of just individual swims."
Even so, Smit seems to have been concentrating plenty
on her individual events. She already has NCAA TV times
in the 200-yard and 400-yard individual medleys and the
200 back. Smit was especially enthusiastic about her 400
IM at Tennessee last weekend, where she swam the event
in 4:10.09.
"The 400 was a really exciting race for me because that's
the fastest I've swam that event and it was an 'A time," Smit
said.
Smit has also been an important contributor to Stan
ford's team successes. This past weekend, she swam on
both of the Cardinal's winning medley relay teams, clock -

ing in a 54.90'8' time in her 100

back split in the 400 medley.
Even with so much early
success, Smit knows the d
NCAA championships in
March are a long way away
and she still has work to do. |
"I want to continue to im
prove on all of my times, and \
I would really like to get an 'A'
time in the 100 back," she said.
Smit is optimistic that the

training environment at Stan-

ford will push her to achieve her
goals. She is enthusiastic about
the Cardinal coaching staff and

especially her teammates, a group
that includes nine All-Americans
and two swimmers on national
team rosters.

"The upperclassmen help me so

much," she said. "They push me to
swim faster in practice and help me
with my stroke and turn technique."
This year, it looks as though the
Stanford women are primed for
another top-five finish at the

NCAA championships. The Cardi
nal finished fifth last year and has
not ended the season lower than
sixth in 25 years of NCAA compe
tition.
"1 think the team will just contin
ue to get better throughout the sea
son," Smit said.
Smit and the Cardinal will com
pete once more, at the Texas Invita
tional beginning Nov. 30, before a
month-long break for the holidays.
