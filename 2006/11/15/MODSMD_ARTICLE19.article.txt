CHARLOTTESVILLE. Va. —
A man who sexually assaulted a fel
low student at a fraternity party in
1984. then apologized to her two
decades later as part of the 12-step
Alcoholics Anonymous program,
pleaded guilty Tuesday and could go
to prison.
William Beebe calmly entered a
plea to aggravated sexual battery as
his victim. Liz Seccuro, bowed her
head and wiped away tears.
"Twenty-two years ago I harmed
another person, and I have tried to
set that right," the real estate agent
and former University of Virginia
student said outside court.
Under the plea bargain, prosecu
tors asked that Beebe get two years in
prison when he is sentenced in March.

Prosecutor Claude Worrell said
authorities agreed to the deal in part
because the investigation revealed
that more than one person may have
sexually assaulted Seccuro at the Phi
Kappa Psi party. Beebe agreed toco
operate with the investigation into
exactly what happened to Seccuro
that night.
"We believe that the matter does
n't end here." Worrell said in court.
Beebe, 41, of Las Vegas, had been
awaiting trial later this month on
charges of rape and object sexual
penetration and could have gotten
life in prison if convicted.
The ninth step in A As 12-step re
covery program calls on alcoholics to
make amends to those they have
harmed. Last year. Beebe wrote Sec
curo a letter of apology, and an ex
change of e-mails ensued, in which
he wrote: "I want to make clear that
I'm not intentionally minimizing the
fact of having raped you. I did."
In December, Seccuro called
Charlottesville police to report what
had happened. Beebe was arrested
in Las Vegas.
It was unclear whether Beebe

knew he could still be prosecuted for
the crime in Virginia, which has no
statute of limitations on felonies.
Beebe and his attorney refused to
answer questions outside court.
Seccuro, now 39 and living in
Greenwich, Conn., said she was
given a drink at the party that made
her feel strange. She said she vividly
recalls being assaulted by Beebe and
passing out that night. She reported
the assault to university officials but
said a dean and the campus police
treated her dismissively, and the case
was never prosecuted. After a few
years, she said, she gave up.
When Beebe's letter arrived in
September 2005, Seccuro said it
opened old wounds, but she eventu
ally replied.
In their e-mails, which Seccuro
provided to The Associated Press,
Beebe said he had long been haunt
ed by what he had done, and wanted
to atone for it.
But Seccuro became upset when
his account did not match her mem
ory of the assault, which she de
scribes as savage. She was 17 and a
virgin, she said.
After his arrest, Beebe initially
claimed he was innocent. His attor
ney. Rhonda Quagliana, said Beebe
had simply wanted to apologize to
Seccuro for treating her "thought
lessly in a college sex encounter."
During his court appearance
Tuesday, Beebe glanced at Seccuro
often, his expression almost serene.
Seccuro — flanked by her husband
and former sorority sisters — stared
straight ahead, avoiding his gaze.
"This began as an effort to make
amends," Beebe said outside court.
"In pleading guilty today to a lesser
charge, I acknowledge formally what
I tried to acknowledge in my letter."
Seccuro went public with her name
and story, hoping to lead other sexu
al assault survivors to seek help. She
launched STARS — Sisters Togeth
er Assisting Rape Survivors —to
raise money to help rape victims and
their families.
"I think that the idea of closure for
any victim of a sexual assault is not
reality," Seccuro said tearfully out
side court. "There is never closure."
Beebe will remain free on bail
until his sentencing.
