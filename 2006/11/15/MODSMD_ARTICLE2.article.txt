# PUBLIC POLICY NOW UP TO PAR
## Two new master's programs fill void in interdisciplinary master's degrees, students question programs potential 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Harvard has the Kennedy
School of Government and Prince
ton has its Woodrow Wilson School,
but Stanford lacks a graduate de
gree-granting public policy pro
gram. A proposal to add one is in
the works. But while the proposed
program has garnered support
among faculty and administration,
some students say that the lack of a
dedicated faculty and restrictions
on enrollment could be problemat
ic.
Last week, the Committee on
Graduate Studies approved an in
terdisciplinary program that would,
if also sanctioned by the Faculty
Senate, add two new graduate de
grees â€” a two-year Master in Pub
lic Policy (MPP) and a one-year
Master of Arts in Public Policy
(MAPP).
"It's an opportunity for the stu
dents here to get a more diverse ed
ucation." said Public Policy Direc
tor Bruce Owen, who has been
working on instituting such a pro
gram at the graduate level for over
a year.
However, unlike programs at
Harvard. Princeton, the University
of Chicago or Berkeley, the Stan
ford proposal would not establish a
separate school or department for
public policy. Like its undergradu
ate counterpart, the graduate pro
gram would depend on faculty from
other departments like political sci
ence and economics.

"We are doing it this way be
cause having a separate school is a
much more difficult and complicat
ed process than establishing a pro
gram," Owen said. He added that
last year's report from the Commis
sion on Graduate Education "rec
ommended that we increase the
University's attentions to interdis
ciplinary programs."
But some students say that the
interdisciplinary approach risks
making Stanford's program less
competitive.
"Students with an interest in
public policy want to attend the
Kennedy School at Harvard be
cause it offers dedicated faculty
who are experts in the field," said
public policy major Michael Lazar,
a senior. "Without the funding to
support its own faculty and its own
courses, the MPP program will suf
fer from the same problems that the
undergraduate program does:
mainly, inconsistencies in course of
ferings, changes in scheduling and
unstable quality of teaching," he
added.
Senior Olivia Puerta agreed.
"Because Public Policy does not
have its own faculty, there are
sometimes issues with scheduling
classes," said Puerta, who is also a
public policy major.
Depending on other depart
ments' faculty is not the only differ
ence that would set Stanford's
graduate program apart. According
