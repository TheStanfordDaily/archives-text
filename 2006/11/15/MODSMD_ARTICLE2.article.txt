# PUBLIC POLICY NOW UP TO PAR
## Two new master's programs fill void in interdisciplinary master's degrees, students question programs potential 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Harvard has the Kennedy
School of Government and Prince
ton has its Woodrow Wilson School,
but Stanford lacks a graduate de
gree-granting public policy pro
gram. A proposal to add one is in
the works. But while the proposed
program has garnered support
among faculty and administration,
some students say that the lack of a
dedicated faculty and restrictions
on enrollment could be problemat
ic.
Last week, the Committee on
Graduate Studies approved an in
terdisciplinary program that would,
if also sanctioned by the Faculty
Senate, add two new graduate de
grees — a two-year Master in Pub
lic Policy (MPP) and a one-year
Master of Arts in Public Policy
(MAPP).
"It's an opportunity for the stu
dents here to get a more diverse ed
ucation." said Public Policy Direc
tor Bruce Owen, who has been
working on instituting such a pro
gram at the graduate level for over
a year.
However, unlike programs at
Harvard. Princeton, the University
of Chicago or Berkeley, the Stan
ford proposal would not establish a
separate school or department for
public policy. Like its undergradu
ate counterpart, the graduate pro
gram would depend on faculty from
other departments like political sci
ence and economics.

"We are doing it this way be
cause having a separate school is a
much more difficult and complicat
ed process than establishing a pro
gram," Owen said. He added that
last year's report from the Commis
sion on Graduate Education "rec
ommended that we increase the
University's attentions to interdis
ciplinary programs."
But some students say that the
interdisciplinary approach risks
making Stanford's program less
competitive.
"Students with an interest in
public policy want to attend the
Kennedy School at Harvard be
cause it offers dedicated faculty
who are experts in the field," said
public policy major Michael Lazar,
a senior. "Without the funding to
support its own faculty and its own
courses, the MPP program will suf
fer from the same problems that the
undergraduate program does:
mainly, inconsistencies in course of
ferings, changes in scheduling and
unstable quality of teaching," he
added.
Senior Olivia Puerta agreed.
"Because Public Policy does not
have its own faculty, there are
sometimes issues with scheduling
classes," said Puerta, who is also a
public policy major.
Depending on other depart
ments' faculty is not the only differ
ence that would set Stanford's
graduate program apart. According
to a copy of the proposal obtained
by The Daily, the new program will not
initially have outside admissions. Only
graduate students already accepted to
other departments or schools at the
University will be able to work to
wards the graduate public policy de
grees, and there will not be a co-termi
nal option for undergraduates.
"A program like this is complicat
ed. and the first few years can pro
duce a lot of information that can
change the structure of the program,"
Owen said. "And it seems smart to
start in this relatively easy way."
Owen added that a co-terminal
program may be added in a few
years, with outside admissions fol
lowing later. Though there is no firm
timeline on these additions, "a lot of
people would like that to happen," he
said.
Meanwhile, some students criti
cized the restrictions on enrollment
and expressed hope that additions
would be made sooner rather than
later.
"While limiting the program to
existing graduate students appears to
provide a trial and error period, I do
not see many students choosing to
pick up this additional degree,"
Lazar said. "I think a better system
would be to offer it as a co-terminal
option for current public policy un
dergrade who 1 know would be will
ing to stick around for an extra year
to attain the master's degree."
Junior Mishan Araujo, a public
policy major, agreed, adding that she
would co-term if she could.
"I plan on pursuing a master's in
public policy after I graduate, and
had there been a program at Stan
ford I would consider applying for
it," she said.
Students interested in the two-year
MPP degree would be able to work to
ward it in two ways. They could com
plete a joint-degree program in con
junction with another school or de

partment, or they could acquire a
stand-alone MPP if their home de
partment does not offer a joint-degree
program with public policy.
The MAPP program is open to all
students but is not generally regarded
as a professional degree. According
to the written proposal submitted to
the committee, this program is mod
eled on a similar one at the Harris
School at the University of Chicago.
ITie finer details of the program
are not set in stone. When the Com
mittee on Graduate Studies ap
proved the proposal, it did so with
two caveats. It asked for the advising
process to be clarified and for a the
sis requirement to be added to the
MAPP program. In addition, the Fac
ulty Senate could request changes
before giving the program its final
green light.
Some students said that those in
charge of the proposal should also
have looked to students for input.
"It's unfortunate that current un
dergraduates were not consulted
while designing the program, as we
would have provided guidance from
a student's perspective that they
seemed to ignore," Lazar said.
Other than the two changes asked
for by the committee, the proposal
has not faced much resistance from
the administration.
"So far. no one has raised any se
rious objections," Owen said.
In fact, support for the proposal
has come from a range of University
faculty members, including Law
School Dean Larry Kramer.
"It could well amount to the best
public policy program in the coun
try," Kramer said.
The proposal will next be consid
ered by the Steering Committee of
the Faculty Senate, before being pre
sented to the full Faculty Senate for
final approval. Owen said he hopes
to have the program on the agenda
for the Senate's first winter quarter
meeting, which is set for Jan. 25.
If approved by the Faculty Senate
this winter, students could enroll in
the two programs as early as next
September.

working on instituting such a pro
gram at the graduate level for over
a year.
However, unlike programs at
Harvard. Princeton, the University
of Chicago or Berkeley, the Stan
ford proposal would not establish a
separate school or department for
public policy. Like its undergradu
ate counterpart, the graduate pro
gram would depend on faculty from
other departments like political sci
ence and economics.

"We are doing it this way be
cause having a separate school is a
much more difficult and complicat
ed process than establishing a pro
gram," Owen said. He added that
last year's report from the Commis
sion on Graduate Education "rec
ommended that we increase the
University's attentions to interdis
ciplinary programs."
But some students say that the
interdisciplinary approach risks
making Stanford's program less
competitive.
"Students with an interest in
public policy want to attend the
Kennedy School at Harvard be
cause it offers dedicated faculty
who are experts in the field," said
public policy major Michael Lazar,
a senior. "Without the funding to
support its own faculty and its own
courses, the MPP program will suf
fer from the same problems that the
undergraduate program does:
mainly, inconsistencies in course of
ferings, changes in scheduling and
unstable quality of teaching," he
added.
Senior Olivia Puerta agreed.
"Because Public Policy does not
have its own faculty, there are
sometimes issues with scheduling
classes," said Puerta, who is also a
public policy major.
Depending on other depart
ments' faculty is not the only differ
ence that would set Stanford's
graduate program apart. According
to a copy of the proposal obtained
by The Daily, the new program will not
initially have outside admissions. Only
graduate students already accepted to
other departments or schools at the
University will be able to work to
wards the graduate public policy de
grees, and there will not be a co-termi
nal option for undergraduates.
"A program like this is complicat
ed. and the first few years can pro
duce a lot of information that can
change the structure of the program,"
Owen said. "And it seems smart to
start in this relatively easy way."
Owen added that a co-terminal
program may be added in a few
years, with outside admissions fol
lowing later. Though there is no firm
timeline on these additions, "a lot of
people would like that to happen," he
said.
Meanwhile, some students criti
cized the restrictions on enrollment
and expressed hope that additions
would be made sooner rather than
later.
"While limiting the program to
existing graduate students appears to
provide a trial and error period, I do
not see many students choosing to
pick up this additional degree,"
Lazar said. "I think a better system
would be to offer it as a co-terminal
option for current public policy un
dergrade who 1 know would be will
ing to stick around for an extra year
to attain the master's degree."
Junior Mishan Araujo, a public
policy major, agreed, adding that she
would co-term if she could.
"I plan on pursuing a master's in
public policy after I graduate, and
had there been a program at Stan
ford I would consider applying for
it," she said.
Students interested in the two-year
MPP degree would be able to work to
ward it in two ways. They could com
plete a joint-degree program in con
junction with another school or de

partment, or they could acquire a
stand-alone MPP if their home de
partment does not offer a joint-degree
program with public policy.
The MAPP program is open to all
students but is not generally regarded
as a professional degree. According
to the written proposal submitted to
the committee, this program is mod
eled on a similar one at the Harris
School at the University of Chicago.
ITie finer details of the program
are not set in stone. When the Com
mittee on Graduate Studies ap
proved the proposal, it did so with
two caveats. It asked for the advising
process to be clarified and for a the
sis requirement to be added to the
MAPP program. In addition, the Fac
ulty Senate could request changes
before giving the program its final
green light.
Some students said that those in
charge of the proposal should also
have looked to students for input.
"It's unfortunate that current un
dergraduates were not consulted
while designing the program, as we
would have provided guidance from
a student's perspective that they
seemed to ignore," Lazar said.
Other than the two changes asked
for by the committee, the proposal
has not faced much resistance from
the administration.
"So far. no one has raised any se
rious objections," Owen said.
In fact, support for the proposal
has come from a range of University
faculty members, including Law
School Dean Larry Kramer.
"It could well amount to the best
public policy program in the coun
try," Kramer said.
The proposal will next be consid
ered by the Steering Committee of
the Faculty Senate, before being pre
sented to the full Faculty Senate for
final approval. Owen said he hopes
to have the program on the agenda
for the Senate's first winter quarter
meeting, which is set for Jan. 25.
If approved by the Faculty Senate
this winter, students could enroll in
the two programs as early as next
September.
Harvard has the Kennedy
School of Government and Prince
ton has its Woodrow Wilson School,
but Stanford lacks a graduate de
gree-granting public policy pro
gram. A proposal to add one is in
the works. But while the proposed
program has garnered support
among faculty and administration,
some students say that the lack of a
dedicated faculty and restrictions
on enrollment could be problemat
ic.
Last week, the Committee on
Graduate Studies approved an in
terdisciplinary program that would,
if also sanctioned by the Faculty
Senate, add two new graduate de
grees — a two-year Master in Pub
lic Policy (MPP) and a one-year
Master of Arts in Public Policy
(MAPP).
"It's an opportunity for the stu
dents here to get a more diverse ed
ucation." said Public Policy Direc
