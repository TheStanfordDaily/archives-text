## A 						big test for a weakened Bush President embarks on globetrot, bargaining position undermined 
### TOM RAUM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON—HumbIed by elections at
home. President Bush is heading into talks with
leaders in Asia and Europe who will be watching
for signs of weakness, uncertainty or retrenchment.
Bush's challenge is to demonstrate that U.S.
leadership as the world's last superpower is undi
minished on the world stage.
"I think he will go vigorous, I think he'll give a
powerful performance," said Kurt Campbell, a top
Pentagon official in the Clinton administration
who now is with the Center for Strategic and Inter
national Studies.
Some world leaders, particularly those who re
sented Bush's cowboy swagger and saw his deci
sion to invade Iraq in 2(H)3 as a dangerous act of
unilateralism, might be gloating privately at the
president's political misfortunes.
But the United States does not have a parlia
mentary system, and Bush will remain president
for two more years. And other world leaders have
been challenged at home, too, especially Iraq ally
Tony Blair of Britain and war opponent Jacques
Chirac of France, both of whom could commiser

ate with Bush.
The Democratic capture last week of both the
I louse and the Senate on a tide of voter anger over
Iraq diminished the presidents authority at home.
That's resulted in "an interesting period here in
Washington," Bush told visiting Israeli Prime Min
ister Ehud Olmert this week. "You might realize
the opposition party won, won the Senate and the
House. And. what's interesting, is that they're be
ginning to understand that with victory comes re
sponsibilities."
On the world stage. Bush's misfortunes could
marginally embolden Chinese President Hu Jin
tao and Russian President Vladimir Putin. But.
otherwise, it seems unlikely that geopolitical dy
namics will be much changed.
"He acknowledges that he took a thumping.
But leaders around the world take thumpings all
the time," said presidential historian Thomas E.
C'ronin of Colorado College. The election results
also telegraphs to the rest of the world, "including
Iraq and Russia, that we can have peaceful elec
tions that alter the makeup of our national govern
ment." Cronin said.
Bush left Tuesday night for an eight-day tour of
Asia, including stops in Singapore, Indonesia and
Vietnam, where he attends a summit of Asian-Pa
cific nation leaders. At month's end. Bush will
travel to the Baltic Sea countries of Latvia and Es
tonia, once claimed by the Soviet Union, for a
NATO summit in Riga. Latvia.

It will be Bush's first trip to Vietnam. During
the Vietnam War, he served in the U.S. in the Texas
Air National Guard. Now. with the Iraq war drag
ging on for 3 1/2 years and the US. death toll still
rising, many of Bush's critics are comparing Iraq to
the Vietnamese quagmire.
Bush's plan to arrive in Hanoi with a new pact
normalizing trade with Vietnam hit an unexpected
obstacle when the lame-duck GOP-controlled
House failed to approve the measure on Monday.
Its Republican sponsors had hoped to use another
strategy to move the bill forward this week, but
they put off the effort on Tuesday. It was an embar
rassing setback as the president set out on his first
postelection overseas trip.
He told a group of U.S. auto executives in the
Oval Office on Tuesday that he would deliver this
message to trading partners: "Just treat us the way
we treat you. Our markets are open for your prod
ucts. and we expect your markets to be open for
ours, including our automobiles."
Even before the elections, some of the go-it
alone tactics of Bush's first term had already been
replaced by great diplomacy, including U.S. efforts
to rely on other countries to defuse nuclear ten
sions with North Korea and Iran.
"Some of the people who used to criticize us for
unilateralism are now beginning to criticize us for
not taking more decisive individual action." said
Stephen Hadley, the president's national security
adviser.
