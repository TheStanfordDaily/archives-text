### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER

ficials puzzled over the blaze's cause.
A student first noticed the fire around
4 a.m. and notified his Resident Assistant
(RA).who then called police. Within min
utes, three fire engines, a utility truck, a

rescue truck and paramedics—lB per
sonnel in all — arrived on the scene and
quickly extinguished the fire, according to
a Palo Alto Fire Department captain who
was at the site. The blaze destroyed the
SEIU Local 715 office, which is housed at
the Eating Clubs and represents 1.000
University service, maintenance and tech
nical employees. ITie main electrical hub
was also incinerated, shutting off electric
ity, gas. telephone and Internet services to
the complex. There were no reported in
juries.
While the fire captain, who declined to
give his name, said the fire was small by
his standards, he added that the damage
was still rather extensive.

"The fire itself destroyed every
thing that was inside the room." he
said.
Firefighters stripped the sheet
rock off the ceiling and most of the
wall to make sure the fire had not
spread, the captain added. I lowever,
he said that the cause of the fire was
still undetermined.
"We tried to do preliminary in
vestigation. but we couldn't deter
mine what started it."he added.
"There was a space heater in the
room, hut we couldn't say conclu
sively whether that was the cause."
After being notified by his stu
dent, the RA contacted police,eating
club managers and housing repre
sentatives, who all arrived on the
scene between 4:15 and 4:30 a.m.
Nick Peters, director of Student Or
ganized Services, which is a division
of the Stanford Eating Clubs, hailed
the rapid response as a "a great coor
dination effort."
Although Eating Clubs General
Manager Zac Sargent said it was "a
long wait for everything to get back

up and running," the gas line for
ovens was repaired by 9:45 a.m., and
electricity and telephone services
were resumed around 10:15 a.m. Be
cause kitchen refrigerators were
closed, Hating Club staff said the
food should be safe.
Gina Pak. assistant general man
ager of the Eating Clubs, notified

Toyon residents by email, but they
were otherwise unaffected by the
fire. Meal service to the students was
not interrupted.
"I wouldn't even have known
about the fire if not for the email,"
said sophomore Molly Weiss.
Peters said Tuesday night that
everything was back to normal and

that the Internet should be working
by Wednesday morning.
Despite the destruction. Sargent
was upbeat.
"It was a pretty simple fire, in an
area that no one was in, early in the
morning," Sargent said. "So if it had
to happen, realistically this was the
best of all worlds."
