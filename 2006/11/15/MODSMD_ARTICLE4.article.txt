## For first graders, geology not just a rocky road Environmental Sciences Professor brings Palo Alto students to Stanford 
### LIA HARDIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The GeoKids outreach program, founded by Geologi
cal and Environmental Sciences Professor Adina Paytan.
has two goals: exposing kids to scientists and making scien
tists teachers.
Paytan was inspired to start the GeoKids program when
she tried to organize a field trip for her daughter's first
grade class after learning that the science curriculum fo
cused on geology. When the elementary school insisted on
sending four classes instead of one, Paytan and her gradu
ate students brainstormed ideas and came up with a syl
labus for the program.
GeoKids now holds 15 sessions a year for first-grade sci
ence classes from the Palo Alto Unified School District,
with the next meeting taking place this Friday morning. In
a two-hour field trip involving four rotating lab stations,
students will sample four geological fields: soils, rocks, fos
sils and minerals.
Jennifer Saltzman. outreach coordinator for the School
of Earth Sciences, said that the program has been success
ful because it effectively communicates the "excitement of
science" to the first-graders.
"They are able to talk with graduate and undergraduate
students and they get to touch real samples that they might
not get to see in their own class
rooms," she said. "They are learning
that there are more resources to help
them study science."
She noted that Paytan has been
instrumental in inspiring the devel
opment of the outreach program,
which now also includes a high
school internship program and
teacher training.

"[GeoKids] was my little project
and it became a school initiative,"
Paytan said.
An added benefit, she said, is
that the program gives Stanford
students — future professionals in
the earth sciences — critical teach
ing and outreach experience. Each
GeoKids instructor leads a group of
twenty students for twentv minutes.

Saltzman and Paytan both em
phasized that the program is an im
portant way for the School of Earth
Sciences to interact with the com
munity in a way that also benefits
the school.
"We are letting our community
know through the parents of these
first graders that [Stanford has] an
earth sciences school," said Saltz

man, who also encourages under
graduates to volunteer.
"We want to provide Stanford
students with a way to teach and
GeoKids provides them with that
opportunity," she added. "We give
the kids a chance to learn about ge
ology in a way that they don't have
in their schools or in their own
homes."

GeoKids program brings 15 classes to the University each academic year in collaboration with the School of Earth Sciences.
