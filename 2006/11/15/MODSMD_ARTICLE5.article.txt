## Alumna makes call for public service Susan E. Rice reflects on life at Stanford and beyond 
### JANET KIM STAFF WRITER 
The United States has both a pragmatic and moral
obligation to help eradicate transnational problems
like poverty Stanford alumna Susan E. Rice,'B6, ar
gued at a lecture in Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Rice's lecture, entitled "Public Service in the Na

tional and Global Interest: A Call for New Leader
ship to Meet Twenty-First Century Challenges," was
presented by the Call to Serve Initiatives recently in
augurated program to familiarize more students with
the opportunities available in public service. Rice
opened the lecture with a discussion of how she, a
Rhodes Scholar who harbored senatorial ambitions
during her time at Stanford, became interested in in
ternational affairs and changed her career path to be
come an expert in international relations. She served
the Clinton White I louse as a staffer for the National

Alumna Susan E. Rice, Class of 1 986, speaks about public service in Cubberley Auditorium on Tuesday
night. The talk focused on new prospects for American foreign policy.
Security Council, and she eventually
served as the assistant secretary of
state for African Affairs under
Madeleine Albright.
The biographical segment was
variously tender and witty. Rice reas
sured Stanford students that not even
the current football season "could
compare to Big Game my freshman
year," in which The Play gave the win
to Cal. She also described coming
back to Stanford as "a sensory expe
rience in so many ways — you get the
aroma from the eucalyptus trees, the
flight instinct triggered by terrorists
on bicycles and the übiquitous sense
of the possible.
"1 know it's hard to appreciate
when you're still here, but I just
marked my twentieth reunion, and 1
can say with confidence that it really
doesn't get better than this," she re
marked. "Enjoy it while it lasts."
Rice, who is currently a Senior
Fellow at the Brookings Institution,
went on to deliver a scathing criticism
of U.S. foreign policy in the status
quo, noting the importance of
"changing the tone and nature of U.S.
leadership."
Citing unconstitutional deten

tions of suspected terrorists at Guan
tanamo Bay and the killing of Iraqi
civilians as examples. Rice contended
that the United States is eroding its
moral leadership by hypocritically
rejecting its own principles, and that
it must win back its authority by ex
tending aid and support to its poten
tial allies.
"If we want others to work with us
to counter the gravest threats we
face, then we have to be serious about
putting resources behind helping to
eliminate the threats that are most
proximate to other people," she said.
Rice saw this need for interna
tional cooperation as arising partly
from the transnational nature of se
curity threats in the twenty-first cen
tury.
"The current risks to United
States national security extend be
yond the handful that are state
based," she said. "Terrorism,
weapons proliferation, civil conflicts,
infectious diseases, environmental
degradation — all of these are
transnational phenomena that have
the potential to kill large numbers of
Americans, whether swiftly or over
long periods of time."
Yet, she said, the militaristic and
self-serving nature of United States
foreign policy did little to strengthen
the bonds that the U.S. needed with
the greater international community.
"The United States does very lit

tle to increase goodwill when we are
seen to spend four times in each
month in Iraq what we spend in an
entire year on AIDS," she said. "Nor
do we win hearts and minds while
pouring $350 million a year in agri
culture subsidies that disenfranchise
impoverished farmers international
ly, while committing less than one
seventh of that sum to development
assistance.
"Internationally, the United
States is seen as a selfish and unilat
eral hegemon," Rice said."Never has
the support for the United States
been so low, yet never has the United
States been in more need of broad
and generous international support."
One way in which to achieve this
support, according to Rice, is to assist
weak and impoverished states on the
road to becoming self-sufficient.
"Building the capacity of weak
states to be effective partners for
their own people and for combating
transnational security threats is a
central security imperative for the
twenty-first century," she said. "To
minimize international antipathy to
wards the United States and to earn
the willing cooperation of others to
join with us, we need to be part of an
effort to expand the global winners'
circle — the body of people who
enjoy the fruits of a cooperative in
ternational system, a market-based
global economy and greater collec

tive security.
However, Rice noted that the
United States is currently failing to
provide adequate humanitarian aid.
especially regarding poverty, which,
she argued, "plays a complex and
dual role in facilitating the emer
gence and spread of security threats.
"Poverty increases the threat of
conflict," Rice said."Poverty can also
seriously erode state capacities to
contain transnational security
threats, and thus a downward spiral
or extreme doom loop is set in spiral.
Discerning and disaggregating this
dangerous dynamic is essential to
grasping the essential United States
national security rationale for eradi
cating poverty."
Just as important, said Rice, was the
humanitarian argument for combat
ing global poverty.
"Our common humanity, our
moral conscience and our national
values dictate that we cannot rest
while so much needless suffering ex
ists," Rice stated. "We are at a critical
point in our national history, when
our values and our interests coincide.
Reducing poverty is the right thing to
do morally. It is also the right thing to
do and the wise thing to do for our
national security."
While Rice noted that making hu
manitarian aid a priority in U.S. for
eign policy would require "a near
tectonic shift" of policy, she ended

her lecture on a high note — by en
couraging the current generation of
Stanford students to enter public
service.
"While it will be expensive and
perhaps unpopular to do so, Ameri
cans will certainly pay more dearly
over the long term if our leaders fail
to realize the risks and the costs to the
United States of persistent global
poverty," Rice said. "This is where
you come in — our government
sorely needs a new generation of
leaders and public servants to meet
the challenges."
Indeed, Rice's optimism about the
future stemmed from her expecta
tions of the younger generation.
"We need those who came of age
in the era of globalization, not my
generation," she said. "We need those
who are steeped in new geopolitical
realities, who are yet hopeful about
the future. We need those who see the
fundamental consonance between
U.S. values and US. policies. Most of
all, we need those who see that we can
and we must do much, much better.
"There is nothing more energiz
ing, in my view, than to help shape
U.S. policy, and by extension, the fu
ture of the world," Rice added.
"That's what public servants get to do
— they can literally change our coun
try and the world, even if by only
small increments, and hopefully for
the better."

"The United States does very lit

tle to increase goodwill when we are
seen to spend four times in each
month in Iraq what we spend in an
entire year on AIDS," she said. "Nor
do we win hearts and minds while
pouring $350 million a year in agri
culture subsidies that disenfranchise
impoverished farmers international
ly, while committing less than one
seventh of that sum to development
assistance.
"Internationally, the United
States is seen as a selfish and unilat
eral hegemon," Rice said."Never has
the support for the United States
been so low, yet never has the United
States been in more need of broad
and generous international support."
One way in which to achieve this
support, according to Rice, is to assist
weak and impoverished states on the
road to becoming self-sufficient.
"Building the capacity of weak
states to be effective partners for
their own people and for combating
transnational security threats is a
central security imperative for the
twenty-first century," she said. "To
minimize international antipathy to
wards the United States and to earn
the willing cooperation of others to
join with us, we need to be part of an
effort to expand the global winners'
circle — the body of people who
enjoy the fruits of a cooperative in
ternational system, a market-based
global economy and greater collec

tive security.
However, Rice noted that the
United States is currently failing to
provide adequate humanitarian aid.
especially regarding poverty, which,
she argued, "plays a complex and
dual role in facilitating the emer
gence and spread of security threats.
"Poverty increases the threat of
conflict," Rice said."Poverty can also
seriously erode state capacities to
contain transnational security
threats, and thus a downward spiral
or extreme doom loop is set in spiral.
Discerning and disaggregating this
dangerous dynamic is essential to
grasping the essential United States
national security rationale for eradi
cating poverty."
Just as important, said Rice, was the
humanitarian argument for combat
ing global poverty.
"Our common humanity, our
moral conscience and our national
values dictate that we cannot rest
while so much needless suffering ex
ists," Rice stated. "We are at a critical
point in our national history, when
our values and our interests coincide.
Reducing poverty is the right thing to
do morally. It is also the right thing to
do and the wise thing to do for our
national security."
While Rice noted that making hu
manitarian aid a priority in U.S. for
eign policy would require "a near
tectonic shift" of policy, she ended

her lecture on a high note — by en
couraging the current generation of
Stanford students to enter public
service.
"While it will be expensive and
perhaps unpopular to do so, Ameri
cans will certainly pay more dearly
over the long term if our leaders fail
to realize the risks and the costs to the
United States of persistent global
poverty," Rice said. "This is where
you come in — our government
sorely needs a new generation of
leaders and public servants to meet
the challenges."
Indeed, Rice's optimism about the
future stemmed from her expecta
tions of the younger generation.
"We need those who came of age
in the era of globalization, not my
generation," she said. "We need those
who are steeped in new geopolitical
realities, who are yet hopeful about
the future. We need those who see the
fundamental consonance between
U.S. values and US. policies. Most of
all, we need those who see that we can
and we must do much, much better.
"There is nothing more energiz
ing, in my view, than to help shape
U.S. policy, and by extension, the fu
ture of the world," Rice added.
"That's what public servants get to do
— they can literally change our coun
try and the world, even if by only
small increments, and hopefully for
the better."

served as the assistant secretary of
state for African Affairs under
Madeleine Albright.
The biographical segment was
variously tender and witty. Rice reas
sured Stanford students that not even
the current football season "could
compare to Big Game my freshman
year," in which The Play gave the win
to Cal. She also described coming
back to Stanford as "a sensory expe
rience in so many ways — you get the
aroma from the eucalyptus trees, the
flight instinct triggered by terrorists
on bicycles and the übiquitous sense
of the possible.
"1 know it's hard to appreciate
when you're still here, but I just
marked my twentieth reunion, and 1
can say with confidence that it really
doesn't get better than this," she re

Rice, who is currently a Senior
Fellow at the Brookings Institution,
went on to deliver a scathing criticism
of U.S. foreign policy in the status
quo, noting the importance of
"changing the tone and nature of U.S.
leadership."
Citing unconstitutional deten

tions of suspected terrorists at Guan
tanamo Bay and the killing of Iraqi
civilians as examples. Rice contended
that the United States is eroding its
moral leadership by hypocritically
rejecting its own principles, and that
it must win back its authority by ex
tending aid and support to its poten
tial allies.
"If we want others to work with us
to counter the gravest threats we
face, then we have to be serious about
putting resources behind helping to
eliminate the threats that are most
proximate to other people," she said.
Rice saw this need for interna
tional cooperation as arising partly
from the transnational nature of se
curity threats in the twenty-first cen
tury.
"The current risks to United
States national security extend be
yond the handful that are state
based," she said. "Terrorism,
weapons proliferation, civil conflicts,
infectious diseases, environmental
degradation — all of these are
transnational phenomena that have
the potential to kill large numbers of
Americans, whether swiftly or over
long periods of time."
Yet, she said, the militaristic and
self-serving nature of United States
foreign policy did little to strengthen
the bonds that the U.S. needed with
the greater international community.
