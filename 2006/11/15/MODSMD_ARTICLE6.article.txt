## Stem cells to be solved at Stanford? Medical School receives $20 million gift for cancer research center 
### JULIE KLEIN DESK EDITOR 
The Ludwig Center for Cancer Stem Cell Research
and Medicine, a research enterprise focused on the
study of cancer stem cells, will be the newest addition
to the Medieal School. The $20 million center, which
was announced on Nov. 14 by the New York-based Vir
ginia and D.k. Ludwig Fund, is part of a $120 million
gift to Stanford and five other national academic cen
ters.
The Ludwig Center's goals are to both identify and
better understand stem cells, which generate new cancer
cells and cause the disease to spread, as well as to directly
develop therapies that will destroy the cells. The majority
of the initial grant will go toward a permanent endow
ment for the center.
"These funds will enable us not only to advance our
initiatives on human cancer stem cells, but also to
strengthen other unique aspects of Stanford's cancer ac
tivities— from genomics to clinical care," Dr. Irving
Weissman. the Virginia and O.K. Ludwig Professor lor
Clinical Investigation in Cancer Research, said in a Med
ical Center press release.
Weissman. who will direct the project, was the first to
identify blood-forming stem cells in both humans and
mice. Oncology Prof. Michael Clarke, who will be the cen
ter's deputy director, was the first scientist to identity can
cer stem cells in breast cancer.
More than 30 faculty members
from ten academic departments will
collaborate with the Comprehensive
Cancer Center and the Institute for
Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative
Medicine. Stanford scientists will

also work with members of the other
Ludwig Centers.
"The Ludwig Fund is synony
mous with excellence in cancer re
search and we are honored to have
been designated a I.udwig Center"
Medical School Dean Philip Pizzo
said in the press release. "As a conse
quence our understanding of cancer
will be enhanced and will help im
prove the diagnosis and treatment of
patients with cancer."
