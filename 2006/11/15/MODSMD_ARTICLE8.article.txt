## Chavez poised to win reelection Venezuelan pushes populism ahead of Dec. 3 vote; running on a campaign of "love" 
### CLARA LONG 
Venezuela's charismatic President
Hugo Chavez appears poised for re
election next month, after a tumul
tuous and controversial first term.
Chavez is riding 59 percent voter
support into the upcoming Dec. 3
election, according to a recent poll
from Xogby International. Only 24
percent of surveyed voters support
Chavez's closest challenger, coali
tion candidate Manuel Rosales.
A polarized political environ
ment has plagued the Chavez presi
dency since Ins election in 1998. Op
position factions briefly occupied
the presidential palace in an aborted
April 2(M)2 coup attempt and subse
quently paralyzed the economy in a
four-month general strike. Chavez
also survived a 2004 referendum
vote on his presidency.
But the former army lieutenant,
who led a failed coup in 1992, conti
nues to appeal to poor Venezuelans,
who make up roughly SO percent of
the population, while high oil prices
have facilitated a public spending
spree aimed at meeting their needs.
The Chavez government has
poured money into popular social
development programs, called "mis
sions." which provide free health care
and education as well as cheap food
tor the poor. For Chavez supporters,
these programs are an integral part of
the socialist revolution that the gov
ernment declares it is leading.
Political Science Prof. Terry Karl
said Chavez's popularity is not anom
alous for a Venezuelan leader during
an oil boom. Historically, "high oil
prices are associated with extraordi
nary durability of regimes."
As long as oil stays high. Chavez
will be a political force to be reck
oned with. But that may obscure a
perverse consequence for the
Venezuelan people.
In the past, when oil prices have
risen, Venezuelan governments have
increased spending and borrowed
with the expectation of continued
high oil profits. Following that trend
— prices have increased six-fold dur
ing Chavez's tenure — the Chavez
government has unleashed a flood of
public spending, this year exceeding
the revenues from the country's siz
able oil exports by $2.28 billion.
While efforts to address poverty
in Latin America are "laudable."
Karl said."if you don't get the macro
economics right, those programs will
be undermined in the end."
Oil is a notoriously volatile com
modity and becoming more so. she
said.
"What goes up comes down" said
Karl, and when it does."it's like hav
ing a glacier drop on you and melt
suddenly."
Lower oil prices would stem the
flow of hard currency into the coun
try and cause the cash-gorged econ
omy to feel the effects of inflation.
Worse, said Karl, the currency deval

uation and restriction in spending
that would likely result "are extraor
dinarily hard on the poor."
" The end result could very well
make people poorer," he said.
In Venezuela, political turmoil
has mirrored boom and bust cycles
in oil markets. When the prices come
down, the leaders change.
But a drop in oil prices is unlikely
to happen before December's elec
tion.
With no strong opponent domes
tically, Chavez has focused his atten
tion in the campaign on international
politics. The incumbent denounced
all his challengers as candidates of
the U.S. "empire" as he launched his
re-election campaign in August. He
has made no secret of his distaste for
George W. Bush, frequently berating
the U.S. leader on his weekly televi
sion show and calling him "the devil"
in a September speech before the
U.N. General Assembly.
Hie Zogby poll reported that 36
percent of Venezuelan voters were
proud of their president's perform
ance at the U.N. while 57 percent
maintained an unfavorable view of
Bush.
Moreover, such expansive for
eign policy, said Karl, is typical of
Venezuelan oil boom presidents
who have long used the "black gold"
as an implement of diplomacy. After
all, she asked,"Who wouldn't?"
Chavez's heated rhetoric, howev
er, may hamper his efforts to unite
world leaders around opposition to
the United States. After a long cam
paign for the Latin American seat on
the U.N. Security Council, a stalemate
between Venezuela and U.S.-backed
Guatemala ended in a third-country
compromise. Panama took the rotat
ing Latin American seat last week.
In preparation for the vote this
summer. Chavez undertook a world
tour to various countries with less
than first-rate relationships with
the United States, calling on politi
cal leaders in Iran. Cuba, Russia.
Belarus. China. Qatar, Mali and
Vietnam. A visit to North Korea
was announced in July but later
called off.
Meanwhile, back in Venezuela, the
election campaign has been nothing if
not entertaining. Comedian Benjamin
Rausseo declared his candidacy in
August, punctuating campaign rallies
with cries of "beer for everyone."
Chavez himself has lightened his rev
olutionary rhetoric with a message of
"love," telling voters that he needs
their vote, their "vote for love."
With two and half weeks to go be
fore the vote and government coffers
still full of oil money, Christmas has
come early in the South American
country, according to Rory Carroll
and Daniel Cancel of Britain's
Guardian News. In the run-up to the
election, government hand-outs have
included "free train rides, free rock
concerts, free baseball games and De
cember bonuses in November."

Venezuela's charismatic President
Hugo Chavez appears poised for re
election next month, after a tumul
tuous and controversial first term.
Chavez is riding 59 percent voter
support into the upcoming Dec. 3
election, according to a recent poll
from Xogby International. Only 24
percent of surveyed voters support
Chavez's closest challenger, coali
tion candidate Manuel Rosales.
A polarized political environ
ment has plagued the Chavez presi
dency since Ins election in 1998. Op
position factions briefly occupied
the presidential palace in an aborted
April 2(M)2 coup attempt and subse
quently paralyzed the economy in a
four-month general strike. Chavez
also survived a 2004 referendum
vote on his presidency.
But the former army lieutenant,
who led a failed coup in 1992, conti
nues to appeal to poor Venezuelans,
who make up roughly SO percent of
the population, while high oil prices
have facilitated a public spending
spree aimed at meeting their needs.
The Chavez government has
poured money into popular social
development programs, called "mis
sions." which provide free health care
and education as well as cheap food
tor the poor. For Chavez supporters,
these programs are an integral part of
the socialist revolution that the gov
ernment declares it is leading.
Political Science Prof. Terry Karl
said Chavez's popularity is not anom
alous for a Venezuelan leader during
an oil boom. Historically, "high oil
prices are associated with extraordi
nary durability of regimes."
As long as oil stays high. Chavez
will be a political force to be reck
oned with. But that may obscure a
perverse consequence for the
Venezuelan people.
In the past, when oil prices have
risen, Venezuelan governments have
increased spending and borrowed
with the expectation of continued
high oil profits. Following that trend
— prices have increased six-fold dur
ing Chavez's tenure — the Chavez
government has unleashed a flood of
public spending, this year exceeding
the revenues from the country's siz
able oil exports by $2.28 billion.
While efforts to address poverty
in Latin America are "laudable."
Karl said."if you don't get the macro
economics right, those programs will
be undermined in the end."
Oil is a notoriously volatile com
modity and becoming more so. she
said.
"What goes up comes down" said
Karl, and when it does."it's like hav
ing a glacier drop on you and melt
suddenly."
Lower oil prices would stem the
flow of hard currency into the coun
try and cause the cash-gorged econ
omy to feel the effects of inflation.
Worse, said Karl, the currency deval

uation and restriction in spending
that would likely result "are extraor
dinarily hard on the poor."
" The end result could very well
make people poorer," he said.
