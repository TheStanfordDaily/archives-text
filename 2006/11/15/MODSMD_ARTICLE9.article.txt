## Black gold, a fool's errand? Petrodista Chavez claims huge oil reserves, wants OPEC recognition 
### CLARA LONG 
Venezuela is sitting on a gold mine. A black gold mine.
Beneath the bends of Venezuela's Orinoco River lies
what could be the worlds largest deposit of tar-sand —
heavy-crude petroleum that is more expensive to produce
than conventional oil. President I iugo Chavez has said he
believes the belt could yield 3(X) billion barrels of petroleum.
If those reserves are certified, Venezuela could sur
pass Saudi Arabia as the country with the world's largest
proven oil reserves — a quantity that the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPKC) uses
when calculating a member country's production quotas.
The South American country, which is a major suppli
er of oil to the U.S. market, now claims to pump 3.2 mil
lion barrels of crude a day. Outside sources say the pro
duction numbers may be closer to 2.6 million barrels.
Since Chavez took office in 1998, lie has tightened
state control over the oil industry, dissolving some lease
contracts with foreign oil companies in favor of mixed,
state-private partnerships. The country's tax agency has
targeted foreign firms and tightened fiscal control over
profits.
The state oil company "doesn't really have a business

strategy, they just have a political strategy," said David
Victor, a Stanford Law professor who studies the politi
cal economy of energy markets.
Even with the extra supplies, there is some doubt
about how well the state oil company can manage the in
evitable decline in oil prices, which has been buoyed by
geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East. Currently.
ictor said, supply and demand are closely matched so
the possibility of price volatility is high.
Ibe vast majority of Venezuelan oil now goes directlv
north —to the United States — a country that Chavez
sees as an overreaching empire. The socialist leader has
indicated he hopes to send an increasing proportion of
the country s oil to other buyers, and he has inked new
partnerships with ( hinese and Iranian oil companies.
It used to be that Venezuela's strategy (for oil] is that
trie United States is the best market," said Harold
I rinkunas. a visiting scholar at the Center for Latin
American Studies. But he said,"Chavez has been trying
to get away from a close link to the United States."
Meanwhile, Venezuela's state oil company. Petroleos
c. e Venezuela (PDVSA), has become the main source of
funds tor the "socialist revolution" that Chavez says he is
leading.
