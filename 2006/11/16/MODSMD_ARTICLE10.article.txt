### ANDREW TAYLOR ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — House Speaker-to-be
Nancy Pelosi faces a major leadership test
Thursday, barely a week into her new role,
as Democrats vote on her choice for major
ity leader. She's supporting a lawmaker
once caught up in a bribery scandal and
known more recently for trading votes for
pork projects.
Pelosi's prestige is on the line after en
dorsing longtime ally John Murtha of Penn
sylvania to be the No. 2 Democrat in place
of her longtime rival Steny Hoyer of Mary
land.
Senate Republicans, meanwhile, reward
ed Mississippi Sen.Trent Lott with their No.
2 post, four years after the White House
helped push him out of his job running the
Senate for making remarks interpreted as
endorsing segregation. President Bush, on a
trip to Russia and Asia, telephoned Lott on
Wednesday with congratulations.
Pressured to step down from the Sen
ate's top spot in 2()02, Lott returned to the
Republicans' second-ranking position by
nosing out Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn..
who had made an 18-month bid for the
post. Lott promised to defer to Minority
Leader-to-be Mitch McC'onnell. R-Ky.
House Republicans, finding them
selves in the minority for the first time
since 1994, will meet in private Thursday
to hear presentations from candidates for
their half-dozen leadership posts. Their
election is scheduled Friday. Speaker
Dennis Hastert of Illinois is leaving the
leadership ranks. Current Majority
Leader John Boehner of Ohio is favored
in a three-man race to replace him as the
House's top Republican.
Hoyer entered the Democratic leader
ship race with a substantial lead by most
counts, but he has been scrambling to hold
onto supporters since Pelosi's surprise in
tervention on Sunday. I le appeared to carry
a lead into Thursday's secret ballot despite
Pelosi's opposition.

"I think we're in very good shape. 1 ex
pect to win." Hoyer said. "I expect that we
will bring the party together and become
unified and move on from this."
With characteristic gruffness, Murtha
said the opposite was true: "We're going to
win. We got the votes." he said Wednesday
afternoon on MSNBC's "Hardball."
Allies such as Rep. George Miller. D-
Calif. — also a top confidant of Pelosi —
have been working this week to peel away
votes from Hoyer. Pelosi also has inter
vened more directly, making the case for
Murtha in one-on-one meeting with Demo
cratic freshmen — sessions in which the in
coming lawmakers ask for all-important
committee assignments.
Murtha. a former Marine who generally
has supported U.S. military efforts, has
gained considerable attention this year for
his criticism of the administration's Iraq
war policies. He steered Pelosi's winning
campaign in 2()01 against 1 loyer for the No.
2 Democratic leadership post, and his sup
porters say Pelosi deserves a more loyal
wingman.
But Murtha is also a controversial figure.
He was investigated in 1980 as part of the
Abscam bribery sting, but was the only law
maker involved who wasn't charged crimi
nally.
FBI agents pretending to represent an
Arab sheik wanting to reside in the United
States and seeking investment opportuni
ties approached Murtha and several other
lawmakers with offers of bribes.
When offered $50,000. Murtha is record
ed as saying. "I'm not interested ... at this
point." A grand jury declined to prosecute
Murtha. and the House ethics committee is
sued no findings against him. On MSNBC
Wednesday. Murtha said. "I told them I
wanted investment in my district. They put
$50,000 on the table and I said. I'm not in
terested.'"
Murtha has a record of not always being
a leadership loyalist, frequently supplying
votes to GOP leaders who were struggling
to pass bills. The none-too-subtle trade-off:

Murtha and his allies would do better when
home-state projects were doled out by the
Republicans.
He has been criticized by ethics watch
dogs such as Citizens for Responsibility
and Ethics in Washington, who have said
he exemplifies a "pay-to-play" culture of
Washington. The group says Murtha has
steered defense projects to clients of KSA
Consulting, a lobbying firm that until re
cently employed his brother Kit. Clients
of the firm are generous with campaign
contributions.
Hoyer claims considerable support
from some liberals made uncomfortable

by Murtha's opposition to abortion, gun
control and changes to House ethics
rules. He also is a leadership contact for
many moderate "Blue Dog" Democrats.
Hoyer's backers say he has been an able
lieutenant to Pelosi and has done nothing to
disqualify himself from holding the same
position in the majority.
He has been aggressive in lining up sup
porters. most of whom are sticking with
him.
"One of the first things I learned around
here is that when you give your commit
ment you honor it." said Rep. Rick Bouch
er. D-Va., a Hover supporter.
