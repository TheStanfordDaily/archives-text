asked me what I thought about it. At
a couple of points, I told him he was

crazy," Barker said.
Barker said he and Green then
approached the others with the idea,
hut there never was a verbal agree
ment to do it.
"Things just got set in motion, we
just started changing (clothes), my
self. Cortez and Green," Barker said.
"By the time we started changing
clothes, it was more or less a nonver
bal agreement that we were going to
go along with what we were dis
cussing." Barker said he. Green and
Cortez raped the girl, and Green
killed the girl, her parents and her
sister.
Barker did not name Spielman
