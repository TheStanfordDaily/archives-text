ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)
— Pakistan's lower house of Par
liament passed amendments to
the country's rape laws Wednes
day. ditching the death penalty
for extramarital sex and revising
a clause on making victims pro
duce four witnesses to prove rape
cases.
International and local calls for
change intensified after the 2002
gang-rape of a woman. Mukhtar
Mai, who was assaulted after a
tribal council in her eastern Pun
jab village ordered the rape as
punishment for her 13-year-old
brother's alleged affair with a
woman of a higher caste.
The amendments enraged Is
lamic fundamentalists, but won
cautious support from human
rights activists, who wanted the
controversial laws scrapped alto
gether.
President Gen. Pervez
Musharraf praised lawmakers for
passage and urged the Senate to
approve the amendments within
days.
Sher Afghan, federal minister
for parliamentary affairs, predict
ed that would occur."We have ma
jority in the Senate,and the Senate
will also approve the bill."
Musharraf also criticized Is
lamic fundamentalists for their
"unnecessary" opposition and
claims that his government was
acting against Islam.
"I have taken a firm decision to
change these unjust rape laws as it
was necessary to amend them to
protect women," Musharraf said in
a televised address to the nation.

Consensual sex outside mar
riage remains a crime punishable
by five years in prison or a $165
fine, said a parliamentary official,
who spoke on condition of
anonymity because he was not
authorized to speak to the media.
The amendments were passed
by a majority of the 342-member
assembly, including Prime Minis
ter Shaukat Aziz, who said it
marked "a historic day" for the
country.

I have taken a firm
decision to change
these unjust rape
laws as it was
necessary to amend
them to protect
women.
Gen. Pervez Musharraf
President of Pakistan

"Nothing is against Islam in
this bill." Aziz said,adding that the
amendments were made in con
sultation with Islamic scholars,
lawmakers and human rights ac
tivists.
Pro-Islamic lawmakers
stormed out of the National As
sembly Wednesday in protest of
the new legislation, known as the
Protection of Women Bill.
"We reject it," Maulana Fazlur
Rahman, a top Islamist opposi
tion leader, told reporters after
the vote, which he described as a
"dark day" in Pakistan's parlia
mentary history.
Rahman and other Islamists

vowed to devise a strategy to
block Senate passage of the bill.
Islamic political groups have pre
viously staged mass rallies to de
nounce moves by the military-led
government deemed contrary to
Islam.
Pakistan's late military dic
tator, Gen. Zia uI-Haq, intro
duced the laws, known as the
Hudood Ordinance, in 1979 to
appease Islamic fundamentalist
political groups opposed to the
secularization of Pakistani so
ciety.
Human rights activists and
moderates have long condemned
the laws for punishing — instead
of protecting _ rape victims by
placing the burden of proof on
them and providing safeguards
for their attackers, such as requir
ing four eyewitnesses to bring
rape charges.
Hie amendments come amid
efforts by Islamabad to soften the
country's hard-line Islamic image
and appease moderates and
human rights groups opposed to
the laws.
Hina Jillani, a leading female
Pakistani human rights activist,
praised the government for taking
practical steps to amend the rape
laws, but demanded more legisla
tion to protect women's rights.
"The government has made
some positive changes by passing
this bill, but it does not meet our
demands," said Jillani, of the
Human Rights Commission of
Pakistan. "We wanted a total re
peal of the 1979 rape law, but the
government has not done it."
The amendments include
dropping the death penalty and
flogging for people convicted of
having consensual sex outside
marriage and giving judges discre
tion to try rape cases in a criminal
rather than Islamic court. Strict Is
lamic law dictates that a woman
claiming rape must produce four
witnesses, making a trial almost
impossible.
