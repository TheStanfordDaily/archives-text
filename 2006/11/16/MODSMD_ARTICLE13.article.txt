## Editorial Board Rotation program for Ph. D students 
### 
There are a few departments, such as
applied physics, that have rotation
policies allowing first-year graduate
students to go through three labs during the
course of the year before committing to one
for the rest of their time at Stanford. But
many departments either lack such policies
or fail to enforce them. We believe
that rotation programs should be highly en
couraged and consistently applied across all
departments.
Starting graduate school is an over
whelming experience. In the midst of get
ting used to the quarter system and getting
familiar with the new surroundings (for
some, even a new country and language),
many techie Ph D students are forced to de
cide which research group they will devote
the next 5 to 6 years of their lives. For vari
ous reasons, including the desire to acceler
ate their Ph D and the fear that openings in
research groups will be offered to others,
many do not have the opportunity to fully
evaluate their lab options. This pressure to
join a lab as soon as possible results in some
students committing to groups that may not
be the best fit.
There are several motivations for the ro
tation programs. Many students have had
little experience with research in a laborato
ry atmosphere before coming to grad
school. Rotation programs give students an
opportunity to gain a broader view of re
search in their department. This provides
those who do not yet have a clear idea of
their specific research interest a chance to
sample different areas. In the absence of
such programs, many students make their
decision based on the reputation of the pro
fessor or by the list of his publications; oth
ers don't even have time to access such tools.
But as any Ph.D student may testify, the ex
periences of actually doing the research is
often very different from what is represent
ed in publieations and papers. A quarter
long rotation provides students the chance
to experience actually working in the lab
without having to make a commitment.
There are, of course, some students who

have a clear idea of their future dissertation
research or are committed to a particular
research field even before arriving on the
Farm. But rotations will be helpful even for
these students by teaching them comple
mentary techniques and approaches that
might apply to their thesis research or later
careers. Such rotations also allow students
to build relationships with many of their
peers and professors and to form a network
that they can leverage in their research.
The rotations may also serve as a testing
ground for both students and the professors
before they commit themselves to their
long-term relationship. While talking to
current students in a certain research group
may giving incoming students an idea of the
working style and atmosphere of the group,
these secondhand experiences might not
mirror the actual relationship the student
will form with the thesis advisor or the
group. Rotation programs will help stu
dents and professors test their comfort level
with each other before making any long
term commitments.
But while lab rotations would be general
ly beneficial, an overarching, mandatory
three-quarter rotation policy can be unjusti
fied under certain circumstances. Some re
search departments require learning a
whole suite of techniques, and students may
want to get into the mold as early as possi
ble. In heterogeneous departments like
chemical engineering, some students are
committed to a subfield where they may
have only two real options within a certain
department, making a third rotation super
fluous.
We believe that each department should
carefully consider ways in which they could
encourage students to explore different op
tions during their first year. Instead of pres
suring students to make early decisions,
professors should support and advise stu
dents in choosing their rotation labs.The ro
tation programs will not only help students
evaluate and choose the most appropriate
fit for themselves, but will also prepare
them for research experiences in the future.
