# Dance dance socialist revolution

### 
Last Sunday, aided by the generous
Bing Overseas Program, I went to
see my first ballet, "Giselle." Twenty
minutes before the show. I called my friend
in a panic to ask whether it would be trans
lated from the original Italian into Russian
or English.
"Urn. Kat, you're thinking of opera," he
told me. "Ballet doesn't have any words.
And I think it's French anyway."
A night of cultural enrichment in
Moscow without the burden of the Russian
language? Even 1 could understand that.
My smug reaction, I imagine, was some
thing like the look on Columbus' face
when he proudly announced to his fleets:
"Dudes, India is like 10 miles hence."
Hie evening started out normally: 1
made it to the Bolshoi Theatre in plenty of
time to stand around pensively, flicking cig
arette ash in the snow. A few passers-by
took my indie aloofness for criminal intent,
apparently, and offered to buy tickets off of
me — one woman went so far as to offer a
hefty fee in my choice of rubles. Euros or
British pounds. Unfortunately 1 had to
duck inside before she got a chance to up
the ante to dubloons.
Once we checked our coats and idled in
the lobby among a mass of tourists, 1 felt
sophisticated and debonair. Prompted by
the ads I saw on the Metro for the new
Bond movie, I decided to saunter over to
the bar for a devastatingly overpriced mar
tini. The first warning bells went off when
the surly bartender poured an oily liquid
straight from a bottle to a wine glass and
sloshed it over the counter to me. But I was
game: I handed over what could have been
the down payment on my firstborn's braces
and lifted the glass to my lips. Then
promptly put it back down. Martinis are
light, crisp, delicious; this tasted like Mel
Gibson's morning breath after a hot post-
Passover drinking binge. Like a potentially

toxic by-product of legitimate alcohol.
Oh god. 1 was drinking straight ver
mouth. As 1 sipped the last few drops, I felt
like a Lifetime Original Movie character
played by Delta Burke.
When I finally took my seat to watch the
performance, I kind of wished I were
watching that Lifetime movie instead.
Going into the show. I thought 1 had a leg
up on my fellow American spectators. A
few years ago there was a Final Jeopardy!
question about a ballet where a female doll
comes to life; 1 distinctly remember all
three contestants answered "Giselle."
However, after 45 agonizing minutes
squinting for any remote sign of a toy shop,
I realized that no one left the studio with
big money — not only was there no doll
angle to the story, but I couldn't find much
in the way of a recognizable plot arc either.
One of the slight pitfalls to the theory
that dance is the universal language is that
while concepts like love and jealousy are
easily conveyed, character relationships
can get a little murky. With minimal help
from the people sitting on either side of
me. 1 managed to gather the basic gist of
the piece: two crazy young kids fell in love;
one or more of them died; dancing was
somehow involved? But the finesse of the
story totally eluded me.
In order to fill in troubling narrative gaps.

Out and Aboutski
after the first 10 minutes of painful
brow-furrowing, I started creating
my own back stories and names for
the characters. ITiis method actually
kept me going pretty well until inter
mission, when I asked a friend about
the evil archduke Eduardo and was
politely informed that he was actual
ly a woodcutter. Which 1 guess ex
plains the axe.
The second the curtain fluttered
down over the first act. 1 bee-lined
straight for the bar. 1 needed anoth
er vermouth. After 1 realized that
during the break all of the charac
ters had changed costumes and thus
become totally unrecognizable to
my poor frazzled brain. 1 wished I
had brought the bottle.
When 1 finally collected my coat
and headed back out into the snowy
night, it was as a confused but intel
lectually challenged girl. Before
"Giselle," my only previous ballet
experience was watching the movie
"Center Stage" every Thanksgiving,
so while 1 was basically prepared for
the ballet's lush sets and breathtak

ing costumes, I wasn't expecting the
art to go so over my head. I respect
the dancers I saw both as artists and
athletes and recognize that what
they did, they did well — 1 just did
n't have a clue what it was.
In my comfort zone of literature, 1
can discern the shades of meaning
between explanation, explication
and elucidation, but the subtle differ
ences between a flutter-flounce-flip
and flip-flutter-flounce are way out
of my league. As a not-unintellectual
Stanford student. I swaggered into
the theatre assuming 1 could follow
the basic flow of an immortal narra
tive then was stopped dead in my
tracks. And 1 thought getting lost in
the Metro was embarrassing.
Although the nuances of my vir
gin ballet experience may be lost
forever (along with half of my taste
buds). 1 left the theatre resolved to
look more into this ballet business
once 1 get back to San Francisco.
But next time, I'm going research
the plot before I get into the seat —
and definitely stay away from the
vermouth.

Last Sunday, aided by the generous
Bing Overseas Program, I went to
see my first ballet, "Giselle." Twenty
minutes before the show. I called my friend
in a panic to ask whether it would be trans
lated from the original Italian into Russian
or English.
"Urn. Kat, you're thinking of opera," he
told me. "Ballet doesn't have any words.
And I think it's French anyway."
A night of cultural enrichment in
Moscow without the burden of the Russian
language? Even 1 could understand that.
My smug reaction, I imagine, was some
thing like the look on Columbus' face
when he proudly announced to his fleets:
"Dudes, India is like 10 miles hence."
Hie evening started out normally: 1
made it to the Bolshoi Theatre in plenty of
time to stand around pensively, flicking cig
arette ash in the snow. A few passers-by
took my indie aloofness for criminal intent,
apparently, and offered to buy tickets off of
me — one woman went so far as to offer a
hefty fee in my choice of rubles. Euros or
British pounds. Unfortunately 1 had to
duck inside before she got a chance to up
the ante to dubloons.
Once we checked our coats and idled in
the lobby among a mass of tourists, 1 felt
sophisticated and debonair. Prompted by
the ads I saw on the Metro for the new
Bond movie, I decided to saunter over to
the bar for a devastatingly overpriced mar
tini. The first warning bells went off when
the surly bartender poured an oily liquid
straight from a bottle to a wine glass and
sloshed it over the counter to me. But I was
game: I handed over what could have been
the down payment on my firstborn's braces
and lifted the glass to my lips. Then
promptly put it back down. Martinis are
light, crisp, delicious; this tasted like Mel
Gibson's morning breath after a hot post-
Passover drinking binge. Like a potentially

toxic by-product of legitimate alcohol.
Oh god. 1 was drinking straight ver
mouth. As 1 sipped the last few drops, I felt
like a Lifetime Original Movie character
played by Delta Burke.
When I finally took my seat to watch the
performance, I kind of wished I were
watching that Lifetime movie instead.
Going into the show. I thought 1 had a leg
up on my fellow American spectators. A
few years ago there was a Final Jeopardy!
question about a ballet where a female doll
comes to life; 1 distinctly remember all
three contestants answered "Giselle."
However, after 45 agonizing minutes
squinting for any remote sign of a toy shop,
I realized that no one left the studio with
big money — not only was there no doll
angle to the story, but I couldn't find much
in the way of a recognizable plot arc either.
One of the slight pitfalls to the theory
that dance is the universal language is that
while concepts like love and jealousy are
easily conveyed, character relationships
can get a little murky. With minimal help
from the people sitting on either side of
me. 1 managed to gather the basic gist of
the piece: two crazy young kids fell in love;
one or more of them died; dancing was
somehow involved? But the finesse of the
story totally eluded me.
In order to fill in troubling narrative gaps.

after the first 10 minutes of painful
brow-furrowing, I started creating
my own back stories and names for
the characters. ITiis method actually
kept me going pretty well until inter
mission, when I asked a friend about
the evil archduke Eduardo and was
politely informed that he was actual
ly a woodcutter. Which 1 guess ex
plains the axe.
