# Global warming is for the poor
## 
### 
The British government warned last
month that global warming might de
crease the world's gross domestic
product by as much as 20 percent and make
up to 200 million people refugees because of
floods and droughts. It further indicated that
poor countries would disproportionately
bear these costs.
1 never thought of global warming as a so
cial justice issue. At first, I thought of the
Earth's rising temperature as a purely envi
ronmental affair, envisioning big, beautiful
glaciers melting away into the ocean and lit
tle islands being swallowed up by the result
ing rise in sea level. Polar bears might die, but
certainly not large numbers of dispropor
tionately poor people.
Then Hurricane Katrina killed almost
2,000 people, many of whom were poor, and
my image of global warming changed. Even
if global warming didn't cause Katrina, stud
ies have shown that climate change has
caused or will cause hurricanes like it. Katri
na seemed like a test case of what is going to
happen when the Earth really starts to warm
up. and the results of this test startled me in
their implications.
It was obvious from the news coverage of
Katrina that the rich had the resources to
leave Louisiana and other areas hit by the
storm while the poor did not. Government
reports that came out after the event con
firmed this anecdotal evidence. Congress's
non-partisan research branch, the Congres
sional Research Service, reported that
"Hurricane Katrina disproportionately im

pacted communities where the poor and mi
norities, mostly African-Americans,
resided." The report noted that "over 30
percent of the most impacted population
had incomes below 1.5 times the poverty
line, and over 40 percent had incomes below
twice the poverty line."
The British government's report on glob
al warming showed that global climate
change disproportionately affects poor coun
tries, while Katrina showed that global warm
ing disproportionately affects poor people
within all countries.
This seems particularly unfair when you
consider that wealthy countries and wealthy
people disproportionately create the green
house gasses that cause global warming.
Between 1900 and 2000, global carbon
dioxide emissions have increased tenfold.
By some estimates, industrialized countries
are responsible for roughly 80 percent of
this carbon-dioxide build up in the atmos
phere.
While all segments of society benefit from
the greenhouse-gas-emitting production of
gasoline, food, power and consumer goods,

wealthy people who own the factories that
produce these goods reap most of the dollar
profit from their production and are the ones
who actually create the greenhouse gases.
So, generally speaking, wealthy people in
wealthy countries have created global warm
ing, while poor people in poor countries suf
fer the brunt of the consequences.
And here's the kicker: It's the wealthy, in
dustrialized countries that are the ones in a
signilicant position to do anything about it.
Developing countries in large part do not
have the resources to reduce their green
house-gas emissions.
And how have wealthy countries re
sponded to their role in global climate
change? One hundred sixty-six countries,
including most industrialized nations, have
committed to meet targets for the reduction
of greenhouse gasses under the Kyoto Pro
tocol.The United States, by far the greatest
contributor of greenhouse-gas emissions in
the world, has not ratified the treaty. Presi
dent Bush calls the Kyoto Protocol "unreal
istic."
What is truly unrealistic is the Bush ad
ministration's belief that the world can sur
vive under global warming. But then again,
he s pretty rich.so maybe he can survive. I'm
not sure the rest of the world will be so lucky.
