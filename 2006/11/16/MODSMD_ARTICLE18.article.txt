Correction of Daily article on IRAs
As a former Daily staff writer. I under
stand that The Daily makes mistakes. Some
times writing articles is tough, particularly
when you have to write articles and know
nothing about the subject matter. I imagine
that me covering Bioinformatics was some
thing like K-Fed covering election night re
sults.
That said. I feel the need to correct Ihe
Daily on a recent article that featured quotes
from me, a recent winner of PWR's Innova
tive Research Award (IRA) ("PWR awards
honor innovative research," Nov. 10).The ar
ticle states, "Fuller, a former Daily staff
writer, studied how the children of immi
grants adjust to university life in her paper
(...J With the help of Writing Center Director
Clyde Moneyhun, she plans to start a discus
sion group for first-generation students."
First-generation college students are not
in fact children of immigrants, though they
can be. I"he term "first-generation college

student" means that such a student was the
first person in his or her family to attend any
type of college, by conservative definition, or
the first person in his or her family to earn a
four-year degree.
I feel that this is an important correction
for anyone who is interested in the discussion
group The Daily mentioned. Flyers for the
group will soon appear around campus, and I
want people to be clear about their purpose.
I partially blame myself for not double
checking that the writer understood the term
"first-generation college student," as I
wrongly assumed general comprehension of
its meaning.
However, I wish that The Daily had sent
someone to the awards reception, though
again I do not personally blame the writer of
this article.The first three lines of my speech:
"What is a first-generation college student?
I've discussed my research with a number of
people, professors included, and this ques
tion often comes up.Trust me, you don't want
to be half an hour through a conversation

with someone before you realize that they
think you're studying an immigration-relat
ed topic."
1 then proceeded to explain that the term
first-generation college student" deals with
college students whose parents have never
attended a university. Such students face a
unique set of challenges as they enter college,
olten feeling torn between the world of their
parents and that of their peers, as well as
pressured to "lit in" their new environment.
Vet, a general lack of awareness persists re
garding class at the university level â€” a no
tion reinforced by the fact that the editors
who saw this article at The Daily didn't know
what a first-generation college student is. In
turn, first-generation students have little op
portunity to bond with others who share
their backgrounds. For this reason, I am start
ing the first-generation college student dis
cussion group.
I believe that The Daily should encourage
