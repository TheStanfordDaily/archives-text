## Heading up the Oregon trail No. 3 Women's Volleyball travels to Oregon. Oregon State for crucial Pac-10 match-ups 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
While their classmates are recovering
from ITianksgiving feasts, the No. 3 Stanford
women's volleyball team will battle No. 2
Washington with the Pacific-10 Conference
title and perhaps a No. 1 seed in the NCAA

Tournament on the line.
I out matches currently stand between
the Cardinal (21-3, 12-2 Pac-10) and the
postseason .1 road trip to Oregon this
weekend and .1 final home stand against the
Huskies 11 1 J, 12-2) and Washington State
(15-13,3-11).
• Hie Pac 10 is usually so tough that you
need to win 18 in a row to win the confer

ence." head coach John Dunning said."Right
now, we just need to win four."
But picking up those four wins will be no
easy feat. On Thursday night, the Cardinal
will play Oregon (17-7,7-7) before traveling
to Oregon State (3-20,0-14) 011 Friday. The
Ducks have surprised everyone with one of
their best seasons in recent memory while
the Beavers have struggled mightily, winning
only four games and not a single match in
conference this season.
This is the best Oregon team in years,"
Dunning said. "I really want to congratulate
their coach on doing such a good job. They
have improved dramatically,and with a lot of
the same players from last year."

Sophomore middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo sat out in Stanford's match with
No. 6 UCLA last Saturday, one night after
the Cardinal were swept by No. 4 USC.

When the Ducks were in Maples in Octo
ber, Stanford notched a three-game sweep.
30-20, 30-18,30-18, behind 10 kills and nine
blocks by sophomore middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo. Erin Little and Sonja New
combe led the Ducks' offense while libero
Katie Swoboda had a match-high 1 7 digs.
Swoboda recently broke the Oregon sin
gle-season record in digs and has ( )I7 in less
than two years with the team. Newcombe
leads the Ducks with 311 kills while Kristen
Bitter is hitting a team-high .238.
The Ducks have lost three straight games,
including a close five-game loss to Washing
ton in Eugene two weeks ago.
"Oregon is very dangerous at home and is
finishing with four big matches — Stanford
and Cal, then USC and UCLA," Dunning
said."We are the first, so they are going to be
very prepared to play with us."
The Beavers have not caught any breaks
in the powerful Pac-10 conference and
should not pose much of a challenge for the
Cardinal. In all 43 meetings, Stanford has
never lost.
Sophomore outside hitter Cynthia Bar
boza notched 20 kills and 14 digs — both
match-highs — for Stanford in the three
game (30-19.30-17,30-20) victory over Ore
gon State last month. Rachel Rourke had 11
kills for the Beavers, lliis season, Rourke
leads the squad in kills (348), hitting percent
age (.237) and service aces (22).
Back on campus and without classes to
contend for their attention, the team can
then spend Thanksgiving week practicing
and resting in preparation for the showdown
with Washington, essentially the conference
championship, so long as both teams avoid
upsets this weekend.The two teams are tied
with 12-2 conference records and, with Stan
ford in Oregon and the Huskies in Arizona,
both are favored to win this weekend.
The Cardinal struggled last weekend
against No. 4 USC before coming back to
beat No. 6 UCLA, but Dunning believes the
loss will not hurt the team in the long run and
may in fact help prepare them for Washing
ton and the postseason.
"We went through a weekend that al
lowed us to learn a lot." he said. "Coming off
a loss is always hard,especially when we did
n't play well and didn't play together. But we
found out that we can still be great if we light
hard. There was a lot of heart and a lot of
teamwork. It doesn't have to be perfect and
it doesn't have to be smooth — you just need
to keep lighting."
And the Cardinal will need to light with
everything they have against Washington.
The defending national champions, the
Huskies lost five seniors from last year's
team but have hardly missed a beat in 2006.
"1 don't really like to compare [teams
across seasons], but they were amazing last
year," Dunning said. " ITiey have some new
players in their lineup this year and they
have a great setter in Courtney Thompson,
who is surrounded by really good players, in
cluding a bunch of Ail-Americans. We know
how good they are and that they are capable
of beating everybody they play — just like
we are."
When the Cardinal opened the confer
ence season in Seattle in September, the
Huskies' defense was overwhelming, and
Washington won in three games, 30-21, 30-
28,30-25. Barboza led all players with 25 kills
while Christal Morrison had a team-high 17
for the Huskies. Stanford's sophomore
libero Jessica Fishburn had a match-high 25

The Cardinal will be back on the court in
Maples for one last time, except perhaps in
the opening rounds of the NCAA Tourna
ment, to host Washington State the following
night.
Washington State lost in three games in
Pullman in the conference season opener,

Kelly 1 lyder has 471 digs on the season.
As the final conference home game, that
match with the ( ougars will be Senior Night,
and Stanford will pay tribute to the four sen
iors on the squad: outside hitter Kristin
Richards, right side Njideka Nnamani and
middle blockers Lizzie Suiter and Michelle
Mellard.
Richards recently became the all-time

leader in digs at Stanford, with nearly 1500 in
her career. I*his season, she is averaging 3.5
kills and 3.2 digs per game, and dug a season
high 26 halls in Arizona two weeks ago. An
Ail-American last year. Richards' all-around
play has been crucial to the squad's success.
Nnamani. a right side hitter and defensive
specialist, is one of two players to have seen
the court in every game the Cardinal has
played in 2006. She is averaging nearly two
digs per game and is third on the team in serv
ice aces with 18.
Suiter recorded nearly 200 blocks in her
sophomore campaign, second in a single sea
son in Stanford history, but missed much of
2005 due to injury. Hampered by a back injury
earlier this year. Suiter has played only spar
ingly but did not miss a step when filling in for
an injured Akinradewo last weekend against
UCLA. Her solo stuff block against the Bru
ins' power hitter Nana Meriwether was one of
the highlights of that incredibly competitive
match.
Mellard, one of the three team captains
this year along with Richards and junior set
ter Bryn Kehoe, has played in nearly half of
the Cardinal's games this season and has the
team's second-highest blocks-per-game aver
age at just over one.
On Sun., Nov. 26, the bracket for the
NCAA Tournament will be announced. The
sites for the first two rounds will be an

nounced then as well. Ilie four predeter
