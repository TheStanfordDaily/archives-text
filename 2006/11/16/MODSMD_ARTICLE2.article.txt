## The 						richest man on earth shares insights with technology forum 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
"The opportunity is there,
but you have to put the
pieces together in a
different way than has
been done before/'
— BILL GATES,
founder of Microsoft

Computing today is still in its infancy, Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates told a full house at theTechNet
Innovation Summit in Memorial Auditorium yesterday
afternoon.
"The PC. that 1 dreamed about having for myself is
far better than what we offer now." Gates said, predict
ing his dream computer might be available within 15
years. "It's a time when all the large companies have
more opportunities than ever before."
In a wide-ranging one-hour discussion, the world's
richest man talked candidly with PBS anchor Charlie
Rose about his company's competition with Google, his
ambitious humanitarian agenda and America's relative
decline in economic power.
Gates hyped the new Window's Vista operating sys-

tem, set for public re
lease at the end of Jan
uary. I le called the
iPod a phenomenon
and said that the just
released Zune hand
held portable music
player has special fea
tures that make it wor
thy to compete, includ
ing the ability to share
songs with friends.
While Microsoft came
late to video games, he
claimed that the new
Xbox 360 will be the
best console in the in
dustry.
The 51 -year-old
has made headlines for
giving most of his for
tune to the charity that
he and his wife co
chair, the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foun-

dation. Gates talked about foundation goals, ranging
from fighting malaria in Africa to improving charter
schools in America. With a pledge of $31 billion from
investor Warren Buffet this summer, the increasingly
influential foundation will be able to spend $3 billion a
year by 2009, Gates said.
"The opportunity is there, but you have to put the
pieces together in a different way than has been done
before," he added.
Gates, who wore a pinstripe suit without a neck tie,
said he was hopeful that the foundation could have a
real impact.

Bill Gates speaks to a full audience at the Technet Innovation Summit 2006 about the future of
Microsoft, the weakening American economic prowess and his humanitarian foundation.
"I started naively optimistic." he
said, "and now I'm more concretely
optimistic."
Gates also called China the new
"pace setter" for the global economy.
"It's like capitalism running at a
higher speed than it is here," he said.
"We have to renew our commitment
to the things that made us stronger."

He noted that America's relative
economic power has been declining
since the end of World War II and that
it will continue declining as China and
European nations grow. But he said
the whole world, including Ameri
cans. will benefit from growth and the
proliferation of technology in the
years to come.
"The U.S. has been sort of spoiled
by being powerful for so long," he said.
When Rose asked Gates about his
decision to drop out of Harvard,
Gates quickly interrupted to say that
he had only stopped out.

"My parents were very con
cerned." he reflected."lt seemed like a
big risk. It was one of those times that
went almost beyond numerical think
ing."
On his company's high-profile
competition with Google, Gates ac
knowledged that the two firms "over
lap a lot."
"This competition is a fun one for
both companies." he said. "You want
two companies with crucial mass tak
ing on tough problems."
When a graduate student in com
puter science pressed him about his

dim predictions that American stu
dents are falling behind in math and
computer-science education. Gates
showed his softer side.
"It's actually good for you "he told
the student. "Say there was only one
computer scientist. 'ITien we and
Google would bid, like, a billion dol
lars for you to come work for us."
Rose, who has interviewed Gates
nearly a dozen times,said the tech icon
was as energetic Wednesday as he had
ever seen him.
"He was engaged," he told The
Daily afterwards. "You could feel the

resonance that people were into what
he was saying."
The discussion with Gates was the
third panel of the day. In the morning,
Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang and Net
flix CEO Reed Hastings talked about
the future of innovation. Another
morning discussion focused on energy
alternatives and green technology.
John Doerr, a speaker on the
Going Green panel and a partner at
Kleiner. Perkins. Caufield and Byers.
said that he thought the global dimen
sion of the program made the pro
gram unique.

"It all comes together right here at
Stanford University," he said. "We re
at ground zero."
Gates is the public face of Mi
crosoft, a behemoth of a company that
some critics charge has passed its
prime. But Rose said Gates' passion
for his products and his company
showed when he spoke.
"I would never count Microsoft
out," Rose told The Daily. "I would
never count Bill Gates out in terms of
the end game. They have very good
second-half players. They know how
to play catch up."

ing his dream computer might be available within 15
years. "It's a time when all the large companies have
more opportunities than ever before."
In a wide-ranging one-hour discussion, the world's
richest man talked candidly with PBS anchor Charlie
Rose about his company's competition with Google, his
ambitious humanitarian agenda and America's relative
decline in economic power.
Gates hyped the new Window's Vista operating sys-

tem, set for public re
lease at the end of Jan
uary. I le called the
iPod a phenomenon
and said that the just
released Zune hand
held portable music
player has special fea
tures that make it wor
thy to compete, includ
ing the ability to share
songs with friends.
While Microsoft came
late to video games, he
claimed that the new
Xbox 360 will be the
best console in the in
dustry.
The 51 -year-old
has made headlines for
giving most of his for
tune to the charity that
he and his wife co
chair, the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foun-

dation. Gates talked about foundation goals, ranging
from fighting malaria in Africa to improving charter
schools in America. With a pledge of $31 billion from
investor Warren Buffet this summer, the increasingly
influential foundation will be able to spend $3 billion a
year by 2009, Gates said.
"The opportunity is there, but you have to put the
pieces together in a different way than has been done
before," he added.
Gates, who wore a pinstripe suit without a neck tie,
said he was hopeful that the foundation could have a
real impact.

Bill Gates speaks to a full audience at the Technet Innovation Summit 2006 about the future of
Microsoft, the weakening American economic prowess and his humanitarian foundation.
"I started naively optimistic." he
said, "and now I'm more concretely
optimistic."
Gates also called China the new
"pace setter" for the global economy.
"It's like capitalism running at a
higher speed than it is here," he said.
"We have to renew our commitment
to the things that made us stronger."

He noted that America's relative
economic power has been declining
since the end of World War II and that
it will continue declining as China and
European nations grow. But he said
the whole world, including Ameri
cans. will benefit from growth and the
proliferation of technology in the
years to come.
"The U.S. has been sort of spoiled
by being powerful for so long," he said.
When Rose asked Gates about his
decision to drop out of Harvard,
Gates quickly interrupted to say that
he had only stopped out.

"My parents were very con
cerned." he reflected."lt seemed like a
big risk. It was one of those times that
went almost beyond numerical think
ing."
On his company's high-profile
competition with Google, Gates ac
knowledged that the two firms "over
lap a lot."
"This competition is a fun one for
both companies." he said. "You want
two companies with crucial mass tak
ing on tough problems."
When a graduate student in com
puter science pressed him about his

dim predictions that American stu
dents are falling behind in math and
computer-science education. Gates
showed his softer side.
"It's actually good for you "he told
the student. "Say there was only one
computer scientist. 'ITien we and
Google would bid, like, a billion dol
lars for you to come work for us."
Rose, who has interviewed Gates
nearly a dozen times,said the tech icon
was as energetic Wednesday as he had
ever seen him.
"He was engaged," he told The
Daily afterwards. "You could feel the

resonance that people were into what
he was saying."
The discussion with Gates was the
third panel of the day. In the morning,
Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang and Net
flix CEO Reed Hastings talked about
the future of innovation. Another
morning discussion focused on energy
alternatives and green technology.
John Doerr, a speaker on the
Going Green panel and a partner at
Kleiner. Perkins. Caufield and Byers.
said that he thought the global dimen
sion of the program made the pro
gram unique.

"It all comes together right here at
Stanford University," he said. "We re
at ground zero."
Gates is the public face of Mi
crosoft, a behemoth of a company that
some critics charge has passed its
prime. But Rose said Gates' passion
for his products and his company
showed when he spoke.
"I would never count Microsoft
out," Rose told The Daily. "I would
never count Bill Gates out in terms of
the end game. They have very good
second-half players. They know how
to play catch up."
