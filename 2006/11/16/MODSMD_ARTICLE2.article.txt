â€” BILL GATES,
founder of Microsoft

Computing today is still in its infancy, Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates told a full house at theTechNet
Innovation Summit in Memorial Auditorium yesterday
afternoon.
"The PC. that 1 dreamed about having for myself is
far better than what we offer now." Gates said, predict
ing his dream computer might be available within 15
years. "It's a time when all the large companies have
more opportunities than ever before."
In a wide-ranging one-hour discussion, the world's
richest man talked candidly with PBS anchor Charlie
Rose about his company's competition with Google, his
ambitious humanitarian agenda and America's relative
decline in economic power.

tem, set for public re

iPod a phenomenon
and said that the just
released Zune hand
held portable music
player has special fea
tures that make it wor

songs with friends.
While Microsoft came
late to video games, he

Xbox 360 will be the
best console in the in
dustry.
The 51 -year-old

he and his wife co

Melinda Gates Foun-

dation. Gates talked about foundation goals, ranging
from fighting malaria in Africa to improving charter
schools in America. With a pledge of $31 billion from
investor Warren Buffet this summer, the increasingly
influential foundation will be able to spend $3 billion a
year by 2009, Gates said.
"The opportunity is there, but you have to put the
pieces together in a different way than has been done
before," he added.

said he was hopeful that the foundation could have a
real impact.
