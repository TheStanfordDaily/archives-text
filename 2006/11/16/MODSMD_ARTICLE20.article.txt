# No doubting Paterno

### 
Just how many scary/odd mo
ments can one 79-year-old man
squeeze into a college football
season?
With Joe Paterno at the helm of
the Penn State football program for
the fortieth year. Nittany Lions fans,
as well as the rest of America, may
soon find out. Whether it's running
into the locker room in the middle of
a game or suffering a knee injury in
the ugliest such college injury I can
remember since Willis McCiahee, it
seems life is never (Kill for Joe Pa.
And that's exactly why he needs to
stay right where he is as a head
coach for a Div. I perennial power
house — for as long as he can. be
cause the N( AA needs more coach
es like Paterno.
Paterno told his team Tuesday to
expect him to slick around in I lappy


Griffin
Rants and Raves
Valley for some time yet. and knowl
edge of it got into the media Wednes
day Quicker than Sean Salisbury
leaping onto a Brett Favre retirement
rumor, the supposed issue was dis
sected from every conceivable angle,
except the one that really should mat
ter in a case like this.
If Paterno is still winning, why
shouldn't he stay for as long as he
likes? Granted, he's old, but so is Julio
Franco, and everyone seems to be
okay with that. And JoePa isn't even
asking to pinch-hit for the Mets; he's
just trying to glare and yell at people
from the sidelines like he's been
doing for most of his life.
Maybe it's time people stop trying
to subtly hint that it's time for JoePa
to go and start marveling at who he is
and what he's done.
1%6. That's when Paterno took
the head coaching position in I lappy
Valley, and that's where he's been
ever since. He's seen 40 years of col
lege athletes come and go, weathered
good seasons and bad — but mostly
good. That's the kind of coach he is:
solid, consistent and dedicated. Con
sider that he's been coaching as long
as he has,and you have to ask yourself
whether he hasn't earned the right to
stay as long as he likes.
Maybe only Paterno could single
handedly keep a Pennsylvania school
a choice destination for the best re
cruits in the country. Joe Pas influ
ence is such a huge factor for incom
ing freshmen that opposing programs
have for years tried to sway talent by
warning them that an aging Paterno
would surely retire soon. So far. they
haven't been right.

More amazing still. Paterno may
be the last living man with a direct (al
beit coincidental) link toVince Lom
bardi. l'he famed Packer legend
coached against a team on which Pa
terno played in high school — and if
that doesn't illustrate the kind of his
tory Paterno has witnessed and expe
rienced since first playing for Brown
in 1944, then nothing can.
Besides, the "Really Ol' Ball
Coach" is still gunning for Bobby
Bowden's record for career wins, and
given the state of Bowden's Semi
noles,the three-game discrepancy be
tween Joe Pa's 361 victories as a col
lege head coach and Bowden's 364
seems like less of an obstacle every
day.
Can it really be that some think
Penn State would be better off with
out Paterno? Especially following
last year's Orange Bowl victory over
the previously mentioned 'Noles of
Bobby Bowden, it seems clear that
JoePa has yet to lose his touch, even
though he is roughly 60 years older
than the players he coaches. He still
earns their respect, and the game has
yet to pass him by because he's never
left it.
But NCAA football needs him as
an icon too, and moreover as a propo
nent for the kind of change that's nec
essary for the sport to truly thrive in
this century, just as it did in Paterno's.
An advocate of a playoff system and
of players earning a small salary in
college. JoePa is proof that tradition
and change are not mutually exclu
sive options.
So, if he wants to, let JoePa be the
Strom Thurmond of college football
— you know, without the history of
racism. Football and Penn State are
definitely better off with him.
