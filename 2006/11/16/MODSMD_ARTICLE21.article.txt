Air Force 79

But last night at Maples Pavilion, the Air Force Acade
my whipped the Cardinal 79-45, advancing to face Duke
next Monday in the CM Classic semifinals.
"We got exposed a little worse than I thought," Coach
I rent lohnson said. "I'm surprised. I'm surprised that they
could come here and beat lis like they did."
ITie ('ardinal lust the game on the defensive end,allow
ing Air I orce to shoot 71 percent (17-of-24) in the first half
and 55 percent (2K-of 51) overall.including 42 percent (10-
ol 24) on three pointers. Air I orce's players were general
ly slower and smaller, but their Princeton-style offense of
screens, picks and backdoor cuts blew the Cardinal de
fenders out of the water.
"It was a good old fashioned tail-whooping," Coach
Johnson said."lt didn't seem like they missed. For us,what
ever we did. I thought we were a step slow defensively at
every position."
Ihe Falcons positioned center Niek Welch (13 points)
on the perimeter, forcing freshman center Robin Lopez
out of the paint to defend. With the seven-foot shot-block
ing machine 20 feet away from the basket, the Falcons ex
ploited the remaining Stanford defenders' youth, cutting
to the hoop for eas\ passes and uncontested buckets with

the Cardinal defender often 10 feet away.
Though Stanford had a talent edge, the experience dif
ferential pointed in Air Force's direction just as promi
nently. The Falcons started four seniors and a junior, while
senior forward 1 red Washington and junior forward Taj
I inger were the only upperclassmen of the eight Cardinal
who saw at least 15 minutes. Postgame, Coach Johnson ex
cused his freshmen and sophomores for their defensive
lapses, but called out his upperclassmen. l inger in particu
lar.
"The disappointing thing for me was Taj — who has
been in this program for years and is a perfect defensive
match-up — and [sophomore) Lawrence [Hill] who is also
a good match-up for their style. Those are the guys where
we got hurt."
After a quick Robin Lopez (10 points, 8 rebounds)
layup gave their Cardinal a 2-0 lead, their only edge of the
evening. Air Force responded with a 20-4 spurt to take a
14-point lead seven minutes in.
"They set the tone and we never recovered." sopho
more guard Mitch Johnson said."We were on our heels the
whole game."
The Falcons ended the first half ahead 45-21, with for
ward Jacob Burtschi (24 points, 10-of-15 shooting, 12 re
bounds) singlehandedly outscoring the Cardinal with 22
points, en route to MVP honors for the Classic. Air Force
burst out of halftime with an 8-2 run in just two minutes,
and the rout was on.
" Iliey ran at full speed and knew exactly where they
were supposed to be." said sophomore guard Anthony
Goods (seven points. 3-of-14 shooting). "I felt we didn't
come prepared. We knew Air Force was a very good team."
Ihe Cardinal compounded their defensive collapse
with an offensive meltdown,finishing the game 30 percent
(lfi-of-53) from the field and 12 percent (2-of-l7) beyond
the arc. despite a decent number of open looks. Air Force
