## Better Late than Never History worth more than ring 
### 
Here we go again. The tenth
week of the Ni l. season ap
proaehes and amongst the
divisional race dramas, T.O. cover
age and "Ocho Cinco" salsa ing his
way out of the playoffs, the Indi
anapolis Colts are again undefeat
ed. But this time, as if not to jinx it.
America doesn't seem to care ;is
much.
The reason? It's old hat. The
Colts win a bunch of games to start
the season, lose one late, pick up
some momentum going into the
playoffs and lose. Which is why I
s;iy. forget what all the r.SPN ana
lysts say. Peyton and Coach Dungy,
don't go for the Super Bowl. (io for
perfection.
Sure, winning a Super Bowl
would silence all the critics that say
Manning isn't quite an elite qua)
terback until he wins the big one.
And it might quiet those that say
that defenses have figured out how
to stop their not so-vaunted aerial
attack. But then again, winning a
Super Bowl isn't all that.
Wait, wait, before the hate mail
starts coining saying I've blas
phemed (yes, that's a word. I was as
surprised as you are): think about it.
Try and name the last live Super
Bowl winners. Impressive if you
can. Now try the last ten. Exactly.
As much as the Super Bowl is an
incredible event with a ton of histo
ry behind it.it happens every year.
A team goes through a season,
makes a run in the playoffs and wins
the Super Bowl. Within weeks there
is talk of free agency, and the new
season is more or less in session.
The winners of the past year have
no time to revel in their victory.
And now compare a Super Bowl
victory to an undefeated season.
Any football fan that knows Steve
F.ntman from Steve Young knows
about the 11>72l l >72 Miami Dolphins.
You'd need ESPN's The Schwab to
name the 1974 or 11>57l l >57 or lf>s4 or
any other year's Super Bowl
champs.
Let's look at the remaining
schedule for the Colts. I lome games
against an overrated Philadelphia
team and a floundering Cincinnati
squad. Away games against an im
proving (but still very young) Ten
nessee team, a Jacksonville team
that's lost hope for the season and
the always-hapless I louston Texans.
And of course there's the home fi
nale against the Miami Dolphins,
who despite stud Joey I larrington's
thoughts of a 9-0 finish, will prove
to be little challenge.
The schedule will definitely
allow it if the Colts decide they
want to go for the undefeated sea
son. rhe only question is whether
or not Tony Dungy decides to keep
his starters in for the rest of the
season even when home field ad
vantage may be wrapped up.
Knowing Dungy's past history it
seems most likely that he'll put the
Super Bowl ring over the unde
feated record.
So here's a plea directly to you.
Coach Dungy: Set a new precedent.
Screw Super Bowls, or for that mat
ter. World Series rings. NBA cham
pionships, World Cups. With the
way sports seasons turn over and
how little time there is between the
pinnacle ol the season and the start,
championships are fleeting.
Records are forever.
