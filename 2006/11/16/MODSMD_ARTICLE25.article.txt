# CAMPUS LIFE
## Sustainability efforts heat up on campus Administration and student groups unite 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the old saying goes, "It's not
easy bein' green."
But with the newly formed Sus
tainability Working Group, both the
University administration and student
grassroots efforts are collaborating to
maximize environmental sustainabili
ty on campus, pushing reforms that
balance economic, social equity and
environmental concerns.
A new initiative to build a "green"
dorm is one of many projects atop the
environmental agenda. If completed,
the Row House would house 47 stu
dents and act as a hub for sustainabili
ty research. Currently, however, the
project is on hold due to funding con
cerns.
The Sustainability Working Group,
which is comprised of several experts,
faculty, staff and environmentally
conscious students, will hash out pro
gram and policy ideas in the upcom
ing months and provide the Provost
with a list of recommendations by the
end of the academic year, said
Therese Brekke, sustainability proj
ect manager for the Land Use and
Environmental Planning Depart
ment. The close interaction between
the Provost, faculty and students re
flects the University's enhanced com
mitment to promoting sustainability
under The Stanford Challenge's Ini
tiative on the Environment and Sus
tainability.
"The concept of sustainability in
tegrates environmental, economic
and social equity considerations,"
Brekke said. "Faculty have an impor
tant role to play educating students
and conducting research in these crit
ical subject areas."
University divisions are presently
making strides in the areas of water
conservation, energy efficiency, re
newable energy and building con
struction. Under the recent water
conservation project, officials in
stalled lower water use toilets
throughout campus and improved
landscaping and irrigation parts to
save a total of 0.0124 million gallons
of water per day, said Marty Laporte,
environmental quality manger for the
Facilities Operations-Utilities De
partment.
Officials also installed solar-energy
arrays at three sites, including one at
Synergy and another atop Reservoir
Two, which has produced 46,500

k Wh/vear in solar energy,according to
energy engineer Scott Gould of the
same department.
Additionally, the Transportation
Demand Management program,
which offers travelers the VTA Eco
Pass and the Caltrain GO Passes, has
successfully reduced the percentage of
single-occupant vehicles commuting
to campus from 72 percent to 55 per
cent in 2006, according to their Web
site.
Senior Emma Yuen, president of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford
(SSS), praised the University's efforts,
but said that even more needs to be
done.

"By having Stanford become
more sustainable, we gain
integrity and moral standing."

"I think that these programs are
definitely helpful," Yuen said. "But
their scope is very small, with a group
of lighting fixtures here, a refrigerator
retrofit there. 1 feel that the adminis
trators need to be supported by more
funding and a strong environmental
commitment stated by President Hen
nessy. ITiis would transform these
extra projects into mainstream 'this is
how we do it here' approach."
Several groups are mobilizing to go
the extra mile. SSS is currently lobby
ing University administrators to adopt
a "mini" Kyoto Treaty and reduce car
bon emissions on campus by 10 per
cent from their 1990 levels by 2020.
Sophomore Emily Humphreys
said she is hopeful that the University
will continue to dedicate itself to sus
tainability and broaden its reach with
new programs.
"It's wonderful that so many differ
ent divisions at Stanford are taking
steps to reduce their energy foot
print." she said. "Energy efficiency
clearly saves money, so I hope that
more department leaders will follow
suit and implement more projects."
Yuen added that the goal should be
to spread sustainability projects be
yond the Farm.
"Stanford is an enormous institu
tion that consumes many resources
and is also a model for organizations,
so the impact here is great." Yuen said.
