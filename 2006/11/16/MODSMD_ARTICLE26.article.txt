## Achievement gaps only grow 
### HELEN SIMS 
Seven years after former governor Gray Davis'
comprehensive school reforms, California's over
all test scores are improving but achievement gaps
are growing in some grades, according to a new
study released by a joint Stanford and Berkeley
think tank.
Policy Analysis for California Education
(PACE) measures California schools' test scores
every five years. Its latest report,"Crucial Issues
in California Education 2006: Rekindling Re
form." announced yesterday that achievement
gaps have grown in middle schools and have not
declined in elementary schools. PACE also re
ports that based on national standards, the num
ber of students performing proficiently in read
ing at the fourth- and eighth-grade levels has re
mained stagnant as well.
According to the report, the achievement gap
between eighth graders of middle-class families
who were proficient in English language arts and
those of poor families has risen by five percentage
points. In 2(X)3. the number of students from mid
dle-class families who were proficient was 28 per
centage points greater than that of students from
poor families. In 2006. the gap increased to 33 per
centage points. In math, the gap has grown by two
percentage points.
"We now see that rules and penalties hitting
many schools don't motivate educators and stu
dents in the long run." said Bruce Fuller, a UC-
Berkeley professor of education and public policy
contributing to the study, in a press release. "Sacra
mento expects educators to deliver world-class
educational standards on a third-world budget."

However, it may be that California also has a
less stringent set of standards. According to the re
port, about 1.000 schools meet California test stan
dards, but not those of national tests.
"Washington is further complicating accounta
bility reforms, failing to reward schools that show
robust progress in boosting student achievement,"
Fuller said. According to PACE, California
has not only the most students, but also the most
diverse bunch of them in the nation. Sixty-five per
cent are minorities, while schools house 35 percent
more students than the national average, accord
ing to 2005 figures. I lowever, these numbers alone
are not sufficient to explain California's growing
achievement gap.
"We cannot blame stalling test scores on the
demographics of our kids," Fuller said. "Our re
search team suggests that accountability with crisp
incentives for growth, freeing up school principals
from layers of regulation and stronger resources
overall would rekindle California's reform mo
mentum."
The PACE analysts recommended four addi
tional policy changes to address the problem.They
suggested refocusing government leaders in
Sacramento to better track district and school per
formance, simplifying and clarifying school fi
nances. creating a program specifically geared to
wards boosting the performance of ESL students
and aiming to renew gains in schools with lower
performance ratings. The report commended
Governor Schwarzenegger and the California
state teachers unions for budgeting $2.6 billion to
school aid in low-income and blue-collar commu
nities, a definite first step toward possible im
provement.
