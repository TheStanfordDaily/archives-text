## For co-existence in Israel, a call to humanity 
### TRANGDAI TRANGUYEN 
In today's global neighborhood, the existence of
cultural diversity is a sure fact, but in areas like Israel
beleaguered by armed conflict, this reality does not
come without significant humanitarian effort.
Such was the focus of yesterday's talk, "Jews and
Arabs in Israel: My Life of Building Co-Existence in
Israel's Multi-Cultural Society," organized by the
Stanford Israel Alliance, Hillel at Stanford and the
Jewish Community Relations Council.
In front of a handful of Stanford students and
local community members. Dr. Sigal Chirug shared

firsthand accounts of her experience as an Israeli
born physician who served the multi-ethnic commu
nity of Galilee.
Chirug recounted her experiences as a resident
since 1979 of Ma'alot, a mixed Jewish-Arab town lo
cated eight miles from the border with Lebanon.
Ma'alot is a very unusual place not just in Israel, but
in the world.
"There is a common municipality within our vil
lage," she said. "We have a Jewish mayor and a Jew
ish-Christian vice-mayor. The two communities
share life together — the everyday life."
She was keen to point out the strictly divided au

tonomy of each ethnic group.
"There are two communities, each with its own
schools and culture," she said. Chirug works in
the clinic in the tourist town of West Galilee. For al
most 18 years, she has served the municipal Ma'alot
and its surroundings. Twice a week, she goes to a
small Christian Arab village north of Ma'alot three
miles from the border and spends two hours there
each visit.
In serving such a diverse and divided community,
Chirug noted the importance of going beyond estab-
lishing professional relations to
make connections at the human
level.
"1 meet with families and chil
dren and get to know them very
closelyshe said. "You get invited to
weddings and funerals."
Chirug noted that the most re
cent time when these bonds of hu
manity were especially brought out
and tested was during the war this
summer, when Galilee was bombed.
"It wasn't just Jews or one group
that suffered," she said. "We all did."
The clinic became a site for natu
ral co-existence of the residents, not
as neighbors of different origins, but
as all the same humans.
With no grounded hospital infra
structure and lack of transportation,
Chirug and her husband slipped into
a purely voluntary mode, curing pa
tients within the clinics and, at times,
going off to search for the needy on
the streets.
Il is this kind of blind devotion to
humanity, transcending different
roots, that makes diversity feasible,
according to Chirug. For her. the
agent of change is in each of us.
"Even inside the Jewish commu
nity, there are many classes — like
everywhere else in the world."
Chirug said. "In the clinic, I can do
my best to respect and serve all dif
ferent communities, regardless of
where they come from."
