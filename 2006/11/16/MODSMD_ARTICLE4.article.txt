## Back again, Governator shares plans Re-elected governor offers preview of second term in a surprise visit 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
In a surprise campus visit, Arnold Schwarzenegger previewed
what will likely be the priorities of his second term yesterday.
The governor trumpeted his first-term accomplishments and
told a technology forum in a packed Memorial Auditorium that
California was once again on the right track.
"For the first time in years, the people are seeing tangible re
sults from state government." Schwarzenegger said. "Of course,
we still have many tough challenges for 2007 and way beyond
that."
Schwarzenegger met with Bill Gates, a participant in the
Tech Net Innovation Summit,for 15 minutes after his speech.The
governor then had lunch in the Lou I lenry I loover building, ad
jacent to Hoover Tower, with fellows from the think tank.
"We're delighted to have him back after his re-election," said
President John Hennessy.
The governor, wearing a soft green tie, struck a posi
tive tone and joked with technology leaders and Stan
ford students about recent weight gains.
The Governator had the swagger hack in his step after
trouncing Democrat Phil Angelides in last week's guber
natorial election. Schwarzenegger previewed the high
lights of his post-election agenda and indicated he will be
prepared to spend his political capital on potentially con
troversial measures like redistricting.
"We must have political reform," he said. "The people
demand honest government and competitive legislative
districts so that politicians can never take their con
stituents for granted."
He also echoed some of the recurring themes from
stump speeches throughout his campaign.
"We still have to fix health care to come up with new
and efficient ways that people really need," he said. "We
have to make education more accountable, provide par
ents with more information so that parents can really
choose the best schools for their children."
Schwarzenegger campaigned with the Democratic
leadership in the legislature to pass a series of bonds on
the Nov. 7 ballot.
"1 was determined that California would get back its
shine and its status as the most wonderful place in the
world, that we could become again the Golden State," he
said, standing behind a mahogany podium and Hanked
by a Californian and American Hag. "Voters responded
overwhelmingly and approved this record investment of
$42 billion in California's future."
The state's 37 million residents, he said, are using an
infrastructure intended for 20 million.
"Now the most important thing is we've got to start
rebuilding California." he said. "As soon as the money
becomes available, 1 want to build, build and build be
cause 1 want to see cranes everywhere in California."
While the governor communicated a positive mes
sage about his vision for the future of California, the
state's nonpartisan legislative analyst warned Wednes
day that the state will have a $5.5 billion deficit next year.
These budgetary challenges, expected to last through the
end of the decade, will certainly pose problems for the
governor.
But fiscal concerns seemed far from the governor's
mind yesterday.
"California is building, and California is leading," he
said. "As a matter of fact. California is number one
again."
