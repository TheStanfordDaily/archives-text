## Farmer cites service as key to a healthy globe Co-founder of Peers in Health speaks on medical advances and poverty 
### MIKE DING 
In "An Evening with Dr. Paul Farmer," the co-founder of the
world health-care organization Peers in I lealth (PIH). argued for
increased implementation of University funding and resources in
aiding poverty-stricken people around the world, relating his own
experiences in this pursuit.
Hosted by ASSU Speaker's Bureau. FACT. AIDS and Dance
Marathon, Farmer attracted an overflow crowd last night at
Memorial Auditorium, where he opened by stressing the impor
tance of education in improving world health.
"We need a paradigm shift in the institutions of higher learn
ing," Farmer said, displaying a pie chart illustrating the minimal
amounts of university funding that does not go to either research
or education. "We need to start thinking more about service."
Farmer is no stranger to service. As an M.D./Ph.D candidate at
Harvard University, he successfully engineered a program that
provided first-rate health care to the most impoverished regions
of Ilaiti.
"My favorite teacher is not a person, but rather a place known
as Haiti." he said. "I first began working in Haiti at
a small settlement which had been forced by the
construction of a dam to move from a comfortable
setting to arid lands. This place had no real hospi
tal or clinic, no modern pharmacy or modern
wards."
Farmer and his colleagues proceeded to bor
row $2 million from a Boston bank to invest into
the public sector of Haiti in the creation of better
clinics and the training of local individuals to effec
tively treat their disease-stricken neighbors,confi
dent but not assured of a matching donation to off
set that loan.
Ihe results of these actions were made plain for
the audience when Farmer flashed a picture of a
skeletal man on his PowerPoint projection, whom
he identified as Joseph, and then a normal, healthy,
smiling Joseph after he had received the medical
treatment from PIH.
ITiough his methods had been successful.

Farmer said many doubted his ability to expand
this success beyond only one rural setting.
"Critics would ask us. now that we had provid
ed medical care to a small settlement in Haiti, if
our efforts could be scaled up." he said. "We an
swered by expanding of high-quality medical care
to areas all across central Haiti. Then we were
challenged to extend beyond the confines of a sin
gle nation.This we answered as well and today we
work in numerous locations all around the world."
From Boston to Rwanda, Farmer and PI 11 have
spread their system of universally free, communi
ty-based medical care through the public sector.
But Farmer admitted many problems must still
be solved to make proper health care for the poor
a reality.
"Look at the wonderful innovations in the
biotechnology sector today," he said. "There are so
many new discoveries for treating all kinds of ill
nesses. But there's a kind of bottleneck effect on

these new resources and methods because they
aren't reaching the poor. We need to have a strate
gy that will put these fruits of scientific labor into
the hands of those who need them the most."
Another hurdle Farmer discussed was the inef
fective approach many private sector non-govern
mental agencies bring in medical care to the poor.
"If you approach the provision of medical
treatments for diseases such as AIDS from the pri
vate sector, you will find that many of those who
need treatment the most cannot afford it."he said.
A central tenet of PlH's system of community
clinics is cooperation with local governmental
agencies when addressing medical challenges
from the public sector.
"If you work through the public sector, if you
insist that these medical techniques and supplies
ought to be public goods." he said, "then the right
to treatment for AIDS and other diseases be
comes a right."
