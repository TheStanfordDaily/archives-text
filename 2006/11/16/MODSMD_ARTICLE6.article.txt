# DISTRIBUTION ON CAMPUS
## Lack of publicity stirs confusion Revotes leave residents uncertain about publication distribution 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA 
Door-to-door or centralized?
Ibis is the question several students faced when
voting on the publication-distribution policy for
their dorms during the second week of fall quarter.
However, contusion ensued when the poll for this
policy was re-opened a couple weeks later without
official notification. Due to lack of knowledge of
flipped policies, many dorm residents were dis
mayed to find publications once again sitting in

front of their doors.
"I got an email saying that they were voting
again, and 1 was confused as to if my previous vote
was counted or if 1 was supposed to vote again,"
said freshman James I lilton. who lives in Branner.
Director of Residential Education Jane Camar
illo explained that the revote happened for one of
two reasons: either the vote for the distribution pol
icy was tied or the dorm had only cast between one
and five votes.
"We contacted houses with these small numbers
and asked if they had used the on-line voting tool
and some had not," Camarillo said. "Others were
surprised at the low turnout and felt it was due to

the publicity."
Branner, one of such dorms, was
originally designated as having a
centralized distribution policy. Cen
tralized distribution calls for publi
cations to be placed in the racks in
the lobby of each dorm, whereas
door-to-door distribution allows for
various publications to be delivered
directly to residents' rooms.
But with the polls reopened.
Branner and others have been
switched to a door-to-door policy â€”
to the surprise of many residents.
Despite efforts to publicize this vot
ing schedule through residential
mailing lists, an ASSU e-flyer. word
of mouth and visits of some editori
al staffs to house meetings, several
dorms seemed to have missed the
message.

With the hulk of residents under
the impression that the centralized
distribution policy was still in place,
the off-campus pamphlets from the
Christian Association PAX sitting
underneath their doors caused some
residents confusion and annoyance.
"That kind of pissed me off wak
ing up," said freshman Cameron
Drake, complaining about the viola
tion of their original policy. "I just
woke up and was like.'Who slid stuff
that I don't care about under my
door?' We are not going to read it, so
we have to throw it away and fill up
our garbage can. It doesn't give you
a choice."
Some students see door-to-door
distribution as burdensome as it
forces them to deal with unwanted
publications.
"1 thought getting the pamphlets
in my door was a nuisance," Hilton
said. "If there was something specif
ic that I wanted, I can just walk down
and get it.That way I feel like I'm not
wasting it. because those that don't

want it will just throw it out."
Toyon and Otero face similar
concerns with their distribution pol
icy. In Toyon, The Stanford Review
delivered its papers to individual
dorm rooms while the distribution
policy was still centralized. Al
though Resident Assistants (RAs)
found the situation frustrating, some
residents didn't seem to mind the
door-to-door technique.
"1 think it's fine," said senior
Vanessa Guizman. "I would not
make the effort to go get it if it was
centralized."
Yet the unresolved problem left
redundant RAs and many residents
clueless to this second polling and
subsequent status changes.
Branner RA Hershey Avula, a
junior and ASSU senator, found the
situation irritating and demanded
clarification.
"For me, it is kind of frustrating,"
Avula said. "There is a lack of com
munication as to what the results are
because there was a set of results

originally that the staff had looked
at, and now there is a new set of re
sults. And it's just confusion and it
should be resolved by winter quar
ter."
The current distribution protocol
was determined this past summer by
the Publications Distribution
Group. The group plans to re-evalu
ate its current system in May for im
provements. On the top of the pile of
fixes lies increased publicity to pre
clude any more confusion.
"Of course, we plan to increase
the publicity of the voting schedule
next year," said Camarillo. "It would
be important to send reminders as to
the deadline for the vote, as well as
quick links that would take students
directly to the online voting site.
Feedback will be solicited through
an online survey from residential
students, staff of student publica
tions, residential staff and staff of
student housing to determine the
impact of greater publicity for stu
dent publications."
