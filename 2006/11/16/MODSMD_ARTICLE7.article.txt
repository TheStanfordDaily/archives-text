### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
In his 1976 Ph.D. thesis. Paul Worden
proposed a satellite experiment that could
possibly disrupt the physics world. Thirty
years later, that project has grown into the
Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle
(STEP) and is closer to being launched than
it ever has been. On Tuesday. David King,

Worden. now co-principal investigator
for STEP, wanted to launch a satellite into
space to test Einstein's Theory of General
Relativity, which had been questioned due

STEP has designed a two-meter-long satel

STEP is now seeking the funds to build and
launch the satellite.
NASA, which is funding STEP's current
