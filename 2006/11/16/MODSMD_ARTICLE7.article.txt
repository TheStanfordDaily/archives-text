## NASA funding to reach stars? Stanford's Satellite project needs more help to launch 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
In his 1976 Ph.D. thesis. Paul Worden
proposed a satellite experiment that could
possibly disrupt the physics world. Thirty
years later, that project has grown into the
Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle
(STEP) and is closer to being launched than
it ever has been. On Tuesday. David King,
the head of NASA's Marshall Space Flight
Center (MSFC) and John Horrack. Manag

er of Science and Mission Systems at Mar
shall. made an all-day visit to the ST I P of
fices to see if NASA would consider giving
them the funding they need to reach the
stars.
Worden. now co-principal investigator
for STEP, wanted to launch a satellite into
space to test Einstein's Theory of General
Relativity, which had been questioned due
to experimental inconsistencies. Today.
STEP has designed a two-meter-long satel
lite that will remain in orbit for six months.
STEP is now seeking the funds to build and
launch the satellite.
NASA, which is funding STEP's current
research, grew more interested in
giving further funding to the satel
lite after the launch of Gravity
Probe-B (GPB).a previous collabo
ration between Stanford and
NASA. Rodney Torii, co-principal
investigator for STEP, felt that the
visit went well.
"There are a number of projects
at the MSFC, but David King is cer
tainly very interested in seeing the
science happen," Torii said. "Since
GPB is ending and I don't believe
that there are that many fundamen
tal science measures planned for
Marshall, he came out here to get a
better idea of both Marshall's role
and Stanford's."
Torii was optimistic about King's
reaction.
"He was very interested and pos
itive about the science, and it's prob
ably very safe to say that after com
ing to Stanford and seeing what it
was all about, he's still very excited
about the STEP project,"Torii said.
The science involved is the
Equivalence Principle (EP), one of
the core facts about gravity that
every schoolchild takes for granted.
For Einstein.it was one of the planks
of the Theory of General Relativity.
Under the EP, the acceleration of a
body in a given point in space due to
gravity does not depend on its mass
or shape. It is a lesson that Galileo

learned when he dropped the two
cannonballs off the Leaning Tower
of Pisa.
However, Einstein's theory of
gravity breaks down at the quantum
level, where it has to interact with
very small particles. Torii said that
the project is looking for informa
tion about the various competing
theories.
"We're basically studying gravi
ty," Torii said. "There is a grand idea
that inertial mass and gravitational
mass are the same thing even though
they're measured and thought of
completely differently. If that grand
idea is not true, then general relativ
ity is not true. Now there are other
theories of gravity, most of which
rely on a violation of the equiva
lence principle."
STEP proposes to give the prin
ciple its most rigorous test to date by
placing two nested masses in a drag
free satellite in orbit around the
earth. Since orbit is a state of con
stant free-fall around the earth, the
satellite will fall for six months, al
lowing researchers to record even
miniscule differences in accelera
tion.
According to Torii, ground-based
experiments only measure differ
ences up to 1 part in 1() A 13, since the
earth's magnetic field varies and
minute seismic differences can skew
the results. In space, the background
noise is reduced by a factor of 1,000
and measurements are also 1,000
times more sensitive, allowing STEP
to get up to 1 part in 10 A lB. Many al
ternate theories of gravitation state

that the Equivalence Principle
breaks down at around this level.
STEP has had to travel a long
road to get this far. Initial research
was funded by a seed grant from
NASA, enough to support a few stu
dents. with the tiny possibility that it
would someday become a satellite
mission. After they started to run
out of NASA funds in the 1980s.
STEP looked to the European
Space Agency, which was running a
contest for scientific satellite mis
sions. I"he mission made the final
cut, but narrowly lost out to another
project.
According to Worden, the team
then went back to the drawing board
and designed successively leaner
and cheaper versions of the project.
"We came back to the states and
redesigned the satellite that we had
done for the European version of
STEP in a simpler form with the in
tent of making it into a more doable
experiment and saving a lot of
money on it."he said. "The version
we came up with for the ESA had a
lot of co-experiments on it to make it
more sellable. It included several
very esoteric physics experiments in
addition to the basic STEP experi
ment, which made it very expensive."
The team is approximately 18
months away from completing a
flight prototype. Their transition af
terward to the flight project, howev
er, is stumped by a $100 million price
tag, according to STEP's Web site.
Without continued funding from
NASA, it will be impossible to fully
proceed.

months away from completing a
flight prototype. Their transition af

In his 1976 Ph.D. thesis. Paul Worden
proposed a satellite experiment that could
possibly disrupt the physics world. Thirty
years later, that project has grown into the
Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle
(STEP) and is closer to being launched than
it ever has been. On Tuesday. David King,
the head of NASA's Marshall Space Flight
Center (MSFC) and John Horrack. Manag

er of Science and Mission Systems at Mar
shall. made an all-day visit to the ST I P of
fices to see if NASA would consider giving
them the funding they need to reach the
stars.
Worden. now co-principal investigator
for STEP, wanted to launch a satellite into
space to test Einstein's Theory of General
Relativity, which had been questioned due
to experimental inconsistencies. Today.
STEP has designed a two-meter-long satel
lite that will remain in orbit for six months.
STEP is now seeking the funds to build and
launch the satellite.
NASA, which is funding STEP's current
research, grew more interested in
giving further funding to the satel
lite after the launch of Gravity
Probe-B (GPB).a previous collabo
ration between Stanford and
NASA. Rodney Torii, co-principal
investigator for STEP, felt that the
visit went well.
"There are a number of projects
at the MSFC, but David King is cer
tainly very interested in seeing the
science happen," Torii said. "Since
GPB is ending and I don't believe
that there are that many fundamen
tal science measures planned for
Marshall, he came out here to get a
better idea of both Marshall's role
and Stanford's."
Torii was optimistic about King's
reaction.
"He was very interested and pos
itive about the science, and it's prob
ably very safe to say that after com
ing to Stanford and seeing what it
was all about, he's still very excited
about the STEP project,"Torii said.
The science involved is the
Equivalence Principle (EP), one of
the core facts about gravity that
every schoolchild takes for granted.
For Einstein.it was one of the planks
of the Theory of General Relativity.
Under the EP, the acceleration of a
body in a given point in space due to
gravity does not depend on its mass
or shape. It is a lesson that Galileo

learned when he dropped the two
cannonballs off the Leaning Tower
of Pisa.
However, Einstein's theory of
gravity breaks down at the quantum
level, where it has to interact with
very small particles. Torii said that
the project is looking for informa
tion about the various competing
theories.
"We're basically studying gravi
ty," Torii said. "There is a grand idea
that inertial mass and gravitational
mass are the same thing even though
they're measured and thought of
completely differently. If that grand
idea is not true, then general relativ
ity is not true. Now there are other
theories of gravity, most of which
rely on a violation of the equiva
lence principle."
STEP proposes to give the prin
ciple its most rigorous test to date by
placing two nested masses in a drag
free satellite in orbit around the
earth. Since orbit is a state of con
stant free-fall around the earth, the
satellite will fall for six months, al
lowing researchers to record even
miniscule differences in accelera
tion.
According to Torii, ground-based
experiments only measure differ
ences up to 1 part in 1() A 13, since the
earth's magnetic field varies and
minute seismic differences can skew
the results. In space, the background
noise is reduced by a factor of 1,000
and measurements are also 1,000
times more sensitive, allowing STEP
to get up to 1 part in 10 A lB. Many al
ternate theories of gravitation state

that the Equivalence Principle
breaks down at around this level.
STEP has had to travel a long
road to get this far. Initial research
was funded by a seed grant from
NASA, enough to support a few stu
dents. with the tiny possibility that it
would someday become a satellite
mission. After they started to run
out of NASA funds in the 1980s.
STEP looked to the European
Space Agency, which was running a
contest for scientific satellite mis
sions. I"he mission made the final
cut, but narrowly lost out to another
project.
According to Worden, the team
then went back to the drawing board
and designed successively leaner
and cheaper versions of the project.
"We came back to the states and
redesigned the satellite that we had
done for the European version of
STEP in a simpler form with the in
tent of making it into a more doable
experiment and saving a lot of
money on it."he said. "The version
we came up with for the ESA had a
lot of co-experiments on it to make it
more sellable. It included several
very esoteric physics experiments in
addition to the basic STEP experi
ment, which made it very expensive."
The team is approximately 18
months away from completing a
flight prototype. Their transition af
terward to the flight project, howev
er, is stumped by a $100 million price
tag, according to STEP's Web site.
