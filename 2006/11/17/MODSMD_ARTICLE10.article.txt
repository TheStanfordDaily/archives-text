## University president discusses fundraising drive, football woes 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
President John llennessy sat down with The Daily yes
terday to talk about The Stanford Challenge, early admis
sion and the football team's struggles.The transcript, edited
only for length, follows.
The Stanford Daily: A couple of weeks ago, you unveiled
the $4.3 billion Stanford Challenge. What about the project
most excites you?
John llennessy: What most excites me is the opportunity to
position Stanford in a way that it can have, both through its
research and its teaching, a more positive and larger impact
on the world and the challenges we face as human beings
around the world.
The Daily: II ow did the idea of starting this multibillion
dollar drive come to fruition?
Ill: It actually began shortly after I took the job as the pres
ident and we began a series of University-planning activi
ties led by faculty committees across the University to
whom we posed the question, "What is Stanford well-posi
tioned to do and where are there really opportunities to
make more significant contributions than we're able to
make today?" That was the beginning. Planning went over
many years obviously, as did refining it from a vague set of
topics to actually instituting mechanisms by which we can
implement them.
The Daily: 1 low do you think the Challenge will affect cur
rent students?
.Ill: As with any fundraising campaign, it will play out over
a period of time, but it will certainly touch existing students
in a number of different ways. Obviously, our financial-aid
goals for both undergraduates and graduates are things that
will affect the current generation of students. 1 think some
of the new programs which we will start initially probably in
experimental fashion, in pilots, but we might contemplate
making permanent if they're successful, will affect this gen-
eration of students. A lot of the cam
paign will go to buildings, which ob
viously won't be built for five to ten
years.
The Daily: You mentioned a couple
of pilot programs that current stu
dents might see.
JH: ITie initial set we've launched
are primarily graduate programs,
though there are a number of coter
minal students in them as well. But
we've launched some pilot programs
that are sort of the graduate counter
part to Sophomore College — sum
mer institutes designed to give stu
dents the option to take something
different than what they take over
the academic year. So this summer,
we piloted one in the Business
School, one in the Design Institute
and one in genetics, run by faculty in
the Med School, all designed to be
taken outside of students in that im
mediate area.
And the loan forgiveness pro
gram is going to start right away.This
is a program designed for graduate
loans, immediately targeted for stu
dents who are coterminal in the
STEP program in the School of Edu
cation who go on to become teachers
in kindergarten through twelfth
grade. Because we don't have very
much financial aid at all for things
which are professional masters level,
this is designed to support those who
go onto the noble call of teaching.
The Daily: Y bu've mentioned finan
cial aid. Why didn't the University
offer international financial aid up to
this point and why is it offering it
now?
.Ill: I think the primary reason we
didn't do it is we couldn't afford it.
We didn't have a funding source for
it. I think we're certainly looking to
raise money to try to improve it so
we could go need-blind on interna
tional students. 1 think our motiva
tion is simply to try to slightly in
crease the number of international
students. We're not looking for a sig
nificant increase, but maybe a small
increase. That would provide us with
the opportunity to have a more di
verse student population in a geo
graphical sense. My goal is. 1 think
not only can we play a role in educat
ing people who are going to play a
role in leadership positions around
the world, but also, equally impor
tantly. we have the opportunity for
I S. undergraduates to be in a setting
where there are those students from
around the world and they have the
opportunity to hear their viewpoints
and share some of their experiences.
I always tell the undergraduates that
they're going to learn a tremendous
amount from their fellow students
and that's one reason we want to
have a diverse student body and 1
think that certainly includes interna
tional diversity.
The number of international stu
dents we currently have is limited
primarily by financial aid. Our fami
ly contribution cutoff number is
$45,000 for l S students. If you think
about it for a second,you immediate
ly realize that for China, that makes
you upper-middle class and for peo
ple from other developing parts
around the world, that number is es
sentially unattainable. So that's our
goal, to open up Stanford worldwide
to international students.
The Daily: I've also wanted to ask
about early admissions, something
that could similarly affect the demo
graphics of the student body. Har
vard and Princeton have recently an
nounced their intentions to scrap
early admissions, while schools like
Stanford are continuing. How do you
think this will affect the landscape
across elite American universities?
Ill: I m not sure. We moved away
from binding early decision, which I
did think had significant problems. I
think it had to some extent backfired
and had become something that ac
tually increased the pressure on stu
dents. Early programs in my view
should reduce the pressure on stu
dents and help reduce the number of
applications in the system so stu
dents don't feel they need to apply to

12 schools, but say, one of their top
three in a non-binding way. Then,
they don't have to send in 12 applica
tions anymore.
I think, as you see in the Provost's
op-ed piece in the New York Times,
which reflects our thinking, we don't
think there's any causality between
lower-income students and the early
admissions process, assuming that
the system is nonbinding and that
you don't fill the majority of the class
with the early students.
We looked at our data. While
there is some difference in the per
centage of students who request fi
nancial aid in the early versus regular
application pool, it's not gigantic. It's
not a bimodal distribution; it's not
that way at all.
We think the early program has
real merits. 'ITie surprising thing is
since that op-ed piece has run. no
major institution has abandoned
early admissions, so I think there is
something to thinking this argument
through.
The Daily: Do you think it had an ef
fect?
.Ill: I think it had an effect. 1 think it
stopped what had become If Har
vard's doing this and Harvard said
this might happen, then maybe
they're right."
The Daily: I want to shift gears for a
moment. Is a winning football team
important to the University as a
w hole and is there anything the Uni
versity can do to help?
JH: (Laughs.) Cheer louder. Well. 1
think we certainly strive to be com
petitive and do the best we can in
anything we're involved in, and I
think certainly that applies to foot
ball as well as it applies to our aca
demic endeavors. My sympathies, my
attention has all been focused all on
the team rather than on fans upset by
the season, because I think it's hard
for the team to go through this kind
of difficult year. Thank goodness
they won at Washington. 11l at was
obviously a terrific win for them and
one that. I think,showed they contin
ue to work hard.
So what can we do? I think many
of the problems have resulted from
injuries. I think we have had a lot of
turnover in the coaching staff and
obviously that has not helped, be
cause, obviously, whenever you
change coaches you often change
much of the coaching staff under
neath. And that obviously doesn't
allow our student-athletes to devel
op as well as they might. And that's
something we have to help with. We
probably have to think about how
we're going to help with recruiting of
assistant coaches as well. Obviously
we live in an extremely high-cost
housing area so 1 think that's certain
ly an area where we're talking active
ly with our new Athletic Director
about how we might be able to make
that work better.
The Daily: You've been at Stanford
since 1977. In those 30 years, how has
the University changed for the better

and for the worse?
JH: Mostly! ve seen it change for the
better. 1 think the faculty is stronger
than it was 30 years ago. essentially
across the board.Thirty years ago. we
were a very good university; now
we're a great university. Thirty years
ago, we would have appeared in
everybody's top-10 list; we're now on
everyone's top-five list. Our students
are clearly stronger both at the un
dergraduate and graduate level. 1
think we're getting a lot more atten
tion across the country and across
the world. Our students are coming
from a broader area. We're drawing
more students from the East Coast,
for example. I think the campus
looks better than it looked 30 years
ago. When 1 bring people here to
visit, they're just blown away by how
great the campus is.
Probably the change which I
think is mixed, it's a blessing and a
curse at the same time, is that the
pace of life is definitely more frantic
than it was 30 years ago. That's both
good and bad. [Wednesday! on this
campus, you could hear Bill Gates.
Jerry Yang, Paul Farmer and the gov
ernor all in one day.The bad news, if
you had to do all of those things, you
would have gone crazy. There's so
much happening. I expect my life to
be like that, but you worry if people's
lives are just a little too frantic and
that's a downside.
The Daily: What's your least favorite
part of your job?
JH: Probably two things. One, it's ob
viously never easy to deal with a sit
uation where someone has really
done something that's not good for
the University. And things happen.
It's a big enough place: 15,000 stu
dents, 10,000 employees. There are
always things going on, and periodi
cally people do things. And that's al
ways an unpleasant aspect to deal
with, whether it's actually doing
something to correct somebody, or to
just clean up something that's oc
curred. Yeah, that's not pleasant.
ITie other thing is that sometimes
1 have to respond to people who
don't take a comprehensive view of
the entire University and who be
lieve that their more narrow interest
— and this can come anyone, from
alumni, students, faculty, staff, local
community members — should
trump the entire picture of the Uni
versity somehow. Because that's
what they care about, it should be
more important than that bigger per
spective, and that bigger perspective
can be doing things 15. 20, 30 years

from now. So 1 always have to think
about if we do this, are we going to
harm the students 15 years from
now? And people don't always ap
preciate that perspective.
The Daily: Finally, and thanks again
for your time, if and when you do re
tire, where do you see yourself
going?
JH: I'll probably stay here. I'd like to
go back and do some teaching,
maybe some things beyond just com
puter science, maybe spend some
time down in the Valley. But I think
I'd stay here. I think Stanford has
been a good place for former presi
dents to stay and I think that's a very
healthy thing and says good things
about the institution.
