## Prendergast urges Darfur policy change Sudan expert calls for public pressure on elected officials 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE 
John Prendergast, a former
Clinton administration official
and senior advisor for the non
profit International Crisis Group,
warned last night that the human
itarian crisis in Darfur is escalat
ing and that only a radical policy
shift will produce results.
Prendergast, who has visited
the western province of Sudan
several times, said the conflict is
continuing to escalate.
"We don't have the best num
bers," Prendergast said. "But post
facto, I think we will find that this
will be one of the deadliest peri
ods we have seen. It is devastating

to have to listen to stories of vil
lagers who talk about their homes
being burned, women being gang
raped or children losing their par
ents."
Although the crisis has been
sometimes characterized as one
between Arabs and non-Arabs,
Prendergast said that this is not
the case.The violence, he argued,
is state-sponsored, and he urged
the adoption of policies aimed at
ensuring the accountability of the
government of the troubled coun
try.
"Sudan has a responsibility to
dignify human life," Prendergast
said. "But until there is a cost for
committing genocide, people will
continue to do it. It is very simple."
lie said that "cost" should be
imposed by freezing assets, threats
of military power and internation
al legal consequences.


SHAMS SHEIKH/The Stanford Daily
John Prendergast, former Clinton administration official and
senior advisor to the nonprofit International Crisis Group,
discussed the ongoing conflict in Darfur yesterday.
Although he said that all three
components should play a role, I'ren
dergast cautioned against over-re
liance on armed forces.
"Exclusive military strategy
won't change the equation." he said.
"Rather, the fastest and easiest way
to impact the ground is through po
litical means."
'ITie former State Department of
ficial warned of dire repercussions
for the people of Darfur if current
policy trends toward the region are
not reversed.
"If we don't move that policy to
wards a more robust and more pres
sure focused policy, hundreds of
thousands of people will die over the
next six months," he said.
Prendergast argued that the most
critical ingredient for change is citi
zen activism in the United States.
Without this, he said. Congress and
the executive branch will continue to
support policies that are ineffective

and futile. He drew allusions to the
1994 genocide in Rwanda, where the
United States government failed to
act against mass killings.
"It is in our hands," he said. "It is
clear to me that the one ingredient
that we didn't have in 1994 was any
sense of public outcry, a constituency
to push. Fkit we have that constituen
cy now."
Students Taking Action Now:
Darfur (S TAND), which sponsored
the event, has worked to increase
the size of that constituency. Last
April, the group organized a "Day of
Conscience for Darfur" rally in San
Francisco and raised more than
$15,000 for humanitarian relief.
Currently, the organization's "Dar
fur Advocacy Pledge" has over a
hundred Stanford students and
community members signed up to
take weekly action by contacting
their legislators.
"Through our emails, phone calls
and letters, we are sending a strong
and consistent message to our sena
tors and congressional representa
tives," said STAND coordinator
ElissaTest, a senior.
"We hope to build a dynamic

grassroots movement to help stop
this genocide," said Test. "But we
can't be effective without signifi
cant help from the Stanford com
munity."
Amid calls for grassroots cam
paigning. some audience members
expressed dissatisfaction with the
lack of student attendance.
"1 am surprised and disappointed
that more people did not come," said
sophomore Stephanie Rodriguez.
"He is a powerful speaker and 1
think they would have benefited
from hearing him."
Others called for a more explicit
statement of what concerned citi
zens can do.
"There was a lot of focus on inter
national intervention, but not much
emphasis on what local people them
selves can do." said Zimbabwe na
tive Girley Tegama, an administra
tive assistant in the Geophysics De
partment.
Despite individual points of con
tention. Test maintained that the
night was a success.
"I was re-inspired to commit to
action," she said. "1 think everyone
was as well."
