## Prendergast urges Darfur policy change Sudan expert calls for public pressure on elected officials 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE 
John Prendergast, a former
Clinton administration official
and senior advisor for the non
profit International Crisis Group,
warned last night that the human
itarian crisis in Darfur is escalat
ing and that only a radical policy
shift will produce results.
Prendergast, who has visited
the western province of Sudan
several times, said the conflict is
continuing to escalate.
"We don't have the best num
bers," Prendergast said. "But post
facto, I think we will find that this
will be one of the deadliest peri
ods we have seen. It is devastating

to have to listen to stories of vil
lagers who talk about their homes
being burned, women being gang
raped or children losing their par
ents."
Although the crisis has been
sometimes characterized as one
between Arabs and non-Arabs,
Prendergast said that this is not
the case.The violence, he argued,
is state-sponsored, and he urged
the adoption of policies aimed at
ensuring the accountability of the
government of the troubled coun
try.
"Sudan has a responsibility to
dignify human life," Prendergast
said. "But until there is a cost for
committing genocide, people will
continue to do it. It is very simple."
lie said that "cost" should be
imposed by freezing assets, threats
of military power and internation
al legal consequences.
