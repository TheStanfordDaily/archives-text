Camp Kesem, a week-long summer

activities like arts and crafts, nature walks,
ropes courses and campfire sing-alongs, but
with the shared experience of being the chil
dren of cancer patients. Iliis summer's Camp
Kesem will be held at the Lomamar camp
site in the Santa ( ruz Mountains.
"I love and trust all of my friends [at Camp
Kesem] so much." said 15 year-old camper
I mily Kizzia in a pi ess release." Its so great to
talk about your experiences and have some
one listening who actually understands."
Staff say campers can hardly wait to come
back each summer. In addition to scheduled
camp events, if a camper's parent dies during
the year, some staff members and campers
get together to attend the funeral.

"It's a wonderful new take on a camp
for an under-serviced group" said senior
Beth Presser. former fundraising coordi
nator for the camp. "You hear about sum
mer camps for kids with cancel, but this is
a totally different idea."
About 60 to 70 campers attended the
lirst Camp Kesem in 2001,and thisyearco
ordinators are capping enrollment at 100
campers. The camp has continued to grow
every year since its inception.
"We advertise to the Bay Area commu
nity. but we get a lot of referrals from cancer
clinics and group therapy organizations,"
