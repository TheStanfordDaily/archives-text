### EMMA TROTTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Camp Kesem, a week-long summer
camp founded by Stanford students tor the
children of families affected by cancer, is
gearing up the biggest batch ol campers in
its seven-year history.
The overnight camp is held the week
after Commencement in June. Campers par
ticipate in bread-and-butter summer camp

activities like arts and crafts, nature walks,
ropes courses and campfire sing-alongs, but
with the shared experience of being the chil
dren of cancer patients. Iliis summer's Camp
Kesem will be held at the Lomamar camp
site in the Santa ( ruz Mountains.
"I love and trust all of my friends [at Camp
Kesem] so much." said 15 year-old camper
I mily Kizzia in a pi ess release." Its so great to
talk about your experiences and have some
one listening who actually understands."
Staff say campers can hardly wait to come
back each summer. In addition to scheduled
camp events, if a camper's parent dies during
the year, some staff members and campers
get together to attend the funeral.

"It's a wonderful new take on a camp
for an under-serviced group" said senior
Beth Presser. former fundraising coordi
nator for the camp. "You hear about sum
mer camps for kids with cancel, but this is
a totally different idea."
About 60 to 70 campers attended the
lirst Camp Kesem in 2001,and thisyearco
ordinators are capping enrollment at 100
campers. The camp has continued to grow
every year since its inception.
"We advertise to the Bay Area commu
nity. but we get a lot of referrals from cancer
clinics and group therapy organizations,"
said sophomore Kyle Evaldez. the
camp's community outreach coordi
nator. I think that's how we get so
many new campers each year."
Eundraising presents a consider
able challenge, and two student co
ordinators work for most of the year
to raise the money to hold the camp.
" I he camp costs $130,000 annual-
Is. and all that money is raised by a
tew Stanford students." Evaldez said.
"Most of our funding comes from
grants and donations from nonprofit
organizations, and there are a few
private donations and small fundrais
ing events on campus."
Except for three paid positions —
camp director, nurse, and therapist
which are tilled by adults. Camp
Kesem is entirely staffed by Stanford
students who volunteer their time.
After a recruiting process,
staffers participate in training dur
ing the spring quarter before each
camp. Training culminates in a two
day retreat, during which staffers
are trained in sensitivity and how to
approach and talk with children.
'1 got involved last year because
m\ RA was a Camp Kesem coordi
nator." said Evaldez. "I had an
amazing experience last year.
There's such a community bond and
1 really connected with the kids. I ap
plied to be a coordinator because I
wanted to play a larger role."
About half of Camp Kesem's
counselors each year are returning
staff members like Evaldez, coordi
nators said.
Contrary to what Evaldez charac
terized as popular belief, Kesem,
which means "magic" in Hebrew, is
not religiously affiliated.The program
is run through Hillel House,but Hillel
only helps the camp find sponsors.
With the financial support of nu
merous organizations and private
donors and a week-long time com
mitment from Stanford students, the
camp remains free to all of its atten
dees.
Despite its short duration,
staffers and campers agreed that
Kesem has a positive impact on the
lives of all involved.
"It really creates a community,"
Presser said. "You wouldn't think
you could create such a bond in one
week, but you can."
