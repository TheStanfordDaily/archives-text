One of Stanford's most interesting ac
ademic options is the ability to with
draw from a class between the
fourth and eighth week ot the quarter. Stan
ford's withdrawal policy is unique amongst
its peer institutions. Although Harvard,
Yale. Princeton. MIT and Brown offer vari
ous creative twists on the standard A. B. C,
D and F grading policy, only Stanford al
lows students the option to receive a non
punitive mark alter 40 percent ot the grad
ing period has passed. Unfortunately, many
students do not understand what a W on
their transcripts signify. Students either un
derutilize this option or choose to take a W
for reasons that do not align with the pur
pose of this grading alternative.
According to Roger Printup. the Associ
ate Vice Provost for Student Altairs, Stan
ford developed the W mark instead of al
lowing a student to drop a class late into the
quarter because "the Stanford transcript is
a historic record of students' enrollment.
The Faculty Senate [which approved the
withdrawal policy in 1994] believed that if a
student was enrolled in a course between
the fourth and eighth week of the quarter
that it would be an accurate reflection of a
student's academic activity to show on the
transcript that a student had been enrolled
in a course for at least 40% of the term.
Printup clarifies that the withdraw policy at
Stanford is completely non-punitive.
ITie average Stanford student finds this
difficult to believe. Although representa
tives from the Graduate School ol Business
and the Law School were available for com
ment. the Registrar insists that having a W
(or several) does not implicitly hurt one's
chances for admittance into a graduate pro
gram, nor does a W weaken one's academic
record in general. Graduate programs un
derstand that a W is intended to stand for
many things, ranging from illness to a mid
quarter change in academic interest.
With that. Stanford students should not
utilize a W when they fear that they may get
less than an A in a class. As observed by one
student, the Stanford student population
puts too much of a premium on perfection.
Perfection by no means guarantees success.
John Steinbeck, a notable Stanford alum
nus, received a C in his freshman year Eing
lish class and never managed to graduate
from Stanford. Yet he went on to win both

the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for
Literature (for "The Grapes of Wrath" and
"Of Mice and Men," respectively). A 3.9
grade point average does not guarantee
success, and using a W to manipulate one's
GPA challenges the integrity of the stu
dents doing so.
Currently, few students elect to take a W
in a class. "In autumn, winter, and spring
quarters of 2004-05, there were 126.539
grades given. Of those, 1.069 were Ws,"
Printup said. This figure equates to roughly
.8 percent of the total notations awarded
during this period.
A rise in the number of Ws given would
not be a negative.Too many students take a
grade of No Credit (NC) instead of opting
for a W. As students might worry, a W does
stay on one's transcript even if the class is
retaken for credit or a grade. 1 lowever. un
like an NC.the W truly does not carry a neg
ative denotation. TTie main drawback to
electing for a W is that the student is not
awarded any units for the course. As a re
sult. the student could possibly fall under
academic probation if he completed fewer
than 9 units for a grade during that quarter
or if hiscourseload totaled less than 36 units
for a three-quarter period. Still, the issue of
academic probation or a delay in degree
progression is not inherently fueled by ac
cepting a W on one's transcript.
Academic matters aside, many fear that
allowing oneself the luxury to withdraw
from a class fuels a poor work ethic.There is
no W option in the work world. What sort of
lesson is being taught to Stanford students if
they are allowed to choose a W? Of course,
there are also no grades in the work world.
The academic sphere and the professional
sphere are intrinsically different, and this
sort of argument has a limited application.
Stanford's W policy sets an excellent ex
ample for its peer institutions. Brown only
gives grades of A.B. C or NC, in which case
the NC does not show up on the official tran
script. 1 larva rd gives grades of A. B.C. D or E,
which, aside from annoyingly bucking grad
ing convention, offer limited sympathy for
student's academic journeys. Stanford's W
policy allows for flexibility when a student's
life plan encounters unexpected changes, yet
it also supplies a record of the student's aca-
