## Don't worry Dad, I won't wait up for you 
### 
There are certain things your parents
shouldn't do. They shouldn't sing in
the car.They shouldn't be seen in pub
lic for the entire year when you're 13. They
shouldn't go to a fancy restaurant and order
a cake that says "Congratulations On Your
First Menstrual Cycle."
They also shouldn't date.
To be honest. I wasn't even comfortable
with the idea of my parents dating each
other. While other kids stayed up past "Fan
tasy Island" for the comfort and reassurance
of their parents' return. I stayed up to make
sure Dad didn't try to take Mom some
where after the movie. Also to shake the
specter of that tiny Mexican guy leering
over Lynn Redgrave in a bikini. But that
was secondary.
Eventually, they calmed down and start
ed to spend their Saturday nights ordering
out Chinese food and renting bad movies.
But even after their wild days of dating were
long over, neither of them would own up to
the fact that this "other couple" I heard so
much about never really existed. 1 hope.
So when I lived with my Dad this sum
mer. I wasn't prepared for the coming home
at all hours of the night, the phone calls deep
in the a.m. or the three Greek letters posted
over the door frame. My Dad had started
dating again.
And my Mom's name wasn't "Lisette." I
tried my damndest not to play the bitter
child of a broken family. At least not before
it's time for graduation presents. But some
how. every time I heard one of his exploits,
and the mantra about how a 52-year old
with hair doesn't have any problems with
"ladies," I found myself calling him "Squig
gy"
Somehow, the thought of a woman who
isn't my mother making me breakfast in a
red lace teddy wasn't living up to the fanta
sy. , ,
So I sat him down and tried to have a ma
ture conversation. I told him that I under
stood his situation. I told him what he was
doing was a perfectly normal reaction to the
separation he and my mother were under
going. I told him he was a jerk. He started

mumbling the Greek alphabet backwards
and told me he wasn't going to teach me the
secret handshake.
But he was happy, in a teenage my-par
ents-went-away-for-the-weekend kind.
Like a freshman in college,he put a bunch of
beer in the refrigerator, even though he
doesn't drink beer. He emptied his pockets
to proudly show me intricately folded notes
passed to him at work. I felt like I was living
with Screech from "Saved by the Bell."
Because deep in my heart. 1 was jealous.
1 was old enough to sit back and patiently
wait for the woman who was going to be the
love of my life, so why couldn't he? Hell, he
could at least spend some timing pining. 1
was hoping we could pine together.
But not Dad. He fell off the horse and
wasn't going to wait to put the saddle on.
Even the metaphors make me nauseous.
Imagine what the cheap cologne does.
It's not really the idea of my father dating
that bothers me. It's the idea of him tongue
kissing someone.
But I don't have it in my heart to be angry.
He's happy, he has a Structure credit card
and he's teaching me things about 30-year
old women which may prove invaluable in
just a couple of years. He's also in no position
to ever judge any future girlfriends of mine.
Especially if he's gone out with them.
No matter how explicit he is about his
chance encounter with one of the "fly girls,'
at least it's just the two of us talking togeth
er. in some kind of Billy Cosby meets Benny
Hill way.
It's this Lisette woman that's the prob
lem. Before I know it, I'll be sitting in my
house having a superficial conversation
with my Dad about the new Oliver Stone
movie, because I don't feel comfortable
with the 28-year-old blonde sitting there,
packing his pipe.
I think my Dad's dating one of the Gore
girls.
