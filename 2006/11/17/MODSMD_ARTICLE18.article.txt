Hard as it is to believe, today is the last
day of class before Thanksgiving
Break. Time flies when you're having
fun, doesn't it?
In years past, the first and shorter of the
holiday breaks has presented a conundrum
for a number of Stanford students: join the
millions of stressed-out travelers and fly
home for four short days or watch as campus
empties out and eat your turkey dinner at
Tresidder. The typical solution — skip class
for a day or three and make a week of it —
prompted most professors to cancel lues
day's half-empty lecture and Wednesday's
two-person section in favor of starting their
own cooking early. Last year, however, the
University demonstrated its remarkable
ability to learn from its 115-year past and
gave everyone the entire week off. Now, aside
from wondering whether anyone will be on
campus to read this column, the question re
mains: what will you do with seven days ot
freedom?
1. for one, never experienced the "ToTrav
el or Not to Travel" predicament. Since my
sophomore year of high school, my parents
have lived in one of the smaller shanties of
the Faculty Ghetto. While this proximity had

its downsides (i.e. the possibility of a surprise
visit on a Friday night or, worse, a Saturday
morning), it also had one or two perks. By my
first Thanksgiving break, I was thankful to
simply throw my dirty laundry in my trunk
and drive home (in the car I was still allowed
to have on campus).
My family is not big on tradition.The clos
est we've ever come to holiday ritual —
spending Thanksgiving in Yosemite — lasted
for just three years before it fell prey to a
scheduling conflict. Hiking Half Dome did
not hold the social cache of winning the
Cranberry Classic in Henderson, Nevada, so
when the illustrious tournament offered my
little brother's baseball team a bid, we
swapped our Curry Village cabin for a Circus
Circus double and the Ahwahnee's tradition

al turkey dinner for a classic Vegas buffet.
Given this unconventional history, I hard
ly disrupted family time by bringing ten
dorm-mates home with me my freshman
year. Our eclectic table included my room
mate from Pakistan, my HAA (the ancestor
of the HPAC) from Kansas and a number of
East Coast orphans. My parents did their
part, namely telling us all how mature we
seemed and providing a home-cooked meal
courtesy of the kitchen at Mollie Stone's (one
of several high-end grocery stores on which
my family relies for nightly nourishment).
Over Mollie's perfect sweet potatoes, my
HAA enjoyed a glass of wine with my par
ents, but, despite the fact that some of us had
been drunk for the past eight weeks, the rest
of the table declined my mother's offer. We
weren't that old yet.
The next day, my family left for Lassen
Volcanic National Park in Northern Califor
nia. Within an hour, my brother and I were
arguing in the back seat, and my father
threatened to pull the car over if we didn't
stop. Some things never change.
