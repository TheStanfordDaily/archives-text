Hard as it is to believe, today is the last
day of class before Thanksgiving
Break. Time flies when you're having
fun, doesn't it?
In years past, the first and shorter of the
holiday breaks has presented a conundrum
for a number of Stanford students: join the
millions of stressed-out travelers and fly
home for four short days or watch as campus
empties out and eat your turkey dinner at
Tresidder. The typical solution — skip class
for a day or three and make a week of it —
prompted most professors to cancel lues
day's half-empty lecture and Wednesday's
two-person section in favor of starting their
own cooking early. Last year, however, the
University demonstrated its remarkable
ability to learn from its 115-year past and
gave everyone the entire week off. Now, aside
from wondering whether anyone will be on
campus to read this column, the question re
mains: what will you do with seven days ot
freedom?
1. for one, never experienced the "ToTrav
el or Not to Travel" predicament. Since my
sophomore year of high school, my parents
have lived in one of the smaller shanties of
the Faculty Ghetto. While this proximity had

its downsides (i.e. the possibility of a surprise
visit on a Friday night or, worse, a Saturday
morning), it also had one or two perks. By my
first Thanksgiving break, I was thankful to
simply throw my dirty laundry in my trunk
and drive home (in the car I was still allowed
to have on campus).
My family is not big on tradition.The clos
est we've ever come to holiday ritual —
spending Thanksgiving in Yosemite — lasted
for just three years before it fell prey to a
scheduling conflict. Hiking Half Dome did
not hold the social cache of winning the
Cranberry Classic in Henderson, Nevada, so
when the illustrious tournament offered my
little brother's baseball team a bid, we
swapped our Curry Village cabin for a Circus
Circus double and the Ahwahnee's tradition

al turkey dinner for a classic Vegas buffet.
Given this unconventional history, I hard
ly disrupted family time by bringing ten
dorm-mates home with me my freshman
year. Our eclectic table included my room
mate from Pakistan, my HAA (the ancestor
of the HPAC) from Kansas and a number of
East Coast orphans. My parents did their
part, namely telling us all how mature we
seemed and providing a home-cooked meal
courtesy of the kitchen at Mollie Stone's (one
of several high-end grocery stores on which
my family relies for nightly nourishment).
Over Mollie's perfect sweet potatoes, my
HAA enjoyed a glass of wine with my par
ents, but, despite the fact that some of us had
been drunk for the past eight weeks, the rest
of the table declined my mother's offer. We
weren't that old yet.
The next day, my family left for Lassen
Volcanic National Park in Northern Califor
nia. Within an hour, my brother and I were
arguing in the back seat, and my father
threatened to pull the car over if we didn't
stop. Some things never change.
Alongside the home-cooked meals and

the regression to your high-school
self. Thanksgiving Break affords the
opportunity to catch up on two other
luxuries missing at Stanford: sleep
and contact with the real world.
Compared to the dull roar of life in a
freshman dorm, the peace and quiet
of our road side motel was earth
shattering, and, in contrast to my
egg-crate and extra-long twin back
"home." the lumpy mattress felt like
a giant down-filled pillow.
1 awoke the next day refreshed
and ready to engage with the nation
I'd lost touch with in the past two
months. But our national Thanksgiv
ing traditions —Hollywood's holi
day blockbusters and frantic thirty
days-til-Christmas shopping —
were nowhere to be found in
Chester, California, population 3000.
Instead. I spent the day on a back
country. cross-country ski trail and
the evening waiting for Santa to
come to small town America on a
horse-drawn sleigh on wheels. This
quaint setting, however, was just

where 1 wanted to be — until my lit
tle brother got tired of trekking
through powder and the only way to
keep him going was to sing his then
favorite song, Jimmy Buffett's "Why
Don't We Get Drunk and Screw." at
the top of our lungs in the midst of
the snow-filled silent forest.
If the days immediately following
that Thanksgiving were not tradi
tional. though, I made up for lost
time as soon as we returned. Well
rested and fully rejuvenated from
three days in the middle of nowhere.
1 called my fellow home-for-the-hol
idays high school friends and wound
up in the same place where we'd
spent much the past four years. As
far as I can tell, most high schools
have a social mecca like this — a
home with laid-back parental fig
ures, a well-stocked kitchen and a de
cent stereo system, as well as pacified
neighbors. Iliis is the place where
most Friday and Saturday nights
end, if not begin. Even after high
school graduation, the instinctive
migration continues, and, aside from
a few minor changes in weight and
facial hair, most people look and act
exactly the same. The real value of
these holiday reunions, however, lies
in watching the romantic relation

ships unfold: some keep going
strong, others collapse and a pre
cious few begin — all providing
much more entertainment than the
latest "Grey's Anatomy."
But alongside all of the warm
fuzzies of friends, family, food and
sleep, Thanksgiving break has a seri
ous downside: the schoolwork. The
quarter has just past its tipping point,
when professors reexamine the syl
labus and realize just how much ma
terial they haven't covered. As a re
sult, this vacation often becomes the
un-vacation, full of paper-writing for
fuzzies, problem sets for techies, and
reading for just about everyone.
If nothing else, however, the
workload gives you something to be
thankful for. In addition to NorCal's
version of winter, we here at Stan
ford also enjoy something that stu
dents at Stanford of the East (and
many other semestered-institutions)
do not — an actual December
break, free of looming schoolwork.
Don't forget to count your blessings.

Hard as it is to believe, today is the last
day of class before Thanksgiving
Break. Time flies when you're having
fun, doesn't it?
In years past, the first and shorter of the
holiday breaks has presented a conundrum
for a number of Stanford students: join the
millions of stressed-out travelers and fly
home for four short days or watch as campus
empties out and eat your turkey dinner at
Tresidder. The typical solution — skip class
for a day or three and make a week of it —
prompted most professors to cancel lues
day's half-empty lecture and Wednesday's
two-person section in favor of starting their
own cooking early. Last year, however, the
University demonstrated its remarkable
ability to learn from its 115-year past and
gave everyone the entire week off. Now, aside
from wondering whether anyone will be on
campus to read this column, the question re
mains: what will you do with seven days ot
freedom?
1. for one, never experienced the "ToTrav
el or Not to Travel" predicament. Since my
sophomore year of high school, my parents
have lived in one of the smaller shanties of
the Faculty Ghetto. While this proximity had

its downsides (i.e. the possibility of a surprise
visit on a Friday night or, worse, a Saturday
morning), it also had one or two perks. By my
first Thanksgiving break, I was thankful to
simply throw my dirty laundry in my trunk
and drive home (in the car I was still allowed
to have on campus).
My family is not big on tradition.The clos
est we've ever come to holiday ritual —
spending Thanksgiving in Yosemite — lasted
for just three years before it fell prey to a
scheduling conflict. Hiking Half Dome did
not hold the social cache of winning the
Cranberry Classic in Henderson, Nevada, so
when the illustrious tournament offered my
little brother's baseball team a bid, we
swapped our Curry Village cabin for a Circus
Circus double and the Ahwahnee's tradition

al turkey dinner for a classic Vegas buffet.
Given this unconventional history, I hard
ly disrupted family time by bringing ten
dorm-mates home with me my freshman
year. Our eclectic table included my room
mate from Pakistan, my HAA (the ancestor
of the HPAC) from Kansas and a number of
East Coast orphans. My parents did their
part, namely telling us all how mature we
seemed and providing a home-cooked meal
courtesy of the kitchen at Mollie Stone's (one
of several high-end grocery stores on which
my family relies for nightly nourishment).
Over Mollie's perfect sweet potatoes, my
HAA enjoyed a glass of wine with my par
ents, but, despite the fact that some of us had
been drunk for the past eight weeks, the rest
of the table declined my mother's offer. We
weren't that old yet.
The next day, my family left for Lassen
Volcanic National Park in Northern Califor
nia. Within an hour, my brother and I were
arguing in the back seat, and my father
threatened to pull the car over if we didn't
stop. Some things never change.
Alongside the home-cooked meals and

the regression to your high-school
self. Thanksgiving Break affords the
opportunity to catch up on two other
luxuries missing at Stanford: sleep
and contact with the real world.
Compared to the dull roar of life in a
freshman dorm, the peace and quiet
of our road side motel was earth
shattering, and, in contrast to my
egg-crate and extra-long twin back
"home." the lumpy mattress felt like
a giant down-filled pillow.
1 awoke the next day refreshed
and ready to engage with the nation
I'd lost touch with in the past two
months. But our national Thanksgiv
ing traditions —Hollywood's holi
day blockbusters and frantic thirty
days-til-Christmas shopping —
were nowhere to be found in
Chester, California, population 3000.
Instead. I spent the day on a back
country. cross-country ski trail and
the evening waiting for Santa to
come to small town America on a
horse-drawn sleigh on wheels. This
quaint setting, however, was just

where 1 wanted to be — until my lit
tle brother got tired of trekking
through powder and the only way to
keep him going was to sing his then
favorite song, Jimmy Buffett's "Why
Don't We Get Drunk and Screw." at
the top of our lungs in the midst of
the snow-filled silent forest.
If the days immediately following
that Thanksgiving were not tradi
tional. though, I made up for lost
time as soon as we returned. Well
rested and fully rejuvenated from
three days in the middle of nowhere.
1 called my fellow home-for-the-hol
idays high school friends and wound
up in the same place where we'd
spent much the past four years. As
far as I can tell, most high schools
have a social mecca like this — a
home with laid-back parental fig
ures, a well-stocked kitchen and a de
cent stereo system, as well as pacified
neighbors. Iliis is the place where
most Friday and Saturday nights
end, if not begin. Even after high
school graduation, the instinctive
migration continues, and, aside from
a few minor changes in weight and
facial hair, most people look and act
exactly the same. The real value of
these holiday reunions, however, lies
in watching the romantic relation

ships unfold: some keep going
strong, others collapse and a pre
cious few begin — all providing
much more entertainment than the
latest "Grey's Anatomy."
