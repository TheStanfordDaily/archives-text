## Why I don't trust the police 
### JASON KERWIN 
I'm writing in response to a You Tube
video of police officers tasering a UCLA stu
dent being passed around on campus email
lists. As with all such videos, it's impossible to
know all the facts. What 1 do know is that
there is no way you can watch this video with
out becoming angry and horrified.
A student confronted by police for not
having his student 11) card in the library is
grabbed and tasered as he attempts to leave
the building.The police repeatedly order him
to stand up. He tells them that he can't. They
taser him again. He screams.This goes on sev
eral times, as the police appear to drag him
down the hall. Not once do 1 see the student

offer any resistance beyond failing to stand.
A crowd of other students gathers, begging
the police to stop using the taser. The student
says he has a medical condition, and the cops
taser him repeatedly after he makes that
statement. This process continues, with the
student shouting about "abuse of power."
Other students from the crowd demand the
police officers' badge numbers, but are re
fused. After one student asks for badge num
bers, an officer threatens the student will "get
tased too."
This story has all of the worst elements of
an abuse of authority and should disturb any
one who is concerned with civil rights. The
student, MostafaTabatabainejad, was singled
out for a violation of a rule that bans students

from the library after 11 p.m. unless they
have a university ID card — a rule that has
very little public safety merit. Even if you be
lieve he was resisting arrest — something
that's hard to justify based on the video —
there is no doubt that more harm and disor
der were caused by taking him into custody
than could have been caused by this viola
tion. Moreover, it's obvious from his name
and appearance that Mostafa is a minority.
My assumption on learning his name was
that he was a Muslim, and the police officers
probably thought so as well. The force used
was incredibly disproportionate to the threat
and situation, and is inappropriate on every
