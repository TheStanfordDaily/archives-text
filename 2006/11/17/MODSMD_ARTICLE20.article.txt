# Op-Ed
## A 						call to serve 
### JAMES VAUGHAN 
Enjoying the solitude of EBF at 8 a.m.. 1
grabbed a bagel and opened The limes. In
the editorial section, Nicholas Kristof called
on our leaders to deploy a peacekeeping
force to the Darfur region. In this editorial,
his 28th on the subject, Mr. Kristof forward
ed a new rationale for intervention. Instead
of focusing primarily on the genocide in Dar
fur, he concentrated on the impending col
lapse of regional stability as Sudan's Presi
dent Al-Bashir pushes his country to war
with Chad and the Central African Republic.
Chadians have armed themselves with bows
and arrows against what will become the

genocide's second front.
ITie night of Kristof's publication, I had
the privilege of hearing Dr. Susan Rice's pol
icy recommendations for stopping the geno
cide. Dr. Rice, former Assistant Secretary of
State for African Affairs under Clinton, reit
erated Kristof's tragic claims. An excerpt
from her recent publication in Ibe Washing
ton Post summarizes her position well: "This
genocide has lasted three long years. Peace
ful measures have failed. The Sudanese gov
ernment is poised to launch a second round.
The real question is this: Will [NATO] use
force to save Africans in Darfur as [it] did to
save Europeans in Kosovo?"
I have shared the opinions of Mr. Kristof

and Dr. Rice to delineate the two crux as
pects of the genocide: its horrible extent and
what can be done to stop it. Right now. Khar
toum controls the fate of three million; if we
do not revoke that control, these three mil
lion face an exceedingly grim future. 1 am
writing to invite you to join the fight against
genocide and participate in Darfur advocacy
here at Stanford. Stanford STAND now
works with the nationwide initiative Ameri
cans Against the Darfur Genocide
(www.ourpledge.org). We are currently mo
bilizing religious communities nationwide to
generate the political pressure required for a
NATO solution. Each member of
our team has individual responsibili
ty for relations with designated com
munities â€” he or she talks to pastors
and mission directors, working to
arrange advocacy events (letter writ
ing, call-in day, Darfur presentation,
etc). We welcome new members in
this effort which has been endorsed
by policy experts as an essential tool
for influencing the administration.
Over the past year. STAND mem
bers have organized the Day of Con
science for Darfur Rally on April 30,
2006. We organized a letter signed by
18 policy experts which was deliv
ered directly to the Bush administra
tion. we assisted in the publication of
an Op-Ed in The Times, and, recent
ly, we have formulated policy deliv
ered directly to the President's Spe
cial Envoy to Sudan. If you have a
few free hours a week, come join a
committee and become part of the
nationwide intervention movement.

With your help, we can overcome
political apathy. If you are interest
ed. please get in touch with us at
info@ourpledge.org and join us in
heeding Dr. Rice's request that all
capable people answer the call to
serve.
