## Jack Salisbury How the BCS saved football 
### 
Since its inception in college
football during the 1998 season,
the Bowl Championship Series
system imposed by the NCAA has
had its share of critics. I'm one of
them.
Many insisted that it was impossi
ble or at least unreasonable to pit the
two best teams against one another
in a decisive national championship
game, and there has been a plethora
of controversy in recent years.
Championship game matchups have
been rife with questionable choices
like Nebraska, which was selected by
the BCS to compete in the 2002 Na
tional Title game. This selection was
despite the Huskers failing to win
their conference and losing their
final game to Colorado by an embar
rassing score of 62-36.
College fans cried out against the
selection of the Cornhuskers, favor
ing instead an emerging one-loss
Oregon squad to take their spot. Of
course, the Cornhuskers went on and
got slaughtered by Miami, while
Oregon took care of none other than
Colorado in their respective bowl
games. Needless to say, critics of the
BCS had a lot to talk about in the fol
lowing months.
Even more evidence of the tur
moil and controversy the BCS brings
is the fact that the current BCS is
constantly trying to fix itself. It seems
like every season the committee is
forced to make tweaks to the flawed
system. It is like pushing one fold of a
rug down only to see another come
back up: most of the tweaks have en
gendered new flaws.
Yet. despite all I've already said,
(lie BCS may actually be the best sys
tem.
What? How can such an unfair
and often fishy system be the best for
the hallowed sport of college foot
ball?
Well, the widely proposed alter
native to fix the sport would be to im
plement a playoff system in place of
the current bowl season. Many think
that the top eight teams could be in
vited for a three-round playoff, with
the ultimate champion being decid
ed after the tournament. 'I"he argu
ment for this system is that it would
ensure fairness and equality for all
teams. Colleges like Utah, Rutgers
and Boise State would have a chance
to prove their legitimacy against the
big boys, and deserving one-loss
teams from the power conferences
would still be able to retain their na
tional title aspirations.
From a perspective of fairness, a
