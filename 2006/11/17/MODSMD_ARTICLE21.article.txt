## Jack Salisbury How the BCS saved football 
### 
Since its inception in college
football during the 1998 season,
the Bowl Championship Series
system imposed by the NCAA has
had its share of critics. I'm one of
them.
Many insisted that it was impossi
ble or at least unreasonable to pit the
two best teams against one another
in a decisive national championship
game, and there has been a plethora
of controversy in recent years.
Championship game matchups have
been rife with questionable choices
like Nebraska, which was selected by
the BCS to compete in the 2002 Na
tional Title game. This selection was
despite the Huskers failing to win
their conference and losing their
final game to Colorado by an embar
rassing score of 62-36.
College fans cried out against the
selection of the Cornhuskers, favor
ing instead an emerging one-loss
Oregon squad to take their spot. Of
course, the Cornhuskers went on and
got slaughtered by Miami, while
Oregon took care of none other than
Colorado in their respective bowl
games. Needless to say, critics of the
BCS had a lot to talk about in the fol
lowing months.
Even more evidence of the tur
moil and controversy the BCS brings
is the fact that the current BCS is
constantly trying to fix itself. It seems
like every season the committee is
forced to make tweaks to the flawed
system. It is like pushing one fold of a
rug down only to see another come
back up: most of the tweaks have en
gendered new flaws.
Yet. despite all I've already said,
(lie BCS may actually be the best sys
tem.
What? How can such an unfair
and often fishy system be the best for
the hallowed sport of college foot
ball?
Well, the widely proposed alter
native to fix the sport would be to im
plement a playoff system in place of
the current bowl season. Many think
that the top eight teams could be in
vited for a three-round playoff, with
the ultimate champion being decid
ed after the tournament. 'I"he argu
ment for this system is that it would
ensure fairness and equality for all
teams. Colleges like Utah, Rutgers
and Boise State would have a chance
to prove their legitimacy against the
big boys, and deserving one-loss
teams from the power conferences
would still be able to retain their na
tional title aspirations.
From a perspective of fairness, a
playoff system is clearly the way to
go.There's really no argument.
But is fairness the driving force
behind college football? Is fairness
the intangible quality that college
football will always possess for some
reason? I'll answer my own ques
tion: it isn't.
The interesting element, the most
unique thing about college football
is the importance of the regular sea
son. For the schools from power con
ferences, every game can have na
tional championship implications.
Starting all the way from the first day
of September to the first week of
December, the games are important.
That's what makes college foot
ball different — its regular season
actually matters. Take baseball, for
as a counterexample: the first 162
games are important in that they de
termine who goes to the playoffs, but
each individual game in itself has al
most no significance. The same can
be said for the NBA and, to a lesser
extent, college basketball.
College football provides us fans
with drama, week after week. A Sat
urday never goes by without some
sort of tantalizing and ever-impor

tant matchup. The sport relies on its
regular season to capture its fans.
Tournaments are the strength of col
legiate basketball, not football.
The creation of a playoff system
in football would greatly take away
from the importance of the regular
season. For the top teams.each game
would still be important to secure a
spot for themselves in the playoffs,
but the match-ups of enormous im
portance would pass into antiquity.
For example, tomorrow's slate of
college football features a contest of
epic proportions — Ohio State
against Michigan. If there were some
sort of playoff system, sure, the game
would still be huge (No. 1 vs. No. 2. a
gigantic rivalry, etc.). but it wouldn't
have the same sort of epic, fantasti
cal lure that it currently has. For col
lege football, it just doesn't get any
better.
Sure, the BCS might be a bit un
fair. It's inevitable for inequities to
arise in a structure that attempts to
place only two teams in a final and
decisive title game. But what the
BCS does succeed in is the preserva
tion of the sanctity of the regular
season. As a lifetime fan of the sport.
I'd have to sav that's all that matters.

ferences, every game can have na
tional championship implications.
Starting all the way from the first day
of September to the first week of
December, the games are important.
That's what makes college foot
ball different — its regular season
actually matters. Take baseball, for
as a counterexample: the first 162
games are important in that they de
termine who goes to the playoffs, but
each individual game in itself has al
most no significance. The same can
be said for the NBA and, to a lesser
extent, college basketball.
College football provides us fans
with drama, week after week. A Sat
urday never goes by without some
sort of tantalizing and ever-impor

tant matchup. The sport relies on its
regular season to capture its fans.
Tournaments are the strength of col
legiate basketball, not football.
The creation of a playoff system
in football would greatly take away
from the importance of the regular
season. For the top teams.each game
would still be important to secure a
spot for themselves in the playoffs,
but the match-ups of enormous im
portance would pass into antiquity.
For example, tomorrow's slate of
college football features a contest of
epic proportions — Ohio State
against Michigan. If there were some
sort of playoff system, sure, the game
would still be huge (No. 1 vs. No. 2. a
gigantic rivalry, etc.). but it wouldn't
have the same sort of epic, fantasti
cal lure that it currently has. For col
lege football, it just doesn't get any
better.
Sure, the BCS might be a bit un
fair. It's inevitable for inequities to
arise in a structure that attempts to
place only two teams in a final and
decisive title game. But what the
BCS does succeed in is the preserva
tion of the sanctity of the regular
season. As a lifetime fan of the sport.
I'd have to sav that's all that matters.
