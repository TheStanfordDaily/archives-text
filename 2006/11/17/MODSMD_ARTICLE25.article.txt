### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
After their most
lopsided home loss
since Stanford
basketball will look to
get back to its winning
ways at 7 p.m. tonight
against a Northwest
ern team that appears
to be overmatched.
The Wildcats (1-1)
have split their first
two contests, beating
DePaul in a defensive
battle, 49-39, but falling
to Cornell 64-61 a
week ago. And looking
ahead, more losses
than wins may be on
the horizon for North
western, a team that
lost its top two and five
of its top eight scorers
from last year's 14-15
campaign. Last season,
the squad was outre

boards per game, aver

eraging eight and six points per game last season, re
spectively.
For Stanford (2-1), meanwhile, life was good after a
20-point win against Siena Saturday and a 21 -point vic
tory' over hapless San Jose State TUesday.
But Wednesday, against an expe
rienced Air Force squad, the Cardi
nal played some of the worst on-ball
defense since the game's peach
bucket era.
In the first half. Air Force lived up
to its name, shooting over 70 percent
from the floor and 58 percent deep.
Forward Jacob Burtschi scored 22
points on the period — one more
than the entire Cardinal roster. The
Falcons cruised in the second half, es
pecially after freshman center Robin
Lopez fouled out with seven minutes
to play, and won 79-45 on 55 percent
shooting.
After just two days to prepare for
North western's Princeton offense —
the same scheme Air Force em

ployed so effectively — the need to
step up defensively is painfully obvi
ous to Trent Johnson and his squad.
Another priority needs to be finding
a third reliable scorer so that oppo
nents cannot cheat on Robin Lopez
and sophomore guard Anthony
Goods.
"[Northwestern] is probably not
as talented and experienced as [Air
Force], but they have a very similar
style" said Johnson after the Air
Force game. "1 think our guys are
very good in understanding in such a
short time what we have to do."
For a team and a coach that have
started a disappointing 6-7 and 4-6
the past two seasons, tonight will tell
the tale.

Lawrence Hill and the Cardinal will look to bounce back after a disappointing
79-45 loss against Air Force when they face Northwestern tonight in Maples.
