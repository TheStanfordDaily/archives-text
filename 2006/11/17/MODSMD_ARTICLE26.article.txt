muscles are aching.
They arc dying for a rest. But they don't ask for
one. Every member of the Cardinal knows he has
to work hard to improve on last year's 4-24 record.

Even si), thanksgiving
vacation is coming as a
much-needed break
for the team.

This Saturday, the Cardinal will host the Stanford
Fall Invitational at l ord Center, where they will
face Pacific, UC-Santa Cruz, and California.
Stanford will split up its players into two teams
for the tournament, and Pacific will do the same.
Head Coach John Kosty maintained that the
most important aspect of the weekend's matchups
will be the opportunity for the coaches to evaluate
their players' progress against fresh opposition.
"This is the last time we will get to watch (our
team) before winter break," Kosty said. "We're
going to use this tournament to get everybody as
much playing time [as possible). But really, it will
be a chance for [assistant coach] Ken [Shibuya]
and me to get a final look at our players."
