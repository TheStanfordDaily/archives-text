John Kosty, Stanford coach
Among those players whom the coaches will
have to take an especially long look at is true
freshman setter/outside hitter Kawika Shoji.
Shoji is performing very well so far. and the main
problem is deciding at which position he should
be playing.
"Individually, I don't know whether I'm going
to play setter or outside hitter come season time,"
Shoji s.lid. "Coach hasn't told me which position
I'm going to play, but I'll be happy to play any po
sition. .is long as it helps the team out."
Shoji showed his volleyball prowess in Calgary
I.is! h .Hill at the Husky Dino Cup Tournament.
I le I d the team in kills and was the lone Stanford
player to be named as a Tournament All-Star.
Shoji. though, is focused on his team's prospects
for the season rather than his own progress.
"As a team, we need to heavily improve on two
aspects of our game: ball control and consistency,"
Shoji said. "If we develop those two facets, we will
be more secure once the season rolls around."
Ihe tournament this weekend should bring ex
cellent talents to the Farm, as Kosty referred to all
of Stanford's opponents as "strong teams."
Pacific is coached by Joe Wortmann, a well

known name in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration, having coached for 13 years. Pacific accu
mulated a 6-16 record last season, and Stanford
split its two games with the Tigers in the regular
season.
I"he Banana Slugs, led by coach Jonah Carson,
return strong junior outside hitter Bryan Shires.
He is Santa Cruz's only returning player to he
named to the All-Tournament Team in the Divi
sion 111 Championships, in which they placed sec
ond.
TT.e Golden Bears are the only non-NCAA
sanctioned club team attending.
Despite the current wear-and-tear on their
bodies, Kostv is confident the Cardinal will be

ready for the regular season.
" Ibe fall is a breaking down period," Kosty
said. "We'll he ready for the season once it rolls
around."
Sophomore middle blocker Cameron Christof
fers was optimistic about his team's chances this
season.
"Ibis year's team has the potential to challenge
many of its opponents," Christoffers said. "The is
land treasure [freshman outside hitter Evan
Romero], a Cuban guy with mad hops, the guy
from Wisconsin [Garrett
Werner) and the other freshmen have made an im
mediate impact. They practice with an intensity
that was absent last year"
