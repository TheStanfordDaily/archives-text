## Study predicts collapse of seafood supply 
### HEATHER HEISTAND 
Experts predict a 90 percent depletion of all
wild seafood species by the year 2050, according to
a studs published in the Nov. 3 issue of Science
magazine. But researchers also argued that by tak
ing action now. that projection could still be re
versed.
Hie study, conducted by a collaborative team
brought together by the National Center for Eco
logical Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara,
found that human abuse of marine ecosystems is
contributing to an accelerating trend in marine life
"collapse" defined as a 90 percent decrease in
marine diversity from the current baseline.
"Fishery stocks are collapsing all over the
world and collapsing faster in low diversity popu

lations," said Biological Science Prof. Stephen
Palumbi, who is also a researcher at Stanford's
Hopkins Marine Institute. He and Fiorenza
Micheli, assistant professor of Biological Sciences,
were two of the 14 coauthors of the study.
Hie study cited polluted bays exacerbated by
over-fishing and global warming as crucial factors
in the marine life collapse.
While the current projections appear devastat
ing, researchers found that marine reserves and
fishery closures increased the diversity of target
and non-target species by an average of 23 percent
in protected areas — indicating that the study's
grim predictions could be alleviated by eco-friend
ly policies.
"Policies should be directed to maintaining ma
rine biological diversity at natural levels," Palumbi

said."But we must be willing to spend a little more
to support fisherman out there fishing sustainably."
While these sustainable practices raise prices
for consumers, the alternative may leave seafood
lovers a few years from now hard-pressed to find
their favorite dish on a menu.
Palumbi recommended supporting sustainable
fishers by consulting Monterey Bay Aquarium's
"Sea Food Watch" guide to find seafood currently
farmed with these processes. The pocket-size
guides,printable from the aquarium Website, help
consumers make eco-friendly choices when shop
ping or dining out.
"We go around looking for the lowest bid on
seafood," Palumbi said, "but if we hope to have it
in the future, we must reward sustainable fishing
practices."
