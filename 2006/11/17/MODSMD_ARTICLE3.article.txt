# Harrison leaving his mark on D

### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Following last Saturday's 20-3 victory over
Washington, Stanford's first win of the season, one
might expect a celebratory mood from a Stanford
squad that had endured 11 consecutive losses. And
it certainly was for every player who made the trip,
but senior defensive back Brandon Harrison also
found himself reflecting on his four years of foot
ball at Stanford, which are quickly drawing to a
close.
"Obviously it was a big team celebration," Har
rison said. "But I kind of felt myself a little bit with
drawn from the crowd, kind of sitting with [senior
Trevor] Hooper and talking with him a little bit,
and almost dropping a tear or two between both of
us. And I told one person, 'Man it's just been so
hard, it's just a relief to finally get one.' I think def
initely it was a kind of coming together for some of
the guys who've been here four or five years and
don't have that many left."
The journey from freshman out of Baton
Rouge, La. to senior and team leader has indeed
been a trying one, as Harrison has seen four losing
seasons for the Cardinal and two head coaches.
Nevertheless, he still says his focus is on passing on
what he's learned in those years to the next gener
ation of Stanford players.

"I feel that being a senior and being considered
one of the leaders on the defensive side, 1 just owe
it to everyone to give everything I have every day,"
Harrison said. "If I'm not doing that I'm cheating
my teammates. And 1 just think if [Hooper] and I
continue to fight it will rub off on other guys."
As a leader in the secondary, Harrison's influ
ence certainly seemed to pay dividends for the
Cardinal last week, as sophomore Bo McNally in
tercepted two passes, returning one for a score. Mc-
Nally credited Harrison and other senior leader
ship with playing a significant role in his develop
ment as a player in the midst of a difficult season.
"It has been a really good learning experience,"
McNally said. "The seniors and the leaders have
set forth a pretty amazing example of how we need
to be when we are seniors. Every practice, Harrison
and Hooper are on me hard, making sure I don't
make mistakes. They are amazing leaders, and I
learned a lot from them."
The respect goes both ways, as Harrison spoke
Wednesday about how he views his role as a men
tor and elder statesman on the team.
"I feel like Bo's one of my kids running around
out there," Harrison said. "He's got a chance to be
a big time player right away. I try as much as I can
to be a mentor and try to help him with those little
