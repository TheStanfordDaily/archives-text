# 'Fountain': Drink it up

### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION FOUNTAIN HEAD 
"The Fountain" is a pretty tough sell. Written and di
rected by Darren Aronofsky (of "Pi" and "Requiem for a
Dream"), the film possesses all the deep philosophical
complexity and craftsmanship of an art-house flick but has
been treated as a major studio release. While advertised as
a romance epic covering a thousand-year span. "The
Fountain" is most concerned with confronting and chal
lenging concepts of man's mortality, and ponders what
happens when one is met with imminent death face-to
face. The result is a film that is all at once moving, frus
trating, beautiful, off-putting, thought-provoking and con
fusing, but a movie with true depth and even entertain
ment value no less. It may seem like an arthouse flick un
necessarily given the big-budget treatment, but for those
willing to take on the experience, "The Fountain" deliv
ers.
Hugh Jackman plays Tomas, Dr. Tommy Creo and
Tom. three men living in 16th century Spain, year-2000
America, and outer space 500 years in the future, respec
tively. That these men may or may not actually be the
same man is a part of the mystery, as all three search for a
cure to what Tommy refers to as the "disease" of death.
Rachel Weisz plays his counterpart in each time (Queen
Isabel, Izzi and a more abstract unnamed role in the fu
ture). the love for which he fights to achieve immortality.
Apart from several scenes from the ever-outstanding
Ellen Burstyn, the two leads occupy the screen for a very
large majority of the time - and, thankfully, they each bring
enough complexity to their roles to sustain such a major
undertaking.
Really, though, the star <tf the film is Aronofsky be
cause the film relies most heavily on his ability to weave
between the three times with ease, to ask the deep philo
sophical questions regarding man's existence while avoid
ing pretentiousness, and to create a distinct artistic style
for not one but three different eras. Whether it be a Span
ish conquistador's travels through South American jun
gles, an impressively unique yet somehow believable fu
ture, or the simple year-200 laboratory in which Tommy
works, Aronofsky handles the job brilliantly. He films
beautifully, as scenes on an icy lake look just as stunning as
a nebula in the farthest reaches of the galaxy. And as for
pacing, for a film that tackles such lofty concepts (Should
man want to live forever? Is death an end, or a begin
ning'?). "The Fountain" is surprisingly brisk. It does not
succumb to the overblown preaching (or what is perceived
as preaching) that often detracts mainstream audiences
from seeing "art" films.
The storyline is at once very simple and very complex -
a man loves a woman and seeks a way to live with her for
ever. Aronofsky imbues that simple idea with deeper
meaning through such elements as the love between the
married Jackman and a cancer-stricken Weisz in the pre
sent time period, a conquistador's search for the biblical
Tree of Life 500 years before or a cosmonaut's voyage
through space in a giant glass sphere 500 years after. With
that complexity, though, comes the necessary frustration
with accepting that not everything is going to be black and
white by the story's end. and that some may eventually be
come bored or lost in the twisting storylines.
I expected that moment to come, but for me it never
did. "The Fountain" is a truly impressive achievement be
cause while now 1 may not be able to entirely explain
everything going on in the film (especially its intense and
cryptic final minute), it is a solid love story, a fascinating
rumination on the relationship between life and death anc
an altogether smart and entertaining viewing experience.
