### YOU KNOW US INTERMISSION TURKEYS 
We've heard it before. We usually just brush it oil on the
outside as if we don't care. It's that comment: "Intermission
is such a joke." Seriously. Seriously. Even if you feel'that
way, please, keep it to yourself.
It's not like we pretend to bring you the news of the day.
You want to read about President Bush s visit to campus 01
the earthquake in Hawaii? Clearly, Intermission is not the
new source you turn to (il you want ridiculous commentary
on such issues, we're there lor you). We are not CNN, which
is a eood thine considering how downhill

I think it re
. quires to put
lout a 12-page
4 section every

week along with page 2 on Mondays? It takes more work
than an engineering course. Betsy knows...she's in a few.
It hurts when we hear, these comments because we
don't do this job as a Brendan is off to in
vestment banking next year and Betsy is an engineer with
no newspaper editing in her future. We do this job because
we legitimately love the work, the people and the stuff we
publish. It is pretty awesome to hear Bob Saget on the
phone or go to the new Lucas Film Studios for a press
movie screening.
We bring this world of entertainment to you. As a writer,
you would GET to do all these cool things (shameless plug
for writing: intermission.daily@gmail.com).
If you think that this job is so easy, then you should try it.
Check the snail mail and phone messages daily. Always log
on to the gmail account. Get calls at 7 a.m. from a publicist
that doesn't understand that you are on the West Coast but
she is really trying to promote her movie. All you can think
is "How did you get my phone number?" Thursday nights,
you are at The Daily office £rom£ p.m. to 2 a.m. or so. And
you think that the week is over.
Then you are sending out emails and assigning articles on
Friday. Saturday, you are worried that you don't have
enough for Monday. Sunday, you have to read everything
and get page 2 ready for Monday. Monday is your day off
from it all as long as you are on top of the email from before.
Tuesday articles come in and layout begins. Then the cycle
continues Wednesday and Thursday. Then you are back to
Thursday. We're not bitching. We love this stuff. We're just
trying to point out that when you say, "such a joke." we have
given our time to this job.
Intermission isn't about how much work we put into it. It
is about the fun we have doing it. That's why this is Brendan s
second volume and Betsy's third volume. So stop making fun
of this publication, at least to our faces. Maybe, instead of
mocking, you should join in (write
intermission.daily@gmail.com). What activities at Stanford
have you loved so much that you have worked at them for at
least eight hours every week for two years (Betsy) and for
five years (Brendan) ?
