# ALLEN A DELIGHT ON STAGE
## 
### YONI TEITELBAUM INTERMISSION JAZZY DUDE 
On a day that featured campus visits
by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, Stanford's
nightlife was not lacking in star power of
its own. Wednesday night, world
renowned jazz drummer Carl Allen sat
in for a concert with the Stanford Jazz
Orchestra before a substantial crowd at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Allen, a Mil
waukee native, began his career in his
late teens gigging with the likes of Sonny
Stitt and James Moody before joining
trumpeter Freddie Hubbard's band in
1982. In 1988 Allen co-founded Big
Apple Productions, and currently serves
on the faculty of The J uilliard School of
Music.
The first few numbers showcased the
SJO by itself, and its members put on a
fine show in their own right. The Or
chestra's director, Fred Berry, kicked
off the show with "Strike up the Band"
by George and Ira Gershwin before the
| audience's applause had even died
| down. "Strike" was followed by Gerald

Wilson's "Viva Tirado," Bob Curnow's
"For the Li'l Ones" and Jim Webb's
"Mac Arthur Park," arranged by Adrian
Drover for Maynard Ferguson.
"Mac Arthur Park," more of a straight
rock tune, featured lead trumpet player
Niel Levonius flying high in the upper
registers, in the fashion pioneered by
Ferguson.
Then emerged the face that had been
on posters all around campus all week.
Short but broad-shouldered, Allen ex
uded a quiet, warm humor as he stepped
out onto the stage. Walking around pi
anist Boris Logvinskiy, Allen made a
point of stopping to adjust the pianist's
collar, saying, "He needs a little more at
tention sometimes." However, the
drummer and the SJO soon got down to
business with "Sao Paulo," a Latin piece
from the pen of SJO alum Tom Harrell,
who is today a well-known professional
musician.
The band then played two original
pieces by Allen entitled "LaShea's
Walk" and "Ritual Dance." At the end
of "Ritual Dance," bassist Jon Merola
immediately brought the band into the

rolling three of Wayne
Shorter's well-known
tune, "Footprints."
After the head, alto sax- j
ophonist Anthony Dia- J
mond came in on a j
long solo, shifting ef- I
fortlessly between fl
swing, Latin and a Sj
12/8 feel, as trumpeter 1
Jon Liang looked on
from the foot of the
stage, awaiting his turn,
foot tapping quietly to
Diamond's groove.
Bassist Merola had took
a solo with Allen quietly
keeping time in the
background,- and then
Liang launched into his
own growling solo. Fi
nally, the patient au
dience was treated
to Allen's first sola
of the night, distinctly
