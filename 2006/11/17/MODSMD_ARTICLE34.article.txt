# ALLEN A DELIGHT ON STAGE
## 
### YONI TEITELBAUM INTERMISSION JAZZY DUDE 
On a day that featured campus visits
by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, Stanford's
nightlife was not lacking in star power of
its own. Wednesday night, world
renowned jazz drummer Carl Allen sat
in for a concert with the Stanford Jazz
Orchestra before a substantial crowd at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Allen, a Mil
waukee native, began his career in his
late teens gigging with the likes of Sonny
Stitt and James Moody before joining
trumpeter Freddie Hubbard's band in
1982. In 1988 Allen co-founded Big
Apple Productions, and currently serves
on the faculty of The J uilliard School of
Music.
The first few numbers showcased the
SJO by itself, and its members put on a
fine show in their own right. The Or
chestra's director, Fred Berry, kicked
off the show with "Strike up the Band"
by George and Ira Gershwin before the
| audience's applause had even died
| down. "Strike" was followed by Gerald

Wilson's "Viva Tirado," Bob Curnow's
"For the Li'l Ones" and Jim Webb's
"Mac Arthur Park," arranged by Adrian
Drover for Maynard Ferguson.
"Mac Arthur Park," more of a straight
rock tune, featured lead trumpet player
Niel Levonius flying high in the upper
registers, in the fashion pioneered by
Ferguson.
Then emerged the face that had been
on posters all around campus all week.
Short but broad-shouldered, Allen ex
uded a quiet, warm humor as he stepped
out onto the stage. Walking around pi
anist Boris Logvinskiy, Allen made a
point of stopping to adjust the pianist's
collar, saying, "He needs a little more at
tention sometimes." However, the
drummer and the SJO soon got down to
business with "Sao Paulo," a Latin piece
from the pen of SJO alum Tom Harrell,
who is today a well-known professional
musician.
The band then played two original
pieces by Allen entitled "LaShea's
Walk" and "Ritual Dance." At the end
of "Ritual Dance," bassist Jon Merola
immediately brought the band into the

rolling three of Wayne
Shorter's well-known
tune, "Footprints."
After the head, alto sax- j
ophonist Anthony Dia- J
mond came in on a j
long solo, shifting ef- I
fortlessly between fl
swing, Latin and a Sj
12/8 feel, as trumpeter 1
Jon Liang looked on
from the foot of the
stage, awaiting his turn,
foot tapping quietly to
Diamond's groove.
Bassist Merola had took
a solo with Allen quietly
keeping time in the
background,- and then
Liang launched into his
own growling solo. Fi
nally, the patient au
dience was treated
to Allen's first sola
of the night, distinctly
melodic in his use of his tuned toms.
Allen brought the band back in on
12/8 meter, they ran through the
head, and it was Allen alone on the
drums who closed out the piece.
Then, Berry brought the concert
"closer to home" with "Brush Taps,"
a piece by the great drummer Louie
Bellson, who currently resides in San
Jose. Next came Thad Jones' "Mean
what you say," followed by "Carme
lo's by the Freeway" from arranger
Boh Florence, also a West Coast res
ident.
Finally, the band wrapped up the

show with another Bellson tune,
"Soar Like an Eagle." At the begin
ning of the piece, Berry declared a
drum battle between Allen and the
SJO's own Mohini Rustagi. The
piece opened with a couple of ex
changes between Allen and Rustagi,
and the band stopped periodically
for more back-and-forth as Rustagi
held her own against Allen. Eventu
ally, the two of them settled together
into a funky groove, and then each
built off the other's playing. After it
was over, Allen got up with his arms
wide open and hugged Rustagi.
Rustagi said afterward that work
ing with Allen was "fun, valuable,
and 1 learned a lot over the course of
the week. A lot more is learned be
hind the scenes than backstage."

Rustagi, a senior engineering major
who hails from right here in Palo
Alto, has been playing drums for
nine years. 1 asked her why she
chose drums. She explained that
with four children in the house, her
parents would only pay for lessons
on one instrument per child. When
she joined her middle school band,
she chose percussion because she
figured that it would be easy enough
that she wouldn't have to drop
piano lessons. Eventually, she did
switch to drum lessons, though she
says she still plays piano sometimes
on her own.
SJO director Berry says he makes
a point of bringing in active perform
ers to sit in on the SJO's concerts.
"These artists are world class. These
are the creators of this art," he said.
"They're inspiring to students.
Everyone playing in the band is play
ing because of them and trying to be
like them. They arc world-class play
ers and educators."
In between a busy schedule of
performing, recording, and teach
ing, Allen travels to other campuses
several times a month. He says that
he enjoys the youthful energy of
being on a college campus and the

pleasure of giving back to the next
generation. Asked what advice he
has for the many Stanford students
who have struggled with the deci
sion of whether to pursue music or
other careers, Allen said. "Many
students go into music for the wrong

reason. It's not all about whether or |
not you can make a living doing it. .
The purpose is the enjoyment, and I
how it can change the lives of those |
who listen to it. Just enjoy the music. â–

Allen brought the band back in on
12/8 meter, they ran through the
head, and it was Allen alone on the
drums who closed out the piece.
Then, Berry brought the concert
"closer to home" with "Brush Taps,"
a piece by the great drummer Louie
Bellson, who currently resides in San
Jose. Next came Thad Jones' "Mean
what you say," followed by "Carme
lo's by the Freeway" from arranger
Boh Florence, also a West Coast res
ident.
Finally, the band wrapped up the

show with another Bellson tune,
"Soar Like an Eagle." At the begin
ning of the piece, Berry declared a
drum battle between Allen and the
SJO's own Mohini Rustagi. The
piece opened with a couple of ex
changes between Allen and Rustagi,
and the band stopped periodically
for more back-and-forth as Rustagi
held her own against Allen. Eventu
ally, the two of them settled together
into a funky groove, and then each
built off the other's playing. After it
was over, Allen got up with his arms
wide open and hugged Rustagi.
Rustagi said afterward that work
ing with Allen was "fun, valuable,
and 1 learned a lot over the course of
the week. A lot more is learned be
hind the scenes than backstage."

Rustagi, a senior engineering major
who hails from right here in Palo
Alto, has been playing drums for
nine years. 1 asked her why she
chose drums. She explained that
with four children in the house, her
parents would only pay for lessons
on one instrument per child. When
she joined her middle school band,
she chose percussion because she
figured that it would be easy enough
that she wouldn't have to drop
piano lessons. Eventually, she did
switch to drum lessons, though she
says she still plays piano sometimes
on her own.
SJO director Berry says he makes
a point of bringing in active perform
ers to sit in on the SJO's concerts.
"These artists are world class. These
are the creators of this art," he said.
"They're inspiring to students.
Everyone playing in the band is play
ing because of them and trying to be
like them. They arc world-class play
ers and educators."
In between a busy schedule of
performing, recording, and teach
ing, Allen travels to other campuses
several times a month. He says that
he enjoys the youthful energy of
being on a college campus and the

pleasure of giving back to the next
generation. Asked what advice he
has for the many Stanford students
who have struggled with the deci
sion of whether to pursue music or
other careers, Allen said. "Many
students go into music for the wrong

reason. It's not all about whether or |
not you can make a living doing it. .
The purpose is the enjoyment, and I
how it can change the lives of those |
who listen to it. Just enjoy the music. â– 
Serve the music, and the music will "
serve you."
On a day that featured campus visits
by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, Stanford's
nightlife was not lacking in star power of
its own. Wednesday night, world
renowned jazz drummer Carl Allen sat
in for a concert with the Stanford Jazz
Orchestra before a substantial crowd at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Allen, a Mil
waukee native, began his career in his
late teens gigging with the likes of Sonny
Stitt and James Moody before joining
trumpeter Freddie Hubbard's band in
1982. In 1988 Allen co-founded Big
Apple Productions, and currently serves
on the faculty of The J uilliard School of
Music.
The first few numbers showcased the
SJO by itself, and its members put on a
fine show in their own right. The Or
chestra's director, Fred Berry, kicked
off the show with "Strike up the Band"
by George and Ira Gershwin before the
| audience's applause had even died
| down. "Strike" was followed by Gerald

Wilson's "Viva Tirado," Bob Curnow's
"For the Li'l Ones" and Jim Webb's
"Mac Arthur Park," arranged by Adrian
Drover for Maynard Ferguson.
"Mac Arthur Park," more of a straight
rock tune, featured lead trumpet player
Niel Levonius flying high in the upper
registers, in the fashion pioneered by
Ferguson.
Then emerged the face that had been
on posters all around campus all week.
Short but broad-shouldered, Allen ex
uded a quiet, warm humor as he stepped
out onto the stage. Walking around pi
anist Boris Logvinskiy, Allen made a
point of stopping to adjust the pianist's
collar, saying, "He needs a little more at
tention sometimes." However, the
drummer and the SJO soon got down to
business with "Sao Paulo," a Latin piece
from the pen of SJO alum Tom Harrell,
who is today a well-known professional
musician.
The band then played two original
pieces by Allen entitled "LaShea's
Walk" and "Ritual Dance." At the end
of "Ritual Dance," bassist Jon Merola
immediately brought the band into the

rolling three of Wayne
Shorter's well-known
tune, "Footprints."
