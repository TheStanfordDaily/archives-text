## The 						movies you missed... 
### ELIZABETH FOX INTERMISSION FOX 
I'll be the first to admit that I'm looking forward to going home for
Thanksgiving. It's not that I don't love it here (I do), but 1 feel that it's
more effective to brag about California weather to all my East Coast (
friends in person. Plus, I miss my movie theater. Way back when, in the
throes of high school, I often showed up there multiple times in one
week. Here, well, thank goodness for Flicks.
I didn't even realize that I missed it so much until I called one of my
friends back home, and she mentioned that she'd gone to see "The Pres
tige" without me. After chewing her out (she should have known bet
ter), I decided to list all the movies that I, and probably you, need to see.
First, there is the obvious: "Borat." It's got to be the number one
movie in America for a reason. Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat, the re
porter from Kazakhstan who winds up in outrageous and impressively
awkward situations while trying to figure out what makes America so
great, is funny. Really, really funny. At least, that's what those commit
ted fans who dragged themselves all the way to Redwood City to see it
said.
Next, we've got to see "The Departed." For those who haven't ,
been obsessively watching trailers online, it's the new Martin Scors- /
ese film in which Leonardo DiCaprio, a Boston cop, goes undercov- M
er to infiltrate Jack Nicholson's gang. At the same time, Matt I,
Damon, working for the gang, infiltrates the police department to /
find Leo out. What holiday season doesn't need a good, suspense- r
ful crime caper? USA Today even called it one of the best films of //
Scorsese's career. Plus, Titanic was really important to me. Leo, h
I'm here for you. } j|

But don't think we're going to stop at two. "Stranger Than Fic
tion" is still playing, and that's definitely a must see. Sure, it's a little
weird to see Will Ferrell not drinking, streaking or mocking NASCAR,
but the storyline is too good to turn down. Emma Thompson stars as a
writer struggling to complete her latest novel, much as some of us strug
i gle to complete our latest PWR paper. She attempts to kill off Ferrell,
L her main character, who happens to actually exist. It's the kind of sto
-1 ryline that's just strange enough to be amusing.

And then, for something totally new and different, there's
("Babel." While it's a more serious movie than I would normally
choose, tackling issues of communication and political and cultural
divides, it appears to be the kind of ambitious, important movie
that we should see over the break to make sure we all remember to
think, not just eat. It also has the advantage of making us look

I smarter, much the same way that having "Freakonomics" prominently dis
■ played on my bookshelf does. And I can go to it with my mom. And it has Brad
■ Pitt. What's not to love?
Finally, there's "The Prestige," the movie that my silly, inconsiderate
112 friend went to see without me. It stars Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as
friends-turned-warring-magicians, trying to outdo each other in their perfor
mances. As consolation for having gone without me. my friend not only

■ promised to see it again with me, but also recounted in loving detail exactly how
■ perfect it was. It was amazing. It was brilliant. It was surprising, suspenseful, won-
V derful, exciting. Of course, all she had to say was that the terrible mustache that
r Bale sports in the preview doesn't last more than five minutes and 1 would have
been sold immediately.
So that's five movies 1 have to catch up on. Keeping in mind that "Casino Royale,"
"Happy Feet" and "Tenacious D" will also be in theaters, well, it's going to be one
action-packed holiday. I guess I'll just bring the turkey to the movies with me.
