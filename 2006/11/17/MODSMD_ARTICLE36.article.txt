## BE WOWED BY WOWEE ZOWEE' 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION PAVER 
Sometimes when I'm reading about mod
ern history that occurred during my lifetime, I
have to ask myself how I was possibly oblivious
of its occurrence. Take the tearing down of the
Berlin Wall, for instance. I know I was just a
year old, but how dumb did I have to be to miss
the significance of something so important?
Obviously 1 was a very unintelligent child.
Now, listening to the re-release of Pave
ment's 1995 classic album, 'Wowee Zowee' I
get the same feeling. How could I have missed
Pavement's greatness?
This, the Stockton. California band's third
and penultimate album, has been re-released
by Matador records not only with the original
18 tracks, but with an additional 32 songs,
rhese songs, some b-sides, some live perfor
mances, and others recorded in the BBC stu
dios, add up to create a whopping 50 song col
lection spread over two CDs. And you also get
a handsome 64 page book that is chock-full of

photos and information on the album.
Sure, there are lots of great extras, but how
good is the album? Let me tell you, its pretty
darn good. Perhaps it's not technically as good
as Pavement's first and second albums. 'Slanted
& Enchanted' and 'Crooked Rain, Crooked
Rain,' but it makes up for this in its sheer variety.
This album, Pavement's most experimen
tal. is all over the place. Some songs could be
considered punk, others like straight from a
classic rock album, while others seem like they
could be best described as country. Each of the
eighteen songs seems so different from each
other that they could have been songs by eigh
teen different bands. It is as if Pavement pulled
a James Joyce and decided that they would ap
proach each song with an entirely different
style and technique. For example, witness
"Serpentine Pad,' the sixth song on the album.
When I first heard the song, I legitimately
thought that my computer had somehow put
shuffle on, and I was now listening to Art Brut,
but this was not the case. The song, full of rag
ing guitars and angry vocal by members

Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg, is far
shorter (at slightly more than a minute) and far
more frenetic than anything else on the album.
The album is unlike anything Pavement had
done before. Although some songs, like 'Best
Friends Arm" begin like a song might in 'Slant
ed & Enchanted,' it suddenly turns into some
thing far different than anything Pavement had
created before. The experimentation definite
ly creates an exciting, but strange feeling to the
album. Sometimes, like in 'Grave Architec
ture,' the song sounds like it is about to end,
only to begin anew with a whole new sound.
Admittedly, the album has its faults. It was
rushed through production, and this shows
sometimes, especially in the longer songs that
fail to keep moving, such in the song 'Father to
a Sister of Thought." These are the times when
Pavement sounds a little lazy and sloppy, but
these instances are never too obvious.
But, of course, there are some spectacular
songs on this album. 'Rattled by the Rush,' the
album's second song, is one example. It's re
markable well written, with great rhymes and

lyrics, that, while they seemingly make sense in
the song, make little sense outside of the song:
"worse than your lyin'/caught my dad cryin 1...
I'm drowning for your thirst."
The extras on the album are often also
slightly sloppy and erratic, but they give a nice
portrait of the band circa 1995. Many of the
songs are simply outtakes and live takes, which
are mort lax than the work done in the studio,
but they certainly are a lot of fun, and are full of
obvious energy. Several of these extra songs
are almost good enough to be in the album it
self ('Kris Kraft') while others are B-sides for
good reason.
If you've heard "Slanted & Enchanted" and
"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain," and liked
them, you should certainly try "Wowee
Zowee." And even if you haven't heard any
Pavement before. "Wowee Zowee" is worth a
listen, though the band's first two album's
might be a little more accessible. And then,
when you do finally hear 'Wowee Zowee,'
you'll be glad you did, because you'll be reliv
ing history.
