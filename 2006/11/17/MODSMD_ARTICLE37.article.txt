# DEFTONES: GREAT FOR A 'SATURDAY NIGHT' LISTEN
## 
### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER 
Over the past few years, it seemed as though
the Dcftones were going to go the way of the
Dodo. After numerous reports of fighting with
in the band and conflicts on the road, followed
by a sub-par self-titled 2003 release the
Deftones were dangerously close to slipping off
the musical radar and falling into VHl's "Be
hind the Music" territory.
But now, with the release of the long-await
ed "Saturday Night Wrist" Deftones fans can
breathe an enormous sigh of relief: not only is
the band still around, but they sound better

than ever.
"Saturday Night Wrist"
was very much the

album that almost
didn't happen.
lite 1 b y in -

fighting, the group had been in and out of the
studio constantly since 2003 with mixed month
ly reports about the band's progress and/or
breakup. After falling silent for an exceptional
ly long stretch in early 2006, the Deftones final
ly announced that the new album was going to
hit stores on Halloween day.
Needless to say, nobody reallv knew what to

expect.
The eclectic mish-mash of styles that had
been the Deftones' greatest point of appeal to
date was also often seen as their biggest crutch.
While the myriad of genres and musical influ
ences offered a very unique flavor to the
Deftones' music, they always seemed to stum
ble over how to arrange the music to deliver a
powerful and passionate message from first
song to last. Their previous albums were
filled with scattered hit or miss results.

Rest assured, they figured it out.
Lead singer Camillo "Chino"
Moreno kicks off the album with its
first single. "Hole in the Earth,"
which mixes a hard-driving
rhythm against a varied and

melodic chorus. Moreno's
evanescent vocals draw
goose-bumps as he

I'uuipj ao uv,
glides frofn note to
note seamlessly,
echoing the

line, "There's a hole in the earth, I'm out / There's
a hole in the earth, lets take a bow."
Quickly ripping you away from the floating
melodies of "Hole in the Earth," tracks "Rap
ture" and "Rats! Rats! Rats!" give off an un
mistakably dark and metal vibe that echoes
back to the days of "Around the Fur" and
"Adrenaline." It's a welcome new take on what
made the Deftones popular in the first place,
and it sounds great.
The songwriting throughout the album is
very consistent without being overly formulaic.
It is uniquely Deftones without sounding like a
simplistic rehash of their previous work.
Mixed in throughout the album are abstract
masterpieces such as the eerie and passionate
"Cherry Waves," or the sinister chords and
lyrics of "Beware," as well as the electronica
poetry of "Pink Cellphone" which features
Annie Hardy of Giant Drag.
All of these songs exhibit a new form of
seemingly experimental writing for the
Deftones which gives the music a very stream
of consciousness" feeling to the music without
making it intangible to the listener. It sounds
like a gamble, but they pull it off impeccably,
drawing the listener into the music in all-new
ways.
While songs like this may be a bit too pro
gressive to bring the Deftones immense com
mercial success and mainstream popularity,
these works show a greatly matured and co
hesive set of songwriters whose musical lega
cy is sure to outperform and outlast their sales
figures.
Closing off the album are two standout

tracks, "Kimdracula" and "Revifere." , j
"Kimdracula" is an extremely powerful
rocker with a volatile vocal melody that is at
times ravenously violent and at others sooth
ingly melodic. This powerhouse single instant
ly sprung out to me as my personal favorite
track off the album and really served to crystal
lize the evolution of the Deftones' sound in my
eyes. This is the Deftones and damn it sounds
good.
"Reviere" offers a departure from what one
would expect to tic the album together. Start
ing off as a droning acoustic ballad, it picks up
into wailing and guitar driven bridge midway
through, only to return to a soft acoustic finish
as Moreno whispers, "She haunts the road / She
waits for a new face."
It's creepy and yet calming at the same time;
the track is a surprising departure from the rest
of the album but in the best way possible, ex
posing a seemingly soft and empathetic
glimpse beyond the Deftones' usual dark and
morose image.
"Saturday Night Wrist" starts strong and
only builds force as the tracks keep coming.
This won't be the record seller or radio
friendly hit machine that "White Pony" was,
which is too bad, because this is a much
more mature and sophisticated album than
anyone expected after the 2003 self-titled
disappointment.
It may have taken five albums and over a
decade for the Deftones to get everything fig
ured out, but they have finally found their
sound, and we as fans have never had it so
good.
