## Bring your California style home... 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN INTERMISSION FASHIONEER 
Fashion, fashion, fashion. It may not have been a big deal to you out there in Omaha, or Tope
ka, but you live in California now, baby. Welcome to the land of fashion.
Okay, so maybe that's a little bit of a stretch. Yes. we are in California, you say, but we live in Stan
ford, California, and not Beverly Hills, California. Granted. But the point I was trying to convey is
that when you live in the state that is the home of brands like Paul Frank, Obey and Trovata and
shows like The OC and Laguna Beach, it's almost impossible not to be affected by the fashion cul
ture. It's only a matter of how much.

The Stanford Student's Califoipip Wardrobe Essentials
The Essential Essentials; 1 „ .
1. A Stanford sweatshirt (or t-shirr)
a. The Stanford Bookstore must go to great lengths to keep these in stock, because I have yet to see
a Stanford student that does not own one. It is so useful. Keeps you warm, keeps you covered, lets
those public school kids know who's boss.
2. A pair of flip flops
a. I'm originally from Southern California, Orange County to be precise, and really, I think every
body and their mother owns a pair of Rainbow brand flip-flops myself. 1 didn't — preferred three
dollar Old Navy flip-flops. But my boyfriend sent me a pair of Rainbows and now I do. 1 don't wear

them 100 often. I think they make my feet look fat. But that is just me, and most
other people who own a pair love theirs to death and wear them all the time. Sup
posedly, once you wear them in, your feet stop looking fat and the sandals be
come really, really comfortable. Whatever. Brand name aside, flip-Hops are the

best thing that ever happened to feet. Who could resist sandals that you just slip
on? No one. Indeed. You will own, and wear regularly, at least one pair of Hip
flops.

The You'll-Eventually-Get-Some Essentials:
1. A pair (or a few pairs) of designer jeans

a. $200 for jeans?! Are you insane?! You think that now, but sooner or
later the lure of designer apparel will get you, too. It's really not that bad.

Maybe 1 paid $150 for a pair of True Religions, but it was worth every
penny. Do they make my ass look amazing? Youbetcha. Do Hike my
ass looking amazing, and thus wear them all the time? You betcha.
2. T-shirts
a. Nothing beats waking up and going to class in a t-shirt and sweats.
Nothing. Even better if your t-shirt has something witty on it.

on eßay.
www.urbanoutfitters.com: 1 love Urban Outfitters. A little
daring, always trendy. A little on the expensive side, but well worth
the occasional splurge.
