# TURKEY DAY CRAFTS
## 
### NATALIE JABBAR INTERMISSION CRAFTER 
/,: i In the upcoming week, most of you will be pret
f ty busy. Being shuffled from one extended family
member's house to another. Stuffing yourself silly for
i ' 4 days on end. Enjoying friend blitzes where you try to see as
many people (that you actually stayed in touch with) as possi
ble. Shopping. Meandering around the Bay Area if you're stick -
Ving around campus. Eating some more. You know the drill.
However, during this week, many of you will also have more free
P time than you have had since school started. Because "free time" has be
come a foreign concept in the last three months, you might freak out a little
or even start to hyperventilate. That's not good. So you really have two options
at this point: confront your frighteningly girnormous pile of projects, papers and
problem sets and actually, you know, think and stuff....or regress about 10-15 years and
make some classic Thanksgiving day crafts.
Before we get started, let's just clear up the fact that many Thanksgiving Day crafts
are neither historically relevant nor politically correct. Despite the depictions of a Hall
mark-esque camaraderie between Squanto and William Bradford, things weren't exact
ly hunky-dory between the Native Americans and the Pilgrims (he minute they
stepped off the Mayflower. But that's beside the point. Whether you grew up here or
k have never experienced Thanksgiving in America, the following crafts are a must.
"Authentic" leather vests. Basically all you need is a standard brown paper
grocery bag for this one. Imagine a vertical line in the middle of the bag and
then cut the bag down the front along that line. You can then cither eyeball
the arm holes and an opening for your head and just cut... or actually mea
sure it out so that both of your arms can actually come out. Next, create a
fringe by cutting little slices at the bottom of the vest. This is essential. The
vest will not be authentic without the fringe. Finally, crumple the entire
thing up (gently, folks) so that it looks weathered. I In-crumple. invert
it so that it doesn't say Safeway on it (that kind of ruins the whole au
thentic thing), and voila. you have yourself a vest. If you're feeling
» overzealous. you can even decorate the vest with nature designs,

portioned to a six-year-old. fret hot - cropped vests are

crafts, you can; also
V **%, s %

some construction paper and feathers
and make yourself a headband. This one is simple.
Just cut the paper into strips about 2 inches wide and attach as V
many as possible to suit the circumference of your head stapling then.
strips would be preferable. As we learned the hard way, paste is always a /
bad idea. A very, very bad idea. Unless if you take pleasure picking dried \
Elmer's off of your fingers, that is (and some people around these parts do). All \
you have to do next is decorate and attach feathers. V
We can move onto the Pilgrim/Puritan crafts now. Unfortunately these are a bit more
complicated. Go online, look for some templates and then trace out belt buckles and col
lars onto construction paper. You get the picture. Word on the street is that those waxy toi
let seat covers actually double as snazzy Pilgrim collars. Yoiir second grade teacher prob
ably wouldn't approve, but that makes it all the better, doesn't it? Rebel! Rebel! Do be
careful though - they rip pretty easily.
Now that you're wearing your authentic leather vest and toilet-cover collar, it's time to I
explore cornucopias! What a fun word and ridiculous concept. A horn-shaped object filled
with vegetables? Amazing. These are especially fun to color, so try to get your hands on a
Thanksgiving coloring book or just print out pictures from the Internet. If you're more into
the 3-D thing, you could try to make a cornucopia out of an ice cream cone. Bugles or once
again, our best friend, construction paper. Have fun attempting to fit vegetables into these,
though. Several kernels of corn and baby carrots might work.
If you are actually interested in making useful crafts, you could also make place cards and
napkin holders. If you make them well enough, your family might actually use them this time
instead of "accidentally misplacing" them until after Thanksgiving — to give them credit, they
probably didn't want to set out bright pink place cards that said "Unkle Fill" alongside their
best china.
And finally, for the quintessential Thanksgiving craft: turkey hands! Directions are self-ex
planatory. If you don't have fond memories of clutching a Crayola in your clumsy fist as you
traced around your hands, you probably get the gist. These turkeys always turn out well
even if your hand accidentally shifts while tracing (hey, crayons tickle) and the best part
is, no scissors OR paste OR construction paper are involved. Unless if you want to cut
out and glue turkey onto construction paper - but who wants to do that, really? I bet
the kindergarten teachers who thought up turkey hands because they were too
cheap to buy stencils never knew that their idea would take the 1 hanksgiv- Jt J

Now you all have something to do to in between eating, shopping. J
