During a week in which the college football
world is engrossed with Ohio State-Michigan
and USC-Cal, a matchup between Oregon
State and Stanford seems insignificant.
But while tomorrow's contest may not fea
ture the most high profile or talented teams in
the country, it does provide as many interesting
storylines as any Cardinal game this season.
On one hand. Oregon State (6-4,4-3 Pacific
10 Conference) is one win away from bowl eli
gibility. The Beavers are on the verge of turning
around a season that featured an early season
42-14 loss to Boise State and a 41-13 defeat at
the hands of Cal. With tough games against
Oregon and Hawaii left on the schedule, this
week's trip to Palo Alto is the Beavers' best
chance to ensure an above-.500 season.
Meanwhile, Stanford (1-9, 1-6 Pac-10) is
coming off its first win of the 2006 season with a
20-3 win over Washington in Seattle last week.
The Cardinal's defense had by far their
strongest performance of the season and the of
fense did enough to win. With a victory on Se
nior Day, Stanford has a chance to put a re
spectable finish on a season that has been one
of the worst in school history.
"1 know that our team is excited after what
happened last week." Stanford coach Walt Har
ris said. "But 1 also know that they are ready for
the next challenge. This week it has been back
to business as normal."
Much of the Cardinal's success on the defen
sive end against the Huskies came against
Washington's passing game. The Huskies com
pleted just 11 of their 44 passes with three inter
ceptions and no touchdowns. But with the
Beavers and senior quarterback Matt Moore
coming to town, the defense will have to step up
once again.
"Their quarterback is having an outstanding
season," Harris said of Moore. "We are going to
give our players a plan that will give them a
chance, but it is up to them to make it happen.
The game is won by our players on the field."
Moore, a transfer from UCLA, has thrown
for nearly 2,000 yards and eight touchdowns in
the Beavers' first 10 games. In Oregon State's
stunning 33-31 win over USC in Corvallis on
Oct. 28, Moore threw for 262 yards, one touch
down and no interceptions.
"Oregon State has a lot of talent this year,"
said sophomore safety Bo McNally, who had two
interceptions, including one for a touchdown, in
his first career start last week against Washing
ton."The only game I've watched them play this
year was against USC. So that was a good
display of their athleticism and ability. I'm
sure Coach has a great defensive scheme for
us. and we'll take it to them. Obviously their
quarterback is very good, and we will have
to do a lot of things to contain him."
In addition to a powerful passing attack,
the Beavers' rush offense boasts one of the
most talented tailbacks in the Pae-10.
Yvenson Bernard is second in the confer
ence with 96.2 yards per game on the
ground, but has missed time this season

with an ankle injury.
The Cardinal managed to limit Bernard
to 81 yards and no scores in last year's 20-
17 victory at Reser Stadium. The Beavers
had a chance to tic the game in the final sec
onds. but Oregon State kicker Alexis
Serna's 52-yard field goal attempt fell
short. The win was the Cardinal's fifth of
2005, and turned out to be the last of the
season, as Stanford went on to drop their
next 11 contests.
But with a newfound confidence, the

Cardinal are itching for a chance to take
down the Beavers in what will be the final
home game for the team's seniors.
"Our seniors have gone through a really
tough four or five years, depending upon
the situation." Harris said. "Our coaching
staff, and me in particular, and our Stanford
supporters respect these guys and appreci
ate all the things they have done. We're try
ing to go out on the right foot for them and
play our best game in all three phases and
come up with a victory."

chance to ensure an above-.500 season.
Meanwhile, Stanford (1-9, 1-6 Pac-10) is
coming off its first win of the 2006 season with a
20-3 win over Washington in Seattle last week.
The Cardinal's defense had by far their
strongest performance of the season and the of
fense did enough to win. With a victory on Se
nior Day, Stanford has a chance to put a re
spectable finish on a season that has been one
of the worst in school history.
"1 know that our team is excited after what
happened last week." Stanford coach Walt Har
ris said. "But 1 also know that they are ready for
the next challenge. This week it has been back
to business as normal."
Much of the Cardinal's success on the defen
sive end against the Huskies came against
Washington's passing game. The Huskies com
pleted just 11 of their 44 passes with three inter
ceptions and no touchdowns. But with the
Beavers and senior quarterback Matt Moore
coming to town, the defense will have to step up
once again.
"Their quarterback is having an outstanding
season," Harris said of Moore. "We are going to
give our players a plan that will give them a
chance, but it is up to them to make it happen.
The game is won by our players on the field."
Moore, a transfer from UCLA, has thrown
for nearly 2,000 yards and eight touchdowns in
the Beavers' first 10 games. In Oregon State's
stunning 33-31 win over USC in Corvallis on
Oct. 28, Moore threw for 262 yards, one touch
down and no interceptions.
"Oregon State has a lot of talent this year,"
said sophomore safety Bo McNally, who had two
interceptions, including one for a touchdown, in
his first career start last week against Washing
ton."The only game I've watched them play this
year was against USC. So that was a good
display of their athleticism and ability. I'm
sure Coach has a great defensive scheme for
us. and we'll take it to them. Obviously their
quarterback is very good, and we will have
to do a lot of things to contain him."
In addition to a powerful passing attack,
the Beavers' rush offense boasts one of the
most talented tailbacks in the Pae-10.
Yvenson Bernard is second in the confer
ence with 96.2 yards per game on the
ground, but has missed time this season

with an ankle injury.
The Cardinal managed to limit Bernard
to 81 yards and no scores in last year's 20-
17 victory at Reser Stadium. The Beavers
had a chance to tic the game in the final sec
onds. but Oregon State kicker Alexis
Serna's 52-yard field goal attempt fell
short. The win was the Cardinal's fifth of
2005, and turned out to be the last of the
season, as Stanford went on to drop their
next 11 contests.
But with a newfound confidence, the

Cardinal are itching for a chance to take
down the Beavers in what will be the final
home game for the team's seniors.
"Our seniors have gone through a really
tough four or five years, depending upon
the situation." Harris said. "Our coaching
staff, and me in particular, and our Stanford
supporters respect these guys and appreci
ate all the things they have done. We're try
ing to go out on the right foot for them and
play our best game in all three phases and
come up with a victory."
