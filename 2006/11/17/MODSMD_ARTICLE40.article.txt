## Family guy has a video game...? 
### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION FAMILY MAN 
I'm going to start this off with a little back
ground. I love Family Guy. I sleep, eat,
breathe and snort Family Guy. I've watched
every episode and the movie a million times
over and I piss off all my friends by quoting
every one-liner in every episode exactly two
seconds before it's delivered. Yeah, I'm that
"Family" guy. With all that said, please take
into consideration my quick four word syn
opsis of Family Guy's digital foray: This
game is awful.
1 know I'm not supposed to talk trash on
Family Guy, it feels like I'm sinning in some
newfound and world-ending way. but I can't
help it; from start to finish, "The Family Guy
Video Game", is complete and utter garbage.
The game is structured much like an
episode of Family Guy, following three over
arching but separate storylines. Stewie pro
| vides a generic platformer, Brian presents us
I with your typical stealth-based missions and
(Peter's sequences are Nintendo-esque side
scrolling beat-'em-ups
You start the game off as Stewie, battling
I your arch-nemesis half-brother Bertram, in a
bid for world domination. Stewie's game play
centers around a myriad of jumping and
shooting puzzles. Armed with a ray gun
( which can be upgraded by collecting compo-
I nents throughout the game), a mind control
device (which can only be used when the
I game tells you), and a trio of balloons
I strapped to his back for extended jump se
quences you must lead Stewie and defeat
' Bertram. Stewie's segments offer the most
(pizzazz of any of them, not because they're
actually fun, but because they are less psy
, chotically frustrating than the others.

The second storyline follows Brian as he
tries to clear his name after being accused of
once again violating Carter Pewterschmidt's
prize winning race dog "Seabreeze". Every
single sequence of Brian's game is a good ex
ercise for learning restraint and should be of
fered in anger management course to tcach
self control: because God knows it took every
ounce of my willpower for me not to throw
my Play Station straight through the TV.
Every sequence is linear, with enemies
holding fixed patterns rather than randomly
strolling around so each level becomes a
practice in trial and error movement, forcing
dozens of errors before you finally map out
the patterns of everyone in the room, only to
move you onto an even more complicated
and infinitely more infuriating section. The
game designers tried to throw in little oddi
ties like costumes to disguise yourself, but if
you choose to ignore the costumes you will
lose every time, making them merely highly
glossed requirements that only serve to add
to the frustration.
I had to shut the game off at least 10 times
and take a break from extreme anger while
playing through Brian's segments and I'm

pretty sure I developed an unfortunate ner
vous tick, but 1 fought on; all for you dear
reader, all for you.
The third and final segment of the game
follows Peter as he tries to do soniwiuuig or
other, to be honest it really didn't matter
much. Basically, you march Peter through
Quahog and beat the ever-loving daylights
out of anything that moves, from grandmoth
ers with walkers to little kids trying to get ice
cream, nobody is safe from Peter's rampage.
While you progressively get more entertain
ing move combos such as leg sweeps and
head butts, the majority of Peter's game play
is a button-mashing fiasco with little direc
tion. The only time you have to pay attention
is when you switch targets because of eccen
tricities like you can't kick a grandmother

and you can't punch a
kid. I guess that

really, but I'll take

cutaway moments such as "Sexy Parties" or
'Fire-trucks in the Wild", little mini-game
segments are thrown in whenever a character
decides to stop and think of one. These mini
games usuaiiy last, at most, five seconds and
give you absolutely no warning or direction
as to what to do. Most of them entail mashing
buttons, twirling the game stick around, or, as
in my case, throwing the controller at the wall
and then screaming extremely unnecessary
curse words at my roommate.
Not all is lost, however. The game story
and all the dialogue is written by the same
guys who do the show and also features the
same voice actors, including the shows popu

and Wallace Shaw (Betram). While much of
