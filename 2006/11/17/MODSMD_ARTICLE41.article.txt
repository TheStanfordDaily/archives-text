# Drama goes mainstream With 'Cherry'
## 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM INTERMISSION ORCHARD FARMHAND 
It is a rare event when Stanford Drama pro
duces a "mainstream" play. The Department
seems to either be woefully unaware of its au
dience or gravely misjudge our toler
ance for the obscure. What prospective audi
ences might find palatable is what the depart
ment seems to eschew - more traditional, albeit
less experimental, plays from the vast canon of
works by playwrights one might actually recog
nize. Last year's "The Castle" was a perfect ex
ample of the well-intentioned but off-the-wall
type of show that has come to define theater on
campus rather than be a feature of it.

Therefore, 1 was naturally shocked - and ex
cited - to learn that this quarter, Anton
Chekhov's chef d'oeuvre "The Cherry Or
chard" was to be the main attraction. "The
Cherry Orchard" is widely held to be one of the
finest in Russian playwriting for its acute ex
amination of loss and our often-tragic relation
ship to the past.
The danger of doing such a production is of
course that its renown will open it up to more
critical opinions, should it lack the qualities
people want or expect to see in Chekhov.
Fear not, for this production far exceeds any
such expectations one might have.
"The Gierry Orchard" has always been met
with the dual nature of filling both genres of

tragedy and comedy. The master director
Stanislavsky produced the first performance as
a tragedy while the playwright insisted it was
intended to be "a comedy in four acts." This
show's cast, led by director Rachel Anderson,
masterfully walks that line. There are moments
of painful, tender and awkward sadness,
marked by Luba's inability to part with the es
tate or her past, which are inexorably tied. Yet
the play features characters such as Pischik and
Yepikhodov, ably played by two members of
the cast who counter the excruciating weight of
the play and break up dramatic times with hu
morous interjections. The balance of the gen
res, well exploited in this production, is neces
sary for the audience to fullv internalize the

level to which different characters fail to accept
simple facts and truths, something certainly not
reserved for fictitious characters in a dramatic
production.
Individual performances
in this new translation by Marina
Brodskaya, Anderson directs a stellar cast
from top to bottom. While the entire cast was
admirable, there are certain actors who de
serve special mention. (Warning; this review
has been written with the assumption that the
reader knows the general outline of the plot.
Thus, there may be some thematic spoilers in
the following paragraphs.)
The play centers around the Gaev family.
