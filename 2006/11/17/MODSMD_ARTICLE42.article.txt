recently relurned from Paris. The matriarch is
Luba, played by Emma Vaughn. Vaughn
holds court like the matron of the house, a fact
that belies her vulnerability. Vaughn captures
Luba's appearance of firm resolution in the
dynamics of her house, but she really is a frag
ile character who cannot cope with the loss of
the estate in a healthy way (she attempted sui
cide in Paris). Like Willy Loman in Miller's
"Death of a Salesman," Vaughn's character
struggles to live through her children's suc
cesses as a means of coping with her own in
adequacies. And like Russell Crowe's charac
ter in the recent film "A Good Life," Vaughn
plays Luba as torn between the old and the
new, the ancient and the current. Her reaction
is ci itical to Chekhov's piece as a work of so
cial commentary; she represents the conflict
ed aristocracy who must come to terms with
the changing definition of class.
Claire Slattery plays Luba's adopted
daughter, Varya. Slattery presents a thought
ful, if uncommon, depiction of Varya. While
she artfully portrays Varya's unyielding work
ethic, Slattery refuses to pin down Varya as a
wilting or self-pitying girl (she is often por
trayed as weeping constantly). Thus, with
Varya's future dependent on the survival of
the estate, Slattery shows her character giving
an earnest attempt to take control of her situ

ation, a relreshing representation from her
being constantly directed.
Stantord Drama veteran Nick Allen is won
derfully effusive as Gacv. He delivers the type
of performance that fills the stage, even when
he is not the center of the action. Ultimately,
Allen's Gaev is quintessential Russian aris
tocracy: He dresses and comports himself lav
ishly. something Allen complements with a
wonderful, haughty laugh, but Gaev lacks the
ability to substantively change his situation.
While much of the play's plot tits the
Stanisklvasky view of the show as a tragedy,
luckily for us there are Zach Chotzen-Freund,
Amin El Gamal and Vaentina Conde who
play Pischik, Yepikhodov and Chariot ta, re
spectively. Each actor revels in the nuanced
idiosyncrasies that make up his character.
Chotzen-Freund totters about the stage with
unparalleled aplomb. In the scene where he
dances with a chair, he is simultaneously
keenly aware of his location on the stage and
able to diligently follow the box step. More
over, he continues to deliver his lines, speak to
each section of the audience - and smile
broadly as he does it. The moment is genuine
ly laugh-out-loud hilarious, as Chotzen-Fre
und never bats an eye. It is also absurdly sad:
His character, as goofy as he is, deeply be
lieves in the aristocratic institutions through

which he has rooted his life and it that means
practicing dancing with a chair-so be it.
Like Chotzen-Freund, El Gamal firmly
understands the nature of comedic timing.
Physical comedy takes an artist to execute
and El Gamal seems to predict just the right
way to pop his head between the curtains and
deliver his line before flying off-stage from
the audience and presumably continuing with
further histrionics. The weird quirks of
Conde's Charlotta are equally amusing. Her
execution of the otherwise unremarkable
magic trick scene is on point. Brooding and
cynical, Charlotta wonderfully mocks the
elite, her magic trick alone pointing towards
the naivete of the aristocracy as she dupes
them at every turn. As a group, they help ease
the painful and uncomfortable parts of the
show.
Many of those awkward, squirming mo
ments are turned in by one of the finest per
formances in the cast, Daniel Chavez in his
role as Lopakhin. Chavez has a profound un
derstanding of Lopahkin's insecurity, his
pride, and his selfishness. Like the unpopular
student who returns for reunion a few years
later a jaw-dropping success. Chavez's
Lopakhin cannot but help flash his wealth.
This is especially true at the end of the play,
when he buys the orchard. At the moment we

learn that Lopakhin is the buyer,
Chavez delivers a famous and flaw
less monologue. With a veritable
glint in his eye, Chavez delivers the
speech where Lopakhin marvels at
how his peasant ancestors would
have delighted at his takeover and
his rise to great wealth.
For Chekhov, this moment
is significant for its representation
of the fluidity of social structure.
While Lopakhin is often portrayed
as evil for his ultimate betrayal of
the family, Chavez's performance
does not adhere to this strict di
chotomy. Instead, he is eloquent in
his hopes to save the family; Chavez
pleads that they will consider split
ting their property and paying their
mortgage. He shows an uncommon
but well-supported version of
Lopakhin: though undeniably an
opportunist businessman looking to
turn a buck, Lopakhin really wants
to help the Gaevs and does all he
can to save them first.
Other notables include Paz
Hilfinger-Pardo and Dan Hirsch as
the pair Dunyasha and Yasha. Inno
cent and naive, Hilfinger-Pardo's
Dunyasha swoons at Hirsch's char
acter and his pretentious criticism of
Russia compared to France. Of par
ticular note is Hilfingher-Pardo's
wonderful ability to turn on a dime
as her frustration boils with Yasha
boils over. Also, Kenneth Lam, in
his role as Firs, leaves the play with
an appropriate level of sobriety as
he. representing the oldest genera-

tion, bemoans
being left behind
as everyone de
parts for the
train station
without him.
Walking with a
limp and a

speak
ing with the trembling bass

of a man past his prime, Lam
poignantly shows the self-declared most ne
glected character in the play as a heartbreak -
ingly domestic figure.
Technical notes
The visuals of'The Cherry Orchard" meet
the minimalist standard, but appropriately so.
The bare set is bounded by audience on three
sides. The stage is a raised platform of hard
wood with only a faded yellow wall and two
entrances through it. A play about transition,
"The Cherry Orchard" invokes the sense of
renewal through change. Accordingly, all ac
tors double as stage crew as they transform
the set from the indoor "nursery" of the house
to the cherry orchard itself, complete with a
grove of tree trunks rising towards the lights.
Just as the actors drive the action, I loved see
ing them transform the physical stage as well,
swarming around and chatting (out of charac
ter) as they worked. This tactic was charming
ly effective here and not over-the-top.
The problem, however, with actors chang
ing sets is that the entire audience has nothing
better to watch than costumed actors at
tempting to fit pieces and set props together in
the half-darkness. One particularly cumber
some change came between the first and sec
ond acts (there is an intermission between act
two and act three) when the action moved
outdoors.
Costumes for this show were superb.
Flashes of old world, such as Lubya's party
dress, arc mixed well with swaths that hint of
the contemporary fashions, such as Pischik's
tuxedo in the same scene. Also, makeup suc
cessfully rendered Lam as a convincingly geri
atric Firs.
Finally, deserving high marks as well is the su
perb lighting of this show. Soft glow filtered
through the cherry orchard's trees and as the
play ended, a beautiful filter on the stage left
Firs to rock himself into a slumber.
Summary
I have not seen a play at Stanford with so
confident a cast. The direction allowed for
Chekhov's words to speak for themselves,
while smoothly integrating the various parts
that (are meant to) grind in the work. "The
Cherry Orchard" is a treat for theater enthu
siasts as well as, I am happy to report, those
for whom theater is but a tangential interest.
Whether you are going to the show to see
your dormmate, because you are a Slavic
Studies major or anywhere in between, I am
confident you will enjoy "The Cherry Or
chard."

Summary
I have not seen a play at Stanford with so
confident a cast. The direction allowed for
Chekhov's words to speak for themselves,
while smoothly integrating the various parts
that (are meant to) grind in the work. "The
Cherry Orchard" is a treat for theater enthu
siasts as well as, I am happy to report, those
for whom theater is but a tangential interest.
Whether you are going to the show to see
your dormmate, because you are a Slavic
Studies major or anywhere in between, I am
confident you will enjoy "The Cherry Or
chard."


Don't worry. The student actors don't look this old.

recently relurned from Paris. The matriarch is
Luba, played by Emma Vaughn. Vaughn
holds court like the matron of the house, a fact
that belies her vulnerability. Vaughn captures
Luba's appearance of firm resolution in the
dynamics of her house, but she really is a frag
ile character who cannot cope with the loss of
the estate in a healthy way (she attempted sui
cide in Paris). Like Willy Loman in Miller's
"Death of a Salesman," Vaughn's character
struggles to live through her children's suc
cesses as a means of coping with her own in
adequacies. And like Russell Crowe's charac
ter in the recent film "A Good Life," Vaughn
plays Luba as torn between the old and the
new, the ancient and the current. Her reaction
is ci itical to Chekhov's piece as a work of so
cial commentary; she represents the conflict
ed aristocracy who must come to terms with
the changing definition of class.
Claire Slattery plays Luba's adopted
daughter, Varya. Slattery presents a thought
ful, if uncommon, depiction of Varya. While
she artfully portrays Varya's unyielding work
ethic, Slattery refuses to pin down Varya as a
wilting or self-pitying girl (she is often por
trayed as weeping constantly). Thus, with
Varya's future dependent on the survival of
the estate, Slattery shows her character giving
an earnest attempt to take control of her situ

ation, a relreshing representation from her
being constantly directed.
Stantord Drama veteran Nick Allen is won
derfully effusive as Gacv. He delivers the type
of performance that fills the stage, even when
he is not the center of the action. Ultimately,
Allen's Gaev is quintessential Russian aris
tocracy: He dresses and comports himself lav
ishly. something Allen complements with a
wonderful, haughty laugh, but Gaev lacks the
ability to substantively change his situation.
While much of the play's plot tits the
Stanisklvasky view of the show as a tragedy,
luckily for us there are Zach Chotzen-Freund,
Amin El Gamal and Vaentina Conde who
play Pischik, Yepikhodov and Chariot ta, re
spectively. Each actor revels in the nuanced
idiosyncrasies that make up his character.
Chotzen-Freund totters about the stage with
unparalleled aplomb. In the scene where he
dances with a chair, he is simultaneously
keenly aware of his location on the stage and
able to diligently follow the box step. More
over, he continues to deliver his lines, speak to
each section of the audience - and smile
broadly as he does it. The moment is genuine
ly laugh-out-loud hilarious, as Chotzen-Fre
und never bats an eye. It is also absurdly sad:
His character, as goofy as he is, deeply be
lieves in the aristocratic institutions through

which he has rooted his life and it that means
practicing dancing with a chair-so be it.
Like Chotzen-Freund, El Gamal firmly
understands the nature of comedic timing.
Physical comedy takes an artist to execute
and El Gamal seems to predict just the right
way to pop his head between the curtains and
deliver his line before flying off-stage from
the audience and presumably continuing with
further histrionics. The weird quirks of
Conde's Charlotta are equally amusing. Her
execution of the otherwise unremarkable
magic trick scene is on point. Brooding and
cynical, Charlotta wonderfully mocks the
elite, her magic trick alone pointing towards
the naivete of the aristocracy as she dupes
them at every turn. As a group, they help ease
the painful and uncomfortable parts of the
show.
Many of those awkward, squirming mo
ments are turned in by one of the finest per
formances in the cast, Daniel Chavez in his
role as Lopakhin. Chavez has a profound un
derstanding of Lopahkin's insecurity, his
pride, and his selfishness. Like the unpopular
student who returns for reunion a few years
later a jaw-dropping success. Chavez's
Lopakhin cannot but help flash his wealth.
This is especially true at the end of the play,
when he buys the orchard. At the moment we

learn that Lopakhin is the buyer,
Chavez delivers a famous and flaw
less monologue. With a veritable
glint in his eye, Chavez delivers the
speech where Lopakhin marvels at
how his peasant ancestors would
have delighted at his takeover and
his rise to great wealth.
For Chekhov, this moment
is significant for its representation
of the fluidity of social structure.
While Lopakhin is often portrayed
as evil for his ultimate betrayal of
the family, Chavez's performance
does not adhere to this strict di
chotomy. Instead, he is eloquent in
his hopes to save the family; Chavez
pleads that they will consider split
ting their property and paying their
mortgage. He shows an uncommon
but well-supported version of
Lopakhin: though undeniably an
opportunist businessman looking to
turn a buck, Lopakhin really wants
to help the Gaevs and does all he
can to save them first.
Other notables include Paz
Hilfinger-Pardo and Dan Hirsch as
the pair Dunyasha and Yasha. Inno
cent and naive, Hilfinger-Pardo's
Dunyasha swoons at Hirsch's char
acter and his pretentious criticism of
Russia compared to France. Of par
ticular note is Hilfingher-Pardo's
wonderful ability to turn on a dime
as her frustration boils with Yasha
boils over. Also, Kenneth Lam, in
his role as Firs, leaves the play with
an appropriate level of sobriety as
he. representing the oldest genera-

tion, bemoans
being left behind
as everyone de
parts for the
train station
without him.
Walking with a
limp and a

speak
ing with the trembling bass

of a man past his prime, Lam
poignantly shows the self-declared most ne
glected character in the play as a heartbreak -
ingly domestic figure.
Technical notes
The visuals of'The Cherry Orchard" meet
the minimalist standard, but appropriately so.
The bare set is bounded by audience on three
sides. The stage is a raised platform of hard
wood with only a faded yellow wall and two
entrances through it. A play about transition,
"The Cherry Orchard" invokes the sense of
renewal through change. Accordingly, all ac
tors double as stage crew as they transform
the set from the indoor "nursery" of the house
to the cherry orchard itself, complete with a
grove of tree trunks rising towards the lights.
Just as the actors drive the action, I loved see
ing them transform the physical stage as well,
swarming around and chatting (out of charac
ter) as they worked. This tactic was charming
ly effective here and not over-the-top.
The problem, however, with actors chang
ing sets is that the entire audience has nothing
better to watch than costumed actors at
tempting to fit pieces and set props together in
the half-darkness. One particularly cumber
some change came between the first and sec
ond acts (there is an intermission between act
two and act three) when the action moved
outdoors.
Costumes for this show were superb.
Flashes of old world, such as Lubya's party
dress, arc mixed well with swaths that hint of
the contemporary fashions, such as Pischik's
tuxedo in the same scene. Also, makeup suc
cessfully rendered Lam as a convincingly geri
atric Firs.
Finally, deserving high marks as well is the su
perb lighting of this show. Soft glow filtered
through the cherry orchard's trees and as the
play ended, a beautiful filter on the stage left
Firs to rock himself into a slumber.
