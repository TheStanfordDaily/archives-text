## HOLIDAY HOOK-UP, FO SHEEZY 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION THANKSGIVER 
As we round the corner into the
holiday season, it is easy to get lost
in the hustle-bustle of Thanksgiving
feasts, trips to the mall and, of
course, quality time the ex
tended fam. Roxy knows as well as
any how tempting it is to throw on a
pair of XXXL sweats and watch
football on your couch all week.
But resist the call of couch-potato
dum and you may be sweetly re
warded - and I'm not talking pump
| kin pie.
That's light. Thanksgiving break
provides the perfect setting for get
ting some quick, no-strings-at
tached action! Whether you plan to
hang around your dorm or head
back home for Turkey Day, oppor
tunity awaits! And NOT in front of
your Dad's plasma screen!
While it may seem like sexual
suicide to stay co/ied up in your
one-room double, just remember:
Chances are likely that your room
mate is heading home. That's right,
your no-privacy libido-killing death
chamber will soon be transformed
into a sex-fair funhouse! Dust off
your handcuffs and ask your local
PHE for your free "supplies," and
get ready for a week of peace, re
iaxation and uninterrupted raunchy
romping!
But Roxy, you wonder, where
will I find another

warm body to .

keep me
company
when myl
roommate's

away? The choices are

not as slim as you may think.

Roxv suggests turning to the varsity
athletes. No, she strongly suggests
you do NOT become a full-time jer
sey-chaser. However, dabbling into
the world of perfectly chiseled abs
and tight, firm buttocks never hurt j
anyone.
For the conservative, less ambi
tious Roxy reader, the library may
be more accessible than the football
field. Students holed up in Bender

relatively sound-proof-
However, if you've decided to
stay as far from the library as possi
ble this week, Roxy identifies. But ; ;
mm mm s tc&fiM
for those headed home, be pre
pared to face the fact that every
one from high school still remem
bers you as the "scrawny, pizza
faced kid who was in marching
band and like, went to Princeton
or somewhere where the kids are
like REALLY nerdy." You don't
understand: You've been work
ing out, you ditched your trom
bone for a sweet gravity bong,
and the California sun is really
doing miracles for your skin.
However drastic your identity
change at college, it will be hard
(hard, but not impossible!) to
persuade Mister/Miss Popular
into the bedroom.
To remedy this situa
tion-well how can I put this? Lie.
Lie through your teeth. Tell Slut
ty Sue she hasn't gained a pound
since you last saw her. Fawn over
how bulging Hottie Hank's bi
ceps are. Skanky McStupid is
now interested in Electrical Engi
neering? You always knew she
had talents beyond cheerleading!
However, Roxy under
stands that some people have
morals. So for those of you who'd
rather take the honest route, your
best bet is to play up your college
image. Tell her about how hard it
is to fit in studying with all your
social events. It's so unreasonable
to expect students to juggle sav
ing the whales with such a strict
weight lifting regiment. Not to
mention word got out the first
week of school that you were
blessed with an eight inch...
Whether or not you feel
comfortable stretching the truth
(you're not really THAT big are
you? Or are y0u...), it is never dis
honest to invite a potential play
mate over for some harmless TG
activities. Throw a bag of Easy
Pop in the microwave, brew up
some cider, and snuggle by the
fire while listening to Kenny G.
Take a walk in the snow and talk
about "the good old days." Go
ice-skating. Do crafts. Then slyly
suggest she help you baste your
Turkey later...
Use this Thanksgiving
break to seal the deal on the AP
girl you always thought was cute
or take advantage of your room
mate-less love chamber. And of
course, be a good girl/boy and call
your parents and wish them a
"Happy Thanksgiving."
