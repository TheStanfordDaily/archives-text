# Inside The Game:
## Scissors 
### Christopher Anderson 
Oregon State quarterback Matt
Moore (8) is prone to hot-and
cold stretches, but he was certainly hot
in the Beavers' 33-31 defeat of USC.
Moore showed off his cannon of an
arm on the first play of the ballgame.
Sammie Stroughter (19) and Anthony
Wheat-Brown (17) lined up alongside
one another on the right side against a
5-2 zone alignment. Wheat-Brown
went deep up the right hash mark,
while Stroughter cut to the outside at
midfield. The Trojan safety got turned
the wrong way on the play, allowing
Stroughter to catch the rope pass from
Moore for a 22-yard gain. Moore and
Stroughter connected 8 times for 127
yards in the game.
