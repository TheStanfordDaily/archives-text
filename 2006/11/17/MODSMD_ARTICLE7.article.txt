### SAM BHAGWAT STAFF WRITER 
I loover Institution Senior Research Fellow Milton
Friedman, one of the most influential thinkers in gen
erations, died yesterday at his home in San Francisco.
The 94-year-old Nobel laureate legend was re
membered around campus and the world for his sub
stantial impact on the global economy and his contri
butions to the field of economics.
"I le's left a deep imprint on economics and pub
lic policy, more so than any other person in the 20th
century," said Economics Prof. Michael Boskin, a
friend of Friedman and the former chairman of the
President's Council of Economic Advisers. "He was
passionately committed to freedom, liberty and
choice for their own sake and for their consequences.
1 le was a great guy. a great human being, as well as a
great economist."
Friedman's longevity resulted in an intellectual
and political influence spanning six decades,from his
controversial role during World War II formulating
and implementing tax withholding to his last paper,
which concerned the Taylor rule, a guideline for the
Federal Reserve's policies.
"It was his dynamic view of the economy that in
fluenced me and others. I le emphasized the decisions
made by individuals, and stressed the economic free
dom concept." said Economics Prof. John Taylor, for
whom the above rule is named."l attribute the last 25
years of economic growth to his influence."
Friedman favored a policy of steady, moderate
growth in the money supply, opposed wage and price
controls and criticized the Federal Reserve when it
tried to fine-tune the economy. His work in consump
tion analysis, monetary history and stabilization poli
cy earned him the Nobel Prize in economics in 1976.
Friedman influenced not only economics and pub
lic policy, but millions of students who read his liber
tarian treatises. Senior Ray Seilie said that Friedman's
Capitalism and Freedom is one of his favorite books.
"Too many discussions in politics end up getting
polarized into either ideological or societal welfare
camps," Seilie said."What 1 particularly liked was his
ability to synthesize the abstract principles of liberty

with the beneficial social effects of relying on indi
vidual choice rather than government imposition."
Friedman's impact extended beyond the Hoover
Tower. He is credited as the brain trust behind
Reaganomics, the supply-side economic theory that
grew the economy through the 1980s. Besides play
ing prominent roles in the Nixon and Ford adminis
trations, he inspired revolutionaries and reformers
around the globe.
Boskin recalled Friedman's tremendous influence.
A group of economists in Soviet Russia had a con
traband copy of Friedman's classic Capitalism and
Freedom, and they would go upstairs at night and
read it bv candlelight so as not to get caught.

One of Ihe men was Vaclav Klaus, now the presi
dent of the Czech Republic.
"| Klaus] said it was this that made them realize
that they had to do something about Communism
Boskin said.
Robert Leeson.a visiting fellow at the I ioover Insti
tution who is publishing Friedman's collected writings,
said that Friedman's personality and his success were
deeply intertwined.
"Anyone who ever wrote him. from a seven-vear
old child to a Nobel laureate, he would write back," he
said. "He was a compulsive educator, but he wasn't

boring, pompous, or didactic. Milton
was on a lifelong mission to assist
people on their educational path."
Friedman graduated from Rut
gers University in 1932 and earned
his master's degree the following
year at the University of Chicago.
After World War 11, he taught at the
University of Minnesota, then re
turned to the University of Chicago.
He became a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford Uni
versity in 1977.
Colleagues noted that being on
the opposite side of an issue from
the affable Friedman was an unenvi
able position — at least from an in
tellectual standpoint.
"If you were opposed to him in a
debate, and you happened to get
him to concede there was a grain of
truth in what you were saying," said
Boskin, "you thought it was a great
victory, because it was so rare."
Friedman married Rose Director
in 1938.They had two children, Janet
and David, and Rose was co-author
of some of his books.
Boskin remembered Friedman
on the dance floor at his wife's birth
day party last year.
"He and Rose were not only easy
to admire and respect, but easy to
love," said Boskin. "They were
tremendously principled and decent
— and fun."
In fact, the Friedmans were
scheduled to leave for a cruise this
week.
