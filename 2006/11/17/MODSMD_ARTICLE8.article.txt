### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University Webmail users experienced de
lays and login problems yesterday due to tech
nical difficulties that were alleviated soon after
Information and Technology Services techni
cians reloaded the prior production Webmail
version last night, according to Nancy Ware, di
rector of planning and communications for the
organization.
The root cause of these complications re
mains unknown, but Information Technology
Services (ITS) officials ruled out a connection
with the problems they faced in October as a

result of the upward spike in email volume. As
of now. Ware said that technicians believe the
implementation of the new Webmail version
may have caused these difficulties.
"We believe that by reverting to the previ
ous version, this service is running smoothly
once again." said Ware. "We regret this recent
loss of Webmail service and understand how
frustrating it is to experience these types of de
lays when sending and receiving email."
ITS will continue to run the older produc
tion Webmail version. Ware said that any sys
tem changes or upgrades will be postponed
until Winter Break or later.
Students using programs like Eudora,
Gmail and Microsoft Outlook did not experi
ence a disruption in their email service. Ware
said.
Freshman Sumil Thapa said the complica
tions posed a serious inconvenience for him.
