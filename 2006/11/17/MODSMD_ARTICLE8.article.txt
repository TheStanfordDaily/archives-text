## Webmail woes continue ITS restores Webmail service by reloading previous version 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University Webmail users experienced de
lays and login problems yesterday due to tech
nical difficulties that were alleviated soon after
Information and Technology Services techni
cians reloaded the prior production Webmail
version last night, according to Nancy Ware, di
rector of planning and communications for the
organization.
The root cause of these complications re
mains unknown, but Information Technology
Services (ITS) officials ruled out a connection
with the problems they faced in October as a

result of the upward spike in email volume. As
of now. Ware said that technicians believe the
implementation of the new Webmail version
may have caused these difficulties.
"We believe that by reverting to the previ
ous version, this service is running smoothly
once again." said Ware. "We regret this recent
loss of Webmail service and understand how
frustrating it is to experience these types of de
lays when sending and receiving email."
ITS will continue to run the older produc
tion Webmail version. Ware said that any sys
tem changes or upgrades will be postponed
until Winter Break or later.
Students using programs like Eudora,
Gmail and Microsoft Outlook did not experi
ence a disruption in their email service. Ware
said.
Freshman Sumil Thapa said the complica
tions posed a serious inconvenience for him.
"1 was infuriated when Webmail
went down because I thought I
wouldn't be able to add my name to
the band roster for Friday night's
basketball game," saidThapa. "And
this added unnecessary stress during
midterm crunch time."
In contrast, senior Michael Sus
man said he was unaware that web
mail was temporarily down because
he uses other email services that
more reliably meet his email needs.
"1 don't use Webmail because it
doesn't save all my old messages, so
I'm more likely to lose them," Sus
man said. "Plus you can check your

email really easily from anywhere
with Gmail."
Niran Babalola, a senior and
Toyon RCC, said he shares Sus
man's anti-Webmail sentiment and
often encourages his residents to
use alternative email providers like
Gmail.
"It generally sucks and needs to
be changed," Babalola said ot Web
mail. "It's slow and ugly and it's not
user-friendly."
Ware said that ITS understands
students' frustrations and concerns,
and added that technicians will con
tinue to research methods to stream
line email services.
"We will continue to identify and
test solutions that improve the speed
of Webmail as well as the best ways
to implement new features." she
said.
