## Forum concludes homeless week Professor, unhoused man clear up common misconceptions, urge volunteer activism 
### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
If you've walked down University Avenue
recently, you've probably wrestled with the
question of whether or not to put change in a
panhandler's cup. That concern and others, in
eluding the problems of mental illness and the
stigma of homelessness, were addressed by
Prof. Don Barr and unhoused community
member Jeff Talley at an event about home
lessness yesterday.
The event, entitled "Homelessness and
I lousing," closed a week of Students Taking On
Poverty (STOP) events for National Hunger
and I lomelessness Awareness Week.
Barr gave a PowerPoint presentation about

how he began working with the homeless com
munity. his contribution to the recently built
Opportunity Center in Palo Alto and the im
portance of using "unhoused" rather than
"homeless."
"People I have talked to have told me,
'Don't use the word homeless. I have been liv
ing in this community for 20 years; this is my
home. I'm not homeless. I just don't have any
housing,"' he said.
Additionally. Barr said, unhoused commu
nity members have reported that the worst
thing about being homeless is the stigma and
"the way that people do — or don't — look at
you." Many of the unhoused have medical or
psychological problems, and the best way to
help is through housing coupled with medical
services, he concluded.
Jeff Talley, a resident of the Opportunity
Center who has been in and out of homcless
ness for the past five years, shared his experi
ences from the street and described the preju-
dice against like him.
"I worked jobs and tried to hide
the fact 1 was homeless," he said.
"When they found out I was home
less, their perception of me
changed."
For University students who vol
unteer with the unhoused, Talley
thanked them but also advised cau
tion.
"You have people out there who
can be perfectly normal on medica
tion and then will suddenly start
talking to a lamppost," he said. "And
you have criminals. No doubt in the
homeless community that there are
criminals. If you come down, you re
ally are appreciated, but never forget
where you are."
On the subject of panhandling.
Barr and Talley agreed that the
money received is usually used for
drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.
"I have put in three to four thou
sand hours of work, and I have yet to
put a dime in a cup." Barr said.
Audience members said they en
joyed the presentation, especially
Talley's candid description of life on
the street.
"It was a lot the things I had read
about,but the first time 1 heard testi
mony from an unhoused person,"
said STOP member Kathryn Kliff, a
junior. "There was no sugar-coating.
It wasn't about trying to pull on your

heartstrings."
Junior Debbie Warshawsky, the
founder of STOP, said that she
thought the discussion offered an
excellent way "to put a face on
homelessness" but stressed thatTal
ley's experiences were not shared by
all of the unhoused community. She
added that the presentation might
have been one-sided due to the un
expected absence of Mae Law, a
homeless woman who was sched
uled to speak.
"I think the speakers tonight gave
the impression that you should
never give to panhandlers, and I've
had a different experience with it."
she said. "When I was in Washing
ton. D.C., 1 interacted with an elder
ly woman who panhandled so that
she could have $10 a day to sleep in
someone's apartment. And the two
times the previous winter that she
didn't raise the money, she ended up
hospitalized."
"After tonight, people may think
that you shouldn't donate at all. 1
think they should think for them
selves. and it they do donate, donate
out of the goodness of their hearts,"
she said.
Despite differences of opinion on
the appropriateness of charitable
giving, audience members said the
event prompted feelings of empathy.
Fourth-year chemistry graduate
student Bridgett Payne summed it
up.
"Jeff was so personable and nor
mal," she said, "it made me realize
that they're not all that different
from us."
