often the case in areas subjected to wide

Al-Maliki visited Sadr City on Sunday af
ternoon and paid condolences to some of the
relatives of those killed Thursday in the
bombings, but as he drove away at the end of
his visit, several teenagers hurled stones at
his motorcade, residents said.
The challenges that Bush faces across the
region were evident to Jordan's King Abdullah,
who said the problems in the Middle Fiast go
beyond the war 111 Iraq and that much of the re
gion soon could become engulfed in violence
unless the central issues are addressed quickly.
"We could possibly imagine going into
2007 and having three civil wars on our
hands." he said, citing conflicts in Iraq,

Lebanon and the decades-long strife be
