## Editorial Board Summer already? 
### 
Wink- tall quarter is just beginning to
wrap up, next summer is already
looming in the minds of many stu
dents Application deadlines for intern
ships, jobs ;md research opportunities have
alrcad\ approached with many more await
ing m the upcoming weeks and months. Yet
even as the hype builds, there is no need to
panic.
In souk- uays. this seemingly premature
s lamentable. Students already
have enough to think about without wor
rying about exactly what they will be doing
in six months. What happens in the sum
mci ma\ be important, but current classes
and activities take priority. It is under
st • ndabk that employers want to plan
ahead, and that application processes for
competitive jobs and scholarships take
time, but the frenzied atmosphere that
starts yearl\ at about this time seems un
called for.
Much of the blame lies on the increas
ingly competitive nature of graduate
school idmissions. desirable jobs and
prominent scholarships like the Marshall,
Rhodes and Human. There is no question
that the qualits ol applicant pools is con
stantly increasing, and summers provide
another venue to try to stand out and
show one's merits. This is not inherently
bad, but the weight placed on one's sum
met activities may have troubling conse
quences.
One problem is the perception that cer
tain summer activities are absolutely nec
essary in order to achieve a further goal. If
you don't get an investment banking in
ternship with a top firm, your career is ru
ined. It you don't start a community serv
ice project that implements your own in
vention in a developing country, you'll
never get into grad school. None of this is
true. At Stanford we have students who
have done both of these and more, but
there are plenty of others who are equally
successful after graduation and chose dif
ferent, less glamorous paths. Ask anyone at
the I ndergraduate Advising and Re
search ottice or the Career Development
Center — what matters more is pursuing a
passion rather than performing a compul

sory task.
An additional downside of the high pres
sured summer is that it takes away from the
incomparable opportunity for students to
explore and grow. A multitude of college
students used to work in national parks
every summer, and though the jobs ranging
from park rangers to waiters and hotel staff
are not necessarily resume heavyweights,
the ability to spend the summer amidst na
ture used to count for a lot. But in the new
age of internships, places like Glacier Na
tional Park in Montana can no longer at
tract as many college students and hire sea
sonal international employees to make up
the difference.
Other important factors that affect
summer decisions are the need to make
money and sheer homesickness. Although
there are some paid internships and some
research opportunities provide stipends,
financial constraints can severely limit the
wide array of exciting summer opportuni
ties. While this is certainly a disadvantage
in some ways, there is a serious value to
lessons learned working jobs in basic
areas like retail and food service. Such ex
perience can demonstrate to employers
the ability to do real work, even when it
may not appear glamorous or unique.
Also, there is also nothing wrong with
finding a job that allows you to return
home. Particularly for freshmen, college
can be a difficult transition and returning
home for the summer should not be
scorned.
For college students.summers are an in
credibly unique period. ITiere are few
other times where so many options are
open and it is important to choose what is
best for yourself rather than following a
formula. For those aiming for the more
high-pressure environment, Stanford in
Government, the Haas Center, the CDC
and many other places on campus can help
you explore things to do during the sum
mer that are high profile and match your
own interests. But if nothing jumps out at
you. explore what you like rather than
forcing yourself into something unappeal
ing. After all, park rangers and waitresses
can still get into medical school.
