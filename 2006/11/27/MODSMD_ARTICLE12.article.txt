# Thanksgiving with my Mudder
## 
### 
Before I explain why I spent my break
watching other people play video
games and sleeping in someone else's
dorm room. I should say that my family
doesn't really do Thanksgiving.
I guess we just never took to the holiday.
My mom is a reluctant cook to begin with
(she thinks that my elementary school's les
sons on the food pyramid were only a trick
to guilt her into cooking rather than calling
Domino's), and with all of our relatives in
the fro/en motherland, there was no partic
ular reason to make a big gathering out of it.
We got invited to a neighbor's house one
year, which was kind of them, but rather
awkward and baffling.
"Why would you put whipped cream in
Jell-o'V I whispered to my mom. "And fruit
chunks?"
"Are those melted marshmallows on top
of the sweet potato?" she whispered back."l
thought it was a casserole?"
lb this day, I find Thanksgiving food
largely baffling, though I have developed a
taste for Stovetop stuffing (mmm.preserva
tives). I'll stick to solid Finnish fare like
blood pancakes, thanks.
I could have spent fifteen hours traveling
to B liani just so I could sit in my pajamas
watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day pa
rade. wondering it my high-school friends
had to hang out with their families all day.
Instead. 1 decided to visit my older brother
at his college. I larvey Mudd. He only had a
couple of da\s off for Ilianksgiving and he
wasn't going home either, so at least I would
be with family.
I should explain that my brother is a CS
major and his school is very... techie.This is
the kind of school in which a couple of guys
got into an argument about whetherphvsics
was a legitimate major, the math and CS
majors being of the opinion that it was a lit
tle bit soft. "It's all approximations," they
clucked. When somebody jokingly said he
was a humanities major, everybody burst
out laughing.
It takes a little bit of getting used to. liv
ing in someone else's dorm room. Especial
ly if it's Harvey Mudd. and the bathrooms
are unmarked ("I assume that other one is
the girls' bathroom, but maybe you should
ask someone. m\ brother shrugged), there
are more game consoles than girls in the
hallway, and there are no stairs to get to the
second floor.
Instead, as my brother demonstrated,you
climb up a lofted bed. hoist yourself onto

some not-very-sturdy looking planks
thrown across the top,and then pull yourself
onto the second floor through a gap in the
ceiling.
"You do not expect me to climb that," I
said.
Why not?" he responded. "It's perfectly
safe."
It was many things, hut perfectly safe it
was not. It was a rickety, wooden bed,lofted
to its top setting, with some unsecured
planks thrown across the top. which you
climbed up and then tried to balance on be
fore you hoisted your leg up to the second
floor and over the railing.
I his will be the last thing 1 see in my life,
won tit? 1 gasped as I tried to pull my leg
up over the railing while avoiding the gaps
between the planks.
Despite the threat of imminent death, I
had a lot of fun. in a pretty low-key way. It
was like being at a resort where nothing is
expected of you except to lie around and
watch pirated episodes of Mythbusters
troni the network and not kill yourself
climbing to the second floor. I learned
about 112 inal Fantasy X-2, although I found
the name confusing ("Why didn't they just
call it Final Fantasy XI?" "Because there's
already an FF XI." "So why didn't they call
it FF XII?" "Shhh.") We even went to see
Casino Royale in an actual theater al
though. as my brother pointed out, we
could ve watched it tor free off the net
work.
Hie only real issue was food, since my
brother thinks ot higher matters than hav
ing snacks in his room.eating lunch before 2
p.m. or eating breakfast (at all). Because his
dining hall was closed, 1 mooched apples
trom his obliging next-door neighbor,
whose door was graced with several apples
a day. courtesy of an unknown admirer. Nei
ther he nor my brother were particularly cu
rious about who it was.
As for Thanksgiving itself, I was worried
