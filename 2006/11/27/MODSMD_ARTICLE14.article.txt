In this week's New Yorker, George Pack
er declared, "we are all realists now," to
describe the changes that have taken
place in Iraq policy discussions since the
midterm elections. The recent appearance
of the term "realist" in the utterances of ad
visors and think tanks signals that the grand
plan of building a model democracy from
the rubble of Saddam's Iraq has been
scrapped for the sake of stability. Policy
makers are sensing the limits of the Ameri
can electorate's patience with a country
plagued by militias and insurgents, and they
have called in some all-stars from the
George H. W. Bush administration to help
wrap up Iraq. These new additions to the
White House's decision table, seemingly
brought in as antidotes to the influences of
neoconservatism, are cynical realists of the
Iran-Contra school. In their suggestions,
they advocate what would be unthinkable in
the Cheney camp — striking a deal with
Iran and Syria to save the American adven
ture in Iraq.
Last week's two high-profile assassina
tions should give both the new arrivals and
the old guard of George W. Bush's White
House cause for reconsideration. On the one
hand, there is the murder of Lebanon's anti-
Syrian Minister of Industry, Pierre Gemayel;

on the other, the loss of Aleksandr Litvi
nenko to the radioactive toxin.
It seems that everyone but the accused
governments blames the heads of the Syrian
and Russian states for these respective mur
ders. To be fair, no hard evidence has been
found to link Damascus or Moscow to these
acts. Yet we don't need proof about the
Gemayel and Litvinenko hits — indeed,
their deaths were truly needless —in order
to recognize that we must be cautious when
dealing with Syria and Russia.
Mr. Gemayel's assassination must re
mind the administration's new realists of
Syria's ambitions in the Middle East. If ne
gotiations on the future of Iraq are to in
clude Syria as a significant partner, the U.S.
must not give major ground to Damascus's
desire to control Lebanon. The Assad
regime has demonstrated that it is willing to

go to extreme lengths to reinstall its hege
mony over the Lebanese political system. 11
the realists of the elder Bush administration
are to live up to their reputation, they will
realize that they must not give Syria more
leverage to break Lebanon. For all the divi
sions in Lebanese politics, the prospects for
democracy are better in Beirut than in
Baghdad, and it would be a grave mistake to
sell an imperiled democracy for a nonexist
ent one.
As for Russia, the Litvinenko case is
highly disturbing, especially given its paral
lels to that ol Georgi Markov, the Brezh
nev-era Bulgarian dissident who was fatally
poisoned by KGB agents in London. But, as
with Syria, we do not need evidence of a
state-sponsored hit in order to be con
cerned about the direction the Kremlin is
taking, in the Putin years, Russia has re
vived its global spying apparatus with wor
risome aggression. Last Monday on BBC
Radio. Alex Standish, the current editor of
the Strategic Intelligence Review,said that
the work of Russian overseas intelligence
gatherers has grown dramatically since the
start of the millennium. According to Mr.
Standish, London was host to only one


Russian secret operative in the
year 1 991: by 2003, authorities were
able to identify 33 agents in the
British capital.
More recently, a standoff-prone
policy toward Europe has left I D.
leaders and heads of state in a fierce
debate about how to contain in
creasingly confrontational and ag
gressive Russian diplomacy. In what
seems to be an attempt to punish
former satellite states for abandon
ing the Russian fold in favor of
Western Europe, Moscow has taken
steps to hurt the economies of many
recent E.U. additions or NATO
hopefuls. Last winter saw a mixed
resolution to a high-stakes contro
versy over the price of Russian en
ergy in the Ukraine. As for current
E.U. states, a series of Russian bans
of Polish agricultural products was
set to dominate the weekend's
E.U.-Russia summit in I lelsinki. but
the event was instead hijacked by
furor over the Litvinenko affair.
Similarly, Russia has threatened to
impose a total ban of agricultural
imports from Europe when former
Soviet satellites Bulgaria and Ro
mania join the E.U. later this year.
The reason? According to the
Kremlin. Bulgarian and Romanian
foods do not meet Russian health
standards. Given that the Russian
journal Novaya Gazeta reported on
the 23rd that Russian alcoholic

products have been contaminated
with a toxic hepatite for more than
two months, the Kremlin's justifica
tion for its E.U agro-ban seems
highly suspect.
And so the lesson for the neo
conservatives still present in the
Bush White 1 louse: democracy can
break down in the sand like an
Iraqi Ozymandias. According to
the Times of London, one of the
major causes for suspecting the
Kremlin's culpability in Mr. Litvi
nenko's assassination is a recent act
of the Russian Parliament. This
democratically elected body voted
"to allow the FSB to undertake as
sassination missions abroad fight
ing terrorism" (which admittedly is
in the U.S. playbook as well) and
they also "widened the definition
of terrorists to include those who
gave moral support to Chechen
rebels and others seeking to under
mine the state."
Ilius did a democracy neatly and
literally kill freedom of speech. So.
while it may seem that the pro
democracy ideology of the neocons
was wrong, and that the harsh re
alpolitik of the Kissengerians will
serve to correct it. let's remember
one thing. From a realist's point of
view, the Middle East is a strategic
distraction of this decade. Not count
ing < liina, of course, the long-term
strategic challenge, for both the US.
and the E.U.. is the government in
Moscow.

wrap up Iraq. These new additions to the
White House's decision table, seemingly
brought in as antidotes to the influences of
neoconservatism, are cynical realists of the
Iran-Contra school. In their suggestions,
they advocate what would be unthinkable in
the Cheney camp — striking a deal with
Iran and Syria to save the American adven
ture in Iraq.
Last week's two high-profile assassina
tions should give both the new arrivals and
the old guard of George W. Bush's White
House cause for reconsideration. On the one
hand, there is the murder of Lebanon's anti-
Syrian Minister of Industry, Pierre Gemayel;

on the other, the loss of Aleksandr Litvi
nenko to the radioactive toxin.
It seems that everyone but the accused
governments blames the heads of the Syrian
and Russian states for these respective mur
ders. To be fair, no hard evidence has been
found to link Damascus or Moscow to these
acts. Yet we don't need proof about the
Gemayel and Litvinenko hits — indeed,
their deaths were truly needless —in order
to recognize that we must be cautious when
dealing with Syria and Russia.
Mr. Gemayel's assassination must re
mind the administration's new realists of
Syria's ambitions in the Middle East. If ne
gotiations on the future of Iraq are to in
clude Syria as a significant partner, the U.S.
must not give major ground to Damascus's
desire to control Lebanon. The Assad
regime has demonstrated that it is willing to

go to extreme lengths to reinstall its hege
mony over the Lebanese political system. 11
the realists of the elder Bush administration
are to live up to their reputation, they will
realize that they must not give Syria more
leverage to break Lebanon. For all the divi
sions in Lebanese politics, the prospects for
democracy are better in Beirut than in
Baghdad, and it would be a grave mistake to
sell an imperiled democracy for a nonexist
ent one.
As for Russia, the Litvinenko case is
highly disturbing, especially given its paral
lels to that ol Georgi Markov, the Brezh
nev-era Bulgarian dissident who was fatally
poisoned by KGB agents in London. But, as
with Syria, we do not need evidence of a
state-sponsored hit in order to be con
cerned about the direction the Kremlin is
taking, in the Putin years, Russia has re
vived its global spying apparatus with wor
risome aggression. Last Monday on BBC
Radio. Alex Standish, the current editor of
the Strategic Intelligence Review,said that
the work of Russian overseas intelligence
gatherers has grown dramatically since the
start of the millennium. According to Mr.
Standish, London was host to only one


Russian secret operative in the
year 1 991: by 2003, authorities were
able to identify 33 agents in the
British capital.
More recently, a standoff-prone
policy toward Europe has left I D.
leaders and heads of state in a fierce
debate about how to contain in
creasingly confrontational and ag
gressive Russian diplomacy. In what
seems to be an attempt to punish
former satellite states for abandon
ing the Russian fold in favor of
Western Europe, Moscow has taken
steps to hurt the economies of many
recent E.U. additions or NATO
hopefuls. Last winter saw a mixed
resolution to a high-stakes contro
versy over the price of Russian en
ergy in the Ukraine. As for current
E.U. states, a series of Russian bans
of Polish agricultural products was
set to dominate the weekend's
E.U.-Russia summit in I lelsinki. but
the event was instead hijacked by
furor over the Litvinenko affair.
Similarly, Russia has threatened to
impose a total ban of agricultural
imports from Europe when former
Soviet satellites Bulgaria and Ro
mania join the E.U. later this year.
The reason? According to the
Kremlin. Bulgarian and Romanian
foods do not meet Russian health
standards. Given that the Russian
journal Novaya Gazeta reported on
the 23rd that Russian alcoholic

products have been contaminated
with a toxic hepatite for more than
two months, the Kremlin's justifica
tion for its E.U agro-ban seems
highly suspect.
And so the lesson for the neo
conservatives still present in the
Bush White 1 louse: democracy can
break down in the sand like an
Iraqi Ozymandias. According to
the Times of London, one of the
major causes for suspecting the
Kremlin's culpability in Mr. Litvi
nenko's assassination is a recent act
of the Russian Parliament. This
democratically elected body voted
"to allow the FSB to undertake as
sassination missions abroad fight
ing terrorism" (which admittedly is
in the U.S. playbook as well) and
they also "widened the definition
of terrorists to include those who
gave moral support to Chechen
rebels and others seeking to under
mine the state."
Ilius did a democracy neatly and
literally kill freedom of speech. So.
while it may seem that the pro
democracy ideology of the neocons
was wrong, and that the harsh re
alpolitik of the Kissengerians will
serve to correct it. let's remember
one thing. From a realist's point of
view, the Middle East is a strategic
distraction of this decade. Not count
ing < liina, of course, the long-term
strategic challenge, for both the US.
and the E.U.. is the government in
Moscow.

In this week's New Yorker, George Pack
er declared, "we are all realists now," to
describe the changes that have taken
place in Iraq policy discussions since the
midterm elections. The recent appearance
of the term "realist" in the utterances of ad
visors and think tanks signals that the grand
plan of building a model democracy from
the rubble of Saddam's Iraq has been
scrapped for the sake of stability. Policy
makers are sensing the limits of the Ameri
can electorate's patience with a country
plagued by militias and insurgents, and they
have called in some all-stars from the
George H. W. Bush administration to help
wrap up Iraq. These new additions to the
White House's decision table, seemingly
brought in as antidotes to the influences of
neoconservatism, are cynical realists of the
