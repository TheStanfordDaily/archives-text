# Letters to the Editor
## IHUM considering changes 
### 
I would like to thank the Daily for the
thoughtful editorial on IHIJM ("IHUM
would benefit from structural reform ," Nov.
14). I also want to thank the more than 1200
sophomores.juniors and seniors who partici
pated in our online-questionnaire, at least
400 of whom provided supplementary com
ments. I am especially grateful to the 50 stu
dents who participated in focus groups.
As the editorial affirms. IHUM has come
a long way from the heated ideological de
bates of the past. In terms of the diversity of
offerings and degree of student choice
among freshman humanities tracks in Amer
ican higher education, Stanford's program is
second to none. We have been able to main
tain a traditional commitment to liberal arts
learning for freshman, while opening up the
curriculum to a range of perspectives un
heard of in similar core courses at peer insti
tutions. IHUM demonstrates the possibilities
— and challenges — of a shared discussion
of culture in a post-canonic era.

This success however is no reason to rest
on our laurels, and as the editorial points out,
the reactions to 11UJM among students are
mixed. Once we analyze the responses to the
questionnaires and the input from the focus
groups, we will finally he able to shed some
light on this matter and move beyond anec
dotal accounts. An initial look at the results
however indicates a wide range of student re
sponses to their IHUM experiences. Similar
numbers of students rank the program low as
rank it high. We have to understand better
why the program works well for some and
not for others. It is important that all types of
student responses are considered, positive,
negative and everything in between.
This examination of IHUM is part of a
self-study, now underway, as mandated by
the Faculty Senate. I hope to have a report
completed during the winter quarter. The
point of this self-study is to identify the
strong and weak points in the program in its
current shape. The questionnaire therefore
also asked students to evaluate different as
pects of the program. These results are
telling. The highest mark went to the fall

quarter lectures; this is the interdisciplinary
quarter with multiple faculty participants, a
unique feature of Stanford's program that
distinguishes it from parallel courses else
where. Interestingly, the lowest mark went to
the discussions, and this corroborates a com
ment in the editorial: an IHUM discussion is
only as good as student preparation and par
ticipation. One way students can improve
then 1 HUM experience is through greater
engagement in discussion — hut this holds
tor all classes.
I here is much to review and reconsider in
the structure of IHUM, and the suggestions
lor structural reform expressed in the edito
rial will definitely be part of the delibera
tions. In the meantime, however, I can only
endorse the editorial board's exhortation to
students: "Imagine how different IHUM
would be it the entire class actually did the
i eading thoughtfully and diligently."
