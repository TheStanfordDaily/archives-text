### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team
knew an average performance would not he
enough to heat No. 2 Washington. With that in
mind, the team played its best, sweeping the
Huskies on Friday night to clinch the Pacific-10
Conference championship.

The Cardinal (25-3, 16-2 Pac-10) finished the
conference season with a five-game winning streak
highlighted by Friday's surprisingly lopsided victo
ry over Washington (25-4,15-3). A sweep of Wash
ington State (15-17,3-15) on Senior Night put Stan
ford in sole possession of first place in the Pac-10
and served as a fitting send-off to the Cardinal's
four seniors.
"We have been through quite a bit this year,"
head coach John Dunning said. "We were 1-1 after
the first weekend of the Pac-10 but then went 15-1.
