# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## Women's team off to unusually slow start 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
A southern road trip this past week left the No. 11
Stanford women's basketball team out in the cold
;igainst top-10 opponents. After an easy 75-60 win over
Missouri at home last Tuesday, the Cardinal traveled to
Tennessee and Georgia, falling 77-60 to the No. 4 Lady
Vols and watching the No. 8 Lady Bulldogs slip by 74-69
in the last minute of play.
After high expectations had Stanford ranked No. 4 at
the start of the season, a 2-3 record has left the C ardinal
worried. Stanford has not started the season with that
record since the 1999-2000 season, when the women fin
ished the season 21-9 and lost in the NCAA second

round to Georgia.
Last Tuesday's game at Maples Pavilion had Stan
ford on the comeback after a disappointing 55-52 upset
by No. 24 Brigham Young. In a return to the double dig
its, sophomore guard Candice Wiggins led the Cardinal
with 21 points, while senior posts Brooke Smith and
Kristen Newlin had 14 points each. Newlin also had 10
rebounds for her second double-double of the season.
Stanford quickly pulled away from the Tigers with a
6-0 run in the first two minutes. Hie Cardinal main
tained their lead for the rest of the half, extending it on
a 15-2 run in the last five minutes to finish the half 39-22.

just 32.8 percent from the field to the
Cardinal's 47.5 percent. Lven after
going 8-for-20 in three-pointers —
four of which were by sophomore
guard Alyssa Hollins, who led the
team with 14 points — the Tigers
couldn't keep up. Stanford pulled
ahead by as many as 27 points in the
second half, sealing what became a
15-point win.
Two da\s later, though. Stanford
found itself on the other end of a 17-
point win by Tennessee, whose all
around depth allowed for an easy
victor)' in the heated rivalry. All nine
members of the Lady Vols con
tributed at least three points, as the
Cardinal were unable to break what
is now an 11-game losing streak to
Tennessee
Star sophomore Candace Parker
led the Lady Vols with 25 points and
nine rebounds. Last year at Maples,
the forward gathered 21 points and
10 rebounds in a closer 74-67 win.
Wiggins set off the night with a
three-pointer that gave Stanford one
of its two leads for the night.The sec
ond. taken on a layup by Smith, was
short lived when Tennessee turned it
around within 30 seconds. And with
16 minutes left in the first half, Ten
nessee secured the lead for the rest
of the game.
With the Lady Vols up 35-28 at
the beginning of the second half, the
Cardinal hoped to bring it back
around, but Tennessee went on a 10-
2 run midway through.
The Lady Vols' defense kept
Smith and Newlin locked down to
just four and two points, respectively,
for the night. Wiggins had only six
points in the first half, on her way to
18 total (including four three-point
ers). but it was freshman forward
Jayne Anpel who stepped up. Appel
had a season-high 23 points and five
rebounds for the night.
Appel also showed her potential
with 16 points and nine rebounds in
Saturday's match against Georgia.
Hoping to at least split the trip to the
Southeastern Conference, the Cardi
nal were looking for a season come
back against a ranked opponent.
The Cardinal began the first half
neck-and-neck with the Lady Hull
dogs. until a 9-0 run with less than 10
minutes left had Stanford playing
catch up. The Cardinal did just that,
thanks in part to three-pointers from

Wiggins and Smith in the last two
minutes, leaving Stanford down only
38-36 at the half.
The Bulldogs countered with a
lft-4 run in the first seven minutes of
the half, and with six minutes left in
the game, they were up 66-55. Sens
ing another loss. Wiggins and Smith
powered the Cardinal with 12 points
to bring the game within two.
Four free throws by freshman
guard Ashley 1 louts, however, main
tained the Georgia lead. Wiggins at
tempted a three-point jumper to tie
the game 72-72 but missed, leaving a
foul on Smith and two free throws by
senior guard Janese Hardrick (14

points) to seal the game.
Wiggins ended up with 24 points
for the day. while Smith had 19. Al
though Newlin only scored four
points, she had a season-high 12 re
bounds. The Lady Bulldogs' Cori
Chambers and Megan Darrah led
with 21 and 15 points, respectively.
Junior forward Rebecca Rowsey
also had 12 rebounds.
After the toughest week of its
young season. Stanford is now look
ing to forge on and live up to expec
tations. beginning with what hopes
to be a less challenging game against
Santa Clara this Wednesday night at
Maples.
