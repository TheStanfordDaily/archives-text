## Women's team off to unusually slow start 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
A southern road trip this past week left the No. 11
Stanford women's basketball team out in the cold
;igainst top-10 opponents. After an easy 75-60 win over
Missouri at home last Tuesday, the Cardinal traveled to
Tennessee and Georgia, falling 77-60 to the No. 4 Lady
Vols and watching the No. 8 Lady Bulldogs slip by 74-69
in the last minute of play.
After high expectations had Stanford ranked No. 4 at
the start of the season, a 2-3 record has left the C ardinal
worried. Stanford has not started the season with that
record since the 1999-2000 season, when the women fin
ished the season 21-9 and lost in the NCAA second

round to Georgia.
Last Tuesday's game at Maples Pavilion had Stan
ford on the comeback after a disappointing 55-52 upset
by No. 24 Brigham Young. In a return to the double dig
its, sophomore guard Candice Wiggins led the Cardinal
with 21 points, while senior posts Brooke Smith and
Kristen Newlin had 14 points each. Newlin also had 10
rebounds for her second double-double of the season.
Stanford quickly pulled away from the Tigers with a
6-0 run in the first two minutes. Hie Cardinal main
tained their lead for the rest of the half, extending it on
a 15-2 run in the last five minutes to finish the half 39-22.
