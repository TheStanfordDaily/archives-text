### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR

"It's really difficult, head coach Walt I lairis said
of the season."lt's as difficult as anything 1 have per
sonally had to experience. I'm sure,from our players
standpoint, it's as difficult as anything they have had
to experience in the area of football.
Stanford dropped to just 1-10 at home in the Walt
Harris era, and players made no bones about wh.it
that meant for the future of the program.
"It's important to play well at home, senior cor

nerback Brandon Harrison said. "If for no other rea
son, it's to give people around here some reason to
believe the way that we do. It's one thing to have the
team still be confident, but it's hard to play when the
stadium doesn't have any people in it. We haven't
played well enough for people to have an interest in
Stanford Football again."
The Beavers (8-4, 6-3 Pac-10), who downed
archrival Oregon 30-28 this past Friday, avenged last
year's 20-17 home loss to the Cardinal (1-10,1-7 Pac
-10).
Quarterback Matt Moore ran for a one-vard
score and threw for 176 yards and a touchdown
apiece to receivers Sammie Stroughter and Brandon
Powers. Stroughter's 28-yard catch tied the game at
7-7 midway through the first quarter. Powers' 15-
yard reception at the start of the second gave the
Beavers the lead for good.
Beaver tailback Yvenson Bernard ran for 168
yards on an incredible 36 carries to crack the 1.000-
yard mark on the season. One of the best running
backs the nation, Benson now has 1,102 rushing
