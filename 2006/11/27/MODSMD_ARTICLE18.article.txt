### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
A week ago Saturday, Oregon State thoroughly
beat Stanford in the air. on the ground and on the
scoreboard. 30-7. The Cardinal finished their 2006
home season with a humbling loss on Senior Day —
winless in the new, largely empty, Stanford Stadium.

"It's really difficult, head coach Walt I lairis said
of the season."lt's as difficult as anything 1 have per
sonally had to experience. I'm sure,from our players
standpoint, it's as difficult as anything they have had
to experience in the area of football.
Stanford dropped to just 1-10 at home in the Walt
Harris era, and players made no bones about wh.it
that meant for the future of the program.
"It's important to play well at home, senior cor

nerback Brandon Harrison said. "If for no other rea
son, it's to give people around here some reason to
believe the way that we do. It's one thing to have the
team still be confident, but it's hard to play when the
stadium doesn't have any people in it. We haven't
played well enough for people to have an interest in
Stanford Football again."
The Beavers (8-4, 6-3 Pac-10), who downed
archrival Oregon 30-28 this past Friday, avenged last
year's 20-17 home loss to the Cardinal (1-10,1-7 Pac
-10).
Quarterback Matt Moore ran for a one-vard
score and threw for 176 yards and a touchdown
apiece to receivers Sammie Stroughter and Brandon
Powers. Stroughter's 28-yard catch tied the game at
7-7 midway through the first quarter. Powers' 15-
yard reception at the start of the second gave the
Beavers the lead for good.
Beaver tailback Yvenson Bernard ran for 168
yards on an incredible 36 carries to crack the 1.000-
yard mark on the season. One of the best running
backs the nation, Benson now has 1,102 rushing

sophomore campaign.
'"He's a pretty special back," said
senior linebacker Michael Okwo,
Stanford's best defender. "To watch
him make some of the cuts that he
did. it was pretty impressive from a
linebacker standpoint."

"It was just a regular little inside
zone play for short yardage," Kim
ble said. "I was just real patient be
hind (lie line. 1 think a bunch of their
guys stopped playing and thought I
was down. The hole just opened up.
and 1 went through it."
The run marked the first time
Stanford had scored a game's first
points in 2006.
"It shows what we are capable of
doing," senior cornerback Brandon
I larrison said. "We forced them into
a three-and-out, made them punt
and then you see our guy run with so
much passion and get into the end
zone. That gave all of us a boost. I
just wish we could have kept that
momentum going."
But that proved impossible
against Oregon State's aggressive
defense. ITie Beavers sacked junior
quarterback T.C. Ostrander five
times and harassed him into an ugly
statistical performance — 9-of-25
passing with 125 yards and one in
terception.
The Cardinal knew that the best
way to beat the Beavers' defense
and slow down the rush was with the
deep ball, and they certainly tried.

Stanford completed five passes to
speedy, if unpolished, freshman
wideout Richard Sherman for 90
yards.
But Stanford will remember this
game less for the catches they made
than for the catches they should
have made.
"We missed some big passes,
some bombs, which we thought had
a chance," Harris said. "When you
play a team that plays like they play,
with those corners playing tight cov
erage. you have to hit those if you
want to stay in the game."
Sherman dropped a deep ball.
Okwo couldn't get two feet in
bounds on a would-be interception,
Ostrander threw a pick in the end
zone and, despite a successful Jay
Ottevegio fake punt. Stanford did
not stay in the game for long.
"It's hard to not win a game at
home for our fans," Kimble said. "In
our brand new stadium, we can't get
a win in it. That's hard and hurts a
lot."
The Cardinal walked out of their
stadium utterly disappointed and
defeated, yet again.
"1 think that it will probably be
tough next year for the guys, with
not a whole lot of excitement for the
season because of how we played
this year," Harrison said. "As a guy
who some people consider a leader
on this team. I wonder.'What could
I have done differently to make this
season a little better?"'
