## A 						21-0 run propels Card's 82-39 rout 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
Robin Lopez scored a game
high 13 points and pulled down 12
rebounds for his second double
double of the season to help lead
the Cardinal to an impressive 82-3 l >
drubbing of Denver on Saturday
afternoon at Maples Pavilion.
The freshman center scored all
of his points in the first half, al
though it was a second half run that
put the game out of reach for the
Pioneers. With 16 minutes left in
the game, the Cardinal (4-1)
opened a 21-0 run that extended to
almost seven minutes and pushed
Stanford's lead to 64-24.
"We came out in the second half
like it was a brand new game — 0-
0," sophomore guard Anthony
Goods said. "We tried to carry the
first five minutes. That ended up
turning into a big run."
Goods hit three of the Cardi
nal's 10 successful three-pointers
on the afternoon and finished with
11 points and five rebounds. Stan
ford combined to convert 43.5 per
cent of its attempts from beyond
the arc against a Denver squad that
couldn't stop Stanford's inside-out
side attack.
"Stanford put forth a tremen
dous effort," Denver coach Terry
Carroll said."They took the fight to
us. They dominated us in the paint
and shot the ball extremely well."
The Cardinal got a big boost to
their post presence from junior
center Peter Prowitt, who made his
first appearance of the season after
missing the first four games of the
year due to knee trouble. He
played only limited minutes but
still finished with five points and
five rebounds.
"1 think you can give a lot of
credit to Peter for our team's suc
cess," Robin Lopez said." It helps to
have as many big bodies inside as
possible. He definitely helped me
and the team."
Stanford will get another big
body back on Tuesday when Brook
Lopez is expected to make his Car
dinal debut. Brook Lopez missed
the opening games after having
back surgery in late September,but
he could play against UC-Davis if
he avoids any setbacks.
"Expect 35 points. 30 rebounds
and 20 blocks," Stanford coach
Trent Johnson joked. "He's been
cleared. 11 things go well in the next
few days we expect to take a look at
him on Tuesday."
Denver (1-4) was having
enough difficulty attacking the
Cardinal without the second Lopez
patrolling under the hoop.The Pio
neers shot 28.6 percent from the
field and were out-rebounded 46-
29. They especially struggled from
three-point territory, where they
made just four of their l l ) shots.
"Their strength and power were
keys," Carroll said. "We were
forced to live on the outside. When
you do that and your shots aren't
going down, sometimes it doesn't
work so well."
