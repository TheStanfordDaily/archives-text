# STANFORD OUTSOURCED?
## Students express dismay with new Stanford Fund management firm 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
Gathered in a hack room of the Frances C. Arrillaga
Alumni Center, students at the Stanford Student Calling
Center spend weeknights on the phone persuading alumni
to open their purse strings for the University, a job former
employees praised as fun and laid back.
But that all changed this summer, they say, when the Uni
versity outsourced management of the calling program to
RuffaloCODY, a national telemarketing firm based in
Cedar Rapids, lowa. Student callers decried the move and
the fact that they were not consulted before the change,
leaving most unwilling to return to their old jobs this fall.
WHAT HAPPENED
According to Stanford Fund Director Damon Cates, the
decision this summer to invite RuffaloCODY to manage the
call center was a practical business decision made to meet
the requirements of long overdue software and technology
upgrades. The company manages calling programs for non
profits and universities across the country, and even before
the shift, Stanford had been using RuffaloCODY software
for calls. Now. Cates explained, the call center has simply in
creased its relationship with the company.
"The integrity of the program has not changed." Cates
said. "It is still Stanford students calling Stanford alumni."
The decision to bring in new management, however, sent
shockwaves through the ranks of call center employees.This
summer.students discovered they would need to reapply for
their jobs through the new company, and that getting re
hired was no guarantee.
Worse still, they said, the switch to RuffaloCODY came
without any input from student callers or Greg Larson, the
program manager at the time and a 2005 graduate.
"1 thought that I would have been consulted seeing that
I was manager of the program," Larson said in an interview
with The Daily "But it had already been decided at the end
of May. They'd been negotiating for
three months and I'd heard nothing
about it. Damon Cates assured me
things would stay the same and there
was no mention of RuffaloCODY at
all"
Under Larson's direction, the call
center raised record-breaking funds
last year — more than $2.4 million.
I.arson said he quickly realized,
however, that his position was being
outsourced, along with all jobs at the
calling center.
"I was being laid off." he said, if 1
wanted to continue working with the
calling center, I would have to apply
through RuffaloCODY for a Ruf
faloCODY position."
In mid-August, RuffaloCODY
sent out an email detailing employ
ment processes for the fall to the stu
dent callers. Since Larson had been
told by his superiors to keep news of
the overhaul under wraps, the August
email was the first time students
heard about the change.
When the employees — who had
expected jobs to return to in the fall
realized they would need to reap
ply and re-interview, as well as an
swer to an outside company instead
of Stanford, many grew apprehen
sive. 'ITie students, like Larson, feared
the dynamics of the calling program
would change. And many said they
wanted to work for the University,
not RuffaloCODY.
Junior John Maas and other angry
students asked to meet with Stanford
Fund administrators and Ruf
faloCODY representatives.
"The real issue was that we had to
reapply and retrain for our jobs." said
Maas. who had worked at the calling
center .ill last year."We had all put in
a lot of time at the calling center and
we were all trained. It was really an
insult to us."
But the meetings achieved little.
While ("ates said he tried hard to ex
plain to students that this "wasn't
going to be much of a change at all."
Maas and the other employees only
grew more frustrated after the con
ferences. In a series of emails for
warded to the 80 or so student callers,
Maas and several other students who
had attended the meetings expressed
their disgust with what they per
ceived to be unresponsiveness on the

part of the University and Ruf
faloCODY to their concerns.
"It seemed like the administration
and the new RuffaloCODY people
assumed this job was something we'd
do regardless and we were just kind
of passive employees," Maas told The
Daily. "I think they made a big mis
take."
In the end. many students opted
not to return to the call center be
cause of the management change.
Larson, after initially deciding to stay
on. said he felt repeatedly disap
pointed by his dealings with the new
company. Dejected. Larson eventual
ly quit — leaving RuffaloCODY to
appoint a new manager with no Stan
ford connections.
A FAMILY AFFAIR
Former employees say the fun. in
formal atmosphere was what drew
them to call center jobs — an envi
ronment they feel has been threat
ened by the overhaul.
For Larson, who started as a caller
his sophomore year and worked his
way up to program director, the call
center was a second home.
"It was like a family." he said. "1
was worried that family feeling, ca
maraderie. and team spirit would be
lost by bringing in the corporate ele
ment and outsourcing our student
callers."
But did the students overreact?
Peter Ragias. the new program
manager and a graduate of lowa
State University, rejected the notion
that he is a "corporate element."
While his work philosophy deviates
from his predecessor's, he said he has
been working to keep the call center
fun and vibrant.
Ragias said he believes the former
callers have a misconception about
the new management, which he
hopes to amend.
"Very few of those who have been
concerned about the changes have
come to talk to me personally." he
said. "As soon as they come talk to
me, they can see I 'm not a 50 year-old
man."
Before the transition, students
could read magazines, do homework
and eat snacks at the phone while
they waited for the computer to dial
the calls — activities not permitted
by RuffaloCODY's policies. Accord
ing to Larson, these allowances had
contributed to the laid back environ
ment that made the call center such
an attractive place to work.
"These are students who have a

lot going on in their lives and they're
working at a job that's really hard."
he said. "They're calling night after
night, hour after hour. 1 understood
it was my role to make it a family
feel. It shows in our results. We
raised an enormous amount of
money. The transition was not in re
sponse to that performance. Maybe
restricting magazines is a good idea,
but personally 1 think it's an irrele
vant role."
Ragias. however, said he does not
believe that the new rules are unrea
sonable. Students can still read dur
ing breaks and keep the fridge
stocked full of food. I le even keeps a
box of candy on the table. But on the
phone, Ragias said he wants callers to
be all business.
"The alumni deserve the respect
of our undivided attention." he said.
"If you're chewing gum or eating
food, you're not showing that re
spect."
He has no problem letting callers
take flexible shifts during Dead
Week and finals, but expects them to
concentrate on calling when they are
scheduled to work.
"You guys are students first and I
understand that," Ragias said.
But, he added, students are paid
$13 an hour to work at the call center.
THE FUTURE OF TOE
PROGRAM
While the calling center posted an
impressive 86 percent employee re
tention rate in the past under Lar
son's direction, only a handful of for
mer employees have applied with
RuffaloCODY this fall.
Of the two who returned, one has
already quit.
Senior Tiffany Alvarez, a former
student manager at the call center
and also director of alumni relations
for The Daily, said she found the new
management under RuffaloCODY
"lacking in knowledge of Stanford
students and culture and completely

unwilling to learn."
"While Mr. Ragias says that the
energy and atmosphere of the calling
center is the same now as it was be
fore. 1 did not find this to be the case,"
Alvarez wrote in an email. "It is not
as fun — perhaps not fun at all. Also,
I did not find the new management to
be inviting or energetic. For example,
in my interview, Mr. Ragias said. "We
will have a professional relationship.
We will not be friends, but we can cer
tainly be friendly.' I did not find this
statement reminiscent in any way of
the old program. I felt the new man
agement style was condescending
and, at times, inappropriate. 1 felt un
comfortable there, which is why I
left."
After deciding to give Ruf
faloCODY a chance. Alvarez, a
three-year veteran of the calling cen
ter. resigned her job there this quar
ter.
Ragias. meanwhile, said he has
been working 12 hour days to recruit
new callers and study up on Stanford.
I le maintains that the calling center
is still one of the best places on cam
pus to work, build your resume and
give back to the Stanford community
at the same time.
"Obviously. Stanford's the best in
the world, so this should be the best
call center in the world." he said. "I'd
like to just make it exceed.constantly
do better than the year before, to
continue and grow that excellence."
On this point. Larson agreed with
his replacement, but still disagrees
with the University's decision to out
source the center, and the unsympa
thetic way it was communicated to
the student callers. These moves, he
said, will leave a lasting stigma on the
program.
"It saddens me to see most of our
staff quitting, when as far as I know
they were so happy to work there last
year." Larson said." I think that sends
a bad message. I think Stanford has
lost manv talented fundraisers."
