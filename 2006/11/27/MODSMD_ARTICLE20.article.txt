# Men earn win in final minutes
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford sports went one-for
two in last-second thrillers Friday
night. At Maloney Field. Clemson
squeaked past women's soccer in a
shootout in the third round of the
NCAAs, ending Stanford's season
in an agonizing fashion. But at
Maples Pavilion. Stanford men's
basketball used a 5-0 run in the last
two minutes to claw to a 58-53 vic
tory over heavy underdog North
western.
"Good win for us," Stanford
head coach Trent Johnson said.
"We were really disappointed in
the way we competed Wednesday. All in all. it's
nice to he 3-1 at this time."
Coming off Stanford's most lopsided home
loss since l l )82 to Air Force, this year's young
squad (3-1) found its poise against the Wild
cats (1-2) — but not without drama. Powered
by eight straight points from center Vince
Scott (11 points,3-of-3 three-pointers). North
western stormed to a 13-1 run to tie the game
.it 53-53 with two minutes remaining.
But sophomore guard Anthony Goods re
sponded with a layup. and freshman center
Robin Lopez — whom Scott had victimized
defensively throughout the Wildcat run —
blocked Scott's subsequent layup attempt.
The Wildcats were so intent on the next
possession on trapping the Cardinal's guards
to force a turnover that they forgot about
sophomore forward Lawrence Hill. Goods
found Hill with a great pass, and Hill made
sure the Wildcats didn't forget about him
again.
Hill threw down a thunderous two-handed
dunk to put the Cardinal up 57-53 with 26 sec
onds to go. It was the perfect cap to a night that
saw the Glendale, Ariz.-native explode for ca
reer-high 21 points on 8-of-14 shooting and
lead Stanford to a 40-17 rebounding edge with
nine boards, also tying a career-best.
"I tried to work within the offense and play
strong," Hill said.
Reserve senior guard Carlton Weatherby
iced the contest with a free throw with four
seconds to go.
The Cardinal built a 26-l ( ) halftime lead,
then used a 6-0 run midway through the sec
ond to build a 52-40 edge.
Sophomore guard Mitch Johnson (nine
points, three rebounds, two assists) displayed a
surprising offensive aggressiveness, attempt
ing eight shots and driving for two layups. 1 le
took a huge step toward becoming the third
scoring threat to prevent opposing defenses
from collapsing on Robin Lopez and Goods.
"People are going to sag off Mitch," John
son said. "He needs to drive into that gap and
shoot the open jumper."
Junior forward Taj Finger also had one of
the finer offensive games of his career with 12
points on 5-of-6 shooting and four rebounds.
Goods, meanwhile, went just 3-of-ll overall
and l-of-7 deep against Northwestern, a game
after his 3-of-15 overall and I -of-5 deep shoot
ing performance against Air Force.
On the defensive end, the Cardinal said
they were pleased with their effort against the
Wildcats' Princeton-style offense, the same
scheme Air Force had employed so effectively
just three days before.
"We're familiar with it," said Hill of the
Princeton offense. "We need to do what we
come out to do and follow our own rules."
