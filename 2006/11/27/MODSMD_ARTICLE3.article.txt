## Vandalism charges dropped While D.A. won't file charges, Band still banned from Big Game field show 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Several former Stanford Band members had at least one
thing to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.
On Friday, Nov. 17, Jay Boyarsky, the supervising deputy
district attorney for Santa Clara County, confirmed that no
criminal charges will be filed against the Band members
who allegedly vandalized the Band Shak at Serra Street and
Arguello Way in late July.
According to University officials, however, the Band is
still on indefinite provisional status and will not perform a
field show at Big Game this Saturday.
"After a thorough review of the excellent police report
submitted in this matter, which included extensive follow-up
investigation," Boyarsky said in an official statement to The
Daily."the Office of the District Attorney will not file crim
inal charges in the matter of the damage to the Stanford
Band Shak."
Boyarsky said he anticipated that the University would
take appropriate action against the students.
"We believe that there is insufficient evidence for us to
prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt unanimously to a
jury," he said. "There are adequate
systems in place at Stanford Univer
sity. including the Office of Judicial
Affairs and the recently formed
Band Reinstatement Committee,
[however,] which we trust will appro
priately handle this matter with an
eye toward restitution and accounta
bility."
Boyarsky was unable to release
any additional details concerning the
case, but Band members and Univer
sity officials confirmed that the Uni
versity would remain actively in
volved with managing the band and
controlling its behavior.
"We're glad this decision was
made, and we think it's a step to
wards getting past this unfortunate
incident,"said Band Public Relations
Coordinator Chris Holt, a co-termi
nal student in tinglish.' l lowever.the
issue is still a matter for the individu
als and the University to handle in an
appropriate matter. For our part, the
Band will continue to work to enter
tain and benefit the entire Stanford
community."
While Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman refused to
comment on the decision, citing the
University's long-standing policy of
non-interference in matters pending
before the District Attorney, he
stressed that the Band Reinstate
ment Committee would continue to
take the appropriate measures re
garding the Band's status.
"We were appalled by the prop
erty destruction caused by Band

members," Boardman said.
"Through the Band Reinstatement
Committee, Stanford is taking ap
propriate steps to ensure reimburse
ment for the damages, respect for
university resources and improved
communications between Band
members and the University admin
istration."
The committee, which began
meeting in October, will continue
meeting during winter quarter.
"The committee recently formed
subcommittees to examine the issues
outlined by Vice Provost Greg
Boardman, including leadership of
the organization, citizenship by its
members and the partnership be
tween the Band and the University,"
said Associate Dean of Students
Chris Griffith, who is serving as the
interim director of the Band and co
chair of the Band Reinstatement
Committee.
According to Griffith, the Band is
scheduled to participate in a number
of Big Game activities, including
events with the Cal Band in San
Francisco and celebrations on cam
pus. The Band is also scheduled to
travel to Cal for Big Game, but it will
not perform a field show.
Band Drum Major Bryan Schell.a
senior, said he was disappointed that
the Band will not be able to "make
other people happy" by performing a
field show at Big Game.
"It would really be awesome to
create some fun for the Stanford fans
out there, who will be surrounded by
a sea of blue and gold angry belliger
ent hatred," Schell said. "However,
we are going to take full advantage of
the small amount of time we still
have in the stands to show that we
can still bring the funk."
