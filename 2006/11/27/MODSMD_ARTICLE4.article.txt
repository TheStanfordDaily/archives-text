# BACK-TO-BACK CHAMPS
## Women's cross-country picks up second straight national title behind fourth-place finish by Arianna Lambie 
### SCOTT BLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the final event of the 2006 season, the No. I Stanford
women's cross-country team lived up to its top billing by
capturing its second straight national title at the NCAA
Championships in Terre 1 laute. Ind.The men's team fin
ished fourth, a two-place improvement from last year's
title meet.
The victory was the third NCAA championship in four
years for the women's squad, the favorite throughout the
season that was able to brush off the pressures of either
history or expectations.
"We've treated this season as it's own. not thinking
about pressure from last year's win or our position as fa
vorites," junior Arianna Lambie said. "So this champi
onship is exhilarating in its own right."
Lambie paced the women with a fourth-place finish in
the 6,000-meter race with a time of 20 minutes, 43.8 sec
onds last Monday morning. Lambie's time counted for
third place in the team standings because an individual
runner from Yale, whose team did not qualify as a whole,
finished just ahead of her.
The next Stanford runner to cross the line was junior
Teresa McWalters, who claimed 27th place in the team
competition (31st overall) in2l:lB.2.Sophomore I.indsey
Flacks followed in 45th (56th overall) in 21:43.1. Seniors
Amanda and Katy Trotter rounded out the Cardinal's top
five. Amanda claimed 58th place (70th overall) in 21:52.0,
and Katy finished in 62nd (78th overall) in 21:55.0.
Katy Trotter's 62nd-place finish was key for the Cardi
nal's posting at the top of the team standings. Each of the
top four runners from No. 6 Colorado, the runner-up. fin
ished ahead of the corresponding runner on Stanford's
roster. However, lYotter's finish well outstripped Col
orado's fifth runner, Erin Marston, who claimed 131st

place. That margin gave Stanford 195 points to Col
orado's 223, securing another championship for the Car
dinal.
Trotter finished 23 places ahead of the next-closest
fifth runner on the other contending teams.
"Several teams had the potential to challenge us."
Lambie said. "But none had the crucial fifth runner that
Stanford had. . .Katy [Trotter] is the most dependable
runner I know, and Amanda is as committed as anyone.
They are truly irreplaceable."
The race was also a success for the men's team, which
claimed fourth place in the team competition.The squad
had finished sixth at each of the past two NCAA Cham
pionships.
Junior Neftalem Araia played the major role in boost
ing the men's squad to its high finish by claiming second
place in the individual standings of the 10.000-meter race
in 30:44.9. Only senior Josh Rohatinsky of Brigham
Young beat Araia to the finish line.
Araia was soon joined by sophomore Garrett I leath.
who finished 41st (64th overall) in 32:11.4 and by junior
Forrest lahdooahnippah in 45th (68th overall) in 32:12.6.
Sophomore Hakon DeVries arrived in 52nd place (78th
overall) in 32:21.2. and senior Brett Gotcher rounded out
Stanford's top five with a 55th-place finish (81st overall)
at 32:22.2.
The close group of Cardinal runners finishing after
Araia propelled Stanford to a 195-point total in the team
standings, one point ahead of both No. 5 Arkansas and
No. h ()regon. allowing the Cardinal to claim fourth place
and a trophy for their efforts.
The result was also a measure of revenge against Ore
gon.which foiled Stanford at both the Pacific-10 Champi
onships and the NCAA West Regional this season. Those
disappointments fuelled the runners" drive and focus
heading into the NCAA Championships last week.
