"Stanford has such a vibrant community,

at ()xf( >ixl to help him tackle global develop

hopes to attend medical school in the Unit

"The ability to conduct scientific re

most powerful tools we have to promote de

hope to study the Malaria parasite.combin

I.emieux described his Stanford experi
ence as "wonderful" because he has been
able to participate in cutting-edge research
as an undergraduate as well as in several stu
dent organizations, including Stanford As
sociation for International Development,
the ski team and his fraternity.
Temieux encouraged Stanford students
who think they will apply for the Rhodes
Scholarship to take advantage of the faculty
and staff on campus.
"There are a huge number of resource
centers on this campus that are staffed with
incredibly talented and exciting people," he
said. "My advice to future applicants is to
seek those people out."
JULIE VEROFF
Veroff, 21. who developed a strong inter
est in women's empowerment and Sub-Sa
liaran Africa while working with non-gov
ernmental organizations in Nicaragua,
Ghana, Zambia and the Bay Area, said she
will study international development while
pursing a master of philosophy degree at
Oxford.
"There are not enough exclamatory and
positive adjectives out there to describe how
I feel about Stanford and the ways in which
the Stanford experience has shaped me."
Veroff said. "1 have met truly incredible
people with whom 1 have learned, laughed,
loved, struggled, stressed and grown. I really
can't believe I'm a senior, and while I'm
looking forward to Oxford, this will be a
very hard place to leave."
More than a week after interviewing
alongside other students and receiving the
news of her selection as a Rhodes Scholar,
Veroff said that it still feels "surreal."
" I"he whole process was one of the most
outstanding opportunities 1 have had to talk
with driven, interesting, wonderful students,
and 1 am so honored to have been given this
tremendous opportunity," she said.
After graduating at Oxford. Veroff said
that she intends to work as a researcher, pol
icy analyst and advocate with an interna
tional non-governmental organization on
critical humanitarian and security issues re
lated to development and women's rights in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Eventually she hopes
to become "a policymaker in the U.S. gov
ernment, where [she] will strive to promote
gender equality as a primary component
and objective of U.S. and multinational de
velopment policy."
Veroff said that the best advice she re
ceived when applying for the scholarship

was to be herself.
"The Rhodes as an award itself was not
my dream or ambition," she said. "Instead, it
was the chance to have a challenging and ex
citing intellectual and personal adventure
that would really push me to grow as an ac
ademic and as a person, and help me to
achieve my long-term goals in development
work."
NADIYA FIGUEROA
Figueroa, 24. the Jamaican Rhodes
Scholar, plans to pursue development stud
ies at Oxford in a doctoral program that
combines anthropology, history of political
science and economics.
"Interestingly,after a year in the working
world, observing how change does and does
not happen in Jamaica, I determined that I
wanted to more formally study different
models of small economy development,"
Figueroa said. "Specifically, I wanted to look
at how the technical expertise and social and
economic capital of the Jamaican Diaspora
can be engaged for national development
since this is one of our greatest untapped re
sources. About a month before the | Rhodes]
application process it began to really come
together in my mind, what I wanted to study
and what the application could be to the Ja
maican situation â€” this gave me the moti
vation to apply."
Figueroa said that she felt incredibly
honored to be selected.The night before the
formal announcement. Figueroa had the op
portunity to meet past Jamaican scholars, in
cluding literary figures, government leaders
and social development champions.
"I knew it would be an honor to be a part
of this grouping, so when i did learn that I
was successful, I immediately felt as though
1 was a part of something larger than that
moment," she said.
Figueroa, a former ASSU president, said
her experience on the Farm more than ade
quately prepared her for the selection
process.
"Stanford offers an environment in
which students have ample opportunity to
pursue public service, community involve
ment and student advocacy and activism,"
Figueroa said. "Throughout my Stanford ex
perience, I developed a firm belief in the im
portance of service and contribution to your
community, not necessarily from a selfless
and altruistic perspective, but from the very
pragmatic point of view that involvement in
extracurricular activities that inspire and
challenge you are critical to self develop
ment."

I.emieux described his Stanford experi

able to participate in cutting-edge research
as an undergraduate as well as in several stu
dent organizations, including Stanford As
sociation for International Development,
the ski team and his fraternity.
Temieux encouraged Stanford students
who think they will apply for the Rhodes
Scholarship to take advantage of the faculty
and staff on campus.
"There are a huge number of resource
centers on this campus that are staffed with
incredibly talented and exciting people," he
said. "My advice to future applicants is to
seek those people out."
JULIE VEROFF
Veroff, 21. who developed a strong inter
est in women's empowerment and Sub-Sa
liaran Africa while working with non-gov
ernmental organizations in Nicaragua,
Ghana, Zambia and the Bay Area, said she
will study international development while
pursing a master of philosophy degree at
Oxford.
"There are not enough exclamatory and
positive adjectives out there to describe how
I feel about Stanford and the ways in which
the Stanford experience has shaped me."
Veroff said. "1 have met truly incredible
people with whom 1 have learned, laughed,
loved, struggled, stressed and grown. I really
can't believe I'm a senior, and while I'm
looking forward to Oxford, this will be a
very hard place to leave."
More than a week after interviewing
alongside other students and receiving the
news of her selection as a Rhodes Scholar,
Veroff said that it still feels "surreal."
" I"he whole process was one of the most
outstanding opportunities 1 have had to talk
with driven, interesting, wonderful students,
and 1 am so honored to have been given this
tremendous opportunity," she said.
After graduating at Oxford. Veroff said
that she intends to work as a researcher, pol
icy analyst and advocate with an interna
tional non-governmental organization on
critical humanitarian and security issues re
lated to development and women's rights in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Eventually she hopes
to become "a policymaker in the U.S. gov
ernment, where [she] will strive to promote
gender equality as a primary component
and objective of U.S. and multinational de
velopment policy."
Veroff said that the best advice she re
ceived when applying for the scholarship

was to be herself.
"The Rhodes as an award itself was not
my dream or ambition," she said. "Instead, it
was the chance to have a challenging and ex
citing intellectual and personal adventure
that would really push me to grow as an ac
ademic and as a person, and help me to
achieve my long-term goals in development
work."
NADIYA FIGUEROA
Figueroa, 24. the Jamaican Rhodes
Scholar, plans to pursue development stud
ies at Oxford in a doctoral program that
combines anthropology, history of political
science and economics.
"Interestingly,after a year in the working
world, observing how change does and does
not happen in Jamaica, I determined that I
wanted to more formally study different
models of small economy development,"
Figueroa said. "Specifically, I wanted to look
at how the technical expertise and social and
economic capital of the Jamaican Diaspora
can be engaged for national development
since this is one of our greatest untapped re
sources. About a month before the | Rhodes]
application process it began to really come
together in my mind, what I wanted to study
and what the application could be to the Ja
maican situation â€” this gave me the moti
vation to apply."
Figueroa said that she felt incredibly
honored to be selected.The night before the
formal announcement. Figueroa had the op
portunity to meet past Jamaican scholars, in
cluding literary figures, government leaders
and social development champions.
"I knew it would be an honor to be a part
of this grouping, so when i did learn that I
was successful, I immediately felt as though
1 was a part of something larger than that
moment," she said.
Figueroa, a former ASSU president, said
her experience on the Farm more than ade
quately prepared her for the selection
process.
"Stanford offers an environment in
which students have ample opportunity to
pursue public service, community involve
ment and student advocacy and activism,"
Figueroa said. "Throughout my Stanford ex
perience, I developed a firm belief in the im
portance of service and contribution to your
community, not necessarily from a selfless
and altruistic perspective, but from the very
pragmatic point of view that involvement in
extracurricular activities that inspire and
challenge you are critical to self develop
ment."
