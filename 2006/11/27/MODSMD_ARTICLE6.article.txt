I lundreds of people are hitting the streets.
Long lines are snaking through our nation's
cities. We sit on the brink of economic war
fare.
The battle of video game consoles has
begun, and Stanford's sizeable gamer demo
graphic lias been closely following the action.
Thousands of eager gamers began camping
out in front of retailers for a chance to score a
Play Station 3 — more commonly dubbed the
PS3. On Nov. I 1 ). Nintendo officially released
its new console Wii. sparking a scramble
among gamers for the latest hardware, which
for now are about as hard to find as Iraqi
WMDs.
"We're sold out," said Ken Ng.an employ

Gamestop. a video game specialty retailer
that has been taking preorders for more than
a month.
"We had l(> available PS3s, and 36 Wiis,"
Ng said. "People lined up for them outside
hours before the store opened."

game consoles, promised cutting-edge
graphics and unprecedented, powerful hard
ware. It also is the more expensive of the two.

"Sony's l'S3 looks to win based on sheer
power." said (ireg Marecek. a junior. "If you
need the Sony-exclusive games of the best
eye candy, and price is no object, then the PS3
is the way to go."
And for some,cost has not been an issue.
"Sony is good at building brand loyalty
and lot of people love Sony," said junior Chris
Chen."Even though it's pricey. 1 think people
are going to swallow it."
Small and slender, the TV-remote-like

power. Unlike the traditional, thumb-driven
controller, it detects body movement: in a
sports game, you might swing it like an imag
inary tennis racket, while in a racing game,
you steer it like a virtual wheel.The Wii will go
for $250. less than half the price for the PS3.
"The Wii is the cheapest and looks to at
tract consumers by simple and fun gameplay,"
Marecek said. "But it is taking a big gamble by
changing the player-game interface as we
know it."
The oft-called "innovative" Wii has gener
ally not been seen to be in direct competition
with the PS3. 'ITie real brawl is between the
PS3 and the Xbox 360, which was released last
year. In addition to competing with their gam
ing capabilities. PS3 offers players the ability
to watch Blu-Ray Discs, while the Xbox reads
rival HD-DVDs.
"I kind of think of PS3 and Xbox as Sony
and Microsoft getting a foothold in the DVD
world." Chen said.
In the great drama of video game market
shares and economic strategy, these consoles
could make or break Sony, which many ob
servers claim is relying on the PS3 to be a
long-term hit. The iSuppli Corporation, a
market research group, however, has project
ed that Sony will lose about $300 on each con
sole.
Whatever the case, Stanford students have
expressed other concerns, among them price
and games available on each console. Many
games are available on only one system, in
cluding new versions of gamers' old favorites.
Game developers are still getting their feet
wet with the new technology to be found on
the PS3,and some believe that it will take sev
eral years for some games to become avail
able on the new console.
"Typically, I look for the machine that has

the most games that I want ti) play," Marecek
said. "The system could be the most powerful
one in the world, but if there's no good games
for it, then what's the point?"
"The Xbox 360 does have a one-year head
start." said Karl Gumerlock, a graduate stu
dent in mechanical engineering. "The delays
that plague the PS3 — for which its bleeding
edge architecture is primarily to blame — re
sulted in many producers moving their games
form being PS3-exclusive to cross-platform."
"PS3 games are going to look better in
three years, when developers get accustomed
to the platform," said Jon Gaw, class of 2006,
who headed out to play Xbox's "Gears of
War" with Gumerlock after he spoke with
The Daily. "But that's all in the realm of the
hypothetical. All 1 can see is that, now. the PS3
doesn't warrant an extra $200."
Gaw also said that he saw a "cultural di
vide" between the consoles, with Sony's
Japanese games markedly different from Mi
crosoft Xbox's primarily American ones.
"Americans like games with guns and foot
ball," Gaw said. "And I'm a shooter."
Many students said they were prepared to
buy the Wii but would prefer to wait on the
heftier PS3.
"It's more creative and more intuitive,"
Chen said. "I'll probably wait until prices
come down and kind of see how people
react."
"I plan on buying a Nintendo Wii," said
Marecek. "The controller looks revolution
ary, and I really want to play the new Zelda
and Monkey Ball. I'm going to miss playing
Halo on the Xbox, but I have friends with
Xbox 360."
"Sony seems unclear about exactly what
the PS3 will be and what it will come with,"
said freshman Daniel Wiesanthal. "The Wii
sounds like it's going to be great not just for
gamers, but for developers too."

Many students said they were prepared to
buy the Wii but would prefer to wait on the

Chen said. "I'll probably wait until prices
come down and kind of see how people
react."
"I plan on buying a Nintendo Wii," said
Marecek. "The controller looks revolution

I lundreds of people are hitting the streets.
Long lines are snaking through our nation's
cities. We sit on the brink of economic war
fare.
The battle of video game consoles has
begun, and Stanford's sizeable gamer demo
graphic lias been closely following the action.
Thousands of eager gamers began camping
out in front of retailers for a chance to score a
Play Station 3 — more commonly dubbed the
PS3. On Nov. I 1 ). Nintendo officially released
its new console Wii. sparking a scramble
among gamers for the latest hardware, which
for now are about as hard to find as Iraqi
WMDs.
"We're sold out," said Ken Ng.an employ
ee at the San Antonio Shopping Center
Gamestop. a video game specialty retailer
that has been taking preorders for more than
a month.
"We had l(> available PS3s, and 36 Wiis,"
Ng said. "People lined up for them outside
hours before the store opened."
I lie PS3, Sony's next generation of video
game consoles, promised cutting-edge
graphics and unprecedented, powerful hard
ware. It also is the more expensive of the two.
at a price-tag of around $(->()().
"Sony's l'S3 looks to win based on sheer
power." said (ireg Marecek. a junior. "If you
need the Sony-exclusive games of the best
eye candy, and price is no object, then the PS3
is the way to go."
And for some,cost has not been an issue.
"Sony is good at building brand loyalty
and lot of people love Sony," said junior Chris
Chen."Even though it's pricey. 1 think people
are going to swallow it."
Small and slender, the TV-remote-like
Wii. meanwhile.emphasizes play over horse
power. Unlike the traditional, thumb-driven
controller, it detects body movement: in a
sports game, you might swing it like an imag
inary tennis racket, while in a racing game,
you steer it like a virtual wheel.The Wii will go
for $250. less than half the price for the PS3.
"The Wii is the cheapest and looks to at
tract consumers by simple and fun gameplay,"
Marecek said. "But it is taking a big gamble by
changing the player-game interface as we
know it."
The oft-called "innovative" Wii has gener
ally not been seen to be in direct competition
with the PS3. 'ITie real brawl is between the
PS3 and the Xbox 360, which was released last
year. In addition to competing with their gam
ing capabilities. PS3 offers players the ability
to watch Blu-Ray Discs, while the Xbox reads
rival HD-DVDs.
"I kind of think of PS3 and Xbox as Sony
and Microsoft getting a foothold in the DVD
world." Chen said.
In the great drama of video game market
shares and economic strategy, these consoles
could make or break Sony, which many ob
servers claim is relying on the PS3 to be a
long-term hit. The iSuppli Corporation, a
market research group, however, has project
ed that Sony will lose about $300 on each con
sole.
Whatever the case, Stanford students have
expressed other concerns, among them price
and games available on each console. Many
games are available on only one system, in
cluding new versions of gamers' old favorites.
Game developers are still getting their feet
wet with the new technology to be found on
the PS3,and some believe that it will take sev
eral years for some games to become avail
able on the new console.
"Typically, I look for the machine that has

the most games that I want ti) play," Marecek
said. "The system could be the most powerful
one in the world, but if there's no good games
for it, then what's the point?"
"The Xbox 360 does have a one-year head
start." said Karl Gumerlock, a graduate stu
dent in mechanical engineering. "The delays
that plague the PS3 — for which its bleeding
edge architecture is primarily to blame — re
sulted in many producers moving their games
form being PS3-exclusive to cross-platform."
