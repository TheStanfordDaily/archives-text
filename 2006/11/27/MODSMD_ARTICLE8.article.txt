## Answers sought in NYPD shooting Angry crowd responds to police killing of unarmed man on his wedding day 
### DEEPTI HAJELA ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK (AP) - An angry crowd de
manded Sunday to know why police offi
cers killed an unarmed man on the day of
his wedding, firing dozens of shots that also
wounded two of the man's friends. Some
called for the ouster of the city's police com
missioner.
At a vigil and rally the day after 23-year
old Sean Bell was supposed to have married
the mother of his two young children, a
crowd led by the Rev. Al Sharpton shouted
"No justice, no peace."
At one point, the crowd of a few hundred
counted off to 50. the number of rounds that
are estimated to have been fired.
"We cannot allow this to continue to
happen." Sharpton said at the gathering
outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where
one of the wounded men was in critical con
dition. "We've got to understand that all of
us were in that car."
Some in the crowd called for the ouster
of Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly,
yelling "Kelly must go."
The police officers' group 100 Blacks in
l aw Enforcement Who Care said it was is
suing a vote of no confidence in Kelly over
the shooting.
Paul Browne, chief spokesman for the

NYPD. said Sunday: "We are continuing to
look for additional witnesses to shed light
on the incident, and assisting the district at
torney's office with its investigation."
Hie five officers were placed on paid ad
ministrative leave pending the investiga
tion. Browne said.
Community leaders planned a rally Dec.
6 at police headquarters.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his aides
were in contact with Bell's family and com
munity leaders throughout the weekend.
Bloomberg and Kelly also planned to meet
Monday with community leaders at Citv
Hall.
Hie shootings occurred at about 4 a.m.
Saturday outside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip
club where Bell's bachelor party was held.
The survivors were Joseph Guzman, 31,
who was shot at least 11 times, and Trent
Benefield,23, who was hit three times. Guz
man was in critical condition Sunday and
Benefield was stable.
Relatives of all three men — many of
them stoic, and some crying — attended
Sunday's vigil but none spoke publicly.
At a news conference Saturday, Kelly
said the department was still piecing togeth
er what happened, and that it was too early
to say whether the shooting was justified.
The car. driven by Bell, was struck by 21
of the police bullets after the vehicle

rammed an undercover officer and hit an
unmarked NYPD minivan. Other shots hit
nearby homes and shattered windows at a
train station, though no one else was in
jured.
Police thought one of the men in the car
might have had a gun but investigators
found no weapons. It was unclear what
prompted police to open fire. Kelly said.
It was also not clear whether the shoot
ers hiid identified themselves as police,
Kelly said.
Kelly said the confrontation stemmed
from an undercover operation inside the
strip club in the Jamaica section of Queens.
Seven officers in plain clothes were investi
gating the Kalua Cabaret; five of them were
involved in the shooting.
According to Kelly, the groom was in
volved in a verbal dispute outside the club
and one of his friends made a reference to a
gun.
An undercover officer walked closely
behind Bell and his friends as they headed
for their car. As he walked toward the front
ot the vehicle, the car drove forward—
striking the officer and a nearby undercov
er police vehicle. Kelly said.
The officer who had followed the group
on foot was apparently the first to open fire.
Kelly said. That officer had served on the
force for five years. One 12-year veteran

fired his weapon 31 times,emptying two full
magazines, Kelly said.
In total, it is believed 50 bullets were
fired, Kelly said. It was the first time any of
the officers, who all carried 9 mm hand
guns. had been involved in a shooting. Kelly
said.
Bell backed the car onto a sidewalk, hit
ting a building gate, authorities said. He
then drove forward,striking the police vehi
cle a second time, Kelly said.
The police department's policy on
shooting at moving vehicles states: "Police
officers shall not discharge their firearms at
or from a moving vehicle unless deadly
force is being used against the police offi
cers or another person present, by means
other than a moving vehicle."
In 1999, NYPD officers killed Amadou
Diallo.an unarmed West African immigrant
who was shot l l ) times in the entry to his
apartment building. The four officers in that
case were acquitted of criminal charges. In
2003. Ousmane Zongo, 43. a native of the
western African country of Burkina Faso.
was killed during a police raid on a ware
house where he repaired art and musical in
struments. Zongo was shot four times, twice
in the back.

"No justice, no peace."
At one point, the crowd of a few hundred
counted off to 50. the number of rounds that
are estimated to have been fired.
"We cannot allow this to continue to
happen." Sharpton said at the gathering
outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where
one of the wounded men was in critical con
dition. "We've got to understand that all of
us were in that car."
Some in the crowd called for the ouster
of Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly,
yelling "Kelly must go."
The police officers' group 100 Blacks in
l aw Enforcement Who Care said it was is
suing a vote of no confidence in Kelly over
the shooting.
Paul Browne, chief spokesman for the

NYPD. said Sunday: "We are continuing to
look for additional witnesses to shed light
on the incident, and assisting the district at
torney's office with its investigation."
Hie five officers were placed on paid ad
ministrative leave pending the investiga
tion. Browne said.
Community leaders planned a rally Dec.
6 at police headquarters.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his aides
were in contact with Bell's family and com
munity leaders throughout the weekend.
Bloomberg and Kelly also planned to meet
Monday with community leaders at Citv
Hall.
Hie shootings occurred at about 4 a.m.
Saturday outside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip
club where Bell's bachelor party was held.
The survivors were Joseph Guzman, 31,
who was shot at least 11 times, and Trent
Benefield,23, who was hit three times. Guz
man was in critical condition Sunday and
Benefield was stable.
Relatives of all three men — many of
them stoic, and some crying — attended
Sunday's vigil but none spoke publicly.
At a news conference Saturday, Kelly
said the department was still piecing togeth
er what happened, and that it was too early
to say whether the shooting was justified.
The car. driven by Bell, was struck by 21
of the police bullets after the vehicle

rammed an undercover officer and hit an
unmarked NYPD minivan. Other shots hit
nearby homes and shattered windows at a
train station, though no one else was in
jured.
Police thought one of the men in the car
might have had a gun but investigators
found no weapons. It was unclear what
prompted police to open fire. Kelly said.
It was also not clear whether the shoot
ers hiid identified themselves as police,
Kelly said.
Kelly said the confrontation stemmed
from an undercover operation inside the
strip club in the Jamaica section of Queens.
Seven officers in plain clothes were investi
gating the Kalua Cabaret; five of them were
involved in the shooting.
According to Kelly, the groom was in
volved in a verbal dispute outside the club
and one of his friends made a reference to a
gun.
An undercover officer walked closely
behind Bell and his friends as they headed
for their car. As he walked toward the front
ot the vehicle, the car drove forward—
striking the officer and a nearby undercov
er police vehicle. Kelly said.
The officer who had followed the group
on foot was apparently the first to open fire.
Kelly said. That officer had served on the
force for five years. One 12-year veteran

fired his weapon 31 times,emptying two full
magazines, Kelly said.
In total, it is believed 50 bullets were
fired, Kelly said. It was the first time any of
the officers, who all carried 9 mm hand
guns. had been involved in a shooting. Kelly
said.
Bell backed the car onto a sidewalk, hit
ting a building gate, authorities said. He
then drove forward,striking the police vehi
cle a second time, Kelly said.
The police department's policy on
shooting at moving vehicles states: "Police
officers shall not discharge their firearms at
or from a moving vehicle unless deadly
force is being used against the police offi
cers or another person present, by means
other than a moving vehicle."
In 1999, NYPD officers killed Amadou
Diallo.an unarmed West African immigrant
who was shot l l ) times in the entry to his
apartment building. The four officers in that
case were acquitted of criminal charges. In
2003. Ousmane Zongo, 43. a native of the
western African country of Burkina Faso.
was killed during a police raid on a ware
house where he repaired art and musical in
struments. Zongo was shot four times, twice
in the back.
