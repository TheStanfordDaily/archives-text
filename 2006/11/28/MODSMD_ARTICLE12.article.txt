# I am perfect in every possible way

### 
First things first. Vicky, kat. Sini and
Deborah. Thanks for your birthday
greetings. As promised, here's your
brief moment of fame. (Of course, since three
of you work at The Daily, this seems kind of
pointless, but a promise is a promise.)
Whilst arrogance is, in general, not a posi
tive quality, 1 can't help but feel that it is. per
haps. a little underrated (or maybe over-con
demned).
Self-promotion is (at least in theory)
frowned upon amongst the British (and, I sus
pect. by most Europeans). We prefer under
statement. knowing smiles and. most impor
tant of all, the adoration of the proletariat.
In America, on the other hand, the vigor
ous selling of oneself is the stereotypical
stereotype. Never mind boisterous, fat. rude,
stupid and devoid of irony; it is the towering,
loudly-expressed confidence of the Ameri
cans that irks Continental sensibilities.
[Since 1 am frequently misunderstood by
boisterous, fat, rude, stupid and un-ironic
Americans, let me make it clear at this junc
ture that I don't believe that the boisterous,
fat. rude, stupid, un-ironic stereotype holds.
I'm just noting the widespread belief in said
stereotype (boisterous, fat. rude, stupid, un
ironic) amongst many outside this great,
great land.]
Now. while blanket condemnation of the
acknowledgement of one's superiority may
seem reasonable at first glance, a closer ex
amination reveals that this naive view can be.

well, naive.
In particular, the heart of arrogance is
honesty. When you declare that bet
ter than someone, it is not necessarily just for
laughs. You are, in fact, fulfilling a sacred duty
to the Gods of Truth.
Sure, no one likes a show-off. But. on the
other hand, doesn't that just make the arro
gant all the more noble? They sacrifice the
good wishes of their fellow man in order to
facilitate a world free of false modesty.
So. arrogance is good. Hold that thought.
I'll be coming back to it in a bit. But. first, a
brief aside. (This is a transition.)
There's a well documented phenomenon
in academia (by well documented. I mean a
stranger once told me of it in a bar) known as
the "impostor syndrome."
Roughly speaking, it is the same as insecu
rity. Most of us firmly believe we shouldn't be
here. That we're not good enough. That
someone made a terrible mistake. That the
truth will come out and everyone will realise
we know nothing.

I"he impostor syndrome is endlessly fasci
nating. Almost everyone 1 know both suffers
and. at the same time, recognises the symp
toms in their peers.
Let me say that again. Everyone believes
that they are a fraud and. simultaneously, be
lieves that their friends are all mistaken in be
lieving the same.
ITiis is so tucked-up that I often lie in bed
contemplating, in quiet amazement, that it
could possibly be true. But it is.
Even as I write this, I'm stressing out about
the tact that my current research will soon re
veal me to be a fool and getting angry at one
of my fellow students for their repeated insis
tence on telling me that they are ignorant.
Which brings me back to arrogance. Arro
gance is the solution. We are all smart. We
may have many, many, many faults, but fail
ures ol ability, talent or intelligence are not
amongst them.
So embrace it. Wallow in your towering in
tellect (how s that for a mixed metaphor?).
Walk up to random strangers and give them
your ORE score. Pick up hot guys with ex
tended quotes from Byron. Pick up hot girls
with fractional-dimensional integrals. Accept
yourself.
Now, I must dash, I have to go and cry in a
corner while contemplating my stupidity.

/ 'lease note the phrase "we are all smart" only
refers to my fellow graduate students. Email
