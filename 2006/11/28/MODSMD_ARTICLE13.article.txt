Response to Editorial on Housing
Loophole
We are writing to clarify some inaccura
cies and misconceptions in the Nov. 13 edito
rial,"A loophole in the housing system." With
winter quarter Waiting List results an
nounced recently, we would not want the
misinformation in the editorial to lead stu
dents to make decisions that could result in
not receiving on-campus housing.
lo clarify, undergraduates are not re
quired to live on campus after their first year,
thus the housing assignment process is flexi
ble in that students may seek assignment to
only a few houses or to any residence. In
order to be guaranteed housing, students
must indicate on their applications that they
are willing to live anywhere on campus. Stu
dents may choose to "forego their guaran

tee" and list a limited number of residence
choices on their housing applications, but if
they don't receive an assignment during the
several quarterly assignment rounds, they
would need to live off campus.
Listing a limited number of residence
preferences in the Draw or on the Waiting
List may be the right option for some stu
dents, hut certainly not for all. Students who
are considering this choice should be aware
of several drawbacks to this decision.
First, as the editorial suggests, a much
smaller number of spaces are available dur
ing a waiting-list round than in the spring
1 lousing Draw, so students who were not as
signed in the Draw because they listed limit
ed residence choices may still not receive a
preferred assignment on the Waiting List.
During the autumn quarter Waiting List,
these students are competing for spaces with

students who accepted Draw assignments
out joined the Waiting List for reassignment,
students seeking reassignment may have
better draw numbers than others on the
aiting List, and thus would have a better
chance ot receiving the most popular spaces
available in the assignment round.
Second, students who were not assigned
in the Draw because they listed limited
choices will miss out on selecting their specif
ic rooms at spring room-assignment meet
ings.
ITiird, students who were not assigned in
the Draw will have less chance of being as
signed with group members to the same resi
ence and room because there are fewer
spaces available within each residence on the
Waiting List and at Walk-ins.
