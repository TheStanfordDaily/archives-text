Response to Editorial on Housing
Loophole
We are writing to clarify some inaccura
cies and misconceptions in the Nov. 13 edito
rial,"A loophole in the housing system." With
winter quarter Waiting List results an
nounced recently, we would not want the
misinformation in the editorial to lead stu
dents to make decisions that could result in
not receiving on-campus housing.
lo clarify, undergraduates are not re
quired to live on campus after their first year,
thus the housing assignment process is flexi
ble in that students may seek assignment to
only a few houses or to any residence. In
order to be guaranteed housing, students
must indicate on their applications that they
are willing to live anywhere on campus. Stu
dents may choose to "forego their guaran

tee" and list a limited number of residence
choices on their housing applications, but if
they don't receive an assignment during the
several quarterly assignment rounds, they
would need to live off campus.
Listing a limited number of residence
preferences in the Draw or on the Waiting
List may be the right option for some stu
dents, hut certainly not for all. Students who
are considering this choice should be aware
of several drawbacks to this decision.
First, as the editorial suggests, a much
smaller number of spaces are available dur
ing a waiting-list round than in the spring
1 lousing Draw, so students who were not as
signed in the Draw because they listed limit
ed residence choices may still not receive a
preferred assignment on the Waiting List.
During the autumn quarter Waiting List,
these students are competing for spaces with

students who accepted Draw assignments
out joined the Waiting List for reassignment,
students seeking reassignment may have
better draw numbers than others on the
aiting List, and thus would have a better
chance ot receiving the most popular spaces
available in the assignment round.
Second, students who were not assigned
in the Draw because they listed limited
choices will miss out on selecting their specif
ic rooms at spring room-assignment meet
ings.
ITiird, students who were not assigned in
the Draw will have less chance of being as
signed with group members to the same resi
ence and room because there are fewer
spaces available within each residence on the
Waiting List and at Walk-ins.
Fourth, following a waiting-list
round, unassigned students who did
not indicate that they were willing to
live anywhere on campus are subse
quently considered in a lower tier at
Walk-ins, after guaranteed students
who are willing to live anywhere on
campus. Thus, at Walk-ins, students
who previously were not willing to
accept assignment anywhere on
campus will probably not receive a
preferred housing space and will risk
not receiving on-campus housing at
all, especially during quarters when
housing demand is high.
Contrary to the editorial's asser
tion, students who refuse a housing
assignment forfeit their guarantee
status, their preferred year (if they
have designated the current year as
preferred), and their application
number. If they reapply for housing,
they are added to the bottom of the
Waiting List or Walk-ins after all stu

dents who have previously applied
but have not yet been assigned, in
cluding after unguaranteed students.
Students who refuse a housing as
signment are thus unlikely to receive
a "prime" housing space (and possi
bly any space) if they later reapply
for housing. On-campus housing is
especially tight at the beginning of
winter quarter, when a large number
of students return from overseas
programs. Students are not advised
to refuse winter quarter Waiting List
assignments if they want on-campus
housing.
Student Housing seeks to devel
op policies that serve the majority of
students well. In some cases, howev
er, a policy may create a hardship for
an individual student or may not
meet a student's special needs. For
these exceptional cases. Student
Housing has long offered a petition
process and a special application
process for students with disabilities
that enable students to seek excep
tions to policies or special housing
accommodations. These special
processes are not "loopholes" or
"threats" to the housing assignment

system, as the editorial suggests, but
are important parts of it.The process
for students with disabilities to seek
housing is also necessary to meet
Student I lousing's obligations under
Stanford's non-discrimination policy
and under the law. Petitions and dis
ability requests are reviewed care
fully and often require supporting
documentation. As with all activities
at Stanford governed by the Funda
mental Standard, students are ex
pected to use these services in an
honest manner.
We hope that this information
helps clarify the policies and misin
formation discussed in the recent ed
itorial. Students with additional
questions may visit the Student
Housing web site at http://student
