"There is no doubt that we had a
great team this season and did well,
but I know that everyone was
bummed to end like that against
Clemson." senior midfielder Shari
Summers said. "I think I can speak
for everyone and say that it was
hard to lose in penalty kicks and we
were the better team, but stuff like
that happens in soccer."
This marks the third straight
tournament match this year that the
Tigers (11-7-5) have tied and ad
vanced after the penalty-kick
round. Although the Cardinal (15-

game throughout the 110 minutes
of play, the team had trouble getting
on the scoreboard.
"We needed to finish our oppor
tunities." Summers said. "We didn't
just have shots, but we had quality
chances, and not putting away the
simple shots hurt us in the end."

of the season, posting IS shots to
Clemson's three. Freshman forward
Kelley O'Hara took control at the
start of the game, with a one-on-one

pair of corner kieks. Summers sent
the ball wide of the goal on the sec

first attempt was blocked.
The Tigers' goalkeeper, junior
Ashley Phillips, was a solid force
between the frames Friday with
seven total saves, marking her ninth
solo shutout of the season. She put a

stop to O'Hara's second one-on
one break in the last 10 minutes of
the first half.
Less than five minutes later,

season, almost put the Cardinal on
the scoreboard when her shot hit
the left post. A Tiger defender made
the clear to end the first half.

going into the break, but the score
was still 0-0. The Cardinal did not
let up on attack during the second
half, posting six more shots and
three corner kicks. The score re
mained 0-0 at the close of the sec
