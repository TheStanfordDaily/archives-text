# Cardinal ready for revenge on underdog Aggies
## Brook Lopez expected to make his Stanford debut 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
New faces will look to help Stanford men's
basketball settle an old score tonight at Maples
Pavilion.
The Cardinal (4-1) host UC'-Davis (0-5) at
7:30 p.m. Davis, a school better known for its
agriculture program than its sports teams, beat

Stanford last year in each of the three major
men's sports.The Aggies pulled the upset of the
year in football,2o-17,swept the Cardinal 2-0 in
baseball and defended their home court in bas
ketball. 64-58.
But this Stanford basketball squad looks to
have greater potential than last year's team.
And two major reasons why might step onto the
court tomorrow.
Freshman forward Brook Lopez, sidelined
with a back injury, may see his first collegiate ac
tion tomorrow. Brook's twin Robin Lopez,also a
seven-foot freshman.has impressed early.averag
ing over 11 rebounds and eight points per game.

and is quickly improving on the defensive end.
Junior center Peter Prowitt is returning from
an injured knee that sidelined him for the sea
son thus far. Prowitt, expected to add depth in
the post, saw 13 minutes in Stanford's last con
test. an 82-39 blowout of Denver. If tonight's
game is similarly lopsided, look for Prowitt to
see significant minutes.
Freshman center Will Paul also returns after
missing time with an ankle sprain.
Sophomore guard Vince Oliver (16 points,
five rebounds per game) and freshman forward
Shane Hanson (averaging 10 points) pace
Davis.
