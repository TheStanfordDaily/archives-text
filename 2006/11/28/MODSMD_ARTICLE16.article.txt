# Wii will rock you

Nov. 19,2(X)6 — a day that shall
go down in sports history.
With just a week before the re
lease of the Playstation 3, 1 had my
mind made up.
After months of sacrificing expen
sive romantic endeavors, 1 had accu
mulated just over $600 — enough to
purchase the FS3 from a local Bay
Area electronics retailer.
I swear, 1 was like a kid at Christ
mas. All my friends criticized me for
deciding to spend so much money on
the Sony console, as well as choosing
to sit outside Best Buy 17 hours in ad
vance for a crack at the wonderbox.
But encouraging words from my
priest reassured me.
That was until I called Best Buy at
noon, the day before the Playstation's
launch.
"Yeah, don't even bother showing
up," the underpaid store associate
told me. "Some people are already
bloodied. Others had milkshakes
thrown at them."
1 called other stores, but the re
sponse didn't change. My hopes for a
PS3 went up in flames quicker than
Michael Richards' career. But
Thanksgiving break was creeping up
quickly, and I needed something to
keep me entertained while I stayed
on campus with little company for an
entire week.
Little did 1 know that 1 would soon
find company in an old friend, a little
guy who had never before visited the
land of Hyrule: Link.
