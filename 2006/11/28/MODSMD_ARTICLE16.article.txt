# Wii will rock you

Nov. 19,2(X)6 — a day that shall
go down in sports history.
With just a week before the re
lease of the Playstation 3, 1 had my
mind made up.
After months of sacrificing expen
sive romantic endeavors, 1 had accu
mulated just over $600 — enough to
purchase the FS3 from a local Bay
Area electronics retailer.
I swear, 1 was like a kid at Christ
mas. All my friends criticized me for
deciding to spend so much money on
the Sony console, as well as choosing
to sit outside Best Buy 17 hours in ad
vance for a crack at the wonderbox.
But encouraging words from my
priest reassured me.
That was until I called Best Buy at
noon, the day before the Playstation's
launch.
"Yeah, don't even bother showing
up," the underpaid store associate
told me. "Some people are already
bloodied. Others had milkshakes
thrown at them."
1 called other stores, but the re
sponse didn't change. My hopes for a
PS3 went up in flames quicker than
Michael Richards' career. But
Thanksgiving break was creeping up
quickly, and I needed something to
keep me entertained while I stayed
on campus with little company for an
entire week.
Little did 1 know that 1 would soon
find company in an old friend, a little
guy who had never before visited the
land of Hyrule: Link.

The SoCal Bias
Yes. 1 purchased a Nintendo Wii.
and H was quite possibly the smartest
decision of my life. After mustering
up enough cash for the system, an
extra controller, an extra "num
chuck," two games and a three-year
warranty, I still had an extra $150 left
over from the original $6(K).
It wasn't until my friends and 1
cracked open the box that we realized
the sheer magnitude of Nintendo's
latest invention. We spent a good day
waving the completely interactive,
wireless controllers and looking like
complete idiots in the process.
All within the comfort of my
room, I was returning serves with a
backhand, knocking home runs, col
lecting a hole in one and tossing a
Hail Mary to Marvin Harrison. And
between all of it. I was still able to
break for a sip of Pepsi.
M\ mind wandered off as 1
thought of the possibilities for this
new technology. I dreamt of the day
Nintendo would launch FIFA 2(X)8
on the console with some sort of con
t roller extension for one's foot.
My friends and 1 would never have
to deal with employees at Burnham
I \ i vi I ion kicking us soccer players out
for wearing black-soled shoes — de
spite basketball players wearing the

same every day without reprimand.
But that's another story for another
day.
I '11 be able to hurl like future pitch
ing bust Daisuke Matsuzaka or set
like Bryn Kehoe — truly the nation's
greatest volleyball setter, thank you
very much, ESPN. Ill be able to beat
up Notre Dame's secondary like John
David Booty or force a tie with
Chelsea as a kicker for Manchester
United.
Just like LaDainian Tomlinson
preps for a game by lifting fifty-pound
dumbbells. Ill be able to condition for
a game of Madden by lifting a four
ounce controller.
Perhaps this technological revolu
tion could even play a hand in fighting
childhood obesity, a national epidem
ic that receives too little attention. For
once, kids will have to get off their
couch to finish that dungeon in
"Zelda" or toss some webbing as Spi
derman in "Marvel: Ultimate Al
liance."
The Wii may indeed be ushering in
a new era of indoor athletics — full of
hand waving and pivots — and with it
a sense of physical accomplishment
for video-game geeks everywhere. I
must admit my newfound confidence
in my physical ability to wave my
hand and pivot has driven me to
heights I could never have imagined
beforehand. Yes, I'm talking about
winning a boxing match, and that's
sure to impress the ladies, just as if 1
were Andrew Barragan.

N0v.28,2(X)6 — a day that shall go
down in history for when I admitted
that I need a life. Hut at least this geek
will be able to look proudly at his
strong hands.
