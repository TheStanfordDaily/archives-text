## Pandora music to the ears Alum says realizing his vision was not easy 
### LAURA RUMPF 
Tim Westergren, '88. the founder
of online music service Pandora, ad
vised students and community mem
bers last night to let creative inspira
tion — rather than financial concerns
— drive them post-graduation.
Westergren was featured as part of
the Freshman Dean's Office's "Be
ginnings" Series, in which alumni and
faculty reflect on how creativity has
enriched their lives.
"We want students to start think
ing about how to start a meaningful
life beyond the well beaten path"
said Dean of Freshmen and Transfer
Students Julie Lythcott-Haims.
Pandora is an online music service
that allows users to create individual
ized radio stations based on their per
sonal musical preferences. A Music
Genome built into the program ana
lyzes individual songs on 4(X) differ
ent attributes and matches songs a
user enjoys to ones with similar musi
cal characteristics. Users rate the
songs recommended by Pandora on a
"thumbs up" or "thumbs down" basis
and generate a play list of songs they
like based on what the genome deter
mines to be their musical taste.
Westergren first took his idea of a
musical genome to marketers as the
dot-com boom was beginning to burst
in the late '90s. I laving spent several
years after graduating from Stanford
as a struggling independent musician,
Westergren envisioned Pandora
being a medium for emerging artists
to gain exposure through online
channels, l ie hoped that unlike Ama
zon.com and other online music re
tailers. Pandora would help lesser
known artists reach new listeners.
"The challenge of the music indus
try online at the time was to expose
people to a much wider collection of
songs," he said before a crowd of
more than 70 in Cubberley Auditori
um.
The realization of his vision was
not easy.
"It wasn't uncommon to get an
eviction notice for our office on a reg
ular basis," he said of the company's
first few years.
After hundreds of marketing pitch
es. Pandora generated the money to
become an independent radio net
work in March of 2(X)4. By September
2005. Pandora was able to offer a free,
ad-supported service to online sub
scribers with access to thousands of
songs analyzed for their musical at
tributes — and not their mainstream
recognition.
Westergren credited his success to
meticulous user awareness and effec
tive public relations.
"I think business plans are a joke,"
he said with a smile. "It's all about con
vincing a group of people to get excited
about something."
Today, with four million regular lis
teners and praise from over 30,000
bloggers. Pandora can safely assume it
has a product people are excited about.
According to Westergren, at least 40
percent of users are buying more music
as a result of using the service.
Students praised Pandora's ability
to diversify their musical collections.

"I've used it to find new bands like
the Orange Peels," said freshman
Jimmy Chen.
By typing in the name of his favorite
band, the Meters, freshman Sam Pi
mentel was able to generate an entire
playlist of songs with similar musical at
tributes, all found through the Music
Genome.
As Pandora gains popularity and fi
nancial backing from advertisers, West
ergren assured the crowd that the serv
ices offered by the online radio net
work would improve. Among his goals
for the future, he expressed hope that
the service would become legal inter
nationally and expand to include musi
cal genres currently not offered, such as
classical.
"1 do not spend too much time
thinking about what happens next," he
said.
His inspiration remains to make a
"music middle class" and not to get rich
from the service.
"If you aim just to make money, you
won't last." he said. "That's not enough
incentive to go to work every day."
