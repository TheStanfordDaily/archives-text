# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Card left churning water Men fall to No. 1 Southern California, No. 3 UCLA in MPSF Tournament 
### ANDREW SHEN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water polo
team fell to top-ranked Southern California
on Saturday by a score of 5-3. By losing in
the semifinals of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) Tournament,
the Cardinal's season was stopped short,
ending all hopes of returning to the NCAA
Championship game.
In yet another defensive struggle against
the Trojans (26-0, 11-0 MPSF), Stanford
(17-9. 6-5) simply couldn't put up enough
offense in a tight game. Hach of the previ
ous two meetings between the schools were
Stanford losses, 3-2 in the 2005 champi
onship game and 6-2 earlier this season.
For Stanford, senior utility man J.I Gar
ton and freshman utility men Drac and Jan
son Wigo all scored once against the vaunt
ed Trojans' defense. But only one of those
goals was managed in the first half, as USC'

jumped out to a 4-1 lead.
A goal by Drac Wigo in the third quarter
cut the lead down to two (4-2) for the Car
dinal. hut that was the closest the team
would get. as USC's Juan Delagadillo
scored with five minutes left in fourth quar
ter. Janson Wigo responded with a Cardinal
goal three minutes later, but it was not
enough.
"Unfortunately, we fell short, but not
due to a lack of effort," senior driver Tyler
Drake said. "DSC has a very talented team
and at the very least. 1 am happy that we im
proved our play since the last time we
matched up with them."
Again, the Stanford defense came to
play, holding USC's three-headed monster
of senior drivers Juan Delgadillo and
Thomas Hale and freshman two-meter J.W.
krumpholz to one combined goal. Junior
goalkeeper Sandy Hohener performed
well, recording 12 saves.

MPSF Tournament, Stanford narrowly lost
to No. 3 UCLA (17-6.8-3 MPSF) 9-8 in dou
ble overtime. The Bruins battled back from
two three-goal deficits when the Cardinal
led 6-3 and 7-4 for the comeback victory.
Freshman attacker Scott Davidson scored
UCLA's game-winning goal with 1:22 left in
the second overtime.
Leading 7-5 late in the third quarter,
Stanford couldn't hold on. UCLA scored as
