### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite the picturesque and tranquil backdrop of the
Wailea Tennis Club in Maui, Hawaii, the match between
Stanford men's tennis and the University of Hawaii last
Tuesday proved to be anything but relaxing and serene.
The Cardinal rallied back from a 2-3 deficit to defeat the
Rainbow Warriors 4-3, winning the last two matches in
three-setters.
"Hawaii had a good regional tournament at Stanford,
and their top three are very solid players," head coach
John Whitlinger said."l had a feeling it was going to be a
tight match, and I really liked how we competed in the
match."
Stanford opened up the preseason event by winning
two of the three doubles matches and consequently, the
first point.The class of 2010 made a strong showing in the
doubles lineup, as each pair consisted of at least one
freshman player.
"We came out and played very well in doubles,"
Whitlinger said. "It was really important to get that [first]
point."
Sophomore Blake Muller teamed up with freshman
Paul Morrissey to earn an 8-5 win while senior Eric McK
ean and freshman Richard Wire formed a veteran-new
comer pair to pick up an 8-4 victory. Muller and Morris
sey are now 5-1 as a duo, having advanced to the finals of
the ITA Regional Tournament earlier this fall.
Junior Chris Rasmussen and freshman Kevin Kaiser
fell just short of collecting a 'W' and sweeping the dou
bles matches.The tandem lost 8-7 (8) in a tiebreaker to a
pair of Hawaii seniors.
Stanford led 1-0 after doubles, but the competition
from both teams proved to be fierce in singles competi
tion, with five of the six matches stretching to split sets.
The results from doubles to singles reversed, with Stan
ford excelling at the top of the doubles lineup and the
bottom of the singles roster.
Although the Cardinal claimed the top two doubles
matches, they dropped the top three singles matches.
Wire played the only straight-set match of the day, nar
rowly losing 6-4,7-5 in the top singles position.
At the second singles spot, senior James Wan rallied
back after dropping the first set. but ultimately fell in the
third. 7-5. While Muller picked up the first set 6-4. his op
ponent collected the following sets to complete the
sweep of the top half of singles.
"At [the top singles spot]. [Richard] played a really
good match against a very good player but couldn't quite
pull it out," Whitlinger said. "Win or lose, I thought our
guys fought really well."
In the fourth and sixth singles positions, McKean and
Morrissey dropped their first and second sets, respective

ly, but were both able to come back and win their third
and final sets. McKean's opponent, Jeff Fitch, led 5-4 in
the third and had the opportunity to serve for the match,
but the Stanford senior broke Fitch twice in the final
three games of the match to pick up the third set. 7-5, and
the match.
With the overall score tied at three all. Kaiser's match
against Chad Faulk would determine Tuesday's outcome.
The Cardinal freshman won the first set 6-3, before losing
10 of the following 11 games. After Faulk denied Kaiser a
single game in the second set, the Rainbow Warrior led 4-
l.with victory looming on the horizon for Hawaii.
Despite being two games from defeat. Kaiser refused
to let Stanford lose in his first collegiate dual match.The
Cardinal fought and won the final five games of the
match to secure Stanford's 4-3 victory over Hawai'i.
"[Volunteer Assistant Coach] JJ [Whitlinger] didn't
tell Kevin the [overall] score of the match." John
Whitlinger said."Kevin just went out and played. I've got
to give JJ some credit for keeping [Kevin] in the match
and Kevin for coming back and winning five [straight]
games in the third.
"When [Kevin] served for the match at 5-4. he got
down 0-30 but came up with some good shots and just
kept playing," Whitlinger continued. "I was really proud
of everybody, but it was nice to see the freshmen step up
when they had to."
Stanford returns to competition Jan. 12-15 at the Sher
wood Cup in Thousand Oaks, Calif.The first home match
of the season is scheduled for Jan. 27 against Boise State.
