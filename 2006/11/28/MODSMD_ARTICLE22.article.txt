# Women satisfied with exhibition sweep, thankful for time to bond
## 
### JACK SALISBURY 
With an easy 7-0 exhibition win
over the University of Hawaii last
Tuesday, the Stanford women's ten
nis team spent the rest of the
Thanksgiving break soaking up the
Pacific sun.
The Cardinal's exhibition was
played in the form of a regular
match, consisting of three doubles
matches and six singles matches.
Stanford didn't have much trouble
sweeping the Rainbow Wahine.
The Cardinal won every single
match in straight sets. Many of the
sets were wholly one-sided, includ
ing sophomore Jessica Nyugen's 6-
0, 6-0 defeat of Chloe Bihag.
Hawaii's lone chance to take a set
came when the Wahine's Jacqui Wil
ilams challenged freshman Lindsay
Burdette. Burdette defeated
Williams 6-2,7-5.
"We brought over eight kids, and
eight kids got to play." assistant
coach Frankie Brennan said. "It's
usually an exhibition feel. We were
able to go in and relax since it didn't
count on our official records."
As a whole, Brennan was satis
fied with the team's performance.
"1 think that they competed well
and that's the most important
thing," he said." 1 feel like what we
took away from the Hawaii trip is
that we're constantly remembering
how to compete... the tennis, the
weather and the conditions didn't
always make for the best tennis, but
the girls went out there and fought
for every point."
The women played alongside the
men's team, who faced their male
Hawaii counterparts in matches al
ternating with the women's. Al
though both Stanford teams had lit
tle trouble disposing of 1 lawaii in
their exhibition matches, the Hon
olulu weather was far from optimal.
"The conditions were not the
best," senior Theresa Logar said. "It
was really hot, and when it wasn't
hot, it was windy."
Despite the problems, Logar

found herself and her teammates
productive.
"I feel like I played an all-around
solid game, and the team was well
prepared for the match," she said.
'"Although we did as well as we ex
pected to, 1 think that we played re
ally well at every position and we
did a great job of getting ready for
the season."
Among those most benefiting
from the trip. Logar singled out
Burdette, who played her first
match with the team.
"It was very good for Lindsay to
get a feel for how matches go even
before the season starts," Logar
said.
Aside from the one-day match,
the team spent the week together,
going to the beach and having
Thanksgiving dinner. Brennan de
scribed the week as "team bonding"
for the approaching season.
"We really had a chance to bond
as a team off the court as well as on
the court," Logar said. "Before this
time, we hadn't spent much time
traveling as a team. ITiis was our
first week together spending almost
every minute together. It's kind of
nice to start that [team bonding] in a
very relaxed environment, as op
posed to the stress of the season."
The Cardinal will have a fairly
empty slate for the next month and
a half before the season-opening
Freeman Invitational in January.
The Pac-10 season begins in Feb
ruary with a match against South
ern California. Brennan described
the difficulty of defending the team
legacy (three-time NCAA champs)
within a competitive conference.
"It's going to be a real battle for
the Pac-10," Brennan said. "It may
be kind of tough to repeat this
year."
Logar says she is ready for the
strength of the Pac-10 and awaits
the challenge of the coming season.
"It's good that the Pac-10 is going
to very strong this year." she said.
"We'll be able to see some of the
best competition in the country."
