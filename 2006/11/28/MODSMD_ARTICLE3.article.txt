## Teach For America comes under fire 
### SAM BHAGWAT STAFF WRITER 
With a Jan. 7 application deadline
looming, professors at the School of
Education have begun taking aim at
Teach For America, arguing that its
poorly prepared teachers have little
or no impact on the communities
they serve, while program alumni ex
pressed mixed assessments of the
non-profit.

nation. In the morning, they team
teach summer school, and at night
students take classes in subjects like
classroom management, diversity
and theories of education. Come
September, students head off to rural
and inner-city school districts with
the goal of bringing underprivileged,

Education.
Education Prof. Rachel Lotan.di
rector of the Stanford Teacher Edu

graduate program, said that while
the students entering Teach for
America are bright, that's not
enough.
"It's not enough to know your dis
cipline," she said. "You need to be
able to teach it. to make it accessible
to students."
Criticism of STEP has also come
from Education Prof. Linda Darling
-1 lammond. who led a 2005 study
conducted by Stanford researchers
concluding, "certified teachers con
sistently produce significantly
stronger student achievement gains
than do uncertified teachers. These
