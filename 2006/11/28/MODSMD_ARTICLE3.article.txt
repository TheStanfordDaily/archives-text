## Teach For America comes under fire 
### SAM BHAGWAT STAFF WRITER 
With a Jan. 7 application deadline
looming, professors at the School of
Education have begun taking aim at
Teach For America, arguing that its
poorly prepared teachers have little
or no impact on the communities
they serve, while program alumni ex
pressed mixed assessments of the
non-profit.
Teach For America takes recent
college graduates and puts them
through "teacher boot camp" before
placing them in classrooms in impov
erished school districts around the
nation. In the morning, they team
teach summer school, and at night
students take classes in subjects like
classroom management, diversity
and theories of education. Come
September, students head off to rural
and inner-city school districts with
the goal of bringing underprivileged,
often minority, students up to speed

with their peers.
This approaeh has drawn the crit
icism of some across the nation, in
cluding many at Stanford's School of
Education.
Education Prof. Rachel Lotan.di
rector of the Stanford Teacher Edu
cation Program (STEP), a 12-month
graduate program, said that while
the students entering Teach for
America are bright, that's not
enough.
"It's not enough to know your dis
cipline," she said. "You need to be
able to teach it. to make it accessible
to students."
Criticism of STEP has also come
from Education Prof. Linda Darling
-1 lammond. who led a 2005 study
conducted by Stanford researchers
concluding, "certified teachers con
sistently produce significantly
stronger student achievement gains
than do uncertified teachers. These

litical debate and power sharing continue there.
findings hold for ITA recruits as well
as others. Teachers' effectiveness ap
pears strongly related to the prepara
tion they have received for teaching."
Darling-Hammond was abroad and
unavailable for comment for this arti
cle.
Teach for America vice president
for Research and Policy Abagail
Smith, in response to Mammon's
study 1. wrote a letter attacking the
study's methodology and lack of peer
review, pointing to a 2004 Mathemat
ical study that concluded that Teach
for America had a generally positive
impact on teaching effectiveness.
Many in the Education Depart
ment argue, with Darling-Hammond
and Lotan. that programs like STEP
are superior to Teach for America.
Like Teach For America, STEP
begins in June with training at a sum
mer school,but students say the Stan
ford program eases them into the
profession, making the summer
school session almost purely obser
vational.
" Ihe majority of people taught
only one lesson in total," said STEP
student Devin Ozdogu.
Ozdogu described the STEP pro
gram as built on the principle of scaf
folding, where teachers are gradually
given more responsibility over their
students. When STEP students enter
the classroom, they are placed as stu
dent-teachers under a "master
teacher" vetted by the program. At
the beginning of the school year, su
pervisory teachers do the teaching,
and only in the last six weeks of the
year does a student-teacher fully take
over the classroom.
"There arc 100 million people al
ways ready to give you support," said
STEP student Laura Young.
In Teach For America, on the
other hand, students are given re
sponsibility for the class from the first
day — and sometimes more than
that.
Second-year law student and
Teach for America alumnus Tim
I lurley walked into his principal's of
fice on the first day of elementary
school in the town of Marks, Miss.,
(pop. 1,500) and was told that he had
been made fourth-grade department
chair.
"I asked her, 'Are you sure you
want to do this? I'm fresh out of col
lege and you are making me depart
ment chair?"' Hurley said.
Later, he discovered why.
"In our first meeting, I asked all
the veteran teachers if anyone else
wanted to be department chair, and
they said. 'Nope, it's yours," Hurley
said. "They knew the job mainly just
involved a lot of tedious paperwork."
Teach For America members said
first six months were particularly dif
ficult.
"It hits you like a tidal wave," says
Chris Pope, a graduate student in ed
ucation and a former corps member.

Still, some alums argued that con
cerns about limited training are over
stated.
"If you're asking if 1 felt thrown in
the water and completely lost, I did
n't." said Jacqueline Hoang, a 2(X)5
Stanford graduate who taught in
Watts and south central Los Angeles.
"The first year of teaching is your
first year whether you're in a rich
suburb or south central Los Ange
les," said second-year Teach for
America corps member Bianca
Buckelew. Class of 2005. "It's hard
everywhere."
Professor Lotan disagreed.
"Teaching is a profession, and like
any other profession, it needs profes
sional preparation," she said. "You
need to know how to approach stu
dents, you need to understand ado
lescents,or understand little children,
as the case may be. You need to un
derstand how to manage a classroom,
how to orchestrate interactions in a
classroom. [Teach for America mem
bers] will learn the hard way — if
they stay."
And yet alums said the hardships
they suffered were all part of the ex
perience. Buckelew spoke of visiting
run-down inner-city schools with

classrooms infested with spiders and
cockroaches.
"II it weren't for Teach For Amer
ica." she said, "those classrooms
would be without any teachers."
Hurley said that the situation in
Mississippi was similar.
"If we hadn't been there," he said,
"they would have had to hire uncerti
fied substitute teachers, who would
stay with each class for four to five
weeks."
Hurley said that students with
Teach For America really had a
chance to make a difference with the
program. With the advice and help of
veteran teachers, he moved the
fourth grade from a system where
students moved between six teachers
each teaching only one subject to a
system where students had only two
teachers that taught three subjects
each.
"It was one small thing that I was
happy to change," Hurley said.
But STEP student Ozdogu ex
pressed skepticism over brand-new
teachers having so much responsibil
ity and argued that teaching intern
ships like Teach For America should
be run on the principle that "on Day
One you make coffee, and you only

gradually assume responsibility."
Lot an agreed.
"Very bright people go to Teach
For America because they don't want
to spend more money on education,
but it's not a responsible thing to do,"
she said.
And though Ozdogu believes that
the Teach for America's selection
process does enhance the quality for
teaching provided, he expressed one
significant concern.
"I'm worried about the not
brightest students looking at the ex
ample of Teach For America and
then coming into the classroom to
teach, thinking,'l don't need any ex
perience,"' he said.
Hurley sympathized with these
problems, but said that those at the
School of Education as well as ad
ministrators and corps members in
Teach For America appreciated what
was at stake.
"It's a very real thing — you have
a kid's life in your hands, and if you
screw it up then they lose a year of
education," he said. "This is real life.
Being an average teacher is difficult,
but it's like any other job. If you want
to be a great teacher, you have to
bring it."

students take classes in subjects like
classroom management, diversity
and theories of education. Come
September, students head off to rural

This approaeh has drawn the crit

Education.
Education Prof. Rachel Lotan.di
rector of the Stanford Teacher Edu
cation Program (STEP), a 12-month
graduate program, said that while
the students entering Teach for
America are bright, that's not
enough.
"It's not enough to know your dis
cipline," she said. "You need to be
able to teach it. to make it accessible
to students."
Criticism of STEP has also come
from Education Prof. Linda Darling

conducted by Stanford researchers
concluding, "certified teachers con

stronger student achievement gains
than do uncertified teachers. These

findings hold for ITA recruits as well
as others. Teachers' effectiveness ap
pears strongly related to the prepara

Darling-Hammond was abroad and
unavailable for comment for this arti
cle.
Teach for America vice president
for Research and Policy Abagail
Smith, in response to Mammon's
study 1. wrote a letter attacking the
study's methodology and lack of peer
review, pointing to a 2004 Mathemat
ical study that concluded that Teach
for America had a generally positive
impact on teaching effectiveness.
Many in the Education Depart
ment argue, with Darling-Hammond
and Lotan. that programs like STEP
are superior to Teach for America.
Like Teach For America, STEP
begins in June with training at a sum
mer school,but students say the Stan
ford program eases them into the
profession, making the summer
school session almost purely obser
vational.
" Ihe majority of people taught
only one lesson in total," said STEP
student Devin Ozdogu.
Ozdogu described the STEP pro
gram as built on the principle of scaf
folding, where teachers are gradually
given more responsibility over their
students. When STEP students enter
the classroom, they are placed as stu
dent-teachers under a "master
teacher" vetted by the program. At
the beginning of the school year, su
pervisory teachers do the teaching,
and only in the last six weeks of the
year does a student-teacher fully take
over the classroom.
"There arc 100 million people al
ways ready to give you support," said
STEP student Laura Young.
In Teach For America, on the
other hand, students are given re
sponsibility for the class from the first
day — and sometimes more than
that.
Second-year law student and
Teach for America alumnus Tim
I lurley walked into his principal's of
fice on the first day of elementary
school in the town of Marks, Miss.,
(pop. 1,500) and was told that he had
been made fourth-grade department
chair.
"I asked her, 'Are you sure you
want to do this? I'm fresh out of col
lege and you are making me depart
ment chair?"' Hurley said.
Later, he discovered why.
"In our first meeting, I asked all
the veteran teachers if anyone else
wanted to be department chair, and
they said. 'Nope, it's yours," Hurley
said. "They knew the job mainly just
involved a lot of tedious paperwork."
Teach For America members said
first six months were particularly dif
ficult.
"It hits you like a tidal wave," says
Chris Pope, a graduate student in ed
ucation and a former corps member.

Still, some alums argued that con
cerns about limited training are over
stated.
"If you're asking if 1 felt thrown in
the water and completely lost, I did
n't." said Jacqueline Hoang, a 2(X)5
Stanford graduate who taught in
Watts and south central Los Angeles.
"The first year of teaching is your
first year whether you're in a rich
suburb or south central Los Ange
les," said second-year Teach for
America corps member Bianca
Buckelew. Class of 2005. "It's hard
everywhere."
Professor Lotan disagreed.
"Teaching is a profession, and like
any other profession, it needs profes
sional preparation," she said. "You
need to know how to approach stu
dents, you need to understand ado
lescents,or understand little children,
as the case may be. You need to un
derstand how to manage a classroom,
how to orchestrate interactions in a
classroom. [Teach for America mem
bers] will learn the hard way — if
they stay."
And yet alums said the hardships
they suffered were all part of the ex
perience. Buckelew spoke of visiting
run-down inner-city schools with

classrooms infested with spiders and
cockroaches.
"II it weren't for Teach For Amer
ica." she said, "those classrooms
would be without any teachers."
Hurley said that the situation in
Mississippi was similar.
"If we hadn't been there," he said,
"they would have had to hire uncerti
fied substitute teachers, who would
stay with each class for four to five
weeks."
Hurley said that students with
Teach For America really had a
chance to make a difference with the
program. With the advice and help of
veteran teachers, he moved the
fourth grade from a system where
students moved between six teachers
each teaching only one subject to a
system where students had only two
teachers that taught three subjects
each.
"It was one small thing that I was
happy to change," Hurley said.
But STEP student Ozdogu ex
pressed skepticism over brand-new
teachers having so much responsibil
ity and argued that teaching intern
ships like Teach For America should
be run on the principle that "on Day
One you make coffee, and you only

gradually assume responsibility."
Lot an agreed.
"Very bright people go to Teach
For America because they don't want
to spend more money on education,
but it's not a responsible thing to do,"
she said.
And though Ozdogu believes that
the Teach for America's selection
process does enhance the quality for
teaching provided, he expressed one
significant concern.
"I'm worried about the not
brightest students looking at the ex
ample of Teach For America and
then coming into the classroom to
teach, thinking,'l don't need any ex
perience,"' he said.
Hurley sympathized with these
problems, but said that those at the
School of Education as well as ad
ministrators and corps members in
Teach For America appreciated what
was at stake.
"It's a very real thing — you have
a kid's life in your hands, and if you
screw it up then they lose a year of
education," he said. "This is real life.
Being an average teacher is difficult,
but it's like any other job. If you want
to be a great teacher, you have to
bring it."
With a Jan. 7 application deadline
looming, professors at the School of
Education have begun taking aim at
Teach For America, arguing that its
poorly prepared teachers have little
or no impact on the communities
they serve, while program alumni ex
pressed mixed assessments of the
non-profit.
Teach For America takes recent
college graduates and puts them
through "teacher boot camp" before
placing them in classrooms in impov
erished school districts around the
nation. In the morning, they team
teach summer school, and at night
students take classes in subjects like
