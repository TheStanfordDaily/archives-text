ance and a palpable charisma that
must also have exuded from Lucia

variety of experiences that embody
the passion 1 hope to highlight weekly
in this feature.
Olayinka graduated a year early
from high school and went to Thai
land to teach English with the Ameri-

can Field Service. There
she learned Thai and
Laos, worked as a
cheerleading coach
and dance instructor
and also traveled
across many of the re
mote regions of the
country. She came back
to the States and start-

attending Georgetown in
the fall. The day before she was sup
posed to leave, bags packed and tick
ets booked, she "knew it wasn't time
for me to go to college. So nope, not
going."This spotlights one of the most
notable things I came to see in Olayin
ka during our interview: she has an
amazing ability to listen to herself and
follow her intuition.
Instead of attending Georgetown,
Olayinka traveled to Cuenca,
Ecuador, to learn Spanish. In Cuenca

she worked at an orphanage, cho

taught at a local dunce school.
I She woke up early to kickbox,
putting to practice the black belt
she earned when she was 13. She

then moved to Oakland,

where Oakland High

School hired her to
ktutor juniors in vari

hired, she quickly became the lead
chemistry teacher for a core set of stu
dents, even though she had only just
graduated from high school two years
earlier. She also danced with Mind
Over Matter and Khaotic, two promi
nent Bay Area hip-hop dance groups.
Olayinka rounded out her busy
schedule with night classes at CSU-
Hayward, earning the credits that al

lowed her to transfer to Stanford as a
sophomore.
Her achievements did not cease
upon her arrival at the Farm. Olayin

When asked about how she jug

one particular area allows me to
have the peripheral vision to be able
to see all of these things that might
happen." ITiese words perfectly illus

as an equal, rather than letting it con

she referred to as the "bookmarks of

could feel that she continued to love

him and allow herself to feel sad
about his passing, which moved and
catalyzed me more than any other
part of the interview.
When 1 asked Olayinka about
how she found herself in having all
these experiences,she explained that
she likes to think she manifests
them. She doesn't consciously try to
reach a certain goal or achievement,
but everything she does has to be an
extension of who she is. She noted
that, "people say that the challenges
are the things that make you. It's not
true; it's the summation of the good
and the bad. The bad...you can just
remember them better."
At the end of the interview, 1
asked Olayinka if she had any advice
about finding and realizing one's
passion or any other subject. She of
fered a number of sage words 1
would never have expected to hear
from a 22-year-old. Most notably she
said to get off campus at least once a
week, work towards something but
remain able to live life at every mo
ment. and"know that in the end
you're okay, everyone's okay...it's
okay." Her voice quality changed as

of its earthly leashes and expressed a
