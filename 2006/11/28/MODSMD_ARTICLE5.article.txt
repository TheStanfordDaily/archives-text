# In Russia, media mystery thickens
## Journalist says political debate is still alive despite Putin's efforts 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
In the wake of the deaths of a fellow reporter and
a spy who spoke out against the current govern
ment. Russian journalist Evgeny Kiseliev argued
last night that despite President Vladimir Putin's
tightening control, political debate is still alive.
' Iliere is the perception that political life has
gone away in Russia, that everything is decided by
the president and the small circle that surrounds
him," said Kiseliev, the former general director of
what used to be one of the few remaining independ
ent television networks in Russia."But 1 think polit
ical struggle goes on even in ;i dictatorship."
Kiseliev said he doesn't consider Russia ;i totali
tarian state and sees people struggling for power de
spite Putin's authoritarian methods of ruling.
"Now the struggle just takes place behind the
Kremlin walls," he said.
With Putin's second term due to end in May

200 N. kiseliev compared the current Russian politi
cal situation to real estate, with the discussion re
volving not around location, but "succession, suc
cession, succession."
Hie Russian constitution prohibits a leader from
being president for more than two consecutive
terms. Putin has repeatedly said he will honor the
constitution, but speculation runs rampant that he
will run for a third term or otherwise attempt to re
main in power.
Kiseliev discussed several ways the president
could retain his power, though said he thinks Putin
might step down for good, because doing otherwise
would ruin his legitimacy in the eyes of both Rus
sians and foreigners.
One theory is that Putin will allow another pres
ident to step in for a period of several months, at
which point the president would resign, allowing
him to run for another term that would no longer be
consecutive to his previous terms. I fe
could also try to hold another posi
tion of power, such as the Chairman
of the Constitutional Court, or could
rely on his popular support and not
hold an official position, though
kiseliev dismissed (his option as too
risky for Putin to ever attempt.
Kiseliev predicted that Putin will
announce current I irst Deputy Prime
Minister Dmitri Medvedev as his
choice for his successor, with the an
nouncement likely coming in the
spring.
■■'Ihe next six months will he a bit
ter political struggle," Kiseliev said,
explaining that many other Russian
politicians harbor their own presiden
tial ambitions and that the Russian
elite has traditionally looked for a

weak candidate "who would be man
ageable and easily manipulated."
The media plays an especially im
portant role in this struggle for politi
cal power, as the majority of the tele
vision stations and newspapers are
controlled by the ruling party or busi
nesses that have close ties to the gov
ernment.
"Not a single TV station or news
paper. with a few exceptions, dares to
speak about what really goes on in the
Kremlin," said Kiseliev. who had a
news show comparable to "60 Min
utes" that was cancelled when the tel
evision network changed manage
ment a few years ago. I le has since
been attempting various incarnates of
the show, and appears to have struck
pay dirt with "Glossed Power," a new
show that will begin airing next
month.
At least two newspapers have re
mained independent and outspoken,
including the Novaya Gazeta, which
publishes twice a week, but the niur

der of journalist Anna Politkovskaya
demonstrates the danger of speaking
out against the government.
Politkovskaya wrote for the Novaya
C iazeta and was known for her coura
geous reporting about the war in
Chechnya. She accused the Russian
intelligence services of committing
crimes such as torture and abduction
in Chechnya and attempted to reveal
human rights violations that oc
curred. Politkovskaya was shot to
death in October, and her death is still
under investigation.
Aleksander Litvinenko, a former
member of the Russian Federal Secu
rity Service who also spoke out
against Putin's government, died
Thursday in an apparent radioactive
poisoning. Litvinenko had lied Russia
for Britain six years ago and accused
Putin of causing his death in a state
ment issued by the hospital.
Kiseliev said he did not know who
had killed either Politkovskaya or
I .itvinenko, but stressed that the situ

ations were different. He mentioned
that Litvinenko was no doubt mur
dered. but that the murder might be a
ploy to frame Putin.
Kiseliev said he thinks the most
important development in the cur
rent Russian media is the increasing
importance of online media. The In
ternet. he said, is growing as a forum
for Russian intellectuals to air their
discontent.
"Even if the political mood
changes in Russia, the conventional
media will not regain its former influ
ence," said Kiseliev.
Kiseliev foreshadowed a period of
political struggle for power and high
lighted the need for the media to try
to remain independent, especially
since Russian officials rarely admit
their involvement in scandals.
"I tell my Western friends not to
take the words of Russian politicians
for granted," Kiseliev said. "Russians
are true masters of their words: they
give them and they take them."
