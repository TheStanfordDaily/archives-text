## Editorial Board The
						Stanford arts scene 
### 
Stanford is renowned as a center of
higher learning and world-class re
search. but its drama, music and art de
partments have long remained small and
underfunded, and its arts scene has — until
recently — been divided up among distinct
student groups with no core community.
This is a shame because the arts are a vital
aspect of any community, university or oth
erwise. Fortunately, this past year has
proved to be a promising time for the arts at
Stanford. We hope that this recent trend of
supporting the arts will continue in future
years, establishing a vibrant and strong
Stanford art scene.
In the spring of 2005, President John
Hennessy strongly backed the Stanford
Arts Initiative to spearhead collaborations
between the arts and other disciplines, con
tending that the kind of creative and imagi
native reasoning taught within the arts is
precisely the kind of thinking that a 21st
century education should encourage. In ar
guing for the importance of the arts in a lib
eral education. Ilennessy spoke the words
of Stanford's first president, David Start-
Jordan. when he said, "The imagination
needs to be cultivated and developed to as
sure success in life. A man will never con
struct anything he cannot conceive." Fol
lowing up this declaration, Hennessy
helped launch The Stanford Institute for
Creativity and the Arts (SICA) at the be
ginning of 2006. with seed funding coming
directly from his office and from money
gifted by the School of I lumanities and Sci
ences.
Now up and running, SICA is pushing
forward the development of innovative arts
programs at both the graduate and under
graduate levels, encouraging cross-discipli
nary collaborative performance and exhibi
tion. allocating funding both to host artists
in-residence and to award student grants
and fellowships that will encourage inde-

pendent projects. Outside of the academic
sphere, SICA is also actively working to re
vitalize the campus arts scene with a broad
er selection of arts programming and subsi
dized funding for student attendance at off
campus art events. The work being done is
nothing short of a full scale renewal of the
arts as a centerpiece of university life.
Other triumphs for the arts community
have followed. Early this year The 750 Pub
jump started a Tuesday Comedy Night,
bringing in professional stand-up acts from
around the Bay Area to perform at the
graduate student hub: in October, the ever
generous I lelen and Peter Bing announced
that they would be donating $50 million to
the University toward the construction of a
new concert hall; and just this past spring,
the ASS I honored the Student Organizing
Committee for the Arts (SOCA) with the
prestigious distinction of student group of
the year. With over 100 art groups on cam
pus working alongside its member core,
SOCA is best known for its yearly extrava
ganza. "An Art Affair." which promotes
artistic expression by featuring perform
ances and exhibitions of student work.
SOCA has also been a driving force behind
student arts grants in conjunction with the
ASSU. and has collaborated with the Stan
lord Concert Network (SCN) to organize a
free concert series hosted by the Col lo and
The 750 Pub on alternate Thursdays.
The work being done by SOCA and the
forces behind the arts initiative shoyld be
applauded. If the initiative is carried out in
the spirit in which it was conceived, and if
the many students and faculty involved with
the arts rally behind it.it may yield a more
vibrant, cohesive and inclusive arts scene,
substantially strengthen the core arts edu
cation the University offers and integrate
the arts within a multidisciplinary context
into the larger framework of a Stanford ed
ucation.
