There is a dream of Stanford that we
students all share. It has nothing to
do with Stanford University, an edu
cational institution that ranks exceptional
ly high in every conceivable college rank
ing and has an endowment the size of 12
Africas. No, I'm talking about "Stanford."
the state of mind we all live in for four long,
formative, happy, tragic years — the place
where you meet the best and worst friends
of your life, where you fall in and out of
love, where you explore every curricular
and extracurricular possibility. It is a place
built on two seemingly opposing ideas: ac
ademic excellence and a laid-back, no
stress, chill-out-bro atmosphere. That sec
ond part is supposedly what sets us apart
from the chain-smoking type-A WASPs in
the Ivy League. It's the reason why those of
us who aren't eccentric pretend to be. why
you can shop a class for three weeks and
withdraw just before finals, why you don't
have to declare a major until you're
halfway through junior year. Vaguely, it is
the "crazy part of our school, and under its
umbrella you find fountain hopping, the
6th Man club. Band Run, Full Moon on the
Quad and all the other traditions that force
you to throw aside your type-A personali
ty and the moral boundaries of modern so
ciety.
Things like that —those old traditions
- are disappearing. Just look at what hap
pened to the Yell Leaders.
The Yell Leaders were, for most of the
20th century, the ultra rabid fans who stood
in front of the crowd and fanned the flames
ot school spirit, leading cheers and waving
the big Stanford Flag. Being a Yell Leader
was no joke. Hie contest to become Yell
( aptain was fierce, similar to the insanity
that now surrounds Tree Week. Students
voted on Yell Leaders. ITiey were a tradi
tion.
By the time 1 arrived at Stanford, in au
tumn of 2003, our once-great Football team
was in the early stages of its long, tragic spi
ral: our administration's approval of eccen
tricity was on the wane;and the demograph
ics of the student body had radically shifted.
When only the upper 10 percent of applica
tions are accepted, you tend to get the kids
who avoided sporting events in high school,
who have little experience with beer, who
don't exactly know what school spirit is.
People like me,and maybe like you.
By the end of football season sophomore
year, it had become a popular student past
time to utterly despise the Yell Leaders. Be
cause, let it be said, they were awful in every
measurable way. They cheered off-rhythm

and could never keep up with the students;
they appeared to understand very little
about football: really, all they did was stand
on the track wearing goofv-looking red
jumpsuits and dance around poorly.
Katie Fogelsong was the Yell Captain in
'04- 05. "We were ridiculed and insulted, es
pecially when the team lost. We were the
whipping boys. It's a typical Stanford thing
not to associate or cheer for something
that's not doing well." Katie says, and she's
right. 1 can remember feeling a visceral dis
taste at the idea of cheering, and many of my
friends would spend the second half insur
ing the Yell Leaders. It was an endurance
test: I low long can you stay before your
heart just gives out? How many fumbles?
How many third-down punts?
But the Yell Leaders never had to ask
themselves that question. "We love the
Band, Katie says, "love the crowds or lack
thereof, and we wake up at the ass crack of
dawn tor two years — sacrificing our Fri
days— to put our personal decency on the
line." Fhe Yell Leaders were the last of the
Irue Believers. It seems almost silly, but part
of the Yell Leaders' charm was their abject,
naive adoration for this school. Ibis was
supposed to be their dream come true.
ITiey didn't count on the bureaucrats.
I"he Athletic Department wanted them to
look more professional, more organized, to
"contribute more" to the athletic event. In
the spring of 2005, the Department ex
plained that they would not be allowed into
games il they did not follow the Depart
ment's directives.
ITiey were told to be "consistent in ap
pearance," so if one person rolled up a pant
leg. everyone else had to do it. too. The De
partment demanded a list of cheers and the
exact times they would do each cheer. This
was difficult, since sporting events are by
nature rather unplanned and you never
know when you'll get to cheer or what you'll
be cheering about. It also went directly
against the Old Way of Yell Leading. It was
an attempt at organization. It reeks of fas
cism.
