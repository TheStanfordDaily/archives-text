There is a dream of Stanford that we
students all share. It has nothing to
do with Stanford University, an edu
cational institution that ranks exceptional
ly high in every conceivable college rank
ing and has an endowment the size of 12
Africas. No, I'm talking about "Stanford."
the state of mind we all live in for four long,
formative, happy, tragic years — the place
where you meet the best and worst friends
of your life, where you fall in and out of
love, where you explore every curricular
and extracurricular possibility. It is a place
built on two seemingly opposing ideas: ac
ademic excellence and a laid-back, no
stress, chill-out-bro atmosphere. That sec
ond part is supposedly what sets us apart
from the chain-smoking type-A WASPs in
the Ivy League. It's the reason why those of
us who aren't eccentric pretend to be. why
you can shop a class for three weeks and
withdraw just before finals, why you don't
have to declare a major until you're
halfway through junior year. Vaguely, it is
the "crazy part of our school, and under its
umbrella you find fountain hopping, the
6th Man club. Band Run, Full Moon on the
Quad and all the other traditions that force
you to throw aside your type-A personali
ty and the moral boundaries of modern so
ciety.
Things like that —those old traditions
- are disappearing. Just look at what hap
pened to the Yell Leaders.
The Yell Leaders were, for most of the
20th century, the ultra rabid fans who stood
in front of the crowd and fanned the flames
ot school spirit, leading cheers and waving
the big Stanford Flag. Being a Yell Leader
was no joke. Hie contest to become Yell
( aptain was fierce, similar to the insanity
that now surrounds Tree Week. Students
voted on Yell Leaders. ITiey were a tradi
tion.
By the time 1 arrived at Stanford, in au
tumn of 2003, our once-great Football team
was in the early stages of its long, tragic spi
ral: our administration's approval of eccen
tricity was on the wane;and the demograph
ics of the student body had radically shifted.
When only the upper 10 percent of applica
tions are accepted, you tend to get the kids
who avoided sporting events in high school,
who have little experience with beer, who
don't exactly know what school spirit is.
People like me,and maybe like you.
By the end of football season sophomore
year, it had become a popular student past
time to utterly despise the Yell Leaders. Be
cause, let it be said, they were awful in every
measurable way. They cheered off-rhythm

and could never keep up with the students;
they appeared to understand very little
about football: really, all they did was stand
on the track wearing goofv-looking red
jumpsuits and dance around poorly.
Katie Fogelsong was the Yell Captain in
'04- 05. "We were ridiculed and insulted, es
pecially when the team lost. We were the
whipping boys. It's a typical Stanford thing
not to associate or cheer for something
that's not doing well." Katie says, and she's
right. 1 can remember feeling a visceral dis
taste at the idea of cheering, and many of my
friends would spend the second half insur
ing the Yell Leaders. It was an endurance
test: I low long can you stay before your
heart just gives out? How many fumbles?
How many third-down punts?
But the Yell Leaders never had to ask
themselves that question. "We love the
Band, Katie says, "love the crowds or lack
thereof, and we wake up at the ass crack of
dawn tor two years — sacrificing our Fri
days— to put our personal decency on the
line." Fhe Yell Leaders were the last of the
Irue Believers. It seems almost silly, but part
of the Yell Leaders' charm was their abject,
naive adoration for this school. Ibis was
supposed to be their dream come true.
ITiey didn't count on the bureaucrats.
I"he Athletic Department wanted them to
look more professional, more organized, to
"contribute more" to the athletic event. In
the spring of 2005, the Department ex
plained that they would not be allowed into
games il they did not follow the Depart
ment's directives.
ITiey were told to be "consistent in ap
pearance," so if one person rolled up a pant
leg. everyone else had to do it. too. The De
partment demanded a list of cheers and the
exact times they would do each cheer. This
was difficult, since sporting events are by
nature rather unplanned and you never
know when you'll get to cheer or what you'll
be cheering about. It also went directly
against the Old Way of Yell Leading. It was
an attempt at organization. It reeks of fas
cism.

Why this change in policy to
wards the Yell Leaders? Katie ex
plains, "They wanted to turn the
games into an entertainment event."
Translation: advertising. That's why
every instant replay is sponsored by
Yahoo, why the new Maples and the
new Football Stadium both model
shiny, futuristic video screens. The
Athletic Department wanted the
Yell Leaders to become another cog
in the sport-entertainment complex.
That so much effort was put into the
presentation of the games, and not
into the team itself, represents the
Great Unifying Theory of the Hen
nessy Administration: The New
Paint Job. If something is falling
apart, then give it a shiny new coat of
paint! Don't get me wrong, 1 love our
majestic new stadium, and I'm
thankful to everyone who gave
money to it, but what the hell is a
beautiful castle built on quicksand?
Surely there were better ways to
spend $ l >() million. Our Film Studies
department could use a new movie
theater, nudge nudge, wink wink.
When the few Yell Leaders who
didn't quit returned this autumn, the
law was laid down by the Athletic
Department in no uncertain terms.
Perhaps you recall seeing a few lone
students standing awkwardly at the
front of the student section, wearing
ugly maroon collared shirts and ugly
khakis. Gone are the jumpsuits, the
microphone system, the unre
hearsed eccentricity. The Yell Lead
ers were told, "You have to wear
this, and stand here, or else you
won't exist." (1 can feel the cruel
faceless fingers of the administra
tion already typing a response to
this, explaining how they never said
anything like that.Try to imagine the
words that they actually used. If it
helps, picture Big Brother.) And, in
possibly the most dunderheaded

misstep in the whole sordid tale,
they also had to create a new flag,
colored, of all things, white. "It's like
surrendering."
Who comes up with this stuff? At
least part of the blame rests on the
administrators who set out to "fix"
the Yell Leaders, among them the
current and past Athletic Directors
and assorted minor peons. Although
they certainly do care about Stan
ford, as Katie notes, "none of them
went to Stanford," and so at a certain
point whatever school spirit they
might have is replaced by the fact
that this is, after all. a job.
And let's not kid ourselves —
working at Stanford is a hell of a job.
The pay is great, the location is fan
tastic. We students, at our core, want
to experience college. Administra
tors, at their core, want to make
money. This is a fact of life. It does
not make them evil, but it does
make them unlikable, and it often
leaves our two camps in diametric
opposition. It is foolish to deny this.
1 cannot imagine any student or
alumni trampling across the Tradi
tions of our school, demanding con
formity, the way some of these ad
ministrators have. Full Moon has
become an overblown concert;
Band Run was an advertisement for
the new stadium; dorm reunions are
endangered; the Bonfire is a distant
memory; and the lone "new tradi
tion" in recent years, Absolute Fun,
bravely continues to utterly live
down to its name.
It would be a huge fallacy to con
demn everyone in the administra
tion. Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims is a
constant source of school spirit, and
was the lone voice of reason in sup
port of the Yell Leaders. With Dean
Julie, the Yell Leaders received sup
portive, instant feedback. You could
see her out there at all the football
games, daring to look ridiculous by
tramping up and down the stairs and
encouraging students to stay, to
cheer for our team. As one of the
Gaieties writers who killed her off
last vear. I can only say that the de

gree to which Dean Julie is willing to
put herself out there is inspiring. But
she is an alumnus. She understands.
Everyone else who worked with the
Veil Leaders "didn't want to work
with us. they hated us,they would cri
tique us after each event,"says Katie.
The Yell Leaders believed in Stan
ford. The Athletic Department may
have been well-intended. Iliat does
not make their actions any less stu
pid or cruel.
But what happened to the Yell
Leaders is not the administration's
fault. It's our fault. At a certain point
last fall. I stopped wanting to go to
football games because I did not
want to see us lose: I tailgated for
three hours, if 1 went to the Stadium
at all. When I did that, I let down our
football team, 1 let down our school,
I let down everyone with the guts to
still believe that Stanford is more
than a bomb to be dropped in job in
terviews. It shouldn't matter if our
football team is awful; it does matter
if our fans are awful.
Now. the Yell Leaders stand out
there.straitjacketed into place, wear
ing shirts that aren't even our school
colors, unless we've lately become
the Stanford Maroon. (Way to go.
Athletic Department shirt designers,
you ignorant sods!) They are still the
most spirited kids at the game —
they still believe in the Dream of
Stanford — but they have been
mugged by reality, by the iron hand
of advertisement-minded corpo
ratism and, most of all, by an uncar
ing student body who barely notice if
there are Yell Leaders or not. The
moment that we let our Traditions
fall away — even silly traditions like
the Yell Leaders — is the moment
that we announce our solidarity with
the Babyproofing of Stanford.
Several of the Yell Leaders have a
tree tattooed on their back. Don't
you wish you could love something
that much?

Athletic Department shirt designers,

they still believe in the Dream of
Stanford — but they have been

of advertisement-minded corpo

there are Yell Leaders or not. The
moment that we let our Traditions
fall away — even silly traditions like
the Yell Leaders — is the moment
that we announce our solidarity with
the Babyproofing of Stanford.

the state of mind we all live in for four long,
formative, happy, tragic years — the place
where you meet the best and worst friends
of your life, where you fall in and out of
love, where you explore every curricular
and extracurricular possibility. It is a place
built on two seemingly opposing ideas: ac
ademic excellence and a laid-back, no
stress, chill-out-bro atmosphere. That sec
ond part is supposedly what sets us apart
from the chain-smoking type-A WASPs in
the Ivy League. It's the reason why those of
us who aren't eccentric pretend to be. why
you can shop a class for three weeks and
withdraw just before finals, why you don't
have to declare a major until you're

the "crazy part of our school, and under its
umbrella you find fountain hopping, the
6th Man club. Band Run, Full Moon on the
Quad and all the other traditions that force
you to throw aside your type-A personali
ty and the moral boundaries of modern so
ciety.
Things like that —those old traditions
- are disappearing. Just look at what hap
pened to the Yell Leaders.
The Yell Leaders were, for most of the
20th century, the ultra rabid fans who stood
in front of the crowd and fanned the flames
ot school spirit, leading cheers and waving
the big Stanford Flag. Being a Yell Leader
was no joke. Hie contest to become Yell
( aptain was fierce, similar to the insanity
that now surrounds Tree Week. Students
voted on Yell Leaders. ITiey were a tradi
tion.
By the time 1 arrived at Stanford, in au
tumn of 2003, our once-great Football team
was in the early stages of its long, tragic spi
ral: our administration's approval of eccen
tricity was on the wane;and the demograph
ics of the student body had radically shifted.
When only the upper 10 percent of applica
tions are accepted, you tend to get the kids
who avoided sporting events in high school,
who have little experience with beer, who
don't exactly know what school spirit is.
People like me,and maybe like you.
By the end of football season sophomore
year, it had become a popular student past
time to utterly despise the Yell Leaders. Be
cause, let it be said, they were awful in every
measurable way. They cheered off-rhythm

and could never keep up with the students;
they appeared to understand very little
about football: really, all they did was stand
on the track wearing goofv-looking red
jumpsuits and dance around poorly.
Katie Fogelsong was the Yell Captain in
'04- 05. "We were ridiculed and insulted, es
pecially when the team lost. We were the
whipping boys. It's a typical Stanford thing
not to associate or cheer for something
that's not doing well." Katie says, and she's
right. 1 can remember feeling a visceral dis
taste at the idea of cheering, and many of my
friends would spend the second half insur
ing the Yell Leaders. It was an endurance
test: I low long can you stay before your
heart just gives out? How many fumbles?
How many third-down punts?
But the Yell Leaders never had to ask
themselves that question. "We love the
Band, Katie says, "love the crowds or lack
thereof, and we wake up at the ass crack of
dawn tor two years — sacrificing our Fri
days— to put our personal decency on the
line." Fhe Yell Leaders were the last of the
Irue Believers. It seems almost silly, but part
of the Yell Leaders' charm was their abject,
naive adoration for this school. Ibis was
supposed to be their dream come true.
ITiey didn't count on the bureaucrats.
I"he Athletic Department wanted them to
look more professional, more organized, to
"contribute more" to the athletic event. In
the spring of 2005, the Department ex
plained that they would not be allowed into
games il they did not follow the Depart
ment's directives.
ITiey were told to be "consistent in ap
pearance," so if one person rolled up a pant
leg. everyone else had to do it. too. The De
partment demanded a list of cheers and the
exact times they would do each cheer. This
was difficult, since sporting events are by
nature rather unplanned and you never
know when you'll get to cheer or what you'll
be cheering about. It also went directly
against the Old Way of Yell Leading. It was
an attempt at organization. It reeks of fas
cism.

Why this change in policy to
wards the Yell Leaders? Katie ex
plains, "They wanted to turn the
games into an entertainment event."
Translation: advertising. That's why
every instant replay is sponsored by
Yahoo, why the new Maples and the
new Football Stadium both model
shiny, futuristic video screens. The
Athletic Department wanted the
Yell Leaders to become another cog
in the sport-entertainment complex.
That so much effort was put into the
presentation of the games, and not
into the team itself, represents the
Great Unifying Theory of the Hen
nessy Administration: The New
Paint Job. If something is falling
apart, then give it a shiny new coat of
paint! Don't get me wrong, 1 love our
majestic new stadium, and I'm
thankful to everyone who gave
money to it, but what the hell is a
beautiful castle built on quicksand?
Surely there were better ways to
spend $ l >() million. Our Film Studies
department could use a new movie
theater, nudge nudge, wink wink.
When the few Yell Leaders who
didn't quit returned this autumn, the
law was laid down by the Athletic
Department in no uncertain terms.
Perhaps you recall seeing a few lone
students standing awkwardly at the
front of the student section, wearing
ugly maroon collared shirts and ugly
khakis. Gone are the jumpsuits, the
microphone system, the unre
hearsed eccentricity. The Yell Lead
ers were told, "You have to wear
this, and stand here, or else you
won't exist." (1 can feel the cruel
faceless fingers of the administra
tion already typing a response to
this, explaining how they never said
anything like that.Try to imagine the
words that they actually used. If it
helps, picture Big Brother.) And, in
possibly the most dunderheaded

misstep in the whole sordid tale,
they also had to create a new flag,
colored, of all things, white. "It's like
surrendering."
Who comes up with this stuff? At
least part of the blame rests on the
administrators who set out to "fix"
the Yell Leaders, among them the
current and past Athletic Directors
and assorted minor peons. Although
they certainly do care about Stan
ford, as Katie notes, "none of them
went to Stanford," and so at a certain
point whatever school spirit they
might have is replaced by the fact
that this is, after all. a job.
And let's not kid ourselves —
working at Stanford is a hell of a job.
The pay is great, the location is fan
tastic. We students, at our core, want
to experience college. Administra
tors, at their core, want to make
money. This is a fact of life. It does
not make them evil, but it does
make them unlikable, and it often
leaves our two camps in diametric
opposition. It is foolish to deny this.
1 cannot imagine any student or
alumni trampling across the Tradi
tions of our school, demanding con
formity, the way some of these ad
ministrators have. Full Moon has
become an overblown concert;
Band Run was an advertisement for
the new stadium; dorm reunions are
endangered; the Bonfire is a distant
memory; and the lone "new tradi
tion" in recent years, Absolute Fun,
bravely continues to utterly live
down to its name.
It would be a huge fallacy to con
demn everyone in the administra
tion. Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims is a
constant source of school spirit, and
was the lone voice of reason in sup
port of the Yell Leaders. With Dean
Julie, the Yell Leaders received sup
portive, instant feedback. You could
see her out there at all the football
games, daring to look ridiculous by
tramping up and down the stairs and
encouraging students to stay, to
cheer for our team. As one of the
Gaieties writers who killed her off
last vear. I can only say that the de

gree to which Dean Julie is willing to
put herself out there is inspiring. But
she is an alumnus. She understands.
Everyone else who worked with the
Veil Leaders "didn't want to work
with us. they hated us,they would cri
tique us after each event,"says Katie.
The Yell Leaders believed in Stan
ford. The Athletic Department may
have been well-intended. Iliat does
not make their actions any less stu
pid or cruel.
But what happened to the Yell
Leaders is not the administration's
fault. It's our fault. At a certain point
last fall. I stopped wanting to go to
football games because I did not
want to see us lose: I tailgated for
three hours, if 1 went to the Stadium
at all. When I did that, I let down our
football team, 1 let down our school,
I let down everyone with the guts to
still believe that Stanford is more
than a bomb to be dropped in job in
terviews. It shouldn't matter if our
football team is awful; it does matter
if our fans are awful.
Now. the Yell Leaders stand out

Athletic Department shirt designers,
you ignorant sods!) They are still the

they still believe in the Dream of
Stanford — but they have been
mugged by reality, by the iron hand
of advertisement-minded corpo

there are Yell Leaders or not. The
moment that we let our Traditions
fall away — even silly traditions like

that we announce our solidarity with
the Babyproofing of Stanford.

There is a dream of Stanford that we
students all share. It has nothing to
do with Stanford University, an edu
cational institution that ranks exceptional
ly high in every conceivable college rank
ing and has an endowment the size of 12
Africas. No, I'm talking about "Stanford."
the state of mind we all live in for four long,
formative, happy, tragic years — the place
where you meet the best and worst friends
of your life, where you fall in and out of
love, where you explore every curricular
and extracurricular possibility. It is a place
built on two seemingly opposing ideas: ac
ademic excellence and a laid-back, no
stress, chill-out-bro atmosphere. That sec
ond part is supposedly what sets us apart
from the chain-smoking type-A WASPs in
the Ivy League. It's the reason why those of
us who aren't eccentric pretend to be. why
you can shop a class for three weeks and
withdraw just before finals, why you don't
have to declare a major until you're
halfway through junior year. Vaguely, it is
the "crazy part of our school, and under its
umbrella you find fountain hopping, the
6th Man club. Band Run, Full Moon on the
Quad and all the other traditions that force
you to throw aside your type-A personali
ty and the moral boundaries of modern so
ciety.
Things like that —those old traditions
- are disappearing. Just look at what hap
pened to the Yell Leaders.
The Yell Leaders were, for most of the
20th century, the ultra rabid fans who stood
in front of the crowd and fanned the flames
ot school spirit, leading cheers and waving
the big Stanford Flag. Being a Yell Leader
was no joke. Hie contest to become Yell
( aptain was fierce, similar to the insanity
that now surrounds Tree Week. Students
voted on Yell Leaders. ITiey were a tradi
tion.
By the time 1 arrived at Stanford, in au
tumn of 2003, our once-great Football team
was in the early stages of its long, tragic spi
ral: our administration's approval of eccen
tricity was on the wane;and the demograph
ics of the student body had radically shifted.
When only the upper 10 percent of applica
tions are accepted, you tend to get the kids
who avoided sporting events in high school,
who have little experience with beer, who
don't exactly know what school spirit is.
People like me,and maybe like you.
By the end of football season sophomore
year, it had become a popular student past
time to utterly despise the Yell Leaders. Be
cause, let it be said, they were awful in every
measurable way. They cheered off-rhythm

and could never keep up with the students;
they appeared to understand very little
about football: really, all they did was stand
on the track wearing goofv-looking red
jumpsuits and dance around poorly.
Katie Fogelsong was the Yell Captain in
'04- 05. "We were ridiculed and insulted, es
pecially when the team lost. We were the
whipping boys. It's a typical Stanford thing
not to associate or cheer for something
that's not doing well." Katie says, and she's
right. 1 can remember feeling a visceral dis
taste at the idea of cheering, and many of my
friends would spend the second half insur
ing the Yell Leaders. It was an endurance
test: I low long can you stay before your
heart just gives out? How many fumbles?
How many third-down punts?
But the Yell Leaders never had to ask
themselves that question. "We love the
Band, Katie says, "love the crowds or lack
thereof, and we wake up at the ass crack of
dawn tor two years — sacrificing our Fri
days— to put our personal decency on the
line." Fhe Yell Leaders were the last of the
Irue Believers. It seems almost silly, but part
of the Yell Leaders' charm was their abject,
naive adoration for this school. Ibis was
supposed to be their dream come true.
ITiey didn't count on the bureaucrats.
I"he Athletic Department wanted them to
look more professional, more organized, to
"contribute more" to the athletic event. In
the spring of 2005, the Department ex
plained that they would not be allowed into
games il they did not follow the Depart
ment's directives.
ITiey were told to be "consistent in ap
pearance," so if one person rolled up a pant
leg. everyone else had to do it. too. The De
partment demanded a list of cheers and the
exact times they would do each cheer. This
was difficult, since sporting events are by
nature rather unplanned and you never
know when you'll get to cheer or what you'll
be cheering about. It also went directly
against the Old Way of Yell Leading. It was
an attempt at organization. It reeks of fas
cism.

Ire and Vice
Why this change in policy to
wards the Yell Leaders? Katie ex
plains, "They wanted to turn the
games into an entertainment event."
Translation: advertising. That's why
every instant replay is sponsored by
Yahoo, why the new Maples and the
new Football Stadium both model
shiny, futuristic video screens. The
Athletic Department wanted the
Yell Leaders to become another cog
in the sport-entertainment complex.
That so much effort was put into the
presentation of the games, and not
into the team itself, represents the
Great Unifying Theory of the Hen
nessy Administration: The New
Paint Job. If something is falling
apart, then give it a shiny new coat of
paint! Don't get me wrong, 1 love our
majestic new stadium, and I'm
thankful to everyone who gave
money to it, but what the hell is a
beautiful castle built on quicksand?
Surely there were better ways to
spend $ l >() million. Our Film Studies
department could use a new movie
theater, nudge nudge, wink wink.
When the few Yell Leaders who
didn't quit returned this autumn, the
law was laid down by the Athletic
Department in no uncertain terms.
Perhaps you recall seeing a few lone
students standing awkwardly at the
front of the student section, wearing
ugly maroon collared shirts and ugly
khakis. Gone are the jumpsuits, the
microphone system, the unre
hearsed eccentricity. The Yell Lead
ers were told, "You have to wear
this, and stand here, or else you
won't exist." (1 can feel the cruel
faceless fingers of the administra
tion already typing a response to
this, explaining how they never said
anything like that.Try to imagine the
words that they actually used. If it
helps, picture Big Brother.) And, in
possibly the most dunderheaded

misstep in the whole sordid tale,
they also had to create a new flag,
colored, of all things, white. "It's like
surrendering."
Who comes up with this stuff? At
least part of the blame rests on the
administrators who set out to "fix"
the Yell Leaders, among them the
current and past Athletic Directors
and assorted minor peons. Although
they certainly do care about Stan
ford, as Katie notes, "none of them
went to Stanford," and so at a certain
point whatever school spirit they
might have is replaced by the fact
that this is, after all. a job.
And let's not kid ourselves —
working at Stanford is a hell of a job.
The pay is great, the location is fan
tastic. We students, at our core, want
to experience college. Administra
tors, at their core, want to make
money. This is a fact of life. It does
not make them evil, but it does
make them unlikable, and it often
leaves our two camps in diametric
opposition. It is foolish to deny this.
1 cannot imagine any student or
alumni trampling across the Tradi
tions of our school, demanding con
formity, the way some of these ad
ministrators have. Full Moon has
become an overblown concert;
Band Run was an advertisement for
the new stadium; dorm reunions are
endangered; the Bonfire is a distant
memory; and the lone "new tradi
tion" in recent years, Absolute Fun,
bravely continues to utterly live
down to its name.
It would be a huge fallacy to con
demn everyone in the administra
tion. Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims is a
constant source of school spirit, and
was the lone voice of reason in sup
port of the Yell Leaders. With Dean
Julie, the Yell Leaders received sup
portive, instant feedback. You could
see her out there at all the football
games, daring to look ridiculous by
tramping up and down the stairs and
encouraging students to stay, to
cheer for our team. As one of the
Gaieties writers who killed her off
last vear. I can only say that the de

gree to which Dean Julie is willing to
put herself out there is inspiring. But
she is an alumnus. She understands.

Veil Leaders "didn't want to work
with us. they hated us,they would cri
tique us after each event,"says Katie.
