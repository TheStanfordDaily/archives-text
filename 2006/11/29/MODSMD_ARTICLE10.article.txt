HAVANA (AP) â€” The ailing Fidel Castro
was not well enough to attend the kickoff
Tuesday of his 80th birthday celebrations,
attended by hundreds of admirers who
traveled here to fete him. A government
worker at the gala launch of the five-day
birthday bash read a message which he said
came from the Cuban leader. It said Cas
tro's doctors had told him he was not in
condition to go to the party at Havana's
Karl Marx Theater.
