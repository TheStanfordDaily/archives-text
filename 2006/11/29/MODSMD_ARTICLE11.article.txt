## Bloomberg meets with family of groom slain in police shooting 
### TOM HAYS ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NLW YORK — Mayor Michael
Bloomberg met Tuesday with the
family of the man who was killed on
his wedding day in a barrage of po
lice gunfire as he left his bachelor
party, and investigators questioned a
third civilian witness.
Three days after the fatal en
counter, it remained unclear why
four detectives and one police officer
opened lire while conducting an un
dercover operation at a strip club.
ITie unidentified witness was on a
darkened block in Queens when five
police officers killed 23-year-old
Sean Bell and injured two friends as
the three sat inside a car, officials
said.
There are two other civilian wit
nesses: One woman on the street
who says she saw officers firing
their weapons, and a second woman
who from her window spotted a
man running away from the area
around the time of the shooting. In
vestigators tried to determine if
that man had been with the three
who were shot.
On TUesday, Bloomberg went to
the Hell family's Queens church,
where he met for about an hour with
the parents and fiance of the victim,
along with the Rev. Al Sharpton.The
mayor then met at a restaurant with
about 50 community leaders.
The mayor held a similar meeting
Monday at City 1 (all in which he de
clared that officers appeared to use

"excessive force" when Bell was
killed hours before his wedding. He
stood by his comments Tuesday.
"I am a civilian. I am not a profes
sional law enforcement officer"he
said. "I used the word excessive and
that's fine. That was my personal
opinion. It may turn out to be that it
was not excessive."
Some have questioned whether
the shooting was racially motivated
because the victims were all black
men.The five officers who fired their
guns included two blacks, two whites
and one Hispanic.
Councilman James Sanders Jr. of
Queens said he warned Bloomberg
about possible unrest.
"I alerted the mayor that the tem
perature on the streets has increased
to a large degree " he said. "While we
are sitting in these meetings, a lot of

people are out on the streets."
Police Commissioner Raymond
Kelly said some tension was in
evitable because of "the nature of
what police departments do — we
arrest people, we give them sum
monses, we're the bearers of bad
news, we use force and sometimes we
use deadly force."
Police investigators have not in
terviewed the officers because of a
district attorney probe that could re
sult in criminal charges, nor have the
officers spoken publicly. An attorney
for the detectives' union. Philip
Karasyk, has called the incident "a
tragedy, but not a crime."
Union officials familiar with the
officers' account say at least one un
dercover detective was convinced
there was a gun in the car. They also
allege that Bell defied orders to stop

and used the vehicle as a weapon,
bumping the undercover detective
and ramming an unmarked police
van.
"They are genuinely concerned
and very sympathetic toward the
three men who were shot," said
Michael Palladino, president of the
Detectives' Endowment Associa
tion. "However, they are anxious to
speak to the district attorney in
Queens and tell their side of the
story."'
The gunfire early Saturday
stemmed from an undercover opera
tion inside the Kalua Cabaret, where
seven officers in plain clothes were
investigating alleged prostitution
and drug use.
Kelly has said Bell was involved in an
argument outside the club after 4
a.m., and one of his friends made a

In an argument
outside the Kalua
Cabaret, an
undercover officer
hears someone -
later identified by
police as a member
of Bell's group - say,
"Yo, get my gun."
The argument fades
and the men split
into two groups.
The undercover
officer follows Bell's
group to a car on
the next block. The
officer's back-up - a
lieutenant and two
officers in an
unmarked Toyota
Camary and two other
police officers in a
minivan - also follow.

Both officers get out of
the minivan and fire a
total of 34 rounds - with

times. Two officers from
the Camary shoot a total
of five times. Gunfire also
hits a nearby home and
train.

officer walked closely behind Bell
and his friends as they headed for
their car. As he walked toward the
front of the vehicle, they drove for

The officer who had followed the
group on foot was apparently the
first to open fire. Kelly said. One 12-
year veteran fired his weapon 31
times, emptying two full magazines,
Kelly said.
Eugene O'Donnell.a professor of
police studies at John Jay College of

the officers would face criminal
charges. But. he added, the shooting

was certain to prompt an overhaul of
police tactics.
"I'd be shocked if they ever con

said.
ITie five officers were placed on
paid administrative leave and
stripped of their guns during the in

The survivors were Joseph Guz
