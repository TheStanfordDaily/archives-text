## Editorial Board Break the weekend cycle 
### 
What do you do on a typical Stanford
weekend? If you are an under
grad, the following timeline might
sound familiar: Get dinner with friends on
Friday, hang out, pre-party, go to a party, go
to bed. Sleep in late on Saturday, get
brunch, watch TV/go to the gym/download
music, repeat Friday cycle from dinner on
ward. Sleep in on Sunday, get brunch again,
pretend to do work, actually do work, go to
sleep — the weekend is over. Granted, the
average undergrad might have a few varia
tions on this schedule — perhaps you plays
video games or Scrabble until the wee hours
of the morning instead of going to a party.
But in any case, the average Stanford un
dergrade weekends are far too predictable.
This predictability is especially disconcert
ing when one realizes that the Bay Area is
one of the most culturally active areas in the
United States. However, cultural outlets
that deserve more attention are not only
available outside of the Bubble. At Stan
ford, student organizations routinely sched
ule big speakers, internationally acclaimed
musicians and community events for the
student body to enjoy.
The staple student-attendees for visiting
speaker events, the Stanford graduate stu
dent population, is more prone than their
undergraduate counterparts to seek out the
special events that Stanford has to offer.
This predilection possibly arises because of
the strained budget on which grad students
often operate, or perhaps grad students
have simply grown out of their days of reck
less debauchery. In any case, undergrads
could take a few cues from their TAs and
explore the other avenues of entertainment
available to them.
If one wanted to shake things up this Fri
day, for example, one could: go to the Stan
ford World Arts Festival on Friday morning,
or get a free lunch at Jessica Riskin's "Me
chanical Christs, Hydraulic Brutes and the
Invention of Consciousness", watch a con

cert at Campbell Recital Hall, take a peek
at the calligraphy exhibit going on at the
Cantor Arts Center, go salsa dancing in Es
condido Village and still get back to their
dorm in time to attend that formulaic frat
party. And all of the events listed above
don't cost a penny.
Maybe undergrads do not know where
to look to find events going on around cam
pus. A comprehensive calendar of campus
events is listed at http://events.stanford.edu,
and the San Francisco Chronicle, the San
Jose Mercury News and the Palo Alto Daily
News, all have online calendars that detail
weekly events. Many formal institutions in
the area even offer special student rates.
The San Francisco Opera, for example, of
fers student tickets at half-price.
However, entertainment doesn't need to
be planned by someone else. Students
should take a bit more initiative in develop
ing their own fun. In an era when seniors
won't go to a bar on a Thursday unless they
can hitch a ride with the Marguerite, the
idea of pro-active planning may seem revo
lutionary. But. as near-adults, it seems ap
propriate that individual students take such
leaps. Stanford students work within organ
izations to plan social events, but the same
level of industry is rarely exhibited in friend
circles. Students don't seem to mind plan
ning Dance Marathon or Blackfest, but no
one can seem to find the energy or the time
to have a picnic at the beach.
It really isn't so difficult to do something
fun in less than three hours. Stanford is a
thirty-minute car ride to the beach, a forty
minute drive to San Francisco and a twenty
minute bike ride to stellar hiking, just to
mention a few fun things to do in the area. If
students do not have their own mode of
transportation, they can rent a car from the
Enterprise Rent-A-Car located on campus.
If students don't want to leave the Bubble
for an adventure, there is always
stieking clothes hangers to the mag
netic wall, canoodling in the Rodin
sculpture garden, running Mario
Kart simulations in the multi-level
parking garages, barbeques at Lake
Lag or dipping into the smattering of

semi-private hot tubs in the area.
Of course, the reason for under
grads' lack of social industry might be
a simple case of burn-out. Students do
put quite a bit of effort into their aca
demics and extra-curricular activities,
so it makes sense that last thing they
want to do is coordinate more parts of
their lives.There is something alluring
about just biking back from class on a
Friday afternoon, embraced in the
knowledge that nothing needs to be
finished until Monday morning and

that there are 48 hours to burn. But
the people who are content to go
back their dorms and do nothing but
watch Lost or play Beirut for hour
after hour, day after day, are in dan
ger. Ihese people are the next gener
ation of people who, thirty years from
now, will come home to their families,
flip on the TV and fall asleep to The
Late Show every night. Stanford stu
dents, save yourselves from this bor
ing life. Go and try to do something
different with your free time.

Invention of Consciousness", watch a con

cert at Campbell Recital Hall, take a peek
at the calligraphy exhibit going on at the
Cantor Arts Center, go salsa dancing in Es
condido Village and still get back to their
dorm in time to attend that formulaic frat
party. And all of the events listed above
don't cost a penny.
Maybe undergrads do not know where
to look to find events going on around cam
pus. A comprehensive calendar of campus
events is listed at http://events.stanford.edu,
and the San Francisco Chronicle, the San
Jose Mercury News and the Palo Alto Daily
News, all have online calendars that detail
weekly events. Many formal institutions in
the area even offer special student rates.
The San Francisco Opera, for example, of
fers student tickets at half-price.
However, entertainment doesn't need to
be planned by someone else. Students
should take a bit more initiative in develop
ing their own fun. In an era when seniors
won't go to a bar on a Thursday unless they
can hitch a ride with the Marguerite, the
idea of pro-active planning may seem revo
lutionary. But. as near-adults, it seems ap
propriate that individual students take such
leaps. Stanford students work within organ
izations to plan social events, but the same
level of industry is rarely exhibited in friend
circles. Students don't seem to mind plan
ning Dance Marathon or Blackfest, but no
one can seem to find the energy or the time
to have a picnic at the beach.
It really isn't so difficult to do something
fun in less than three hours. Stanford is a
thirty-minute car ride to the beach, a forty
minute drive to San Francisco and a twenty
minute bike ride to stellar hiking, just to
mention a few fun things to do in the area. If
students do not have their own mode of
transportation, they can rent a car from the
Enterprise Rent-A-Car located on campus.
If students don't want to leave the Bubble
for an adventure, there is always
stieking clothes hangers to the mag
netic wall, canoodling in the Rodin
sculpture garden, running Mario
Kart simulations in the multi-level
parking garages, barbeques at Lake
Lag or dipping into the smattering of

semi-private hot tubs in the area.
Of course, the reason for under
grads' lack of social industry might be
a simple case of burn-out. Students do
put quite a bit of effort into their aca
demics and extra-curricular activities,
so it makes sense that last thing they
want to do is coordinate more parts of
their lives.There is something alluring
about just biking back from class on a
Friday afternoon, embraced in the
knowledge that nothing needs to be
finished until Monday morning and

that there are 48 hours to burn. But
the people who are content to go
back their dorms and do nothing but
watch Lost or play Beirut for hour
after hour, day after day, are in dan
ger. Ihese people are the next gener
ation of people who, thirty years from
now, will come home to their families,
flip on the TV and fall asleep to The
Late Show every night. Stanford stu
dents, save yourselves from this bor
ing life. Go and try to do something
different with your free time.
