# The
						iGhost in the shell

The consumerist nation recently cele
brated the most holy day of its year.
Black Friday. There, every emotion,
memory, scent and convenience is sold at a
reasonable price. Buy a candle to remember
the smell of real cookies, or buy a fake plas
tic "Charlie Brown" Christmas tree so you
can remember an Xmas special that
mocked buying fake plastic Christmas trees.
Tis the season for irony.
Nothing is more iconic of consumerism
than the multi-functioning iPod. They can
get TV shows. They can get e-mail. Thanks
to iWow, they can even become a vibrator.
Now, online, you can get tips for turning
your iPod nano into a tool for communicat
ing with the dead. Candles and pentagrams
sold separately.
The supernatural and supertechnologi
cal are merging. I'm afraid Macintosh may
be meddling in forces more dangerous than
it could possibly imagine.
I can envision a new Mac versus PC com
mercial. The Mac guy, with his spunky opti
mism, says that he can deliver handheld
music and seamlessly integrate it with a
computer. PC guy says he can do that too,
except his is so bug-filled that his hand
catches on fire and he runs off stage scream
ing. Then Mac guy, getting a little cocky, says
that this same handheld device can commu
nicate with the dead. He then puts on a U2
song and while he rocks out on his iPod, a
vortex into the netherworld opens and a
hound of hell drags PC guy to fire and brim
stone.
I guess I never got into Ouija boards as a
kid. I never really felt that the best way to
honor my ancestors was by summoning the
dead in order to answer my pre-teen ques
tions about why a girl doesn't like me It also
never really seemed like a great party game.
If I was ever a ghost, I wouldn't use that
Ouija cursor thingie to greet kids at parties
— I'd get a pottery wheel, have my emo
tions imprint my intentions in clay and then
spell out my demands in wolf's blood. But
that's just me. I wouldn't be a very subtle
ghost.
Right now, we live in an age where we
build shopping malls on former cemeteries,
commemorate disasters by commercializ
ing them on T-shirts that say "I survived..."
and have our famous religious figures re
vealed publicly as sex-crazed, drug addled,
nut-jobs. People are looking for a spiritual
connection, and have for their own reasons
decided that the best way to reconnect with
the dead is to use a tool that we more com

monly use to listen to Coldplay and watch
porn. It seems that the little wheel and the
fact that it can go to all 26 letters makes it a
prime mechanism to communicate with the
deceased. The magenta-colored shell helps
too.
Let's assume that you can actually com
municate with the dead here, that the roam
ing spirits of this world would want to com
municate with our latte-loving, self-ab
sorbed generation. 1 would hate to think of
the second-rate ghosts you'd get communi
cating on an iPod Nano. Julius Caesar's sec
retary. Marilyn Monroe's agent. Jim
Belushi.
Personally, the fact that the dead are
upgrading their communications to meet
with the changing technology makes a lot
of sense. I've always wondered why my
iPod would shuffle those same Get Up
Kids songs so much — it's a sign from the
great beyond! Perhaps the ghosts haunt
ing me are emo. Check that — the only
bands that would be post-emo would in
fact be dead.
Putting the ghosts into the computer
shell may sound silly to some, but society is
increasingly trying to reconcile the digital
and the divine. Religious groups have
sought to spread their message through the
Internet, and many people have tried to rec
oncile modern technology, the new Golden
iCon of iDoltery, with their own spiritual
ism. Others react to this consumerism with
crazed boycotts against stores that don't say
Merry Christmas. But let's face it: the new
gods have white casing and USB ports and
backwards compatibility. In an age where
cars parallel park themselves and kids are
excited about the latest Kelly Clarkson pod
cast, people arc looking for some sign that
spiritualism hasn't been deleted from our
collective memory banks.
