# "That kid"
## 
### 
Regrettably, That Kid receives the an
noying-student baton and sprints by
all of the foot-tapping, bubble-gum
popping, AIM-chatting, Internet-shopping
competition. He is the IHUM Kid's evil twin
brother — twice as outspoken and four
times as obnoxious, and he populates every
one of your classes, humanities and other
wise. That Kid isn't just the student that sits in
the front and consistently raises his hand,
arm stick-straight, fingers wiggling like
worms with ADD. That was IHUM Kid. a
mere oddly-shaped, benign mole compared
to That Kid's cancerous melanoma.
In large lecture halls, That Kid is the one
who asks questions that don't help clarify
anything and instead pertain to material that
the professor has explicitly stated will not be
on the final. Her inquiries are generally far
beyond the scope of lecture, and she almost
always draws comparisons to other classes
she has taken or is taking concurrently.
Sometimes she even likes to describe real
life personal experiences which, luckily, re
late to the subject of the lecture. Just as she
learned in her other developmental psychol
ogy class, young twins (exactly like the ones
she happens to baby-sit regularly) display
the same cognitive deficiencies which sur
prisingly resulted in me stapling her mouth
shut.
In small seminars, That Kid offers gems of
analysis five times more than anyone else, in
cluding the professor. I lis answers are invari
ably too long and always contain massive vo
cabulary words. I can't help but roll my eyes,
completely annoyed at his pitiable and see
through attempts to cultivate an iota of self
confidence by parading his barely above-av
erage lexicon. Although sometimes, I write
down the words I don't know and look them
up at home.
The most insufferable thing about That
Kid. that is besides her nasally voice, ail-too
rich vocabulary, eager finger-wiggling and
should-be-asked-in-office-hours questions.

is her ambiguous motivations. That Kid
speaks both to impress the teacher and to sat
isfy her own bottomless personal quest for
knowledge — she is a maddeningly odd
blend of proud self-congratulation and gen
uine academic interest. I hate her for her un
believably poor lecture etiquette, yet I ad
mire how unswervingly prepared for class
she is, regardless of a heavy reading load or
complicated problem sets. Tliis scholastic re
spect only fuels my hatred, however, since
when pitted head-to-head against Geeky
Mcl-don't-understand-social-cues, 1 know
she will win the Better Student Award every
time.
Sometimes I imagine That Kid in ten, or
even five years, and 1 start to mentally
drown in a frothy bitter pit of despair. Be
cause he raised his hand so freely and was so
joyously involved in every discussion sec
tion, optional class, and office hour, eighty
five tenured, emeritus Stanford professors
not only knew That Kid, but had him
babysitting their children and proofreading
their latest publications for petty grammar
mistakes and scholarly vocabulary inser
tion.Their relationship, further bolstered by
their mutual passion for Proust and their
perusal of rare book fairs to discover and
purchase other such gems of early 20th cen
tury modernist literature, in turn leads to
the most staggeringly praiseful recommen
dation letter that the world has ever known,
where That Kid is actually compared to
Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Paul Farmer and
Bono in a few letters of note. These deep

connections to the zenith of America's intel
ligentsia, lands That Kid not only an intern
ship that is more selective than candidature
for the Papacy, hut also a six-digit dream job
"consulting" for an "environmentally con
scious" company that donates millions an
nually to AIDS research, offers comple
mentary meals and massages and urges em
ployees to sit on big green bouncy balls in
stead of office roily-chairs to increase core
strength and foster a healthy, ergonomic
work space.That Kid actually then becomes
your dad's boss, and you have never felt
more strongly than now that Denis Quaid
deserved an Oscar nod for his poignant role
in the film "In Good Company." Perhaps a
little embarrassment in front of a lecture
hall of 300 people is worth it.
Then again, however, That Kid isn't per
fect. She shows up to a board meeting, so
your father tells you, and while she bobs up
and down on her green bouncy ball, she in
terrupts, side-tracks the meeting and tells
personal stories which are only marginally
related to the topic at hand. Once, at another
board meeting,she heard a similar theme dis
cussed and there they all shared their person
al goals which resulted in, quite surprisingly,
your father binder-clipping her lips together.
Eyes roll, and pens begin to tap — her group
manners are as off-putting as always.
Perhaps we should all take a few cues from
each other. I could raise my hand more.That
Kid could leave the library on a Friday night
(there's a reason Green closes so early). I
could visit office hours occasionally, That Kid
could work on fostering an interaction with
the opposite sex outside of Beginning Social
Dance. After all, that is what diversity is
about, learning from those who are different
trom ourselves. And who knows, maybe That
Kid and IHUM Kid could start a beautiful
life together.

Sorry, I hat Kid. E-mail Katie with your well
worded responses at kttaylor@stanford.edu
