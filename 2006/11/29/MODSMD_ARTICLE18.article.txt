## Support Teach for America 
### 
Ahh. it's that time of year again: eggnog
becomes an ingestible beverage,shop owners
are arrested for playing any music besides
Christmas carols and the school of education
forces are intimidating would-be Teach For
America applicants.
1 just can't understand what point theTFA
detractors cited in your article, Prof. Rachel
Lotan and Prof. Linda Darling-Hammond,are
trying to make by slamming TFA, year after
year. If they are arguing that twelve months of

training prepares future teachers better than a
summer-long course, then no one will dispute
their claim. But most TFA applicants would
not become teachers if a year-long program
were the only path to the classroom.
If, instead, Darling-Hammond and Lotan
want to argue that the thousands of dedicat
ed teaehers who have joined TFA to work in
America's toughest schools have diminished
the quality of education for our neediest kids,
then they are out of their minds. Principals
wouldn't hire TFA teachers if they had better
candidates lining up outside their office.

Those I f*A alums who leave the classroom
have gone on to found charter schools, serve
on school hoards and start non-profits, fur
thering the mission of educational equity.
Rather than fight amongst ourselves, we
who are committed to quality schools for
every child should join forces and push for all
the resources, manpower and ideas our soci
ety can muster for this pressing cause.
