## Time for a turnaround With their first losing record in seven years, Stanford women look to rebound from tough road trip against Santa Clara 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's basketball team re
turns home with hopes of erasing the mem
ory of its three unsavory losses, a streak
which gave the Cardinal a sub-.500 record
for the first time in seven years. Stanford
(2-3) will host Santa Clara (4-2) tonight to
kick of a three-game homestand.
After road losses to No. 4 Tennessee and
No. X Georgia last week, the Cardinal hope
that the lessons of traveling and a home
crowd will give them the advantage in their
meeting with the Broncos.
"We always like playing in Maples,"
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "It's a great
atmosphere. Our team is happy to be back,
and I think we learned a lot on our road
trip. We played against two top 10 teams
[andj we're disappointed in what we did. I
think that we have very competitive play
ers, and [a loss| makes people even more
competitive. It makes them more deter
mined."
Stanford will try to focus that increased
motivation on improving upon various as
pects of their team play. For one, the Cardi
nal will need to convert free-throw oppor
tunities, an area in which Stanford strug
gled at Georgia, shooting only 25 percent
from the line. VanDerveer emphasized a
need for shared responsibility, especially
on offense.
"I think we're looking for more of a bal
ance," VanDerveer said. "We want more
scoring from more people, different peo
ple. We want more aggressiveness defen
sively and offensively also."
Ibis desired balance would require that
Stanford rely less on its three leading scor
ers: junior guard Candice Wiggins, senior
forward Brooke Smith and freshman for
ward Jayne Appel.Thus far. the three have
combined for nearly 65 percent of the
team's scoring.
" [I'm looking to) the usual suspects [to
lead the team against Santa Clara]," Van-
Derveer said."Candice and Brooke are ob-

viously our 1-2 punch. But, we want to be
more than a one-, two- or three-scorer
team."
However, the Cardinal recognize that
their own play alone will not determine the
outcome of the game against the Broncos,
who currently sit atop the West Coast Con
ference. With nine returning upperciass
men. including five seniors. Santa Clara
brings an experienced squad to the floor.
Guards Chandice Cronk and Ashley
Graham, who together average more than
thirty points per game, headed Santa Clara's
conference-leading scoring offense last
year. Although graduated players Michelle
Cozad and Kayla I luss will be missed by the
Broncos' small lineup. Santa Clara has re
cently gotten help down low from Jen
Gottschalk, who opened the season with her
first two career double-doubles.
VanDerveer. though.does not think that
Stanford will be surprised by the Broncos'
level of play.
"They are excellent three-point shoot
ers; they're a very talented team," Van-
Derveer said. "We played them two years
ago in the NCAA Tournament, so we're fa
miliar with Graham, Cronk. Monteith and
Walker, and a lot of the other key players."
Familiarity, however, is not equivalent
to complete comfort for the Cardinal. Stan
ford knows that Santa Clara will arrive at
Maples ready for a challenge, and the Car
dinal will have to perform at their best level
to claim a victory and take a first step to
ward achieving the high expectations of the
preseason.
