## New and improved tradition promises to be shorter, smarter and sexier 
### JULIE KLEIN DESK EDITOR 
Director Amanda Otte has just
one thing to say about the show.
"Our naked people this year are
very hot."
Tickets are still available for
tonight's opening of Gaieties, which
will showcase a cast that includes
freshman basketball standout Robin
Lopez.
The theme of "From Cal with
Love" was apparent from the start at
last night's dress rehearsal with an
opening musical number about
Berkeley's plot against Stanford.
The show is tied together with "a
lot of recurring characters," said Pro
ducer Jason Richman, a sophomore.
"It's not completely random. [ From
Cal With Love'] is very smart in the
humor thatis used."
Otte. a junior, has been involved

with Gaieties for three years and em
phasized the improved quality of this
year's characters.
"The characters are really actual
ly funny," she said. "ITie level of tal
ent this year was extremely over
whelming. We have the very best that
Stanford has to offer."
Otte and Richman were not alone
in their decision to revamp this
year's production. ITie two worked
alongside assistant producers Anne
1 lerbert. Christina I iartje-Dunn and
Lisa Kerner, all sophomores.
Iliis year is a "big step for Gai
eties," Richman said, as it leaves be
hind its long tradition of two to three
hour shows. The show is one hour
and forty minutes, with only five mu
sical numbers,in an effort to keep the
audience focused and heckling to a
minimum.
