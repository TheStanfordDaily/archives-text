Ihe Cardinal (5-1) and visiting Aggies (0-6)
combined for 49 total turnovers, 51 fouls and 21
missed free throws. Stanford coughed up 22 of the
turnovers, committed 24 of the fouls and missed
12 free throws, but UC-Davis' miscues ended up
the most egregious.
The Aggies, yet to play a home game this sea
son. turned the ball over 12 limes in the first 10
minutes including in six straight possessions.
Helped by the Aggies' inability to keep posses
sion. Stanford built an l<S-6 lead six minutes in and
stretched it to 31-15 with 8:06 to go in the first half.
But the Aggies did give the spirited, if small,
contingent of visiting fans their money's worth,
using a 9-0 run to draw to 35-29 in the first half's
final minutes. Davis also went on 7-0 and 10-0
spurts as the game wound down to tighten a 70-43
deficit to 77-67 with two minutes to play.
"We didn't put them away." senior forward
Fred Washington said. "We've being doing that all
year. We'd relax, lose focus or something — you
name it, we did it. We can't be doing this all year
because it's going to cost us a game down the
line."
After each UC-Davis run. however. Stanford
responded. After the Aggies' first-half burst.
Stanford's three sophomores — shooting guard
Anthony Goods (IS points. 4-of-5 three-point
ers), point guard Mitch Johnson (eight points,
four assists, five turnovers) and forward
Lawrence Hill (20 points, 9-of-10 shooting, 11 re
bounds) — each found the twine.combining for a
6-0 run that gave the Cardinal a 41-29 halftime
lead. And when UC-Davis closed to within 10
with two minutes to go. Goods came up with a
game-icing three from the left baseline.
Washington (14 points. 6-of-8 shooting, six as
sists. five turnovers) and junior forward Taj l inger
(11 points. 5-of-7 shooting) carried much of the
scoring load alongside the sophomores, but many
Stanford fans were more interested in a player
than did not score a single point.
Freshman center Brook Lopez joined his twin
Robin Lopez, also a seven-foot freshman, in his
first action of his Stanford career, to healthy
cheers from the fans. Though neither Robin (five
points, l-of-7 tree throws) nor Brook (four min
utes, zero points) had nights that the family will
boast about in their Christmas cards, seeing
Brook on the Maples hardwood, recovered from
back complications that have sidelined him since
July, was a treat to fans and coach alike.
"That he's healthy is the main concern," Trent
Johnson said. "I le needs to get into game shape,
let alone practice shape. He's nothing like the
player he's going to be."
Junior center Peter Prowitt scored four points
in ten minutes in his second game back from a

knee injury while freshman forward Will Paul, re
covering from an ankle sprain, did not see the
court. Both players could provide a big boost on
Sunday, with Bob Knight's powerful Texas Tech
squad looming in San Jose's Pete Newell Chal

Ihe Cardinal (5-1) and visiting Aggies (0-6)
combined for 49 total turnovers, 51 fouls and 21
missed free throws. Stanford coughed up 22 of the
turnovers, committed 24 of the fouls and missed
12 free throws, but UC-Davis' miscues ended up
the most egregious.
The Aggies, yet to play a home game this sea
son. turned the ball over 12 limes in the first 10
minutes including in six straight possessions.
Helped by the Aggies' inability to keep posses
sion. Stanford built an l<S-6 lead six minutes in and
stretched it to 31-15 with 8:06 to go in the first half.
But the Aggies did give the spirited, if small,
contingent of visiting fans their money's worth,
using a 9-0 run to draw to 35-29 in the first half's
final minutes. Davis also went on 7-0 and 10-0
spurts as the game wound down to tighten a 70-43
deficit to 77-67 with two minutes to play.
"We didn't put them away." senior forward
Fred Washington said. "We've being doing that all
year. We'd relax, lose focus or something — you
name it, we did it. We can't be doing this all year
because it's going to cost us a game down the
line."
After each UC-Davis run. however. Stanford
responded. After the Aggies' first-half burst.
Stanford's three sophomores — shooting guard
Anthony Goods (IS points. 4-of-5 three-point
ers), point guard Mitch Johnson (eight points,
four assists, five turnovers) and forward
Lawrence Hill (20 points, 9-of-10 shooting, 11 re
bounds) — each found the twine.combining for a
6-0 run that gave the Cardinal a 41-29 halftime
lead. And when UC-Davis closed to within 10
with two minutes to go. Goods came up with a
game-icing three from the left baseline.
Washington (14 points. 6-of-8 shooting, six as
sists. five turnovers) and junior forward Taj l inger
(11 points. 5-of-7 shooting) carried much of the
scoring load alongside the sophomores, but many
Stanford fans were more interested in a player
than did not score a single point.
Freshman center Brook Lopez joined his twin
Robin Lopez, also a seven-foot freshman, in his
first action of his Stanford career, to healthy
cheers from the fans. Though neither Robin (five
points, l-of-7 tree throws) nor Brook (four min
utes, zero points) had nights that the family will
boast about in their Christmas cards, seeing
Brook on the Maples hardwood, recovered from
back complications that have sidelined him since
July, was a treat to fans and coach alike.
"That he's healthy is the main concern," Trent
Johnson said. "I le needs to get into game shape,
let alone practice shape. He's nothing like the
player he's going to be."
Junior center Peter Prowitt scored four points
in ten minutes in his second game back from a

knee injury while freshman forward Will Paul, re
covering from an ankle sprain, did not see the
court. Both players could provide a big boost on
