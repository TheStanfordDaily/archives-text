## Jazz and Magic have what it takes 
### 
Compared to the full length of the seemingly
eternal NBA season, only a tiny fraction of
the this year's schedule has been played. But
it's never too early to make postseason predictions.
Based on their performances so far, could we real
ly he looking at a Utah Jazz vs. Orlando Magic
final?
Honestly, yes.
The Eastern Conference, thus far, has been an
unbelievable display of mediocrity. Just consider
some of the relevant stats. New Jersey leads the At
lantic Division with a record of 5-8. A total of three,
count it, three teams have a winning record in the
entire Eastern Conference. With the losses piling
up in the East faster than you can say "Tskitishvili."
you have to wonder. Where are all the wins from
these games going?
The answer? To the Orlando Magic and the
Western Conference.The Magic are the only team
in the East with a record worthy of any sort of
praise. At 11-4, they sit atop the Eastern Confer
ence, and. with their lineup, I suspect their success
will not be short-lived.
The Magic are clicking on all cylinders, combin
ing experience with youthful talent in both their
back and frontcourts. Jameer Nelson, generously
listed at 6-foot-0. has established himself as a point
guard that can hold his own in the NBA, averaging
a respectable 14.7 points a game. He's teamed up
with a Grant Hill who. after sustaining more in
juries in his career than a hemophiliac on a battle
field, may finally be healthy. Hill has played in —
cross your lingers now— 13 of Orlando's first 14
games, adding consistent scoring to the backcourt
at a 16.5 points per game clip.
But the real story for the Magic is Dwight
Howard. Like most of the NBA's stars that came
straight out of high school. I loward is enjoying in
credible success in his third year as a pro. Averaging
a double-double with 16.7 points and 13.7 re
bounds per game, Howard has established himself
as one of the best big men in the center-lacking
East.
And finally, the Magic have Carlos Arroyo com
ing off the bench, a stellar point guard who showed
in world basketball competition that he could run
with the best in the world.
Now on to the Magic's future foes in the West.
Sure the West may be home to l im
Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki and Kevin
Garnett. But it's also home to the
likes of Deron Williams, \ndrei Kir
ilenko and Carlos Boozer, r'utlire
1 lall of Fame Coach Jet i \ Sloan lias
his Jazz playing unbelievable bas
ketball in his 19th season as the head
coach.
Carlos Boozer has managed to
transform himself from the role
player he used to be in ('levetand to
a bona fide superstai averaging
more than 20 points and 12 re
bounds per game. And, not to com
mit blasphemy among Jazz fans,
Deron Williams (17.1 points per
game, 9.0 assists pei game) is doing
an awfully good job ol filling the
shoes left empty since John Stock
ton's retirement. Finally, Kirilenko
provides the scrappy play that ever}
team needs, blocking almost 3 shots
per game and altering countless oth
ers.
And so you have it. a television
executive's worst nightmare. A 1 Hah
Jazz and Orlando Magic final com
pletely devoid of King James, I lash
or The Big Aristotle. A final that no
one would have predicted, but does
n't seem quite so out of the question
anymore.Then again, there are still 7
months and 67 games to play. Any
thing could happen.
