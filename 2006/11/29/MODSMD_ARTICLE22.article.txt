Week 13 Results
No. 5 Notre Dame 24. No. 3 IJSC 44
A week after wrapping up the Pac

10 conference title with a win over
Cal, the Trojans put themselves one
win away from the BCS Champi
onship Game with a 44-24 drubbing
of the Fighting Irish.
USC receiver Dwayne Jarrett
hauled in three touchdown passes
from John David Booty, including a
back-breaker with 8:21 left that
pushed the Trojans' lead to 37-17.
The Irish had their share of
chances, but couldn't capitalize in a
number of critical situations. Late in
the first half, Notre Dame had a pair of
fourth-and-short plays deep in USC
territory and failed to convert tin each
occasion. They also intercepted two

Booty passes and blocked a USC
punt, but turned only one of those op
portunities into a touchdown.
USC freshman tailback C.J. Gable
outperformed Notre Dame's junior
speedster Darius Walker in the run
ning game. Gable finished with 107
yards on 20 carries, while Walker
amassed just 56 yards on 14 attempts.
Notre Dame quarterback Brady
Quinn, in his final regular-season
game with the Irish, completed 22 of
his 45 passes for 274 yards, three
touchdowns and no interceptions. 1 le
also led Notre Dame with 74 rush
yards on 11 carries.
USC faces UCLA at the Rose
Bowl on Saturday with a National
Championship Game berth on the
line.The Trojans have beaten the Bru
ins seven consecutive times.
Oregon 28, Oregon State 30
Alexis Serna kicked a 40-yard field

goal with 1:12 left in the game and the
Beavers' special teams blocked an
Oregon attempt seconds later to hand
Oregon State a 30-28 victory in the
Civil War.
Matt Moore threw for 255 yards, a
touchdown and no interceptions and
Yvenson Bernard scored once to
carry the Beavers to a win in the 1 10 th
edition of the in-state rivalry'.
Oregon opted to start quarterback
Brady Leaf, rather than usual starter
Dennis Dixon, after Dixon's struggles
in recent weeks. Leaf was 25-of-42
passing with a touchdown and an in
terception and nearly led the Ducks to
a last-second win. But Oregon back-up
kicker Matt Everson kicked the ball
into the line on a 44-yard field goal at
tempt with 20 seconds remaining.
The Beavers took a 20-7 lead into
halftime, but the Ducks battled back
to take their first lead of the game
with 3:07 remaining when Leaf found

Jordan Kent on a 26-yard touchdown
strike. Rather than kick the extra
point for the tie, Oregon coach Mike
Belotti sent his offense out for a two
point conversion try. Leaf ran the ball
in himself and gave the Ducks a 28-27
lead,only to watch Serna's game-win
ning kick minutes later.
Oregon State closed the regular
season with six wins in their last seven
games. Oregon, meanwhile, finished
with three consecutive losses.
Arizona State 28, Arizona 14
In his last game as head coach. Ari
zona State's Dirk Koetter led the Sun
Devils to a 28-14 win against in-state
rival Arizona to capture the Territori
al Cup.
Much-maligned Sun Devil quar
terback Rudy Carpenter tossed three
touchdowns, all in the first quarter,
and racked up 218 yards against a
tough Arizona secondary. The three

quick scores gave Arizona State an
early 21-0 lead from which the Wild
cats could not recover, Iliey cut the
Sun Devil lead to 21-14 with a pair of
scores in the second quarter, hut
could never get within seven points of
their rivals from Tempe.
Arizona starting quarterback
Willie Tuitama suffered a reported
"slight concussion" midway through
the second quarter and did not return.
Adam Austin came in and led the
Wildcats on a scoring drive, but also
threw two interceptions. It was the
second year in a row that Arizona
State knocked Tuitama out of the an
nual matchup.
Despite the victory. Arizona State
fired Koetter the next day. koetter
went 40-33 in six years at the helm of
the Sun Devils, but only against
ranked teams. Arizona State never
won a Pac-lOgame in the state of Cal
ifornia under Koetter.
