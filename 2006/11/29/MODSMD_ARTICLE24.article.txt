# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Love at first bump-set-spike Senior A Nnamani faces final try for Final Four 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
For the last four years, senior Nji
Nnamani has been living her dream.
Growing up in Normal, 111.. Nnamani
was a fan of Stanford volleyball and
idolized legendary Cardinal players like
Kerri Walsh, Logan Tom and her older
sister Ogonna.
"I 'm just so excited and blessed to be
able to come to Stanford and fulfill my
childhood dream," Nnamani said. "I
pinch myself every day when I realize
I'm playing in the same gvm as such
great players from the past."
Hie five-foot-nine outside hitter has
certainly come a long way, from the day
she first picked up a volleyball in grade
school to Senior Night in Maples Pavil
ion.
A co-captain of the No. 2 Stanford
women's volleyball, Nnamani has
played in 86 games for the Cardinal this
season, starting all but three matches.
She is averaging just under one kill and
two digs per game and is third on the
team in service aces. She collected a sea
son-high six kills on Sept. 10 against St.
Mary's and has recorded double-digit
digs in four matches.
Nnamani first played volleyball in
sixth grade when she grew tired of get
ting beat up by the physicality of basket
ball. She decided to give volleyball a
shot during the sixth grade,after her sis

ter. two years older, had been recruited
by the middle school's coaches.
It was love at first spike for Nji.
"I loved the game so much, so 1 be
came more and more intense until 1 was
hooked," Nnamani said. "I just enjoy
the finesse and the teamwork that's re
quired to succeed."
Alter junior high, Nnamani joined
traveling club teams and was eventually
selected as a member of the U.S.A. 1 ligh
Performance team that competed inter
nationally in 1999.
And her sister was with her every
step of the way. ()gonna. who graduated
in 2005. is no stranger to success on the
court. A four-time Ail-American at
Stanford, she won the 2005 Collegiate
Woman Athlete of the Year Award after
helping lead the Cardinal to the nation
al title in 2004.
When it came time to choose a col
lege. Nji followed her sister to The Farm.
"Playing with my sister is my best
memory." Nnamani said. "Volleyball
means so much to me because it made
me and my sister as close as we are
today. Playing with her at every level
has been more than a dream."
And Nji's strong family ties don't
end with Ogonna. Their parents, Chika
and Uzo. immigrated to the United
States from Nigeria in the 70s in search
of higher education. Nnamani said she
remembers her parents' sacrifice as a
motivation to succeed in all her endeav
ors.
"I know how much the sacrifices
they made mean to people," Nnamani
said. "I know my parents gave up so
much in Nigeria to come here and reach
their full potential,and they stressed the

importance of education to me."
Nnamani has faced her own chal
lenges and considers her freshman year
at Stanford one of the toughest experi
ences of her life.
"I am just so close to my family and
friends that 1 wasn't used to being far
from home," she said. "Freshman year
ended up being very intense and a diffi
cult adjustment."
Luckily for Nnamani. she could al
ways turn to her sister, who had encoun
tered the same experience just two
years earlier. And Nnamani ended up
realizing that she could also turn to her
new family — Stanford volleyball.
"My teammates are like my adopted
sisters." she said. "We get along so well,
and we all know each other inside and
out. It's awesome to have that team dy
namic."
Nnamani has taken in many lessons,
in and out of the classroom, during her
stay on the Farm. But perhaps the most
significant one came earlier. In high
school, Nnamani lost one of her closest
friends and teammates in a car acci
dent.
"[The accident] really shaped who I
am today; anyone 1 know can tell you
that," Nnamani said. "1 have realized
that life is very short. It's all about just
trying to enjoy life and loving to be
happy. I don't take anything for granted
any more."
As she prepares to leave Stanford,
Nnamani says that she will carry this
wisdom with her.
"I've realized that when you want
something, go do it," she said. "Don't
just want it. You've really got to go out
after what you want."

"I loved the game so much, so 1 be
came more and more intense until 1 was
hooked," Nnamani said. "I just enjoy
the finesse and the teamwork that's re
quired to succeed."
Alter junior high, Nnamani joined
traveling club teams and was eventually
selected as a member of the U.S.A. 1 ligh
Performance team that competed inter
nationally in 1999.
And her sister was with her every
step of the way. ()gonna. who graduated
in 2005. is no stranger to success on the
court. A four-time Ail-American at
Stanford, she won the 2005 Collegiate
Woman Athlete of the Year Award after
helping lead the Cardinal to the nation
al title in 2004.
When it came time to choose a col
lege. Nji followed her sister to The Farm.
"Playing with my sister is my best
memory." Nnamani said. "Volleyball
means so much to me because it made
me and my sister as close as we are
today. Playing with her at every level
has been more than a dream."
And Nji's strong family ties don't
end with Ogonna. Their parents, Chika
and Uzo. immigrated to the United
States from Nigeria in the 70s in search
of higher education. Nnamani said she
remembers her parents' sacrifice as a
motivation to succeed in all her endeav
ors.
"I know how much the sacrifices
they made mean to people," Nnamani
said. "I know my parents gave up so
much in Nigeria to come here and reach
their full potential,and they stressed the

importance of education to me."
Nnamani has faced her own chal
lenges and considers her freshman year
at Stanford one of the toughest experi
ences of her life.
"I am just so close to my family and
friends that 1 wasn't used to being far
from home," she said. "Freshman year
ended up being very intense and a diffi
cult adjustment."
Luckily for Nnamani. she could al
ways turn to her sister, who had encoun
tered the same experience just two
years earlier. And Nnamani ended up
realizing that she could also turn to her
new family — Stanford volleyball.
"My teammates are like my adopted
sisters." she said. "We get along so well,
and we all know each other inside and
out. It's awesome to have that team dy
namic."
Nnamani has taken in many lessons,
in and out of the classroom, during her
stay on the Farm. But perhaps the most
significant one came earlier. In high
school, Nnamani lost one of her closest
friends and teammates in a car acci
dent.
"[The accident] really shaped who I
am today; anyone 1 know can tell you
that," Nnamani said. "1 have realized
that life is very short. It's all about just
trying to enjoy life and loving to be
happy. I don't take anything for granted
any more."
As she prepares to leave Stanford,
Nnamani says that she will carry this
wisdom with her.
"I've realized that when you want
something, go do it," she said. "Don't
just want it. You've really got to go out
after what you want."
