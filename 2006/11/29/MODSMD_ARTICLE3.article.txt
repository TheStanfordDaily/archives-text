## Raagapella sings to victory South Asian a cappella group wins its second title 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Raagapella successfully defended its title at
the South Asian A Cappella Championships
Nov. 18. picking up hardware for the second
year in a row and highlighting the growing in
terest in the blend of Eastern and Western mu
sical traditions.
Hie group, which took home the top prize
last year as well, competed at Berkeley against
five other South Asian a cappella groups from
the West Coast. Stanford singers performed
three Bollywood hits and one original piece
written by Raagapella members.
Senior Vivek Agrawal. music director for the
group, attributed the win to the groups passion
for South Asian music.
"Everyone was determined and energized
by the idea of competing and being able to show
what good South Asian music sounds like." he
said. "The group really loves the music and just
enjoys performing it."
Raagapella was founded by four students in
2(X)2 for a one-night performance. Since then,
the group has grown to 13 members — includ

ing three non-South Asians — toured the coun
try, sold 1.000 copies of their debut album and
performed in Los Angeles with popular Hindi
film composer A. R. Rahman.
Raagapella uses a cappella to fuse Western
forms and traditional South Asian music.
"You have Hindustani classical, which isn't
really used to harmonies," Agrawal explained.
"And that's starting to change in recent years,
with people starting to experiment with har
monies and chords. Hut before,that wasn't real
ly a part of that tradition, so 1 think that what
Raagapella is doing is really new for the genre."
Junior Sunthar Premakumar. marketing di
rector and business manager for the group, had
not even heard of a cappella until he came to
the Farm from Sri Lanka.
"The only forms of music that are really as
sociated with South Asia are traditional carnat
ic music or ragas and Bollywood songs," he said.
While the group covers many Bollywood
songs, it also tries to reinterpret Indian film hits
to give them a more Western feel.The members
have been working on integrating classical Indi
an music into Western songs. In addition, while
many of the songs are currently sung in Hindi,
the official language of India, the group also
sings in Tamil, Punjabi and English.
In the future, Agrawal hopes that Raagapel-

la will expand its musical borders
even further.
"We don't come with one model
and settle on it."he said. "We try to
push, creating new songs, doing new
types ot songs. It we want to do an
R&B song, then we find a way to put
an interesting twist on it. If we want
to do a choral song, we can do that.
Raagapella is a melting pot of gen
res."
