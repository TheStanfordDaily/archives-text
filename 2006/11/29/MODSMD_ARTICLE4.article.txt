### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students must combine university re
sources and innovative thinking to effec
tively change the world. State Controller
Steve Westly. class of l l >7B. told members
ofThe Roosevelt Institution last night.
"You are sitting right in Silicon Valley
in the technology center of the world."
Westlv said, it's like being an artist in

Florence in the Renaissance. Do some
thing with what you have here. Play a role
to have an impact."
Ilie talk was part of tihe think tank's
student-initiated course, "Creating and
Analyzing Public Policy: The Roosevelt
Institution."Westly broached a wide set of
issues, ranging from reflections on his
failed gubernatorial bid. his role as state
controller of the sixth largest economy in
the world and his life as a former Stanford
student and activist.
1 le also urged students to get involved
with The Roosevelt Institution, which he
said exemplifies his message of student
empowerment in a world that views

young activists with doubt and cynicism.
"If you are a young person, you're
given short shrift in the world," Westly
said. "But it doesn't need to be that way.
There are other fields, where frankly,
younger people have as much if not more
value as older adults do, and policy is one
of them."
He also addressed the cynicism he
faced from trustee members as a former
ASSU President when he pressed the
University to divest from South Africa
during apartheid. When officials refused,
he rallied nearly 2.000 protestors to storm
administrators' offices. While this
stunt failed to change the Universi
ty's investment policy in the short
run, lie said that it sent University of
ficials a message and catalyzed stu
dent activism around the apartheid
issue.
" lliis was a matter of moral im
portance as members of Stanford
and the broader world community."
Westly said. "To really get people's
attention, we had to peel back the
onion and see what was reaching
people."
Similarly, during his failed cam
paign for the governor's office. West
ly said that he tried to appeal to var
ious constituencies with a message of
bipartisanship and a policy agenda
that rang true with C'alifornians. In
retrospect, he blamed his primary
loss on his unwillingness to cultivate
support among traditional con
stituencies like nurses and labor
unions.
"I couldn't quite muster enough

support," he said. "I wasn't too far
from escaping the traditional gravi
tational pull that [causes] people to
follow traditional party orthodoxy."
Amol Helekar, a senior and for
mer president of The Roosevelt In
stitution. said that Westly's talk
aligned nicely with the organiza
tion's stated mission.
"He hit at the core issues, which
are to get students actively involved
not in the political cynicism of the
mainstream process, but in really
producing effective policy ideas," he
said.
Roosevelt Operations Coordina
tor Arthur Kaneko. a sophomore,
said that he found Westly's pragmat
ic style appealing, but he felt that the
overall message might be out of step
with political realities.
"I think it's cool that he under
stands the practicalities of the polit
ical process and also understands
that it's not about an issue of being
right or wrong," he said. "His mes
sage emphasized reaching people at
their heart over politics. Hut while
that was refreshing, I felt like that
also leads him to be disconnected
from the actual power game of poli
tics, which may be where he falls

short."
Roosevelt Institution President
Eric Mitzenmacher, a junior, praised
Westly for illuminating the relation
ship between politics and policy.
"The talk was a good mix of sub
stance in terms of addressing cam
paign finance, bipartisanship and
process in terms of how the student
might get involved and how ballot
initiatives could be improved,"
Mitzenmacher said. "We wanted to
get a good idea of how the entire
sphere of state governance works,
and that's what he gave us."
Throughout his discussion. West
ly repeatedly emphasized his com
mitment to lending students a help
ing hand as they strive to make poli
cy waves. Kai Stinchcombe, a Stan
ford alumnus and cofounder of the
think tank's Stanford chapter, said
that Westly's talk demonstrated his
dedication to advancing the cause of
student activism..
"Steve Westly has been a long
time advisor and friend to Roosevelt
and has been a leader in involving
young people in his policymaking
operation," he said. "His offer to
speak to us is just an example of
this."
