## Vice rocks White Plaza with eclectic playlist 
### LIA HARDIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The new, talent-packed, all
sophomore rock quintet Vice
shook the birdcage in White Plaza
yesterday, spending the ninety
sixth hour before Big Game pro
ducing an unapologetically eclec
tic rock 'n' roll set with enough en
ergy to stop a few bicyclists in their
tracks.
Vice was the featured artist for
Big Game Week's Sophomore
Day. The band performed to the
cheers of fans, friends of the band
and passers-by drawn in by the
music while Gaieties tickets and
Big Game merchandise were sold
nearby. The group's eighties rock
and modern pop-rock covers were
punctuated with four original
songs, which were recently added
to its repertoire.
The band's original work tack
led a diverse set of musical genres:

"A World Away" was funky. "No
Mercy" was bluesy and "Real
Love" was about, well, real love.
"Forgive Me, Father" was the
fourth original.
"We like rock that's raunchy,
fun and playful," said lead singer
Brodie Jenkins, who said she was
thrilled to play for Hig Game
Week. "It's about getting people
revved up and crazy. White Plaza is
the central area of campus â€” I like
the fact that it's not a static audi
ence."
Vice's set began right after the
Axe Committee blew the train
whistle at noon.
Aside from Jenkins, Vice is
comprised of Jesse Engreitz on
keyboard, Grahame Lesh on gui
tar. Mac Parish on bass and Eric
Saar on drums. Last year, Engreitz,
Lesh, Parish and Saar were mem
bers of Dirty Blonde, a group that

has since disbanded.
Jenkins lived in the same freshman
dorm ;is Rngreitzand Saar. who asked
her to join Vice earlier this year.
"Hric came up to me and said.
Ilev do you want to be our front
woman?'" Jenkins said, before
adding, "They needed a girl to bal
ance out their manliness," or the
"overwhelming testosterone," as
Lesh put it.
The Vice members are musical
notables at Stanford. Jenkins "grew
up" singing in a country trio with her
mother and sister, and Lesh is the
son of Grateful Dead electric bass
player I'liil Lesh I csh and Lngreitz

also play in the band Crystal City
with former Dirty Blonde member
Will Agee.
According to Jenkins, Vice has
benefited from Stanford's support of
the arts.
"I was worried I was going to
have to play manager, but all of our
gigs si) far have come to us," she said.
Recent Vice shows include ap
pearances at Full Moon on the
Quad.Moonsplash and Battle of the
Bands.Their first gig was before they
had composed any original work as a
group.
Vice has a loyal fan base already,
made up primarily of the band mem
bers' friends.
"[Vice] is great, definitely," said
sophomore Dciamon Rego.whowas
in Lesh's freshman dorm. Rego
came for the beginning of the set.
"They're actually one of the best

bands I've heard on campus," said
sophomore Thomas I ,ew. who is also
a friend of the band.
A handful of additional pedestri
ans and bicyclists watched the show.
Many stopped and held their bikes
while the band finished a song.
Peter Lindenek, who said he has
been informally affiliated with Stan
ford for twenty years, mouthed the
lyrics to the songs and bent his head
in time to the beat as he watched the
show. He had been passing through
White Plaza but was "pulled in" by
the music.
"When 1 hear this kind of thing I
get excited about the musical possi
bilities [at Stanford]," he said.
According to Jenkins, the band is
a state of mind.
"It's the whole sex,drugs and rock
T.' roll thing,"she said."We love what
it represents. It's all about vice."
