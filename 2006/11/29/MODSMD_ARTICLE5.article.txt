## Vice rocks White Plaza with eclectic playlist 
### LIA HARDIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The new, talent-packed, all
sophomore rock quintet Vice
shook the birdcage in White Plaza
yesterday, spending the ninety
sixth hour before Big Game pro
ducing an unapologetically eclec
tic rock 'n' roll set with enough en
ergy to stop a few bicyclists in their
tracks.
Vice was the featured artist for
Big Game Week's Sophomore
Day. The band performed to the
cheers of fans, friends of the band
and passers-by drawn in by the
music while Gaieties tickets and
Big Game merchandise were sold
nearby. The group's eighties rock
and modern pop-rock covers were
punctuated with four original
songs, which were recently added
to its repertoire.
The band's original work tack
led a diverse set of musical genres:

"A World Away" was funky. "No
Mercy" was bluesy and "Real
Love" was about, well, real love.
"Forgive Me, Father" was the
fourth original.
"We like rock that's raunchy,
fun and playful," said lead singer
Brodie Jenkins, who said she was
thrilled to play for Hig Game
Week. "It's about getting people
revved up and crazy. White Plaza is
the central area of campus â€” I like
the fact that it's not a static audi
ence."
Vice's set began right after the
Axe Committee blew the train
whistle at noon.
Aside from Jenkins, Vice is
comprised of Jesse Engreitz on
keyboard, Grahame Lesh on gui
tar. Mac Parish on bass and Eric
Saar on drums. Last year, Engreitz,
Lesh, Parish and Saar were mem
bers of Dirty Blonde, a group that
