## BUSH STAYS THE COURSE DISMISSES "CIVIL WAR" CALLS 
### TOM RAUM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
RIGA. Latvia - Under intense pressure tochangecourse.
President Bush on Tuesday rejected suggestions Iraq has
fallen into civil war and vowed not to pull U.S. troops out
"until the mission is complete."
At the opening of a NATO summit. Bush also urged al
lies to increase their forces in Afghanistan to confront a
strengthening Taliban insurgency.
On the eve of his visit to Jordan for meetings with Iraqi
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Bush portrayed the battles
in both Afghanistan and Iraq as central fronts in a war
"against the extremists who desire safe havens and are will
ing to kill innocents anywhere to achieve their objectives."
The stakes in Iraq are huge for Bush. I lis war policies were
repudiated in U.S. midterm elections that handed control of
Congress to Democrats. A bipartisan blue-ribbon panel is
about to issue a report proposing changes in the administra
tion's approach in Iraq. And al-Maliki's government itself
sometimes seems to be at cross purposes with Washington.
Bush set the stage for the Jordan talks with a speech at
the NATO summit here and at an earlier news conference in
neighboring Estonia.The president said he was flexible and
eager to hear al-Maliki's ideas on how to ease the violence.
" Ihere's one thing I'm not going to do, I'm not going to
pull our troops oil the battlefield before the mission is com
plete." Bush declared in his speech/There are about 140,000
U.S. forces in Iraq.
Earlier, speaking with reporters in Tallinn during a joint
news conference with Estonia's president. Bush would not
debate whether Iraq had fallen into civil war and blamed the
increasing bloodshed on a pattern of sectarian violence that
he said was set in motion last winter by al-Qaida followers.
"I'm going to bring this subject up, of course, with Prime
Minister Maliki." Bush said. "My questions to him will be:
What do you need to do to succeed? What is your strategy in
dealing with the sectarian violence?"
Bush said he realized that "no question it's dangerous
there, and violent. And the Maliki government is going to
have to deal with that violence, and we want to help them do
so."
Bush has been coming under increasing pressure, both
overseas and at home, to reach out more to other countries,
particularly to Syria and Iran to help with a solution in Iraq.
Such a recommendation may be among those issued bv

the Iraq Study Group headed by former Secretary of State
James A. Baker 111 and former Democratic Rep. Lee Hamil
ton. The group is expected to finish its work next month.
Bush has resisted such talks, and he renewed a warning
on Tuesday to both Iran and Syria not to meddle in Iraq.

"A coordinated effort
between the Iraqi government and
allied forces... has not
produced satisfactory progress..."

Still, al-Maliki's government itself Ikis made overtures to
both countries.
"As far as Iraq goes, the Iraqi government is a sovereign
government capable of handling its own foreign policies and
is in the process of doing so." Bush said in Tallinn.
Later. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen Hadley.
said that Bush and al-Maliki have "a relationship of candor."
"A lot of discussion has been about (Bush) pushing Ma
liki. Maliki lias done a lot of pushing himself," I ladley said.
"There has been a coordinated effort between the Iraqi gov
ernment and allied forces to get greater control.... It has not
produced satisfactory progress in a satisfactory timeframe."
Meanwhile, in Washington. House Speaker-to-be Nancy
Pelosi said Hush must work with Democrats on stopping the
violence in Iraq.
"We want to work in a bipartisan way to settle this,"
Pelosi said. "If the president persists on the course that he is
on. that will be more difficult."
In Riga, Hush pressed many of the 26 NATO allies to do
more to marshal resources and troops in Afghanistan, par
ticularly in the volatile south.
Bush said the Afghanistan mission — which has mobi
lized over 32,000 troops — is NATO's top operation and de
feating Taliban forces "will require the full commitment of
our alliance."
"The commanders on the ground must have the re
sources and flexibility they need to do their jobs." he said.
Bush met individually with NATO Secretary-General
Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and joined other leaders in attending
a working dinner.
I ladley. Bush's national security adviser, said that Bush
brought up a need for "additional defense capabilities and
additional defense spending" in the meeting with the secre
tary-general and also intended to discuss it at the dinner.
In both Baltic countries, Bush on Tuesday saluted their
persistence in eventually prevailing over Soviet occupiers,
and he said it was a good example for both Afghanistan and
Iraq.

Mayor
visits
family
Bloomberg meets with
family of groom slain
in police shooting
By TOM HAYS
ASSOCIATED PRESS
NLW YORK — Mayor Michael
Bloomberg met Tuesday with the
family of the man who was killed on
his wedding day in a barrage of po
lice gunfire as he left his bachelor
party, and investigators questioned a
third civilian witness.
Three days after the fatal en
counter, it remained unclear why
four detectives and one police officer
opened lire while conducting an un
dercover operation at a strip club.
ITie unidentified witness was on a
darkened block in Queens when five
police officers killed 23-year-old
Sean Bell and injured two friends as
the three sat inside a car, officials
said.
There are two other civilian wit
nesses: One woman on the street
who says she saw officers firing
their weapons, and a second woman
who from her window spotted a
man running away from the area
around the time of the shooting. In
vestigators tried to determine if
that man had been with the three
who were shot.
On TUesday, Bloomberg went to
the Hell family's Queens church,
where he met for about an hour with
the parents and fiance of the victim,
along with the Rev. Al Sharpton.The
mayor then met at a restaurant with
about 50 community leaders.
The mayor held a similar meeting
Monday at City 1 (all in which he de
clared that officers appeared to use
"excessive force" when Bell was
killed hours before his wedding. He
stood by his comments Tuesday.
"I am a civilian. I am not a profes
sional law enforcement officer"he
said. "I used the word excessive and
that's fine. That was my personal
opinion. It may turn out to be that it
was not excessive."
Some have questioned whether
the shooting was racially motivated
because the victims were all black
men.The five officers who fired their
guns included two blacks, two whites
and one Hispanic.
Councilman James Sanders Jr. of
Queens said he warned Bloomberg
about possible unrest.
"I alerted the mayor that the tem
perature on the streets has increased
to a large degree " he said. "While we
are sitting in these meetings, a lot of
people are out on the streets."
Police Commissioner Raymond
Kelly said some tension was in
evitable because of "the nature of
what police departments do — we
arrest people, we give them sum
monses, we're the bearers of bad
news, we use force and sometimes we
use deadly force."
Police investigators have not in
terviewed the officers because of a
district attorney probe that could re
sult in criminal charges, nor have the
officers spoken publicly. An attorney
for the detectives' union. Philip
Karasyk, has called the incident "a
tragedy, but not a crime."
Union officials familiar with the
officers' account say at least one un
dercover detective was convinced
there was a gun in the car. They also
allege that Bell defied orders to stop
and used the vehicle as a weapon,
bumping the undercover detective
and ramming an unmarked police
van.
"They are genuinely concerned
and very sympathetic toward the
three men who were shot," said
Michael Palladino, president of the
Detectives' Endowment Associa
tion. "However, they are anxious to
speak to the district attorney in
Queens and tell their side of the
story."'
The gunfire early Saturday
stemmed from an undercover opera
tion inside the Kalua Cabaret, where
seven officers in plain clothes were
investigating alleged prostitution
and drug use.
Kelly has said Bell was involved in an
argument outside the club after 4
a.m., and one of his friends made a
