Dear members and friends of the
Stanford and UC Berkeley Communities:
On December 2, Cal and Stanford will square off in the 109 th
Big Gameâ€”a Pac-10 tradition. This year's game will be played at
Memorial Stadium in Berkeley.
Our two universities share a strong football and academic
heritage, as well as a spirited and storied rivalry. It is important that
we reinforce the traditional goals of this annual event: a lively competition
on the field and an enjoyable experience in the stands.
Unfortunately, in past years, the spirit of this and other
highly-anticipated games has been dampened by the behavior of a few
people who engage in fighting and mean-spirited "pranks" or damage
property. Those who do so can be ejected from the stadium or arrested.
Please do not engage in activities that may draw law
enforcement and security personnel and resources away from more pressing
matters, and please discourage such behavior among others.
Let's do all we can to ensure that this chapter in our
treasured Pac-10 tradition is a safe, positive experience for everyone there.
Enjoy the game!
Sincerely,
John L. Hennessy Robert J7 Birgertteau
President Chancellor
Stanford University University of California, Berkeley
