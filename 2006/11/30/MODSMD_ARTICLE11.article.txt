YAK!MA. Wash. — Eleven sites,in
cluding south-central Washington's
Hanford nuclear reservation, have
been selected as possible places to
reprocess spent nuclear fuel from re
actors, the Department of Energy
announced Wednesday.
The program is part of the Energy
Department's Global Nuclear Ener
gy Partnership, or GNEP. which the
Bush administration has been tout
ing as a means to safely expand nu
clear energy.
The 11 sites will share as much as
$16 million in grants next year to
begin site studies to house cither a re
cycling center that would separate
spent fuel for reuse, a fast reactor that
could convert highly radioactive ma
terials to shorter-lived isotopes while
burning them for power, or both.
Proponents say the program will
allow countries to increasingly rely

on nuclear energy while reducing the
amount of waste generated by nu
clear power plants.
"As our economy grows, so will
the need for reliable, emissions-free
energy generation. Nuclear energy
can help meet that need and GNEP
can do it in a way that maximizes the
benefit of nuclear fuel while mini
mizing the risk of nuclear prolifera
tion," Dennis Spurgeon. DOE assis
tant secretary for nuclear energy,
said in a statement.
Critics of the initiative have ar
gued that resuming reprocessing —
abandoned in the 1970s for prolifer
ation reasons — could make it easier
for terrorists or enemy states to ob
tain plutonium for nuclear weapons.
The Union of Concerned Scien
tists condemned Wednesday's an
nouncement. saying the plan poses
serious health, safety and environ
mental risks in communities where
the plants would be located.
"People living near these pro
posed new nuclear sites should have
the right to know the truth and have
a say about the massive dangers that
some of their neighbors and elected
officials want to bring into their corn-

Sites in Washington. Idaho. South

submitted letters of support for
GNEP activities to come to their

Initiative 297 in 2004.The initiative,
barring the federal government from
shipping more waste to Hanford
until all existing waste there is
cleaned up, was overwhelmingly ap
proved by Washington voters except
in Benton and Franklin counties,
near the Hanford site.

A federal judge struck down the
initiative as unconstitutional in June.
The state has appealed.
Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire
said her highest priority at Hanford
continues to be cleanup.
"I'm not surprised Hanford made
it through the initial review given the
high quality of personnel," she said.

ment of Energy proceeds. This is an
other step in the process."
Deanna Smith, director of public
affairs for theTri-City Development
Council, which sponsored one of the
two Hanford proposals that have
now been consolidated, said the ini
tial study will simply determine it
Hanford's existing facilities and
technology are feasible for the pro
gram.
"If my memory serves me, we
have more spent fuel sitting here

son we can get it sited here and built
here, we would propose to take care
of our own first before taking on any

"People living near these pro
posed new nuclear sites should have
the right to know the truth and have
a say about the massive dangers that
some of their neighbors and elected
officials want to bring into their corn-

As our economy
grows, so will the
need for reliable,
emissions-free
energy generation.

Sites in Washington. Idaho. South
Carolina, New Mexico, Illinois. Ten
nessee, Kentucky and Ohio were se
lected for consideration. Already,
two governors — Gov. Mark San
ford of South Carolina and Gov.

Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky — have
submitted letters of support for
GNEP activities to come to their
states.
In Washington state,critics imme
diately cried foul over the selection
of 1 lanford.The Energy Department
has been working to rid that highly
contaminated site of toxic and ra
dioactive waste left from Cold War
era plutonium production for the na
tion's weapons arsenal.
"They are wasting taxpayer
money pursuing this in Washington
state.The public insists that you clean
up before you create more, and the
state of Washington has the legal au
thority to say you can't add more
waste to Hanford's problems," said
Gerry Pollet, executive director of
the Seattle-based Hanford watchdog
group Heart of America Northwest.
I ieart of America also sponsored
Initiative 297 in 2004.The initiative,
barring the federal government from
shipping more waste to Hanford
until all existing waste there is
cleaned up, was overwhelmingly ap
proved by Washington voters except
in Benton and Franklin counties,
near the Hanford site.

A federal judge struck down the
initiative as unconstitutional in June.
The state has appealed.
Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire
said her highest priority at Hanford
continues to be cleanup.
"I'm not surprised Hanford made
it through the initial review given the
high quality of personnel," she said.
"I'll wait and see how the Depart
ment of Energy proceeds. This is an
other step in the process."
Deanna Smith, director of public
affairs for theTri-City Development
Council, which sponsored one of the
two Hanford proposals that have
now been consolidated, said the ini
tial study will simply determine it
Hanford's existing facilities and
technology are feasible for the pro
gram.
"If my memory serves me, we
have more spent fuel sitting here
than anywhere else. If for some rea
son we can get it sited here and built
here, we would propose to take care
of our own first before taking on any
thing else," Smith said. "But you have
to look at the bigger picture — nu
clear energy is something that every
one is looking at now.
