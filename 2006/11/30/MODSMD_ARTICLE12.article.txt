## Editorial Board This winter, give students a break 
### 
In spite of the University's $04 million In
ternational Initiative and its bloated
rhetoric about tackling global issues.it is
embarrassing that Stanford fails to provide
adequate on-campus housing options over
winter break for undergraduates who des
perately need it.
In recent years, undergraduates have
been kicked out of housing over winter
break, and those who stayed on campus
have had to sleep on mattresses strewn on
the floor of I lammarskjold ("Left out in the
cold at Hammarskjold." Nov. 14). Many of
those affected are international students
who must stay on campus over the break
due to financial and other reasons. Without
dining halls and Marguerite shuttles, these
students have few dining or transportation
options during the festive season.
This is unacceptable. As the Daily article
points out, many of our peer institutions
provide options for international students.
Princeton keeps its dorms open, while 1 lar
vard and Tufts provides a range of alterna
tives for its students. In contrast, Stanford
has been disingenuous in urging these stu
dents to "be creative" in their search for
housing alternatives, while turning a blind
eye to the dreadful situation in Ham
marskjold.
The University needs to do more to
demonstrate its commitment to interna
tional and socioeconomic diversity. It
should simply grant students who need to
stay in their dorms over winter break the
option to do so. Ihis can easily be done
without increasing the heating or security
costs associated with keeping a dorm open.
One option would be to allow anyone
(including incoming freshmen) who needs
to stay over winter break to draw into one
dorm, and keep that one dorm open during
the break. Students can pay a small fee to
cover any of the incidental costs incurred by
this arrangement.
A possible objection to this simple pro
posal is thai less wealthy students and inter
nationals should be scattered all across
campus to provide diversity. But if the Uni
versity is truly committed to socioeconomic
and international diversitv, the administra

tion should come up with a way to support
it.
Up to this point, the administration has
chosen to overlook these problems because
the housing closure over winter break af
fects only a tiny fraction of Stanford under
graduates. Most students can easily afford
the cost of a plane ticket home. Although in
ternational students are disproportionately
burdened by the closure, many can also af
ford to fly home for Christmas. Since Stan
ford provides minimal financial aid for in
ternational students, most are extremely
wealthy.
But for financially disadvantaged inter
national students, going home over the
break is not an option. For them, the cost of
a plane ticket home can be prohibitive. Oth
ers are forced to stay on campus due to visa
issues — if they step outside the United
States, they risk being denied reentry
For the few students who are affected by
the winter closure — both international
and out-of-state students alike — more
housing options are needed. This is not the
first time the Editorial Board has drawn at
tention to this issue — a similar request last
year fell on deaf ears ("Students need hous
ing options during break." Jan. 12). Never
theless. we continue to underscore the im
portance of addressing this issue soon.
We are heartened by the efforts of the
ASSU to help students find housing this
winter. The ASSU has worked tirelessly
with Stanford I lousing, the Alumni Associ
ation and the Bechtel International Center,
researching a broad range of housing alter
natives including alumni housing, graduate
dormitories and the SLAC Guest I louse.
We are grateful that the larger Stanford
community has shown its support for fellow
community members in need, and hope that
more members of the community will ex
tend their help and hospitality. There are
still more students who need a home over
winter break. We invite all Stanford alumni,
faculty members, resident fellows and ad
ministrators willing to host a student for
one to three weeks to contact ASSU Presi
dent Elizabeth lleng at
elizabeth.heng@stanford.edu.
