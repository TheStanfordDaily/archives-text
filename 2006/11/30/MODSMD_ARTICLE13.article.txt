Pcr*pi'ca*cious( adj.) — of acute mental iits
cemment (Webster's Dictionary)
As I sat mulling over the meaning of
the word "perspicacious" in my
ORE preparation book, I realized it
had a much greater significance. GRE
stands for Graduate Record Examination
— for most applicants to graduate school,
this is their version of the SAT. Apparently,
familiarity with the definition of "perspica
cious" is a measure of how well you might
do in graduate school. You can imagine my
surprise when two of my professors, who
had both attended prestigious graduate
programs and were now well-respected
scholars.could not define the word. I low did
they get into graduate school?
Both the SATs and the GREs, as well as
other standardized tests, are administered
by the non-profit Education Testing Ser
vices (ETS). According to their Web sites,
the SAT is apparently "a measure of the
critical thinking skills you'll need for aca
demic success in college," while the GRE
"providefs] common measures for compar
ing the qualifications of applicants and aid
in evaluating grades and recommenda
tions." And how does the word "perspica
cious" fit into all of this?

These tests contain writing, verbal and
math questions. But if you want to be an
English major in college, who cares if you
can find standard deviations? Four years
later, that same English major, who then de
cides she wants to go to graduate school, has
to take yet another test that measures her
ability to solve for x and find interest rates.
What does any of this have to do with a
Ph.D. in English?
Our English major will then be asked to
write two essays in a little over an hour in
order to test her critical thinking and writing
skills. Funny enough, she has already sub
mitted a 35-page writing sample about
Shakespeare with her application. What
does a quickly-written essay for or against
the almost absurdly philosophical and dra
matic statement,"The past is no predictor of
