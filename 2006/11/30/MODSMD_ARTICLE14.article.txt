(German) Das Heft in der Hand haben.
(English) To have power or control.
The literal translation of this German
idiom could be either "to have the
notebook in hand," or "to have the
sword's hilt in hand." While the quote origi
nally designated the latter, that meaning of
"das Heft" has mostly fallen out of use in
German (something about swords not
being used on a regular basis anymore).
The idiom could be considered compara
ble to "The pen is mightier than the sword."
Having a notebook, a place where you set
your words down, can define someone as
having power. ITiat itself is a powerful
image,and one that gives me a bit of faith in
humanity: We recognize the power of lan
guage. On the other hand, it rather scares
me. I mean, when you have the power to
move other people, what do you do with it?
I have no idea to what length I would trust
myself to lead a willing audience.

Oh. right, in theory I have an audience
with this column. Hmm. But I barely have
any idea what I do with these columns. Ap
parently I've succeeded in upsetting a cou
ple of people, but I don't know if I have ac
tually accomplished anything, or even what
I hope to accomplish. I want to make people
think.That's just something I enjoy doing in
general, whether by walking through my
high schoohit's much harder to shock peo
ple around here than it was back then) or by
playing devil's advocate.
