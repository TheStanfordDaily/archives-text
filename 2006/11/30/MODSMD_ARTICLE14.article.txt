(German) Das Heft in der Hand haben.
(English) To have power or control.
The literal translation of this German
idiom could be either "to have the
notebook in hand," or "to have the
sword's hilt in hand." While the quote origi
nally designated the latter, that meaning of
"das Heft" has mostly fallen out of use in
German (something about swords not
being used on a regular basis anymore).
The idiom could be considered compara
ble to "The pen is mightier than the sword."
Having a notebook, a place where you set
your words down, can define someone as
having power. ITiat itself is a powerful
image,and one that gives me a bit of faith in
humanity: We recognize the power of lan
guage. On the other hand, it rather scares
me. I mean, when you have the power to
move other people, what do you do with it?
I have no idea to what length I would trust
myself to lead a willing audience.

Oh. right, in theory I have an audience
with this column. Hmm. But I barely have
any idea what I do with these columns. Ap
parently I've succeeded in upsetting a cou
ple of people, but I don't know if I have ac
tually accomplished anything, or even what
I hope to accomplish. I want to make people
think.That's just something I enjoy doing in
general, whether by walking through my
high schoohit's much harder to shock peo
ple around here than it was back then) or by
playing devil's advocate.

Trying to make people think is
one thing. Trying to shape their
thinking toward some end? I don't
trust myself to do that. 1 don't trust
anyone to do that. No matter how
old. wise or set in their ways people
are. I don't trust them to tell me what
1 should think.
And that's what I think the prob
lem is: People often state things hop
ing to convince their audience of the
superiority of their kernels of wis
dom. Once people think they have
everything figured out. they try to go
help other people figure things out
"the easy way, so you don't have to
suffer through the same things 1 did."
Yes, please, offer me your experi
ences, and I will listen eagerly to your
opinions. But don't think for a mo
ment that 1 will accept unquestion
ingly your worldview as my own. and
suddenly reshape my life according
ly*
That doesn't mean 1 don't value
others' opinions. 1 just don't think

anyone — or anything — should be
trusted so blindly. This is why the
"science vs. religion" debate often
makes me laugh — oftentimes, fol
lowers of both blindly trust what
they hear from the champions of
their side, refusing to consider new
arguments. It's like two sumo
wrestlers put into a boxing ring, and
they both sit in the corners with their
eyes closed and their hands over
their ears saying "lalalala." They re
fuse to acknowledge the other's right
to even be in the ring, convinced they
should automatically be declared
champion based on the fact that
they've won against every previous
opponent. Nobody accomplishes or
learns anything.
Because it seems like the stakes
of expressing an argument are so
high — people will either blindly
accept or completely disregard
what they hear — new voices are
frequently worried about putting
their own words into the ring. I am
reminded of a night several weeks
ago when someone in my house
was asked: "If you had five min
utes on television, and you could
be guaranteed that everyone in
the country would see it. what

would you say?"
"I would get somebody older and
wiser than me to say something. I'm
too young. I wouldn't trust myself,'
she responded. I've thought about
her comment a lot since then. At the
time, her answer seemed like the wis
est that could have been given. If you
had the ear of the entire country, if
only for five minutes, it would feel
like a lot of responsibility. What
would you want to say? Will you
spread hope? Give a message? A
challenge? A directive? Just chat
about yourself?
But despite these uncertainties,
after some thought. I am inclined to
disagree with her answer. What you
do with your airtime isn't, in the end,
what matters. What matters is that
you do try to put yourself out there
— not to change anyone else, but to
elicit responses and inform your own
opinions. Because when everyone
has a notebook in hand, thinking and
speaking for themselves, it's no
longer scary that other people will
listen. It's heartening.

they hear from the champions of
their side, refusing to consider new
arguments. It's like two sumo
wrestlers put into a boxing ring, and
they both sit in the corners with their
eyes closed and their hands over
their ears saying "lalalala." They re
fuse to acknowledge the other's right
to even be in the ring, convinced they
should automatically be declared
champion based on the fact that
they've won against every previous
opponent. Nobody accomplishes or
learns anything.
Because it seems like the stakes
of expressing an argument are so
high — people will either blindly
accept or completely disregard
what they hear — new voices are
frequently worried about putting
their own words into the ring. I am
reminded of a night several weeks
ago when someone in my house
was asked: "If you had five min
utes on television, and you could
be guaranteed that everyone in
the country would see it. what

would you say?"
"I would get somebody older and
wiser than me to say something. I'm
too young. I wouldn't trust myself,'
she responded. I've thought about
her comment a lot since then. At the
time, her answer seemed like the wis
est that could have been given. If you
had the ear of the entire country, if
only for five minutes, it would feel
like a lot of responsibility. What
would you want to say? Will you
spread hope? Give a message? A
challenge? A directive? Just chat
about yourself?
But despite these uncertainties,
after some thought. I am inclined to
disagree with her answer. What you
do with your airtime isn't, in the end,
what matters. What matters is that
you do try to put yourself out there
— not to change anyone else, but to
elicit responses and inform your own
opinions. Because when everyone
has a notebook in hand, thinking and
speaking for themselves, it's no
longer scary that other people will
listen. It's heartening.
