# Castro's B-Day Bash...
## Chicken Kiev, Thanksgiving American 
### Paul Craft 
You guys, I have an embarrassing ad
mission to make: I'm not seven years
old and this isn't Space Camp, but I'm
homesick. Way homesick.
Over the past few weeks the only things
holding me together have been pride and the
reckless improbable dream of once again
knowing the bliss of a really good pork mole
taco. I live four Metro stops away from the
Kremlin, but my primary joy in life is hour
long chats with my devastatingly charming
editor Vicky, discussing botched punctua
tion, regrettable drunken emails and
whether Juan from Tresidder Express really
misses me. We think he does.
As you can imagine, then, I viewed the ap
proaching Thanksgiving holiday with mixed
emotions: It was going to be my first time
spending it away from my tight-knit family,
but tin the other hand, maybe it could be an
adventure.
A couple of other people in the program
evidently felt the same way. Six of us decided

to go out to Kiev over the four-day weekend,
and found a large apartment with a fully
loaded kitchen. Gradually excitement over
took the throb of nostalgia, and we giddily
mapped out a traditional meal: rolls, a bird,
mashed potatoes, possibly even pumpkin
coaxed into the form of a pie. Let the kids
going to Prague spend their Thanksgiving
Day wolfing down crepes and absinthe â€” 1
was going to have cranberry sauce, by gum!
As we divvied up cooking assignments
and made alternate plans in case ingredients
were unavailable, 1 fleetingly fantasized that

we could all cook something from our cul
ture. A bowl of borscht. tamales, corn on the
cob. Looking proudly on my British-Jewish
background. 1 offered to boil some cabbage
for 12 or 13 hours then order Chinese food.
I Deep in my soppy. 1 lallmark heart, 1 honest
ly dreamed that we would spend the evening in
our rented living room singing folk songs and
holding hands in a circle like a kindergarten di
versity poster. America may be an ocean away. 1
figured, but we can have our own cultural melt
ing pot right in the heart of the former USSR.
Thursday evening, as we stood in a line at the
counter dicing vegetables and belting out Dis
ney songs at the tops of our lungs. 1 thought for a
brief moment that we had actually pulled it oft.
Everyone simultaneously got in each other's
way and the floor looked like a Jackson Pollack
study in potato peels; the symphonic smells ol
simmering apples and frying chicken were ac
companied by the pop-pop-pop of my long-
