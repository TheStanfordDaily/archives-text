# Castro's B-Day Bash...
## Chicken Kiev, Thanksgiving American 
### Paul Craft 
You guys, I have an embarrassing ad
mission to make: I'm not seven years
old and this isn't Space Camp, but I'm
homesick. Way homesick.
Over the past few weeks the only things
holding me together have been pride and the
reckless improbable dream of once again
knowing the bliss of a really good pork mole
taco. I live four Metro stops away from the
Kremlin, but my primary joy in life is hour
long chats with my devastatingly charming
editor Vicky, discussing botched punctua
tion, regrettable drunken emails and
whether Juan from Tresidder Express really
misses me. We think he does.
As you can imagine, then, I viewed the ap
proaching Thanksgiving holiday with mixed
emotions: It was going to be my first time
spending it away from my tight-knit family,
but tin the other hand, maybe it could be an
adventure.
A couple of other people in the program
evidently felt the same way. Six of us decided

to go out to Kiev over the four-day weekend,
and found a large apartment with a fully
loaded kitchen. Gradually excitement over
took the throb of nostalgia, and we giddily
mapped out a traditional meal: rolls, a bird,
mashed potatoes, possibly even pumpkin
coaxed into the form of a pie. Let the kids
going to Prague spend their Thanksgiving
Day wolfing down crepes and absinthe — 1
was going to have cranberry sauce, by gum!
As we divvied up cooking assignments
and made alternate plans in case ingredients
were unavailable, 1 fleetingly fantasized that

we could all cook something from our cul
ture. A bowl of borscht. tamales, corn on the
cob. Looking proudly on my British-Jewish
background. 1 offered to boil some cabbage
for 12 or 13 hours then order Chinese food.
I Deep in my soppy. 1 lallmark heart, 1 honest
ly dreamed that we would spend the evening in
our rented living room singing folk songs and
holding hands in a circle like a kindergarten di
versity poster. America may be an ocean away. 1
figured, but we can have our own cultural melt
ing pot right in the heart of the former USSR.
Thursday evening, as we stood in a line at the
counter dicing vegetables and belting out Dis
ney songs at the tops of our lungs. 1 thought for a
brief moment that we had actually pulled it oft.
Everyone simultaneously got in each other's
way and the floor looked like a Jackson Pollack
study in potato peels; the symphonic smells ol
simmering apples and frying chicken were ac
companied by the pop-pop-pop of my long-



Lewin
Out and Aboutski
awaited cranberry sauce. The warmth I
felt wasn't just the glow of the portable
stove.
And then we sat down.
We drank red wine out of a
stranger's chipped coffee mugs; the
chicken fillets were a gelatinous
swamp of blood and cartilage; two
people stormed away from the table
in tears. Ib all appearances it was ex
actly like an authentic Lewin family
Thanksgiving and yet. something
was missing.
Mock-complaining as we sloshed
soapy water over the innumerable
dirty dishes. I felt the slightest lump
in my throat. My hopes were just too
high. Injecting magic into a holiday
isn't as cas\ as cramming stuffing
into a turkey. the most mind-blowing
of cranberry sauces isn't as heart
warming as hearing my father reas
sure my mom that.no.he likes his po
tatoes extra-extra chewy. The six of
us had a great meal with wonderful
conversation in a truly gorgeous city.

hut it was just a'lliursday after all.
Oh well. I told myself, it's just a
made-up holiday anyway, right?
Apparently not. 1 loliday pressure
relieved, we spent the next two days
taking long, rambling walks through
monasteries and museums, enjoying
I kraine's temperate climate and
friendly people. Our last day, hone
tired and hungry like the proverbial
wolf, we saw a familiar red-and
white awning and gave out hoots of
joy: r.G.I. Friday's! In Ukraine!
Ciiory be, and a side of fries for all.
And that's when, tricky devil that
it is. m\ delinquent Thanksgiving fi
nally came.
The fare was not standard —
mozzarella sticks and a dripping,
overly rare barbeque burger (appar
ently undercooked meat is a univer
sal holiday indicator, and not just a
family tradition) — but the feeling it
struck in me was like meeting a
brother again. Surrounded by Amer
ican tourists, we sat eating for over
two hours, sometimes all talking a
mile a minute, strands of conversa
tion overlapping and interweaving
with one another into a brilliant non
sensical tapestry. At other moments
we iList sat. lulled into spontaneous

silence by digestion and complete
comfort,
I'm not sure whether it wits the reas
suring gaudiness of a real slice of Amer
icana or the relaxation of my holiday
expectations, but when we sat waiting
for the check, lapsed into a blissful food
coma. I looked around that table and
saw something like a family.
Admittedly we don't have the 20
years of emotional baggage and un
conditional love that come part and
parcel with my childhood home, but
over the past two months we have
made jokes and built connections. I
genuinely care about these people: 1
support them and have every faith
that they would support me. Like a
real family, we didn't exactly choose
each other in the first place — fate
threw us together and then we made
a good thing out of it. And that's
what families do.
That, and they eat together.

You guys, I have an embarrassing ad
mission to make: I'm not seven years
old and this isn't Space Camp, but I'm
homesick. Way homesick.
Over the past few weeks the only things
holding me together have been pride and the
reckless improbable dream of once again
knowing the bliss of a really good pork mole
taco. I live four Metro stops away from the
Kremlin, but my primary joy in life is hour
long chats with my devastatingly charming
editor Vicky, discussing botched punctua
tion, regrettable drunken emails and
whether Juan from Tresidder Express really
misses me. We think he does.
As you can imagine, then, I viewed the ap
proaching Thanksgiving holiday with mixed
emotions: It was going to be my first time
spending it away from my tight-knit family,
but tin the other hand, maybe it could be an
adventure.
A couple of other people in the program
evidently felt the same way. Six of us decided

to go out to Kiev over the four-day weekend,
and found a large apartment with a fully
loaded kitchen. Gradually excitement over
took the throb of nostalgia, and we giddily
mapped out a traditional meal: rolls, a bird,
mashed potatoes, possibly even pumpkin
coaxed into the form of a pie. Let the kids
going to Prague spend their Thanksgiving
Day wolfing down crepes and absinthe — 1
was going to have cranberry sauce, by gum!
As we divvied up cooking assignments
and made alternate plans in case ingredients
were unavailable, 1 fleetingly fantasized that

we could all cook something from our cul
ture. A bowl of borscht. tamales, corn on the
cob. Looking proudly on my British-Jewish
background. 1 offered to boil some cabbage
for 12 or 13 hours then order Chinese food.
I Deep in my soppy. 1 lallmark heart, 1 honest
ly dreamed that we would spend the evening in
our rented living room singing folk songs and
holding hands in a circle like a kindergarten di
versity poster. America may be an ocean away. 1
figured, but we can have our own cultural melt
ing pot right in the heart of the former USSR.
