Go to Big Game
lliis is a call to arms. We here at the Stanford
Band have been in stealth mode for much of
the quarter, but we'd like to speak to you today
with the greatest enthusiasm and honesty. Our
apparent absence has all been part of our mas
ter plan. We hoped to lull the enemies of humor
and fun into a false sense of security, but lo!
Now our grandiose plan is to he unfurled: Just
when the Weenies think we have been defeat
ed, just when they think the Cardinal fans have
grown silent and apathetic, just when Oski was
about to stuff his face with another donut â€” we
strike. A musical assault for all history and time
will occur on Saturday. The Band will invade
the Big Game, equipped with a full comple
ment of dollies and a mighty Tree. Though the
powers-that-be deem our field shows to be too
lethal a weapon against Cal. we're still going to
bring the funk. I lard.
But we hope not to be alone in the sea of
overzealous crazed Weenie fans. We need
your help. For many of us, this is our last Big
Game. But you may be saying to your your
selves: "Why, why would I want to join this
suicidal assault on a stadium stacked with
chagrined UC scoundrels? I have an lIIIJM
paper to do." No, you don't. Here is our
promise to you, the student body: we will do
all of your I HUM papers and problem sets if
you go to Big Game and be generally rowdy.
Not "Jump during 'All Right Now' and sit
down" rowdy. We mean shouting, creative
and psychotic cheers, standing on your seat,
paint-your-face-with-goats-blood rowdy. The
Band, after playing at Big Game and a week's
worth of rallies will sit down and write your
papers. We've checked with the dean of stu
dents. this is completely kosher with the
honor code.

So join our ranks this Saturday. Ik- there
as we witness the greatest thing ever and we
take back what is ours. The Band knows our
football team has a better game plan than our
own to win the day; they only ask your help in
bringing the funk.To arms and Go Cardinal!
THE BAND
Thank you for your support
Stanford students
Dear Stanford students. 1 should have writ
ten this note a long time ago; moreover, this
should have been a personal letter to each and
every one of you. so please regard this as such.
I waited a while before writing this because I
wanted my anger to subside so I would be able
to formulate my thoughts constructively. I
wanted to thank you all for your amazing sup
port and trust during the difficult time after my
tenure denial. It is your support, your letters,
emails and visits to my office that made me re
alize that my time here at Stanford was not a
total waste. I have touched the lives of many
students and this is a great achievement; I
would not have done any thing differently. I re
alize that this tenure decision has made many
of you wonder about your own career path.
Specifically, several of you indicated that you
are no longer certain that you want to pursue
an academic career at a high profile institute
like Stanford. I ask you to please not be discour
aged: do not give up on your dreams. I am cer
tainly not planning on doing so. I will continue
to be a first-rate scientist, innovative educator
and mentor at Stanford or elsewhere. It may be
a long ways away before the academic work
place will encourage and foster collaborative,
collegial and supportive conduct rather than
self-promotion and ruthless competition and

there may be more "casualties" along the way.
I lowever, we should continue to pursue our
dreams and maintain our values and ethics in
order to change the system. So please follow
your dreams, become productive scientists, in
fluential educators and most important kind
and compassionate people and I am sure in the
long run things will change.

Teach For America provides good
solution to education problem
Atter reading 'ITie Daily's article about
leach For America and the School of Educa
tion's STEP program ("Teach for America
comes under fire," Nov. 28), we felt com
pelled to share our perspectives as Teach For
America alumni and current members ot the
Stanford community
First, we do agree that Stanford's STEP
program is outstanding. Both of us are in the
joint MBA / Masters of Education program,
which means that we have worked with many
different faculty members and graduate stu
dents at the School of Education.The people
we have worked with are outstanding, and
though we have not taken classes directly in
the S1 EP program, we are confident that the
same level of professionalism and quality ex
ists in that program.
I lowever. the sad reality is that most stu
dents in the United States do not have the op
portunity to choose teachers from the STEP
program. The fact is that there are not enough
high quality teachers in the U.S. from programs
like STEP to serve students, and especially
