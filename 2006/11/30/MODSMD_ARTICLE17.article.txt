Go to Big Game
lliis is a call to arms. We here at the Stanford
Band have been in stealth mode for much of
the quarter, but we'd like to speak to you today
with the greatest enthusiasm and honesty. Our
apparent absence has all been part of our mas
ter plan. We hoped to lull the enemies of humor
and fun into a false sense of security, but lo!
Now our grandiose plan is to he unfurled: Just
when the Weenies think we have been defeat
ed, just when they think the Cardinal fans have
grown silent and apathetic, just when Oski was
about to stuff his face with another donut — we
strike. A musical assault for all history and time
will occur on Saturday. The Band will invade
the Big Game, equipped with a full comple
ment of dollies and a mighty Tree. Though the
powers-that-be deem our field shows to be too
lethal a weapon against Cal. we're still going to
bring the funk. I lard.
But we hope not to be alone in the sea of
overzealous crazed Weenie fans. We need
your help. For many of us, this is our last Big
Game. But you may be saying to your your
selves: "Why, why would I want to join this
suicidal assault on a stadium stacked with
chagrined UC scoundrels? I have an lIIIJM
paper to do." No, you don't. Here is our
promise to you, the student body: we will do
all of your I HUM papers and problem sets if
you go to Big Game and be generally rowdy.
Not "Jump during 'All Right Now' and sit
down" rowdy. We mean shouting, creative
and psychotic cheers, standing on your seat,
paint-your-face-with-goats-blood rowdy. The
Band, after playing at Big Game and a week's
worth of rallies will sit down and write your
papers. We've checked with the dean of stu
dents. this is completely kosher with the
honor code.

So join our ranks this Saturday. Ik- there
as we witness the greatest thing ever and we
take back what is ours. The Band knows our
football team has a better game plan than our
own to win the day; they only ask your help in
bringing the funk.To arms and Go Cardinal!
THE BAND
Thank you for your support
Stanford students
Dear Stanford students. 1 should have writ
ten this note a long time ago; moreover, this
should have been a personal letter to each and
every one of you. so please regard this as such.
I waited a while before writing this because I
wanted my anger to subside so I would be able
to formulate my thoughts constructively. I
wanted to thank you all for your amazing sup
port and trust during the difficult time after my
tenure denial. It is your support, your letters,
emails and visits to my office that made me re
alize that my time here at Stanford was not a
total waste. I have touched the lives of many
students and this is a great achievement; I
would not have done any thing differently. I re
alize that this tenure decision has made many
of you wonder about your own career path.
Specifically, several of you indicated that you
are no longer certain that you want to pursue
an academic career at a high profile institute
like Stanford. I ask you to please not be discour
aged: do not give up on your dreams. I am cer
tainly not planning on doing so. I will continue
to be a first-rate scientist, innovative educator
and mentor at Stanford or elsewhere. It may be
a long ways away before the academic work
place will encourage and foster collaborative,
collegial and supportive conduct rather than
self-promotion and ruthless competition and

there may be more "casualties" along the way.
I lowever, we should continue to pursue our
dreams and maintain our values and ethics in
order to change the system. So please follow
your dreams, become productive scientists, in
fluential educators and most important kind
and compassionate people and I am sure in the
long run things will change.

Teach For America provides good
solution to education problem
Atter reading 'ITie Daily's article about
leach For America and the School of Educa
tion's STEP program ("Teach for America
comes under fire," Nov. 28), we felt com
pelled to share our perspectives as Teach For
America alumni and current members ot the
Stanford community
First, we do agree that Stanford's STEP
program is outstanding. Both of us are in the
joint MBA / Masters of Education program,
which means that we have worked with many
different faculty members and graduate stu
dents at the School of Education.The people
we have worked with are outstanding, and
though we have not taken classes directly in
the S1 EP program, we are confident that the
same level of professionalism and quality ex
ists in that program.
I lowever. the sad reality is that most stu
dents in the United States do not have the op
portunity to choose teachers from the STEP
program. The fact is that there are not enough
high quality teachers in the U.S. from programs
like STEP to serve students, and especially
those students in low income urban
and rural school districts. I lie students
and principals in these schools do not
have the option to select a teacher from
top education programs to fill their po
sitions; if they did not have a teacher
from Teach For America to fill that
role, the options would be an uncerti
fied permanent substitute or no
teacher at all. We have seen this from
experience. When 1 (Kermit) took over
my physics class in St. Louis, the school
had not been able to find a teacher
qualified in that subject,so the students
had literally been sitting in the room
with a study hall every day for the first
two weeks while a substitute fell asleep
at the front of the room.
Given this reality,something must
be done. It is not enough to just say,
"We should have more certified
teachers from top education pro
grams." The fact is that we don't. So
what can we do? We can either leave
those students without teachers, or

we can scour the country to find the
most talented recent college gradu
ates to join the ranks of teachers hav
ing a real impact on students' lives.
That's where Teach For America
corps members come in. We w ill admit
that Teach For America is not for
everyone. It is a difficult, intensive pro
gram that is best for people who are
passionate, quick thinkers and can
learn on the job through reflection and
collaboration with your fellow teach
ers at your schools.Teach For America
is not held up as the best way to train
teachers — it is one way to train a very
small group of teachers with clearly
defined skill-sets and passions.The stu
dents in Stanford's STFP program cer
tainly fit that profile, but there not
enough students who enter school and
commit to teaching to meet the needs
of our country's schools. It would be
great if Teach For America were un
necessary and all of this country's
teachers came from programs like
STEP Ihe reality is that is not the case,
and it is not going to be for a long time.
Teach For America was effective
for us, it is effective for many others
and it is constantly improving to
have even more of an impact. We

learned a tremendous amount in a
very short time from our mentors
and colleagues at Teach For Ameri
ca's institute, from Teach For Ameri
ca's program staff, and from the
teachers that we worked with in the
schools of St. Louis and North Car
olina. Our students were tremen
dous and made incredible gains, and
we saw with our own eyes the posi
tive impact of the corps members' ef
forts in our school districts.
Because of Teach For America,
our lives are now committed to edu
cational change and opportunity ex
pansion. as are the lives of thousands
of other Teach For America alumni.
Twenty-four percent ofTFA alumni
are still teaching in their original
placement schools, and 66 percent
are still working full time in educa
tion. Wherever you look, alumni re
main heavily influenced by the ex
traordinary experience of working
so closely with students, families and
teachers in such important,challeng
ing and immensely rewarding work
Every year, the institute and the
support that corps members receive
are scrutinized and improved by ed
ucators with years of experience. In

just the short time since we entered
Teach For America in 2(XM) (Tia) and
2003 (Kermit).we have seen incredi
ble strides in terms of preparing
every corps member for that first day
in the classroom. Before they begin
teaching, each corps member com
pletes hundreds of hours of course
work, observations, reflection and
teaching in schools in Los Angeles,
Houston, New York and Philadel
phia. As with any program, it can al
ways be improved, but one guaran
tee is that next year it will be even
better than it was last year.
Those in the best position to
judge are the ones who interact with
Teach For America every day. In
many of the most challenging school
districts across the country, princi
pals and superintendents see the im
pact of Teach For America teachers
every day.They have the right to de
cide whether or not they want to
bring Teach For America into their
districts, and they scrutinize corps
members to look for results. What is
the result? These educational lead
ers see the impact that Teach For
America has, and they ask for more.
Teach For America is not growing for
the sake of growth. It is growing be
cause our schools need and demand
its growth.
So you decide. We encourage
Stanford students to speak to people
who have participated in the pro
gram so that they can hear multiple
voices and multiple perspectives
when making decisions about poten
tial careers after undergrad. Regard
less of whether you decide to join
teaching through Teach For Ameri
ca. we hope that each of you serious
ly considers the opportunity to serve
as a teacher and have a significant
impact on the lives of students across
the country.

In support of Teach
for America
This letter is in response to the
Nov. 28 article, "Teach for America
Comes Under Fire." As a former
Teach For America corps member in
New York City and a current Stan
ford Law student, I would like to
clear up some of the misconceptions

and concerns that were expressed in
the article.
The notion that experience has
something to do with effectiveness,
as a general matter, is not controver
sial. Whatever it is we do. we tend to
get better at it the longer we do it, at
least so long as we continue to re
main passionate about whatever "it"
is. Unfortunately, for some this trans
lates into a pessimistic and dismis
sive view of Teach for America, an
organization that takes those with
little teaching experience and asks
them to perform at a level rarely
achieved even by those teachers with
significant experience. This argu
ment, however, misses several im
portant points.
First, the notion that certification, in
other words a minimum amount of ex
perience. is determinative of teaching
quality is misleading. Many first year
teachers, after taking the "traditional"
route to the classroom, enter the class
room and after a matter of days feel
woefully under prepared. They com
plain that what they learned during
their Master's or certification program
was focused on theory as opposed to
practice and so, once they do finally
enter the classroom, they are unsure
what to do. This is neither to say that
theory is unimportant nor that all Mas
ter's and certification programs focus
on theory at the expense of practice.
However, some do and it was a com
mon experience for me and many of
my fellow corps members to have tra
ditionally educated new teachers ask
ing for advice on how to "make some
thing work" in their classroom.
Second, even if one assumes that
"certification" equals greater effec
tiveness than non-certification as a
general matter, it does not follow that
the same is true in specific situations.
Teach for America recognizes that
with experience comes greater effec
tiveness and makes many attempts to
accelerate effectiveness at a pace that
is faster than a certain time period of
experience may predict for a non-TFA
teacher. This process starts with TFA's
selection mechanisms where they look
for a very specific type of individual
that their research has shown trans
lates into effective teachers. From
there,TFA provides a summer training
program that gives new corps mem
bers a theoretical background for how
to allow all students to access new in
formation. practical advice for how to
implement these methods and actual
experience in a controlled and moni
tored summer school setting. After the
summer program, TFA continues to

support their teachers with a program
director, an experienced teacher who
serves the functions of mentor, allow
ing the teacher to make great gains in
effectiveness from each new experi
ence, and of monitor, closely tracking
the progress each teacher is making
with her or his students and ensuring
significant gains are achieved by the
school year's end.
Third, even if some traditional pro
grams, like STEP, mold more effective
beginning teachers, the fact of the mat
ter is that there is a current shortage of
qualified teachers and something
needs to be done about it. While Teach
for America does not purport to be a
solution to the teacher shortage, the
problem is, at minimum, tangentially
related to their goal of closing the
achievement gap. If the option that
every potential TFA corps member
had was between going into teaching
via the traditional path or through the
nontraditional path, then maybe, al
though far from certainly, an argument
could be made that nontraditional pro
grams do more harm than good. In re
ality. without TFA nearly all potential
corps members would have bypassed
the opportunity to teach altogether.
This would clearly leave schtx>l districts
in a worse position,being forced to hire
inexperienced teachers who are not as
bright, well-trained or motivated as
those in TFA.
One would be hard-pressed to
find a Teach for America corps mem
ber or alumnus who does not feel sig
nificant structural changes are need
ed to fix the educational system in
our country. However, there is a
problem now and there are children
that need to be taught effectively
today. Without the help of Teach for
America, many of these children
would be left behind.
Furthermore, two-thirds of corps
members stay involved with the issue
of education after their two year
commitment, a significantly larger
amount than predicted at the begin
ning of their commitment. The im
pact of Teach for America, therefore,
goes well beyond the function of pro
viding today's students with the edu
cation they desperately need. Teach
for America motivates bright, pas
sionate individuals to devote their
abilities to pursuing substantive and
structural change to the education
system after their time as a teacher.
There is no study 1 know of that can
measure that impact.

Thank you for your support
Stanford students
Dear Stanford students. 1 should have writ
ten this note a long time ago; moreover, this
should have been a personal letter to each and
every one of you. so please regard this as such.
I waited a while before writing this because I
wanted my anger to subside so I would be able
to formulate my thoughts constructively. I
wanted to thank you all for your amazing sup
port and trust during the difficult time after my
tenure denial. It is your support, your letters,
emails and visits to my office that made me re
alize that my time here at Stanford was not a
total waste. I have touched the lives of many
students and this is a great achievement; I
would not have done any thing differently. I re
alize that this tenure decision has made many
of you wonder about your own career path.
Specifically, several of you indicated that you
are no longer certain that you want to pursue
an academic career at a high profile institute
like Stanford. I ask you to please not be discour
aged: do not give up on your dreams. I am cer
tainly not planning on doing so. I will continue
to be a first-rate scientist, innovative educator
and mentor at Stanford or elsewhere. It may be
a long ways away before the academic work
place will encourage and foster collaborative,
collegial and supportive conduct rather than
self-promotion and ruthless competition and

there may be more "casualties" along the way.
I lowever, we should continue to pursue our
dreams and maintain our values and ethics in
order to change the system. So please follow
your dreams, become productive scientists, in
fluential educators and most important kind
and compassionate people and I am sure in the
long run things will change.

Teach For America provides good
solution to education problem
Atter reading 'ITie Daily's article about
leach For America and the School of Educa
tion's STEP program ("Teach for America
comes under fire," Nov. 28), we felt com
pelled to share our perspectives as Teach For
America alumni and current members ot the
Stanford community
First, we do agree that Stanford's STEP
program is outstanding. Both of us are in the
joint MBA / Masters of Education program,
which means that we have worked with many
different faculty members and graduate stu
dents at the School of Education.The people
we have worked with are outstanding, and
though we have not taken classes directly in
the S1 EP program, we are confident that the
same level of professionalism and quality ex
ists in that program.
I lowever. the sad reality is that most stu
dents in the United States do not have the op
portunity to choose teachers from the STEP
program. The fact is that there are not enough
high quality teachers in the U.S. from programs
like STEP to serve students, and especially
those students in low income urban
and rural school districts. I lie students
and principals in these schools do not
have the option to select a teacher from
top education programs to fill their po
sitions; if they did not have a teacher
from Teach For America to fill that
role, the options would be an uncerti
fied permanent substitute or no
teacher at all. We have seen this from
experience. When 1 (Kermit) took over
my physics class in St. Louis, the school
had not been able to find a teacher
qualified in that subject,so the students
had literally been sitting in the room
with a study hall every day for the first
two weeks while a substitute fell asleep
at the front of the room.
Given this reality,something must
be done. It is not enough to just say,
"We should have more certified
teachers from top education pro
grams." The fact is that we don't. So
what can we do? We can either leave
those students without teachers, or

we can scour the country to find the
most talented recent college gradu
ates to join the ranks of teachers hav
ing a real impact on students' lives.
That's where Teach For America
corps members come in. We w ill admit
that Teach For America is not for
everyone. It is a difficult, intensive pro
gram that is best for people who are
passionate, quick thinkers and can
learn on the job through reflection and
collaboration with your fellow teach
ers at your schools.Teach For America
is not held up as the best way to train
teachers — it is one way to train a very
small group of teachers with clearly
defined skill-sets and passions.The stu
dents in Stanford's STFP program cer
tainly fit that profile, but there not
enough students who enter school and
commit to teaching to meet the needs
of our country's schools. It would be
great if Teach For America were un
necessary and all of this country's
teachers came from programs like
STEP Ihe reality is that is not the case,
and it is not going to be for a long time.
Teach For America was effective
for us, it is effective for many others
and it is constantly improving to
have even more of an impact. We

learned a tremendous amount in a
very short time from our mentors
and colleagues at Teach For Ameri
ca's institute, from Teach For Ameri
ca's program staff, and from the
teachers that we worked with in the
schools of St. Louis and North Car
olina. Our students were tremen
dous and made incredible gains, and
we saw with our own eyes the posi
tive impact of the corps members' ef
forts in our school districts.
Because of Teach For America,
our lives are now committed to edu
cational change and opportunity ex
pansion. as are the lives of thousands
of other Teach For America alumni.
Twenty-four percent ofTFA alumni
are still teaching in their original
placement schools, and 66 percent
are still working full time in educa
tion. Wherever you look, alumni re
main heavily influenced by the ex
traordinary experience of working
so closely with students, families and
teachers in such important,challeng
ing and immensely rewarding work
Every year, the institute and the
support that corps members receive
are scrutinized and improved by ed
ucators with years of experience. In

just the short time since we entered
Teach For America in 2(XM) (Tia) and
2003 (Kermit).we have seen incredi
ble strides in terms of preparing
every corps member for that first day
in the classroom. Before they begin
teaching, each corps member com
pletes hundreds of hours of course
work, observations, reflection and
teaching in schools in Los Angeles,
Houston, New York and Philadel
phia. As with any program, it can al
ways be improved, but one guaran
tee is that next year it will be even
better than it was last year.
Those in the best position to
judge are the ones who interact with
Teach For America every day. In
many of the most challenging school
districts across the country, princi
pals and superintendents see the im
pact of Teach For America teachers
every day.They have the right to de
cide whether or not they want to
bring Teach For America into their
districts, and they scrutinize corps
members to look for results. What is
the result? These educational lead
ers see the impact that Teach For
America has, and they ask for more.
Teach For America is not growing for
the sake of growth. It is growing be
cause our schools need and demand
its growth.
So you decide. We encourage
Stanford students to speak to people
who have participated in the pro
gram so that they can hear multiple
voices and multiple perspectives
when making decisions about poten
tial careers after undergrad. Regard
less of whether you decide to join
teaching through Teach For Ameri
ca. we hope that each of you serious
ly considers the opportunity to serve
as a teacher and have a significant
impact on the lives of students across
the country.

In support of Teach
for America
This letter is in response to the
Nov. 28 article, "Teach for America
Comes Under Fire." As a former
Teach For America corps member in
New York City and a current Stan
ford Law student, I would like to
clear up some of the misconceptions

and concerns that were expressed in
the article.
The notion that experience has
something to do with effectiveness,
as a general matter, is not controver
sial. Whatever it is we do. we tend to
get better at it the longer we do it, at
least so long as we continue to re
main passionate about whatever "it"
is. Unfortunately, for some this trans
lates into a pessimistic and dismis
sive view of Teach for America, an
organization that takes those with
little teaching experience and asks
them to perform at a level rarely
achieved even by those teachers with
significant experience. This argu
ment, however, misses several im
portant points.
First, the notion that certification, in
other words a minimum amount of ex
perience. is determinative of teaching
quality is misleading. Many first year
teachers, after taking the "traditional"
route to the classroom, enter the class
room and after a matter of days feel
woefully under prepared. They com
plain that what they learned during
their Master's or certification program
was focused on theory as opposed to
practice and so, once they do finally
enter the classroom, they are unsure
what to do. This is neither to say that
theory is unimportant nor that all Mas
ter's and certification programs focus
on theory at the expense of practice.
However, some do and it was a com
mon experience for me and many of
my fellow corps members to have tra
ditionally educated new teachers ask
ing for advice on how to "make some
thing work" in their classroom.
Second, even if one assumes that
"certification" equals greater effec
tiveness than non-certification as a
general matter, it does not follow that
the same is true in specific situations.
Teach for America recognizes that
with experience comes greater effec
tiveness and makes many attempts to
accelerate effectiveness at a pace that
is faster than a certain time period of
experience may predict for a non-TFA
teacher. This process starts with TFA's
selection mechanisms where they look
for a very specific type of individual
that their research has shown trans
lates into effective teachers. From
there,TFA provides a summer training
program that gives new corps mem
bers a theoretical background for how
to allow all students to access new in
formation. practical advice for how to
implement these methods and actual
experience in a controlled and moni
tored summer school setting. After the
summer program, TFA continues to

support their teachers with a program
director, an experienced teacher who
serves the functions of mentor, allow
ing the teacher to make great gains in
effectiveness from each new experi
ence, and of monitor, closely tracking
the progress each teacher is making
with her or his students and ensuring
significant gains are achieved by the
school year's end.
Third, even if some traditional pro
grams, like STEP, mold more effective
beginning teachers, the fact of the mat
ter is that there is a current shortage of
qualified teachers and something
needs to be done about it. While Teach
for America does not purport to be a
solution to the teacher shortage, the
problem is, at minimum, tangentially
related to their goal of closing the
achievement gap. If the option that
every potential TFA corps member
had was between going into teaching
via the traditional path or through the
nontraditional path, then maybe, al
though far from certainly, an argument
could be made that nontraditional pro
grams do more harm than good. In re
ality. without TFA nearly all potential
corps members would have bypassed
the opportunity to teach altogether.
This would clearly leave schtx>l districts
in a worse position,being forced to hire
inexperienced teachers who are not as
bright, well-trained or motivated as
those in TFA.
One would be hard-pressed to
find a Teach for America corps mem
ber or alumnus who does not feel sig
nificant structural changes are need
ed to fix the educational system in
our country. However, there is a
problem now and there are children
that need to be taught effectively
today. Without the help of Teach for
America, many of these children
would be left behind.
Furthermore, two-thirds of corps
members stay involved with the issue
of education after their two year
commitment, a significantly larger
amount than predicted at the begin
ning of their commitment. The im
pact of Teach for America, therefore,
goes well beyond the function of pro
viding today's students with the edu
cation they desperately need. Teach
for America motivates bright, pas
sionate individuals to devote their
abilities to pursuing substantive and
structural change to the education
system after their time as a teacher.
There is no study 1 know of that can
measure that impact.

Go to Big Game
lliis is a call to arms. We here at the Stanford
Band have been in stealth mode for much of
the quarter, but we'd like to speak to you today
with the greatest enthusiasm and honesty. Our
apparent absence has all been part of our mas
ter plan. We hoped to lull the enemies of humor
and fun into a false sense of security, but lo!
Now our grandiose plan is to he unfurled: Just
when the Weenies think we have been defeat
ed, just when they think the Cardinal fans have
grown silent and apathetic, just when Oski was
about to stuff his face with another donut — we
strike. A musical assault for all history and time
will occur on Saturday. The Band will invade
the Big Game, equipped with a full comple
ment of dollies and a mighty Tree. Though the
powers-that-be deem our field shows to be too
lethal a weapon against Cal. we're still going to
bring the funk. I lard.
But we hope not to be alone in the sea of
overzealous crazed Weenie fans. We need
your help. For many of us, this is our last Big
Game. But you may be saying to your your
selves: "Why, why would I want to join this
suicidal assault on a stadium stacked with
chagrined UC scoundrels? I have an lIIIJM
paper to do." No, you don't. Here is our
promise to you, the student body: we will do
all of your I HUM papers and problem sets if
you go to Big Game and be generally rowdy.
Not "Jump during 'All Right Now' and sit
down" rowdy. We mean shouting, creative
and psychotic cheers, standing on your seat,
paint-your-face-with-goats-blood rowdy. The
Band, after playing at Big Game and a week's
worth of rallies will sit down and write your
papers. We've checked with the dean of stu
dents. this is completely kosher with the
honor code.

So join our ranks this Saturday. Ik- there
as we witness the greatest thing ever and we
take back what is ours. The Band knows our

Teach For America provides good
solution to education problem
Atter reading 'ITie Daily's article about
leach For America and the School of Educa
tion's STEP program ("Teach for America
comes under fire," Nov. 28), we felt com
pelled to share our perspectives as Teach For
America alumni and current members ot the
Stanford community
First, we do agree that Stanford's STEP
program is outstanding. Both of us are in the
joint MBA / Masters of Education program,
which means that we have worked with many
different faculty members and graduate stu
dents at the School of Education.The people
we have worked with are outstanding, and
though we have not taken classes directly in
the S1 EP program, we are confident that the
same level of professionalism and quality ex
ists in that program.
I lowever. the sad reality is that most stu
dents in the United States do not have the op
portunity to choose teachers from the STEP
program. The fact is that there are not enough
high quality teachers in the U.S. from programs
like STEP to serve students, and especially
those students in low income urban
and rural school districts. I lie students
and principals in these schools do not
have the option to select a teacher from
top education programs to fill their po
sitions; if they did not have a teacher
from Teach For America to fill that
role, the options would be an uncerti
fied permanent substitute or no
teacher at all. We have seen this from
experience. When 1 (Kermit) took over
my physics class in St. Louis, the school
had not been able to find a teacher
qualified in that subject,so the students
had literally been sitting in the room
with a study hall every day for the first
two weeks while a substitute fell asleep
at the front of the room.
Given this reality,something must
be done. It is not enough to just say,
"We should have more certified
teachers from top education pro
grams." The fact is that we don't. So
what can we do? We can either leave
those students without teachers, or

we can scour the country to find the
most talented recent college gradu
ates to join the ranks of teachers hav
ing a real impact on students' lives.
That's where Teach For America
corps members come in. We w ill admit
that Teach For America is not for
everyone. It is a difficult, intensive pro
gram that is best for people who are
passionate, quick thinkers and can
learn on the job through reflection and
collaboration with your fellow teach
ers at your schools.Teach For America
is not held up as the best way to train
teachers — it is one way to train a very
small group of teachers with clearly
defined skill-sets and passions.The stu
dents in Stanford's STFP program cer
tainly fit that profile, but there not
enough students who enter school and
commit to teaching to meet the needs
of our country's schools. It would be
great if Teach For America were un
necessary and all of this country's
teachers came from programs like
STEP Ihe reality is that is not the case,
and it is not going to be for a long time.
Teach For America was effective
for us, it is effective for many others
and it is constantly improving to
have even more of an impact. We

learned a tremendous amount in a
very short time from our mentors
and colleagues at Teach For Ameri
ca's institute, from Teach For Ameri
ca's program staff, and from the
teachers that we worked with in the
schools of St. Louis and North Car
olina. Our students were tremen
dous and made incredible gains, and
we saw with our own eyes the posi
tive impact of the corps members' ef
forts in our school districts.
Because of Teach For America,
our lives are now committed to edu
cational change and opportunity ex
pansion. as are the lives of thousands
of other Teach For America alumni.
Twenty-four percent ofTFA alumni
are still teaching in their original
placement schools, and 66 percent
are still working full time in educa
tion. Wherever you look, alumni re
main heavily influenced by the ex
traordinary experience of working
so closely with students, families and
teachers in such important,challeng
ing and immensely rewarding work
Every year, the institute and the
support that corps members receive
are scrutinized and improved by ed
ucators with years of experience. In

just the short time since we entered
Teach For America in 2(XM) (Tia) and
2003 (Kermit).we have seen incredi
ble strides in terms of preparing
every corps member for that first day
in the classroom. Before they begin
teaching, each corps member com
pletes hundreds of hours of course
work, observations, reflection and
teaching in schools in Los Angeles,
Houston, New York and Philadel
phia. As with any program, it can al
ways be improved, but one guaran
tee is that next year it will be even
better than it was last year.
Those in the best position to
judge are the ones who interact with
Teach For America every day. In
many of the most challenging school
districts across the country, princi
pals and superintendents see the im
pact of Teach For America teachers
every day.They have the right to de
cide whether or not they want to
bring Teach For America into their
districts, and they scrutinize corps
members to look for results. What is
the result? These educational lead
ers see the impact that Teach For
America has, and they ask for more.
Teach For America is not growing for
the sake of growth. It is growing be
cause our schools need and demand
its growth.
So you decide. We encourage
Stanford students to speak to people
who have participated in the pro
gram so that they can hear multiple
voices and multiple perspectives
when making decisions about poten
tial careers after undergrad. Regard
less of whether you decide to join
teaching through Teach For Ameri
ca. we hope that each of you serious
ly considers the opportunity to serve
as a teacher and have a significant
impact on the lives of students across
the country.

In support of Teach
for America
This letter is in response to the
Nov. 28 article, "Teach for America
Comes Under Fire." As a former
Teach For America corps member in
New York City and a current Stan
ford Law student, I would like to
clear up some of the misconceptions

and concerns that were expressed in
the article.
The notion that experience has
something to do with effectiveness,
as a general matter, is not controver
sial. Whatever it is we do. we tend to
get better at it the longer we do it, at
least so long as we continue to re
main passionate about whatever "it"
is. Unfortunately, for some this trans
lates into a pessimistic and dismis
sive view of Teach for America, an
organization that takes those with
little teaching experience and asks
them to perform at a level rarely
achieved even by those teachers with
significant experience. This argu
ment, however, misses several im
portant points.
First, the notion that certification, in
other words a minimum amount of ex
perience. is determinative of teaching
quality is misleading. Many first year
teachers, after taking the "traditional"
route to the classroom, enter the class
room and after a matter of days feel
woefully under prepared. They com
plain that what they learned during
their Master's or certification program
was focused on theory as opposed to
practice and so, once they do finally
enter the classroom, they are unsure
what to do. This is neither to say that
theory is unimportant nor that all Mas
ter's and certification programs focus
on theory at the expense of practice.
However, some do and it was a com
mon experience for me and many of
my fellow corps members to have tra
ditionally educated new teachers ask
ing for advice on how to "make some
thing work" in their classroom.
Second, even if one assumes that
"certification" equals greater effec
tiveness than non-certification as a
general matter, it does not follow that
the same is true in specific situations.
Teach for America recognizes that
with experience comes greater effec
tiveness and makes many attempts to
accelerate effectiveness at a pace that
is faster than a certain time period of
experience may predict for a non-TFA
teacher. This process starts with TFA's
selection mechanisms where they look
for a very specific type of individual
that their research has shown trans
lates into effective teachers. From
there,TFA provides a summer training
program that gives new corps mem
bers a theoretical background for how
to allow all students to access new in
formation. practical advice for how to
implement these methods and actual
experience in a controlled and moni
tored summer school setting. After the
summer program, TFA continues to

support their teachers with a program
director, an experienced teacher who
serves the functions of mentor, allow
ing the teacher to make great gains in
effectiveness from each new experi
ence, and of monitor, closely tracking
the progress each teacher is making
with her or his students and ensuring
significant gains are achieved by the
school year's end.
Third, even if some traditional pro
grams, like STEP, mold more effective
beginning teachers, the fact of the mat
ter is that there is a current shortage of
qualified teachers and something
needs to be done about it. While Teach
for America does not purport to be a
solution to the teacher shortage, the
problem is, at minimum, tangentially
related to their goal of closing the
achievement gap. If the option that
every potential TFA corps member
had was between going into teaching
via the traditional path or through the
nontraditional path, then maybe, al
though far from certainly, an argument
could be made that nontraditional pro
grams do more harm than good. In re
ality. without TFA nearly all potential
corps members would have bypassed
the opportunity to teach altogether.
This would clearly leave schtx>l districts
in a worse position,being forced to hire
inexperienced teachers who are not as
bright, well-trained or motivated as
those in TFA.
One would be hard-pressed to
find a Teach for America corps mem
ber or alumnus who does not feel sig
nificant structural changes are need
ed to fix the educational system in
our country. However, there is a
problem now and there are children
that need to be taught effectively
today. Without the help of Teach for
America, many of these children
would be left behind.
Furthermore, two-thirds of corps
members stay involved with the issue
of education after their two year
commitment, a significantly larger
amount than predicted at the begin
ning of their commitment. The im
pact of Teach for America, therefore,
goes well beyond the function of pro
viding today's students with the edu
cation they desperately need. Teach
for America motivates bright, pas
sionate individuals to devote their
abilities to pursuing substantive and
structural change to the education
system after their time as a teacher.
There is no study 1 know of that can
measure that impact.

Go to Big Game
lliis is a call to arms. We here at the Stanford
Band have been in stealth mode for much of
the quarter, but we'd like to speak to you today
with the greatest enthusiasm and honesty. Our
apparent absence has all been part of our mas
ter plan. We hoped to lull the enemies of humor
and fun into a false sense of security, but lo!
Now our grandiose plan is to he unfurled: Just
when the Weenies think we have been defeat
ed, just when they think the Cardinal fans have
grown silent and apathetic, just when Oski was
about to stuff his face with another donut — we
strike. A musical assault for all history and time
will occur on Saturday. The Band will invade
the Big Game, equipped with a full comple
ment of dollies and a mighty Tree. Though the
powers-that-be deem our field shows to be too
lethal a weapon against Cal. we're still going to
bring the funk. I lard.
But we hope not to be alone in the sea of
overzealous crazed Weenie fans. We need
your help. For many of us, this is our last Big
Game. But you may be saying to your your
selves: "Why, why would I want to join this
suicidal assault on a stadium stacked with
chagrined UC scoundrels? I have an lIIIJM
paper to do." No, you don't. Here is our
promise to you, the student body: we will do
all of your I HUM papers and problem sets if
you go to Big Game and be generally rowdy.
Not "Jump during 'All Right Now' and sit
down" rowdy. We mean shouting, creative
and psychotic cheers, standing on your seat,
paint-your-face-with-goats-blood rowdy. The
Band, after playing at Big Game and a week's
worth of rallies will sit down and write your
papers. We've checked with the dean of stu
dents. this is completely kosher with the
honor code.

So join our ranks this Saturday. Ik- there
as we witness the greatest thing ever and we
take back what is ours. The Band knows our
football team has a better game plan than our
own to win the day; they only ask your help in
bringing the funk.To arms and Go Cardinal!
THE BAND
Thank you for your support
Stanford students
Dear Stanford students. 1 should have writ
ten this note a long time ago; moreover, this
should have been a personal letter to each and
every one of you. so please regard this as such.
I waited a while before writing this because I
wanted my anger to subside so I would be able
to formulate my thoughts constructively. I
wanted to thank you all for your amazing sup
port and trust during the difficult time after my
tenure denial. It is your support, your letters,
emails and visits to my office that made me re
alize that my time here at Stanford was not a
total waste. I have touched the lives of many
students and this is a great achievement; I
would not have done any thing differently. I re
alize that this tenure decision has made many
of you wonder about your own career path.
Specifically, several of you indicated that you
are no longer certain that you want to pursue
an academic career at a high profile institute
like Stanford. I ask you to please not be discour
aged: do not give up on your dreams. I am cer
tainly not planning on doing so. I will continue
to be a first-rate scientist, innovative educator
and mentor at Stanford or elsewhere. It may be
a long ways away before the academic work
place will encourage and foster collaborative,
collegial and supportive conduct rather than
self-promotion and ruthless competition and

there may be more "casualties" along the way.
I lowever, we should continue to pursue our
dreams and maintain our values and ethics in
order to change the system. So please follow
your dreams, become productive scientists, in
fluential educators and most important kind
and compassionate people and I am sure in the
long run things will change.

role, the options would be an uncerti
fied permanent substitute or no
teacher at all. We have seen this from
experience. When 1 (Kermit) took over
my physics class in St. Louis, the school
had not been able to find a teacher
qualified in that subject,so the students
had literally been sitting in the room
with a study hall every day for the first
two weeks while a substitute fell asleep
at the front of the room.
Given this reality,something must
be done. It is not enough to just say,
"We should have more certified
teachers from top education pro
grams." The fact is that we don't. So
what can we do? We can either leave
those students without teachers, or

we can scour the country to find the
most talented recent college gradu
ates to join the ranks of teachers hav
ing a real impact on students' lives.
That's where Teach For America
corps members come in. We w ill admit
that Teach For America is not for
everyone. It is a difficult, intensive pro
gram that is best for people who are
passionate, quick thinkers and can
learn on the job through reflection and
collaboration with your fellow teach
ers at your schools.Teach For America
is not held up as the best way to train
teachers — it is one way to train a very
small group of teachers with clearly
defined skill-sets and passions.The stu
dents in Stanford's STFP program cer
tainly fit that profile, but there not
enough students who enter school and
commit to teaching to meet the needs
of our country's schools. It would be
great if Teach For America were un
necessary and all of this country's
teachers came from programs like
STEP Ihe reality is that is not the case,
and it is not going to be for a long time.
Teach For America was effective
for us, it is effective for many others
and it is constantly improving to
have even more of an impact. We

learned a tremendous amount in a
very short time from our mentors
and colleagues at Teach For Ameri
ca's institute, from Teach For Ameri
ca's program staff, and from the
teachers that we worked with in the
schools of St. Louis and North Car
olina. Our students were tremen
dous and made incredible gains, and
we saw with our own eyes the posi
tive impact of the corps members' ef
forts in our school districts.
Because of Teach For America,
our lives are now committed to edu
cational change and opportunity ex
pansion. as are the lives of thousands
of other Teach For America alumni.
Twenty-four percent ofTFA alumni
are still teaching in their original
placement schools, and 66 percent
are still working full time in educa
tion. Wherever you look, alumni re
main heavily influenced by the ex
traordinary experience of working
so closely with students, families and
teachers in such important,challeng
ing and immensely rewarding work
Every year, the institute and the
support that corps members receive
are scrutinized and improved by ed
ucators with years of experience. In

just the short time since we entered
Teach For America in 2(XM) (Tia) and
2003 (Kermit).we have seen incredi
ble strides in terms of preparing
every corps member for that first day
in the classroom. Before they begin
teaching, each corps member com
pletes hundreds of hours of course
work, observations, reflection and
teaching in schools in Los Angeles,
Houston, New York and Philadel
phia. As with any program, it can al
ways be improved, but one guaran
tee is that next year it will be even
better than it was last year.
Those in the best position to
judge are the ones who interact with
Teach For America every day. In
many of the most challenging school
districts across the country, princi
pals and superintendents see the im
pact of Teach For America teachers
every day.They have the right to de
cide whether or not they want to
bring Teach For America into their
districts, and they scrutinize corps
members to look for results. What is
the result? These educational lead
ers see the impact that Teach For
America has, and they ask for more.
Teach For America is not growing for
the sake of growth. It is growing be
cause our schools need and demand
its growth.
So you decide. We encourage
Stanford students to speak to people
who have participated in the pro
gram so that they can hear multiple
voices and multiple perspectives
when making decisions about poten
tial careers after undergrad. Regard
less of whether you decide to join
teaching through Teach For Ameri
ca. we hope that each of you serious
ly considers the opportunity to serve
as a teacher and have a significant
impact on the lives of students across
the country.

In support of Teach
for America
This letter is in response to the
Nov. 28 article, "Teach for America
Comes Under Fire." As a former
Teach For America corps member in
New York City and a current Stan
ford Law student, I would like to
clear up some of the misconceptions

and concerns that were expressed in
the article.
The notion that experience has
something to do with effectiveness,
as a general matter, is not controver
sial. Whatever it is we do. we tend to
get better at it the longer we do it, at
least so long as we continue to re
main passionate about whatever "it"
is. Unfortunately, for some this trans
lates into a pessimistic and dismis
sive view of Teach for America, an
organization that takes those with
little teaching experience and asks
them to perform at a level rarely
achieved even by those teachers with
significant experience. This argu
ment, however, misses several im
portant points.
First, the notion that certification, in
other words a minimum amount of ex
perience. is determinative of teaching
quality is misleading. Many first year
teachers, after taking the "traditional"
route to the classroom, enter the class
room and after a matter of days feel
woefully under prepared. They com
plain that what they learned during
their Master's or certification program
was focused on theory as opposed to
practice and so, once they do finally
enter the classroom, they are unsure
what to do. This is neither to say that
theory is unimportant nor that all Mas
ter's and certification programs focus
on theory at the expense of practice.
However, some do and it was a com
mon experience for me and many of
my fellow corps members to have tra
ditionally educated new teachers ask
ing for advice on how to "make some
thing work" in their classroom.
Second, even if one assumes that
"certification" equals greater effec
tiveness than non-certification as a
general matter, it does not follow that
the same is true in specific situations.
Teach for America recognizes that
with experience comes greater effec
tiveness and makes many attempts to
accelerate effectiveness at a pace that
is faster than a certain time period of
experience may predict for a non-TFA
teacher. This process starts with TFA's
selection mechanisms where they look
for a very specific type of individual
that their research has shown trans
lates into effective teachers. From
there,TFA provides a summer training
program that gives new corps mem
bers a theoretical background for how
to allow all students to access new in
formation. practical advice for how to
implement these methods and actual
experience in a controlled and moni
tored summer school setting. After the
summer program, TFA continues to

support their teachers with a program
director, an experienced teacher who
serves the functions of mentor, allow
ing the teacher to make great gains in
effectiveness from each new experi
ence, and of monitor, closely tracking
the progress each teacher is making
with her or his students and ensuring
significant gains are achieved by the
school year's end.
Third, even if some traditional pro
grams, like STEP, mold more effective
beginning teachers, the fact of the mat
ter is that there is a current shortage of
qualified teachers and something
needs to be done about it. While Teach
for America does not purport to be a
solution to the teacher shortage, the
problem is, at minimum, tangentially
related to their goal of closing the
achievement gap. If the option that
every potential TFA corps member
had was between going into teaching
via the traditional path or through the
nontraditional path, then maybe, al
though far from certainly, an argument
could be made that nontraditional pro
grams do more harm than good. In re
ality. without TFA nearly all potential
corps members would have bypassed
the opportunity to teach altogether.
This would clearly leave schtx>l districts
in a worse position,being forced to hire
inexperienced teachers who are not as
bright, well-trained or motivated as
those in TFA.
One would be hard-pressed to
find a Teach for America corps mem
ber or alumnus who does not feel sig
nificant structural changes are need
ed to fix the educational system in
our country. However, there is a
problem now and there are children
that need to be taught effectively
today. Without the help of Teach for
America, many of these children
would be left behind.
Furthermore, two-thirds of corps
members stay involved with the issue
of education after their two year
commitment, a significantly larger
amount than predicted at the begin
ning of their commitment. The im
pact of Teach for America, therefore,
goes well beyond the function of pro
viding today's students with the edu
cation they desperately need. Teach
for America motivates bright, pas
sionate individuals to devote their
abilities to pursuing substantive and
structural change to the education
system after their time as a teacher.
There is no study 1 know of that can
measure that impact.
