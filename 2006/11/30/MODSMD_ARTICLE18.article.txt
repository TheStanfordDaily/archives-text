## DETERMINED CARD DOMINATE No. 15 hoops throttles Santa Clara, 88-56 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
It was a welcome return to Maples Pavilion
last night for the No. 15 Stanford women's basket
ball team. After a difficult weekend on the road
with losses against No. 4 Tennessee and No. 8
Georgia, the Cardinal dominated Santa Clara 88-
56 leading into Sunday's bout against No. 25 Texas
lech.
"You always want to get out there again after
a loss, and 1 think we had a little fire under us this
time." senior center Kristen Newlin said. "We
were excited to be at home, but we're going to
take away as much as we can for the weekend and
look forward."
Newlin powered Stanford to an early 7-0 run
in little more than a minute, setting a decisive tone
against the Broncos. Unable to get inside, and
lacking the Cardinal's height, Santa Clara was
kept to just 28 field goal attempts, compared to
Stanford's 41 in the first half.Stanford went on an
other 8-0 run in the middle of the half, leading by
as many as 17 points. The Broncos trailed 46-30 at
halftime.
"I think it was really important to get our con
fidence back and be fluid in our play," sophomore
forward Jillian Harmon said. "We did a good job
of passing inside and getting the open shots."
After a slow start in the second-half, the Cardi
nal went on to extend its lead by as many as 38
points on 12-0 and 10-Oruns.A tight perimeter de
fense locked up the Broncos' strong three-point
shooting as Santa Clara scrambled to get open
shots. I lead coach Tara VanDerveer deemed the
Cardinal's perimeter defense its top priority for
the evening.
"We just knew we couldn't leave them open
for threes, and if people were going to sleep, they
had to come out," she said. "[The Broncos] can
knock down those threes; it wasn't safe until
maybe about five minutes to go."
Stanford penned the Broncos to a 30-point
lead by those last five minutes,having taken a cue
from the Lady Vols' and Lady Bulldogs' aggres
sive defense this past weekend.
"1 think that's the number one thing that's
been lacking: defensive intensity and defensive

pressure," VanDerveer said.
Also previously lacking for the Cardinal was
depth, hut they found it last night with five players
scoring in the double-digits. Harmon led with 16
points, followed by senior center Brooke Smith:
junior guard Candice Wiggins and freshman for
ward Michelle I larrison who each had 13 points.
Santa Clara had only two such players in compar
ison: junior guard Chandice Chronk with 13
points and senior guard Ashley Graham with 10.
Newlin notched her third double-double of
the season with 12 points and a season-high 16 re
bounds. Her inside intensity and ability to knock
down the three (she was three for five for the
night) have opened things up for Stanford.
"I think Newlin really stepped up big,and this

liUftS: Stanford returns to Maples Pavilion on Sunday
for a 2 p.m. tip-off against Texas Tech. The Lady
Raiders have won five of their first six games and check
in at No. 25 and 23 in this week's Associated Press and
USA Today/ESPN coaches polls, respectively after beat
ing then No. 21 UCLA in Hawaii on Sunday. It is the
first time Texas Tech is back in the polls since December
2005. Before that they had been ranked 248 consecu
tive weeks. Following almost a two-week break, the
Cardinal hosts Utah on Saturday, Dec. 16.

is what we need her to do," Van-
Derveer said. "She opened things up
for us with her perimeter shot."
Newlin brought a lesson from this
past weekend and her developing
strength to the hoards last night.
"Getting stronger helps, hut [get
ting the rebounds is about] just want
ing it." Newlin said. "You see the suc
cess of other teams like Tennessee,
and they go up to the boards and
that's pretty much their offense. I
think we have the players and person
nel so that we can do that, too. I just al
ways think it's not going in and go for
it."
After shooting just 25 percent at
the free-throw line this past weekend
at Georgia, the Cardinal was also
looking to improve and finished the
night 22 for 32 for a much better 68.8
percent.
"1 feel like we can improve on our
free-throw percentage, but it's good
to get up to the free-throw line and get
that nervousness out of the way," 1 lar
mon said. "It's just about repetition
and practice."
Learning and adjusting after two
losses that dropped them four ranks,
the women are looking to keep their
comeback going for more than one
game, against a more difficult oppo
nent.Texas Tech.
"[Santa Clara] is really a different
team from the ones back there [in the
East],but I think this is more about us
— who we are and how we want to
play," VanDerveer said.
