# Unless they win

### 
It had to happen sooner or later,
even though I've managed to
avoid it all season. Because in all
probability, after Saturday's Big
Game at Cal. Stanford football will
finish the year at 1-11. and new Ath
letic Director Bob Bowlsby will have
to take a serious and prolonged look
at a program that has gone 16-39
since Tyrone Willingham's departure
after the 2001 season.
To be fair, as has been pointed out
previously by many others. Walt Har
ris didn't exactly inherit a power
house from former coach Buddy
Teevens. Moreover, after his first full
year of recruiting, Harris did land a
pair of true freshmen who look to
have bright futures in receiver
Richard Sherman and running back
Toby Gerhart.
There have certainly been aspects
of this disappointing season that
were outside of Harris' control. In
juries ravaged the Cardinal in '06.
and they seemed to strike at the
worst possible positions.The litany of
players who missed significant time
due to injury is both lengthy and fa
miliar by now: Trent Edwards, Mark
Bradford, Evan Moore, Alex Fletch
er, Nick Frank and Michael Okwo —
who has proven to be the Cardinal's
best player since returning from an
early-season injury.
But the question remains — will
any of these mitigating factors be
enough to save Walt Harris' job?
It's certainly a fair question to ask.
even though a coach would normally
have more than two years to turn a


Denis
Griffin
struggling program around. But
Harris wasn't Bowlsby's hire to
begin with — it was former A D.Ted
Leland, who made that decision
which could give Bowlsby the ex
cuse he needs to hire his own guy.
On the other hand, the smart
move might be to let Harris stick
around and try to right the ship.
When you consider that some seniors
on the team were recruited by Tyrone
Willingham, coached in their early
years by Buddy Teevens and then led
most recently by 1 larris, continuity
could be the one thing the Stanford
program needs most. And certainly,
unless the University changes its pre
vious philosophy on how much a
coach is worth, it's doubtful that
Stanford could find anyone better
than Harris to take over a team in the
kind of shape this one is in.
But make no mistake about it.
the situation is one that Bowlsby will
have to investigate very closely, and
in fact he's probably already made
up his mind on Harris' future, one
way or the other. Harris was dealt a
bad hand when he arrived, but no
one ever said the world of college
athletics was a fair one, and he may
be booted from the game before he
was ever really in it.
The University didn't just spend
millions of dollars on a new stadium
to be content with a team that could
n't come up with a single home win.
And the boosters who helped fund it
won't be helping to fund much else
in the near future if the University
doesn't at least look like it's being
active in trying to solve the problem.
And whether the Cardinal lose to
the Bears by a lot or a little bit less
than a lot, something will still have
to happen on that front.
So while the score of the C'al
game might be used as an excuse if
it's particularly ugly, I doubt it will
truly have any effect on the immedi
ate future of the Cardinal's coach.
Unless, that is, Stanford were to
win it.
If you've ever doubted just how
big the Big Game really is, here's a
scenario that should clear things up.
Let's say. hypothetically, that Bowls
by has indeed made up his mind and
plans on axing Harris shortly after
C'al wins the Axe for the fifth con
secutive year. Then, the A 1 Michaels
moment happens, Stanford students
believe in miracles, we all go home
from Berkeley jubilantly, and Cal
fans everywhere contemplate the
most disappointing two weeks of
football they've ever seen.
Would Bowlsby fire anyone who
was involved in a win like that? Or
could he even think about it? Noway.
Let me save you the suspense —
none of that will happen. Probably.
But even still, it adds a little luster to
a matchup that hasn't looked uglier
for the Cardinal in at least twenty
years. And soon enough after the
game, we'll all know a little bit more
about the patience (or lack thereof)
of Bob Bowlsby.
Unless they win.

believe in miracles, we all go home
from Berkeley jubilantly, and Cal
fans everywhere contemplate the
most disappointing two weeks of
football they've ever seen.
Would Bowlsby fire anyone who
was involved in a win like that? Or
could he even think about it? Noway.
Let me save you the suspense —
none of that will happen. Probably.
But even still, it adds a little luster to
a matchup that hasn't looked uglier
for the Cardinal in at least twenty
years. And soon enough after the
game, we'll all know a little bit more
about the patience (or lack thereof)
of Bob Bowlsby.
Unless they win.
