# SENIOR DISCONTENT ON THE RISE
## But administrators and officials say sentiment is nothing new among seniors during fall quarter

Senior Janet Guajardo returned
from his 22nd birthday party at
Comprade's like most others: in a
good mood, a few drinks deep and
ready for some hijinks. lie stripped
down to his birthday suit and en
tered the CoHo. Most years, he
would have streaked. This Novem
ber. however, Guajardo took the op
portunity to lash out at what he de
scribed at the injustices visited upon
the class of 2007. ranging from the
Hike Ban, fewer Pub Nights and the
Band Run. When he was done, some
students clapped, others booed and
most averted their eyes. Every ob
server. however, took away one
note: as President Jimmy Carter fa
mously stated, a "general malaise"
has struck this year's senior class.
"1 believe the University is be

coming more concerned with mak
ing a profit and less concerned with
the experience of the individual stu
dent." said senior Matt Percy,
founder of the Facebook group,
"When 1 was your age, Stanford was
Fun." "The University needs to real
ize that many people came to Stan
ford because in addition to offering a
great education. Stanford has the
reputation of being a little more re
laxed and carefree than other top
schools. We are after all college stu
dents, and I'd like to have a little fun
during my last year."
Seniors have pointed to a number
of recent grievances, including the
Band's disciplinary troubles, hassles
getting onto buses headed for Pub
Night, stricter alcohol policies, the
Bike Ban and party restrictions. Some

New bike regulations in the Quad area are one in a string of recent University rules that some seniors feel is weakening Stanford's trademark liberal atmos
phere. University administrators, however, chalk up the discontent to traditional fall quarter blues among the senior class.
sity's way of gradually weakening
much of the social scene on campus.
"There seems to have been a shift
this year to no longer treat students
as adults but rather as baby chicks
who are too brittle and irrational to
make their own decisions," said sen
ior Chris Holt, who also writes a col
umn for The Daily.
In addition to seniors, many
alumni feel that Stanford's focus on
academic excellence has forced the
University to alter some of its past
social practices and traditions.
"I think Stanford has become a
lot more serious about keeping its
place as a top undergraduate institu
tion and is convinced that this is mu
tually exclusive from partying and
drinking." said 2(X)3 Stanford gradu
ate Ezra Callahan, a former Daily
business manager. "Stanford's inten
tions may not have been bad, but it's
clear that restricting drinking and
partying as they have this decade
does make Stanford less fun."
Callahan pointed to alcohol lia
bilities as the primary catalyst in this
trend.
"Clearly Stanford has gotten a lot
more serious about alcohol from
when 1 was a freshman," Callahan
said. "When I first got to Stanford
people got MlPs and parties got bro
ken up. but the atmosphere felt a lot
more permissive. It was easy for a
freshman to get a beer at the CoHo
and most parties didn't even bother
with wristbands."
Students also cited increased se

curity at Full Moon.
"It can he intimidating to have so
much of a police presence and I think
it's too harsh a stance," said senior
Luis Cerna. "Ultimately most of the
students are going to he OK and it's
supposed to be fun. Hiis year it was
n't as exciting as my freshman year."
However, a number of students
and members of the administration
believe that this supposed discontent
is nothing new. but merely a standard
sentiment of seniors during fall quar
ter.
Dean of Freshman and Transfer
Students Julie Lythcott-Haims dis
missed the concerns of the class of
"oh-seven." saying that seniors give
off the same signs of displeasure al
most every year.
"They are nostalgic for the way
they perceive things were when they
were freshmen," said Lythcott-
Haims, a graduate of the class of
1989. "It gets at their love of the insti
tution and their wanting the fresh
men to have the best possible experi
ence. 1 know of no University con
spiracy to end fun, but I understand
that seniors love the place and can be
nervous or angry about any per
ceived changes."
Lythcott-Haims cited the resur
rection of the Mausoleum Party as
an obvious example of the Universi
ty's concern with social tradition,
countering accusations put forth by
the students.
"Mausoleum, a great Stanford
tradition, was back for the first time
in how many years?" Lythcott-
Haims said. "And the University
completely supported it being back.
1 heart the sound was bad. but it was
n't as if the University pulled the
plug on the speakers."

Jeff Wachtel. senior assistant to
President Hennessy, said th;it while
the University might have aban
doned and changed some of its past
traditions, a number of new activities
and practices have emerged. He ar
gued that recent safety precautions
by the University have not affected
the quality of life for students.
"There are lots of great and fun
things that are happening now that
were not happening years ago and in
many ways this is a less restrictive en
vironment." Wachtel said. "The fact
that we have taken action to make
the corridors safer by asking cyclists
not to park their bicycles there is not
a sign that Stanford is less fun."
Some students attributed recent
complaints to the fact that this year's
senior class was the first freshman
class to undergo the no-alcohol rule
in freshman dorms.
"Had our class not entered Stan
ford in an era of "new restrictions,"
perhaps these minor changes would
be viewed simply as nuisances or
maybe even good policies," said sen
ior class president Paris Ali Mohiud
din.'i think early on many 07-ers in
ternalized the notion that Stanford is
gradually cracking down on fun.This
theme of'cracking down on fun' may
have permeated how seniors now as
sess any new policy or program."
Lythcott-Haims argued that
Stanford's adjustments are a neces
sary reaction to a global trend.
"It may be that students are long
ing for the days of' Animal House,'"
she said. "Hut that movie was a hy
perbole when it came out in 1978 let
alone today. Those days of debauch
ery and recklessness are gone. It's
unrealistic to think that any college
today could operate like that."

plug on the speakers."

Jeff Wachtel. senior assistant to
President Hennessy, said th;it while
the University might have aban
doned and changed some of its past
traditions, a number of new activities
and practices have emerged. He ar
gued that recent safety precautions
by the University have not affected
the quality of life for students.
"There are lots of great and fun
things that are happening now that
were not happening years ago and in
many ways this is a less restrictive en
vironment." Wachtel said. "The fact
that we have taken action to make
the corridors safer by asking cyclists
not to park their bicycles there is not
a sign that Stanford is less fun."
Some students attributed recent
complaints to the fact that this year's
senior class was the first freshman
class to undergo the no-alcohol rule
in freshman dorms.
"Had our class not entered Stan
ford in an era of "new restrictions,"
perhaps these minor changes would
be viewed simply as nuisances or
maybe even good policies," said sen

gradually cracking down on fun.This
theme of'cracking down on fun' may
have permeated how seniors now as
sess any new policy or program."
Lythcott-Haims argued that
Stanford's adjustments are a neces
sary reaction to a global trend.
"It may be that students are long
ing for the days of' Animal House,'"
she said. "Hut that movie was a hy
perbole when it came out in 1978 let
alone today. Those days of debauch
ery and recklessness are gone. It's
unrealistic to think that any college
today could operate like that."

the class of 2007. ranging from the
Hike Ban, fewer Pub Nights and the

students clapped, others booed and
most averted their eyes. Every ob

note: as President Jimmy Carter fa

has struck this year's senior class.

New bike regulations in the Quad area are one in a string of recent University rules that some seniors feel is weakening Stanford's trademark liberal atmos

sity's way of gradually weakening
much of the social scene on campus.
"There seems to have been a shift
this year to no longer treat students
as adults but rather as baby chicks
who are too brittle and irrational to
make their own decisions," said sen
ior Chris Holt, who also writes a col
umn for The Daily.
In addition to seniors, many
alumni feel that Stanford's focus on
academic excellence has forced the
University to alter some of its past
social practices and traditions.
"I think Stanford has become a
lot more serious about keeping its
place as a top undergraduate institu
tion and is convinced that this is mu
tually exclusive from partying and
drinking." said 2(X)3 Stanford gradu
ate Ezra Callahan, a former Daily
business manager. "Stanford's inten
tions may not have been bad, but it's
clear that restricting drinking and
partying as they have this decade
does make Stanford less fun."
Callahan pointed to alcohol lia
bilities as the primary catalyst in this
trend.
"Clearly Stanford has gotten a lot
more serious about alcohol from
when 1 was a freshman," Callahan
said. "When I first got to Stanford
people got MlPs and parties got bro
ken up. but the atmosphere felt a lot
more permissive. It was easy for a
freshman to get a beer at the CoHo
and most parties didn't even bother
with wristbands."
Students also cited increased se

curity at Full Moon.
"It can he intimidating to have so
much of a police presence and I think
it's too harsh a stance," said senior
Luis Cerna. "Ultimately most of the
students are going to he OK and it's
supposed to be fun. Hiis year it was
n't as exciting as my freshman year."
However, a number of students
and members of the administration
believe that this supposed discontent
is nothing new. but merely a standard
sentiment of seniors during fall quar
ter.
Dean of Freshman and Transfer
Students Julie Lythcott-Haims dis
missed the concerns of the class of
"oh-seven." saying that seniors give
off the same signs of displeasure al
most every year.
"They are nostalgic for the way
they perceive things were when they
were freshmen," said Lythcott-
Haims, a graduate of the class of
1989. "It gets at their love of the insti
tution and their wanting the fresh
men to have the best possible experi
ence. 1 know of no University con
spiracy to end fun, but I understand
that seniors love the place and can be
nervous or angry about any per
ceived changes."
Lythcott-Haims cited the resur
rection of the Mausoleum Party as
an obvious example of the Universi
ty's concern with social tradition,
countering accusations put forth by
the students.
"Mausoleum, a great Stanford
tradition, was back for the first time
in how many years?" Lythcott-
Haims said. "And the University
completely supported it being back.
