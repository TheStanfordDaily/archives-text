Calif, native won five straight games to pick up the third

Ignorance is Bliss
The first set was tough, but then in the second
set. I was just getting smoked. [Junior] Phil Kao
came over when things were tough in the second

set. and he said. "You've got to fight here. We
need you." I figured we were having a tough
time in the match. There was a lot of yelling

from the top three courts from fans of both
teams.
I wasn't sure [about the overall score]. I

was thinking about it the whole time, but I
decided not to ask anybody about [the
score] since I didn't want to get distracted.
Hanging Tough

At the very end. it came down to my match
and [senior| l.ric McKean's match — he was on
the court right next to me. After [Eric won), it
came down to me.

During the whole match, 1 wasn't really playing
well, but I just told myself. "Stanford does not lose
to Hawaii." So I stopped thinking about what was
going on and how I was losing.

I was down one break of serve, and then I just told
myself, "Focus really hard on petting one break, and

you're back in this match." 1-4 was a really long game —
I just wanted to win that one game really badly. I didn't
want to have to break at 2*s,because there'd be a lot more
pressure. I told myself that basically it was this game,
otherwise my chances were going to be really slim.
