games. Kaiser decided it was time to focus.The Saratoga.
Calif, native won five straight games to pick up the third
set. the match and the win for the Cardinal.

Ignorance is Bliss
The first set was tough, but then in the second
set. I was just getting smoked. [Junior] Phil Kao
came over when things were tough in the second

set. and he said. "You've got to fight here. We
need you." I figured we were having a tough
time in the match. There was a lot of yelling

from the top three courts from fans of both
teams.
I wasn't sure [about the overall score]. I

was thinking about it the whole time, but I
decided not to ask anybody about [the
score] since I didn't want to get distracted.
Hanging Tough

At the very end. it came down to my match
and [senior| l.ric McKean's match — he was on
the court right next to me. After [Eric won), it
came down to me.

During the whole match, 1 wasn't really playing
well, but I just told myself. "Stanford does not lose
to Hawaii." So I stopped thinking about what was
going on and how I was losing.

I was down one break of serve, and then I just told
myself, "Focus really hard on petting one break, and

you're back in this match." 1-4 was a really long game —
I just wanted to win that one game really badly. I didn't
want to have to break at 2*s,because there'd be a lot more
pressure. I told myself that basically it was this game,
otherwise my chances were going to be really slim.

1 focused so hard during that game,
and when I got it, 1 just never let up.
Island in the Sun
(On the other days], we taught
tennis for three hours every morning
to the alumni who came on the trip,
and then went to the beach almost
every day. We had Thanksgiving din
ner with the [men's and women's]
teams and the alumni and then
played in the Turkey Bowl, which is a
tradition where we divide up into
teams and play football on the beach.
We had a lot of fun and got close
with everyone. I'll probably get used
to that setting of the alumni and the
tennis team [during Thanksgiving]
— it's sort of like a family.
We were Merely Freshmen
One thing that's different [about
the team] this year is that the two
other freshmen are from outside the
US — one's from England, and one's
from Ireland. I don't think we've ever
had foreign players on our team be
fore. We learn a lot of their lingo and
their sense of humor. They're also a
year older than me, so sometimes I
feel like I'm the only freshman, in a
way.
Home of the Champions
[Growing up], 1 was always a fan
of the tennis team, and my mom told
me that [Stanford] would be a good
place to go. At a certain point in high
school, once I realized I had a shot, 1
went for it.
Stanford was always my first
choice, just because it's the best com
bination of academics and athletics
anywhere. It's rare to find a school
that's so good academically but can
also achieve so much success in ath-
ii the same time. And of course,
their > nnis program is probably the
best k nnis program over history.
Playing for the Team
[In college tennis],sometimes you
don't know the people you're playing
against. They're all good, and they
fight hard. But college tennis is much
more fun than tennis in the juniors
where you were pretty much by
yourself, maybe with your [parents].
But here, you're playing for a team,
and I feel a lot of extra motivation
when I 'm playing for the team.
