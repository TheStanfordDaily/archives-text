2 USC 4 Booty nearly blew it, but Smith and Jarrett are unreal.
3 Michigan 1 Oh where, oh where is John Cooper when they need him?
4 LSU 8 Playing like a national champion right now.
5. Florida 3 Best resume of one-loss teams, but keeps winning ugly.
6. Louisville 13 Second life: Big East champs with a West Virginia win.
7. Arkansas 6 Yeah, no QB, but the game's top back and top scheme.
8. Virginia Tech 16 Playing like a top-ten team today.
9. Notre Dame 9 Corner Terrell Lambert + sub-4.5 receiver = toast.
10. Auburn 7 Maybe players will actually go to class with the month-long bye.
11. California 5 Will they score more than Stanford basketball this weekend?
12. Rutgers 15 Would their coach like a job in beautiful Palo Alto?
13. Wake Forest 18 If Reggie Ball plays like usual, they'll be fine.
14. Oklahoma 17 Overcome injuries better than anyone in the country.
15. > A /est Virginia 12 Looking forward to Rutgers a tad? South Florida's not bad.

17. Texas 11 Oops, they did it (Kansas State) again (Texas A&M).
18. Boise State 24 Guess San Jose State is pretty good after all.
19. Tennessee 14 Beat Kentucky by just five? Coaches lose jobs over less.
20. BYU 25 Heart-Stopping win with a last-second touchdown vs. Utah.
21. Nebraska —— Are they back? This weekend will tell the tale.
22. Texas A&IVi — The defense is better than some top-10 teams' (see No. 9).
23. Oregon State — Slow start, but are beating anything and everything now.
23. Penn State — Really, just afraid of a JoePa tirade if we don't rank them.
24. Georgia — Often good, never great, always overshadowed in the SEC.
25. Hawaii — Wait, I thought all they were good for was surfing?
