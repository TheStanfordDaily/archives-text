TEXAS INVITE

Stanford is eager to bring its talent to the invita
tional meet stage.
"We're really excited about this invitational
opportunity," head coach Lea Maurer said. "It's
great to have a chance to go through the champi
onship meet format this early in the season."
The meet presents an opportunity for Stanford
to compete against highly ranked Pac-10 oppo
nents Arizona (3-0), UCLA (4-1) and USC (3-1)
before the dual meets against those teams on Jan.
12,19 and 20. respectively.
"Everyone's really excited because it's a bigger
meet," freshman Elaine Breeden said.
Maurer is especially excited about competing
against the Wildcats, who finished third-ranked
meet by cutting back on their train
ing, Wildman-Tobriner knows the
Cardinal will have to work especial
ly hard against their more-rested
competition.
"Although we will not be rested
for Texas, we still expect to be in con
tention for victories in many events,"
he said.
And they should, since Cardinal
men are seeded first in several
events heading into the meet. Se
niors Shaun Phillips, Andy Grant
and Hongzhe Sun are the favorites
in the 500-yard freestyle, 200
freestyle and 200 backstroke, respec
tively. Meanwhile, sophomores Paul
Kornfeld and Nate Cass will try to
hold off world-record holder Bren

dan Hansen for the win in the 1 (X)
and 2(X) hreaststrokes, respectively.
The Cardinal's 400 medley and 4(H)
freestyle relays also hope to trans
late their top seed into a win.
Though the meet does offer div
ing events, the team's divers will not
he competing this weekend. Howev
er, since teams like Texas and Florida
have entered divers, the Stanford
swimmers will have their work cut
out for them to compensate for the
missing part of their team.
Although this year's team has
undisputable potential, the ability to
translate that potential into fast
swimming is not a given. Wildman-
Tobriner said he thinks that success
at the meet will be a good omen for
the rest of the year.
"Every year's team is different,
and I think how we race against ad
versity in Texas will tell us a lot about
the character of this year's squad,"
he said.
