## Strong field ahead for wrestlers in Las Vegas Stanford tries to keep on track after first Pac-10 win 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After facing their first Pacific-10 Con
ference opponents of the season with a
dual at Cal State-Fullerton and the Fuller
ton Open, the Cardinal wrestling squad
learned a little more about how it stacks up
against the competition.
Stanford (2-2.1-0 Pac-10) came out on
top against the Titans (0-1.0-1 Pac-10) on
Nov. 17 by a score of 29-16. No. 5 All-
Anierican junior Tanner Gardner at 125
pounds, sophomore Rafael Chavez at 141
pounds and senior Brian Perry at 165
pounds each pinned their opponents. Ju
nior Josh Zupancic at 157 pounds and
sophomore Luke Feist at 174 pounds
earned major decisions, and true freshman
Zach Giesen won 6-5 as the Cardinal won
six of 10 matches.
"I think the guys wrestled real well
overall," head coach Kerry McCoy said.
"We still made some mistakes and missed
some opportunities, but to be able to go
down there and wrestle sharp after coming
off of two straight weekends and continue
to improve is big for us.
"Obviously it's a conference match,
which is important, and we're back at .500
with our dual meet record [and it was] a
good chance to go out and keep proving
ourselves," he continued. "To be the best
team in the West, we have to beat teams
like that as we continue to move towards
our goal."
Zupancic's success continued at the
Fullerton Open the next day, where he
went undefeated through five matches. Al
though Cardinal wrestlers picked up 33
wins (four of which were pins), they failed
to place anyone else.
"[Zupancic] continues to get better,"

McCoy said. "He's still got a lot of areas to
work on, as the entire team does, but he
continues to get better and improve. And
when you get a chance to win a tourna
ment. wrestle four or five matches and
come out on top. it's a good showing. Get
ting that confidence is a big step for him in
order to challenge for a Pac-10 title and be
an All-American "
Gardner did not take pari, in the Fuller
ton Open, as he instead traveled to an All-
Star Classic match in Dallas,Tex., where he
faced top-ranked Sam Hazewinkel of Ok
lahoma. Although Gardner lost the match,
4-1. McCoy is still confident that the expe
rience against 1 lazewinkel will prove valu
able for Gardner in the future.
"[Gardner] wrestled tentative," McCoy
said, "But he went out there and proved
again that he can compete with the best
guys in the country. And even though he
fell short and didn't come home with the
win. he definitely learned from the experi
ence. Iliat was a good spot for him to not
only see some good competition but some
body he won't see again [until the end of
the season J."
The Cardinal will next travel to Las
Vegas to take part in the Las Vegas Invita
tional Friday and Saturday. McCoy called
the event "one of the top tournaments in
the country," and a strong showing in Sin
City would be another step in the right di
rection for his young program.
"Ten of the top 15 teams in the country
are going to be there," McCoy said. "It's a
great chance for us to get exposed to that
top level competition and try and build off
of what we did last year and build off of
what we did two weeks ago. It's important
for us to go out there and have a good
showing and prove that we can compete on
an elite level and move closer to our goals."
