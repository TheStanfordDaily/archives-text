A delegation of French businessmen and
scientists were treated to the marvels of Stan
ford's Artificial Intelligence (A 1) Labs yester
day in the Gates Building, where they wit
nessed innovative technologies in the field of
human-friendly robotics.
The delegation was brought to the Bay Area
by the Paris Region International Mission En
terprise (PRIME), whose San Francisco office,
the first in the United States, is opening today.
PRIME used this opportunity to build links be
tween representatives of leading French tech
nology ventures and those carrying out cutting

edge research in the Bay Area.
The delegates were given ;i presentation by
computer science Prof.Oussama Khatib. whose
lab focuses on human-friendly robot design, be
fore being shown some of the lab's prototypes.
One such device was a new control interface
that provided finely tuned feedback on the tex
ture of a three-dimensional object the cursor
was touching onscreen. Dr. Khatib likened the
device to "holding a stick and prodding the ob
jects on the screen" and said that it could be
useful for doctors performing surgery with re
mote-controlled apparatus.
Other devices included a pair of robots,
named Romeo and Juliet, which could move
freely in a cluttered space and manipulate ob
jects just like a human hand.and a machine arm
that responded to the movement of a pen-like
controller.
