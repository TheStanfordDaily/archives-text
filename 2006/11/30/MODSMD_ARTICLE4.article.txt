## Robotics attracts business French business firm scopes out cutting-edge technology 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
A delegation of French businessmen and
scientists were treated to the marvels of Stan
ford's Artificial Intelligence (A 1) Labs yester
day in the Gates Building, where they wit
nessed innovative technologies in the field of
human-friendly robotics.
The delegation was brought to the Bay Area
by the Paris Region International Mission En
terprise (PRIME), whose San Francisco office,
the first in the United States, is opening today.
PRIME used this opportunity to build links be
tween representatives of leading French tech
nology ventures and those carrying out cutting

edge research in the Bay Area.
The delegates were given ;i presentation by
computer science Prof.Oussama Khatib. whose
lab focuses on human-friendly robot design, be
fore being shown some of the lab's prototypes.
One such device was a new control interface
that provided finely tuned feedback on the tex
ture of a three-dimensional object the cursor
was touching onscreen. Dr. Khatib likened the
device to "holding a stick and prodding the ob
jects on the screen" and said that it could be
useful for doctors performing surgery with re
mote-controlled apparatus.
Other devices included a pair of robots,
named Romeo and Juliet, which could move
freely in a cluttered space and manipulate ob
jects just like a human hand.and a machine arm
that responded to the movement of a pen-like
controller.
Frederic La Roux, CEO of PRIME, was
looking forward to the fruits of yes
terday's visit.
"Here you've got a very brilliant
professor at Stanford University ex
plaining the results of his research to a
hunch of very brilliant professors from
France," he said. "It's just a peer to
peer meeting and it's our job to make
it happen. And sooner or later, some
collaborations could come out of this
that would help both communities."
PRIME'S San Francisco office
will provide consulting services to
American companies that are inter
ested in expanding their activities in
the Paris region, providing advice on
anything from scouting a location to
complying with European regula
tions. They also intend to act as a liai
son for French companies seeking to
establish links with Bay Area firms.
According to La Roux.San Fran
cisco held many attractions for their
venture. For their first U.S. outing,
the group wanted an office on the
West Coast, which is not as easily ac
cessible to European businesses. Ad
ditionally, they wanted to focus on IT
and biotechnology, making the Bay
Area an optimal candidate.
"And of course," La Roux contin
ued. "Stanford is one of the most
brilliant universities in the world.
Hie fact that Stanford is here and
fuels the start-up process and tech
nology transfer and fuels the whole
area is very significant, one of the
prime reasons for being here."
In addition to the A 1 Labs, the
delegation also visited Stanford's
Office of Technology Transfers.
Today, they will go to the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory and
the California Institute for Quantita
tive Biomedical Research.
Mark Bonneville, who heads a
biotechnology lab for French re
search institute Inserm, was im
pressed by the possibilities Stanford

offers.
"Actually we already have a num
ber of collaborations between In
serm laboratories and various pri
vate and public partners in Califor
nia," he said. "And we're impressed
by the flexibility and openness of the
structure and the willingness of the

Technology Transfer office to pro
mote as much as possible the diffu
sion of information."
For his part, Prof. Khatib is used
to hosting delegations from around
the world.
"We host all kind of visits, from
Japanese delegations. Korean dele

gations. Next month we're hosting a
Chinese visit. We host alumni every
year. We host high schools some
times. We have a very open environ
ment for showing off the lab. And in
some cases, we also establish con
tacts that result in research projects
and collaborations.
