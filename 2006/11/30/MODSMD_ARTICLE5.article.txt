## Mirrielees worried over theft Multiple cases of stolen clothes leave residents hung out to dry 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
Missing socks are an annoyance, but the res
idents of Mirrielees have had a little more to
complain about. In recent weeks, hundreds of
dollars worth of clothing and lingerie have dis
appeared from the second floor laundry room.
Senior Catherine l islH-r was the most recent
victim of a string of theft that has left Mirrielees
residents on alert.
"I was leaving for a debate tournament
Thursday night before Thanksgiving, and I had
put my clothes in the wash right before I had to
leave," Fisher said."l moved it from the washer
to the dryer at around 5:20 p.m. Five minutes
after the dryer stopped, some of my clothes
were stolen."
Someone had made off with a pair of Fx

press dress pants and two pairs of jeans, togeth
er worth about $100, she said.
Fisher emailed the dorm list, but her com
plaint was nothing new.'lTie dinnertime thief.or
thieves, has struck at least two other times in
the same laundry room between 5 and 7 p.m.,
targeting Fix press brand clothing and other ex
pensive apparel. In each case, the victims had
not left their clothes unattended for more than
15 minutes after the dryers were scheduled to
stop.
Five weeks ago. senior Jessica Flores found
her I • xpress dress shirts and dress pants missing
from the dryer in the second floor laundry
room. Only a few days later, her roommate,
Nahid Yakuby, found her Express pants and
$350 worth of Nike sportswear stolen from the
wash.
"There were specific items taken from dif
ferent loads." Yakuby said. "Whoever took my
clothes must have went through my loads and
picked out what they wanted."
According to Yakuby.after the first fourcom-
plaints of lifted clothing, Mirrielees
Resident Assistants sent out a mass
email warning residents to watch
their laundry closely and to keep the
laundry room door shut tight.
Yakuby, however, said she had
never seen the door propped open in
the laundry room where all three in
cidents occurred. According to Flo
res, the only other way to enter the

room is with a dorm key or through
a small balcony two stories high.
"It makes us think someone in
the dorm — someone with keys —
is getting in there," Flores said.
After yet another few possible in
cidences of theft, dorm staff told vic
tims to consider filing a police report.
"1 kind of wish 1 had filed a police
report [at the time of the theft],"
Yakuby said.
Stanford police deputy Ken
Bates said only one case of laundry
theft has been reported this quarter,
but not from Mirrielees. In his expe
rience at Stanford, there has never

been a reported crime wave of this
nature. Bates said students must tile
reports with specific information on
the time and location of the inci
dences so police can determine
whether or not it is a pattern.
"They need to report it so we can
apprehend the criminal." Bates said.
"Maybe [the perpetrator] is someone
who's just testing the waters, thinking,
If 1 can get away with this, maybe
next time I'll try a locked door.
"If we do establish that it is a pat
tern." he added, "we can get some
surveillance in there and catch the
person."
