## Meeting with al-Maliki postponed Cancellation comes on heels of leaked memo critical of Iraqi prime minister 
### TOM RAUM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
AMMAN. Jordan —By the time President
Bush's long motorcade roared up the pri
vate road to King Abdullah IPs hillside
palace, the Iraqi prime minister's motor
cade had already roared down it.
So much for the first of two high-expec
tation meetings between Bush and Nouri
al-Maliki.
Accounts varied on who canceled
Wednesday's three-way meeting—and why.
But it was generally viewed as a bad
omen for efforts to find a new strategy for
controllingspiraling violence in Iraq.
The cancellation came on the same day
as disclosure of a classified White House
document critical of Maliki and a political
boycott in Baghdad protesting his atten
dance.
Instead of two days of talks. Bush and al-
Maliki will have breakfast and a single meet
ing followed by a news conference on Thurs
day morning, the White 1 louse said.
The abrupt change was an almost un
heard development in the high-level diplo
matic circles of a U.S. president, a king and
a prime minister. There was confusion —
and conflicting explanations—about what
happened.
Bush had been scheduled to meet with
al-Maliki and Jordan's King Abdullah on
Wednesday night, and had rearranged his
schedule to be in Amman for both days for
talks aimed at reducing the spiral of vio
lence in Iraq.
The cancellation was not announced
until Bush had already come to Raghadan
Palace and posed for photographs alone
with the king.
White I louse counselor Dan Bartlett de
nied that the delay was a snub by al-Maliki
directed at Bush or was related to the leak
of a memo written by White 1 louse Nation
al Security Adviser Stephen Hadley ques
tioning the prime minister's capacity for
controlling violence in Iraq.
"Absolutely not." Bartlett said." He said
the king and the prime minister had met be
fore Bush arrived from a NATO summit in
Latvia. "That negated the purpose to meet
tonight together in a trilateral setting."
A senior administration official, who
spoke with U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zal
mav Khalilzad, basically echoed Bartlett's

account.
The Jordanians and the Iraqis jointly de
cided it was not the best use of time because
they both would be seeing the president
separately,said the official.
Members of the Jordanian and Iraqi del
egations contacted Khalilzad, who called
Air Force One and spoke with Bush and
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, giving
them a heads-up, the official said.
I lowever. Redha JawadTaqi.a senior aide
of top Shiite politician Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim
who also was in Amman, said the Iraqis
balked at the three-way meeting after learn
ing the king wanted to broaden the talks to in
clude the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Two senior officials traveling with al-
Maliki. who spoke on condition of
anonymity because of the sensitivity of the
information, said the prime minister had
been reluctant to travel to Jordan in the first
place and decided, once in Amman, that he

did not want "a third party" involved in
talks about subjects specific to the U.S.-
Iraqi relationship.
With al-Maliki already gone from the
palace. Bush h;>d an abbreviated meeting
and dinner wit I - the king before heading
early to his hotel.
The cancellation came after the disclo
sure of a classified White 1 louse memo, writ
ten Nov. 8 by Uadley. In one particularly
harsh section. I ladley asserted: "The reality
on the streets of Baghdad suggests Maliki is
either ignorant of what is going on. misrep
resenting his intentions or that his capabili
ties are not yet sufficient to turn his good in
tentions into action."
Administration officials did not dispute
the leaked account, saying that on balance
the document was supportive of the Iraqi
leader and generally portrayed him as well
meaning.
Ihe president "has confidence in Prime

Minister Maliki." said Bush spokesman Tony
Snow, who added that al-Maliki "has been
very aggressive in recent weeks in taking on
some of the key challenges."
The memo recommended steps to
strengthen the Iraqi leader's position, in
cluding possibly sending more troops to de
fend Baghdad and providing monetary sup
port for moderate political candidates for
Iraq's parliament.
The Iraqi prime minister also faced po
litical pressure at home about the summit.
Thirty Iraqi lawmakers and five cabinet
ministers loyal to anti-American cleric
Muqtada al-Sadr said they were boycotting
Parliament and the government to protest
al-Maliki's presence at the summit.
Bartlett said that Wednesday night's
three-way meeting had always been
planned as "more of a social meeting" and
that Bush and Maliki on Thursday would
have a "robust" meeting on their own.

The Jordanians and the Iraqis jointly de
cided it was not the best use of time because
they both would be seeing the president
separately,said the official.
Members of the Jordanian and Iraqi del
egations contacted Khalilzad, who called
Air Force One and spoke with Bush and
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, giving
them a heads-up, the official said.
I lowever. Redha JawadTaqi.a senior aide
of top Shiite politician Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim
who also was in Amman, said the Iraqis
balked at the three-way meeting after learn
ing the king wanted to broaden the talks to in
clude the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Two senior officials traveling with al-
Maliki. who spoke on condition of
anonymity because of the sensitivity of the
information, said the prime minister had
been reluctant to travel to Jordan in the first
place and decided, once in Amman, that he

did not want "a third party" involved in
talks about subjects specific to the U.S.-
Iraqi relationship.
With al-Maliki already gone from the
palace. Bush h;>d an abbreviated meeting
and dinner wit I - the king before heading
early to his hotel.
The cancellation came after the disclo
sure of a classified White 1 louse memo, writ
ten Nov. 8 by Uadley. In one particularly
harsh section. I ladley asserted: "The reality
on the streets of Baghdad suggests Maliki is
either ignorant of what is going on. misrep
resenting his intentions or that his capabili
ties are not yet sufficient to turn his good in
tentions into action."
Administration officials did not dispute
the leaked account, saying that on balance
the document was supportive of the Iraqi
leader and generally portrayed him as well
meaning.
Ihe president "has confidence in Prime

Minister Maliki." said Bush spokesman Tony
Snow, who added that al-Maliki "has been
very aggressive in recent weeks in taking on
some of the key challenges."
The memo recommended steps to
strengthen the Iraqi leader's position, in
cluding possibly sending more troops to de
fend Baghdad and providing monetary sup
port for moderate political candidates for
Iraq's parliament.
The Iraqi prime minister also faced po
litical pressure at home about the summit.
Thirty Iraqi lawmakers and five cabinet
ministers loyal to anti-American cleric
Muqtada al-Sadr said they were boycotting
Parliament and the government to protest
al-Maliki's presence at the summit.
Bartlett said that Wednesday night's
three-way meeting had always been
planned as "more of a social meeting" and
that Bush and Maliki on Thursday would
have a "robust" meeting on their own.
