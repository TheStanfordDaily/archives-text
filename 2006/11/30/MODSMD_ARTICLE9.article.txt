# Al-Qaida alive and well in Somalia, U.S. says
## Secular government there lacks authority 
### GEORGE GEDDA ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON—AI-Qaida mili
tants are operating with "great com
fort" in Somalia, providing training
and assistance to a radical military
element loyal to the Islamic group
that controls most of southern So
malia. a senior State Department
official said Wednesday.
Jendayi Frazer, who heads the
department's Africa bureau, said a

priority U.S. goal is the capture of
three militants wanted for the
bombings of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and a
hotel in Kenya in 2002. The three
are from Sudan, Kenya and the
Comoros Islands.
"We're continuing to work with
all sides in Somalia to try get those
terrorists turned over and to pre
vent Somalia from becoming a safe
haven." Frazer told a small group of
reporters.
She emphasized that the al-
Qaida presence goes well beyond
the three suspects.
The administration has looked
on with anxiety as Islamic mili

tants, operating under the umbrel
la of the Union of Islamic Courts
(UIC). have expanded their zone
of influence in the country while
marginalizing a secular govern
ment that lacks authority despite
the backing of the United Nations
and the United States.
The secular authority, known
as the transitional federal govern
ment. is based in the western So
mali town of Baidoa.
I lie administration supports
the creation of an African force,
totaling a battalion or two, to train
and protect the transition govern
ment. The goal is to establish a
balance in Somalia that would

convince the Islamists that a mili
tary victory is impossible, thus
creating conditions for a negotiat
ed settlement between the two.
Hie African Union and the In
tergovernmental Authority on
Development, a seven-nation
East African group, originally
proposed deployment of an
African force in Somalia.
The Islamists said in June they
had no interest in forming a gov
ernment but their actions since
then suggest otherwise, the admin
istration believes. The rise of the
UIC over the past six months has
alarmed non-Muslim countries
throughout East Africa and gen

crated fears of armed conflict
throughout the region.
From the outset, the United
States has supported a dialogue
between the Islamists and the
transition government.
In a statement Tuesday night,
the State Department said the
"continued military expansion by
the UIC has prevented this dia
logue from moving forward and
has created the need for deploy
ment of a regional force.
"The force will deter further
aggression against the transition
government, create the required
space for dialogue and stabilize
the situation."
