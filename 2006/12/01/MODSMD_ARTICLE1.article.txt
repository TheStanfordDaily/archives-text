We believe in Stanford football. So says this year's slo
gan to fire up support for Big Game.
But unless Belief can bench 250. run a 4.4 40-yard dash
and clone himself 21 times. Big Game may turn into a big
Cal rout.
California (8-3.6-2 Pac-10) will host the 109 th install
ment of the nation's lOth-longest rivalry as a four-touch
down favorite, despite two straight losses. Stanford (1-10,
1-7). meanwhile, will look to salvage a sliver of pride in a
season where nothing has gone right.
Hie Bears last played two weeks ago. losing 23-9
against USC in a game more hotly contested than the
final score indicated. The previous week, however, Cal
uncharacteristically came out flat, and the offense never
sparked in a 24-20 shocker at lowly Arizona.
Tennessee demolished visiting Cal 35-18 in both
teams' season opener, and the aftertaste stuck with the
Bears and the Pac-10's national reputation for weeks. Cal
did rally though, winning eight straight to enter the
fringes of the national title discussion before its recent
setbacks.
After a slow start, quarterback Nate Longshore has
strung together yet another remarkable season for a

quarterback under Cal Coach Jeff Tedford. With a 142.4
efficiency rating and 2,569 passing yards this season.
Longshore appears to be following in the footsteps of
Trent Dilfer, Akili Smith. Joey Harrington. David Carr,
Kyle Boiler and Aaron Rodgers, all Tedford proteges with
NFL starts under their belts.
Star sophomore receiver DeSean Jackson (852 yards,
nine touchdowns) and tailback Marshawn Lynch (1.464

total yards. 13 touchdowns) are Cal's other offensive
standouts,and cornerback Daymeion Hughes is arguably
the conference's top defender. Judging by past games this
season, the Bears may well come out with a conservative
game plan,content to gash Stanford with the run until the
Cardinal prove they can stop it.


ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Quarterback T.C. Ostrander will look to end Cal's Big Game winning-streak at four this Saturday in Berkeley, as he leads
the Cardinal against a Cal squad that has accepted its invitation to play in the Holiday Bowl against Texas A&M.
For the Cardinal, the rush defense has im
proved from horrific to mediocre with the
changing of the leaves, though opponents have
now started to exploit a porous pass defense
more aggressively. Senior linebacker Michael
Okwo,six months away from a seven-figure NFL
signing bonus, is one of few defenders who
would start for many other Pac-10 schools.
On offense, junior signal-caller T.C. Ostrander
has struggled with tailbacks—junior Anthony
Kimble and freshman Toby Gerhart — who have
not broken many tackles, an offensive line that
has not blocked many rushers and a young re
ceiving corps that has not shed many defensive
backs. All told, the Cardinal average 10 points,
229 yards and nearly six punts per game.
New Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby has re
fused to publicly back Coach Walt Harris,stating
only that he does not evaluate coaches midsea
son. Bowlsby's silence raises questions,but it still

seems likelier than not that Harris will return for
his third season on the Farm next year.
Last year, Cal dominated the Cardinal on the
line of scrimmage — racking up 226 rushing
yards and nine sacks — to shut Stanford out of a
bowl, 27-3.
The Bears have won the last four Big Games,

Cardinal prove they can stop it.


ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Quarterback T.C. Ostrander will look to end Cal's Big Game winning-streak at four this Saturday in Berkeley, as he leads
the Cardinal against a Cal squad that has accepted its invitation to play in the Holiday Bowl against Texas A&M.
For the Cardinal, the rush defense has im
proved from horrific to mediocre with the
changing of the leaves, though opponents have
now started to exploit a porous pass defense
more aggressively. Senior linebacker Michael
Okwo,six months away from a seven-figure NFL
signing bonus, is one of few defenders who
would start for many other Pac-10 schools.
On offense, junior signal-caller T.C. Ostrander
has struggled with tailbacks—junior Anthony
Kimble and freshman Toby Gerhart — who have
not broken many tackles, an offensive line that
has not blocked many rushers and a young re
ceiving corps that has not shed many defensive
backs. All told, the Cardinal average 10 points,
229 yards and nearly six punts per game.
New Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby has re
fused to publicly back Coach Walt Harris,stating
only that he does not evaluate coaches midsea
son. Bowlsby's silence raises questions,but it still

seems likelier than not that Harris will return for
his third season on the Farm next year.
Last year, Cal dominated the Cardinal on the
line of scrimmage — racking up 226 rushing
yards and nine sacks — to shut Stanford out of a
bowl, 27-3.
The Bears have won the last four Big Games,
