## Bedbugs infest East Flo Student rooms quarantined, four relocated to new dorms 
### SAM BHAGWAT STAFF WRITER 
More than 20 sealed plastic bags filled
with notebooks, textbooks and linens sat
outside two quarantined East Florence
Moore doubles last night; their four occu
pants had been sent to live in other dormito
ries around campus after University officials
discovered their rooms had been infested by
bedbugs earlier this week.

Exterminator Rich Crane was working in
the rooms last night, which smelled of chem
icals and had stripped-down plastic hags on
the beds and clothes still hanging from
stands.
One exiled student agreed to speak with
The Daily but asked to remain anonymous,
fearing that people would mistakenly think
she was contagious.
"At first, everyone was really scared
about it," she said. "People were afraid to
touch us. When we were leaving they were
like,'air hug.'"
Bedbugs are five to seven-millimeter
long insects that suck blood out of humans,
usually at night. ITiey are not contagious,

though they lay eggs in clothes, making in
festations transmittable it dormmates bor
row one another's apparel.
An infestation that occurred in Lagunita
was detected earlier this year, hut the exiled
student said something has been amiss in
East Flo since September.
"I started getting bites two weeks ago,"
she said. "But the room next to mine got it
from the beginning."
Her neighbors, finding mosquito bite-like
marks on their body, became concerned and
went to Vaden, where they were told nothing
was wrong. The problem only came to light
