## Bedbugs infest East Flo Student rooms quarantined, four relocated to new dorms 
### SAM BHAGWAT STAFF WRITER 
More than 20 sealed plastic bags filled
with notebooks, textbooks and linens sat
outside two quarantined East Florence
Moore doubles last night; their four occu
pants had been sent to live in other dormito
ries around campus after University officials
discovered their rooms had been infested by
bedbugs earlier this week.

Exterminator Rich Crane was working in
the rooms last night, which smelled of chem
icals and had stripped-down plastic hags on
the beds and clothes still hanging from
stands.
One exiled student agreed to speak with
The Daily but asked to remain anonymous,
fearing that people would mistakenly think
she was contagious.
"At first, everyone was really scared
about it," she said. "People were afraid to
touch us. When we were leaving they were
like,'air hug.'"
Bedbugs are five to seven-millimeter
long insects that suck blood out of humans,
usually at night. ITiey are not contagious,

though they lay eggs in clothes, making in
festations transmittable it dormmates bor
row one another's apparel.
An infestation that occurred in Lagunita
was detected earlier this year, hut the exiled
student said something has been amiss in
East Flo since September.
"I started getting bites two weeks ago,"
she said. "But the room next to mine got it
from the beginning."
Her neighbors, finding mosquito bite-like
marks on their body, became concerned and
went to Vaden, where they were told nothing
was wrong. The problem only came to light
his arm.
In Lagunita, freshman Riah
Forbes had a similar experience.
When her room was infected with
bedbugs, her roommate went to
Vaden and was diagnosed with hives.
Forbes only discovered the problem
later when she found a bedbug.
TTiough the residents were med
ically sound, the infestation forced
them to leave their rooms last Sun
day. Because of the quarantine, they
could not take any of their belong
ings to their new residences across
campus.
"In the beginning.it was absolute

ly terrible, I'm not going to lie," the
East Flo resident said. "But what
made it easier to adjust to this new
life was the way housing reacted. It
felt like they understood what you
were going through."
She said that having all of her
hooks and notes unavailable compli
cated her studies.
"It's been okay being secluded,
but [the situation] does affect me ac
ademically," she said. "But my pro
fessors are really nice."
ITie quarantine process will end
six weeks after it began last Sunday.
The rooms will be torn apart, with
the carpets ripped out, furniture re
moved and walls repainted.
"We're doing the entire process
that needs to take place to make sure
that the bedbugs are gone," said As
sistant Director for Housing Opera

tions Imogen 1 lind. "It's a more cost
ly operation, but it's one we feel
needs to be done in order to ensure
that the bedbugs don't return."
Hind and Housing Director
Roger Whitney also stressed student
awareness about how to detect bed
bugs, and urged students to tell the
proper authorities if they detected
any.
"The bedbugs come into the
building with people, and they can
spread through bed linen and into
wood," Whitney said." If students see
symptoms like spots of blood on
clothing or rashes, they need to get
medical attention."
Though the infestation was a
major disruption to her life, the East-
Flo resident said that she tried to
take the ordeal lightheartedly.
"You can't top that," she laughed.
