stressed the importance of stable construc
tion. reliable building materials and archi
tectural expertise in averting humanitarian
tragedies after natural disasters in a Pigott
Hall speech last night.
llie event, sponsored by a broad coali
tion of campus groups including the Armen
ian Students Association (ASA). Blume
Earthquake Engineering Center. Sanksriti.
Six Degrees and Engineers for a Sustainable
World, was half of a two-part event entitled
"Mitigating Natural Disasters: Lessons from
the Armenian Earthquake."
"The range of groups that had a role in
organising this event reflects the impact nat
ural disasters can have on all segments ol so
ciety ajtvund the globe, making the message
we wanted to send all the more powerful,"
said senior Seepan Parseghian, ASA presi
dent.
The discussion was combined with a two
day photo exhibit to honor the victims of the
1988 Armenian earthquake and to under
stand its consequences in light of recent nat
ural disasters in New Orleans in 2005 and
the Indian Coast the year before.
The photo exhibit's aim was to provide
visual images of the poverty and damage
caused by the earthquake. Raffi

Mardirosian, ASA member and organizer of
the gallery, was pleased with the exhibit's
turnout and impact.
"I think it went well," he said. "A lot of
people were able to see that people have
nothing in Armenia. The pictures really
show the infrastructure damage and the
state of ruin."

While the photo exhibit attracted a more
general audience, the speaker event was tar
geted toward engineers, emphasizing their
importance as potential contributors to fu
ture earthquake security policies.
"Non-traditional security threats like
natural disasters are costing the global com
munity an increasing number of lives, and
engineers have a crucial role in preventing
this trend from worsening, especially in de
veloping nations, where the engineering ex
pertise offered at institutions like Stanford is
not available for the local populations to
use," Parseghian said.
Kiremidjian. a faculty member at the
Blume Earthquake Engineering Center,
emphasized the importance of infrastruc
ture stability and discussed the economic,
social and political contexts surrounding the
Armenianearthquake.
"It is important to understand where a
country is located and its political setting
when an earthquake occurs," said Kiremid
jian.
Eighteen years ago, Armenia, a member
of the now-defunct USSR, was struck with
an earthquake that leveled its northern re
gions. causing thousands of causalities and
displacing many more refugees.
Kiremidjian estimated that 40 percent of
Armenia was affected. Twenty-five thou
sand people were killed. 514,000 were left
without shelter and 1.1% buildings were de
stroyed in just one city of Leninakan, Arme
nia. By contrast, an earthquake of the same
magnitude struck San Francisco, Calif., the
following year and killed 64 people.
