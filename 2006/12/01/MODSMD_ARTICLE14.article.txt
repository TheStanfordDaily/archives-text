Students may be forgiven for expressing
more confusion than usual at the Intersec

They can thank the trumpet section of the
Stanford Band, which constructed the

wooden roundabout in honor of Saturday's
football game against the DC-Berkeley.
Hie structure, a hexagonal wooden base
topped by a figure wearing a Santa hat and
holding a trumpet, was built as one of the
Band's Big Game Projects. Each section de
signs and builds something on campus, and
the "Trumpz" said they wanted to do some
thing for "public safety."
The idea for the project came from band

sports writer. Designed by trumpet
section member Blake English, it was
constructed in about four hours on
Tuesday night. Photographic evi
dence suggests that the structure was
transported to the Intersection of
Death via wheeled chairs, though
Bland claimed in an interview with
The Daily that it was done by "hyp
notism."
English refused to discuss the
other projects, but said that the
roundabout was "one of the more
public ones."
Students said they were delighted
with the idea.
"I think it makes the intersection
safer." said sophomore Tammy
Kwan.
"I'm surprised that the University
itself never did something like this
before," said Jenny Arriola, another
sophomore.
Others were befuddled. Manv cv

clists went the wrong way around or
ignored the structure altogether.
"People don't know what they're
supposed to do," said senior C icorgia
Duan. "Foreign students seem to un
derstand it. but you just don't see
roundabouts very much in the U.S.
Are pedestrians supposed to follow
it? Also, there are no entrances."
In response to these criticisms, the
creators suggested that people "look
up the definition of a roundabout on
the Internet" and said that it should
n't be that difficult to navigate.
"See this arrow pointing right?"
said Joel Cretan, a junior. "It means
go right"
Ilie structure is here to stay, ac
cording to band members, at least for
the time being.
"As much as we would like to
have the trophy, we care too much
about public safety to remove it,"
said band member Eric Wooley.a co
terminal student in mechanical engi
neering. "But if the administration
wants us to build more, we'll be more
than happy to."
University officials did not return
calls with requests for comment.
