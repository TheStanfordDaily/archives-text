"Our goal is not just to make it the biggest issue for
this one day but make it something higher up on the
agenda permanently. We want to get students involved
in a long-term, serious way."

In the evening. Dr. Leonard I lerzenberg. Emeritus
Prof, of (ienetics at the School of Medicine, will lead a
discussion confronting the issue of how to address
lIIV/AIDS globally in Wallenberg Hall. Herzenberg
developed and continues to work on Fluorescence-
Activated Cell Sorting, a method used to diagnosis
and monitor treatment of
HIV/AIDS.
He noted that although treat
ments for the disease are becoming
available in wealthy countries such
as the United States, most others are
left out in the cold.
"For poor countries as in Africa,
most treatments are not given or af
fordable," he said. Herzenberg
praised charitable organizations
like FACE AIDS, the Gates Foun
dation and the Clinton Foundation
for helping garner attention for the
issue.
Dorsey expressed high hopes for
the day's events.
"To be blunt, last year's World
AIDS Day on campus was not
huge," he said."We certainly want to
make it a bigger thing this year, and
even bigger next year, until one day
it gets the billing it truly deserves."
