## Editorial Board Bring back the band 
### 
This weekend, the saddest loss at Big
Game will not be our defeat to Cal.
but the absence of the Stanford
Band's antics at halftime. As one of the
defining symbols of our school, the Band
plays a significant role in galvanizing the
student section at games. Benching the
Band can only serve to lower student
morale, and it is necessary for all parties to
consider a different way of resolving the
current situation.
According to a recent Faculty Senate rt. -
port, traditional Band activities, such as
their football halftime show, will go on hia
tus until a Band Reinstatement committee
is formed to oversee Band operations. But
such a University-run committee contra
dicts the essential essence of the Band.
School administrators have traditionally
played a relatively minimal role in regulat
ing the Band, and should ideally continue to
do so. Stanford is an institution with a rare
reputation of being both brainy and bold
when it comes to its student livelihood, and
University officials should make every ef
fort to leave the administration of the Band
to its student members.
At the same time, the Band needs to en
sure that its sense of humor is not destruc
tive. Somewhere along the line, its shenani
gans just stopped being funny. Banned from
several major airlines and multiple public
places, the Band has long had a reputation
for being irreverent almost to the point of
disrespect. Over the years, it managed to

walk the fine line between legal trouble and
creative humor, and is still well-loved on
campus us one of the few remaining bas
tions of gleeful audacity. However, the re
cent vandalism of its own Shak speaks vol
umes about the extent to which the Band
has spiraled out of control.
At this point, the Band needs to cut its
losses and find a way to work with school
administrators so that the student body can
have its zan\ musicians back where they be
long— making a ruckus and taunting the
starched and serious Cal band. The best
compromise to preserve both the Band's
iJentit) and still allow University officials
to restore confidence in the Band may in
volve designing the proposed Reinstate
ment Committee to be 50 percent current
Band members and 50 percent Band alum
ni. In this way. student autonomy can be
preserved in a productive and preventive
manner. In the end. alums who understand
both the history of the Band and the need
for self-restraint may be the best bet for cre
ating a regulatory working group to keep
the Band out of any serious trouble. Such a
group would only be temporary, with advi
sory responsibility until the Band lands it
self safely in the University's good graces
again.
With the Big Game right around the cor
ner. it is high time for the University and the
Band to strike a compromise, so we can fi
nally bring the Band back into the game
where it belongs.
