# You can't go home again
## 
### 
Fur many of you, this depressing adage
probably reared its head early last
week as you traveled across the coun
try to eat at your parents' dining room table
and sleep amidst your old stuffed animals.
For me. however, these famous words have
a slightly different meaning. After all. as 1
revealed last week, my parents' house is lit
erally down the street (albeit a very long
one).
I lome is where, when you go there, they
have to take you in.
The words of Robert Frost echoed in my
mind this past September when I returned
to the Farm to earn my master's in English.
After two years in the real world, the open
arms of this home — my home away from
home — looked more appealing than ever.
On the surface, little has changed in the
past three years. Palm Drive is still gor
geous. the Quad is still standing and the bi
cycles are still everywhere (though, thanks
to a new policy, not around the Quad).
But as 1 drove toward the familiar sand
stone buildings on my first day of class, I felt
strikingly out of place. What was it that had
changed so much? If it wasn't Stanford, then
it had to be me. Given that. I wondered, would
I ever be comfortable in the nest again?
1 parked atop the repaved Encina tennis
courts and ambled in the general direction
of Fncina Hall. According to my thorough
ly highlighted Tune Schedule (some things
never change), my first graduate seminar
was to meet in Encina W2()b. Too proud to
ask for directions, I wandered the halls for
20 minutes before I located the room.
Three years as a tour guide and I still got
lost on my way to class.
When class introductions began a few mo
ments later, the surreal quality of my experi
ence deepened. I felt old. At 24.1 was the sec
ond-eldest student in the program and.
thanks to two years of teaching high-school
Fnglish, I held more professional experience
than five-sixths of the class combined.
Following introductions, the professor
initiated a discussion about academia, the
humanities and the university's connection
to the world at large. One student waxed po
etic about the emotional value of beauty
while another unequivocally announced
that the study of the humanities "makes
good people."
As much as I wanted to agree with them
on principle. 1 was painfully aware of a dif
ferent reality. Compared to life in the fren
zied trenches of a high school classroom, the
peaceful bubble in which we sat seemed in
significant and unproductive. In the grand
scheme of things, the discussion itself
seemed trivial. "Who am I helping?" I kept
thinking. "What am I contributing to the
world by being here?"
I walked toward the Bookstore with these
difficult questions ringing in my ears. The
helmetless bikers speeding by were no
longer my friends and classmates, and their
blissful faces only furthered my sense of
alienation.
"Miss M!"

I turned to see a former student of mine.
"Ashley! How are you?"
"I'm great. Overwhelmed and under -
slept, but great."
As I listened to her talk about IHUM,
PWR and life in Branner, I heard a familiar
experience underlying the updated
acronyms and renovated housing. The ex
citement of encountering new ideas, the
thrill of discovering academic passions, the
sheer joy of living in a community of caring,
impassioned individuals — this was the
Stanford I 'd come back to find.
A man's homeland is wherever he pros
pers.
Inspired by my conversation with Ashley
and mindful of Aristophanes (the author of
the quote above), I determined to seek out
opportunities that would put me back in
touch with the ecstasy of discovery. Al
though I know Margaret Jacks like the back
of my hand. I enrolled in classes taught by
three professors I'd never met, and this
quarter marks my first English class with
more men than women. I applied to write a
column for The Daily, something I'd always
wanted to do as an undergrad (seriously),
and I joined a grad student reading group.
Among these new configurations of the
Stanford community, I have found the intel
lectual passions I'd missed so sorely over the
past three years.
Ok. that was a bit melodramatic, I know,
but I bet many of you encountered the same
truth last week, you don't know what you've
got until it's gone. For all the stress-inducing
finals and term papers, Stanford and its sun
drenched version of home will look just as
comforting and luxurious in a few years as
your high-school bed does now.
A man travels the world over in search of
what he needs and returns home to find it.
There are still moments when I feel a
strong urge to facilitate a classroom discus
sion rather than participate in it, when I won
der how deciphering Derrida will impact the
rest of my life, when I feel acutely aware of
the real world that awaits me in June, but my
distance from and anxiety about the present
have given way to sheer gratitude for the
chance to be here right now.
Walking through the Quad yesterday, I ran
in to another former student of mine. "Isn't
it weird to be back here?" she asked.
"Sort of." I said, "but there's no place like
home."

As much as she loves coming home, Lisa
Mendelman is struggling to remember how to
write a term paper. Suggestions for thesis state
ments can be mailed to lisame@stanford.edu.
