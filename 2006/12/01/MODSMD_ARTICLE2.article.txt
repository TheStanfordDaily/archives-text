# Time for Sherman to shine

### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Iliis Saturday, Stanford will write the final chapter in a
disappointing year for all those involved with the program.
Worse, immediate improvement will be no easy task with
the departure of Michael Okwo and oft-injured quarter
back Trent Edwards, the Cardinal's best players on each
side of the ball.
It isclear, then, that if Stanford posts an improved record
in 2007, it will stem from progress from younger players.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, at least one freshman looks
poised for a breakout 2007 campaign.
True freshman Richard Sherman has come alive for
Stanford in the past two games at Washington and versus
Oregon State. The young receiver racked up a total of 267

threat to score on any given play in a Nov. 4
42-0 home loss to the Pac-10 champion USC
Trojans. Sherman caught a pair ofT.C. Os
trander passes in the second half for 25 and 33
yard gains, and Ostrander seemed to look his
way more and more in the passing game.The
freshman has led Stanford's offense statisti
cally in the two games since.
"In the USC game when I caught the two
gos' back to back — we started moving the
ball pretty well after that," Sherman said.
"And then the next game I had 177 yards, so I
would say that's been the biggest turning
point for me personally."
Sherman credited senior receivers Evan
Moore and Mark Bradford, who have both
missed significant time due to injuries, with
helping him adjust to the increased mental
responsibilities of the college game.
"They've helped me tremendously,"
Sherman said. "[Bradford] has helped me
with the plays and they've both really
helped me with coverages. They've helped
me adjust to how many plays there were —
helped me memorize them and get my as
signments down."
Ironically. Sherman's emergence on the
scene as a playmaker for Stanford's offense
may be due largely to the injuries that have
otherwise crippled it all season. The absence
of Bradford and Moore gave the true fresh
man increased playing time to develop. And
when senior quarterback Trent Edwards
went down for the season, he was replaced by
Ostrander, who had often worked with Sher

of the second string offense.

anything. I just
expected to play sparingly, but when he got
hurt I was hoping to make an impact. And I
worked with [Ostrander] earlier in camp, so I
already knew a lot about him and about his
style. So it wasn't that hard of an adjustment
at all."
Sherman, who says he likes to pattern his
play after the NFL's Chad Johnson, is truly a
bright spot for the Cardinal in the midst of a
difficult season because, as a freshman, he
will be in the fold in seasons to come. And the
young receiver certainly doesn't see his role
shrinking in future years.
"Hopefully I'll have a big role in this of
fense." Sherman said. "That's what I want —
to be a playmaker for this offense."
Still, as the 1-10 Cardinal head to Memor
ial Stadium to face the Bears, the year's disap
pointments haven't been easy for the electri
fying wide-out, who praised his coaches and
teammates for keeping the team focused and
the morale high.
"It was pretty difficult," Sherman said. "I
haven't really lost this much, ever. But the
coaches and team have kept high morale
throughout the season and kept a positive at
titude. So it wasn't as difficult as it would have
been if everyone had just gotten negative and
given up."
And as for the rivalry itself, Sherman said
he's prepared for Big Game's atmosphere
this week, and believes that a win could make
the disappointments of 2006 that much easier
to deal with.
"It's going to be a pretty crazy game,"
Sherman said. "I was at the game last year
and so I've seen how crazy the fans were. 1
think if we win this week it will just rejuve
nate everybody. It would help people forget
the season a little easier, so 1 think there's a
lot of added weight on this game."
