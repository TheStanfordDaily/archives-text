# Zen and the art of sandwich design
## 
### 
Consider the sandwich: Every cuisine
has its own version of fillings-in-bread,
leading me to believe that the sand
wich is a Platonic form. Somewhere,perhaps
in another dimension, exists the ideal sand
wich. I'm hoping it comes with avocado.
Sandwiches include pitas, bruschetta,
though not the burrito. according to a recent
court decision between Panera and Qdoba,
in which the judge ruled that "a sandwich is
not commonly understood to include burri
tos, tacos and quesadillas, which are typical
ly made with a single tortilla and stuffed
with a choice filling of meat, rice, and
beans."
Right answer, wrong reason. What pre
vents the burrito from being a sandwich is its
cylindricality. Horizontality,parallel horizon
tal lines in particular, is essential to the sand
wich. If you put fillings on a piece of flatbread
and fold it halfway over, that is a sandwich.
But as soon as the opposite sides of bread
touch, forming a cylindrical, continuous cas
ing of bread, it becomes a wrap. A wrap is not
a sandwich.

Toasting, it seems, has become the toast of
the sandwich world. Subway, perhaps eyeing
the success of Quiznos, now offers all of its
sandwiches toasted. At the airport I recently
saw a food stand labeled, rather bluntly,
Toasted Sandwiches. Toasting can certainly
up the texture contrast of a sandwich, and it's
easy to do at home. Spread both sides of the
assembled sandwich with butter and put it in
a hot pan or griddle. Then either press down
on the sandwich continuously with a spatula,
or weigh it down with something heavy like a
textbook or another pan. When one side's
golden brown, flip it and repeat on the other
side.

What, besides toasting, makes a good
sandwich? As with any kind of cooking, it all
starts with good ingredients. For a truly great
sandwich you need bread with enough heft
and flavor to stand up to the fillings. The tex
tureless Wonder Bread types don't add much
to the sandwich and are likely to disintegrate
mid-meal. As for the fillings: if you choose to
go with meat, it's worth it to move past the
prepackaged, slime-soaked variety. It may
once have been part of a living animal,but it's
kind of hard to see how. And for the condi
ments, a little goes a long way. So even though
you might wince at shelling out for a com
plex, spicy wholegrain mustard in place of
standard yellow, consider that you can prob
ably get at least 20 sandwiches worth of en
joyment from a single container.
Study questions: Does the ideal sandwich
have meat in it? If so, what does this mean
for vegetarians? Is the ideal sandwich toast
ed?
