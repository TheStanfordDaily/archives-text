School of Education clarifies

The November 28 article, "Teach for Amer
ica Comes Under Fire," may leave readers with
the impression that Stanford's School of Edu
cation, as an organization, has a position on
Teach for America (TFA).This is not the case.
The article was based primarily on an interview
with one faculty member who expressed her
own opinions. We are committed to open de
bate on all issues related to school reform, and
I am glad our faculty are participating. But the
School itself does not have an official position
on the issue. In fact, many of our students are
Teach for America alumni who are deeply
committed to improving the quality of our
schools and reforming our education system.

We are proud to have an opportunity to help
them become effective teachers and leaders.

"Teach for America" Teacher responds
As a first year Teach for America teacher, I
can say that my job is extraordinarily difficult.
I lowever, I feel this would have been the case if
I had six months or even six years of prepara
tion. While there are times when I feel like as
though I much to improve on. I have gotten
nothing but positive feedback from the admin

istration and fellow teachers at my school.
Waipahu High in Hawaii. They have, by and
large, been impressed with the quality of my
lesson plans and organizational systems. There
is really nothing that can prepare you for teach
ing 160 students except teaching 160 students,
especially when you are trying to teach high
school math to students performing at the
fourth or fifth grade level. This education gap is
why Teach for America is so important. Stu
dents living in low-income communities are
woefully underserved by their schools, and if
they don t get a Teach For America corps mem
ber as their teacher, they often get an uncerti
fied permanent substitute or no teacher at all.
It seems to me this article asks the wrong
questions. While it is customary in our
society to always want to determine
which organization is best, isn't it possi
ble that both STEP and Teach for
America are doing tremendous things
for their students? I have no experi
ence with STI - P. but Teach for America
prepared me well, and I continue to re
ceive tremendous support from veter
an teachers associated with the organi
zation. I can only imagine an organiza
tion as highly regarded as S TEP offers
similar experiences. To me, the ques
tion this article should have asked is not
which is better, but why are there not
more organizations such as these? My
students come into my classroom years
behind their more fortunate peers, and
Teach for America is one of the only na
tionwide organizations I know of at
tempting to do something about it. I
would challenge anyone who says
" Teach for America's poorly prepared
teachers have little or no impact on the
community they serve" to spend a day
with me, to follow me through six differ
ent overcrowded classrooms, and see if
they still feel the same way.
Teach for America offers young
people an opportunity to get involved
and make a real difference right away.
It also provides a fresh perspective on
the educational system. Teach for
America teachers do not usually
come from education backgrounds
and, thus, take on teaching with a dif
ferent perspective. The educational
system in this country has failed most
of the students Teach for America
teachers are teaching. Putting eager,
young minds to the problems faced by
our country's poorest and lowest
achieving students is a mission to be
applauded rather than criticized. 1 en
courage all of Stanford's students to
investigate Teach for America, S TEP,
or education in general as a challeng
ing and tremendously rewarding ca
reer.
