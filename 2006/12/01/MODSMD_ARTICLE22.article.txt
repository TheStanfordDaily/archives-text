School of Education clarifies

The November 28 article, "Teach for Amer
ica Comes Under Fire," may leave readers with
the impression that Stanford's School of Edu
cation, as an organization, has a position on
Teach for America (TFA).This is not the case.
The article was based primarily on an interview
with one faculty member who expressed her
own opinions. We are committed to open de
bate on all issues related to school reform, and
I am glad our faculty are participating. But the
School itself does not have an official position
on the issue. In fact, many of our students are
Teach for America alumni who are deeply
committed to improving the quality of our
schools and reforming our education system.

We are proud to have an opportunity to help
them become effective teachers and leaders.

Waipahu High in Hawaii. They have, by and

lesson plans and organizational systems. There
is really nothing that can prepare you for teach
ing 160 students except teaching 160 students,
especially when you are trying to teach high
school math to students performing at the
fourth or fifth grade level. This education gap is
why Teach for America is so important. Stu
dents living in low-income communities are
woefully underserved by their schools, and if
they don t get a Teach For America corps mem
ber as their teacher, they often get an uncerti
fied permanent substitute or no teacher at all.
It seems to me this article asks the wrong
