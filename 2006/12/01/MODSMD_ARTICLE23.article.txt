## WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL Sac State up first for No. 2 Cardinal 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
As the 2006 NCAA Tournament gets underway
Saturday, the No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team
is hosting a reunion of sorts. Two of the three visiting
teams in the Palo Alto subregional played their first
matches in Maples last year. Stanford will open the
tournament against Sacramento State while No. 21
Santa Clara takes on newcomer Missouri.
TTie Cardinal will, however, be looking for a differ
ent outcome than last year's matches — the Broncos
(20-7.9-5 West Coast Conference) knocked Stanford
out of the playoffs in the second round last year.
Hie Cardinal, the top seed in the Austin, Texas Re
gional enter the postseason riding the high of a Pac-10
Conference Championship and a five-match winning
streak which includes wins over No. 3 Washington, the
sixth overall tournament seed, and fourth-seeded No.
4 UCLA. Even so. the postseason starts with a blank
slate.
"This is like the start of a new season and we have
lots of work to do," coach John Dunning said. "But we
have a lot of things going for us. We are very healthy
compared to what we have been in past years, and we
are also pretty well rested. And we are playing at
home, so we feel pretty lucky."
Hie Cardinal played the first round last year with
out sophomore Cynthia Barboza. who tore her ACL
halfway through her freshman campaign,and with jun
ior setter Bryn kehoe still recovering from a broken
hand. This year, both have played every match and
Barboza leads the Cardinal offense in kills and aces.
Kehoe was last week's Pac-10 and national Player of
the Week.
With a healthy roster, the Stanford squad seems
poised to achieve its aim of peaking at the end of the
season. Leading up to their 2004 national champi
onship, the Cardinal kept improving through the post
season. and they look to do the same this year.
"You don't go into it just trying to prepare for the
next few games," Dunning said. "We need to go into
every week and work every day to improve. At this
point in the season, teams are either rising or falling
and there are very few standing still. I don't think we
fell too far. but we had a period in our season about
three weeks ago that was pretty tough on us. Hopeful
ly. that is going to be the only time that we feel that
way."
The Cardinal dropped a three-game match to No. 5
DSC at home before beginning their winning streak
with a win over UCLA. Since that four-game victory.

NOTES: Stanford is set to host NCAA subregional
matches this weekend as Santa Clara, Sacramento
State and Missouri visit the Farm. The Cardinal romped
through their late season schedule, going undefeated
after a Nov 10 loss at USC. Competition had been
scheduled to begin Friday, but inclement weather in the
Midwest altered travel plans and forced a one day
delay in the subregional's schedule. The Cardinal have
been comfortable playing at home all season, and
have a 1 2-1 record at Maples entering the tournament.
Stanford has not lost a game.
"USC was on a mission to play us. no question."
Dunning said. "That's a bit of a mismatch, so they beat
us. And you learn from that.The next day we had very
serious effort by many different people and great
toughness, playing with heart and commitment to the
task at hand — those are all cliches and that is exactly
what happened against UCLA."
The Cardinal will need to continue that dominance
if they want to be the team to advance to Austin from
a tough subregional. Saturday's opponent will be
Sacramento State (30-5, 15-1 Big Sky), five-time de
fending Big Sky Conference champion and a familiar
foe for Stanford.
"Sac State has had a very good year. Dunning said.
"Debbie Colberg is a great coach and we have seen
them a lot. almost every year it seems."

that these teams will meet in the first round. Stanford

Atlee Hubbard leads the 1 lornets

is Sacramento State's top blocker
with 219 on the season while libero
Kristin Lutes has already notched
757 digs.
The Hornets come in riding a six
game winning streak and lost only to
Portland State in the conference sea
son. The only thing to interrupt their
Big Sky dominance was a midseason
non-conference loss to Santa Clara,
their opening round opponent last
year and the favorite in the other
first round match in Maples.
Last year, the Broncos beat

Sacramento State and then upset
Stanford in the second round of the
tournament. Two upsets later. Santa
Clara found itself in the Final Four
for the first time, where the Broncos
lost to top-seeded Nebraska.
This year, they have struggled
with injuries and roster turnover
setter Crystal Matich missed several
weeks in the middle of the season
and middle blocker Annalise Mura
tore left the team midseason — but
they finished conference play strong.
"1 haven't seen Santa Clara since
the start of the year and they are a lit
tle bit different now." Dunning said.
"Matich was out for a while, which is
why they had some rough spots. But
she's back now and I'm sure they are
playing great."
The Broncos won four straight
before falling to No. 17 San Diego in
their conference finale. Matich, after
missing nine matches, is back in the
lineup and has helped her team to a
.262 hitting percentage. Kim McCiiv
en and Anna Cmaylo are the top of
fensive producers, with 383 and 360

kills respectively, and Cmaylo is hit
ting at a .407 clip on the season, the
nation's tenth highest average.
Cmaylo also leads in blocks with 10" 7
and libero Caroline Walters has a
team-high 3% digs.
The Broncos start the tourna
ment with the Missouri Tigers, the
lone newcomer to Palo Alto. Stan
ford and Mizzou have faced one an
other only once before, a Cardinal
sweep in 1997.
The Tigers finished 17-12. 11-9 in
the Big 12 Conference and have not
beaten a ranked team in their last
five tries. Last year Missouri played
in the Elite Eight after upsetting No.
12 Hawaii and they again face a
tough road.
Missouri lost three of its last five
matches but swept Texas Tech to
close out the regular season. Jessica
Vander kooi is the Tigers' top hitter
with 440 kills and a .241 hitting per
centage. Redshirt freshman setter
Lei Wang has 1334 assists and is third
on the team in digs. Libero latum
Ailes. whose younger sister Cuibi has

committed to playing tor Stanford
next year, averages nearly five digs
per game and Nicole Wilson and

blocks.

out of the playoffs in the second round last year.
Hie Cardinal, the top seed in the Austin, Texas Re

Conference Championship and a five-match winning
streak which includes wins over No. 3 Washington, the
sixth overall tournament seed, and fourth-seeded No.
4 UCLA. Even so. the postseason starts with a blank
slate.
"This is like the start of a new season and we have
lots of work to do," coach John Dunning said. "But we
have a lot of things going for us. We are very healthy
compared to what we have been in past years, and we
are also pretty well rested. And we are playing at
home, so we feel pretty lucky."
Hie Cardinal played the first round last year with
out sophomore Cynthia Barboza. who tore her ACL
halfway through her freshman campaign,and with jun
ior setter Bryn kehoe still recovering from a broken
hand. This year, both have played every match and
Barboza leads the Cardinal offense in kills and aces.
Kehoe was last week's Pac-10 and national Player of
the Week.
With a healthy roster, the Stanford squad seems
poised to achieve its aim of peaking at the end of the
season. Leading up to their 2004 national champi
onship, the Cardinal kept improving through the post
season. and they look to do the same this year.
"You don't go into it just trying to prepare for the
next few games," Dunning said. "We need to go into
every week and work every day to improve. At this
point in the season, teams are either rising or falling
and there are very few standing still. I don't think we
fell too far. but we had a period in our season about
three weeks ago that was pretty tough on us. Hopeful
ly. that is going to be the only time that we feel that
way."
The Cardinal dropped a three-game match to No. 5
DSC at home before beginning their winning streak
with a win over UCLA. Since that four-game victory.
