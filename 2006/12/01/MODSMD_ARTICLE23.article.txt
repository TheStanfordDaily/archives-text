## WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL Sac State up first for No. 2 Cardinal 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
As the 2006 NCAA Tournament gets underway
Saturday, the No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team
is hosting a reunion of sorts. Two of the three visiting
teams in the Palo Alto subregional played their first
matches in Maples last year. Stanford will open the
tournament against Sacramento State while No. 21
Santa Clara takes on newcomer Missouri.
TTie Cardinal will, however, be looking for a differ
ent outcome than last year's matches — the Broncos
(20-7.9-5 West Coast Conference) knocked Stanford
out of the playoffs in the second round last year.
Hie Cardinal, the top seed in the Austin, Texas Re
gional enter the postseason riding the high of a Pac-10
Conference Championship and a five-match winning
streak which includes wins over No. 3 Washington, the
sixth overall tournament seed, and fourth-seeded No.
4 UCLA. Even so. the postseason starts with a blank
slate.
"This is like the start of a new season and we have
lots of work to do," coach John Dunning said. "But we
have a lot of things going for us. We are very healthy
compared to what we have been in past years, and we
are also pretty well rested. And we are playing at
home, so we feel pretty lucky."
Hie Cardinal played the first round last year with
out sophomore Cynthia Barboza. who tore her ACL
halfway through her freshman campaign,and with jun
ior setter Bryn kehoe still recovering from a broken
hand. This year, both have played every match and
Barboza leads the Cardinal offense in kills and aces.
Kehoe was last week's Pac-10 and national Player of
the Week.
With a healthy roster, the Stanford squad seems
poised to achieve its aim of peaking at the end of the
season. Leading up to their 2004 national champi
onship, the Cardinal kept improving through the post
season. and they look to do the same this year.
"You don't go into it just trying to prepare for the
next few games," Dunning said. "We need to go into
every week and work every day to improve. At this
point in the season, teams are either rising or falling
and there are very few standing still. I don't think we
fell too far. but we had a period in our season about
three weeks ago that was pretty tough on us. Hopeful
ly. that is going to be the only time that we feel that
way."
The Cardinal dropped a three-game match to No. 5
DSC at home before beginning their winning streak
with a win over UCLA. Since that four-game victory.

NOTES: Stanford is set to host NCAA subregional
matches this weekend as Santa Clara, Sacramento
State and Missouri visit the Farm. The Cardinal romped
through their late season schedule, going undefeated
after a Nov 10 loss at USC. Competition had been
scheduled to begin Friday, but inclement weather in the
Midwest altered travel plans and forced a one day
delay in the subregional's schedule. The Cardinal have
been comfortable playing at home all season, and
have a 1 2-1 record at Maples entering the tournament.
Stanford has not lost a game.
"USC was on a mission to play us. no question."
Dunning said. "That's a bit of a mismatch, so they beat
us. And you learn from that.The next day we had very
serious effort by many different people and great
toughness, playing with heart and commitment to the
task at hand — those are all cliches and that is exactly
what happened against UCLA."
The Cardinal will need to continue that dominance
if they want to be the team to advance to Austin from
a tough subregional. Saturday's opponent will be
Sacramento State (30-5, 15-1 Big Sky), five-time de
fending Big Sky Conference champion and a familiar
foe for Stanford.
"Sac State has had a very good year. Dunning said.
"Debbie Colberg is a great coach and we have seen
them a lot. almost every year it seems."
Indeed, the match will be the third time in five years
that these teams will meet in the first round. Stanford
has never lost to the 1 lornets and swept them to open
