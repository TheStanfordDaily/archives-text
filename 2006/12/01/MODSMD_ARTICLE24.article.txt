# Raiders on horizon
## Women's hoops faces Texas Tech after rout of Santa Clara 
### SCOTT BLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 15 Stanford women's
basketball team will be looking to
start its first winning streak of the
2(M)b-2(X)7 season when they take
on No. 25 Texas Tech at 2 p.m.
Sunday in Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal (3-3) have yet to
string back-to-back wins together
in an opening stretch that has in
cluded losses to each of their
ranked opponents — No. 23
Brigham Young, No. 4 Tennessee
and No. 8 Georgia.
'ITie team's difficulties have
stemmed, in part, from poor
shooting. Stanford took 73 shots
in each of the last two games, but
went only 59 for 146 (40.4 per
cent) overall against Tennessee
and Santa Clara. And while their
inside presence has been good,
with seniors Brooke Smith and
Kristen Newlin and freshman

Jayne Appel all having big games on the glass and on the scoreboard, the Cardinal
have suttered Ironi a dearth of three-point shooting. Junior Candice Wiggins is the
only consistent scorer from behind the arc, as the team is clearly missing graduated
three-point specialist Krista Rappahahn. Newlin and Smith have been chipping in oc
casionally, but they have not been able to shoulder the offensive load from both inside
and outside.
I lowever, the rocky start clearly has not signaled the end of Stanford's still young
season.The Cardinal are coming off of a blowout victory over Santa Clara on Wednes
day night, 88-56. in which the defense kicked in to stifle the Broncos. The Cardinals
11 steals counted for over half of Santa Clara's 20 turnovers, while six blocks from five
different players helped push the Broncos' field goal percentage down to a poor 33.3
percent for the game.
fhat defense will be tested by a Texas lech (6-1) offense that boasts four players
averaging double digits in points. Senior forward Alesha Robertson, scoring 13.1
points per game, anchors the Lady Raiders' frontcourt alongside junior center Erin
Myrick (12.0 ppg), while two guards — freshman Jordan Murphree (11.4 ppg) and
senior Brooke Baughman (10.3 ppg) — have been providing excellent balance from
the outside.
Texas Tech's defense has been exceptional as well.TTiey are holding opponents to
an average of 56.0 points per game on 34 percent shooting in the young season.The
potent offense-defense combination has led the Lady Raiders to some good results
early this year, including a 75-60 demolition of then-No. 21 UCLA last Sunday.
Stanford is 8-4 all-time against the Lady Raiders. The team edged Texas Tech 66-63
in Lubbock,Tex. last November behind 21 points from Smith and 18 points from Wig
gins.

Tech Sunday. Outside shooting has been a problem for the Card early in the season.
