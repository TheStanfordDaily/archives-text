## We're going to win (maybe) 
### 
It s tunny to think that one of the worst seasons
in the history of Stanford football could turn
itselt into a complete success. It's pretty sim
ple. actually: all the team has to do is win this Sat
urday.
I know that 1 sound delusional and ridiculous
right now. But hear me out for a second.
Stanford is going to heat Cal.
Despite the tact that the Cardinal are 28 point
underdogs (which. I would have to imagine, is the
largest difference in a point spread for the Big
Game in a long time), have only won one game
this season and have been crushed on numerous
occasions, Stanford will win. Forget that that the
game is against Cal. probably the second-best col

I his shows you why rivalries in college football
are so great. They allow for uninhibited delusion
al thinking. You don't have to look any further
than the last paragraph to see an example.
II you would have asked me how our team
would I are any other week of the season, I'd prob
ably just say. Oh. we're playing them? We'll prob
ably get killed.' And most of the time, 1 would
have been right.
But ask me right now if we're going to beat

but I have a good feeling.
You see, with rivalry games, everything goes
out the window. I"he previous 11 games that have
built us up to this point mean nothing. We have
one game, one three and a half hour block of time
to rectify several months of dreariness and disap
pointment. How can the team not be incredibly
excited tor this one game? They can erase all the
memories of such a horrible season if they collec
ts ely play the best game of football in their lives.
It would probably take a little luck, but anything's
possible, right?
I ve got to stop myself, though. I'm becoming
delusional again. Tailback Marshawn Lynch will
run wild all over Stanford's defense. Nate Long
shore, the next great Tedford quarterback, will
pick apart the C ardinal secondary with the preci
sion ot a surgeon. Super-athlete DeSean Jackson
will put an exclamation mark on the Bears' mas-
