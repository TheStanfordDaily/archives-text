## We're going to win (maybe) 
### 
It s tunny to think that one of the worst seasons
in the history of Stanford football could turn
itselt into a complete success. It's pretty sim
ple. actually: all the team has to do is win this Sat
urday.
I know that 1 sound delusional and ridiculous
right now. But hear me out for a second.
Stanford is going to heat Cal.
Despite the tact that the Cardinal are 28 point
underdogs (which. I would have to imagine, is the
largest difference in a point spread for the Big
Game in a long time), have only won one game
this season and have been crushed on numerous
occasions, Stanford will win. Forget that that the
game is against Cal. probably the second-best col
lege football program west of Austin.
I his shows you why rivalries in college football
are so great. They allow for uninhibited delusion
al thinking. You don't have to look any further
than the last paragraph to see an example.
II you would have asked me how our team
would I are any other week of the season, I'd prob
ably just say. Oh. we're playing them? We'll prob
ably get killed.' And most of the time, 1 would
have been right.
But ask me right now if we're going to beat
( al' We can do it. A few things have to go right,
but I have a good feeling.
You see, with rivalry games, everything goes
out the window. I"he previous 11 games that have
built us up to this point mean nothing. We have
one game, one three and a half hour block of time
to rectify several months of dreariness and disap
pointment. How can the team not be incredibly
excited tor this one game? They can erase all the
memories of such a horrible season if they collec
ts ely play the best game of football in their lives.
It would probably take a little luck, but anything's
possible, right?
I ve got to stop myself, though. I'm becoming
delusional again. Tailback Marshawn Lynch will
run wild all over Stanford's defense. Nate Long
shore, the next great Tedford quarterback, will
pick apart the C ardinal secondary with the preci
sion ot a surgeon. Super-athlete DeSean Jackson
will put an exclamation mark on the Bears' mas-
sacre with a punt return for a touch
down.
In all likelihood, this is what's
going to happen. If 1 were a betting
man, I'd have to go with the Bears.
Well, actually, I am a betting man; I
just choose wisely not to put money
on a dire and hopeless circumstance
like this one.
But wait? What am I saying? This
is Big Game, a Game unlike any
other. Anything goes — what other
college football game could have
produced the thrashing of a trom
bone player in the end zone after a
game-winning touchdown? Serious
ly, think about it.
Sure, our football team isn't
great. They're actually pretty bad, if
you hadn't noticed.
But when it comes down to it,
they are men who breathe, eat and
sleep just like their counterparts
from Berkeley. The Cal players
might be a little bit faster, bigger and
more skilled — and less intelligent, I
might add — but who cares? Forget
the statistics and the scouting re

ports. The only thing that matters is
the three and a half hours of football
that will take place at Memorial Sta
dium.
This is what Big Game week has
done to me. The same thing happens
on campuses across the country. You
only have to look a few hundred
miles south to UCLA, where the
Bruins think they can actually heat
the mighty Trojans of USC. Hah, fat
chance.
But like I've said, that's what
great about these rivalry games. All
rationality goes straight out the win
dow the week beforehand.
Yes, there's probably a 90 percent
chance that we'll be down by double
digits at halftime. And yes, there's a
good chance that we'll lose for the
fifth straight year. But I still think
we're going to win.
In short, I've completely deluded
myself into thinking that we have
some sort of chance to beat Cal this
week. After writing this, 1 hope I've
deluded you, too.
Because after all: you've gotta be
lieve.
