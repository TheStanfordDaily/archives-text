# Pep rally draws few
## Annual Big Game event sees tower turnout this year 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
Two nights before the biggest football
game of the year, about 2(H) generally am
bivalent students stood in the frigid air at the
base of a lit-up, red 1 loover Tower for a pep
rally that wasn't very peppy.
Only two years ago, when the football
team entered Big Game with a 4-6 record,
the whole fountain area in between the
Tower and Memorial Auditorium over
flowed with spirited fans. But, this year, it
was quiet enough to hear cell phones ring
ing.
With the exception of a few spirited stu
dents, the Band and some freshmen, the
crowd seemed lackluster and dispirited
accepting that the Cardinal are three-touch
down underdogs for Saturday's game
against UC-Berkeley.
"It's actually kind of sad." said junior
Dani Maier. before hollering enthusiastical
ly and going to hug a friend.
Trevor Hooper, senior captain of the
football team, thanked everyone for their
support.
"We're going to play as hard as we can,
and we want you to party as hard as you

can," he said, standing with about a dozen
other players.
I "lie Yell Leaders did the Axe chant, and
Dean of I reshman Julie Lythcott Haims
read the traditional story of the Axe. Lyth
cott Haims adopted a tone in her 10 minutes
on stage that at times seemed more like that
of a televangelist than a I Jniversity adminis
trator.
""If one of those Cal weenies dares to
taunt our student section. I'll kick their you
know whats," she said. "Some people think
we can't pull it off, but I believe."
"I believe. I believe, I believe." she
cheered, urging students to stay for the en
tire away game no matter what the score.
I lie mood was somewhat contagious.
"After Gaieties. I got excited about the
game again," said sophomore James Barton.
"They have chicken strips and red lights.
I low could it be more Stanford?"
On a Jumbotron connected to the
Hoover lower. Athletics Director Hob
Bowsby delivered a pre-recorded message
saying it would be a tough game but that he
has hope.
A photograph of students at Stanford in
Paris who spelled out Beat Cal with the lit
tel lower as the "A" was projected, followed
by a picture of the same message spelled out
in the Iraqi desert by alumni.
ITie ceremony ended with the Band's
rendition of its classic "All Right Now."

I lohmann.
