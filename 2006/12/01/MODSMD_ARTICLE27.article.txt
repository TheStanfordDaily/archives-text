## Despite criticism, Teach for America receives positive reviews Corps members see dramatic student performance gains 
### SAM BHAGWAT STAFF WRITER 
Teach for America has become one of the
biggest and highest-profile recruiters of grad
uating college seniors.
An aggressive recruitment campaign and
growing budget combined with loads of hype

have transformed the program designed to
help underachieving students in struggling
schools from a Princeton senior's pipe dream
in 1990 to a venerated educational organiza
tion today.
Nearly 19,000 students applied this year to
participate in the two-year program, accord
ing to the current issue of Fortune Magazine,
which reported that Teach For America
(TFA) hires more seniors than Microsoft,
Procter & Gamble, Accenture or General
Electric.
This afternoon at 4:30 in the Col 10, TFA
will continue its recruiting campaign, with

TFA Vice President Abagail Smith arguing
for the program's effectiveness. Tuesday. Hie
Daily examined an ongoing academic dispute
concerning the effectiveness of the program
and the readiness of the new teachers. Even as
some University professors have questioned
the efficacy of the teacher training effort, a
growing pool of program corps members and
alumni sing the organization's praises, saying
that the group's willingness to confront social
problems head-on is encouraging.
"As a senior at Stanford, I knew that I
wanted a job that would allow me to make a
difference," said Amber Saloner. who gradu

ated in 2004 and is now the TFA West Coast
recruiting director. "When I heard about
leach for America, l started learning more
about the achievement gap, and 1 couldn't be
lieve the staggering statistics. By the time
they're nine, children growing up in low in
come areas are already three grade levels be
hind their more affluent peers."
Students who commit to TFA are assigned
to inner-city or rural schools with large popu
lations of low-achieving minority students.
Corps members said that the adverse envi
ronment they were placed in as newly trained
novice teachers made the program one of the

hardest tilings they've done.
"A lot of kids come to class with basic sin
vival needs." said second-year corps member
Rianca Buckelew. class of 2005. of her experi
ence teaching in one of the poorest and most
densely populated neighborhoods in Los An
geles. "When that stuff is on their mind, it
makes learning difficult."
Corps member Kristin Wiens, a 2005 grad
uate who teaches in rural South Louisiana,
says that her fellow corps members were a
base of support for her.
"Everyone in your peer group is
going through what you're going
through, or went through it least
year," she said.
TFA corps members emphasized
both the short term and long term
goals of the organization in its en
deavor to close the education gap.
"In the short term, we place future
leaders in classrooms, and charge
them with the ambitious task of clos
ing the achievement gap for their stu
dents," said Saloner. "In the long
term, we are creating a pipeline of fu
ture leaders: people who will go into
law, medicine, policy, business, or stay
in education, and really be able to af
fect change."
Current and former corps mem
bers said the program's prime appeal
lies in its mission and methodology,
and that the life lessons they learn
and fulfillment they receive by being
part of the program more than makes
up for the difficulties.
"The kids are amazing," said sec
ond-year corps member Jacqueline
Hoang, a 2005 graduate who has
taught in Watts and South Central
Los Angeles. "I've learned so much
from them. They've prioritized for
me what I want to do with my life."
"I never would have been in
volved in education so much, it never
would have been my passion, had I
not been immersed in a community
that had been shortchanged," said
former corps member and graduate
student in education Devon
Williamson, who taught in various
schools in San Francisco.
Getting through the first year is
tough, members said, but the pro
gram's strong support system for
dealing with often frustrating school
systems and educational structures
was the key source of motivation.
" Iliey year I started, San Francis
co really messed up its projections of
students, and I got bumped out of my
class by a senior teacher," Williamson
said. "1 ended up being a long-term
substitute, and taught at four differ
ent schools."
But even after Williamson — who
said her experience was atypical of
the organization — was laid off at the
end of her first year when the San
Francisco school district was unsure
whether they could pay her salary,
she turned down TFA's offer to relo
cate her to another district.
"1 felt a real attachment to the
community," she said.
Campus campaign manager Rudy
Rubio.a junior.said that even though
he has not been a corps member, his
meetings with corps members have
demonstrated the organization's
commitment to social change.
"They rarely say anything about
just education and teaching," he said.
"If you talk about TFA, you have to
talk about so many other things."
Education Prof. Rachel Lotan
was more skeptical about the organi
zation's ability to achieve such goals,
saying that though corps members
were bright and dedicated, it would
not compensate for their lack of
training.
"They will learn that the hard way
— if they stay," she said.
But Hoang and Saloner said that
the children they taught improved
multiple levels of schooling in one
year of teaching, a result that TFA
Communications Director Jennifer
Carnig said was common.
"Given the fact that the students
we reach are often years behind
those in more affluent areas, we work
to ensure our corps members ad
vance their students by at least 1.5
grade levels in one year,"she said."ln
2005, 27 percent of our first year
corps members achieved this goal, as
did 50 percent of second year corps
members."
Carnig said that one of TFA's
goals was to raise these numbers to
41 and 80 percent, respectively, by
2010.
"I don't think that TFA is the an
swer to educational reform by itself."
Williamson said. "But it's certainly a
large piece of the pie."

"As a senior at Stanford, I knew that I
wanted a job that would allow me to make a
difference," said Amber Saloner. who gradu

recruiting director. "When I heard about

Students who commit to TFA are assigned
to inner-city or rural schools with large popu
lations of low-achieving minority students.
Corps members said that the adverse envi

novice teachers made the program one of the

hardest tilings they've done.

ence teaching in one of the poorest and most
densely populated neighborhoods in Los An
geles. "When that stuff is on their mind, it
makes learning difficult."
Corps member Kristin Wiens, a 2005 grad
uate who teaches in rural South Louisiana,
says that her fellow corps members were a
base of support for her.
"Everyone in your peer group is
going through what you're going
through, or went through it least
year," she said.
TFA corps members emphasized
both the short term and long term
goals of the organization in its en
deavor to close the education gap.
"In the short term, we place future
leaders in classrooms, and charge
them with the ambitious task of clos
ing the achievement gap for their stu
dents," said Saloner. "In the long
term, we are creating a pipeline of fu
ture leaders: people who will go into
law, medicine, policy, business, or stay
in education, and really be able to af
fect change."
Current and former corps mem
bers said the program's prime appeal
lies in its mission and methodology,
and that the life lessons they learn
and fulfillment they receive by being
part of the program more than makes
up for the difficulties.
"The kids are amazing," said sec
ond-year corps member Jacqueline
Hoang, a 2005 graduate who has
taught in Watts and South Central
Los Angeles. "I've learned so much
from them. They've prioritized for
me what I want to do with my life."
"I never would have been in
volved in education so much, it never
would have been my passion, had I
not been immersed in a community
that had been shortchanged," said
former corps member and graduate
student in education Devon
Williamson, who taught in various
schools in San Francisco.
Getting through the first year is
tough, members said, but the pro
gram's strong support system for
dealing with often frustrating school
systems and educational structures
was the key source of motivation.
" Iliey year I started, San Francis
co really messed up its projections of
students, and I got bumped out of my
class by a senior teacher," Williamson
said. "1 ended up being a long-term
substitute, and taught at four differ
ent schools."
But even after Williamson — who
said her experience was atypical of
the organization — was laid off at the
end of her first year when the San
Francisco school district was unsure
whether they could pay her salary,
she turned down TFA's offer to relo
cate her to another district.
"1 felt a real attachment to the
community," she said.
Campus campaign manager Rudy
Rubio.a junior.said that even though
he has not been a corps member, his
meetings with corps members have
demonstrated the organization's
commitment to social change.
"They rarely say anything about
just education and teaching," he said.
"If you talk about TFA, you have to
talk about so many other things."
Education Prof. Rachel Lotan
was more skeptical about the organi
zation's ability to achieve such goals,
saying that though corps members
were bright and dedicated, it would
not compensate for their lack of
training.
"They will learn that the hard way
— if they stay," she said.
But Hoang and Saloner said that
the children they taught improved
multiple levels of schooling in one
year of teaching, a result that TFA
Communications Director Jennifer
Carnig said was common.
"Given the fact that the students
we reach are often years behind
those in more affluent areas, we work
to ensure our corps members ad
vance their students by at least 1.5
grade levels in one year,"she said."ln
2005, 27 percent of our first year
corps members achieved this goal, as
did 50 percent of second year corps
members."
Carnig said that one of TFA's
goals was to raise these numbers to
41 and 80 percent, respectively, by
2010.
"I don't think that TFA is the an
swer to educational reform by itself."
Williamson said. "But it's certainly a
large piece of the pie."
