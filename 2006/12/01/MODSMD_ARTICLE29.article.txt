lence Against Women.
"Stanford is committed to eradicating all

founder of the Center for Relationship Abuse
Awareness, which will coordinate the education
and training components of the grant.
According to Carole Pertofsky, director of

it demonstrated a serious intention to address
sexual assault. She added that the University's
needs for prevention and education programs
closely matched the goals of the funding
agency.

Boardman said national statistics are alarm
ing.
"Young women on college campuses are
most at risk for being sexually assaulted," he
said. "Incidents of violence against men and
within same-sex relationships occur with less
frequency, but they are no less devastating."
The partnership consists of multiple organi
zations on- and off-campus. Internally, the part
ners include Vaden Health Center, Counseling
and Psychological Services. Health Promotion
Services, the Dean of Students Office, the
Freshman Dean's Office and Athletics and
Public Safety. Externally, Stanford partners
with the Center for Relationship Abuse Aware
ness and YWCA Rape Crisis Center of Silicon
Valley.
The YWCA offers a campus satellite office
providing confidential and victim-centered re
sponse. support and advocacy. Leandra Pelo
quin, prevention services coordinator at that or
ganization's Rape Crisis Center, praised the

University's efforts to collaborate with other
community organizations to counter violence
against women.
"Our collaboration is representative of
Stanford's innovative strides to end violence
against women on campus," Peloquin said.
Under Boardman, the University has taken
new steps to engage with the campus communi
ty on the issue of relationship violence. For
more than a year. Pertofsky said, various work
groups of students, faculty and staff examined
University policies, protocols and practices re
lated to relationship violence and sexual as
sault.
"ITiat includes the knowledge that when
crimes of sexual assault, stalking and relation
ship violence occur, there will be very serious
sanctions," said Pertofsky. "As a community, we
will be most powerful when we come together,
men and women, in one voice to end sexual as
sault and relationship violence against students,
their spouses, as well as staff and faculty."
