## Turistas: One Trip You Should Definitely Skip 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION TURISTA 
Silly turistas. You should have lis
tened to Josh Duhamel. He's the one
who knew you should have taken a
plane, he's the one who didn't trust
the drinking

water, and
he's the one
who noticed
something
fishy with the
passports in
the drawer.
Most impor
tantly, he
knew from
the outset the
one most im
portant rule
of cheap hor
ror movies:

never trust the locals. Anywhere.
Ever. If you'd listened to him, you
wouldn't have been mercilessly
slaughtered, and, more importantly,
I'd have my hour and a hall hack with
out having to watch such a surprising
ly boring, terrible movie.
"Turistas" is the next in an increas
ingly long (see also: tedious) line of
horror (licks seeking to cash in on the
trends started by "Hostel" and the
"Saw" series. In fact, the movie could
easily be described as Hostel in South
America, where it's Brazilians instead
of Europeans that can't wait to cut
right into those greedy ugly Ameri
cans. The plot is almost identical: a
group of tourists find a secret paradise

nestled away in the middle of a for
eign land, and soon find that that par
adise is a front for an evil murder ring
put on by the not-so-good people of
the local community.
Problem is, the man in charge
"Turistas" missed the point of "Hos-

Tel" â€” it was something of an experi
ment in gore-voyeurism, forcing the
viewer to uncomfortably watch
scenes where individuals took great
pleasure in the graphic torture of oth
ers. "Turistas." on the other hand, is
just a dull, dirty movie where several
tourists wander into the apparent
abyss that Brazil is and get killed off
while nobody, especially the audi
ence, really cares.
Josh Duhamel leads the cast of
television throwaways as they party,
swim, drink, and have their kidneys
removed on their leisure trip to South
