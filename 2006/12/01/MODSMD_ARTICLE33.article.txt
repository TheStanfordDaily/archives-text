## Turistas: One Trip You Should Definitely Skip 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION TURISTA 
Silly turistas. You should have lis
tened to Josh Duhamel. He's the one
who knew you should have taken a
plane, he's the one who didn't trust
the drinking

water, and
he's the one
who noticed
something
fishy with the
passports in
the drawer.
Most impor
tantly, he
knew from
the outset the
one most im
portant rule
of cheap hor
ror movies:

never trust the locals. Anywhere.
Ever. If you'd listened to him, you
wouldn't have been mercilessly
slaughtered, and, more importantly,
I'd have my hour and a hall hack with
out having to watch such a surprising
ly boring, terrible movie.
"Turistas" is the next in an increas
ingly long (see also: tedious) line of
horror (licks seeking to cash in on the
trends started by "Hostel" and the
"Saw" series. In fact, the movie could
easily be described as Hostel in South
America, where it's Brazilians instead
of Europeans that can't wait to cut
right into those greedy ugly Ameri
cans. The plot is almost identical: a
group of tourists find a secret paradise

nestled away in the middle of a for
eign land, and soon find that that par
adise is a front for an evil murder ring
put on by the not-so-good people of
the local community.
Problem is, the man in charge
"Turistas" missed the point of "Hos-

Tel" — it was something of an experi
ment in gore-voyeurism, forcing the
viewer to uncomfortably watch
scenes where individuals took great
pleasure in the graphic torture of oth
ers. "Turistas." on the other hand, is
just a dull, dirty movie where several
tourists wander into the apparent
abyss that Brazil is and get killed off
while nobody, especially the audi
ence, really cares.
Josh Duhamel leads the cast of
television throwaways as they party,
swim, drink, and have their kidneys
removed on their leisure trip to South

America. His Alex is annoyingly cognizant of what's
going on around him as, like the audience, he knows
something is not quite right. Unlike his audience, he

would have the power to do something about it, but
doesn't—after all, if they were to leave right away like he wishes there would be no killings,
right?
None of the "protagonists" are particularly likeable, as they tend to adhere to all those
ugly stereotypes that American tourists get secretly murdered abroad by local people. Since
often in horror flicks the audience is meant to root for the killer and take delight in each suc
cessive kill, that would have been okay, but the villain of the film is handled so clumsily that
no one ends up rooting for either side. Some of the best horror villains are at their scariest
when they clearly believe that what they're doing is morally right, and can make the audience
almost agree in some ways. "Turistas"' villain acts like such a character, but all his right
eousness-cred is snuffed out early on when he inexplicably (to the point of being comical)
pokes out the eye of one of his employees with a skewer.
Apparently director John Stockwell doesn't understand that a gritty, handheld camera
alone doesn't automatically make for a stylish filmmaking technique. While it was probably
meant to create an atmosphere of dread, his ugly, cheap camerawork just makes the movie
look ugly and cheap. It goes without saying that a sickle being run through someone's foot is
not going to look pretty, but Stockwell even manages to turn the lush jungles and tropical
beaches of his environment into something totally unattractive. It's as if he meant to create
juxtaposition between the beauty of the area and the repulsiveness of its inhabitants, but he
forgot to flip his camera's "ugly" switch to "pretty" in between scenes.
Worst of all, this horror movie features no real scary scenes. There are several disgusting
ones (though nowhere near enough to satisfy gore-hounds), a couple jump-at-cha startles,
and several chase scenes drawn out to loooooong lengths in an effort to build suspense that
turns them into something more closely resembling bad action sequences. "Turistas" is a
mess —it has no idea what it wants to say but says it anyway, and it desperately tries to be a
scar}' movie without a clue as to how to do such. And don't think it falls into so-bad-it's-good
territory: it's just bad.
It's bad. The kind of horror movie that even people who love all horror movies (such as
this reviewer) can't even begin to enjoy.
