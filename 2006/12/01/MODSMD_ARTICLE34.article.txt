## IT DOESN'T GET 'WILDER' 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION UNRATED SUPERSTAR 
The first thing you notice about the "Van Wilder, the Van
Gone Wilder Unrated Edition," is Tara Reid's chest. Her
breasts (pre-augmentation, that is) are emblazoned in 3-D
across the cover in a jaw-droppingly emphatic display of pro
duction values. This sentiment, extrapolated over the 94
minute running time, is accurate representation of the film in
its entirety.
"Van Wilder" is a movie about a guy who loves college so
much that he has extended his undergraduate career over seven

glorious years. Van (Ryan Reynolds) is the king
of Coolidge College, but when his father (Tim
Matheson) finds out about Van's better half of a
decade in college, he pulls the plug on Van's tu
ition payment. With the help of his roommate
Hutch (Tech Holmes), personal Indian Assis
tant Taj (Kal Penn, of Harold and Kumar fame),
and a well-endowed bulldog named Colossus,
students at Coolidge rally around Van to pay his
tuition.
At it's core, "Van Wilder" is comprised of
comedic elements that have become frustrating
ly common in the genre of college humor: diar
rhea jokes, fart jokes, et cetera. That being said,
there are elements here that push this comedy
(however slightly) above many of the standard
ized college films. There is a reason the film has
inspired 56 facebook groups, including the se
quel group "Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj"

which claims 15,387 members. The most apparent reason for
the movie's elevated popularity is the cast. Ryan Reynolds, the
incorrigible Wilder, comes off as smarmy, quotable and ulti
mately loveable douche bag. It's entertaining to see his charac
ter charm his way out of a variety of dilemmas, and his simpli
fied guidelines for the opposite sex directed at the less cool Taj
are doubtlessly taken to heart by lonely college guys nation
wide. Say what you will about Tara Reid, but her appearance in
this film is presumably well before her awful augmentation-slut
phase. Although her studious journalist character is hardly be
lievable, she's not unpleasant to look at. Paul Gleason reprises
his "The Breakfast Club" role as the quintessential educational

hard ass professor and Kal Fenn is commendable as the intro
verted exchange student gradually coaxed out of his gawky
facade by Wilder.
The film is studded with some moments that are truly gross.
Early in "Van Wilder," Hutch is trying to light an irregularly
shaped bong that turns out to be Taj's penis pump. "That's no
bong, that's for my schlong!" Later on. Colossus is masturbated
into some eclairs, setting off what is possibly the most disgusting
movie scene in recent memory. I mean, it's pretty funny, but try
ing to eat a pastry after watching 6 frat boys gargle dog sperm is
almost impossible. If watching someone have partially digested
bulldog semen vomited all over them sounds like a good time,
this is your movie.

If nothing else, to those with kindred values,
a DVD case-sized bust of Tara Reid's pre
surgery torso is well worth $19.98.
