# KAL PENN CALLS MY CELL
## 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION WILDMAN 
All of a sudden, my phone is ringing,
where the hell is the 202? "Hi, I've got
Kal Penn on the line from New York,
are you all set?"
Shit.
I was going to write my questions for
Mr. Penn after lunch, and before the
3:30 phone call. Only that was 3:30 EST.
I'm an idiot. This guy is Kumar for
Christ's sake.
Intermission: Hey Kal.
Kal: Loren. how are you?
INT: Good, how about you?
Kal: Good, man.
INT: Alright, 1 just have a few questions
for you if you don't mind.
Kal: Cool.
(By this point, I've wikipedia-ed Kal
Penn. I'm frantically scanning for ques
tion material. Panicked. I shoot from
the hip)
INT: Would you say that your part in
"Van Wilder," both the first one and
the upcoming "Rise of Taj," has im
proved your sex life at all?

Kal: (Laughs) That's what you're going
to ask me? I'm not answering that ques
tion.
INT: Oh, come on.
Kal: What do you think?
INT: Alright, according to Wikipedia,
during your undergraduacy at UCLA,
you formed a secret society called '6
South.'
Kal: Oh man, Wikipedia. I don't really
know what that's about. But if in were a
secret society, I wouldn't be able to talk
about it.
INT: What about Van Wilder 2, the up
coming 'Rise of Taj'?
Kal: It's a spin off from the first one. In
the first one I was kind of a sidekick
character and this was a chance to
branch out from that. It's four years
later and Taj is going to grad school. He
comes into his own and teaches a bunch
of pasty British children how to have a
good time.
INT: In interviews for Harold and
Kumar you talked about how you were
glad to give up the "stereotypical, racist,
and degrading" Indian accent. What
about your accent in the first "Van
Wilder?"

Kafc I would have no desire to play a stereo
typical character with an accent. But I don't
think an accent alone can determine
whether or not a character is stereotypical.
In this case it was the opposite of stereotyp
ing, taking a character who was so one-di
mensional and brandling him out into a
real human being. It's funny for more uni
versal reasons opposed to something con
fined to a stereotype. In order to carry a
whole film, you can't just make it one-di
mensional, it has to be about something
more.
INT: You played a character named
Stanford in Superman Returns, did that
just make you feel completely awe
some?
Kal: (laughs) Yeah, it was pretty badass.
INT: Superman was on a different scale
than your other films. What was it like
moving from comedy to big-budget ac
tion?
Kal: It was great but I wish more of my
stuff had stayed in the film. But it was
awesome. With a quarter of a million
dollar budget. I'd never had the oppor
tunity to work with that [kind of
money],
INT: What's next for Kal Penn? There

are rumors of an upcoming "Harold
and Kumar go to Amsterdam."
Kal: Yes. They're not going to Ams
terdam, but there is a sequel to that
we're shooting in January. It comes out
in late 2007. I'm also on the new

season of "24," off and on.
INT: As a villain?
Kal: 1 m not sure. I know

there's a bunch of BS online
about what I'm playing. It'll be
interesting to see what I end
up playing. I also have a film
called "The Namesake" com
ing out in March. It's [based on]
a book by Jhumpa Lahiri who
won the Pulitzer.

INT: No record deal yet? That
seems like the next logical step.
Kal: No record deal yet.
INT: Well, that's all I got. Thanks

for talking to me.
Kal: No problem.
Note to self: Do not shoot from
the hip.
