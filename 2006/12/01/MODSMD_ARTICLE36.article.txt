## Santa has got nothing on these songs 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION JINGLE BELLER 
When I was a kid, I loved Christ
mas music. But as I got older, and
more cynical, 1 started to detest
Christmas songs. They were overly
sentimental mush that exemplified
everything that was wrong with
Christmas: commercial, unoriginal
and bland. So I approached Sufjan
Steven's newest release "Songs for
Christmas" with a little apprehension
and without really having listened to
Christmas carols for several years.
It, then, certainly was a treat to
hear Sufjan's newest effort from his
humorously titled label, "Asthmatic
Kitty.' Of course, it may be a mis
nomer to call this Sufjan's 'latest'
work, as he has been working on this
release since 2(X)1, when he made an

Christmas EP for his family and
friends. This box set contains five EPs
which Sufjan has released each year
since 2001 (except for 2004 when he
was working on •Illinois'). It contains
a total of 42 songs, a story book, an an
imated music video, an essay by Suf
jan, lyrics and guitar tabs, stickers and
a poster of Sufjan.
It would seem that all these extras
could create something utterly com
mercial and detestable, but all these
extras are far too cute to be crass. In a
way. they are a sort of parody of all the
traditional merchandising that comes
with Christmas.
"Songs for Christmas" is full of
wonderful traditional songs,' from
'Silent Night' to The Little Drummer
Boy' to 'Jingle Bells.' Sufjan takes
these songs and makes them his own
in small ways, like playing the songs

on his banjo rather than the normal
guitar. His lovely, delicate voice is
perfect for these traditional Christmas
carols. In "The Little Drummer
Boy," Sufjan sings in such a warm,
poignant and heartfelt manner that
his is the best version of the song I
have ever heard.
But it is Sufjan's original songs that
are easily the best songs in the box.
These songs create a welcome fresh
ness to the often stale sound of Christ
mas songs. They are far more upbeat
and silly than the rest of the Christmas
music canon. Sufjan has managed to
create songs with a distinctive Holi
day sound, while also moving beyond
the normal tone of Christmas songs.
Take "Get behind me, Santa!", for
example. It has zany and silly lyrics
than are strangely and charmingly ap
propriate for Christmas, with the
singer accusing Santa Claus: "I don't
care about what you say Santa Claus/
You're a bad brother breaking into
people's garage ." Santa, defends
himself by replying "You got it
wrong,/ Cause I'm just another regu
lar guv/ Super powers and a penchant
for the Yuletime /Is it a crime to give a
little once in a while?" While these
lyrics are pretty cheesy, they fit per
fectly with many other ridiculous
modern Christmas songs.
One nice thing about the album is

that it allows the listener to hear Suf
jan's musical growth. Sufjan's 2001
EP is simpler, humbler and more to
Sufjan's folk roots. But as the years go
by, we can hear Sufjan create very im
pressive and ambitious arrangements
that sound terrific.
The only problem with the box is
that it is sometimes repetitive: the
song "O Come O Come Emmanuel"
appears three times, albeit in different
arrangements. And the traditional
songs sometimes blend into each
other when you try to listen to the
album for too long. But this is certain
ly forgivable, given what Sufjan is
working with.
Overall, Sufjan strikes a good bal
ance between the Christmas classics
and his new original songs. His songs,
of course, are more fun and new, but
the traditional songs are sure to please
anyone who loves conventional
Christmas music. The compilation is a
reminder that Christmas music
doesn't have to be bland and boring, it
can be fresh and dynamic.
"Songs for Christmas" would
make an excellent Christmas present
for anyone who likes Christmas music
or just good music in general. But it
would be a pity to receive "Songs for
Christmas" and not be able to play it
until the next year's Christmas season.
I know that "Songs for Christmas" has

been a great present for myself, since
listening to it was the first time I've
been excited for Christmas music in a
long while.
