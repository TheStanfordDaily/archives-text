# MERRY CHRISTMAS
## How Christmas saved the cinema 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION CHRISTMAS FLICKSTER 
"Die Hard" is arguably the ultimate action
movie and "Love Actually" arguably the ulti
mate romantic comedy (at least that's what
the movie's tag-line claims). In addition to
being at the top of their respective genres,
the two movies also show up on lists of best

Christmas movies. Of course, whether
these films are really about Christmas is
debatable. One could argue that both

use the holiday backdrop as a conve
nient plot device. Regardless, each
movie certainly benefits from a lit
tle holiday flair.

As an action film centering on
an off-duty policeman battling
12 German terrorists in an LA

high-rise, "Die Hard" is hardly full
of Christmas cheer. But there's defi
nitely a lot of merriment to the pro-

ceedings. Indeed the film succeeds
because it combines brutal ac
tion sequences with a keen

sense of humor. In one of the film's final scenes, John McClane
(Bruce Willis) is engaged in a vicious skirmish with one of the ter
rorists, now revealed to be a mercenary interested only in looting
millions of dollars from the building's vault. The scene is punctuat
ed with a nice moment in which McClane's hostage wife, a mother of
two, taunts the leader of the terrorist group with the fact that he is
nothing but a "common thief." The leader's response is characteris
tic of the film's self-mocking quality: "I am an exceptional thief, Mrs.
McClane. And since I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be
more polite!"
T he Christmas setting in "Die Hard" makes for some clever one
liners, most notably McClane's message to his nemesis, "Now I have
a machine gun. Ho ho ho." But the time of year is only really essen
tial to the film's setup, conveniently justifying why an estranged Mc-
Clane is visiting his wife (he's in town to spend time with his children)
and why there are only a few dozen hostages in the building, conve
niently located in only one of forty floors (it's a small party and all the
other employees are home for the holidays). Still this is better than
the film's sequel, "Die Hard 2: Die Harder," which seems to use the
Christmas setting merely as an excuse for our hero to utter the line
"How can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?"
Christmas is arguably more central to "Love Actually," a roman
tic comedy about nine interconnecting love affairs. In interviews for
the movie, the film's writer-director, Richard Curtis, has expressed a
fondness for the two moments when a couple first meet and later

when they finally "get together." One of the reasons "Love Actual
ly" works so well is because audiences are also fond of these mo
ments and Curtis' movie is brimming with them. Of course, with nine
stories and a lean two hour running length, the film doesn't have time
for what happens in-between.
And this is precisely why Christmas is so important to "Love Ac
tually." Curtis needs his characters to express their desires but he
doesn't have the time to develop their yearning to do so. Thankfully,
the holiday backdrop saves the day, conveniently giving everyone an
excuse to divulge their true feelings. When one character reveals a
deep love for his best friend's wife, his message reads "But for now
let me say...just because it's Christmas (and at Christmas you tell
the truth) to me you are perfect." And when the British Prime Min
ister's personal assistant proclaims her love, the card prefaces the
sentiment with "If you can't say it at Christmas when can you, eh?"
The holiday setting also allows for a sadder moment involving infi
delity and a necklace.
But perhaps I'm being unfair? If holiday favorites like "It's a
Wonderful Life" are right and the true meaning of Christmas is about
family, friends, love and forgiveness, then "Love Actually" and "Die
Hard" truly are Christmas movies. "Love Actually" is all about fam
ily, friends and love. Nine times over. And "Die Hard" ends with Mc-
Clane and his wife embracing to the tune "Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
Let It Snow! What could be more Christmas-y than that? You
know, aside from the 12 dead terrorists.
