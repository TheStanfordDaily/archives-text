# X-MAS: NOT JUST FOR JESUS
## 
### BRANDON DAVID SILBERSTEIN INTERMISSION CHRISTMAS APOLOGIST 
The holidays are a time to celebrate, as would be inferred from
the definition of holiday. But as we all know, all other holidays are
mediocre compared to one. That's right. Hannukah wishes it was
it, Kwanzaa — well I don't know what the deal is with Kwanzaa,
but it isn t celebrated nearly as much as this holiday. You know
what I'm thinking of? That's right. Christmas.
Christmas is perhaps the most celebrated holiday in the world.
Everywhere you go, you see Christmas trees and Santa Clauses
lining the streets and city squares. And then you hear carollers
singing pretty songs. Songs about Jesus. That part irks me slight
ly. because I'm Jewish. I don't really want to celebrate the divini
ty of the Holy Trinity or the birth of Christ. I'm fine with my very
simple monotheism, really. Quite frankly, though, I really like the
idea of Christmas, and all the stuff that goes along with it, it's just

a problem for me because I'm
not Christian. But 1 still want to
celebrate. You can see my
predicament.
But lucky for me, and every
other non-Christian, Decem
ber 25 is an important day in
history, and there are plenty of
other things to celebrate. Thus,
I recommend that Christmas
be changed to one of the fol
lowing holidays (presents still
included).
Capitalism Day: On this day
in 1992, Gorbachev resigned as
the president of the USSR, and
the Cold War effectively was
over. We finally beat, once and
for all, those commie bastards,
and proved that capitalism is su
perior. We can finally all shun
the frozen, barren wasteland that
is Mother Russia together, and
all sit around a warm toasty fire
singing our national anthem,
watching reruns of the 1980
Olympic gold-medal hockey
match where our boys beat the
reds, and buy lots of stuff like a
good American consumer. And
if Santa takes off his red coat, he
can come too. Unless Santa is re
ally Tim Allen.

Cab Calloway Day: Cab Calloway, a wonderful performer and
musician, was born on this day. The man brought us great music
such as "Minnie the Moocher," so maybe we should all celebrate
his birth too! And I know just how to do it. By spending the whole
day speaking in scat. Ahideehoscibbeskaskit-skit-ditditdop
doobopatip. Ska-babadeebom-skeschoobahbahbahskidgetget
pupup. Amen.
Roadtrip Day: On this day in 1985, two men named Turner and
Pickhard drove 875 miles across Britain in a battery powered car
on a single charge for no apparent reason. Yeah, they both told
their wives they were going out for groceries, and then they just
kept going, having wild adventures and running from the law,
eventually hurling themselves ofl a clifl to their death. Or maybe
that was Thelma and Louise. My 1985 history is a little fuzzy, I
wasn't born yet. Either way. their accomplishment is duly noted,
and 1 think we should celebrate their act which has thus far gone
seemingly unnoticed. Yay for roadtrips!

For those of you that would
like a darker holiday, we have
John Wesley Hardin Day: John
Wesley Hardin supposedly
holds the record in the old west
for killing the most men in the
shortest amount of time. That's
an accomplishment worth cele
brating, 1 guess. Why Christ
mas? Because that day he shot
somebody dead over a dispute
in a card game in 1869. That's
all 1 really have to say about
this holiday. I don't actually
want to celebrate it, I just
wanted to give some people al
ternatives.
With all these options, 1 feel
we should evolve as a nation
and learn to embrace all faiths.
Holidays don't have to be ex
clusive. They can revolve
around commonalities we can
all share. I mean, sure, some of
us might be communists or be
unable to speak in scat, but let's
not let such things stop us from
enjoying ourselves during these
new times of celebration. After
all. you can just pretend you
aren't a commie for a day —
we'll respect your beliefs just
the same the day after.
