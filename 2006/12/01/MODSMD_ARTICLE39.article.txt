# THERE'S A WAR GDIN' ON OUT THERE!
## 
### BRANDON DAVID SILBERSTEIN INTERMISSION CHRISTMAS CONFEDERATE 
Some conservative right-wing thinkers believe that right notv
there is a "war" being waged against Christmas. That's slighLly in
accurate. to say the least. There is no war yet. It still has yet to he
ratified by the House and Senate, but the evidence right now
shows that Christmas does indeed possess weapons of mass de
struction, including the alleged J-bomb, which possesses the
power of God, equivalent to infinity megatons of TNT if vou re
religious (and a firecracker if you're not).
So officially, there is no war yet, but let's not plan as if this thing
isn't going to happen. If we're going to take out Christmas, we
have to be prepared â€”or else Santa, dictator of Christmas, is
going to hide his WMD's just like Saddam did, and there will he
nothing for weapons inspectors to find. That's why we need to act
now. Christmas is now officially the newest member of the Axis
of Evil.

And don't think that just because Christmas is at the North
Pole, it can t get to us. Christmas has been infiltrating our country
and even our homes for decades now, dropping little "presents"
down our chimneys. We can stand for this kind of direct attack no
longer. Also, with its patented Reindeer-Droppings Missiles all
pointed straight at the heartland of our great nation, Christmas is
the greatest threat to our national security. It must be stopped at
all costs.
Lucky for us, we have much experience with invading countries.
We should use those tactics, which have been proven throughout
history to be useful and effective measures for waging war against
a rogue nation.
The first thing we must do is gather intelligence. Intelligence
will show us the exact location of those menacing Reindeer Mis
siles. Intelligence will also tell us how many "Emperial" Lethal
112 orces (ELFs) will be protecting Santa. Once we have the loca
tion of the Reindeer Missiles, however, our first task must be to
destroy them. We must obliterate the reindeer. Every last one.

There shall be not one remaining. With the threat neutralized, our
ground troops can then move in.
The North Pole is a frozen and barren wasteland. Armies from
nations before us, such as Germany and France, have made the
mistake of aggressing too far into frozen wastelands. We will not
make the same mistake, however. In order to neutralize the threat
of the cold, we will employ the use of massive amounts of carbon
emissions in order to melt the ice caps. Tins should give our troops
sufficient ability to survive the climate and take down the heart of
the threat.
From here, our troops will move into the base of operations for
Christmas: Santa's Workshop. Intelligence already gathered in
forms us this is the last major stronghold. With our ground troops,
armed with the latest technology, we should be able to bring down
Santa in a matter of weeks
He will then be returned to the United States to await trial for
possession of concealed nuclear weapons as well as violation of
human rights. Intelligence shows that for years, Santa has selec

tively discriminated against the little people of the North Pole,
and forced them into slave labor at work camps located in Santa's
Workshop, North Pole. Here, they manufactured all of Santa's
"presents" and performed manual labor. If Santa is found guilty,
he could stand to face a maximum one million consecutive life
sentences or. if that isn't good enough, 120 death sentences.
If the war on Christmas is ratified, the head of U.S. troops in
Iraq, George Casey, will be reassigned to lead this force, tenta
tively known as Operation Grinch. "It's a surefire success," he as
sures us. History is on our side. Judging from the effectiveness of
the Tet offensive in Vietnam, where the Viet Kong attacked
American troops on the Vietnamese holiday Tet, Operation
Grinch should achieve the same level of effectiveness, as the war
will indeed be waged on a holiday.
We must always protect our glorious nation against the threat
posed by any adversary, no matter how powerful. And we must
act now, to preserve the lifestyle we love. So, everyone, write to
your congressman: Ratify the war on Christmas.
