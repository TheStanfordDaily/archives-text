## Falafels: A good call... 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION WRAPPER 
I never had falafel before 1 came to Stanford (1
couldn't find anything like it in Iowa). So I was excited
to try it. And so after eating at Olive's a couple of times,
I felt I knew what falafel was: a tasty vegetarian dish that
was a good alternative to the dining halls, but nothing
extraordinary.
But after going to Mediterranean Wraps located at
425 S. California Avenue, a little north of El Camino
Real, I now know how real falafel tastes. And let me tell
you, it's far different than anything 1 can find in lowa.
The restaurant is located inconspicuously in a cozy
little spot on California Avenue, and the first time I
hiked by it, I missed the place. But as 1 entered, I was

greeted by a gorgeous smell and an accent-

Ed "Hello, sirs!" and I knew 1 was in
for a treat. .

The restaurant itself is a little
small, but don't let this dis- J

Wraps doesn't have

my first impres
sions were very

positive. And the

good signs pontinued.
I quickly made my

order, and within a minute
or so, my muradarah plate.

which consisted of rice, whole

lentils, onions and falafel, was ready.

And again, I was greeted by the friendly

—C 7 O J J
restaurateur when I paid for my order. He made a

joke, and told me my order and drink and the order of
my friend Peter came out to be a "perfect $16.05." He
the commented on how great it was to have a friend who
would pay for your meal, and I remember thinking this
man is incredible.
His warm spirits made me feel right at home, and so
did the prices. I was prepared to spend $30 for my meal,
but shortly after arriving, I realized that it would be im
possible for Peter and I to spend that much. And even

after we ordered two more entrees (which weren't too
necessary as the meal in itself was pretty filling) and two
desserts, the check still didn't exceed $30.
However inexpensive the meal was, it was still deli
cious. All my food was fresh, warm and brimming with
taste. The falafel was lovely, just spicy enough — fried
and crispy on the outside and juicy and tasty on the in
side. I only wished that they had given me more falafel
balls to eat with my meal. .
The rice, vegetables and humus were delicious. All
were rich, savory and had a luscious flavor. To be hon
est. I've never really like humus; all I'd tried was bland
and flavorless, but Mediterranean Wrap's humus was
tasteful and very appetizing.
Because the meal was so inexpensive, I decided that

dessert was in order. I bought a

halva bar, and while, it was

not as good as the meal

itself, it was still de
v

cent. The other
. desert, some

sort of

' fruit jelly
thing, the

name of which I

could not find out.

was also appetizing. It was

sweet and almost like gummy

bears, except more chewy and much more delicious.

I will definitely go back to Mediterranean Wraps
when I can find the time. Both the excellent prices and
good food would be a draw enough, but those togeth
er combined with the amazing man who greeted us
makes Mediterranean Wraps a wonderful place to
eat.

I am now content with the fact that when I go home
I will have eaten real — and delicious — falafel.
