## YOU PLAY? 
### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION GEARHEAD 
You poke your head out around the corner, checking to see if anything
moves before you make your way out from the side of the decimated build
ing you're leaning against. Nothing, you let out the breath you had been
holding and prepare to move. You poke out your rifle and slowly start
walking down the street, your squad mates on either side of you. Sudden
ly, seemingly out of nowhere, the ground below you gives way and out
emerge dozens of Locust soldiers screaming battle cries and filling the af
ternoon air with lead. You instinctively jump back behind a demolished car
and spray the area blindly with bullets as you glance around trying to see
your squad mates. The decisions you make in the next three seconds will
make the difference between life and death.
Okay fine, they'll spell the difference between life and a loading screen
but that fact is surprisingly easy to forget in the heat of battle.
The X80x360 has been waiting for a mega-hit. "Halo 2" didn't quiet ex
plode in the way that Microsoft had expected and other follow-up attempts
had fizzled upon emerii% the market. Then came "Gears of War". Heavi
ly hyped and tirelessly promoted as the next big bar-raising game "Gears
of War" hit stores on November 7th. 2006 and has yet to get a bad review.
This won't be its first. In simple terms: this is everything the X80x360 was
hoping lot and then some.
"Gears of War" casts you as Marcus Fenix, a former COG (Coalition of
Organized Governments) soldier re-instated to help defend the war-rav
aged planet of Sera. The game follows Marcus and his squad as he fights
the Locust Horde, an underground threat bent on killing humanity, over a
36 hour period. I won't ruin the rest of the story, but it suffices to say that
it's fairly straight forward. You're a soldier. Your planet needs you. There
are a lot of really ugly bad guys that want to kill you. You can figure it out
from here.
I inderstandably, what makes "Gears of War" unique isn't as much its
story as it is everything else about it. *
The most noticeable of these features is, of course, the graphics. Using Un
real Engine 3 technology, the visuals in "Gears of War" are nothing short
of breath-taking. From vistas of devastated cat y ruins (fr the claustrophobic
lairs of the underground Locust, you find yourself double-taking every
other minute to fully appreciate the insane amount of detail in the game
world. Your characters' sweat glistens off their arms as they run from
enemy fire. The heat produced by your rifle creates heat-wave effects
whenever fired, rippling the air around the gun. Gravel flies as your char
acters sprint to avoid a barrage of fire. It's absolutely engrossing and play
ing it in high definition is so realistic it's honestly scary.
All of the games' cinematics are done using the game engine, never tak
ing you out of the story to show you pre-rendered scenes. It's all done on
the run making you truly feel like you are living the story, rather than
watching it happen.
The major focus of "Gears of War's" game play is centered on the con
cept of cover. With one button your character can dive from cover to
cover, hop over obstacles, or lean against a building to avoid fire. And the
cover isn't just a gimmick. If you step out into enemy fire for more than a
few seconds, especially on the higher difficulties, you're going to get frus
trated very quickly as you get torn to shreds over and over again. Using
cover and squad tactics is absolutely vital to moving through the game, es
pecially in the later stages when cover is your only advantage over gross nu
meric mismatches.
Eventually you'll get a hang of taking cover, starting distractions and or
dering your squad to flank your enemies position and that's very good, be
cause the enemy knows how to use cover and they know how to smoke you
out of yours, providing for numerous adrenaline filled situations that can
change in a split-second based on your decisions.
Unfortunately the "Gears of War" story, while captivating, is also fair
ly short. Mv friend and I burned through it in less than 10 hours (although
