# Gwar: Still cool?
## 
### CHRIS HOLT GWARRIFICDUDE 
My friend who got me the tickets sug
gested I wear a white t-shirt. "Why?" I'd
asked. She didn't give me a reason, hut told
me to stand close to the stage and enjoy the
show.
Going to a Gwar concert was arguably a
cool thing 10 years ago. They had that
cameo in "Empire Records" where they eat
that kid and then pop culture kind of forgot
them. But the shock-rock/metal scene
hasn't forgotten this space alien rock band.
They still have a devout and obsessive fol
lowing. They draw their musical influences
from thrash metal and hardcore punk while
their costumes resemble reject Todd Mc-
Farlane comic book characters. The lead
singer, Oderus Urungus, looks like an S/M

version of a pink gremlin and shouts

his lines like you'd expect that

Ito sound.
Gwar is promoting

I their latest album,
"Beyond Hell," 1

I which is a CD I
have yet to pick <

I up. In all hon-

lesty. I went to
the show with-l

I out having everl
heard a single!

I song by Gwar. If

I you'd asked me

now to name one, I still
probably couldn't. No, I
went there as a Gwar vir
gin of sorts, hoping that
my metal-head friends i
had trained my ear right J
and that I wouldn't offend
the locals enough to get
myself killed.
Playing at the

Warfield, the crowd was
pretty sizable. I don't just mean by number
of people, but I mean the audience looked
like bouncers themselves. Most were a good
10 years older than me but there were a
number of young bloods in there who shout
ed along and knew the words as well as any
one. There was not a hint of amusement or
irony in their enthusiasm for the band, and I
learned why.
Every Gwar show has a theme, kind of
like the Icecapades. This tour's theme was
Gwar's journey through hell. This was not
Dante's Inferno, for the guide was an effem
inate Hitle. Every wailing denizen they met.

the band decapitated with fake swords and
sprayed its (fake) blood at the audience. In
their encounters Gwar met (and killed)
Hilter. a cop. their number one fan, the
Pope. President Bush and.finally, a Jewish
Satan. No matter what your personal belief
system, they will offend you.
Their sense of humor and indeed intend
ed audience is probably at the fifth-grade
maturity level, so if you think sodomizing a
cop is hilarious, these guys are your
Wordsworth. The skits that come between
the politically incorrect songs are them
selves done in the campy formulaic tradition
of slasher flicks: Character comes on stage.
Gwar exchanges a few lines of banter and
then finds some way to splay their bodily flu
ids onto the audience. Man, I never thought
I'd write that sentence. The fluids are all
water based and pretty fake looking, which

is not much comfort when a I

giant alien phallus is I

spraying at you.

The finale I

made me a con- I
i vert. While

fighting Satan
i with their

fo a m

weapons,

they final-

ly call in
(what

else?) a

giant 20-foot di-

nosaur. When the
' elaborate dinosaur

creature takes the
stage, you can't help
but applaud. Call it
showmanship or call it
i taking an idea to its
| absurd conclusion,
I there is no better way

W to end a concert than
having a giant dinosaur

help you defeat Satan.
By the time you leave the show, your
white t-shirt is a trophy of sorts, a badge that
signifies you were in the pit. in the thick of
it all. It looks like they slaughtered Jackson
Pollack on your shirt, wl/ich I wouldn't put
it past them to do at their next show. Next
time they're in town. I recommend grab
bing a white t-shirt and going to experience
arguably one of the more over-the-top
shows around. If you are pregnant, nursing,
young, easily-offended or have a weak
stomach - well, maybe Guster is more your
thing.
