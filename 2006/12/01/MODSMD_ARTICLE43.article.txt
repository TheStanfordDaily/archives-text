## It's 'Brand New' 
### CHRIS HOLT BRAND NEW WRITER 
Out of Long Island's emo-core scene,
Brand New is rare animal in that it can be la
beled "emo" and "pioneering." "Deja Enten
du," released in 2003, took the band in a soft
er direction, where more emphasis was placed
on aesthetic and songwriting. To many fans,
"Deja Entendu" remains one of the best pure
emo albums ever. It stripped away much of
the faux peppiness and unnecessary angst-rid
den screams that have plagued the genre. As a
follow up and as the band's third album (first
on a major label), it does not disappoint.
In "The Devil and G0d...", Brand New de
liver a more eclectic album that once again fo
cuses on songwriting and brooding voices, in
terweaving themes of insanity, distance and
familiar emo archetypes. The themes are
placed among songs that range from mo
ments of pop-punk angst akin to their first
album to intimate confessions that defined
their second.
The theme of self-loathing that character
ized "Deja Entendu" is defined in darker but
equally refined ways. In "Millstone," front
man Jesse Lacey laments in his crooning whis
per: "I used to be such a burning example, I
used to be so original" while on "Sowing Sea
son" Lacey captures a losing battle with alco
holism, combining verses of twangy guitar and
rock anthem.
In "The Devil and G0d...". Brand New
runs off emo cliches faster than a kid with
Buddy Holly glasses and eye-liner. Woman as
source of pain? Check. Violent imagery?
C heck. Girl with metaphorical gun in hand?
Check. Yet, there is depth and musicianship
that allows them to just barely get away with
it. They don't seem to avoid the cliches or play
them for irony (as some of their contempo
raries have done); instead, they embellish or
revel in the standardized themes of the genre.
"You Won't Know" recalls the disgust with
relationships of their first album, "Your Fa
vorite Weapon," while "Not the Sun" serves
up its tale of heartbreak with a poppy falsetto

chorus that seems like a riff by The Darkness.
But they break new ground here too and
are just smart enough to pull it off. "Degauss
er" brings up the theme first introduced in the
name of the album â€” a reference to a schizo
phrenic friend of the band. In addition to
Lacey's distant crooning, the wailing and
childish back-up vocals that scream "Take
apart your head" suggest the schizoid demon
ic forces afflicting the subject. The song builds
to a pathetic, broken repetition of "The storm
is coming" that is arguably the emotional cen
terpiece of the album.
For old fans, "The Devil and G0d..." is full
of the biting lyrical cunning that Brand New is
famed for. In "Millstone", the singer laments,
"I used to know the name of every person 1
kissed/ Now I made this bed and I can't fall
asleep in it." In "Limousine," Laceys sings,
lullaby-like: "We found your man/ he's drink
ing up/ he's all-american/ And he'll drive/ He's
voluntarily graced/ to end your life"
Their more esoteric and referential lyrics
set them apart from other emo acts, and yet in
their striving for difference the major iniscue
of the album is the instrumental tracks. "Wel
come to Bangkok" and "Untitled" Ilex their
musicality, offering a complex use of distorted
guitars and keys while aiding the overall aes
thetic and atmosphere of the album. Overall,
though, they are forgettable and will likely not
appeal to their lyric-focused fan base.
