## It's class "Y" 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION HARPIST 
Joanna Newsom would never win
'American Idol.' Her singing is a little
harsh, and she has, in her own words,
too much "warble and rise, like a spar
row" in her voice.
This really is a pity, as she is more
talented than many of the show's pre
vious winners. "Ys" (pronounced, I
believe, ees), Newsom's latest record
released on Chicago's Drag City label,
is a splendid, sprawling epic of a
record that is utterly nuanced and
lovely.
Newsom plays a very unique instru
ment —a 'Lyon & Healy' style 11
pedal hard —so the sound of 'Ys' is
very different from most records.
Joining Newsom's voice and harp are
a multitude of other instruments: elec
tric guitars, banjos, violins, violas and
cellos. While Newsom's voice and
harp always are the dominant part of
the song, the accompanying instru
ments provide a dynamic and lush
contrast to the harp.
Just as Newsom's voice and harp
are unique, the record is also uncon
ventional. The record is comprised of
just five songs: 'Emily,' 'Monkey &
Bear,' 'Sawdust & Diamonds,' 'Only
Skin' and 'Cosmia.' But each of song
is no shorter than seven minutes, and
the entire record is a substantial 55
minutes long. Further distinguishing
the album is Newsom's European re
naissance-era theme: her cover art is
painted in a style vaguely reminiscent
of Botticelli, and Newsom's lyrics use
works like "thee," "musk" and "gen
teel curtsy."
And the lyrics that Newsom has cho
sen are gorgegous. They are poetry in
themselves, and when she puts the words
to music, the results are sublime. The
lyrics alternate from prose to gorgeous po
etry: "So: enough of this terror/We de
serve to know light/ and grow evermore
lighter and lighter/You would have seen
me through/But 1 could not undo that de
sire."
Of course, the lyrics would be
meaningless if they did not mesh effec
tively with the accompanying' music.
I his, however, is one of the strengths
of "Ys." Newsom's harp is wonderful.

always accompanying the lyrics per
fectly, regardless of the subject of
Newsom's lyrics. The sound of New
som's harp is conspicuously gorgeous,
flowing like water from cord to cord.
I had thought that the angelic harp
was only capable of a certain type of
sound: light and heavenly church
music. But "Ys" is indeed varied and
ranges between light and playful in
'Monkey & Bear' to a darker sound in
"Only Skin." Of course, it helps that
Newsom is backed by an orchestra,
but Newsom's harp is surprisingly ver
satile.
With songs as long as 17 minutes,
one might guess that the songs might

be a little boring at times. Bui this is
never the case. The songs, full of ten
derness and obvious passion, are al
ways moving and dynamic. In fact,
they move surprisingly quickly, and I
had to ask myself where the time went
after "Only Skin," the album's 17
minute song, because the song was so
varied and offered something unique
at every moment.
To be honest, my initial reaction to
"Ys" was that I was unimpressed. But
after I really listened attentively to
what she was singing, 1 was amazed.
The songs are deeply nuanced and
each new listen reveals something
new. But it also helps to have the lyric
sheet out to figure out exactly about
what Newsom's singing. And when
you do have the lyric sheet, you realize
that the songs aren't just great sound
ing, but they're also beautiful stories.
Newsom's renaissance theme in
"Ys" is clear sign of her connection
and debt to the past. But "Ys" takes
the past and moves forward, combin
ing the past and present to create an in
credible album. And while 1 will for
get last year's American Idol winner, 1
won't forget "Ys" any time soon, be
cause "Ys" is bound to become a clas
sic in the future.
