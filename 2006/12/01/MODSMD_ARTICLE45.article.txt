## Who is your Secret Santa this year?

Roxy concedes that at first glance Christmas doesn't really
*seem like one of the sexier holidays. For one, there's that whole
► Virgin Birth thing. Remind Roxy why Mary would want to skip
the fun part? But she begs you to look beyond such unappe-

tizing ideas and revel in the sexual potential of Christmas.
What exactly is your Christmas tree doing to the smiling
angel you so innocently plunked on top of it?
With the possible exception of Valentine's Day, Roxy
feels, Christmas is the most romantic holiday. It may not be
quite the hookup-haven that Thanksgiving supplied you
with, but let's face it — no one wants to be alone at Christ
mastime. Let this be your motto over the next few weeks,
and Roxy guarantees you'll be Jingle Bell Rockin' all the way
home. Roxy cordially invites you to her very special holiday
party. Sing out and rejoice, because there's no need for your
Christmas to be a Silent Night.
Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire
Baby, it's cold outside. Cute scarves, puffy jackets, rosy
cheeks. What better time than now to cozy up to someone
special? Start a different kind of fire this Christmas, and
don't stop until your and your partner's chest(and)nuts are
absolutely sizzling. Got some cherries, er, corn for poppin'?
Away In A Manger
The last few days and nights of fall quarter are the best tin

to move in on the hottie in your psych class. Console her after
she bombs the final until you worm your way right into her cozy
bed. His roommate is leaving early? You're not going to get a
better chance than this. Plus, it removes a lot of the awkward
ness of running into the other person next week in class. Even
if you do have a class or two together winter quarter, you've

each had a month to forget the experience ever happened.
I'll Be Home for Christmas
ne You're finally at home again for a decent amount of time,

and chances are most of your friends from high school have
made it back as well. Not to mention the homecoming royalty
you never had the guts to talk to. Roxy encourages you to make
Stanford proud. Show off what you've actually learned here,
you know, the real-life knowledge that can't be found in books.
Unless you're in the South Stacks.
Oh Come, All Ye Faithful
Been sticking with a hometown sweetie who's just no match
for your dorm's RCC this year? Perhaps you Saw Mommy
Kissing Santa Claus? Don't hesitate to cut things off this Christ
mas. It's best for everyone to start the New Year afresh. If
you've decided to keep at it, then by all means take advantage
of your time together this Christmas, without the need to sexile
anyone. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.
Santa Claus is Coming to Town
And we all know what that means: he's gonna find out who's
naughty or nice! But trust Roxy: he likes both. Mix it up this
Christmas. Mess around. Who could have guessed how much
that guy at the New Year's party would dig your elf costume, or
at least its kinky potential? Even if Santa gives you a lump of
coal, you'll get a lot more in your stocking this Christmas than
ever before.
Roxy hopes you enjoyed her Christmas party. Take a sprig
of mistletoe on your way out. She bids you farewell until the
New Year with a final Merry Christmas. Truly, it's the most
wonderful time of the year.
