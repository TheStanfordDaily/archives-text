### 
Have you ever gone to a job
fair and been left with the feel
ing that Stanford students only
go into consulting or investment
banking after graduation? Are
you not sure you exactly fit in
with the pre-med, pre-law or
pre-business crowd? The
Stanford Daily and the Career
Development Center have
teamed up to help you out.
Starting with today's Bio Tech
guide, we will be bringing you

special supplements with key
insights and information about
career choices outside the
Bubble. In this Bio Tech guide,
you'll be able to find key
resources from the CDC, stories
from experts in the field and a
list of important dates and dead
lines. We hope you'll find this
guide useful in learning more
about the field of biotechnology
and potential ways to get
involved.
