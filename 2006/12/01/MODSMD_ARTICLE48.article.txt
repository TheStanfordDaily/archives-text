# Career Overview:
## Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Industries 
### BEVERLY PRINCIPAL CAREER DEVELOPMENT CENTER 
Pharmaceutical companies
research, develop, produce and sell
chemical or biological substances for
medical or veterinary use. including
prescription, generic and OTC drugs;
vitamins and nutritional supple
ments; drug delivery systems and
diagnostic substances; and related
products, equipment, and services,
including distribution and wholesale.
The pharmaceutical industry is one
of the most profitable in the world —
spending and earning billions of dol
lars. The last decade has seen compa
nies merging with and acquiring
other firms to fill their drug pipelines

and expand sales forces.
Biotechnology companies engage
in genomics and its related fields,
particularly in the development and
selling of drugs, therapeutic prod
ucts. research equipment, and relat
ed research services. These employ
ers develop drugs and products to
treat HIV and other infections,
Alzheimer's disease, cancer and
schizophrenia, to name a few.
Historically, biotechnology orga
nizations have been much smaller
than pharmaceutical companies in
the number of employees and prof
itability. That has changed, howev
er, in the last ten years as some firms
have merged to form a stronger, sci
ence-based business. These compa

nies work with three unique busi
ness challenges: how to finance
highly risky investments in a finan
cial world of uncertainty and long
time horizons for R&D; how to
learn rapidly enough to keep pace
with advances in drug science
knowledge; and how to integrate
capabilities across a broad spectrum
of scientific and technological
knowledge bases.
The kind of work performed in
either industry will be exciting, chal
lenging, and, in the end, a benefit to
humanity. As you look at career
options, things to consider in addi
tion to the job and compensation
include the company si/e, record of
success, and work environment.
