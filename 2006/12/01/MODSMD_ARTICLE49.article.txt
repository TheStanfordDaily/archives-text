The T-Stat oximeter looks like a
slightly oversized ear bud. A few
inches long with a small round pad
at one end and a cord leading out of
the other, it hardly seems a life
saver. But the T-Stat can see some
thing no other oximeter can — the
amount of oxygen reaching the
body's tissues.
"Patients die in the hospital for
really only one reason: insufficient
oxygen in critical tissues," notes
David Benaron, MD, former
Stanford associate professor and
now president of Spectros in
Portola Valley, which developed
the T-Stat. "Whether it be a heart
attack, stroke, organ failure or trau
ma, it all comes down to this one
factor."
The T-Stat, in short, can save
your life. As if this weren't enough,
the monitor, which uses light waves
to measure oxygen concentration,
can also assess tissues, pinpointing
infection or even cancer. "It can and
will go places that we haven't even
imagined yet," predicts Benaron.
Benaron brought the $40,000
oximeter to market for $10 million
— a bargain when many medical

devices cost in the hundreds of mil
lions to develop. The T-Stat was just
one of about 3,000 new medical
devices on the U.S. market last year.
The last few decades have produced
so many of these gizmos — which
include small tools such as surgical
clamps and needles, large machines
such as X-ray equipment and wear
able devices such as artificial limbs
or pacemakers — that the U.S.
industry now comprises 5,000 com
panies, which rang up a total of $72
billion in 2005. Moreover, it's
expected to nearly double five years
from now, to $139 billion. By com
parison, consumer electronics rack
up $125 billion in sales annually.
Everyone wants the most
advanced medical care. But as costs
continue to rise, more people are
likely to lose their insurance, and the
cost of care might cause a consolida
tion of the health-care industry
resulting in many hospital shut
downs. Indeed, many experts won

patients the high-tech care they
desire. "New medical technology
and innovative devices can provide
indispensable treatment options,"
says Mark McClellan, MD, PhD,
who resigned in September as head
of the U.S. Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services. "Yet the costs of
development and inappropriate use
clearly contribute to the rising cost
of health care."
Some of these innovative devices
are truly mind-boggling: A laser
optical stretcher, which uses two
laser beams to squeeze a cell and
measure its elasticity (an indicator
of malignancy) might be able to test
for cancer with as few as 50 cells,
allowing dentists to spot oral cancer
with a cheek swab. Under develop
ment in Italy is a battery-powered
wand, waved over the body like the
tricorder in Star Trek. The device
has been found to detect 93 percent
of prostate tumors using tissue reso
nance interferometry, a method of
reading thermal energy.

In addition, researchers are
developing nano-robots that can
travel the bloodstream or explore
internal organs. Already, radio-con
trolled miniature robots sporting
cameras and biopsy needles have
removed gallbladders and prostate
glands in live pigs at the University
of Nebraska. After the pigs swal
lowed the robots, surgeons directed
them to cut through the stomach
wall into the abdominal cavity.
The same advances in technology
that allow us to listen to tunes from
a music player that fits in a chest
pocket, take photographs with a cell
phone and get directions from a box
in the car are propelling an astound
ing array of machines that are saving
lives or simply making life more liv
able. But these incredible devices
have other consequences: Not only
are these a force behind rising
health-care costs, they also pollute
the environment and the human
body, raise ethical concerns and fur
ther alienate patients who yearn for
hands-on care.
Gizmos through the ages
The first medical device presum
ably was a knife, though the cranial
drill might not have been far behind:
Ten-thousand-year-old skeletons
have been found throughout the
world with holes bored in their
skulls. At least as early as 2750 8.C.,
ancient Egyptians were wearing arti
ficial limbs and using tools to drain
abscessed teeth.
Roman emperor Nero, in A.D.
60, watched gladiator races through
an emerald, likely an extravagant
tool to correct his near-sightedness.
Tenth-century Arabs vastly
improved on the vision-correcting
glass lens, and by the time Marco
Polo visited China in 1266. he found
people wearing spectacles similar to
the modern-day variety.
Nineteenth-century America
produced what may be the low point
in the history of medical devices:
bloodletting machines — small
boxes with rotating blades to cut the
skin. But the same century gave
birth, in France, to the stethoscope,
a still-indispensable tool so closely

linked to medicine that comic-strip
physicians are rarely seen without
one.
In 1973 arrived the CAT scan,
that massive and at the time awe
inspiring machine that sees inside
the hodv in three dimensions; in
1979 came ultrasound. That technol
ogy, used to give a clear, real-time
picture without harmful X-rays, has
taken the medical device to a new
level: It's a toy for the very wealthy,
like actor Tom Cruise who bought
one to view his child in utero when
ever the mood struck, or even for a
middle-class family, which can visit
an imaging center at the mall to get
pictures of prenatal Junior.
Medical devices are now being
marketed where everyone can see
them: on television. Golf pro Jack
Nicklaus appears in commercials
talking about his artificial hip made
by Strvker and blues great 8.8. King
waxes poetic over his Ascensia glu
cose monitor. In a spot for the Fonar
upright MRI scanner, an actress
plays a patient who credits the
machine with giving her a more
accurate diagnosis than a reclining
scanner.
Better living through gadgetry
It was just 12 years ago that
Roland Popken, now 67, received
one of the first coronary artery
stents — now a commonplace treat
ment for atherosclerosis. He'd had
angioplasty a few months earlier,
but his artery quickly collapsed.
Alan Yeung, MD, professor of med
icine at Stanford, fitted Popken with
the stent in his left anterior descend
ing artery. Popken stayed in the hos
pital for 24 hours. "As soon as they
let me out of bed. I was out of there
and starting a normal life," he says.
"I was immediately better— I could
exercise and not run out of air.
There wasn't any discomfort."
Before stents were available, a
patient like Popken would have
undergone cardiovascular surgery,
which entails a week in the hospital
and months of recovery.
Gallbladder removal also used to

require a week in the hospital;
today, with instruments and cameras
mounted on scopes, physicians
make only three small incisions, and
the patient is usually home the next
day. Medical devices have freed so
many patients from radical, compli
cation-prone surgery that only 37
percent of surgeries were performed
on an inpatient basis in 2001, down
from more than SO percent in 1980.
Like Nicklaus, many osteoarthri
tis sufferers are playing golf again
because of artificial hips and knees
— manufactured joints that take the
place of the damaged ones. "It's a
quality-of-life operation," says
William Maloney. MD. chair of
orthopedic surgery at Stanford,
about hip and knee replacement
surgery. "You take patients with
chronic pain — maybe they're not
sleeping well, they're depressed —
and you're restoring them to normal
or near-normal function." And
spinal cord injury patients whose
breathing muscle no longer func
tions, like the late actor Christopher
Reeve, can leave the ventilator
behind thanks to a pacing system
that tells the diaphragm when to
contract.
More significantly, many people
are alive simply because of a device.
The mammogram machine, which
flattens and holds breasts still to pro
vide a better X-ray. is credited for
about half of the drop in breast can
cer deaths from 1990 to 2000. The
implantable cardioverter defibrilla
tor, placed under the skin of patients
whose hearts have a tendency to
beat too quickly or quiver ineffec
tively, keeps track of the heart's
beating and. if needed, sends an elec
trical shock to restore the rhythm.
Reality check
As great as these devices are, the
growing reliance on them spells
trouble. Most immediately painful is
the expense. Says Laurence Baker,
PhD. associate professor of health
research and policy: "We all pay the
price. As health-care costs rise, we
collectively have to cover that bill."
Advances in medical technologies
are thought to account for half or
more of the growth in health-care
costs, and a large portion of the costs
are associated with new devices. We
pay through taxes that cover
Medicaid and Medicare and through
higher health-insurance premiums.
As insurance becomes more
expensive, a growing number of
employers are dropping coverage,
retirees are losing what they've
come to expect and more private
pay individuals are relinquishing
insurance all together. The result is
more Americans who lack health
care coverage — now about 45 mil
lion. So while those with health
insurance grumble about rising pre
miums, those without insurance pay
for rising costs another way: They
receive worse care. Uninsured
patients wait longer for appoint
ments and forgo preventive care and
medications they can't afford.
Although a car accident victim with
out insurance will be treated in an
emergency room — legally, the hos
pital can't refuse such a patient
treatment — the patient may not
receive follow-up care such as phys
ical therapy or surgery because the

out-uf-pockct cost is too high, notes
Kate Bundorf, PhD, assistant pro
fessor of health research and policy.
A small number of devices do
save money. For patients with rapid
heartbeats, for example, a catheter
with an electrode can destroy a tiny
area of the heart, putting a stop to
the extra impulses that cause the fast
beating. The procedure costs $8,000,
but it often eliminates the need for
medication and reduces trips to the
emergency room. Money-saving
devices are rare, however: "It's much
more common to have something
that's effective but not cost-saving,"
says Douglas Owens, MD, senior
investigator at the VA Palo Alto
Health Care System and professor of
medicine. Rather than reduce the
cost of care, most devices treat peo
ple who would either have died or
simply lived with their symptoms.
Implantable cardioverter defibrilla
tors, for example, save lives, but at a
price of at least $40,000 to $60,000
per implantation. And until
iaparoscopy was available for gall
bladder removal, many people chose
to live with gallstones rather than
undergo traditional open-abdomen
surgery. More than 500,000 now
have the laparoscopic procedure
each year in the United States.
These devices aren't just expen
sive — they're polluting. The manu
facture of polyvinyl chloride, aka
vinyl, used in tubing, blood pressure
cuffs, breast pumps and many other
devices, releases dioxins. And, once
clinicians and patients are done with
the devices, hospitals frequently
burn them, which also releases diox
ins. In 1994, medical waste incinera
tion was the leading contributor to
dioxin poisoning; today, because
fewer hospitals are burning waste,
it's around third place.
Dioxins can cause cancer, harm
to the reproductive system, develop
mental delays and increased suscep
tibility to infection. Once dis
charged. they ultimately settle down
and enter the food chain, winding up
in the milk, meat and fish that most
of us eat. "The stuff doesn't break
down," says Stacy Malkan of Health
Care Without Harm, a public health
advocacy group based in Arlington,
Va. "It doesn't go away. It's in the
air or in the landfill or in the water.
It's a huge problem."
Another treacherous chemical in
medical devices is di(2-ethylhexyl)
phthalate, which is added to
polyvinyl chloride to make it flexible
— an obvious benefit for threading
a catheter in a vein or other vessel.
DEHP is less threatening to the
environment than it is to patients:
Animal studies have shown that
DEHP harms the reproductive sys
tems of young males. For this rea
son, the FDA has warned against
using devices containing it on preg
nant women and boys.
Testing medical devices presents
another challenge, one that's even
thornier than for pharmaceuticals.
Because frequently a physician will
hatch an idea for a medical device,
develop it, then start a company to
produce and sell it, a conflict of
interest can arise. The physician
who develops a device is often ideal
ly suited to test it out. as he or she
best understands its use. But if that
physician is part of the testing.

"there's a possibility of bias from the
financial interest," says Mildred
Cho, PhD, associate director of
Stanford's Center for Biomedical
Ethics and associate professor of
pediatrics. Physicians might be so
eager to prove a device's value, Cho
says, that they could overlook side
effects or, if study subjects are hard
to find, admit some despite disquali
fying health conditions.
And of course, medical devices
have an inherent downside: They
can fail. Nearly 300,000 people with

pacemakers or defibrillators have
learned since 2005 that their life-sav
ing machines made by Guidant
(since purchased by Boston
Scientific) might not give their
hearts a zap when it's needed. Faulty
batteries and other parts were used
in the devices' manufacture.
Unfortunately, patients can't count
on government oversight to prevent
these defects, as the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, which over
sees medical devices, has slacked off
on inspections. From 2000 to 2005,
the agency's warning letters to med
ical device manufacturers dropped
by two-thirds — and this in a rapidly
growing field.
Perhaps the least understood side
effect of medical devices is the dam
age they do to the relationship
between a physician and patient.
"Devices tend to redefine medicine
by tool and procedure." says psychi
atrist David Spiegel. MD. medical
director of the Center for
Integrative Medicine at Stanford.
"They give the sense of just fixing a
machine." But physicians who treat
patients as people and not machines
realize better outcomes. "It's
because of modern medical technol
ogy that people live." says Dennis
Goodman. MD, a cardiologist at the
Scripps Center for Integrative
Medicine in La Jolla. "But it has to
go hand in hand with taking care of
the whole patient."
Your electronic future
A few decades from now, med
ical deviceware could well be the lat
est fashion statement — cunningly

designed techno-trinkets clasping
wrists or peeking out from behind
an ear. Pacemakers will treat more
neurological and neuromuscular dis
eases and possibly cancer as well as
autoimmune diseases. Implantable
devices will dispense medication in
more accurate doses and at timely
intervals. "It's easy to foresee that a
55- or 65-year-old individual may
well have two or three devices
implanted or worn," says Molly Joel
Coye, MD, founder and CEO of the
Health Technology Center, a non
profit market research organization
in San Francisco.
Other devices will become part of
the furniture as more of them come
home with us. As devices shrink and
become increasingly user-friendly,
instruments that check vital signs,
reset heartbeats and clean blood will
reside on a bed stand. Many of these
will be available in a drugstore with
out a prescription.
As companies become more
aggressive and sophisticated in their
advertising — and as devices start
crowding the shelves of drugstores
— you might think that your life
would be much better if you had a
blood-oxygen monitor, or perhaps a
bracelet that tests for malaria para
sites. But advertising only highlights
a cultural problem: Americans
believe in receiving the best and
most intensive medical care possi
ble, even for 90-year-olds with mul
tiple health issues and poor quality
of life.
"Everyone wants the latest and
greatest," says David Magnus, direc
tor of the Center for Biomedical
Ethics. "As long as we want every
thing, costs will continue to spiral."
How can our society continue to
pay for top-quality care — for
everyone, not just those who can
afford to pay for it themselves?
Perhaps a greater number of med
ical devices will save money: As
more self-diagnostic or self-treat
ment tools come on the market, for
example, we could avoid large num
bers of unnecessary visits to the clin
ic or hospital. There is also plenty of
opportunity to cut waste from our
inefficient health-care system.
Physicians are reimbursed well
when they perform procedures such
as surgery on end-stage cancer
patients; not so well when they
screen patients for cancer. "We pay
a lot for ineffective care, duplicative
services, medical errors and pre
ventable complications," says
Medicare's McClellan, who's an
associate professor in economics
and medicine on leave from
Stanford. He adds that the agency is
altering its reimbursement pattern
to cover care that's proven to be
helpful.
Yet these developments likely
won't trim costs enough. Insurers
already limit coverage, paying only a
portion of fertility treatments and
refusing to cover experimental pro
cedures. Will the day come when the
baby boomers, brought up in the
world of access, will be forced to
accept limits? Undoubtedly, insur
ance will cover only the most effec
tive — and most cost-efficient —
care. It'll be easy enough to get a
colonoscopy, but if you're a 75-year
old hoping for a defibrillator, per
haps you'll be out of luck..
