The T-Stat oximeter looks like a
slightly oversized ear bud. A few
inches long with a small round pad
at one end and a cord leading out of
the other, it hardly seems a life
saver. But the T-Stat can see some
thing no other oximeter can — the
amount of oxygen reaching the
body's tissues.
"Patients die in the hospital for
really only one reason: insufficient
oxygen in critical tissues," notes
David Benaron, MD, former
Stanford associate professor and
now president of Spectros in
Portola Valley, which developed
the T-Stat. "Whether it be a heart
attack, stroke, organ failure or trau
ma, it all comes down to this one
factor."
The T-Stat, in short, can save
your life. As if this weren't enough,
the monitor, which uses light waves
to measure oxygen concentration,
can also assess tissues, pinpointing
infection or even cancer. "It can and
will go places that we haven't even
imagined yet," predicts Benaron.
Benaron brought the $40,000
oximeter to market for $10 million
— a bargain when many medical

devices cost in the hundreds of mil
lions to develop. The T-Stat was just
one of about 3,000 new medical
devices on the U.S. market last year.
The last few decades have produced
so many of these gizmos — which
include small tools such as surgical
clamps and needles, large machines
such as X-ray equipment and wear
able devices such as artificial limbs
or pacemakers — that the U.S.
industry now comprises 5,000 com
panies, which rang up a total of $72
billion in 2005. Moreover, it's
expected to nearly double five years
from now, to $139 billion. By com
parison, consumer electronics rack
up $125 billion in sales annually.
Everyone wants the most
advanced medical care. But as costs
continue to rise, more people are
likely to lose their insurance, and the
cost of care might cause a consolida
tion of the health-care industry
resulting in many hospital shut
downs. Indeed, many experts won

patients the high-tech care they
desire. "New medical technology
and innovative devices can provide
indispensable treatment options,"
says Mark McClellan, MD, PhD,
who resigned in September as head
of the U.S. Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services. "Yet the costs of
development and inappropriate use
clearly contribute to the rising cost
of health care."
Some of these innovative devices
are truly mind-boggling: A laser
optical stretcher, which uses two
laser beams to squeeze a cell and
measure its elasticity (an indicator
of malignancy) might be able to test
for cancer with as few as 50 cells,
allowing dentists to spot oral cancer
with a cheek swab. Under develop
ment in Italy is a battery-powered
wand, waved over the body like the
tricorder in Star Trek. The device
has been found to detect 93 percent
of prostate tumors using tissue reso
nance interferometry, a method of
reading thermal energy.

In addition, researchers are
developing nano-robots that can
travel the bloodstream or explore
internal organs. Already, radio-con
trolled miniature robots sporting
cameras and biopsy needles have
removed gallbladders and prostate
glands in live pigs at the University
of Nebraska. After the pigs swal
lowed the robots, surgeons directed
them to cut through the stomach
wall into the abdominal cavity.
The same advances in technology
that allow us to listen to tunes from
a music player that fits in a chest
pocket, take photographs with a cell
phone and get directions from a box
in the car are propelling an astound
ing array of machines that are saving
lives or simply making life more liv
able. But these incredible devices
have other consequences: Not only
are these a force behind rising
health-care costs, they also pollute
the environment and the human
body, raise ethical concerns and fur
ther alienate patients who yearn for
hands-on care.
Gizmos through the ages
The first medical device presum
ably was a knife, though the cranial
drill might not have been far behind:
Ten-thousand-year-old skeletons
have been found throughout the
world with holes bored in their
skulls. At least as early as 2750 8.C.,
ancient Egyptians were wearing arti
ficial limbs and using tools to drain
abscessed teeth.
Roman emperor Nero, in A.D.
60, watched gladiator races through
an emerald, likely an extravagant
tool to correct his near-sightedness.
Tenth-century Arabs vastly
improved on the vision-correcting
glass lens, and by the time Marco
Polo visited China in 1266. he found
people wearing spectacles similar to
the modern-day variety.
Nineteenth-century America
produced what may be the low point
in the history of medical devices:
bloodletting machines — small
boxes with rotating blades to cut the
skin. But the same century gave
birth, in France, to the stethoscope,
a still-indispensable tool so closely

linked to medicine that comic-strip
physicians are rarely seen without
one.
In 1973 arrived the CAT scan,
that massive and at the time awe
inspiring machine that sees inside
the hodv in three dimensions; in
1979 came ultrasound. That technol
ogy, used to give a clear, real-time
picture without harmful X-rays, has
taken the medical device to a new
level: It's a toy for the very wealthy,
like actor Tom Cruise who bought
one to view his child in utero when
ever the mood struck, or even for a
middle-class family, which can visit
an imaging center at the mall to get
pictures of prenatal Junior.
Medical devices are now being
marketed where everyone can see
them: on television. Golf pro Jack
Nicklaus appears in commercials
talking about his artificial hip made
by Strvker and blues great 8.8. King
waxes poetic over his Ascensia glu
cose monitor. In a spot for the Fonar
upright MRI scanner, an actress
plays a patient who credits the
machine with giving her a more
accurate diagnosis than a reclining
scanner.
Better living through gadgetry
It was just 12 years ago that
Roland Popken, now 67, received
one of the first coronary artery
stents — now a commonplace treat
ment for atherosclerosis. He'd had
angioplasty a few months earlier,
but his artery quickly collapsed.
Alan Yeung, MD, professor of med
icine at Stanford, fitted Popken with
the stent in his left anterior descend
ing artery. Popken stayed in the hos
pital for 24 hours. "As soon as they
let me out of bed. I was out of there
and starting a normal life," he says.
"I was immediately better— I could
exercise and not run out of air.
There wasn't any discomfort."
Before stents were available, a
patient like Popken would have
undergone cardiovascular surgery,
which entails a week in the hospital
and months of recovery.
Gallbladder removal also used to
