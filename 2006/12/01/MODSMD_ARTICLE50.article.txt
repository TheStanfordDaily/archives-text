the job seeker's equivalent of mar

the skills they require, jobs not pub
licly advertised, ways to enter a spe

cific field, and inside information
about a particular organization's
culture and expectations. For tips
on how to conduct informational

The Stanford Alumni Association
maintains the Stanford Career

other alumni. They are willing to
discuss with students a variety of
subjects including job search
strategies, industry/company
information, career options and
other related areas.
A search of the database yielded

Networking Resources
What is networking? Networking
means connecting with people in a
field or organization in which you
wish to work, to ask for informa
tion, not a job. Networking, includ
ing informational interviewing, is
the job seeker's equivalent of mar
ket research. It is essential in learn
ing about fields and job functions,
the skills they require, jobs not pub
licly advertised, ways to enter a spe

cific field, and inside information
about a particular organization's
culture and expectations. For tips
on how to conduct informational
interviews, go to: http://cardinalca
reers.stanford.edu/networking/tips/.
The Stanford Alumni Association
maintains the Stanford Career
Network (http://www.stan
fordalumni.org/career/home.html)
, a database of alumni, who have
volunteered to conduct informa
tional interviews with students and
other alumni. They are willing to
discuss with students a variety of
subjects including job search
strategies, industry/company
information, career options and
other related areas.

189 alumni who are listed in the

toring.stanford.edu/) has developed pro

I he Internship Network (http://intern
ships.stanford.edu/network/) is a resource
that allows you to connect with other stu
dents to talk about their internship, sum
mer job, research or any other learning
experience. You can learn how to

approach a specific organization for oppor
tunities and get an insider's view on what it
was like to work or volunteer there.
