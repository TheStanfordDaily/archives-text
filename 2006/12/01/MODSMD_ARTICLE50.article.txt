ing informational interviewing, is
the job seeker's equivalent of mar
ket research. It is essential in learn
ing about fields and job functions,
the skills they require, jobs not pub
licly advertised, ways to enter a spe

cific field, and inside information
about a particular organization's
culture and expectations. For tips
on how to conduct informational
interviews, go to: http://cardinalca
