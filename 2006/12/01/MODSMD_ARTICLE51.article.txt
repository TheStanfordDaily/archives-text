# Remote Control

### KRISTA CONGER COURTESY OF STANFORD MEDICINE MAGAZINE 
Two-month-old Daniel Pham's
belly, protruding from sterile blue
surgical drapes and bristling with
specialized surgical instruments, was
the only visible part of his body on
the morning of Jan. 9, 2(X)4. His
operation was at a critical point
when pediatric surgeon Craig
Albanese, MP, turned his back and
walked away from the table. He did
n't return.
Daniel's fate was left in the hands
of a 7-foot-tall, three-armed surgical
robot called da Vinci. Hovering over
the table, the robot's spidery arms
clutched his small body like a help
less insect. As the surgery proceed
ed, the arms moved quickly and
jerkily, swooping around Daniel as if
wrapping him in an invisible web.
Although it might sound alarm
ing, the robot, which arrived at
Stanford last October, was on a tight
leash: Every move was controlled by
Albanese from a workstation posi
tioned against a wall in the operat
ing room, with the robot's unnerv
inglv jerky moves translated into
tinv, precise and very, very steady
maneuvers inside Daniel's body.
"We're changing the culture of
surgery," says Albanese, chief of
pediatric surgery. "Usually we have
our hands in there, feeling and
doing. Now we're taking several
steps away to sit at a remote console.
It's kind of an out-of-body experi
ence."
Albanese isn't alone. With the
advent of robotically assisted
surgery, physicians are swapping the
immediacy of warm flesh and blood
for the smooth plastic of computer
joysticks. More than 200 da Vinci
robots have been conscripted into

operating rooms worldwide, and the
scope of their influence seems
poised to grow — a bittersweet bar
gain driven by the promise of better
patient care.
"We're always looking for solu
tions to unsolved problems, whether
in the operating room or the labora
tory," says Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital surgeon-in-chief
Thomas Krummel, MD, who also

participated in Daniel's surgery.
"Although traditional open surgery
is very intuitive — we can pick
something up, see it in three dimen
sions and move it freely in space —
there's nothing therapeutic about
the accompanying large incisions,"
says Krummel, chair of Stanford's
surgery department. "Not only must
they he repaired, they can cause the
patient discomfort and become
infected."
Laparoscopic, or minimal access,
surgery has gained wide acceptance

in the recent past as an alternative to
many open surgeries. It relies on
small incisions and specialized
instruments to reduce patient dis
comfort and speed healing.
Laparoscopic surgery is not per
fect, however. Such tiny entry points
cause unavoidable technical prob
lems: Surgery must be viewed on a
monitor with the help of a small
internal camera and the laparoscop
ic instruments can't provide the tac
tile feedback and range of motion of
the human hand and wrist.
"Laparoscopic techniques allow
us to perform maximal surgery with
minimal access," says Krummel.
"But this advance comes at a price:
We've lost 3-D vision, and we've lost
a wrist. Most laparoscopic tools are
like long chopsticks. Imagine trying
to eat with your arm in a cast and
one eye closed; it feels a little clum
sy."
Laparoscopy also requires the
surgeon to adapt to an alternate
physical reality: to move the tip of
an instrument to the left, the end
outside the body must be moved to
the right. "You lose the correspon
dence between what you do and
what you see," says J. Kenneth
Salisbury, PhD, professor of com
puter science and of surgery.
The da Vinci Surgical System,
manufactured by Intuitive Surgical
Inc. based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is an
attempt by physicians and
researchers from around the country
including Salisbury and Krummel
— to have their cake and eat it too.
They're trying to deliver the benefits
of minimal access to the patient
while simultaneously returning to
the surgeon the look and feel of
open surgery. It's a tall order, but
they're making progress. Future ver
sions may come even closer [see
sidebar, next page].
One trade-off still exists, howev
er: the surgeons move closer to the
past by moving away from their
patient. As was obvious with
Daniel's surgery, da Vinci effective
ly shifts the center of the action from
the operating table to a console sta
tioned about 10 feet away from the
patient. The console, featuring an
overgrown version of a child's View-
Master with hand-operated joysticks
and foot pedals and a comfortable
seat, gives the surgeon a three
dimensional, magnified view of the
ongoing surgery.
The da Vinci gives the surgeon
total control of two instruments and
a camera; hand and foot movements
are translated into the steady, pre
cise and unrestricted movement of
the robot's arms, which hold special
ized surgical instruments with wrists
that approach a human's in mobility
and dexterity. Other members of the
team view the action on a monitor
perched next to the operating table.
"It's incredibly comfortable,"
says Albanese. "Surgery can be tire
some and economically unpleasant.
With the robot, I can place my head
in a comfortable viewing box and
rest my arms on a cushioned arm
rest. Then I go about moving my
hands and arms just like I would in a

traditional surgery. The console is so
quick and easy to get used to that
the learning curve is minimal."
Although it is physically easy for an
experienced surgeon to learn to use
the robot, the psychological learning
curve may be a bit more bumpy.
Salisbury has observed one surgeon
who, after performing most of an
operation with da Vinci's help,
stopped and temporarily wheeled
the robot away from the patient to
perform a critical cut by hand.
"When I asked him why, he said
'1 just wanted to make sure it was
right,' " says Salisbury, "and yet,
there was still an important role for
the robot to play in his operating
room. That's the kind of challenge
we're facing as we design the next
generation of machines: How do we
get that feeling back?"
The question is a difficult one. It's
obvious that, in many ways, working
at the console can seem more real
than virtual for some surgeons. "I've
seen surgeons using the robot who
drop the needle in the patient and
move their head from the viewing
box to look for it near their own
hands," says Salisbury, who helped
develop the flexible wrists used by
the da Vinci's instruments.
A microphone connected to a
speaker near the operating table
amplifies the surgeon's voice for the
rest of the surgical team, instructing
them when to swap instruments,
commenting on the procedure, or
conferring with the surgeon at the
patient's side.
"The robot filters out any hand
tremor and scales motion." says
Albanese. "I can move my hands 5
centimeters, and the instrument
moves only 1. This allows more
sweeping motions and increases the

comfort and precision of the
surgery. The range of motion is also
much greater than with laparoscopic
instruments."
One drawback to the robotic sys
tem, though, is the absence of any
sense of touch or force feedback It's
no longer possible for a surgeon to
feel the texture or firmness of an
organ or to use resistance to judge
when a suture is perfectly tied.
"We now rely on visual cues to
tell us if we're grasping too firmly or
pulling too hard on a knot," says
Albanese, "so the robot is still not
perfect."
Surgery also requires exquisite
teamwork, and incorporating da
Vinci into the mix is like inviting a
bossy elephant into already tight
quarters. Every incision must be
carefully planned to allow a lull
range of motion for each robotic
arm, which together monopolize a
hemisphere of space above the
patient. Human members of the sur
gical team are relegated to dodging
the moving arms while using addi
tional incisions, or ports, to provide
suction or to retract organs or tissue.
"I don't work in a vacuum,"' says
Albanese. "The robot sits idle and
collects dust unless I have a scrub
nurse who's fabulous and an anes
thesiologist who has bought into the
idea and doesn't mind the change in
culture." It's also necessary for an
experienced surgeon to remain at
the operating table to monitor the
patient's condition and swap the
instruments attached to the robot's
arms.
"The surgeon sitting at the con
sole has the easy part," says

Using innovative technology and techniques, surgeons can now practice
remote incisions wtih minimal access. Robotic surgery has a price, however,
which includes a loss of 3-D vision and wrist flexibility.
