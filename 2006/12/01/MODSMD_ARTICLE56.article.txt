# Sub-Saharan Africa
## The 						unhealthiest place on the planet for children 
### RUTHANN RICHTER COURTESY OF STANFORD MEDICINE MAGAZINE 
Tolea was born early one Sunday morning
in August and left in a paper bag on the gray
picket fence outside the parish church in
Naivasha, Kenya. Two passing parishioners
heard her cry and brought the girl, still bathed
in her mother's fluids, to the home of the
parish priest. Father Daniel Kiriti.
It was hardly the first time the priest had
seen an abandoned child. He runs an orphan
age full of these youngsters — children left at
bus stops or rescued from the streets. For
Naivasha, with its lake of many thousand
flamingos and luxury hotels that cater to
Western tourists, is a town plagued by AIDS.
Even the priest has family members sick or
lost to the disease. Tolea was a sign of just how
much his community was crumbling under the
disease, and how children were suffering as a
result.
After Kiriti choked back his tears, he took
the newborn to the government hospital down
the dusty street. There he learned she was
HI V-positive.
A month after her birth, I would meet
Tolea, a sweet, chubby-cheeked child whose
home now is a closet-sized room at the church
orphanage. She nestles contentedly in the
arms of the housemother, her black skin glow
ing against her bright yellow sweater and
pants.
"This child is in good hands," says the
American-educated priest. "But there are
many, many more children who have no one
to take care of them. Many die young because
they have no one to care for them. So I'm not
very optimistic for the children."
A child born in sub-Saharan Africa today has
the odds stacked heavily against her. While
child deaths have declined throughout the
world, sub-Saharan Africa remains the excep
tion. Today, nine children under the age of 5
die every minute in the region — 4.8 million
deaths a vear, according to the U.N.

Development Project. The numbers are hard
to fathom; imagine the entire population of
San Francisco dissolving into the ocean six
times each year.
The African youngsters die of many causes:
malaria, respiratory infections, diarrheal dis
eases and AIDS are among the prime killers,
compounded by perpetual problems of pover
ty, malnutrition and lack of safe drinking
water and sanitation. A million children die
every year of malaria, for instance, many for
lack of a $3 bed net to ward off disease-ridden
mosquitoes. But what underlies the staggering
rate of childhood death is the AIDS pandem
ic, which has led to neglect of youngsters and
their basic health needs. For not only does
AIDS kill children, but it increases their sus
ceptibility to other ailments and has destroyed
the family and social networks on which their
well-being depends.
Not long ago, the odds for surviving child
hood in the region were improving. After the
launch in the 1970s of the World Health
Organization's campaign to vaccinate young
children against major killers such as polio,
diphtheria and tetanus, the number of deaths
among young children in Africa and other
underdeveloped countries fell dramatically.
But the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan
Africa has wiped out all those gains.
I saw some of these problems myself when
I visited Kenya for the first time in March 2004
at the urging of my friend and former Stanford
graduate-school roommate, documentary
photographer Karen Ande. Karen had been
there five times before, photographing chil
dren and families affected by the epidemic,
and she'd been transformed into an
activist/fundraiser in the process.
She wanted a collaborator — a writer —
who could help open people's eyes to the
problem. I had written about AIDS in the
early days while a staff writer at UC-San
Francisco, but nothing could prepare me for
the emotional blast that comes from encoun
ters with orphaned children out in the African
bush, sleeping on dirty scraps of foam or living
in tin shanties tending to emaciated parents
too weak to lift their heads to eat. Like Karen,
I became a convert to the cause.
In September 2005, we returned to Kenya
to visit and garner more material for our writ
ings, exhibits and presentations. This time I
came armed with my Stanford credentials,
which opened the way to meetings with spe
cialists in children's health.
The first stop was Kenyatta National
Hospital in Nairobi, a teaching hospital and
the country's flagship medical center. There I
met Ruth Nduati, MD, a professor of pedi
atrics and a leading expert on pediatric AIDS.
The government medical center is a maze of
cement-block walls, with the eight-story,
2,000-bed hospital rising like a bunker out of
the core. The corridors were dirty and the
halls teemed with waiting patients and fami
lies.
Nduati is a tall, lanky woman with an
intense look. She appears haggard and with
good reason. In the pediatric ward at the hos
pital, she says, the children lie three to a bed
— KM) youngsters in a ward designed for 35.
Three nurses and two nurses' aides are
charged with caring for the ward's children. I
learn later than some 30 percent of the chil
dren admitted to the national hospital die
there.
Nduati says 30.000 to 40.000 children in
Kenya are born HIV-positive every year. Sixty
to 70 percent die before their fifth birthday,
she says with a grave look. Nearly all children
with HIV get the virus from their mothers, so

stopping this transmission could turn the crisis
around. Nduati helped develop a national pro
tocol to reduce transmission rates by treating
HIV-positive pregnant women and their
babies with antiretroviral drugs — a strategy
applied some years ago in the United States
that has reduced the number of infected
babies to nearly zero.
Some Kenyan women now get these drugs
before and during labor; their babies are treat
ed just after birth. The program is funded in
part by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief, which is starting to make a
difference for women and children in Kenya.
Nduati says.
After the sobering hospital visit, we ride
across town to the upscale Muthaiga district to
meet with officials at the private, nonprofit
Gertrude's Garden Children's Hospital. It sits
on a hill on a winding, two-lane, tree-lined
road near the home of the U.S. Ambassador
and an Amcrican-style shopping mall. It's a
pristine, open-air facility with 28 beds and
brightly colored murals. The largest children's
hospital between Egypt and South Africa, it is
Kenya's equivalent to Stanford's Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital — a specialty
care facility that serves a mix of patients, both
insured and uninsured.
Tending to kids with AIDS
The hospital has been in the forefront of
developing protocols for a variety of pediatric
problems, including pediatric AIDS. Among
Kenya's 15 million children, some 120,0(X) are
living with HIV today, and 1.5(H) to 2,000 —
fewer than 2 percent — have access to anti
retroviral drugs, or ARVs, says Gordon
Odundo. the hospital's chief executive officer.
It's only in the last few months that pediatric
formulations of ARVs, long in use in the
United States, have become available in
Kenya, Odundo says. "Children have been
neglected." he says apologetically. Now the
hospital plans to put another 500 children on
these life-saving drugs within a year, including
youngsters in the Nairobi slums.
Daisy Kaane, 12, a patient at Gertrude's
Garden, is one of the rare HIV-positive chil
dren in Kenya now being treated with anti
retrovirals. She is asleep in a private room
when we arrive; her mother, Edna Kaane, is

drugs.
