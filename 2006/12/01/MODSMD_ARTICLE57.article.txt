leaning over the girl's bed with a look of dis
tress. She says Daisy was first diagnosed as
HIV-positive last October, when she was suf
fering high fevers and frequent bouts ol
coughing. She was found to have tuberculosis,
which infects those with HIV much more
readily than others. She has other problems as
well, including headaches and seizures. Her
physical health has improved since she went
on ARVs, her mother says. But the young girl
is having trouble coping with the disease; she
is afraid to go to school and is not progressing
in her studies, says her mother, a neatly
dressed woman who works in the finance
department of a local company.
"Her main problem is psychological," Daisy's
mother says. "She knows what ARVs are. She
has started asking so many questions. 'Why
me?'"
The mother says she doesn't know how to
respond. "How do we pass the information on
to her? It might break her. She might give up,"
she says.
The conversation never turns to the issue
of how the girl became infected, for it's an
extremely sensitive topic. When a society
attaches stigma to the disease, as is the case
in Kenya, parents often fail to have their
children tested because a positive result can
implicate the whole family, says Emily
Nguu, the nursing director at Gertrude's
Garden.
As we leave the hospital, Colin Forbes,
MD, a consulting pediatrician there, offers to
drive us back to the hotel, on the way pouring
out his frustrations. As he deftly
makes his way through Nairobi's
notorious rush-hour traffic, he rails
against a medical care system that
allows children to die of diseases
that are entirely preventable and
treatable.
"The primary cause of death is
the too-sick, too-late syndrome,"
says the Canadian-trained physician.
"You can call it bronchitis or neona
tal tetanus or gastroenteritis or ane
mia. All these things are pre
ventable. The children come too
late, and they are too sick to be
saved."
He bemoans Kenya's lack of
medical resources and health-care
personnel to put basic pediatric
practice into action.
"Eight out of 10 children can't
get electrolyte treatment for diar
rhea. I'm ashamed of that," Forbes
says. "Most district hospitals can't
treat severe diarrhea with elec
trolytes and fluids because they
don't have the IVs or the laborato
ries."
I le says corruption at many lev
els leads to the disappearance of
medications and vital equipment
from government facilities, robbing
children of decent care. "I'm angry
I can't accept what they're doing
to the African child," he says.
Ministering to orphans
While many children die of
HIV/AIDS, the disease has an insid
ious impact on those who survive,
only to lose their parents to the dis
ease. An estimated 15 million chil
dren in sub-Saharan Africa have lost
one or both parents to AIDS,
including 650.000 in Kenya
(although some believe the number
is closer to a million), according to
the United Nations Joint
Programme on HIV/AIDS.
During my first visit to Kenya,
we met with some orphaned boys
who wandered the streets of Gilgil,
a town about a 40-minute drive
from Naivasha on dusty, pock
marked roads. The boys had been
scrounging in garbage bins for food
and pestering shopkeepers with
petty thievery. A local businessman
had set them up in a rented tin
shack and given them a bit of
money for food, as well as odd jobs
to keep them occupied. One of the
hoys had come down with malaria
during our visit; he was lolling about
on the ground on a dirty, worn-out
sleeping bag.
A local cafe owner, Jane
Kinuthia, recognized the growing
need for a children's shelter and set
up the Saidia orphanage in 2004 in a
cement-block building she'd used
lor her defunct catering business.
She and her colleague, social worker
Teresa Wahito, now run a shelter
tor 28 children with financial help
from Jill Simpson, a retired nurse
and longtime children's advocate.
During a visit to the orphanage,
we meet Mary Maishon, a toddler
with a broad forehead and bowed
logs. After Mary's mother died of
AIDS, her grandmother abandoned
the family, leaving Mary and her sib
lings with their grandfather, a casual
laborer and alcoholic who left them
alone much of the time. The three
children had been living in a one
room metal shack, sleeping on a dirt

floor with a single blanket to cover
them in the chilly highland town on
the fringe of the Rift Valley.
When Mary came to the orphan
age in July 2004, she was thin, did
not speak at all and scooted around
on her knees, Kinuthia says. Mary
now walks and is extremely talka
tive. One bright afternoon, she
joins the other children on the
weed-covered lawn outside the
orphanage, smiling and singing
songs while munching on a special
treat ot butter biscuits and pineap
ple juice from her American visi
tors. But Mary still has bouts of
depression, periodically becoming
withdrawn, unable to eat or go to
the bathroom, Kinuthia says. She
imagines her grandfather will come
someday and give her sweets and
hold her hand.
"They (Mary and her siblings]
have feelings that they have been
rejected and thrown away and
nobody wants them," Kinuthia
says.
Government and other service
organizations offer little psychoso
cial support for orphans, who may
suffer the progressive loss of family
members, and in some cases, separa
tion from siblings.
"These children are traumatized
before their parents die, and as their
parents die, it's a continuation of the

same trauma," Nduati says. Many
have the same severe emotional
trauma as children who sur-vived
the genocide in Rwanda, she adds.
She and others say the AIDS epi
demic is producing a generation of
children ripe for recruitment by ter
rorist groups in a region already
fraught with political and social
instability.
"The orphans not only have their
own suffering but have the potential
for adding to security risks in the
region," she says.
What to do. what to do?
So, where lies the solution? On
the global level, the answer is
embodied in campaigns like the
U.N. Millennium Project, which
aims to cut poverty in half and
reduce the under-5 mortality rate in
sub-Saharan Africa bv two-thirds by
2015. Jeffrey Sachs, PhD, the
Columbia University economist
who directs the project, maps out a
strategy for these goals in his latest
book. The End of Poverty.

"...One cannot fight a war against
weapons of mass destruction
through military means alone,"
Sachs writes. "The weapons of mass
salvation ... Anti-AIDS drugs, anti
malarial bed nets, bore wells for safe
drinking water and the like — can
save millions of lives and also be a
bulwark for global security."
I ask people both here and in
Kenya about the Millennium
Project, and they agree it's an
admirable plan, but it isn't working.
Sachs acknowledges that the pro
gram is falling behind, in part
because developed countries, espe
cially the United States, have been
unwilling to commit the funds to
carry it out.
"The Millennium goals are really
important in the policy environment
and for our political leadership.
They're long overdue and provide a
clear framework. But they're not the
whole answer," says Jennifer
Astone, executive director of the
overdue and provide a clear frame
work. But they're not the whole
answer," says Jennifer Astone, exec
utive director of the Firelight
Foundation in Santa Cruz, Calif.,
which supports community-based
organizations helping vulnerable
children affected by HIV/AIDS.
"There is the issue of how it's trans
lated on the ground to help kids.
You do that by engaging families
and communities."
She and others, including Forbes,
the pediatrician, argue for directing
more resources to grassroots organi
zations that can mobilize people at
the village level.
The solution, too, lies in the
resilience and resourcefulness of
many Kenyans — people like
Father Kiriti, who, despite an
avalanche of problems, continue to
approach life with dignity and spirit
and a determination to make things
better.
The priest, who privately grieves
for family members ill with the dis
ease. devotes much of his energy to
actively preaching HIV prevention,
such as condom use and other
behavior changes. Only through
such changes can the suffering end.
"Nature is going to take its own
course," he says one morning over
tea. "We will hit the bottom" before
things improve. But then a better
day will come.

we meet Mary Maishon, a toddler
with a broad forehead and bowed
logs. After Mary's mother died of
AIDS, her grandmother abandoned
the family, leaving Mary and her sib
lings with their grandfather, a casual
laborer and alcoholic who left them
alone much of the time. The three
children had been living in a one
room metal shack, sleeping on a dirt

floor with a single blanket to cover
them in the chilly highland town on
the fringe of the Rift Valley.
When Mary came to the orphan
age in July 2004, she was thin, did
not speak at all and scooted around
on her knees, Kinuthia says. Mary
now walks and is extremely talka
tive. One bright afternoon, she
joins the other children on the
weed-covered lawn outside the
orphanage, smiling and singing
songs while munching on a special
treat ot butter biscuits and pineap
ple juice from her American visi
tors. But Mary still has bouts of
depression, periodically becoming
withdrawn, unable to eat or go to
the bathroom, Kinuthia says. She
imagines her grandfather will come
someday and give her sweets and
hold her hand.
"They (Mary and her siblings]
have feelings that they have been
rejected and thrown away and
nobody wants them," Kinuthia
says.
Government and other service
organizations offer little psychoso
cial support for orphans, who may
suffer the progressive loss of family
members, and in some cases, separa
tion from siblings.

parents die, it's a continuation of the

same trauma," Nduati says. Many
have the same severe emotional
trauma as children who sur-vived
the genocide in Rwanda, she adds.
She and others say the AIDS epi
demic is producing a generation of
children ripe for recruitment by ter
rorist groups in a region already
fraught with political and social
instability.
"The orphans not only have their
own suffering but have the potential
for adding to security risks in the
region," she says.
What to do. what to do?
So, where lies the solution? On
the global level, the answer is
embodied in campaigns like the
U.N. Millennium Project, which
aims to cut poverty in half and
reduce the under-5 mortality rate in
sub-Saharan Africa bv two-thirds by
2015. Jeffrey Sachs, PhD, the
Columbia University economist
who directs the project, maps out a
strategy for these goals in his latest
book. The End of Poverty.

"...One cannot fight a war against
weapons of mass destruction
through military means alone,"
Sachs writes. "The weapons of mass
salvation ... Anti-AIDS drugs, anti
malarial bed nets, bore wells for safe
drinking water and the like — can
save millions of lives and also be a
bulwark for global security."
I ask people both here and in
Kenya about the Millennium
Project, and they agree it's an
admirable plan, but it isn't working.
Sachs acknowledges that the pro
gram is falling behind, in part
because developed countries, espe
cially the United States, have been
unwilling to commit the funds to
carry it out.
"The Millennium goals are really
important in the policy environment
and for our political leadership.
They're long overdue and provide a
clear framework. But they're not the
whole answer," says Jennifer
Astone, executive director of the
overdue and provide a clear frame
work. But they're not the whole
answer," says Jennifer Astone, exec
utive director of the Firelight
Foundation in Santa Cruz, Calif.,
which supports community-based
organizations helping vulnerable
children affected by HIV/AIDS.
"There is the issue of how it's trans
lated on the ground to help kids.
You do that by engaging families
and communities."
She and others, including Forbes,
the pediatrician, argue for directing
more resources to grassroots organi
zations that can mobilize people at
the village level.
The solution, too, lies in the
resilience and resourcefulness of
many Kenyans — people like
Father Kiriti, who, despite an
avalanche of problems, continue to
approach life with dignity and spirit
and a determination to make things
better.
The priest, who privately grieves
for family members ill with the dis
ease. devotes much of his energy to
actively preaching HIV prevention,
such as condom use and other
behavior changes. Only through
such changes can the suffering end.
"Nature is going to take its own
course," he says one morning over
tea. "We will hit the bottom" before
things improve. But then a better
day will come.

leaning over the girl's bed with a look of dis
tress. She says Daisy was first diagnosed as
HIV-positive last October, when she was suf
fering high fevers and frequent bouts ol
coughing. She was found to have tuberculosis,
which infects those with HIV much more
readily than others. She has other problems as
well, including headaches and seizures. Her
physical health has improved since she went
on ARVs, her mother says. But the young girl
is having trouble coping with the disease; she
is afraid to go to school and is not progressing
in her studies, says her mother, a neatly
dressed woman who works in the finance
department of a local company.
"Her main problem is psychological," Daisy's
mother says. "She knows what ARVs are. She
has started asking so many questions. 'Why
me?'"
The mother says she doesn't know how to
respond. "How do we pass the information on
to her? It might break her. She might give up,"
she says.
The conversation never turns to the issue
of how the girl became infected, for it's an
extremely sensitive topic. When a society
attaches stigma to the disease, as is the case
in Kenya, parents often fail to have their
children tested because a positive result can
implicate the whole family, says Emily
Nguu, the nursing director at Gertrude's
Garden.
As we leave the hospital, Colin Forbes,
MD, a consulting pediatrician there, offers to
drive us back to the hotel, on the way pouring
out his frustrations. As he deftly
makes his way through Nairobi's
notorious rush-hour traffic, he rails
against a medical care system that
allows children to die of diseases
that are entirely preventable and
treatable.
"The primary cause of death is
the too-sick, too-late syndrome,"
says the Canadian-trained physician.
"You can call it bronchitis or neona
tal tetanus or gastroenteritis or ane
mia. All these things are pre
ventable. The children come too
late, and they are too sick to be
saved."
He bemoans Kenya's lack of
medical resources and health-care
personnel to put basic pediatric
practice into action.
"Eight out of 10 children can't
get electrolyte treatment for diar
rhea. I'm ashamed of that," Forbes
says. "Most district hospitals can't
treat severe diarrhea with elec
trolytes and fluids because they
don't have the IVs or the laborato
ries."
I le says corruption at many lev
els leads to the disappearance of
medications and vital equipment
from government facilities, robbing
children of decent care. "I'm angry
I can't accept what they're doing
to the African child," he says.
Ministering to orphans
While many children die of
HIV/AIDS, the disease has an insid
ious impact on those who survive,
only to lose their parents to the dis
ease. An estimated 15 million chil
dren in sub-Saharan Africa have lost
one or both parents to AIDS,
including 650.000 in Kenya
(although some believe the number
is closer to a million), according to
the United Nations Joint
Programme on HIV/AIDS.
During my first visit to Kenya,
we met with some orphaned boys
who wandered the streets of Gilgil,
a town about a 40-minute drive
from Naivasha on dusty, pock
marked roads. The boys had been
scrounging in garbage bins for food
and pestering shopkeepers with
petty thievery. A local businessman
had set them up in a rented tin
shack and given them a bit of
money for food, as well as odd jobs
to keep them occupied. One of the
hoys had come down with malaria
during our visit; he was lolling about
on the ground on a dirty, worn-out
sleeping bag.
A local cafe owner, Jane
Kinuthia, recognized the growing
need for a children's shelter and set
up the Saidia orphanage in 2004 in a
cement-block building she'd used
lor her defunct catering business.
She and her colleague, social worker
Teresa Wahito, now run a shelter
tor 28 children with financial help
from Jill Simpson, a retired nurse
and longtime children's advocate.
During a visit to the orphanage,
we meet Mary Maishon, a toddler
with a broad forehead and bowed
logs. After Mary's mother died of
