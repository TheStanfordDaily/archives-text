Networking Resources
What is networking? Networking
means connecting with people in a
field or organization in which you
wish to work, to ask for information,
not a job. Networking, including
informational interviewing, is the
job seeker's equivalent of market
research. It is essential in learning
about fields and job functions, the
skills they require, jobs not publicly
advertised, ways to enter a specific
field, and inside information about a
particular organization's culture and
expectations. For tips on how to
conduct informational interviews,
go to: http://cardinalcareers.stan
ford.edu/networking/tips/.
Stanford Immersion in Medicine
Series (SIMS)
(http://cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/
shadow/premed/), is a unique, on
campus opportunity for undergradu
ates to experience clinical care from
the physician's perspective. The goal
of the program is to not only expose
students to medicine, but also help
them develop a working relationship
with a local physician.
The Stanford Alumni Association
maintains the Stanford Career
Network (http://www.stanfordalum
ni.org/career/home.html), a database
of alumni, who have volunteered to
conduct informational interviews

with students and other alumni.
They are willing to discuss with stu
dents a variety of subjects including
job search strategies, industry/com
pany information, career options and
other related areas.
Other great networking resources
include:
The Shadow Program (http://cardi
nalcareers.stanford.edu/shadow/)
gives students a chance to shadow
(spend a day on the job with) a pro
fessional in order to gain a better
awareness of the working world.
Stanford Alumni Mentoring
(http://mentoring.stanford.edu/) has
developed proprietary software to
match students and alumni based on
their background and interests. This
allows both parties to bypass an oth
erwise tedious hand-matching
process, and ensures they can start
the relationship with a few things in
common.
The Internship Network
(http://internships.stanford.edu/net
work/) is a resource that allows you
to connect with other students to
talk about their internship, summer
job, research or any other learning
experience. You can learn how to
approach a specific organization for
opportunities and get an insider's
view on what it was like to work or
volunteer there.

Networking Resources
What is networking? Networking
means connecting with people in a
field or organization in which you
wish to work, to ask for information,
not a job. Networking, including
informational interviewing, is the
job seeker's equivalent of market
research. It is essential in learning
about fields and job functions, the
skills they require, jobs not publicly
advertised, ways to enter a specific
field, and inside information about a
particular organization's culture and
expectations. For tips on how to
conduct informational interviews,
go to: http://cardinalcareers.stan
ford.edu/networking/tips/.
Stanford Immersion in Medicine
Series (SIMS)
(http://cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/
shadow/premed/), is a unique, on

the physician's perspective. The goal
of the program is to not only expose
students to medicine, but also help
them develop a working relationship
with a local physician.
The Stanford Alumni Association
maintains the Stanford Career
Network (http://www.stanfordalum
ni.org/career/home.html), a database
of alumni, who have volunteered to
conduct informational interviews

with students and other alumni.
They are willing to discuss with stu
dents a variety of subjects including
job search strategies, industry/com
pany information, career options and
