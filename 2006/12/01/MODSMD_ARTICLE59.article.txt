# FACE AIDS
## At Stanford, a grassroots effort makes its mark

AIDS is the most disastrous health crisis
on the planet. Globally, more than 25 mil
lion people have died, and another early 40
million people are infected. Ten thousand
people are infected every single day. The
story goes even further than the tragic
deaths. As Jeffrey Sachs says in The End of
Poverty. "Africa is losing its teachers and
doctors, its civil servants, and farmers, its
mothers and fathers. There are already
more than 10 million orphaned children.
Business costs have soared, due to disarray
from massive medical costs for workers,
relentless absenteeism and an avalanche of
worker deaths. And millions of households
are battling with the illness of the head of
household and the incredible 101 l in time and
expense, to say nothing of emotional trauma
on the rest of the family."
Developing new treatments and finding
new ways to produce generic drugs will be a
central part of addressing the pandemic. We
cannot win the war on this disease without
new treatments. The biotech industry has a
major role to play in fighting AIDS.
However, we are also going to need new
doctors to treat patients with these drugs.
We need public health professionals to
design new prevention strategies. We need
investment bankers and other business peo
ple to donate to effective organizations. We
need good managers to lead nonprofits
fighting the pandemic. We need politicians
and voters to make this a national issue.
The FACE AIDS team is comprised of
people who want to do all of these things.
One Hum Bio major wants to work as a doc
tor in rural Africa. We have an Econ major
who want to be a policy analyst working in
Washington in DC. One volunteer is a
Medieval History major who aspires to be
an event planner for The Gates foundation.
Despite our varied plans for the future,
today we arc all working towards one com
mon goal, which we believe is the most
effective way we can currently contribute to
the fight against AIDS in Africa â€” building
a student movement.
In order to defeat this disease, we need a
broad base supporting this fight. As a soci
ety. we need to resolve that it is unaccept
able for millions of people to die every year
from a lack of treatment that costs less than
50 cents a day.and do something about it.
FACE AIDS is working to bring about this
change.
To do this, we create personal connec
tions between students and individuals

affected by AIDS. On college campuses
across America, we distribute beaded
awareness pins made bv cooperatives of
Congolese refugees and rural Zambians.
Not only does this put a human face on the
pandemic for US students, but it provides
life changing income for the pin makers in
Zambia. ;md raises money for expansion of
medical care in Rwanda through Partners in
Health, an extremely effective international
health nonprofit. It takes just $4 to prevent
transmission of HIV from a mother to a
child. $140 is enough to treat a patient with
antiretroviral therapy for an entire year. We
approach all of our efforts with one primary
goal: inspire students to take action.
There are many ways to contribute. Pick
your passion and go for it, whether it's advo
cacy. biotech, medicine, research, or any
other field. But first, make sure the rest of
our generation is alongside you in your com
mitment to making this world a more just
place.
FACE AIDS will have a formal recruit
ing process at the beginning of Winter
Quarter. Please look for emails to come at
the end of the quarter.
