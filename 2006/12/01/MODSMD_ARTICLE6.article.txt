# FOOTBALL COUNTDOWN
## Cal TB Marshawn Lynch vs. Stanford Linebackers 
### 
Stopping Cal's star
tailback is no easy task,
but the Cardinal are
going to have to limit
his production to have
any shot at upsetting
the Bears.
Lynch, who was
named the Pac-10 Of
fensive Player of the
Year last week, has
been a valuable
weapon both as a run
ner and as a receiver
out of the backfield. i
The Oakland native
has averaged 107.1
yards per game on the |
ground and has also
hauled in 30 receptions.

Meanwhile, Stanford has struggled mightily to stop the run throughout
the 2006 season. The Cardinal have the 117 th ranked rushing defense of
119 Division I-A teams and are allowing 218.1 yards per game on the
ground.
But Stanford's defense has steadily improved throughout the season.
1 reshman Clinton Snyder and senior Michael Okwo have each proved ca
pable of stopping the run. But if they falter at Memorial Stadium tomor
row. it could be a repeat of last year's Big Game when Lynch ran for 123
yards and a touchdown.
