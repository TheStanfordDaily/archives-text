# FACES ON THE FARM
## More than just the voice in Green Carr mans library post with Santa-like cheer 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Most students know R.T Carr as
the voice that brings a little cheer
into an otherwise dreary Dead
Week as he announces that the loan
desk is closed and that Green Li
brary has turned into a study hall.
"Please conduct yourselves ac
cordingly." he says every night at 10
p.m. on the dot. "It's okay to relax a
little â€” you can put your feet up."
Carr's enthusiasm and Santa
like appearance have made him a
bright spot during end-of-quarter
gloom and doom.
"His overall good attitude and
upbeat nature is really nice to have
around." said senior Jessica Satre.
"He is always a smiling face and
that's really nice during finals when
people are hardly looking at each
other."
Growing up at San Quentin
Prison, where his father was a
guard. Carr attended athletic events
at Stanford with his godfather, who
worked as an usher. He began
working at Green Librarv in 1984 as

a portal monitor. In addition to
scanning IDs. checking backpacks
and locating hooks, Carr actively
engaged the students in conversa
tion and became a distinct figure in
the Stanford community.
"There were a lot of things I wit
nessed during those years." Carr
said. "We once had 55 guys dressed
in Playboy outfits from some frat
initiation. Students are really capa
ble of doing anything, some of
which we don't want to discuss, but
we've really seen it all."
After working at the front desk
for nearly five years. Carr became a
library specialist and then moved to
Media and Reserves in Meyer Li
brary'. For the last five years. Carr
has held the late night shift at
Green.workingfrom4p.mto 1 a.m.
"The hours really work for me.
and it's an enjoyable time." Carr
said. "You talk to people all the
time. We have contact with every
one here, with people from all dif
ferent walks of life."
In addition to working in the li
brary. Carr is active in public serv
ice. For more than twenty years he
has served as an usher at graduation
and plays the role of Santa Claus for
the men's and women's basketball
teams, as well as the Salvation
Armv.

"I play folk music too. so they've
come to call me the Singing Santa."
said Carr. who can often be spotted
playing his guitar on the grass out
side the library in the afternoon. His
album "Christmas 2005." filled with
his favorite Christmas songs and his
readings of Dickens' "A Christmas
Carol." was sold in the Bookstore
several years ago.
Carr also served as a freshman
advisor for five years.giving the stu
dents treats and notes during finals
week.
"One of the people I used to ad
vise was an RA in a freshman
dorm," he said. "And one year he
sent the entire dorm over to shake
my hand and say hello. All of Bran
ner came over to Green to say hi to
me."
For fifteen years. Carr has been
making the PA announcements that
have become so renowned, and he
credits his theatre background with
much of their success.
"I learned in getting a drama BA
that that if you give it a littler differ
ent spin, people that are used to lis
tening to the same thing will start to
pay attention." Carr said.
After 15 years, the dozens of ears
that perk up every night at 10 p.m.
suggest he might be right.
