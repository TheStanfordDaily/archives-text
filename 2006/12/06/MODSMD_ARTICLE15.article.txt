## Law School students save citizen from deportation Immigrants' Rights Clinic works to assist victims in a broken system 
### EMMA TROTTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two students at the Law School's Immigrants' Rights
Clinic prevented the deportation of a 29-year-old Filipino
man for "minor criminal charges" last month. The law stu
dents' case was rock-solid — their client was actually a
U.S. citizen.
Francisco Ancheta. who has lived in the U.S. for over
20 years, was unknowingly naturalized by derivative citi
zenship, an obscure statute in immigration law that allows
a person who moves to the U.S. before turning 18 and
whose parents naturalized to become a citizen without
filing any papers.
' Most people in removal cases do not have lawyers, so
they represent themselves," said second year law student
Liz Morris, who helped represent Ancheta. "The differ
ence between the criminal system —where you have a
right to a lawyer — and the immigration system is that de

portation is not perceived to be a punishment, so you don't
have the right to a lawyer."
Morris' partner in the case said the case highlighted
problems in the justice system.
"I think a lot of people perceive the immigration sys
tem to he broken, and maybe this is a sign of that." said
third-year law student Hilary Ley. who also represented
Ancheta.
Navigating the complexities of immigration law without
expert legal guidance is difficult for many non-citizens fac
ing deportation, they said. Many immigrants face a language
barrier, and even more are unaware of loopholes and fine
print that could aid their case. Immigrants are sometimes
detained in holding facilities, complicating their efforts to
gather necessary documentation for the case.
The government does not systematically screen for ex
ceptions like Ancheta's, Ley and Morris noted. Without
pro bono counsel from groups like Stanford's Immigrants'
Rights Clinic (IRC), the pair said these immigrants'
prospects of remaining in America are usually bleak.
Ancheta stated that his deportation would have been
very difficult for his family to manage.
"I have my wife and my son here." he said. "I am the
only one that works and supports my family, and it would
be hard for them to support themselves. My son is too

small."
As far as the students had heard, this was the first case
in which the IRC had discovered that an immigrant facing
deportation was actually a citizen.
Owing to this fact, the judge's final decision was not dis
cretionary. Once Ley and Morris proved certain key as
pects of the case, the judge had no other option hut to allow
Ancheta to remain in the country.
In addition to assisting immigrants. Morris said the IRC
offers law students valuable practice in all aspects of cases,
including interviewing clients and witnesses, writing plead
ings. investigating facts, conducting research, and present
ing cases.
Organizations similar to the IRC. which is in its third
year of existence, also exist at other law schools like UC-
Davis and NYU.
Despite the experience. Ancheta said he feels that the
U.S. immigration system is functional.
"A lot of people are doing bad things within the system,
hut overall the system is good." he said.
"Part of the problem is the way money is allocated with
in the system." Morris agreed. "Money is spent on fences
and deporting minor criminals like Ancheta, not on
lawyers and research before placing people in deportation
proceedings.
