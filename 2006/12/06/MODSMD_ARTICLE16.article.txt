## Ten profs win AAAS fellowships for science research American Association for the Advancement of Science rewards work 
### LIA HARDIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The laundry list of prestigious awards given to Stanford
faculty grew yet again last month when the American Asso
ciation for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) elected 10
professors from the 112 arm to its list of 2(X)6 AAAS Fellows.
AAAS Fellows represent a diverse assortment of fields,
including anthropology and the social, economic and politi
cal sciences, in addition to the more traditionally scientific
fields of the biological sciences and engineering. The 2(XJ6
Fellows were first announced in the Nov. 24 issue of Science,
an academic journal published by AAAS.
Fellows are nominated by their peers and elected by the
AAAS Council to be formally "recognized for their contri
butions to science and technology," according to the AAAS
Web site. Many Stanford honorees, however, said they

doubted the award would affect their professional work or
ability to nail down research funding.
"In fact, one just continues to struggle to find the fund
ing," said Medical School Prof. William Mobley. "This is a
nice honor but I can't imagine it will have a big impact on
that."
Mobley's research in neuroscience fexuses on the signal
ing of neurotrophic factors — mechanisms in the brain that
keep neurons healthy and functional. He compares normal
brains to those afflicted by diseases of the nervous system
like Alzheimer's and Down's Syndrome.
Shauna Somerville.a research assistant with the Carnegie
Institute in Washington and associate professor, by courtesy,
in the department of biological sciences, also stressed the im
portant role funding plays.
"You're only as good as the last grant proposal you've
written," she said.
Somerville has completed pioneering work on the host
pathogen interactions of the weedy plant Arabidupsis and
one of its diseases, a powdery mildew. Her research has
helped to clarify the vocabulary that scientists need to prop
erly describe the interface between complex organisms and

disease invaders.
Martin Perl, an emeritus professor at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC). was honored for his research in
elementary particle physics. Perl disagreed with Somerville.
arguing that the wins by he and another SLAC recipient.
Prof. Keith I lodgson, will help the center when it applies for
money from the U.S. Department of Energy.
Perl added, however, that his funding probably would not
increase, in part because he has already won a Nobel Prize
for his 1975 discovery of theTau particle, a very heavy rela
tive of the electron.
Other award recipients were Psychology Prof. Jeffrey
Wine. Chemical Engineering Prof. Chaitan Khosla.Law Prof.
Henry Greely, Prof, of Applied Physics and Biological Sci
ences Steven Block. Prof, of Pathology and of Genetics Joseph
I .ipsick and Experimental Pathology Prof.Tercsa Wang.
Despite some uncertainty about the award's benefits,
most Eellows said they were happy to receive recognition for
years of hard work.
"I'm an experimenter, and sometimes research is hard —
sometimes you get discouraged." Perl said. "It is a great pleas
ure to Ik- named an AAAS Fellow. I really appreciate it.
