## Dem chair backs reform in eduction 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
The incoming Democratic chair of the
House Committee on Education and the Work
Force told an education summit in Encina Hall
Friday that Democrats will push for the reau
thorization of the No Child Left Behind educa
tion reform law while angling to increase
teacher quality standards.
"Hopefully we have the values to do it right
and continue on this journey," said Rep.
George Miller (D-CA), who said that not reau
thorizing the controversial bill would set hack
efforts to improve educational opportunities
for the poor and minority populations.
Miller, who represents the San Francisco
East Bay, said reauthorization will hinge on
putting quality teachers in the classroom. He
said Democrats would take a stand to ensure
standards were put in place to limit the employ
ment of so-called "emergency" teachers.
"When that child walks through the front
door of that school, they are entitled to a
teacher who has the skills," he said. "It should
not be a game of Russian Roulette for who you
get in your classroom. It's simply not fair to the
kids."
He said that California had 60,000 emer
gency teachers when President Bush signed the
No Child Left Behind Act into law.
But Miller indicated he would not be be
holden to the special interest teaching lobby
when he said he could support performance
pay and signing bonuses for new teachers.
Groups like the American Federation of
Teachers and the National Education Associa
tion, the two largest teacher's union, have tradi
tionally opposed measures designed to hold
teachers accountable for how they teach.
Miller said that young people today under
stand and respond to economic incentives. He
suggested that teacher unions have not been
listening to younger members.
"They've got one or more feet stuck in the
past." he said.
The congressman, considered a close ally
and friend of presumptive Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). said he had
changed his mind on so-called "growth model
ing." a performance assessment that looks at
how much students improved year-over-year
instead of comparing students to a benchmark
of where they should be at their grade level.
"I think I was wrong with them." he said.
"When we talk about growth models, it's going
to have to be growth through proficiency."
Miller, 61. has been the highest ranking De
mocrat on the education committee since 2001.
He commended current Secretary of Educa
tion Margaret Spellings for her work on imple
menting the education reform law. saying she
was more flexible than her predecessor Rod
Paige.
Education Prof. Kenji Hakuta said that he
was not surprised that Democratic leadership
— Miller and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA)
had decided to endorse reauthorization of the
bill.
"I think he anticipated the challenges that
the reauthorization is going to face but also saw
the opportunity to learn from the past five
years of implementing the bill," he said.
rhe long-held Democratic polling advan
tage on education issues over Republican rivals
was largely neutralized by President Bush in
the past four elections. Democrats hope to cap
italize on their newfound majorities in the Con
gress to regain the trust of the American peo
ple. analysts say, to convince voters that they
are not in the pockets of teacher's unions and
have a plan to improve education performance.
Miller's speech came at the end of an almost
10-hour long policy summit on education spon
sored by the Stanford Institute for Economic
Policy Research,a non-partisan think tank ded
icated to studying economic policy.
A few hundred participants listened in the
Bechtel Conference Center as panelists and
politicians — including State Superintendent
of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell —
stressed how critical education is as an input in
the economy.
