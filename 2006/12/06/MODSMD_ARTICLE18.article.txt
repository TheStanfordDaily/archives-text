## Editorial Board Defending the collegiate press 
### 
One week ago, an administrator at the
University of Southern California
(USC) blocked the re-election of
Zach Fox to the post of editor in chief of the
Daily Trojan, the campus' student daily
newspaper. As college journalists, we are
deeply troubled by this decision. Practicing
journalism with strings attached isn't really
practicing journalism at all, and to that end.
we seek to preserve the tradition of a func
tionally — and whenever possible, formally
— independent collegiate press. If campus
newspapers are to succeed in informing
readers and training reporters, they must be
more than public relations arms of universi
ties. and they cannot operate under the
yoke of administrators' censorship.
Fox was re-elected by the staff of the
Daily Trojan behind a vision which called
for more financial transparency and a reor
ganization of the paper's senior editor posi
tions. Yet. his election required the approval
of USC's Media Board, a body of.students,
faculty members and administrators that
oversees the school's student-run media op
erations. USC Vice President of Student Af
fairs Michael L. Jackson, a member of this
board, decided not even to present Fox to
the board, describing Fox's vision as irrec
oncilable with the Media Board's outline
for the role. Fox. who had been serving as
the editor this fall, resigned from his post in
protest of the decision and threw his sup
port behind the Daily Trojan's editorial di
rector, Jeremy Beecher, who handily won a
subsequent vote on Friday and was ap
proved by the Media Board Monday.
Earlier this semester. Fox repeatedly ap
proached the board requesting information
about the budget and finances of the paper.
Given that access to financial information is
a standard operating procedure for nearly
all of our nation's college papers — inde
pendent or not — this move denies USC's
student journalists a holistic view of an in
dustry that is facing major changes. Al
though the administration has commis
sioned a task force to investigate Fox's pro
posals, its r.eticence toward financial trans
parency creates an appearance of impropri

ety and leaves open questions as to whether
Fox was denied his post in retaliation for his
probing questions.
Although the Daily Trojan is not totally
fiscally independent, its daily production
has historically been student-run. Regard
less of the formal level of independence of
the paper, a meddling administration un
dermines the educational value of student
journalism. Interventions like this assault
the core values of student newspapers —
objectivity and comprehensive coverage.
They compromise journalistic integrity and
tarnish the development of the next gener
ation of journalists.
Our society relies on its newspapers to
check powerful individuals and institutions.
An administration-controlled student
paper poses the same threat to an academic
community that a state-controlled press
would to a nation; oversight limits the press'
ability to act as a watchdog and prevent mis
use of authority. The USC administration's
interference with the student press creates a
chilling effect, forcing student journalists to
weigh the risk of losing their jobs against
the duty of writing a story about or ques
tioning the administration. Such considera
tions hamper a paper's ability to do its job.
If USC intends to imbue any journalistic
values in its students, it must allow its stu
dents to be journalists without fear of ad
ministrative reproach.
USC's action diminishes the role of stu
dent journalists across the nation by demon
strating a lack of trust in students to decide
the structure and daily operation of their
paper. Hut more importantly, it violates the
fundamental value of the press.The universi
ty administration does a disservice to the
whole of the USC community, not just the
Daily Trojan editors whose decisions they
rendered inconsequential. The integrity of
the collegiate press is important to the

question and investigate and learn from the
world around them. Those are values that
