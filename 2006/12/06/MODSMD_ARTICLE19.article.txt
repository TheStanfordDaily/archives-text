# The 						deferred life plan

The sun is shining, the brown leaves
have finally made their way down to
the abundant green grass and the palm
trees on Palm Drive are as gorgeous as ever.
Obviously, it's time for winter break. Just a
few minor exams and papers and you'll be
well on your way to three weeks of hard
earned, work-free bliss.
Call me psychic,but I'm willing to bet that
I can predict what most of you will be doing
over the holidays: namely,everything you've
wanted to do for the past 10 weeks but
haven't. That would be sleep: spend time
with friends and family; catch up on current
events, Hollywood movies and missed tele
vision shows; answer personal email (or not)
and, oh yeah, breathe.
Here at Stanford, we have a tendency to
let the latter fall by the wayside in favor of
the more important things — things like
schoolwork, extracurricular activities and
homework, with a few applications and stan
dardized tests thrown in for good measure.
This phenomenon does not just thrive at
Stanford, of course. It occurs in virtually any
institutional microcosm of twentvsome

things you can imagine (I larvard. Berkeley,
McKinsey, Goldman, Google). The De
ferred Life Plan exists the world over.
Back in the day.the DLP started around
September of senior year of high-school,
when people put off pajama parties and un
accredited extracurriculars in order to fill
out those pesky forms known as college ap
plications. "I'll relax in January." we figured.
"Once these are out of my hands."
Today, the D 1 P begins even earlier, with
high-school freshmen forgoing frivolous ac
tivities like float building and movie nights
in order to take SAI prep classes and per-

But the dangerous part of the
DLP is that, once you sign up, it's in
credibly hard to unregister. There is
always another hurdle to prepare for.
another unknown looming on the
horizon. If you won't attend Frosh
Formal until you've figured out your
major, won't go to Pub Night until
you've finished the next chapter of
your thesis and won't date until
you've found a job for the next sum
mer/year/decade, you're going to be
waiting a long time for Real Life to
start.
Lest you operate under the illu
sion of future security, let me share a
conversation overheard yesterday at
the Graduate School of Business cafe
(which, for the record, has the most
attractive ... food ...on campus).

"1 know it's only December," a girl
said, "hut I'm worried about what's
going to happen when I go back to
my company in June. Once 1 get on
that treadmill, it's impossible to get
off."
"1 know exactly what you mean,"
said her friend. "One of our top New
York executives, who works from five
a.m. to nine p.m. and has made 30 or
40 million dollars, told me that he al
ways planned to go in to non-profit
work after he made his first 10 — but
now he can't stop. 1 lis family is used
to the lifestyle."
Although I didn't interrupt to ask,
I would imagine said lifestyle in
volves a gorgeous brownstone on the
Upper East Side, a horde of hired
help and annual trips to Aspen, the
Bahamas and the 1 lamptons (during
the appropriate seasons, of course). 1
would also imagine that he brings his
laptop on the plane, his Blackberry
on the chairlift and his stress every
where.
Finances aside, perhaps the most
amazing piece of this story is that this
millionaire has a family. His Y chro

mosome may have freed him from
the inconvenient, time-consuming
experience known as pregnancy, but
when did he find the time to meet his
wife? Match.com, eHarmony and
their juvenile version, Facebook, may
have made it easier to locate poten
tial partners, but, aside from mail
order brides, there is no way to re
place the intricate, tiresome process
of dating.
As a hardworking, high-aiming
overachiever myself, I write this all
with the utmost sympathy. Indeed,
until 1 ran head-long in to the most
overwhelming 10 months of my life, I,
too, was a firm (if subconscious) sub
scriber to the DLP.
When 1 started teaching ninth
grade last August, 1 wanted to do the
best job possible. Realizing that my
time and energy were limited, I fig
ured personal emails and phone
calls could wait for the weekend.
But the coming months taught me a
handful of painful lessons in time
and energy-conservation. By the
end of September, 1 learned not to
go out on weeknights. By the end of

October, Fridays were out. too. Sat
urdays and then even Sundays be
came time to sleep, run, read and
generally recover from the past
week — in order to wake up and do
it all over again.
But one Sunday in February, as I
packed my bag for the next day and
felt the tension headache coming on.
I realized that 1 was miserable. Yes, I
was teaching five amazing classes
and had won over a hundred
teenagers, but the exhaustion and
subsequent social isolation were
hardly worth it. No matter how cool
they are, your coworkers will never
replace your friends and your mag
nificent final product will never love
you back.
Ihis year, with plenty of time to
maintain friendships and even make
a few new ones (as well as go on a few
dates). I can see the DLP from the
other side. The last guy 1 dated was a
hardworking, former consultant at
Bain (for those of you not yet initiat
ed into Cardinal Recruiting, Bain
might be considered the Stanford
equivalent to McKinsey's I larvard

mentality — either way, you're woik
ing SO hours a week). Mr. Bain liked
to call when he was in transit — from
dinner to the gym. between one party
and the next, en route to lunch with
his co-workers, etcetera. The rela
tionship ended when he called to see
whether I would be his backup date
to a concert in case his friend bailed
on him — he needed to maximize his
limited social time.
To paraphrase John the
tricky thing about Real Life is that it
happens while you're making other
plans, and. to paraphrase myself,
most people won't wait. So. when an
nual resolution time arrives in a few
weeks, consider just what — and
who — you're putting on the back
burner right now. 1 guarantee that, if
and when you chose to return to it.
the work will still be there. Who
knows — it might even look a little
less important.
