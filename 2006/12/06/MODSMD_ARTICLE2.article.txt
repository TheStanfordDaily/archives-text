# CAMPUS ACTIVISM
## Chalking up the dead Students remember Iraq war dead with 900 body outlines around campus 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
More than 30 students began working to draw chalk
outlines of human bodies around campus shortly after
midnight today to raise awareness of the civilian and mili
tary deaths in Iraq, with organizers expecting to draw 900
bodies.
A tightknit, informal group of student activists calling
themselves "projectAliveTo" has been planning the
protest since September. They asked to remain anony
mous. saying that they want the focus to remain more on
the message than the messenger.
"People see it in the newspaper and hear it on the news,
but they don't internalize it," said one organizer, a sopho
more. "These are real people who are dying in this war.'
The group's goal is to highlight the human cost of the
occupation, which has grown since sectarian violence

flared up earlier this year.
"When these bodies are on the ground, each one really
represents someone who has died," she said. "A soldier, a
civilian, a son, a daughter, a mother, a father.
It is difficult to make even a rough estimate of how
many people have died in Iraq since the American inva
sion in March 2003.1"he New York Times reported Monday
that the civilian death toll is at least 50,000.
"We want to push this issue into people's faces," anoth
er group leader said. "Stanford students aren't going to be
able to miss this. When they're biking or walking to class,
it's going to be there."
Students deployed themselves into three areas. One
part of the group focused on the area between Meyer and
Green libraries. Another concentrated on the area around
the Language Corner, also known as the Intersection of

Death. And the third concentration
of bodies is in White Plaza, extending
from the ( law to the Post Office.
"We were trying to get major in
tersections with traffic,"said the stu
dent coordinating the logistics for
projectAliveTo. "We kind of wanted
to keep them rather close together."
Organizers said they hoped a
highei concentration is more effec
tive at showing the magnitude of the
human death toll.
"People don't want to step on
graves," he said. "It has a spatial im
pediment factor."
Ibe students do not want the
chalk outlines to become a partisan
political statement. They say this is
not a standard, catch-all anti-Iraq
war protest; it is more human than
lhat. Planners said they do not have
specific policy objectives they are
trying to push. Instead, the\ say, the
sole goal is to create a more globally
iware student body.
"This is a completely non-politi
;a 11 hing," on e organ i zer sa id. "We 're
saying ' These people died. We're
lpset about it, and this is how we
:hoose to celebrate their lives and
support their families.'"

Working through various campus
groups and loosely connected social
networks, a handful of organizers
discreetly recruited the volunteers
over the past few days. Around 30
students were out drawing the out
lines with stencils early this morning.
Today's protest harkens back to
the campus activism of the late
l%os, when student protests rose to
i fever pitch at Stanford. More re
cently, the last large protest at the
University was President Hush's
campus visit last April.
"What's missing?" asked PWR
I .ecturer Scott 1 lerndon. who teach
es a course on protest movements.
"Why don't students come to
protests? Maybe this generation has
decided that there's no solution and,
as a result, the best we can do is ig
nore the fact this is happening."
I lerndon has advised "projectAl
iveTo" organizers and said he hopes
that the chalk outlines translate the
human costs of the war in a way stu
dents can relate to.
"I think the hope is that artistry
can survive the impasse of partisan
protest." he said. "The hope is that it
will strike someone between the ribs.
It's not a rhetorical, propaganda
based protest. It's an affect based
protest that plays on what we're in
terested in to generate a pre-political
feeling."
One student who volunteered to

help said she was really excited and
felt the energy of the group's organ
izers.
"I think it's going to be neat to
meet people who share similar
views. When you experience this
other worldly embodiment of Iraqi
civilians, you make a connection,"
she said. "It's cool how they're link
ing up all these different dynamics to
establish bonds between people
through this very symbolic,emotion
al act."
Hie project was inspired by the
' iffiti art of Richard Hambleton,
who painted white outlines of bodies
tround urban centers in 15 cities be
• ween 1976and 1978 and then spilled
red paint inside. Hambleton hoped
to intensify fear in the population
and to force them to think about vio
lence in the streets.
Students drawing the chalk said
they hoped to make students some
what uncomfortable, to force them
out of their comfort zones.
()rganizers plan to place a copy of
their manifesto on post office boxes
at the Stanford Post Office.
"We are all of one kind — we
must be alive to feel compassion for
our own brothers and sisters," the
document says. "Iraqi civilian vic
tims of the Iraq War, we celebrate
your lives today, and we vow to be
aware."
