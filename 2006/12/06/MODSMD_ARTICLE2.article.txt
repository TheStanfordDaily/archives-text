More than 30 students began working to draw chalk
outlines of human bodies around campus shortly after
midnight today to raise awareness of the civilian and mili

able to miss this. When they're biking or walking to class,
it's going to be there."
Students deployed themselves into three areas. One
part of the group focused on the area between Meyer and
Green libraries. Another concentrated on the area around
the Language Corner, also known as the Intersection of
