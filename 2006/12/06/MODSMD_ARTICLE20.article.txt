# What is Ani DiFranco doing to our nativity scene?

### 
Everyone gather around the non-de
nominational holiday furniture item
of your choice so that we can discuss
something. America. I'm not sure you real
ize this, but you take the holidays too seri
ously. You're raving lunatics around the hol
idays. alternating between hugging every
thing in sight and sobbinglv throwing shoes
at people. The holidays in America are
about as picturesque as a kitten in a mi
crowave. You all should be on some kind of
green and red holiday edition Valium.
In this bipolar bonanza of a holiday sea
son, there are two sides that tear apart the
American psyche like a taffy pull of pain. In
one corner, we have people who give the
politically correct a bad name. Ihey have
the ACLIJ on speed dial. These are people
who get offended by nativity displays on pri
vate lawns. They are offended — and this
actually happened in Chicago — that a
Christmas festival is sponsored by a Christ
mas movie. Jimmy Stewart, you have my
permission to jump.
In the other corner we have the culture
warriors who view saying "Happy H'oli

clays" us a direct attack on our institutional
values. Suggesting there are other holidays
in this season is like making baby Jesus cry
or rooting against the Cowboys. These peo
ple think that there is a war going on where
secularists are trying to effectively put an
end to Christmas. In some secluded bunker
in San Francisco, atheists come together and
plot ways to destroy Christmas. Frank
Zappa presides over the panel while Andy
Rooney, Marilyn Manson and Ani DiFran
co each take turns discussing how to take
