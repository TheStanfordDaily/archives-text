# What is Ani DiFranco doing to our nativity scene?

Everyone gather around the non-de
nominational holiday furniture item
of your choice so that we can discuss
something. America. I'm not sure you real
ize this, but you take the holidays too seri
ously. You're raving lunatics around the hol
idays. alternating between hugging every
thing in sight and sobbinglv throwing shoes
at people. The holidays in America are
about as picturesque as a kitten in a mi
crowave. You all should be on some kind of
green and red holiday edition Valium.
In this bipolar bonanza of a holiday sea
son, there are two sides that tear apart the
American psyche like a taffy pull of pain. In
one corner, we have people who give the
politically correct a bad name. Ihey have
the ACLIJ on speed dial. These are people
who get offended by nativity displays on pri
vate lawns. They are offended — and this
actually happened in Chicago — that a
Christmas festival is sponsored by a Christ
mas movie. Jimmy Stewart, you have my
permission to jump.
In the other corner we have the culture
warriors who view saying "Happy H'oli

clays" us a direct attack on our institutional
values. Suggesting there are other holidays
in this season is like making baby Jesus cry
or rooting against the Cowboys. These peo
ple think that there is a war going on where
secularists are trying to effectively put an
end to Christmas. In some secluded bunker
in San Francisco, atheists come together and
plot ways to destroy Christmas. Frank
Zappa presides over the panel while Andy
Rooney, Marilyn Manson and Ani DiFran
co each take turns discussing how to take


Holt

Holt's Harangue
Christ out of Christmas and convert
churches into sex shops and Whole
Food stores. In addition to making
retail stores say "Happy Holidays,
this panel of evil is going to person
ally visit nativity scenes and make it
look like one of the wise men is
humping Joseph. They are going to
use their Hollywood influence to
deny funding to holiday gems like
"The Nativity Story" and replace
them with films by Tim Allen. r lim
Allen! Is nothing sacred?
But Bill O'Reilly wants to save
Christmas from the consumerist sec
ularists. He is calling for boycotts of
stores that say "Happy Holidays"
and huffing and puffing and hoping
that he'll blow someone's house
down before all that hot air inside
him explodes and you get icky Bill
O'Reilly guts all over that nice clean
Fox News set. So please, kids, buy his
book "How Bill O'Reilly Saved
Christmas" from his Web site or else
Jesus won't come down your chim
ney and give you that My Little Pony
you wanted.
The culture warriors want you to
remember the reason for the season,
which to them is to celebrate the
birth of the Messiah. Of course, they
ignore how Christianity overlaid its
holiday on a pre-existing pre-Christ
ian tradition that is similar in many
different parts of the world. TTiis
"winter solstice" may well be the
"true reason for the season." I'd love
to see people try to take back winter
for the solstice and instead of carol
ing, going door to door and singing
songs about converting people to pa

ganism. Maybe change the words of
some Christmas carols: "Joy to the
Druids" and"The Sun God is Com
ing to Town." Light the holiday straw
goat on fire and you've got yourself
an effective way to offend pretty
much everyone. My point is: Culture
warriors like to overlook the fact
that other people have holidays
around this time and that maybe,just
maybe, businesses are hedging their
bets by saying "Happy Holidays."
America, there is a reason that
suicide rates rise around the holi
days. I'm worried about you. Put
down the shiv-shaped candy cane
and listen. Look, after I hear "I'll he
home for Christmas" or some equal
ly cheery song I feel like pouring
eggnog on my body, running to the
chimney and igniting myself in a joy
ous human yule-log. We all get those
urges! But don't kill yourself be
cause a retail store doesn't greet you
in the way you want. At this point,
you're lucky to be greeted at all.The
anger and discontent in this country
has spilt over into a season that is
supposed to promote good will to
ward man (but sadly not between a
man and man). Instead it's become
just another culture clash of values.
Instead of bringing people together
in our shared loved of materialistic
emotional investment, the season
becomes an arms race of toys, vitri
olic fighting over video game sys
tems, subpoenas as stocking stuffers
and idiots calling for religious dog
matism as a universal solution for a
personal holiday. I wonder if the pa
gans had these kinds of problems
back in the day.

Chris's editor wants him to wish you
all a happy holiday. Send complaints
