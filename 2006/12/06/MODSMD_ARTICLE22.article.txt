# Mistletoe and wine

### 
I was going to write a column about my Big
Game weekend. It started with a trip to
see Gaieties (sadly, not as funny as last
year).
Ilicn I went drinking in Berkeley with a
friend and a couple of "Cal Sucks' T-shirts —
one of which ended being draped over the
"Footballs Players" statue by my illustrious
friend (an experience that simultaneously
made me feel both young and a little tragic).
And. of course, the adventure ended with
the Big Game itself — which, for once, was
actually the highlight of the weekend.
As you can see this doesn't really fill up
enough space, so I'm going to have to ramble
on about something else instead.
(Brief Gaieties aside first, though. Was
surprised to see such enthusiastic involve
ment from the Deans — it seems a little in
appropriate that authority figures would ap
pear in a production that fetishes underage
drinking, sexual conduct bordering on as
sault and combinations of the two. Still. I sup
pose it's a good way to stay "in" with the
kids.)
There are many things I like about Christ
mas. Hie warm feelings it fills me with. The

pleasures of seeing little children flush with
joy as they contemplate the Miracle of Little
Baby Jesus.That sort of thing.
However, 1 am conflicted.
Part of a successful graduate student life is
maintaining a deep-seated hatred of happi
ness. We feed off misery, off sadness and off
the bitter taste of imminent failure. So, it is a
yearly surprise to me that find out that 1 love
Christmas.
It's my favorite time of year. 1 like the
bright lights and the fake snowmen and the
( hristmas trees. I love the endless shopping.
I adore the slightly out-of-tune carol singing.
People try at Christmas. They pull them
selves together and try to have fun.There are
drunken parties with embarrassing stories

and sexual assault.There are overpriced, un
wanted presents. And, most important of all.
there is food. Lots of cholesterol-rich, artery
clogging food.
Unfortunately my boundless glee is not
without price. It is tempered with a tinge of
regret.
Bitterness has its price, hut it also has its
pride. Maintaining cynicism about, well,
everything and a healthy contempt for those
around you is a very pleasurable way to face'
the world.
If you can sneer at everything around you.
it's easy to feel superior. And feeling superi
or is all some of us need to do to stay sane.
Which makes the realisation that one ac
tually likes stuff strangely painful. It is hard
to resist the urge to dismiss feelings of fond
ness as unnecessary sentiment.
Hmmm. Maybe I'm not saying this right.
Dislike is cool. Derision is trendy. And falling
in with the crowd is a little like giving up.
Parents like Christmas. Small children
like Christmas. Your elementary school
teacher likes Christmas. Liking Christmas is

like liking the novels of John Gr
isham: It is an affectation of the cul
turally illiterate, of the tasteless and
of the hoi polloi.
And yet... 1 can't stop myself.
Christmas (contrary to popular ac
counts of increased suicide rates) is
the greatest time of the year and it

makes me and everyone else
happy.
Ah well. I guess this the way the
descent into mediocrity begins. One
chunk of joy at a time. Still, at least I
can still despise New Year's Eve...
Merry Christmas.

For those of you wondering about nix
