# A 						merry little Christmas
## 
### 
I don't know it you've heard about it, but
there's this little thing coming up called
"Christmas." And jusf a head's up — it's
going to be awesome.
1 know, I know. It's a cliche. It's too commer
cial. You've grown to loathe most Christmas
songs. You're "Jewish."
None of that means that you can't love
('hristmas. I m decidedly irreligious,so my rela
tionship with Christmas is purely cultural, and
mostly based on a strong attachment to ginger
bread cookies, Christmas trees and twinkly
lights. Nothing against Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or
Winter Solstice celebrations — it there's deli
cious food, smells and loud off-key singing in
volved. I'm all for it. December is just crying out
for some kind of large cheerful holiday — a
reason to get a break from school, to curl up
warm and snug near a fire and ignore the fore
boding darkness outside.
I've attempted to transplant this Christmas
spirit to Stanford, with mixed results. Last year,
a friend and I decided to drink eggnog and

watch "Elf," but, as it turned out. Bacardi and
organic eggnog from Whole Foods don't mix
very well together. (In a word: viscous.) So we
moved on to other forms of Christmas cheer,
like margaritas.and another friend decided that
one in the morning was the best possible time
to play a rousing rendition of "I leart and Soul"
on the piano in the SLE lounge.
Did I mention it was a Wednesday night in
the middle of finals?
Anyway my point is that the Christmas spir
it can sometimes be taken a little too far. (Like
when you wake up the next morning, look at

your arm. and wonder to yourself,'is that a bite
mark'!") But here are a few tips for engaging in
some wholesome amounts of Christmas cheer:
Memorize silly Christmas Songs
"I saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,""Win
ter Wonderland,""Let It Snow,""Santa Baby."
Learn them, love them, belt them out to your
sleeping roommates when you come back from
Green at one in the morning. (All's fair in love,
war and Christmas.) Can you get any better
than a song in which Eartha Kitt tries to seduce
Santa Claus like Marilyn Monroe singing
"I hippy Birthday" to JFK? Give LennonV'So
Iliis is Christmas" a spin if you're in a thought
tul mood (Seriously, so this is Christmas, what
have you done?) And if your roommate hasn't
threatened to delete Savage Garden's "Last
( hristmas from your hard drive, you haven't
been playing it enough.

Put up Christinas lights
Nothing brightens up a dorm room
like Christmas lights duct-taped to the
wall. Unless you're from the 1 lousing
Department,in which case I mean that
"nothing brightens up a dorm room
like leaving it in the exact same condi
tion you found it in, and never allow
ing anything other than finest silk to
touch the walls."
Hake Christmas cookies in your
kitchenette
Make them from scratch or just
bake some store-bought dough —
your fellow housemates will love you,
the cookies will smell delicious and
maybe you'll undo some of the dam
age from the unfortunate "Heart and
Soul" incident.
Put up a photo of Santa Claus on
your door.
Pretty self-explanatory — who
doesn't love Santa Claus?

(iive yourself a break on the presents
and spread some international
goodwill
Instead of waiting in traffic for
hours and becoming increasingly irri
tated with the bumper stickers of the
SUV in front of you, consider getting
your friend a llama from the Heifer
Organization (it will, incidentally, ac
tually be delivered to a poor family in
a developing country, but still — a
llama!) or order a recycled gum wrap
per purse online. It'll be less stressful,
you'll do some good and you can tell
your friend, "Oh, you got me a CD? I
supported a family in a developing
country who doesn t normally gel any
thing for Christmas. But, you know,
yours is good too." (Making your
friend feel bad is. of course, just an op
tional accessory.)
But however you choose to cele
brate the season, in John Lennon's im
mortal words,"l hope you have fun."
And also, that you won't try mixing
Bacardi and eggnog.

Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, etc. wishes at
Sinim@stanford.edu, as well as party in
vitations and Hani as.

your friend, "Oh, you got me a CD? I
supported a family in a developing
country who doesn t normally gel any
thing for Christmas. But, you know,
yours is good too." (Making your
friend feel bad is. of course, just an op
tional accessory.)
But however you choose to cele
brate the season, in John Lennon's im
mortal words,"l hope you have fun."
And also, that you won't try mixing
Bacardi and eggnog.

Sim is happy to accept Christmas,
Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, etc. wishes at
Sinim@stanford.edu, as well as party in
vitations and Hani as.
