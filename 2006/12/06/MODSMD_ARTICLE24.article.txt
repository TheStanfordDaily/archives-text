Undergraduate housing during win
ter break
We are writing in response to the Nov. 30
editorial entitled "This winter,give students a
break." While the closing paragraphs of the
editorial acknowledge efforts being made to
assist international undergraduates who
need housing over winter break, we believe
that the balance of the editorial gives a mis
leading and undeservedly critical assessment
of the University's concern for and response
to the needs of international students.

The ASSU,Student 1 lousing, the Office of
the Associate Vice Provost for Residential
and Dining Enterprises (R&DE) and other
University offices have been working collab
oratively for a number of months to identify
the needs of international undergraduates
during winter break, including surveying in
ternational freshmen.
A small number of international under
graduates remain at Stanford over winter
break. During past years, these students have
usually stayed at Hammarskjold. Chi Theta
Chi or with friends in graduate residences.

Most have stayed at Stanford for only a few
days,spending the majority of the break trav
eling or visiting friends or relatives. A very
small number remain at Stanford for the en
tire winter break.
Io better assist those students who do re
main at Stanford, two new housing options
will be offered.
First, Student Housing will assign interest
ed international undergraduates to vacant
student rooms in the Crothers Halls for win-
ter break. Information regarding this
option has been emailed to interna
tional undergraduates and is avail
able on the Student Housing Web
site at http://studenthousing.stan
ford.edu.
Second, the Stanford Alumni As
sociation has asked local alumni to
host international undergraduates
for all or part of winter break. The
ASSU will maintain a list of those
alumni who volunteer to do so.
We are disappointed that The
Daily made no contact with Student
Housing or anyone else in R&D I: to
learn of these new options and other
ongoing efforts before writing its ed
itorial. Unfortunately, the editorial
perpetuated much of the same mis
information that was in a Nov. 14 ar
ticle on this subject and in which
comments were attributed to Shirley
Everett, the Associate Vice Provost
for Residential and Dining Enter
prises, that she never made.This is es
pecially troubling because Shirley

Everett has helped champion the ef
forts being made to improve winter
break services for international stu
dents.
We believe that the partnership
of the ASSU with Student Housing,
R&DE and other University offices
has resulted in responsive efforts
that will greatly benefit international
undergraduates who need to remain
at Stanford during the winter interim
period.

Believe in the team
Loyal Sons and Daughters of the
Stanford Red,
I am the guy who made the "We
Believe" banner and the"I Believe"
T-shirts. I still believe in Stanford

Football. We may not have brought
the Axe back this year, but 1 am si ill
proud to call the team my team.
Against all odds those guys put up a
serious fight to the last minute of the
game.
Something happened there Sat
urday, on the field and in the
stands.that was very special. People
just started giving a damn, and that is
what it is all about. The boys on the
field buried any expectations and
played an amazing game. The stu
dents in the stands cheered, not for a
some nationally marketed champi
onship team, but for our team, our
school and our friends.
I believe in Stanford Football be
cause it's my team and I know you do
too.
When we win next year, it will be
all the more sweet because of the
times we remained loyal when things
were not so great.
