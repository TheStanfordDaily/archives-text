Say what you will about the Moscow
Metro system (dirty, reeking sponge
glistening with other people's sweat —
there's a starter), sometimes it's got excel
lent in-ride entertainment. At least three
times a week 1 see disoriented drunk people
unwittingly sleeping through city tours;
women shove their children aside to get
prime seats; hot Russian indie guys slouch
intellectually and page through cheap de
tective novels. And last night, some Ameri
can chick belted out the classic Divinyls
song "I Touch Myself" while her friends
awkwardly looked around the car.
Oh god, wait. That was me.
To put it gently, my voice is not exactly
mellifluous. To be more specific, imagine
Ashlee Simpson and Paris Hilton singing a
duet. All of the scratchy, yowling, discordant
tracks that have to be edited out to make
the whole mess barely audibly acceptable?
That's roughly twice as melodious a note as
I can carry. Family members have requested
that I lip synch "Happy Birthday" at events
to save them embarrassment. As my awk
wardly pubescent cracking voice filled the
Metro car and I danced along like an elec
trified jellyfish, it fleetingly occurred to me
that anyone watehing would probably think
I had snapped. And they might be a little bit
right.
A friend who spent last summer in
Ghana told me the cardinal rule among
white students in Africa; NEVER talk to a
white person just because he is white. The
game is played the same way in Russia. For
those of us who came to Moscow fairly con
versant in the language and hoping to be
come more so, never seek someone out on
the street just because they speak your lan
guage. Better to suffer in pride than catch
up on celebrity gossip in shame.
When you're dealing with wild animals
you're never supposed to show your weak
spot; to the wild animals in this urban jun
gle, that weak spot is being American.
In all fairness, I've never been harassed
or seriously bothered in the city for being
American. It's more of a secret embarrass
ment. Every once in a while I have to ex
plain to a taxi driver that, no, I am not the
voter who single-handedly put Bush in the
White 1 louse and, by the way, great job on
that whole Brest-Litovsk thing — but on
the whole, 1 prefer to tell Russians about my
passion for their beautiful, lively city and

rich language and they're glad to hear
about it.
The real discomfort with being an Amer
ican in Moscow is our fellow tourists. British
teenage socialites with bulging shopping
bags blowing kisses to the Kremlin or Texan
high school students mocking Russian wait
resses to their faces make me angrier than
the most insensitive Russian assumptions
about American culture.
Nevertheless, for some reason 1 find my
self creeping around the ledge of this
abroad faux pas on a daily basis. Even mid
cringe I had to keep myself away from wan
dering up to aforementioned socialites and
making polite conversation about the
Thames River in the summer. Fortunately,
halfway through my friendly "Hullo!" I re
member that 1 know or care nothing about
the Thames in any season and duck into an
alley for some unsanitary shaverma.
Two weeks ago, 1 followed a man out of
his Metro stop and three blocks down the
street just because he was wearing my
boyfriend's cologne. He turned out to be
from Kazakhstan, and not a little freaked
out.
Last month, at the dregs of my home
sickness, a few friends and I sat at a bar and
watched a man in a blue argyle sweater
stroll in and immediately knock over a mi
crophone stand. My heart skipped a beat:
Obviously he was a Canadian! The logic of
Siberskaya Corona (at 24 rubles a bottle, it's
my favorite philosopher alter Dr. Drew)
told me to wander up to the man and ask if
he spoke German. If he answered in Eng
lish. obviously he was from our neighbor up
North.Then logic told me it would probably
be less embarrassing to dare a friend to do
it.
A few minutes later she came weaving
back: "He says he doesn't know German,
but his English is pretty good because he's

from Toronto." I bought everybody
a round and forgot about it until two
hours later. We staggered across the
dance floor to collect our coats and I
look up to realize that Argyle
Sweater is the band's lead singer. He
made eye contact with my friend
and screamed into the mic: "Tonight
I was accused of being German.
Tonight 1 was accused of being Ger
many
The thing is, no matter how
ridiculous some of the measures I've
taken to meet English-speakers, it's
like meeting a brother again to find
someone with whom 1 share not just
my literal words, but also a cultural
vocabulary. For some crazy reason,
your average Russian kebab-hawk
er is completely ignorant to the nick
names of Britney Spears' children
("Tater Tot" and "Small Fry"), the
delirious ping of a TiVo menu or the
existence of North Dakota.
After three months of skirting
my identity, pretending I'm only
American by accident and my lan
guage is a hideous blemish like a
club foot or a bad nose job, I finally
gave in on that Metro car and real
ized that I'm proud to be American
even, or especially, when that means
embarrassing myself. And of course
1 expressed my national pride the
way that any articulate, intelligent
woman would: by singing a song
about masturbation on public trans
portation. But my friends joined in
on the whoa-whoa-whoas, and be
tween us, I don't think they were
embarrassed either.
