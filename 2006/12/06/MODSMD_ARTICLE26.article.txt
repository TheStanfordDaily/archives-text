Monday, around I a.m. Justin 's head is
slumped onto his desk. Papers cov
ered in algebra and calculus lie
strewn across the floor. Several empty cans of
Rockstar Jill the trash bin. The walls are bare
white. Darren rolls into the room on the black
swivel chair he stole from upstairs. The most
recent episode of "Battlestar Galactica" is
paused in the upper left hand corner of his
MacÃŸook screen. He is wearing sweatpants
stained with Tabasco.
I >arren: (chipper) 1 ley guy, what you working
on?
Justin: (lifting his head) Problem sets. I've got
three due tomorrow.
Darren: You mean today tomorrow, or tomor
row tomorrow?
Justin: In nine hours tomorrow.
Darren: Oh. (A snarky grin dapples his face).
Say Justin, what's a problem set?
Justin: Shut it, douchehag. Go write an essay.
Darren: 1 am. I'm arguing that the films di
rected by Michael Mann portray the struggle
of the modern working man to defend his in
dividuality in a dehumanized modern age.
Like "Death of a Salesman" for the informa
tion age. It's pretty fricking sweet. Did you
know that Heat" starts at a train station and
ends at an airport, and "Collateral" starts at
an airport and ends at a train station? We film
studies majors have a word for stuff like that:
"Awesome."
Justin: Film studies. You can say anything
about anything,can't you?
Darren: No. I mean, I guess you could. No.
You wouldn't say "The Empire Strikes Back"
is a post-feminist deconstruction of adoles
cent sexuality. (He thoughtfully rubs his chin)
Except that the carbonite thing could be a
symbol for castration anxiety. Actually, pretty
much everything is a symbol for castration
anxiety.
Justin: Everything is everything. 1 wish math
had bullshit equations.
Darren. Well, you know, it's hard to write es
says.
Justin: How long did your last paper take
you?
Darren: 1 was thinking about it nonstop for
like two weeks. I wanted to start, but some
thing always came up. Readings, TV.
lunchtime, illegal drugs, parties, breakdowns,
shower cries. Fuzzy stuff. So then I wrote it the
night before it was due. Well, the morning.
Justin: 1 mix crushed caffeine pills in protein
shakes. Straight to the brain. 1 envy you. NOT.
1 have a job next year. Ihe future's bright.
Everything's coming up Justin.
Darren: Yeah, banking. Selling your soul for a
quick buck.
Justin: I resent that. It's an especially slow

buck. Next few years, I'm not sleeping, I'm
working 30 hours a day. On the weekends,
they let us wear jeans. That's how they weed
out the weak.Then I'll get a huge bonus, buy
a yacht and live with my wife in the suburbs
and my nubile young Latina mistress in the
city.Ten-year plan.
Darren: I could do all that, if I switched all the
IMDB brain cells over to calculus. But it's all
about the image, isn't it? Presenting the false
side of yourself. All you guys had to change
your Facebook profiles during interview sea
son, de-tag any offending pictures, take all the
hip-hop artists out of your favorite music.
Putting on a suit every day, making pretend
you're someone you're not.
Justin: That's hippie logic. You're a dirty hip
pie intelligent type.
Darren: Buy! Sell! Trade!
Justin: You can squat on my yacht, but keep it
clean.
Darren: Bet my mistress is younger than your
mistress.
Justin: Sophia will be barely legal according
to her fake ID. Besides,chicks like that don't
go for fuzzies. You'd just deconstruct them.
Darren: I'm just searching for myself. All
great writers search for themselves.
Justin: So do all the crappy writers. I never un
derstood the whole Fuzzy thing. I mean, 1 get
why so many girls are English majors, so they
can rebel against their parents before they
nab a rich attractive banker husband. But
what's a guy gonna do with a philosophy de
gree?
Darren: Trophy husband. Academia. Shoe
shiner. Law school, worst case.
Justin: That was a lot funnier in freshman
year. In my experience, there are two kinds of
Fuzzies.There's the pretentious ones who ac
tually think the world cares about medieval
studies or religious studies or any of those
other majors so self-important they have the
word "studies" in the title. They're oversold
fuckbirds, but at least they're happy. Then
there's ones who think self-deprecation
makes them less pretentious. But really, it just
makes me hate them even more. I'll throw
them pennies when they beg me for spare
change.
l)arren:Then you'll tip your top hat. fix your
monocle and light your Cuban cigar with hun

dretl dollar hills. 1 prefer Fuzzy self-depreca
tion to Techie egotism.
Justin: Techies are allowed to be egotistical.
They have quantifiable skills to offer human
ity, skills that keep the world spinning. Cogs in
the great chain of being, some more valuable
than others. Any how, most techies aren't ego
tistical, they're too busy studying in the 24-
hour room while all the kids who actually
read "The Confessions of St. Augustine" back
in IHUM are partying at FBF on Wednes
days and arguing over Thomas Pynchon.
Darren: You're not a techie,though. You're an
econ major, or something.
Justin: You've known me how long? I'm
MS&E. 1 have to take CS classes. See this?
(holds up piece of graph paper) This is math.
This is what adults do.
Darren: My god, you are a techie! Your class
es have numbers, not names. I don't even
know any of my class numbers. You can't put
a number on Creative Nonfiction, Cinema
and Ideology, Cyborgs and Synthetic Hu
mans...
Justin: That'll look great on the resume.
"Wrote a treatise on Christian subtext in Ter
minator 2."' What's the point of it all? Sure it's
great being smart and knowing stuff, but how
far's that take you? It's just bullshit teachers
teaching bullshit students all the bullshit the
ory their bullshit can bullshit; bullshit. You'll
be great at parties, if you ever get invited to
parties.
Darren: You won't invite me to your parties?
Justin: Only if you take a shower.
Darren: Come on. dude, knowledge is power.
Justin: That's all hogwash cocksuckery.
Fuzzies need to grow up. Studying doesn't
change the world. You belong to the one per
cent of humanity that controls 99 percent of
the wealth on this planet. You enjoy youth,
health and the obscene privileges of Ameri
can citizenship. You're writing about the
American Dream, which is an upper-class
propaganda lie, in "Collateral," a movie star
ring Tom Cruise with awful hair and a dyna
mite suit. That's the sort of self-absorbed and
decadent activity that only economic para
sites have the time to pursue. A self-reliant
man who's concerned about the world and
doesn't want to keep collecting an allowance
from Daddy when he's 40, wouldn't have the
time or energy for trivialities like that. You're
never going to leave the bubble, and barring
the very slight chance that the American pub
lic develops a taste for long-winded, adjec
tive-heavy writing, you're going to end up
working behind a counter asking me if I want
fries with that.
Darren: That's kind of pessimistic.

Ire and Vice
Justin: Reality is pessimistic. Eat,shit,
screw, die. Unit's history right there,
right back to when that Little Fish
Iliing climbed out of the ocean, ate
sand, passed the sand through his
still-evolving digestive system,
bagged himself a Little Miss Fish
Thing, and then died just in time to
admire how his child. Little Fish
I hinn Junior, had slightly more pow
erful leg-tin-whatevers. Evolution.
I here is a biological imperative to
ward power. There is no biological
imperative toward intellectual
douchebaggery.
Darren: Maybe so. Rut the world we
live is barely real anymore. Hie other
day. when I was trying to get in con
tact with someone, I called her,
AI Med her, emailed her, messaged

her on Facebook, messaged her on
mySpace, then ran into her at the
Col lo.'lTiat's five levels of reality, not
counting reality. We spend half of our
day consuming images. PowerPoint
presentations in boring lectures, TV
shows we download semi-legally
from Rit'lbrrent, online videogames
that make real life pale in compari
son. I can't slay ores in real life. My
phone wouldn't work for two days,
and when I fixed it I had 12 voice
mails and four text messages, most of
them urgent.
(Spotlight fulls on Darren.).
Twenty years ago, there weren't cell
phones, there wasn't SPAM, it was
just nerds on the internet playing
ZORK.'Ihe first ten thousand times I
saw a naked breast it was online.The
way we live is changing. You say
we're overanalytical parasites,
maybe that's true, but isn't every
body, now? How often d'you check
Wikipedia? Some chick over in
Korea died because she played a

videogame for three days straight
no sleep, no food. We're starting to
leave actual existence behind. Isn't it
only natural to worry about some
thing more than the physical world,
something beyond reality? Deus ex
Machina.or Machina ex Deus? Some
kid I knew in high school died two
years ago. lie's still on Facebook. I
friended him after the funeral. Does
that make sense? That's what film
studies, what all the Fuzzy classes are
about. Trying to find the whole equa
tion of history, culture, art. Like, Hu
manity, dude.
Justin: lhat is without a doubt the
biggest load of intellectual horse shit
I have heard from you today.
(thoughtfully) Could be we're not so
different, you and 1.1 lall of banking
is making shit into gold, just like writ
ing a book or designing a new iPod or
building a building. It's all creativity.
It's just that my creativity will make
me millions, billions, twillions of dol
lars and your creativity will make you

the most popular poet in the home
less shelter. (Checks his watch) You
want some Late Nite?
Darren: (spinning excitedly in his
chair) Do I!
Justin: Let's never fight again.
Darren: I'm low on cash. Pay you
hack this weekend.
Justin: Parasite.
Darren: Sycophant.
Justin: Crotch ninja.
Darren: Hasty-witted wagtail.
Justin: Mine was better.
Darren: Mine was Shakespeare.
(Exeunt)

Any resemblance to actual human be

dental. Darren would like to thank An
drew Shah for inspiration. He would
also like to thank Justin, female Eng
lish majors and the continent of Africa
ahead of time for not litigating. Email
him at dfranich@stanford.edu.
