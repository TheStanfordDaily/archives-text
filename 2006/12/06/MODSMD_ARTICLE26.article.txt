Monday, around I a.m. Justin 's head is
slumped onto his desk. Papers cov
ered in algebra and calculus lie
strewn across the floor. Several empty cans of
Rockstar Jill the trash bin. The walls are bare
white. Darren rolls into the room on the black
swivel chair he stole from upstairs. The most
recent episode of "Battlestar Galactica" is
paused in the upper left hand corner of his
MacÃŸook screen. He is wearing sweatpants
stained with Tabasco.
I >arren: (chipper) 1 ley guy, what you working
on?
Justin: (lifting his head) Problem sets. I've got
three due tomorrow.
Darren: You mean today tomorrow, or tomor
row tomorrow?
Justin: In nine hours tomorrow.
Darren: Oh. (A snarky grin dapples his face).
Say Justin, what's a problem set?
Justin: Shut it, douchehag. Go write an essay.
Darren: 1 am. I'm arguing that the films di
rected by Michael Mann portray the struggle
of the modern working man to defend his in
dividuality in a dehumanized modern age.
Like "Death of a Salesman" for the informa
tion age. It's pretty fricking sweet. Did you
know that Heat" starts at a train station and
ends at an airport, and "Collateral" starts at
an airport and ends at a train station? We film
studies majors have a word for stuff like that:
"Awesome."
Justin: Film studies. You can say anything
about anything,can't you?
Darren: No. I mean, I guess you could. No.
You wouldn't say "The Empire Strikes Back"
is a post-feminist deconstruction of adoles
cent sexuality. (He thoughtfully rubs his chin)
Except that the carbonite thing could be a
symbol for castration anxiety. Actually, pretty
much everything is a symbol for castration
anxiety.
Justin: Everything is everything. 1 wish math
had bullshit equations.
Darren. Well, you know, it's hard to write es
says.
Justin: How long did your last paper take
you?
Darren: 1 was thinking about it nonstop for
like two weeks. I wanted to start, but some
thing always came up. Readings, TV.
lunchtime, illegal drugs, parties, breakdowns,
shower cries. Fuzzy stuff. So then I wrote it the
night before it was due. Well, the morning.
Justin: 1 mix crushed caffeine pills in protein
shakes. Straight to the brain. 1 envy you. NOT.
1 have a job next year. Ihe future's bright.
Everything's coming up Justin.
Darren: Yeah, banking. Selling your soul for a
quick buck.
Justin: I resent that. It's an especially slow

buck. Next few years, I'm not sleeping, I'm
working 30 hours a day. On the weekends,
they let us wear jeans. That's how they weed
out the weak.Then I'll get a huge bonus, buy
a yacht and live with my wife in the suburbs
and my nubile young Latina mistress in the
city.Ten-year plan.
Darren: I could do all that, if I switched all the
IMDB brain cells over to calculus. But it's all
about the image, isn't it? Presenting the false
side of yourself. All you guys had to change
your Facebook profiles during interview sea
son, de-tag any offending pictures, take all the
hip-hop artists out of your favorite music.
Putting on a suit every day, making pretend
you're someone you're not.
Justin: That's hippie logic. You're a dirty hip
pie intelligent type.
Darren: Buy! Sell! Trade!
Justin: You can squat on my yacht, but keep it
clean.
Darren: Bet my mistress is younger than your
mistress.
Justin: Sophia will be barely legal according
to her fake ID. Besides,chicks like that don't
go for fuzzies. You'd just deconstruct them.
Darren: I'm just searching for myself. All
great writers search for themselves.
Justin: So do all the crappy writers. I never un
derstood the whole Fuzzy thing. I mean, 1 get
why so many girls are English majors, so they
can rebel against their parents before they
nab a rich attractive banker husband. But
what's a guy gonna do with a philosophy de
gree?
Darren: Trophy husband. Academia. Shoe
shiner. Law school, worst case.
Justin: That was a lot funnier in freshman
year. In my experience, there are two kinds of
Fuzzies.There's the pretentious ones who ac
tually think the world cares about medieval
studies or religious studies or any of those
other majors so self-important they have the
word "studies" in the title. They're oversold
fuckbirds, but at least they're happy. Then
there's ones who think self-deprecation
makes them less pretentious. But really, it just
makes me hate them even more. I'll throw
them pennies when they beg me for spare
change.
l)arren:Then you'll tip your top hat. fix your
monocle and light your Cuban cigar with hun

dretl dollar hills. 1 prefer Fuzzy self-depreca
tion to Techie egotism.
Justin: Techies are allowed to be egotistical.
They have quantifiable skills to offer human
ity, skills that keep the world spinning. Cogs in
the great chain of being, some more valuable
than others. Any how, most techies aren't ego
tistical, they're too busy studying in the 24-
hour room while all the kids who actually
read "The Confessions of St. Augustine" back
in IHUM are partying at FBF on Wednes
days and arguing over Thomas Pynchon.
Darren: You're not a techie,though. You're an
econ major, or something.
Justin: You've known me how long? I'm
MS&E. 1 have to take CS classes. See this?
(holds up piece of graph paper) This is math.
This is what adults do.
Darren: My god, you are a techie! Your class
es have numbers, not names. I don't even
know any of my class numbers. You can't put
a number on Creative Nonfiction, Cinema
and Ideology, Cyborgs and Synthetic Hu
mans...
Justin: That'll look great on the resume.
"Wrote a treatise on Christian subtext in Ter
minator 2."' What's the point of it all? Sure it's
great being smart and knowing stuff, but how
far's that take you? It's just bullshit teachers
teaching bullshit students all the bullshit the
ory their bullshit can bullshit; bullshit. You'll
be great at parties, if you ever get invited to
parties.
Darren: You won't invite me to your parties?
Justin: Only if you take a shower.
Darren: Come on. dude, knowledge is power.
Justin: That's all hogwash cocksuckery.
Fuzzies need to grow up. Studying doesn't
change the world. You belong to the one per
cent of humanity that controls 99 percent of
the wealth on this planet. You enjoy youth,
health and the obscene privileges of Ameri
can citizenship. You're writing about the
American Dream, which is an upper-class
propaganda lie, in "Collateral," a movie star
ring Tom Cruise with awful hair and a dyna
mite suit. That's the sort of self-absorbed and
decadent activity that only economic para
sites have the time to pursue. A self-reliant
man who's concerned about the world and
doesn't want to keep collecting an allowance
from Daddy when he's 40, wouldn't have the
time or energy for trivialities like that. You're
never going to leave the bubble, and barring
the very slight chance that the American pub
lic develops a taste for long-winded, adjec
tive-heavy writing, you're going to end up
working behind a counter asking me if I want
fries with that.
Darren: That's kind of pessimistic.
