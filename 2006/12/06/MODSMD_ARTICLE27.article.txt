## University's pandemic policy 
### GREG BOARDMAN 
Emergency preparedness is a high
priority at Stanford. Recently, the
topic of pandemic influen/a has been
in the news, so I want to let you know
about actions the University is taking
to prepare for a possible outbreak on
01 near campus and actions that you
can take as well.
A campus-w ide task force has been
meeting regularly for over a year to
develop and review emergency plans
specifically related to pandemic in
fluenza. lliis effort involves not only
Stanford, but the Santa Clara County
Public Health Department, Stanford
Hospital and Clinics. I.utile Packard
('hildren's I lospital and infectious dis
ease experts from the Medical School.
Ihere are two significant concerns
driving the University's planning:
First, the fact that the campus is home
to a large population of students who
live in close proximity to one another;
and second, the likelihood that, in the
event of a pandemic, healthcare re
sources would be stretched thin.

Should a pandemic occur,our main
defense against contagion would he
"social distancing" â€” that is, minimiz
ing the amount of contact between
members of the community. To
achieve this could entail suspending
classes and normal University opera
tions, closing undergraduate resi
dences, dosing some graduate student
housing and sending students home
when possible.
I or this reason, it is important that
you talk with your family or relatives
about how you would return home or
travel to an alternative residence on
short notice in the event that the cam
pus is closed.
In any emergency, communication
is of paramount importance. You and
your family can consult the Universi
ty's main Web page
(www.stanford.edu) for regularly up
dated information in the event of a
major emergency Please be sure your
family and relatives are aware of this
Web site.
For updates on pandemic influenza
planning, visit

www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/news
/avianflu.html. Ihis website also con
tains valuable information about pre
venting the transmission of colds, flu
and other infectious diseases. We rec
ommend following this advice,
whether or not there is an influenza
outbreak.
Finally, it is important for students
to take steps to prepare for a variety of
possible emergencies. In particular,
you should be familiar with the evacu
ation plan for your residence and
stock your own emergency kit with
prescription medications, water and
other essentials. Find additional infor
mation on personal preparedness at

I hope that you enjoy your winter
holiday and, at the same time, spend a
few minutes discussing emergency
planning with your family and rela
tives.
