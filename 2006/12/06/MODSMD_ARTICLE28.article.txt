### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
BERKELEY, Calif. — When
Michael Ok wo emerged from the
locker room to do post-game inter
views after Stanford's 26-17 loss to
California in the l()9th Big Game, he
was wiping away tears.

California 26

"I don't think I have cried since I
was six years old." the senior line
hacker said."l really didn't think that
it would come out of me. There are a
lot of memories that come back.
Football is such a big part of our lives
that you leave part of yourself he
hind."
Okwo and his teammates had
something to be proud of in the final
game of the season, but even their
best performance of the year wasn't
enough to retake the Axe against the
No. 21 Bears (9-3, 7-2 Pac-10). The
Cardinal trailed by just three points
midway through the third quarter
and their two offensive touchdowns
was the most scored in one game in
Pac-10 play.
But mistakes haunted the Cardi
nal (1-11.1-8) as they had all season.
As the defense had undoubtedly

their strongest outing of the season,
Stanford's offense failed tocapitalize
on opportunities throughout the
game.
"Everyone was locked in and
ready to leave it all on the field,"
Okwo said. "That's exactly what we
came out and did. We were ready to
celebrate. At the end. we felt like we
deserved to celebrate on their field.
But we just couldn't get it done."
I he biggest blow to Stanford's
chances came early in the fourth
quarter. Trailing 23-17. Okwo
stripped the ball away from Cal tail
back Marshawn Lynch at the Bears'
14-yard line. But Stanford couldn't
capitalize as the Cardinal moved the
ball just two yards before attempting
a 29-yard field goal. Aaron Zagory's
attempt sailed wide left and the Car
dinal came away empty-handed.
"We were unable to execute dur
ing that three-play series and missed
the field goal, as well." Stanford
coach Walt Harris said. "When you
look back at the game, there were a
lot of really good plays by our of
fense, defense and special teams. Un
fortunately that wasn't a really good
series for us."
Stanford got the ball back later in
the quarter, but again couldn't move
the ball. Cal kicked a field goal on
their final possession to put the game
out of reach.
While the Cardinal failed to take
advantage of a Cal turnover, the

Bears were quick to capitalize when
Stanford coughed up the hall. Late in
the second quarter. Ostrander
dropped back to hand the ball off to
freshman running back Toby Ger
hart from the Stanford 20-yard line.
But Ostrander never had a good grip
on the ball, it popped loose and Cal
cornerback Syd'Quan Thompson
scooped it up and took it in for a
touchdown.
"1 don't think anybody is totally
satisfied with our effort today." jun
ior quarterback T.C. Ostrander said.
"Yeah, we can see that there has
been improvement, but we had a
chance. We had a chance, so we're

disappointed."
The offense did have some big
moments, including a beautiful 51-
yard. one-handed touchdown recep
tion to senior receiver Evan Moore
early in the third quarter. The score
cut Cal's advantage to 20-17. but the
Cardinal could never take the lead.
The Cardinal's first trip to the
end/one came in the closing minutes
of the first half., when Ostrander
found freshman receiver Richard
Sherman on a slant route for an
eight-yard touchdown toss. Sherman
beat Pac-10 Defensive Player of the
Year Daymeion Hughes on the
score.

Ostrander finished the game with
204 yards through the air to go along
with the two touchdown passes.
Sherman led the Stanford receiving
corps with 81 yards.
"I'm pretty sure that this is the
most success we've had moving the
ball down the field in a while." Os
trander said. "I thought a lot of our
guys — all of our guys — played
with a lot of heart and played really
well. 1 thought the line stepped up
big-time, and I'm proud of them for
that."
