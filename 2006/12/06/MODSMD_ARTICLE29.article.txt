# Courage under fire
## 
### 
Well. Walt Harris got what
Stanford football's wanted
for five years: the Axe. Here
are some key points as the program
begins it transition to its third head
coach in four years.
Any discussion needs to start with
shots all around for new Athletic Di
rector Boh Bowlsby. First of all. to
have the courage to fire a guy after
two years, one short of the conven
tional three. Unlike predecessor Ted
Leland. who stuck with a far worse
coach in Buddy Teevens for three
seasons, Bowlsby saw that the pro
gram was headed downhill in a hurry
and knew he owed it to the students
to try to change things up as quickly
as possible.
"I think probably the most critical
assessment 1 had to make was:' Does
investing another year present the
likely possibility of making substan
tial improvement?"'said Bowlsby on
Monday. "It I couldn't answer that af
firmatively, which 1 ultimately didn't,
then I ultimately felt like it was better
to make the change now than wait
more time. I don't know that was en
tirely fair [to I larris], but my first re
sponsibility is fairness to our institu
tion and to our student-athletes."

cision few Athletic Directors would
have had the courage to make.
But, for the icing on the cake,
Bowlsby kept the decision private to
prevent from distracting this year's
team, even though he must have
known for months. Consider, for ex
ample. that he said he hopes to hire a
new head coach within two weeks.
That search is a two-month process at
a minimum, so you can infer that
Bowlsby is, quietly, at least six weeks
into the process. The quick turn
around is all the more important for
attracting recruits with national sign
ing day fast approaching, and Bowls
by managed to compromise neither
that, nor this season under Harris.
Sure, people speculated, and bro
ken watches are right twice a day, but
no one 1 know of — and that includes
plenty of players and some promi
nent folks in the media — had any
definitive idea the firing was coming
until the season had already ended.
In fact,reporters who've been cover
ing Stanford for 20 times as long as
me — with 200 times the salary and
reputation — swore to me, on the
record, that Harris would return.
Bowlsby has walked an incredibly
thin tightrope with grace and vision
to get Stanford football to this point.
But now comes the hard part. His
hire of Kirk Ferentz at lowa made
him a national star, and his reputa
tion here will depend just as much on
the name that comes out of his mouth

before Christmas break.
Having said all that, fans need to
be patient next year. Hie incoming
recruiting class will be similar to
Stanford's current talent pool — to
ward the bottom of the league. Next
year's schedule will likely be the
toughest in the country, with all nine
Pac-10 teams, Notre Dame, Texas
Christian and San Jose State. Take
out all the games against each other,
and those squads went a combined
65-13 this year. Michael Jordan's
Chicauo Bulls strucgle to reach 65-
13.
Trent Edwards and Michael
Okwo, this year's two best players,
both depart, and the new coach and
new staff will be in their first year.
Anything above four wins would be a
miracle, so judge not on the record,
but on whether you think the team is
getting better.
But who to hire for the job? My
dream candidate is Texas Tech head
coach Mike Leach. His offense has
consistently been one of the best in
the nation, even though his program
often gets fourth dibs (after Texas,
Texas A&M and Oklahoma) on
homebred recruits. Watching his of
fense operate today seems like
we're watching the spread attack in
1%7: you know the man is 30 years
ahead of his peers in terms of inno
vation. He's conventionally smart,
which is a huge plus at the brainiest
of all Division 1-A football schools,
and. like Bowlsby. is willing to take
risks and break the mold: Michael
Lewis of the New York Times de
scribes how he inspired his team
with a lengthy diatribe on. of all
things, pirates. Now that I've won

over the Band. You Tube the unin
tentionally hilarious video of him
broadcasting the weather at the
local television station. Who would
n't want to play for this guy? (Email
bowlsby@stanford.edu if you agree
with me. I'm sure he appreciates the
input.)
I'm so high on Leach that I put
him'higher than three guys with con
nections to my home state of Michi
gan who are also generating plenty of
rumors. Michigan defensive coordi
nator Ron English would be a solid
choice — young, African-American
(which arguably helps with recruit
ing). energetic. Bay Area roots. I've
interviewed him and he's not the
best-spoken guy in the world (he did
attend Cal after all), and you have to
wonder whether Michigan's success
this year is a one-year fluke or really
English's doing, but he would be a
clean break from I larris in almost
every regard and I would applaud his
selection.
Former Michigan quarterback
Jim Harbaugh and former Detroit
Lions and San Francisco 49ers
coach Steve Mariucci are the other
Michigan ties, but I see nothing spe
cial in either. Same goes for another
hot name, Torn O'Brien, currently
Boston College's head coach. Sure,
he has succeeded at a school small
er. private and more academically
challenging than its rivals, but. judg
ing on Boston College's always
good but never-great seasons, he
seems a safe choice without a high
upside.

known for months. Consider, for ex
ample. that he said he hopes to hire a
new head coach within two weeks.
That search is a two-month process at
a minimum, so you can infer that
Bowlsby is, quietly, at least six weeks
into the process. The quick turn
around is all the more important for
attracting recruits with national sign
ing day fast approaching, and Bowls
by managed to compromise neither
that, nor this season under Harris.
Sure, people speculated, and bro
ken watches are right twice a day, but
no one 1 know of — and that includes
plenty of players and some promi
nent folks in the media — had any
definitive idea the firing was coming
until the season had already ended.
In fact,reporters who've been cover
ing Stanford for 20 times as long as
me — with 200 times the salary and
reputation — swore to me, on the
record, that Harris would return.
Bowlsby has walked an incredibly
thin tightrope with grace and vision
to get Stanford football to this point.
But now comes the hard part. His
hire of Kirk Ferentz at lowa made
him a national star, and his reputa
tion here will depend just as much on
the name that comes out of his mouth

before Christmas break.
Having said all that, fans need to
be patient next year. Hie incoming
recruiting class will be similar to
Stanford's current talent pool — to
ward the bottom of the league. Next
year's schedule will likely be the
toughest in the country, with all nine
Pac-10 teams, Notre Dame, Texas
Christian and San Jose State. Take
out all the games against each other,
and those squads went a combined
65-13 this year. Michael Jordan's
Chicauo Bulls strucgle to reach 65-
13.
Trent Edwards and Michael
Okwo, this year's two best players,
both depart, and the new coach and
new staff will be in their first year.
Anything above four wins would be a
miracle, so judge not on the record,
but on whether you think the team is
getting better.
But who to hire for the job? My
dream candidate is Texas Tech head
coach Mike Leach. His offense has
consistently been one of the best in
the nation, even though his program
often gets fourth dibs (after Texas,
Texas A&M and Oklahoma) on
homebred recruits. Watching his of
fense operate today seems like
we're watching the spread attack in
1%7: you know the man is 30 years
ahead of his peers in terms of inno
vation. He's conventionally smart,
which is a huge plus at the brainiest
of all Division 1-A football schools,
and. like Bowlsby. is willing to take
risks and break the mold: Michael
Lewis of the New York Times de
scribes how he inspired his team
with a lengthy diatribe on. of all
things, pirates. Now that I've won

over the Band. You Tube the unin
tentionally hilarious video of him
broadcasting the weather at the
local television station. Who would
n't want to play for this guy? (Email
bowlsby@stanford.edu if you agree
with me. I'm sure he appreciates the
input.)
I'm so high on Leach that I put
him'higher than three guys with con
nections to my home state of Michi
gan who are also generating plenty of
rumors. Michigan defensive coordi
nator Ron English would be a solid
choice — young, African-American
(which arguably helps with recruit
ing). energetic. Bay Area roots. I've
interviewed him and he's not the
best-spoken guy in the world (he did
attend Cal after all), and you have to
wonder whether Michigan's success
this year is a one-year fluke or really
English's doing, but he would be a
clean break from I larris in almost
every regard and I would applaud his
selection.
Former Michigan quarterback
Jim Harbaugh and former Detroit
Lions and San Francisco 49ers
coach Steve Mariucci are the other
Michigan ties, but I see nothing spe
cial in either. Same goes for another
hot name, Torn O'Brien, currently
Boston College's head coach. Sure,
he has succeeded at a school small
er. private and more academically
challenging than its rivals, but. judg
ing on Boston College's always
good but never-great seasons, he
seems a safe choice without a high
upside.

Well. Walt Harris got what
Stanford football's wanted
for five years: the Axe. Here
are some key points as the program
begins it transition to its third head
coach in four years.
Any discussion needs to start with
shots all around for new Athletic Di
rector Boh Bowlsby. First of all. to
have the courage to fire a guy after
two years, one short of the conven
tional three. Unlike predecessor Ted
Leland. who stuck with a far worse
coach in Buddy Teevens for three
seasons, Bowlsby saw that the pro
gram was headed downhill in a hurry
and knew he owed it to the students
to try to change things up as quickly
as possible.
"I think probably the most critical
assessment 1 had to make was:' Does
investing another year present the
likely possibility of making substan
tial improvement?"'said Bowlsby on
Monday. "It I couldn't answer that af
firmatively, which 1 ultimately didn't,
then I ultimately felt like it was better
to make the change now than wait
more time. I don't know that was en
tirely fair [to I larris], but my first re
sponsibility is fairness to our institu
tion and to our student-athletes."
It bears repeating: Bowlsby saved
us all another year of agony with a de
