### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Vandals struck the Community Conference Cen
ter this Saturday, leaving police searching for clues
and some student groups wondering if the destruc
tion was racially motivated.
A large white board, poster and thermostat were
found ripped off the wall at the community confer
ence room located next to El Centro Chicano, Asso
ciate Dean of Students Thorn Massey told The Daily.
Furniture was also overturned, a Native American

basket had been de
stroyed, and a fire
extinguisher had
been discharged, its
contents sprayed
over the entire con
ference room.
The center serves
as a meeting space
for El Centro Chi
cano, the Black
Community Ser
vices Center, the
Asian American
Activities Center
and the Native
American Cultural
Center.
"We are current
ly going through the
damage to see what
needs to be repaired
and informing the
students about the
incidents to see
whether they have
any information rel
evant to the investi
gation," Massey

said." We are also looking at the possibility of having
| police | officers outside the Community Conference
Center for the remainder of the quarter, so that peo
ple feel safe."
The destruction of the Native American basket
and the targeting of the center itself left some stu
dents wondering it the vandalism was more than just
a college prank.
"It seems that someone, or a group of people, is
angry at the students who use these spaces and
failed to express their frustration in a constructive
way and instead displayed their opinions in an
overtly aggressive manner, said senior Adia Good
en, co-chair of the Black Student Union
