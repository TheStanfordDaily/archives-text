SAN JOSH — Stanford dominated in the
paint Sunday afternoon at the Pete Newell
Challenge to beat Texas Tech, 70-56.
Sophomore forward Lawrence Hill scored
19. Brook Lopez added IS and sophomore
guard Anthony Goods chipped in 11. pre
venting Red Raiders head coach Bobby
Knight from reaching 876 career wins and
passing Adolph Rupp for second all-time
in career victories.
Brook Lopez scored his first points of
his Stanford (6-1) career on a two-handed
dunk, less than a minute after entering the
contest with 3:02 left in the first half. He
didn't look back — finishing with seven
points on the half and a beaming smile
postgame.
"It was really exciting for me — that
first dunk, it just felt wonderful," said
Lopez, returning to action for the first time
since a back injury sidelined him in July.

churlish as ever on the Red Raider
(6-3) bench. Understandably so, as
his team trailed the entire first half
en route to a 34-24 halftime deficit,
only to trail by double digits the en
tire second half.
"Stanford started out really well
and it sure looked like two really
mismatched teams," said Knight,just
five wins away from passing North
Carolina's Dean Smith for first all
time. "We made a lot of mistakes. We
made mistakes defensively in terms
of positioning, and they cost us a lot
in terms of this game."

Cardinal Coach Trent Johnson
knew Stanford had an advantage in
side against a weak Texas Tech front
court. Defensively, he played zone
the whole 40 minutes to emphasize
his team's inside length.The strategy
worked, as only potential All-Amer
ican guard Jarrius Jackson (21
points) and forward Martin Zeno
(16 points) found any rhythm.
Offensively, the plan was similar
ly simple and effective: pound the
ball inside.
"1 thought we have to establish
the inside presence because we're
seven feet, 245 in a couple of posi
tions [freshmen centers Brook and
Robin Lopez], 6-foot-10, 6-foot-9
[Hill and junior center Peter
Prowitt]," Johnson said.
And after the second of those

seven-footers checked into the game.
Knight saw the writing on the wall.
"We don't have a great inside
game, so when we make mistakes in
side. we can't overcome them," he
said.
The Cardinal now head into a
two-week-long bye for finals on a de
cidedly positive note.
"Our first test was against Air
Force and we failed that miserably,
so it's nice to get the win," Coach
Trent Johnson said. "We've im
proved visibly."
And. Sunday, no one improved
more dramatically than Brook
Lopez.
"1 felt more comfortable than
against Davis," he said. "They're a
tough team to play against, but it felt
really good."
