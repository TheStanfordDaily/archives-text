locker room to earn a 73-49 victory on Sunday.
Ahead 36-30 at the halfway point,the Cardi
nal (4-3) scored five points in the first forty sec
onds of the second half, as sophomore forward
Jillian Harmon hit a jumper and junior guard
Candice Wiggins nailed a three after freshman
point guard J J Hones notched a steal. A quick
answer from Texas Tech (7-2) was soon forgot
ten after Stanford scored 14 straight points
over the next seven minutes, building a lead
that never dropped below 20 points for the re
mainder of the game.
The run was punctuated by a number of of
fensive rebounds and a much-improved de
fense, including several thunderous blocks
from the centers — senior kristen Newlin and
freshman Jayne Appel — who each grabbed
seven rebounds to lead the team.
Wiggins led the team with 19 points, 13 of
which came in the second half. Senior forward
Brooke Smith (14 points) and Appel (11
points) also joined Wiggins in double-digits. Se
