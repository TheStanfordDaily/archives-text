## Texas two-step Men capture third in Austin 
### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's swim
ming and diving team may not have
broken any records last weekend at
the Texas Invitational in Austin,Tex.
But given its strong performance at
the event, it may not be long until it
does.
Although the squad didn't swim
any of the five relay events, the Car

dinal still earned enough points to
place third in a field of 11, scoring 543
points. Only No. 6 Arizona and No. 1
Texas outperformed the Cardinal,
with 787 and 68 l ) points respectively.
Assistant coach Ted Knapp said
the team performed well despite
being forced to swim tired.
"The men were just coming off a
heavy training load during the week
of Thanksgiving," Knapp said. "1
think they swam as well as they could
have given the little preparation they
had."
Knapp described the Texas Invite,
which featured many of the nation's
top teams, as similar to NCAA
Championships, and likened the
Speedo Cup two weeks ago to Pacif
ic-10 Conference Tournament.
Knapp claimed the back-to-back
meets would give the team crucial
practice for the season ending
events.
"Basically without realizing it, the
Speedo cup two weeks ago and this
meet closely mirrored the Pac
-10/NCAA sequence," Knapp said.
"This meet was a real blessing to give
our guys practice for the champi
onship season".
Though they were less rested than
powerhouses Arizona and Texas, the
Stanford men managed to claim
multiple individual victories. Seniors
Shaun Phillips and Hongzhe Sun
earned two wins apiece, with Phillips
taking the 500 and 1650 freestyles
and Sun leading the field in the 200
backstroke and 200 butterfly. Sopho
more diver Dwight Dumais also
dominated both of the diving events
at the meet, winning the 1-meter and
the 3-meter diving competitions.
Top-three finishers for the Cardi
nal include sophomore Nate Cass,

who placed second to Olympian and
world-record-holder Brendan
Hansen in both the 100 and 200-yard
breaststrokes. In the 200. Cass was
narrowly out-touched, finishing only
five-hundredths of a second away
from first place. Fellow sophomore
Chris Ash followed Cass for third in
the 2(H) breaststroke, while seniors
Ben Wildman-Tobriner and Andy
Grant also claimed third-place hon
ors in the 50 freestyle and 200 back
stroke. respectively. In addition to
their victories. Sun came in second in
the 200 and 400 individual medleys,
while Phillips finished second in the
200 freestyle.
The Invitational marked the final
competition for the men until Jan. 12,
when the Cardinal will travel to face
Pac-10 rivals Arizona and Arizona
State. According to Knapp, the team
will be cut some slack until finals are
over, but then will undergo their

most intense training of the year dur
ing winter break.
"During Dead Week and finals,
the guys will only be asked to come in
once a day in order to keep the work
load volume up, but the intensity
won't be too high," Knapp said.
"Christmas training begins right
after that, and that's when we're real
ly going to step up the workload â€”
doing two-practices a day on most
days as well as a circuit."
Although coaches won't be grant
ing the team much of a break in their
training, they were nevertheless
pleased with squad's performance in
Texas.
"The meet actually went better
than what we had in mind," Knapp
said. "Not necessarily because the
times were particularly fast, but be
cause the guys did a great job against
the tough competition."
