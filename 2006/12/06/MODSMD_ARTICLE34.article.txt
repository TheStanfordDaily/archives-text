No. 18 Wisconsin and No. 9 I JSC

Freshman Julia Smit continued to
put up impressive times for the Car

and 400 individual medley, achieving
NCAA "A" times in both events.
Smit's effort made her Stanford's
No. 3 and No. 2 all-time performer in
the two events, respectively.
"Julia had an unbelievable per
formance again tonight," said Stan
ford head coach Lea Maurer after
Smit's IM swim on Friday. "She is
making her mark and people are
noticing. She continually comes out
and is looking to get better each race.
There doesn't seem to be a ceiling on
what she can do. Julia is making the
4(M) IM exciting and something that
people really want to watch."
Smit also swam on Thursday's
school record-breaking 2(H) freestyle
relay team along with sophomores
Madeline Rovira and Fiona O'Don
nell-McCarthy and junior Brooke
Bishop.
"Getting the school record was
exciting," Bishop said. "It's fun to
see all the sprinters step up at this
point in the season and go fast." *
