There doesn't seem to be a ceiling on
what she can do. Julia is making the
4(M) IM exciting and something that
people really want to watch."

exciting," Bishop said. "It's fun to
see all the sprinters step up at this
point in the season and go fast." *
"The energy stemming from the
relay win was an inspiring way to
begin the meet," Rovira added. "The
record was a great demonstration of
the resounding strength of our team
and of the work and training we have
done up to this point in the season."

their performance this weekend but
remain focused on what lies ahead.
"I think our team showed a lot of
tenacity this weekend, it takes a lot
of focus to approach a three-day pre
lims/finals meet," O'Donnell-Mc-
Carthy said. "We were able to race
some of the top teams in the country
and it provided us with a lot of infor
mation about what it is going to take
to be in the running for a national
championship."

tion for more than a month before
