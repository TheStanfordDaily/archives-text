## Undergrads bemoan Law Library ban 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the second quarter in a row. undergraduates
have been banned from Law Library reading
rooms for Dead Week and finals week, a move that
has drawn praise from law students and grumblings
from undergrads.
The change was made last spring after law stu
dents complained that increased noise and over
crowding was detracting from the study environ
ment of the library.
"They're allowed to use our libraries so why
shouldn't we be allowed to use theirs?" said senior
I leidi Moseson."ln general,all the facilities on cam
pus are equally accessible to everyone."
On the other side of the turnstile, however, the
restriction is a welcome respite from reading
rooms packed with latte-sipping undergraduates.
"It's a reasonable policy and I think most folks

see that." said Paul Lomio, director of the Law Li
brary. "We have had serious overcrowding in the
past, to the point where seats were not available on
the first floor, and that's not a good situation."
Lomio said that while he tolerates the presence
of undergraduates in the reading rooms, finals
week is an important time for law students to have
adequate quiet space.
"In law school, grades are often determined by
one exam, and this one exam often takes the form
of an eight-hour take-home." Lomio said . "Many of
our students live far from campus, some have small
children at home â€” for these reasons the library
becomes home for our students taking these
exams. And whether they are taking a take-home
exam or not. the intensive end-of-semester review
and study requires quiet library access."
Prior to 1989, access to the Law Library was re
stricted to law students, allowing undergrads in
only on the basis of'legal research.' But when the

Loma Prieta earthquake scattered nearly 100,000
books across the library, undergraduate and gradu
ate students helped in the cleanup.
"ITiis army of undergraduate volunteers joined
forces with the Law School faculty, staff and stu
dents, and we all worked side by side to put the li
brary back in order," Lomio said. "We were back in
full operation thanks to these combined efforts."
Moved by the undergraduate efforts, Law
School administrators decided to loosen the re
strictions and admit undergrade
However, as more non-law students have
crowded the library in recent years, administrators
have pursued a limited-access policy, allowing un
dergrads admittance to every facility except for the
reading rooms during finals week.
"This is actually a common practice at law
schools," Lomio said. "It's only an issue during
