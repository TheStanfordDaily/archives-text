## Budget cuts endanger Med diversity Med School tracks down private funding for diversity program 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fourth-year medical student Ri
cardo Paniagua still remembers the
first time he met Dr. Ron Garcia, pro
gram director of the Medical School's
diversity-promoting Center for Ex
cellence.
"How?" he remembers Garcia
asking during the admissions inter
view. "How did you arrive at the point
in your life in which applying to med
ical school was even an option?"
Paniagua — who had not applied
as a disadvantaged student despite
growing up in a single-wide trailer in
rural northern California and attend
ing a high school where only ten per
cent of the graduating class attended
college — was intrigued. Other inter
viewers had asked him the generic
drill of why he wanted a career in
medicine and what he hoped to ac
complish, but it was the first time any
one had cared to ask him "how" —
how he had even gotten onto the
track to becoming a doctor.
It was then, he says now, that here

alized that Stanford's School of Med
icine was different than others. And it
was then that he knew that Stanford
was where he belonged.
But stories like Paniagua's — al
ready rare — might become even less
common if federal funding for Cen
ters of Excellence (COEs) at medical
schools around the country' is not re
stored soon. One of the main adminis
trative offices for promoting diversity,
the COE may be in financial jeopardy
if the final funding decision does not
weigh in its favor soon.
Two years ago. Congress allocated
$33.6 million in grants to 34 COEs. in
cluding Stanford's. But in his most re
cent budget plan. President Bush pro
posed no funding for COEs for the
current year, which began on Oct. 1.

"There have been no new dollars
from the federal government." Garcia
said.
The budget is still under consider
ation by Congress, which is currently
working on stopgap budgetary meas
ures to forestall a shutdown of the
federal government.
In a recent trip to Washington.
Garcia met with aides for Sen. Bar
bara Boxer (D -CA) and Rep. Nancy
Pelosi (D-CA).
"From my conversations, my sense
is that we are in a transition period,
since the Democratic Congress is tak
ing shape right now." he said. "1 am
hopeful that there will be some action
on the 2(X)7 budget, but I am not sure
that that is going to happen."
According to Garcia, the COE has

promoted diversity through a variety
of means since its inception at Stan
ford. "Pipeline programs," for exam
ple, target young students — from
middle schools to community colleges
— to encourage more underrepre
sented and disadvantaged students to
consider careers in medicine.
But the lack of federal funding has
made such outreach unsustainable.
Programs for middle school and high
school students have already been
cut. while community college out
reach — once national — has been
narrowed to just the Bay Area.
The COE also maintains an early
matriculation program designed "to
jumpstart careers in leadership in
