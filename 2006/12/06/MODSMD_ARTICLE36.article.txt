## Budget cuts endanger Med diversity Med School tracks down private funding for diversity program 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fourth-year medical student Ri
cardo Paniagua still remembers the
first time he met Dr. Ron Garcia, pro
gram director of the Medical School's
diversity-promoting Center for Ex
cellence.
"How?" he remembers Garcia
asking during the admissions inter
view. "How did you arrive at the point
in your life in which applying to med
ical school was even an option?"
Paniagua — who had not applied
as a disadvantaged student despite
growing up in a single-wide trailer in
rural northern California and attend
ing a high school where only ten per
cent of the graduating class attended
college — was intrigued. Other inter
viewers had asked him the generic
drill of why he wanted a career in
medicine and what he hoped to ac
complish, but it was the first time any
one had cared to ask him "how" —
how he had even gotten onto the
track to becoming a doctor.
It was then, he says now, that here

alized that Stanford's School of Med
icine was different than others. And it
was then that he knew that Stanford
was where he belonged.
But stories like Paniagua's — al
ready rare — might become even less
common if federal funding for Cen
ters of Excellence (COEs) at medical
schools around the country' is not re
stored soon. One of the main adminis
trative offices for promoting diversity,
the COE may be in financial jeopardy
if the final funding decision does not
weigh in its favor soon.
Two years ago. Congress allocated
$33.6 million in grants to 34 COEs. in
cluding Stanford's. But in his most re
cent budget plan. President Bush pro
posed no funding for COEs for the
current year, which began on Oct. 1.

"There have been no new dollars
from the federal government." Garcia
said.
The budget is still under consider
ation by Congress, which is currently
working on stopgap budgetary meas
ures to forestall a shutdown of the
federal government.
In a recent trip to Washington.
Garcia met with aides for Sen. Bar
bara Boxer (D -CA) and Rep. Nancy
Pelosi (D-CA).
"From my conversations, my sense
is that we are in a transition period,
since the Democratic Congress is tak
ing shape right now." he said. "1 am
hopeful that there will be some action
on the 2(X)7 budget, but I am not sure
that that is going to happen."
According to Garcia, the COE has

promoted diversity through a variety
of means since its inception at Stan
ford. "Pipeline programs," for exam
ple, target young students — from
middle schools to community colleges
— to encourage more underrepre
sented and disadvantaged students to
consider careers in medicine.
But the lack of federal funding has
made such outreach unsustainable.
Programs for middle school and high
school students have already been
cut. while community college out
reach — once national — has been
narrowed to just the Bay Area.
The COE also maintains an early
matriculation program designed "to
jumpstart careers in leadership in
medicine," in addition to providing
tutorial services, offering student
counseling, sponsoring research and
promoting cultural awareness, Gar
cia said.
Its efforts are not solely directed at
students either. Another main objec
tive of the COE is to encourage the
development and retention of minor
ity faculty members. In turn, these
professors serve as role models for
minority students.
Since federal funding was cut in
September, the Medical School
Dean's office has provided extra
funding to keep the COE afloat. In
the meantime, COE officials say they
are looking at other, more perma
nent sources of funding, including
private foundations, individual
donors and state philanthropic or
ganizations.
"We have looked at primary core
programs and funding to keep that
going for the next couple of years,"
said Dr. Fernando Mendoza, who is
the principal investigator at the
COE.
As far as federal monetary
sources to promote a more diverse
student body goes, however, there
are few other options.
"The COEs were the prime

groups that got funding for this." he
said. "They were the most systematic
approach."
Losing the COE and its programs
would be a blow not only to the ad
ministration's efforts to promote di-,
versitv. but also to minority students
who credit the COE for playing a
crucial role.
"'lTie COE at Stanford Medical
School has been invaluable to me."
said Kimberly Montez. who is co
president of the Latino Medical Stu
dent Association. "These funding
cuts will result in a decrease in the
number of minority students admit
ted to medical school and ultimately
fewer persons with less access to cul
turally skilled physicians.
"Our chapter of the Latino Med
ical Student Association has teamed
up with other chapters throughout
California, Arizona, Oregon and
Washington and Dr. Bob Montoya to
petition Congress to restore funding
for COE," she added. The group h;is
already submitted a petition with 120
signatures from the roughly 170 stu
dents who make up the first and sec
ond-year classes at the medical
school.
A request for student opinions on
the COE met with an overwhelming
show of support, with most students
praising specific programs — rang
ing from COE's support for a sum
mer program hosted by the Stanford
University Minority Medical Al
liance to the I lealth Careers Oppor
tunity Program that COE uses to
reach out to undergraduate pre
meds.
But its programs are not all that
matter.
"Many of us believe, and I partic
ularly do so. that the COE has creat
ed a sense of community — a family
so to say — within our school that is
a very important for many minority
students," said third-year student
Bruno Chazaro.
With underrepresented minori
ties comprising about 20 percent of
the school, the proportion of Stan
ford medical students from tradition
ally underrepresented communities
is higher than many other institu
tions, hut it is still far from being pro
portionally representative of the na
tional population at large.

cluding Stanford's. But in his most re
cent budget plan. President Bush pro
posed no funding for COEs for the
current year, which began on Oct. 1.

"There have been no new dollars
from the federal government." Garcia
said.
The budget is still under consider
ation by Congress, which is currently
working on stopgap budgetary meas
ures to forestall a shutdown of the
federal government.
In a recent trip to Washington.
Garcia met with aides for Sen. Bar
bara Boxer (D -CA) and Rep. Nancy
Pelosi (D-CA).
"From my conversations, my sense
is that we are in a transition period,
since the Democratic Congress is tak
ing shape right now." he said. "1 am
hopeful that there will be some action
on the 2(X)7 budget, but I am not sure
that that is going to happen."
According to Garcia, the COE has

promoted diversity through a variety
of means since its inception at Stan
ford. "Pipeline programs," for exam
ple, target young students — from
middle schools to community colleges
— to encourage more underrepre
sented and disadvantaged students to
consider careers in medicine.
But the lack of federal funding has
made such outreach unsustainable.
Programs for middle school and high
school students have already been
cut. while community college out
reach — once national — has been
narrowed to just the Bay Area.
The COE also maintains an early
matriculation program designed "to
jumpstart careers in leadership in
medicine," in addition to providing
tutorial services, offering student
counseling, sponsoring research and
promoting cultural awareness, Gar
cia said.
Its efforts are not solely directed at
students either. Another main objec
tive of the COE is to encourage the
development and retention of minor
ity faculty members. In turn, these
professors serve as role models for
minority students.
Since federal funding was cut in
September, the Medical School
Dean's office has provided extra
funding to keep the COE afloat. In
the meantime, COE officials say they
are looking at other, more perma
nent sources of funding, including
private foundations, individual
donors and state philanthropic or
ganizations.
"We have looked at primary core
programs and funding to keep that
going for the next couple of years,"
said Dr. Fernando Mendoza, who is
the principal investigator at the
COE.
As far as federal monetary
sources to promote a more diverse
student body goes, however, there
are few other options.
"The COEs were the prime

groups that got funding for this." he
said. "They were the most systematic
approach."
Losing the COE and its programs
would be a blow not only to the ad
ministration's efforts to promote di-,
versitv. but also to minority students
who credit the COE for playing a
crucial role.
"'lTie COE at Stanford Medical
School has been invaluable to me."
said Kimberly Montez. who is co
president of the Latino Medical Stu
dent Association. "These funding
cuts will result in a decrease in the
number of minority students admit
ted to medical school and ultimately
fewer persons with less access to cul
turally skilled physicians.
"Our chapter of the Latino Med
ical Student Association has teamed
up with other chapters throughout
California, Arizona, Oregon and
Washington and Dr. Bob Montoya to
petition Congress to restore funding
for COE," she added. The group h;is
already submitted a petition with 120
signatures from the roughly 170 stu
dents who make up the first and sec
ond-year classes at the medical
school.
A request for student opinions on
the COE met with an overwhelming
show of support, with most students
praising specific programs — rang
ing from COE's support for a sum
mer program hosted by the Stanford
University Minority Medical Al
liance to the I lealth Careers Oppor
tunity Program that COE uses to
reach out to undergraduate pre
meds.
But its programs are not all that
matter.
"Many of us believe, and I partic
ularly do so. that the COE has creat
ed a sense of community — a family
so to say — within our school that is
a very important for many minority
students," said third-year student
Bruno Chazaro.
With underrepresented minori
ties comprising about 20 percent of
the school, the proportion of Stan
ford medical students from tradition
ally underrepresented communities
is higher than many other institu
tions, hut it is still far from being pro
portionally representative of the na
tional population at large.
Fourth-year medical student Ri
cardo Paniagua still remembers the
first time he met Dr. Ron Garcia, pro
gram director of the Medical School's
diversity-promoting Center for Ex
cellence.
"How?" he remembers Garcia
asking during the admissions inter
view. "How did you arrive at the point
in your life in which applying to med
ical school was even an option?"
Paniagua — who had not applied
as a disadvantaged student despite
growing up in a single-wide trailer in
rural northern California and attend
ing a high school where only ten per
cent of the graduating class attended
college — was intrigued. Other inter
viewers had asked him the generic
drill of why he wanted a career in
medicine and what he hoped to ac
complish, but it was the first time any
one had cared to ask him "how" —
how he had even gotten onto the
track to becoming a doctor.
It was then, he says now, that here

alized that Stanford's School of Med
icine was different than others. And it
was then that he knew that Stanford
was where he belonged.
But stories like Paniagua's — al
ready rare — might become even less
common if federal funding for Cen
ters of Excellence (COEs) at medical
schools around the country' is not re
stored soon. One of the main adminis
trative offices for promoting diversity,
the COE may be in financial jeopardy
if the final funding decision does not
weigh in its favor soon.
