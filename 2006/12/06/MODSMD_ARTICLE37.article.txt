## Bike ticket nabs senior 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
How does a $10 ticket for biking
without a light turn into a $600 fine,a
court date, and an arrest warrant?
Senior Aditya Singh found out last
month.
Singh was driving back from din
ner in Palo Alto with some friends
Nov. 24 when he rolled through a
stop sign at the intersection of Santa
Teresa St.and Lomita Dr.
When Singh was pulled over, the
police officer looked up his record
and told him that there was an arrest
warrant issued in his name for a tick
et issued fall quarter of his sopho
more year.
Singh said that after the police of
ficer called for additional officers for
backup, she had him get out of the car
and put his hands behind his head.
"She dragged me to her police car
and basically pushed me against the
car, and she took my hands and told
me exactly how she wanted them,"
he said. "She was just roughing me
up."
Confused, scared, and nervous,
with images of the recent tasering at
UCLA running through his mind,
Singh said the officer searched his
pockets and asked if he had drugs or
weapons until the officer realized he
was not a threat.
"I've never been pulled over be
fore," he said. "I'm from India,so I've
never really driven here before. In
India, when somebody pulls you
over, it's not intimidating. It's usually
like a casual conversation."
Singh said he received a $10 fine
around a year ago for biking without
a bike light and mailed in a check,
which was apparently not received.
Staying in India last winter quarter,
he was unable to receive warnings at
Stanford through the mail. When he
did not reply, he was given a court
date. His failure to appear led to the
arrest warrant that he learnt of just

last week.
When Singh returned to Stanford
in the spring, he changed his post of
fice box, and therefore had no way of
getting any of his winter quarter
mail.
Singh has been given a court date
in January to dispute the $b(X) fine,
and if he fails to appear this time, he
will be arrested.The arrest would go
on his permanent record.
Singh said being unaware of a
warrant for his arrest for the past two
years scared him the most, adding
that he could have been caught any
where, and under much worse cir
cumstances.
"I got my drivers' license last
year, so 1 was thinking that before is
suing my license they would check
my license and tell me about [the
warrant]." he said. "If they had at
least warned me that 1 had this viola
tion pending against me, 1 could have
taken care of it."
Stanford Police Deputy Victor
Lee said that a citation for biking
without a light is like any other tick
et. If it remains unpaid after the re
ceipt of a courtesy notice, the matter
moves from the purview of the po
lice to the traffic court, which issues
arrest warrants.
"We do run across people who
have warrants and don't know about
them," Lee said. "It's not our obliga
tion to tell people [about their war
rant]; usually the court does."
Singh said the Stanford police
were "as nice as they could be."
"But," he added, "they still have
to follow protocol â€” the whole get
ting out of the car, roughing me up a
bit, making sure I don't have
weapons. For me that was extreme,
but for them it's a standard proce
dure."
The police did not know what
Singh's arrest warrant was for until
he had gotten out of the car.
