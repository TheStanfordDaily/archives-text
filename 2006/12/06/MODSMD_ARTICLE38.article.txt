## Panel says Republicans feast on polarization But panelists add that Rove-style politics fails 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Could America he any more polar
ized? Yes, we could be fighting a civil
war.
"We're not on the battlefields yet,"
said Gary Jacobson, a political science
professor at the University of Califor
nia. San Diego.
One month to the day after De
mocrats won sweeping gains in the
midterm elections, three prominent
political observers pondered the caus
es and intensity of America's political
polarization in a half-filled Cubberley
Auditorium last night.
Jacobson argued that President
Bush has been the most divisive presi
dent in the 70 years that public opin
ion polls have been conducted.
"If not polarized." he said,"we are
certainly sharply divided by party on
the current leadership of our country."
Prior to Bush. Jacobson said, the
lowest approval rating any president
ever received from voters in the oppo
sition party was 1 1 percent for
Richard Nixon just before he re
signed. But the current president has
had ratings as low as 4 percent among
Democrats.
Bill Clinton won election in 1992
and 1 9% by "triangulating," a strategy
that relied on centrist and independ
ent voters to win a plurality of votes.
Karl Rove, the president's chief politi
cal tactician, built George W. Bush's
2(HX) and 2(X)4 campaigns by firing up
the party's base of evangelical and
conservative voters. The Democratic
romp in last month's elections, the
panelists said, at least somewhat inval
idated this strategy.
"The problem with Rove's brand
of politics is that it leaves no margin
for error," said John I larris, formerly

the national politics editor of the
Washington Post, who argued that this
strategy is not a '"promising model tor
long-term success."
I larris said Rove believes the elec
torate is deeply divided while Clinton
thinks it is not and that Republicans
have played up unresolved disagree
ments to win votes.
But 1 loover Senior Fellow and Po
litical Science Prof. Morris Fiorina said
there is little evidence that Americans
are getting more polarized, lie cited
Gallup polls which show more self-de
scribed moderates now than in the
19705.
"Certainly, Americans have politi
cal differences, but the differences be
tween ordinary citizens are far smaller
than between the elites," he said. "It's
not so much people's underlying posi
tions. It's their attitude toward what's
being done."
Through a process of self-selection,
he said, people have ended up in the
party that most closely matches then
ideology. At the same time, talk radio
and blogs have helped to push candi
dates to move to extremes.
"1 think Karl Rove got Bush re
elected in 2(X)4 in spite of himself." he
said."ln a time of peace and prosper
ity. Bush won narrowly in 20(K). I
think that should have been a lesson
that there was a lot of appeal in his
compassionate conservatism. In
stead. I think they took the wrong les
son from it."
Harris described a political world
where "people are on separate sides
and even separate factual universe?*."
"Increasingly, there's a dysfunc
tional element to politics," he said.
"You can't have an authentic debate
when there are not agreed-upon
facts."
Rich Lowry, editor of the conserva
tive National Review, was supposed to
be on the panel. Lowry, however, ce 1 -
cently suffered a concussion, not from
a political fight in Washington, but by
playing ice hockey without a helmet.
