### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling took part in
the Las Vegas Invitational Friday
and Saturday, competing against a
field that led coach Kerry McCoy to
call the event "one of the top tourna
ments in the country." According to
the second year Cardinal coach, the
team's chief goals in Las Vegas would
be to advance as many wrestlers to
the second day of competition as
possible and improve on last year's
showing.
The Cardinal proved to be only
moderately successful in achieving
their aims, as the squad advanced
three wrestlers—junior All Ameri
can Tanner Gardner at 125 pounds,
sophomore Rafael Chavez at 141
pounds and junior Josh Zupancic at
157 pounds — to the second day of
the tournament, with Zupancic even

tually placing seventh and Gardner
lourth. Chavez came within one
match of placing, losing an 8-3 deci
sion to Michael Keefe of Tennessee
C hattanooga after pinning three op
ponents on the first day of competi
tion. Last year's squad advanced
only two wrestlers to the second day
of competition, with only Tanner
Gardner placing.
Gardner's fourth place finish
matched his 2005 results in Las
Vegas.The All American lost his first
non-exhibition match of the season
when Angel Escobedo of Indiana
won a 4-2 overtime decision over the
Cardinal standout. But Gardner re
bounded with a 7-2 win over Mark
Moos of Michigan, before being
pinned by Matt Eveleth of Pennsyl
vania at 2:35 to close out his second
day of competition. Gardner's only
other loss of the season came in an
All-Star match against No. 1 Sam
I lazewinkel of Oklahoma.
Zupancic's seventh-place finish
continues the junior's strong early
season run. Zupancic entered Fri
day's competition coming off of a

first-place finish at the Fullerton
Open. After a 6-1 loss to top-seeded
Brian Stith of Arizona State on Fri
day, Zupancic moved into the second
day of competition wrestling in the
consolation bracket. He went 2-1 on
Saturday to earn his seventh place
finish.
The Cardinal will next compete

when they return to Nevada to for
the RenoTournament of Champions
on Dec. 20.Then, the squad will split,
as some wrestlers will take part in the
Midlands tournament in Evanston.
111. while others will see action at the
Southern Scuffle in Greensboro, NC.
