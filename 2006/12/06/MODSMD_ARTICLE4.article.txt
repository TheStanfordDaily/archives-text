# HARRIS GETS THE AXE
## Football head coach out after 6-17 record in two years at the helm 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby announced Monday
that head football coach Walt Harris would not be re
turning after just two seasons at the helm of the pro
gram.
Bowlsby made the official announcement immedi
ately after meeting with I larris early Monday morning.
The Athletic Director cited the team's lack of develop
ment over the last two seasons as the pi imary i eason lor
the split.
"I have made the decision after consulting with a
wide number of people that the time is right to make a
change in our football leadership," Bowlsby said. "I
have appreciated my relationship with Walt I larris and
his staff and have appreciated all their hard work. This
was a tough year, but in some respect this decision was
n't made as a result of being 1-11 as much as it was a re
sult of us not seeing the kind of critical progress that we
would have hoped for in two years."
Harris led the Cardinal to a 6-17 record in his two
seasons on The Farm — a brief tenure characterized by
disappointing defeats. After falling one win short ol a
bowl berth in 2005 with a 5-6 record, the Cardinal were
among the worst teams in the nation in 2006.The squad
suffered losses to both San Jose State and Division l-
AA UC-Davis in the past two seasons and. perhaps
more importantly, were 0-2 against UC-Berkeley under

Harris.
Injuries were a major factor in the Cardinal's strug
gles throughout the 2006 season. Receivers Mark Brad
ford and Evan Moore spent most of season out with foot
injuries. Fullback Nick Frank was forced to retire from
football due to narrowing vertebrae in his spine and sen
ior quarterback Front Edwards missed the last five

games of the season with a broken bone in
his foot.
"There were things that were not of
Walt's making that he didn't have a whole
lot of control over," Bowlsby said. "But in
the end it was my belief that we ought to
start fresh to do all the big things and all the
small things that it takes to return Stanford
football to its appropriate position of com
petitiveness."
Waning support from fans and boosters
may have also doomed Harris.The new, $90
million Stanford Stadium was mostly
empty throughout the season as many fans
displayed their disappointment with the
program by not using their tickets.
"People vote with their pocketbooks
and tney vote with their feet," Bowlsby
said. "The last game against Oregon State,
we probably had 12,000 people in the
stands. Fortunately we did sell 34,(KK) tick
ets. One has to wonder those people that
had $45 tickets and didn't care to come to
the game will want to buy them again next
year.To be honest, I have to say that declin
ing attendance and fan support certainly
were a factor in this decision."
Harris has three more years left on his
original five-year contract. Bowlsby said
that he was still in negotiations with I larris
to put together fair terms of separation. All
assistant coaches are under contract until
June 30, 2007 and their contracts will be
honored.
Former Athletic Director Ted Leland
hired Harris in 2(X)5, following a lengthy
search process after the firing of former
coach Buddy Teevens. Prior to heading up
the Cardinal, Harris spent eight seasons
with Pittsburgh, where he led the Panthers
to six bowl games, including the Fiesta Bowl
in 2004. But he failed to duplicate that same
level of success in the short time that he
spent at Stanford.
"I'd like to thank Stanford University
for the opportunity to come back home and

coach at Stanford," I larris said."Regretful
ly. 1 leave with a heavy heart, because we
didn't get the job done. I wish the Stanford
players and the program the best of luck as
they rebuild."
Bowlsby met with the current players
immediately following the announcement
to outline what he was looking for in a new
coach. I le highlighted strong recruiting and
the ability to take advantage of Stanford's
unique situation as musts for a new coach.
"We need a person that is a relentless re
cruiter," Bowlsby said. "All our coaches in
all our sports are assigned with the same
task — they have to find the student athlete
from all over the country that is academi
cally capable of benefiting from a Stanford
education and athletically gifted enough to
play in a top program. We need someone
that goes out and does that enthusiastically
and can do that so we can compete in the
Pac-10."
"This is a unique place," junior quarter
back T.C. Ostrander said."We need a coach
that is going to embrace that. There is no
way that they can fight what makes this pro
gram different and still be successful."
Bowlsby refused to name any possible
replacements for Harris, but he did empha
size that the process would move quickly.
"We are going about the process of
identifying candidates," Bowlsby said.
"Every athletic director has a short list in
their back pocket, and I have mine. 1 am
not prepared to share at this point, but we
are going about the process so 1 would
hope to be all done with the search in
about two weeks."
Bowlsby said he will personally meet
with any current recruits who wish to speak
with him about the situation.
"No one will ever say that Coach Harris
didn't want to win or succeed." senior re
ceiver Evan Moore said."But we have to do
what is best for the program and get over it.
move on and keep working."
