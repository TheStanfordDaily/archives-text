# Mooch is the man for the job

While some Stanford students
may have been more out
raged at the University's re
fusal to allow the Stanford "Banned"
to put on their traditional halftime en
tertainment extravaganza, it's now
clear that Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby had bigger issues on his mind
as he watched the team find yet anoth
er way to lose.
This time.they kept it close,but that
wasn't enough to save Walt Harris's
job.
Indeed. Bowlsby had probably
more or less made up his mind by mid
season that 1 larris had to go. As 1 wrote
last week, the only thing that could
have definitely given him at least an
other year to turn the program around
would have been a miraculous Big
Game win. And when that didn't hap
pen. Bowlsby wasted no time. Stan
ford's AD met with his football coach
at 9:00 a.m. Monday morning, fired
him before 10 and had press releases
drafted by 11.
Although Harris' departure may

prove yet another setback for a pro
gram that has had too many in recent
ycars.it has not been much lamented in
any corner of the Stanford world.That
defensive standout and team leader
Michael Okwo briefly quit the team
prior to the Washington game speaks
volumes.
But the firing squad has done its
work now. and it's time to put the Walt
I larris era firmly in the rear-view mir
ror. The question now is who Stanford
should hire to replace him.
And there is no doubt in my mind
that former Cal and NFL coach Steve
Mariucci is the right man for the job.
Mariucci. who has most recently

tHiii!' the Cardinal could want and
iuoic. lie's more of a player's coach
than I larris. but more of a disciplinari
an than Teevens. Moreover, his experi
tce in the NFL would give him the
ibility to scheme with the best coach
in the Pac-10 (i.e. Jett Tedford and
Pete Carroll), while his grounding in
lie West Coast Offense firmly ties him
the Bill Walsh coaching tree and to
the Farm.
I kit most importantly. Mariucci is
the kind of name that Stanford needs
tight now. this very instant. If the squad
doesn't rebound within the next few
years, memories of Stanford ever
iving a competitive institution in Pac-
I4( football will fade, and rebuilding
\sll become that much more difficult.
Really, the single most important
it tribute of any got >d Stanford coach is
his ability to recruit with a high rate of
success. Simply put. if the prospective
high school talent pool for the Cardi
nal iv shallow because of academic re
ictions. Stanford needs to be able to
kind a big percentage of the guys they
di > go after.
\nd with "Mooch" on board, the
program's recruiting power would in
crease exponentially. Stanford would
instantly make not just a gigantic local
splash, but a national one, as Mariucci
lins always been a media favorite. I lis is
the kind of name that people want to
play tor. especially the quarterbacks
md receivers Stanford has been fa
mous for producing throughout its his
tory. Iliis is the man who developed
Brett l avre in Green Bay and coached
Steve Young and Jerry Rice in San
1 rancisco. With a resume like that, re
cruits would be banging on Stanford's
door with dreams of NI L dollars in
their heads. And Bowlsby should be
ban gin g on M a ri ucci's door th is very in -
stent.
. Ihe advantages of hiring Mariucci
ue literally so numerous that I could
n't possibly fit them all into the space I
have here. From his recruiting power
to his advocacy for the kind of athletic
and technically skilled offensive line
men that Stanford should have an eas
ier time finding, Mariucci certainly ap
pears to be the best possible lit for the
Cardinal. Better still, the Cardinal
might be the best possible fit for Mari
ucci. who sold his home in Michigan to
tyove back to the Bay Area.
But would the University go after
tyinV.'The question,ludicrous though it
appears on the surface, is a definite
concern. In the past. University high
er-ups have tried to make do on the
cheap, hiring the low-cost coach to re
assure themselves that Stanford is, first
and foremost.an academic institution.
Of course, being cheap doesn't ac
tually make you smarter. It just makes
you cheap.
It's time for the University to re
assess the facts of their situation,
lhev've just built a new stadium for
over $90 million, only to see it stand
mostly empty for its inaugural season.
If Stanford brass wants a return on
their investment — and if the Univer
sity wants more money from the
boosters who helped fund the stadium
they'll shell out a little extra to get a
proven coach who can turn the pro
gram around quickly. A good football
coach is an investment, not an expen
diture. A solid program will earn
money lor a University, not waste it.
In my experience, it's rare that such
i perfect match of coach and team
< »mes along. You need look no further
than the fact that a Mariucci hiring
would be the one thing that would
make the Pac-10 sit up and take notice.
It might even give some folks in

Berkeley a genuine moment of disqui
et to see the coach who once led the
Bears to the Aloha Bowl wearing the
colors of their arch-rivals.
And besides, 49er fans everywhere
can tell you that the man looks good in
