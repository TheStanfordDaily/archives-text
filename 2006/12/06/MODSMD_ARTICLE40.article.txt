# Mooch is the man for the job

While some Stanford students
may have been more out
raged at the University's re
fusal to allow the Stanford "Banned"
to put on their traditional halftime en
tertainment extravaganza, it's now
clear that Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby had bigger issues on his mind
as he watched the team find yet anoth
er way to lose.
This time.they kept it close,but that
wasn't enough to save Walt Harris's
job.
Indeed. Bowlsby had probably
more or less made up his mind by mid
season that 1 larris had to go. As 1 wrote
last week, the only thing that could
have definitely given him at least an
other year to turn the program around
would have been a miraculous Big
Game win. And when that didn't hap
pen. Bowlsby wasted no time. Stan
ford's AD met with his football coach
at 9:00 a.m. Monday morning, fired
him before 10 and had press releases
drafted by 11.
Although Harris' departure may

prove yet another setback for a pro
gram that has had too many in recent
ycars.it has not been much lamented in
any corner of the Stanford world.That
defensive standout and team leader
Michael Okwo briefly quit the team
prior to the Washington game speaks
volumes.
But the firing squad has done its
work now. and it's time to put the Walt
I larris era firmly in the rear-view mir
ror. The question now is who Stanford
should hire to replace him.
And there is no doubt in my mind
that former Cal and NFL coach Steve
Mariucci is the right man for the job.
