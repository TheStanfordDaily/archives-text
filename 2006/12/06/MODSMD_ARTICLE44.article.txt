## STUDENTS MAR BUSH CAMPUS VISIT Hundred student and community protestors force Bush to change Hoover meeting location 
### AMU ARORA DESK EDITOR 
Although President George W. Bush
was scheduled to meet with fellows at the
1 ioover Institution on Friday, the pres
ence of more than 1.000 protestors
forced him to change his plans and meet
with advisers and faculty members at the
residence of former Secretary of State
and Hoover Fellow George Shultz on
the outskiits of the Stanford campus.
More than 1(X) armed law enforce
ment and Secret Service officers lined
the streets outside of Encina Commons,
as students, parents, faculty members
and local residents protested Bush's an
ticipated arrival on east campus, While
the protest was peaceful, three Stanford
students - seniors Claire Wagenseil.
Diogo Pereira and Caroline Martin -
were arrested as police pushed the
crowd out of Serra Street.
All three students were charged with
two misdemeanors: failure to yield to a
vehicle in a roadway:and resisting.delay
ing and obstructing a peace officer. One
of the students was also charged with
battery,according to Sgt. I lilary Karp of
the Stanford Department of Public Safe
ty. The three were cited at the police sta
tion and released later that day. 1 hey will
appear in Palo Alto Court to answer
these charges within the next several
weeks
The protest began at approximately 2
p.m. in White Plaza, where 2(X) students
gathered to make signs and rally against
the administration. As they began
marching toward Hoover Tower, others
joined their ranks and began tochant slo
gans. By the time the rally reached the In
stitution at 2:30 p.m.. approximately 4<X>
protesters lined the police barriers set
around the building.
People continued to join the move
ment. and the slogans for reform grew
louder as time passed. I he magnitude of
the protest ultimately forced Bush to
conduct the meeting at Shultz s house lo
cated on Delores Street.
Meanwhile,outside the I loover Insti
tution, the crowd chanted, "Hey-Hey
-110-Ho-Bush is here, he's got to go." An
other popular slogan targeted the con
flict in Iraq, as students yelled." 1 -2-3-4-
We don't want your fuckin' war-5-6-7-8-
Stop the killing. Stop the hate."
As the protest grew knider, the Sher
iffs Department attempted to clear the
street to provide the president's motor
cade a safe entrance into the complex.
When the students refused to obey these
verbal commands, more than 50 police
officers in full riot gear were called to the
scene. Dressed in protective helmets, the

officers used their batons to push indi
viduals back from the Tower.
In response to the use of physical
force, students directed their chants at
the perceived infringement of their
rights.
"Whose campus - Our campus.
Whose streets - our streets," they yelled.
"Tell me what democracy kx)ks like - this
is what democracy looks like."
Ihe struggle between the Sheriffs
Department and protesters reached its
climax when a lire truck attempted to
drive down the street and was blocked
by the crowd. Security personnel were
attempting to move those blocking the
truck when three Stanford students sat
down and refused to move.
Officers dragged them out of the
road and bound their hands with plastic
ties. I hough others demanded that their
peers be released, after 15 minutes, the
three students were placed into a Sher
iffs Department vehicle and taken away.
The fire truck then reversed and did not
proceed down the street.
Sophomore Nicole Wires described
the tire truck as a ploy used by the police.
"They brought a tire truck here be
cause they wanted to move us out of the
streets,and they knew that they could ar
rest us if we didn't move," she said. "We
didn't hear any sirens anywhere after the
truck reversed. It didn't take another
route. It's absurd."
In an interview with Hie Daily.
Pereira gave an account of his arrest.
"After being picked up off the
ground, I was dragged and handcuffed
with my pants down." he said. "The offi
cer pushed me on to the ground and
wrote 14<S on my leg with a black mark
er. I asked what 148 stix >d for and he said
resisting arrest."
Mocking the administration, about
an hour later, members of the San Fran
cisco-based Global Exchange Group
drove a I lummer toward the police bar
rier closing off Serra from Galvez. Using
a speakerphone and donning masks of
Bush and Secretary of State Condoleez
za Rice, they parodied Bush's foreign
policy and the level of security on cam
pus.
In its own investigation. The Daily
discovered that the Hoover fellows,
along with University President John
Hennessy, who had planned to meet
with Bush, were driven from the com
plex to Shultz's private residence. At ap
proximately 4:30 p.m.. Bush arrived at
the house on Delores. He departed cam
pus at around 7:20 p.m. bound for St. I ie
iena. north of the Bay Area.
Before the fellows and I lennessy
were driven to the meeting, they gath

ered in front of the complex, seemingly
to greet the President's motorcade. With
this delegation in plain view, several pro
testors began shtmting obscenities at the
small group and criticizing them for their
support of Bush's platform.
Based on this.it appears that even the
I ioover fellows invited to the meeting
were not aware that the location of the
president's visit had been changed.
A n umber of pre testers cited specific
complaints with the current administra
tion.calling attention to these issues with
colorful signs and popular slogans. Some
wore stickers with the message "We all
deserve the freedom to marry," while
others held signs stating "No one died
when Clinton lied,""Show me freedom!
Protect my rights to my body" and "Save
Darfur."
With hundreds of prospective fresh
men and their families on campus for the

weekend, the movement seemed to
draw support from onlookers. Several of
these prospective freshmen participated
in the movement. Parents took photos
and applauded the protestors as they
proceeded down Lasuen Mall.
Some students, like incoming fresh
man Alejandra Aponte. said they were
surprised by the protest's high turnout.
"I thought Stanford was really a bub
ble, but seeing all the people that are out
here has shown me that people really are
concerned," she said. "I'm Latina: I'm
from Guatemala. Right now President
Bush is doing some very interesting
things in Latin America. We have a
phrase For every pig, there will be a Sat
urday.' Basically, his game is over."
iiiough the protest was not formally
organized by any one group, residents of
Columbae and members of Students
Taking Action Now: Darfur (S TAND).

the Student Action Coalition
(SLAC) and Amnesty International
were active in the demonstration. The
Stanford Marching Band also per
formed in front of the Hoover Institution
and entertained protestors with music
and antics.
Co-terminal student and Columbae
resident Tim Telleen-Lawton described
his efforts to organize the event.
"A group of us sat down together last
night at Columbae and we just started
dealing with the details." he said."We or
ganized a time, and Columbae funds
helped pa> r for some of our supplies.
There are approximately I.(XX) people
around and more than half of them are
protesting.This is a great success."
In addition to students on campus,
adults from Palo Alto participated in the
movement outside the I ioover complex.
Bernice Fischer, a member of the Raging

Grannies, a group of senior citizens that
regularly protest |">olitical issues in the
local area, described her excitement.
"I'm glad to see all the students out
here,"she said."l'm in the Peace and Jus
tice league and the Women's Interna
tional League for Peace and Freedom,
and we haven't had very many students
work with us before. We've been protest
ing even before Bush entered Iraq."
Carol Brouillet.aGreen Party candi
date for Congress, even brought a 15-
foot-tall cardboard cutout of the Statue
of Liberty with a sack over its head. In
imitation of the famous photograph of
human rights violations at the Abu
Ghraib prison in Iraq, the sign symbol
ized the atrocities perpetrated by the
United States overseas.

Riot police and firefighters attempt to dislodge protestors from the intersection of Serra St.and Galvez St. with a fire truck. Three students were arrested for re
fusing to make way for the truck, but the protests forced Bush to meet with Hoover fellows at a former Secretary of State George Schultz's campus home.
