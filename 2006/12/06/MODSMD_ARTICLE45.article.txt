## Dems storm to power in Congress 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
A tide of dissatisfaction with the president and the war in
Iraq helped give Democrats a majority in the House of Repre
sentatives, an apparent shot at control of the Senate and a strong
majority of governor's offices around the nation. The returns,
which came late into the night, seemed to additionally embold
en campus progressives with hope that Tuesday's election was
the beginning of the end of the era of Republican dominance.
As of publication time, the Democrats appear to have picked
up 24 seats in the House - 15 were needed for a majority. In the
Senate, they gained four seats, with Senate races in Montana and
Virginia showing narrow margins for Democratic candidates. If
Democrats win both races, they will control the Senate with a 51-
49 majority.
In rooms and lounges around campus, left-leaning students
ushered in the Democratic victory with a celebration befitting
New Years. In the Slavinskii Dom row house, a contingent of
loyal Democrats shotgunned cheap beers after the networks de
clared Democrats victorious in their quest to take the House.
Champagne bottles were uncorked as student-revelers
screamed heartily from dorm lounges and group meeting rooms.
"There's a lot to be excited about," said Bobby Lepore, the
president of the Stanford Democrats. "This will show people
that there are a lot of Americans who care about progressive
values. This will show we're not dead because we lost a couple
nail biters for a couple of years. People are excited that this can
bring a lot of change in Washington."
Students funneled into three polling places on and adjacent
to campus Tliesday, with several hundred others casting absen
tee ballots in their home states. Campus Democrat Dorm Cap
tains tried to pump up turnout by reaching out to unregistered
voters. Other students worked as volunteers at polling places.
At election sites, in more than a dozen interviews, the nor
mally apathetic community expressed excitement about the
prospect of a change in the balance of power.
"Maybe the rest of the country could look more like Califor
nia," said Frank Vigil, happy at the fulfillment of his prediction
that Democrats would regain control of the House.
Adrian Pavon. 19. cast his first ballot TUesday. He said there
was a lot of energy surrounding the election.


Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) celebrates the Democratic victory in Washington late Tuesday night. With the
win, Pelosi is poised to become the first female Speaker of the House.
"There was a friendly atmos
phere around campus," he said.
"People were asking each other
about who they were going to vote
for. There was a lot of interaction."
Campus conservatives were
quiet and resigned to the losses
across the nation. Around 10 p.m., a
few held out hope that Republicans
could control two of four U.S. Sen
ate seats in play, with about half a
dozen Republican supporters re
maining in a Larkin room where the
club had gathered to watch returns.
"We're obviously disappointed,"
said Megan Reiss, the president of
the Stanford College Republicans.
"At this point in the night, we're still
optimistic about retaining the Sen
ate."
DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY
WILL BE CONSTRAINED
As results came in. campus lead
ers already began thinking about
what the new Democratic House
might look like and what its agenda
might be. In 1994, the Republicans
under Speaker Newt Gingrich em
barked on an aggressive agenda
dubbed "The Contract with Ameri
ca." With Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San
Francisco) poised to become
Speaker of the House, some stu
dents expressed high hopes that the
takeover could mean new policy.
But University experts cau
tioned the idealistic to be cautious,
warning that partisan rancor will
likely increase with divided govern
ment.
"It clearly brings to an end this
era of Republican domination,
which means there will be a slow
down in the ability of the party to
accomplish its policy agendas," said
Political Science and Communica
tions Prof. Jon Krosnick. "At the
same time, unfortunately, there's
now going to be an increase in par
tisan conflict.
"The Republicans haven't been
used to cooperating and they're
now going to be forced to in this
new environment." he added. "The
Democrats have been really frus
trated for quite some time. I suspect
they're going to try to make up for
lost time."

Political Science Prof. Larry Dia
mond, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution and specialist on foreign
policy, predicted that the Democ
rats would have more of a psycho
logical than political impact on the
way business is done in Washington.
Congress has a "very limited num
ber of levers besides complaint and
investigation to induce a change in
our policy," he said.
"It's extremely unlikely that the
Congress in the next two years is
going to cut off funding or deny the
funding the president says he needs
because it would be seen as betray
ing our troops."
Diamond said the change will
force Democrats to adopt a plan for
how to improve the situation in
Iraq, rather than simply criticizing
the president for not doing a good
enough job.
"The Democrats face a bit of a
challenge on whether they can rally
behind some kind of alternative
strategy," he said. "The president
holds the cards. I very much doubt
that the Democrats will have the
nerve and, some might say, the im
prudence to use the blunt instru
ment of trying to deny funding to
change our policy."
CALIFORNIA INSULATED
FROM TIDE
Reiss said that the success of Cal
ifornia Republicans gave her mem
bers some cause to celebrate. Gov
ernor Arnold Schwarzenegger de
feated state treasurer Phil An
gelides by over a million votes, lead
ing a tide of GOP candidates that
outperformed expectations in
down-ticket races.
Republican Steve Poizner, a Sili
con Valley billionaire, defeated two
term Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante in
the race for insurance commission
er, a setback for state Democrats.
With 60 percent of precincts report
ing, Democratic Insurance Com
missioner John Garamendi took a
slim lead in the race for lieutenant
governor over state Sen. Tom Mc-
Clintock. an anti-tax conservative
from Thousand Oaks. Incumbent
Secretary of State Bruce McPher
son. a Republican former state leg
islator appointed by Schwarzeneg
ger last year, had 47 percent of the
vote in a tight race against Democ
ratic state Sen. Debra Bowen.
Bill Whalen. a research fellow at
the Hoover Institution who special

izes on identifying political trends,
said Angelides' inability to fire up
his base probably hurt Democratic
turnout and helped Republicans in
the other statewide elections.
"Democrats were not charged by
his candidacy," he said. "They didn't
come out in the numbers you nor
mally expect Democrats to turn out.
It had a much more chilling effect
down the ticket."
Whalen also attributed the insu
lation of California was somewhat
insulated from the national trend of
Democratic wins to the gerryman
dering of the congressional districts.
One of two California Republi
cans linked to the Jack Abramoff
lobbying scandal was fighting for
survival. Rep. Richard Pombo, the
chairman of the House Resources
Committee, fell by 9,000 votes to
Democrat Jerry McNerney. a 53-
year-old wind-energy engineer who
holds a doctorate in mathematics. In
contrast. Republican Rep. John
Doolittle defeated Democrat Char
lie Brown, a retired Air Force offi
cer and decorated war veteran.
The reason for the difference.
Whalen said, is that Doolittle's dis
trict has 15 percent more registered
Republicans than Democrats. In the
California 11th District, Pombo's
advantage is only six percent.
Lepore of the Stanford Democ
rats said that his members had been
watching Pombo's race closely. En
vironmental groups had targeted
Pombo, and the Stanford Democ
rats committed volunteers to McN
erney's campaign.
Krosnick cautioned not to read
too much into the meaning of the
shift. He said that there had not
been a gigantic transformation in
American feelings or attitudes. The
nation remains closely divided po
litically. he added.
The newly elected Democrats
are more moderate than the new
leadership, other observers said.
"A lot of the Democrats elected
tonight are not exactly Bay Area
Democrats by any means." said
Whalen. "They are in for a culture
shock when they get to Washington
and meet with their caucus for the
first time."

A tide of dissatisfaction with the president and the war in
Iraq helped give Democrats a majority in the House of Repre
sentatives, an apparent shot at control of the Senate and a strong
majority of governor's offices around the nation. The returns,
which came late into the night, seemed to additionally embold
en campus progressives with hope that Tuesday's election was
the beginning of the end of the era of Republican dominance.
As of publication time, the Democrats appear to have picked
up 24 seats in the House - 15 were needed for a majority. In the
Senate, they gained four seats, with Senate races in Montana and
Virginia showing narrow margins for Democratic candidates. If
Democrats win both races, they will control the Senate with a 51-
49 majority.
In rooms and lounges around campus, left-leaning students
ushered in the Democratic victory with a celebration befitting
New Years. In the Slavinskii Dom row house, a contingent of
loyal Democrats shotgunned cheap beers after the networks de

Campus conservatives were

DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY

dubbed "The Contract with Ameri
