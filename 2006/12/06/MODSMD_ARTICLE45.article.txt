## Dems storm to power in Congress 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
A tide of dissatisfaction with the president and the war in
Iraq helped give Democrats a majority in the House of Repre
sentatives, an apparent shot at control of the Senate and a strong
majority of governor's offices around the nation. The returns,
which came late into the night, seemed to additionally embold
en campus progressives with hope that Tuesday's election was
the beginning of the end of the era of Republican dominance.
As of publication time, the Democrats appear to have picked
up 24 seats in the House - 15 were needed for a majority. In the
Senate, they gained four seats, with Senate races in Montana and
Virginia showing narrow margins for Democratic candidates. If
Democrats win both races, they will control the Senate with a 51-
49 majority.
In rooms and lounges around campus, left-leaning students
ushered in the Democratic victory with a celebration befitting
New Years. In the Slavinskii Dom row house, a contingent of
loyal Democrats shotgunned cheap beers after the networks de
clared Democrats victorious in their quest to take the House.
Champagne bottles were uncorked as student-revelers
screamed heartily from dorm lounges and group meeting rooms.
"There's a lot to be excited about," said Bobby Lepore, the
president of the Stanford Democrats. "This will show people
that there are a lot of Americans who care about progressive
values. This will show we're not dead because we lost a couple
nail biters for a couple of years. People are excited that this can
bring a lot of change in Washington."
Students funneled into three polling places on and adjacent
to campus Tliesday, with several hundred others casting absen
tee ballots in their home states. Campus Democrat Dorm Cap
tains tried to pump up turnout by reaching out to unregistered
voters. Other students worked as volunteers at polling places.
At election sites, in more than a dozen interviews, the nor
mally apathetic community expressed excitement about the
prospect of a change in the balance of power.
"Maybe the rest of the country could look more like Califor
nia," said Frank Vigil, happy at the fulfillment of his prediction
that Democrats would regain control of the House.
Adrian Pavon. 19. cast his first ballot TUesday. He said there
was a lot of energy surrounding the election.
