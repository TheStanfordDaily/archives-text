### PATRICK FITZGERALD EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
In a sting operation involving a student wearing a wire
and a five-squad-car ambush, Stanford police arrested jun
ior Paul Larson on Friday for possession of cocaine and
other illicit drugs with the intent to sell.
According to eyewitnesses and police, the squad cars
pulled over the vehicle carrying Larson - who was hound
for LakeTahoe on the Enchanted Broccoli Forest ski trip -
at 4:05 p.m. on Campus Drive near Vaden 1 lealth Center. ,
During a subsequent search of the vehicle, officers found
marijuana and later obtained a warrant to search Larson's, ■
room in HBF.
rhere, police say they found cocaine, psilocybin - com
monly termed mushrooms - and more marijuana, as well as
implements to sell narcotics. I .arson was taken into custody
before his room was searched, and was booked into San
Jose Main Jail tor possession of a controlled substance and ,
paraphernalia and for possession of implements for the sale
of narcotics.
Sophomore Peter Zaffaroni, wh< > was driving by Vaden
when the suspect was handcuffed by police, characterized
Larson's facial expression as a "mixture of terror and fury."
An additional passenger in the vehicle was found in pos
session ot less than one ounce of marijuana, said Deputy
Ken Bates of the Stanford Department of Public Safety.
Ihe passenger, a junior, was taken to the station with Lar
son, cited and released shortly thereafter.
Hours after the arrest, police obtained a warrant and
raided Larson s EBF dorm room early Saturday morning,
seizing the illicit drugs and related property. Sources told,•
Ihe Daily that the amount ol cocaine found was roughly 15
grams. Officers had been staking out I -arson's dorm room
before obtaining the warrant, witness
es said.
Police also confiscated parapherna
lia and discovered evidence in the
room that strongly suggested Larson
was involved in selling the drugs. Bates
said.
Hie investigation began ITiurs
day, according to students familiar
with the incident after a junior was
hospitalized, having suffered a
seizure associated with cocaine use.
Police approached the student at the
hospital and convinced her to coop
erate in the investigation of Larson.
The student was then outfitted with
a wire and directed to buy more co
caine from Larson. In the course of
their conversation, police were able to
glean enough information to move for
ward. according to several sources.
When questioned about the use of a
wire in the investigation. Bates said he
could "neither confirm nor deny" such
reports.
Hie case is currently under review
by the Santa Clara County District At
torney's Office. Formal charges have
not yet been filed, and Larson's sen
tence depends on a host of different
factors, according to Bates.
This is not Larson's first run-in
with the law. In January 2(K)4. the
then-freshman was arrested and
charged for being a minor in posses
sion of alcohol, resisting arrest, giving
a false name and being drunk in pub
lic at a Branner party.
When contacted bv The Daily

about his recent arrest. Larson re
fused to comment.
Citing the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act, Vice Provost of
Student Affairs Greg Boardman said
he was unable to speak on the specifics
of the situation, but said that the case
will also be processed through Stan
ford Judicial Affairs.
'ITie incident was "not only an al
leged violation of the law, but also an
alleged violation of the Fundamental
Standard." Boardman said.
1 le also chose not to comment on
the University's specific role in the in
vestigation, but said,"Once we get a re
port that there has been the selling of il
legal drugs, we are obligated to report
it to the police."
Such arrests on campus are rare, he
stressed.
"We have zero tolerance for use of
illegal drugs on campus," Boardman
said. "This is not something that hap
pens on a frequent basis, certainly"
While marijuana use is not uncom
mon on campus, and the alleged 15
grams of cocaine recovered is not large
by most standards. Bates emphasized
that the implications of the incident
should not be lost on other campus res
idents.
" ITiis is serious stuff," he said. "Not
only is what this person was doing seri
ous and dangerous to him. but also to
his clients. People who supply this kind
of stuff have history of being violent,
not necessarily this seller, but perhaps
the person above him. And now his
supplier is introduced to Stanford,
which introduced a whole new crime
element into the community"
