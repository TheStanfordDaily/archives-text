## No end in sight for Band ban Band absent for 37-9 drubbing by Navy in stadium grand opening 
### JENNY ALLEN DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Midway through the fourth quarter of Saturday's
game, a cry arose from the student section. "This is our
house, this is our house," the crowd chanted louder and
louder. It was a memorable moment for the opening of
the new Stanford Stadium, or it would have been, that
is, if it had come from Stanford's student section.
The Band, placed on indefinite provisional status
last week, was not on the field during the Cardinal's
37-9 drubbing at the hands of the Midshipmen, with
predictable results: as the game began to turn in
Navy's favor, the Card might as well have been playing
in Annapolis. A few Bandies were in attendance,
dressed in street clothes but still donning their pin-en
crusted "lids," and The Tree, co-terminal student
Tommy Leep, was flashed on the Jumbotron. But with
an on-going investigation into mid-summer vandalism
of the Band Shak. the irreverent brass and drums fell
silent.
And so did the crowd.
"What's the point?" asked senior John Collins as he
stood up from his seat two minutes into the second
quarter and quietly left the stadium.
The rest of the Red Zone seemed to agree. The stu
dent section never got into the game, unimpressed
with Cardinal Competitive Cheer's pleas for noise and
the faint sound of "All Right Now" being piped in over
loudspeaker.
By the time Navy was piling it on in the third quar
ter, students were recycling the poster board provided
for the halftime card stunt to construct paper air
planes. The biggest cheers after halftime were for the
planes that floated from the upper deck and onto the
field.
"It could be a very quiet season if The Band stays
suspended," said senior Jarret Guajardo.
The Band is in limbo after the University an
nounced last Thursday that the group is on indefinite
provisional status and will be led by an interim direc
tor. And while the Band Run will go on as planned
Wednesday, it is unlikely that the group will be present
for the critical Washington State showdown this Satur
day, according to officials close to the situation.The de
cision to put The Band on probation was based in part
on a University report completed on Sept. 13, which
determined that several members had intentionally
vandalized the Band Shak, a leased modular near
Encina Hall and the Serra Complex, on the evening of
July 17.
"Given the seriousness of the Band Shak incident,
compounded by the recurring problems with the
Band. I am lifting the current interim suspension [since
July 18] and placing the Band on indefinite provision
al status while the University determines the condi
tions under which the privileges of The Band will be
fully reinstated," said Vice Provost of Student Affairs
Greg Boardman.
The University defines indefinite provisional status
as meaning that (1) the Band will not be performing at
this weekend's Stanford Stadium grand opening or
any other athletic event through at least the end of
September: (2) all students involved in the vandalism
