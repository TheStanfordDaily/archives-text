## No end in sight for Band ban Band absent for 37-9 drubbing by Navy in stadium grand opening 
### JENNY ALLEN DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Midway through the fourth quarter of Saturday's
game, a cry arose from the student section. "This is our
house, this is our house," the crowd chanted louder and
louder. It was a memorable moment for the opening of
the new Stanford Stadium, or it would have been, that
is, if it had come from Stanford's student section.
The Band, placed on indefinite provisional status
last week, was not on the field during the Cardinal's
37-9 drubbing at the hands of the Midshipmen, with
predictable results: as the game began to turn in
Navy's favor, the Card might as well have been playing
in Annapolis. A few Bandies were in attendance,
dressed in street clothes but still donning their pin-en
crusted "lids," and The Tree, co-terminal student
Tommy Leep, was flashed on the Jumbotron. But with
an on-going investigation into mid-summer vandalism
of the Band Shak. the irreverent brass and drums fell
silent.
And so did the crowd.
"What's the point?" asked senior John Collins as he
stood up from his seat two minutes into the second
quarter and quietly left the stadium.
The rest of the Red Zone seemed to agree. The stu
dent section never got into the game, unimpressed
with Cardinal Competitive Cheer's pleas for noise and
the faint sound of "All Right Now" being piped in over
loudspeaker.
By the time Navy was piling it on in the third quar
ter, students were recycling the poster board provided
for the halftime card stunt to construct paper air
planes. The biggest cheers after halftime were for the
planes that floated from the upper deck and onto the
field.
"It could be a very quiet season if The Band stays
suspended," said senior Jarret Guajardo.
The Band is in limbo after the University an
nounced last Thursday that the group is on indefinite
provisional status and will be led by an interim direc
tor. And while the Band Run will go on as planned
Wednesday, it is unlikely that the group will be present
for the critical Washington State showdown this Satur
day, according to officials close to the situation.The de
cision to put The Band on probation was based in part
on a University report completed on Sept. 13, which
determined that several members had intentionally
vandalized the Band Shak, a leased modular near
Encina Hall and the Serra Complex, on the evening of
July 17.
"Given the seriousness of the Band Shak incident,
compounded by the recurring problems with the
Band. I am lifting the current interim suspension [since
July 18] and placing the Band on indefinite provision
al status while the University determines the condi
tions under which the privileges of The Band will be
fully reinstated," said Vice Provost of Student Affairs
Greg Boardman.
The University defines indefinite provisional status
as meaning that (1) the Band will not be performing at
this weekend's Stanford Stadium grand opening or
any other athletic event through at least the end of
September: (2) all students involved in the vandalism
will be suspended from Band mem
bership: (3) the Band may not travel
for at least one year; (4) the Band's
alcohol suspension will be extended
indefinitely; and (5) the Band will be
required to pay the full cost of the
damages to the Band Shak. estimat
ed to be between $30,000 and
$50,000.
Associate Dean of Students Chris
Griffith will be responsible for ap
proving the Stanford Band's partici
pation in any University and non-
University events. Griffith and
Boardman have agreed to allow the
Stanford Band to hold its traditional
Band Run during early fall quarter.
"The indefinite provisional status
provides the time to address a num
ber of organizational deficiencies
within the band, to establish a part
nership between Band leadership
and the University, and to give the
Band an opportunity to demonstrate
its commitment to address our con
cerns." Griffith said. "Until we've
had sufficient time to make progress
on these goals, a full performance
schedule will not be implemented.
The Band Run is a tradition, the wel
coming of incoming freshmen on
their first night at Stanford, and
there was strong support to allow
that tradition to continue."
As interim director, Griffith
hopes to help establish an organiza
tional model for the Stanford Band
that "promotes responsibility and
accountability while retaining the
creativity that is uniquely Stanford."
"I think it is important to instill
the notion of stewardship - that the
care of the organization by this gen
eration of band members will ensure
that the traditions continue beyond
their tenure." Griffith continued.
Student organization misconduct
is typically reviewed by the Organi
zation Conduct Board (OCB) with
recommendations made to the Dean

of Students for administrative ac
tion, according to Boardman,
"Given that the Band has ap
peared before the OCB multiple
times, and given that serious Band
misconduct continues, I have decided
not to refer the Band Shak incident to
the OCB," Boardman said."This deci
sion is in keeping with the OCB pro
tocol that provides for an alternate
process for review and resolution."
This alternative process includes
not only Griffith as interim director,
hut also the creation of a Band Rein
statement Committee that is
charged with developing criteria for
the Stanford Band's full reinstate
ment.
"At a minimum the Band Rein

statement Committee's criteria will
include developing policies to (1) en
sure compliance with University poli
cies, law, and respect for persons and
property, (2) develop an effective or
ganization and leadership model, and
(3) create a strong working partner
ship between Band leadership and
the University." Boardman said."The
overriding principle in this effort is to
preserve the spirit and creativity of a
scatter band while achieving these
goals. Inherent in membership in any
organization is the acceptance of both
the privileges afforded its members as
well as the consequences for actions
that violate the University's stan
dards of conduct."
Boardman's decision was not

based solely on the recent vandal
ism. which he noted included dam
age from sledgehammers and food
against the walls as well as destroyed
music equipment. The indefinite
provisional status is also a response
to a history of misconduct by the
Stanford Band; since 2003. nine con
duct complaints have been filed with
the Office of Student Affairs.
"I think our focus now should be
on talking about the future," Board
man continued. "The University
wants to move forward with the Band
to determine under what conditions
that the Band can be reinstated."
