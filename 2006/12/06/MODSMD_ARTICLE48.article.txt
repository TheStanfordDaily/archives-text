## Univ employee busted for EPA meth lab Stanford monogrammed medical gear found in suspect's home 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
On May 5, East Palo Alto police busted a large
methamphetamine conversion and extraction facility
located in the home of Stanford Hospital worker Ben
jamin Ruezga. The residence, located at 998 Run
nymede Street in East Palo Alto, also contained
"boxes upon boxes upon boxes" of medical supplies
and equipment, according to East Palo Alto Police Lt.
Tom Alipio.
A follow-up search last Wednesday revealed equip
ment - some of which bore the Stanford University
Medical Center monogram - that appeared to be ready
for use in a makeshift hospital. Alipio noted that some
of the implements had blood on them, but that it was
impossible to say how long ago they had been used.
Though the room also contained operating room
scrubs, hospital gowns and baby carriers, a search re
vealed no anesthetics or medicines that would have
been used during operations.
The recovered hospital supplies and equipment are
valued at more than $25,000.
"It's a massive amount of stuff," Alipio said."We re
covered one piece, a surgical reamer, used to set major
bones." He said the tool is worth $15,000, and that po
lice also recovered several gold-plated clamps worth
$6,000 to $7,000.
While police are still unsure of exactly how much of
the material came from Stanford, they estimated that
at least three-quarters of it was stolen from the Med
ical Center.
As a longtime Stanford Hospital employee work
ing in the warehouse department, Ruezga had full ac
cess to many areas of the Hospital, lt is unclear how he
was able to acquire the vast amount
of medical supplies, but authorities
also found several invoices for hos
pital materials at his home, including
one dated May 5. the day of the bust.
"I le may not be the only one in
volved in this," Alipio said.
The Runnymede residence is a
three-building complex. The hospi
tal. located in a separate building
from the drug lab. would have been a
valuable asset to criminals seeking
to receive medical attention without
raising eyebrows, as hospitals are re
quired to report criminals with
wounds matching police reports.
Police also found a large cache of
arms - 11 handguns, four rifles and
three illegal assault weapons. Alipio
said that the handguns were regis
tered to Ruezga but that police are
still trying to trace the other guns.
"We're still in the early stages of
this thing." he said. "Right now our
focus is to return the bulk of this
property to Stanford and to charge
Ruezga with the appropriate
charges."
The lab itself was not specifically
intended for the production of
methamphetamine. Instead, it was
used to extract pseudoephedrine,
the drug's main ingredient, from
over-the-counter pills and to convert
finished methamphetamine into a
smokable form, called "ice."
Authorities confiscated six or
seven pounds of finished drugs and
the materials to make up to 20
pounds more, Alipio said. One

pound dI moth has a street value of
$11,000.
"For the level of drugs in our
county, this is a big one." San Mateo
County Chief Deputy District Attor
ney Steve Wagstaffe told the Daily.
Police arrested six men. all of
whom are being charged with the
manufacturing of a controlled sub
stance: possession of methampheta
mine, cocaine and marijuana; the in
tent to sell; conspiracy and various
weapons charges, Wagstaffe said.
Ile added that though the county
has not yet charged anyone regard
ing the hospital equipment, the re
port on the medical supplies remains
incomplete.
"I assume something will be
forthcoming regarding that," he said.
Alipio reported that Stanford
I lospital officials attempted to avoid
involvement in the investigation at
first, but are now fully on board.
"They're being very cooperative
now." he said.
Stanford students reacted non
chalantly to the news that a Hospital
employee was arrested in connec
tion with one of the biggest drug-re
lated busts in county history.
"I don't feel like things that hap
pen off campus really affect us that
much," said freshman Jesse Wein
stein-Gould. "It's kind of an out-of
sight-out-of-mind deal. 1 don't feel
unsafe on campus because of this."
Stanford Hospital Senior Com
munications Manager Andrea Smith
declined to comment on the issue,
except to say that the Medical Cen
ter is cooperating with the ongoing
police investigation.
