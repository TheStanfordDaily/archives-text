## Mausoleum Party gets mixed reviews 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Penguins. Care Bears, dominoes,
and obnoxious tourists came ready to
party at the Mausoleum Friday night.
But while organizers hailed the event
a success, students complained about
overcrowding, poor audio and a
power outage that left the sound sys
tem and their spirits down.
Following a four-year absence,
publicity and word-of-mouth sent
droves of students streaming up Palm
Drive on foot and by Marguerite
shuttles. Event organizers said they
distributed 4.000 wristbands before
midnight and admitted more than
1,000 after the wristbands ran out.
For their part, event organizers
said they were pleased with the
party's outcome.
"It feels great to be a part of bring
ing back a Stanford tradition," said
Junior Class President Brett Ham
mon. "It's nice to plan an event that
hasn't happened in the last five years
because I'm confident that it was the
best Mausoleum Party any of the un
dergrads have ever been to."
After braving the cold and walking
up to two miles from their dorms, stu
dents gave the event sub-par ratings.
"I was expecting a lot more,so this
is kind of below my expectations,"
said freshman Robert Bonkowski,
who arrived dressed as Mozart. "Be
cause this is such a pumped-up event,
and we haven't had it for five years, 1
was expecting more - more people,
more dancing, in general more every
thing."
Crissy lglesias, a 2006 graduate
and party attendee, wasn't sure Fri
day night was worth the wait.
"1 don't think the Class of 2006
missed out on too much," she said.
Senior Rachel Levy agreed, rating
the party as "okay," but said that she
was glad the University agreed to
hold it.
"This is my fourth year here, and
this is the first time that I have seen
the campus observe Halloween in a
unified way," she said.
While students griped about the

lack of music, which began at around
11 p.m., many said that they were im
pressed with the different costumes
students wore. Sophomore Alex
Coley. who wore a pumpkin on his
head, said that seeing everybody in
costume was the highlight of the
party.
"I saw another guy with a pump
kin head.and that made my night." he
said. "Other than the costumes, it was
a regular party, albeit with way more
people."
Some students eschewed tradi
tional outfits altogether. Sophomore
Chad Bowling took one dorm mate's
lemons and turned them into lemon
ade.
"There was a girl that wanted to
be a spoon, but that didn't work out."
he said. "So I turned it into a penis."
To ensure that the party ran
smoothly, a small contingent of police
officers were on duty in addition to
Special Event patrols. Police made
one arrest for public intoxication, and
two students were transported to the
emergency room for alcohol poison
ing, Deputy Ken Bates said.
Though the party was officially an
alcohol-free event, Hammon ac
knowledged that some students ar
rived at the party having already con
sumed alcohol.
"Fortunately, there were only a
few belligerent people, and they were
taken care of right away." he said.
Bates said that police were con
cerned about students "frontload
ing" for the party, but that there were
no major issues relating to alcohol or
illicit activity.
"One very positive thing to note is
that there was not one noise com
plaint from anyone from the City of
Palo Alto regarding the party, which
is what shut it down last time," Bates
added.
Junior Jessica Stanley. ASSU stu
dent life executive,said that the Mau
soleum Party's success meant it
would definitely be organized again
next year.

ing place of the Stanford family, had not been held since 2001.
