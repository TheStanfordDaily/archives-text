# Potential football coach replacement
## 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Bob Bowlsby's reputation as a coach-finder is strong, so it shouldn t
be a surprise if Walt Harris' replacement is an unexpected name.
But for coaches who might be in the running, this list is a good place
to start:
Jim Harbaugh — Head Coach, University of San Diego
Pluses: The former Michigan and NFL quarterback attended Palo
Alto High School. Father Jack was an assistant coach at Stanford
and Michigan. USD Toreros finished 11-1 this season. Active in
community charities.
Minuses: USD plays in a non-scholarship league. Questions about
his ability to hire a Division l-A staff. Charged with DUI last fall.
Bottom Line: This hot name with lots of potential could stay on The
Farm for a long time.
Dick Tomey — Head Coach, San Jose State
Pluses: A Pac-10 veteran (14 years at
Arizona) and proven winner. Excels at
developing playmakers out of unher
alded recruits. Took San Jose State
from the brink of shutdown to an 8-4
season.
Minuses: At age 68, some question
how long he will remain in coaching.
San Jose State looks to lock him up with
a long-term deal.
Bottom Line: Definitely a top candidate
who could rebuild the program with
strong coaching.
Mike Leach — Head Coach, Texas Tech
Pluses: Regarded as one of the most in
novative offensive minds in college
football, Leach has produced some of
the best passing offenses of the last ten
years. Cerebral and well-educated,
with both master's and law degrees.
History of success at a variety of stops.
Minuses: Unorthodox personal style
and pedigree may not play well with
fans. Strongly rumored as a candidate
for the Miami (FL) job.
Bottom Line: Other suitors with bigger
money may land him before Stanford
gets a chance, but he could succeed
here.
Tom O'Brien — Head Coach, Boston Col
lege
Pluses: The former Marine has had
eight straight winning seasons at the
small private university. Known for
building strong offensive lines and get
ting the most out of his players. His
teams play hard and beat opponents
with superior talent. Has beaten Notre
Dame five times. Rock-solid character.
Minuses: Models himself as a "CEO"
coach with little hands-on player con
tact. Has never coached in the West;
his strong recruiting pipeline to New
Jersey would be cut off.
Bottom Line: Would be a strong, safe
pick and likely a bargain, but would
only leave Chestnut Hill if he has noth
ing left to prove there.
Norm Chow — Offensive Coordinator,

Tennessee Titans
Pluses: The wildly successful assistant at
BYU and USC coached three college
offenses that won national titles and
has coached four Heisman Trophy win
ners. A finalist for the Stanford job in
2004, Chow was very interested in the
opening that ultimately went to Walt
Hams.
Minuses: Has never been a head
coach. Aloof reputation. Would com
mand a huge salary. Rumors flying
about openings at North Carolina State
and Arizona State, who could out-bid
the Cardinal.
Bottom Line: Was a good candidate
two years ago, but at this point Stanford
can't afford the risk of someone without
clear head-coaching potential.
Steve Sarkisiarv Assistant Head Coach,
USC: With pro and college success,
Sarkisian seems destined for a head
job, but his potential doesn't outweigh
candidates above.
Steve Mariutci — Former head coach,
Cal/49ers: Bay Area ties and pro expe
rience are impressive, but would re
cruits see him as a washout who was
the first coach to get worked over by
Terrell Owens?
Jim Fassel — Former New York Giants
Head Coach: The onetime Stanford as
sistant helped tutor John Elway on The
Farm, but has been fired from his last
two jobs in the NFL and hasn't coached
in college in 1 7 years.
Dan McCarney — Recently-fired lowa State
head coach: His success at lowa State
is remarkable, but his lowa ties to
Bowlsby likely won't overcome overall
losing record.
Ron English — Michigan defensive coordi
nator: Cal alum excites many, but is
probably a year or two away from
being big-time head coach material.
James Lofton—Wide receivers coach,
San Diego Chargers: The All American
receiver and long jumper found great
success in the Cardinal program in his
playing days, but with only five years in
coaching he lacks the authoritative ex
perience necessary for the Stanford job.
Bob Bowlsby's reputation as a coach-finder is strong, so it shouldn t
be a surprise if Walt Harris' replacement is an unexpected name.
