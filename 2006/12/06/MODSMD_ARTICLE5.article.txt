# Potential football coach replacement
## 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Bob Bowlsby's reputation as a coach-finder is strong, so it shouldn t
be a surprise if Walt Harris' replacement is an unexpected name.
But for coaches who might be in the running, this list is a good place
to start:
Jim Harbaugh — Head Coach, University of San Diego
Pluses: The former Michigan and NFL quarterback attended Palo
Alto High School. Father Jack was an assistant coach at Stanford
and Michigan. USD Toreros finished 11-1 this season. Active in
community charities.
Minuses: USD plays in a non-scholarship league. Questions about
his ability to hire a Division l-A staff. Charged with DUI last fall.
Bottom Line: This hot name with lots of potential could stay on The
Farm for a long time.
Dick Tomey — Head Coach, San Jose State
