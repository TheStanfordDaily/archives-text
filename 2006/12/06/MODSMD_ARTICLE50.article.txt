## Junior sinks winning Beirut cup from 5,000 miles 
### DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT MANAGING EDITOR 
Opponents in Beirut usually stand on opposite sides of
a ping-pong table. Last week, Stanford students faced each
other on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean.
Juniors Josh Merritt and Mike Knuepfel organized
what they believe is the first intercontinental match of
Beirut ever late Thursday night. Merritt and friends set up
Web cameras and a microphone in the Sen a lounge and
Knuepfel did the same in a Stanford in Kyoto center class
room. Both teams arranged 10 cups on opposite ends like
in a normal match, but when a shooter hit a cup, they re
moved it and their opponents removed and drank the cor
responding cup. Play began at 1 1:23 p.m. Pacific Standard
Time, or 3:23 p.m. in Kyoto.
The concept seemed simple enough, but the match was
understandably plagued by technical difficulties. Merritt
broadcast the match on Sen a's new projector - a gil t from
the Munger Graduate Residences project for all the con
struction noise the dorm has suffered through this year

but the streaming video over Skype was choppy and de
layed. Hie video was also too blurry to know what cups
were hit, and so Merritt and teammate junior Oscar Bus
tos and Knuepfel and his partner Tafiti Uso were left to
use the honor system and describe what cups they made.
"Penultimate back left," junior and self-appointed
commentator Hmmerich Davies directed with some diffi
culty. leading some onlookers to liken the game to Battle
ship. Curious Japanese students from nearby Kyoto Uni
versity. who were at the center for a party, came and went
throughout the match. They struggled to understand the
game and ended up talking to students in Sen a over the
Webcam."
Merritt and Bustos started out strong and built a 6-2
lead, while Knuepfel blamed his team's early struggles on
the McDonald's soda cups they were using. But he and
I Jso soon acclimated themselves to the equipment - taller
and narrower than traditional red party cups - and
stormed back to even the score to 2-2. Bustos soon found
his range, however, and propelled the North American
side to victory. I le hit the final shot to a chorus of cheers in

Serra. followed by a delayed "Ohhhhhh" from Japan.
After onlooker Tori Niemynski. a junior, declared an
"international pee break," the teams split two more games
before calling it a night - or an afternoon on the Japanese
side.
Knuepfel called the match a success.
"The excessive use of technology to play a drinking
game was a bit ridiculous." he said,"But in the end the re
actions were pretty positive from both the American and
Japanese students."
This was Merritt and Knuepfel's second foray in intro
ducing Beirut to another continent - they played in Sicily
in the summer of 2004 while on a Stanford dig - and Mer
ritt said he saw the event as more than just fun.
"Nothing helps ease a difficult cultural transition like
drinking with your good friends and doing something out
rageous." he said."lf we expose people to new things in the
process, it's all the better."
