## Nobel winners adjust to fame Former laureate Osheroff says celebrity status tough to adjust to 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
For Prof. Andrew Fire and Prof. Roger Kornberg, the
2(X)6 Nobel Prize laureates in Medicine and Chemistry re
spectively, last week's early morning phone calls first seemed
like an annoying misdial.
Kornberg had just arrived home from Israel last Wednes
day when the phone rang at 2:30 a.m. Jolted awake from
what were his first few moments of sleep in 48 hours. Korn
berg was stunned to hear that he'd won the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry for his contributions to DNA transcription.
"I didn't have any first thoughts," he said in an interview
withThe Daily."! was initially bewildered."
Little did he know, that would be end of his sleep for the
night. Within 15 minutes of the official announcement, the
press corps was clogging his phone line.
Two days earlier. Fire had received a similar call. "1
thought it was a mistake," he said. "1 was not sure 1 was
awake."
Fire, whose interest in science began in middle school
baking soda and vinegar experiments, soon realized the call
was real. His work with a method called "gene silencing" had
earned him the Nobel Prize in Medicine.
A week after the surprise, both professors say they hope
to continue with their lives and work as usual.
"1 plan to do the same work as we were doing before,
which I greatly enjoy," Kornberg said. "I wiint to press on. 1
am certainly not done."
Fire and Kornberg both plan to stay grounded to their re

search and families.but it may not be so easy with the height
ened reeognition that follows Nobel laureates.
"It seems the best time to get the Nobel Prize is when
you're about to retire," said Physics Prof. Douglas Osheroff,
who won the award for physics in 1996.
(Jsheroff said it can be hard to find the balance between
research, teaching and lecture invitations from presidents,
kings and institutions around the world. While he said it is al
ways a great experience to travel to exotic places and reach
out to young scientists. Osheroff had one piece of advice to
pass on to Stanford's two new winners:
" You have to learn to say 'no' at times." he said.
I or I ire. a modest and soft-spoken Sunnyvale native, the
week has been a wild ride, but he said he is ready to take up
the extra responsibility.

"It's nice that Nobel Prize winners have the chance to
promote the science that's being done in the community and
bring it to the attention of the public and (\ingress." he said.
"People listen to you. 1 think of it as not exactly a burden.but
a challenge."
The two professors say the road to the Nobel is found in
vital intellectual curiosity, hard work and a bit of luck.
"Do whatever you do just as well as you possibly can."
Kornberg said. "After that, some people get lucky."
Fire emphasized that significant contributions to science
were made by the collaboration of many minds.
"Listen to your colleagues, listen to your students and
other people around you who have ideas and questions." he
