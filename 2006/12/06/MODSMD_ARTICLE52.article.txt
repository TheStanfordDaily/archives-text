It may not be "All Right Now" for
members of the I.eland Stanford Ju
nior I niversity Marching Band.The
Band Shak at Serra Street and Ar
guello Way was vandalized some
time between the evening of July 17
and the early morning of July 18. The
incident was reported to the Stan
ford police, who are conducting a
criminal investigation into the mat
ter. Initial estimates of the damage to
the building are between $30,000 and
$50,000.
"It is believed that members of
the Stanford Band may have been in
volved in the acts of vandalism," said
Alan Acosta, the director of Univer
sity communications. "The Universi
t\ has initiated an investigation to
determine whether there have been
possible violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard and other University
policies. The University takes these
actions with the utmost seriousness
and as a result has placed the band on
suspension pending the outcome of
this investigation.'Hie suspension en
compasses all Band activities includ
ing practices, rehearsals, perform
ances. meetings and any other Band
affiliated events and activities, as
well as access to any Band facilities."
During the first two weeks of July,
the Band moved from its temporary
home since 2002 - a trailer near E:nci

na Hall and the Serra Complex - to
the music ensemble's third Band
Shak, housed in the former
DeGuerre Squash Courts.
Hie old Shak, which sources said
some hand members believed was to
be taken down by administration,
had tiles removed, its piano disas
sembled. holes put in walls, several
windows broken and the interior
partially spray painted.
Since the police investigation is
ongoing. Band Manager Michael
Priest declined to answer questions
related to the damages to the Band
Shak.
" Hie Band is very upset that their
old facility was damaged and is work
ing hard to ensure that similar dam
age does not take place in the Band's
new facility," Priest said.
Hie Band recently moved into the
former DeGuerre Squash Courts,
which will now serve as the musi
cians' third Band Shak. The new
Shak was funded by over 500 Band
and Stanford alumni who raised over
$2,800,000 for the permanent, state
of-the-art facility.
"We are very grateful for our
alumni's enthusiasm and support in
helping us make a successful move
into our new home." Priest said.
Due to the confidentiality of the
investigative process concerning the
Band Shak on Galvez Street, no ad
ditional information was available at
time of press. A University decision
is expected for Friday.
