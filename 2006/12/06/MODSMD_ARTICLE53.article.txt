## Former pages defend program 
### DIANNA BAI STAFF WRITER 
For 2005 grad Chris Clark, the
road to Stanford began on Capitol
Hill.
A farm kid out of Western Illinois.
16-year-old Clark wanted to "get out
and get away" from home. He
snatched his golden opportunity by
joining the House congressional
page program in 2000.
"Being a part of the page program
was a stepping stone to Stanford for
me," Clark said. A counselor at the
program urged him to apply to Stan
ford. a school that he."the kid from
the middle of nowhere," had never
considered. According to Clark, the
page program changed his life.
However, two weeks after ABC
News exposed Rep. Mark Foley for
sending sexually explicit emails and
instant messages to former congres
sional pages, a handful of elected of
ficials have suggested suspending the
page program altogether. But Clark
and other Stanford students and
alumni who participated in the pro
gram have come to its defense.
Several former pages told The
Daily that the best part of the pro
gram was, in fact, the close interac
tion with members of Congress.
Clark said that to a certain extent,
pages were vulnerable to congress
men. but in general a good dynamic
formed between them.
"We really do kind of idolize a lot
of the members of Congress, because
that's kind of why we're there," he
said. "We want to see firsthand the
people who run our country. To have
someone take advantage of that is re
ally unfortunate," Clark said.
Congressional pages, who range
from ages 16-18, populate the House
and Senate floors, running errands
and answering phones while getting
an inside look at Congress in action.
"There were only a handful of
members that were really nice to us
and took an interest in our lives," he
continued. "Those are the members
we remember, and that's why every
one would probably remember Con

gressman Foley."
Clark described Foley as one of
the few "friendlier" members, but
not in an unusual way.
"He was definitely one of those
people who would say hello and stop
by to ask how things were going." he
said. "To me that didn't set off any
alarms, but in hindsight.it makes you
wonder. There were rumors flying
around that he was gay - 'cause you
know, we're 16 and we talk about
these things - but that was it, rumors,
nothing about harassment."
Sophomore Theo Milonopoulos,
who worked as a page in 2003, said he
was shocked by the Foley scandal,
but strongly believed the program is
not to blame.
"1 got to meet some members of
Congress while I was a page who
were extremely congenial.There was
no sense of discomfort or impropri
ety," said Milonopoulos, whose twin
brother Niko was a page the same
year. "The flaw lies with this particu
lar congressman, and the real prob
lem is with the attempt of the Con
gressional leadership to cover it up."
Jess Lipschultz, a Stanford alum
and graduate of the 1999 page pro
gram, said the negative attention
would, if nothing else, discourage
parents from allowing their
teenagers to participate.
"1 was 16, and it was difficult for
my parents to let me go to DC. to
take part in the page program before
all this even happened. Some parents
will think twice," she said.
Lipschultz, who currently teaches
high school English now, said the re
cent controversy was unfortunate.
"1 was going to promote the pro
gram to my students, but now I'm not
even going to go there until this
whole scandal blows over."
Stanford students and graduates
are not the only former pages leaping
to the program's defense. A new
Facebook group, "Save the Congres
sional page program," boasts more
than 420 members, all alumni of the
program.
Both Lipschultz and Clark said
the program would undoubtedly un

dergo reforms. In 1983,tw0 sex scan
dals involving congressmen and un
derage pages led to previous reforms
of the page program.
Clark explained the current pro
gram is overseen by outsiders, the
Office of the Clerk and a board made
up of members of Congress, all of
whom may hesitate to "blow the
whistle" on something similar to a
sex scandal. The problem is com
pounded by the fact that young
pages would also hesitate to incrimi
nate a member of Congress.
"If a member had sent me emails
that made me uncomfortable, I'm
not sure 1 would have taken them to
the Clerk.just because it's a member
of Congress," he said. "We looked up
to them - and you don't want to start
something messy."
Clark suggested putting the pro
gram under the guidance of former
pages, who would be more approach
able counselors in cases of harass
ment. "I don't think a former page
would be as unwilling to blow the
whistle," he said.
Clark and the other interviewees
all agreed, though, the page program
was a memorable experience that
gave them the opportunity to see the
human side of the most powerful
people in the country.
"Regardless of whether they are
pages or not, there will be people in
power who exploit children," Lip
schultz said.
The Foley scandal, however, does
not reflect the nature of the page
program. Lipschultz said.
The program showed me that [the
members of Congress] are passion
ate and hardworking." she said. "It
actually made me a lot less cynical
about the way our government
works."
Clark expressed that he still ad
mires the congressmen he observed
during the page program. "It's still
my dream job." Clark said. "I would
love to be a member of Congress
someday."
