Thirteen members of Congress call Stanford
their Alma Mater. From California to Illinois, there are eight rep
resentatives and five senators. The Daily profiled each member. Some were
effusive with their time and graciously offered interviews while others de
clined to be interviewed, citing time constraints and campaigning ahead of
the Nov. 7 election. Some came here as impressionable undergraduates,
others as hardened law, business or engineering students. All have made
the transition, from The Farm to The Hill.

Jeff Bingaman (D- NM) [topj

Long after his Stanford Law School days of
going for cheeseburgers and beer at what he
called "Zot's," Sen. Jeff Bingaman became a De
mocratic Senator in New Mexico. Bingaman has
been repeatedly re-elected since his first victory
in 1982.
He received his B.A. in government from
1 iarvard University and came to Stanford for his
law degree.
The senator married a law classmate. Anne
Kovacovich, with whom he has one son. He said
his greatest accomplishment at Stanford was
"probably finding my wife and marrying her."
Doug Barton, who attended Stanford with
Bingaman and currently practices law in San
Francisco, recalled how Bingaman's peers
thought highly of him.
"Jeff is an extraordinarily engaging guy," he
said. "He's got a great sense of humor, very dry
sense of humor, and he was just a great friend
and very widely admired in our class."
Law classmate and friend Jim Holden, also a
lawyer in San Francisco, agreed with Barton's
seniiment.
"He's always had a self-effacing, thoughtful,
calm personality, and being a Senator, he's still
self-effacing, down-to-earth and has a thought
ful personality." he said. "That's really wonderful
because sometimes, I think power goes to the
head of those in Congress and the Senate, but
not for him."
Barton recalled that Bingaman served as a
Stern Resident Assistant, at a time when law stu
dents could take the job to earn extra money.
Bingaman also participated in mock trial activi
ties.
" I was active in the moot court competition at
the Law School," Bingaman said. "We basically
practiced appellate arguments on different legal
cases that we brought up."
Barton remembered a classic moment from

one mock trial with Bingaman.
"1 remember that there was a murder case,
and he represented the defense and I represent
ed the prosecution. I remember us arguing be
fore the jury of the Stanford law students. He
said 'surely you jest,' and that was his character
ization of our argument."
Law school buddies hung out at the Dutch
Goose.
'it was a beer establishment," Barton said. "It
was a favorite hangout for Stanford students,
and became one for the law students in particu
lar. We could go out and drink beer and shoot
some pool. We took some road trips. We'd have
long philosophical discussions. It was clear at
that time he was quite interested in politics, so
we talked about that a lot."
Holden noted that one such trip went awry.
"I remember driving over to San Gregorio
Beach, and the gas fumes almost aborted Sen.
Bingaman's life," he said. "He was just getting
gassed in the back seat. The gas fumes were so
bad that Senator Bingaman was turning green in
the back seat."
Holden also commented on how Bingaman
was looking ahead to a political career even as a
student.
"He was interested in politics at that time,
and 1 think he thought he would be a senator.
I m not sure that any of the rest of us thought he
would be a senator just because the chances are
fairly remote."
Upon graduation. Bingaman returned to
New Mexico to practice law and became New
Mexico Attorney General in 1978. He said that
his choice of career stemmed from a lifelong in
terest in politics.
"1 had always been interested in politics and
government," he said. "Growing up. I had an
uncle who was very involved in politics in New
Mexico, not as a candidate, but as an active party
member. That sort of piqued my interest as a
young person."
Bingaman currently serves as Ranking Mem

berof the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. He has worked to devote federal
funds to solar energy research and recently intro
duced several bi-partisan bills to reduce the na
tion s dependence on oil and natural gas.
"I've tried in the Energy Committee to move
us toward more use of clean energy in the coun
try. more development of alternative energy and
more emphasis on efficiency in the use of ener
gy," he said. "Also. I've been trying to get the nec
essary support to begin controlling greenhouse
gas emission nationwide."
He serves as Ranking Member of the Sub
committee on International Trade on the Fi
nance Committee. He is also a Senior Member
of the Joint Economic Committee, as well as a
member of the Subcommittee on Health Care
and the Subcommittee on Social Security and
Family Policy, and the Health,Education,Labor,
and Pensions Committee.
"I've also spent a lot of time on healthcare is
sues through the Finance Committee and
through the Health and Education Committee,
trying to expand access to healthcare and resist
cuts in healthcare funding." Bingaman said.
"And I've been quite involved in trying to im
prove academic standards in our schools."
Bingaman has been an advocate for funding
for Border Patrol agents, surveillance cameras
and vehicle barriers. He has worked to devote
resources to youth dropout prevention, drug
courts and rehabilitation and treatment service.
He has condemned secrecy surrounding de
tained terrorist suspects and supports due
process as well as bans on degrading prisoner
treatment.
Polls predict Bingaman will easily win re
election again in 2006. but he expressed uncer
tainty about the success of Democratic candi
dates in general.
"I don't think it's clear if we'll regain control
over the Senate or not." he said. "I think we'll
pick up seats, but I don't know if we'll win a ma
jority."

David Wu (D-OR-l) [bottom left]

As an undergrad. Rep. David
Wu's proudest achievement was a
weekly ritual. Upon finding out that
the medical school library opened at
S a.m. on Sundays, the future con
gressman resolved to study there
every weekend.
"No matter how late 1 stayed up. I
made sure I was there when the door
opened." he said. "It was my way of
disciplining the weekend."
Wu. a Democrat who represents
Oregon's First District, sits on the
House Education Committee and
the Science Committee.
After graduating from Stanford
in 1977 with a B.S. in Biology, Wu at
tended Harvard Medical School be
fore deciding to pursue a J.D. at Yale,
lie represented Oregon's technolo
gy sector in its fast-developing
Northwest region and parlayed a
decade of legal experience into a
congressional win in 1998.
Recalling his favorite Stanford
memory, the Congressman men
tioned his time as a photographer for
The Daily but ultimately settled on a
recollection of the campus's vernal
ambiance.
"Around the Stanford campus in
the springtime, the birds sinu into the

night and you can smell flowers all
night long." he reminisced. "Some
times you're just cruising from one
place to another and you have that
scent in the air. It still strikes me as
the single coolest memory."
Wu is the only Taiwanese-Amer
ican in Congress. lie made the deci
sion to enter public service after a
lifetime of seeing public decisions
impact his family. Wu's mother and
her children had to wait six years to
follow his father to America due to
restrictive immigration laws, arriv
ing only after the system was re
formed by John F. Kennedy in 1961.
At a poor public high school in
southern California, he watched
the rising costs of the University of
California schools deter many of
his classmates from attending col
lege.
Wu is widely expected to win his
fifth term on Tuesday. He faces a re
election challenge from two-term
Republican state legislator Derrick
Kitts. The Oregonian recently re
ported that Wu had his rival "out
matched." raising $1.3 million in the
election period ending September 30
to Kitts's $210,000.
Nevertheless, the incumbent says
he is taking the election very serious
ly.
"I've been pounding the pave

ment for a month and I'll be back in
Oregon tomorrow." Wu said from
Washington, where he celebrated his
wife's birthday.
"1 don't make predictions because
I tend to be lousy at it,"he added.
"You take care of the fundamentals
— you block, you tackle, you play as
hard as you can — then the score's
the score when the clock runs out."
Although reluctant to call his own
race, Wu was optimistic about the
Democrats' chances nationally.
"This is probably the best
prospect I've seen in my eight years
of restoring real checks and balances
to the system," he said.
After the election, the 109 th Con
gress will reconvene for its lame duck
session — a period for which Wu
says he is "boundlessly optimistic."
His biggest project for that session
is the shepherding of a healthcare in
formation technology bill through
the Science Committee. The bill. Wu
says, would fund health care IT re
search. train experts in both fields
and "start the process of developing
standards so that different computers
can talk with each other in the health
care arena." He said it holds the pos
sibility of reducing some of the indus
try's spiraling costs by making infor
mation sharing among medical insti
tutions more efficient.

Zoe Lofgren (D-CA-16) [bottom right]

Between late night talks with her
roommate and having trouble pick
ing a major. Congresswoman Zoe
Lofgren's (D-CA) Stanford experi
ence was pretty typical.
But Lofgren. who earned a B.A.
in political science in 1970 and cur
rently represents San Jose and Cali
fornia's 16th District in the U.S.
House of Representatives, also re
called experiences unique to her
generation.
One of Lofgren's most vivid Stan
ford memories was the tear gassing
of her dorm.
"It was the '60s, so it was a tumul
tuous time," she said. "There were
demonstrations on campus because
the Vietnam War was going on. In a
lot of ways it was a frightening time."
Lofgren lived in Branner Hall her
freshman year, which was then all-fe
male housing. She described how the
residents of Wilbur Hall, all fresh
men boys, "stormed Branner Hall in
a traditional panty raid."
"I think it was the last panty raid,"
she said. "The next year, there were
co-ed dorms and everything
changed."
Although Lofgren acknowledged
that her campus impact and involve

ment were minimal — ,- l wasn't very
much for joining things." she said
she did study in Britain for six
months.
While abroad, she worked with po
litical science Prof. Ray Wolfinger.now
at UC-Berkeley. to conduct the first
public opinion poll in the Midlands,
which she rated as one of her most
valuable experiences at Stanford.
"When 1 was there, they had a
mansion in the middle of the Mid
lands." she said. "It was definitely an
interesting experience."
Lofgren said that deciding to
major in political science was "really
rather random."
"We weren't as organized as your
generation." she said."l'm the first in
my family to go to college, so I got a
scholarship and 1 really didn't know
what 1 was doing. As I got closer to
graduation. 1 realized I needed to
pick a major, so I picked the one 1
had the most units in. which was
PoliSci."
Similarly. Lofgren's entry into
politics was not premeditated.
"I just bursted into it after I gradu
ated." she said."l went to Washington
without a job or really even a plan. I
just went there thinking 1 could do
something to make a difference."
Lofgren said she talked herself
into a job with her predecessor in

Congress and ended up working for
him for eight years. While on his staff,
she went to law school and got in
volved in local government. After
running for and holding offices in
local government, Lofgren ran for
Congress.
Lofgren said that she and the rest
of the Democratic representatives
aren't taking anything for granted in
next week's elections.
"1 know a lot of people are saying
that the Democrats will take control
[of Congress], and that is possible,
but by no means certain,"she said."lf
Democrats do regain the majority,
we have a whole agenda that we wish
to deliver."
This agenda includes a new em
phasis on science and basic research
in education, energy independence
in 10 years and full broadband de
ployment to every section of the
country within five years.'lTiese goals
comprise what Lofgren called an "in
novation agenda," a program Lof
gren unveiled at Stanford a little over
a year ago.
1 .ofgren. first elected to Congress in
1994, serves on the Committee on
1 lomeland Security,the Committee on
the Judiciary and the Committee on
House Administration. Many of her
legislative initiatives have involved en
ergy and Internet access issues.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has earned
the reputation as being one of the Sen
ate's most effective lawmakers. Widely
considered the matriarch of California
politics, the senior senator from the Gold
en State has enjoyed a storied political ca
reer spanning five decades at the local
and national levels.
Feinstein was first elected to the Sen
ate in a 1992 special election. In 14 years
in Congress's upper chamber, Feinstein
has earned a reputation as a pragmatic
voice of reason amidst the divisive ran
cor of Capitol Mill. Though a staunch
supporter of such traditional liberal
causes as gun control and abortion
rights, 112 einstein has gained respect from
both sides of the aisle for her willingness
to seek political compromise and bipar
tisan solutions.
A San Francisco native, Feinstein
graduated from the University in 1955
with a degree in History. At Stanford, Fe
instein served as president of Roble I fall,
and was later elected vice president of the
student body
"Dianne was such a lovely person to
everyone." recalled alumna Carole Cole.

who lived with Feinstein as a freshman in
Roble. "It was obvious to all of us that
she was going to be a leader."
Feinstein first held major political of
fice in 1969. when she was elected to the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She
became mayor when, as the president of
the Board of Supervisors, Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
were assassinated in Nov. 1978. In doing
so. Feinstein became the first female
mayor of a large American city. She was
thereafter reelected to two full terms.
Feinstein inspired significant praise
and incurred some criticism from Demo
cratic pundits for her decision not to
enter the gubernatorial recall election of
2003. a race many believed she would
win. Feinstein had survived a 19K4 recall
attempt in her own right as San Francis
co mayor.
Feinstein is thought to have been con
sidered as a running mate by then-Vice
President Al Gore during his run for the
presidency in 2000. before Gore settled
on Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
As a long-serving senator, Feinstein is
privileged to serve on five permanent
committees. As the only female on the Ju
diciary Committee, she garnered close
attention for her deliberation during the

confirmation hearings of Chief Justice
John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito,
Jr. Feinstein ultimately voted against
both nominees.
Feinstein invoked her time at the
University during the Roberts hearing,
when she insisted that the nominee take
a firm position on abortion.
"As a college student at Stanford. 1
watched the passing of the plate to col
lect money so a young woman could
go to Tijuana for a back-alley abor
tion," she said.
Feinstein was the Democratic spon
sor of a failed Constitutional Amend
ment to ban tlag-burning this summer.
Though her championing of this issue
angered some liberal supporters and
First Amendment advocates, the fallout
surrounding the failed amendment
does not seem to have affected Fein
stein's support among the general elec
torate.
With the Nov. 7 midterm elections
only four days away. Feinstein appears
poised to win her third full term. She
leads Republican challenger Richard
Mountjoy by wide margins in opinion
polls and fundraising, and has devoted
much time to campaigning on behalf of
other California politicians.

Jim Kolbe

Representative Jim Kolbe, 64, now serving his
eleventh and final term in the House of Represen
tatives, was the first Republican elected to repre
sent southern Arizona. He completed an MBA at
Stanford in 1%7 and then served in the United
States Navy during the Vietnam War. before serv
ing as Arizona State Senator from 1976-82.
For Kolbe, his strongest memory of Stanford
was his first day on campus.
"1 had not been on the Stanford campus before.
I had applied to Stanford for my undergraduate de
gree, been accepted, but then chose to go to North
western for my 8.A.," Kolbe said. "So arriving at
Stanford on a perfect September Saturday with a
football game in the afternoon brought a huge
dawning realization to me: I had spent four years in
the Chicago climate when 1 could have been at
Stanford all that time!"
Kolbe recalled taking advantage of campus life,
so much so that he deemed graduating his greatest
achievement at The Farm.
"1 had such a good time and was so active in so
many activities that I proudly say I graduated from
the Stanford GSB in the top 95 percent of my
class," Kolbe said.
Kolbe's introduction to public service was as a
page for Senator Barry Goldwater, the 1%4 Re
publican nominee for president and long-time Ari

zona senator. I lis experiences at the University so
lidified his interest in both public service and the
political arena, since he was involved with campus
politics and in Ronald Reagan's first campaign for
governor in 1%6.
Kolbe left the University with "nothing but
great memories."
Stanlord was a very important formative part
ot my younger life,' he said. "When 1 go back now,
I long wistfully tor the days when there were actu
ally citrus orchards in Mountain View and Sunny
vale."
During his linal term in the House, Kolbe said
his main priority was getting his Foreign Opera
tions Appropriation enacted into law.
Analysts expect Kolbe's seat to fall into Demo
cratic hands alter next Tuesday's election. The twi
light ol Kolbe s career has been dimmed by the
firestorm over the Mark Foley scandal. Kolbe was
chair of the page board in 2000 and has said he
passed on to the I louse Clerk reports of Foley's ad
vances on pages.
Kolbe is one of only a few MB As in Congress.
He was a classmate of the current GSB dean
Robert Joss.
My fellow members of Congress think Fmnuts
to have an MBA from Stanford and not be out
using it to make money," Kolbe joked during a 2002
V ii Sl * l°n ampUS " 1111 P °112 the degree and 1 use
the skills 1 learned in business school, but it didn't
create a fast track to Washington."

pick a major, so I picked the one 1

PoliSci."
Similarly. Lofgren's entry into
politics was not premeditated.
"I just bursted into it after I gradu
ated." she said."l went to Washington
without a job or really even a plan. I
just went there thinking 1 could do
something to make a difference."
Lofgren said she talked herself
into a job with her predecessor in

Congress and ended up working for
him for eight years. While on his staff,
she went to law school and got in
volved in local government. After
running for and holding offices in
local government, Lofgren ran for
Congress.
Lofgren said that she and the rest
of the Democratic representatives
aren't taking anything for granted in
next week's elections.
"1 know a lot of people are saying
that the Democrats will take control
[of Congress], and that is possible,
but by no means certain,"she said."lf
Democrats do regain the majority,
we have a whole agenda that we wish
to deliver."
This agenda includes a new em
phasis on science and basic research
in education, energy independence
in 10 years and full broadband de
ployment to every section of the
country within five years.'lTiese goals
comprise what Lofgren called an "in
novation agenda," a program Lof
gren unveiled at Stanford a little over
a year ago.
1 .ofgren. first elected to Congress in
1994, serves on the Committee on
1 lomeland Security,the Committee on
the Judiciary and the Committee on
House Administration. Many of her
legislative initiatives have involved en
ergy and Internet access issues.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has earned
the reputation as being one of the Sen
ate's most effective lawmakers. Widely
considered the matriarch of California
politics, the senior senator from the Gold
en State has enjoyed a storied political ca
reer spanning five decades at the local
and national levels.
Feinstein was first elected to the Sen
ate in a 1992 special election. In 14 years
in Congress's upper chamber, Feinstein
has earned a reputation as a pragmatic
voice of reason amidst the divisive ran
cor of Capitol Mill. Though a staunch
supporter of such traditional liberal
causes as gun control and abortion
rights, 112 einstein has gained respect from
both sides of the aisle for her willingness
to seek political compromise and bipar
tisan solutions.
A San Francisco native, Feinstein
graduated from the University in 1955
with a degree in History. At Stanford, Fe
instein served as president of Roble I fall,
and was later elected vice president of the
student body
"Dianne was such a lovely person to
everyone." recalled alumna Carole Cole.

who lived with Feinstein as a freshman in
Roble. "It was obvious to all of us that
she was going to be a leader."
Feinstein first held major political of
fice in 1969. when she was elected to the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She
became mayor when, as the president of
the Board of Supervisors, Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
were assassinated in Nov. 1978. In doing
so. Feinstein became the first female
mayor of a large American city. She was
thereafter reelected to two full terms.
Feinstein inspired significant praise
and incurred some criticism from Demo
cratic pundits for her decision not to
enter the gubernatorial recall election of
2003. a race many believed she would
win. Feinstein had survived a 19K4 recall
attempt in her own right as San Francis
co mayor.
Feinstein is thought to have been con
sidered as a running mate by then-Vice
President Al Gore during his run for the
presidency in 2000. before Gore settled
on Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
As a long-serving senator, Feinstein is
privileged to serve on five permanent
committees. As the only female on the Ju
diciary Committee, she garnered close
attention for her deliberation during the

confirmation hearings of Chief Justice
John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito,
Jr. Feinstein ultimately voted against
both nominees.
Feinstein invoked her time at the
University during the Roberts hearing,
when she insisted that the nominee take
a firm position on abortion.
"As a college student at Stanford. 1
watched the passing of the plate to col
lect money so a young woman could
go to Tijuana for a back-alley abor
tion," she said.
Feinstein was the Democratic spon
sor of a failed Constitutional Amend
ment to ban tlag-burning this summer.
Though her championing of this issue
angered some liberal supporters and
First Amendment advocates, the fallout
surrounding the failed amendment
does not seem to have affected Fein
stein's support among the general elec
torate.
With the Nov. 7 midterm elections
only four days away. Feinstein appears
poised to win her third full term. She
leads Republican challenger Richard
Mountjoy by wide margins in opinion
polls and fundraising, and has devoted
much time to campaigning on behalf of
other California politicians.

Jim Kolbe

Representative Jim Kolbe, 64, now serving his
eleventh and final term in the House of Represen
tatives, was the first Republican elected to repre
sent southern Arizona. He completed an MBA at
Stanford in 1%7 and then served in the United
States Navy during the Vietnam War. before serv
ing as Arizona State Senator from 1976-82.
For Kolbe, his strongest memory of Stanford
was his first day on campus.
"1 had not been on the Stanford campus before.
I had applied to Stanford for my undergraduate de
gree, been accepted, but then chose to go to North
western for my 8.A.," Kolbe said. "So arriving at
Stanford on a perfect September Saturday with a
football game in the afternoon brought a huge
dawning realization to me: I had spent four years in
the Chicago climate when 1 could have been at
Stanford all that time!"
Kolbe recalled taking advantage of campus life,
so much so that he deemed graduating his greatest
achievement at The Farm.
"1 had such a good time and was so active in so
many activities that I proudly say I graduated from
the Stanford GSB in the top 95 percent of my
class," Kolbe said.
Kolbe's introduction to public service was as a
page for Senator Barry Goldwater, the 1%4 Re
publican nominee for president and long-time Ari

zona senator. I lis experiences at the University so
lidified his interest in both public service and the
political arena, since he was involved with campus
politics and in Ronald Reagan's first campaign for
governor in 1%6.
Kolbe left the University with "nothing but
great memories."
Stanlord was a very important formative part
ot my younger life,' he said. "When 1 go back now,
I long wistfully tor the days when there were actu
ally citrus orchards in Mountain View and Sunny
vale."
During his linal term in the House, Kolbe said
his main priority was getting his Foreign Opera
tions Appropriation enacted into law.
Analysts expect Kolbe's seat to fall into Demo
cratic hands alter next Tuesday's election. The twi
light ol Kolbe s career has been dimmed by the
firestorm over the Mark Foley scandal. Kolbe was
chair of the page board in 2000 and has said he
passed on to the I louse Clerk reports of Foley's ad
vances on pages.
Kolbe is one of only a few MB As in Congress.
He was a classmate of the current GSB dean
Robert Joss.
My fellow members of Congress think Fmnuts
to have an MBA from Stanford and not be out
using it to make money," Kolbe joked during a 2002
V ii Sl * l°n ampUS " 1111 P °112 the degree and 1 use
the skills 1 learned in business school, but it didn't
create a fast track to Washington."



Thirteen members of Congress call Stanford
their Alma Mater. From California to Illinois, there are eight rep
resentatives and five senators. The Daily profiled each member. Some were
effusive with their time and graciously offered interviews while others de
clined to be interviewed, citing time constraints and campaigning ahead of
the Nov. 7 election. Some came here as impressionable undergraduates,
others as hardened law, business or engineering students. All have made
the transition, from The Farm to The Hill.
This section originally appeared in full as a special pullout on Nov. 3.

Jeff Bingaman (D- NM) [topj

Long after his Stanford Law School days of
going for cheeseburgers and beer at what he
called "Zot's," Sen. Jeff Bingaman became a De
mocratic Senator in New Mexico. Bingaman has
been repeatedly re-elected since his first victory
in 1982.
He received his B.A. in government from
1 iarvard University and came to Stanford for his
law degree.
The senator married a law classmate. Anne
Kovacovich, with whom he has one son. He said
his greatest accomplishment at Stanford was
"probably finding my wife and marrying her."
Doug Barton, who attended Stanford with
Bingaman and currently practices law in San
Francisco, recalled how Bingaman's peers
thought highly of him.
"Jeff is an extraordinarily engaging guy," he
said. "He's got a great sense of humor, very dry
sense of humor, and he was just a great friend
and very widely admired in our class."
Law classmate and friend Jim Holden, also a
lawyer in San Francisco, agreed with Barton's
seniiment.
"He's always had a self-effacing, thoughtful,
calm personality, and being a Senator, he's still
self-effacing, down-to-earth and has a thought
ful personality." he said. "That's really wonderful
because sometimes, I think power goes to the
head of those in Congress and the Senate, but
not for him."
Barton recalled that Bingaman served as a
Stern Resident Assistant, at a time when law stu
dents could take the job to earn extra money.
Bingaman also participated in mock trial activi
ties.
" I was active in the moot court competition at
the Law School," Bingaman said. "We basically
practiced appellate arguments on different legal
cases that we brought up."
Barton remembered a classic moment from

one mock trial with Bingaman.
"1 remember that there was a murder case,
and he represented the defense and I represent
ed the prosecution. I remember us arguing be
fore the jury of the Stanford law students. He
said 'surely you jest,' and that was his character
ization of our argument."
Law school buddies hung out at the Dutch
Goose.
'it was a beer establishment," Barton said. "It
was a favorite hangout for Stanford students,
and became one for the law students in particu
lar. We could go out and drink beer and shoot
some pool. We took some road trips. We'd have
long philosophical discussions. It was clear at
that time he was quite interested in politics, so
we talked about that a lot."
Holden noted that one such trip went awry.
"I remember driving over to San Gregorio
Beach, and the gas fumes almost aborted Sen.
Bingaman's life," he said. "He was just getting
gassed in the back seat. The gas fumes were so
bad that Senator Bingaman was turning green in
the back seat."
Holden also commented on how Bingaman
was looking ahead to a political career even as a
student.
"He was interested in politics at that time,
and 1 think he thought he would be a senator.
I m not sure that any of the rest of us thought he
would be a senator just because the chances are
fairly remote."
Upon graduation. Bingaman returned to
New Mexico to practice law and became New
Mexico Attorney General in 1978. He said that
his choice of career stemmed from a lifelong in
terest in politics.
"1 had always been interested in politics and
government," he said. "Growing up. I had an
uncle who was very involved in politics in New
Mexico, not as a candidate, but as an active party
member. That sort of piqued my interest as a
young person."
Bingaman currently serves as Ranking Mem

berof the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. He has worked to devote federal
funds to solar energy research and recently intro
duced several bi-partisan bills to reduce the na
tion s dependence on oil and natural gas.
"I've tried in the Energy Committee to move
us toward more use of clean energy in the coun
try. more development of alternative energy and
more emphasis on efficiency in the use of ener
gy," he said. "Also. I've been trying to get the nec
essary support to begin controlling greenhouse
gas emission nationwide."
He serves as Ranking Member of the Sub
committee on International Trade on the Fi
nance Committee. He is also a Senior Member
of the Joint Economic Committee, as well as a
member of the Subcommittee on Health Care
and the Subcommittee on Social Security and
Family Policy, and the Health,Education,Labor,
and Pensions Committee.
"I've also spent a lot of time on healthcare is
sues through the Finance Committee and
through the Health and Education Committee,
trying to expand access to healthcare and resist
cuts in healthcare funding." Bingaman said.
"And I've been quite involved in trying to im
prove academic standards in our schools."
Bingaman has been an advocate for funding
for Border Patrol agents, surveillance cameras
and vehicle barriers. He has worked to devote
resources to youth dropout prevention, drug
courts and rehabilitation and treatment service.
He has condemned secrecy surrounding de
tained terrorist suspects and supports due
process as well as bans on degrading prisoner
treatment.
Polls predict Bingaman will easily win re
election again in 2006. but he expressed uncer
tainty about the success of Democratic candi
dates in general.
"I don't think it's clear if we'll regain control
over the Senate or not." he said. "I think we'll
pick up seats, but I don't know if we'll win a ma
jority."

David Wu (D-OR-l) [bottom left]

As an undergrad. Rep. David
Wu's proudest achievement was a
weekly ritual. Upon finding out that
the medical school library opened at
S a.m. on Sundays, the future con
gressman resolved to study there
every weekend.
"No matter how late 1 stayed up. I
made sure I was there when the door
opened." he said. "It was my way of
disciplining the weekend."
Wu. a Democrat who represents
Oregon's First District, sits on the
House Education Committee and
the Science Committee.
After graduating from Stanford
in 1977 with a B.S. in Biology, Wu at
tended Harvard Medical School be
fore deciding to pursue a J.D. at Yale,
lie represented Oregon's technolo
gy sector in its fast-developing
Northwest region and parlayed a
decade of legal experience into a
congressional win in 1998.
Recalling his favorite Stanford
memory, the Congressman men
tioned his time as a photographer for
The Daily but ultimately settled on a
recollection of the campus's vernal
ambiance.
"Around the Stanford campus in
the springtime, the birds sinu into the

night and you can smell flowers all
night long." he reminisced. "Some
times you're just cruising from one
place to another and you have that
scent in the air. It still strikes me as
the single coolest memory."
Wu is the only Taiwanese-Amer
ican in Congress. lie made the deci
sion to enter public service after a
lifetime of seeing public decisions
impact his family. Wu's mother and
her children had to wait six years to
follow his father to America due to
restrictive immigration laws, arriv
ing only after the system was re
formed by John F. Kennedy in 1961.
At a poor public high school in
southern California, he watched
the rising costs of the University of
California schools deter many of
his classmates from attending col
lege.
Wu is widely expected to win his
fifth term on Tuesday. He faces a re
election challenge from two-term
Republican state legislator Derrick
Kitts. The Oregonian recently re
ported that Wu had his rival "out
matched." raising $1.3 million in the
election period ending September 30
to Kitts's $210,000.
Nevertheless, the incumbent says
he is taking the election very serious
ly.
"I've been pounding the pave

ment for a month and I'll be back in
Oregon tomorrow." Wu said from
Washington, where he celebrated his
wife's birthday.
"1 don't make predictions because
I tend to be lousy at it,"he added.
"You take care of the fundamentals
— you block, you tackle, you play as
hard as you can — then the score's
the score when the clock runs out."
Although reluctant to call his own
race, Wu was optimistic about the
Democrats' chances nationally.
"This is probably the best
prospect I've seen in my eight years
of restoring real checks and balances
to the system," he said.
After the election, the 109 th Con
gress will reconvene for its lame duck
session — a period for which Wu
says he is "boundlessly optimistic."
His biggest project for that session
is the shepherding of a healthcare in
formation technology bill through
the Science Committee. The bill. Wu
says, would fund health care IT re
search. train experts in both fields
and "start the process of developing
standards so that different computers
can talk with each other in the health
care arena." He said it holds the pos
sibility of reducing some of the indus
try's spiraling costs by making infor
mation sharing among medical insti
tutions more efficient.

Zoe Lofgren (D-CA-16) [bottom right]

Between late night talks with her
roommate and having trouble pick
ing a major. Congresswoman Zoe
Lofgren's (D-CA) Stanford experi
ence was pretty typical.
But Lofgren. who earned a B.A.
in political science in 1970 and cur
rently represents San Jose and Cali
fornia's 16th District in the U.S.
House of Representatives, also re
called experiences unique to her
generation.
One of Lofgren's most vivid Stan
ford memories was the tear gassing
of her dorm.
"It was the '60s, so it was a tumul
tuous time," she said. "There were
demonstrations on campus because
the Vietnam War was going on. In a
lot of ways it was a frightening time."
Lofgren lived in Branner Hall her
freshman year, which was then all-fe
male housing. She described how the
residents of Wilbur Hall, all fresh
men boys, "stormed Branner Hall in
a traditional panty raid."
"I think it was the last panty raid,"
she said. "The next year, there were
co-ed dorms and everything
changed."
Although Lofgren acknowledged
that her campus impact and involve

ment were minimal — ,- l wasn't very
much for joining things." she said
she did study in Britain for six
months.
While abroad, she worked with po
litical science Prof. Ray Wolfinger.now
at UC-Berkeley. to conduct the first
public opinion poll in the Midlands,
which she rated as one of her most
valuable experiences at Stanford.
"When 1 was there, they had a
mansion in the middle of the Mid
lands." she said. "It was definitely an
interesting experience."
Lofgren said that deciding to
major in political science was "really
rather random."
"We weren't as organized as your
generation." she said."l'm the first in
my family to go to college, so I got a
scholarship and 1 really didn't know
what 1 was doing. As I got closer to
graduation. 1 realized I needed to
pick a major, so I picked the one 1

Mexico, not as a candidate, but as an active party
member. That sort of piqued my interest as a
young person."
Bingaman currently serves as Ranking Mem

berof the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. He has worked to devote federal
funds to solar energy research and recently intro
duced several bi-partisan bills to reduce the na
tion s dependence on oil and natural gas.
"I've tried in the Energy Committee to move
us toward more use of clean energy in the coun
try. more development of alternative energy and
more emphasis on efficiency in the use of ener
gy," he said. "Also. I've been trying to get the nec
essary support to begin controlling greenhouse
gas emission nationwide."
He serves as Ranking Member of the Sub
committee on International Trade on the Fi
nance Committee. He is also a Senior Member
of the Joint Economic Committee, as well as a
member of the Subcommittee on Health Care
and the Subcommittee on Social Security and
Family Policy, and the Health,Education,Labor,
and Pensions Committee.
"I've also spent a lot of time on healthcare is
sues through the Finance Committee and
through the Health and Education Committee,
trying to expand access to healthcare and resist
cuts in healthcare funding." Bingaman said.
"And I've been quite involved in trying to im
prove academic standards in our schools."
Bingaman has been an advocate for funding
for Border Patrol agents, surveillance cameras
and vehicle barriers. He has worked to devote
resources to youth dropout prevention, drug
courts and rehabilitation and treatment service.
He has condemned secrecy surrounding de
tained terrorist suspects and supports due
process as well as bans on degrading prisoner
treatment.
Polls predict Bingaman will easily win re
election again in 2006. but he expressed uncer
tainty about the success of Democratic candi
dates in general.
"I don't think it's clear if we'll regain control
over the Senate or not." he said. "I think we'll
pick up seats, but I don't know if we'll win a ma
jority."

David Wu (D-OR-l) [bottom left]

As an undergrad. Rep. David
Wu's proudest achievement was a
weekly ritual. Upon finding out that
the medical school library opened at
S a.m. on Sundays, the future con
gressman resolved to study there
every weekend.
"No matter how late 1 stayed up. I
made sure I was there when the door
opened." he said. "It was my way of
disciplining the weekend."
Wu. a Democrat who represents
Oregon's First District, sits on the
House Education Committee and
the Science Committee.
After graduating from Stanford
in 1977 with a B.S. in Biology, Wu at
tended Harvard Medical School be
fore deciding to pursue a J.D. at Yale,
lie represented Oregon's technolo
gy sector in its fast-developing
Northwest region and parlayed a
decade of legal experience into a
congressional win in 1998.
Recalling his favorite Stanford
memory, the Congressman men
tioned his time as a photographer for
The Daily but ultimately settled on a
recollection of the campus's vernal
ambiance.
"Around the Stanford campus in
the springtime, the birds sinu into the

night and you can smell flowers all
night long." he reminisced. "Some
times you're just cruising from one
place to another and you have that
scent in the air. It still strikes me as
the single coolest memory."
Wu is the only Taiwanese-Amer
ican in Congress. lie made the deci
sion to enter public service after a
lifetime of seeing public decisions
impact his family. Wu's mother and
her children had to wait six years to
follow his father to America due to
restrictive immigration laws, arriv
ing only after the system was re
formed by John F. Kennedy in 1961.
At a poor public high school in
southern California, he watched
the rising costs of the University of
California schools deter many of
his classmates from attending col
lege.
Wu is widely expected to win his
fifth term on Tuesday. He faces a re
election challenge from two-term
Republican state legislator Derrick
Kitts. The Oregonian recently re
ported that Wu had his rival "out
matched." raising $1.3 million in the
election period ending September 30
to Kitts's $210,000.
Nevertheless, the incumbent says
he is taking the election very serious
ly.
"I've been pounding the pave

ment for a month and I'll be back in
Oregon tomorrow." Wu said from
Washington, where he celebrated his
wife's birthday.
"1 don't make predictions because
I tend to be lousy at it,"he added.
"You take care of the fundamentals
— you block, you tackle, you play as
hard as you can — then the score's
the score when the clock runs out."
Although reluctant to call his own
race, Wu was optimistic about the
Democrats' chances nationally.
"This is probably the best
prospect I've seen in my eight years
of restoring real checks and balances
to the system," he said.
After the election, the 109 th Con
gress will reconvene for its lame duck
session — a period for which Wu
says he is "boundlessly optimistic."
His biggest project for that session
is the shepherding of a healthcare in
formation technology bill through
the Science Committee. The bill. Wu
says, would fund health care IT re
search. train experts in both fields
and "start the process of developing
standards so that different computers
can talk with each other in the health
care arena." He said it holds the pos
sibility of reducing some of the indus
try's spiraling costs by making infor
mation sharing among medical insti
tutions more efficient.

Zoe Lofgren (D-CA-16) [bottom right]

Between late night talks with her
roommate and having trouble pick
ing a major. Congresswoman Zoe
Lofgren's (D-CA) Stanford experi
ence was pretty typical.
But Lofgren. who earned a B.A.
in political science in 1970 and cur
rently represents San Jose and Cali
fornia's 16th District in the U.S.
House of Representatives, also re
called experiences unique to her
generation.
One of Lofgren's most vivid Stan
ford memories was the tear gassing
of her dorm.
"It was the '60s, so it was a tumul
tuous time," she said. "There were
demonstrations on campus because
the Vietnam War was going on. In a
lot of ways it was a frightening time."
Lofgren lived in Branner Hall her
freshman year, which was then all-fe
male housing. She described how the
residents of Wilbur Hall, all fresh
men boys, "stormed Branner Hall in
a traditional panty raid."
"I think it was the last panty raid,"
she said. "The next year, there were
co-ed dorms and everything
changed."
Although Lofgren acknowledged
that her campus impact and involve

ment were minimal — ,- l wasn't very
much for joining things." she said
she did study in Britain for six
months.
While abroad, she worked with po
litical science Prof. Ray Wolfinger.now
at UC-Berkeley. to conduct the first
public opinion poll in the Midlands,
which she rated as one of her most
valuable experiences at Stanford.
"When 1 was there, they had a
mansion in the middle of the Mid
lands." she said. "It was definitely an
interesting experience."
Lofgren said that deciding to
major in political science was "really
rather random."
"We weren't as organized as your
generation." she said."l'm the first in
my family to go to college, so I got a
scholarship and 1 really didn't know
what 1 was doing. As I got closer to
graduation. 1 realized I needed to
pick a major, so I picked the one 1
had the most units in. which was
PoliSci."
Similarly. Lofgren's entry into
politics was not premeditated.
"I just bursted into it after I gradu
ated." she said."l went to Washington
without a job or really even a plan. I
just went there thinking 1 could do
something to make a difference."
Lofgren said she talked herself
into a job with her predecessor in

Congress and ended up working for
him for eight years. While on his staff,
she went to law school and got in
volved in local government. After
running for and holding offices in
local government, Lofgren ran for
Congress.
Lofgren said that she and the rest
of the Democratic representatives
aren't taking anything for granted in
next week's elections.
"1 know a lot of people are saying
that the Democrats will take control
[of Congress], and that is possible,
but by no means certain,"she said."lf
Democrats do regain the majority,
we have a whole agenda that we wish
to deliver."
This agenda includes a new em
phasis on science and basic research
in education, energy independence
in 10 years and full broadband de
ployment to every section of the
country within five years.'lTiese goals
comprise what Lofgren called an "in
novation agenda," a program Lof
gren unveiled at Stanford a little over
a year ago.
1 .ofgren. first elected to Congress in
1994, serves on the Committee on
1 lomeland Security,the Committee on
the Judiciary and the Committee on
House Administration. Many of her
legislative initiatives have involved en
ergy and Internet access issues.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has earned
the reputation as being one of the Sen
ate's most effective lawmakers. Widely
considered the matriarch of California
politics, the senior senator from the Gold
en State has enjoyed a storied political ca
reer spanning five decades at the local
and national levels.
Feinstein was first elected to the Sen
ate in a 1992 special election. In 14 years
in Congress's upper chamber, Feinstein
has earned a reputation as a pragmatic
voice of reason amidst the divisive ran
cor of Capitol Mill. Though a staunch
supporter of such traditional liberal
causes as gun control and abortion
rights, 112 einstein has gained respect from
both sides of the aisle for her willingness
to seek political compromise and bipar
tisan solutions.
A San Francisco native, Feinstein
graduated from the University in 1955
with a degree in History. At Stanford, Fe
instein served as president of Roble I fall,
and was later elected vice president of the
student body
"Dianne was such a lovely person to
everyone." recalled alumna Carole Cole.

who lived with Feinstein as a freshman in
Roble. "It was obvious to all of us that
she was going to be a leader."
Feinstein first held major political of
fice in 1969. when she was elected to the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She
became mayor when, as the president of
the Board of Supervisors, Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
were assassinated in Nov. 1978. In doing
so. Feinstein became the first female
mayor of a large American city. She was
thereafter reelected to two full terms.
Feinstein inspired significant praise
and incurred some criticism from Demo
cratic pundits for her decision not to
enter the gubernatorial recall election of
2003. a race many believed she would
win. Feinstein had survived a 19K4 recall
attempt in her own right as San Francis
co mayor.
Feinstein is thought to have been con
sidered as a running mate by then-Vice
President Al Gore during his run for the
presidency in 2000. before Gore settled
on Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
As a long-serving senator, Feinstein is
privileged to serve on five permanent
committees. As the only female on the Ju
diciary Committee, she garnered close
attention for her deliberation during the

confirmation hearings of Chief Justice
John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito,
Jr. Feinstein ultimately voted against
both nominees.
Feinstein invoked her time at the
University during the Roberts hearing,
when she insisted that the nominee take
a firm position on abortion.
"As a college student at Stanford. 1
watched the passing of the plate to col
lect money so a young woman could
go to Tijuana for a back-alley abor
tion," she said.
Feinstein was the Democratic spon
sor of a failed Constitutional Amend
ment to ban tlag-burning this summer.
Though her championing of this issue
angered some liberal supporters and
First Amendment advocates, the fallout
surrounding the failed amendment
does not seem to have affected Fein
stein's support among the general elec
torate.
With the Nov. 7 midterm elections
only four days away. Feinstein appears
poised to win her third full term. She
leads Republican challenger Richard
Mountjoy by wide margins in opinion
polls and fundraising, and has devoted
much time to campaigning on behalf of
other California politicians.

Jim Kolbe

Representative Jim Kolbe, 64, now serving his
eleventh and final term in the House of Represen
tatives, was the first Republican elected to repre
sent southern Arizona. He completed an MBA at
Stanford in 1%7 and then served in the United
States Navy during the Vietnam War. before serv
ing as Arizona State Senator from 1976-82.
For Kolbe, his strongest memory of Stanford
was his first day on campus.
"1 had not been on the Stanford campus before.
I had applied to Stanford for my undergraduate de
gree, been accepted, but then chose to go to North
western for my 8.A.," Kolbe said. "So arriving at
Stanford on a perfect September Saturday with a
football game in the afternoon brought a huge
dawning realization to me: I had spent four years in
the Chicago climate when 1 could have been at
Stanford all that time!"
Kolbe recalled taking advantage of campus life,
so much so that he deemed graduating his greatest
achievement at The Farm.
"1 had such a good time and was so active in so
many activities that I proudly say I graduated from
the Stanford GSB in the top 95 percent of my
class," Kolbe said.
Kolbe's introduction to public service was as a
page for Senator Barry Goldwater, the 1%4 Re
publican nominee for president and long-time Ari

zona senator. I lis experiences at the University so
lidified his interest in both public service and the
political arena, since he was involved with campus
politics and in Ronald Reagan's first campaign for
governor in 1%6.
Kolbe left the University with "nothing but
great memories."
Stanlord was a very important formative part
ot my younger life,' he said. "When 1 go back now,
I long wistfully tor the days when there were actu
ally citrus orchards in Mountain View and Sunny
vale."
During his linal term in the House, Kolbe said
his main priority was getting his Foreign Opera
tions Appropriation enacted into law.
Analysts expect Kolbe's seat to fall into Demo
cratic hands alter next Tuesday's election. The twi
light ol Kolbe s career has been dimmed by the
firestorm over the Mark Foley scandal. Kolbe was
chair of the page board in 2000 and has said he
passed on to the I louse Clerk reports of Foley's ad
vances on pages.
Kolbe is one of only a few MB As in Congress.
He was a classmate of the current GSB dean
Robert Joss.
My fellow members of Congress think Fmnuts
to have an MBA from Stanford and not be out
using it to make money," Kolbe joked during a 2002
V ii Sl * l°n ampUS " 1111 P °112 the degree and 1 use
the skills 1 learned in business school, but it didn't
create a fast track to Washington."



Thirteen members of Congress call Stanford
their Alma Mater. From California to Illinois, there are eight rep
resentatives and five senators. The Daily profiled each member. Some were
effusive with their time and graciously offered interviews while others de
clined to be interviewed, citing time constraints and campaigning ahead of
the Nov. 7 election. Some came here as impressionable undergraduates,
others as hardened law, business or engineering students. All have made
the transition, from The Farm to The Hill.
This section originally appeared in full as a special pullout on Nov. 3.

Jeff Bingaman (D- NM) [topj

Long after his Stanford Law School days of
going for cheeseburgers and beer at what he
called "Zot's," Sen. Jeff Bingaman became a De
mocratic Senator in New Mexico. Bingaman has
been repeatedly re-elected since his first victory
in 1982.
He received his B.A. in government from
1 iarvard University and came to Stanford for his
law degree.
The senator married a law classmate. Anne
Kovacovich, with whom he has one son. He said
his greatest accomplishment at Stanford was
"probably finding my wife and marrying her."
Doug Barton, who attended Stanford with
Bingaman and currently practices law in San
Francisco, recalled how Bingaman's peers
thought highly of him.
"Jeff is an extraordinarily engaging guy," he
said. "He's got a great sense of humor, very dry
sense of humor, and he was just a great friend
and very widely admired in our class."
Law classmate and friend Jim Holden, also a
lawyer in San Francisco, agreed with Barton's
seniiment.
"He's always had a self-effacing, thoughtful,
calm personality, and being a Senator, he's still
self-effacing, down-to-earth and has a thought
ful personality." he said. "That's really wonderful
because sometimes, I think power goes to the
head of those in Congress and the Senate, but
not for him."
Barton recalled that Bingaman served as a
Stern Resident Assistant, at a time when law stu
dents could take the job to earn extra money.
Bingaman also participated in mock trial activi
ties.
" I was active in the moot court competition at
the Law School," Bingaman said. "We basically
practiced appellate arguments on different legal
cases that we brought up."
Barton remembered a classic moment from

one mock trial with Bingaman.
"1 remember that there was a murder case,
and he represented the defense and I represent
ed the prosecution. I remember us arguing be
fore the jury of the Stanford law students. He
said 'surely you jest,' and that was his character
ization of our argument."
Law school buddies hung out at the Dutch
Goose.
'it was a beer establishment," Barton said. "It
was a favorite hangout for Stanford students,
and became one for the law students in particu
lar. We could go out and drink beer and shoot
some pool. We took some road trips. We'd have
long philosophical discussions. It was clear at
that time he was quite interested in politics, so
we talked about that a lot."
Holden noted that one such trip went awry.
"I remember driving over to San Gregorio
Beach, and the gas fumes almost aborted Sen.
Bingaman's life," he said. "He was just getting
gassed in the back seat. The gas fumes were so
bad that Senator Bingaman was turning green in
the back seat."
Holden also commented on how Bingaman
was looking ahead to a political career even as a
student.
"He was interested in politics at that time,
and 1 think he thought he would be a senator.
I m not sure that any of the rest of us thought he
would be a senator just because the chances are
fairly remote."
Upon graduation. Bingaman returned to
New Mexico to practice law and became New
Mexico Attorney General in 1978. He said that
his choice of career stemmed from a lifelong in
terest in politics.
"1 had always been interested in politics and
government," he said. "Growing up. I had an
uncle who was very involved in politics in New
Mexico, not as a candidate, but as an active party
member. That sort of piqued my interest as a
young person."
Bingaman currently serves as Ranking Mem

berof the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. He has worked to devote federal
funds to solar energy research and recently intro
duced several bi-partisan bills to reduce the na
tion s dependence on oil and natural gas.
"I've tried in the Energy Committee to move
us toward more use of clean energy in the coun
try. more development of alternative energy and
more emphasis on efficiency in the use of ener
gy," he said. "Also. I've been trying to get the nec
essary support to begin controlling greenhouse
gas emission nationwide."
He serves as Ranking Member of the Sub
committee on International Trade on the Fi
nance Committee. He is also a Senior Member
of the Joint Economic Committee, as well as a
member of the Subcommittee on Health Care
and the Subcommittee on Social Security and
Family Policy, and the Health,Education,Labor,
and Pensions Committee.
"I've also spent a lot of time on healthcare is
sues through the Finance Committee and
through the Health and Education Committee,
trying to expand access to healthcare and resist
cuts in healthcare funding." Bingaman said.
"And I've been quite involved in trying to im
prove academic standards in our schools."
Bingaman has been an advocate for funding
for Border Patrol agents, surveillance cameras
and vehicle barriers. He has worked to devote
resources to youth dropout prevention, drug
courts and rehabilitation and treatment service.
He has condemned secrecy surrounding de
tained terrorist suspects and supports due
process as well as bans on degrading prisoner
treatment.
Polls predict Bingaman will easily win re
election again in 2006. but he expressed uncer
tainty about the success of Democratic candi
dates in general.
"I don't think it's clear if we'll regain control
over the Senate or not." he said. "I think we'll

John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito,
Jr. Feinstein ultimately voted against
both nominees.
Feinstein invoked her time at the
University during the Roberts hearing,
when she insisted that the nominee take
a firm position on abortion.
"As a college student at Stanford. 1
watched the passing of the plate to col
lect money so a young woman could
go to Tijuana for a back-alley abor
tion," she said.
Feinstein was the Democratic spon
sor of a failed Constitutional Amend
ment to ban tlag-burning this summer.
Though her championing of this issue
angered some liberal supporters and
First Amendment advocates, the fallout
surrounding the failed amendment
does not seem to have affected Fein
stein's support among the general elec
torate.
With the Nov. 7 midterm elections
only four days away. Feinstein appears
poised to win her third full term. She
leads Republican challenger Richard
Mountjoy by wide margins in opinion
polls and fundraising, and has devoted
much time to campaigning on behalf of
other California politicians.

Jim Kolbe

Representative Jim Kolbe, 64, now serving his
eleventh and final term in the House of Represen
tatives, was the first Republican elected to repre
sent southern Arizona. He completed an MBA at
Stanford in 1%7 and then served in the United
States Navy during the Vietnam War. before serv
ing as Arizona State Senator from 1976-82.
For Kolbe, his strongest memory of Stanford
was his first day on campus.
"1 had not been on the Stanford campus before.
I had applied to Stanford for my undergraduate de
gree, been accepted, but then chose to go to North
western for my 8.A.," Kolbe said. "So arriving at
Stanford on a perfect September Saturday with a
football game in the afternoon brought a huge
dawning realization to me: I had spent four years in
the Chicago climate when 1 could have been at
Stanford all that time!"
Kolbe recalled taking advantage of campus life,
so much so that he deemed graduating his greatest
achievement at The Farm.
"1 had such a good time and was so active in so
many activities that I proudly say I graduated from
the Stanford GSB in the top 95 percent of my
class," Kolbe said.
Kolbe's introduction to public service was as a
page for Senator Barry Goldwater, the 1%4 Re
publican nominee for president and long-time Ari

zona senator. I lis experiences at the University so
lidified his interest in both public service and the
political arena, since he was involved with campus
politics and in Ronald Reagan's first campaign for
governor in 1%6.
Kolbe left the University with "nothing but
great memories."
Stanlord was a very important formative part
ot my younger life,' he said. "When 1 go back now,
I long wistfully tor the days when there were actu
ally citrus orchards in Mountain View and Sunny
vale."
During his linal term in the House, Kolbe said
his main priority was getting his Foreign Opera
tions Appropriation enacted into law.
Analysts expect Kolbe's seat to fall into Demo
cratic hands alter next Tuesday's election. The twi
light ol Kolbe s career has been dimmed by the
firestorm over the Mark Foley scandal. Kolbe was
chair of the page board in 2000 and has said he
passed on to the I louse Clerk reports of Foley's ad
vances on pages.
Kolbe is one of only a few MB As in Congress.
He was a classmate of the current GSB dean
Robert Joss.
My fellow members of Congress think Fmnuts
to have an MBA from Stanford and not be out
using it to make money," Kolbe joked during a 2002
V ii Sl * l°n ampUS " 1111 P °112 the degree and 1 use
the skills 1 learned in business school, but it didn't
create a fast track to Washington."



Thirteen members of Congress call Stanford
their Alma Mater. From California to Illinois, there are eight rep
resentatives and five senators. The Daily profiled each member. Some were
effusive with their time and graciously offered interviews while others de
clined to be interviewed, citing time constraints and campaigning ahead of
the Nov. 7 election. Some came here as impressionable undergraduates,
others as hardened law, business or engineering students. All have made
the transition, from The Farm to The Hill.
This section originally appeared in full as a special pullout on Nov. 3.

Jeff Bingaman (D- NM) [topj

Long after his Stanford Law School days of
going for cheeseburgers and beer at what he
called "Zot's," Sen. Jeff Bingaman became a De
mocratic Senator in New Mexico. Bingaman has
been repeatedly re-elected since his first victory
in 1982.
He received his B.A. in government from
1 iarvard University and came to Stanford for his
law degree.
The senator married a law classmate. Anne
Kovacovich, with whom he has one son. He said
his greatest accomplishment at Stanford was
"probably finding my wife and marrying her."
Doug Barton, who attended Stanford with
Bingaman and currently practices law in San
Francisco, recalled how Bingaman's peers
thought highly of him.
"Jeff is an extraordinarily engaging guy," he
said. "He's got a great sense of humor, very dry
sense of humor, and he was just a great friend
and very widely admired in our class."
Law classmate and friend Jim Holden, also a
lawyer in San Francisco, agreed with Barton's
seniiment.
"He's always had a self-effacing, thoughtful,
calm personality, and being a Senator, he's still
self-effacing, down-to-earth and has a thought
ful personality." he said. "That's really wonderful
because sometimes, I think power goes to the
head of those in Congress and the Senate, but
not for him."
Barton recalled that Bingaman served as a
Stern Resident Assistant, at a time when law stu
dents could take the job to earn extra money.
Bingaman also participated in mock trial activi
ties.
" I was active in the moot court competition at
the Law School," Bingaman said. "We basically
practiced appellate arguments on different legal
cases that we brought up."
Barton remembered a classic moment from

one mock trial with Bingaman.
"1 remember that there was a murder case,
and he represented the defense and I represent
ed the prosecution. I remember us arguing be
fore the jury of the Stanford law students. He
said 'surely you jest,' and that was his character
ization of our argument."
Law school buddies hung out at the Dutch
Goose.
'it was a beer establishment," Barton said. "It
was a favorite hangout for Stanford students,
and became one for the law students in particu
lar. We could go out and drink beer and shoot
some pool. We took some road trips. We'd have
long philosophical discussions. It was clear at
that time he was quite interested in politics, so
we talked about that a lot."
Holden noted that one such trip went awry.
"I remember driving over to San Gregorio
Beach, and the gas fumes almost aborted Sen.
Bingaman's life," he said. "He was just getting
gassed in the back seat. The gas fumes were so
bad that Senator Bingaman was turning green in
the back seat."
Holden also commented on how Bingaman
was looking ahead to a political career even as a
student.
"He was interested in politics at that time,
and 1 think he thought he would be a senator.
I m not sure that any of the rest of us thought he
would be a senator just because the chances are
fairly remote."
Upon graduation. Bingaman returned to
New Mexico to practice law and became New
Mexico Attorney General in 1978. He said that
his choice of career stemmed from a lifelong in
terest in politics.
"1 had always been interested in politics and
government," he said. "Growing up. I had an
uncle who was very involved in politics in New
Mexico, not as a candidate, but as an active party
member. That sort of piqued my interest as a
young person."
Bingaman currently serves as Ranking Mem

berof the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. He has worked to devote federal
funds to solar energy research and recently intro
duced several bi-partisan bills to reduce the na
tion s dependence on oil and natural gas.
"I've tried in the Energy Committee to move
us toward more use of clean energy in the coun
try. more development of alternative energy and
more emphasis on efficiency in the use of ener
gy," he said. "Also. I've been trying to get the nec
essary support to begin controlling greenhouse
gas emission nationwide."
He serves as Ranking Member of the Sub
committee on International Trade on the Fi
nance Committee. He is also a Senior Member
of the Joint Economic Committee, as well as a
member of the Subcommittee on Health Care
and the Subcommittee on Social Security and
Family Policy, and the Health,Education,Labor,
and Pensions Committee.
"I've also spent a lot of time on healthcare is
sues through the Finance Committee and
through the Health and Education Committee,
trying to expand access to healthcare and resist
cuts in healthcare funding." Bingaman said.
"And I've been quite involved in trying to im
prove academic standards in our schools."
Bingaman has been an advocate for funding
for Border Patrol agents, surveillance cameras
and vehicle barriers. He has worked to devote
resources to youth dropout prevention, drug
courts and rehabilitation and treatment service.
He has condemned secrecy surrounding de
tained terrorist suspects and supports due
process as well as bans on degrading prisoner
treatment.
Polls predict Bingaman will easily win re
election again in 2006. but he expressed uncer
tainty about the success of Democratic candi
dates in general.
"I don't think it's clear if we'll regain control
over the Senate or not." he said. "I think we'll
pick up seats, but I don't know if we'll win a ma
jority."

David Wu (D-OR-l) [bottom left]

As an undergrad. Rep. David
Wu's proudest achievement was a
weekly ritual. Upon finding out that
the medical school library opened at
S a.m. on Sundays, the future con
gressman resolved to study there
every weekend.
"No matter how late 1 stayed up. I
made sure I was there when the door
opened." he said. "It was my way of
disciplining the weekend."
Wu. a Democrat who represents
Oregon's First District, sits on the
House Education Committee and
the Science Committee.
After graduating from Stanford
in 1977 with a B.S. in Biology, Wu at
tended Harvard Medical School be
fore deciding to pursue a J.D. at Yale,
lie represented Oregon's technolo
gy sector in its fast-developing
Northwest region and parlayed a
decade of legal experience into a
congressional win in 1998.
Recalling his favorite Stanford
memory, the Congressman men
tioned his time as a photographer for
The Daily but ultimately settled on a
recollection of the campus's vernal
ambiance.
"Around the Stanford campus in
the springtime, the birds sinu into the

night and you can smell flowers all
night long." he reminisced. "Some
times you're just cruising from one
place to another and you have that
scent in the air. It still strikes me as
the single coolest memory."
Wu is the only Taiwanese-Amer
ican in Congress. lie made the deci
sion to enter public service after a
lifetime of seeing public decisions
impact his family. Wu's mother and
her children had to wait six years to
follow his father to America due to
restrictive immigration laws, arriv
ing only after the system was re
formed by John F. Kennedy in 1961.
At a poor public high school in
southern California, he watched
the rising costs of the University of
California schools deter many of
his classmates from attending col
lege.
Wu is widely expected to win his
fifth term on Tuesday. He faces a re
election challenge from two-term
Republican state legislator Derrick
Kitts. The Oregonian recently re
ported that Wu had his rival "out
matched." raising $1.3 million in the
election period ending September 30
to Kitts's $210,000.
Nevertheless, the incumbent says
he is taking the election very serious
ly.
"I've been pounding the pave

ment for a month and I'll be back in
Oregon tomorrow." Wu said from
Washington, where he celebrated his
wife's birthday.
"1 don't make predictions because
I tend to be lousy at it,"he added.
"You take care of the fundamentals
— you block, you tackle, you play as
hard as you can — then the score's
the score when the clock runs out."
Although reluctant to call his own
race, Wu was optimistic about the
Democrats' chances nationally.
"This is probably the best
prospect I've seen in my eight years
of restoring real checks and balances
to the system," he said.
After the election, the 109 th Con
gress will reconvene for its lame duck
session — a period for which Wu
says he is "boundlessly optimistic."
His biggest project for that session
is the shepherding of a healthcare in
formation technology bill through
the Science Committee. The bill. Wu
says, would fund health care IT re
search. train experts in both fields
and "start the process of developing
standards so that different computers
can talk with each other in the health
care arena." He said it holds the pos
sibility of reducing some of the indus
try's spiraling costs by making infor
mation sharing among medical insti
tutions more efficient.

Zoe Lofgren (D-CA-16) [bottom right]

Between late night talks with her
roommate and having trouble pick
ing a major. Congresswoman Zoe
Lofgren's (D-CA) Stanford experi
ence was pretty typical.
But Lofgren. who earned a B.A.
in political science in 1970 and cur
rently represents San Jose and Cali
fornia's 16th District in the U.S.
House of Representatives, also re
called experiences unique to her
generation.
One of Lofgren's most vivid Stan
ford memories was the tear gassing
of her dorm.
"It was the '60s, so it was a tumul
tuous time," she said. "There were
demonstrations on campus because
the Vietnam War was going on. In a
lot of ways it was a frightening time."
Lofgren lived in Branner Hall her
freshman year, which was then all-fe
male housing. She described how the
residents of Wilbur Hall, all fresh
men boys, "stormed Branner Hall in
a traditional panty raid."
"I think it was the last panty raid,"
she said. "The next year, there were
co-ed dorms and everything
changed."
Although Lofgren acknowledged
that her campus impact and involve

ment were minimal — ,- l wasn't very
much for joining things." she said
she did study in Britain for six
months.
While abroad, she worked with po
litical science Prof. Ray Wolfinger.now
at UC-Berkeley. to conduct the first
public opinion poll in the Midlands,
which she rated as one of her most
valuable experiences at Stanford.
"When 1 was there, they had a
mansion in the middle of the Mid
lands." she said. "It was definitely an
interesting experience."
Lofgren said that deciding to
major in political science was "really
rather random."
"We weren't as organized as your
generation." she said."l'm the first in
my family to go to college, so I got a
scholarship and 1 really didn't know
what 1 was doing. As I got closer to
graduation. 1 realized I needed to
pick a major, so I picked the one 1
had the most units in. which was
PoliSci."
Similarly. Lofgren's entry into
politics was not premeditated.
"I just bursted into it after I gradu
ated." she said."l went to Washington
without a job or really even a plan. I
just went there thinking 1 could do
something to make a difference."
Lofgren said she talked herself
into a job with her predecessor in

Congress and ended up working for
him for eight years. While on his staff,
she went to law school and got in
volved in local government. After
running for and holding offices in
local government, Lofgren ran for
Congress.
Lofgren said that she and the rest
of the Democratic representatives
aren't taking anything for granted in
next week's elections.
"1 know a lot of people are saying
that the Democrats will take control
[of Congress], and that is possible,
but by no means certain,"she said."lf
Democrats do regain the majority,
we have a whole agenda that we wish
to deliver."
This agenda includes a new em
phasis on science and basic research
in education, energy independence
in 10 years and full broadband de
ployment to every section of the
country within five years.'lTiese goals
comprise what Lofgren called an "in
novation agenda," a program Lof
gren unveiled at Stanford a little over
a year ago.
1 .ofgren. first elected to Congress in
1994, serves on the Committee on
1 lomeland Security,the Committee on
the Judiciary and the Committee on
House Administration. Many of her
legislative initiatives have involved en
ergy and Internet access issues.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has earned
the reputation as being one of the Sen
ate's most effective lawmakers. Widely
considered the matriarch of California
politics, the senior senator from the Gold
en State has enjoyed a storied political ca
reer spanning five decades at the local
and national levels.
Feinstein was first elected to the Sen
ate in a 1992 special election. In 14 years
in Congress's upper chamber, Feinstein
has earned a reputation as a pragmatic
voice of reason amidst the divisive ran
cor of Capitol Mill. Though a staunch
supporter of such traditional liberal
causes as gun control and abortion
rights, 112 einstein has gained respect from
both sides of the aisle for her willingness
to seek political compromise and bipar
tisan solutions.
A San Francisco native, Feinstein
graduated from the University in 1955
with a degree in History. At Stanford, Fe
instein served as president of Roble I fall,
and was later elected vice president of the
student body
"Dianne was such a lovely person to
everyone." recalled alumna Carole Cole.

who lived with Feinstein as a freshman in
Roble. "It was obvious to all of us that
she was going to be a leader."
Feinstein first held major political of
fice in 1969. when she was elected to the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She
became mayor when, as the president of
the Board of Supervisors, Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
were assassinated in Nov. 1978. In doing
so. Feinstein became the first female
mayor of a large American city. She was
thereafter reelected to two full terms.
Feinstein inspired significant praise
and incurred some criticism from Demo
cratic pundits for her decision not to
enter the gubernatorial recall election of
2003. a race many believed she would
win. Feinstein had survived a 19K4 recall
attempt in her own right as San Francis
co mayor.
Feinstein is thought to have been con
sidered as a running mate by then-Vice
President Al Gore during his run for the
presidency in 2000. before Gore settled
on Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
As a long-serving senator, Feinstein is
privileged to serve on five permanent
committees. As the only female on the Ju
diciary Committee, she garnered close
attention for her deliberation during the

confirmation hearings of Chief Justice
John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito,
Jr. Feinstein ultimately voted against
both nominees.
Feinstein invoked her time at the
University during the Roberts hearing,
when she insisted that the nominee take
a firm position on abortion.
"As a college student at Stanford. 1
watched the passing of the plate to col
lect money so a young woman could
go to Tijuana for a back-alley abor
tion," she said.
Feinstein was the Democratic spon
sor of a failed Constitutional Amend
ment to ban tlag-burning this summer.
Though her championing of this issue
angered some liberal supporters and
First Amendment advocates, the fallout
surrounding the failed amendment
does not seem to have affected Fein
stein's support among the general elec
torate.
With the Nov. 7 midterm elections
only four days away. Feinstein appears
poised to win her third full term. She
leads Republican challenger Richard
Mountjoy by wide margins in opinion
polls and fundraising, and has devoted
much time to campaigning on behalf of
other California politicians.

matched." raising $1.3 million in the
election period ending September 30
to Kitts's $210,000.
Nevertheless, the incumbent says
he is taking the election very serious
ly.
"I've been pounding the pave

ment for a month and I'll be back in
Oregon tomorrow." Wu said from
Washington, where he celebrated his
wife's birthday.
"1 don't make predictions because
I tend to be lousy at it,"he added.
"You take care of the fundamentals
— you block, you tackle, you play as
hard as you can — then the score's
the score when the clock runs out."
Although reluctant to call his own
race, Wu was optimistic about the
Democrats' chances nationally.
"This is probably the best
prospect I've seen in my eight years
of restoring real checks and balances
to the system," he said.
After the election, the 109 th Con
gress will reconvene for its lame duck
session — a period for which Wu
says he is "boundlessly optimistic."
His biggest project for that session
is the shepherding of a healthcare in
formation technology bill through
the Science Committee. The bill. Wu
says, would fund health care IT re
search. train experts in both fields
and "start the process of developing
standards so that different computers
can talk with each other in the health
care arena." He said it holds the pos
sibility of reducing some of the indus
try's spiraling costs by making infor
mation sharing among medical insti
tutions more efficient.

Zoe Lofgren (D-CA-16) [bottom right]

Between late night talks with her
roommate and having trouble pick
ing a major. Congresswoman Zoe
Lofgren's (D-CA) Stanford experi
ence was pretty typical.
But Lofgren. who earned a B.A.
in political science in 1970 and cur
rently represents San Jose and Cali
fornia's 16th District in the U.S.
House of Representatives, also re
called experiences unique to her
generation.
One of Lofgren's most vivid Stan
ford memories was the tear gassing
of her dorm.
"It was the '60s, so it was a tumul
tuous time," she said. "There were
demonstrations on campus because
the Vietnam War was going on. In a
lot of ways it was a frightening time."
Lofgren lived in Branner Hall her
freshman year, which was then all-fe
male housing. She described how the
residents of Wilbur Hall, all fresh
men boys, "stormed Branner Hall in
a traditional panty raid."
"I think it was the last panty raid,"
she said. "The next year, there were
co-ed dorms and everything
changed."
Although Lofgren acknowledged
that her campus impact and involve

ment were minimal — ,- l wasn't very
much for joining things." she said
she did study in Britain for six
months.
While abroad, she worked with po
litical science Prof. Ray Wolfinger.now
at UC-Berkeley. to conduct the first
public opinion poll in the Midlands,
which she rated as one of her most
valuable experiences at Stanford.
"When 1 was there, they had a
mansion in the middle of the Mid
lands." she said. "It was definitely an
interesting experience."
Lofgren said that deciding to
major in political science was "really
rather random."
"We weren't as organized as your
generation." she said."l'm the first in
my family to go to college, so I got a
scholarship and 1 really didn't know
what 1 was doing. As I got closer to
graduation. 1 realized I needed to
pick a major, so I picked the one 1
had the most units in. which was
PoliSci."
Similarly. Lofgren's entry into
politics was not premeditated.
"I just bursted into it after I gradu
ated." she said."l went to Washington
without a job or really even a plan. I
just went there thinking 1 could do
something to make a difference."
Lofgren said she talked herself
into a job with her predecessor in

Congress and ended up working for
him for eight years. While on his staff,
she went to law school and got in
volved in local government. After
running for and holding offices in
local government, Lofgren ran for
Congress.
Lofgren said that she and the rest
of the Democratic representatives
aren't taking anything for granted in
next week's elections.
"1 know a lot of people are saying
that the Democrats will take control
[of Congress], and that is possible,
but by no means certain,"she said."lf
Democrats do regain the majority,
we have a whole agenda that we wish
to deliver."
This agenda includes a new em
phasis on science and basic research
in education, energy independence
in 10 years and full broadband de
ployment to every section of the
country within five years.'lTiese goals
comprise what Lofgren called an "in
novation agenda," a program Lof
gren unveiled at Stanford a little over
a year ago.
1 .ofgren. first elected to Congress in
1994, serves on the Committee on
1 lomeland Security,the Committee on
the Judiciary and the Committee on
House Administration. Many of her
legislative initiatives have involved en
ergy and Internet access issues.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has earned
the reputation as being one of the Sen
ate's most effective lawmakers. Widely
considered the matriarch of California
politics, the senior senator from the Gold
en State has enjoyed a storied political ca
reer spanning five decades at the local
and national levels.
Feinstein was first elected to the Sen
ate in a 1992 special election. In 14 years
in Congress's upper chamber, Feinstein
has earned a reputation as a pragmatic
voice of reason amidst the divisive ran
cor of Capitol Mill. Though a staunch
supporter of such traditional liberal
causes as gun control and abortion
rights, 112 einstein has gained respect from
both sides of the aisle for her willingness
to seek political compromise and bipar
tisan solutions.
A San Francisco native, Feinstein
graduated from the University in 1955
with a degree in History. At Stanford, Fe
instein served as president of Roble I fall,
and was later elected vice president of the
student body
"Dianne was such a lovely person to
everyone." recalled alumna Carole Cole.

who lived with Feinstein as a freshman in
Roble. "It was obvious to all of us that
she was going to be a leader."
Feinstein first held major political of
fice in 1969. when she was elected to the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She
became mayor when, as the president of
the Board of Supervisors, Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
were assassinated in Nov. 1978. In doing
so. Feinstein became the first female
mayor of a large American city. She was
thereafter reelected to two full terms.
Feinstein inspired significant praise
and incurred some criticism from Demo
cratic pundits for her decision not to
enter the gubernatorial recall election of
2003. a race many believed she would
win. Feinstein had survived a 19K4 recall
attempt in her own right as San Francis
co mayor.
Feinstein is thought to have been con
sidered as a running mate by then-Vice
President Al Gore during his run for the
presidency in 2000. before Gore settled
on Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
As a long-serving senator, Feinstein is
privileged to serve on five permanent
committees. As the only female on the Ju
diciary Committee, she garnered close
attention for her deliberation during the

confirmation hearings of Chief Justice
John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito,
Jr. Feinstein ultimately voted against
both nominees.
Feinstein invoked her time at the
University during the Roberts hearing,
when she insisted that the nominee take
a firm position on abortion.
"As a college student at Stanford. 1
watched the passing of the plate to col
lect money so a young woman could
go to Tijuana for a back-alley abor
tion," she said.
Feinstein was the Democratic spon
sor of a failed Constitutional Amend
ment to ban tlag-burning this summer.
Though her championing of this issue
angered some liberal supporters and
First Amendment advocates, the fallout
surrounding the failed amendment
does not seem to have affected Fein
stein's support among the general elec
torate.
With the Nov. 7 midterm elections
only four days away. Feinstein appears
poised to win her third full term. She
leads Republican challenger Richard
Mountjoy by wide margins in opinion
polls and fundraising, and has devoted
much time to campaigning on behalf of
other California politicians.

Jim Kolbe

Representative Jim Kolbe, 64, now serving his
eleventh and final term in the House of Represen
tatives, was the first Republican elected to repre
sent southern Arizona. He completed an MBA at
Stanford in 1%7 and then served in the United
States Navy during the Vietnam War. before serv
ing as Arizona State Senator from 1976-82.
For Kolbe, his strongest memory of Stanford
was his first day on campus.
"1 had not been on the Stanford campus before.
I had applied to Stanford for my undergraduate de
gree, been accepted, but then chose to go to North
western for my 8.A.," Kolbe said. "So arriving at
Stanford on a perfect September Saturday with a
football game in the afternoon brought a huge
dawning realization to me: I had spent four years in
the Chicago climate when 1 could have been at
Stanford all that time!"
Kolbe recalled taking advantage of campus life,
so much so that he deemed graduating his greatest
achievement at The Farm.
"1 had such a good time and was so active in so
many activities that I proudly say I graduated from
the Stanford GSB in the top 95 percent of my
class," Kolbe said.
Kolbe's introduction to public service was as a
page for Senator Barry Goldwater, the 1%4 Re
publican nominee for president and long-time Ari

zona senator. I lis experiences at the University so
lidified his interest in both public service and the
political arena, since he was involved with campus
politics and in Ronald Reagan's first campaign for
governor in 1%6.
Kolbe left the University with "nothing but
great memories."
Stanlord was a very important formative part
ot my younger life,' he said. "When 1 go back now,
I long wistfully tor the days when there were actu
ally citrus orchards in Mountain View and Sunny
vale."
During his linal term in the House, Kolbe said
his main priority was getting his Foreign Opera
tions Appropriation enacted into law.
Analysts expect Kolbe's seat to fall into Demo
cratic hands alter next Tuesday's election. The twi
light ol Kolbe s career has been dimmed by the
firestorm over the Mark Foley scandal. Kolbe was
chair of the page board in 2000 and has said he
passed on to the I louse Clerk reports of Foley's ad
vances on pages.
Kolbe is one of only a few MB As in Congress.
He was a classmate of the current GSB dean
Robert Joss.
My fellow members of Congress think Fmnuts
to have an MBA from Stanford and not be out
using it to make money," Kolbe joked during a 2002
V ii Sl * l°n ampUS " 1111 P °112 the degree and 1 use
the skills 1 learned in business school, but it didn't
create a fast track to Washington."
