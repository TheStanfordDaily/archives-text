## Black gold, a fool's errand? Petrodista Chavez claims huge oil reserves, OPEC recognition 
### CLARA LONG 
Venezuela is sitting on a gold mine. A black gold mine.
Beneath the bends of Venezuela's Orinoco River lies what
could be the world's largest deposit of tar-sand — heavy-crude pe
troleum that is more expensive to produce than conventional oil.
President Hugo Chavez has said he believes the belt could yield
300 billion barrels of petroleum.
If those reserves are certified. Venezuela could surpass
Saudi Arabia as the country with the world's largest proven oil
reserves — a quantity that the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) uses when calculating a mem
ber country's production quotas.
The South American country, which is a major supplier of
oil to the U.S. market, now claims to pump 3.2 million barrels
of crude a day. Outside sources say the production numbers
may be closer to 2.6 million barrels.
Since Chavez took office in 1998, he has tightened state
control over the oil industry, dissolving some lease contracts
with foreign oil companies in favor of mixed, state-private
partnerships. The country's tax agency has targeted foreign
firms and tightened fiscal control over profits.
T*he state oil company "doesn't really have a business strat

egy, they just have a political strategy," said David Victor, a
Stanford Law professor who studies the political economy of
energy markets.
Even with the extra supplies, there is some doubt about how
well the state oil company can manage the inevitable decline in
oil prices, which has been buoyed by geopolitical uncertainty in
the Middle East. Currently, Victor said, supply and demand are
closely matched so the possibility of price volatility is high.
The vast majority of Venezuelan oil now goes directly north
— to the United States — a country that Chavez sees as an
overreaching empire. The socialist leader has indicated he
hopes to send an increasing proportion of the country's oil to
other buyers, and he has inked new partnerships with Chinese
and Iranian oil companies.
"It used to be that Venezuela's strategy [for oil] is that the
United States is the best market," said Harold Trinkunas, a vis
iting scholar at the Center for Latin American Studies. But he
said, "Chavez has been trying to get away from a close link to
the United States."
Meanwhile, Venezuela's state oil company, Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA), has become the main source of funds
for the "socialist revolution" that Chavez says he is leading.
PDVSA's hard dollar profits go directly to programs for ed
ucation, health and other social services.
Given its new social function in Chavez's revolution,
PDVSA may be "very rapidly losing its ability to produce oil,"
said Victor.
