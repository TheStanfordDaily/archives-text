## Nuke test complicates U.S. policy 
### MICHAEL WILKERSON 
The explosion was relatively
small, but the aftershocks are still
echoing from North Korea's test of a
nuclear device on Monday.
"It will contribute to defending
the peace and stability on the Korean
Peninsula and in the area around it."
the North Koreans declared in a
press release after the apparent un
derground nuclear test.
Analysts are still trying to better
understand the test's veracity, but the
U.S. Geological Survey identified a
disturbance emanating from the Ko
rean peninsula, which measured 4.2
on the Richer Scale.
This translates to an explosion of
about one kiloton in strength, ana

lysts said, smaller than most nuclear
tests, which have ranged from 10 to
60 kilotons. line weapon may have
been purposefully small, or may have
malfunctioned, but in either case the
message from North Korea remains
the same — we have operational nu
clear technology.
And. no matter what the si/e of the
explosion, the symbolic meaning of
North Korea having the bomb has
captivated U.S.foreign policy thinkers.
"This is a serious setback for U.S.
and global nuclear non-proliferation
efforts, especially the Nuclear Non
proliferation Treaty (NPT)."said Po
litical Science Prof. Scott I). Sagan.
"This is the first time that a state has
been caught cheating on its NPT
commitments, withdrew from the

treaty and then developed an atomic
bomb."
Sagan, who has long been
adamant about the dangers of nu
clear proliferation, is director of
Stanford's ('enter for International
Security and Cooperation (CISAC)
and co-author of The Spread of Nu
clear Weapons: A Debate Renewed.
North Korea's flaunting of its nu
clear capabilities seemed to catch the
Bush administration off guard, per
haps in no small part because of the
time officials had spent focused else
where. The administration has been
bogged down in recent weeks deal
ing with Iraq, Afghanistan and the
political fallout from both.
Regional experts, however, ex
pressed less surprise about the test.

"My first reaction was that this is
not unexpected."said Gi-Wook Shin,
head of Stanford's Korean Studies
program and Director of the Walter
H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center (APARC). Shin said
that he had been expecting a test
slightly later, but definitely within
the next year.
Daniel Sneider, Associate Direc
tor of A PARC, also felt the timing
made sense. "I thought for a long
time that they wouldn't do this be
cause it's a line that once you cross it
you can't go back." he said. "But
more recently I'd come to conclude
that they figured there was more to
be gained from [testing]."
