# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Three times as nice Women go undefeated to capture third straight national championship 
### DANIEL NOVINSON MANAGING EDITOR 
As Theresa Logar's forehand volley caught the
outside edge of the backhand sideline, the junior
spiked her racquet to the ground and leapt in the
air. both fists pumped in celebration.
But in a way, the point was anticlimactic. It just
made official what the world of women's tennis
has known for three years straight: Stanford is
queen.
With the 4-1 rout of Miami, the Cardinal
capped a perfect season with their third straight
national title. For Stanford (30-0,8-0 Pac-10). the
victory marked their 86th in a row and their 107 th
straight at home — both easily NCAA records.
Much like her team, Logar dominated from the
outset in what would prove the championship
clinching match against Monika Dancevic in the
No. 3 singles slot. Logar's serves and ground
strokes proved too strong — and her footwork
too quick —as she ran away with a 6-0,6-3 deci
sion over the Canadian from Miami (24-7).
"At first, I kind of didn't realize we had won."
Logar said. "Then it hits you — and then the team
hits you. It was pretty surreal to know that I had
clinched."
Sure enough, the team rushed onto the court to
mob Logar. In the madness, sophomore Lejla
I lodzic took her teammate down with a textbook
tackle that must have pleased football coach Walt
Harris, who attended the championship alongside
University President John Hennessv.

"It's the one time I'm glad we only have 11 peo
ple on the team," Logar said. "Ma"be 1 won't
clinch next year so 1 won't be at the bottom."
The championship one of the most impressive
dynastic runs in any collegiate sport. Since 1978,
Stanford has claimed 15 NCAA titles, 10 in unde
feated seasons. Only North Carolina, with 17
women's soccer crowns, has more NCAA titles in
any one sport.
"'lTiis was one of the best teams to play an un
defeated season." Coach Lele Forood said. "We
had a lot of moments where records were on the
line, and it was a spirited group to keep it going."
Stanford's recent success is even more over
whelming. as the Card have claimed five titles in
the last six years.
"Surprisingly, we've gotten stronger every
year," said senior Amber Liu of the four-year
reign. Stanford went 111-2 over the period.
In this latest title run,sophomore Celia Durkin
and freshman Jessica Nguyen set the stage for
Logar's heroics, claiming Stanford's first two sin
gles points. Durkin needed barely an hour to
cruise past Patricia Starzyk for Stanford's first sin
gles point, 6-0, 6-2. Then Nguyen downed Caren
Seenauth 6-1.6-0 with a blistering forehand and a
strong service return.
A painful strained right quad forced junior
Anne Yelsey out of her No. 4 singles position.That
slid sophomore Whitney Deason and Durkin up
to the four and five slots, and opened up room for
Nguyen to leave the Cardinal just one point shy of
the title.

"We've been trying to get [Yelsey] through the
doubles and see if she can play the singles," Forood
said. "Our team's very deep, so if anyone's not 100
percent, we're going to put out someone who is
100 percent."
Aside from Yelsey's injury, the only blemish on
the calm,cloudy afternoon came in the top singles
spot, where Audra Cohen's power proved too
much for Liu. Cohen claimed a 6-3,6-3 victory for
Miami's only team point — the only one Stanford
has allowed in their eight matches since April 15
— just minutes before Logar clinched the victory.
Stanford kicked off the match with a 2-0 victo
ry in doubles play in front of a mostly full Taube
Tennis Center.
The decisive match came on court one, where
Yelsey and senior Alice Barnes trailed the Miami
tandem of Cohen and Melissa Applebaum 7-3.
Just one game away from a demoralizing defeat,
Yelsey and Barnes knew they had to play more ag
gressively — Yelsey's strained quad be damned.
"If you're going to lose.you at least want to feel
that you attacked and that you went for it." Barnes
said."lf they play well.then that'sone thing. But if
you sit back and let them dictate and you lose it 8-
3, then 1 think our attitude going into singles
would have been much worse."
And attack they did. In an incredibly up-tempo
contest, the top-ranked pair in the nation won six
straight games to snatch a 9-7 win from the jaws of
defeat.
"We were twitching pretty good at
the beginning of their match hut we
got ourselves righted a little bit,"
Forood said. "It was certainly not
their finest day, but they were able to
hang in long enough to turn that
match around. I'm still not quite sure
how they did it."
With that dramatic victory, the
Stanford pair wrestled away the mo
mentum for good. Miami's best —
and last — shot at derailing the Stan
ford dynasty had come and gone.
"1 wanted to win it, but more than

anything, 1 wanted us to feel better
about how we were playing out
there," Barnes said.
In the N0.2 doubles slot. Durkin
connected on several dramatic over
hands in the match's final games, as
she and senior Amber Liu took an 8-
3 decision over Audrey Banada and
Dancevic.
Hodzic and Nguyen were tied 6-
all with Seenauth and Starzyk after
both sides struggled to hold serve
when the Card victory on court one
ended doubles play.
And though the day couldn't have
gone better, a tinge of melancholy
shaded the celebration for Stanford's
four seniors: Barnes. Liu. Joanna Kao
and Jessica Leek. As amazing as the
last four years have been, they knew

yesterday marked the end of the road.
"It's a massive part of our lives
that's gone." Barnes said. "I'm still in
denial. It means so much to you and
then it's taken away. At least the last
match was about as good as it could
have been."
TIEBREAKER:The field was set
yesterday for the NCAA Individual
Championships, which start this
morning. Barnes. Deason. Durkin.
Liu. Logar and Yelsey will compete
in the singles. Barnes and Yelsey, and
Durkin and Liu will compete in dou
bles.
