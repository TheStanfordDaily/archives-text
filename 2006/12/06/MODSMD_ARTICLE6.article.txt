# Fraga weighs UW move
## Students petition Poli Sci Dept chair to retain popular professor 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Keep Fraga at Stanford!" was the rallying cry at
El Centro Chicano Friday night where 30 students
met to plan what has became a campus-wide cam
paign to petition the University to retain Luis R.
Fraga, a popular associate professor in the Political
Science Department.
The University of Washington has offered Fraga
a job as director of its Diversity Research Institute
and associate vice provost for taculty advancement,
where he would work to recruit, promote and retain
underrepresented faculty.
"It's a very attractive offer." Fraga said in an in
terview with The Daily. Ile has until Dec. 15[l JIIJ to
decide whether to act on Washington's offer.
The idea of losing Fraga has been enough to
quickly mobilize hundreds of students and alumni,
including members of MEChA, the BSU and the
ASSU. A Facebook group created last Tuesday
boasted more than 500 members last night, and an
online petition has collected more than 750 signa
tures from students and alumni. Some students say
they also plan to write letters to key alumni and Uni
versity donors.
"He's one of the reasons why I'm in grad school."
said 2006 graduate Alex Rivas, who
is currently a graduate student at
Princeton. "To me. he is an example
that Latinos can do it — we can be
come academics without forgetting
our communities."
Lizet Ocampo, a 2006 graduate
who created the Faccbook group
and attended Thursday's meeting,
said she was not surprised by the
support for Fraga.
"Professor Fraga has touched
people's lives in a way that's unique,
so people are willing to put their
names down on things and offer
their support," she said.
Fraga's research specializes in
urban politics and policy, education
politics and policy. American nation
al politics, voting rights policy, and
the politics of race and ethnicity.
He has won several university
awards, including the Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel Award for Contribu
tions to Undergraduate Education
in 1995 and the Allan V. Cox Medal
for Faculty Excellence in Fostering
Undergraduate Research in 1997.
Ocampo said the campaign wants
to make sure the administration
knows the extent to which students
and alumni value Fraga's work and
mentoring.
But where students often see a
black-and-white issue of priorities
placed by the University. Prof. Terry
Moe, chair of the Political Science
Department, argued that the issue is
far more complex than it may seem.
"What you're hearing is there is a
really popular professor and the
University is not responding." he
said. "That is not true. Certain
processes are underway because de
cisions have to be made because of
requests that Prof. Fraga has made
about the conditions under which he
would be willing to stay.
"These personnel matters are
sensitive and handled by many parts
of the University," Moe continued.
"In this case, the School of Educa
tion. the Deans and the Provost are
involved.This is an ongoing process."
Moe explained that when a pro
fessor receives an outside offer, it
takes a considerable amount of time
for Stanford's processes to evaluate
which steps to take and whether
Stanford can find solutions to keep
the professor at Stanford.
"These aren't simple; they are
processes that take time," Moe said
in an interview with The Daily.
"These are major steps that need to
be taken and they require formal de
cisions by units of the University."
Moe added that Stanford must

"follow our rules and make our deci
sions." With little time to work be
tween now and the Dec. 15 deadline
from University of Washington. Moe
said Fraga must decide if he will ask
for more time, or what to do.
"Universities often put deadlines
on offers, to their strategic advan
tage," Moe said.
The chair of the University of
Washington's political science de
partment, Stephen Majeski. declined
to comment because he did not want
to "preempt" the process. The uni
"Professor Fraga has
touched peoples lives in a
way that's unique, so peo
ple are willing to put their
names down on things
and offer their support."
Lizet Ocampo
versity recently added a minor in di
versity. In a 2004 memo published as
part of an appraisal of the school's
diversity, Majeski wrote,"We started
[an effort to rethink how to build a
diverse faculty) by establishing that
it was our top priority to hire in Race
and Ethnicity politics."
Some Stanford students ex
pressed concern that Fraga's depar
ture is indicative of the department's
inability to retain minority profes
sors. Two other notable minority
professors in political science have
recently left the Farm.
"When I went to Stanford," said
2006 grad Helen Kim, "there were
three scholars in the Political Science
Department who studied race and
ethnicity in the U.S. that I could look
to for scholarly direction: Carolyn
Wong, Claudine Gay and Luis
Fraga."
Now, with only Fraga left, and his
departure possible, Kim said she sees
a "shocking and unacceptable" trend
which shows "an administration and
academic climate that fails to retain
scholars."
But Moe says students are often
simply unaware of the work that
goes on behind the scenes.
"For Claudine Gay, she had three
outside offers from I larvard. Berke
ley and Michigan. We gave her a
spectacular counteroffer and our ef
forts went on for months and
months," Moe said. "I was deeply in
volved, and 1 did everything I could.
To see it the way some students do

trivializes everything we did to keep
her, which was a tremendous
amount."
Some said they worried that
Fraga's departure would leave the
Political Science Department under
staffed in the broad field of U.S. mi
nority politics, leaving a hole in the
scope of the issues covered by the
Political Science Department, the
Program in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity, the School of
Education and student research.
"With the departures of Claudine
Gay and Carolyn Wong, I believe
that Prof. Fraga is the only remaining
race and ethnic politics scholar left in
the Department of Political Science,"
said 2004 graduate Sarah Ihn. "His
departure would leave Stanford with
an extremely stunted Political Sci
ence Department — how can it be
possible that the leading research in
stitution in California would not
have any scholars in this field?"
Sophomore Mondaire Jones, an
ASSU senator and chair of the cam
pus advocacy committee, argued
that the problem extends beyond the
Political Science Department and
Prof. Fraga.
"Frankly, the number of Stanford
professors belonging to historically
underrepresented groups is
abysmal," he wrote in an email to
The Daily. "And the statistics be
come even worse when considering
ethnic minorities like Fraga."
Jones has written a Senate bill
that would call for a University-wide
five-year plan for diversity, which
will be voted on in January.
An official report submitted to
the Faculty Senate by the Office of
the Provost on May 18,entitled"Pro
fessorial Gains. Losses, and Compo
sition." stated that a combined total
of 5.9 percent of the total 1,770 facul
ty members at Stanford belong to an
ethnic minority category.
Ocampo said that those cam
paigning for Fraga's retention want
ed to see Stanford's higher adminis
tration step in and ensure that those
shoes will be filled if Fraga does
leave Stanford.
"If Professor Fraga leaves,"
Ocampo said, "he's going to be able
to continue to do the research he's
doing, but we care because we want
him here. We want the University to
provide the best type of education."
Fraga declined to comment on
the current status of race and ethnic
ity studies within the academic envi
ronment at Stanford. He also de
clined comment on what, if anything,
would convince him to stay.
"I greatly respect and appreciate
all of the support that I have re
ceived from students and others at
the university who have asked me to
stay," he said, "and who are working
to help me stay."

Jones has written a Senate bill
that would call for a University-wide
five-year plan for diversity, which
will be voted on in January.
An official report submitted to
the Faculty Senate by the Office of
the Provost on May 18,entitled"Pro
fessorial Gains. Losses, and Compo
sition." stated that a combined total
of 5.9 percent of the total 1,770 facul

ethnic minority category.
Ocampo said that those cam
paigning for Fraga's retention want
ed to see Stanford's higher adminis
tration step in and ensure that those
shoes will be filled if Fraga does
leave Stanford.
"If Professor Fraga leaves,"
Ocampo said, "he's going to be able
to continue to do the research he's
doing, but we care because we want
him here. We want the University to
provide the best type of education."
Fraga declined to comment on
the current status of race and ethnic
ity studies within the academic envi
ronment at Stanford. He also de
clined comment on what, if anything,
would convince him to stay.
"I greatly respect and appreciate
all of the support that I have re
ceived from students and others at
the university who have asked me to
stay," he said, "and who are working
to help me stay."
"Keep Fraga at Stanford!" was the rallying cry at
El Centro Chicano Friday night where 30 students
met to plan what has became a campus-wide cam
paign to petition the University to retain Luis R.
Fraga, a popular associate professor in the Political
Science Department.
The University of Washington has offered Fraga
a job as director of its Diversity Research Institute
and associate vice provost for taculty advancement,
where he would work to recruit, promote and retain
underrepresented faculty.
"It's a very attractive offer." Fraga said in an in
terview with The Daily. Ile has until Dec. 15[l JIIJ to
decide whether to act on Washington's offer.
The idea of losing Fraga has been enough to
quickly mobilize hundreds of students and alumni,
including members of MEChA, the BSU and the
ASSU. A Facebook group created last Tuesday
boasted more than 500 members last night, and an
online petition has collected more than 750 signa
tures from students and alumni. Some students say
they also plan to write letters to key alumni and Uni
versity donors.
"He's one of the reasons why I'm in grad school."
said 2006 graduate Alex Rivas, who
is currently a graduate student at
Princeton. "To me. he is an example
that Latinos can do it — we can be
come academics without forgetting
our communities."
Lizet Ocampo, a 2006 graduate
who created the Faccbook group
and attended Thursday's meeting,
said she was not surprised by the
support for Fraga.
"Professor Fraga has touched
people's lives in a way that's unique,
so people are willing to put their
names down on things and offer
their support," she said.
Fraga's research specializes in
urban politics and policy, education
politics and policy. American nation
al politics, voting rights policy, and
the politics of race and ethnicity.
He has won several university
awards, including the Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel Award for Contribu
tions to Undergraduate Education
in 1995 and the Allan V. Cox Medal
for Faculty Excellence in Fostering
Undergraduate Research in 1997.
Ocampo said the campaign wants
to make sure the administration
knows the extent to which students
and alumni value Fraga's work and
mentoring.
But where students often see a
black-and-white issue of priorities
placed by the University. Prof. Terry
Moe, chair of the Political Science
Department, argued that the issue is
far more complex than it may seem.
"What you're hearing is there is a
really popular professor and the
University is not responding." he
said. "That is not true. Certain
processes are underway because de
cisions have to be made because of
requests that Prof. Fraga has made
about the conditions under which he
would be willing to stay.
"These personnel matters are
sensitive and handled by many parts
of the University," Moe continued.
"In this case, the School of Educa
tion. the Deans and the Provost are
involved.This is an ongoing process."
Moe explained that when a pro
fessor receives an outside offer, it
takes a considerable amount of time
for Stanford's processes to evaluate
which steps to take and whether
Stanford can find solutions to keep
the professor at Stanford.
"These aren't simple; they are
processes that take time," Moe said
in an interview with The Daily.
"These are major steps that need to
be taken and they require formal de
cisions by units of the University."
Moe added that Stanford must

"follow our rules and make our deci
sions." With little time to work be
tween now and the Dec. 15 deadline
from University of Washington. Moe
said Fraga must decide if he will ask
for more time, or what to do.
"Universities often put deadlines
on offers, to their strategic advan
tage," Moe said.
The chair of the University of
Washington's political science de
partment, Stephen Majeski. declined
to comment because he did not want
to "preempt" the process. The uni
"Professor Fraga has
touched peoples lives in a
way that's unique, so peo
ple are willing to put their
names down on things

versity recently added a minor in di
versity. In a 2004 memo published as
part of an appraisal of the school's
diversity, Majeski wrote,"We started
[an effort to rethink how to build a
diverse faculty) by establishing that
it was our top priority to hire in Race
and Ethnicity politics."
Some Stanford students ex
pressed concern that Fraga's depar
ture is indicative of the department's
inability to retain minority profes
sors. Two other notable minority
professors in political science have
recently left the Farm.
"When I went to Stanford," said
2006 grad Helen Kim, "there were
three scholars in the Political Science
Department who studied race and
ethnicity in the U.S. that I could look
to for scholarly direction: Carolyn
Wong, Claudine Gay and Luis
Fraga."
Now, with only Fraga left, and his
departure possible, Kim said she sees
a "shocking and unacceptable" trend
which shows "an administration and
academic climate that fails to retain
scholars."
But Moe says students are often
simply unaware of the work that
goes on behind the scenes.
"For Claudine Gay, she had three
outside offers from I larvard. Berke
ley and Michigan. We gave her a
spectacular counteroffer and our ef
forts went on for months and
months," Moe said. "I was deeply in
volved, and 1 did everything I could.
To see it the way some students do

trivializes everything we did to keep
her, which was a tremendous
amount."
Some said they worried that
Fraga's departure would leave the
Political Science Department under
staffed in the broad field of U.S. mi
nority politics, leaving a hole in the
scope of the issues covered by the
Political Science Department, the
Program in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity, the School of
Education and student research.
"With the departures of Claudine
Gay and Carolyn Wong, I believe
that Prof. Fraga is the only remaining
race and ethnic politics scholar left in
the Department of Political Science,"
said 2004 graduate Sarah Ihn. "His
departure would leave Stanford with
an extremely stunted Political Sci
ence Department — how can it be
possible that the leading research in
stitution in California would not
have any scholars in this field?"
Sophomore Mondaire Jones, an
ASSU senator and chair of the cam
pus advocacy committee, argued
that the problem extends beyond the
Political Science Department and
Prof. Fraga.
"Frankly, the number of Stanford
professors belonging to historically
underrepresented groups is
abysmal," he wrote in an email to
The Daily. "And the statistics be
come even worse when considering
ethnic minorities like Fraga."
