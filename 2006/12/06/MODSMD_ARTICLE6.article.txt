### CHRISTIAN L. TOM LIA HARDIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Keep Fraga at Stanford!" was the rallying cry at
El Centro Chicano Friday night where 30 students
met to plan what has became a campus-wide cam
paign to petition the University to retain Luis R.
Fraga, a popular associate professor in the Political
Science Department.
The University of Washington has offered Fraga
a job as director of its Diversity Research Institute
and associate vice provost for taculty advancement,
where he would work to recruit, promote and retain
underrepresented faculty.
"It's a very attractive offer." Fraga said in an in
terview with The Daily. Ile has until Dec. 15[l JIIJ to
decide whether to act on Washington's offer.
The idea of losing Fraga has been enough to
quickly mobilize hundreds of students and alumni,
including members of MEChA, the BSU and the
ASSU. A Facebook group created last Tuesday
boasted more than 500 members last night, and an
online petition has collected more than 750 signa
tures from students and alumni. Some students say
they also plan to write letters to key alumni and Uni
versity donors.
"He's one of the reasons why I'm in grad school."
