The men's team finished fourth, a
two-place improvement from last
year's title meet.
The victory was the third NCAA
championship in four years for the
women's squad, the favorite
throughout the season that was able
to brush off the pressures of either
history or expectations.
"We've treated this season as it's
own. not thinking about pressure
