### SCOTT BLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the final event of the 2006 sea
son, the No. 1 Stanford women's
cross-country team lived up to its
top billing bv capturing its second
straight national title at the NCAA
Championships inTerre Haute. Ind.
The men's team finished fourth, a
two-place improvement from last
year's title meet.
The victory was the third NCAA
championship in four years for the
women's squad, the favorite
throughout the season that was able
to brush off the pressures of either
history or expectations.
"We've treated this season as it's
own. not thinking about pressure
from last year's win or our position
as favorites," junior Arianna Lam
bie said. "So this championship is
exhilarating in its own right."
Lambie paced the women with a
fourth-place finish in the 6,000-
meter race with a time of 20 min
utes, 43.8 seconds last Monday
morning. Lambie's time counted for
third place in the team standings be

cause an individual runner from
Yale, whose team did not qualify as
a whole, finished just ahead of her.
The next Stanford runner to
cross the line was junior Teresa
McWalters, who claimed 27th place
in the team competitiot (31st over
all) in 21:18.2. Sophomore Linusey
Flacks followed in 45th (st>th over
all) in 21:43.1. Seniors Amanda and
Katy Trotter rounded out the Cardi
nal's top five. Amanda claimed 58th
place (7()th overall) in 21:52.0, and
Katy finished in 62nd (78th overall)
in 21:55.0.
Katy Trotter's 62nd-place finish
was key for the Cardinal's posting at
the top of the team standings. Each
of the top four runners from No. 6
Colorado, the runner-up, finished
ahead of the corresponding runner
on Stanford's roster. However, Tro
tter's finish well outstripped Col
orado's fifth runner, Erin Marston.
who claimed 131st place. That mar
gin gave Stanford 195 points to Col
orado's 223, securing another cham
pionship for the Cardinal.
Trotter finished 23 places ahead
of the next-closest fifth runner on
the other contending teams.
"Several teams had the potential
to challenge us." Lambie said. "But
none had the crucial fifth runner
that Stanford had.. .Katy [Trotter] is
the most dependable runner I
know, and Amanda is as committed
as anyone. They are truly irreplace
able."
The race was also a success for
the men's team, which claimed
fourth place in the team competi
tion. The squad had finished sixth at
each of the past two NCAA Cham
pionships.
Junior Neftalem Araia played
the major role in boosting the
men's squad to its high finish by
claiming second place in the indi
vidual standings of the 10,000-
meter race in 30:44.9. Only senior
Josh Rohatinsky of Brigham Young
beat Araia to the finish line.
Araia was soon joined by sopho
more Garrett Heath, who finished
41st (64th overall) in 32:11.4 and by
junior Forrest Tahdooahnippah in
45th (68th overall) in 32:12.6.
Sophomore Hakon DeVries ar
rived in 52nd place (78th overall) in
32:21.2, and senior Brett Gotcher
rounded out Stanford's top five
with a 55th-place finish (81st over
all) at 32:22.2.
The close group of Cardinal run
ners finishing after Araia propelled
Stanford to a 195-point total in the
team standings, one point ahead of
both No. 5 Arkansas and No. 6 Ore
gon. allowing the Cardinal to claim
fourth place and a trophy for their
efforts.
The result was also a measure of
revenge against Oregon, which
foiled Stanford at both the Pacific
-10 Championships and the NCAA
West Regional this season. Those
disappointments fuelled the run
ners' drive and focus heading into
the NCAA Championships last
week.
