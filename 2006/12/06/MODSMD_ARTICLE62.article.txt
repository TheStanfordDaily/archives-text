eye State native's hire.
"I have a degree from lowa, my
family has 19 degrees from lowa, we
have very deep roots in the Midwest,
and the fact of the matter is I have
never been able to get a job outside of
lowa. Bowlsby joked. "So I'm very
pleased to be here."
Bowlsby stressed that his first
order of business would simply be to
listen to the concerns of Stanford
coaches and administrators, but.
upon further questioning, identified
recruiting in the light of the stringent
admissions standards, the transition
to the new Stanford Stadium and the
health of the football program as top
priorities.
At lowa. Bowlsby became famous
for his hire of football coach Kirk
Ferent/.a then-unknown who has be
come one of college football's hottest
coaches by turning lowa from a 1-10
doormat into an 11-2 conference co
champion and perennial power in
just three years.
Bowlsby expressed optimism with
regard to Stanford football, noting
that he sees many similarities be
tween Ferentz and Stanford head
coach Walt I larris.To prove his point,
Bowlsby said that he actually reject
ed the athletic director position at
Duke 10 years ago. in part because of
a lack of confidence in their football
program.
"In all honesty, I sat in the foot
ball stadium and wondered if I could
really live with watching Florida
State go back and forth and back
and forth," said Bowlsby of declin
ing Duke's AD post. "I just wasn't at
all certain that there was a good up
side for the football program, and I
just feel entirely different about this
situation here."

Once a college wrestler at Min
nesota's Morehead State, Bowlsby
spoke at the Arrillaga Family Sports
Center Friday of the process that led
him to accept the Stanford opening.
The University had initially con
tacted him to ask for input on other
candidates, knowing he was happy at
the helm of lowa Athletics, a position
he has held since 1992.
But as the 13-member search
committee's investigation broad
ened, athletic directors and adminis
trators kept singing praises of a man
nationally renowned in collegiate
athletics for chairing the NCAA Di
vision I Basketball Tournament
Committee and sitting on the US
Olympic Committee. Above all
though, they praised Bowlsby for
leading the least populous Big Ten
school to regional and national
prominence in major sports — most
notably football, men's and women's
basketball and wrestling — without
the scandal that has plagued similarly
successful programs.
Intrigued, Stanford offered
Bowlsby an on-campus interview.
And. despite rebuffing other
schools' requests over the years,
Bowlsby decided to accept this
offer, adding that Stanford's loca
tion. "its extraordinary academic
profile, the championships that are
won every year," and the fact that he
trusted news of the interview not to
leak enticed him.
"Stanford is the only place 1 would
have considered going and I say that
in all sincerity,"said Bowlsby,s4."lt is
a place that I have admired for many
years. It is a place where athletic ex
cellence and academic excellence are
not mutually exclusive, and it is a
model for intercollegiate athletics for

all who care to look around the coun
try."
Once on campus, Bowlsby
demonstrated the values that the po
sition demands, but the depth of his
knowledge proved the distinguishing
factor in a pool of applicants that
numbered between 50 and 100. ac
cording to Provost John
Etchemendy.
Fven so. Stanford might still be
searching for an AD if Bowlsby were
not, in his words, an "empty nester."
The youngest of his four children
starts college at lowa this fall, and he
said that made it much easier for him
to decide to move across the country.
He added that he will live on campus
at Stanford because of the high real
estate prices in the area.
But Bowlsby didn't fly out just to
meet and greet the press — and after
the 20-minutc conference, he spent
the rest of his day at Stanford meet
ing with key coaches and University
officials, before Hying back to lowa
on Saturday.
At the press conference, interim
AD Bill Walsh sat sandwiched be
tween Bowlsby's wife Candicc and
Coach Harris in the front row. Bowls
by met with both men later in the day.
and Walsh announced that he will
stay on at Stanford for another year
as a consultant, at Bowlsby's request.
Softball's John Dunning, base
ball's Mark Marquess and women's
basketball's Tara VanDerveer were
among the other high-profile head
coaches attending the press confer
ence, while outgoing AD Ted Leland
sat quietly in the back.
