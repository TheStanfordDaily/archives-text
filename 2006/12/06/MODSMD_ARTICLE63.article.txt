## Hernandez a hero in shocking comeback Senior guard hits three free throws with 0.2 seconds left to stun Huskies, 76-67 in overtime 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford senior guard Chris I ler
nandez stepped to the free-throw line with
two-tenths of a second left in regulation, his
team trailing 63-60, and three shots coming
to him, he knew that this was the moment he
had been waiting for. And he was ready.
"It's funny, because we were in the shoot
around today, and [assistant] coach [ Tony]
Fuller slammed me for the Virginia lech
game, when I missed those free throws
down the stretch." Hernandez said, refer
ring to the Cardinal's 59-52 loss to the I lok
ieson Dec. 17."I thought about that when I
was shooting (the free throws), ii made me
focus on the game."
Hernandez stepped to the line with a
typically stoic expression and swished the
first two before Washington head coach
Lorenzo Romar called a timeout, forcing
the guard to wait even longer. The usually
deafening crowd of 6,285 at Maples Pavilion
held its breath as Hernandez's third free
throw rattled around the rim before it tell in.
tying the game at 63 and sending it to an
extra period.
The Cardinal (10-7.6-3 Pac-10) pulled
away in overtime to win 76-(i7. After the
final horn, the Sixth Man Club stormed the
floor to celebrate the win over the No. 10
Huskies (16-4.5-4) — Stanford's largest vic
tory thus far this season.

"I just tried to hold the hall through and
lean into it, get that shooter's touch," Her
nandez said of the third tree throw. "Hie
Lord had my back on that."
The play that sent I lernandez to the line
seemed to involve just as much divine inter
vention. With 2.1 seconds left on the clock.
Lawrence Kill in-hounded the ball I'rom
under the Washington basket to Stanford
center Matt Haryasz at mid-court. Haryasz
passed the ball to an open I lernandez. who
stopped just shy of the three point line to
take the shot. Washington freshman Justin
Dentition hit Hernandez's shooting arm to
draw the foul.
"We call that the home run play," head
coach Trent Johnson said. "We work on sit
nations like that in every practice. We try to
get it to the shooter and get a three."
Haryasz noted that they had never run
the play against a defense.even in practice.
"It's not even close to simulating it when
you've got a packed house against Washing
ton, down by three," I laryasz said.
Hernandez had plenty of time to think
about the free throws — and the Virginia
lech game — after the officials reviewed
the call, eventually determining he had got
ten the shot off with 0.2 seconds remaining,
lie also waited through the four timeouts
that Johnson called to set up the final play.
Stanford carried the momentum that
Hernandez provided into overtime,
using an 1 1-2 run to seal the victor)'.
The Cardinal played tough defense
and. fittingly enough, made eight free
throws in the bonus time. Hernandez
had four of those and finished with 15
points, and a perfect nine-of-nine
from the line.
"When we reached overtime, we
said, this is our second chance, and
you don't get many second chances,"
said Haryasz, whose 24 points paced
the squad. "We got one. and we took
advantage ot it. I was confident we
were going to win the game when it
went to overtime."
Haryasz put the team on his
shoulders in the second half,notching
10 of the Cardinal's first 15 points
after the break. But Washington —
and senior guard Brandon Roy espe
cially — answered every time. Roy
scored 15 ol his game-high 25 in the
second period before Stanford senior
guard Dan Grunfeld held him to two
free throws in the overtime session.
Grunfeld's hustle also helped the

Cardinal stay close in the second half.
The Huskies took a 54-48 lead with
7:48 to play when Roy converted a
three-point play, but Grunfeld —
who had been fairly quiet up to that
point — fought back.
After Stanford freshman Mitch
Johnson missed a fast-break lay-up,
Grunfeld scooped up the loose ball
and scored. He stripped Washing
ton's Joel Smith on the next play,
which led to a Hill three-pointer.
After grabbing a rebound on the
Huskies' next possession, Grunfeld
raced down the floor and made a
layup. drawing a hard foul. The ball
fell through the hoop as Grunfeld
hit the floor, and he converted the
free throw to put Stanford ahead 56-
54.
The Cardinal stretched the lead to
60-56 on free throws by Hernandez
and Haryasz, but Washington battled
back. A layup from Roy put the
Huskies up 61 -60 with 1:03 to play.
Stanford had a chance to score
after Johnson stole the ball from Roy
with 15 seconds remaining. But John
son lost the handle trying to find
Grunfeld with three seconds left,
forcing Grunfeld to foul Roy imme
diately. He was fouled again on the
ensuing inbounds pass, putting Wash

ington into the bonus and sending
Roy to the line. He sank both free
throws to push the Washington lead
to three, setting up Hernandez's
heroics.
The shots spelled redemption for
Hernandez, and not just from the
Virginia Tech game. He sat out the
first half's final 12:16 after picking up
his second foul and watched from a
folding chair as the 1 luskies went on
a 17-5 run to finish the half ahead 33-
28. The margin probably should have
been wider — the Huskies attempt
ed 13 more shots than the Cardinal
did in the first period — but Stanford
held the nation's highest-scoring of
fense to only 39 percent from the
field in the half, and 37 percent in the
game.
Even Hernandez admitted that he
was nervous shooting the free
throws, but Haryasz knew that the
Cardinal had the right man at the
line.
"When Chris went to the line, he
was like. What's up?"' Haryasz said
after the game. "I was like, 'Chilling.
We're going to overtime.'"
