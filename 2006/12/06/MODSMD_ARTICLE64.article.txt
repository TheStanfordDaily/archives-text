one swing of the bat really turned the
game around." I fester said. "Most im
portantly. it wasn't just that one hit.
We stayed after it with the bats for the
whole game. I can't remember the last
[grand slam] I hit. It might have been

to the floor, keep grinding for some
runs and not let them get comfortable
with coming back."
