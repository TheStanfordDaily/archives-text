## Women's hoops falls short of Final Four Card loses close call against LSU, 62-59, in Elite Eight matchup 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF WRITERS 
The season came to an abrupt end for
the women's basketball team last week
end in San Antonio, Texas. Though they
made it as far as the regional final, the
Cardinal lost their Final Four bid in the
last 11.5 seconds of a contest against LSU.
Down 60-59, sophomore guard Can
dice Wiggins got the pass in and sprinted
down the court, passing to senior guard
Krista Rappahahn in the right corner.
Rappahahn made the three pointer and it
looked like the Card were in business.
That illusion only lasted a brief moment
as a foul was called on Wiggins for a
charge into LSU senior guard Seimone
Augustus, negating the shot. T\vo made
free throws by Augustus sealed the
Tigers' win, 62-59, and the Cardinal's
third-straight miss at the Final Four.
For Wiggins, though, rather than those
11.5 seconds, it came down to one.
"I knew [Augustus awaiting the
charge] was coming, we run that play all
the time," she said. "It was just too late.
Just one second — one second and the
pass would've been there."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer and the
rest of the Cardinal were surprised by the
controversial call in the final seconds, but
agreed that the call was not the biggest
factor in the game's outcome.
"I'm really proud of our team and how
well we competed, and the plays that we
made," VanDerveer said. "It just came
down to some execution. I think we had a
great last shot, and it went in, but we need
to improve on execution throughout the
game."
Stanford and LSU had been back and

forth in the first half, hut the Cardinal
started off the second with a 28-23 lead. A
stepped-up LSU defense bogged the Car
dinal down and the Tigers went on a 14-2
run to take the lead. 41 -35, with 12:54 left
in the game. Wiggins helped regain Stan
ford's advantage, only to see the Cardinal
fall behind again, struggling to capture
the win in those final, fateful seconds.
Stanford gave away many easy re
bounds and baskets, especially to sopho
more guard Erica White, who fooled the
Cardinal with her height and proved a
strong, quick presence on the court. She
contributed eight of the Tigers' lead-grab
bing points, and had 14 on the game.
The Cardinal also had to deal with Au
gustus. who was named Most Outstand
ing Player for the Regional All-Tourna
ment Team. Stanford attempted to dou
ble-team Augustus — a strategy that
worked against Oklahoma's Courtney
Paris two days prior — but were unsuc
cessful.
In the regional semifinal, Stanford sur
prised the No. 2-seeded Sooners,both of
fensively and defensively. Ihe Cardinal
began the game on a 9-0 run, and led the
whole way to an 88-74 victory.
Junior center Brooke Smith led the of
fensive charge with a career-high 35
points, besting her 26 at UCLA earlier
this season. She was 14 for 16 from the
field.
"There's no other post player in the
country I'd rather have on my team than
Brooke." Wiggins said. "It makes me
happy to see her playing her best, and I 'm
glad the whole nation got to see what we
see every day in practice and what a great
player she is."
Smith was humble about her career
mark, despite the praise from her team
mates and VanDerveer's constant cries to
"Give the ball to Brooke."
"My teammates did a great job of find
ing me when I was open, and my shots
were just dropping," Smith said.
Paris, the record-breaking Okla
homa freshman, was locked up by a
tight double-teaming rotation from
Stanford throughout the game.
"We wanted to be a presence in
there and basically make her work for
everything she gets," junior center
Kristen Newlin said. "A great player
like her we're not going to shut down,
but we could contain her."
And the Cardinal did, keeping
Paris to just eight points in the first
half. Although the star post ended
up with 26 points after a second
round surge, Stanford was able to
fend off the Sooners, maintaining a
lead of at least six points, and as
much as 19.
In the previous second round of
the tournament in Denver, Florida
State had its own game plan to exploit
Stanford's perceived lack of depth,
but came up short. 88-70.
'ITie Seminoles' bench outscored
the Cardinal's 32-6, but Wiggins' 34
points and Smith's 22, as well as con
tributions from other starters, kept
Stanford afloat.
The Cardinal had another strong
performance in the first round
against Southeast Missouri State, es
pecially from sophomore guard and
Missouri native Cissy Pierce, who had
10 points. Stanford had a blow-out 72-
45 win against the Redhawks,shaking
off first-round jitters by the second
half.
The Cardinal were disappointed
that their tournament run ended as it
had the previous two years, with a
close match in the Elite Eight. How
ever, the Cardinal also made it to the
regional final this year amid low ex
pectations as the No. 3 seed.
"If someone had told me at the be
ginning of the year, or in December,
January, or February this team was
going to the Elite Eight, I would have
jumped for joy," VanDerbeer said. "I
can't say I'm jumping for joy right this
second, but I'm proud of our team
and how everyone improved so
much.
"I think this can be a stepping
stone for us. We have a lot of people
coming back, and I think they'll have
higher expectations now."

looked like the Card were in business.
That illusion only lasted a brief moment
as a foul was called on Wiggins for a
charge into LSU senior guard Seimone
Augustus, negating the shot. T\vo made
free throws by Augustus sealed the
Tigers' win, 62-59, and the Cardinal's
third-straight miss at the Final Four.
For Wiggins, though, rather than those
11.5 seconds, it came down to one.
"I knew [Augustus awaiting the
charge] was coming, we run that play all
the time," she said. "It was just too late.
Just one second — one second and the
pass would've been there."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer and the
rest of the Cardinal were surprised by the
controversial call in the final seconds, but
agreed that the call was not the biggest
factor in the game's outcome.
"I'm really proud of our team and how
well we competed, and the plays that we
made," VanDerveer said. "It just came
down to some execution. I think we had a
great last shot, and it went in, but we need
to improve on execution throughout the
game."
Stanford and LSU had been back and

forth in the first half, hut the Cardinal
started off the second with a 28-23 lead. A
stepped-up LSU defense bogged the Car
dinal down and the Tigers went on a 14-2
run to take the lead. 41 -35, with 12:54 left
in the game. Wiggins helped regain Stan
ford's advantage, only to see the Cardinal
fall behind again, struggling to capture
the win in those final, fateful seconds.
Stanford gave away many easy re
bounds and baskets, especially to sopho
more guard Erica White, who fooled the
Cardinal with her height and proved a
strong, quick presence on the court. She
contributed eight of the Tigers' lead-grab
bing points, and had 14 on the game.
The Cardinal also had to deal with Au
gustus. who was named Most Outstand
ing Player for the Regional All-Tourna
ment Team. Stanford attempted to dou
ble-team Augustus — a strategy that
worked against Oklahoma's Courtney
Paris two days prior — but were unsuc
cessful.
In the regional semifinal, Stanford sur
prised the No. 2-seeded Sooners,both of
fensively and defensively. Ihe Cardinal
began the game on a 9-0 run, and led the
whole way to an 88-74 victory.
Junior center Brooke Smith led the of
fensive charge with a career-high 35
points, besting her 26 at UCLA earlier
this season. She was 14 for 16 from the
field.
"There's no other post player in the
country I'd rather have on my team than
Brooke." Wiggins said. "It makes me
happy to see her playing her best, and I 'm
glad the whole nation got to see what we
see every day in practice and what a great
player she is."
Smith was humble about her career
mark, despite the praise from her team
mates and VanDerveer's constant cries to
"Give the ball to Brooke."
"My teammates did a great job of find
ing me when I was open, and my shots
were just dropping," Smith said.
Paris, the record-breaking Okla
homa freshman, was locked up by a
tight double-teaming rotation from
Stanford throughout the game.
"We wanted to be a presence in
there and basically make her work for
everything she gets," junior center
Kristen Newlin said. "A great player
like her we're not going to shut down,
but we could contain her."
And the Cardinal did, keeping
Paris to just eight points in the first
half. Although the star post ended
up with 26 points after a second
round surge, Stanford was able to
fend off the Sooners, maintaining a
lead of at least six points, and as
much as 19.
In the previous second round of
the tournament in Denver, Florida
State had its own game plan to exploit
Stanford's perceived lack of depth,
but came up short. 88-70.
'ITie Seminoles' bench outscored
the Cardinal's 32-6, but Wiggins' 34
points and Smith's 22, as well as con
tributions from other starters, kept
Stanford afloat.
The Cardinal had another strong
performance in the first round
against Southeast Missouri State, es
pecially from sophomore guard and
Missouri native Cissy Pierce, who had
10 points. Stanford had a blow-out 72-
45 win against the Redhawks,shaking
off first-round jitters by the second
half.
The Cardinal were disappointed
that their tournament run ended as it
had the previous two years, with a
close match in the Elite Eight. How
ever, the Cardinal also made it to the
regional final this year amid low ex
pectations as the No. 3 seed.
"If someone had told me at the be
ginning of the year, or in December,
January, or February this team was
going to the Elite Eight, I would have
jumped for joy," VanDerbeer said. "I
can't say I'm jumping for joy right this
second, but I'm proud of our team
and how everyone improved so
much.
"I think this can be a stepping
stone for us. We have a lot of people
coming back, and I think they'll have
higher expectations now."

Senior outside hitter Kristen Richards, seen here against Washington on Nov.
27, was one of the leaders on a Cardinal team that won the Pac-10.
The season came to an abrupt end for
the women's basketball team last week
end in San Antonio, Texas. Though they
made it as far as the regional final, the
Cardinal lost their Final Four bid in the
last 11.5 seconds of a contest against LSU.
Down 60-59, sophomore guard Can
dice Wiggins got the pass in and sprinted
down the court, passing to senior guard
Krista Rappahahn in the right corner.
Rappahahn made the three pointer and it
looked like the Card were in business.
