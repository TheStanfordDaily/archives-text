## Sherman keys first win of the season Card avoid winless season with victory 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Sl*. AI 111'. — "We won the game! It feels so good! We won
the game! It feels so good! We won the game! It feels so
good!"
112 orgive Stanford football for having a simple victory
chant. Alter all, they hadn't used it in a year.
I leven games, 364 days. Jhe Cardinal's losing streak was
the second-longest in the country and as long as any in 85
years of Stanford football history. The Cardinal had also
struggled with traditional Pac-10 power Washington (4-7,2-
6 Pac-10). going just 3-20 since their last win in Seattle in

1 976. But all that history was mercifully put to rest Saturday
as the Cardinal (1-9.1-6) shocked Washington, 20-3.
"We have had so much had luck, the hall bouncing the
other way, and today it bounced our way in more situations
then it had the entire season," head coach Walt Harris said.
"With the help of our seniors, we fought through a lot of ad
versity and we played well today."
Iwo quick-strike touchdowns for the Cardinal proved
the difference. First, sophomore safety Bo McNally's 49-
yard interception return for a touchdown gave Stanford its
first lead since Sept. 9.
"That's the first touchdown in a long time, so that was
great,' I {arrissaid."We were all whooping it upon the side
linos. Doesn't matter it it was the defense scoring, offense
scoring, special teams scoring — we
were scoring and that's what was
great."
Washington quarterback Carl
Bunnell (10-of-35, 118 yards, one in
terception) sat out the third quarter
with a bruised thigh and bloodied
nose, and third-stringer Johnny
Dußocher (l-of-9, four yards, two in
terceptions) struggled mightily in the
fill-in role. What was possibly
Dußocher's worst pass came on a
crossing route intended for his tight
end Michael Gottlieb early in the pe
riod. The throw, meant to be a 15-yard
bullet, was instead a 25-yard floater
that fell right into McNally's hands. As
soon as McNally caught it, he was
thinking end zone.
"1 was going to go down the side
line but 1 saw a tight end coming, so 1
took a couple of steps in toward the
field," McNally said."He went in, so 1
took it down the sideline. I got a cou
ple of big blocks, big hits from my guys
and just got it in there. I think right
there, people started to believe and
just started to get it done."
McNally, a backup, only learned he
was starting Thursday after injuries
forced senior safety Brandon Harri
son to cornerback. But with another
pick of a Dußocher wounded duck
right after halftime, McNally let his
play do the talking.
i was nervous and excited at the
same time, and 1 was really looking
forward to trying to make my mark
for the team," said McNally of his first
career start. "It feels amazing. I am re
ally glad that I could do something to
help out the team get our first victory
of the year."
In the fourth quarter, a Stanford
quarterback threw for a touchdown
for the first time since a loss to Wash
ington State on Sept. 23. Freshman
Richard Sherman (six catches, 177
yards) had reeled in two bombs that
set up a 29-yard field goal by junior
kicker Aaron Zagory that closed the
first half at 3-apiece. Harris and jun
ior quarterback TC Ostrander (11-
of-20, 206 yards, one touchdown)
saw a weakness in Washington's cov
erage of Sherman, one of the fastest
men on the team.
"The way they were covering him,
we felt we could take advantage with
some deep balls, and we almost hit one
earlier than that." Ostrander said."He
made a great adjustment on the first
ball, and he made an even better ad
justment on the second ball to really
make two big plays."

Ostrander fired Sherman a bubble
screen in the early fourth. Senior re
ceiver Marcus McCutcheon blocked
the cornerback on Sherman, and all
the speedster out of Los Angeles had
to do was make the safety miss.
"I broke the safety's tackle and
that was pretty much it." said Sherman
of the team's longest play of the sea
son. "I was thinking. *1 have to score. 1
have to score. Do not get caught.'"
Ostrander was just as elated after
the 74-yard touchdown pass, his first
on the season.
"I saw him running, and 1 thought,
'First down.'" Ostrander said. "I saw
him keep running, and I thought.

'Touchdown.' 1 was the most excited
guy ever. That's the easiest 80-yard
touchdown I'll ever throw in my life."
Zagory added an insurance 37-
yarder with 4:24 to go for the final
margin.
Washington struck first, with a par
tially deflected Michael Braunstein
kick from the 18 that snuck over the
crossbar for a 3-0 Husky lead in the
early second.
Neither team established much of
an offense on the afternoon, marching
for under 400 total yards. 20 first
downs and just 59 rushing yards —
combined. Take away Sherman's big
day and Stanford gained just 49 yards

of total offense.
Stanford's players admitted it was
far from their best performance and
far from the prettiest game they've
seen. Still, after a year-long drought,
they're more than happy to come
hack home with the victory.
"1 didn't think there was a whole
lot of pressure for the winless season
before the game, but the way 1 feel
now. it's awesome to have that one on
the board." Ostrander said. "It's a
good feeling."
