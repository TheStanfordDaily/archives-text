# MEN'S SOCCER
## Men knock off No. 10 Cal in season finale 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a dramatic end to the Cardinal's
best conference showing since 2002,
senior Galen Thompson led the Stan
ford men's soccer team to a 2-1 victo
ry over No. 10 California on Friday
with a game-winning goal in over
time.
After receiving a cross from junior
Dan Shapiro only a few minutes into
the extra period, Thompson maneu
vered around a Cal defender and
managed to find net past junior
goalie Justin Meyers. The goal gave
the Cardinal (7-7-4, 5-3-2 Pacific-10
Conference) its first victory over Cal
(12-5-1, 7-3) in the last 10 meetings
between the teams. Thompson and
the rest of the team were excited to
finish the season with a win over the
conference's best team.
"It doesn't get much better than
an overtime win over Cal," Thomp

son said. "They are always a good
team, and they had a great season to
win the Pac-10. It is very nice to final
ly beat them when they are at the top
of their game."
The Bears jumped out to an earl)
lead, with a goal by leading scorei
junior Javier Ayala-1 iill at 9:01 I low -
ever, Stanford outshot Cal (>5 in the
first half and was final!) rewarded
with a goal by its own leading scorer,
junior Kvan Morgan, in the 30th
minute. It was Morgan's fifth goal of
the year.
Throughout the second half, the
teams remained tied 1-1. though the
Cardinal continued to dominate the
offensive effort, outshooting the
Bears 5-4. Keepers for both teams
were kept busy during the match.
Meyers posted five saves for Cal in
his 97 minutes, while freshman John
Moore had two before being re
placed by redshirt freshman Brent
Stewart at the break. Stewart also
registered two saves.
At the end of regulation, Thom
pson said that coach Bret Simon told
the team to avoid giving the Bears
opportunities by staying composed
tin offense.
"Going into overtime we were
trying to make sure we didn't get
caught too far forward and give up a
counter attack." Thompson said.
"Coach wanted us to pick our
chances and go forward without leav
ing ourselves exposed at the back. We
did what he said, kept good posses
sion and allowed ourselves to get into
the attack and get a goal."
Simon also reminded the Cardi
nal to be patient in case play was ex
tended by two full overtime periods.
"The only thing I emphasized
going into overtime was keeping our
focus and not getting too excited."
Simon said. "The important thing
was to realize that despite the over
time being golden goal, there can be
a full 20 minutes [of extra play]."
Stanford, though, got excited only
six and a half minutes into the first
overtime, when Thompson launched

his shot. Thompson, who was named
Pac-10 Player of the Week for the
second time this season, was happy to
end his career at Stanford on a high
note.
"I think this would have to replace
the San Diego State win as the best
moment of my career," Thompson
said. "To finish the last game of the
season with an overtime golden goal
over Cal [is] the kind of thing you
dream about your whole career.
Doing it at home in front of a great
crowd made it even better."
I lowever.even with the Cal upset,
the Cardinal were overlooked by the
selection committee for the NCAA
College Cup Tournament. At-large
bids were granted to Cal. San Diego
State (9-5-4,5-2-3) and UCLA (10-5-
4,4-3-3). Despite the Bruins' fourth
place Pac-10 finish behind Cal, San
Diego State and Stanford, UCLA
was seeded a conference-high eighth
overall due to its strength of sched

ule, as it met seven of the tourna
ment's 4N teams over the course of
the season.
Regardless, Simon is planning for
the future, and is looking forward to
off-season preparation that might
bring about another competitive
year for the team.
"The end of a season is always bit
tersweet." Simon said."l'll miss many
of the guys on the team and I believe
this group's best days lie ahead.
"I'm certainly proud of our sen
iors." Simon continued. "They really
were great people to coach, and have
helped us get back to being competi
tive with the best teams. I'm thrilled
with the direction we are headed, but
lots of hard work sits in front of us,
and we need to have a great off-sea
son to make the next big stride."
