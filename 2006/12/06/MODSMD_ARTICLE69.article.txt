## Alabama shatters World Series hopes in Supers 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Giving up seven runs in the first in
ning is not the way to win a softball
game.
And while No. 7 Stanford managed
to fight back and tie the score in the
second game of their series with No. 5
Alabama, the No. 12 seeded Cardinal
ultimately lost the game and the series
in this weekend's NCAA Super Re
gional.
The Crimson Tide had put seven
runs on the board by the time the Car
dinal (42- IS) took their first at-bat,but
the Stanford batters quickly plated
three of their own in the first inninn

and tied the game in the fourth. De
spite this unlikely comeback, Alabama
(54- 1 )) eventually took the 8-7 extra-in
nings win on Saturday. 1 laving already
posted a 4-1 victory Friday, Alabama
advanced to the Women's College
World Series with the win.
"Any time you lose the last game of
the season, it's difficult," Stanford head
coach John Rittman said."l felt like the
effort was there but our execution was
not the best. Honestly. 1 think we just
ran out of time. We rallied back from a
big deficit and just fell short. It's tough,
but 1 was proud of the way we fought ."
Stanford's sophomore starter
Becky McCullough struggled to find
the strike zone against the top of Al
abama's order, walking three of the
first four batters at the plate.
After a two-RBI double put Alaba
ma's first runs on the board, freshman
Missy Penna took over in the circle
and immediately walking in another
run. A second two-RBI double and a
two-RBI single gave the Tide the 7-0
advantage.
With their season on the line, the
Stanford squad did not give up and an
swered with a three-run first inning of
its own. The Tide made three costly
mistakes early — a wild pitch, a field
ing error and an overthrow at the plate
that allowed senior Catalina Morris
score. Penna brought home senior
Lauren Lappin with a single, and
freshman Maddy Coon scored on an
other wild pitch to close the gap to 7-3.
The Cardinal struck again in the
fourth inning, tying the game with a
four-run rally. With the bases loaded,
sophomore Anna Beardman reached
base on an error, which brought two
runs across the plate. Lappin hit a sin
gle to the shortstop for two RBI and
the score was knotted at seven.

"It was just never giving up, never
quitting," Rittman said of his team's
comeback effort. "We have such good
leadership from the seniors and up
perclassmen who have been there be
fore — they know that we are capable
of scoring seven, eight, nine runs in a
game. When you give up that many
runs early, there is a lot of ballgame left
to play. And we took that approach —
that we still had seven innings to play
and we just needed to chip away and
get back in it."
The tie lasted through the seventh,
pushing the game into extra innings.
Alabama's Mandy Burford reached
base on an error and stole second and
third before coming home on an RBI
single. Facing a one-run deficit, the
Cardinal hit into a double play to end
the eighth inning and the game.
The win was Alabama's second of
the series following a 4-1 victory' over
the Cardinal on Friday. With the pair of
victories, the Crimson Fide advanced
to the WCWS.
On Friday, Alabama scored a run in
the second inning and two in the third
before the Cardinal broke through in
the sixth with Penna scoring Rinehart
with an RBI single. The Cardinal
would not score again and the Tide
notched an insurance run in the bot
tom of the sixth for the final margin.
Rinehart had a stellar day at the
plate for Stanford by going 3-for-3. But

the rest of the team could combine for
only more three hits.
"We dealt with some adversity this
year." Rittman said. "When you have
injuries to two of your pitchers —
Penna's smashed thumb and McCul
lough's arm — it can be very hard. But
we battled through that. For a team to
win 42 games when you play the
schedule that we played, that is a suc
cessful season."
Stanford will return next year with
out its five current seniors, including
Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year
Lappin. But the Cardinal will have an
experienced squad of rising juniors
and seniors who are ready to step into
leadership positions.
"Each year is a new year, and this
year's team was special and unique in
many ways," Rittman said. "Next year
the team must develop its own identi
ty. We will need new leaders, but we al
ready have them in our program."
Alabama will next face No. 4
Northwestern in the first round.There
were no significant upsets in this year's
bracket and the eight teams going to
Oklahoma are the tournament's top
eight seeds. Four of those teams, in
cluding top-ranked UCLA, are from
the Pac-10.

runs on the board by the time the Car
dinal (42- IS) took their first at-bat,but
the Stanford batters quickly plated
three of their own in the first inninn

and tied the game in the fourth. De
spite this unlikely comeback, Alabama
(54- 1 )) eventually took the 8-7 extra-in
nings win on Saturday. 1 laving already
posted a 4-1 victory Friday, Alabama
advanced to the Women's College
World Series with the win.
"Any time you lose the last game of
the season, it's difficult," Stanford head
coach John Rittman said."l felt like the
effort was there but our execution was
not the best. Honestly. 1 think we just
ran out of time. We rallied back from a
big deficit and just fell short. It's tough,
but 1 was proud of the way we fought ."
Stanford's sophomore starter
Becky McCullough struggled to find
the strike zone against the top of Al
abama's order, walking three of the
first four batters at the plate.
After a two-RBI double put Alaba
ma's first runs on the board, freshman
Missy Penna took over in the circle
and immediately walking in another
run. A second two-RBI double and a
two-RBI single gave the Tide the 7-0
advantage.
With their season on the line, the
Stanford squad did not give up and an
swered with a three-run first inning of
its own. The Tide made three costly
mistakes early — a wild pitch, a field
ing error and an overthrow at the plate
that allowed senior Catalina Morris
score. Penna brought home senior
Lauren Lappin with a single, and
freshman Maddy Coon scored on an
other wild pitch to close the gap to 7-3.
The Cardinal struck again in the
fourth inning, tying the game with a
four-run rally. With the bases loaded,
sophomore Anna Beardman reached
base on an error, which brought two
runs across the plate. Lappin hit a sin
gle to the shortstop for two RBI and
the score was knotted at seven.

"It was just never giving up, never
quitting," Rittman said of his team's
comeback effort. "We have such good
leadership from the seniors and up
perclassmen who have been there be
fore — they know that we are capable
of scoring seven, eight, nine runs in a
game. When you give up that many
runs early, there is a lot of ballgame left
to play. And we took that approach —
that we still had seven innings to play
and we just needed to chip away and
get back in it."
The tie lasted through the seventh,
pushing the game into extra innings.
Alabama's Mandy Burford reached
base on an error and stole second and
third before coming home on an RBI
single. Facing a one-run deficit, the
Cardinal hit into a double play to end
the eighth inning and the game.
The win was Alabama's second of
the series following a 4-1 victory' over
the Cardinal on Friday. With the pair of
victories, the Crimson Fide advanced
to the WCWS.
On Friday, Alabama scored a run in
the second inning and two in the third
before the Cardinal broke through in
the sixth with Penna scoring Rinehart
with an RBI single. The Cardinal
would not score again and the Tide
notched an insurance run in the bot
tom of the sixth for the final margin.
Rinehart had a stellar day at the
plate for Stanford by going 3-for-3. But

the rest of the team could combine for
only more three hits.
"We dealt with some adversity this
year." Rittman said. "When you have
injuries to two of your pitchers —
Penna's smashed thumb and McCul
lough's arm — it can be very hard. But
we battled through that. For a team to
win 42 games when you play the
schedule that we played, that is a suc
cessful season."
Stanford will return next year with
out its five current seniors, including
Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year
Lappin. But the Cardinal will have an
experienced squad of rising juniors
and seniors who are ready to step into
leadership positions.
"Each year is a new year, and this
year's team was special and unique in
many ways," Rittman said. "Next year
the team must develop its own identi
ty. We will need new leaders, but we al
ready have them in our program."
Alabama will next face No. 4
Northwestern in the first round.There
were no significant upsets in this year's
bracket and the eight teams going to
Oklahoma are the tournament's top
eight seeds. Four of those teams, in
cluding top-ranked UCLA, are from
the Pac-10.
