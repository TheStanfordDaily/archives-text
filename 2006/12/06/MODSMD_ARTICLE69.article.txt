## Alabama shatters World Series hopes in Supers 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Giving up seven runs in the first in
ning is not the way to win a softball
game.
And while No. 7 Stanford managed
to fight back and tie the score in the
second game of their series with No. 5
Alabama, the No. 12 seeded Cardinal
ultimately lost the game and the series
in this weekend's NCAA Super Re
gional.
The Crimson Tide had put seven
runs on the board by the time the Car
dinal (42- IS) took their first at-bat,but
the Stanford batters quickly plated
three of their own in the first inninn

and tied the game in the fourth. De
spite this unlikely comeback, Alabama
(54- 1 )) eventually took the 8-7 extra-in
nings win on Saturday. 1 laving already
posted a 4-1 victory Friday, Alabama
advanced to the Women's College
World Series with the win.
"Any time you lose the last game of
the season, it's difficult," Stanford head
coach John Rittman said."l felt like the
effort was there but our execution was
not the best. Honestly. 1 think we just
ran out of time. We rallied back from a
big deficit and just fell short. It's tough,
but 1 was proud of the way we fought ."
