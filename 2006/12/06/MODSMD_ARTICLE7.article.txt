### SAM BHAGWAT STAFF WRITER 
Iliree more rooms in Alondra have been quar
antined as Housing officials move to stop the
spread of bedbugs in the dorm and beyond.
Freshman Dean Schaffer said that residents
have bedbugs, and little else, on the brain.
"I saw a bug in my room under my bed last night
and 1 freaked." said Schaffer. a copy editor for The
Daily. "It was just a beetle, but [bedbugs] are the
first thing you think about."
Freshman Danny Clarkson.who had to evacuate
his room Monday night due to bedbugs, said being
aware of the infestation led he and his roommate to
Alvin discover the critters in their one-room double.
"Because of it [spreading], we decided to do a
thorough cleaning on Saturday afternoon." he said.
"Alvin didn't find anything, but 1 found two in my
bed frame."
Residents say that exterminator Rich Crane has
become a fixture of the dorm.
"1 see him all the time — he ate dinner here last
night." Schaffer said.
Whitney said that despite the new quarantines,
he is confident that the infestation is under control.
"The goal is to stay in front of it."he said. "It's
more than we've had in recent years, but once
you've dealt with it. you're done."
Clarkson said that while he wasn't particularly
pleased to vacate his room.he was glad that he and
his roommate reported the infestation, fhe first
students to find bedbugs in their
room, he added, were less lucky.
Those Alondra residents, whose
room had hosted bedbugs since
September, are unlikely to have
any of their belongings returned to
them.
"Crane said that in that room
there were two million plus bedbugs
and eggs," said Clarkson, who is
staying temporarily in Governor's
Corner. "Because we reported it
early, we're going to have all of oui
stuff intact."
