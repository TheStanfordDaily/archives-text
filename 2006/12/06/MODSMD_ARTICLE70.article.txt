# Best of INTERMISSION
## When your dad is more rock and roll than you are 
### NATE SOLON INTERMISSION ROCK CRITIC 
"Your clad is loving his hand. I think he's going to quit
his job." said my mom. I laughed. My dad is a professor
of economics at a highly respected university. "I'm not
joking," she said.
For as long as I can remember, we've had a drum set
(rock and roll variety, purchased circa I960) in my base
ment. Every so often, my dad would disappear and a
rhythmic racket would waft up through the house. A few
years ago he started an economics parody hand with his
co-workers for the department skit night. So far, so
nerdy.
But things got weird when he started laying down
drum tracks for a band of three grad students. They call
themselves S Apostrophe,or,jovially, the Plural Posses
sive. Apparently they liked his drum work, because he
gradually became a full-Hedged member of the band. A
real, actual band.
All those years of practice in our basement actually
made him quite good. It's almost as though his entire
adult life was nothing but an elaborate gestation in
preparation for this triumphant return to adolescence.
Suddenly the 45-year-old co-workers waving tam
bourines in our basement were replaced with indie
looking 20-somethings with real guitars and amps, who
chatted and drank beers while I paced around upstairs.
Every so often I had to stifle a strange urge to scream
down the stairs,"Will you kids cut it the hell out?!"
Soon they were playing real gigs in real venues, like
the Blind Pig. which has hosted the Smashing Pumpkins
and Nirvana, among others. About a month ago, they re
leased their debut CI). 1 Was Born in the Dollar Store.
Recently, they were featured on NPR's Open Mic.
They say it's a sad day when a father outlives his son.
When a father outcools his son, that's downright de

pressing. The album is ... well, it's pretty good. When 1
tell people my dad's in a band, 1 think they expect some
sort of retro rock. Maybe 70s covers, something like
that. But that's not the sort of music S Apostrophe plays.
Or. for that matter, listens to. 1 thought I was pretty
cool when I discovered the Pixies in high school, until I
found all their CDs already neatly filed in my dad's col
lection. On their website (www.sapostrophe.com) the
band lists their influences as Garrison Keillor. Paul Mc-
Cartney, Johnnie Walker. Frank Black and Zack Morris.
When I played the album for my friends. Spoon and the
Shins came up.
The songs on Dollar Store range from rockabilly
hand-clapper "Yellow Fever!" to moodier melodies like
"Whiskey & Robitussin." The lyrics display a literary
bent in their self-conscious manipulation of language:
"When the pretense runs shallow / and the shadows
creep cross the floor, /1 sit at my window and watch the
wind blow / without a metaphor." But they also let their
hair down in non sequiturs held together by unexpected
rhymes: "We could ditch purgatory if we wrote our life
stories about marzipan and broken glasses fresh-cut
lawns recycled plastics car alarms the light fantastic old
red barns and new black caskets..."
Ultimately this album is about missed opportunities,
failed romances, the way life seems to build you up and
let you down. But the upbeat melodies and skewed
humor keep it from getting bogged down in its own ru
minations.

http://www.mvspace.com/sapostrophe. The CD is for
sale at their website (www.sapostrophe.com) and in the

ition isn't paying itself
