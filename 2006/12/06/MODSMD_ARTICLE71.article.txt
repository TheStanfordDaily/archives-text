# Intermission Roundhouse kicks it with Chuck Norris
## 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION TEXAS RANGER 
Last week i interviewed The
Chuck Norris via conference call,
and though cretins from Alabama
and some creepy old guy from the
Hallmark Channel kept cramping
my style, it was nothing short of won
drous. 1 miraculously grew a beard
right after this interview, no joke.
INT: Outside of legally changing my
name and possibly committing fraud,
what could I do to grow up to be just
like you?
CN: Well. I changed my name too. You
know my real name is Carlos actually.
INT: Yeah...
(Awkward pause)
INT: Anyways, as a six-time unde
feated World Professional Mid
dleweight Karate Champion, did you
really teach Bob Barker karate?
CN: I taught Bob for several years.
I le's 82 years old. maybe 83 now. but
he still trains every morning in his
garage that we converted into a gym.
The guy's incredible; he's still in in
credible shape.
INT: What about his movie?
CN: Happy Gilmore, yeah. When he
did that, the first thing he did was call
me to find out if I'd seen the movie.
And I said of course I've seen the
movie, I had to see Boh do his karate.
INT: Wow. A lot of the college age
kids look up to you as some sort of a
mythical hero now because of these
Chuck Norris facts on the Internet.
CN: Oh those fact things, the Chuck
Norris
-INT. Yeah, yeah.
CN: Yeah...l tell you this has been
quite amazing to me because I've
been getting e-mails from Iraq and
Afghanistan and the troops over
there are saying that, you know,
they're making their own facts up
and exchanging them from post to
post.
INTThere're some crazy facts.
CN: I tell you. there are. some of
them are really, but 1 tell you they're
fun. some of them are funny as heck
though. You know, it was first college
kids and then it dropped down to the
high school kids, now I'm getting e
mails from middle school kids send
ing me their Chuck Norris facts.
INT: Ever since Conan O'Brien
started airing clips from Walker...
CN: Can you believe that?
INT: The clips he takes out of con
text...
CN: Did you see when I went down
and did his show and I beat him up?
INT: Yeah, that was hilarious.
CN: Conan called me and says, you
know, why don't you come down
here and beat me up. I said well.okay,
that sounds like fun. Conan said he
tried to switch it to Knight Rider but

the audience started booing so he
said 1 had to go back to Walker. But
it's like this Chuck Norris fact thing,
you know.
INT: Actually I think that's how that
started.
CN: It was a kid named lan Spector,
a freshman at Brown, who started
the fact thing.
INT: Right. An unrelated question:
why do you think that the Bible
should be taught in every public
school?
CN: Well.as an elective. I've studied a
lot of different eastern religions even
though I'm still a Christian. I don't
see why people can't do the same
thing with the Bible. 11l at doesn't
mean they have to become a Christ
ian, if they're not a Christian.just.you
know, become familiar with it.
INT: Right...When did you first learn
how to roundhouse kick?
CN: 1 was sent to Korea in I %() in the
military. I enrolled in a judo class on
the base there and about two weeks
into my training 1 got thrown wrong
and I broke my shoulder. So 1 took a
walk out into the Osan village just
kind of sightseeing. And as I'm walk
ing through the village, 1 look down
and I see these Korean guys jumping
and doing these incredible kicks in
the air. And I says holy macarol. you
know. I didn't think the human body
could do something like that. It mes
merized me.
LN: Wow. So how many people have
you roundhouse kicked in your life
time?
C'N: Thousands.
I NT: Thousands?
CN: Thousands, oh my gosh, think
about it. I've done 23 movies and I've
done 203 episodes of Walker. Texas
Ranger and then 10 years of lighting
in the ring so you could imagine how
many roundhouse kicks I've thrown
in that period of time. Not even
counting my teachings over the last

15 years. You can put it in the high
thousands.
INT: So is it true that in 1997 you
were the first man ever in the west
ern hemisphere to be awarded an
eighth degree black belt?
CN: Yeah. I was the first to receive
my eighth degree black belt. It was
really an honor because 1 didn't
think the Koreans would ever let a
non-Korean ever receive a Grand
Master ranking.
INT: So what does being an eighth
degree black belt involve, besides
lots of roundhouse kicking?
CN: Nothing, that's about it. It's
more of what you've done for the
martial arts at that particular stage of
your life.
INT: Just to clarify, could you round
house kick me through the phone
right now?
CN: Probably. You want me to?
INT: Yes.
CN: Hiya!
(Mr. Norris then roundhouse kicked
me through the phone. Ouch.)
INT: So is the roundhouse kick your
favorite move of all time?
CN: It was my point getter back in
the old days. When I was behind that
was generally the one that 1 could
move in on and actually score.
INT: Awesome.
CN: Actually I've knocked out more
guys with that roundhouse kick then
any other kick.
INT: Wow. So when was the last time
you shaved that beard?
CN: Well 1 shaved it probably about
five years ago but it didn't stay off
very long; 1 grew the beard for Lone
Wolf McQuade and I just liked the
look of it. My wife would really pre
fer I shave. But I just. 1 don't know. 1
just like it. you know...
I'm going to go put some ice on my
roundhouse kick-related wound.
