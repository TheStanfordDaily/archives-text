### MS. MANNERS MANNERS EXPERT 
Dear Ms. Manners.
My roommate is a little too chummy with her
snooze button. Whenever it goes off. she pushes it re
peatedly. every eight minutes, for the next hour...
every...single...morning. Even though she has class
much earlier than me. I haven't been able to enjoy
that precious last hour of rest every morning be
cause I'm a really light sleeper. I'd be willing to do
anything for uninterrupted slumber. Suggestions?
— Frazzled and Fatigued in FloMo
Dear Fatigued.
If you're feeling disgruntled about your lack of
sleep and want to go the meaner route, you should
just turn your roommate's alarm off either after the
first snooze-hit or sometime at night after she goes
to sleep. After she misses class a few times, she'll
learn not to be so friendly with Mr. Snooze. Unfortu
nately. she will also have a vendetta against you un
less if you can convince her that mysterious furry
night creatures are responsible for tampering with
the alarm (the thought will probably keep her up so
the alarm won't be needed anyway).
Then again, you're already tired so you might as
well have fun with this. Here are some creative sug
gestions if you don't mind sacrificing even more
sleep in hopes to potentially sever the tie between
your roommate and the Snooze (keep in mind that
you may simultaneously sever the ties between you
and your roommate in the process. Oops!) Place her
alarm in an unreachable place — a pile of laundry,
right outside of the door or, if you're feeling extra
devious, tie it from the ceiling and suspend it inches
above her desperately drowsy grasp. You could also
borrow or purchase multiple alarms, set them to the
same time and scatter them throughout the room. I
offer both of these suggestions in hopes that by actu
ally getting up, your roommate will be roused from
sleep — if she is willing to get up. search, press mul
tiple buttons, half-contemplate if she's going insane
and STILL get back into bed only to do it all over

again eight minutes later, you are out of luck. kid.
If you'd rather forgo passive-aggressiveness for
all-out rage, there are several options for you. Like
throwing the alarm out the window (after angrily
ripping out the screen). You could also snip the
chord, take out the batteries, cancel Cingular or de
molish whatever else is keeping that alarm alive.
Your neighbors might think you're a little whack
when you walk out of the room with a sledgeham
mer and a bunch o' wires, but whatever. It's for a
good cause.
Actually, you could just, you know, talk your
roommate about her snoozing issues. That'd proba
bly be the easiest thing to d 0... short of getting ear
plugs.
Dear Ms. Manners,
My roommate is driving me nuts. When she
wakes up, she's on her cell phone. Before she goes to
sleep,she's on her cell phone. In between her classes,
she's on her cell phone. Basically,she's always on her
cell phone. I adore her and all, but I really hate her
cell phone. I low can I get her to stop talking so much
on the phone while in our room? — Ticked in Toyon
Dear Ticked,
Ibis is a tough one. My knee-jerk response is to
tell your roommate to talk in the hallway instead.
But then everybody in the dorm will get annoyed
and within days she will be known around the dorm
as "the girl that's always on her phone," And you
wouldn't want to do that to your beloved roomie,
would you? Yeah. I didn't think so. So on to some

other suggestions.
The easiest would he to somehow "accidentally"
break her phone, but chances are she'll get it fixed in
a jiffy so that's a no-go. If she's talking to her
boyfriend or best friend, you could always try to un
dermine their relationship by saying things like," You
know... your boyfriend calls an awful lot. Are you
sure he isn't dependent on you and trying to distract
you from more important things like studying and
not driving your roommate nuts?" Or you could an
swer the phone when your roommate's in the bath
room, yelling into the receiver, "Hey roomie, that
crazy friend that you always complain about is call
ing." That ought to guarantee at least a week of silent
treatment between them, which translates into a
week of peace and quiet for you.
If you're feeling more industrious and have some
friends in the mechanical engineering department,
you could fashion a sound-proof booth around your
roommate's bed. There are lots of benefits to this
one, so if you have the resources, I'd get cracking
now. No need to worry about the confusion it will
cause during room inspections come winter break
— as long as the booth isn't lit by candles or halogen
lights, you're good to go.
Another suggestion is to convince your room
mate to switch to Verizon. Her reception will be so
bad inside of the dorm that she'll have no chance but
to go outside. Although you'll probably have to put
up with her saying. "Hello!? Hello!? I can't hear
you" l(X) times a day.it'll be worth it when she leaves
the room in exasperation, waving her phone spasti
cally as she searches for reception.
Actually, you could just, you know, talk your room
mate about her cell phone issues. Tliat'd probably be
the easiest thing to d 0... short of getting ear plugs.
