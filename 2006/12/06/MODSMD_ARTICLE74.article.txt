# Here we have our Renoir

### AMY STEINBERG INTERMISSION ARTISTE 
The thing about art in a gallery is that it is just that:
art. in a gallery. A typical gallery wall is a blank, sterile
abyss and erases any telling context for the images it
supports. For the painting on this backdrop, there is no
definite history or inevitable future, only the relevance
we manufacture between the object and our world
today. While there are many logical reasons for organiz
ing art this way, the viewer is always left to her own de
vices in reconstructing the life of a work of art, for bet
ter or for worse.
The curators of "A New 19th Century: The Mondavi
Family Gallery Reinstalled." however, have taken a dif
ferent approach to gallery construction that nudges the
viewer into a Victorian paradigm. Instead of meticulously
wiping out any contextual traces, the curators have care
fully orchestrated the gallery to present the objects as they
would have existed in their infancy: in the home of a
prominent, upper class 19th century family. A family who
may just have had "Beat Cal" emblazoned on their front
door and a young Leland Jr. running around out back.
The room itself is a cornflower blue- an unusual color
choice which. I'm told, really makes the paintings "pop."
Accents of white in the pillars, moldings, and wooden pan
eling contrast with the blue to compose an interior Victo
rian ambience. Two columns mark the front "doorway"
and support Jean Coulon's Celestial 1 lebe and Pierre Eu
gene Emile Hebert'sMephistopheles. Straight through the
columns is the dining room, where the culinary arts are se
ductively idealized in 1 lenri Fantin-Latour's Still Life with
Fruit,and where stylistic renditions of trompe l'oleil paint
ings. which oftentimes feature freshly hunted game, en
hance the masculine undertones of a Victorian feast (while
also providing a rather poignant case for vegetarianism).
Continuing towards the right,past a variation on I larnett 's
The Old Violin, (at this point, in the fashion of a concerned
tour guide, I should warn you to watch your step over the
large red carpet),you will enter the parlor. I lere. in what is
officially titled "The Collector's Corner." is an amalgama
tion of works by both American and European artists,
which are vertically stacked and horizontally cramped in
the typical display formation of a 19th century parlor.
Through the parlor we enter the ballroom, where William
Keith's Upper Kern River demands the back wall - a posi
tion it actually occupied in the Stanford's mansion - along

with various other harmonizing landscapes.
Beginning to circle back around, we pass by Degas'
bronze mold entitled Grand Arabesque, and nearly over
look the early experimental, post-impressionist Picasso
(yes. Picasso!) in oil.The back left corner is a tribute to
the western frontier, featuring Bierstadt'sThe Last of the
Buffalo in dramatic dialogue with a glass case of Native
American beaded works. William Keith's electric Sunset
on Mount Diablo (Marin Sunset) guides us to the next al
cove that explores the development of photography into
film before we arrive in the paper and prints section. It is
here that a study of watercolor techniques and travel mo
tifs culminate in a small countryside rendering by Monet.
Finally we conclude in the portraiture room, where, look
ing up at an adorable, yet seemingly bossy young man by
the name of Gordon Fairchild (by John Singer Sargeant)
I began to ponder why it is that students should visit this
gallery...aside from the very pretty pictures.
Art in a gallery is art in a gallery. Most of the time, no
matter how much 1 study the subject and no matter how
much 1 enjoy looking, I just don't get it. But the rein
stalled Mondavi Gallery is more of a collection of senti
mental mementos, like walking through a house of a fam
ily dead and gone and piecing together who they were by
the objects that hung on their walls. Simply by setting a
context through image arrangement and plaster columns,
the art in this gallery becomes a series of clues that beg
the question, what compilation of objects would accu
rately remember you? It may sound like a materialistic
quest for self-realization, but it is something to consider
during this infamous time of "finding yourself." So visit
for some ideas of what great individuals have left behind,
for the beautiful ride to cantor and, if nothing else, visit
for the pretty pictures.
Or, if that didn't work, here is some serious name
dropping in the spirit of promotional clips for the arts:
Monet. Picasso, Renoir, Sargeant, Corot.
