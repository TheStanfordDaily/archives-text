## Pimpettes and Hos 
### ALEX GOVERE INTERMISSION PAR-TAY 
Pimps and Hos. Back To
School. Let's Get Physical. Why is
it that campus parties are always
given names that encourage girls
to dress like strippers, school-girls
or some other variant of the com
mon whore? I've even been to a
winter event that somehow man
aged to put a naked twist on
things: Snowboarders & Snow
Bunnies. In this case, "snow" was
just another word for "Playboy,"
and any female who didn't trek
across campus in a matching bra
panty-ugg ensemble wasn't al
lowed in. Apparently, guys snow
board in warm pants and thick
jackets, but us girls always hit the
slopes in our lingerie.
Inequality? Sexism? 1 think so.
Wait! Don't stop reading!
There will be 110 feminist (or sub
stantive...) rants in this article. 1
understand every man's need to
see some boobies, I understand
every girl's reasons for showing
some boobies, and I'm pretty
sure the frats will never be down
for a night of Pimps and Re
spectable Young Ladies." Rather
than even the score by suggest

ing a "Pope" theme for SAE's
next party. I'd like to bring an
other concept to the table: Pim
pettes and I los.
The P&H party - should it ever
occur - will be just like any other.
Drinks, music, awkward encoun
ters. However, unlike your average
rave, male attendants will be re
quired to come naked. 1 wanna see
man-boobs, 1 wanna see beer guts
and (I realize I'm about to break
rule numero uno in the unwritten
book of macho laws, but...) 1 wanna
see thighs.
Here's the formal invite to my non
existent party:
What' ? Pimpettes and 1 los
Where ? Anywhere, as long as
male attendants are dressed (or
rather undressed) for the occasion.
When' ? On the coldest night
of the quarter.
Why ? Because Stanford boys
don't fully understand what it's
like to walk from Mirrielees to the
Row on a chilly Friday night. Be
cause the deservingly narcissistic
frat bovs need to be distinguished

from the "but-his-faces." And.
most importantly, because Free
Willy is every girl's favorite
movie.
Anything else, you
crazy bitch?
Yes. 1 hate those awkward mo
ments at parties when the lights
turn on for a few seconds. You
know what I'm talking about.They
generally happen near closing
time. when the residents of a once
clean and puke-free house want
you to get the hell out The lights
flash, and you suddenly regret not
holding a lit phone to your part
ner's face before agreeing to hit the
dance floor. For this reason, and
because I'd like to invoke maxi
mum male-embarrassment I'iin
pettes and 1 los will be fully lit tt :ill
times.
I suppose I should end this with
a clever declaration of who can and
cannot drink. As always, it will be
"SUID to enter, vagina to get with
in 10 feet of the beer." Sorry boys.
Even naked, you ain't gettin' any
where near the alcohol.
