## Defense nominee says U.S. isn't winning in Iraq, wins committee approval 
### ROBERT BURNS ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON —Robert Gates, seemingly
clinching confirmation as the new secretary of de
fense. said Tuesday the United States is not winning
in Iraq and he's confident President Bush will listen
to his ideas about forging a new war strategy.
He won speedy and unanimous approval from
the Senate Armed Services Committee after five
hours ot testimony, a bipartisan show of support that
suggested how eager many lawmakers are to replace
Donald H. Rumsfeld at the Pentagon. The full Sen
ate could seal Gates' confirmation as early as
Wednesday.
in my view, all options are on the table, in terms
of how we address this problem in Iraq." he told the
committee. But he also acknowledged the complexi
ty of the challenge.
"There are no new ideas on Iraq." he said during
a discussion of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group,
which previewed its findings and recommendations
to President Bush Tuesday and will release them

Wednesday. Gates was a member of the group until Bush an
nounced his nomination for the Pentagon job last month.
The senators voted 24-0 to support the nomination to re
place Rumsfeld, w ho has become a symbol of the Bush admin
istration's steadfast course in a war that has long since soured
with the public and much of the world.
" I voted yes because in both the substance of his answers and
the tone of his answers, he seemed open to course correction."
said Carl Levin. D-Mich.. who w ill be the committee's chairman
w hen Democrats take control of the Senate next month.
During his appearance. Gates would not commit to any spe
cific new course of action in the conflict lie said he would con
sult first with commanders and others.
Asked directly by Levin whether the U.S. is w inning in Iraq.
Gates replied. "No. sir." That response appeared to contradict
Bush, who said at an Oct. 25 news conference, "Absolutely,
we're w inning."
Gates later said he believes the United States is neither w in
ning nor losing, "at this point."
His statements on the war — and his professed openness to
change — underscored pressures heaped on Bush since De
mocratic victories in last month's congressional elections,
votes widely read as a rejection of the administration's stead
fast course in the war.
Unrelenting violence by insurgents and between ethnic
groups, and a U.S. death toll that has soared past 2. t XX). have
raised questions about the effectiveness of Iraq's government.
Bush in recent weeks has expressed a willingness to consider a
fresh course in the war. but has shown no sign of a willingness
to heed Democratic calls to start withdrawal of the 140.000
U.S. troops.
Bush has said he wants to keep U.S. forces there until Iraq
is able to govern and defend itself without being a haven for
terrorists.
