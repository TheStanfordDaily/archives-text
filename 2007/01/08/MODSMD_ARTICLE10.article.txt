WASHINGTON [Jan. 5] Newly minted House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi pledged Friday that voters would see
big results from the Democratic majority in Congress. "It's
going to be wonderful for the American people," she said.
"It's such an exciting thing we've come a long way," an
elated Pelosi said at an open house breakfast on Capitol Hill
where hundreds of supporters cheered her election as the
first woman ever to serve as House speaker, two steps from
the presidency. Pelosi, sworn-in on Thursday, presides over
the first Democratic majority since 1994.
Several women in the crowd said they viewed the eleva
tion of the 66-year-old San Francisco Democrat, a mother of
five and grandmother of six, as just the beginning.
"It prepares the nation to receive a woman president, a
female president that's the ice that's been broken," said
Ethel Byndom, 53, of St. Louis, Mo.
