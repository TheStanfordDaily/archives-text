White House on Friday announced that Bush has picked
Adm. William Fallon, who commands American forces in
the Pacific, to replace retiring Gen. John Abizaid as top U.S.
commander in the Middle East, and will nominate Army
Lt. Gen. David Petraeus, who headed the effort to train
Iraqi security forces, to replace Gen. George Casey as top
American general in Iraq. Casey is becoming Army chief of
staff.

as Wednesday, held discussions with his national security ad
visers and then headed out of the White House for a bike
ride. In Baghdad, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki an
