## Happy NEU Year 
### 
One thing former Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld won't have to
worry about in his first year off the
|ob: Old F.urope. No, as Mr. Rumsfeld
stands over his breakfast table in the morn
ing. listening to Fox and reflecting on a se
ries of known unknowns, he is unlikely to
issue a "by golly" in response to more re
ports of demagogic disapproval from the
governments of Berlin, Paris or Madrid. In
an object lesson in laissez-faire regime
change, the politics of an Iraq-angry, Bush
baiting and Debray-delighting Europe are
fast shifting in America's favor. These days
when we look across the pond, are we star
ing at a "coalition of the waiting." as The At
lantic Monthly recently suggested? More
likely, it's a coalition of the now.
This January, as Europeans are welcom
ing in the New Year, they are simultaneous
ly welcoming in the New EU. The 2007
pledge class to the world's largest single
trading bloc includes Romania and Bulgar
ia.The January Ist EU entrance of these for
mer USSR members signifies the virtual
completion of a fifteen-year long project to
absorb the European territory of the former
Soviet Empire. In the 90's. Yeltsin and
friends, pilots of the wingless Russian Fed
eration, watched in helpless anxiety as
Western Europe and the United States
began this process of absorption, stoking
Moscow's perennial fear of geopolitical en
circlement.
Not so today as Russia passes an icy hand
over the best laid plans of Western govern
ments. "Go ahead," Vladimir Putin is saying.
"Take Poland, take Bulgaria — maybe one
day you even take Ukraine. Why should I
care, when the Kremlin is heating every
home from Belarus to Dublin?" It's in the
face of the comeback of the Russian bully
that the erstwhile European bully pulpit has
given over to the familiar advantages of an
American partnership. The diplomatic fall
out from the Iraq war may after all prove to
be much ado about nothing—consider the
trans-Atlantic cooperation on the Iranian
nuclear talks between Washington. London
and our oft-maligned French and German
allies. In this case, the US-EU3 relationship
is being rejuvenated as much by Russia's Se
curity Council shenanigans as bv Tehran's
defiance. Because Russian has lately be
come a language that the Ayatollahs have
taken to heeding — even as German Chan
cellor Angela Merkel seeks to remake Ger
many's Ostpolitik to dull Mr. Putin's energy
weapon — the return of Russia to a posi
tion of power is bringing the US and Europe
together again in broad-reaching and fun
damental ways.
Commentators on improving relations
between the US and "Old Europe" have
pointed to Nicolas Sarkozy (the Yankee
iriendly French leader and probable succes
sor to Mr. Chirac) as the new face of a revi
talized Atlantic partnership. But the real
spotlight should be on the German Foreign
Minister. Frank-Walter Steinnieier. Most
Europeans remember their disappointment
and horror at the revelation that the CIA
has been operating "black site" secret pris
ons and carrying out renditions (sub-legal
extraditions of terrorism suspects for "inter
rogation" purposes) within the borders of
the EU. Yet the outrage has not been so
acute in the case of Mr. Steinnieier. who

may have concealed what he knew about a
CIA rendition of the German citizen el-
Masri (innocent). who was confused with al-
Masri (terrorist). Die Zeit newspaper re
ported last month that, in an appearance be
fore a committee investigating the el-Masri
affair. Mr. Steinnieier as well as Schroder
era minister Joschka Fischer may have to
disclose that they did not provide full disclo
sure in the first place.
ITiis particularly high-up indication of
collusion with the Bush spooks comes on
the heels of a report by a special commis
sion of the European Parliament that con
demned many European governments for
knowing much and doing nothing about
the ClA's legally lazy activities. According
to the BBC, a delegation of parliamentari
ans recently dispatched to investigate
Poland's complicity in CIA renditions has
little hope for holding anyone accountable.
If there are no heads rolling in Warsaw, we
can be sure that Parliamentary oversight
will bag no scapegoats in the capitals of the
senior EU partners. Apart from the one ex
ception of Italy, where prosecutors have
just filed indictments for 25 American op
eratives of the CI A.complicity in rendition
will probably prove little liability for Eu
rope's political heavyweights. Certainly
this will be the case in Germany, which has
just acceded to the EU Presidency and sent
as its representative — guess who —
Frank-Walter Steinnieier. The Presidency
for the second half of 2007 will go to Portu
gal. which, according to an AP report is
sued just before Christmas, is now em
broiled in a scandal much like the one fol
lowing Mr. Steinnieier into office.
So has Old Europe become Our Europe
again? I lave we overcome the days of Free
dom Fries by basking in the natural gas-gen
erated warmth of a revived Red Scare, by
building a common vision in the form of se
cret prison facilities? You'd better believe it.
Because the real Realpolitik players these
days aren't the James Bakers or the Robert
Gateses; they're the after-Chirac after
shock. And if you're not clear on that, drop
an email to Giovanni Claudio Fava and his
team of Parliamentary investigators tasked
with removing the torturer's footprint of the
CIA from European territory. Ask anyone
on that commission which European state
they suspect of the worst collusion with
American interrogators, and they won't say
Germany or Poland or Portugal. Because
the EU state with the biggest new haul of
CIA dump-money is one of the two they
just let into the club—Romania. On the
bright side, maybe we're just using old Sovi
et torture camps instead of building our own
new ones. With all that money saved, a tax
break could be in order.

ly welcoming in the New EU. The 2007
pledge class to the world's largest single
trading bloc includes Romania and Bulgar
ia.The January Ist EU entrance of these for
mer USSR members signifies the virtual
completion of a fifteen-year long project to
absorb the European territory of the former
Soviet Empire. In the 90's. Yeltsin and
friends, pilots of the wingless Russian Fed
eration, watched in helpless anxiety as
Western Europe and the United States
began this process of absorption, stoking
Moscow's perennial fear of geopolitical en
circlement.
Not so today as Russia passes an icy hand
over the best laid plans of Western govern
ments. "Go ahead," Vladimir Putin is saying.
"Take Poland, take Bulgaria — maybe one
day you even take Ukraine. Why should I
care, when the Kremlin is heating every
home from Belarus to Dublin?" It's in the
face of the comeback of the Russian bully
that the erstwhile European bully pulpit has
given over to the familiar advantages of an
American partnership. The diplomatic fall
out from the Iraq war may after all prove to
be much ado about nothing—consider the
trans-Atlantic cooperation on the Iranian
nuclear talks between Washington. London
and our oft-maligned French and German
allies. In this case, the US-EU3 relationship
is being rejuvenated as much by Russia's Se
curity Council shenanigans as bv Tehran's
defiance. Because Russian has lately be
come a language that the Ayatollahs have
taken to heeding — even as German Chan
cellor Angela Merkel seeks to remake Ger
many's Ostpolitik to dull Mr. Putin's energy
weapon — the return of Russia to a posi
tion of power is bringing the US and Europe
together again in broad-reaching and fun
damental ways.
Commentators on improving relations
between the US and "Old Europe" have
pointed to Nicolas Sarkozy (the Yankee
iriendly French leader and probable succes
sor to Mr. Chirac) as the new face of a revi
talized Atlantic partnership. But the real
spotlight should be on the German Foreign
Minister. Frank-Walter Steinnieier. Most
Europeans remember their disappointment
and horror at the revelation that the CIA
has been operating "black site" secret pris
ons and carrying out renditions (sub-legal
extraditions of terrorism suspects for "inter
rogation" purposes) within the borders of
the EU. Yet the outrage has not been so
acute in the case of Mr. Steinnieier. who

may have concealed what he knew about a
CIA rendition of the German citizen el-
Masri (innocent). who was confused with al-
Masri (terrorist). Die Zeit newspaper re
ported last month that, in an appearance be
fore a committee investigating the el-Masri
affair. Mr. Steinnieier as well as Schroder
era minister Joschka Fischer may have to
disclose that they did not provide full disclo
sure in the first place.
ITiis particularly high-up indication of
collusion with the Bush spooks comes on
the heels of a report by a special commis
sion of the European Parliament that con
demned many European governments for
knowing much and doing nothing about
the ClA's legally lazy activities. According
to the BBC, a delegation of parliamentari
ans recently dispatched to investigate
Poland's complicity in CIA renditions has
little hope for holding anyone accountable.
If there are no heads rolling in Warsaw, we
can be sure that Parliamentary oversight
will bag no scapegoats in the capitals of the
senior EU partners. Apart from the one ex
ception of Italy, where prosecutors have
just filed indictments for 25 American op
eratives of the CI A.complicity in rendition
will probably prove little liability for Eu
rope's political heavyweights. Certainly
this will be the case in Germany, which has
just acceded to the EU Presidency and sent
as its representative — guess who —
Frank-Walter Steinnieier. The Presidency
for the second half of 2007 will go to Portu
gal. which, according to an AP report is
sued just before Christmas, is now em
broiled in a scandal much like the one fol
lowing Mr. Steinnieier into office.
So has Old Europe become Our Europe
again? I lave we overcome the days of Free
dom Fries by basking in the natural gas-gen
erated warmth of a revived Red Scare, by
building a common vision in the form of se
cret prison facilities? You'd better believe it.
Because the real Realpolitik players these
days aren't the James Bakers or the Robert
Gateses; they're the after-Chirac after
shock. And if you're not clear on that, drop
an email to Giovanni Claudio Fava and his
team of Parliamentary investigators tasked
with removing the torturer's footprint of the
CIA from European territory. Ask anyone
on that commission which European state
they suspect of the worst collusion with
American interrogators, and they won't say
Germany or Poland or Portugal. Because
the EU state with the biggest new haul of
CIA dump-money is one of the two they
just let into the club—Romania. On the
bright side, maybe we're just using old Sovi
et torture camps instead of building our own
new ones. With all that money saved, a tax
break could be in order.
