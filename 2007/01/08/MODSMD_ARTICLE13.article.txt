So 112 m from Alabama. (Kind of. But let's
not get into that again.)
Some people find this hard to believe,
that anybody lives in a place like Alabama.
It's like being from Montana, or Luxem
bourg. Sure, people have heard that these
places exist, but I guess they don't think that
people from there will ever leave. Or maybe
just that they will ever meet those people.
At least that's what I assume, because
there's no other way to explain the respons
es 1 get when I say I grew up in Alabama.
Like, "Do you know my friend? He's from
[insert name of tiny town here.] OH WAI T,
he's actually from Georgia. Anyway, do you
know him?" Because, of course, there are
only about a hundred people in the entire
South,and we're all related.
Other times, people just make a bemused
face, as it to say. "Oh, so people actually live
there? Hut my favorite response, by far, is
when they whisper conspiratorially, "So
what's it really like... down there?" 0r."50...
what did they tell you... you know, about the
Civil War?"
I really never know what to say. Well, ex
cept the second one â€” then I say accusato
rily, "You mean the War of Northern Ag
gression. Yankee?" But I think they expect
me to exclaim."Oh, let me tell y'all a story,"
and then spin a good yarn about the time
800 Radley saved Scout and her brother, or
how much the Sheriff liked my Mamma's fa
mous chitlins.
But I really don't have any yarns.good or
otherwise. Although I say I'm from Birm
ingham for clarity's sake. I actually grew up
in the quiet middle-class suburbs outside of
the city. My public high school was only built
about ten years before I started going there,

and our AP and IB history classes taught the
Civil War just like everybody else did. (The
South won. right?)
1 was actually a pretty terrible southern
er. at least according to conventional wis
dom. 1 spent my weekends at the mall rather
than the swimmin' hole. I've never had real
grits or okra. I've never been to a cotillion or
a Civil War reenactment. And. worst of all. 1
think that barbeque and fried green toma
toes are only so-so.
As someone in my dorm remarked." You
didn't grow up in the real South, did you?"
Maybe not. Maybe I was led astray by the
"Heart of Dixie" license plates and only
thought I was growing up in the South.
Maybe because my family is Finnish rather
than southern and I grew up in a new com
munity. I missed out on the Alabama expe
rience. It's true that most of my classmates
wouldn't have considered me southern. But
then again. I went to school with people
from Peru. Mexico, India. Saudi Arabia.
China and Ecuador (to name a few), so they
probably didn't consider themselves south
ern either.
Anyway. I think it's pretty clear that
whatever dirt people want to hear about
the South, they're not going to hear it from
