Student outraged with bike ticket

On Tuesday October 29th. I was riding my
bike to class when I was pulled over by Offi
cer Fenton of the Stanford Department of
Public Safety. I was written a ticket for riding
my bike while wearing headphones, a viola
tion of Section 274(H) of the California Vehi
cle Code.
There are several reasons why I'm so out
raged by this frivolous case of law enforce
ment. First, I find it amazing that the Stanford
Sheriff s Department and the Palo Alto Police
have so little to do that they spend time writ
ing tickets to students for riding their bikes.
According to the crime statistics published on
Stanford's website, there were 262 robberies
and 4 forcible sexual assaults on Stanford's
campus in 2(X)5.1 would think that the Police
Department's time would be better spent
solving and preventing these types of crimes
rather than ticketing me for what amounts to
an infraction based on a technicality.
The second reason that I'm upset is be

cause of the severity of the penalty. For my
egregious infraction, I was fined what I con
sider to be an excessive $118. To some, this
may not seem like much, hut to me, a student
at a very expensive university. $118 is quite a
lot of money. Since getting the ticket, I've had
to get a job in order to earn the money to pay
for the fine. This has taken time away from
my studies, time I truly cannot afford to lose.
I find it disappointing that the officer who
wrote me the ticket didn't take into consider
ation what I 'd be penalized — to me, it shows
a lack of judgment and compassion. I'm sure
some would argue that the officers are just
doing their job — they are responsible for
enforcing the law, not interpreting it. Howev
er, I would hope that our police officers are
more than just thoughtless robots, mindlessly
going about their jobs. I would hope that they
execute some judgment while practicing
their profession. In my situation, however, it
appears that this was not the case.
finally, I'd just like to comment on myself
as a cyclist. In the three years since I've start-

Ed riding. I've traversed over 25.(XX) miles on
my bike. That is just over the circumference
of the earth (24.900 miles). In all of those
miles, I have never been in an accident or had
any problem with cars on the roadway. And.
tor each one those miles, I have worn head
phones. I love listening to music while on the
bike because it helps break up the monotony
and loneliness of a long ride. This is the first
time anyone has ever said anything to me
about the headphones, and unfortunately, it
has cost me quite a bit. It is my hope in writ
ing this letter that someone in a position of
authority can realize that this issue is not
worthy of the limited time and resources of
the police. Actions such as this, in my opinion,
trivialize the work of the police department,
which is, needless to say, anything but trivial.
Please, direct your efforts elsewhere — there
are much more important things for you to
do.Thank you.
