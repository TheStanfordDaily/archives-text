tus of art, joined the studio art facul

until his retirement in 1994.
Mona supported her husband's
work and art and also devoted her
self to the couple's three children,
making the Stanford campus her
home.
"She loved the University and
displayed that care and concern
whenever she could." Nathan
Oliveira said. 1 le added that she was
a member of the Stanford Faculty
Women's Club and embraced his for
mer students when they visited.
"My students remember her just
as much as they remember me, their
teacher," he said.

Since 1964, the couple had donat
ed more than MX) pieces to the Can
tor Center for Visual Arts.
Mona also left her mark is in the
Stanford Athletics fan section. The
daughter of a former Cincinnati
Reds baseball player. Mona devel
oped her enthusiasm for sports
early on. In her time at Stanford, she
was an energetic fixture at home
games.
"They'll miss her at the basketball
games, because she was probably
yelling at all the referees." Nathan
Oliveira said. "Stanford loyalists
would look up and ask. Who's that
lady yelling up there?"'
Mona's exuberance for Stanford
athletics was recounted by her son
Joe.
"She kept scores at all the games,
and we always had season tickets for
football, baseball, and basketball."
he said. "It was really fun to go with
her because she'd get really worked
up. As a young kid growing up on the
campus it was fun to have a mom like
that."
Mona's passions also included
wanderlust, and once their children
were grown, the couple became avid
globetrotters.
"Whenever I'd mention travel,
she was ready to go," Nathan
Oliveira said.
One of Mona's favorite places
was Italy, where the couple traveled a
number of times, once spending a
quarter at the overseas campus in
Florence.
Joe Oliveira remembers his moth
er as warm and loyal. "She was al
ways on your side." he said.
I le reflected on one recent mem
orv with his mother, when thev went

ti) a family friend's party in San Fran
cisco.
"My mom loved to dance — like
big hand dance, swing — and the
dance floor was wide open. There
was no one dancing, but there were a
lot of people there. My mom asked it
I would dance with her, and it was
just the two of us on this huge dance
floor in front of all these people." Joe
Oliveira said.
Nathan Oliveira described his
wife as a witty, honest, and caring
woman as well as a devoted friend.
"All the good things you can
imagine about a woman — that was
my wife." he said.
The couple had been working to
wards establishing an on-campus
meditative center, which would fea
ture some of Nathan Oliveira's
paintings.
"She was very firmly behind that
and felt there had to be a place for
students and others on the campus to
go and sit and collect themselves and
fortify themselves internally," he
said.
Several alumni have already con
tributed to the project, which is wait
ing for a site on which to build.
"There's great promise, and it will
happen soon." he said. "Mona was
waiting for that to happen, and it
would be nice to name it after her."
Mona is survived by Nathan and
her brother Neal Christensen of
Hayward: three children, Lisa Lam
oure of Fresno. C Jin a Oliveira of
Kihea, Maui, and Joe Oliveira of
Palo Alto; and five grandchildren. In
lieu of flowers, donations may be
made to Pathways Hospice Founda
