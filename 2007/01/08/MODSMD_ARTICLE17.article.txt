## Genetics prof, wins Kyoto Prize Herzeberger honored for 1969 invention 
### ADA YEE STAFF WRITER 
Genetics Prof. Len Herzenberg
accepted the Kyoto Prize last month
for his contributions to biotechnolo
gy. including his pivotal role in devel
oping the Fluorescence-Activated
Cell Sorter (FACS) machine that has
transformed both the research and
medicine.
"Yes, it was a surprise," said
1 ler/.enberg. who was visited by rep
resentatives of the Inamori Founda
tion — the body which funds the
Kyoto Prize and oversees naming of
its recipients — last May. The award
was announced a month later.
"I asked them how many candi
dates there were, but they wouldn't
say." recalled I lerzenberg of the May
visit. "It was only later that I learned
there were three candidates for three
prizes!"
The Kvoto Prize was established

in 1 984 by Japanese businessman and
ceramics engineer Kazuo Inamori.
Modeled after the Nobel Prize, the
Kyoto Prize was designed "to honor
people who have made extraordi
nary contributions to science, civi
lization. and spirituality." The In
amori Foundation gives awards an
nually in each of three categories: ad
vanced technology (including
biotechnology, engineering and in
formation science), basic sciences,
and arts and philosophy.
lliough the Kyoto is often com
pared to the Nobel in terms of pres
tige and significance, it should come
as no surprise that Herzenberg,
teaching at Stanford since 1959, is a
laureate. Since its inventions nearly
40 years ago, the FACS has become
übiquitous in research labs and clini
cal settings and played part in every
thing from stem cell research to
leukemia and AIDS diagnosis.
"The FACS has been used pretty
broadly in mouse as well as human
immu n ol ogy,*' H erzenberg sa id." But
the applications have been much
broader than immunology.the FACS
is used in almost all of cell biology
and medicine."

The FACS machine sorts single
cells based on their fluorescent prop
erties: cells can he treated with anti
bodies tagged with a colored fluo
rochrome since the antibodies only
bind to a specific protein of interest.
Inside the machine, cells are sus
pended in a stream surrounded by
sheath fluid, which races past a laser
at a rate of 5,000 to 10.000 cells per
second. The stream breaks into tens
of thousands of drops, which are
charged and then sorted. The laser
detects fluorescence and translates
its readouts to a computer, which
charges the drops, after which
charged plates shuttle cells into the
appropriate bin.
Herzenberg developed the very
first FACS machine in 1969, combin
ing biology with technology devel
oped at Los Alamos National Labo
ratories for sorting small particles —
in particular, fallout from atomic
bomb testing — based on size. Hie
first commercial FACS machine was
released in collaboration with the
company Becton-Dickinson (BD).
Another important milestone in the

development of the FACS was the
use of monoclonal antibodies, which
are antibodies made from "hybrido
mas," or B-cells that have been "im
mortalized" by fusing with a cancer
cell. Compared to traditional poly
clonal antibodies, monoclonal anti
bodies are much more specific and
extremely useful. Herzenberg is
credited with making fluorochrome
labeled monoclonal antibodies
widely available to scientists, in a sys
tem whereby scientists who devel
oped monoclonal antibodies turned
them over to BD for labeling, and
HI) would then continue to manu
facture the antibody for general sale.
"Prior to monoclonal antibodies,
everyone had to make their own an
tibodies in small amounts," Herzen
berg said. "My wife and I felt that it
would be a great boon for everyone
to have the same antibodies as
everyone else. Using this method, we
could distribute the antibodies very
widely as well as make the company
a profit. Using the marketplace was
better than rationing, which hadn't
worked because different scientists
need very different amounts of anti

body depending on the type of re
search they were doing."
ITie FACS machine has continu
ally evolved. Over the years, the
number of available color labels has
increased exponentially as re
searchers have isolated more of
these markers from algae and other
sources. Jellyfish genes can be incor
porated into a cell's DNA and are
frequently used to sort cells with the
FACS.The Herzenberg lab also con
tinues to hone FACS technology,
with the development of m tchines
that can read several colors simulta
neously and new ways to process
FACS data.
In addition to improvin upon
the FACS's capabilities >tself,
Herzenberg's lab has appl d the
FACS in diverse areas. For e mple,
they have recently used the 1- CS to
investigate the role of white blood
cells in cystic fibrosis — research of
which has resulted in Phase 11 trials
for treatment of the disease.
I ierzenberg also emphasized the
use of FACS for diagnosing and
monitoring progress in patients of
AIDS, the severity of which is
gauged by the patient's level of an
immune cell called the helper T-cell.
"We are working on developing
an inexpensive flow cytometer to be
used in the field, such as in Africa
and poor countries in Asia, to be
used for diagnosis or tracking
progress of HIV treatment, if treat
ment is available." 1 lerzenberg said.
Herzenberg's humanitarian ac
complishments include some closer
to home as well. In May, he recalled,
the visiting Inamori Foundation rep
resentatives spoke at length to him
about a project he and his wife. Ge
netics Prof. Lee Herzenberg, initiat
ed to encourage low-income stu
dents from East Palo Alto to pursue
higher education.
"I learned that the Kyoto Prize
was not just for scientific accom
plishment," he said."There were also
looking for humanitarian accom
plishments and interests."
Herzenberg described the pro
gram for black high school students
from Ravenwood 1 ligh as an enrich
ment and educational experience.
"We brought in someone from
the College Board,some faculty and
some students to talk to them, and
took them out to restaurants, the
theater, movies, around campus and
to labs." he said. "They'd never been
west of the freeway. It was an ab
solutely new experience for them."
Later, the Herzenbergs organ
ized SAT tutoring and college coun
seling for the students. The program
continued for years, during which
time many of the students did in
deed go to college — from a high
school in which only one student had
ever succeeded in doing so. on a bas
ketball scholarship. Herzenberg
later headed a committee for pro
moting diversity in the medical
school.
Speaking from an armchair in his
office, his pet poodle at his side,
Herzenberg still expresses wonder
at the FACS's enduring impact.
"It's remarkable that a high tech
field can be basically the same some
35 years later," he said. "It's like an
airplane: it might have changed
some, but you still have the wings,
the propeller. With the FACS. it's
still the basic idea of getting cells
into droplets that get charged and
then sorted."

"Prior to monoclonal antibodies,
everyone had to make their own an
tibodies in small amounts," Herzen
berg said. "My wife and I felt that it
would be a great boon for everyone
to have the same antibodies as
everyone else. Using this method, we
could distribute the antibodies very
widely as well as make the company
a profit. Using the marketplace was
better than rationing, which hadn't
worked because different scientists
need very different amounts of anti

body depending on the type of re
search they were doing."

number of available color labels has
increased exponentially as re
searchers have isolated more of
these markers from algae and other
sources. Jellyfish genes can be incor

frequently used to sort cells with the

FACS in diverse areas. For e mple,
they have recently used the 1- CS to

cells in cystic fibrosis — research of
which has resulted in Phase 11 trials
for treatment of the disease.
I ierzenberg also emphasized the
use of FACS for diagnosing and
monitoring progress in patients of
AIDS, the severity of which is
gauged by the patient's level of an
immune cell called the helper T-cell.
"We are working on developing
an inexpensive flow cytometer to be
used in the field, such as in Africa
and poor countries in Asia, to be
used for diagnosis or tracking
progress of HIV treatment, if treat
ment is available." 1 lerzenberg said.
Herzenberg's humanitarian ac
complishments include some closer
to home as well. In May, he recalled,
the visiting Inamori Foundation rep
resentatives spoke at length to him
about a project he and his wife. Ge
netics Prof. Lee Herzenberg, initiat
ed to encourage low-income stu
dents from East Palo Alto to pursue
higher education.
"I learned that the Kyoto Prize
was not just for scientific accom
plishment," he said."There were also
looking for humanitarian accom
plishments and interests."
Herzenberg described the pro
gram for black high school students
from Ravenwood 1 ligh as an enrich
ment and educational experience.
"We brought in someone from
the College Board,some faculty and
some students to talk to them, and
took them out to restaurants, the
theater, movies, around campus and
to labs." he said. "They'd never been
west of the freeway. It was an ab
solutely new experience for them."

ized SAT tutoring and college coun
seling for the students. The program
continued for years, during which
time many of the students did in
deed go to college — from a high
school in which only one student had
ever succeeded in doing so. on a bas
ketball scholarship. Herzenberg
later headed a committee for pro
moting diversity in the medical
school.
Speaking from an armchair in his
office, his pet poodle at his side,
Herzenberg still expresses wonder
at the FACS's enduring impact.
"It's remarkable that a high tech
field can be basically the same some
35 years later," he said. "It's like an
airplane: it might have changed
some, but you still have the wings,
the propeller. With the FACS. it's
still the basic idea of getting cells
into droplets that get charged and
then sorted."
Genetics Prof. Len Herzenberg
accepted the Kyoto Prize last month
for his contributions to biotechnolo
gy. including his pivotal role in devel
oping the Fluorescence-Activated
Cell Sorter (FACS) machine that has
transformed both the research and
medicine.
"Yes, it was a surprise," said
1 ler/.enberg. who was visited by rep
resentatives of the Inamori Founda
tion — the body which funds the
Kyoto Prize and oversees naming of
its recipients — last May. The award
was announced a month later.
"I asked them how many candi
dates there were, but they wouldn't
say." recalled I lerzenberg of the May
visit. "It was only later that I learned
there were three candidates for three
prizes!"
The Kvoto Prize was established

in 1 984 by Japanese businessman and
ceramics engineer Kazuo Inamori.
Modeled after the Nobel Prize, the
Kyoto Prize was designed "to honor
people who have made extraordi
nary contributions to science, civi
lization. and spirituality." The In
amori Foundation gives awards an
nually in each of three categories: ad
vanced technology (including
biotechnology, engineering and in
formation science), basic sciences,
and arts and philosophy.
lliough the Kyoto is often com
pared to the Nobel in terms of pres
tige and significance, it should come
as no surprise that Herzenberg,
teaching at Stanford since 1959, is a
laureate. Since its inventions nearly
40 years ago, the FACS has become
übiquitous in research labs and clini
cal settings and played part in every
thing from stem cell research to
leukemia and AIDS diagnosis.
"The FACS has been used pretty
broadly in mouse as well as human
immu n ol ogy,*' H erzenberg sa id." But
the applications have been much
broader than immunology.the FACS
is used in almost all of cell biology
and medicine."

The FACS machine sorts single
cells based on their fluorescent prop
erties: cells can he treated with anti
bodies tagged with a colored fluo
rochrome since the antibodies only
bind to a specific protein of interest.
Inside the machine, cells are sus
pended in a stream surrounded by
sheath fluid, which races past a laser
at a rate of 5,000 to 10.000 cells per
second. The stream breaks into tens
of thousands of drops, which are
charged and then sorted. The laser
detects fluorescence and translates
its readouts to a computer, which
charges the drops, after which
