## Genetics prof, wins Kyoto Prize Herzeberger honored for 1969 invention 
### ADA YEE STAFF WRITER 
Genetics Prof. Len Herzenberg
accepted the Kyoto Prize last month
for his contributions to biotechnolo
gy. including his pivotal role in devel
oping the Fluorescence-Activated
Cell Sorter (FACS) machine that has
transformed both the research and
medicine.
"Yes, it was a surprise," said
1 ler/.enberg. who was visited by rep
resentatives of the Inamori Founda
tion — the body which funds the
Kyoto Prize and oversees naming of
its recipients — last May. The award
was announced a month later.
"I asked them how many candi
dates there were, but they wouldn't
say." recalled I lerzenberg of the May
visit. "It was only later that I learned
there were three candidates for three
prizes!"
The Kvoto Prize was established

in 1 984 by Japanese businessman and
ceramics engineer Kazuo Inamori.
Modeled after the Nobel Prize, the
Kyoto Prize was designed "to honor
people who have made extraordi
nary contributions to science, civi
lization. and spirituality." The In
amori Foundation gives awards an
nually in each of three categories: ad
vanced technology (including
biotechnology, engineering and in
formation science), basic sciences,
and arts and philosophy.
lliough the Kyoto is often com
pared to the Nobel in terms of pres
tige and significance, it should come
as no surprise that Herzenberg,
teaching at Stanford since 1959, is a
laureate. Since its inventions nearly
40 years ago, the FACS has become
übiquitous in research labs and clini
cal settings and played part in every
thing from stem cell research to
leukemia and AIDS diagnosis.
"The FACS has been used pretty
broadly in mouse as well as human
immu n ol ogy,*' H erzenberg sa id." But
the applications have been much
broader than immunology.the FACS
is used in almost all of cell biology
and medicine."

The FACS machine sorts single
cells based on their fluorescent prop
erties: cells can he treated with anti
bodies tagged with a colored fluo
rochrome since the antibodies only
bind to a specific protein of interest.
Inside the machine, cells are sus
pended in a stream surrounded by
sheath fluid, which races past a laser
at a rate of 5,000 to 10.000 cells per
second. The stream breaks into tens
of thousands of drops, which are
charged and then sorted. The laser
detects fluorescence and translates
its readouts to a computer, which
charges the drops, after which
charged plates shuttle cells into the
appropriate bin.
Herzenberg developed the very
first FACS machine in 1969, combin
ing biology with technology devel
oped at Los Alamos National Labo
ratories for sorting small particles —
in particular, fallout from atomic
bomb testing — based on size. Hie
first commercial FACS machine was
released in collaboration with the
company Becton-Dickinson (BD).
