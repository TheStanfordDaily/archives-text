and kicked to sophomore forward
Lawrence Hill on the left elbow.
Passing up an open jump shot. I lill
drove to his right and let loose a 14-
foot floater that splashed through
the twine with 1.1 seconds to go.
Stanford's bench stormed the
court and celebrated, and rightf»
so. The players knew they :
earned the program's most impres
sive — and most dramatic — win
since the Chris I lemandez era. 76-
75 over Virginia.
"We knew throughout the
course of the game Fred was going
to be able to get to the basket," 1 lill
said. "The play before, we did the
same thing, but 1 missed the jump
shot. He yelled at me,' Next time to
go to the basket.' So 1 did."
After freshman center Robin
Lopez's tip-in of Hill's missed
jumper tied the game at 74-74 with
42 seconds left. Virginia guard J.R.
Reynolds (14 points, all in the sec
ond half) came off a screen-and-roll
to draw a soft foul on Washington
with 9.4 seconds to go. After his only
missed free throw in his eight at
tempts on the day. Reynolds hit the
second to set the stage for Washing
ton and Hill.
"When I penetrated the whole
game. Law was open." Washington
said. "His man was sagging off him
and 1 found him for a few jump shots
earlier.That same guy was guarding
Robin and I got him for a few
dunks."
Virginia coach Dave Leitao also
saw the weaknesses in his post de
fense that Hill exploited for the
game-winning score.
"I'm not satisfied where we are
at defensively. For goodness sakes,
it's January. We didn't rotate out of
the double, so Washington drove at
us all day.
"[Gonzaga's Derek] Ravio is
probably the best shooter we've
faced all season and he couldn't get
open looks, but Goods could
tonight. It tells me about the incon
sistency with which we approach de
fense. We never made them feel un
comfortable."
In the earlv second half. Single-

tary and Reynoldsjumpstarted a 10-
2 Cavalier run that put the hosts up
58-55 with just under nine minutes
to go. After a pair of free throws
from sophomore guard Mitch John
son cut Virginia's lead to 65-61 with
seven minutes remaining, neither
team led by more than a single pos
session the rest of the way.
Stanford used a deep lineup, ro
tating through 10 players and
watching seven score, to build a 30-
24 lead in the first half, but the Cav
aliers cut the margin to 33-31 by
halftime.
Twin seven-foot freshmen sensa
tions Brook and Robin Lopez start
ed together for the first time.and the
pair sparked the Cardinal victory
with a combined 27 points on 12-of
-20 shooting. While Brook Lopez
fouled out in just 15 minutes of play,
Robin Lopez made his presence felt
defensively, snaring six rebounds,
blocking two shots and altering
countless others.
"If we're going to be successful,
we're going to have to play those
two together." Stanford coach Trent
Johnson said. "We're going to have
to keep it in the halfcourt, use our
size and play big."
ACC scoring leader Sean Single
tary chipped in 24 points for Virginia
(9-4). and left a lasting impression
on Trent Johnson in the process.
"Our gameplan against him was
to pray," Johnson joked. "I'm not
one to throw praise around, hut he's
as good as it gets."
Johnson pulled an ace out ot his
sleeve, starting sophomore Anthony
Goods (11 points. 3-of-7 three
pointers) at point guard instead of
Mitch Johnson, the team captain
who had started every game this
season at point.
