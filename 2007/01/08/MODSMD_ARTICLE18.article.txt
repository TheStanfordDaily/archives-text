foot floater that splashed through
the twine with 1.1 seconds to go.
Stanford's bench stormed the
court and celebrated, and rightf»
so. The players knew they :
earned the program's most impres
sive — and most dramatic — win
since the Chris I lemandez era. 76-
75 over Virginia.
"We knew throughout the
course of the game Fred was going
to be able to get to the basket," 1 lill
said. "The play before, we did the
same thing, but 1 missed the jump
shot. He yelled at me,' Next time to
go to the basket.' So 1 did."
After freshman center Robin
Lopez's tip-in of Hill's missed
jumper tied the game at 74-74 with
42 seconds left. Virginia guard J.R.

second to set the stage for Washing
ton and Hill.
"When I penetrated the whole
game. Law was open." Washington
said. "His man was sagging off him
and 1 found him for a few jump shots
earlier.That same guy was guarding
Robin and I got him for a few
dunks."
Virginia coach Dave Leitao also
saw the weaknesses in his post de
fense that Hill exploited for the
game-winning score.
"I'm not satisfied where we are
at defensively. For goodness sakes,
it's January. We didn't rotate out of
the double, so Washington drove at
us all day.
"[Gonzaga's Derek] Ravio is
probably the best shooter we've
faced all season and he couldn't get
open looks, but Goods could
tonight. It tells me about the incon
sistency with which we approach de
fense. We never made them feel un
comfortable."
In the earlv second half. Single-

tary and Reynoldsjumpstarted a 10-
2 Cavalier run that put the hosts up
58-55 with just under nine minutes
to go. After a pair of free throws
from sophomore guard Mitch John
son cut Virginia's lead to 65-61 with
seven minutes remaining, neither
team led by more than a single pos

Stanford used a deep lineup, ro
tating through 10 players and
watching seven score, to build a 30-
24 lead in the first half, but the Cav
aliers cut the margin to 33-31 by
halftime.
Twin seven-foot freshmen sensa
tions Brook and Robin Lopez start
ed together for the first time.and the
pair sparked the Cardinal victory
with a combined 27 points on 12-of
-20 shooting. While Brook Lopez
fouled out in just 15 minutes of play,
Robin Lopez made his presence felt
defensively, snaring six rebounds,
blocking two shots and altering
countless others.
"If we're going to be successful,
we're going to have to play those
two together." Stanford coach Trent
Johnson said. "We're going to have
to keep it in the halfcourt, use our
size and play big."
ACC scoring leader Sean Single
tary chipped in 24 points for Virginia
(9-4). and left a lasting impression
on Trent Johnson in the process.
"Our gameplan against him was
to pray," Johnson joked. "I'm not
one to throw praise around, hut he's
as good as it gets."
Johnson pulled an ace out ot his
sleeve, starting sophomore Anthony
Goods (11 points. 3-of-7 three
pointers) at point guard instead of
Mitch Johnson, the team captain
who had started every game this
season at point.

Junior forward Taj Finger slams home a dunk in the Cardinal's 76-75 win over Virginia.
Finger was one of 10 Stanford players to see the court and one of seven that scored in the
contest.
Similarly. down the stretch, Trent
Johnson opted for freshman Landry
Fields, not the offensively-limited
Mitch Johnson (five points, l-of-5
shooting. 17 minutes), as his point
guard opposite Goods.
"Landry could shoot the ball
well," Trent Johnson explained
postgame.' We didn't think we could
stop them, so we just wanted to get as
many shooter.s on the tloor as we
could." '"*•
The move paid off. as all five
starters scored at least 11 points and
the Cardinal scored in all but one of
their final 10 possessions over the
game's final seven minutes.
"I don't honestly know if we can
play any better than we played this
evening."Trent Johnson said. "For us
to have five guys in double figures, it's
a big win for us."
Though the contest hung in the
balance until its last moments, it was
a game of firsts for both teams.
The victory was Stanford's first
over an NCAA Tournament-worthy
opponent, providing a huge boost to
the team's portfolio come March.
For Virginia, the loss was their
first in their new, NBA-caliber, John
Paul Jones Arena. The Cavaliers
were 8-0 in the venue, including a sea
son-opening win over Arizona, and a
108-87 thrashing of Gonzaga in their
previous contest.
"I feel were growing after every
game," Washington said. "I feel like
we picked it up in the second half of
the Cal game and we picked it up
today. It was a tough atmosphere, so
for us to be the first to win here was
huge and for it to be us was even big
ger."
Stanford will need to continue to
grow with Pac-10 power Washington
and upstart Washington State, fresh
off an upset of Arizona, visiting
Maples Pavilion this weekend. The
young Cardinal have struggled at
home, losing ugly to Cal and Santa
Clara in their most recent home con
tests.
"You gotta believe in the law of
averages." Trent Johnson said. "We
haven't shot the ball well, and if you
don't shoot the ball well regardless of
where you are it doesn't matter."

Junior forward Taj Finger slams home a dunk in the Cardinal's 76-75 win over Virginia.
Finger was one of 10 Stanford players to see the court and one of seven that scored in the
contest.
Similarly. down the stretch, Trent
Johnson opted for freshman Landry
Fields, not the offensively-limited
Mitch Johnson (five points, l-of-5
shooting. 17 minutes), as his point
guard opposite Goods.
"Landry could shoot the ball
well," Trent Johnson explained
postgame.' We didn't think we could
stop them, so we just wanted to get as
many shooter.s on the tloor as we
could." '"*•
The move paid off. as all five
starters scored at least 11 points and
the Cardinal scored in all but one of
their final 10 possessions over the
game's final seven minutes.
"I don't honestly know if we can
play any better than we played this
evening."Trent Johnson said. "For us
to have five guys in double figures, it's
a big win for us."
Though the contest hung in the
balance until its last moments, it was
a game of firsts for both teams.
The victory was Stanford's first
over an NCAA Tournament-worthy
opponent, providing a huge boost to
the team's portfolio come March.
For Virginia, the loss was their
first in their new, NBA-caliber, John
Paul Jones Arena. The Cavaliers
were 8-0 in the venue, including a sea
son-opening win over Arizona, and a
108-87 thrashing of Gonzaga in their
previous contest.
"I feel were growing after every
game," Washington said. "I feel like
we picked it up in the second half of
the Cal game and we picked it up
today. It was a tough atmosphere, so
for us to be the first to win here was
huge and for it to be us was even big
ger."
Stanford will need to continue to
grow with Pac-10 power Washington
and upstart Washington State, fresh
off an upset of Arizona, visiting
Maples Pavilion this weekend. The
young Cardinal have struggled at
home, losing ugly to Cal and Santa
Clara in their most recent home con
tests.
"You gotta believe in the law of
averages." Trent Johnson said. "We
haven't shot the ball well, and if you
don't shoot the ball well regardless of
where you are it doesn't matter."

course of the game Fred was going

earlier.That same guy was guarding
Robin and I got him for a few
dunks."
Virginia coach Dave Leitao also
saw the weaknesses in his post de
fense that Hill exploited for the
game-winning score.
"I'm not satisfied where we are
at defensively. For goodness sakes,
it's January. We didn't rotate out of
the double, so Washington drove at
us all day.
"[Gonzaga's Derek] Ravio is
probably the best shooter we've
faced all season and he couldn't get
open looks, but Goods could
tonight. It tells me about the incon
sistency with which we approach de
fense. We never made them feel un
comfortable."

tary and Reynoldsjumpstarted a 10-
2 Cavalier run that put the hosts up

aliers cut the margin to 33-31 by
halftime.
Twin seven-foot freshmen sensa
tions Brook and Robin Lopez start
ed together for the first time.and the
pair sparked the Cardinal victory

-20 shooting. While Brook Lopez
fouled out in just 15 minutes of play,
Robin Lopez made his presence felt
defensively, snaring six rebounds,
blocking two shots and altering
countless others.
"If we're going to be successful,
we're going to have to play those
two together." Stanford coach Trent
Johnson said. "We're going to have
to keep it in the halfcourt, use our
size and play big."
ACC scoring leader Sean Single
tary chipped in 24 points for Virginia
(9-4). and left a lasting impression

as good as it gets."

sleeve, starting sophomore Anthony
Goods (11 points. 3-of-7 three
