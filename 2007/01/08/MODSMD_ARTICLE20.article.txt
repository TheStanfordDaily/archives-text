match for the 12th, both NC A A records.
The Cardinal (30-4) held the Huskies

what helped us play at the level we
did tonight. I thought we were very
composed and we were very aggres
sive tonight."
Hie Huskies took the first point,
hut the Cardinal took back the lead.
Sophomore outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza served-back-to-back aces
to put her team up 14-6. With a 22-12
lead, junior setter Bryn Kehoe
stepped to the service line, where
she stayed until the end of the game,
serving eight straight points includ
ing three aces.
Washington rebounded from the
record-low score in the first game
and stayed with Stanford point-for
point in the second.The Huskies led
at 16-15, but junior middle blocker
Franci Girard notched a kill and
combined with Barboza on a block
to put the Cardinal on top for good.
Barboza closed out the game 30-25
with a solo block.
It was the only game with a posi
tive Washington hitting percentage
and the only time the Huskies broke
double digits in kills-they finished
with 12 at a .135 clip.
The third game started even
more lopsided than the first, and the
Cardinal missed six serves down the
stretch to allow the Huskies to reach
15 points. Stanford started the game
on a 6-1 run and then put together
another run on Kehoe's serve, going
up 14-4.The Cardinal extended their
lead to 24-y. but then traded points
with the Huskies to the 30-15 finish.
"I think coming in we were all on
the same page and wanted a win,"
Akinradewo said after the match."l
think we kept our focus and that's
what helped us put the string of
points together in the beginning.
And from then on we were able to
keep our composure."
Akinradewo finished the match
with a team-high 15 kills on .444 hit
ting. Kehoe served four aces and
Barboza chipped in three to go with
her 10 kills and five blocks. Girard
led the team with six blocks and
sophomore libero Jessica Fishburn
had a team-high 14 digs. Senior out
side hitter Kristin Richards added
13 digs, nine kills and an ace to the
Cardinal's winning efforts. Washing

ton's Christal Morrison and Jessica
Swarbrick tied for the team lead
with six kills apiece.
But in front of a record crowd of
17,209 fans, the vast majority pulling
for Nebraska, the Cardinal came up
short in the championship match,
falling 3-1 to the top-ranked Corn
huskers.
"It was an amazing crowd
tonight, an amazing tournament,"
Dunning said after the match. "This
was probably the biggest match in
women's volleyball history in terms
of scope."
Stanford carried the momentum
of the semifinal into the champi
onship match, taking the first game
30-27. I"he Cornhuskers, who beat a
tenacious UCLA squad in four
games in the semifinals, tied the
match with a 30-26 second game win
buoyed by local fans. The next two
games were close, but Nebraska
eked out narrow victories twice,
winning 30-27 and 30-28 to seal the
championship.
Stanford was firing on all cylin
ders in the first game, offensively
and defensively. The Cardinal
notched 17 kills with only three hit
ting errors and posted seven blocks
in the first frame. After trading
points, Nebraska pulled ahead with
an K-5 lead. Stanford managed to tie
at 11 on a solo block by Akinradewo
and quickly built a four-point lead
of its own. Nebraska led as late as
24-23. but Stanford closed out the
game on a kill by Richards. 30-27.
Nebraska reeled off four points
before Stanford could get on the
board in the second game, but the
Cardinal fought back to tie. Stan
ford led at 24-23, but Nebraska put
together a run to finish on top, 30-
26, just as the Cardinal had in the
first game.
Sophomore opposite Erin Waller
played the best game of a career
match in the third, but the Cardinal
still came up short. Waller notched
two kills in the first three points and
with three consecutive kills closed a
four-point deficit to just one, a 14-13
Nebraska lead. But after a 27-27 tie,
the Cornhuskers turned to AVCA
Player of the Year Sarah Pavan, a 6-

foot-5 opposite, who delivered the
final kill in the 30-28 game.
Fighting to stay in the match, the
Cardinal gave up a 5-2 lead to Ne
braska to start the fourth game, but
regained the lead with a four-point
run. The lead seesawed back and
forth until the Cornhuskers raced
ahead 27-20. The Cardinal were not
ready to admit defeat, however,
scoring seven of the next nine points
before Nebraska clinched the title
with a kill by Jordan Larson.
Pavan led the Cornhuskers with
22 kills and Tracy Stalls had a team
high seven blocks. Libero Dani Bus
boom had 21 digs for Nebraska.
Waller led the Cardinal with a ca
reer-high 18 kills on .394 hitting,
while four other players had dou
ble-digit kills. Akinradewo finished
with 15 kills and a match-high eight
blocks; Richards notched 14 kills to
go with 12 digs: Barboza swatted 12
kills; and Franci Girard had 10 kills
and four blocks. Kehoe dished out
61 assists, served three aces and dug
14 balls, while Fishburn led with 20
digs.
Pavan was named the Most Out
standing Player of the Final Four
and was joined on the All-Tourna
ment list by her teammates Larson,
Stalls and setter Rachel Holloway.
Barboza, Richards and Akinradewo
were also named All-Tournament.
Stanford finished the season with
only four losses — a preseason de
feat at BYU, conference losses to
Washington and USC and the cham
pionship. The four graduating sen
iors — Richards, Nji Nnamani,
Lizzie Suiter and Michelle Mellard
— leave the Farm with one NCAA
title (2004) and three Final Four ap
pearances (2003,2004,2006).
Richards is the all-time digs
leader in Stanford history with 1,597
and is fifth on the career list in kills
(1,819) and aces (126). Suiter's 198
blocks in her sophomore season was
the Cardinal's second-highest sin
gle-season total ever.
Also making the single-season
record books, Barboza notched 48
service aces in 2006, putting her fifth
on the all-time list, and Fishburn
had 430 digs, also good for fifth.

Kehoe's 1,473 assists is the fifth
highest for a single season (she set
the school record with 1,634 as a
freshman in 2004) and she is already
fourth on the career list with a sea
son left to play. Akinradewo's sea
son hitting percentage of .431 is the
best ever by a Stanford hitter and
the second-highest total in the
NCAA this year.
Though the players were crest
fallen after the close loss to Nebras
ka, the Cardinal came away with

memories of yet another record-set
ting season and great achievements
by individuals and the entire team.
"I'm really proud of our team "
Barboza said after the champi
onship. "I thought we had an amaz
ing season and obviously we would
have liked to come out with a win
tonight, but 1 am really proud of
every single member of our team. 1
thought every player stepped up. Wc
had a great comeback in game four.

Franci Girard notched a kill and
combined with Barboza on a block
to put the Cardinal on top for good.
Barboza closed out the game 30-25
with a solo block.
It was the only game with a posi
tive Washington hitting percentage
and the only time the Huskies broke
double digits in kills-they finished
with 12 at a .135 clip.
The third game started even
more lopsided than the first, and the
Cardinal missed six serves down the
stretch to allow the Huskies to reach
15 points. Stanford started the game
on a 6-1 run and then put together
another run on Kehoe's serve, going
up 14-4.The Cardinal extended their
lead to 24-y. but then traded points
with the Huskies to the 30-15 finish.
"I think coming in we were all on
the same page and wanted a win,"
Akinradewo said after the match."l
think we kept our focus and that's
what helped us put the string of
points together in the beginning.
And from then on we were able to
keep our composure."
Akinradewo finished the match
with a team-high 15 kills on .444 hit
ting. Kehoe served four aces and
Barboza chipped in three to go with
her 10 kills and five blocks. Girard
led the team with six blocks and

had a team-high 14 digs. Senior out
side hitter Kristin Richards added
13 digs, nine kills and an ace to the
Cardinal's winning efforts. Washing

ton's Christal Morrison and Jessica
Swarbrick tied for the team lead
with six kills apiece.
But in front of a record crowd of
17,209 fans, the vast majority pulling
for Nebraska, the Cardinal came up
short in the championship match,
falling 3-1 to the top-ranked Corn
huskers.
"It was an amazing crowd
tonight, an amazing tournament,"
Dunning said after the match. "This
was probably the biggest match in
women's volleyball history in terms
of scope."
Stanford carried the momentum
of the semifinal into the champi
onship match, taking the first game
30-27. I"he Cornhuskers, who beat a
tenacious UCLA squad in four
games in the semifinals, tied the
match with a 30-26 second game win
buoyed by local fans. The next two
games were close, but Nebraska
eked out narrow victories twice,
winning 30-27 and 30-28 to seal the
championship.
Stanford was firing on all cylin
ders in the first game, offensively
and defensively. The Cardinal
notched 17 kills with only three hit
ting errors and posted seven blocks
in the first frame. After trading
points, Nebraska pulled ahead with
an K-5 lead. Stanford managed to tie
at 11 on a solo block by Akinradewo
and quickly built a four-point lead
of its own. Nebraska led as late as
24-23. but Stanford closed out the
game on a kill by Richards. 30-27.
Nebraska reeled off four points
before Stanford could get on the
board in the second game, but the
Cardinal fought back to tie. Stan
ford led at 24-23, but Nebraska put
together a run to finish on top, 30-
26, just as the Cardinal had in the
first game.
Sophomore opposite Erin Waller
played the best game of a career
match in the third, but the Cardinal
still came up short. Waller notched
two kills in the first three points and
with three consecutive kills closed a
four-point deficit to just one, a 14-13
Nebraska lead. But after a 27-27 tie,
the Cornhuskers turned to AVCA
Player of the Year Sarah Pavan, a 6-

foot-5 opposite, who delivered the
final kill in the 30-28 game.
Fighting to stay in the match, the
Cardinal gave up a 5-2 lead to Ne
braska to start the fourth game, but
regained the lead with a four-point
run. The lead seesawed back and
forth until the Cornhuskers raced
ahead 27-20. The Cardinal were not
ready to admit defeat, however,
scoring seven of the next nine points
before Nebraska clinched the title
with a kill by Jordan Larson.
Pavan led the Cornhuskers with
22 kills and Tracy Stalls had a team
high seven blocks. Libero Dani Bus
boom had 21 digs for Nebraska.
Waller led the Cardinal with a ca
reer-high 18 kills on .394 hitting,
while four other players had dou

with 15 kills and a match-high eight
blocks; Richards notched 14 kills to
go with 12 digs: Barboza swatted 12
kills; and Franci Girard had 10 kills
and four blocks. Kehoe dished out
61 assists, served three aces and dug
14 balls, while Fishburn led with 20
digs.
Pavan was named the Most Out
standing Player of the Final Four
and was joined on the All-Tourna
ment list by her teammates Larson,
Stalls and setter Rachel Holloway.
Barboza, Richards and Akinradewo
were also named All-Tournament.
Stanford finished the season with
only four losses — a preseason de
feat at BYU, conference losses to
Washington and USC and the cham
pionship. The four graduating sen
iors — Richards, Nji Nnamani,
Lizzie Suiter and Michelle Mellard
— leave the Farm with one NCAA
title (2004) and three Final Four ap
pearances (2003,2004,2006).
Richards is the all-time digs
leader in Stanford history with 1,597
and is fifth on the career list in kills
(1,819) and aces (126). Suiter's 198
blocks in her sophomore season was
the Cardinal's second-highest sin
gle-season total ever.
Also making the single-season
record books, Barboza notched 48
service aces in 2006, putting her fifth
on the all-time list, and Fishburn
had 430 digs, also good for fifth.

Kehoe's 1,473 assists is the fifth
highest for a single season (she set
the school record with 1,634 as a
freshman in 2004) and she is already
fourth on the career list with a sea
son left to play. Akinradewo's sea
son hitting percentage of .431 is the
best ever by a Stanford hitter and
the second-highest total in the
NCAA this year.
Though the players were crest
fallen after the close loss to Nebras
ka, the Cardinal came away with

memories of yet another record-set
ting season and great achievements
by individuals and the entire team.
"I'm really proud of our team "
Barboza said after the champi
onship. "I thought we had an amaz
ing season and obviously we would
have liked to come out with a win
tonight, but 1 am really proud of
every single member of our team. 1
thought every player stepped up. Wc
had a great comeback in game four.
Next season starts now for us."
After trouncing No. 4 Washington to
reach the title match, the No. 2 Stanford
women's volleyball team saw a late rally

(29-5) to record low scores in the semifinal
and won the first game ot the champi
onship final, but the Cornhuskers (33-1)
battled back to win the next three and the
match. It was Nebraska s thud title in
school historv and the first win tor a team
outside the Pacific-10 Conference since
2000. when the lluskers last won the title.
Against conference rival Washington,
the Cardinal came out swinging and al
lowed the Huskies only 12 points in the
first game, a record low tor the Final Four.
The Huskies kept the second game closer,
scoring 25. before struggling to reach 15 in
the third game of the Stanford sweep.
