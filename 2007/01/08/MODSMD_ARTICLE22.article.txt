# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Card winless in season openers 
### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
C oming oft of a 4-24 season, not many people con
sidered the men s volleyball squad as especially dan
gerous or lethal. But. in this weekend's Elephant Bar
lournament at UC-Santa Barbara, the Cardinal
showed they could compete with some of the best
teams in the Mountain Pacific .Sports Federation.
Although they lost all three of their matches at the
season opener, the Cardinal proved to the other
Ml SI teams that they will be a force to be reckoned
with. I hey did lose five contributing seniors to gradu
ation. but they have five talented freshmen coming in
as well.The freshman held tough but Stanford fell 30-
23,30-21,30-23 to UC-Irvine, 30-22, 27-30,22-30,30-

26,15-13 to Long Beach State and 30-28,23-30,23-30.
30-28,15-12 to USC.
"The team will be able to compete with the entire
league in a short while," said head coach John Kosty.
"We need to keep up the intensity and competition for
each starting position. I am really excited about the
season to come."
Stanford, because of their poor season last year,
was ranked last in the tournament of eight teams. Ac
cordingly, their first game was against top-ranked UC-
Irvine, a team that was ranked No. 1 last season for
eight straight weeks and went on a 21 match winning
streak. ITie Anteaters' entire nucleus returned and
they will likely be vying for the MPSF and national
championships.
UC-Irvine won the match last Friday handily with
a score of 30-23,30-21,30-23. 'ITiey were led by senior
opposite Matt Webber who recorded 15 kills with a
.565 hitting percentage, freshmen opposite Cole Rein
holm with 14 kills, last season's American Volleyball
Coaches Association National Player of the Year sen
ior outside hitter Jayson Jablonsky with 14 kills, and
Brian Thornton had 48 assists.
'ITie Cardinal finished with 43 total assists, 27 com
ing from freshmen standout and team leader Kawika
Shoji and 12 from sophomore Miki Groppi. Junior
Matt Ceran, who switched from middle blocker to
outside hitter this season, had 14 kills and freshmen
opposite Evan Romero had 10 kills.
"UCI is just in a league above us at this point in the
season," middle blocker Cameron Chistoffer. a soph
omore, said. "With three starting freshman, we will
have to work to be on their level."
Because of their loss earlier in the day, Stanford
was relegated to the loser's bracket. Their next match
was at later that evening against Long Beach State, a
team reeling from the loss of four year starting setter
Tyler Hildebrand last season. After losing 3-2 to Cal
State-Northridge earlier in the day, the 49ers, just like
the Cardinal, was searching for their first win of the
season.
After losing the first game 30-22 to the 49ers, Stan
ford bounced back with 30-27 and 30-22 game wins.
After losing the fourth game 30-26, the Cardinal
fought valiantly in the fifth game, but came up just
short, losing 15-13.
"We showed that we can compete with some of the
better teams in the country." Christoffers declared.
"Last year. I'm not sure we would have been able to
keep up. But with the additions of Kawika, Garret and
Ceran being moved to outside hitter, we can keep
time."
Long Beach State was led by junior outside hitter
Paul Lotman (17 kills) and sophomore outside hitter
Daniel Fabry (13 kills). Senior middle blocker Teddy
