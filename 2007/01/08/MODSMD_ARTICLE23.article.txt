# Women's wrap: Wiggins helps HOOPS TO 7-0 MARK OVER BREAK
## 
### SCOTT BLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
l"he No. 12 women's basketball
team wrapped up its slate of winter
break games with a perfect 7-0
record after an emphatic 69-44 victo
ry over No. 21 California on Satur
day.
Freshman center Jayne Appel led
the squad in scoring in four of the
seven contests, averaging 13.9 points
per game along with 5.9 rebounds
per game during the stretch.
The Cardinal (11-3,5-0 Pacific-10
Conference) began its winter break
schedule with a 74-47 blowout of vis
iting Utah on Dec. 16. Junior guard
Candice Wiggins came up hobbling
after hitting a buzzer-beating shot to
end the first half, but the team en
dured without her in the next period
as they nearly doubled their lead
from 14 points to 27 by the game's
end. Appel led the team with 15
points and five rebounds.
Stanford then traveled to Los An
geles to begin their Pac-10 schedule.
The Cardinal beat USC" 62-4b in the
first game of the road trip — their
first away win of the year — and de
feated UCLA 68-59 two days later.
Freshman point guard JJ Hones was
one of four double-digit scorers in
each game, hanging 11 points on both
the Trojans and the Bruins from the
outside (3-fo-7 three-point shoot
ing) against the former and the inside
(4-for-5 for two) against the latter.
Senior forward/center Brooke
Smith's 14 points and 12 rebounds
led the team against USC and Jillian
1 larmon scored 14 against UCLA.
'ITie Cardinal returned home the
next week to face Arizona and then-
No. 10 Arizona State at Maples Pavil
ion. Arizona never troubled Stan
ford, losing 86-58. Appel had 15
points and senior center Kristen
Newlin registered a double-double
with 12 points and 11 rebounds.
The Arizona State game was a dif
ferent story, as the Sun Devils led
Stanford by seven points at halftime.
The Cardinal recovered in the next
stanza, shooting 56.3 percent from
the field in the second period, and
emerged as 77-71 victors at the end
of the contest, which featured 13 lead
changes. Wiggins scored 21 points
and Smith finished just short of a
triple-double, with 19 points, 10 re
bounds and seven assists.The victory
was Stanford's first win over a high
er-ranked opponent this season.
The team opened 2007 with a win
at Fresno State.The Cardinal jumped
all over the Bulldogs early, opening
the game with a 16-0 run that iced
Fresno before they could even sink a
shot en route to a 80-52 victory. Jil
lian Harmon had her first double
double of the year (13 points, 10 re
bounds) and Appel led the team with
15 points.
Stanford's capped its break with a
demolition of archrival California.
The Bears never led thanks to the in

side-outside combination of Appel
and Wiggins, who led all scorers with
19 and 18 points, respectively. Wig
gins also finished with eight re
bounds and seven assists.
Wiggins's 18 points against Cali
fornia were all on three-pointers, as
were 15 of her 21 points against Ai i
zona State.
Coach Tara VanDerveer ex
pressed pleasure at her team's im
proved long-range game.
"In the last two weeks of practice
they've really been knocking down
shots," VanDerveer said after the
Utah game, in which Stanford went
7-for-lX from behind the arc; many of
the misses coming in garbage time in
the second half."l'm pleased with the
perimeter shooting."
Pierce said the Cardinal's three

point threat made defense more dif
ficult tor opponents.
"It's definitely a nice change to
the game," Pierce said."[Three-point
shootingj °P cns I, P m 'he post."
However, not everything was
coming lip roses in the shooting de
partment for the Cardinal. Their
free-throw shooting took an alarm
ing dip over the past three weeks,
plummeting from an already-low (v4
percent before the Utah game to an
abysmal .>3.4 percent by the end ot
the game against Cal.
Stanford's next game is a non
conference match-up with South
Carolina tonight at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion. Their Pac-10 schedule re
sumes at the end of the week when
the team heads north to face Wash
ington and Washington State.
