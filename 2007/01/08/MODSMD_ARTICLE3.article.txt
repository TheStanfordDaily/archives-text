## Former Palo Alto High School standout selected to lead football program 
### CHRISTOPHER R. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Promising an era of "attack-oriented style" and embracing
Stanford's unique position in college football Jim Harbaugh was
introduced as Stanford's newest football coach in a high-energy
press conference on Dec. 19.The standing-room-only crowd wit
nessed statements from Director of Athletics Bob Bowlsby and
Harbaugh, followed by a lively question-and-answer session.
The 42-year old coach, who racked up a 29-6 record at the Uni
versity of San Diego, dripped with excitement at the challenge
ahead of him. "It is a pleasure, a privilege, an honor and a bless
ing to accept the opportunity to be Stanford University's next
head football coach." He thanked the players at USD, whose

"love for the game of football" enabled his jump to Stanford, and
pledged to "restore the legacy that Stanford rightfully has in col
lege football.' He closed his statement by saying,"! vow I will at
tack this endeavor with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind."
Making the second major decision ol his tenure after tiring Walt
Harris. Bowlsby calmly and confidently introduced 1 larbaugh as an
"extraordinary fit for our university" and said the process "could
not have turned out more successfully in my opinion." Bowlsby
cited Harbaugh's energy, innovation, vision and excitement and
stated that he "embraces what it is that Stanford stands for."
Harbaugh's experience with Stanford came when his father
Jack was the Cardinal defensive coordinator for the 1980 and
1981 seasons under Paul Wiggin. He played his junior and senior
seasons at Palo Alto High School and had a very successful col
lege career at Michigan, followed by 15 years as a National Foot
ball League quarterback — from 1987-2001. Harbaugh then
served as quarterbacks coach and quality-control assistant for
two years with the Oakland Raiders before being named head
coach at San Diego.
IV \slsb\ praised I larbaugh's ini
ti.»tiw in ins decision to leave the
K iitiers stall in 2004 and take on the
s in Diego program to gain college
Ik id eoaehing experience, "lie un
derstands the college game, and un
derstands the role of academics in the
iv >112 the student athlete." liowlsby
said. " lliere's no place that's more
important than Stanford University"
In tIK end, liowlsby said a key point
• ; the decisions was that "people
,ii uiid him .ire inspired to be a part
t>l what lie's doing, [and] he makes
the people around him better."
When asked about recruiting,
where the Cardinal has struggled
lately Harbaugli said he would hit
the trail hard and seek to make Stan
11>rtl ,i "conduit" to the Ni l. for play
ers Hut he also emphasized commit
ment to the current roster saying,
" I lie liisi group of players we need
hi recruit is our current players...re
cruit them to our vision."
Harbaugli was clear about the
criteria l>>r his assistant coaches —
tinwith "a love and appreciation
I >r Stanford, who really want to be
here for ;i long time." I le set an am
bitious goal to have the best coach
ing stall in the country, saying that
the school's "tremendous" re
s »urces "can definitely attract great
coaches."
Harbaugli said he would meet
with Stanford's previous coaching
stall to begin his search lor assistants,
lie later told a local reporter that
Stanford alumnus David Shaw
would be coming onto the staff. Shaw
is currently listed as the USD wide
receivers coach and passing game co
ordinator. and has coaching experi
ence in the NI L.
1 "he high-pressure search was
conducted in relative secrecy by
liowlsby and his staff, who fired only
cry ptic communiques to local media.
Still. I larbaugh was a name on every
body's lips — a fact liowlsby admit
ted when he stated he'd taken note of
I larbaugh's career while athletic di
rector at lowa.

liowlsby said he spoke with "nine
or 10 coaches" in the last two weeks
regarding the opening,and discussed
it with many people close to him as
well as an on-campus search commit
tee. I lis office also retained the serv
ices of a search firm, supposedly to
perform reference checks and other
clerical affairs.
liowlsby said that the search com
mittee settled on two candidates - the
other is thought to be San Diego
( hargers wide receivers coach James
I ofton, a Stanford alumnus — and
then left the decision with him.
Responding to a question about
I larbaugh's lack of experience at a
I)ivision 1-A school (USD competes
at the I-AA level and offers no foot
ball scholarships), liowlsby said that
"has coached at the highest level in
some ways," citing the deep involve
ment of Ni l. quarterbacks in game
planning and strategizing.
I larbaugh's positives are coun
tered only with question marks
rather than glaring negatives, and he
compares favorably with the coach
ing criteria liowlsby outlined two
weeks ago. Iliat list included head
coaching experience, familiarity with
Stanford and an energetic recruiting
profile.
The only apparent negative is a
DUI charge sustained in late 2005
after running a stop sign. I larbaugh
plead guilty to misdemeanor reck
less driving, paid a fine and attended
a class, liowlsby said he addressed
the incident in the interview and did
not expect it to happen again.
I larbaugh took time in his state
ment to thank the coaching tree that
guided his playing days, including
Larl Hansen (Palo Alto High), the
late lio Schembechler (Michigan),
Mike Ditka (Chicago Bears) and
Mike Riley (San Diego Chargers).
I le also thanked his father Jack and
brother John, both career football
coaches, and brother-in-law Tom
Crean. head basketball coach at
Marquette I Jniversity.
Referrine to his family's lineaae

as coaches, I larbaugh said "I always
knew I would play as long as I could,
then I would coach, then I would
die." which led liowlsby to quip.
"Let's hope there's a lot of distance
in there."
Harbaugli re-emphasized the
players' experience as a key priority
"We are here for the players, thai
they may gel a tremendous educa
tion...and have a great college expc
rience. We'll find out 10-15 years
from now what kind of team, what
kind of program they had when they
come back we find out what kind ol
fathers they are. what kind of people
they are in the community."
Ilie salary and benefits terms of
I larbaugh's contract were not tl is
cussed, and likely will remain confi
dential: unlike public schools. Stan
ford is not compelled to release em
ployee salary information.
Harbaugli will have a lot to cover
in just eight months. In addition to
re-establishing his family in the liay
Area, he must hire a full staff of

coaches. complete the 2007 recruit
ing class. install Ins schemes in spring
practice and prepare for the Sept. 1
opcnei against I ( I A.
11k neu Bradford M. Freeman
I )ircctor ol loot hall showed no signs
of taking things slowly."l'm ready to
get started today.as sc>n as this press
conference is over," he said.
Notes:
I lie last coach to jump from the
I - A A ranks to a tradition-laden I-A
position is Jim Trcssel. who left his
Youngstuun State powerhouse to
become (>hio State's head coach in
2001 'Iressel immediately promised
Buckeye fans that "you will be
proud of our young people; in the
classroom, in the community, and
espccialK in 310 days in Ann Arbor,
Michigan." referring to the upcom
ing season's game at Michigan.
Ohio Slate won the game, 26-23,
and the Buckeyes will play for their
second national title in five years
today.
