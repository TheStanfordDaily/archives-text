## Stanford Challenge off to the races Univ. drums up $36.5 mil in November alone 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford is outpacing Yale and Colum
bia in its record-breaking effort to
fundraise $4.3 billion by 2011. according to
The Daily's analysis of data compiled by
The Chronicle of Higher Education.
University officials have tallied up tens
of millions of dollars since they an

nounced the Stanford Challenge on Oct.
10, including $36.5 million in November,
the last full month for which data is avail
able.
"We had a busy fall quarter and De
cember was another strong month for us."
said Martin Shell, who oversees the Uni
versity's fundraising effort as vice presi
dent for development. "Campaigns like
this are executed in phases. Hie nucleus
phase concluded in October with the pub
lic launch of the campaign."
The University reported having raised
$2,249 billion as of Nov. 30. Early gifts to
the campaign totaled about $2.1 1 ) billion.
Shell and his staff are focused on re

cruiting volunteers who can reach out for
funds and "extending the campaign mes
sage to a much broader audience."
December is typically the busiest
fundraising month of the year for non
profits, as donors look to offset tax gains
with charitable contributions.
"Because of the timing of year-end
gifts, we will continue to process contribu
tions made in December for at least an
other 10 working days," Shell said in an
email late Friday "Therefore, it will be the
end of January before we have a complete
assessment of our calendar year-end gift
activity."
The Stanford Challenge has
seven major initiatives, in areas
ranging from undergraduate educa
tion to the environment and inter
national studies.
"A number of substantial new
commitments from individuals were
made in November." he said, noting
that campaign commitments in No
vember were roughly equally divid
ed between new pledges and new
outright cash gifts. "These covered a
broad range of the campaign
themes."
According to the Chronicle of
Higher Education, 28 American
universities have capital campaigns
trying to raise more than $1 billion
dollars. New York University raised
$60.6 million in November, the most
of any school.
Hurt McMurtry, the chairman of
the University's Board of Trustees,
has called this fundraising drive "the
mort forward and onward-looking
campaign in the University's history."
