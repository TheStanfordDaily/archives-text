etary official told Ihe Daily on Sept. 27 that he
would not take I larvard's top job.
"It is flattering that my name is mentioned in
connection with the Harvard presidency, but 1
have no intention or desire to leave my current
position, which 1 believe is the best position in
higher education." he said at the time.

mittee.

port confirming that Etchemendy was on the
list.

tier academic officials in the United States and
Britain" by the Boston Globe.Three were sen
ior 1 iarvard officials.

lists of this sort." Etchemendy said Saturday.
