### JAMES PRICHARD ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. Betty Ford and her fami
ly stopped at former President Gerald R. Ford's grave
site on the Grand River for a few moments in private
Thursday, a day after a stirring funeral and burial serv
ice.
Each family member touched a stone wall bearing the
epitaph, "Lives Committed to God, Country and Love,"
and the names Gerald and Betty Ford.
A short time later, the grounds of Ford's presidential
museum were opened and dozens of visitors headed to
ward the burial site, which was cordoned off by a
wrought-iron fence.
"Watching Mrs. Ford (at Wednesday's burial service),
it was kind of like she was everybody's mother here yes
terday, or everybody's grandmother or great-grandmoth
er," said Tom Hall, 63, who drove to he museum from
Holland, Mich.
Ford was laid to rest late Wednesday as thousands of
people lined nearby streets and bridges to catch a
glimpse of history. There was a 21-gun salute and a fly
over by 21 F-15E fighter jets, and light applause broke
out as one jet in a missing man formation suddenly flew
straight up as its rear engine glowed.
The former president was also remembered at his

family's longtime church, Grace Episcopal in East Grand
Rapids, as a man not afraid to laugh, make tough deci
sions or listen to the advice of his independent wife.
"You learn a lot about a man when you run against
him for president, and you stand in his shoes and assume
the responsibilities that he has borne so well," Jimmy
Carter, Ford's successor, said during the Wednesday
church service.
"I relished his sound advice," Carter said as his wife,
Rosalynn Carter, cried. "I want to thank my predecessor
for all he did to heal our land."
Betty Ford wiped away tears as she sat with the cou
ple's four children and more than 300 dignitaries and

family friends, including Vice President Dick Cheney
and golfing legend Jack Nicklaus, an honorary pallbear
er.
"He was one of us," said Ford's defense secretary,
Donald Rumsfeld. "And that made him special and need
ed in a dark and dangerous hour for our nation.
Ford, who became president after Richard Nixon re
signed in 1974, died Dec. 26 at his home in Rancho Mi
rage, Calif., at age 93.
He had lived in Grand Rapids as a boy and in the sub
urb of East Grand Rapids during his 25 years as a mem
ber of the U.S. House. He was Michigan's only president
and the only U.S. president who hadn't been elected to ei

ther the job of president or vice president.
Ceremonies were held last week in Southern Califor
nia, near Ford's retirement home. The mourning then
shifted to the nation's capital before his casket was re
turned for an 18-hour viewing Tuesday night and
Wednesday at the museum.
The Navy is considering naming a new aircraft carrier
after Ford, a Navy veteran, Rumsfeld said. At the Penta
gon, officials confirmed the Navy would make an official
announcement "in a few weeks."
"How fitting it would be that the name Gerald R. Ford
will patrol the high seas for decades to come in defense of
the nation he loved so much," Rumsfeld said.
