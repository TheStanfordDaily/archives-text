# Saddam execution ignites uproar
## U.S. military deaths reach grim milestone

BAGHDAD, Iraq [Dec. 31, 2006]
Iraqis awoke Saturday to television im
ages of a noose being slipped over Sad
dam Hussein's neck and his white
shrouded body, the pre-dawn work of
black-hooded hangmen. They went to
bed as new video emerged showing Sad
dam exchanging taunts with onlookers
before the gallows floor dropped away
and the former dictator swung from the
rope.
Saddam was buried shortly before
dawn Sunday inside a compound for re
ligious ceremonies in the center of Ouja,
the town where he was born. Few were
present for the interment, according the
Salahuddin province governor.
In Baghdad's Shiite neighborhood of
Sadr City, victims of his three decades of
autocratic rule took to the streets Satur
day to celebrate, dancing, beating drums
and hanging Saddam in effigy. Celebra
tory gunfire erupted across other Shiite
neighborhoods in Baghdad and other
predominantly Shiite regions of the
country.
There was no sign of a feared Sunni
uprising in retaliation for the execution,
and the bloodshed from civil warfare
was not far off the daily average 92
from bombings and death squads.
Outside the Sunni insurgent strong
hold of Ramadi, west of the capital, loy
alists marched with Saddam pictures
and waved Iraqi flags. Defying curfews,
hundreds took to the streets vowing re
venge in Samarra, north of Baghdad,
and gunmen paraded and fired into the
air in support of Saddam in Tikrit, his
hometown.
Still, authorities imposed curfews
sparingly in contrast to the several-day
lockdown put in place after Saddam was
sentenced to death Nov. 5.
By several accounts, Saddam was
calm but scornful of his captors, engag
ing in a give-and-take with the crowd
gathered to watch him die and insisting
he was Iraq's savior, not its tyrant and

scourge.
"He said we are going to heaven and
our enemies will rot in hell and he also
called for forgiveness and love among
Iraqis but also stressed that the Iraqis
should fight the Americans and the Per
sians," Munir Haddad, an appeals court
judge who witnessed the hanging, told
the British Broadcasting Corp.
Another witness, national security
adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie, told The
New York Times that one of the guards
shouted at Saddam: "You have de
stroyed us. You have killed us. You have
made us live in destitution."
"I have saved you from destitution
and misery and destroyed your enemies,
the Persian and Americans," Saddam re
sponded, al-Rubaie told the Times.
"God damn you," the guard said.
"God damn you," responded Sad
dam.
New video, first broadcast by Al-
Jazeera satellite television early Sunday,
had sound of someone in the group
praising the founder of the Shiite Dawa
Party, who was executed in 1980 along
with his sister by Saddam.
Saddam appeared to smile at those
taunting him from below the gallows. He
said they were not showing manhood.
Then Saddam began reciting the
"Shahada," a Muslim prayer that says
there is no god but God and Muhammad
is his messenger, according to an
unabridged copy of the same tape, ap
parently shot with a camera phone and
posted on a Web site.
Saddam made it to midway through
his second recitation of the verse. His
last word was Muhammad.
The floor dropped out of the gallows.
"The tyrant has fallen," someone in
the group of onlookers shouted. The
video showed a close-up of Saddam's
face as he swung from the rope.
Then came another voice: "Let him
swing for three minutes."
The responses within Iraq to Sad
dam's death echoed the larger reaction
across the Middle East, with his enemies
rejoicing and his defenders proclaiming
him a martyr. While Iranians and
Kuwaitis welcomed the death of the
leader who led wars against each of their
countries, Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad said the execution pre
vented exposure of the secrets and

crimes the former dictator committed
during his brutal rule.
Some Arab governments denounced
the timing of the 69-year-old former
president's hanging just before the start
of the most important holiday of the Is
lamic calendar, Eid al-Adha. Libya an
nounced a three-day official mourning
period and canceled all celebrations for
Eid.
Within Iraq and across the world, the
airwaves were alive with pictures of Sad
dam in death, a bruise on his cheek, his
neck elongated and twisted impossibly
to the right grisly proof that the man
who had tormented and killed so many
during a bloody quarter-century rule
was truly dead.
But some Iraqis like 34-year-old

Haider Hamed, a candy store owner in
east Baghdad wondered what would
really change with the execution of Sad
dam, who was just four months shy of his
70th birthday.
"He's gone, but our problems contin
ue," said the Shiite Muslim, whose uncle
was killed in one of Saddam's many bru
tal purges. "We brought problems on
ourselves after Saddam because we
began fighting Shiite on Sunni and Sunni
on Shiite."
At least 80 Iraqis died in bombings
and other attacks Saturday, and police
said 12 more tortured bodies were found
dumped in Baghdad. The U.S. military
announced six more service members
three soldiers and three Marines
were killed.

vented exposure of the secrets and

crimes the former dictator committed
during his brutal rule.
Some Arab governments denounced
the timing of the 69-year-old former
president's hanging just before the start
of the most important holiday of the Is
lamic calendar, Eid al-Adha. Libya an
nounced a three-day official mourning
period and canceled all celebrations for
Eid.
Within Iraq and across the world, the
airwaves were alive with pictures of Sad
dam in death, a bruise on his cheek, his
neck elongated and twisted impossibly
to the right grisly proof that the man
who had tormented and killed so many
during a bloody quarter-century rule
was truly dead.
But some Iraqis like 34-year-old

Haider Hamed, a candy store owner in
east Baghdad wondered what would
really change with the execution of Sad
dam, who was just four months shy of his
70th birthday.
"He's gone, but our problems contin
ue," said the Shiite Muslim, whose uncle
was killed in one of Saddam's many bru
tal purges. "We brought problems on
ourselves after Saddam because we
began fighting Shiite on Sunni and Sunni
on Shiite."
At least 80 Iraqis died in bombings
and other attacks Saturday, and police
said 12 more tortured bodies were found
dumped in Baghdad. The U.S. military
announced six more service members
three soldiers and three Marines
were killed.
