The Program in Feminist Studies
Join us in exploring gender, race, LGBT issues and more.
Consider these Winter courses:
Introduction to Queer Studies*
FEMST 120: Daniel Rivers
This course will offer an introduction to the central issues and debates in lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender and queer studies. Using historical and contemporary readings,
film screenings and class discussions, we will challenge ourselves to complicate our B
understandings of seemingly natural ideas such as sex/gender, man/woman, or homo
sexual/heterosexual as we experience them in our own daily lives and perceive them in
fthe world around us. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we will explore the history,
critical theory, cultural production and politics ot queer life in the United States. We S
will pay particular attention to how ideas ot gender and sexuality intersect with social
understandings of race, class and citizenship. 4-5 units.
