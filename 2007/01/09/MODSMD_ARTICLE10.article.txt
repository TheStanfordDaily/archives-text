## Arnold proposes new health care plan 
### LAURA KURTZMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SACRAMENTO - Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger on Monday laid out a
sweeping proposal to extend health coverage
to California's 6.5 million uninsured resi
dents. promising to share the cost among
businesses, individuals, hospitals, doctors, in
surers and government.
All Californians will be required to have
insurance, and -ill but the smallest businesses
will have to offer it to their workers. Insurers
will no longer be allowed to deny coverage to
people because of their medical problems.
All children, regardless of their immigra
tion status, will be covered through an expan
sion of the state and federal I lealthy Families
program.
"M\ solution is that everyone in Califor
nia must have health insurance,"
Schwarzenegger said.speaking via video link
from his office in Santa Monica. "If you can't
afford it.the state will help you buy it. Hut
you must be insured.That is number one."
I"he governor, who is recuperating from a
broken femur, was supposed to give his ad
dress in person to a panel of health care stake
holders. Hut he said his doctor would not allow
him to fly to Sacramento for the occasion.
Main applauded the breadth and ambi
tion of the governor's plan, which a special
team of advisers spent si x months developing
in secret.
Insurers, seeing the possibility of 4 million
to 5 million new customers, praised the pro
posal.despite the new restrictions it places on
them, such as limiting administrative costs.
"'Hie governor's plan is bold, comprehen
sive and visionary." said Hruce Bodaken.
chairman of Blue Cross of California. "Tak
ing each part separately, there's something
for everyone to hate. Hut taken as a whole,
there's a lot to like."
Hut employers and doctors said they were
being taxed to fund it. while unions protested

that low-income workers would bear the
brunt of the costs because they will be forced
to buy insurance.
"For us. this is a tax on the middle class,"
said Angie Wei,a lobbyist with the California
Federation of Labor. "This is all going to be
on the backs of the individual, the workers."
Under Schwarzenegger's plan.all Califor
nians must have insurance, although the
poorest will be subsidized. Those who go un
covered will be subject to tax penalties.
Businesses with 10 or more employees
will have to offer insurance to their workers
or pay 4 percent of their payroll into a state
fund. Smaller firms, which the governor's of
fice said make up SO percent of California
businesses, will be exempt.
The state will subsidize the estimated 1.2
million low-income people who do not cur
rently qualify for coverage under Medi-Cal.
They would be able to buy insurance through
a state-run pool and will have to make a small
contribution toward their premiums.
Kim Belshe, Schwarzenegger's health sec
retary. said an additional $10 billion to $15
billion will go to health care providers under
Schwarzenegger's plan. The state will in
crease Medi-Cal reimbursement rates to
help doctors and hospitals. But in turn they
will have to pay into the new system.
Hospitals will be assessed 4 percent of
their revenues, while doctors will pay 2 per
cent.
Belshe said the requirement that every
one have insurance was key to the plan's suc
cess.
"We must come together to create a more
functional health care system that provides
care for everyone." she said.
But some questioned whether the plan's
financing would work, since nearly half the
$12 billion cost is supposed to come from the
federal government.
"I'm very skeptical of that," said Jeffrey
Miles, of the California Association of
Health Underwriters. "That might be overly

optimistic."
Schwarzenegger wants to expand Medi-
Cal to cover poor adults. Medi-Cal and
I lealthv Families also would be expanded to
cover all children in families earning less
than $60,000.
Reacting to the governor's announce
ment, several said it went even further than
Massachusetts, which last year became the
first state to require everyone to have health
insurance.
"This plan one-ups Massachusetts," said
Peter 1 larbage, a health care consultant with
the New America Foundation. "The gover
nor has gone further and added doctors, hos
pitals and health plans" to those who must
help pay.
Schwarzenegger's decision to include an
employer mandate is a blow to his business
allies, who waged an expensive fight against a
similar requirement just three years ago _
with the governor's help. Republicans react
ed negatively.
"Imposing a new jobs tax on employers of

any size and expanding costly government
mandates is the wrong approach, one which
will devastate our economy," Assembly Re
publican leader Mike Villines said in a state
ment.
Allan Zaremberg, president of the Cali
fornia Chamber of Commerce, said the gov
ernor was taxing businesses, doctors, hospi
tals and insurers to fund his plan. He ques
tioned whether the skyrocketing cost of
health care would mean that businesses
would be asked to pay even more in the fu
ture. as premiums continued to rise.
"The biggest fear that we all face is that
people who are satisfied with the system,
who can afford the system, will suffer in
creased costs." said Zaremberg, one of the
governor's key allies.
One business leader, Safeway chief execu
tive Steve Burd.said the governor was on the
right track. But he said businesses that do not
offer health insurance should be charged
more than 4 percent of their payrolls.
If it is cheaper for businesses to pay the

fee than to insure their workers, businesses
will have an incentive to drop coverage and
let their employees join the state pool. And,
if health insurance premiums continue to rise
as they have for decades, the state will have to
pay more money each year to maintain cov
erage for those it is subsidizing.
The governor believes he can lower med
ical costs by encouraging healthy lifestyles.
Democrats said they were open to the
governor's ideas. But Assembly Speaker
Fabian Nunez. D-Los Angeles, said if all
workers are required to buy insurance, insur
ers will raise their prices, "and ultimately
make health care less affordable."
Nunez and Senate President Don Perata,
D-Oakland. have put forth their own health
reform ideas. 'ITiey and the governor now
begin what may be a long process of trying to
achieve a compromise.
Republicans, who are in the minority, may
have less of a say in whatever plan emerges,
unless it involves raising taxes, which re
quires a two-thirds majority.
