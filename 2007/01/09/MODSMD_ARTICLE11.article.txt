## U.S. strikes al-Qaida targets in Somalia 
### THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHING TON - The U.S. military launched a
strike against several suspected members of al-
Qaida in Somalia, a government official said Mon
day night.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymi
ty because of the operation's sensitivity, said at least
one AC-130 gunship was used in the attack.
CNN. NBC and CBS first reported the military
action. Citing Pentagon officials, CBS said the tar
gets included the senior al-Qaida leader in East
Africa and an al-Qaida operative wanted for his in
volvement in the 1998 bombings of the American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
Ihe same operatives are also believed responsi
ble for a 2002 attack on Israeli tourists in Kenya and

an attempt to shoot down an Israeli aircraft the
same day, NBC News reported.
The 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania killed more than 250 people.
Ihe 2002 attack on an Israeli-owned hotel in Kenya
killed 15.
The White House on Monday night would not
confirm the incident. Air Force Lt. Col.Todd Vician,
a Defense Department spokesman, said he could
neither confirm nor deny the reports of an airstrike.
There was no confirmation that the Air Force
had killed either of the al-Qaida targets.
Air Force AC-130 gunships are heavily armed
aircraft with elaborate sensors that can go after dis
creet targets — day or night. They are operated by
the Special Operations Command and have been
used heavily against the Taliban in Afghanistan.

U.S. Navy vessels have been deployed off the
coast of Somalia to make sure al-Qaida or allied ji
hadists don't escape the country, the State Depart
ment said last Wednesday
Somalia's effective central government fell in
1991, when clan based warlords overthrew a mili
tary dictator and then turned on each other. The
government was formed two years ago with the
help of the United Nations, but has been weakened
by internal rifts.
Soldiers loyal to Somalia's U.N.-backed govern
ment and Ethiopia's military late last month drove
out a radical Islamic group that had been in control
of the country for six months.
Ihe U.S. has believed for years that a group of al-
Qaida operatives has been hiding in Somalia.
