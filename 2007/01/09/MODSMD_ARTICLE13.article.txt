## Editorial Board Mastering public policy? 
### 
One of the most important curricular
developments at Stanford this year
was the Committee on Graduate
Studies' approval of a new master's pro
gram in public policy, offering both a two
year Master of Public Policy (MPP) and a
one-year Master of Arts in Public Policy
(MAPP).The proposal, led by Bruce Owen,
director of the public policy program, is still
pending approval from the Faculty Senate.
Owen has decided to develop the pro
gram using existing faculty members. Be
cause the entire faculty — which includes
such recognized names as David Victor
(Law).Debra Satz(Philosophy) and Robert
Reich (Political Science) — are already
members of other Stanford departments,
the program could be established quickly.
But using existing faculty rather than re
cruiting a group of professors primarily for
the new public policy program raises issues
that may only become apparent in the fu
ture. Stanford's decision contrasts with 1 lar
vard's Kennedy School of Government and
Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, the
top two public policy programs in the coun
try. which are separate schools with their
own faculty.
In an email to The Daily. Owen pointed
out that "it would take at least several years
to assemble such a faculty as part of the es
tablishment of a new school. Further, facul
ty of any given caliber will be more difficult
to attract to a new school than to estab
lished. highly-ranked Stanford depart
ments." While this is a valid concern, it is un
clear whether this approach is sustainable in
the long term, and the new master's pro
gram should make long-term plans toward
hiring new faculty members specifically for

public policy.
There are indelible benefits to creating a
separate department, if not a separate
school, for the MPP program. It will allow
faculty to specialize and focus on their main
areas of research rather than having simul
taneous obligations to several different de
partments. as well as lowering the level of
bureaucracy involved. A new department or
school should be created now and use exist
ing professors until new ones are hired for
the MPP program.
Stanford's heightened interest in "inter
disciplinary" research is commendable, but
it should not come at the expense of estab
lishing solid and prestigious individual de
partments. It seems unlikely that Stanford
will be able to create a program that com
petes on the same level as the Kennedy and
Woodrow Wilson schools without having a
number of faculty members hired specifi
cally for that purpose — faculty members
who specialize in teaching public policy at a
graduate level.
Further, Owen argued that if there was a
need for more professors, "they could also
be hired by the existing departments and
schools on the understanding that some or
all of their teaching would be done in the
policy program." However, many public
policy faculty members at other schools
have retired from jobs in Washington. D.C..
and could not be hired as more theoretical
political science or economics professors.
Stanford needs to recognize, as Harvard,
Princeton and others have, that public poli
cy is an academic field separate from other
fields like political science and economics
and should treat the new graduate program
accordingly.
