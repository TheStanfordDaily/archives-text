# Almost, almost cool
## 
### 
It's futile to try and he cool. If you have to
try, well, you're never going to get any
where. And vet... 1 can't help myself.
I was in Las Vegas over Christmas. Obvi
ously, since normal people go home to their
families. Vegas was full of degenerate gam
blers and theoretical physicists.
Whilst in the City of Sin. I was trying my
best to fake it as a high-roller. This mostly
involved wearing my ever-so-slightly
stained beige suit and drinking the cheapest
sparkling wine on the menu.
The apex (or nadir, depending on your
point of view) of my attempts at smoothness
was the Coyote Ugly night. Here I spent at
least five minutes demonstrating my lack of
grace to the dancing girls and. despite my
failure to lay on any player moves. I'm still
going to be telling the "Nav talked to hot
dancing girls" story until the day I die.
In some way this attempted grasp at
glimmers of sociability is indicative of a gen
eral trend. I want to escape the trappings of
myself, and be gazed upon with envy by all
those around me.
In the face of terrifying odds (and. really.
1 do mean terrifying, just thinking about
them gives me the willies), each and every
day I persist in my quest to appear a little
cooler than you.
To understand why the chances of suc
cess are so slim, one only needs to glance
over the following list of words: Grad
school. Physics. Fantasy novels.
Sensible people like the things they like.
You know, stamp collectors like stamps,
sports fans like sports, that sort of thing. Peo
ple like me,though,we hate the things we like.
I am filled with self-loathing as I contem
plate my affection for dragon-slaying out
cast warriors who hold the mystical key that
will unite the realms that were riven asun
der in the time of the Great Storm. But I
can't stop myself: Just thinking about the

dragons makes me all tingly...
Anyway. My reason for despising myself
is not so much the things 1 do. but rather the
image they give me — 1 desperately want
people to think I'm with the "In Crowd."
There are two ways to create the illusion
of social desirability, both doomed to fail
ure. Hie first is unrepentant arrogance and
self-assurance, especially in the face of in
creasingly diminishing justification.
The problem with such an aggressive tac
tic is that everyone eventually realizes that
you have no clothes, and the edifice of
trendiness collapses.
Since ego doesn't do it. imitation is the
other tactic of choice. Copy other cool kids,
and you are bound to join their ranks. No?
No.
It never succeeds. And I should know:
I've been trying for years.
I've worked on the way 1 dress (no high
waistbands. no short trousers). I've cultivat
ed alcohol and nicotine dependences and
I've even (against my better judgment)
talked to girls.
Despite all this effort, though, my natural
awkwardness always wins out — at some
crucial moment I'll revert back to the badly
dressed. virtuous boy in the corner.
Actually, as I've grown older, I've at
tempted new strategies as part of my des
perate bid to be envied. Rather than chase

after social glory through excessive
partying, now I'm trying refine
ment.
The plan was that as 1 pretended to
know increasing amounts about food,
wine, opera and 18th century Dutch
art. I would slowly become a more de
sirable catch. Needless to say this self-
Pygmalianation is not working.
Oddly, people don't find opera to
be that, hmmm.cool. And lNth cen
tury Dutch art doesn't have quite
the same draw as. say, something in
teresting.
It would be nice to be satisfied
with one's lot in life. To embrace the
things that we like without prejudice
and, more importantly, without long

ing to he more. But I can't help it.
No matter how well things go,
nothing ever makes me feel quite as
good as other people thinking I'm
better than them.
1 suppose this is true in all aspects
of my life, but accruing social capital
is particularly potent. Mostly, this is
because of its universality. Should a
miracle occur and I produce some
worthy physics, about eight people
will care. On the other hand, every
body loves the "cool."
Collectively, we worship celebri
ty, not because of what they do or
who they are. but rather because
everyone else worships them.
And what is there to life but wor

Merry New Year and all that. You
probably have nothing to say to me —
