## Long live the Band 
### THE MORTAL TWELVE 
As a group of LSJIJMB alums
who have left the Farm for other, if
not greener, pastures, we were
shocked to find out that the Band
would be prohibited from perform
ing even a halftime show at Cal,until
we found that a suspension had been
in place since the summer that pre
vented the Band from performing a
single field show throughout the 2(X)(>
season. Evidently, the Stanford ad
ministration saw fit to remove one of
the few things that might have made
this football season watchable, and
instead punish the Band for the sins
of their fathers.
A brief history of the current
Band's situation, from an admittedly

biased source: For years, the Stanford
administration recognized that the
LSJUMB was an integral part of
campus life, an embodiment of the
laissez-faire, treat-the-students-like
adults atmosphere that made so
many of its applicants choose Stan
ford over the humorless I larvards,
Yales and Princetons of the world.
They tolerated the Band's lovable
eccentricity, knowing that it came
with a price: the occasional incident
with a field show deemed offensive
by hypocritical Notre Dame fans, or
a mellophone's intoxication at a bas
ketball game or a freshman's
sprained ankle on the fall Band Run.
This was the price of having some
thing that differentiated Stanford
from the Ivies of the world, and the

administration paid that price with
the appropriate slap on the wrist for
what in the grand scheme of things
were relatively innocuous, victimless
crimes. And then something hap
pened to the Stanford Administra
tion.
ITiev got scared of losing their
jobs, and of getting sued. In the late
90s, a wave of Risk Management
Specialists began overtaking higher
education in America, coinciding
with (or perhaps resulting from) a
wave of tragic student deaths from
alcohol. And in an ironic response to
these tragic deaths from massive, ir
responsible overindulgence in alco
hol. the Stanford administration re-
sponded with their own massive, ir
responsible overindulgence in
shameless strategies to save their
own jobs.
Do not misunderstand; any college
student's death — particularly one
from something as unnecessary as
binge drinking — is tragic, and steps
must be taken to prevent that kind of
tragedy. But no less tragic is robbing a
revered institution like Stanford of its
very essence, and in their shameless,
ham-fisted scramble to avoid an un
likely but potentially career-wrecking
incident on their watch, the Stanford
bureaucrats grasped for the most il
logical of straws.
The Stanford Band.
Suddenly, those slaps on the wrist
became onerous. Suddenly, every
drunken freshman was one too
many, every mildly offensive field
show was "significantly over the
line," every slight infraction was "the
last straw." Suddenly, the Band was

public enemy number one.
And the administration struck.
Hell hath no fury like a bureaucrat
fearing for her next paycheck. They
pounced on the Band like a Panzer
division, and they have taken no pris
oners. neutering the Band in every
conceivable way.They have imposed
conditions of non-assembly on the
Band that border on unconstitution
ality, they have restricted its per
formance schedule in a manner that
can only be described as maliciously
punitive, they have imposed sanc
tions historically reserved only for
fraternities that were either $5().()()()
behind in rent to the University or
whose president had swan-dove off a
back patio? They have even forbid
den alumni, a critical part of the
Band atmosphere, from performing
with the Band.
The only way we can describe the
administration's treatment of the
Band is Karl Roveian; as loathsome
and repugnant as we find their goals,
we can only gawk at and respect the
single-minded ruthlessness with
which they pursue them. Ilie\ have
put the Stanford community on no
tice that the Band in its current form

will be destroyed by any means avail
able and over any time frame, like try
ing to breed the Scots out of Scotland.
Incidentally, has it worked?
Absolutely. Perhaps one cannot
blame recent Band management,
desperate to preserve what re
mained of the Band they inherited,
for making Faustian bargains. Unfor
tunately, they have been overrun by
an administration holding all the
cards and hell-bent on exploiting
each new minor transgression for the
purposes of furthering the Band's
annihilation. As a result, what re
mains is a neutered, hamstrung or
ganization with a falling member
ship and unclear identity that bears
no resemblance to the Band of just
five or 10 years ago.
When we were at Stanford some
years ago. we used to joke that the
Band was Stanford's cockroach; in
the nuclear winter, there would still
be a few drunk trumpets bleating out
"All Right Now." We joked about it.
but we really believed that. 1 lowever,
the last five years have put that belief
to the test. Stanford's administration
has declared unabashed, unholy, un
restricted war upon the Band, and by
all accounts, they have won. For now.
So we say "Good Luck" to you,
Stanford Administration. And we
mean it. for you will need it. At the
end of the day, we take solace in one
irrefutable truth: We will be Stanford
alumni writing checks long after you
cease to be a Stanford bureaucrat
cashing them. We're younger and
we're angrier, and WE WILL OUT
LAST YOU.
The Band is dead. Long live the
Band.

put the Stanford community on no
tice that the Band in its current form

will be destroyed by any means avail
able and over any time frame, like try
ing to breed the Scots out of Scotland.
Incidentally, has it worked?
Absolutely. Perhaps one cannot
blame recent Band management,
desperate to preserve what re
mained of the Band they inherited,
for making Faustian bargains. Unfor
tunately, they have been overrun by
an administration holding all the
cards and hell-bent on exploiting
each new minor transgression for the
purposes of furthering the Band's
annihilation. As a result, what re
mains is a neutered, hamstrung or
ganization with a falling member
ship and unclear identity that bears
no resemblance to the Band of just
five or 10 years ago.
When we were at Stanford some
years ago. we used to joke that the
Band was Stanford's cockroach; in
the nuclear winter, there would still
be a few drunk trumpets bleating out
"All Right Now." We joked about it.
but we really believed that. 1 lowever,
the last five years have put that belief
to the test. Stanford's administration
has declared unabashed, unholy, un
restricted war upon the Band, and by
all accounts, they have won. For now.
So we say "Good Luck" to you,
Stanford Administration. And we
mean it. for you will need it. At the
end of the day, we take solace in one
irrefutable truth: We will be Stanford
alumni writing checks long after you
cease to be a Stanford bureaucrat
cashing them. We're younger and
we're angrier, and WE WILL OUT
LAST YOU.
The Band is dead. Long live the
Band.
