## Long live the Band 
### THE MORTAL TWELVE 
As a group of LSJIJMB alums
who have left the Farm for other, if
not greener, pastures, we were
shocked to find out that the Band
would be prohibited from perform
ing even a halftime show at Cal,until
we found that a suspension had been
in place since the summer that pre
vented the Band from performing a
single field show throughout the 2(X)(>
season. Evidently, the Stanford ad
ministration saw fit to remove one of
the few things that might have made
this football season watchable, and
instead punish the Band for the sins

many of its applicants choose Stan
ford over the humorless I larvards,
Yales and Princetons of the world.
They tolerated the Band's lovable
eccentricity, knowing that it came
with a price: the occasional incident
with a field show deemed offensive
by hypocritical Notre Dame fans, or
a mellophone's intoxication at a bas
ketball game or a freshman's
sprained ankle on the fall Band Run.
This was the price of having some
thing that differentiated Stanford
from the Ivies of the world, and the

administration paid that price with
the appropriate slap on the wrist for
what in the grand scheme of things
were relatively innocuous, victimless
crimes. And then something hap
pened to the Stanford Administra
tion.
ITiev got scared of losing their
jobs, and of getting sued. In the late
90s, a wave of Risk Management
Specialists began overtaking higher
education in America, coinciding
with (or perhaps resulting from) a
wave of tragic student deaths from
alcohol. And in an ironic response to
these tragic deaths from massive, ir
responsible overindulgence in alco
