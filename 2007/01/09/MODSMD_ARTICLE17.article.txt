# Good night, sweet Coach

### 
By the time Walt Harris left Stanford,
he had suffered through all the tor
ments of every level of hell. He lost
Mark Bradford. Nick Frank and the long
suffering Trent Edwards to injury. The
stands were emptier than ever. Back in Sep
tember. he bragged that the team's motto
was:"They Said It Couldn't Be Done."They
were right. Eleven losses later, fan sentiment
was at a nihilistic low — most students,gone
sadistic from hopelessness, were pulling for a
"perfect season" of 12 losses. Then we beat
Washington. Walt couldn't even lose right.
It wasn't supposed to be like this. Two
years ago. Buddy Teevens finished off his
three-year coaching stint quagmired in medi
ocrity. Teevens was a lovely fella, well-liked
by the players. I le was a nice guy,perhaps too
nice. His door was always open. His name
was Buddy. But football coaches should be
respected, and feared. Buddy lacked the
killer instinct.
So. Walt Harris. Cynics hooted that, like
Teevens before him. Walt was a close friend
and butt-buddy of then-Athletic Director
led Leland. But Harris rescued Pitt's foot
ball program, going to six bowl games and
making them a serious Big East competitor.
I le was going to Change Shit Up. I le had the
team run crack-of-dawn suicide jogs in the
winter. 1 le had a terse style, a take-no-prison
ers attitude. No more Buddy Ball. No more
stammering O-Line. No more running up the
middle.Trent Edwards shall not be knocked
out twice before halftime. We will make the
Vegas Bowl. We will make it through fourth
quarter. We will make a first down. Hope,
which has gone out of fashion this decade,
was high.
Walt's first season was not really disas
trous, just typically mediocre. You would ex
pect no more from a coach in his first season,
unless you were a Stanford fan, in which case
you were calling for Walt's head on a platter.

contemplating yet another year without a
Bowl Game or a winning record. Stanford
fans want a quick fix — even if we don't par
ticularly like football.it seems natural that, as
long as we have a football team, it should be
the best in the country. We wanted Walt to
build us an empire, to find us another Elway,
to give the Axe Committee a reason for
breathing. He was doomed.
It wasn't all his fault. Walt was thrust into
catastrophic times and had very little to work
with. Some of his older players were recruit
ed by Tyrone Willingham eons ago; the
younger guys.Teevens' boys, were lost in the
inevitable shuffle of new coaches, new assis
tants and new players to develop. Because
Stanford has academic standards, it will al
ways be difficult to compete in the Pac-10 —
our players need good SAT scores, whereas
USC only requires basic motor skills and an
interest in sociology.
Walt valiantly struggled against these
problems, and quietly, proudly failed. He
could have just been an unlucky sap, doing
his best and failing amicably — the sort of
husband you remain good friends with after
your adulterous affair precipitates a divorce
— except that we gave him our confidence,
our faith and a million new Stadium, a
shiny new castle for King Walt the First.
That accursed stadium was the big selling
point of this season. Pep rallies cheered the
ludicrous feats of engineering that got it built
in just one year. From his throne room up

high in the heavens over Redwood City. Lord
Arrillaga blessed us, his children, with garlic
fries, comfortable stadium seats and extra
rest rooms. The stage was set for the greatest
season of Stanford football yet.
1 happened to attend a kickoff barbecue
before school started, the sort of event where
they make football players sit next to alumni
old and rich enough to have great-grandchil
dren at the Law School. It was hard for any
one to be optimistic, but it was the start of a
new year, wine was prevalent and there are
no atheists in foxholes.
Standing in front of the players who de
pended on him and the donors who were
kind enough to let him dig his own grave,
Walt was painfully nondescript. His sen
tences constantly trailed off, as if even simple
rah-rah pre-season platitudes weighed heavy
on his beleaguered shoulders. "We think
we're tougher than a lot of people are giving
us credit for," he said, which is not quite as re
assuring as, "We're going to ram Berkeley's
head through their collective asshole and
castrate them with butter knives," but there
were ladies present, after all.
The MC lobbed Harris softball questions
— "Do you teach the players speed?" — and
he swung back with tepid answers — "We're
trying to teach our guys to accelerate." You
got the feeling that Walt was not a man who
enjoyed being questioned. When you're a
good or even semi-decent coach, no one
cares if you run your players till they drop.
But as the season progressed down the spi
ral, you could tell Walt was flailing. It came to
a head in November, when Michael Okwo
briefly quit the team.
I can only guess how a coach can keep
coaching when no one believes in him. Per
haps Walt was looking forward to future sea
sons. developing young players in a losing-

season trial-by-fire. Maybe he told
himself lies. Hell, maybe he would
have been happy if the whole team
followed Okwo out the door.
But 1 come to praise Walt, not just
bury him. This year's Big Game saw
the best performance by our team in
a long, long time — probably the
best they ever played under 1 larris.
which is the sort of irony that makes
evil men die laughing. You could feel
the energy, there in that tiny Cardi
nal Red sliver of fans in that abhor
rent hillside arena in that hippie
shantytown across the bay. Our
team played with authority. Ostran
der hit his marks. Our defense took
the Bears to the turf and made them
beg for Mommy. Berkeley fans shut
their mouths for the lust time in five
years. You could dare to hope.
Watching the team run oil at half

at their fingertips — that was the
first time, and the last, that we all

We lost it in the fourth. One

football squad in the deepest circle

we're not really at rock bottom,
since we could have lost one more.
Our new stadium has become a
tomb for the embalmed corpse of
Stanford Football,clawing off its fin
gertips trying to escape from the sar

Walt was wrong for us; maybe we
were wrong for Walt ; maybe football
is finished at Stanford. These are
hopeless times.

ludicrous feats of engineering that got it built

Standing in front of the players who de

Walt was painfully nondescript. His sen

on his beleaguered shoulders. "We think
we're tougher than a lot of people are giving
us credit for," he said, which is not quite as re

good or even semi-decent coach, no one
cares if you run your players till they drop.

By the time Walt Harris left Stanford,
he had suffered through all the tor
ments of every level of hell. He lost
Mark Bradford. Nick Frank and the long
suffering Trent Edwards to injury. The
stands were emptier than ever. Back in Sep
tember. he bragged that the team's motto
was:"They Said It Couldn't Be Done."They
were right. Eleven losses later, fan sentiment
was at a nihilistic low — most students,gone
sadistic from hopelessness, were pulling for a
"perfect season" of 12 losses. Then we beat
Washington. Walt couldn't even lose right.
It wasn't supposed to be like this. Two
years ago. Buddy Teevens finished off his
three-year coaching stint quagmired in medi
ocrity. Teevens was a lovely fella, well-liked
by the players. I le was a nice guy,perhaps too
nice. His door was always open. His name
was Buddy. But football coaches should be
respected, and feared. Buddy lacked the
killer instinct.
So. Walt Harris. Cynics hooted that, like
Teevens before him. Walt was a close friend
and butt-buddy of then-Athletic Director
led Leland. But Harris rescued Pitt's foot
ball program, going to six bowl games and
making them a serious Big East competitor.
I le was going to Change Shit Up. I le had the
team run crack-of-dawn suicide jogs in the
winter. 1 le had a terse style, a take-no-prison
ers attitude. No more Buddy Ball. No more
stammering O-Line. No more running up the
middle.Trent Edwards shall not be knocked
out twice before halftime. We will make the
Vegas Bowl. We will make it through fourth
quarter. We will make a first down. Hope,
which has gone out of fashion this decade,
was high.
Walt's first season was not really disas
trous, just typically mediocre. You would ex
pect no more from a coach in his first season,
unless you were a Stanford fan, in which case
you were calling for Walt's head on a platter.

contemplating yet another year without a
Bowl Game or a winning record. Stanford
fans want a quick fix — even if we don't par
ticularly like football.it seems natural that, as
long as we have a football team, it should be
the best in the country. We wanted Walt to
build us an empire, to find us another Elway,
to give the Axe Committee a reason for
breathing. He was doomed.
It wasn't all his fault. Walt was thrust into
catastrophic times and had very little to work
with. Some of his older players were recruit
ed by Tyrone Willingham eons ago; the
younger guys.Teevens' boys, were lost in the
inevitable shuffle of new coaches, new assis
tants and new players to develop. Because
Stanford has academic standards, it will al
ways be difficult to compete in the Pac-10 —
our players need good SAT scores, whereas
USC only requires basic motor skills and an
interest in sociology.
