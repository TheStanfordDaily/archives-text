By the time you read this, we will
be nine days into the new year, and
with it. nine days into one of the most
magnificent celebrations in the histo
ry of human existence: a period of ex
tended facial hair growth that lasts
from the very beginning of Januhairy
until the close of Februhairy. During
this two-month holiday, participants
in the celebration make their best ef
forts to avoid shaving at all costs, wel
coming hair onto their bodies and
into their lives.
Perhaps you have noticed that
Stanford campus has grown slightly
hairier as of late; perhaps you have
not. Regardless, 1 think it important
that you are aware of this holiday and
its nature. It traces its roots back to the

dawn of human history, when the ear
liest Homo sapiens struggled through
blisteringly cold winters. Battered by
icy winds, humans cultivated thick
beards in an effort to insulate their
faces. It is in honor of their efforts that
we celebrate Januhairy and
Februhairy; we commemorate their
fortitude by growing beards of our
own. since our entire existence is con
tingent upon their survival. Of course,
some humans today continue this tra
dition in its most authentic vein, be
ginning their beards when the days
begin to shorten as Autumn draws to
a close. Hut for many, Januhairy and
Februhairy are the most practical
means of celebration.
So let this also stand as an open in
vitation to any and all who want to
join in this crusade. But do not un
derestimate the magnitude of the
challenge you will face. After all, ab
staining from the razor for a two

month period is no easy task. Itchi
ness. being snubbed by the ladies, and
death are potential roadblocks that
might deter you from reaching the
ultimate goal. Yet you mustn't let
such petty concerns impede your
progress as beard-growers. Growing
a beard is the ultimate means of tran
scendence to a higher state of being.
It matters not if it is dense as the
Amazon or sparse like the Siberian
tundra. What matters is the effort.
When the clock strikes twelve on
Februhairy 28, you will realize this,
and you will revel in the glory of your
accomplishment.
Finally, I feel obligated to point
out that participation in Januhairy
and Februhairy is the best way to
prepare for Moustache March. But
that is an entirely different subject.
