## Sloppy SEC success No. 10 Cardinal win tenth straight game 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a month-long series of domi
nant wins, the No. 10 women's basket
hall team opened its return to Maples
Pavilion last night looking like shad
ows of their December selves. Al
though the Cardinal defeated the
University of South Carolina 69-54.
Stanford's 15 turnovers allowed the
Gamecocks to hang around.
What is more, the offensive bal
ance that Stanford had recently estab
lished faded into the background of
the Smith-Wiggins Show, in which
senior center Brooke Smith starred
with a season-high 28 points. Head
coachTara VanDerveer praised all as
pects of Smith's performance.
"Brooke really put us on her back
and carried us the whole night," Van-
Derveer said."She played really hard.
She played good defense, had good
rebounding, obviously scored, and
read the defense well. It was a great
game for Brooke, and I'm really
happy she played so well."
Smith attributed much of her suc
cess to her exposure to tougher de
fenders.
"I always try to read if I'm being
[double-teamed]," Smith said. "I was
n't doubled as hard as 1 have been [in
other match-ups]. Also. Tara and I

talked about looking for my shot a lit
tle more, and 1 think that helped."
Junior guard Candice Wiggins fol
lowed Smith with 15 points, while the
rest of the team contributed only 26
points. Freshman forward Javne
Appel. who led the team in scoring in
four of the Cardinal's last seven
games, was only l-of-6 from the field.
Stanford's lead hovered around 10
points throughout the first period.and
the second half was filled with much
of the same as the Cardinal struggled
to find separation. Stanford's largest
margin was 17 points with K:42 to go.
In the next three minutes, though, the
lead slipped to six thanks to three of
South Carolina senior Stacy Booker's
five three-pointers and a jumper by
senior Lauren Simms.
Wiggins said that the run brought
back memories of Stanford's first loss
of the season to Brigham Young Uni
versity on Nov. 13. but she never lost
her confidence in the team.
"[Booker's] back-to-back three's
definitely reminded me of B YU. but 1
knew we wouldn't let [an upset] hap
pen again." Wiggins said. "We learned
our lesson then."
Hie Cardinal proved that it had
learned well by responding with a 10-
2 run to finish the game.
Despite South Carolina's size, with
five players taller than six feet, two
inches, Stanford (12-3. 5-0 Pacific 10
Conference) was able to out-rebound
the Gamecocks 47-36. pulling down
39 defensive boards. Smith. Appel.

each registered seven rebounds. It
marked the third straight game in
which four Cardinal players posted at
least that number.
South Carolina (10-6, 0-1 South
eastern Conference) was led by
Booker, who had 17 points and six re
bounds. but found support from
bench players Brionna Dickerson and
Lakesha Tolliver, who each registered
seven points. But forwards lva
Sliskovic, Melanie Johnson, and Uona
Burgrova were unable to make their
usual contributions to the Game
cocks' offense, and did not register a
single point in the paint during the
first half. Their absence rippled
throughout South Carolina's offense,
and the Gamecocks shot only 30 per
cent from the field.
VanDerveer noted that the game's
closeness was probably due to some
fatigue, as the Cardinal played their
third game in six days.
"1 think we played a little tired,and
we weren't very inspired," Van-
Derveer said."But,it was good to play
against South Carolina. They're an
SEC team, and are bigger than most
of the teams in the Pac-10. They're
athletic, deep, and have an excellent
coach. It was a good experience."
