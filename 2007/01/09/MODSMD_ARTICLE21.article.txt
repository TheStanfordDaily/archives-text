## Harbaugh keeps it in the family New head coach no stranger to life on the sidelines 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Newly hired head football coach Jim
I larbaugh has only been a full-time coach
for less than a decade after a long playing
career. But he had a head start on some of
his colleagues — he was born into the
profession.
Harbaugh noted in his introductory
press conference that all the men in his

family were coaches. His father Jack was
an assistant coach at Michigan and Stan
ford before head coaching stops at West
ern Michigan and Western Kentucky. His
brother John is the special teams coach
for the Philadelphia Eagles, which ad
vanced to the divisional playoffs with a
38-yard field goal on Sunday. 1 lis brother
in-law Tom Crean is the head basketball
coach at Marquette University in Mil
waukee, whose Dwayne Wade-led team
advanced to the Final Four in 2()03.
And it doesn't stop there: Former col
lege football coach and ESPN analyst
Mike Gottfried is Jack's cousin, and Got
tfried's nephew Mark Gottfried — Jack's
godson — is the head basketball coach at

Alabama.
Jack Harbaugh spent seven seasons
(1973-1979) as defensive backs coach at
Michigan, putting his young son into reg
ular contact with Wolverine head coach
Bo Schembechler. The young 1 farbaugh
tagged along to practice and never failed
to get in the coach's hair. "1 must have
kicked him out of a hundred practices,"
Jack said. Young Jim even once put his
feet up on the head coach's desk.
Jack took the Stanford defensive coor
dinator job in 1980, and Jim starred at
Palo Alto High School across the street
from John Elway and the Cardinal. He

worked summer jobs and went to foot
ball camp on Stanford campus. But
without a scholarship offer from Stan
ford — it was suggested his skills were
too raw — Jim Harbaugh became the
hometown hero at Michigan in Ann
Arbor.
In his 1989biography,Schembechler
called Harbaugh "the cockiest" quar
terback he ever had at Michigan. Jerry
Hanlon. Harbaugh's position coach,
called him "as great a competitor" as
any he'd coached.
"He can't stand people not being as
competitive as him." Hanlon said, relay
ing a practice incident where Harbaugh
chewed out receivers for failing to
chase after his deep passes.
Harbaugh's biggest moment came
after a shocking loss to Minnesota in
1986. In a distraught Michigan locker
room. Harbaugh made an off-the-cuff

remark to a reporter regarding the next
week's game at rival Ohio State: "I
guarantee we will beat Ohio State and
go to Pasadena."
Hanlon was apoplectic. "I wanted to
kill him!" he said. Schembechler later
said he told Harbaugh, "You better be
right!" and noted he would have been
more concerned if 1 larbaugh didn't ex
pect to win. But Hanlon said that the
head coach rallied the coaches around
their field general.
"Bo told us, the son of a gun has
made a statement, and now we're going
to have to back it up," he said.
The Wolverines won 26-24, the sec
ond of Harbaugh's back-to-back wins
over the Buckeyes. He was named All
America and Big Ten Player of the Year
that season.
Asked about 1 larbaugh's potential as
a coach, 1 lanlon described several char
acteristics apparent in his playing days.
"He has studied the game of football
— if you don't know what you're teach
ing. you're not going to be a good
coach," he said.
Hanlon also praised Harbaugh's in

tense film study with coaches and his
desire to do more.
"I le didn't just go out there and play
the game, he learned the little tech
niques [that need to he taught to play
ers]." I lanlon added.
With 16 years under center in the
NFL, 1 larbaugh spent pro offseasons as
an unpaid consultant on his father's
Western Kentucky staff, where he
helped with scouting, recruiting and
fundraising for the Division 1-AA pro
gram. The Hilltoppers won the 1-AA
National Championship in 2002.
"You will see some Bo in Jim," his fa
ther promised, also alluding to Bears
coach Mike Ditka as an influence on his
son's style.
I larbaugh's fans extend beyond his
family, though. Wisconsin coach Bret
Bielema said enthusiastically, "1 have
heard nothing but good things about
Jim I larbaugh." Michigan broadcaster
Jim Brandstatter called him a "great
kid" and said he was "perfect for Stan
ford...he believes in all the things: stu
dent-athletes, education and solid foot
ball."
