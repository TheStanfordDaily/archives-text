# Over and over, it ain't over

As a sports fan, 2006 sucked. It
seemed as if none of my fa
vorite teams could do any
thing right.
I knew the year had gotten off to
a bad start in early January when the
Colts' Mike Vanderjadt blew a field
goal in the final seconds of a playoff
match with the Steelers, ending the
magical Indianapolis season that was
meant to be. And this was just days
after my Southern California friends
and I had planned a huge gala to cel
ebrate USC's third-straight national
title with a win over No. 2 Texas.
I calmed down for the next few
months, but then the Lakers blew a 3-
1 series lead over the Phoenix Suns in
the first round of the NBA playoffs.
Like every other Angelino, I could at
least take some comfort in watching
the Clippers exact retribution, but
the Suns took care of LA's second
team in the very next round.
The summer provided mild ex
citement as the Sparks were well on
their way to a WNBA title before
being blown out by Sacramento in
the postseason.The Dodgers won the
NL Wildcard one season after post
ing their worst record since moving
from Brooklyn. But the Mets de
stroyed them in the NL Division Se
ries. I did take minor pleasure,
though, in knowing that the Giants
didn't make the playoffs and would
n't for quite a while, thanks to the
signing of the overpriced Barry Zito.
I came back to Stanford with high
hopes of finally getting to watch our
football team win at home. When
that didn't work out, I filled my head
with the possibilities of a win at Big
Game. This feat almost came to
fruition, with me standing on the
field to witness history; two failed
trips to the red zone later, Walt Har
ris got the axe.
My last chance to salvage any
kind of success for 2006 came with
the NCAA women's volleyball
championship final, pitting No. 2
Stanford against top-ranked Nebras
