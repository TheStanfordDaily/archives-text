# Over and over, it ain't over
## 
### 
As a sports fan, 2006 sucked. It
seemed as if none of my fa
vorite teams could do any
thing right.
I knew the year had gotten off to
a bad start in early January when the
Colts' Mike Vanderjadt blew a field
goal in the final seconds of a playoff
match with the Steelers, ending the
magical Indianapolis season that was
meant to be. And this was just days
after my Southern California friends
and I had planned a huge gala to cel
ebrate USC's third-straight national
title with a win over No. 2 Texas.
I calmed down for the next few
months, but then the Lakers blew a 3-
1 series lead over the Phoenix Suns in
the first round of the NBA playoffs.
Like every other Angelino, I could at
least take some comfort in watching
the Clippers exact retribution, but
the Suns took care of LA's second
team in the very next round.
The summer provided mild ex
citement as the Sparks were well on
their way to a WNBA title before
being blown out by Sacramento in
the postseason.The Dodgers won the
NL Wildcard one season after post
ing their worst record since moving
from Brooklyn. But the Mets de
stroyed them in the NL Division Se
ries. I did take minor pleasure,
though, in knowing that the Giants
didn't make the playoffs and would
n't for quite a while, thanks to the
signing of the overpriced Barry Zito.
I came back to Stanford with high
hopes of finally getting to watch our
football team win at home. When
that didn't work out, I filled my head
with the possibilities of a win at Big
Game. This feat almost came to
fruition, with me standing on the
field to witness history; two failed
trips to the red zone later, Walt Har
ris got the axe.
My last chance to salvage any
kind of success for 2006 came with
the NCAA women's volleyball
championship final, pitting No. 2
Stanford against top-ranked Nebras


Andrew
Lomeli
The SoCal Bias
ka. The hottest team in the country
heading into the postseason, the Cardi
nal had won both the nation's toughest
conference (the Pac-10) and the sup
port of ESPN. After taking the first
game from the Huskers, Stanford bare
ly dropped the next three.
It seems as if the only saving grace of
the year for me was Club Deportivo
Guadalajara's soccer championship in
Mexico. And while that was indeed a
huge win for followers of the Chivas all
around the world, I was still left unsatis
fied.
But none of these teams' failures
could compare to the utter disappoint
ment in learning the hard way that you
should never leave a game early.
Relaxing in my aunt's Las Vegas
home just hours after enjoying the na
tion's largest party. New Years Day

seemed rather dull.
Exactly as I had expected. Southern
California manhandled Michigan in the
Grand Daddy of'Em All to prove that
Notre Dame — and not USC — was
the country's most overrated college
football squad.
Boise State had just secured a 21-10
lead over Oklahoma heading into half
time of the Fiesta Bowl. Figuring it was
over, 1 joined my family for dinner and
several games of Sorry! But before
heading to bed, I checked ESPN one
last time to find that even Rick Reilly
couldn't have written a better ending to
the Fiesta Bowl.
'I"his. of course, came just months
after turning off a radio when the
Dodgers trailed the Padres by four runs
heading into the ninth inning on Sept.
18. We all know what happened there
after: the worst home run-hitting team
in the league put together four straight
round-trippers in a span of seven pitch
es to tie the match before Noniar Garci
aparra knocked a walk-off homer to
seal the greatest moment at Dodger

Stadium since l l )88.
Back then, 1 hadn't felt so stupid since
January 22 of the same year, when 1 de
cided to get an early start on some re
quired reading instead of watching what
was sure to be an uneventful l.akers-
Raptors game. I was halfway through the
Qu'ran when my brother called my up
for the first time in three months to ask if
1 was watching the match.
By then it was too late. Kobe had
made history with SI points in one
evening, while I blew the dust off the
No. 8 jersey in my closet.
As 1 again decided to not make the
same mistake, 1 made sure to sit down
and watch the entire Sugar Bowl, no
matter how much LSU beat up on
Notre Dame.
I 1 eres to a mighty good year, one in
which I resolve to never stop watching a
game early. God knows what kind of his
tory will be made this year, but 1 will be
there to see it all.
And it will all begin on Feb. 4 when
the Colts beat the Fagles in Super Bowl
XII.
