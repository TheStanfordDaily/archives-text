## Card face winter woes Gardner, Zupancic shine individually 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling stayed busy
over the winter break, as the Cardi
nal continued to gear up for the heart
of its Pac-10 schedule in February.
Although inconsistency continued to
plague the squad on the whole, All-
American junior Tanner Gardner
(125 pounds) and junior Josh Zupan
cic (157 pounds) remained solid con
tributors.
Hie Cardinal (2-5. 1-1 Pac-10)
sent wrestlers to the Reno Tourna
ment of Champions Dec. 20. the
Southern Scuffle Dec. and 30 in
Greensboro. N.C.and the Menlo In
vitational Jan. 7 in Atherton, Calif.
The Cardinal also hosted the inaugu
ral Stanford Duals as Columbia. No.
23 Lehigh and Pac-10 rival UC-
Davis came to the Farm Jan. 5.
Gardner and Zupancic placed
first and second at Reno, and second
and sixth in the Southern Scuffle, re
spectively. TTieir early-season per
formances earned each of the Cardi
nal wrestlers a spot in the national
rankings. Gardner's 22-3 overall
record earned him the No. 4 ranking
entering the Stanford Duals while
Zupancic, who has placed in every
tournament he has competed in this
year and holds a 25-7 record, held the
No. 16 ranking.

at 165 pounds, also garnered a third
place finish at Reno. At the Southern
Scuffle, freshman Zach Giesen at 184
pounds and senior Brian Perry at 165
pounds were the only other Stanford
wrestlers to advance to the second
day of competition. Each went 0-2 in
the second day of competition, how
ever. and failed to place.
After the Scuffle, Stanford coach
Kerry McCoy was confident that
with a return to a normal training
schedule his team's performance
would improve heading into the
dual-meet season.
"We didn't wrestle our best, but
we made some errors that we can
work on." McCoy said. "Now we
have some time to train and get
ready for the dual-meet season,
which is the most important. We have
gotten some great chances to see
conference teams, hut we're going to
have to kick it up and improve to
meet our year-end goals."

Gardner was perfect at the Stan
ford Duals — earning wins over all
three of his opponents, two by tech
nical fall. Overall, though, the Cardi
nal finished the day far from perfect.
Stanford lost 27-11 to Columbia (4-
0), 34-9 to No. 23 Lehigh (8-5) and
29-12 to conference rival UC-Davis
(2-3). Hie Lehigh dual in particular
carried special significance for
McCoy.
"Lehigh was my home for five
years," he said." I have a lot of strong
ties to that program, including [head
coach | Greg Strobel, who was my
coach for almost 10 years and is one
of my mentors."
The loss to UC-Davis. on the
other hand, should only intensify the
budding rivalry between the two
wrestling programs — at least from
Stanford's perspective.
"UC-Davis is a conference oppo
nent, so a lot rides on each match,"
McCoy said. "Right now, there are a
bunch of guys we recruited wrestling
for them and vice versa."
Another performance of note at
the Stanford Duals was sophomore
Luke Feist's 6-5 decision over Co
lumbia's eleventh-ranked Matt

Palmer at 174 pounds. Nevertheless,
McCoy and the Cardinal were frustrat
ed with their 0-3 showing in their first
home duals of the season.
"Overall, I'm very disappointed in

the way we performed," McCoy said.
"We're better than what we showed,
but our guys need to be able to step up
and win the close ones, and that didn't
happen today. Hopefully, we'll learn
from this and get better."
Ilie Menlo Invitational was a chance
for Stanford's freshmen to prove them
selves, as Giesen and Jake Johnson each
earned first-place finishes at IN4 and
174 pounds, respectively. Capping the

strong showing was freshman Cameron
Teitelmann who took second place at
133 pounds.
The Cardinal will finish off a light
month of competition in January as they
face San Francisco State, Cal State Bak
ersfield and Menlo before they hit the
heart of their conference schedule in
February. Next up for Stanford is a home
dual against San Francisco State this Fri
day at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
