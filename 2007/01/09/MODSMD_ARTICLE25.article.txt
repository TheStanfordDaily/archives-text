## Champ Gators gobble Ohio State Florida upsets No. 1 Buckeyes, 41-14 
### BEN WALKER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) - Not
even close.
Florida — yes, Florida — owned
the tield it wasn't supposed to be on,
embarrassing I leisman Trophy win
ner Troy Smith and No. 1 Ohio State
41 -14 on Monday night to run away
with college football's national
championship.
Chris Leak and Tim Tebow
showed off coach Urban Meyer's
twin quarterback system to perfec
tion as the No. 2 Gators became the
first Division I school to hold na
tional titles in football and basket
ball at the same time.
"We came here with a chip on
our shoulder and something to
prove," Florida receiver Dallas
Baker said. "Nobody gave us a

chance, but finally we can throw up
the No. 1."
Now, only one question remains:
What about 13-0 Boise State, the
last undefeated team left standing
after stunning Oklahoma on the
very same field in the Fiesta Bowl
on New Year's Day.
Florida's amazingly easy victory
left the Gators and the Buckeyes
with identical 13-1 records and, with
Wisconsin and Louisville also losing
just once, almost surely will renew
calls for a playoff system.
Ohio State started out like the
one-touchdown favorite it was, but
only for an instant.
Ted Ginn Jr. returned the open
ing kickoff 93 yards for a touch
down, but then it quickly fell apart
for the Buckeyes. Ginn hobbled off
minutes later, after OSU's first of
fensive play, with a foot injury, and
by the time he returned for the sec
ond half on crutches, Florida led 34-
14.
"Ohio State didn't get it done,"
Buckeyes coach Jim Tressel said.
Meyer had a word for the critics

who demeaned the Gators.
"I'd like to thank all those peo
ple. Our pregame speech was easy,"
he said.
Leak, maligned for never win
ning the big one, completed 25 of 36
passes for 213 yards and a touch
down. The Rambo-like Tehow
threw for one TD and powered into
the end zone for another.
Smith, meanwhile, joined a long
list of Heisman Trophy quarter
backs — Jason White, Eric Crouch
and Gino Torretta, among them —
to fall apart in bowl games. He was
just 4-for-14 for 35 yards with one
interception and was held to minus
-29 yards in 10 runs.
"Not everything in life is going to
go the exact way you want it," Smith
said. "1 don't have any regrets,
though. I really don't. We came out
and fought. We came up short.
"Sometimes you have great games
and sometimes you don't."
Defensive ends Derrick Harvey
and Jarvis Moss made it a miserable
night for Smith. Linebacker Earl
Everett got into the act. too, run
ning down Smith on one play-dq*
spite missing his helmet. ' ! i<^
"Honestly, we've played a lot
better teams than them." Moss
said. "I could name four or five
teams in the SEC that could prob
ably compete with them and play
the same type of game we did
against them."
It was the second national title
for Florida, adding to the one

Heisman winner Danny Wuerffel
brought home in 1996 under
coach Steve Spurrier with a 52-20
romp over Florida State in the
Sugar Bowl.
ITiis time, the man in charge
was the 42-year-old Meyer, once a
.200 hitter in the low minors in At
lanta's baseball larm system. Since
then, he's made a rocket rise in the
coaching ranks, topped off by a
title in his second year at Florida.
The trophy will make a perfect
bookend for the one the basket
ball Gators won by beating
UCLA for the national champi
onship in Indianapolis last spring.
"How do 1 compare them?
Both have confetti landing on my

head." athletic director Jeremy
Foley said." 1 couldn't believe it in
April, 1 can't believe it now. I can't
believe I can talk about it without
jinxing us. Obviously, things had to
break our way to even get here."
Tressel's team, meanwhile,
looked as if it belonged at the
1 loliday Bowl, because it took
this night off. Given 51 days to
prepare, the Buckeyes were con
fused from the get-go once Flori
da got the ball.
In the first football matchup
between these schools — they've
both played the sport for 100-plus
years — the Gators emphatically
stopped Ohio State's 19-game
winning streak.
