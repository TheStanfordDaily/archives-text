## Spring break: Senor Frogs or service learning? Stanford's ASB program more popular than ever; 370 apply 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
As students scramble to snag cheap plane tick
ets to such sunny, hedonistic spots as Cancun and
Cabo, some Stanford students have decided to
spend their spring breaks in a less traditional way.
as service trips over the break have grown increas
ingly popular.
Hie Hillel House and the Catholic community

typically offer service trips, but the most popular
program by far is the Alternative Spring Break
(ASB) program sponsored by the Haas Center for
Public Service.
Founded in 1987, participation in ASB has risen
gradually, topping 370 applicants for the 2006-2007
program. Participants enroll in a one-unit winter
quarter course to meet the other students in their
program and learn about their trip.
Stanford's ASB program, which is affiliated
with the national alternative break organization
BreakAway, has been honored with the "Alterna
tive Spring Break Program of the Year" and "Cur
riculum Based Alternative Break of the Year"
awards. BreakAway continues to support the Stan

ford program through a series of grants. On cam
pus. the Lyon's Service Award and Outstanding
Achievement Award from the Dean of Students
went to ASH in 1998 and 2002 respectively.
Jon McConnell.ASÃŸ program coordinator with
the Haas Center, oversees the 14 separate trips to
places such as Washington D.C.. New Orleans. Al
abama. and El Paso.
"They arc unique service and learning opportu
nities that address issues that resonate with stu
dents' interests. McConnell said. "The success of
the program builds on itself each year, which has
also created a strong reputation on campus."
Many students feel that the con
structive experience on an alterna
tive trip beats the typical beach
booze lest associated with collegiate
spring break.
"You could do that any other
time," said sophomore Nicole Kim,
who participated in the Hawaii
ASB last year and plans to go to 11

Paso this coming break." For me,
both of my trips are out of the area,
so it's an alternative to going
abroad. I really like the service
component. You have fun,but at the
same time you can do something for
the community."
Plus, according to Kim, an ASB
program won't hurt in the job search.
"It can also help on a resume, es
pecially it it has something to do with
your major." she said.
Applications were due for this
year's ASB on Nov.s,but the program
is expected to continue next year.
