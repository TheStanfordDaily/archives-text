## Course evaluation system of limited aid to students New online system an upgrade, but CourseGuide still lacking 
### EMMA TROTTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's new online course evaluation sys
tem boasted a 88.8 percent participation rate
from students, leading Registrar Roger Printup
to declare the debut a success.
Fliers advertising the new system attempted
to entice students with the prospect of a friend
ly competition: "Can Stanford beat Yale's 80%
response rate?"
But students also had more tangible reasons
to fill out their course evaluations by the Dec.
17 deadline. Participants were entered in a
drawing to win one of 50 i Tunes gift cards, and
students who did not complete their evalua
tions on time could not view their grades until
January.
Some students, however, said that the en
ticements did not make them any more likely to
fill out evaluations.
"I would have done them anyway," said
freshman Sylvie Rousseau."l think they're use
ful."
A SSI > Senator Danny Arbeiter, a junior,
agreed.
"I hope students realize that evaluation data
results are used in setting salaries and prepar

ing teaching award nominations, so students
are actually quite empowered when they pro
vide their input." he said.
In their first run. ASSU senators and the
Registrar's Office said they were pleased with
the results.
Two years ago, course evaluations at Stan
ford were completely on paper. The first half
consisted of the same questions that are now
online,focusing on feedback for the faculty.The
other half consisted of a series of questions
written by the ASSU, intended to provide a
venue for students to offer advice to other stu
dents about which courses and professors to
choose.
The paper evaluations were cited by admin
istrators as cumbersome and laborious to sort.
The new online system features a level of effi
ciency missing in previous years.
As students old enough to remember the
paper evaluations probably noticed, the second
half of the questions was missing from last
quarter's evaluations.The ASSU is taking steps
to remedy this issue in future quarters. Howev
er, a "delicate balance," as Arbeiter character
ized it, is causing the hesitation.
"Personally, I would be very happy if we
could add the questions from the bottom half of
the old paper evaluations to the online course
evaluation system, as 1 found this data very use
ful," Arbeiter said. "However, all of us are very
afraid to add a second page of ques
tions to the course evaluation sys
tem, as we fear that if the question
naire is too long, the participation
rate will drop dramatically."
Ideally, the evaluation summaries
will be available to students from
within the online time schedule, Ar
beiter said.
Hie new online evaluation sys
tem, however.did nothing to address
the lack of a course guide for stu
dents, placing Stanford behind its
peer institutions, most of which pro
vide a wealth of student-generated
opinions on classes and teachers on
line.
Harvard freshman Katie Shick
said she relies upon her school's

Course Evaluation Guide.
"At the end of each term we have
the option to evaluate our courses
based on professor, workload, and
difficulty, among other criteria," she
said. "The information is available
online, and hard copies are also dis
tributed to students."
The ASSU appears to be moving
in this direction for course evalua
tions at Stanford, but members have
yet to figure out a practical way to
provide detailed information with
out adversely affecting student par
ticipation.
"The best format and medium in
which the ASSU should do this is
something we'll have to discuss now
that we actually have data to work
with again." Arbeiter said. "We'd
greatly appreciate students' feed
back on this topic."
