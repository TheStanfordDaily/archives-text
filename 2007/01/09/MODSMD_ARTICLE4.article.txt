## Course evaluation system of limited aid to students New online system an upgrade, but CourseGuide still lacking 
### EMMA TROTTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's new online course evaluation sys
tem boasted a 88.8 percent participation rate
from students, leading Registrar Roger Printup
to declare the debut a success.
Fliers advertising the new system attempted
to entice students with the prospect of a friend
ly competition: "Can Stanford beat Yale's 80%
response rate?"
But students also had more tangible reasons
to fill out their course evaluations by the Dec.
17 deadline. Participants were entered in a
drawing to win one of 50 i Tunes gift cards, and
students who did not complete their evalua
tions on time could not view their grades until
January.
Some students, however, said that the en
ticements did not make them any more likely to
fill out evaluations.
"I would have done them anyway," said
freshman Sylvie Rousseau."l think they're use
ful."
A SSI > Senator Danny Arbeiter, a junior,
agreed.
"I hope students realize that evaluation data
results are used in setting salaries and prepar

ing teaching award nominations, so students
are actually quite empowered when they pro
vide their input." he said.
In their first run. ASSU senators and the
Registrar's Office said they were pleased with
the results.
Two years ago, course evaluations at Stan
ford were completely on paper. The first half
consisted of the same questions that are now
online,focusing on feedback for the faculty.The
other half consisted of a series of questions
written by the ASSU, intended to provide a
venue for students to offer advice to other stu
dents about which courses and professors to
choose.
The paper evaluations were cited by admin
istrators as cumbersome and laborious to sort.
The new online system features a level of effi
ciency missing in previous years.
As students old enough to remember the
paper evaluations probably noticed, the second
half of the questions was missing from last
quarter's evaluations.The ASSU is taking steps
to remedy this issue in future quarters. Howev
er, a "delicate balance," as Arbeiter character
ized it, is causing the hesitation.
"Personally, I would be very happy if we
could add the questions from the bottom half of
the old paper evaluations to the online course
evaluation system, as 1 found this data very use
ful," Arbeiter said. "However, all of us are very
