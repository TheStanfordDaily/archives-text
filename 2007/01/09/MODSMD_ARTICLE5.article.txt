### ADAM SOWLATI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a sudden, mid-year move. Di
rector of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo resigned Jan. 5 to become
Vice Provost for Student Life at
Saint Mary's College in Moraga.
Calif.
Despite some raised eyebrows
from students and dorm staff, Ca
marillo's colleagues said they were
not surprised when she announced
she her move to the Catholic liberal
arts school.
"Jane is leaving to pursue an in
credible job," said Arcadio Morales.
Residence Dean of Governor's Cor
ner and off-campus undergraduates.
"Certainly the prospect of becoming
vice provost of student life at Saint
Mary's College is a professional ad
vancement opportunity difficult to
pass up. Waiting until the end of the
school year may not have been an
option."
In the meantime, a transition plan
has been created to ensure that Res
idential Education continues to run
smoothly. Until a successor is named.
Vice Provost tor Student Affairs
Greg Boardman and senior staff in
Residential I education will take on
responsibilities formerly held by Ca
marillo. According to Boardman. a
national search for a successor will
begin next month and likely con
clude in the early summer.
Camarillo's 11-year tenure at
Stanford was marked by dramatic
changes to Residential Lducation,
perhaps none more controversial
than the gradual tightening of the al
cohol policy. Starting in 2003. drink
ing was banned in the common areas
of all-freshman residences. Several
years before that, dorms were
banned from using house funds to
purchase alcohol for parties.

Camarillo long argued that a
stricter policy for freshmen resulted
in less alcohol related problems
among first-year students, including
a drop in emergency room visits. But
her case has never convinced some
students and dorm staff, who still
maintain that the ban on drinking in
common areas promotes excessive
and dangerous drinking behind
closed doors.

Jane is leaving to pur
sue an incredible job
Waiting until the end
of the ear may not
have been an option.

Aside from the alcohol policy, Ca
marillo left her mark on dorm diver
sity programs.
"I would say that one of Jane's
major accomplishments was making
a multicultural curriculum an inte
gral part of the residences," Morales
said. "It was under her leadership
and guidance of Tommy Woon. Stan
ford's former Multicultural Educa
tor. that dorm programs like Cross
ing the Line and Race Dialogues.and
NSO's Faces of the Community were
developed."
But her involvement in dorm pro
gramming sometimes rubbed stu
dents the wrong way. In Dec. 2003,
Camarillo banned Secret Snowflake
activities from dining halls, charging
that the tradition was unsanitary and
caused extra work for dining work
ers. In a staff editorial that month.
The Daily editorial board charged
that, "In almost every area of Uni
versity governance, students have a
powerful voice at the decision-mak
ing table. Not so in Camarillo world.
Decisions are churned out just in
time for students to get mad about
them — but unfortunately, too late
to do anything about changing
them."
According to class of 2004 gradu
ate A.J. Magnuson in an editorial in
The Daily, Residential Education
"created pluralistic communities
through draconian measures, need
lessly eliminating social outlets and
refusing to provide adequate alter
natives."
ASSU Senator Danny Arbeiter.a
junior, struck a gentler note last
night as he reflected on her tenure.
"It seems like Residential Educa
tion ends up between a rock and a
hard place," he said, "and it's been
my observation that Camarillo has
always made the best decision
among her options."
