## ERRANT TEE SHOTS? BLAME EVOLUTION 
### 
Good news for those who can't hit picture-perfect drives
on the golf course: Stanford researchers claim the problem is
a natural byproduct of evolution.
The Washington Post reports that a study published in the
Dec. 21 issue of the journal Neuron found that the brain plans
and processes a movement differently every repetition — re
gardless of the amount of practice.
Stanford researchers, including postdoctoral student
Mark C'hurchland, trained rhesus monkeys to reach quickly
for a red spot and slowly for a green spot.They found, howev
er. that the animals rarely reached for the same-colored spots
at the same speed, and further discovered that the monkeys'
brain activity levels varied for each attempt.
One possible explanation for the observation is that evo
lution favored predators who could improvise, as they never
face an identical situation twice when hunting prey.
"The nervous system was not designed to do the same
thing over and over." said C'hurchland. a co-author of the
study, to the Washington Post. "The nervous system was de
signed to be flexible. You typically find yourself doing things
you've never done before."
