# NEW DRUG COULD HELP RELIEVE CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME
## 
### 
Medical School researchers have identified a promising drug
that may prove useful in relieving chronic fatigue syndrome.
Associate Prof. Jose Montoya and postdoctoral student

Andreas Kogelnik have seen 21 of the 25 patients they have
treated over the past three years with drug valganciclovir im
prove significantly. F.ven better, the improvement has been
sustained after patients cycled off the drug, an antiviral often
used in treating diseases like herpes.
"'lTiis study is small and preliminary, but potentially very
important," said Anthony Komaroff. a Harvard Medical
School Professor. "11 a randomized trial confirmed the value
of this therapy for patients like the ones studied here.it would
be an important landmark in the treatment of this illness."
Roche Pharmaceutical has granted Montoya $1.3 million
to continue research into the drug starting this quarter.
