# ANTIDEPRESSANT PATCH COULD BE NEXT FOR QUITTING SMOKERS
## 
### 
Researchers at the Stanford Prevention Research Center
have unveiled an antidepressant skin patch that they hope
will improve upon the current 20 percent success rate ot
smokers trying to quit. The Food and Drug Administration
approved the patch, with its antidepressant selegiline, as an
antidepressant treatment in February 2(X)b. Researchers
think the patch could also help smokers combat their crav
ings. according to study leader Medical School Prof. Joel
Killen.
Doctors currently prescribe antidepressants to smokers
looking to quit, but this study marks the first use of an antide
pressant patch. Compared to a pill, a patch comes with fewer
side effects and provides a higher, more consistent level of
the medication, according to Killen.
