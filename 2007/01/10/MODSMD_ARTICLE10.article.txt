## Editorial Board Sexual assault at Stanford 
### 
Imagine that it is 2:00 a.m. on a Saturday
morning and a student has just been
raped. Uncertain where to go or what to
do, she bikes to the emergency room at
Stanford Hospital â€” Vaden Student
Health Center is closed. After admitting
herself, she is told that Stanford Hospital,
one of the leading research hospitals in the
countrv. does not have the capacity to han
dle her situation. ITie student is asked to
wait as a police unit arrives. She sits in a po
lice cruiser as they make the 21 mile drive to
Valley Medical Center in San Jose to receive
a Physical Evidence Recovery Kit (PERK)
exam, which will obtain legally correct evi
dence in case the victim decides to prose
cute her attacker.
Another student is raped in rural Walla
Walla. Washington. She goes to the small,
liberal arts school of Whitman College. She
walks to her student health center, which is
open 24 hours a day. The nurse on-call per
sonally drives her to St. Mary's hospital,
which is roughly a mile away, to have a
PERK exam performed. Up until three
\ ears ago.she could even have had the exam
done at the student health center.
There have been no cases of sexual as
sault reported at the Whitman health center
in the last three years, yet Whitman contin
ues to maintain a detailed support system
for sexual assault survivors.
Prom May 2005 to April 2006. there were
nine cases of sexual assault reported to
Stanford's rape hotline. This statistic is
thought to represent 15-20 percent of actual
cases of sexual assault at Stanford, accord
ing to Leondra Peloquin, the Stanford liai
son to the YWCA Silicon Valley Rape Cri
sis Center. Peloquin works at Vaden, Mon
day-Thursday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.. although ap
pointments can be made during normal
business hours.
Stanford has no 24-7 on-call staff at
Vaden Health Center to directly handle
cases of sexual assault, and recommends on
their website that survivors of sexual assault

call the rape crisis hotline at (650) 725-9955.
Hie hotline is run by the YWCA Sexual
Assault Center at Stanford. I lowever. Stan
lord has no rape crisis center of its own.The
Sexual Assault Center at Stanford is actual
ly a small arm of the YWCA Silicon Valley
Rape Crisis Center, a superb resource locat
ed in San Jose.
So here is the problem: If you had just
been sexually assaulted, would you think
to call the YWCA hotline? Prior to this
editorial, did you know that it existed? I low
much would you want to think about which
steps to take after you had been sexually as
saulted?
It makes sense that students and mem
bers of the Stanford community would intu
itively go to a hospital that is world
renowned for its research and that has one
of the best medical school programs in the
country. What does not make sense is that
the elite Stanford 1 lospital, as well as the
university associated with it. does not have
the capability to handle something as basic
as cases of sexual assault.
It is embarrassing that Stanford does not
budget to have PERK exams available on
or near campus. It is unbelievable that in an
age of fierce competition for top students,
Stanford officials have not campaigned to
get a PERK program in order to support the
health and well-being of Stanford students
and staff. There is a Stanford Sexual Vio
lence Advisory Board, which functions "to
reduce the occurrence of sexual violence on
campus and to provide guidelines to help
ensure consistent compliance with the Uni
versity's Policy on Sexual Assault and relat
ed policies." However, the activities of the
board are not well publicized, and although
they have the capacity to shape policy, a
PI RK program has yet to come to campus.
As suggested by a twenty-five-year prac
ticing physician who received his M.D. and
performed his residency at Stanford, if
