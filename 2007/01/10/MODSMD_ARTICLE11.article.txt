# The 						upside of rain
## 
### 
The start of winter quarter means the
start of winter, and that, in our Orien
tal rug-loving town of Palo Alto,
means rain. Rain is depressing, not to men
tion wet, and its entry onto the meteorolog
ical scene marks a perceptible shift in stu
dent activities.
For starters, rain makes biking a hassle
and a half. My sponge seat soaks up water
and then releases its liter holdings into the
inseam of my jeans, my un-fendered back
wheel spits up water onto my back and my
brakes become a testament to the power of
lubrication —once water gets between
those blocks of rubber and that metal rim,
there is no telling when and where and how
1 will come to a stop. Squeezing my brakes
with all the hand-strength a twenty-one
year old young woman can be expected to
muster. 1 still only decelerate just enough
to Flintstone-style my way to a full stop.
Not to mention the fact that biking in the
rain gets the knee-to-hip portion of my
p;ints disproportionately soaked. Perhaps
worst of all. it prevents me from wearing
these orange leather shoes that I love.
Sometimes to avoid the hassle of tain-bik
ing. 1 walk to class. In other words, I arrive
late.
But despite the trials and tribulations of
precipitation, there is really quite an upside
to rain. Although, admittedly, my class at
tendance- drops during the rainy season, my
percentage of read coursework jumps dra
matically from about a third of all assigned
pages to almost half. Additionally, spending
more time in my dorm also allows me to
forge more genuine and fulfilling bonds
with my fellow dorm mates, with whom pre
viously I had been mere acquaintances.
From spending twenty hours a day in my
dorm, 1 now know that my crazy neighbor
girl got a Chinese harpsichord for Christ
mas, and that the quad of boys below me just
hung a tiny basketball hoop on their door
and now play tiny basketball games with the
whooping enthusiasm and reckless aban
don possible only from over-competitive.
Type-A NBA enthusiasts.
Another bonus from being a rain-in
duced homebody is the housekeeping ten
dencies which naturally accompany being
confined in a small area. I vacuum frequent
ly, keep all the objects on my desk at 90 de
gree angles to one another and arrange all
the clothing items in my closet in rainbow
order. When I do my laundry, 1 fold my socks
and underwear, something I would usually
consider to be a sign of OCD or top-level
procrastination. I even line up my eye-liners
from darkest black to lightest brown and
arrange my earrings on a spectrum ranging
from most party-ready at the top to most
I'm-making-a-bohemian-statement at the

bottom. Where would a girl be without this
mid-year indoor hiatus to get organized?
Also, the rain washes my car for me.
Perhaps the greatest upside to rain, how
ever. is the exponential increase in my pop
culture and gossip quotient. After I hang up
my green corduroy jacket neatly between
my yellow wind-breaker and my blue jean
jacket and adjust my laptop so it is two inch
es away from and perfectly parallel to the
desk's edge. I surf online so long that new
stories appear on the same sites I've already
absorbed. I look up random but very press
ing questions on Wikipedia. I download
music and then check the top 100 songs
while I am at it. I also peruse the week's top
rated TV shows. And the weekend's biggest
box-office hits. And I definitely make sure I
am caught up on celebrity gossip. Why buy a
four dollar magazine when 1 can get break
ing news on JT and Cameron. Or should I
say JT and Scarlett?
Rain also allows me to follow the lives of
people with whom I actually interact. I e
mail those abroad and AIM high school
friends. I look through all the added Face
book photo albums from winter break, and
I gleefully examine updated profiles, ruth
lessly comparing I riendy McGraws new
Glamorshot picture to her "Look at me. I'm
wearing neon spandex "old one. I check and
re-check blogs—Berlin Boy is sick from
sausage, and China Chelsea is lovin' it in
Shanghai. It Santiago Sarah is going to have
a blog. however, she is going to have to up
date her pictures a little bit more frequently
because I am sick and tired of her twenty
odd blurry, from-the-bus scenery shots.
Rain does, however, make hot tea tastes
better.
Also, rain makes puddles, and I can go
splashing in the puddles with my boyfriend,
who is imaginary. So with myself. Rain al
lows me to splash in puddles, alone, while I
longingly imagine flirtatiously splashing
someone else. As I cry. Alone, in the rain.
I et's just sav I wouldn't make it in Seat
tle.

If yon, 100, like splashing in puddles, are tall,
dark handsome, like snow hoarding, long
walks on the beach, dark chocolate and curly
shoelaces, e-mail Katie at
