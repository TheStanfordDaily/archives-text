# Holiday flavored libido
## 
### 
You're going to your friend's holiday
party back home and you remind
yourself that every single party this
time of year has some kind of holiday edition
to it. The plastic cups are red. the puke is
green... it's all so very festive.
Girls wear Santa suit-type nighties to par
ties, and you are now classically conditioned
to get an erection every time you see that
fabric. This becomes embarrassing as you sit
down to watch " The Night before Christ
mas" with your cousins.
For some reason, people think pepper
mint schnapps is a festive and fun addition to
the usual regimen of alcohol. Mr. Schnapps
found that most of his profits came from this
time of year.'lTiat's why he invented eggnog
flavored schnapps as well.
People wear scarves a great deal, but it's
no longer just something to be worn outside.
Around the holidays, most of the time you
will see the scarf worn with a t-shirt. kind of
like how Tiny Tim does in "A Christmas
Carol." But then you remember that he had
some kind of terrible disease, and you won
der if your friend is trying to tell you some
thing.
Another friend wears sunglasses while
watching holiday movies because he claims
that it's too intense to stare at the whiteness
of Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and the snow
that is made of shredded war bonds as they
spontaneously tap-dance on their anti-com
munist paranoia. It's a white Christmas,
dammit, not a red one. You notice that he is
rolling the mistletoe, but you say nothing.
A lot of your holiday parties take place
back at home with your high school friends.
In addition to everything being holiday

themed. you're partying with people you
don't see on a regular basis. This presents a
double whamrny in terms of weirdness —
like all of a sudden Bizarro Superman wears
Spiderman's costume.
So you go to the only common ground
you have: you are all sexually frustrated col
lege students who watch "Arrested Develop
ment." After you've established that A) Yes
it's a great show B) Oh it's sail it's been can
celed. You still have that red cup in your hand
and view through the cigarette smoke the vi
sion of the girl/guy you had a crush on in high
school but never got the nerve to say any
thing to. Now that you've matured (i.e. dis
covered alcohol) your fears melt faster than
teenyboppers at a Fall Out Boy concert.
Dipped in molten lava. Yes.
So people get drunker because oh my lord
I haven't seen you in three years and my girl
friend is in another state and I won't see her
for weeks and well you seem like a good
enough idea for tonight.
People break up with their high school
significant others over Thanksgiving break
and then awkwardly hook up with them
over winter break. One of the two members
of the couple swears that it will work out.

baby — I'll wait for you till next break. And
by "next break" you mean in four years at
the high school reunion in the back of your
car while you peel off each other's nametags
and dignity with fake aplomb. In that way.
yes, you remain true to your high school
sweetheart.
But before that desperate vision of "Re
grettable Hookups Yet to Come," you still
have tonight. Your banter about Arrested
Development has led to an auspicious start.
But your friends knock on your door, just
when she was about to take off her gay ap
parel. Some idiot tried to smoke the mistle
toe. and so it looks like it's another trip to the
ER this holiday season. You're riding shot
gun while your best friend makes sure the
mistletoe miscreant doesn't barf all over the
backseat of your hybrid sled. If you wear mit
tens. nobody knows you're giving them the
finger.
After all the revelry, you are only left
with the realization that the weird purgato
ry that you experience when you are on
breaks will only get stranger as time goes
on. rhen all of the holiday accoutrements in
the world can't maintain the illusion. Times
are changing; high school is viewed in a frac
tured window and every day forward is the
only time you have left in college. So enjoy
the wreath-like cycles for now. because
sooner or later no matter how much pep
permint flavored Yule-tide joy you have,
your past will never look like that girl in the
Santa nightie.
