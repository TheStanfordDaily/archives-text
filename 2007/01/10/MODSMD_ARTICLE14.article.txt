### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most people like to escape to I lawaii for its warm sun, con
stant waves, amazing reefs and casual atmosphere. In the mid
dle ot the I acific Ocean, i eachablc only by a long boat or plane
ride, the islands are free from many of the problems of the
mainland.
Stanford men's volleyball coach John Kosty. however, has
been trekking to I lawaii for a different reason. After a 10-year
lapse, he has once again tapped into the vast recruiting base of
Hawaiian volleyball players.
I"he last I lawaiian players at Stanford to contribute signifi
cantly were outside hitter Mike Lambert and setter Stewart
Chong.They graduated in 1997, the year that the Cardinal men
won the only national championship in school history.

After their graduation came a long dry spell. Stanford
dropped out of the running for the national championship, fin
ishing last year with a 4-24 record, the worst in school history
However, Stanford's hard luck seemed to take a turn for the
better with the signing of current freshman outside hitter and
setter Kawika Shoji from lolani I ligh School in I lonolulu.
Kawika is the son of Dave Shoji, the famed head coach of
the I Jniversity of I lawaii's women's team. Cobey, Kawika's sis
ter, is the current Director of Volleyball Operations for the
Stanford women and played volleyball for Michigan.
Dave, himself an All-American setter at UC-Santa Barbara,
molded Kawika into a volleyball leader from the time he was a
young child.
"I le has been a good coach and a good dad," Kawika said.
"I le gives me pointers when I need them. He has been very en
couraging and positive and helpful."

Despite his volleyball pedigree. Kawika didn't devote all of
his time to volleyball. He played basketball and golf in high
school as well.
I lis mother. Mary is a former basketball player lor 1 lawaii,
and inspired Kawika's basketball game/Ilie 2006 1 lawaii flay
er of the Year in basketball, he helped lead his team to three
consecutive state championships, making five in a row for
lolani.
Any other state Player of the Year would probably be arro
gant or boastful. But Kawika insists that there were plenty of
other basketball players as good as or better than him and that
he was granted the award by default because of his team's state
championship.
"[Kawika has] a really good leadership quality,"said sopho-
