## Volleyball's island imports Freshman Shoji brings leadership, and teammates, from Hawaii to the Farm 
### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most people like to escape to I lawaii for its warm sun, con
stant waves, amazing reefs and casual atmosphere. In the mid
dle ot the I acific Ocean, i eachablc only by a long boat or plane
ride, the islands are free from many of the problems of the
mainland.
Stanford men's volleyball coach John Kosty. however, has
been trekking to I lawaii for a different reason. After a 10-year
lapse, he has once again tapped into the vast recruiting base of
Hawaiian volleyball players.
I"he last I lawaiian players at Stanford to contribute signifi
cantly were outside hitter Mike Lambert and setter Stewart
Chong.They graduated in 1997, the year that the Cardinal men
won the only national championship in school history.

After their graduation came a long dry spell. Stanford
dropped out of the running for the national championship, fin
ishing last year with a 4-24 record, the worst in school history
However, Stanford's hard luck seemed to take a turn for the
better with the signing of current freshman outside hitter and
setter Kawika Shoji from lolani I ligh School in I lonolulu.
Kawika is the son of Dave Shoji, the famed head coach of
the I Jniversity of I lawaii's women's team. Cobey, Kawika's sis
ter, is the current Director of Volleyball Operations for the
Stanford women and played volleyball for Michigan.
Dave, himself an All-American setter at UC-Santa Barbara,
molded Kawika into a volleyball leader from the time he was a
young child.
"I le has been a good coach and a good dad," Kawika said.
"I le gives me pointers when I need them. He has been very en
couraging and positive and helpful."

Despite his volleyball pedigree. Kawika didn't devote all of
his time to volleyball. He played basketball and golf in high
school as well.
I lis mother. Mary is a former basketball player lor 1 lawaii,
and inspired Kawika's basketball game/Ilie 2006 1 lawaii flay
er of the Year in basketball, he helped lead his team to three
consecutive state championships, making five in a row for
lolani.
Any other state Player of the Year would probably be arro
gant or boastful. But Kawika insists that there were plenty of
other basketball players as good as or better than him and that
he was granted the award by default because of his team's state
championship.
"[Kawika has] a really good leadership quality,"said sopho-
more middle blocker Brandon
Williams."Mven asa freshman.he re
ally takes control out on the court
and people just naturally follow him.
I le's really good at keeping the team
centered, lie knows what to say to
keep people inspired."
Kawika credits his experience in
all three sports with making him the
kind of player he is on the court.
"(iolf helped me become mental-
Is stronger for my other sports." said
Kawika. who had a 75 average and
was ranked in the top ten of his high
school league. "You need that men
tal toughness to play all sports."
Despite Stanford losing all three
of its matches at the lilephant liar
Invitational this past weekend,
Kawika proved to be a superior com
petitor and strong team leader in his
first games asa college player.
Kawika got his start as a setter at
ten years old with the Outrigger
Canoe club team, where he played

through high school. Founded and
coached by his father during the off
season of the women's college
schedule, the club became a beacon
for high level players.
Outside hitter Spencer
McLaughlin, from Punahou High
School — the same school that
Michelle Wie attends — and defen
sive specialist Jordan Inafuku from
Kamehameha High School both
played for the team. Considered by
many to be the top offensive and
defensive recruits, respectively, in
the class of 2007. both have signed
letters of intent to play for Stan
ford.
"Kawika was kind of the ring
leader of that whole group." ex
plained assistant coach Ken
Shibuya. "'lliey all know each other.
They all played together even
though they went to different high
schools... Kawika is such a charismat
ic leader. Once he made a choice to
attend school here, they all tended to
follow the leader."
"We grew up playing on the same
team." said Kawika. " Ihen in high
school, we all went to competing
schools, but in the summer we all

played again with each other on our
club team."
And soon enough, the trio will be
reunited once again for the Cardinal.
Now that Stanford has its foot in
the door. Hawaii could be a great
source for players for years to come.
Two players from the class of 2008
are already being looked at for next
year's signing period, including an
other Shoji.
Kawika's younger brother Hrik is
currently a six-foot standout at
libero for Punahou. He and lolani
outside hitter Brad Lawson. who
beat out McLaughlin for state Player
of the Year honors,are both being re
cruited heavily by all the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation schools.
Stanford included.
" Ihe thing about the I iawaii vol
leyball community is that they all
tend to follow the kids that come out
of there," continued Shibuya. "So
they all know that their kids are here
at Stanford. I except that they will
follow Stanford volleyball quite a bit
over the next couple of years.
"If Stanford has to mine in one
place, Hawaii is a pretty good place
to mine."
