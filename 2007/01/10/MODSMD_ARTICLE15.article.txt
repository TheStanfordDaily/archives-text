### BY REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Assuming a petition to the l'ac-10 is ap
proved. the wide receiving duo of Mark
Bradford and Evan Moore will be on the
field for the Cardinal once again in 2007 as
fifth-year seniors. Moore sat out the 2005
season with an injury and has one year of
eligibility left, while Bradford hopes to be
granted an extra season after being
knocked out with an injury in only the sec
ond game of 2006.
Bradford played three full seasons for
the Cardinal, including a record breaking
freshman campaign. 1 le went down with a
foot injury this season against San Jose
State on September 9. As a true freshman,
Bradford had 37 receptions for a team-high
587 yards and three touchdowns. In his ca
reer. he has 11S catches for 1789 yards and
11 touchdowns. Before focusing solely on
football. Bradford spent a season and a half
on the men's basketball team.
Bradford has submitted a medical hard
ship petition to the Conference which is ex
pected to be granted, giving him another

shot at his last year of eligibility.
"1 had an opportunity to come back and
play for Stanford University, and I couldn't
pass it up," Bradford said. "1 felt this was
the best decision for my future. I couldn't
see playing with another college team, and
I'm not ready for pro football. I'm excited
to play with my teammates for one more
season."
Like Bradford, Moore also came to
Stanford as a two-sport athlete and spent
more than a season with the basketball
team before committing himself to loot
ball. Moore was the football team's top
scorer and second receiver in 2004. but dis
located his hip in the first game of 2005 and
redshirted the season.
Though he missed some action in 2006
due to injury, Moore led the team in touch
downs and was third in receiving yards. In
his career. Moore has averaged 16.8 yards
per catch, racking up 1074 on 64 receptions,
and has amassed 11 touchdowns.
"At the end of last season, 1 wanted to
collect all my thoughts and make sure I was
doing the right thing." Moore said. "All
along I wanted to be at Stanford and with
input from coach Harbaugh and others in
the Athletic Department, it gave me a great
level of comfort in coming back for my til th
year. I still truly believe that all of my athlet
ic dreams can be accomplished at Stanford."
