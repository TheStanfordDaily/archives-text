I hope I'm wrong, but I have seri
ous doubts about whether Jim
Harbaugh is the man for the
Stanford football job.
Let me start by saying that, for
reasons both professional and per
sonal. I really hope the Harbaugh
hire works out.
First of all. I 'm a Stanford student.
I'm friends with football players,
they represent our school and 1 hope
whoever their coach is does well.
Harbaugh has a reputation for
being an offensive risk-taker — and
it's a lot more interesting to watch
the Boise State offense for instance,
than the punt, run.run. third-down
punt Walt Harris offense. I'm also
told he's friendly with the media, a
welcome change after Walt 11 arris.
Plus, Jim Harbaugh was an All-
American quarterback at Michigan
and I'm the world's biggest Michigan
fan. When I was younger. I used to
cry every time the Wolverines lost —
and. no. I'm not just writing that to
get the girls. Now. 1 get up at 9 a.m.
Pacific lime to pay $20 covers to
watch Michigan games in sports bars
— and get ridiculed for being the
only one in the room doing all the
cheers. So. suffice it to say. I've ad
mired I larbaugh for years.
However, I think Harbaugh's in
for a rude awakening at Stanford.
Start with the fact that, nothing
against I larbaugh, this team is going
to struggle against the top half of the
league next year — just like it has
since Tv Willingham left. Knute
Rockne could be the coach, but Stan
ford is still not beating USC or Notre
Dame or ( al or Oregon 0r...we11, you
get the idea. Next year's schedule is
exceptionally hard, so even three or
four wins would take some luck.
Given the struggles that the team
will inevitably face next season, Har
baugh 's youthful naivete/enthusiasm
could be a recipe for disaster. Fast
forward nine months: Stanford is 2-7
and everyone is as disenchanted as
they were at the same point in '06.
Yet Harbaugh is still getting up in
