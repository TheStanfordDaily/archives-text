I hope I'm wrong, but I have seri
ous doubts about whether Jim
Harbaugh is the man for the
Stanford football job.
Let me start by saying that, for
reasons both professional and per
sonal. I really hope the Harbaugh
hire works out.
First of all. I 'm a Stanford student.
I'm friends with football players,
they represent our school and 1 hope
whoever their coach is does well.
Harbaugh has a reputation for
being an offensive risk-taker — and
it's a lot more interesting to watch
the Boise State offense for instance,
than the punt, run.run. third-down
punt Walt Harris offense. I'm also
told he's friendly with the media, a
welcome change after Walt 11 arris.
Plus, Jim Harbaugh was an All-
American quarterback at Michigan
and I'm the world's biggest Michigan
fan. When I was younger. I used to
cry every time the Wolverines lost —
and. no. I'm not just writing that to
get the girls. Now. 1 get up at 9 a.m.
Pacific lime to pay $20 covers to
watch Michigan games in sports bars
— and get ridiculed for being the
only one in the room doing all the
cheers. So. suffice it to say. I've ad
mired I larbaugh for years.
However, I think Harbaugh's in
for a rude awakening at Stanford.
Start with the fact that, nothing
against I larbaugh, this team is going
to struggle against the top half of the
league next year — just like it has
since Tv Willingham left. Knute
Rockne could be the coach, but Stan
ford is still not beating USC or Notre
Dame or ( al or Oregon 0r...we11, you
get the idea. Next year's schedule is
exceptionally hard, so even three or
four wins would take some luck.
Given the struggles that the team
will inevitably face next season, Har
baugh 's youthful naivete/enthusiasm
could be a recipe for disaster. Fast
forward nine months: Stanford is 2-7
and everyone is as disenchanted as
they were at the same point in '06.
Yet Harbaugh is still getting up in

Analysis
press conferences and saying things
like "I vow that I will attack this en
deavor with an enthusiasm unknown
to mankind." How do you think
that's going to play?
Furthermore, Harbaugh played
for Michigan in college and very suc
cessful Ni l teams in the pros, and
then returned to coach 11-1 Univer
sity of San Diego teams. He doesn't
have a lot of experience with losing
teams, and I think it remains to be
seen how well he'll be able to shift his
attitude.
Another concern of mine is that
there's a history of yo-yo. knee-jerk
hirings here at Stanford, and Har
baugh's arrival seems to fit the mold.
TyWillingham was viewed astoo dis
ciplinarian. so Buddy Teevens was
hired (despite other shortcomings)
because he was player-friendly.
Teevens didn't win and was called

too soft and not skilled enough with
Xs and (K. so Walt 1 larris was hired
(despite other shortcomings).
Harris didn't win, and was
deemed too disciplinarian and not
confident enough personally and in
his aggressive play calling, so llar
baugh was hired, llarbaugh is not
going to win at first, and in four
years he may well be viewed as not
disciplinarian enough and lacking in
experience. And then I guess we'll
turn around and hire some cranky
old fart (I larris part II) — if we still
have a I-A football program by
then.
I just hope that llarbaugh was
hired because he was the best avail
able candidate, not because his
strengths match up well with the pre
vious coaches' perceived weakness
es.
One more concern is that llar
baugh was the best of an otherwise
underwhelming finalist pool (also in
cluding Ron Fnglish. Mike leach,
('liris Peterson, Al Borges and Norm
Chow). Being viewed as the most
qualified of the bunch is not all that

impressive.
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby
faced one of two situations, and we'll
never know which one. I - it her those
A-list guys weren't interested (as
Norm ('how said) or he was trying to
replicate the unknown rabbit-out
ol-a-hat success he had at lowa with
Kirk Ferentz.
Personally, I hope that's not the
ease.'Hie l'act that one guy reminds
him of a hire that happened to work
well somewhere else, doesn't mean
he should be chosen over better
coaches who happen to have differ
ent styles, lint I have enough faith in
liowlsby to assume that a lot of the
better coaches said no thanks.
I give the hire a B overall, but with
a caveat that I'm a lot more confi
dent in Stanford football's future
than I was before the new Athletic
Director arrived. Is there any doubt
that Harris would still be the head
coach under'led I .eland?
Time will tell, but here's hoping
llarbaugh has half as much success
at Stanford as he has had in his foot
ball career to this point.
