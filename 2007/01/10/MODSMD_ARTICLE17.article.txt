Florida's 41-14 victory over Ohio
State in Monday night's BCS Cham
pionship Game marked the end of

the 2006-2007 bowl season. With all
32 bowl games in the books, here is a
look back at how Stanford's Pacific
-10 Conference opponents fared in
their postseason contests.
No. 4 USC 32, No. 8 Michigan 18
Rose Bowl. Pasadena, Calif.
Ohio State wasn't the only high
profile Big 10 team humiliated in a

bowl game â€” Michigan couldn't
hang with the Pac-10-champion Tro
jans in the "Granddaddy of Them
All."
USC quarterback John David
Booty had a nearly flawless game
against Michigan's vaunted defense,
throwing for 391 yards, four touch
downs and no interceptions. Dwayne
Jarrett also proved he's one of the
elite wideouts in the college game,
hauling in 205 yards and two touch
downs on 11 receptions.
Surprisingly, the first half was a
defensive battle and the game went
to the break tied 3-3. But the Trojan
offense erupted moments after half
time, as Booty found Chris McFoy on
a two-yard touchdown pass to start a
31-14 Trojan run.
Both USC (11-2) and Michigan
(11 -2) were playing in the Rose Bowl
after narrowly missing out on the
BCS National Championship Game.
The Trojans fell out of the title game
after losing to UCLA in the final
week of the regular season and
Michigan finished No. 3 in the final
BCS standings, falling just short of a
rematch with conference rival Ohio
State.

back Mike Hart tojust47yardson 17
carries. It was the first time he had
fewer than 90 yards rushing all sea
son.

was the Pac-10 Offensive Player of
the Year, rushing for 111 yards and
two touchdowns as the Bears
trounced Texas A&M.
The Bears controlled the play on
both sides of the ball, outgaining
their Big 12 opponents 476-349.
The Aggies (9-4) looked like they
would have no problem with the
Bears' defense after their opening

drive, when they took the hall 61
yards on six plays for a quick touch
down. But from that point on. Cal's
defense took charge.
The Bears (10-3) limited A&M
tailback Javorskie Lane to just 36
yards on seven carries, The 274-
pound runner had set a school record
with l l > rushing touchdowns this sea
son.
Cal's offense turned it on in the
second half, outscoring the Aggies
31-0 after the break. Quarterback
Nate Longshore threw for 235 yards
and tossed one touchdown pass.
Justin Forsett supplemented Lynch s
big day on the ground with 124 yards
and a touchdown.
Cal's performance erased the
memory of the Bear's last Holiday

Bowl appearance in 2004. After
failing to qualify for the Rose Bowl
that season. Cal was crushed by
Texas Tech. 45-31, in the Holiday
Bowl.

games of the bowl season.

down reception in the final moments,
Oregon State coach Mike Reilly
opted to send the offense back out on
the field to try for the win. Tailback
Yvenson Bernard took ;i handoff up
the middle for the game-winning

score.
Missouri (K-5) led 31-21 entering
the fourth quarter, but Beavers quar
terback Matt Moore led Oregon
