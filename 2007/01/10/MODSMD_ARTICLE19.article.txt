### RACHEL KONRAD ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple Computer
CEO Steve Jobs on Tuesday announced the iPod
maker's long-awaited leap into the mobile phone
business and renamed the company just "Apple
Inc.." reflecting its increased focus on consumer
electronics.
The iPhone, which will start at when it
launches in June, is controlled by touch, plays
music, surfs the Internet and runs the Macintosh
computer operating system. Jobs said it will "rein
vent" wireless communications and "leapfrog"
past the current generation of smart phones.
"Every once in a while a revolutionary product

comes along that changes everything," he said dm
ing his keynote address at the annual Macworld
Conference and Expo. "It's very fortunate if you
can work on just one of these in your career. ...
Apple's been very fortunate in that it's introduced
a few of these."
He said the company's name change is meant
to reflect Apple's transformation from a comput
er manufacturer to a full-fledged consumer elec
tronics company.
During his speech. Jobs also unveiled a TV set
top box that allows people to send video from
their computers and announced the number of
songs sold on its 11'unes Music Store has topped 2
billion.
Apple shares jumped more than S percent on
the announcements, while the stock of rival smart
phone makers plunged. ITie run on Apple stock
created about $6 billion in shareholder wealth.
While Jobs noted the explosive growth of the
cell phone market, it's not clear that a device as al

luring as the iPhone poses a threat to mainstream
handset makers due to the price, said Avi Green
gart, mobile device analyst for the research firm
Current Analysis.
"My initial reaction is that this product actual
ly lives up to the extensive hype, and I'm not easi
ly impressed." he said. "But the vast majority of
phones sold cost way less than $500." Instead, the
rivals most likely to face new competition from
Apple's handset are makers of higher-end smart
phones such as Palm Inc.
Tim Bajarin. principal analyst with Creative
Strategies.said the iPhone could revolutionize the
way cell phones are designed and sold.
"T his goes beyond smart phones and should be
given its own category called 'brilliant' phones." he
said. "Cell phones are on track to become the
largest platform for digital music playback and
Apple needed to make this move to help defend
their iPod franchise as well as extend it beyond a
dedicated music environment."
