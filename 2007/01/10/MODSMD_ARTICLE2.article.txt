Students will no longer have an excuse for
showing up to class in a post-workout sweat,
thanks to plans for expanding the Ford Center
with lockers and showers for those using nearby
the Arrillaga Recreational Center. The 8.700

square foot expansion, approved by the Board of
Trustees in December, will also provide more
space for the gymnastics team anil four new rac
quet ball courts.

by complaints about the lack of facilities at Arril
laga.
"I don't like to use the word 'complaints;' I
prefer 'concerns,'" said Eric Stein, associate ath
letic director for physical education, recreation
