### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
Students will no longer have an excuse for
showing up to class in a post-workout sweat,
thanks to plans for expanding the Ford Center
with lockers and showers for those using nearby
the Arrillaga Recreational Center. The 8.700

square foot expansion, approved by the Board of
Trustees in December, will also provide more
space for the gymnastics team anil four new rac
quet ball courts.
The decision to expand was partly influenced
by complaints about the lack of facilities at Arril
laga.
"I don't like to use the word 'complaints;' I
prefer 'concerns,'" said Eric Stein, associate ath
letic director for physical education, recreation

year. The project will include recreational showers and lockers, in addition to gymnastics space.
and wellness. "But there was a concern to
want to provide recreational lockers and
showers for people using the recreational
center."
Stein also said that concerns about the
locker and shower facilities came more from
faculty and staff rather than students, hut he
did not have any exact numbers.
"We don't really have any estimates on
how many people have complained," he said.
The recreational showers and lockers will
be built in the space formerly occupied by the

gymnastics team, which will be rewarded
with 4.200 square feet of new showers, of
fices. lockers and storage space. Additionally,
in a move celebrated by the gymnastics de
partment. the coaches will finally be under
the same root as the team after their offices
move from Burnham Pavilion to the Ford
Center.
"It's positive for all sports." said Men's
(iymnastic C oach Thomas Glielmi. "For [the
gymnastics team) it provides much needed
office space and a more functional locker

room." The sailing team will also benefit
from the expansion,since it will be given the
space vacated by the gymnastics coaches.
"Sailing is very happy with the move to
Burnham." said Jay Kehoe, head coach of the
sailing team. "We were in Roble.and the new
location for our offices is great."
The expansion is expected to begin in
mid-May or June and to be completed by
September. Despite the project's hefty $5.7
million price tag. Deputy Athletic Director
Ray Purpur said the project is already "fully

funded."
"It is being funded by University reserves
and donors." he explained in an email to The
Daily.
With final approval for the expansion ex
pected in February and construction to begin
a few months after that, the oroject seems to
be generating much excitement among the
administration. I lowever.some students said
they are less enthusiastic about the changes.
"It doesn't really affect me one way or an
other. but it seems like there are already a lot

of workout facilities and that amount of
money could've been better used somewhere
else." said sophomore Meghan McCurdy.
"I'm skeptical,"agreed senior Matt Casel
li. "Would we have to pay for the lockers?
And as for the showers, 1 don't think 1 would
use [them]. It's easier to just shower back at
home, where I have all my toiletries anyway."
Caselli had another suggestion for the
money.
"I think they should use the money for hot
tubs."
