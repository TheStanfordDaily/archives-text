others as "those being most seriously
considered by the (selection] commit
tee."

for this month. The nine-member com
mittee tentatively hopes to select a can
didate in February, according to Ilie
Crimson.

Despite the latest
revelation, Etchemendy
continues to say publicly
that he is not interested
in the job. Etchemendy
told Ilie Daily in Sep
tember that he has "no
intention or desire to
leave my current posi
tion. which I believe is
the best position in high-

er education."
Ilie provost reiterated his position
late Tuesday night, telling The Daily that
"nothing has changed."
"There's only so many ways of saying
it."he wrote in an email, though he did
not directly respond to questions about
whether he has a scheduled interview in
Cambridge or plans to visit Boston.

"Sources close to the committee have
said that the group is not paying atten
tion to candidates' publicly stated inter
est or disinterest in the presidency." ac
cording to The Crimson.
The other three names mentioned as
finalists by the Harvard campus paper
were Radcliffe Institute Dean Drew
Gilpin Faust. I larvard I aw School Dean
Elena kagan and University of Cam
bridge leader Alison I Richard.

ered a strong candidate because of his
background as an administrator (Stan

time in academia (24 years at Stanford).

Larry Summers, a former Clinton Trea-
