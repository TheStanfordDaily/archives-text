## Rise in apps continues Single-Choice Early Action decisions sent to students; biggest applicant pool yet 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford offered 750 high school seniors reason to cele
brate (his holiday season, notifying them on Dec. 15 that their
applications to the ( lass of 2011 had been accepted.
Those students waded through a crowded Single-Choice
Early Application (SCEA) pool of 4,h44. Dean of Admis
sions and Financial Aid Richard Shaw said that this fall's
early applicant pool, as in past years, was very strong.
"I'm extraordinarily happy about the 750 students we've
offered a position to," he said.
The SCEA program, which is in its fourth year, is a non
binding option that allows students, even if accepted, to appl)
to other schools for regular review. While they have an earli
er application deadline, they are notified of admission deci
sions in mid-December instead of early April.
Hie 4,044 applications for early admission were up three
percent from last year, and the size of the pool may be the
highest in the nation for selective universities, Shaw said.
While just over 16 percent of early applicants were accept
ed. about 20 percent were deferred to be evaluated again in

the
regular rc
view cycle.

liarly admission pro
mams have come under scrutiny

recently, as both Harvard and Princeton

announced in September that they were eliminat
ing their early options.
However, since Harvard and Princeton's changes do not
take effect until next year. Shaw said that it was unlikely that
these changes had any effect on this year's increase in early
applications.
"1 think we're just up. frankly, and that's a reflection that
Stanford is on people's radar screens," he said. "I think next
year will be the more interesting year."
Yale joined Stanford and MIT on Thursday with its an
nouncement that it would continue its early action program.
Because an estimated 70 percent of admission offers will
be made during the Regular Decision cycle, in which appli
cants are notified in early April, "we have a significant
amount of space remaining to try to manage the rest of the
applicant pool," Shaw said.
Ile estimated that applications for the Class of 2011 likely
exceeded 24,000, an increase from the 22,333 applications his
office received last year.
All admitted students have until May 1 to decide whether

to commit to Stanford.
Shaw said that in looking at data
from past years, he expects about 88
percent of students admitted early
to matriculate at Stanford.
Jocelyne Francis, a Park Senior
High School student from Liv
ingston. Mont., said that while Stan
ford wasn't initially her first choice,
the University's nonbinding early
program, unique among the schools
she was considering, motivated her
to apply early.
"My early admittance to Stan
lord has caused me to be much more
likely to actually attend," she said.
Because SCEA is nonbinding,"it
makes a decision you're making so
early your senior year a little less
scary," said Amie Nguyen, an ac
cepted student at Los Angeles'

Mil a Costa High School.
With her acceptance, Nguyen
lias the best of both worlds.
"Now I'm free from all the stress
and pressure everyone else is feel
ing." she said.
While the SCEA program re
mains the same, the admissions of
fice has improved its review
process. Last year, Stanford
switched from a more vertical re
view system to a committee system,
in which "staff are very engaged in
advocating for and representing
students and being part of the deci
sion process," Shaw said, adding
that the office's second year of re
view by committee worked extraor
dinarily well.
"We're pleased to have gone into
this cycle with a l ull staff," he added.
"We felt very comfortable with the
review and did it in a very timely
way. Again this year we notified stu
dents through the World Wide Web
and there were no glitches; every
thing was quite smooth."
