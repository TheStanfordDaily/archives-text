## Eating disorder sites increase symptoms School of Medicine study shows effects of pro-anorexia Web sites 
### KAT LEWIN STAFF WRITER 
"I used to receive flattering comments about my
appearance, but it has been a while since anyone ex
pressed positive remarks about my looks." writes the
author of pro-eating disorder Web site Pro-Ana Na
tion. "I no longer care whether men find me attrac
tive or not. It is completely irrelevant. I fear intima
cy. probably because I constantly feel fat and de
pressed."
Web sites like this were recently under the scruti-
lly of a major new study by re
searchers at the Stanford University
School of Medicine and Lucille
Packard Children's Hospital. Med
ical Student Jenny Wilson and Lu
cille Packard Children's Hospital's
Adolescent Medicine and bating
Disorder Specialist Dr. Rebecka
Peebles, recently co-authored two
studies about eating disorders. The
first examined usage of eating disor
der-related Web sites by patients,
and the second compared eating
disorders among pre-adolescent
and adolescent patients treated at
Stanford facilities.
The first study."Surfing for thin
ness: a pilot study of pro-eating dis
order Web site usage in adolescents
with eating disorders." was pub
lished in the December issue of Pe
diatries. In this study, Wilson and
Peebles distributed anonymous sur-

veys to I Oh parents and 76 patients
who had been diagnosed with an
eating disorder at Packard Chil
dren's Hospital from IW7 to 2004.
I'he surveys asked about the child's
health, eating disorder and usage of
pro-eating disorder and pro-recov
ery Web sites.
" These Web sites were pretty
commonly used among the pa
tients," Wilson said. "Thirty-six per
cent of patients who responded had
visited the pro-eating disorder Web
sites. What we didn't expect was that
there was a big overlap in people
who have used pro-eating disorder
and pro-recovery websites — 25
percent had visited both."
According to Wilson, there is
some intersection between the con
tents of these types of sites. Pro-re
covery sites, such as something
fishy.org. contain resources like chat
rooms, advice on seeking treatment
and shared eating disorder experi
ences. which are also common fea
tures of pro-eating disorder Web
sites. A major distinction is that pro
recovery Web sites censor informa

tit>ll which might trigger negative be
haviors in people struggling with eat
ing disorders, such as specific infor
mation about purging or exercising.
Sophomore Aluma Dembo said
she felt that such sites present a risk
for people with eating disorders.
"I know that many times on
these sites girls will post their
weights and calorie intake, which
causes other girls struggling with
their own problems to start compar
ing their weight and calorie intake."
she explained. "There are also tips
on laxative abuse and obsessive ex
ercising. What also often time hap
pens is that forums meant to pro
vide support end up tilled with tips
on starvation and purging, which
can be a trigger."
The study showed that 96 per
cent of patients who visited pro-eat
ing disorder sites learned new diet
ing or purging techniques and
percent of users learned similar
techniques on pro-recovery sites.
Patients who admitted using pro
eating disorder sites also demon
strate greater length of sickness and

reported spending less time on their
schoolwork than non-users — both
are possible quality of life indica
tors, Wilson said.
Parental awareness of these Web
sites was another key factor to the
study. According to the study. 53
percent of parents were aware of
pro-eating disorder Web sites, but
52 percent did not know whether
their children had visited the sites.
" lliis is one of the first studies of
its kind." Wilson said. "Nobody else
has really looked at health outcomes
in relation to eating disorder Web
sites. ()ne tiling that this study does is
introduce these sites to pediatricians
who may not be aware of them. It
opens up the field for more re
search."
Hie second study co-authored by
Wilson and Peebles. "How do chil
dren with eating disorders differ
from adolescents with eating disor
ders at initial evaluation?" was pub
lished in the Adolescent
Health this December. In this study,
researchers compared the charts of
959 patients diagnosed with an eat

ing disorder at Packard C hildren s
Hospital between IIW7l l W7 and 2005. Of
these patients, I0 l > were under the
age of 13, making this one of the
largest-scale surveys ol pre-adoles
cent eating disorders ever attempt
ed. according to Wilson.
Although females made up the
majority of both groups, researchers
found that males made up a larger
percentage of the younger group
than their elder counterparts.
Younger patients were also less
likely to be diagnosed with bulimia
nervosa or to display hinging or
purging behaviors. These pre-ado
lescent patients also tended lo be at
a lower percentage of their ideal
body weights than older patients,
yet in most cases had been sick for
shorter periods of time.
"Younger children should not
only not be losing weight, but gain
ing weight at a faster pace than ado
lescents," Wilson said.
Some students agree that the low
ages at which some children present
eating disorders are a cultural concern.
"Children should eat as much as

possible without the worry that they
are fat." said sophomore Wilson Ve
lasco. "They should not be thinking
about choosing a lifestyle that in
cludes eating disorders. The (act
that culture has brought under-aged
people to have eating disorders is
horrendous."
Wilson expressed hope that this
study would shed light on the issue
of eating disorders among both ado
lescents and pre-adolescents.
"Hopefully this study increases
awareness, because younger patients
with eating disorders may not be rec
ognized by physicians," she said.
"Younger patients present [their dis
orders) in an unusual way. lor exam
ple. they may deny they want to lose
weight or even say they are too thin.
These younger patients in our study
were losing weight quickly, at a time
when they really need to be gaining
weight to develop to their full height
and gain bone density. It's important
to pick these eating disorders up and
recognize that just because these pa
tients are young, they are not neces
sarily less sick."

cy. probably because I constantly feel fat and de
pressed."
Web sites like this were recently under the scruti-
lly of a major new study by re
searchers at the Stanford University
School of Medicine and Lucille
Packard Children's Hospital. Med
ical Student Jenny Wilson and Lu
cille Packard Children's Hospital's
Adolescent Medicine and bating
Disorder Specialist Dr. Rebecka
Peebles, recently co-authored two
studies about eating disorders. The
first examined usage of eating disor
der-related Web sites by patients,
and the second compared eating
disorders among pre-adolescent
and adolescent patients treated at
Stanford facilities.
The first study."Surfing for thin
ness: a pilot study of pro-eating dis
order Web site usage in adolescents
with eating disorders." was pub
lished in the December issue of Pe
diatries. In this study, Wilson and
Peebles distributed anonymous sur-

veys to I Oh parents and 76 patients
who had been diagnosed with an
eating disorder at Packard Chil
dren's Hospital from IW7 to 2004.
I'he surveys asked about the child's
health, eating disorder and usage of
pro-eating disorder and pro-recov
ery Web sites.
" These Web sites were pretty
commonly used among the pa
tients," Wilson said. "Thirty-six per
cent of patients who responded had
visited the pro-eating disorder Web
sites. What we didn't expect was that
there was a big overlap in people
who have used pro-eating disorder
and pro-recovery websites — 25
percent had visited both."
According to Wilson, there is
some intersection between the con
tents of these types of sites. Pro-re
covery sites, such as something
fishy.org. contain resources like chat
rooms, advice on seeking treatment
and shared eating disorder experi
ences. which are also common fea
tures of pro-eating disorder Web
sites. A major distinction is that pro
recovery Web sites censor informa

tit>ll which might trigger negative be
haviors in people struggling with eat
ing disorders, such as specific infor
mation about purging or exercising.
Sophomore Aluma Dembo said
she felt that such sites present a risk
for people with eating disorders.
"I know that many times on
these sites girls will post their
weights and calorie intake, which
causes other girls struggling with
their own problems to start compar
ing their weight and calorie intake."
she explained. "There are also tips
on laxative abuse and obsessive ex
ercising. What also often time hap
pens is that forums meant to pro
vide support end up tilled with tips
on starvation and purging, which
can be a trigger."
The study showed that 96 per
cent of patients who visited pro-eat
ing disorder sites learned new diet
ing or purging techniques and
percent of users learned similar
techniques on pro-recovery sites.
Patients who admitted using pro
eating disorder sites also demon
strate greater length of sickness and

reported spending less time on their
schoolwork than non-users — both
are possible quality of life indica
tors, Wilson said.
Parental awareness of these Web
sites was another key factor to the
study. According to the study. 53
percent of parents were aware of
pro-eating disorder Web sites, but
52 percent did not know whether
their children had visited the sites.
" lliis is one of the first studies of
its kind." Wilson said. "Nobody else
has really looked at health outcomes
in relation to eating disorder Web
sites. ()ne tiling that this study does is
introduce these sites to pediatricians
who may not be aware of them. It
opens up the field for more re
search."
Hie second study co-authored by
Wilson and Peebles. "How do chil
dren with eating disorders differ
from adolescents with eating disor
ders at initial evaluation?" was pub
lished in the Adolescent
Health this December. In this study,
researchers compared the charts of
959 patients diagnosed with an eat

ing disorder at Packard C hildren s
Hospital between IIW7l l W7 and 2005. Of
these patients, I0 l > were under the
age of 13, making this one of the
largest-scale surveys ol pre-adoles
cent eating disorders ever attempt
ed. according to Wilson.
Although females made up the
majority of both groups, researchers
found that males made up a larger
percentage of the younger group
than their elder counterparts.
Younger patients were also less
likely to be diagnosed with bulimia
nervosa or to display hinging or
purging behaviors. These pre-ado
lescent patients also tended lo be at
a lower percentage of their ideal
body weights than older patients,
yet in most cases had been sick for
shorter periods of time.
"Younger children should not
only not be losing weight, but gain
ing weight at a faster pace than ado
lescents," Wilson said.
Some students agree that the low
ages at which some children present
eating disorders are a cultural concern.
"Children should eat as much as

possible without the worry that they
are fat." said sophomore Wilson Ve
lasco. "They should not be thinking
about choosing a lifestyle that in
cludes eating disorders. The (act
that culture has brought under-aged
people to have eating disorders is
horrendous."
Wilson expressed hope that this
study would shed light on the issue
of eating disorders among both ado
lescents and pre-adolescents.
"Hopefully this study increases
awareness, because younger patients
with eating disorders may not be rec
ognized by physicians," she said.
"Younger patients present [their dis
orders) in an unusual way. lor exam
ple. they may deny they want to lose
weight or even say they are too thin.
These younger patients in our study
were losing weight quickly, at a time
when they really need to be gaining
weight to develop to their full height
and gain bone density. It's important
to pick these eating disorders up and
recognize that just because these pa
tients are young, they are not neces
sarily less sick."
