# E. coli travels to outer space
## NASA Ames and Stanford collaborate to study DNA 
### ANDREW VALENCIA 
Three months after I . ct>li made national
headlines for infecting more than two hun
dred people through hags of fresh spinach, the
bacteria has a surprisingly new. benign desti
nation: outer space. Stanford, in collaboration
with several other California universities, is
assisting NASA in developing an experiment
to use E. coli bacteria to test the effects of
space on living organisms.
The project, which has been dubbed Gene-
Sat-1. has involved the launching of a new
non-harmful strain of I coli bacteria into
orbit in an attempt to observe the impact that
zero gravity and space radiation have on the
I )NA of living organisms. By studying the data
that is being transmitted to Fiarth from the

shoebox-sized project satellite, the GeneSat-1
team believes that the mission could offer in
sight into the health risks of prolonged
manned space missions. Spearheading the
GeneSat-1 mission is a host of' Stanford-affil
iated technologists and NASA researchers.
" The coolest part of the mission is that the
idea came from a Stanford alumnus, John
I lines." said I lectrical Engineering Prof. Gre
gory Kovacs, whose lab serves as the center
point for the University's involvement in the
project.

Biomolecular Systems Research Program
(BSRP) and the manager of the Astrobionics

ter. credits the development of the project to
over five years of research, planning and coop
eration between NASA and Stanford technol
ogists.

Greg Kovacs, Stanford's lead collaborator on the NASA Ames space biology
mission, in zero-g with his own collection of E. coli
ideas of using satellites and micro
technology for biological experi
ments," Mines said.
According to Kovacs, E. coli
bacteria were chosen for the space
experiment because their short
lifecycles allow for numerous gen
erations to be observed over the
course of just a year, and because
the bacteria can be put into a se
quence of hibernation in the event
of unexpected launch delays.
While traveling through Earth's
orbit, the satellite will maintain a
scientifically precise living environ
ment for the bacteria by maintain
ing a constant temperature and dis
posing of the waste products the
bacteria produce. Then, once a day,
the data the satellite collects from
the E. coli is transmitted back to
Earth, where it will be accessible to
NASA researchers, Stanford tech
nologists and several observers lis
tening to the transmissions using
ham radio equipment.
Antonio Ricco. chief technolo
gist for the NASA Astrobionics
Program and GeneSat-1 program
architect, stressed the importance
of the project's pioneering techno

logical aspects and said he believes
that the mission itself should be
viewed primarily as a technology
demonstration rather than as a sim
ple biological experiment. If Gene-
Sat-1 goes well, it is possible it
could be the first in a long line of
such missions utilizing smaller,
light-weight satellites for scientific
purposes.
"What we believe this mission
will do is allow us to do a lot more
space biology missions at lower
cost," Ricco said.
When it comes to launching new
satellites into space, Kovacs claims
NASA generally favors heavier
models. The GeneSat-1 project
satellite, which weighs only ten
pounds, is itself testing the merits of
lighter weight satellites. At the end
of the mission, when the satellite
reenters Earth's orbit, NASA will
have greater knowledge of the ef
fects of space on living organisms,
as well as new information on the
performance of smaller satellites in
low-orbit scientific experiments.
Santa Clara University, San Jose
State University and the California
Polytechnic State University-San
Luis Obispo also contributed to the
development of the GeneSat-1 mis
sion. The satellite was launched
into orbit on Dec. 16 from the
NASA Wallops Flight Facility in
Virginia.
