# E. coli travels to outer space
## NASA Ames and Stanford collaborate to study DNA 
### ANDREW VALENCIA 
Three months after I . ct>li made national
headlines for infecting more than two hun
dred people through hags of fresh spinach, the
bacteria has a surprisingly new. benign desti
nation: outer space. Stanford, in collaboration
with several other California universities, is
assisting NASA in developing an experiment
to use E. coli bacteria to test the effects of
space on living organisms.
The project, which has been dubbed Gene-
Sat-1. has involved the launching of a new
non-harmful strain of I coli bacteria into
orbit in an attempt to observe the impact that
zero gravity and space radiation have on the
I )NA of living organisms. By studying the data
that is being transmitted to Fiarth from the

shoebox-sized project satellite, the GeneSat-1
team believes that the mission could offer in
sight into the health risks of prolonged
manned space missions. Spearheading the
GeneSat-1 mission is a host of' Stanford-affil
iated technologists and NASA researchers.
" The coolest part of the mission is that the
idea came from a Stanford alumnus, John
I lines." said I lectrical Engineering Prof. Gre
gory Kovacs, whose lab serves as the center
point for the University's involvement in the
project.

Biomolecular Systems Research Program
(BSRP) and the manager of the Astrobionics

over five years of research, planning and coop
eration between NASA and Stanford technol
ogists.
