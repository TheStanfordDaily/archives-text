### LOLITA C. BALDOR ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHING I ON (AP) - The first of up to 20,000
additional U.S. troops will move into Iraq by
month's end under President Bush's new war
plan, a senior defense official said Tuesday. I louse
Speaker Nancy Pelosi pledged to hold a vote on
the increase, which many Democrats oppose.
Details of a gradual military buildup emerged
a da\ before Bush's planned speech to the nation,
in which he also will propose a bit over $1 billion
to shore up the country's battered economy and
create jobs, said a second U.S. official.
Bush is expected to urge friendly Mideast
countries to increase their aid to Iraq but will ig
nore the recommendation of the bipartisan Iraq
Stud\ group that he include Syria and Iran in an
effort to staunch Iraqi bloodshed nearly four
years after the U.S. invasion, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the
plan has not yet been announced.
Bush is expected to link the troop increase to
promised steps by the Iraqi government to build
up its own military, ease the country's murderous
sectarian tensions, increase reconstruction and
enact a plan to distribute oil revenues among the
country's religious sects.
I.ven before he delivers his speech. Bush's
plan has drawn sharp criticism from the leaders of
the new. Democratic-controlled Congress. Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid said he hoped for a
bipartisan measure that would declare."We don't
support this escalation of the war." It it passes,
"the president's going to have to take note of

that. 1 think that's the beginning of the end, as far
as I'm concerned." he said.
Jennifer ('rider, a spokeswoman for Pelosi,
said Tuesday night, "The I louse will vote on the
president s proposal." She said she had no details.
Hie president met during the day with law
makers. practiced his speech and briefed key for
eign allies, including calls to the leaders of Britain,
Australia and Denmark. Bush was expected to
practice his speech a couple of more times before
addressing the nation at ( ) p.m. EST Wednesday
from the White House Library.
Under Bush's plan, thousands of troops will be
alerted that they may be needed in Iraq — in
cluding units already there whose service would
be extended, or others that could be sent earlier
than initially scheduled, said one official.
Moving first into Iraq would be the 2nd
Brigade. 82nd Airborne Division, which is now in
Kuwait and poised to head quickly into the coun
try, the defense official said. Hie brigade, number
ing about 3,500 troops, is based at Fort Bragg,
N.C.
Other units, including Marine brigades in

western Iraq, could he asked to extend their de
ployment. And the military buildup is also likely
to include moving the aircraft carrier USS John
C. Stennis into the Persian Gulf region, as a show
of force and a warning to Iran and Syria.
There are already about 132.000 U.S. troops in
Iraq.
According to the defense official. Bush also
will discuss the need to address how often the
Pentagon can tap the National Guard and Re
serves, although he may provide few details. And
Bush will again endorse the need to increase the
size of the Army and Marine Corps.
The speech looms as a key one for Bush, who
is beginning the final two years of his presidency
waging a war that has scant public support and
whose own popularity has plummeted as well.
The public has heard several previous cam
paigns by Bush to defend his Iraq policies and show
that he is changing with changing circumstances.
Since the war's start in March 2(X)3. there have been
at least seven public relations offensives by Bush on
the war. with some of these speech series timed to
milestone events and others to dips in polls.
