## Congress passes new anti-terror legislation Democrats open with legislative sprint 
### DAVID ESPO ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Anti-terror
legislation sailed through the House
on Tuesday, the first in a string of
measures designed to fulfill campaign
promises made by Democrats last tall.
Patterned on recommendations
of the commission that investigated
the Sept. 11 attacks, the far-reaching
measure includes commitments for
inspection of all cargo carried aboard
passenger aircraft and on ships
hound for the United States
'ITie vote was a bipartisan 2 l ) l )-128.
and Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the
rostrum to announce the passage of
the first legislation to clear under the
new Democratic majority.
Democrats said the bill's passage
was a top priority.
"Our first and highest duty as
members of this Congress is to pro
tect the American people, to defend
our homeland and to strengthen our
national security."' said Majority
Leader Steny Hoyer. D-Nld.
Several Republicans criticized
the legislation as little more than po
litical posturing in the early hours ot
a new Democratic-controlled Con
gress. Democrats want to "look ag
gressive on homeland security. ITiis
bill will waste billions of dollars, and
possibly harm homeland security by
gumming up progress already under
way." said Rep. Hal Rogers. R-ky.
In a written statement, the Bush

administration listed several objec
tions and said it could not support
the measure as drafted, but stopped
short of a veto threat.
Democrats have pledged to make
fiscal responsibility a priority in the
new Congress, but they advanced the
bill — their first of the year — with
out even a bare-bones accounting of
the estimated cost. The funding will
require follow-up legislation.
Legislation introduced in the Sen
ate a year ago to implement the rec
ommendations of the 9/11 commis
sion had a price tag of more than $53
billion over five years.
The terrorism legislation is the
first of six measures the House is ex
pected to pass in its first 100 hours in
session under Democratic control.
Next up is an increase in the mini
mum wage — set for passage on
Wednesday — followed by relaxation
of the limits on stem cell research con
ducted with federal funds and a meas
ure directing the administration to ne
gotiate with drug companies for lower
prices for Medicare recipients.
Next week, the Democrats intend
to clear legislation to cut the interest
rate on student loans and to curtail
tax breaks for the energy industry.
Each of the six bills would go to
the Senate,and it could be months —
if then — before they reach the
White House.
Already, President Bush has sig
naled he would veto the stem cell
bill, which is opposed by abortion
foes. House supporters of the meas
ure conceded at a news conference
during the day that they do not have
the two-thirds support needed to
override a veto.
