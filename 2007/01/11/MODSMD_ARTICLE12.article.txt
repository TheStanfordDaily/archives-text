## KZSU celebrates 60 years The 						student-run station airs the ups and downs of its lifetime 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA 
k/.SI celebrated its sixtieth anniversary last week
with a 60-hour marathon and reflected on the campus
radio station's trials and tribulations.
To celebrate its 60 years on the airwaves. KZSU
kicked off a 60-hour marathon on the morning of Jan.
4. Each hour corresponded to a year that the station
has broadcast, and during that hour, only music that
was released during that year could be played. During
the first hour — representing the year 1947 — the
deejay played "In the Still of the Night" by Jo Stafford
and "Blue Moon" by Billy Hckstine. Then, for the last
hour, deejays spun songs like "Song for Sunshine" by
Belle and Sebastian.
Aside from offering a chance to play an eclectic mix
of tunes, the anniversary also gave past and present dee
jays a chance to reflect on the station's ups and downs.
KZSU deejays said they were proud of the role it played
throughout the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989.
"KZSU stayed on the air throughout the crisis, and
worked with emergency services to bring essential in
formation to the Stanford campus and the surround
ing community," said KZSU General Manager
Kathryn Todd, a graduate student in physics.
The station has also encountered its share of obsta
cles along the way. Funding is a constant problem for
KZSU — the station actually invented the Special Fee

Funding option that the ASSU runs. KZSU officials
said competition for this funding is steep.
"We use this money to pay a part-time profession
al engineer to keep the station running in compliance
with FCC regulations and to maintain our equip
ment," Todd said. "One year we lost this funding, and
it was a real struggle to keep the station running."
The station needs a steady flow of cash to replace,
repair and maintain pieces of equipment, as well as pay
for the rather large phone bill due that accumulates
from the good number of listeners who call in. The
University's support for KZSU has waned in the years
since Donald Kennedy's presidency, officials added.
The station first benan broadcasting in 1941, but

America's entry into World War 11 led K.ZSU to halt its
programming until January 1947. It originally began as
an AM station, but in 1%4. it finally got a license to
broadcast over the I M network. On April 6.1947, the
station began broadcasting from the studio in the
basement of Memorial Auditorium, where it continues
to operate today.
For the anniversary celebration, 32 alumni returned
to campus to participated in the live broadcast. The
founding engineer. Fred W.Terman.even attended the
marathon.
k/.SU Promotions Director Adrian Bischoff said
he was happy with the celebration.
"I have to say," he said,"l think it was a total success."
