### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Cimex lectularius, more commonly known as bedbugs,
was confirmed plaguing three residences in the tall Alon
dra. Granada and one Rains apartment. Stanford Student
Housing is on a mission to inform students about these
blood-feeding insects and has kicked ot! a comprehensive
educational program about bedbug precautions and identifi
cations.
"Since bedbugs are a worldwide issue that is showing signs
of continuing growth, we want students to be aware of the
overall problem and how they can help protect themselves
and Stanford." said Associate Director of Student Housing
for Operations Imogen Hinds. "This phenomenon is occur
ring at most Universities around the country where students
come and go and live in close-knit communities and share
quarters."
Student 1 lousing serves about 12,500 student residents in
over 350 buildings. Even though the impact bedbugs are hav
ing at Stanford remains very small. Executive Director
Rodger Whitney said Student Housing takes each case seri
ously and works on containment quickly.
"The three cases that we have experienced this year are
the norm for the past three to four years and is very much in
line with other like-Universities around the country." Whit
ney said.
During winter break. Crane Pest Control inspected all
rooms in Florence Moore and Granada. No bedbugs or new
infestations were found.
"As an added precautionary measure, we plan on follow
ing up these inspections again within the next several weeks,
due to the bedbug life cycle," Hinds noted. "All areas where
we had incurred an infestation were handled per our pest con
trol methods which enabled us to move students that needed
to move-out over break to return to
their residence."
The one Rains apartment was a
relatively low-grade case which is
being addressed by standard proto
cols and affects only one student.

Universities and new pest inspection

of their residences.
Bedbugs are a "growing, world
wide problem brought about by in
creased travel and decreased use of
pesticides." according to the site.
"Although bedbugs are consid
ered a nuisance bug and don't carry
any disease, they can have a notice
able impact on those who come in
contact with them." said Whitney.'it
is very important that all do take
steps to decrease their risk of being

exposed to bedbugs and carrying
them into our residences. Since we
live in such a very tight community, if
bedbugs are introduced in our resi
dences. it is likely that more than just
that one resident could have to deal
with the situation."
Whitney stated that most bed
bugs are introduced into residences
by people unknowingly carrying
them into buildings.
"If we can help educate all those
that live in our housing about how to
identify bedbugs, how to avoid bed
bugs and how to report early any
possible problems with bedbugs, we
can help control the problem and re
duce the incidents and ideally elimi
nate it for our students and for our
graduate and undergraduate resi
dences." Whitney said.
For more information regarding
bedbugs, students should go to the
Web site,

their housing supervisor or student
housing associate in their campus
residential area. Whitney and Hinds
said.
