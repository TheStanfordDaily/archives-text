# STUDENT INITIATED COURSES
## New Basque Studies class elicits strong support Etchemendy and Arillaga are among students 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Senior Casey Nevitt's dream of start
ing a Basque Studies class on the Quad
was realized Wednesday when almost 30
people crammed into a classroom for the
first session of her student initiated
course.
"It's been a work in progress since last
school year," she said. "There's been so
much support."
Of course, it helps when the Universi
ty's chief academic officer and its top
donor both trace their roots to the rela
tively small region in northern Spain, one

of 17 autonomous states in the European
country.
"It's about time," said Provost John
Etchemendy. who could not recall a
Basque Studies course since he lirst came
to Stanford in l l )7h.
Billionaire construction magnate John
Arrillaga is one of the "students" taking
the course. 1 le said his father was con
ceived in Spain and remembered playing
basketball in Bilbao in 1%().
"We have nine sessions in which we are
going to try and cover thousands of years
of history, culture and identity," said
course instructor Gloria Totoricaguena.
"Basque culture is not monolithic. It is
very heterogeneous."
Totoricaguena is the director of the
Center for Basque Studies at the Univer
sity of Nevada, Reno. The preeminent
Basque scholar will fly in Wednesday af

ternoons to lecture.
Students said they enrolled in the
course for a variety of reasons. Some visit
ed Spain and fell in love with the culture.
One student said she was taking the
course because her boyfriend is from the
Basque region. A Human Biology major
said she dreamed of one day living in
Spain.
"I wanted to learn about Basque cul
ture beyond what's on Wikipedia," said
senior Ash Siddiqui, who is studying math
and computational studies.
'Through the hour-and-a-half meeting,
Totoricaguena offered an executive sum
mary of her survey class. Using vivid, high
resolution photos in a PowerPoint, she
previewed what will be covered each
week.
She noted that women traditionally
dominate the Basque family unit and cited

recent archaeological discoveries of entire
towns in the region, which she described as
"absolutely incredible."
The class will learn three traditional
Basque folk dances one week and will
make a field trip to a high-end restaurant
another. Totoricaguena also plans to delve
into what motivates the Euskadi Ta
Askatasuna (ETA), a terrorist group that
strives for an autonomous, socialist
Basque state.
After class, in a corner of the room.
Nevitt sold the books that will be refer
enced through the quarter. With a Basque
flag hanging behind her. she assured her
peers that the books were the best deal
she could find. She bought them used on
Amazon, she said, and was selling them at
cost.
Arrillaga was the first in line to buy the
texts, with cash in hand.
