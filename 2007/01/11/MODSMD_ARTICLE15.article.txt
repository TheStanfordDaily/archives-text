## Bush to boost number of U.S. troops in Iraq President draws five from both parties and protestors 
### TERENCE HUNT ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush acknowledged for the first time
Wednesday that he erred by not ordering a
military buildup in Iraq last year and said
he was increasing U.S. troops by 21.500 to
quell the country's near-anarchy. "Where
mistakes have been made, the responsibil
ity rests with me." Bush said.
The buildup puts Bush on a collision
course with the new Democratic Congress
and pushes the American troop presence
in Iraq toward its highest level. It also runs
counter to widespread anti-war passions
among Americans and the advice of some
top generals.
In a prime-time address to the nation.
Bush pushed back against the Democrats'
calls to end the unpopular war. He said
that "to step back now would force a col
lapse of the Iraqi government, tear that
country apart and result in mass killings on
an unimaginable scale.
"If we increase our support at this cru
cial moment and help the Iraqis break the
current cycle of violence, we can hasten the
day our troops begin coming home," Bush

said. But he braced Americans to expect
more U.S. casualties for now and did not
specify how long the additional troops
would stay.
In addition to extra U.S. forces, the plan
envisions Iraq's committing 10.000 to
12,000 more troops to secure Baghdad's
neighborhoods — and taking the lead in
military operations.
Kven before Bush's address, the new
Democratic leaders of Congress empha
sized their opposition to a buildup. "This is
the third time we arc going down this path.
Two times this has not worked," House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said after
meeting with the president. "Why are they
doing this now? That question remains."
I "here was criticism from Republicans.

ed strategy that will drive America deeper
into an unwinnable swamp at a great cost."
s;iid Sen. Chuck I lagel. R-Neb., a Vietnam
veteran and potential GOP presidential
candidate.
After nearly four years of bloody com
bat. the speech was perhaps Bush's hist
credible chance to try to present a winning
strategy in Iraq and persuade Americans
to change their minds about the unpopular
war. which has cost the lives of more than
3.000 members of the U.S. military as well
as more than $400 billion.
Senate and House Democrats are ar
ranging votes urging the president not to

send more troops. While lacking the force
of law. the measures would compel Repub
licans to go on record as either bucking the
president or supporting an escalation.
Usually loath to admit error. Bush said
it also was a mistake to have allowed
American forces to be restricted by the
Iraqi government, which tried to prevent
U.S. military operations against fighters
controlled by the radical Shiite cleric Muq
tada al-Sadr, a powerful political ally of
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.The presi
dent said al-Maliki had assured him that
from now on, "political or sectarian inter
ference will not be tolerated."
As Bush spoke for 20 minutes from the
unusual setting of the White I louse library,
the sounds of protesters amassed outside

the compound's gates occasionally filtered
through.
Bush's approach amounts to a huge
gamble on al-Maliki's willingness — and
ability — to deliver on promises he has
consistently failed to keep: to disband Shi
ite militias, pursue national reconciliation
and make good on commitments for Iraqi
forces to handle security operations in
Baghdad.
"Our past efforts to secure Baghdad
failed for two principal reasons: There
were not enough Iraqi and American
troops to secure neighborhoods that had
been cleared of terrorists and insurgents."
the president said. "And there were too

many restrictions on the troops we
did have."
He said American commanders
have reviewed the Iraqi plan "to en
sure that it addressed these mis
takes."
With Americans overwhelmingly
unhappy with his Iraq strategy. Bush
said it was a legitimate question to
ask why this strategy to secure Bagh
dad will succeed where other opera
tions failed. "This time we will have
the force levels we need to hold the
areas that have been cleared." the
president said.
While Bush put the onus on the
Iraqis to meet their responsibilities
and commit more troops, he did not
threaten specific consequences it
they do not. Iraq has missed previous
self-imposed timetables for taking
over security responsibilities.
Bush, however, cited the govern
ment's latest optimistic estimate."To
establish its authority, the Iraqi gov
ernment plans to take responsibility
for security in all of Iraq's provinces
by November "the president said.
Still, Bush said that "America's
commitment is not open-ended. If
the Iraqi government does not fol
low through on its promises, it will
lose the support of the American
people and it will lose the support of
the Iraqi people. Now is the time to
at."
Resisting calls for troop reduc
tions, Bush said that "failure in Iraq
would be a disaster for the United
States.... A democratic Iraq will not
be perfect. But it will be a country
that fights terrorists instead of har
boring them."
But Bush warned that the strate
gy would, in a short term he did not
define, bring more violence rather
than less.
"Even if our new strategy works
exactly as planned, deadly acts of vi

olence will continue.and we must ex
pect more Iraqi and American casu
alties," he said. "The question is
whether our new strategy will bring
us closer to success. 1 believe that it
will."
Bush's warning was echoed by
Sen. John McCain. R-Ariz..a leading
proponent of a troop increase. "Is it
going to be a strain on the military?
Absolutely. Casualties are going to
go up," the senator said.
Bush said he considered calls
from Democrats and some Republi
cans to pull back American forces.
He concluded it would devastate
Iraq and "result in our troops being
forced to stay even longer."
But he offered a concession to
Congress — the establishment of a
bipartisan working group to formal
ize regular consultations on Iraq. I le
said he was open to future exchanges
and better ideas.
Bush's strategy ignored key rec
ommendations of the Iraq Study
Group, which in December called
for a new diplomatic offensive and
an outreach to Syria and Iran. In
stead. he accused both countries of
aiding terrorists and insurgents in
Iraq. "We will disrupt the attacks on
our forces," Bush said. "We will in
terrupt the flow of support from Iran
and Syria."
The troop buildup comes two
months after elections that were
widely seen as a call for the with
drawal of some or all U.S. forces
from Iraq. Polling by AP-Ipsos in
December found that only 27 per
cent of Americans approved of
Bush's handling of Iraq, his lowest
rating yet.
The president's address is the
centerpiece of an aggressive public
relations campaign that also includes
detailed briefings for lawmakers and
a series of appearances by Bush
starting with a trip Thursday to Fort
Benning.Ga.Secretary ol State Con
doleezza Rice heads to the Mideast a
day after appearing Thursday with
Defense Secretary Robert Gates at
hearings on Iraq convened by the

Democrats.
Bush's blueprint would boost the
number of U.S. troops in Iraq — now
at 132.000 — to 153,500 at a cost of
$5.6 billion.The highest number was
160,000 a year ago in a troop buildup
for Iraqi elections.
The latest increase calls for send
ing 17,500 U.S. combat troops to
Baghdad. The first of five brigades
will arrive by next Monday.The next
would arrive by Feb. 15 and the re
minder would come in 30-day incre
ments.
Bush also committed 4.000 more
Marines to Anbar Province,a base of
the Sunni insurgency and foreign al-
Qaida fighters.
Bush's plan mirrored earlier
moves attempting to give Iraqi
forces a bigger security role. The
chief difference appeared to be a
recognition that the Iraqis need
more time to take on the full securi
ty burden.
Another difference involves dou
bling the number of U.S. civilian
workers who help coordinate local
reconstruction projects. These State
Department-led units — dubbed
Provincial Reconstruction Teams
are to focus on projects both inside
and outside the heavily guarded
Green Zone, and some will be
merged into combat brigades. The
portion of Bush's plan intended to
boost economic aid and job creation
was given a price tag of just over $1
billion.
Several Republican senators are
candidates for backing the resolu
tion against a troop increase. Sens.
Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe
of Maine. Gordon Smith of Oregon
and Norm Coleman of Minnesota
said they oppose sending more sol
diers.
Republican Sens. George
Voinovich of Ohio and John Warner
of Virginia also might be persuaded.
Warner said he supports the Iraq
Study Group recommendations,
which strongly cautioned against an
increase in troops unless advocated

many restrictions on the troops we
did have."
He said American commanders
have reviewed the Iraqi plan "to en
sure that it addressed these mis
takes."
With Americans overwhelmingly
unhappy with his Iraq strategy. Bush
said it was a legitimate question to
ask why this strategy to secure Bagh
dad will succeed where other opera
tions failed. "This time we will have
the force levels we need to hold the
areas that have been cleared." the
president said.
While Bush put the onus on the
Iraqis to meet their responsibilities
and commit more troops, he did not
threaten specific consequences it
they do not. Iraq has missed previous
self-imposed timetables for taking
over security responsibilities.
Bush, however, cited the govern
ment's latest optimistic estimate."To
establish its authority, the Iraqi gov
ernment plans to take responsibility
for security in all of Iraq's provinces
by November "the president said.
Still, Bush said that "America's
commitment is not open-ended. If
the Iraqi government does not fol
low through on its promises, it will
lose the support of the American
people and it will lose the support of
the Iraqi people. Now is the time to
at."
Resisting calls for troop reduc
tions, Bush said that "failure in Iraq
would be a disaster for the United
States.... A democratic Iraq will not
be perfect. But it will be a country
that fights terrorists instead of har
boring them."
But Bush warned that the strate
gy would, in a short term he did not
define, bring more violence rather
than less.
"Even if our new strategy works
exactly as planned, deadly acts of vi

olence will continue.and we must ex
pect more Iraqi and American casu
alties," he said. "The question is
whether our new strategy will bring
us closer to success. 1 believe that it
will."
Bush's warning was echoed by
Sen. John McCain. R-Ariz..a leading
proponent of a troop increase. "Is it
going to be a strain on the military?
Absolutely. Casualties are going to
go up," the senator said.
Bush said he considered calls
from Democrats and some Republi
cans to pull back American forces.
He concluded it would devastate
Iraq and "result in our troops being
forced to stay even longer."
But he offered a concession to
Congress — the establishment of a
bipartisan working group to formal
ize regular consultations on Iraq. I le
said he was open to future exchanges
and better ideas.
Bush's strategy ignored key rec
ommendations of the Iraq Study
Group, which in December called
for a new diplomatic offensive and
an outreach to Syria and Iran. In
stead. he accused both countries of
aiding terrorists and insurgents in
Iraq. "We will disrupt the attacks on
our forces," Bush said. "We will in
terrupt the flow of support from Iran
and Syria."
The troop buildup comes two
months after elections that were
widely seen as a call for the with
drawal of some or all U.S. forces
from Iraq. Polling by AP-Ipsos in
December found that only 27 per
cent of Americans approved of
Bush's handling of Iraq, his lowest
rating yet.
The president's address is the
centerpiece of an aggressive public
relations campaign that also includes
detailed briefings for lawmakers and
a series of appearances by Bush
starting with a trip Thursday to Fort
Benning.Ga.Secretary ol State Con
doleezza Rice heads to the Mideast a
day after appearing Thursday with
Defense Secretary Robert Gates at
hearings on Iraq convened by the

Democrats.
Bush's blueprint would boost the
number of U.S. troops in Iraq — now
at 132.000 — to 153,500 at a cost of
$5.6 billion.The highest number was
160,000 a year ago in a troop buildup
for Iraqi elections.
The latest increase calls for send
ing 17,500 U.S. combat troops to
Baghdad. The first of five brigades
will arrive by next Monday.The next
would arrive by Feb. 15 and the re
minder would come in 30-day incre
ments.
Bush also committed 4.000 more
Marines to Anbar Province,a base of
the Sunni insurgency and foreign al-
Qaida fighters.
Bush's plan mirrored earlier
moves attempting to give Iraqi
forces a bigger security role. The
chief difference appeared to be a
recognition that the Iraqis need
more time to take on the full securi
ty burden.
Another difference involves dou
bling the number of U.S. civilian
workers who help coordinate local
reconstruction projects. These State
Department-led units — dubbed
Provincial Reconstruction Teams
are to focus on projects both inside
and outside the heavily guarded
Green Zone, and some will be
merged into combat brigades. The
portion of Bush's plan intended to
boost economic aid and job creation
was given a price tag of just over $1
billion.
Several Republican senators are
candidates for backing the resolu
tion against a troop increase. Sens.
Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe
of Maine. Gordon Smith of Oregon
and Norm Coleman of Minnesota
said they oppose sending more sol
diers.
Republican Sens. George
Voinovich of Ohio and John Warner
of Virginia also might be persuaded.
Warner said he supports the Iraq
Study Group recommendations,
which strongly cautioned against an
increase in troops unless advocated
bv military commanders.
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush acknowledged for the first time
Wednesday that he erred by not ordering a
military buildup in Iraq last year and said
he was increasing U.S. troops by 21.500 to
quell the country's near-anarchy. "Where
mistakes have been made, the responsibil
ity rests with me." Bush said.
The buildup puts Bush on a collision
course with the new Democratic Congress
and pushes the American troop presence
in Iraq toward its highest level. It also runs
counter to widespread anti-war passions
among Americans and the advice of some
top generals.
In a prime-time address to the nation.
Bush pushed back against the Democrats'
calls to end the unpopular war. He said
that "to step back now would force a col
lapse of the Iraqi government, tear that
country apart and result in mass killings on
an unimaginable scale.
"If we increase our support at this cru
cial moment and help the Iraqis break the
current cycle of violence, we can hasten the
day our troops begin coming home," Bush

said. But he braced Americans to expect
more U.S. casualties for now and did not
specify how long the additional troops
would stay.
In addition to extra U.S. forces, the plan
envisions Iraq's committing 10.000 to
12,000 more troops to secure Baghdad's
neighborhoods — and taking the lead in
military operations.
Kven before Bush's address, the new
Democratic leaders of Congress empha
sized their opposition to a buildup. "This is
the third time we arc going down this path.
Two times this has not worked," House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said after
meeting with the president. "Why are they
doing this now? That question remains."
I "here was criticism from Republicans.

ed strategy that will drive America deeper
into an unwinnable swamp at a great cost."
s;iid Sen. Chuck I lagel. R-Neb., a Vietnam
veteran and potential GOP presidential
candidate.
After nearly four years of bloody com
bat. the speech was perhaps Bush's hist
credible chance to try to present a winning
strategy in Iraq and persuade Americans
to change their minds about the unpopular
war. which has cost the lives of more than
3.000 members of the U.S. military as well
as more than $400 billion.
Senate and House Democrats are ar
ranging votes urging the president not to

send more troops. While lacking the force
of law. the measures would compel Repub
licans to go on record as either bucking the
president or supporting an escalation.
Usually loath to admit error. Bush said
it also was a mistake to have allowed
American forces to be restricted by the
Iraqi government, which tried to prevent
U.S. military operations against fighters
controlled by the radical Shiite cleric Muq
tada al-Sadr, a powerful political ally of
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.The presi
dent said al-Maliki had assured him that
from now on, "political or sectarian inter
ference will not be tolerated."
As Bush spoke for 20 minutes from the
unusual setting of the White I louse library,
the sounds of protesters amassed outside

the compound's gates occasionally filtered
through.
Bush's approach amounts to a huge
gamble on al-Maliki's willingness — and
ability — to deliver on promises he has
consistently failed to keep: to disband Shi
ite militias, pursue national reconciliation
and make good on commitments for Iraqi
forces to handle security operations in
Baghdad.
"Our past efforts to secure Baghdad
failed for two principal reasons: There
were not enough Iraqi and American
troops to secure neighborhoods that had
been cleared of terrorists and insurgents."
