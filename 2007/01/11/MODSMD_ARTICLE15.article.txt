## Bush to boost number of U.S. troops in Iraq President draws five from both parties and protestors

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush acknowledged for the first time
Wednesday that he erred by not ordering a
military buildup in Iraq last year and said
he was increasing U.S. troops by 21.500 to
quell the country's near-anarchy. "Where
mistakes have been made, the responsibil
ity rests with me." Bush said.
The buildup puts Bush on a collision
course with the new Democratic Congress
and pushes the American troop presence
in Iraq toward its highest level. It also runs
counter to widespread anti-war passions
among Americans and the advice of some
top generals.
In a prime-time address to the nation.
Bush pushed back against the Democrats'
calls to end the unpopular war. He said
that "to step back now would force a col
lapse of the Iraqi government, tear that
country apart and result in mass killings on
an unimaginable scale.
"If we increase our support at this cru
cial moment and help the Iraqis break the
current cycle of violence, we can hasten the
day our troops begin coming home," Bush

said. But he braced Americans to expect
more U.S. casualties for now and did not
specify how long the additional troops
would stay.
In addition to extra U.S. forces, the plan
envisions Iraq's committing 10.000 to
12,000 more troops to secure Baghdad's
neighborhoods — and taking the lead in
military operations.
Kven before Bush's address, the new
Democratic leaders of Congress empha
sized their opposition to a buildup. "This is
the third time we arc going down this path.
Two times this has not worked," House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said after
meeting with the president. "Why are they
doing this now? That question remains."
I "here was criticism from Republicans.

ed strategy that will drive America deeper
into an unwinnable swamp at a great cost."

veteran and potential GOP presidential
candidate.
After nearly four years of bloody com
bat. the speech was perhaps Bush's hist
credible chance to try to present a winning
strategy in Iraq and persuade Americans
to change their minds about the unpopular
war. which has cost the lives of more than
3.000 members of the U.S. military as well
as more than $400 billion.
Senate and House Democrats are ar
ranging votes urging the president not to

send more troops. While lacking the force
of law. the measures would compel Repub
licans to go on record as either bucking the
president or supporting an escalation.
Usually loath to admit error. Bush said
it also was a mistake to have allowed
American forces to be restricted by the
Iraqi government, which tried to prevent
U.S. military operations against fighters
controlled by the radical Shiite cleric Muq
tada al-Sadr, a powerful political ally of
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.The presi
dent said al-Maliki had assured him that
from now on, "political or sectarian inter
ference will not be tolerated."
As Bush spoke for 20 minutes from the
unusual setting of the White I louse library,
the sounds of protesters amassed outside

the compound's gates occasionally filtered
through.
Bush's approach amounts to a huge
gamble on al-Maliki's willingness — and
ability — to deliver on promises he has
consistently failed to keep: to disband Shi
ite militias, pursue national reconciliation
and make good on commitments for Iraqi
forces to handle security operations in
Baghdad.
"Our past efforts to secure Baghdad
failed for two principal reasons: There
were not enough Iraqi and American
troops to secure neighborhoods that had
been cleared of terrorists and insurgents."
