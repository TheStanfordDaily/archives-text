In 2007. the Indian Institute of Management
Bangalore (lIM-B) will become the first Indian
business school to offer an exchange program with
Stanford s Graduate School of Business.
Hie Stanford-IIM-B Exchange Program will
allow 16 students from each school to participate in
a collaborative cross-cultural learning experience
i egarding business and management in the U.S. and
India. According to Management Prof. V. "Seenu"
Srmivasan. coordinator of the Stanford-lIM-B Ex
change Program at the GSB. teams of four students
â€” two from the lIM-B and two second-year Stan
lord GSB MBAs will collaborate on academic
group projects fall quarter. Students will supple
ment their understanding with readings and lec
tures. From Sept. 16 through Sept. 22. the GSB stu
dents will meet with their fellow group members in
Bangaloie, and then the lIM-B students will visit
Stanford for the week of Dec.2 through Dec. B.The
focus of the visits will be on academics,business and
social activities.
Hie hope is that this program will foster strong,
lifelong relationships between Indian and Ameri
can business students." Srinivasan said.

curriculum to he implemented start
ing autumn quarter 2007. It expands
the GSB's current global manage
ment curriculum in part by requiring
students to complete a global experi
ence. This requirement can be met
via a study trip,an approved interna
tional internship, an overseas serv
ice-learning trip or a student ex
change.
"Requiring all students to visit
and learn about a country where
they have not spent time before sig
nals to our students that internation
al aspects of business are becoming
more important and helps them pre
pare for careers that will inevitably

involve them in the international
economy,'" said Prof. John Roberts,
who teaches economics, strategic
management and international busi
ness.
The CiSB currently runs a similar
exchange program with the Ts
inghua University School of Fco
nomics and Management in China.
According to Roberts, the CiSH
does not plan to offer other ex
change programs, but is open to stu
dent suggestions to do so. The stu
dent exchanges with Tsinghua and
11M B currently do not meet the re
quirement tor an international ex
perience because the programs can
not be completed early enough in
the student's studies.
"For now. we are focused on
being able to allow every student to
go on a study trip or a service-learn
ing trip." Roberts said.
