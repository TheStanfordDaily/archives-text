## Editorial Board The 						joy of a syllabus 
### 
The Stanford Syllabus site is an excel
lent but underused resource for both
professors and students. Developed
by Academic Computing with the support
of many Stanford administrative depart
ments, this online repository of course syl
labi has generated a fair amount of publici
ty-
Unfortunately, not all professors post
their syllabi on the site ("Few profs share
syllabi." Oct. 23, 2006). We applaud those
faculty members who have already posted
syllabi in time tor the start of winter quarter
and urge the rest to take advantage of this
resource.
Hie syllabus site helps professors and in
structors organize their classes more effec
tively. Having syllabi online could greatly
reduce the amount of chaos that goes on
during the first week of class. Students are
less likely to come into class, pick up a copy
ot the syllabus and leave immediately. This
is especially important for professors who
need accurate estimates of enrolment num
bers— estimates that affect decisions like
whether to hire an extra teaching assistant
or schedule extra office hours.
Reducing the amount of chaos during
the shopping period also benefits students.
Being able to view course syllabi online al
lows students to make well-informed
choices at the start of the quarter. This re
duces overall anxiety, especially for fresh
men still unfamiliar with Stanford academ
ics. This new online resource is also impor
tant for students who have to choose be
tween two or more classes scheduled at the
same time, especially if both classes are
small-group seminars with limited enrol
ment.
Professors should note that they are by
no means obliged to post course materials
in their entirety. Syllabi posted on the site
do not have to be perfectly complete. But
even the most minimal amount of informa
tion posted on the site will help the shop
ping process run more smoothly.
At the very least, syllabi should provide
students with a good sense of the workload
required for the class. As such, they should
give an idea of the amount of reading per
week, the number of problem sets, papers.

quizzes, midterms, exams and projects. Pro
fessors should also consider including their
grading policies in their syllabi.
Posting a syllabus ahead of time is a good
way of getting some boring administrative
details out of the way. Syllabi can also be
used to specify mundane details, such as the
frequency of meeting times and whether
there is an optional section or additional
field trips.
With this online system, professors can
easily modify the syllabus at any point, as
more details get confirmed. Moreover, they
can remove any information they don't
want students to access. Post an old syllabus.
Post a draft syllabus. Anything is better than
nothing. Even after the quarter is over, it's
not too late for professors to post their syl
labi online for future reference.
Professors would benefit from having
students who are more focused and more
likely to have read the syllabus ahead of
time. Students would be better prepared to
ask questions about the course content, in
stead of asking annoying questions about
what books to buy or how many papers they
have to write.
Currently, the Stanford Syllabus site
may duplicate some of the functions avail
able on Coursework. It would be a good
idea to have this new site integrated with
Coursework or Axess. although this is con
tingent on the sustained popularity of the
site.
Until then, it is important for professors
to post their syllabi in both places. Some
courses are not open to self-registration on
Coursework. which prevents students from
viewing the syllabus unless they are already
enrolled. Also, students are generally un
able to access syllabi from previous years on
Coursework.
It is also important that no class be ex
empt from posting their syllabi online —
neither large introductory classes like
lIIUM. Math 51, Econ 1A or the Biology
core, nor obscure classes offered by bou
tique departments.
We recognize the hidden potential in this
Web site and hope that it will develop into a
