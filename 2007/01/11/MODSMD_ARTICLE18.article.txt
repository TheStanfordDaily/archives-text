# So much for the afterglow
## 
### 
Honestly, the prospect of writing one
last column about Stalin's old
stomping grounds froze my face
into a grimace of polite anguish.The idea of
writing 600-800 more words about (to
quote that poetic soul Darren Franich) that
"corrupt, poverty-stricken iceberg" was
like telling your second grade teacher that
you like her boob job. Serious scar tissue.
As 1 packed up my long underwear,
ungainly winter coat and Russian fox
(i.e. cat) fur gloves, 1 whistled Yankee
Doodle Dandy. On the taxi ride to the
airport. 1 fantasized about each and
every item in the produce section of
Trader Joe's. Even squeezed into my
center seat on the plane, 1 jostled the
passenger next to me every eight min
utes at what 1 thought was the first sight
of America. When that didn't seem to
tickle her fancy, 1 struck up cute little
traveling games: 1 spy with my little eye
something that starts with my sweet re
lease from the former USSR! Some
where over France I discovered that she
didn't speak any English.
Nor did my excitement to return to
American soil diminish when our creaky
Aeroflot plane set first shuddering wheel on
the runway at JFK airport. As my
boyfriend's grandparents drove me down
the streets of New York, 1 crowed gleefully
that the signs were not written in Cyrillic
and gushed about the clean streets and the
affluence of unpolluted oxygen.
"Urn, Kat," they told me. "This is
Harlem."
All week the festival of joys contin
ued: Tacos that you didn't have to check
for surreptitious helpings of chopped
beets! Souvenir vendors who did not
withhold items because they might be
out of my price range! Once I gave a
cashier a five-dollar bill lor a two-dollar
soda and instead of throwing the money
back at me with a snarl, as mere months
ago would have been routine, she quick
ly made change then told me to have a
nice day. Nicc day indeed.
All break, I surfed the sea of capitalism
on the boogie board of "My country right or
wrong" — I all but snorted a line ofTed Nu
gent. I almost went as far as putting myself
on The Review's mailing list.
Thankfully, less than a month into my or
giastic patriotism, the buzz wore off and I
crashed back down into reality. America
and 1 had our honeymoon, but I'm wed to

Russia, for better or for worse. Because I am
a lit major.
There are many things to love about
Russia — its vodka, its natural resources
and its women are a few keen examples —
but as far as I know, to fall in love with its lit
erature is to feel yourself hopelessly and
perpetually seduced.
Who among us has not been forced
into the pleasure of reading "Crime and
Punishment" or "The Death of Ivan II
lych"? (Although after reading it for six
different classes in two different lan
guages, 1 personally wish the old bastard
would get dead and stay that way for
nine minutes.)
Just this morning I attended a class
on the short story and listened with
pride as among the roster of American,
British and French authors, the Russian
writers 1 so revere took center stage.
The enchanted mists of Gogol,
Chekhov's stern indulgence, Tolstoy's
goddamned Ivan Illych. Hearing these
men's names fill an auditorium, the
acidic crevices of their names, so famil
iar to my tongue, I felt singled out in the
crowd of English majors, proud of my
tangential affiliation with Russia's lega
cy of greatness.
Even for people who don't know a Kara
mazov from a Kalamazoo, these bulky for
eign names hold a certain fascination. Let's
face it: their food's not appealing and their
economic policies may be downright ap
palling, but in literature, Russia got some
thing right.
And although by the end of the program
I felt stir-crazy to say the least, eager for the
reassuring conveniences of home, 1 know
that one day I'll go back and probably won
der whv I ever left.

Kat believes that Russia's legacy of greatness
is exponentially increased by her devastating-
Iv charming editor, Vicky. Putin, eat your heart
out. If you agree, let Kat know at klewin@stan
