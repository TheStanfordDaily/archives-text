## NO PLACE LIKE HOME Stanford looks to extend 13-game Maples win streak against Washington 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
President Bill Clinton had hardly fin
ished reciting his oath at his first inaugura
tion the last time the Washington Huskies
beat the Cardinal at Maples Pavilion, in
1993.
Tonight, the Huskies will try to snap
Stanford's improbable 13-game home
winning streak in the series and avenge
last year's particularly sour defeat. The
Cardinal tied the game on three consecu
tive free throws by Chris Hernandez at the
end of regulation and won in overtime.
The previous year. Stanford spoiled Wash
ington's bid to win the Pac-10 in the linal
game of the season at Maples.
But in addition to trying to make up for
past losses, Washington (11-4. 1-3 Pacific
-10 Conference) has a more pressing con
cern: clawing to stay out of the Pac-10 cel
lar. After winning 10 of their first 11
games, head coach Lorenzo Romar's
Huskies come into tonight's game having
lost three of their first four games to con
ference foes. The Huskies dropped three
straight, beginning with a draining, dou
ble-overtime loss to Southern California
on Dec. 28, but beat Arizona State last

week to snap the streak.
While Washington sits eighth in the
conference, Stanford finds itself only one
notch above and similarly desperate for a
win. having lost games to Arizona and Cal
ifornia.
Stanford-Washington games have
been close in the last few years, and this
year should be no exception. While Wash
ington has struggled on the road (going
only 1-4 away from Seattle) the Cardinal
have posted a mediocre 5-3 record at
Maples.
Both squads also feature a balanced at
tack of young players. Washington's scor
ing attack is led by two freshmen, center
Spencer Hawes and forward Quincy
Poindexter, who combine to average 30
points a game. ITie team also starts two
sophomores â€” Jon Brockman. one of
only two players in the Pac-10 to average
at least 10 points a game in both points
and rebounds, and point guard Justin
Dentmon.
All five Washington starters, including
sharpshooter Ryan Appleby, average at
least 10 points a game.
Stanford (9-4, 1-2), meanwhile, relies

should have the answer down low in Brooke
Smith, Kristen Newlin and company as they
meet the less-acclaimed Jill Bell and Andrea
Plouffe.
Stanford's depth will also benefit the team, as
they may again encounter the fatigue that left
them lackluster against the University of South
Carolina on Jan. 8. Harrison, however, was un
fazed by the quick turnaround and said Washing
ton's fan base would be the biggest challenge.
"I think the biggest obstacle will be playing at
their facility," 1 iarrison said. "You know, they're
playing at home, they have the crowd behind
them, and they're really comfortable there. I
think that's something we have to work against,
but we just have to play our game and block out
the crowd and everyone cheering against us."

Harrison said she has no doubt that the Car
dinal is ready to extend its winning streak to 11.
"1 mean, we're ready," Harrison said. "We've
been practicing well and playing well.The coach
es have been preparing us fto defend and] stop
shooters. As long as we just play how Stanford
plays, we'll be fine."
Indeed, the coaches have emphasized more
than just play. Head coach Tara VanDerveer also
gave the girls words of wisdom for the mental as
pects of the game.
"She told us just to have fun. relax and work
hard. Harrison said. "If we work harder than
they do. the outcome will be in our favor."
Io extend its reign over the Pac-10. Stanford
must prove that this hard work and learning will,
in fact.be enounh.
