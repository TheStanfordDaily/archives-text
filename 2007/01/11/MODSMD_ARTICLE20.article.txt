# Bush's new strategy in Iraq
## Not all presents are gifts 
### Paul Craft 
Call me Scrooge, but I have a problem
with holiday gift giving. Don't get me
wrong; I love the holiday season for
other reasons. I love the funky ornaments
that cling to my family's Christmas tree every
year as if a giant had used the tree to sweep
up the floor of Santa's toy room. I love how
there's a sudden influx of candy and food en
tering my house, particularly the appearance
of the German nut bread called "stolen," a
name that inevitably leads to the same joke
every year: "Well, who'd you steal it from?"
Alas. 1 even love seeing my family, lame jokes
and all.
The problem is that 1 don't think its "gifts"
we exchange during the holidays. They say
there's no such thing as a free lunch. I say
there's no such thing as a free gift, or at least
during the holidays. As the Oxford English
Dictionary tells us. a gift is "something, the
possession of which is transferred to another
without the expectation or receipt of an
equivalent." A gift is. by its very nature, free.
But how many of the "gifts"you received this
holiday season were actually free?
Every year, my friends and I exchange
gifts. 1 got my friend Katie the new Belle &
Sebastian album for Christmas this year and
she got me the new David Sedaris book. I felt
good about this exchange because we both
spent roughly equal amounts of money and
thought when buying our gifts. Unfortunate
ly. the exchange between my friend Ramey
and I did not go as smoothly. 1 gave her a
sweater (a cute sweater) and she forgot to get
me a present.
It should be obvious bv now that I'm

not that into gifts, but even I felt a sudden
and intense pang of disappointment as I
realized Ramey had forgotten to get me a
present. This was a feeling 1 had felt at
least two times before. The first was the
Christmas of 2002 when 1 racked my brain
thinking of the perfect gift for my best
friend, settling on an obscure independent
film that she mentioned having loved
years earlier. In exchange, she got me the
DVD of a movie I hated — a movie I'm
pretty sure I told her 1 hated. The second
time I had this feeling of disappointment
at receiving a gift was last Christmas when
I spent hours making my boyfriend a cute
trinket box. I actually made the damn
thing, filling each of its drawers with ;i dif
ferent little present, only to learn on
Christmas day that all he got me was a
book — a lame book.
The dictionary might define a gift as
something transferred without the expecta
tion of an equivalent, hut I for one expect mi
equivalent! And I'm certainly not the only
one. In that book Katie got me for Christmas,
David Sedaris describes how he actually
keeps a ledger of everything anyone ever got

him for Christmas and how much he esti
mates those gifts cost. He refers back to this
ledger when buying gifts for people, looking
to see how much a person spent on him so
that he may spend an equivalent amount on
them. Sedaris not only expects an equivalent
gift, he makes sure he gets one.
So either the definition of a gift is wrong
or what Sedaris and I are giving away at
Christmas are not gifts.
I don't think they're gifts. 1 believe in the
concept of ;i gift, something that you give
without expecting something in return. 1 be
lieve in it because it is a beautiful concept to
me. this idea that humans have the capacity
and the desire to give selflessly. And it's not
that I have a problem with the presents we
exchange during the holidays. I actually ap
preciate the opportunity it gives me to think
about my friends and what they're interested
in. It's just that these presents we give are not
gifts. A gift is something special, something
that isn't given every rime something is given.
A gift is a unique kind of present, the kind
you only give and get a handful of times in
your life. It's the kind of thing you give
anonymously, the kind of thing you give sole
ly for the benefit of its recipient and for the
joy of giving. The distinction is important be
cause without it. we loose a word for a very
beautiful, very human phenomenon.
