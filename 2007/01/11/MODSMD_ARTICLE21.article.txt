(Italian) Bel far niente
(English) The beauty of doing nothing
Over break I read "Eat, Pray, Love" by
Elizabeth Gilbert, which details a
year of the author's life, including
four months she spent in Italy. While there,
she has a conversation with one of her
friends, who says that "Americans have an in
ability to relax into sheer pleasure" because
we spend billions to entertain ourselves, we
know how to stare at the TV in a "mild
coma," but we don't know how to just ...relax
and let ourselves do nothing for a time.
But, he goes on to assure her. Italians are
masters of bel far niente — the art of doing
nothing — and therefore, she is in an ideal
place to learn this important skill. Now. I've
never been to Italy, so I can't confirm or re
fute this statement. But I will agree that I and

the majority of people I know (most of whom
also happen to be Americans) really don't
know how to "do nothing." It's almost ab
surdly amusing when you think about it. I low
hard can it be to just do nothing? Surely, it's
harder to actually get things done.
At the end of fall quarter, after finishing
my last final. 1 went into overdrive for a day.
as I packed and tried to tie up loose ends and
say goodbye to everyone on campus. When 1

got hack to North Carolina after a red-eye
flight. 1 slept soundly for about eight hours,
finished up a portfolio piece for Creative
Writing (a class 1 highly endorse) and went to
a neighborhood party so my parents could
show me off.
Finally time to relax? No.
I then sat down to write out a list of all the
things I wanted to get done over break: books
I wanted to read, things to do to get ahead in
classes I was planning to take this quarter,
things I wanted to write, comics to draw, peo
ple I needed to see and so on. Now. this isn't
unusual for me. 1 sometimes have to write in
my planner, "call parents" or "clean retain
ers." because I have a tendency to forget
things like that in the storm of wanting to
check things off.
