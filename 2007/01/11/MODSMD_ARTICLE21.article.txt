(Italian) Bel far niente
(English) The beauty of doing nothing
Over break I read "Eat, Pray, Love" by
Elizabeth Gilbert, which details a
year of the author's life, including
four months she spent in Italy. While there,
she has a conversation with one of her
friends, who says that "Americans have an in
ability to relax into sheer pleasure" because
we spend billions to entertain ourselves, we
know how to stare at the TV in a "mild
coma," but we don't know how to just ...relax
and let ourselves do nothing for a time.
But, he goes on to assure her. Italians are
masters of bel far niente — the art of doing
nothing — and therefore, she is in an ideal
place to learn this important skill. Now. I've
never been to Italy, so I can't confirm or re
fute this statement. But I will agree that I and

the majority of people I know (most of whom
also happen to be Americans) really don't
know how to "do nothing." It's almost ab
surdly amusing when you think about it. I low
hard can it be to just do nothing? Surely, it's
harder to actually get things done.
At the end of fall quarter, after finishing
my last final. 1 went into overdrive for a day.
as I packed and tried to tie up loose ends and
say goodbye to everyone on campus. When 1

got hack to North Carolina after a red-eye
flight. 1 slept soundly for about eight hours,
finished up a portfolio piece for Creative
Writing (a class 1 highly endorse) and went to
a neighborhood party so my parents could
show me off.
Finally time to relax? No.
I then sat down to write out a list of all the
things I wanted to get done over break: books
I wanted to read, things to do to get ahead in
classes I was planning to take this quarter,
things I wanted to write, comics to draw, peo
ple I needed to see and so on. Now. this isn't
unusual for me. 1 sometimes have to write in
my planner, "call parents" or "clean retain
ers." because I have a tendency to forget
things like that in the storm of wanting to
check things off.

I reassure myself with the obser
vation that I'm not the only person
so insane. I mean, I know it's been
said a million times before, but
there are a lot of ducks here at
Stanford. It's kind of obligatory,
right? We're getting some of the
most expensive educations avail
able. It would be ungrateful to not
complete!) pack our schedules and
take advantage of all the amazing
opportunities here. And most of us
probabh got in at least partially be
cause we were used to doing every
thing back in high school. That's a
hard habit to break.
One of my friends works with a
professor who puts in 60- to 80-hour
weeks, between the lab he runs, sur
geries he performs and all of his
other responsibilities. Mv lirst
thought when 1 heard that was:
"Wow. I'm working hard in college
specifically to avoid doing that tor

the rest of my life."
The "I'm stretehing myself now
so I might have some slack for later"
defense made sense when I was tak
ing a part-time job in high school.
And. yes. there's a very good case for
it now. But at what point does it end?
Do I put in 60-hour weeks right
when 1 get out of school to secure a
better job for myself several years
later? Do I take work home, despite
not getting paid for all those extra
hours and stress, because there's a
better chance of promotion and se
curity in the future? When does it
end? When you're made mid-level
management? Partner? CEO?
In "I at. Pray. Love," while living
in Italy. Ms. Gilbert pretty much just
ate, traveled around the country
(eating wherever she went, of
course) and practiced speaking Ital
ian. which she was learning simply
because she wanted to. Let's just say
that there are times when I really
envy her.
But then, she was in her 30s. and
had already been given an advance
for the book she would write based
on her experiences, which was what

enabled her to make the trip in the
first plaee. St) there's a clear argu
ment for the "work hard, then take a
break" approach.
But just taking a break isn't bad
either — I really like not doing any
thing during lunch and being able to
just munch and wander around.
