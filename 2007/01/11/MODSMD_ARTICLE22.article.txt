## Harbaugh's up side is tantalizing 
### 
You know that feeling right
after you wake up from a real
ly bad dream — the kind
that's just real enough that it takes a
few minutes for you to realize that it's
over, but you're still not quite able to
shake the feeling that maybe it isn't?
That's more or less how 1 feel
about the Stanford football program
right now.
The Walt I larris era is over, of that
there's no doubt. But whether better
days are ahead for the Cardinal is yet
to be seen. Of course, on the bright
side, things couldn't get much worse.
That I larris had to go is no longer
in doubt, really.True, he only had two
years to turn around an already strug
gling program, but things didn't exact
ly show any signs of improving in his
time on the Farm.
Moreover, as was especially evi
dent after the Cardinal's surprisingly
close 26-17 loss at Berkeley, Harris's
often stonefaced personality seemed
to clash with the passion displayed by
team leaders. I'll never forget the raw
emotion I saw from Stanford athletes
like Brandon Harrison and Michael
Okwo following that game. But from
I larris, nothing. Frustration certainly,
and maybe even a bit of anger — but
nothing to match the passion of his
players.
Stoicism in football coaches has
often been an admired trait — the fe
dora and level gaze of Tom Landry
comes to mind — but for a team that
lost 11 of 12 games in 2006, fans and
players alike want to know that the
team's struggles are affecting the head
coach as well. Losing should never be
an easy thing to deal with,and in trying
to appear even-keeled and cool under
pressure, 1 larris too often made it ap
pear to be easy for him.
And that is exactly why the hiring
of Jim Harbaugh has to be encourag
ing for Stanford fans. As an ex-player,
the former Michigan and NFL quar
terback should bring a more visible
level of emotion to the Stanford side
lines. If his college teams can adopt
some part of the attitude Harbaugh
played with when he was known as
"Captain Comeback," then Stan
ford's games should at least be more
interesting from the fan's perspective.
His NFL experience should also
be a strong selling point for potential
recruits, especially early in what the
University hopes will be a rebuilding
process. Although he might not be
able to sell great high school athletes
on their chances to compete for na
tional recognition in college, at least
Harbaugh will be able to say that he
knows what it takes to get to the next
level. And, so far at least, his personal
ity seems to be one that recruits might
want to play for.
In a tough Pac-10 Conference that
will get only tougher over the next few
years, Harbaugh has a long road ahead
of him as he tries to transform the Car
dinal from a doormat to a contender.
USC and Cal show no signs of fading
as conference powers. Oregon State
finished strong in 2(X)6. And Arizona
State could soon compete for a coher
ence title under new coach Dennis Er
ickson. Indeed, there is a strong argu
ment to be made that the Pac-10 could
be the nation's second-toughest con
ference, after the SEC. in 2007.
But at least now the Cardinal look
like they're trying to get ahead rather
than merely keep up. The hiring of
I larris felt like a halfhearted attempt
at finding a caretaker for the pro
gram. He was regarded as a solid but
unspectacular hire, the kind of guy
who would do all right, but at the
same time you knew he wasn't a
prodigy. In sports terms, there was no
real up side' with I larris.
The opposite is true of his succes
sor. Harbaugh comes in as an un
proven coach at the highest level ot
college football, but that's exactly
what makes him interesting.Theskyis
the limit for I larbaugh because we
don't really know who he is as a coach.
Whether Jim Harbaugh was the
best choice for the job, only time will
tell. So far though, he certainly seems
to be at least a good choice. Stanford
offered him the position and he ac
cepted with energy and enthusiasm.
Given where the program has been
since the days of IV Willingham, that s
really all the University could ask.
