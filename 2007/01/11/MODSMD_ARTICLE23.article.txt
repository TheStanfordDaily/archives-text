Both tournaments will feature top compe
tition with players from regional powers such
as UCLA, Southern California and California.
However, the Cardinal will also get to see
players from nationally competitive programs
like Notre Dame, Georgia Tech and Florida.
"This is the NCAA championship at a
smaller, less prestigious tournament," Bur
dette said."Those girls [at the Freeman Invita
tional) are going to be our toughest competi
tion all year, and they're all going to be there."
Despite the fierce competition that the
Cardinal will face, assistant coach Frankie
Brennan said he feels good about his team's
prospects at the NCTC Classic.
"I think that the three girls I'm taking all
have a chance to do well," he said. "Megan is
our walk-on, but she had a really good fall;
she's a kind of sleeper. Of course, Leila had a
good tournament and Whitney got to the fi
nals last year, so I expect those two to do
well."
Head coach Lele Forood was also confi
dent in assessing her team's prospects at the
Freeman Invitational, citing the Cardinal's
history of success there. Durkin is the defend
ing champion of the tournament, and Logar
was a finalist as a freshman.
"We've historically done very well at this
tournament," Forood said. "It's gotten a lot of
our players a lot of wins over top kids from
other schools, which has helped us get into the
individual championships."
The NCTC Classic and the Freeman Invita
tional mark the end of the individual tourna
ment season for Stanford.The individual tour
nament season acts as a medium for players to
showcase their abilities in qualifying for the
NCAA Championships while boosting their
rankings on the national level.
"This is more or less the last chance to get
some nice wins before we get into dual compe
tition." Forood said. "It's a fun way to go out;

it's really the end of the fall season even
though it's the start of the winter."
The players were able to choose which
tournament they wanted to go to based on
their own "personal preference," Forood said.
After effectively concluding its fall season
after this weekend. Stanford will move on to
team competition, with its first match coming
against UC-Davis on Jan. 25.
It's been a fairly successful fall season for

the three-time defending champion Cardinal.
Brennan shared his viewpoint on the perform
ances of his players thus far. singling out the
remarkable showings that Nyugen has turned
out.
"We're especially impressed by Jessica," he
said. "She's now ranked No. S in the country.
She's really impressed us by taking it to the
next level. That's what you want from the fall,
that's what you really look for."

I brood also summed up her feelings on the
individual performances of her playei s dui ing
the fall season.
"So far, Celia and Jessica have had the best
performances." she said. "This month matters
a lot, and there's still plenty of time for the
other people to bring up their records as well,
l he seniors were injured and took a few tough
losses. Overall, though, they've generally
played well."
