the market for a coach since Nick Saban
left to take the Alabama job. had met with
Carroll for four hours on Sunday in Costa
Rica, where the coach was vacationing.

total control of the team, power Carroll lacked
in his previous NFL coaching jobs with the
New York Jets and New England Patriots.

the draft in April. The only question, the
coach added, was how high he will go.
