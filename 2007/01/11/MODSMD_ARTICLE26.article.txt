## GOVERNATOR TO CUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION BY 10 PERCENT 
### ARAM HUR DESK EDITOR 
Entering his second term. Califor
nia Gov, Arnold Schwarzenegger an
nounced an ambitious agenda in his
State of the State address Tuesday.
Among the items the Governator
introduced is a mandate to reduce
greenhouse gas emission from motor
vehicles, making California the first
state in the nation to adopt such strict
emissions laws. Schwarzenegger is
sued an executive order to slash the
carbon content of all passenger vehicle
fuels sold in California by 10 percent
by the year 2020. While details of the
motion are still in the works, adminis
tration officials said the new standard
will apply to all gasoline refiners.
"Our cars have been running on
dirty fuel for too long," Schwarzeneg
ger said in the speech."California has
the muscle to bring about such
change. 1 say use it."
There are several ways the state
can achieve this reduction. One is in
creasing the amount of ethanol in
gasoline. Ibe current percentage sits
at 6 percent — a 4 percent increase
would be able to meet the new state
standard.
Another debated procedure is
producing more hydrogen for fuel
cell vehicles and natural gas for natu
ral-gas vehicles. Administrators said
that the plan will strive to leave rules
open enough for oil businesses to still
find the most cost effective solution.
Ilie new plan pleased environ
mentalists, who will push for more
states and Congress to enact similar
rules. Previous environmental rules
spearheaded by California have
made it to the national level.
But Economics Prof. Frank Wolak
cautioned that their prospects may
not be as rosy as they seem. In a recent
article in the San Jose Mercury News.
Wolak worried about the negative
repercussions the plan will bring.
Among them are hiked gasoline
prices and an increase in global
warming emissions in the Midwest
— the lead region producing corn,
the ingredient used to extract
ethanol.
