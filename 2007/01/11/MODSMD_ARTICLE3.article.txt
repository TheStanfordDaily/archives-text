# Rolling with the punches
## Freshman Appel unfazed by college game, tough loss to BYU 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
When freshman forward Jayne Appel was getting ready
for the first game of her Stanford career, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer came up to Appel and told her "It's the same basket,
just a bigger stage."
One hundred and four baskets —or 168 points — later,
Appel has found it's the truth.
"[What VanDerveer said] helped me realize that it's really
just basketball and the game hasn't changed," Appel said.
' The setting may be different, and the pace may be different,
but that's all."
It's with this attitude that Appel has stepped up as one of
the leading scorers tor the Cardinal. She has averaged 12.0
points per game over the Cardinal s tirst 1 5 contests,third best
on the team, and leads the squad shooting 53.8 percent from
the field.
Appel made her debut in the Nov. 13 BYU game. Coming
off of an injured left shoulder, which had kept her on the
bench for a month. Appel came on the court with 17:l l ) left in
the first half, and in just 14 minutes she had five rebounds, four

points, and two blocks. It wasn't enough,
though, to stop the then-No. 24 Cougars
from scoring a 55-52 upset over then-No. 4
Stanford.
With her nerves wracked throughout
the close game. Appel said she looked to
ward the seniors who "have seen it all" for
their leadership.
"It was really hard losing that game, but
I think I took a lot away from it." Appel
said.
An even bigger challenge came in
Appel's third game against then-No. 4 Ten
nessee. Among the Cardinal's longtime ri
vals. and one of the best teams in the coun
try. with one of the best players in the coun
try (sophomore forward Candace Parker),
the Lady Vols faced Appel with a mighty
challenge — literally
"Candace Parker hit her first few shots
[including a dunk] right in my face," Appel
said. "I just thought. It has to go up from
here: it can't get any worse than that.'"
With that mentality, Appel said she was
actually relaxed, and it led to her break
through performance of the season. Nearly
keeping up with Parker, she led the Cardi
nal with 23 points, five rebounds and five
blocks in 30 minutes of play.
Continuing to step up for a lagging Car
dinal against its toughest competition yet.
Appel went on to put in another 16 points

and nine rebounds against then-No. 8
Georgia two days later.
"1 was really nervous," she said. You
can't imagine a bigger stage than [being on
the court with those top-ranked teams]."
With more experience, though. Appel
feels she's learning the ropes. She said that
she feels that every day she is expected to
come out and truly play, even if it is just for
practice.
And at gametime, Appel shines even
more. Including her career-high 23 points
against Tennessee, she's had nine double
digit scoring performances and five in a row
entering this weekendis play: 11 points at
U( LA Dec. 22.15 against Arizona Dec. 28.
1 6 against Arizona State Dec. 30.15 at Fres
no State Jan. 2 and 19 points at Cal Jan. h.
Appel also has contributed on the glass.

"I realized that it's really just basketball and the
game hasn't changed. The setting may be differ
ent, and the pace may be different, but that's all."
— Jayne Appel, freshman center

where she has tallied six rebounds per
game, and a team-leading 27 blocks. With
those escalating numbers. Appel said she
needs to continue improving.
"I need to extend my game outwards
and be able to guard quicker players." she
said.
But Appel isn't letting her own excep
tional start to the season get in the way of an
even better finish for the team. She's still at
the beginning of her Stanford career, but
the season is rapidly progressing and every
one. including Appel, will need to step up to
take the Cardinal to the Final Four after
three straight Elite Eight losses..
"I'm really just playing for my other
teammates."she said."lt's all about compil
ing as many wins as we can as a team, and
winning the tournaments."
