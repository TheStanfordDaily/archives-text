The women's basketball team hits the
road for a two-game trip to Washington
this weekend. The No. 10 Cardinal will
meet Washington tonight at 7 p.m. at the
Bank of America Arena in Seattle. On Sat
urday, the team will then head to Pullman
to face Washington State.
"Hie 1 luskies (12-5.5-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference), currently second in the Pac-10.
are looking to strip the Cardinal ot the
conference lead. A win for Washington
would also help to redeem the Huskies
88-83 loss to Arizona State on Jan. 7.
Freshman forward Michelle Harrison be

ford's 10consecutive wins,gives the Cardi
nal the advantage heading into the
matchup.
"I think that the momentum that we
have right now from our winning streak is
really pushing us and giving us the rhythm
that we need to go on the road and play
well." Harrison said.
Furthermore, Stanford (12-3, 5-0 Pac
-10) has experience playing in an unfriend

and then-No. 8 Georgia exposed the Car
dinal to difficult road trips, and helped to
prepare them for similar conference situa

"I think (playing at Tennessee and
Georgia] was a really good learning expe
rience. given it was our first road trip."
Harrison said. "I definitely think we did
the best thing, which was to take the posi
tive out of it."
However, with two L's in the record
book from November, the meeting with
the Huskies will be a good measure as to

whether it stands for "learning'or just
"loss." Washington will challenge the Car
dinal especially in the backcourt. Senior
guard Cameo Hicks and junior guard
Emily Florence, who lead the Huskies in
scoring and assists, respectively, rank in the
conference's top 10 for steals and will test
the composure of Candice Wiggins and
her fellow guards.
Hicks will also draw out the defense
with her long-range jumper, as she is 22 of
51 from behind the arc. good enough for
sixth in the conference in three-point field
goal percentage. But Stanford should be
able to respond, as Wiggins is fourth on the
same list and leads the Pac-10 in made
three-pointers. Similarly, the Cardinal
