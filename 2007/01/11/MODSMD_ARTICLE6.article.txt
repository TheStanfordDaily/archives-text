The women's basketball team hits the
road for a two-game trip to Washington
this weekend. The No. 10 Cardinal will
meet Washington tonight at 7 p.m. at the
Bank of America Arena in Seattle. On Sat
urday, the team will then head to Pullman
to face Washington State.
"Hie 1 luskies (12-5.5-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference), currently second in the Pac-10.
are looking to strip the Cardinal ot the
conference lead. A win for Washington
would also help to redeem the Huskies
88-83 loss to Arizona State on Jan. 7.
Freshman forward Michelle Harrison be
lieves that this, compounded with Stan
ford's 10consecutive wins,gives the Cardi
nal the advantage heading into the
matchup.
"I think that the momentum that we
have right now from our winning streak is
really pushing us and giving us the rhythm
that we need to go on the road and play
well." Harrison said.
Furthermore, Stanford (12-3, 5-0 Pac
-10) has experience playing in an unfriend
ly arena. Early losses to No. 4 Tennessee
and then-No. 8 Georgia exposed the Car
dinal to difficult road trips, and helped to
prepare them for similar conference situa
tions.
"I think (playing at Tennessee and
Georgia] was a really good learning expe
rience. given it was our first road trip."
Harrison said. "I definitely think we did
the best thing, which was to take the posi
tive out of it."
However, with two L's in the record
book from November, the meeting with
the Huskies will be a good measure as to

whether it stands for "learning'or just
"loss." Washington will challenge the Car
dinal especially in the backcourt. Senior
guard Cameo Hicks and junior guard
Emily Florence, who lead the Huskies in
scoring and assists, respectively, rank in the
conference's top 10 for steals and will test
the composure of Candice Wiggins and
her fellow guards.
Hicks will also draw out the defense
with her long-range jumper, as she is 22 of
51 from behind the arc. good enough for
sixth in the conference in three-point field
goal percentage. But Stanford should be
able to respond, as Wiggins is fourth on the
same list and leads the Pac-10 in made
three-pointers. Similarly, the Cardinal

on two sophomores for the bulk of its
scoring, with Lawrence Hill and Anthony
Goods combining to average almost 27
points per game. In their last game
against Virginia, the Cardinal started Hill
and Goods along with two freshmen,
Robin and Brook Lopez, as well as senior
Fred Washington. The team spread the
ball, and all five scored in double digits in
that game.
The Cardinal will likely start sopho
more point guard Mitch Johnson to defend
Dentmon. though Johnson lias recently
lost minutes to freshman Landry Fields

and Washington, who has averaged seven
assists in Stanford's last three contests.
Stanford is coming off a dramatic 76-
75 win over Virginia last Sunday, winning
on a last-second floater by 1 lill.The team
will try to parlay that win into a new
streak, and head coach Trent Johnson
said that the win was the best game the
Cardinal had played all season.
Stanford will lean heavily on the
Lopez twins to slow Washington's big
men. They started together for the first
time against Virginia and netted a com
bined 27 points. Both are playing their

best basketball of the season at the right
time as conference play begins. Robin has
averaged 15 points over his last three
games, while Brook has averaged 11 over
the same span.
The Huskies can expect an especially
chilly reception in Maples tonight: It will
mark Tim Morris' first trip back to the
Farm since he transferred from Stanford
after last season. Morris, who scored six
points in the Cardinal's dramatic victory
last year, is sitting out this season because
of NCAA transfer rules.
Tip-off is set for 7:30.
