## Editorial Board Harbaugh's challenge 
### 
Both local and national media, includ
ing The Daily, were skeptical about
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby's de
cision to hire Jim Harbaugh as the next
Stanford football coach. Harbaugh re
placed Walt 1 larris. who was fired after two
largely unsuccessful seasons. He was chosen
from a pool that included several candi
dates widely regarded as more qualified, in
cluding Oregon defensive coordinator
Mike Aliotti. former USC offensive coordi
nator Norm Chow, and Texas Tech coach
Mike Leach, all from successful, winning
programs.
Instead. Stanford has gone out on a limb
and taken a coach who does not have major
coaching experience at the Division I level.
Harbaugh was successful at the University
of San Diego, going a Pete Carroll-like 27-2
in his final 29 games as coach. But coaching
Division I-AA, without scholarship players,
is very different than the fiercely competi
tive and well-funded Pac-10. Bowlsby cer
tainly picked 1 larhaugh over the other can
didates for a compelling reason, and consid
ering the other choices, Harbaugh must
have made a strong case for himself.
Harbaugh certainly has the potential to
be successful at Stanford, but he must un
derstand the unique environment here on
the farm. We are not USC, for one. and we
cannot expect to win ten games every year
and go to a BCS game. We are not even Ore
gon. which usually wins eight or nine times
a season. We have higher academic stan
dards. which creates a much smaller poten
tial pool of players.

However, we should expect to be com
petitive every year, at every game, and not
be humiliated at our own gorgeous stadium,
game after game. This is Harbaugh's task,
and it is a decidedly doable one. He needs,
from day one, to restore the self-respect and
pride of Stanford football, of knowing that
on any given day. we can score touchdowns
and not humiliate ourselves. Walt Harris's
first year was just that: we went 5-6, beat a
ranked team, and almost went to a bowl
game. We almost beat Notre Dame.
That is all we ask of Harbaugh: to make
us proud again, to hold our heads up high
and actually care again. During USC's
domination of us this year, some students
unfurled a banner that said "We Believe in
Stanford Football." Very few students and
even fewer alumni did likewise. And it
showed: at several home games, Stanford
fans were outnumbered by their oppo
nents' supporters in a stadium, replete the
palm trees, that is as "Stanford" as one can
get. Most "fans" tended to leave at half
time.
We want to believe again, to fill our sta
dium with red and white, not with red and
gold, or blue and yellow. 5-7 is not terrible;
1-11 is. Next season we hope to be in the
stands, cheering with enthusiasm unknown
to mankind, as our team takes the field,
ready to again beat the Arizonas and San
Jose States of the world. Perhaps one day.
maybe in the distant future, Stanford will be
as good as USC. if not better. After all. we
are Stanford, and our football team should
reflect who we are: the best.
