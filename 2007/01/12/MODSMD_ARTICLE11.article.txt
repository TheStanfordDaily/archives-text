In this column 1 usually try to stick to top
ics that are straightforward and practi
cal. Not this time.
There's not much reason to blend peas
and then reform the liquid puree into
spherical ravioli, or whip blue cheese into a
foam, or serve a cloud of gaseous lime juice
— unless, like me, you find it unbelievably
cool.
While you could argue that all cooking is
essentially chemistry, a small number of
chefs have taken this principal to its ex
treme conclusion, turning their kitchens
into laboratories.
The movement's acknowledged instiga
tor is Ferran Adria, chef and owner of the
restaurant F.I Bulli. Despite its location in
the obscure, hard-to-reach town of Roses,
Spain. Restaurant Magazine ranks HI Bulli
as the top restaurant in the world. It is open
for only six months a year — the other six
Adria and his staff spend developing new
techniques and recipes. He is most famous
tor creating foam (exactly like it sounds:
various foods and flavors served as foam),
but he has also experimented with gels,
emulsions, and gases.
Recently it's become possible to at
tempt some of these techniques at home.
Will Goldfarb, chef at Room 4 Dessert in
New York, now sells "culinary essentials"
like methylcellulose. agar agar and tapioca
maltodextrin online at willpowder.com.
Adria himself has introduced a line of
products called Texturas for replicating the
dishes he serves in his restaurant.They are
available online at La Tienda
www.tienda.com.
Is it safe? Since many restaurants now
use these techniques (and almost all of the
chemicals involved are used in commercial
food preparation as well), it seems unlikely
that eating any of this stuff will hurt you. If
you buy them from another source, make
sure the chemicals are marked food safe,
rhis ensures that they contain no harmful
contaminants.
Over winter break I tried my hand at
spherification. a process whereby liquids
are manipulated to hold a roughly spherical
shape. Ibis involves two chemicals, sodium
alginate and calcium chloride, which com
bine to form a thin gel around the liquid.
The basic method is to combine your liquid
of choice with the sodium alginate and then
either spoon or syringe it into a bath of cal

cium chloride solution. After a minute or so.
you fish out the newly formed orb and rinse
it in water. It's then ready to serve.
The Texturas website offers some good
hints for navigating the process. It recom
mends combining the sodium alginate and
liquid with a handheld blender, then letting
it rest for an hour to allow the bubbles to
dissipate. It also notes that the reaction will
not work at a pi I of less than four, so if your
liquid is acidic (for example, fruit juice), you
may have to break out those test strips from
high school and adjust the acidity if neces
sary. The preferred substance for this is cal
cium citrate, also available online.
My own attempt yielded mixed results.
While Adria's creations are described as
melt-in-your-mouth ,completely liquid once
ingested, mine had a distinct gel-like coat
ing. 1 think I may have used too much sodi
um alginate.
And then there's the matter of convinc
ing your guests to try your creations. My
mom's response when 1 presented her with
a tea sphere perched in a spoon was, "What
do you do with it?"
Tea Ravioli
Adapted from Texturas
420 g sweetened tea
1 .5 g sodium alginate
3.25 g calcium chloride
Blend the sodium alginate with 75 g
water. Mix with the tea and let stand until air
bubbles dissipate. Dissolve the calcium
chloride in S(H) g water. Gently tip a spoon
ful of the tea mixture into the calcium chlo
ride solution and let sit for 30 seconds.
Spoon out and quickly dip in water before
serving.

Email Nate at nsoloni&stanford.edu if your
chem lab has some food-grade calcium chlo
ride they 're willing to part with.
