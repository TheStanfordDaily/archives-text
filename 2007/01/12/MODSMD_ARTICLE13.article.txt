# Resolutions Stanford style
## 
### 
It's been two weeks — do you know where
your resolutions are? Regardless of
whether you watched the ball drop at
midnight EST or on West Coast time-delay
(twice the celebration means three times the
fun), those lofty promises of self-improve
ment have a way of disappearing right about
the time your hangover dissipates.
Or so pop culture says. Although this tem
porarily ambitious behavior may be normal
for the rest of the world (there's a reason why
gym membership explodes in January, only
to drop off sometime around February 14th).
there's something distinctly un-Stanford
about letting go of goals — fantastic or oth
erwise.
As I noted in my last column before
break, we believe fervently in delayed grati
fication — remember that brilliantly penned
litany of accolades on the folder containing
your acceptance letter? ITie one that recog
nized the hours of rehearsal, practice and
competition, not to mention sleepless nights,
you diligently poured into your high school
career? ITiree weeks ago, 750 more high
school seniors received the same praise
bearing envelopes, and not because Stanford
is too cheap to print new ones. Indeed, some
traditions (the Band Run, Full Moon on the
Quad and other boring events along the
same lines) come and go. but one will, hope
fully, never leave: the steadfast, determined
worker-bee student.
Unlike those irresolute matching-jump
suit wearers who abandon the treadmill after
six weeks, we Stanford students make our
commitments whole-heartedly. Although
gyms (excluding 24 1 four Fitness) may close.
Campus Drive is always open. And in case
you didn't notice the last time you stumbled
home from Meyer's 24-hour study room,
there are people inside at any time of day —
or night. Dedication and sleep are not always
compatible.
But if most of us are unwilling to make
promises we can't keep, then what is a Stan
ford student to do on New Year's?
True to Stanford form and journalistic
good practice, the remainder of this column
contains a thoroughly researched response
to this question. Although we all honor our
work commitments differently, my personal
devotion means working well in advance of

deadlines. And so it is that, prior to Decem
ber 31st, I formulated a hypothetical answer
to my question and then, ever the dedicated
columnist, spent my co-hosted New Year's
Fve party in search of verification. Say what
you will about my method; I was. of course,
correct.
Option #1: Go all out.
Stanford kids are no strangers to this no
holds-barred mentality. Unless you spent
five hours a day staring at the bottom of a
swimming pool and ended up competing in
the junior (or adult) Olympics, your well
rounded approach to life — a little bit of
community service, a little bit of student gov
ernment and a lot of impressive titles — is
how you got here, right?
Thus, "I'm going to figure out what I'm
doing for the rest of my life," Brad said. Em
ployed by a biotech firm in South San Fran
cisco since our graduation in 2004. Brad is
hardly lacking in current stability or in fu
ture options. Apply to med school? Busi
ness school? Grad school in biology? Work
as a biochemist at a bigger company and
then try to make a lateral move to market
ing or business strategy? Biotech consult
ing? Oh, and he also wants to travel. His list
is endless, but he refuses to compromise.
Shortly after we spoke at 10:30pm. Brad and
his girlfriend left the party — they had at
least one more stop on their evening's cal
endar.
Option #2: Go against the grain.
As predicted, the overwhelming majority
of responses I received fell into this category.
This is hardly surprising, given that we're
well-practiced in this arena, too. "I don't
make New Year's resolutions," Laura said.
"If I want something, 1 go after it — regard
less of what day it is."

"Why wait for January 1st?" she asked.
"What if the perfect opportunity is out there
in July, but you haven't bothered to put in the
time to find it?" Laura's post-college career
track record: Bain, tech start-up, Google. Not
exactly swimming upstream by Stanford
standards, but hardly meandering with the 9-
to-5 current.
Option #3: Go deep.
On the surface, resolutions of this sort ap
pear the most "normal" by national stan
dards. "I'm going to stop biting my nails."
Nari said. "With the exception of last year,
when I didn't bother. I've made the same res
olution since high school. Once 1 made it for
three months."
However, as the next 20 minutes of con
versation revealed, even the most simple,
recognizable resolutions take on new dimen
sions in their Stanford form. As Nari dis
cussed historical observations ("1 do it when
1 m thinking hard. I told my boss that if he
sees me doing it. I'm earning my money"),
possible psychological underpinnings, and
current rationale ("It's not professional"), it
was clear that he'd put more than a little
thought in to his choice. Perhaps most indica
tive ot this intellectual approach: "I've been
easing in to it. starting a couple of days ago.
Cold turkey never works."
Without exception, every resolution I
heard tell into one of these three categories.
A few contained both options 1 and 3. As I
mixed and mingled amidst the candlelit
apartment, juggling a glass of champagne in
one hand, a camera in the other and a grow
ing list of mental notes, I stumbled across a
resolution of my own: keep doing it this way
( it being life/work/play/you name it).
When the process is enjoyable, the impor
tance ol the end result pales in comparison.
In case you have any doubts, just ask a Stan
lord grad about the most valuable, meaning
tul. life-changing part of his or her Stanford
career; I doubt any of them will mention a
diploma.

hi addition to enjoying the journey, Lisa
Mendelnum resolves to go to bed before
eleven, figure out wluit she's doing in June and
respond to all emails she receives at
