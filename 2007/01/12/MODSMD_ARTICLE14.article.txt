Man's best friend
If 1 had a girlfriend. I would trade her for an iPhone.
As a lifelong Windows user, I usually take most of the
hype about Apple products with a grain of salt, but I
never knew an inanimate object could inspire as much
lust as the latest technological wonder to emerge from
Cupertino. When I read the news of its unveiling, I went
straight to Apple's home page and gaped in awe at the
stunning beauty of the touchscreen that fills its front
side, the lack of mechanical buttons, the sleek new inter

face regarded as the next quantum leap in cell-phone de
sign. My pulse quickened as I contemplated the breath
taking unity of its software. I think I began to sweat. I
don't remember being so excited since the first time I
watched Internet porn. As usual, my only objection was
the price. At $499 for the four-gigabyte version and $599
for the eight-gigabyte version, I might be better off pros
tituting my hypothetical girlfriend for the money to buy
one.
I used to secretly envy Black Berry users for owning
the ultimate indicator of success, but not anymore. The

chosen sidekick of the corporate elite looks downright
obsolete next to the elegance of the iPhone. In fact, 1
think Apple's new product ought to he a license to
shame anyone who types on the tiny, awkward keys of
a conventional PDA. I shiver with excitement to think
of how the smug expressions of thousands of Black-
Berry owners be must falling at this very moment, to
be replaced only by the dread of knowing that yester
day's hallmark of sophistication has become today's
alternative for people who can't afford Apple prod
ucts. Luckily for them, the iPhone won't be available

until June.
At any rate, the i Phone has finally motivated me to get
a campus job, something I ve been alternately too busy or
too lazy to do since I arrived here last year. I have never
wanted an electronic device as badly as 1 want the
i Phone. To me, it would be the ideal companion. It's sex
ier than most women, it can be bought with money, and it
can never give you an STD.
