## SHOW OF STRENGTH Card dominates in 77-56 win 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
The No. 10 women's basketball team faced
its top Pac-10 competition at the Bank of Amer
ica Arena in Seattle last night, squaring off
against Washington. But with a dominating 77-
56 win, Stanford proved that the nearest compe
tition still has plenty of catching up to do.
The Cardinal (13-3, 6-0 Pac-10) extended
their winning-streak to 11 games.The streak was
highlighted by a close 77-71 victory over then-
No. 10 Arizona State and a decisive 69-54 win
over then-No. 21 California, leaving Stanford as
the only undefeated team in the Pac-10.
The Huskies were coming off a successful
streak of their own, having won nine of their
past 10 games, with the only loss in that span
dealt to them by No. 11 Arizona State, 88-83.
Playing at home, Washington was expected to
provide tough competition for Stanford.
Instead, the Cardinal whipped up a 10-2 run
to start the game and left the Huskies struggling
to catch up. Eleven straight points by freshman
forward Jayne Appel closed out the half, leaving
Stanford up 41-28. Appel scored 15 of her 19
game total points in just the last 4:37 of the half.
In the second half, the Cardinal extended the
lead to as much as 29 points, scoring the first 10
points of the half. The Huskies couldn't make
their way inside against Stanford's post players,
and, although they were able to recover some
what, still lost by a decisive 21 points.
Contributing to Stanford's immense win,
junior guard Candice Wiggins had the fourth
double-double of her career with 17 points and
10 rebounds. Senior forward Brooke Smith
nearly had her own double-double with 12
points and 9 rebounds.

NOTES: Stanford's winning streak is now at 1 1 games,
the longest since a 23-game stretch in 2004-05 and
one of 1 7 double-digit winning streaks in program his
tory. After attempting just one free throw in the previous
three games combined, Brooke Smith was 4-4 in her
chances at the foul line tonight. Stanford held a com
manding 50-22 edge in points in the paint.
Meanwhile, Appel recorded yet another big
performance, leading the Cardinal with 19points.
She also notched eight rebounds. Freshman
guard JJ I iones had her third double-digit scor
ing performance with 10 points. Overall, Stan
ford had four players score in double digits and
28 points off the bench, displaying the depth
Stanford has been striving for rather than the
sole power of the Wiggins-Smith duo.
