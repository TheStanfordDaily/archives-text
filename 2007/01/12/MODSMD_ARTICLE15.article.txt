## SHOW OF STRENGTH Card dominates in 77-56 win 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
The No. 10 women's basketball team faced
its top Pac-10 competition at the Bank of Amer
ica Arena in Seattle last night, squaring off
against Washington. But with a dominating 77-
56 win, Stanford proved that the nearest compe
tition still has plenty of catching up to do.
The Cardinal (13-3, 6-0 Pac-10) extended
their winning-streak to 11 games.The streak was
highlighted by a close 77-71 victory over then-
No. 10 Arizona State and a decisive 69-54 win
over then-No. 21 California, leaving Stanford as
the only undefeated team in the Pac-10.
The Huskies were coming off a successful
streak of their own, having won nine of their
past 10 games, with the only loss in that span
dealt to them by No. 11 Arizona State, 88-83.
Playing at home, Washington was expected to
provide tough competition for Stanford.
Instead, the Cardinal whipped up a 10-2 run
to start the game and left the Huskies struggling
to catch up. Eleven straight points by freshman
forward Jayne Appel closed out the half, leaving
Stanford up 41-28. Appel scored 15 of her 19
game total points in just the last 4:37 of the half.
In the second half, the Cardinal extended the
lead to as much as 29 points, scoring the first 10
points of the half. The Huskies couldn't make
their way inside against Stanford's post players,
and, although they were able to recover some
what, still lost by a decisive 21 points.
Contributing to Stanford's immense win,
junior guard Candice Wiggins had the fourth
double-double of her career with 17 points and
10 rebounds. Senior forward Brooke Smith
nearly had her own double-double with 12
points and 9 rebounds.

Stanford has been striving for rather than the
sole power of the Wiggins-Smith duo.
