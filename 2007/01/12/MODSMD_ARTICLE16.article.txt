### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After an extended hiatus, the No. 9 Stan
ford men's tennis team will return to competi

tion today at the Sherwood Cup held in West
lake Village, Calif. Although the Cardinal last
took the court in team competition in Novem
ber against the University of Hawaii, the first
event of this quarter is an individual tourna
ment.
Stanford will be sending seven players to
compete in the singles draw of 32, and three
Cardinal pairs will participate in the doubles
draw of 16. Other schools competing in the
Sherwood Cup include top teams such as No. 2

Baylor, No. 4 UCLA, No. 10 Pcpperdine and
Southern California.
In 2006, sophomore Malt Bruch advanced
to the 112 inals of both the singles and the doubles
draw before eventually falling to players from
Baylor and Florida State. His teammate and
doubles partner, .lames Pade, advanced to the
semifinals before falling to Bruch.
Last year's performance showed marked
improvement over Stanford's past results in
the tournament.The Cardinal were able to ad-

vancc three players past the first-round last
year, improving the team's first-round record
to 5-15 over the past three years. Prior to that,
the team had only won two first-round match
es to 10 dropped matches in the previous two
years.
Head C oach John Whitlinger does not attribute the ditli
cult\ Stanford has had with the first-round to the fact that the
tournament is held the very first weekend of school.
I don't want to use that as an excuse." Whitlinger said.
"Everybody's in that same boat. Our focus and goal down
there to just get a little better every day and just get match
es in. We need to figure out what we do well and what we need
to work on."
Stanford will send seniors Eric Mckean and Dave Ryan,
sophomores Blake Muller and .left Zeller and Ireshmen
Kevin Kaiser. Paul Morrissey and Richard Wire to compete
in the singles draw. McKean and Wire made the strongest
showings for Stanford at the 11 A Northwest Regional back in
C )ctober. Both advanced to the final 16 before narrowly drop
ping tight three-setters.
McKean and Wire, Kaiser and Zeller and Morrissey and
Muller will form the three doubles teams. Morrissey and
Muller checked into the most recent ITA rankings at No. 32.
Ihe pair advanced to the finals of their first tournament to
gether in October at the ITA Northwest Regional.
While Stanford has struggled in recent years to pick up the
doubles point. Whitlinger is optimistic about the potential for
doubles pairings this year.
"[Assistant C oach Dave Hodge and I] are really excited
about our doubles this year," Whitlinger said. "We've got a
bunch of guvs who can play doubles. We just have to ligure
out the right combinations and maybe do some switching
around during the year.
"We're going to have a few teams that are a little untest
ed. but we had an untested team get to the finals ot the 111 A
Northwest] Regional." Whitlinger continued. "Blake and
Paul had a really good win over [Alex] Slovic and [Daniel]
( Tui of Washington. We've got a lot of options, and we re re
ally looking forward to doubles this year."
Following this weekend's competition in the Sherwood
Cup, Stanford will not waste any time before jumping into its
dual match season. The Cardinal take on Boise State on Jan.
27 in the first home match of 2007 before traveling to Los An
geles to face the Bruins and the Trojans. A week later, the
team flies to Waco to take on Baylor before competing in the
National Team Indoors later that week.
"We're definitely hitting the ground running," Whitlinger
said. "Guys are really looking forward to it and can't wait to
get going."
