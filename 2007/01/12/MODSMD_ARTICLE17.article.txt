## Desert looms tough for Cardinal 
### SARA NORMINGTON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 ranked women's swimming and
diving team hopes to continue its winning
streak in meets against Arizona and Arizona
State this weekend. After a six-week break
from competition, the Cardinal will open
their Pacific 10 Conference season with
meets against the N0.5 Wildcats today and
the No. 23 Sun Devils tomorrow.
Arizona looks to he tough competition,as
it heads into the meet with a 5-0 record. The
Cardinal (6-0) and Wildcats last faced each
other at the Texas Invitational (Nov. 30
through Dec. 2) as Stanford finished second
to Arizona by 104 points.
"Arizona is one of the teams rated as a
possible NCAA champion this year," Stan
ford head coach Lea Maurer said. "They are
a formidable opponent, and we know it is
going to be a tough assignment."
Recently, the Arizona swimmers have
been making waves in the national scene. In
the latest NCAA top-times list, five different
swimmers appear in the top times ol 11 dif
ferent events. The Wildcats are especially
strong in the 50- and 100-yard sprint events,
which will play a key role in the relays at the
meet.
"Arizona is really strong in sprints so we
really need to go out there and race them and
not concede anything." Maurer said.
Arizona State enters the competition
with a 4-3 record. Most recently, the Sun

Women's swimming and diving will look to stay hot in the desert, as
they travel to face the Sun Devils and Wildcats. The Cardinal have
swept the Arizona schools in each of the past two seasons.
Devils picked up their first Pac-10
victory as they defeated Oregon
State 180-82 on Saturday.
As usual. Maurer is keeping this
weekend's meets in perspective.
"I'm not worried about the out
come of the meets as much as how we
go up against Arizona." Maurer said.
"We just need to be confident, and. il
they beat us. make them earn it."
Last season, Stanford beat both
Arizona and Arizona State at home,
and swept both teams on the road in
2005.
The Cardinal have not competed
since Dec. 2, but Maurer is less con
cerned about the team's break from
meets than about its recent intense
training.
"The Arizona meet is one week
earlier in our schedule this year and
one week closer to Christmas train
ing, so we are going in a little tired."
Maurer said.
Although the Cardinal have not

competed recently, its successful
swimmers have continued to draw at
tention. I reshman Julia Smit was
named the Pac-10 Swimmer of the
Month for November, and senior
Cassidy Krug picked up the same
honor for diving. Krug was also one of
male and female divers invited to
attend the second of two 2007 World
Championship selection camps. The
camp will he held Jan. 21-25 at the In
diana University Natatorium in Indi
anapolis. Ind.
Krug is looking forward to getting
hack into competition and going up
against a strong Pac-10 opponent.
"This weekend. I'm looking for
ward to developing my competition
skills." she said."l'm going to tiKus on
hitting my dives and making specific
corrections on dives."
Krug sees this first meet of 2007 as
an opportunity for the team to kick
off Pac-10 competition with a strong
performance.
"It's exciting that this is our first
Pac-10 meet, and 1 think the team has
a good chance of doing pretty well
this weekend." she said. "After our
break, we are fresh and ready to go."
