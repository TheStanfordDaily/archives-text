# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Series of firsts in store for volleyball 
### JOE KAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
'ITiis weekend will be matches
of firsts for the Stanford men's
volleyball team. It will be their
first match of the year at home,
their first Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation regular season
match and. hopefully. John
kosty's first win as a head coach.
Stanford will play Cat State-
Northridge tonight at 7 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion. Tomorrow
evening they will face UC-Santa
Barbara at 5 p.m. in Burnham
Pavilion.
The Cardinal's first three
matches at the Elephant Bar

Tournament last weekend did
not go as the team hoped. Hie
squad lost in three consecutive
matches to UC-Irvine, Long
Beach State and USC. I lowever,
Stanford did show signs of im
provement. After getting swept
3-0 by UC-Irvine in its first
match, it lost 3-2 to the 49ers and
the Trojans in hard-fought
matches.
Kosty feels that the team
needs to mature and develop
rather than put wins on the
scoreboard and says that his first
wins will come with time.
"It's much more important to
grow as a team." Kosty said. "This
team has a very bright future, and
wins are going to come."
Several competitions for starting
spots have started to emerge on the
team. Freshman Garret Werner and
sophomore Cameron Christotfers
both played well this past weekend
in the tournament. Both are battling
to earn the starting middle blocker
spot alongside sophomore Brandon
Williams.
Probably the most interesting in
tersquad rivalry is between two
freshmen battling it out for the start
ing opposite hitter spot. Evan
Romero has extreme athletic ability
to go along with his 6-foot-6 frame.
However, his technique — both of
fensive and defensive — needs re
finement. Meanwhile, 6-foot-7 fresh
man Ed 1 lowell is more experienced
and knowledgeable about the sport.
The Cardinal underclassmen's
first game to showcase their skills
will be against Jeff Campbell's
Northridge team. Northridge went
1-2 in the UCSB tournament, their
only victory coming in a narrow 3-2
win over L.ong Beach.
"Northridge is young like us,"
Kosty explained. "They're going
through some growing pains like we
are — I see that match as a dog
fight."
"They're really scrappy," junior
outside hitter Matt Ceran contin
ued. Ceran played middle blocker
for the last two years, but with the
graduation of Ben Reddy and
William Clayton, his assets have
proven valuable in both the passing
and hitting aspects of the game.
Junior outside hitter Isaac
Kneubuhl leads the attack for the
Matadors. Their setter is junior
Travis Bluemling.
Northridge also boasts, from all
recorded accounts, the tallest college
volleyball player in the country — 7-
foot-2 freshman middle blocker
Jacek Ratajczak. But when asked

Maples Pavilion on Friday, January 12

about Ratajczak. the Stanford coach
shrugged him off.
"There are very few teams in our
league that can beat you with one
player," Kosty explained. "I'm not
worried about a player in particular.
I'm worried about the other team as
a whole."
On Saturday, the Cardinal faces
29-year veteran coach Ken Preston's
UCSB squad. The Gauchos' main
weapon is Evan Patak, a fifth-year
senior outside hitter, who, during his
sophomore season, had 48 kills for a
total 53 points against the Cardinal
— a Division I and II rally scoring
era record.
"The key is to control Patak,"
Kosty finished. "He's going to get his
kills. We can't let him light it up and
hit .500. But we've got to control
him.The key part is to hold [Patak]
under his season average. If we can
do that, we're going to have a suc
cessful season."
