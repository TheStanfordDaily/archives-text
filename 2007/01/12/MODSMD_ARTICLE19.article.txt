## Parity, props for Pac-10 
### 
From top to bottom, there isn't a
better conference in college
basketball than our very own
Pac-10. After years of mediocrity,
both in the regular season and in the
NCAA Tournament, the Pac-10 is fi
nally the best conference in college
basketball. 1 take a lot of pleasure in
saying this, having been an avid fan of
the conference for most of my life.
The facts are there. The confer
ence has the highest ranking accord
ing to the computers, has featured the
No. 1 team in the country for most of
the season to date, and has five teams
in the top 25 of the USA Today
Coaches' Poll.
Aside from these things, though,
the parity of the conference is re
markable.
After the first two weeks of con
ference play, there aren't any unde
feated teams. Not one of the confer
ence's ten teams was able to go 4-0.
liven UCLA, which breezed through
its non-league schedule with victories
over such highly regarded national
programs as Kentucky, Georgia Tech
and Texas A&M. couldn't get out of
the first two weeks unscathed.
Arizona, aware of UCLA's loss at
Oregon, had a fleeting chance to take
sole possession of first place this past
Saturday. They had no such luck
against Washington State, which was
freshly anointed a top 25 team after
years of mediocrity in the Northwest.
Arizona's loss left us with a four-way
tie for first place in the Pac-10 be
tween Washington State, Arizona,
USC and UCLA.
Seriously, what's going on'.'
The Pac-10 is a heckuva confer
ence, that's what. But what's behind
this sudden surge in the power of
West Coast hoops?
It starts with the coaches.There re
ally isn't a weak spot anywhere in the
conference. From Ben Howland to
Tim Floyd to Lute Olson to Herb
Sendek to Washington State's up
and-comingTony Bennett, the Pac-10
boasts the best collection of basket
ball coaches in the country. Even guys
like Ben Braun and our own Trent
Johnson who head teams that appear
to be in the lower echelon of the con
ference have proven track records.
You also have to look at the expe
rience that pervades the conference.
While players from a team such as
Ohio State are still getting their feet
wet after their first few months of col
lege basketball, the Pac-10 has a
plethora of players with extensive ex
perience under their belts.
Oregon is flourishing under the
experience of their senior point
guard Aaron Brooks, UCLA is con
tinuing its dominance under sea
soned veteran Arron Afflalo and Ari
zona has plenty of experience and
ability in guys like Mustafa Shakur
and Ivan Radenovic.
This is the year of the Pac. Forget
the ACC. the SEC and even the Big
Ten. They all have their individual
standout teams, but none of them has
the depth that the Pac-10 possesses
all the way through.
In fact. I'd go so far as to say that
the Pac-10 will get six teams into the
NCAA Tournament this year.
It sounds crazy and farfetched at
first.but think about it.
UCLA. Arizona. Washington and
Oregon are locks. UCLA and Ari
zona don't need explaining. They
both have the firepower and the kind
of experience needed to compete for
the national championship. Washing
ton is still shaky with a current Pac-10
record of 1 -4. but they have tot) much
talent with players like Spencer
Hawes and Jon Brockman not to
make the Big Dance. Oregon is a
one-loss team, ranked in the top 20.

and has good wins over programs
like Georgetown, and. oh. the num
ber one team in the nation. UCLA.
As for the other two teams. Wash
ington State and USC are definitely
strong prospects.
Washington State is now ranked
in the top 25 for the first time in for
ever. They only have two losses this
season, have already beaten a top ten
Arizona team and took UCLA to the
ropes at Pauley Pavilion. As for the

Trojans. Tim Floyd has revived the
program with the help of Freshman
Center Taj Gibson. USC has looked
impressive after the first two weeks
of conference play.
It's pretty clear to me that both of
these teams are legitimate con
tenders for at-large bids to the Big
Dance in March.
Even the lower teams in the con
ference like. well. us. have had strong
performances. Stanford gave Ari

zona all they could handle at McKale
Center, and got a great non-confer
ence road victory over Virginia. As
far as I'm concerned, any Pac-10
team is a good team.
In case you couldn't tell. I really
like West Coast basketball — maybe
even a little too much. Lonti live the
Pac-10.
