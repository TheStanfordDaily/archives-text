### HEATHER HEISTAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a move that earned him a standing
ovation from the Faculty Senate at the
end of last quarter. President Hennessy
announced a new pilot program to give
all tenured and tenure-track humanities
faculty $5,(H)() yearly grants to cover re
search costs.
"Faculty in other areas have access to
outside grants, but in the humanities

that's not the case," said Stephanie
kalfayan, vice provost for academic af
fairs. "President 1 iennessy wanted to
make it possible for faculty to travel to
conferences, conduct fieldwork.and visit
archives without worrying about the
cost."
While faculty in the sciences can and
often do receive research funding from
sources outside the University, humani
ties professors are often left footing their
own hills. President Hennessy's move —
hailed by Kalfayan as "really unprece
dented" — was a welcome gift for many
professors.
"The President's marvelous support
for research in the humanities opens

fresh opportunities for Stanford's out
standing faculty to bring new ideas to
students and to the public," said I listory
Prof. John Bender, director of the Stan
ford I lumanities Center.
While Columbia University provides
its humanities faculty with $1,750
stipends, funding of any kind is uncom
mon in the humanities departments of
most universities, and Stanford's base of
$5,000 is novel.
With 15 departments in the humani
ties and over 200 tenured or tenure-track
professors, the grants are certain to fund
a wide range of research on topics rang

Springer called the new funding
"very welcome indeed," and said she

own grant to attend international
conferences — important research
opportunities with expenses that she
has sometimes paid out of pocket in

In the English Department. Dr.
Sianne Ngai.a professor of American
literature, said that her work with
twentieth-century literature lends it
self to more theoretical writing and

doesn't require much travel to for

Speaking on behalf of her col
leagues, though, she said it can be a
serious financial burden to visit Russ
ian archives or to gain access to liter
ary estates.

humanities are usually faced with
greater challenges for finding fund
ing than their colleagues in the sci
ences." she said. "You'd be surprised
how expensive it is to quote poems in
