## Talented Card ready for duals 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Although the Cardinal have
been back in the Bay Area for
awhile now, tonight will be the first
chance for many Stanford fans to
see a dual meet this season, as the
squad takes on San Francisco State
in the first home dual of the season
following winter break tonight in
Burnham Pavilion.
While Stanford's season to date
has been frustratingly inconsistent,
coach Kerry McCoys team never
theless boasts two nationally
ranked wrestlers in juniors Tanner

Gardner at 125 pounds and Josh
Zupancicat 157 pounds at No. 4 and
No. 16 respectively. Gardner, who
earned All-American honors last
season, enters the dual as the high
est ranked wrestler in the Pac-10.
Gardner and Zupancic will look
to lead the way in helping their team
to rebound from several disappoint
ing early season showings, capped
most recently at the inaugural Stan
ford Duals. Hie Cardinal went 0-3
against No. 23 Lehigh, Columbia,
and conference rival IJC-Davis,
winning only eight of 30 individual
