### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Although the Cardinal have
been back in the Bay Area for
awhile now, tonight will be the first
chance for many Stanford fans to
see a dual meet this season, as the
squad takes on San Francisco State
in the first home dual of the season
following winter break tonight in
Burnham Pavilion.
While Stanford's season to date
has been frustratingly inconsistent,
coach Kerry McCoys team never
theless boasts two nationally
ranked wrestlers in juniors Tanner

Gardner at 125 pounds and Josh
Zupancicat 157 pounds at No. 4 and
No. 16 respectively. Gardner, who
earned All-American honors last
season, enters the dual as the high
est ranked wrestler in the Pac-10.

to lead the way in helping their team
to rebound from several disappoint
ing early season showings, capped
most recently at the inaugural Stan

SAN FRANCISCO STATE
{1-7,1-0 RMAC)
Maples Pavilion 7:00 PM
NOTES: San Francisco State (1 -7, 1 -0
RMAC) is led by Kenneth Packard (157
pounds) who has collected 92 team
points this season. Virgil lockett (141
pounds) leads the team in wins by fall (3)
and Ali Lockett (149 pounds) is the only
Gator with a winning record in 2006-07
matches.
McCoy's early season strategy has
been to expose his wrestlers to the
highest level of competition possible
against non-conference opponents.
I le hopes both to prepare his team for
the Pac-10 schedule and give those
who advance to the NCAA Champi
onships a chance to see their possible
opponents.
"Our guys have been working re
ally hard," McCoy said. "Just about
everyone on our team has wrestled 20
matches so far. and we're definitely
improved. Given the schedule we've
wrestled so far maybe that hasn't
shown itself as much yet. but going
into February that hard work should
start to pay off."
The Cardinal will face the less
than-dominant Gators who went 0-14
last season and are off to a 1 -7 start
this year, with their lone win coming
against Mesa State on Jan. 4. Stanford
won seven of 10 matches against SI
State last season, en route to a 30-9
road win. Nevertheless, McCoy was
adamant that his team needed to re
main focused to earn a win.
"We want our guys to work hard,
no matter who they're competing
against," McCoy said."[San Francisco
State] may not be a powerhouse, but

thcv still have some good guys in that
lineup."
Kenneth Packard leads the Gators
in team points this season and is their
only wrestler who has faced a Cardi
nal opponent this season. Zupancic
posted a 15-0 victory over Packard at
the Las Vegas Invitational on Dec. 1.
()ther solid contributors for SF State
include Ali and Ben Lockett at 149
and 133 pounds, respectively, who
have each scored 73 points for the
Gators.
ITie Cardinal face a relatively light
schedule in January', which McCoy
hopes will give his team a chance to
recover after their heavily stacked
early season schedule. After taking on
the Gators, Stanford will travel to Cal
State Bakersfield on Jan. 21. before
rounding out their competition for
the month when they host Menlo Col
lege on Jan. 27. McCoy's squad will
then face six Pac-10 opponents in just
over two weeks of competition in
February.
"The way the schedule worked
out was by design." McCoy said. "The
plan was to front-load the schedule so
that we'd be wrestling against strong
opponents we wouldn't get to see
otherwise during our conference
competition. Then in January we
wanted to give our guys the chance to
recover and get ready for a late sea
son push."

(iators tonight is set to begin at 7 p.m.
in Burnham Pavilion.
