# BUSINESS
## Students jump into e-business Fall quarter class requires participants to construct viable online enterprise 
### CLAY BAVINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last fall. Management Science
and Engineering Prof. Ashish Goel
charged the students in his Internet
commerce course with a task that
still eludes Silicon Valley elites: to
create a profitable Internet-based
business.
Giving students 10 weeks to do
what business leaders spend years
pursuing, Goel did not allow much
time for the groups to create their
company's Web site, advertise to po
tential customers and sell their

product or service. Students' grades
were largely based on the revenues
and profits their companies made
and the business strategies they
crafted.
Since groups could only sink
$250 into their company — and
much of that into advertising —
they could not "make"a product. In
stead, groups tried to sell a service
or a very cheap product, such as t
shirts.
Tommy Leep. a co-terminal stu
dent better known as the Stanford
Tree, created with his group Stan
fordtree.com, a Web site featuring a
periodic blog about the Stanford
mascot. At the site, people could read
about daily happenings of the Tree
and also buy several variations of
Stanford Tree t-shirts.
Another group in the class creat
ed the business Our Shelves.com,
which enabled students to buv and

sell textbooks with others on cam
pus.
Junior Molly Goldstein, an eco
nomics major who worked on the
Our Shelves.com project, said, "In
stead of waiting weeks to get your
used textbooks in the mail, all the
books on Our Shelves.com are just a
bike ride away."
A third group created a site which
rated mp3 players. By setting up an
Amazon Associates account, the
group made a small commission each
time someone bought an mp3 player
on Amazon after viewing the ratings
site.
In addition. Professor Goel in
structed the students on many of the
technical properties of the Internet.
"The most interesting thing about
the class," Leep said, "was learning
that the Google algorithm for search
results hinges on non-Euclidean
geometry."
