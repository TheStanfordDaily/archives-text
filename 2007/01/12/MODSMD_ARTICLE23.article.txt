## Google to assist telescope project Web company will make astronomy data public 
### CAMILA TAPERNOUX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Google announced plans last
week to join Stanford and 18 other
universities in the construction of a
telescope with a three-billion pixel
digital camera —the largest such
camera ever built — which will be
able to survey the entire visible sky
every three nights for a ten-year pe
riod when it is completed in 2013.
ITie Google partnership is intend
ed to organize and index the massive
amount of information generated by
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST). as well as process and ana
lyze data non-stop so that it can be
made available as soon as it is discov
ered. The data will not only aid scien

tists and astronomers but will also
provide a dynamic new view of the
night sky to the public.
"Google's mission is to take the
world's information and make it uni
versally accessible and useful," said
Google Vice President of Engineer
ing William Coughran in a statement.
" Ihe data from the LSST will be an
important part of this information,
and by being involved in the project
we hope to make it easier for that data
to become accessible and useful.
LSST Project Manager Donald
Sweeney said the effort signaled a
new era.
"Even though the universe is very
old,exciting things happen every sec
ond," he said in a press release. "The
LSST will be able to find these events
hundreds of times better than
today's other big telescopes. Google
will help us organize and present the
seemingly overwhelming volumes of
data collected bv the LSST."

The telescope will use a color
mapping technique to provide a
movie-like view of rapidly changing
objects, such as exploding super
novae and potentially hazardous as
teroids. The camera approximate
ly the size of an SUV — will provide
images of a few billion galaxies, and
an equal number of stars, said Physics
Prof. Steven Kahn.who serves as the
deputy project director and camera
scientist for the I.SS I project.
"I.SST will provide valuable in
sight into the history of cosmic ex
pansion. from the Big Bang to the
present," Kahn said.
Ilie LSST Corporation was formed
in 2(X)3 by the University of Arizona
and the University of Washington as a
non-profit.lhe project has grown to re
ceive the support of 17 other universi
ties. including Stanford, and numerous
private parties. As a public-private part
nership. the data gathered by the proj
ect will be made available to the public.
