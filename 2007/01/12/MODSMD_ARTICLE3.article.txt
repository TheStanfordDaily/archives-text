"It was a great way to come out and finish
the game no matter what," sophomore guard
Anthony Goods said. "The last two games,
we've been able to do that."
Stanford exorcised its free throw demons
with three clutch foul shots down the stretch.
Goods, fouled by Washington guard Ryan Ap
pleby with 27 seconds to go, swished a pair of
freebies to put the Cardinal ahead 77-75, and
junior forward Taj l inger scored his only point
with eight seconds left to give Stanford a 78-75
lead.Those shots all proved necessary, as Wash
ington forward Jon Brockman (game-high 23
points and 10 rebounds) tipped in Phil Nelsons
three-point airball with 0.2 seconds to play.
"This win feels exhausting," said Goods.
"I'm tired. I'mcramping.They're a great team;
it was great to get the win."
Sophomore forward Lawrence Hill
stripped wunderkind freshman Spencer
Hawes, drew a foul on a drive to his left and
rattled in a 12-foot jumper to tie the game at
74-74 with 40 seconds to go. 11 ill made the sub
sequent free throw, then Quincy Pondexter,
Lopez's former high school teammate, split a
pair to tie the game at 75 with 29 seconds left.
"They hurt us with their penetration and
dishing off, there's no question about it and we
were our own worst enemy down the stretch,"
Washington Coach Lorenzo Romar said. "We
didn't play smart."
Washington used a 15-4 run to take a 56-51
lead with 13 minutes to go and pushed their
lead to 71-66 with under six minutes to play.
"At crucial times I thought our defense was
good," Johnson said. "But there was a period
there where I didn't know if we could get
stops."
But Stanford's defense stiffened and the

Cardinal clawed their way back into (he game.
They held the Huskies scoreless for over four
minutes, and Goods' two free throws put the
(Cardinal ahead 72-71 with 2:30 to go.
"When things are down, if we keep push
ing. it we keep playing hard, things will work
out," said freshman Robin Lopez (17 points).
The victory marked Stanford's 14th
straight at home over the Huskies, who have
emerged as a Pac-10 power in recent years.
The victory also put an end to Stanford's

shooting struggles at Maples — while Stan
ford had scored under 60 points in three pre
vious home contests on abysmal shooting, the
Cardinal shot a hearty 60 percent in the first
half and 54.5 percent (30-of-55) on the game.
"We just came out and shot the ball with
confidence," Goods said. "The coaches have
been stressing living in the moment and not
worrying about the past."

Four Cardinal players finished
with double digit scoring totals.
Goods scored 19, including 13 in the
game's first 8:17, Hill added 18 on 7-
of-13 shooting, Robin Lopez scored
17 on 8-of-12 shooting and brother
Brook Lopez poured in 12 with 6-of-8
accuracy.
"It's nice to play well at home,"
Coach Trent Johnson said. "We beat a
really, really good team. It's a big win
for us."
The much-heralded battle between
the Lopez twins and Washington's
Hawes and Brockman lived up to its
hype. Brockman led all scorers with his
double-double, but Robin Lopez had
more success against Hawes. Hawes
managed just six points on 3-of-12
shooting, though he did grab eight re
bounds.
"Spencer's very talented offensive
ly, and Jon. he's just relentless on the
boards," Robin Lopez said. "It kind of
shows you the importance of re
bounding. the number of putbacks he
had. It shows me some things 1 need to
work on."
Johnson pardoned his defense for
Brockman's big night.

" Jon's been playing like that since
he was five years old." he said. "Break
downs arc going to occur when you're
playing teams of that caliber. Unfortu
nately for us, there are a lot of teams in
this conference of that caliber."
"Stanford's going to be really
good." Romar said. "The Lopez twins
made an impact on the game, there's
no doubt about it. We knew that Stan
ford was going to have its day in the
Pac-10, and they're going to keep get
ting better and better."
Next for the Cardinal is an equally
feisty Washington State team. Tradi
tionally a Pac-10 doormat, the Cougars
are suddenly 14-2 and nationally
ranked under first-year head coach
Tony Bennett, son of longtime head
man Dick.
"We just beat the 25th-ranked
team in the country." Johnson said.
"Now we have the 23rd. They're a
team that at Pac-10 media day, people
thought they'd be down, but never in
my mind. They don't have the great
athletes so to speak, but they're posi
tion conscious."
Stanford hosts Washington State
Saturday in Maples Pavilion at 4 p.m.
