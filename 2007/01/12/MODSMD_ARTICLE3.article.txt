"It was a great way to come out and finish
the game no matter what," sophomore guard
Anthony Goods said. "The last two games,
we've been able to do that."
Stanford exorcised its free throw demons
with three clutch foul shots down the stretch.
Goods, fouled by Washington guard Ryan Ap
pleby with 27 seconds to go, swished a pair of
freebies to put the Cardinal ahead 77-75, and
junior forward Taj l inger scored his only point
with eight seconds left to give Stanford a 78-75
lead.Those shots all proved necessary, as Wash
ington forward Jon Brockman (game-high 23
points and 10 rebounds) tipped in Phil Nelsons
three-point airball with 0.2 seconds to play.
"This win feels exhausting," said Goods.
"I'm tired. I'mcramping.They're a great team;
it was great to get the win."
Sophomore forward Lawrence Hill
stripped wunderkind freshman Spencer
Hawes, drew a foul on a drive to his left and
rattled in a 12-foot jumper to tie the game at
74-74 with 40 seconds to go. 11 ill made the sub
sequent free throw, then Quincy Pondexter,
Lopez's former high school teammate, split a
pair to tie the game at 75 with 29 seconds left.
"They hurt us with their penetration and
dishing off, there's no question about it and we
were our own worst enemy down the stretch,"
Washington Coach Lorenzo Romar said. "We
didn't play smart."
Washington used a 15-4 run to take a 56-51
lead with 13 minutes to go and pushed their
lead to 71-66 with under six minutes to play.
"At crucial times I thought our defense was
good," Johnson said. "But there was a period
there where I didn't know if we could get
stops."
But Stanford's defense stiffened and the

Cardinal clawed their way back into (he game.
They held the Huskies scoreless for over four
minutes, and Goods' two free throws put the
(Cardinal ahead 72-71 with 2:30 to go.
"When things are down, if we keep push
ing. it we keep playing hard, things will work
out," said freshman Robin Lopez (17 points).
The victory marked Stanford's 14th
straight at home over the Huskies, who have
emerged as a Pac-10 power in recent years.
The victory also put an end to Stanford's

shooting struggles at Maples â€” while Stan
ford had scored under 60 points in three pre
vious home contests on abysmal shooting, the
Cardinal shot a hearty 60 percent in the first
half and 54.5 percent (30-of-55) on the game.
"We just came out and shot the ball with
confidence," Goods said. "The coaches have
been stressing living in the moment and not
worrying about the past."
