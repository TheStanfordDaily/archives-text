### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION FILM SNOB 
Typically, 1 try to contain my cxcitemcnt about film to
exuberant dinner table conversations and heated debates,
but every once in a while (just about once a year, in fact),
there comes a time to compile a "Best Of" list for the past
year. If you disagree with any of the choices presented
herein or if you feel that a film was omitted, please remem
ber that there were far too many films to fit in a top ten list
and that we are cold to your pleas.
"Brick" (March)
Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in this neo-noir indie that
seamlessly combines the seemingly incongruous conven-

tions of the noir genre and the high school drama. What
might initially sound like grounds for a successful comedy
ends up as one of the most engaging, clever films of the
year, with a jargon so unique that the adolescent sleuth
sounds like a veritable Sam Spade. Subtle references to
noir films like "The Maltese Falcon" and a dark humor ex
tremely suitable to the roughness of high school make the
mystery in "Brick" as satisfying as its resolution.
"United 93" (April)
While some feel that making a film about the events of
September 11th is simply Hollywood's way of capitalizing
on a national tragedy, "United 93" forsakes weighty politi
cal implications in favor of a humanist approach, one full of
fear and confusion in the face of truly frightening circum
stances. Set in real time aboard the fourth plane intended

for an unknown target, Paul Greengrass
constructs a film more about humanity at
its most desperate rather than an inflam
matory call to arms against terrorism.
"A Scanner Darkly" (July)
Philip K. Dick has fueled the fires of sci
ence fiction cinema for a considerable part
of the last few decades. Though this film is
hindered slightly by a somewhat schizo
phrenic plot and a crutch named Keanu,
"A Scanner Darkly" is a cinematic graphic
novel filled with paranoid delusions, drug
induced visuals and an underlying warning
that is gorgeously envisioned with an eye
squarely pinned on the imaginative.

"Little Miss Sunshine" (July)
A gay suicidal Proust scholar, an
honesty-obsessed mother, a failed mo
tivational speaker father, a porn/drug

addict grandfather, a Nietzsche-reading mute teenager
and a girl named Olive Hoover. All in a canary yellow
VW bus with a broken clutch on the way to a beauty
pageant. 1 don't know about you, but I'm sold. This lit
tle film that captured the audiences at Sundance with its
sometimes morbid sense of humor and unexpected op
timism will undoubtedly receive a few nods in awards
season and deservedly so. Vacillating between incredi
bly touching to gut-bustingly hilarious, the film was one
of the few rays of sunshine (pardon the pun) in an oth
erwise dark and forgettable summer of blockbusters.
"The Illusionist" (August)
Despite its striking similarities to Christopher
Nolan's "The Prestige," Edward Norton pulls the veri
table rabbit from his hat and edged out his magical com
petition. Though the ending is reminiscent of Bryan
Singer's "The Usual Suspects." the film offers plenty of
ambiguity for discussion — does Eisenheim truly pos
sess supernatural abilities or is it all smoke and mirrors?
"The Departed" (October)
Mark my words — if Scorcese doesn't receive the
Best Director Oscar for this film, the universe is going
to implode. After being snubbed five times, putting him
in the same category as Alfred Hitchcock for number of
Oscar cold shoulders, Scorcese delivers a film less am
bitious than his previous two yet one that is vastly more

engaging. Crooked cops and straight crooks shine with
spectacular performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt
Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Jack Nicholson and yes, even
Alec Baldwin. Gritty, gory and fun, "The Departed" is
everything gangsters in "fahking" south Boston should be.
"Borat" (November)
Jagshemash! I like-ah this moviefilm. Who knew that
the most racist, intolerant, emotionally scarring (two
words: fight scene) movie would turn out to be the funniest
film of the year? Sasha Baron Cohen's bumbling Kazahk
stani reporter pokes a satirical stick at America's heartland
with a character so overtly anti-Semitic that Cohen's own
devotion to Judaism and his Cambridge education are un
recognizable behind that stupid grin and thick sexy time
moustache.

"Volver" (November)
Pedro Almod6var has always been known for films with
a strong sense of drama. The most famous Spanish director
since Luis Bunuel has created a film with both beautiful
cinematography and beautiful women. Salma Hayek stops
oozing sex with her thick Spanish accent in silly American
romantic comedies and steps back into her native tongue in
one of her best roles after "Frida." Coupled with Almodo
var's trademark painteresque use of color and his concerns
with women, you can certainly rank this among his other
films, "Talk to Her" and "All About my Mother."
"Casino Royale" (November)
After all the controversy surrounding Daniel Craig's
casting as the new Bond, everyone was expecting "Casino
Royale" to be a bigger bomb than "Heaven's Gate." Little
did they know that Craig would revitalize a franchise that
had sunk into ridiculous plots (movie moguls taking over
the world), absurd gadgets (an invisible car? Really?) and
lame villains (diamond-faced North Koreans) with a Bond
who wasn't suave but certainly sexy. Expect many more se
quels in the years to come.
"Children of Men" (December)
Director Alfonso Cuaron's dystopian view of a future
where mankind is unable to have children can only be de
scribed as hauntingly resonant. Disregarding the whole in
fertility angle, the film's Orwellian take on the year 2027
does something few movies in the age of mindless block
busters manage to pull off — it makes you think about the
world you live in. The film's commentary on humanity at its
worst is difficult to shake off.
"El Laberinto del Fauno" (Pan's Labyrinth) (December)
Without a doubt, Guillermo Del Toro's adult fairytale
set during the Spanish Civil War is a masterpiece. The di
rector best known for a film about a pancake-eating demon
("Hellboy"), weaves an enchanting tale about a young girl
coming to terms with the atrocities of war with pure imagi
nation. The fantastical landscapes, creepy mythological
references and horror movie elements are perfectly bal
anced with the film's bittersweet ending, making for a film
so beautiful that it is difficult not to cry when the credits
start rolling.
