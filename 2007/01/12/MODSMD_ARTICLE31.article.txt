## Shows you wish you'd Tivoed 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION RATINGS WATCHER 
"Top Ten" TV show lists do you a disservice. Right now,
with so many great shows of different kinds available on the
small screen, you'd need a list of at least 11 for it to be truly
sufficient. Fortunately, we've got you covered, with the 11
best shows of 2006 (the top three listed separately):
"24" —FOX
Season five of the Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland) story
began with a shocking murder and didn't let up for an entire
day's worth of intense action, political intrigue and twists and
turns every step of the way. The show's formula — explo
sions and traitors everywhere — remains the same the fifth
time around and the 24-hour real-time gimmick is almost an
afterthought, hut that "s just fine for the most exciting show on
TV.
"Heroes" —NBC
By far the most popular new show of this season, and the
one with the most potential. With a great ensemble cast, a va
riety of locations and several intriguing storylines weaving to
gether. this costumeless-superhero drama deserves its high
ratings. Not to mention, space-time traveler I liro Nakamura
(Masi Oka) is probably TV's most endearing new character.
"How 1 Met Your Mother" — CBS
The last good sitcom. In a genre increasingly loaded with
cliches, one-dimensional characters and shallow humor every
year. "Mother" came along with clever writing, an appealing
and talented cast and relationships you can really care about.
After just a few episodes, you'll come to love (and root for)

By far the funniest show
on TV. With the original
British series' shadow now
far behind. Steve Carell and
one of the best casts from top
to bottom set up the work
place perfectly, providing a
perfect balance of cringe-in
ducing realism and zany hi
larity. The ongoing saga of
Jim and Pani (John krasins
ki and Jenna Fischer) is the
most engrossing romantic
storyline you'll find on TV.
"Scrubs" — NBC
NBC's still-not-as-popu
lar-as-it-should-be screwball
comedy is going as strong as
ever, tightly traveling be
tween moments of humor
and tragedy on a weekly
basis. Every character on the
show is so well-defined yet
feels refreshingly unpre
dictable with each episode.

"The Shield" — FX
Capped off by its gut-wrenching season finale and the
death of a major character, this past season of "The Shield"
displayed the series' penchant for true grit imbued with high
drama theatricality more than any other. Michael Chiklis is
TV's best cop by a long shot, as the only one who will not only
threaten a noncompliant criminal but deliver the goods as

well. The high-energy se
ries is a slap to the face
that hurts so good.
"Studio 60 on the Sunset
Strip" —NBC
I las the makings of an
other "West Wing" for
series creator Aaron
Sorkin. but just misses
the mark. It's still a bril
liant show, with a smart
cast and an even smarter
writing team. So what if
the SNL-like show-with
in-a-show isn't actually
as funny as the charac
ters act like it is? It's not
like you have to watch it.
"The Wire" —HBO
HBO's best series, and
the one you're least like
ly to know about. The
coarse Baltimore-based
drug saga took an unex-

pected turn when it focused on a group of young school kids
for the fourth season, hut the change brought new life into a
show willing to go deeper and more relentlessly into the

The Top Three
"Battlestar Galactica" — Sci-Fi Channel
Yes, it's science fiction. They fly around in space ships.
There are talking robots. Don't let that prevent you from tak
ing in a series teeming with ingenious social and political com
mentary, compelling epic storylines and some of the most ex
citing action scenes put on film. Its only issue (if it is one) may
be that it spends too much time on being a brilliantly written
character drama and not enough time on the cool special ef
fects sequences.
"Dexter" — Showtime
Ot the more obscure shows on this list, this one probably
has you scratching your head the most. If so, go out and find
a way to watch it immediately. In its 12-episode first season
run, the show about a serial killer fighting his natural in
stincts to survive in (he normal world gave us one ol the most
tightly written and cohesive overarching storylines of all
time. Its protagonist, the title character, is not just morally
ambiguous, but morally vacant. Somehow, you'll find your
self sympathizing with him more often than not. Consistent
ly shocking and unpredictable, you owe it to yourself to see
this one.
"Veronica Mars" —The CW
While its move to "Girl's Night" on the new network may
have nudged it towards being the teen schlock-drama it's
perceived as, "Veronica Mars'" second season finale put a
cap on one ot the most mind-blowingly twisted and complex
series mysteries of all time. With snappy, clever dialogue in
every scenc and emotionally involving storylines that never
lail to intrigue, the show will draw you in and never let you
go. You can't just watch "Veronica Mars," you can only love
it.


everyone in the show.
"The Office" — NBC


urban narcotics industry than anything else ever broadcast,
where every character has a compelling story to tell.
