## ALBUMS THAT MADE OUR YEAR 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION MUSIC FIEND 
I hate the idea of ranking art, specifically
music. An album isn't a number; it means dif
ferent things to different people. But for this
article, I've tried to compile what I thought
were the 10 best albums of 2006. Of course, this
list is far from authoritative or comprehensive.
My tastes swing heavily towrd the realm of in
dependent music. But without further ado,
here are my top 10 albums of 2006, roughly as
cending from very, very good music at the top
of the list to absolutely great albums at the end.
"The Loon" — Tapes "n Tapes
Few bands seem to have as much fun as
Tapes 'n Tapes do in "The Loon." With lyrics
like "Leave me now in solitude and stress/I've
been a better lover with your mother," it's ob
vious that Tapes 'n Tapes are enjoying them
selves and aren't taking themselves too seri
ously. Of course, just because a band is having
fun doesn't mean the music they're making is
good, but the superb drums and bass of Tapes
'n Tapes make "The Loon" sound great.™
"The Greatest" — Cat Power
There's something intensely moving about
Chan Marshall's lyrics and passionate voice.
Take her groups stunning track, "Lived in
Bars," for example. Somehow, Marshall has
created a poignant song filled with the paradox
of upbeat sadness. The song, like all the others

on the album, is filled with an obvious emotion
that comes from Marshall's battle with alco
holism.
"Bang Bang Rock and Roll" — Art Brut
It seems obvious that a song with lyrics as
asinine as "we formed a band, look at us. we
formed a band," is going to be bad, but Eddie
Argos and Art Brut not only manage to pull off
the opening track of "Bang Bang Rock and
Roll," "Formed a Band," that not only doesn't
sound dumb, but also is filled with an infectious
energy. Art Brut's high-powered songs don't
have the brilliant lyrics of, say, the Decem
berists, but. nonetheless, Art Brut's music sim
ply rocks.
"St. Elsewhere" —.Gnarls Barkley
If the only song on "St. Elsewhere" you've
heard is the übiquitous single "Crazy." you're
missing out. There are other songs, such as
Gnarls's cover of "Gone Daddy Gone" that,
like "Crazy," are absolutely oozing with cool.
Gnarls have created u surprisingly varied and
genre-blending slick sound that's well worth
buying.
"The Life Pursuit" — Belle & Sebastian
Belle & Sebastian have departed from its
more organic sound to create "The Life Pur
suit," an album anchored by such solid songs as
"The Blues arc Still Blue" and "Sukie in the
Graveyard." "The Life Pursuit" is far more
sunny and smooth than its predecessors, which

previous Belle and Sebastian fans may dislike.
But, like it or not, "The Life Pursuit" is splen
did pop.
"Return to Cookie Mountain" — TV on the
Radio
I only got tins album a few days ago, and I
like it already. lt has brilliantly intelligent songs
and an attitude and theme that I can't quite pin
down. "Return to Cookie Mountain" is an
album that requires your full attentio. or else
you won't catch its splendid nuances and the
ordered chaos of its songs. To be honest, if I
had more time to listen to it. it's very possible
that "Return to Cookie Mountain" would be
lower on this list.
"The Obliterati" — Mission of Burma
The members of Mission of Burma don't
sound nearly as old as they are. The band,
which was active from 1979-1983 and reformed
in 2002, has clearly returned to its old form.
"The Obliterati" starts with drummer Peter
Prescott's frenetic drum solo and never loses its
energy through the amusing "Nancy Reagan's
Head": "And I'm haunted by the freakish size
of Nancy Reagan's head/ No way that thing
came with that body." Great songs like
"2wice," "Spider's Web" and "Man in De
cline" show that after 20 years. Mission of
Burma haven't lost a thing.
"Everything All The Time" — Band of Horses
I don't normally like countrv music, hut alt

country Band of Horses' album. "Everything
All The Time" has really charmed me. It's full
of lush instrumentals, and has an lovely, organ
ic atmosphere. Band of Horses's charming sen
timentality won me over, and is sure to capture
other listeners as well.
"Ys" — Joanna Newsom
1 gave this album to my sister for Christ
mas, but she didn't seem to appreciate it
after the first listen. But "Ys" is not an
album one can really appreciate after the
first listen. Only a strong artist like Newsom
can pull off the sprawling. 16-minute songs
that comprise "Ys". While "Ys" is ambi
tious. full of stunningly well-written ballads,
it never seems pretentious And so. Jane, if
only you'd give "Ys" a listen, it's something
you'd fall in love with.
"Boys and Girls in America" —The Hold
Steady
Alter writing my review of "Boys and
Girls in America" in November. I've realized
that I like the Hold Steady's latest more and
more each time I listen to it. Somehow, the
album doesn't get stale. Perhaps it's the
album's ability to not just borrow from the
past, but also to blaze ahead with originality.
Or maybe it's the intelligent lyrics you don't
normally associate with music that rocks as
hard as The I fold Steady. Either way, "Boys
and Girls," is an album that keeps getting bet
ter and better.

"The Life Pursuit" — Belle & Sebastian
Belle & Sebastian have departed from its
more organic sound to create "The Life Pur
suit," an album anchored by such solid songs as
"The Blues arc Still Blue" and "Sukie in the
Graveyard." "The Life Pursuit" is far more
sunny and smooth than its predecessors, which

previous Belle and Sebastian fans may dislike.
But, like it or not, "The Life Pursuit" is splen
did pop.
"Return to Cookie Mountain" — TV on the
Radio
I only got tins album a few days ago, and I
like it already. lt has brilliantly intelligent songs
and an attitude and theme that I can't quite pin
down. "Return to Cookie Mountain" is an
album that requires your full attentio. or else
you won't catch its splendid nuances and the
ordered chaos of its songs. To be honest, if I
had more time to listen to it. it's very possible
that "Return to Cookie Mountain" would be
lower on this list.
"The Obliterati" — Mission of Burma
The members of Mission of Burma don't
sound nearly as old as they are. The band,
which was active from 1979-1983 and reformed
in 2002, has clearly returned to its old form.
"The Obliterati" starts with drummer Peter
Prescott's frenetic drum solo and never loses its
energy through the amusing "Nancy Reagan's
Head": "And I'm haunted by the freakish size
of Nancy Reagan's head/ No way that thing
came with that body." Great songs like
"2wice," "Spider's Web" and "Man in De
cline" show that after 20 years. Mission of
Burma haven't lost a thing.
"Everything All The Time" — Band of Horses
I don't normally like countrv music, hut alt

country Band of Horses' album. "Everything
All The Time" has really charmed me. It's full
of lush instrumentals, and has an lovely, organ
ic atmosphere. Band of Horses's charming sen
timentality won me over, and is sure to capture
other listeners as well.
"Ys" — Joanna Newsom
1 gave this album to my sister for Christ
mas, but she didn't seem to appreciate it
after the first listen. But "Ys" is not an
album one can really appreciate after the
first listen. Only a strong artist like Newsom
can pull off the sprawling. 16-minute songs
that comprise "Ys". While "Ys" is ambi
tious. full of stunningly well-written ballads,
it never seems pretentious And so. Jane, if
only you'd give "Ys" a listen, it's something
you'd fall in love with.
"Boys and Girls in America" —The Hold
Steady
Alter writing my review of "Boys and
Girls in America" in November. I've realized
that I like the Hold Steady's latest more and
more each time I listen to it. Somehow, the
album doesn't get stale. Perhaps it's the
album's ability to not just borrow from the
past, but also to blaze ahead with originality.
Or maybe it's the intelligent lyrics you don't
normally associate with music that rocks as
hard as The I fold Steady. Either way, "Boys
and Girls," is an album that keeps getting bet
ter and better.
