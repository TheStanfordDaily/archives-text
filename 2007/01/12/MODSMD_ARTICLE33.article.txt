### KELLY PETERSON INTERMISSION DIVA 
Back in the day, I was a proud music elitist. It all began in my
freshman year of high school. The guv I had the biggest crush
on found out I listened to crap like Jewel and Sum 41, so he
took it upon himself to refine my music taste. What started
with three burned CDs — Ben Folds. Pavement and Yo La
Tengo — evolved into an indie music obsession. 1 listened to
as much Neutral Milk Hotel. Death Cab (pre-OC. obvi) and
obscure bands with stupid names like !!! as the best of them,
and poured money into subscriptions to "Spin" and "Mojo"
so that I could be closer to the edge of "the scene."
Something happened, though, when 1 came to college: 1 found
my feet tapping to Britney Spears' "Toxic" and felt guilty for
letting "My I lumps" by the Black Eyed Peas grow on me. In
weeks, my barriers against the music of the masses crumbled
entirely. So. here are the top 10 singles that I still feel twinges
of guilt for loving. Somewhere in the space-time continuum, a
15-year old version of me is threatening to kill herself.
10) Carrie Underwood — "Before He Cheats"

To he honest, I'm not really all that guilty about this song. Not
only can Carrie sing like a champ, but it's the kind of song that
you can really get into singing in the shower, regardless of
whether or not you're actually pissed off. Despite all tins, I've
never met a country-loving music elitist, unless they count
Bonnie Prince Billy as a country singer.
9) The Pussycat Dolls — "Anything"
Lately, my claim to fame has been that Nicole Sherzinger
(lead singer, a.k.a.. the only one who anyone recognizes) went
to my high school. Watching the "Buttons" video on MTV
makes me so proud. Chairs haven't been so useful since Brit
ney's "Stronger!" I can't help but love their music, but
couldn't they have picked a less cringe-worthy name?
8) Sean Paul — "Temperature"
i wanna be the Papa, you can be the M0m...?" What does
that even mean, and why does it make me want to dance?
7) Fall Out Boy — "Sugar. We're Coin' Down Swinging"
I feel like Fall Out Boy is the Blink-182 of today's high school
ers, without the adolescent humor. At some point, they were
an indie band... then they were discovered by MTV. Perhaps

they didn't deserve all the attention that they got (Best New
Artist at the Grammys?), but you have to admit, this song is
kind of great.
6) Nelly Furtado — "Man Eater"
1 love this video: Nelly Furtado follows her runaway dog
through a shady underground gathering of dancing zombies.
Then she finds her dog. Watch it — it'll make you want to go
clubbing.
5) Chamillionaire — "Ridin' Dirty"
You know you're successful when Weird Al does a parody of
your song (which is also brilliant — who would have thought
Weird Al was still kickin'?). Everyone fr.nii my eight-year-old
nephew to my 34-year-old brother loved this song, whether
they'd like to admit it or not.
4) Jessica Simpson — "A Public Affair"
While Nick Lachcy was whining about what was left of him
post-divorce (Vanessa Minillo? Downgrade!), Jessica Simp-
son showed us that she was so over him by
bringing her BFFs roller-skating and fanta
sizing about threesomes with the employees.

Listening to this song is like eating a pound of
raw cookie dough, and then realizing you just ate a pound of raw cookie
dough. Yum.
3) Fergie — "Fergalicious"
According to my friend, Becca, Fergie did for "delicious" what Gwcn Stefani
did for "bananas" in '05.1 might have chosen "London Bridge" instead, hut
it's far too annoying to make the song a guilty pleasure while "Fergalicious" is
(ugh) rather enjoyable. You can't deny that putting the "e" in "tastey" was a
stroke of pop genius... or just another contribution to society's downfall.
2) James Blunt — "You're Beautiful"
I have nothing to say for myself. Moving right along...
1) Brooke 1 logan — "About Us"
Hulk I logan stars in a reality TV show on VIII and it remarkably gains some
consistent audience. Then his daughter decides she wants to be a singer, so
Mr. Nanny makes the calls and gets her a record deal. Brooke comes out with
"About Us," complete with a grill and Paul Wall to give her some street cred.
It does the trick. I love it.
To end with an anecdote... a few weeks ago, a friend's younger sister posted
the following status on Facebook: "Kate is: listening to *old, cliche* indie
music like the shins and ani difranco- lol." I 've never felt si) out ol touch in my
life... but 1 bet she doesn't enjoy the new Justin Timberlakc album as much as
I do. "Brincin' Sexvßack" guilt-free? Priceless.
