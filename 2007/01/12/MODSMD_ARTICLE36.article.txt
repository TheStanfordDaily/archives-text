## Tamarine: Good look in, good eats 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION 
When I was little, my mother asked me whether or not I want
ed to listen to a story about Lamb Chop, the sock puppet, and 1
replied that I, instead, wanted to eat a lamb chop. To which my
sister replied, "Philip wants to eat a sock! Ewww!"
Ewww' certainly wasn't my response to the lamb chops at
Tamarine, a delicious Vietnamese restaurant located conve
niently on 546 University Avenue. Tamarine is a restaurant that

blends food, culture and art in a beautiful —

and delicious — way.

.. .
The first thing you notice about
Tamarine is how good it looks.

Many Asian restaurants don't pay
too much attention to the decor;
their main concern is the food itself.

But in Tamarine, everything, from the

art on the walls to the tables to the attire

of the hostess, has been chosen to

be inviting and ap
pealing. Even the
bathroom was gor
geous. 1 knew I
was in classy
restaurant when 1
saw next to the

soap spigot a lotion dispenser.

which was convenient, given

how dry my hands were.

Granted, this is up-

scale Palo Alto,
hut I was duly im
pressed.

1 was further im
pressed by the appetizers —

shrimp spring rolls and duck confit salad. The spring rolls were a
little bland by themselves, but they went beautifully with the
sweet Hoison sauce. Even better was the duck confit salad. I'm
normally a little dubious of any salad with meat in it, but the salad
was great. Besides the duck, the salad had Asian pears, almonds,
and a light, sweet, citrus vinaigrette. Often times, restaurants can
go overboard with salad dressing, but Tamarine's salad was well
balanced, so the dressing didn't overpower the rest of the salad.
This was fortunate, because the Asian pears were delicious, nei
ther too firm nor overripe, and the taste of the pear was accented
by the vinaigrette.
The entrees, ginger chicken and masala lamb curry, were also
very good. The chicken was tender and flavorful, with a delicious,
light chili, garlic, onion and oyster sauce. I often am not too fond
of garlic or onions in sauces, but the sauce was very enjoyable,
and I even enjoyed the sweet onions.
The lamb curry, despite its name, wasn't spicy at all. Rather, it
had a subdued flavor, and a very tender texture, much like a well
cooked pot roast. I preferred the ginger chicken, but Julia liked
the lamb curry. Either way, both were very good Vietnamese
dishes.
However, each of the dishes were dominated by meat. The
meal certainly would have been enhanced if each plate had had a
portion of vegetables. This poor meat-vegetable balance was ex
acerbated by the small portions of rice, which were served in ba
nana leaves and a small wicker basket. The portion of rice was a

little
small,
and
since it
was in
si d c
leaves
and a
basket,
it made
eating

the rice difficult. Should I cat it with a fork? Or do I bring the bas
ket up to my mouth and cat with chopsticks? Furthermore, while
the brown rice was described on the menu as "aromatic, flavor
infused rice," the rice was in reality neither, and had small under
cooked portions.
At $15 a person for a "Tamarine Power Lunch," Tamarinc
isn't too expensive for students. 1 lowever. if you get a drink and
brown rice, as I did, that will add another five dollars, but 1 cer
tainly could have just gotten a water and my meal would be well
worth the cost.
Tamarine, despite its small flaws, is very much worth checking
out. It's got a great atmosphere and delicious food that you might
never have tried, at a relatively reasonable price. And so, if you
go, remember to bring back some of that lotion for me.
