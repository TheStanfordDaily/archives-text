## Longtime Haas Center administrator departs Halleck steps down after 20 years as director of service fellowship, SIW 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Haas Center lost an influential
leader and one of its original stall mem
bers in Jeanne VV'alil 1 lalleck, who retired
in November from the position she had
held for more than 20 years. Center rep
resentatives, however, say the transition
has been smooth.
Halleck had a profound impact on
hundreds of students through her admin
istration of the John Gardner Public Ser
vice Fellowship, which allows students to
spend a year after graduation working in
a nonprofit or governmental agency, and
through her role as campus coordinator
of the Stanford-in Washington (SIW)
program.
"Ever since I've known Jeanne YVahl

I hillock .she has been the vital cog for the
engagement of Stanford students with
public service," s;iiil ' Miner 1 hiiversity
President Donald Kennedy in a press re
lease.
Halleck said she was sorry to leave but
wanted to concentrate on an upcoming
move.
"It's really good for these programs to
have new blood and new people, and I
certainly hope to continue to be in
volved." she said. I lalleck remains on the
board of the John Gardner Fellowship
Association (JGFA).
She said that working with students
was the most rewarding part of her job
and the part she will miss the most.
"They're a real source of renewal,"
she said.
I let mentorship of students did not go
unrecognized by the students them
selves.
"Jeanne helped me find the perfect
placement for my Gardner Fellowship."
said Regan Johnson, a 2(K)0 graduate and
current fellow. "I certainly wouldn't have
been this lucky without her."
Similarly, current fellow Brian
Bergmark, who graduated in 2006,
said Halleck was almost entirely re
sponsible for his placement.
"I could not be happier with how
1 am spending these 10 months," he
said, citing Halleck's tirelessness
and knack for finding good opportu
nities throughout the placement
process.
Having been with the Center
since its founding, Halleck's impact
on public service at Stanford is vast.
After working in Washington. D.C.,
I lalleck was recruited to Stanford by
Catherine Milton, founding director
of the Public Service Center, which
became the Haas Center in 1989.
Halleck has been at Stanford ever
since.
"Her experience in the policy
world, her contacts in that world, her
passionate commitment to the pub
lic sector and her indefatigable at
tention to the careers and lives of
generations of Stanford students
constitute a scope of service rarely
seen, in my experience," said
Suzanne Abel, director of external
relations at the 1 laas Center.
One of Halleck's strengths was
her ability to connect people, and she
used this skill for the benefit of the
students she served.
"I've never met someone like

Jeanne who knows and befriends
everyone, it seems, from students to
people in Congress to leaders in pub
lic service across the US and around
the world," Johnson said.
1 lalleck'sgoal of creating a strong
network of former Gardner fellows
was realized when the JGFA, aimed
to connect former and current fel
lows. was established in 2004. Mar
jorie Alfs, who has assumed most of
lialleck's responsibilities at the Cen
ter. called the establishment of the
JCiFA an important part of Halleck's
legacy.
"She has served as a continuous
link over all these years for both pro
grams, and that's really helped â€” es
pecially for the John Gardner Fel
lowship Program," Alfs said. "She
has kept the fellows together in a
network, so they feel a personal con
nection over all these years."
I lalleck said that she saw the es
tablishment of the JGFA as the ful
fillment of the wishes of the fellow
ship's founder.
"John Gardner said that the most
important part of the fellowship
would be the resources and network
that would develop over time," Hal
leck said. "Developing this network
of resources was something 1 knew
how to do and enjoyed doing. 1 con
tinue to feel that connecting [past
and current fellows] is very impor
tant."
Indeed, she said that many recent
fellowship placements have been fa
cilitated by some of the former fel
lows.
According to Abel, there will be

no major changes to the SI W or John
Gardner Fellowship Program in the
foreseeable future.
Alls, who worked closely with
Halleck beginning in 2002, assumed
most of Halleck's responsibilities
following her retirement, with other
duties going to Anu Menon, a 1999
graduate, and Sonia Mittal, a 2(X)4
graduate.
"Marjorie Alfs, Anu Menon and
Sonia Mittal are deeply familiar with
how the two programs work, and are
committed to carrying on the tradi
tion of excellence established and
maintained for so long by Jeanne
Halleck," Abel said.
Alfs said the leadership transition
has been nearly seamless for her be
cause of the support she has re
ceived from others at the I laas Cen
ter.
In addition, she said, working
closely with Halleck over the past
few years helped her get a strong feel
for her new responsibilities."! laving
gone through several years of the
programs, I know the rhythm of the
yearly cycle, so there aren't a lot of
surprises about what is going to hap
pen over the next year."
Following her retirement, Hal
leck enjoyed traveling to Machu Pic
chu and the Galapagos islands, cap
ping her journey off with a trip to
Yosemite. Over the next few months,
she will be focused on finding a place
to live and moving into it.
"1 haven't thought much beyond
that," she said, though she added that
she plans to continue her involve
ment with the JGFA.
