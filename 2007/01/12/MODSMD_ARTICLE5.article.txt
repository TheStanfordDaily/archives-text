A recent Stanford study has revealed
that napping during the day,far from sap
ping cognitive abilities, actually improves
attentiveness and working efficiency
a fact which many Stanford students
seem to have known all along.
"1 definitely feel more alert when 1
wake up from one of my 'ten minute
power naps,"' said senior Jay Huang, an
Economics and Engineering double
major. "Unfortunately, ten minutes usu
ally becomes three hours once I snooze
my alarm so many times that it dies, and
then I've wasted a lot of productive
time."
Fear of such side effects to napping as
Huang's seems to explain why napping,
while a regular pastime among college
students, is an uncommon pursuit in the
working world.
"Naps are not utilized in our culture
because they have a negative connota
tion people who nap are weak, lazy.et
cetera." said Dr. Steven I toward, associ
ate professor of anesthesia and co-author
of the study with Dr. Rebecca Smith-
Coggins, associate professor of surgery.

Ilie objective of the study was to "ex
amine whether a 40-minute nap oppor
tunity at 3 a.m. can improve cognitive
and psychomotor performance in physi
cians and nurses working 12-hour night
shifts."
Howard said the study did provide
"very solid scientific evidence" that naps
"work to increase alertness and perform
a nee."
I loward and colleagues are taking ac
tion based on the results of the study by
implementing a Strategic Nap Program
at the Portland, Oregon, Veteran's Af
fairs Medical Center.
"This has never been attempted in
health care," I loward said.
Perhaps Stanford students instinc
tively know the benefits of napping be
cause of the longstanding presence on
campus of Dr. William Dement s course
"Sleep and Dreams," a winter quarter
psychiatry class that he will teach for the
37th time this term.
Ilie study was not related to this class,
although Howard called Dement one of
his heroes.
Napping in college appears to be
widespread, with Facebook groups such
as "I Love Naps" boasting () ( >,741 mem
bers as of yesterday evening. Here, stu
dents discuss topics such as strange nap
ping places and positions, amazing events
they have slept through and sleep-walk
ing adventures.
