## Bush's Iraq plan draws confrontation Democrats, and some Republicans, grill administration Senate committee hearings 
### TOM RAUM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush's plan to send more troops to Iraq ran
into a wall of criticism on Capitol Hill on
ITiursda\ as administration officials drew
conlrontational. sometimes mocking chal
lenges from both Democrats and Republi
cans.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in
response that the administration might
abandon the increase if the Iraqi govern
ment doesn't do its part, but he provided no
timetable. "I think most of us. in our minds,
are thinking of it as a matter of months, not
I n months or two years." he told the I louse
Armed Services Committee.
Bush and top members of his national se
curity team sought to rally support for the
troop buildup a day after he unveiled his
plan for turning around a conflict that has
lasted nearly four years and cost more than
3.000 American military lives.
Instead. Gates and Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice found themselves em
broiled in the first pitched exchanges in a
battle that is likely to dominate Congress
for months or longer and is already shaping
the 2008 presidential election.
"I think this speech given last night bv

this president represents the most danger
ous foreign policy blunder in this country
since Vietnam, if it's carried out." Sen.
Chuck 1 lagel of Nebraska, a potential 2008
presidential contender, told Rice. While he
is a Republican, administration officials
were defending the plan for the first time to
the Democratic-controlled Congress.
Hill Nelson. D-Fla., noted his own past
support for the administration on the war
but said he could not continue. He declared,
"I have not been told the truth over and
over again by administration witnesses, and
the American people have not been told the
truth."
A new AP-lpsos poll found approval for
Bush's handling of Iraq hovering near a
record low — percent of Americans ap
prove and 68 percent disapprove.
Bush, visiting with troops at Fort Ben
ning. Ga., cautioned that the troop increase
"is not going to yield immediate results. It's
going to take awhile."
His plan, outlined in a prime-time ad
dress to the nation on Wednesday, would
raise troop levels in Iraq by 21,500 — from
132.000 to 153,500 — at a cost of $5.6 bil
lion. It also calls for the Iraqi government to
increase its own forces and to do more to
quell sectarian violence
"American patience is limited, and obvi

ously if the Iraqis fail to maintain their com
mitments we'll have to revisit our strategy."
said Gates.
At one point Gates, just three weeks on
the job. told lawmakers, "I would confess
I'm no expert on Iraq." Later, asked about
reaching the right balance between Ameri
can and Iraqi forces, he told the panel he was
"no expert on military matters."
Committee members pressed Gates, who
replaced Donald 11. Rumsfeld at the Penta
gon. on an exit strategy for the U.S.
"At the outset of the strategy, it's a mis
take to talk about an exit strategy." he said.
Gates, in testimony to the committee and
earlier at a news conference, said he was re
questing increasing the size of the Army and
Marine Corps by 92,000 troops over the
next five years.
I le also said the Pentagon would recall to
duty sooner than planned some National
Guard and Reserve troops who have served

yearlong tours in Iraq or Afghanistan.
As Rice testified to the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, Rep. Howard Berman,
D-Calif.. likened Bush's plan to a "hail Ma
liki pass" —jokingly combining Iraqi Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki's name with the
football "Hail Mary" desperation pass.
The U.S. led a coalition that invaded Iraq
in March 2003, despite failing to win U.N.
Security Council support. ITie government
of Saddam Hussein quickly crumbled and
Bush declared major combat operations
over two months later.
Bush's war effort initially had strong sup
port. both in Congress and among other
Americans. Yet that support has eroded as
violence has continued.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. D-
Nev., said he hoped to bring up a nonbind
ing resolution next week expressing opposi
tion to any troop buildup. A similar move is
expected in the House.
