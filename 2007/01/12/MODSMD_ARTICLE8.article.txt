BAC i 11 DAD, Iraq (AP) - U.S.-led forces detained six Irani
ans ITiursday at a government office flying an Iranian flag,
Iraqi otticials and witnesses said, as President Bush vowed
to isolate Iran and Syria as part of a new strategy to quell vi
olence in Iraq.
The arrests in the northern city of Irbil — the second tar
geting Iranians in less than a month — drew condemnation
lrom the regional Kurdish government and concern from
Iraqi officials in Baghdad, who are trying to maintain close
ties with both Iran and the U.S. despite the hostility between
the two.
lop I S officials repeated long-standing accusations
tliiit Iran is encouraging the violence in Iraq by supplying
money and weapons.
"I think it's instructive that in the last couple of weeks
two of those raids that we conducted to go after these folks
that are providing these kinds of weapons — two of those
raids had policed up Iranians." Gen. Peter Pace.chairman
o! the Joint < hiefs of Staff, said in Washington. "So it is
ileai that the Iranians are complicit in providing
weapons."
In fehran. Iran s Foreign Ministry said it summoned the

Iraqi and Swiss ambassadors and "demanded an explana
tion" about the incident. Switzerland represents American
interests in Iran.
ITie multinational forces entered the building in Irbil
overnight, detained the Iranians and confiscated computers
and documents, two senior local Kurdish officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitiv
ity <if the information. Irbil is in the Kurdish-controlled
north. 220 miles from Baghdad.
A resident near the Iranian office said foreign forces
used percussion grenades and brought down an Iranian flag
from the roof of the yellow, two-story building. As the oper
ation went on. two helicopters flew overhead, the resident
said, speaking on condition that his name not be used be
cause he feared retribution.
In the afternoon, several Kurdish militiamen could be
seen around the building preventing people from ap
proaching. They did not allow cameramen and photogra
phers to take pictures.
U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the detained
Iranians were being questioned.
Tensions are high between Iran and the United States.
The Bush administration, which sent troops to Iraq in 2003
to oust Saddam Hussein, has accused Tehran of seeking to
develop nuclear weapons and of helping fuel violence in
Iraq. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. mean
while. is trying to expand Tehran's role in Iraq to counter
U.S. influence in the region.
Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said the
government was seeking clarification from the Americans

and the Iranians about the detainees. He chided both sides,
along with Syria, for using Iraq to fight their political battles.
"Sometimes we pay the price for the tension in relations
between Iran and the United States and Syria, therefore it
is in our interest... that these relations improve, but not at
the expense of Iraq," he said.
A bipartisan U.S. panel, the Iraq Study Group,in Decem
ber called for a new diplomatic drive to enlist Syria and Iran
in peace efforts. Instead. Bush accused both countries of
aiding terrorists and insurgents in Iraq in his speech
Wednesday outlining his new war strategy.
"We will disrupt the attacks on our forces," Bush said.
"We will interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria."
Iraqis expressed skepticism that Bush's plan to send in
21,500 more troops will quell the violence in their country.
On ITiursday, police reported at least 45 people were
killed or found dead from bombings and shootings, in
cluding a 10-year-old struck in a mortar attack in the
northern city of Mosul and 37 tortured bodies found in
Baghdad.
Gunmen ambushed a minivan carrying Oil Ministry em
ployees in a predominantly Shiite area of Baghdad, kidnap
ping six of the passengers and the driver after separating
people according to their IDs,police said.
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced Saturday
that his government would implement a new security plan
for Baghdad, including neighborhood-by-neighborhood
sweeps by Iraqi forces backed by U.S. troops. Similar efforts
have failed in the past. The Bush proposal calls for up to
12,000 additional Iraqi troops to secure Baghdad.
