ROCHESTER. N.Y. â€” A storm blamed
for at least 36 deaths in six states spread into
the Northeast on Monday, coating trees,
power lines and roads with a shell of ice up to
a half-inch thick and knocking out power to
more than half a million homes and business
es.
Ice-covered roads cut into Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday observances from Albany,
N.Y., to Fort Worth and Austin, Texas, where
officials also canceled Gov. Rick Perry's inau
guration parade on Tuesday because another
round of ice was expected during the night.
The weight of the ice snapped tree limbs
and took down power lines, knocking out
electricity to about 135.000 customers in
New York state and New Hampshire.
Even in Maine, a state well-accustomed to
winter weather, a layer of sleet and snow on
roads shut down businesses, day care centers
and schools.
In hard-hit Missouri, the utility company
Ameren said it would probably not have
everyone's lights back on until Wednesday
night. Overnight temperatures were expect
ed to drop into the single digits. As of Mon
day afternoon, about 312,000 homes and
businesses still had no electricity.
Missouri National Guardsmen went door
to door, checking on residents, and helped
clear slick roads.
About 112,000 homes and businesses

blacked out in Oklahoma, some of them
since the storm's first wave struck on Friday,
also were still waiting for power Monday. Ice
built up by sleet and freezing rain was 4 inch
es thick in places.
"Emergency' responders are having a hard
time getting to residents where their services
are needed because of trees and power lines
in the road," said Pittsburg County, Okla..
Undersheriff Richard Sexton.
About 127,000 customers were without
electricity Monday in Michigan.
More than 160 flights were canceled at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
Before dawn Monday, a car slid into the
path of a dump truck on an icy New York
highway in Sennett.2o miles west of Syracuse,
killing the car's driver and two passengers.
"It was very icy,rainy,a snow-sleet mix.so
definitely the road conditions had a lot to do
with this." Sheriff David Gould said.
A wave of arctic air trailed the storm and
was expected to push temperatures into the
single digits in some areas. Oklahoma offi
cials strongly discouraged travel, saying the
frigid weather would refreeze slush and
water on roads.
Waves of freezing rain, sleet and snow
since Friday had been blamed for at least 15
deaths in Oklahoma, eight in Missouri, five
in lowa, four in New York, three in Texas and
one in Maine. Seven of the Oklahoma deaths
occurred when a mini van carrying 12 people
slid off an icy highway Sunday and hit an on
coming truck.
