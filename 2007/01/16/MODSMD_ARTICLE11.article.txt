## Editorial Board Cingular: Raising the (Non-Optional) Bar 
### 
When Sean Weisberg, class of 2007,
transferred to Stanford his sopho
more year, he found that his T-Mo
bile cell coverage on campus "was truly
awful." At first he thought that the poor
coverage had to do with thick walls in
Toyon. 1 le wandered all over campus trying
to find cell reception. "The only place where
I could get a signal was in the middle of
White Plaza." Weisberg switched to
AT&T Cingular. and has since had excel
lent coverage on-campus, although when he
returns home to Connecticut his service is
spottier than it had been with T-Mobile.
Weisberg's story is not unique among
members of the Stanford population. Due
to a contract that Stanford has with
AT&T Cingular, cellular providers such as
F Mobile cannot offer service to campus.
And corporate contracts with Stanford are
not confined to AT&T/Cingular. Interest
ingly,T-Mobile does have a special partner
ship with the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, although service is not extended to
the general campus. Apple and Dell have
special contracts with Stanford, as well. In
these cases, if members of the Stanford
community choose to purchase certain
Apple or Dell products on campus, they re
ceive a special discount.
The crucial difference between the
AT&T/Cingular contract and the Apple
and Dell contracts is consumer choice.
Members of the Stanford community may
choose to go off campus and purchase the
computer brand of their preference. Re
gardless of the brand, it will function simi
larly to an Apple or Dell computer when it
is used on-campus.
But the contract with AT&T/Cingular is
imposed on the Stanford community
through the resulting spotty service of com
peting companies. Consumers are not al
lowed to choose their own cellular
providers — Stanford University has done
so for them.
The Stanford-AT&T/Cingular contract
not only affects members of the Stanford
community, but individuals who share a
plan with members of the community.
Bryce Golden-Chen, class of 2009, noticed
that his Sprint coverage was quite poor
when he spent Admit Weekend in Stern. As
a student at Stanford, he made the switch to
AT&T/Cingular — along with the rest of
his family. The Golden-Chens are now on a
AT&T/Cingular family plan, partially due

to Bryce's situation at Stanford. In this case,
not only is AT&T/Cingular forced on mem
bers of the Stanford community, but it also
affects his entire family.
Perhaps the Stanford-AT&T/Cingular
contract would be justified — if perks such
as reduced prices for service and equip
ment were advertised to students. Howev
er. none of the sixteen students interviewed
for this editorial were aware of the
AT&T/Cingular discounts available to
them. Although we are unable to find ex
actly who benefits from this exclusive plan,
it seems probable that the legal entity of
Stanford University is the financial winner.
Stanford students, faculty and staff appear
to have had little input in this contract, yet
they are the ones who are directly involved
in the resulting policies.
Ciranted, AT&T/Cingular service is far
better than it has been in the past. In an ed
itorial issued by the Daily on May 21.2004.
the Editorial Board deplored the lackluster
cellular reception on campus. Service used
to be provided by two wheeled-trailers on
opposite sides of campus. Now, AT&T/Cin
gular provides service from a well-hidden
on-campus tower.
The above solution to better cellular
service illustrates one benefit from the ex
clusive service contract. Our campus is not
cluttered with a potpourri of fake trees and
water towers, each pumping out coverage
from competing companies. Perhaps the
idea of a skyline of cell towers is enough to
convince people that the right to consumer
choice is not vital. However, can anyone
even find our current AT&T/Cingular
tower? In an era where cell towers are in
geniously disguised by the same people
who obscure the machinery at Disneyland,
the idea of cell towers marring Stanford's
bucolic setting seems unlikely.
Stanford has disrupted consumer choice
in a way that is beneficial to the collective
Stanford piggy bank but unfair to members
of the community whose basic consumer
rights in a free market economy have been
compromised.
At the very least. Stanford students
should be made aware of what is going on.
Those responsible for the contract should
launch a public awareness campaign to let
students know about the possible discounts,
so that they can reap benefits. Otherwise,
what is the point of entering into corporate
partnerships at all?
