for their many, many shortcomings. But I am

won't bore you with impolite chastisements
of hard-working staff members like Jane
Camarillo. upon whose metaphorical shal

Greg Boardman. who reportedly wants to
ban drinking games in freshman dorms — a
silly rumor, since only a complete poltroon
would want to ban drinking games, and you
and I both know Greg ain't no goddamn
poltroon.
None of that negative nattering. Nick.
Today I'm offering hymns in praise of the
hardest-working administrator on campus,
who makes life worth living for a substantial
part of the student body — especially on
weekends and during reruns of "Aqua Teen
Hunger Force." He is the lowest-paid per
son on campus and receives no medical cov
erage. His retirement plan involves several
court dates and a haircut mandated by his
defense attorney. Yet. unlike Hennessy.
trapped in his ivory tower money bin. this
administrator has the common touch — he
speaks directly to the students, albeit
through an untraceable pay phone. I'm
speaking, of course, of the CMD — the
Campus Marijuana Dealer, or the Pot
Provost.
Back in our parents' day, marijuana had
a certain rebel flavor. Lighting up was a
giant middle finger to the system, to mom
and dad. to Nixon.Times have changed. I do
not mean to suggest that everyone smokes
pot — most jobs require drug tests, not to
mention cognitive ability; many people
don't like paying for it (fortunately, it grows
on trees); and some kids just don't like the
anxiety, the high, that exploding feeling in
your eyeballs. But I have never met anyone
my age who is truly against marijuana, on
ethical, moral or even biological grounds.

When you light a cigarette, you get angry
glares and unfunny cancer jokes; friends
and family disown you. shocked, as if you'd
suddenly admitted a lifetime membership
in the Hitler Youth. When you smoke a
joint, people giggle and ask for a puff, just a
little one, man. just enough to make the col
ors smell good.
That's where the Pot Provost comes in.
Let's call him Roland.a composite of sever

woman) I've had the pleasure to meet here
at the Farm (only for research, officer, 1

with the territory, then he'd have been
kicked out of several dorms for stupid mis

were greedy, he'd have moved from semi
legal drugs to quite illegal drugs (the kind

own stash, become paranoid that the cops
are onto him — which they are. But Roland
is smart, kind, quick to grin. I le only sells to

know Roland is to love him. Calling him a
drug dealer seems so drab; calling him a
criminal is simply bad manners. For a hyper
