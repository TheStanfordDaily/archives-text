# The 						cutest little addiction

Being a chronic complainer and all

for their many, many shortcomings. But I am

won't bore you with impolite chastisements
of hard-working staff members like Jane
Camarillo. upon whose metaphorical shal
low grave we all shall dance the tango, and
Greg Boardman. who reportedly wants to
ban drinking games in freshman dorms — a
silly rumor, since only a complete poltroon
would want to ban drinking games, and you
and I both know Greg ain't no goddamn
poltroon.
None of that negative nattering. Nick.
Today I'm offering hymns in praise of the
hardest-working administrator on campus,
who makes life worth living for a substantial
part of the student body — especially on
weekends and during reruns of "Aqua Teen
Hunger Force." He is the lowest-paid per
son on campus and receives no medical cov
erage. His retirement plan involves several
court dates and a haircut mandated by his
defense attorney. Yet. unlike Hennessy.
trapped in his ivory tower money bin. this
administrator has the common touch — he
speaks directly to the students, albeit
through an untraceable pay phone. I'm
speaking, of course, of the CMD — the
Campus Marijuana Dealer, or the Pot
Provost.
Back in our parents' day, marijuana had
a certain rebel flavor. Lighting up was a
giant middle finger to the system, to mom
and dad. to Nixon.Times have changed. I do
not mean to suggest that everyone smokes
pot — most jobs require drug tests, not to
mention cognitive ability; many people
don't like paying for it (fortunately, it grows
on trees); and some kids just don't like the
anxiety, the high, that exploding feeling in
your eyeballs. But I have never met anyone
my age who is truly against marijuana, on
ethical, moral or even biological grounds.

When you light a cigarette, you get angry
glares and unfunny cancer jokes; friends
and family disown you. shocked, as if you'd
suddenly admitted a lifetime membership
in the Hitler Youth. When you smoke a
joint, people giggle and ask for a puff, just a
little one, man. just enough to make the col
ors smell good.
That's where the Pot Provost comes in.
Let's call him Roland.a composite of sever
al helpful young men (and the occasional
woman) I've had the pleasure to meet here
at the Farm (only for research, officer, 1
swears it). II Roland were lazy, which comes
with the territory, then he'd have been
kicked out of several dorms for stupid mis
takes ("That? That's just a lamp."), whip
slashed from Roble to Cedro to Manzanita.
perhaps even expelled for a year. If Roland
were greedy, he'd have moved from semi
legal drugs to quite illegal drugs (the kind
that gives you nosebleeds and supplements
anorexia), smoked-snorted-ingested his
own stash, become paranoid that the cops
are onto him — which they are. But Roland
is smart, kind, quick to grin. I le only sells to

Because 1 am a skeptic, blessed
with Catholic guilt and cursed with
mournful conscience. I cannot find it
in myself to embrace marijuana the
way some of my friends can. 1 am sus

mind expansion, frightened by its ad
dictive power, paranoid that even
when you turn off the smoke detec
tor the tiny camera inside the ceiling
light is still feeding images directly to
the police headquarters. I am not
quite convinced that marijuana
should be legalized; partially be
cause that means all the lame people
could get it. but also because I have
seen what smoking too much can do
to you. I have a close friend who has
already squandered several of his
opportunities. I do not think that
marijuana was the cause: but certain
ly, the wake-and-bakes at lunchtime,
the 4:20 bowl and the late nights
watching Cartoon Network were not
helping matters.
1 don't think this is a good argu
ment against marijuana. One mark
of a thing's greatness is how many
lives it ruins. As Bill Maher says,
"Dark Side of the Moon," an album
unthinkable without drugs, is good
enough to justify 100 kids dead from
drug abuse. Just because something
is bad in excess doesn't mean it can
not be useful in moderation. Pot

heads who claim that marijuana is
not physically addictive are making
the wrong argument. Everything is
addictive: exercising (it can't be
healthy to ride the stairmaster for
two hours every day.guys),eating (or
not eating), the presence of another
("love" if it's emotional, "lust" if it's
physical). Of course marijuana is ad
dictive: it ignites the pleasure cen
ters. makes strange things sensible
and sensible things mindfuckingly
vague.
Why do we like marijuana? The
National Institute on Drug Abuse
has one of the most charmingly
square answers to that epoch-defin
ing question. Young people "use
marijuana because of peer pressure.
Others may think it's cool to use
marijuana because they hear songs
about it and see it on TV and in
movies."This is highly inaccurate: as
anyone can tell you, marijuana isn't
cool; cocaine is.
What are we against, if we are
anti-marijuana? Several studies
(most of them conducted by the
British, those logical arseholesj indi
cate that the physical and mental
side effects of cigarettes and alcohol
are far more drastic. Think about it:
Cigarettes make your teeth yellow
and turn your breath to charcoal; if
you smoke one inside, the smell lurks
for days, and unlike marijuana,
which smells of the deep eternal
wilderness and splendid days lost to
history — a caressing odor, if you
will — cigarettes smell abrasive, like
a tire fire in a pile of fossilized Mam
moth shit.
Alcohol is a trickier comparison.
What worries people who hate pot
— and what frightens me most — is
the perceived loss of control. On
some basic level, you feel more in
control of your faculties when you're
drinking than when you're getting
high.This is an unhealthy fallacy. Al
cohol feigns control by shutting
down excess pathways in your mind
— you feel more sure of yourself, ot
the l ightness of your cause, which is
why you get into lights and drunk
dial ex-girlfriends.
Weed, conversely, adds new lay
ers and levels to your perception of
the world, opening up hidden back
roads of the mind. It doesn't take
control; it just gives you too much.
Weed makes you question reality:al
cohol makes you accept it wholesale.
Pick your poison, or compound them
for the Saturday Night twofer. I
maintain that high school students
would be safer if they smoked more
weed; there would be no bullying, no
vomiting, no deaths from alcohol
poisoning (it must stick in the craw
of anti-pot activists that you can't die
from smoking too much). Everyone

is friends when you pass the peace
pipe.
I am skeptical. I am an unconfi
dent man. prone to fits of paranoia
and recrimination. I have wasted
whole years of my life pondering the
long chronicle of mistakes I have
made I shouldn't have gone to
Berlin, I shouldn't have gone to
Stanford. I should write more, I
should write less. I should have cho
sen a major with job prospects be
yond "writing a failed novel" and
"dying alone in a trashcan, my only
friend an imaginary flying pink ele
phant named Randy." This is the J.
Alfred Prufrock side of my person
ality, rhymes with "emo bullshit."
Although I try to come on like I'm
Hunter S. Thompson crossed with
Tedd\ Roosevelt and Jesus I I.Christ
the great rebels of history — the
sad truth is that 1 usually feel better
about myself when I follow the
rules. Clean lungs make breathing
fun; a clear head itllows you to focus.
I get no thrill, only anxiety, from
breaking the law. When you get
older, you start to enjoy the lamer
things in life. But what rapture,
my friends, what gorgeousness and
gorgeousity that ascends your spirit
skywar toward the swoony marsh
mallow heavens! How all the colors
of our earth, made drab and funere
al by the society of eternal spectacle,
seem to glow with freshly gilded
bombast after just the barest puff
tickles your lungs! Your eyes, like
windows into the fever dreams of a
fallen angel. Can this be so terrible,
every once and awhile, to take a
break from reality, to hear the music
of the spheres, even if all you do is
watch reruns of "Battlestar Galacti
ca?" Some of my favorite memories
from high school involve a bucket, a
water bottle with the bottom cut off,
a lighter and that little nugget of
transcendence; even though it was
everything else that got me into
Stanford (editing the newspaper,
speech and debate.community serv
ice. good grades), it was those little
reveries — for good or ill. in small
ways and large — that made me

So the next time you see Roland,
whoever he or she might be, make
sure you thank him or her a little bit

Today I'm offering hymns in praise of the
hardest-working administrator on campus,
who makes life worth living for a substantial
part of the student body — especially on
weekends and during reruns of "Aqua Teen
Hunger Force." He is the lowest-paid per
son on campus and receives no medical cov
erage. His retirement plan involves several
court dates and a haircut mandated by his
defense attorney. Yet. unlike Hennessy.
trapped in his ivory tower money bin. this
administrator has the common touch — he
speaks directly to the students, albeit
through an untraceable pay phone. I'm
speaking, of course, of the CMD — the
Campus Marijuana Dealer, or the Pot
Provost.
Back in our parents' day, marijuana had
a certain rebel flavor. Lighting up was a
giant middle finger to the system, to mom
and dad. to Nixon.Times have changed. I do
not mean to suggest that everyone smokes
pot — most jobs require drug tests, not to
mention cognitive ability; many people
don't like paying for it (fortunately, it grows
on trees); and some kids just don't like the
anxiety, the high, that exploding feeling in
your eyeballs. But I have never met anyone
my age who is truly against marijuana, on
ethical, moral or even biological grounds.

When you light a cigarette, you get angry
glares and unfunny cancer jokes; friends
and family disown you. shocked, as if you'd
suddenly admitted a lifetime membership
in the Hitler Youth. When you smoke a
joint, people giggle and ask for a puff, just a
little one, man. just enough to make the col
ors smell good.
That's where the Pot Provost comes in.
Let's call him Roland.a composite of sever
al helpful young men (and the occasional
woman) I've had the pleasure to meet here
at the Farm (only for research, officer, 1

kicked out of several dorms for stupid mis
takes ("That? That's just a lamp."), whip

marijuana was the cause: but certain
ly, the wake-and-bakes at lunchtime,
the 4:20 bowl and the late nights
watching Cartoon Network were not

1 don't think this is a good argu
ment against marijuana. One mark
of a thing's greatness is how many
lives it ruins. As Bill Maher says,
"Dark Side of the Moon," an album
unthinkable without drugs, is good
enough to justify 100 kids dead from
drug abuse. Just because something
is bad in excess doesn't mean it can
not be useful in moderation. Pot

heads who claim that marijuana is
not physically addictive are making
the wrong argument. Everything is
addictive: exercising (it can't be
healthy to ride the stairmaster for
two hours every day.guys),eating (or
not eating), the presence of another
("love" if it's emotional, "lust" if it's
physical). Of course marijuana is ad
dictive: it ignites the pleasure cen
ters. makes strange things sensible
and sensible things mindfuckingly
vague.
Why do we like marijuana? The
National Institute on Drug Abuse
has one of the most charmingly
square answers to that epoch-defin
ing question. Young people "use
marijuana because of peer pressure.
Others may think it's cool to use
marijuana because they hear songs
about it and see it on TV and in
movies."This is highly inaccurate: as
anyone can tell you, marijuana isn't
cool; cocaine is.
What are we against, if we are
anti-marijuana? Several studies
(most of them conducted by the
British, those logical arseholesj indi
cate that the physical and mental
side effects of cigarettes and alcohol
are far more drastic. Think about it:
Cigarettes make your teeth yellow
and turn your breath to charcoal; if
you smoke one inside, the smell lurks
for days, and unlike marijuana,
which smells of the deep eternal
wilderness and splendid days lost to
history — a caressing odor, if you
will — cigarettes smell abrasive, like
a tire fire in a pile of fossilized Mam
moth shit.
Alcohol is a trickier comparison.
What worries people who hate pot
— and what frightens me most — is
the perceived loss of control. On
some basic level, you feel more in
control of your faculties when you're
drinking than when you're getting
high.This is an unhealthy fallacy. Al
cohol feigns control by shutting
down excess pathways in your mind
— you feel more sure of yourself, ot
the l ightness of your cause, which is
why you get into lights and drunk
dial ex-girlfriends.
Weed, conversely, adds new lay
ers and levels to your perception of
the world, opening up hidden back
roads of the mind. It doesn't take
control; it just gives you too much.
Weed makes you question reality:al
cohol makes you accept it wholesale.
Pick your poison, or compound them
for the Saturday Night twofer. I
maintain that high school students
would be safer if they smoked more
weed; there would be no bullying, no
vomiting, no deaths from alcohol
poisoning (it must stick in the craw
of anti-pot activists that you can't die
from smoking too much). Everyone

is friends when you pass the peace
pipe.
I am skeptical. I am an unconfi
