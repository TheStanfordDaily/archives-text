Reality television makes my skin crawl.
Which isn't to say that I don't watch it.
but it still makes my skin crawl.
Hie acknowledged 800-pound gorilla of
the ordinary-people-in-the-spotlight genre
is. of course. American Idol.
'ITiis is the show that brought snarky
British commentary to the mainstream and
introduced a whole new set of pop star's sex
ualities to be debated over the water cooler.
And it's back tonight. Which has got me
thinking.
The endless fascination we have with the
mediocre talents that populate primetime
entertainment is, well, a little disturbing.
To begin with, the whole premise is a bit
odd. For years I've labored under the (ap
parently misconceived) impression that the
purpose of entertainment was to be enter
tained. To be taken away from "reality" into
the far more pleasant world of fantasy.
I was wrong.
It's as if the like of Big Brother or Sur
vivor tap into a brain region heretofore com
pletely unused. Perfectly sensible individu
als are rendered witless by the illusion of
celebrity and complete absence of talent.
Actually, I may be being a little restrictive
in my disdain. After all. we don't restrict our
idolatry to "reality." We also closely follow
the ups. downs, ins and outs of genuine fa
mous people.
I'm not sure what sort of commentary
this obsession offers on our generation, but
it can't be good. Collectively we are more
aware of Britney's romance problems than
we are of such trivialities as poverty, war and
disease in the 3rd millennium.
Still, at least worrying about Bennifer

and Brangelina is a pleasant distraction
from the vagaries of graduate school. What's
more, this fondness for reality television has
given me an idea.
I'm sure you're au fait with the delightful
"Beauty and the Geek." It's one of those
boy-meets-girl shows, with the twist being
that the men are all geeks and women are
beautiful.
Of course, because all smart men are so
cially awkward and all beautiful women are
stupid, the show is absolutely hilarious; the
single joke never fails to have me in hyster
ics.
However, whilst this delightful piece of
television is innovative, the depth of interac
tion available between stereotypes on tropi
cal islands pales in comparison to what grad
uate school could offer — when it comes to
social misfits, we are untouchable.
Which brings me to my brilliant plan:
imagine a reality program based on life in
graduate school. We have all the ingredients
you need.
We have awkward dating and romantic
desperation. We have weekly challenges and
the constant risk of elimination.
Only a small handful of us will succeed,
and even then, it will be fleeting — our brief

moment at the top will be followed by a long
decline into obscurity, punctuated by ap
pearances on QVC. advertising household
gadgets. (I may have made that last one up).
Of course to make this work, we may
have to indulge in a little editing. While the
social lives of electrical engineers are end
lessly entertaining, one imagines the tedious
lectures on circuit design are somewhat less
gripping.
In fact, now that I think about it.the
lunches at Subway and dinners at the Tree
house probably wouldn't have that much
hold on the viewers.
And. 1 suppose, while Moonbeams is the
pick-up connoisseurs location of choice,
that's probably more reflective of the Cam
pus scene, rather than of the entertainment
value.
Also.it may well be that the thrills of pub
lication in Phys. Rev. D don't hold that much
appeal with the general public. Mayhap not
everyone finds particle physics engaging...
You know, after some reflection, perhaps
grad school is not so suited for the reality TV
treatment. Life here isn't that interesting.
Actually. I suppose one could call it tedious,
boring, even soul-destroying.
Ihus my dreams of television glory are
probably a little optimistic. Fame is appar
ently not within my reach; 1 shall have to lan
guish undiscovered with the rest of you.
Ah well, at least there's American Idol to
keep me entertained.

/ can t sing. Or dance. Or perform various
wilderness tasks. Hence my only path to fame
and glory is if you email me at navins@stan
