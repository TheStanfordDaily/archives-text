At Arizona, Stanford won 10 of
the meet's 13 events and recorded
the top exhibition times in two oth
ers. The Cardinal were led by fresh
man Julia Smit. junior Brooke Bish
op and senior Cassidy Krug. all
whom won two individual events
each.
Smit took first in the 200 individ
ual medley and 200 backstroke. She
also reached the NCAA "A" stan
dard in both events with respective
times of 1 minute 59.47 seconds and
1:57.46. She was the only swimmer
for either team to get an "A" time on
Friday. Smit also swam the leadoff
100 back leg in Stanford's winning
400 medley relay team.
Bishop recorded victories and
NCAA "B" times in both the 50 and
100 freestyle and anchored Stan
ford's 400 medley relay squad. Krug
swept both the one-meter and three
meter diving events. Junior Elizabeth
Durot, freshman Elaine Breeden
and senior Desiree Stahley also won
individual events for the Cardinal.
Stanford's win came after placing
second to Arizona in December's
Texas Invitational, so the Cardinal
knew that the Wildcats would be stiff
competition.
"We were feeling tired and a little
nervous because Arizona is a really
tough team that has a good chance to
win the NCAAs in March," said
Stanford head coach Lea Maurer.
"But. we set the tone early in the
meet and kept the momentum going,
never gave it up."
The Cardinal also had to combat
fatigue following their intense weeks
of double practices over winter
break.
"We knew we were tired, but it re
ally started off well with winning the
relay and the 1000 free, and that kind
of got everyone rolling," Bishop said.
"l was really happy that we won the
sprints and did so well in those
events. Doing that well in the sprints
was really exciting because that's
Arizona's specialty."
Stanford carried the momentum
into Saturday's meet against Arizona
State as Cardinal swimmers took
first place in the meet's first seven
events. Smit continued to shine when
she won the 50 freestyle, 200
freestyle and 200 breaststroke. Bish
op and krug finished out their suc
cessful weekends with two individual
wins each. Just as on Friday, Krug
took first in both the one-meter and
three-meter diving events.
"She's definitely the premier
diver in the Pac-10 right now, but our
goals are far beyond that," said Stan
ford head diving coach Rick
Schavone. "Our goal is to make her
the top diver in the country and win

ning now will help her confidence in
the postseason."
After this weekend's perform
ance, Krug is confident and ready to
continue to compete at a high level.
"1 feel like I'm diving better than
I ever have right now," Krug said.
"My good days are better than ever,
and I just really need to work on
being consistent and bringing up the
bad days â€” that's my focus."
Junior Caroline Bruce swam the
only "A" time of the meet for either
team when she captured the 100
breast in 1:01.55. Bruce's 100 breast
swim was one of the most notable
for the Cardinal; she finished 4.34
seconds ahead of her closest com
petitor.
"It was a great race for Caroline."
said Maurer. "it was a tough assign
ment considering where we are in
our training, but she showed tremen

dous speed and going that fast when
she is tired is a really positive sign."
Stanford' success this weekend
points to good things on the horizon
for the Cardinal, with three months
to go until the NCAA champi
onships.
"After a tough meet against Arizona
yesterday, I was really proud of the way
we dug deep to find a way to race again
today," Maurer said. "We've been
training really hard and beating our
selves up in the pool during practice, so
it was nice t< > race someone else and be
able to help each other."
The Cardinal will race again next
weekend when they host No. 14
UCLA and No. 11 Southern Califor
nia in their final two home meets of
the season. Friday and Saturday. Sat
urday's meet against the Trojans will
be the final home event for Stan
ford's four seniors.
