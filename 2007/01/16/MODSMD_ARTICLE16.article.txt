At Arizona, Stanford won 10 of
the meet's 13 events and recorded
the top exhibition times in two oth
ers. The Cardinal were led by fresh
man Julia Smit. junior Brooke Bish
op and senior Cassidy Krug. all
whom won two individual events
each.
Smit took first in the 200 individ
ual medley and 200 backstroke. She
also reached the NCAA "A" stan
dard in both events with respective
times of 1 minute 59.47 seconds and
1:57.46. She was the only swimmer
for either team to get an "A" time on
Friday. Smit also swam the leadoff
100 back leg in Stanford's winning
400 medley relay team.
Bishop recorded victories and
NCAA "B" times in both the 50 and
100 freestyle and anchored Stan
ford's 400 medley relay squad. Krug
swept both the one-meter and three
meter diving events. Junior Elizabeth
Durot, freshman Elaine Breeden
and senior Desiree Stahley also won
individual events for the Cardinal.
Stanford's win came after placing
second to Arizona in December's
Texas Invitational, so the Cardinal
knew that the Wildcats would be stiff
competition.
"We were feeling tired and a little
nervous because Arizona is a really
tough team that has a good chance to
win the NCAAs in March," said
Stanford head coach Lea Maurer.
"But. we set the tone early in the
meet and kept the momentum going,
never gave it up."
The Cardinal also had to combat
fatigue following their intense weeks
of double practices over winter
break.
"We knew we were tired, but it re
ally started off well with winning the
relay and the 1000 free, and that kind
of got everyone rolling," Bishop said.
