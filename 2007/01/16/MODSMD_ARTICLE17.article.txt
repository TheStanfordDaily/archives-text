### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON STAFF WRITER 
New football coach Jim Har
baugh led his first official workouts
with the team on Saturday. A crowd
of about one hundred friends of the
program joined high-school players
on recruiting visits in observing.
The players performed several
footwork and calisthenics exercises
in team lines, then split into position
groups for further work.
At the conclusion of the workout,
the team huddled around I larbaugh.
He called for each senior to intro
duce himself and state something
personal.
Upon mention of a fraternity,
Harbaugh brought the house down
by facing his palms away from his
ears in a sign of the Greek letter
Omega.
College football teams go
through strength and conditioning
workouts during the winter in prepa
ration for spring practice. The work
outs consist of non-football exercises
such as running, footwork and
weightlifting to provide strength and
speed gains that carry through the
fall season. Teams are prohibited
from conducting full-on practices
with pads and footballs until the
spring practice period begins.
