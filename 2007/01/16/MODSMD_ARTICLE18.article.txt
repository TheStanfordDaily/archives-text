team is a hard job that's not getting any easi
er for Washington State.
The No. l ) Cardinal (14-3. 7-0 Pac-10)
overcame a sloppy performance to beat the
Cougars 63-55 on Saturday, pushing their all
time record versus Washington State to 43-0.
Freshman point guard JJ 1 lones went six-tor
seven— and three-for-three from three
point range — as she led Stanford with a ca
reer-high 17 points.
Stanford started the game hot. tallying 10
points before the Cougars (5-13.1-7 Pac-10)
could score a basket. Hie (Cardinal extended
their lead to as many as 16 in the first half be

within eight by the break. But senior forward
Brooke Smith scored 10 of her 12 points in
the second half to supplement Hones and
lead the Cardinal to victory.
Smith again just missed out on an elusive
triple-double, finishing with 12 points. I ((assists

Freshman center Jayne Appel turned in
another double-digit scoring performance,
netting 10 points, while senior center kristen
Newlin pulled down 10 boards to go along
with her eight points.
Washington State was spearheaded by 17
points apiece from the inside-outside combo
of freshman forward Marisa Stotler and soph
omore guard Amanda Dußocher. Still the
duo's strength wasn't enough for the Cougars
as they got within six points of the Cardinal in
the late going, but could not pull ahead.
Stanford shot 47.3 percent from the floor
and held Washington State to a 37.9 field
goal percentage. It was the fifteenth game

NOTES: Junior guard Candice Wiggins, nursing a
sprained right ankle, missed her third game of the
year. Wiggins suffered the injury during the firs* half
of Stanford s 77-56 win at Washington on Thurs
day and did not practice with the team as a pre
caution on Friday afternoon. She is expected to
play against Oregon on Jan. 18.
rest of their game left something to be de
sired.
Junior guard Candice Wiggins missed
her third game of the season after spraining
her right ankle against Washington two
days before, and Stanford clearly missed
her presence and consistency in the back
court. The Cardinal committed 20
turnovers against the Cougars, one of their
weakest opponents of the season, despite
averaging only 14.6 turnovers per game en
tering the contest.
Stanford suffered in other departments as
well, with the most notable being capitalizing
on fouls. ITie Cardinal went an anemic 6-for
-13 (46.2 percent) from the free throw line and
actually shot better from the field on the day.
Stanford next takes the court when it
hosts the Oregon Ducks at Maples Pavilion.
7 p.m. on Thursday.
