## Pub Night gone wild in Menlo Park Seniors complain of long waits, line hopping, juniors at BBC 
### DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT MANAGING EDITOR 
The BBC is an old Menlo Park h;ink turned
nightclub, but the mob scene outside its doors
Thursday night looked more like a Depres
sion-era bank run than a Pub Night venue.
Seniors complained about overcrowding
and a preponderance of juniors as they stood
in the bitter cold, some for more than 45 min
utes. to get into the bar. Those that dutifully
waited watched in increasing frustration as
many of their classmates and some juniors and
sophomores cut the line. Once inside, swelling
crowds turned many students off.
"A football player stepped on my foot."
said senior Natalie Ramirez, who said she
waited in line for 45 minutes before getting in.
"I went to the bathroom,came back down and
wanted to leave, but my friends wanted to stay
and make do. But you shouldn't have to have
to make do at a Pub Night."
Senior Class President FarisAli Mohiuddin
