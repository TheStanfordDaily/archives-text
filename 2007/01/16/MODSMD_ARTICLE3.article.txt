## Pub Night gone wild in Menlo Park Seniors complain of long waits, line hopping, juniors at BBC 
### DAVID GAUVEY HERBERT MANAGING EDITOR 
The BBC is an old Menlo Park h;ink turned
nightclub, but the mob scene outside its doors
Thursday night looked more like a Depres
sion-era bank run than a Pub Night venue.
Seniors complained about overcrowding
and a preponderance of juniors as they stood
in the bitter cold, some for more than 45 min
utes. to get into the bar. Those that dutifully
waited watched in increasing frustration as
many of their classmates and some juniors and
sophomores cut the line. Once inside, swelling
crowds turned many students off.
"A football player stepped on my foot."
said senior Natalie Ramirez, who said she
waited in line for 45 minutes before getting in.
"I went to the bathroom,came back down and
wanted to leave, but my friends wanted to stay
and make do. But you shouldn't have to have
to make do at a Pub Night."
Senior Class President FarisAli Mohiuddin
acknowledged that while the bar is
smaller than other past Pub Night
venues, he said he chose it because
seniors had been clamoring for a
Pub Night outside of Palo Alto.
"This was the first week in which
we were able to host a Senior Night
in Menlo Park, so we thought it
would be a good way to kick off the
year on a different note than Illu
sions." he said in an email to The
Daily. Illusions is a popular Pub
Night venue on California Ave.
Still. Mohiuddin deflected blame
for the overcrowding from the venue
and onto the BBC management,
who he said initially admitted stu
dents too slowly before he and the
rest of the senior class cabinet mem
bers negotiated with them to expe

dite the process.The first Pub Nights
of the quarter are traditionally the
most crowded, as returning students
congregate to catch up.
As for the line cutting. Mohiud
din said that since locals are at Pub
Night venues too, his hands are tied
to stop line cutting by Stanford stu
dents and non-Stanford students
alike.
The latest troubles are not the
first Pub Night woes for seniors. TTie
weekly event did not kick off until
the middle of October as senior class
presidents sought to reassure the Of
fice of Student Activities that the
problems that plagued Pub Night
last year — from fighting at bars to
vomiting on Marguerites — would
be minimized. Mohiuddin and the
other class presidents eventually had
seniors sign a 500-word participation
agreement that, among other things,
had students promise to identify
themselves to sober monitors if they
vomited on the shuttle.
