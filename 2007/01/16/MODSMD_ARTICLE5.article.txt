### ADAM SOWLATI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a two-year hiatus, the Movie Ex
press returned Friday, ferry ing students
to the AMC Mercado 25 in Santa Clara.
Hie free shuttle will run ever)' Friday
from 8:30 p.m. until 2 a.m.. picking stu
dents up from Roble Hall. Tresidder
Union and the intersection of Campus
Drive and Escondido Road.
Many students, especially freshman,

who are not allowed to keep cars on cam
pus, say they relish the opportunity to es
cape campus and enjoy a night at the
movies.
"Being an RA in an all-frosh dorm,
many of my residents seem to think the
shuttle is useful to go see a movie and
enjoy a night outside of the sometimes
suffocating Stanford bubble," said ASSU
Senator Hershey Avula.also a junior RA
in Branner.in an email to The Daily."ln
fact, this past Friday, I was talking to some
of my residents and they were telling me
that they were planning on using the
shuttle to catch dinner and a movie to cel
ebrate one of their birthdays."
The ASSU, which runs the shuttle,
chose the AMC Mercado because of
its size and the surrounding restau
rants.
"The location is great," said fresh
man Brian Aguado. "There seem to be
many good restaurants and sushi bars.
There's even an In-N-Out."
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
is also hoping to make stores and
restaurants in the area more afford
able by using a program called Stan

ford Savers to negotiate discounts for
students.
However, some believe that the
AMC Mercado is too far away from
campus.
"I think the Movie Express is a
great idea because there is no movie
theater on campus," said freshman
Dean Schafler. also a copy editor for
the Daily."l only wish it didn't take 30
minutes to get the AMC Mercado."
According to ASSU Senator
Nabill Idrisi, a junior, the Movie fix
press was cancelled in the spring of
2004 due to lack of student interest
and a change in the Marguerite's ven
dors. At the time. Parking and Trans
portation Services, not the ASSU. ran
the service.

Efforts to revive the Movie Ex
press began last spring, and ASSU
President Elizabeth Heng, a senior,
drafted a proposal over the summer
and submitted it to the President's Of
fice. which will cover the $3000-plus
price tag for the service this quarter.
Nabill said he is optimistic about
the future of the service.
"I hope that public transportation
within this area continues to improve
and become more valuable for Stan
ford students, faculty, staff, and com
munity members," Nabill said. "By
identifying needs and ensuring that
Stanford members know and take ad
vantage of new projects like these, we
can use the shuttle service expansion
to improve the overall community."
