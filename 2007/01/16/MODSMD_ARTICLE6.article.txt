SAMMY ABUSRUR/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore guard Anthony Goods shoots over Washington State's Kyle Weaver. 1 he
Cardinal won 71 -68, while Goods earned Pac-10 Player of the Week honors.
Goods, who matched his career-high 30
points against a scrappy Washington State
squad, had the hot hand all night, knocking
down 11 of his 16 shots, including 5-of-8 from
beyond the three-point line. But none mat
tered as much as his last-second three-point
er over the outstretched arm of b-foot-6
Cougar forward Ivory Clark.
With the game tied at 68-68 and just 33
seconds left in overtime, the Cardinal took
control of the ball following a missed free
throw b\ Clark. After a Stanford timeout.
Goods held for the last shot, using a screen
on the right elbow to try to get free. But in
stead of coming around the screen, the BYU
defenders switched men and Clark stepped
out to put a hand in Goods face. Goods hit
the shot anyway.
"I just pulled back, put on a little hesita
tion move, and let it go." Goods said.
"On that play at the end. we did exactly
what we wanted to do defensively." Washing
ton State coach Pony Bennett said. "We
made him take a tough shot, and he hit it."
A halt-court attempt by forward Daven
I larmeling at the buzzer missed its mark.
Saturday's heroics marked the second
time in Goods' career that he hit a game-win
ning shot against Washington State. He laid
m an offensive rebound in the closing sec
onds of last season's contest in Pullman.
Wash, to give Stanford a 39-37 victory.
Parlier in Saturday's game, it appeared
Goods had already delivered the game-win
ning shot. The Corona. C'alif.-native hit a
three-pointer nearly 30 feet from the basket
to give the Cardinal a 57-50 lead with 3:39 left
to play in the second half.
"Anthony Goods had a special game,"
Bennett said. "He was able to get by our guys,
and that was a heck of a shot at the end of the
game. 1 tip my hat to him."

I just pulled
back, put
on a little
hesitation move,
and let it go.

Junior forward Taj Finger added two free
throws just moments later to extend Stan
ford's lead to a game-high nine points.
But the Cougars did not go down quiet
ly. Harmeling hit a pair of three-pointers
and Clark had four points in the final 1:30
of regulation as the Cougars outscored the
Cardinal 10-1 in the last 2:47. forcing an
overtime.
"Washington State is a very good team,
but we certainly made some defensive break
downs late in the game," Stanford coach
Trent Johnson said. "The important thing is
how we respond to those breakdowns."
Stanford had a chance to break the tie in
the closing seconds of regulation. Following a

dunk by Clark on an inbounds pass that tied
the game at 60-60. Goods ran the clock down
to 10 seconds before missing a tough jumper
from about 12 feet.
Cougars guard Kyle Weaver lost control
of the ball on Washington State's last chance,
and the game went to overtime.
The final possession was one of few mis
takes that Weaver made in the game. He fin
ished with what is believed to be the first
triple-double in Washington State history.
Hie 6-foot-6 guard tallied 14 points, 13 re
bounds. 10assists,sixsteals and a block,while
only turning over the ball three times.
Lawrence I lill was the only other Stanford
player with a double-digit point total. Hie
sophomore forward notched 15 points and
nine rebounds. Freshman forward Brook
Lopez added eight points and 10 boards, while
his brother freshman center Robin scored just
five points, all from the free-throw line, but he
also controlled eight rebounds.
Both Lopez twins sat out the final 3:02 of
the overtime period to try to match up better
with the Cougars' small lineup.
"It was a bad matchup for us at the end."
Johnson said. "Robin got a little frustrated.
The last thing I wanted was to have Brook
and Robin guard guards. We had Lawrence
and Taj who are more mobile."
It turns out that the move paid off for
Johnson. Hill hit a crucial three-pointer in
the overtime period to set up Goods' final
shot.
Washington State took a 27-26 lead into
the break at halftime behind 10 first-half
points from guard Derrick Low. Low fin
ished the game with a team-high 16 points.
The victory was the third consecutive con
test that went the Cardinal's way in dramatic
fashion. Stanford beat Virginia, 76-75,0n Jan.
6 and Washinuton. 78-77, on Thursday.
