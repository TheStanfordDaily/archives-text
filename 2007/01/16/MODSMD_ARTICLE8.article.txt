## US arranges three-way summit to jump start Middle East peace Rice meets with Arab allies, sets goal of Palestinian state 
### ANNE GEARAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
I 1 XOR. Egypt — I loping to breathe life
into moribund peace efforts, the United
Suites will gather Israeli and Palestinian
leaders to discuss an eventual independent
Palestinian state. President Bush's top diplo
mat said Monday.
Secretar\ of State Condoleezza Rice also
asked Arab allies to help support the fragile
government in Iraq, on whose success much
of Bush's new plan to turn the war around
will depend.
The three-way U.S.-lsraeli-Palestinian
meeting would be the first among the main
parties thought necessary to draft any settle
ment in the six-decade-long dispute. It repre
sents more direct involvement from a U.S.
administration that has sometimes viewed
Mideast peacemaking as a fool's errand.
"The parties haven't talked about these
issues for a long time," Rice told reporters
following a meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in this southern Egyptian
town following a three-day visit to Israel and
the Palestinian territories.
It's been at least six years since they
talked about these issues," Rice said. "It
seems wise to begin this ... informal discus
sion. to |ust really sit and talk about the is
sues."
Diplomats described a preliminary ses
sion meant to build confidence after years of
fighting and rhetorical sniping.
It is designed to strengthen Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas in his internal
power struggle with Palestinian Islamic mili
tants and to offer Palestinians a glimpse of
their future that makes negotiating with Is
rael seem worthwhile.
Instead of talking about the daily frictions
and threats that define the deeply mistrustful
Israeli Palestinian relationship, an informal

session could look ahead to what Rice has
called broader issues, and certainly more at
tractive ones, U.S. officials said.
"It's very clear what we mean by broader
issues,'" Rice said. "We mean what would
lead to the establishment of a Palestinian
state."
Recent prospects for Mideast peace have
looked dim. with the Hamas radicals in
ch irge of much of the Palestinian govern
ment, street clashes among the Palestinian
factions, a Western aid cutoff and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's weakened
political position following Israel's summer
war in Lebanon.
Abbas and Olmert agreed to attend the
session, to be held in three or four weeks,dur
ing their separate weekend meetings with
Rice, U.S. officials said. Rice would represent
the United States, with the thought that Bush
could participate at a future session if initial
discussions go well.
In Israel. Olmert confirmed the planned
session with Rice and Abbas.
Saeb Erekat, an aide to Abbas, could not
confirm whether Abbas would attend, but
said "in principle" the Palestinians are pre
pared to take part. He praised Rice's atten
tiveness during a session with Abbas in his
Ramallah headquarters Sunday.
"She reflected seriousness, interest,"
Erekat said. "She reflected an understanding
of the bigger picture of what is going on in the
region, and the need to put this thing behind
us, the Arab-Israeli conflict."
U.S. officials said Rice wanted to capital
ize on momentum from a much-awaited
meeting between Olmert and Abbas, which
was held last month. Abbas reminded Rice
that Israel has not delivered on promises
from that meeting, and U.S. officials want to
nudge the two leaders to keep talking.
The Hush administration has devoted
more effort to resolving the conflict in Bush's
second term in office, and Rice has said Bush
wants to make a mark on the process before
he leaves office in two years. A final settle
ment, with permanent borders for a function
ing Palestinian state, is seen as several years

off even under the best scenario.
A second Palestinian uprising, or intifada,
began a few months before Bush took office
in 2001, and Bush's administration was
sharply critical of terror attacks against Israel
but seemingly more tolerant of Israeli retali
ation.
Periodic Palestinian rocket attacks and
other clashes continue, as does Israel's ex
pansion of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and the building of a high security wall
through parts of the West Bank near
Jerusalem.
Bush got some credit for declaring early
support for an independent Palestinian state,
and for calling that eventual nation Palestine.
An independent Palestinian state along
side Israel is the goal of a dormant U.S.-
backed peace plan Bush unveiled in 2003.
That plan is still on the table. Rice said, but
the new talks essentially skip past difficult
initial concessions the plan requires of both
sides.
United Nations Secretary-General Ban
ki-moon "still insists" that the so-called
Quartet — the U.N., the U.S., Russia and
China — will meet to resume talks on a
peace plan, probably in early February, a
spokeswoman said.
Ban spoke to Rice several times about the
Mideast before she left on her trip "so he has
been very much informed of what the Amer
ican initiative is on that count," U.N. spokes
woman Michele Montassaid Monday at U.N.
headquarters in New York.
Mubarak is one of several Arab leaders
who have been urging Washington to use its
influence to restart peace talks. Saudi King
Abdullah, with whom Rice had dinner Mon
day. is another. Ahead of her visit there, polit
ical cartoons in Saudi Arabia lampooned her
peace efforts as inadequate or improbable.
One depicted Rice laboring to pump air into
a leaky tire labeled "peace process."
Rice had tried to downplay prospects for
any breakthroughs on this trip, saying she
was mostly hoping to listen to both sides.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul
Gheit said Egypt is a potential host for the

three-way meeting, which he suggested could
ease tension and open a path to more sub
stantive talks later.
"They have not been doing anything but
fighting each other for the last six years."
Gheit said.
Arab allies have been asking the Bush ad
ministration to work harder for an Israeli-
Palestinian peace settlement, arguing that
the lingering conflict undermines efforts to
make progress on other Mideast problems,

including in Iraq and Iran.
In Jordan on Sunday, Abdullah told Rice
that he wants Washington to apply as much
diplomatic energy on the Israeli-Palestinian
matter as on Iraq.
Abdullah "called on the United States to
actively push for a revival of Palestinian-Is
raeli peace negotiations that would lead to
the establishment of a viable, independent
Palestinian state." a Jordanian government
statement said.
