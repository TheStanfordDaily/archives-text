# Interviews reveal Ford's candor
## Called Carter a disaster, thought Reagan got too much credit 
### THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GRAND RAPIDS. Mich. — In 25 years
of interviews with his hometown paper that
could only be released upon his death, for
mer President Ford once called Jimmy
Carter a "disaster" who ranked alongside
Warren Harding, and said Ronald Reagan
received far too much credit for ending the
Cold War.
"It makes me very irritated when Rea
gan's people pound their chests and say that
because we had this big military buildup, the
Kremlin collapsed," Ford told Hie Grand
Rapids Press.
Hie best president of his lifetime. Ford
said, was a more moderate Republican:
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Harry Truman "would get very high
marks" for his handling of foreign crises,
lord said. He also praised Richard Nixon as
a foreign policy master, despite the Water
gate scandal that drove him from office.

Ford considered John F. Kennedy over
rated and Bill Clinton average. He admired
George H.W. Bush's handling of the Persian
Gulf War and had mixed opinions of Carter,
who defeated Ford in l l )76.
In 1981, Ford said:"l think Jimmy Carter
would be very close to Warren G. 1 larding. I
feel very strongly that Jimmy Carter was a
disaster, particularly domestically and eco
nomically. I have said more than once that he
was certainly the poorest president in my
lifetime."
But two years later, he praised Carter's
performance on the Panama Canal treaty,
China and the Middle East. And in 19 l ) 8, he
said Carter "will he looked on as a better
president than some comments we hear
today."
"He was a very decent, fine individual,"
Ford told the paper. "There were no major
mistakes. There just weren't a lot of exciting
results."
Ford's gave the interviews on the condi
tion that his remarks be withheld until after
his death.
According to the newspaper. Ford de
clined to rate George W. Bush, saying he did
not know him well enough.

Ford said Reagan, who challenged him
unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination in
1976, was "a great spokesman for attractive
political objectives" such as a balanced
budget and defeating communism, "but
when it came to implementation, his record
never matched his words."
Reagan was "probably the least well-in
formed on the details of running the govern
ment of any president 1 knew," Ford said. In
a separate interview, he said Reagan "was
just a poor manager, and you can't be presi
dent and do a good job unless you manage."
Ford contended his own negotiation of
the Helsinki accords on human rights did
more to win the Cold War than Reagan's
military buildup. Other key factors were the
Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Europe
after World War II and the establishment of
NATO, he said.
"When you put peace, prosperity and
human rights against poverty, a massive un
successful military program and a lack of
human rights, communism was bound to col
lapse," he said. "No president, no Democrat
or Republican, can claim credit for those
programs. I'll tell you who deserves the cred
it — the American people."
