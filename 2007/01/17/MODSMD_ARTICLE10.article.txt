V 'alley girls insert "like" into the holes
ol their oral eommunieations.
teenagers inelude "you know" into
many ol their dialogues. Stanford students,
however, fill the gaps of their in-class com
ments with "juxtaposition."
Although "juxtaposition" is far and
away the most frequently-heard word in
fuzzy lectures, discussion sections and all
other professor-student interactions, it is
just one ol the lop 10 Catchwords of the
I itcrati. Ihe repeated usage of these chosen
terms by the upper echelons of intelligentsia
transforms them into, essentially, the "you
knows ol the tenured track. To sound
smart.you need not learn hundreds of GUI'
words, or switch your internet homepage to
wordaday.com. In fact.all that is required to
impress your peers, professors and often
times even yourself is to master the Top 10
list.
Written in increasing order ol frequency,
t he lop 10 ( atchwords of the I itcrati are as
follows:
10) leonoelasm
9) Übiquitous
N) Paradoxically
7) Suhjective/c>bjeelive
ft) Duality
5) Feminist
4) Ironic
3) Dichotomy
2) Race/ethnicity
I) Juxtaposition
l ooking to Ms. Alanis Morisette's un
lortunate blunder in the late '90s as a lesson
for us all. a solid understanding of these 10
words guarantees any student an opportu
nity to climb up the vocabulary-slinging,
multi-svllabic word-dropping, intellectual
ladder. In I act, every title of every book that
every Stanlord professor has ever pub
lished actually contains one of these words.
Additionally, the statistics further demon
strate that every A paper includes on aver
age six words from the Top 10 list, while the
average li paper contains merely three to
four.
With these 10 words, long gone are the
days ol the l-tried-really-hard-but-still
only-got-a-IJ-t- paper.the low section partic
ipation grades and the avoidant eye contact
that so olten follows a professor's question.
Ihe lop 10 lisi turns any shy. Un-read stu
dent into the threateningly well-prepared
for-elass tiger whose ferocity at question
answering is equaled only by her expansive
vocabulary. Seemingly expansive vocabu
lary. that is.
I he real beauty of the Top 10 list, howev
er. is the fact that you are saying nothing
even though it sounds like you are saying a
whole lot. For example, you could say in any
lu/zy class at any particular moment:
"Paradoxically, the juxtaposition of the two
characters in this scene not only highlights
their dichotomous relationship but under
emphasizes it as well." It would not only
perfectly pertain to the situation at hand,
but it would catapult you into the profes
sor's first-class, ultra-good, would-write-a

glowing-recommendation-letter-for-you
side. All those times Call-on-me McGee
spoke in class and you admired his impres
sive on-the-spot responses, he was really
just crossing off different words from the
lop 10 list. Now you 100 have the knowl
edge to be able to respond to a professor's
inquires with timely well-formulated com
ments.
Another notable bonus of the I ist is how
easily all ol the 10 words rearrange and
combine with one another, lor example,
there are ironic paradoxes and quite para
doxically there are many ironies. 111 ere is
übiquitous juxtaposition in this feminist
work, although in our reading last week, the
juxtaposition of the übiquitous phallic and
vaginal symbols commenced a feminist cri
tique of the work.
If you aren't up to arranging a lew
prepositions in between the lop 10 list's
words, you can always just bring up race,
ethnicity or feminism. In fact, two-thirds of
all in-class college discussions are actually
regarding the fact that a) women have had
it tough in the past, b) there was once slav
ery in the U.S. and c) some people are not
Anglo-Saxon. If your professor offers a
particularly baffling question, has such a
strong Scottish accent th.it he makes Sean
( onnery sound like a speech coach or you
awaken just as the professor points to you
and asks for your thoughts on the matter,
you can always reply, "Hut how does race
and ethnicity alleet this reading?" or per
haps try."But is that in light of a feminist ar
gument?" Not only does the return ques
tion give the professor a dose of his own
medicine, but it also makes you seem cul
turally. racially and femininely sensitive to
your peers.
And as a last resort, if you are really
crashing and burning — having a true may
day— you can always add, "Mut aren't we
being too subjective here?" Thirty minutes
ol heated debate are sure to ensue, at the
end ol which you can lean back in your
chair, tilt your head to the side, squint, bite
the end of your pen and add,"l was just try
ing to view the situation as objectively as
possible."

characters in this scene not only highlights
their dichotomous relationship but under
emphasizes it as well." It would not only
perfectly pertain to the situation at hand,
but it would catapult you into the profes
sor's first-class, ultra-good, would-write-a

glowing-recommendation-letter-for-you
side. All those times Call-on-me McGee
spoke in class and you admired his impres
sive on-the-spot responses, he was really
just crossing off different words from the
lop 10 list. Now you 100 have the knowl
edge to be able to respond to a professor's
inquires with timely well-formulated com
ments.
Another notable bonus of the I ist is how
easily all ol the 10 words rearrange and
combine with one another, lor example,
there are ironic paradoxes and quite para
doxically there are many ironies. 111 ere is
übiquitous juxtaposition in this feminist
work, although in our reading last week, the
juxtaposition of the übiquitous phallic and
vaginal symbols commenced a feminist cri
tique of the work.
If you aren't up to arranging a lew
prepositions in between the lop 10 list's
words, you can always just bring up race,
ethnicity or feminism. In fact, two-thirds of
all in-class college discussions are actually
regarding the fact that a) women have had
it tough in the past, b) there was once slav
ery in the U.S. and c) some people are not
Anglo-Saxon. If your professor offers a
particularly baffling question, has such a
strong Scottish accent th.it he makes Sean
( onnery sound like a speech coach or you
awaken just as the professor points to you
and asks for your thoughts on the matter,
you can always reply, "Hut how does race
and ethnicity alleet this reading?" or per
haps try."But is that in light of a feminist ar
gument?" Not only does the return ques
tion give the professor a dose of his own
medicine, but it also makes you seem cul
turally. racially and femininely sensitive to
your peers.
And as a last resort, if you are really
crashing and burning — having a true may
day— you can always add, "Mut aren't we
being too subjective here?" Thirty minutes
ol heated debate are sure to ensue, at the
end ol which you can lean back in your
chair, tilt your head to the side, squint, bite
the end of your pen and add,"l was just try
ing to view the situation as objectively as
possible."
Why read 500 pages of "Jane Fyre"
when all you need is a good look of contem
plation and a few well-placed voeab words?
