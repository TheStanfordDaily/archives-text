# My sister, the frosh
## 
### 
So I have a kid sister who is a freshman in
a college far away from here. She calls
me and emails me every so often with
trite freshman news that is so stereotypical I
just have to laugh. She's done some things
that, when you get to be my age, you look
back on with regret. "Oh. I was young. I was
immature." 1 enjoy our conversations, be
cause I guess by looking back at the mistakes
she's making. I can see my own mistakes
more clearly.
I once ran with a different crowd. As
freshmen, we made bold declarations like
we d bring back sweater vests and reinvent
the paper clip. We wrote fan fiction for .loss
Whcton TV shows that he hadn't even writ
ten yet. Not episodes, but entire shows. We
wrote a blog set in 1999 espousing the mer
its of sweater vests and another blog set in
2003 mocking sweater vests while we wore
sweater vests. We were that met a. We were
young; we were naive. We were hipster
gods.
So I smiled knowingly when she began to
tell me her own stories. In the first few weeks,
she got a tattoo wit h some of her dorm mates.
I had a long phone conversation about that
one. I .ook at me. I had never had a tattoo and
I was really cool and only sort of wish I not
that tattoo that said "Mom" on my bicep dur
ing my frosh scavenger hunt. Hut she was re
ally adamant about getting this ancient
French design of royalty. I told her we're not
I Tench. I told her we're not royalty. 1 told her
our family isn't ancient. She told me that
Mom never loved me. At this point, my cell
dropped the call. And threw itself against a
wall, louche.sister, louche.

She got a significant other her first three
weeks of college. I remember my first col
lege relationship. Junior year. Poor girl, she's
going t(.i look back on that relationship in
years to come and realize that it was just her
wanting a college relationship, not really
wanting the person she's with. I haven't had
the heart to tell her this, however, as she's
still with him. I met him at Christmas. Nice
guy. My mom says he's "the son she never
had."
Ihen there was the phone call that she got
discovered by a talent agent. 110-hum. One
appearance on an MTV reality show later
and you'd think this was the first time some
one had stumbled upon fame their freshman
semester in college. Why. I remember getting
a quote in the college paper during my fresh
man semester. I don't mean to brag but
('hristen I lollt was immortalized for all eter
nity in the college paper. You can google it. A
couple million people will see her bare her
soul on television and it'll get burned off an
other dozen times on reruns. Big Deal.
I get tired of her hearing about her new
friends. Yes.college friends are very different
than high school friends. Yes. some of them

may be famous. Hut she sure makes a big deal
that she goes clubbing with various Holly
wood-type kids and how she's getting flown
to Ron Howards island fortress for Christ
mas. A simple "I'm busy" would have suf
ficed. I mean, I have famous friends too. It's
Stanlord. I lived down the hall from the guy
who invented that one hot program that lets
you download porn faster. We eat in the same
dining hall every day. You get used to know
ing celebrities in college, so she shouldn't
make a big deal about landing that support
ing role in Xach Hraff's next production. Silly
freshman.
Now she's in some kind of band. I play
trumpet, so she didn't have to point out what
it's like being ina band. As the lead singer. Of
a band already signed to HM(i. When she's
no longer a freshman, she'll realize that try
ing everything is fun your freshman year but
you re going to want to cut down on the
childish commitments later on and buckle
down on your work. I was really into the
high-profile exciting life of the student gov
ernment at one point too. but I realized it was
a fad. Starting a rock band that has a mild fol
lowing on (lie Internet and is in negotiations
with a label? I doubt she'll still be interested
in something like I his during her senior year.
I hope she grows out of these freshman
trends soon, though, because I think the kid
has a bright future.
