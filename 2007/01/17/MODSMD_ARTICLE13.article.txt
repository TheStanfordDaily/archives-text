to an intimate gathering in Mar
garet Jacks Hall in the morning be
fore reading from his novella "On
( hesil 1 leach" to a packed house m
Kresge Auditorium last night and
addressing issues ranging from the
publishing industry writing style
and literary fame.
"When I started writing fiction in
the l l J7()s. it was rather an obscure
ambition," said Mel wan. who ap
peared as part of the Creative Writ
ing Department's .lean ami liill
Fane Lecture Series. "Writing fic
tion for a mainstream publishing
house was seen as a stuffy gentle
manly thing to do. It changed some
time in the early 80s it acquired a
whiff of celebrity ol the most tawdry
sort."
Mel wan said he has been work
ing on the novella for the past si\
months, which w.is published in llic
New Yorker last December. The
story describes the insecurities and
misadventures of a virginal voting
British couple on their wedding
night in I %2. (>nc of the ke\ themes
in the novella, Ms I w an said, was ex
ploring the myth of sexual freedom
surrounding the I ( M()s.
"I've got a feeling there was a
great gap between presentation ol
sexuality in movies and magazines
and everyone's private nervous
nesses and insecurities and fears."
he said. "Partially. I wanted to put
this story out and see il it meant any -
thing to a twenty-year-old now. or if
to them the situation seems simple,
two people can just "get it on.'"
Mel-wan has written in varying
stvles during his career, ranginn

from collections of short stories to a
children's book."()n ('licsil Beach"
is a short work, weighing in at 37.0(H)
words At the colloquium, Mel-wan
reflected on the specific demands of
novellas.
"What I love about the length is
it's a bit like going to ;i movie for a
reader." he said. "A reader can sit
and digest it in two or three hours
and hold the whole shape of it in his
mind at once, which one can't do
with a novel. A novella is something
like a short story but with a space for
psychology, a space for people."
Another major recent project
has been the libretto for an opera
focusing on the womanizing of an
elderly conductor.
"I both love and hate operas." he
said "I love the music but hate the
plots â€” too many people turning
into oranges or pumpkins, too much
lain tale, lliey bring such serious
emotional intensity to the music and
st> little to the plots Is it possible to
sing one's wa\ through a serious
psychological episode?"
Mel wan is also currently acting
as Incentive Producer for the film
adaptati mi ol his novel "Atone
ment," directed by Joe Wright
("Pride and Prejudice") and star
ring Kicra Knightly and Vanessa
Redgrave Although Mel wan has
adapted his own works in the past,
he says lie elected not to write the
screenplay for "Atonement."
"I've done screenplays before
and know it's hard to do your own
stuff." he explained. "It's infuriating
to t.ike something you've written
and be told. "No. this character
wouldn't say that.' It's as though
you're writing by committee. I'd
rather ruin someone else's novel."
Ilk audience greeted Mclwan's
