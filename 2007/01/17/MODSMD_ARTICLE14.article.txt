# IN FOCUS
## Prof reflects on prose and passions Eavan Boland speaks of life as a poet and teacher 
### VAUGHAN MEYER 
English Professor Eavan Boland has written
some today's most celebrated poetry. She has
published nine books, written essays for The New
Yorker and American Poetry Review and penned
a large selection of reviews and critiques. When I
sat down to talk with her. however, she down
played her notable achievements and chose in
stead to focus on the cultural and personal devel
opment that has shaped her as a poet, teacher and
Irish-American.
When describing her path towards becoming a
professional poet, Boland picked apart my idea
of what poetry was and rebuilt it.
She said first that a poet is "what you are, not
what you do...[it is] inside oneself, when one be
comes a poet."
Boland delineated the distance between writ
ing poetry and being a poet, telling me she did not
feel she had become a poet until her late twenties,
well after she had published her first collection of
poems. According to Boland, a poet does not
even have to write poems.
"In the West." she told me, "a poem is on a
page. In many places, poems go beyond the page."
Yet Boland never described herself solely as a
poet; instead, she adamantly affirmed herself to
be among the ranks of the teaching poets, those
writers whose word craft interconnects with their
role as an instructor.
At the end of our hearty discussion of words

and labels she paused and said,"Put all the titles
you like, but it's really a continuum."
Much of Boland's poetry deals with immigra
tion. exile and the Irish experience. When 1
quizzed her on what gave rise to these themes,
she spoke first of moving to London from Ireland
at age five and the "fiery taste of exile" that left
burns and pockmarks. Boland went on to de
scribe her move to New York City. She empha
sized the "unxenophobic" environment she
found, describing America's great strength as its
ability to welcome the dispossessed and frag
mented.
"America was built by outsiders and that is
how it signifies itself." Boland recounted.
In this society of outsiders she found that one
could retain what pieces or wholes remained of
his or her ancestries and origins and still be
American.The "terrible troubles in Ireland from
the I%o's" came from arguing about who was
more Irish, who had more of a right to that word.
Boland said.
Though she found an open port in America's
cities and schools. Boland continued to be at
tached to Ireland. Yet when she returned to Ire
land at age 14, she found that she had not had an
Irish childhood, which caused her to lose the "dic
tionary of Irish signs" needed to be at home in her
home.
Now Boland can "always recognize people
who are out of their own country." she said. She
can see them "struggling with language and loss."
Boland eventually found her way to Stanford,
where she acts both as an English professor and
director of the Creative Writing Program. When I
asked her for any advice she would give to hope
ful poets and authors, she said the "permission to

he a writer is given to oneself." A young writer,
Boland continued, must produce a "fairly high
volume of output" in order to see oneself and
one's weaknesses. She relayed advice she had
once been given.
"Anything worth doing is worth doing badly."
