While the Cardinal wrestlers may not have faced a
powerhouse Friday in San Francisco State, the squad's
trouncing of the Gators nevertheless could prove to be a
valuable building block for a program looking to gain con
ference and national relevancy under head coach Kerry
McCoy — to be the "Best in the West" as he puts it.
Stanford's decisive 37-6 victory over SF State was perhaps
the first time in the past two seasons that the Cardinal not only
controlled a match, but dominated it.
"[The team] definitely can carry that confidence forward, because it's
really the first time since I've been here that we've had that kind of per
formance." McCoy, in his second season at Stanford, said. "We wrestled
SF State last year, and we controlled the pace of the match, but we really
didn't dominate like that. 1 think now that they've had that experience
they can feel like it's possible.That was really important for guys to step
up to the next level and really go out and believe in themselves."
The Cardinal (3-5) won nine of 10 matches against the Gators (1-8). Ju-

nior Tanner Gardner at 125 pounds
and sophomore Luke Feist at 174
pounds each pinned their oppo
nents, and senior Brian Perry at 165
pounds won by technical fall. Per
haps most impressively, in matches
not decided by fall. Stanford's aver
age margin of victory was well over
seven points.
"What I saw was guys wrestling
with confidence, and that's one of
the biggest things that our guys
have to do, no matter who it is we're
competing against," McCoy said. "If

they're wrestling like they did there — going out
and dominating and not worrying about the score
— good things are going to happen. And we'd run
up scores of fifteen or twenty points in some
matches, and that's huge to he able to score that
much."
Of course, given the opponent the Cardinal
were facing, anything less than a complete victory
would have been disappointing. But McCoy
stressed that, if anything, the fact that his team
didn't overlook SF State, which has won just one
match over the past two seasons, was the most
positive aspect of the win.
"It wasn't an awesome performance,it wasn't a
perfect performance, but we just wrestled tough,"
McCoy said." By no means did we take them light
ly, and I think that was a big deal. We have to make
sure we wrestle everyone, no matter who it is, that
way.
McCoy says that the Cardinal's performance
bodes well for the heart of the Cardinal's schedule
coming up next month.
"A win is a win. and to dominate like that is
really good," he said. "But if we can wrestle with
that intensity, and that belief and that fire in Feb
ruary. we're going to do well in the Conference
and at Nationals."
Stanford will next face Cal State-Bakersfield
this Sunday on the road. I"he Roadrunners have
wrestled the Cardinal tough this year, and McCoy
expects a challenge for his squad.
"They've outperformed us in just about

every competition this year, and they've got a
very solid team." McCoy said. "No superstars
per se, but a bunch of solid individuals — and
when you have that it makes the team real
strong. So we're going to have to really go
above and beyond to be competitive with them.
On paper they've been doing a great job, so
we're definitely the underdogs going into this

match, but the goal is still just to get prepared
for the end of the year."
Gardner, though, indicated that more good
things could be on the horizon for a Stanford team
that he believes is just now coming into its own.
"It was nice to finally come out and wrestle to
our potential," Gardner said. "The results showed
just how hard we've been working."
