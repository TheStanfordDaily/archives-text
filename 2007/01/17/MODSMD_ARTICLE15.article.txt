While the Cardinal wrestlers may not have faced a
powerhouse Friday in San Francisco State, the squad's
trouncing of the Gators nevertheless could prove to be a
valuable building block for a program looking to gain con
ference and national relevancy under head coach Kerry

really the first time since I've been here that we've had that kind of per

up to the next level and really go out and believe in themselves."
The Cardinal (3-5) won nine of 10 matches against the Gators (1-8). Ju-

have to do, no matter who it is we're
competing against," McCoy said. "If
