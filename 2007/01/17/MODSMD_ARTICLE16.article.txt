## Weekend cut short by weather, losses Las Vegas conditions, NCTC competition knock Card out 
### JACK SALISBURY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It wasn't just their opponents that the
women's tennis team had to battle last week
end at the Freeman Invitational in Las Vegas.
With temperatures barely above freezing, the
weather conditions were so bad that the team
canceled its remaining matches after the
opening day on Friday.
"We didn't play nearly as much as we

would have liked." coach Lele Forood ex
plained. "The weather just wasn't accommo
dating."
In the limited action in Las Vegas, howev
er, the team excelled. In the singles' portion of
the draw, sophomore Jessica Nguyen, fresh
man Lindsay Burdette and seniors Anne
Yelsey and Theresa Logar all netted victories
in their singles matches.
The Stanford doubles squads of Burdette
and Nguyen and Yelsey and Durkin also had
little trouble with their competition, both win
ning handily against players from Florida and
Oregon, respectively.
But ultimately, the tournament was cut
short due to the cold weather and wind in the
Nevada desert.

"It was a little hit frustrating because we
were all raring and ready to go." Burdette
said. "But it makes the next two weeks of prac
tice that much more important."
While five of the Cardinal were in Las
Vegas for the weekend, the other three (soph
omore Megan Doheny and juniors Celia
Durkin and Lejla I lodzic) were competing at
the National Collegiate Tennis Classic
(NCTC) in Indian Wells, Calif.
Deason had the best run of the three,
reaching the quarterfinals of the tournament
before falling to USC's number one player,
Lindsey Nelson.
The match was hard-fought and went to
three sets. After winning the first set 6-1. Dea
son dropped the second by the same score.
