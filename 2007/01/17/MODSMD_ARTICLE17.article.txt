Freshman Richard Wire came from behind to upset the top seed, and defending national champion, in the first round of last weekend's Sher
wood Cup, but lost in the tournament's second round. Wire and doubles partner Eric McKean were also knocked out in the second round.

Calif., to compete in the individual
tournament against rivals that in
cluded No. 4 UCLA. Southern Cali
fornia. No. 10 Pepperdine and No. 2
Baylor.
"I don't feel like the guys felt
overmatched in the matches they
lost," head coach John Whitlinger
said. "And I feel confident that the
next time they go out there, it could
be a different result. It was a good
tournament to start with. 1 would
have liked to see better results, but
those will come."
The tournament seemed to start
on the right foot for Stanford when
freshman Richard Wire upset top
seeded Benjamin Kohlloeffel of
UCLA.
"I grew in confidence as the
match went on and executed my
game plan really well against him."
Wire said.
The Bruin is the defending
NCAA singles champion and picked
up the first set. 6-2. Wire bounced
back and claimed the second set in a
tiebreaker before winning the third
set, 6-3, and the match.
"It was a great win for Rich and
hopefully a real confidence boost
er." Whitlinger said. "Kohlloeffel is a
guy that doesn't lose too often. He's
so consistent and has been very good
all the years he's been at UCLA.
"Sometimes, when you play a guy
like [Kohlloeffel], you tend to think
you have to do too much, and you
tend to overhit and get too close to
the lines," Whitlinger continued.
"But Rich did a great job of keeping
the ball in play and waiting for op
portunities."
Senior Eric McKean was the only

other Stanford player to win his first
round singles match. Up 3-0 in all
three sets, McKean ultimately
clinched a 5-7, 6-3, 6-1 victory over
Boise State's Stanley Sarapanich.
"Eric is a guy that just competes
so well and if you're going to beat
Eric, you're going to work really
hard," Whitlinger said. "Eric could
have gotten pretty down on himself
[after the first set], but that's not
Eric. He's the kind of guy that's just
never going to give up.
"I've been pleased with what Eric
did in the fall and lie continued that
down in Sherwood." Whitlinger con
tinued. "I expect some good things
from him this year."
McKean was stretched to another
three-setter in his second round
match but couldn't pull off the win.
ITie senior dropped the match 6-1,4-
6, 6-3 to Southern California's Kaes
Van't I lof.
Also falling in the second round,
Wire dropped a 6-3, 6-1 decision to
Pepperdine's Bassam Beidas.
McKean and Wire teamed up for
doubles action on Saturday and
picked up a first round 8-2 win over
a Trojan team before falling 8-3 to
eventual champions Kohlloeffel and
Philipp Gruendler.
"I enjoy playing with Eric," Wire
said. "I think we play really well to
gether and I hope we can form a
good partnership together. He does
certain things well and 1 do some
things well, so we help each other
out."
The team has a short break be
fore it faces Boise State on January
27 in the first home match of the
year.
"We had a lot of good matches
this weekend," Whitlinger said.
"Some just didn't go our way. We're
a young team and we're learning
every time we play, and this was a
good weekend for that."
