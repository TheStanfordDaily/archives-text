The dorm ski trip: a perennial
source of entertainment and
dorm bonding.
This past weekend, I embarked on
Casa Zapata's Lake Tahoe trip with
eager hopes of shredding the slopes
on a snowboard.
One problem: I had never even
seen a snowboard in real life. I had
tried skateboarding in the past, but it
was a bigger failure for me than Pey
ton Manning in the postseason.
What made my snowboarding
dreams even more delusional was
that the MLK. weekend was the first
time 1 had ever even touched actual
snow. Ignoring my friends' advice
that I try skiing instead. 1 ambitiously
purchased the lift ticket and rented
the snowboarding equipment — in
cluding a helmet that 1 decided to
grab at the last second.
Since I'm still saving to purchase a
new Jason Schmidt jersey, 1 passed on
the $75 lesson and thought 1 would
learn through my own mistakes. 1
sailed down the beginner slope twice
with my helmet before realizing that
1 really didn't need the uncomfort
able — and visibly unflattering —
headgear.
1 sailed on my third go-round, this
time feeling the cool Tahoe air sweep
across my scalp and seeing the begin
ners fall face-first into the chilly,
white powder. I had picked up speed
like never before, and for once I felt
as though 1 actually owned some sort
of athletic prowess.
The feeling quickly evaporated as
the back of my board dug into the
snow, hurling my body a few feet in
the air.
l ime stood still for the next three
seconds.
Still completely in the air. I recog
nized my head was angled in the
worst possible way — I would soon
land on the back of my head with no
means of protecting it . At that point. 1
had only two thoughts. One: why did
n't 1 ever talk to that cute girl from


Lomeli
The SoCal Bias
Italian class? Two: this concussion is
going to suck.
I felt the hack of my brain ram
into my skull,and I lay motionless for
the next two minutes, Chough I
couldn't see much. I could hear sev
eral concerned voices asking if I was
okay. I held my thumb up, indicating
I was still alive.
I am extremely lucky the situation
didn t end up worse. 1 took some
Tylenol that evening, and it was as if 1
had never crashed at all.
But I learned my lesson when it
comes to snowboarding. After that
one accident, I never let that helmet
out of my sight. Ilie blow to my head
had left my sense of balance in a state
of disarray for several hours, and I
wasn't about to risk losing something
else -especially not my precious
sense of humor.
It took a serious experience to get
me to wear my helmet while snow
boarding. And as I cruised to class
this morning and saw a few minor bi
cycle near-misses, I started to wonder
just what kind of situation it would
take to get Stanford cyclists to start
wearing helmets.
According to the Insurance Insti
tute for I lighway Safety, bicycle hel
mets can reduce head injury risk by

85 percent. Additionally, one out of
every eight bicycle-related injuries is
a head injury.
Yet, still very few of us choose to
wear a helmet while biking on cam
pus. Not even 1 — a self-proclaimed
advocate of the "better safe than
sorry" mentality — use a helmet.
After all. I don't want to mess up my
hair.
Stanford cyclists have gone to the
emergency room with head injuries
before (though admittedly rarely),
and not even the bike ban in the ar
cades of the main quad will stop this
occurrence.
It is scary to think what kind of se
rious accident must occur before a
large, student initiated push for hel
met use comes into play. Concussions
haven't done it yet. I hate to think it
possible, but perhaps permanent
brain damage to a member of the
Stanford community would be the
only thing that could get us to think
right.
Though it may make me five min
utes late for each of my classes, I'll
walk from class to class in the mean
time. I'veil if it means I get to see that
girl in Italian class for live minutes
less each day.
After all. I want to live long
enough to try skiing on the Stanford
Catholic Community's Tahoe trip
next month.
