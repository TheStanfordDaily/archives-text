The dorm ski trip: a perennial
source of entertainment and
dorm bonding.
This past weekend, I embarked on
Casa Zapata's Lake Tahoe trip with
eager hopes of shredding the slopes
on a snowboard.
One problem: I had never even
seen a snowboard in real life. I had
tried skateboarding in the past, but it
was a bigger failure for me than Pey
ton Manning in the postseason.
What made my snowboarding
dreams even more delusional was
that the MLK. weekend was the first
time 1 had ever even touched actual
snow. Ignoring my friends' advice
that I try skiing instead. 1 ambitiously
purchased the lift ticket and rented
the snowboarding equipment — in
cluding a helmet that 1 decided to
grab at the last second.
Since I'm still saving to purchase a
new Jason Schmidt jersey, 1 passed on
the $75 lesson and thought 1 would
learn through my own mistakes. 1
sailed down the beginner slope twice
with my helmet before realizing that
1 really didn't need the uncomfort
able — and visibly unflattering —
headgear.
1 sailed on my third go-round, this
time feeling the cool Tahoe air sweep
across my scalp and seeing the begin
ners fall face-first into the chilly,
white powder. I had picked up speed
like never before, and for once I felt
as though 1 actually owned some sort
of athletic prowess.
The feeling quickly evaporated as
the back of my board dug into the
snow, hurling my body a few feet in
the air.
l ime stood still for the next three
seconds.
Still completely in the air. I recog
nized my head was angled in the
worst possible way — I would soon
land on the back of my head with no
means of protecting it . At that point. 1
had only two thoughts. One: why did
n't 1 ever talk to that cute girl from


Lomeli
The SoCal Bias
