## Power struggle for the electric car 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One should never underestimate the
power of ordinary individuals to do extraor
dinary things,concluded University of Mary
land Assistant Prof, of Management and En
trepreneurship David kirsch as he addressed
a capacity crowd at Cubherley Auditorium
following last night's free screening of the
documentary "Who Killed the Electric
Car?"
The event, sponsored by the 1 listory and
Philosophy of Science and Technology Pro
gram. featured a panel with filmmaker Chris
Paine. Kirsch, Stanford Cultural and Social
Anthropology Prof. Sarah Lochlann Jain and
electric automobile activist Chelsea Sexton.
Together, the four unraveled the mystery
surrounding the short market lifespan of
General Motors' promising, emissions-free,
electricity-powered automobile (HVI).
Sexton, a star of the film, also discussed
her grassroots effort to resuscitate the elec
tric automobile after the (1M killed the pro
duction of its model. Although automobile
companies resisted her efforts to bring the
electric car back, she continues to serve as a
prominent activist for alternative fuels as di
rector of Plug in America. Kirsch noted her
accomplishments in the field of grassroots
organization and labeled her "the moral cen
ter of future alternative fuels."
"With gas prices going up, now is a good
time to contact your state legislators," Sexton
said. "Now is the perfect time to make your
voice heard on this one."
After noting the car for its innovative, en
vironmentally-friendly technology, she
lamented its death and placed part of the
blame on a power web of politicians, automo

bile companies and the oil tycoons that stu
said were resistant to this needed change.
Prof. Kirsch said that GM - which creat
ed the electric automobile should shoul
der much of the blame for the cars death.
After FVl's birth. CiM dragged its heels
throughout the marketing process, which
prevented the concept from catching fire, he
added.
"In short, this film demonstrates a case
study of how not to get a technology adopt
ed," he said.
The documentary depicts GM spokespeo
ple arguing that they had to discontinue pro
duction of the electric car due to lack of con
sumer demand. But Sexton countered that

this simply isn't true.
"When it comes to any product, you have
to ask: are there enough people who want it
to make a business?" she said. "In this case,
the answer is yes. There were wait lists of
prospective customers who were eager to
purchase the car."
Freshman Joshua Wong said he found the
talk informative, but was turned off by the
emotionality of electric car enthusiasts.
"I liked how the movie provided evi
dence that the idea of a hydrogen car may
only be a smokescreen for protecting the oil
and car industries," Wong said, "lint I dis
liked the cult-like behavior and fanaticism
of electric car proponents. (>ne of the film s

stats even cried when ihe curs were crushed,
and in my mind I thought. It's a car, not a
cure for cancer.""
As the event drew to a close, director
Chris Paine thanked the film's supporters
and described the impact that he believes
that the film has and will continue to make.
"Whatever you do, go out and tell people
what you have learned," Paine said. "Tell
everyone how this knowledge has made a dil
fere nee in your life and in your perspective
on alternative fuels. By getting this message
out there, more people will want to see the
movie, and hopefully more will have the
courage and motivation to try new technolo
gies that can help save our environment."
