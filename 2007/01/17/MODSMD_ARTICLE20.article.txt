### 
What an incredible two
weeks it has been.Three
last second wins in a row
men's basketball had back-to
back thrillers over Washington
and Oregon last year (thanks,
C 'hi is I lernandez).but you have to
go back to the magical 26-0 start to
the 2003-04 season to find this
many close wins in one year. And
who would have thought this
young squad would be able to
compete with that bunch in terms
of drama and late-game poise?
Hie only negative from the
weekend is that the team stepped
off the gas to allow Washington
State to leap back into the game at
the end of regulation on Saturday.
(live the Cougars credit for hitting
two big threes after they'd been
missing all afternoon, but still.
Stanford lost its focus as the
Cougars blew up with a 10-1 run to
send the game into overtime. At
home, down the stretch, how do
you let that happen?
One answer: by dribbling out
too much time at the timeline at
the end of regulation and overtime,
so that there's not enough time to
let a play develop. That Anthony
Goods swished an NBA-length
three pointer falling backwards
with Washington State's best de
fender in his face doesn't change
my point Stanford should have
started attacking earlier.
Surprisingly, after the game,
neither coach Trent Johnson nor
Goods expressed concern about
letting the Cougars nearly steal
away a Stanford win.
"I told them to forget about it."
said Johnson of his words to his
team heading into overtime.
"We're in a position there where
we had some breakdowns defen
sively, but hey. forget about it."
I wonder if he'd be so casual
had the bounces fallen the other
way the past two weeks?
But a win's a win, and after
three straight wins, this program
has to be thinking of going back to
NCAA Tournament after snap
ping its 11-year appearance streak
last year.
Any tiling above .S(H) ball (easi
er said than done in the toughest

Pac-10 in years) should get it done,
so this weekend Stanford just
needs to win at bottom-feeder
Oregon State on Saturday.
Good thing, because theThurs
day game at No. 9 Oregon might be
the toughest one remaining on the
schedule. McArthur Court is the
toughest venue in the conference,
and. more importantly, the Ducks'
roster presents Stanford with all
sorts of matchup problems.
Just like Air Force. Oregon has
a center, Marty Leunen, who's
dangerous with the three (43 per
cent ) Plus, the Ducks start a four,
Malik I lairston. who's faster than
most Pac-10 guards. Either Lopez
twin is too slow to guard Hairston,
so figure i>ll only one on the floor
at a time for much of the game.
And you can bet that Oregon will
draw Leunen out to the three
point arc, forcing Robin or Brook
to guard him 20 feet away from the
hoop, and leaving plenty of room
for their quick guards to penetrate
the lane.
I lie good news is that Oregon
coach Frnie Kent finds ways to
lose games, and Stanford is the
only team in the conference no
current Duck has ever beat — so
maybe that counts for a mental
edge. ()n the court. Stanford's size
will create a mismatch for Oregon,
but players like Goods and
Lawrence Hill need to keep scor
ing at All-Pac-10 levels, and some
one else — Carlton Weatherby.
Mitch Johnson or Taj Finger — is
going to need to have the game of
his life if Stanford is going to make
it interesting.
lie sure to tune into kzsu.Stan
ford. edu or 90.1 FM as we broad
cast both the games from Oregon,
and catch the recaps in the paper
or at stanforddaily.com. Here's
hoping these next few games can
be half as exciting as the last three!
