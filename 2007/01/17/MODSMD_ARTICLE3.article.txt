### MEGAN MAASS 
The Movie Express, which debuted last week, isn't the only
new shuttle service 011 campus.This past Saturday marked the
start of the International Foods Express, a pilot Marguerite
service to Cupertino funded by the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) and operated by Parking & Transportation Services
(P&TS).
The shuttle, which will run from 1:00 p.m. until 6:37 p.m.
every Saturday this quarter, took 24 students to Vallco Fash
ion Park and two supermarkets, Marina Food and Ranch 99
last weekend.

" The maximum capacity
for each trip is 30, so we

were pleased by this
turnout," said

Since October. Li has
been working with the GSC,

P&TS, the Graduate Student Transportation Board, the As
sociation of Chinese Students and Scholars at Stanford and


The Stanford Daily
the city of Cupertino to design the
new route. He got the idea when he
was approached by students without
cars who needed transportation to
Cupertino to run errands.
"The two supermarkets, Ranch
99 and Marina Food, were chosen
because they are the two major su
permarkets close to Stanford with
Chinese and other Asian foods avail
able," Li said. The new shuttle's
route includes the Vallco Fashion
Park so that "people with little inter
est in the food supermarkets can also
take advantage of the service and
thus benefit the whole Stanford
community."
The GSC made an agreement
with P&TS to fund the Express at
the end of fall quarter.

"They are funding the shuttle and
we have agreed to operate it." con
firmed P&TS Charter Services Co
ordinator Karen Moscone. "It is a
charter contract similar to the Movie
Express and Senior Night shuttles."
If the service is successful, the
GSC will try to convince the malls
and markets the Express visits to
provide funding.
Li is also open to expanding shut
tle service to Sundays if turnout is
high, though additional weekday
service is unlikely. On the other
hand, if turnout is low. the service
will not continue into spring quarter.
Still. Li is optimistic.
"We expect more people to take
the shuttle in the next few weeks as
news about this service spreads," he
said."We would like undergraduates
to take advantage of the service,
since many do not own a car.The Ex
press will help save students time
and money, reduce traffic, and im
prove the environment."
