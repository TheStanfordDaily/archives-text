# SILICON VALLEY
## Future entrepreneurs unite Venture Lab bring, business jobs and lessons to undergrads 
### LIA HARDIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford and Silicon Valley's symbiotic relation
ship was on display yesterday when Stanford stu
dents meshed seamlessly with entrepreneurs at the
MIT/Stanford Venture I .ab's "Young Leaders of Sil
icon Valley" event.
Entrepreneurial hopefuls joined five panelists,
venture capitalists, donors and other business people
in the GSB Arbuckle Lounge to network and to ex
change information and ideas about Silicon Valley's
latest and future start-up companies. But although

the speakers and Venture l.ab (VI AM) spokespeo
pie all expressed their desire to meet and poten
tially to hire students, Stanford's undergrads were
conspieuous in their absence.
According to Chiriro Taketomi. who volunteers
on the executive committee of VLAH, the event's or
ganizers wanted to create an innovative foi urn for the
exchange of business ideas. They also wanted to give
students and young entrepreneurs an idea of the
business world that start-up endeavors must under
stand and exploit.
"We specifically wanted to gather young atten
dees to give an idea of what it's like to have experi
ence in the real world."Taketomi said. "It's good to
have people together in a casual setting. They can

bounce ideas off one another."
The event featured five panelists,
all entrepreneurs who have succeeded
in developing start-up companies now
based in Silicon Valley. Garrett Camp
is the unassuming founder of Stumble-
Upon, a company that markets toolbar
features for web browsers. Angus
Davis created the start-up Tellme — a
company that at more than three hun
dred employees is enormous by entre
preneurial standards. Zaw Thet is the
CEO of 4INEO. a company that sends

information like sports scores to cell
phones when prompted by text mes
sages. Omar I lamoui is the CEO of
AdMob. a company that places ads on
"mobile" web networks. Seth Stern
berg is the CEO of Meebo, which he
calls the I lotmail of instant messaging.
Hie discussion was moderated by ven
ture capitalist Ram Shriram. the
founder of Sherpalo Ventures.
Taketomi emphasized that one of
VLAB's major goals was to provide a
forum simultaneously accessible to
both businesses and students that
could communicate the mistakes and
workable solutions of entrepreneurial
success-stories.
"The function is to bring together
entrepreneurs. VCs.GSB students and

undergraduates," she said. "We always
aim to get a lot of students involved."
But although the panelists were
willing and ready to share their experi
ences with students, the event was
geared toward experienced business
veterans who already have a certain
amount of expertise.
Many of the forum's attendees
were full-time business professionals.
Kiran Inampudu of My Ahaa said he
attended the event as a break from his
17 to 18-hour work days.
"1 want to meet like-minded peo
ple," he said.
He was also looking for potential
sponsors for his company.
VLAB is connected to Stanford
mostly through its volunteers, many of

whom are Farm alumni. Although
VLAB claims the GSB's Alumni As
sociation as a sponsor on their Web
site, the relationship is mostly infor
mal. making it difficult for the organi
zation to attract students through reg
ular channels.
Taketomi. who is a GSB alum,
noted that she hoped to get more stu
dents involved in the all-volunteer
VLAB staff.
"We're always looking for new
people to help us with events." she said.
The purpose of creating such a
forum is really two-fold, the panelists
said, described the purpose of creat
ing such a forum is really two-fold,
the panelists said, differing slightly
from Taketomi's assessment. On the

one hand, it is to facilitate an ex
change of ideas. And on the other
hand, it is to assist small companies
through the recruitment process,a re
ality that many find onerous and time
consuming.
"When I was a student," Sternberg
told The Daily. "I had very little idea
how to actually start a business. This is
an opportunity to help."
Hamoui added that the informa
tion exchange goes both ways.
"I've talked to a couple of insightful
GSB students," he said. "I think those
types of interactions are really impor
tant."
"Stanford is one of the most entre
preneurial of the schools out there due
to the setting," Davis added.

The reality of the recruitment and
hiring process was emphasized by all
five speakers during the panel discus
sion. Iliey emphasized the importance
of finding people compatible with a
company's culture who also have the
requisite combination of innovative
smarts and technical skills.
According to the panelists, Stan
ford is an extremely important source
of Silicon Valley's talent,and the GSB
students and few undergraduates
who attended were given a chance to
meet top-level people in companies
in the process of searching for new
employees.
"Meebo is definitely looking to
hire," Sternberg told The Daily with a
smile.
