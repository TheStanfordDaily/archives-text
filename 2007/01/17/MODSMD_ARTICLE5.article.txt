and Dining Enterprises (R&DE) and other I 'niversity offices,
made a collaborative effort to address past grievances over in
sufficient winter break options.
Last year, students complained of having to sleep 011 mat
tresses on the floor of the llammarskjold house lounge, the
only undergraduate house that has consistently offered space
to international students over the break.

fewer students than the number who actually stayed, one inter
national student lamented."|'l"his is | a bleak picture ol winter

time to be sleeping on the floor and eating tuna trom Safeway."
