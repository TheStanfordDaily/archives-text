### NEDRA PICKLER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen.
Barack Obama launched a presi
dential campaign Tuesday that
would make him the first black to
occupy the White House, and im
mediately tried to turn his political
inexperience into an asset with vot
ers seeking change.
Ihe freshman Illinois senator
— and top contender for the De
mocratic nomination — said the
past six years have left the country
in a precarious place and he pro
moted himself as the standard
bearer for a new kind of politics.
"Our leaders in Washington
seem incapable of working together
in a practical, commonsense way,"
Obama said in a video posted on his
Web site."Politics has become so bit
ter and partisan, so gummed up by
money and influence, that we can't
tackle the big problems that demand
solutions. And that's what we have
to change first."
Obama filed paperwork form
ing a presidential exploratory com
mittee that allows him to raise
money and put together a cam
paign structure. He is expected to
announce a full-fledged candidacy
on Feb. 10 in Springfield. lll.,where
he can tout his experience in the

state legislature and tap into the
legacy of hometown hero Abra
ham Lincoln.
In a brief interview on Capitol
Hill. Obama said the reaction has
been positive and added, "we
wouldn't have gone forward this
far if it hadn't been this positive."
Obama's soft-spoken appeal on
the stump, his unique background,
his opposition to the Iraq war and
his fresh face set him apart in a
competitive race that also is ex
pected to include front-runner Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton of New
York.'
Obama has uncommon political
talents, drawing adoring crowds
even among the studious voters in
New Hampshire during a much
hyped visit there last month. His
star has risen on the force of his
personality and message of hope
helped along by celebrity en
dorsements from the likes of
Oprah Winfrey, billionaire investor
Warren Buffett and actors Matt
Damon and Edward Norton.
"I certainly didn't expect to find
myself in this position a year ago,"
said Obama, who added that as he
talked to Americans about a possi
ble presidential campaign, "I've
been struck by how hungry we all
are for a different kind of politics."
The 45-year-old has few ac
complishments on the national
stage after serving little more
than two years in the Senate.
But at a time when many voters
say they are unhappy with the

direction of the country, a lack
of experience in the nation's
capital may not be a liability.
"The decisions that have been
made in Washington these past six
years, and the problems that have
been ignored, have put our country
in a precarious place." Obama said.
I le said people are struggling fi
nancially. dependence on foreign
oil threatens the environment and
national security and "we're still
mired in a tragic and costly war that
should have never been waged."
Clinton is expected to announce
her presidential campaign within
days, but her spokesman said there
would be no comment on Obama's
decision from the Clinton camp.

Back from Iraq, she abruptly can
celed a Capitol Hill news confer
ence minutes after word of
Obama's announcement, citing the
unavailability of a New York con
gressman to participate.
Other Democrats who have an
nounced a campaign or explorato
ry committee are 2004 vice presi
dential nominee John Edwards,
former lowa Gov. Tom Vilsack,
Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd and
Ohio Rep. Dennis kucinich. Sens.
John Kerry of Massachusetts and
Joe Biden of Delaware and New
Mexico (iov. Bill Richardson also
are considering a run.
Obama's decision was relatively
low-key after months of hype, with

no speech or media appearance to
accompany his online announce
ment. 1 le said he will discuss a pres
idential campaign with people
around the country before his Feb.
10 event, and he wasted no time
calling key activists Tuesday.
New Hampshire lobbyist Jim
Demers talked with Obama for
about five minutes. "He is extreme
ly pumped and excited that this
campaign is coming together." said
Demers, who accompanied Obama
on his visit to the state last month.
Obama's quick rise to national
prominence began with his
keynote speech at the 2004 Demo
cratic National Convention and his
election to the Senate that year.
