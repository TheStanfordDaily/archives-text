## Editorial Board Ford Center expansion welcome 
### 
The decision to upgrade the Ford Cen
ter ("Ford expansion approved." Jan.
10) is a positive sign on several fronts.
Hie improvements .ire headlined by the ad
dition oi showering facilities, which were
notably lacking in the brand new Arrillaga
Recreational ( enter built last year. It re
mains unclear win the showers were not in
cluded in the construction of Arrillaga in
the first place, but providing them in the
nearby Ford ( enter is an important adjust
ment.
Some ■students have expressed opinions
that the expansion is unnecessary because
most undergraduates are able to quickly
bike or walk to nearby dorms after using the
gym.and the money could have been better
employed However, many graduate stu
dents, faculty and staff often do not share
the same convenience as undergraduates.
Since recreational 112 acilities, including Arril
laga. are designed for use by all members of
the Stanford community, the expansion will
help increase the usability of the centers for
those who may not want to make multiple
trips on and off campus. It may seem incon
venient that people working out in Arrilla
ga's gymnasiums or weight-room will have
to walk across the courtyard to the Ford
( enter to change or shower, but the walk is
brie 1 and the additional exercise should not

be a major concern to those interested in fit
ness.
I lie expansion also offers improved of
fice space for coaches of the gymnastics and
sailing teams. Iliough neither has the high
est media profile, our streak of Director's
( up victories is largely thanks to "smaller"
sports, and both sailing and gymnastics are
especially deserving this year. I mcry Wager
won the men's national championship in
sailing this fall, and the eighth ranked
women's gymnastics team upset number
five IJ( I A on Monday while the men have
been ranked as high as two in preseason
polls.
Naturally, it is impossible to completely
satisly everyone. Coaches will always want
better conditions for their teams, and the
Stanford population will continue to ask for
more out of the recreational facilities. I low
ever. projects like the upcoming expansion
o! Ford, and the new rock climbing wall in
Arrillaga show a comforting measure of re
sponsiveness by the Athletic Department.
In light of other major improvements like
the new football stadium, it is nice to see
sensitivity to the needs of all Stanford ath
letes. including those who are not on teams.
We can only hope that the willingness to
adapt and improve will continue to extend
into other areas like housing and libraries.
