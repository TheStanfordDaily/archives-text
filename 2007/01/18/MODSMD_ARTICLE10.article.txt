### MAHNCY MEHROTRA 
Stanford boasted a fifth place finish
and several individual awards in last
weekend's Mock Trial tournament at
UCLA.
'Die fifth place win was the best
showing for a Stanford team at the
UCLA invitational. On the individual
level, sophomore Ld Piper won the
Outstanding Attorney award while jun
iors Betsy Walls and Vicky Degtyareva
both won Outstanding Witness awards.
Stanford's Mock Trial program
began about eight years ago when an
undergraduate interested in law found
ed the team.
"We started out as a rookie program,
obviously fielding two teams and not
doing particularly well at nationals,
said President John Fowler, a senior.
"We've improved dramatically in recent years: We placed fifth
in the nation in 2003. and we've won our regional tournament
for the last two years in a row."
Fven alumni are impressed at the progress the team has
made.
"This year 1 have ju>t been blown away by how good they
are," said current coach Frances Lewis. "The program is con
stanth getting better and better each year as the incoming tal
ent raises the bar."
Lewis explained that the level of competition at UCLA this
year was on par with nationals.
Although Mock Trial officially meets twice a week for about
three hours, Lewis confesses that it usually consumes about 10
hours a week, including the time students spend outside of
meetings. After repetitive rehearsing and drilling from the be
ginning of the academic year. Mock Trial members acknowl
edged that the trial begins to take its toll.
"B\ the end of fall quarter, you can get tired of the case and
a little burned out." Walls said. "But as soon as you're wearing
a suit and standing before the judge, you remember why you
pored over affidavits and the rules of evidence for so many
hours."
While the team continues to aspire for more success. Walls
confessed that one of the team's setbacks is going to such an ac
ademically oriented school.
"Because all the program participants have to spend time
doing homework, othei activities and classes, we don't have as
much time as students at other schools do. Walls said. Expen
sive travel costs to tournaments also burden the team.
Hie team's next major competition will be the Pacific
Northwest Regional tournament in February, which will be
held in Portland, Ore.
Fowler believes the team has an extremely promising future.
"In the short run. I expect a great performance at regionals
from all three of our teams, and i hope that we'll be sending out
teams to the national championship in April."
