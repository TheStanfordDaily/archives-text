# PUBLIC SERVICE
## Teens for Technology extends service overseas For every Jamaican school, goal is one computer lab 
### SYED SAYEED 
By sophomore Anders Jones
will have supplied a computer lab to
every Jamaican middle school and high
school.
It has been almost six years since
Jones started Teens for Technology (141)
with the initial goal of bringing comput
ers to one Jamaican school. Since then,
the group has sent nearly 3.(K)() comput
ers to schools, libraries and community
centers on the island. It plans on supply
ing a total ol K).O(K) units in the next two
years to become the largest provider of
computers to schools on the island, ac
cording to the Jamaican Minister of Edu
cation, Youth and Culture Maxine
I lenry-Wilson.
Jones' work on the island is part of a
greater trend of students expanding in
volvement in service overseas. Jon Mc-
Conncll. student development programs
director at the Haas Center, said he has
seen increased numbers of students seek
ing to participate in international service
opportunities.

Student-led projects dealing with in
ternational aid are already numerous
groups like l-'ACE AIDS and the South
east Asian Leadership Network are also
involved in distributing resources
abroad.
The scale of projects like Jones' is
being measured on the level of millions of
dollars. I'ACF AlDS.started by Stanford
students in the summer of 2()05. set itself
the goal of raising $ 1 million by theendof
200 ft, a sum it contributed to the nonprof
it Partners in Health to provide
HIV/AIDS relief in Africa. T4Ts "10k
for JA" campaign will cost around $1.5
million. Jones said. The money forT4T's
work comes from a combination of foun
dations in the U.S. and corporate spon
sorship by companies involved in the re
gion. Pie schools provided about half of
the cost of the computers they will be re
ceiving.
Jones started the group when he was
14 years old after a conversation with a
cab driver while on vacation in Jamaica.
The driver described his son's school,
which had one computer for 850 students.
"It was very spur of the moment,"
Jones said. ITiinking of old computers
that were goinu unused in his basement.

Teens for Technology, the organization founded by sophomore Anders Jones, has supplied approximate
ly 3,000 computers to Jamaican public schools. The group aims for 10,000 total by 2009.
he decided to start a group with
friends from school that would equip
one school with a functional comput
er lab. As he realized the scope of the
problem he was trying to address, the
organization's goals became larger.
"Being teenagers was helpful —
we were naive enough to not psych
ourselves out," Jones said.
ITie group's current project aims
to supply a computer lab to each of
the approximately 750 primary and
high schools in Jamaica. Recently,
Cable & Wireless, one of the leading
Internet service providers in the
Caribbean, agreed to sponsor the

setup of labs in 108 schools between
now and April, by which T4T expects
to have brought its first 350 labs to the
island since launching the campaign.
While Jones and the other
founders of T4T are scattered across
universities in the U.S.,T4T's work on
the ground is ongoing and constant. A
local manager runs daily operations on
the island while Jones, other original
founders and East Coast high school
students focus on fundraising. Jones
travels to the island between six and
eight times a year, visiting schools and
speaking with local and government
officials.
Ihe hurdles to managing projects
like Jones' are numerous. In Jamaica,
political violence has made interna
tional headlines repeatedly over the
last few years. Weather is an issue as
well — rain and flooding over the past

few months have slowed progress on
T4T's current campaign. Jones said In
ternet access in that part of the world
was "prohibitively expensive" forT4T
to bring to the schools through its work
alone. Despite these challenges. 141
group met the last goal they set for
themselves, getting computers to 1(K)
schools on the island by 2004, two
years ahead of schedule.
Student groups like Jones' may ac
tually have an edge in substantial
change at the international level, ac
cording to sophomore Michael Wilk
erson, the 1 laas Center liaison for the
Stanford Association for Internation
al Development, a student group that
seeks to inspire and coordinate ef
forts like 141' and FACE AIDS.
When trying to distribute money
abroad,Wilkerson said,"a lot gets lost
in transit and administration when

you are dealing with big NCiOs.
Smaller groups can make sure that
money and resources are used well."
Jones said that this is not a major
concern with T4T's work. The group
interacts directly with schools, who are
asked to file quarterly status reports
on the programs for their students.
T4T's role in Jamaica is far from over,
Jones said, and he hopes to see change
on a long-term basis.
"Right now there are around
250.(MX) students using computers in
Jamaica," Jones said. "What I am real
ly hoping to see is that 10 years down
the line, when kids are graduating and
entering the work force, they will
have the same level of skills as Amer
ican kids. People say the digital divide
splits one generation from another. 1
see it as splitting the developed world
and the undeveloped world."

schools on the island by 2004, two
years ahead of schedule.
Student groups like Jones' may ac
tually have an edge in substantial
change at the international level, ac
cording to sophomore Michael Wilk
erson, the 1 laas Center liaison for the
Stanford Association for Internation
al Development, a student group that
seeks to inspire and coordinate ef
forts like 141' and FACE AIDS.
When trying to distribute money
abroad,Wilkerson said,"a lot gets lost
in transit and administration when

you are dealing with big NCiOs.
Smaller groups can make sure that
money and resources are used well."
Jones said that this is not a major
concern with T4T's work. The group
interacts directly with schools, who are
asked to file quarterly status reports
on the programs for their students.
T4T's role in Jamaica is far from over,
Jones said, and he hopes to see change
on a long-term basis.
"Right now there are around
250.(MX) students using computers in
Jamaica," Jones said. "What I am real
ly hoping to see is that 10 years down
the line, when kids are graduating and
entering the work force, they will
have the same level of skills as Amer
ican kids. People say the digital divide
splits one generation from another. 1
see it as splitting the developed world
and the undeveloped world."
