## Teens for Technology extends service overseas For every Jamaican school, goal is one computer lab 
### SYED SAYEED 
By sophomore Anders Jones
will have supplied a computer lab to
every Jamaican middle school and high
school.
It has been almost six years since
Jones started Teens for Technology (141)
with the initial goal of bringing comput
ers to one Jamaican school. Since then,
the group has sent nearly 3.(K)() comput
ers to schools, libraries and community
centers on the island. It plans on supply
ing a total ol K).O(K) units in the next two
years to become the largest provider of
computers to schools on the island, ac
cording to the Jamaican Minister of Edu
cation, Youth and Culture Maxine
I lenry-Wilson.
Jones' work on the island is part of a
greater trend of students expanding in
volvement in service overseas. Jon Mc-
Conncll. student development programs
director at the Haas Center, said he has
seen increased numbers of students seek
ing to participate in international service
opportunities.

Student-led projects dealing with in
ternational aid are already numerous
groups like l-'ACE AIDS and the South
east Asian Leadership Network are also
involved in distributing resources
abroad.
The scale of projects like Jones' is
being measured on the level of millions of
dollars. I'ACF AlDS.started by Stanford
students in the summer of 2()05. set itself
the goal of raising $ 1 million by theendof
200 ft, a sum it contributed to the nonprof
it Partners in Health to provide
HIV/AIDS relief in Africa. T4Ts "10k
for JA" campaign will cost around $1.5
million. Jones said. The money forT4T's
work comes from a combination of foun
dations in the U.S. and corporate spon
sorship by companies involved in the re
gion. Pie schools provided about half of
the cost of the computers they will be re
ceiving.
Jones started the group when he was
14 years old after a conversation with a
cab driver while on vacation in Jamaica.
The driver described his son's school,
which had one computer for 850 students.
"It was very spur of the moment,"
Jones said. ITiinking of old computers
that were goinu unused in his basement.
