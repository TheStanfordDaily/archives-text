## Editorial Board Scheduling sections can reduce chaos 
### 
Alter almost two weeks of classes, the
chaos that is the shopping period
has probably subsided, and most
students should have decided on their class
schedule. Choosing classes from the wide
array of options available can be tricky, but
the process is made much trickier by the ex
istence of discussion sections. Many stu
dents don't know if sections are offered,
when they are offered and whether they are
mandatory or optional.
Discussion sections provide valuable op
portunities for students to engage with
course materials in a setting that is more
personal and less intimidating, frying to lit
them into a packed class schedule, however,
can be a difficult experience.
Professors and teaching assistants spend
too much time on the lirst day of class at
tempting to set up times for discussion sec
tions. Teachers and students engage in a
painful iterative process to find a time that
works for everyone. It often turns out that
the only time everyone can agree on is ei
ther very early or very late in the day. In the
weeks that follow, a deluge of emails are
sent back and forth, as teaching assistants
try to confirm times and classrooms.
This process is both tedious and inetti
cient. Moreover, negligence toward section
scheduling often leaves students with the
impression that sections are irrelevant or
unimportant.
Worse yet. there are times when we
don't even know whether a class has an as
sociated discussion section. Students gener
ally expect large introductory level classes
taught in large lecture halls to have an ac
companying discussion section. But we are
sometimes surprised to discover that small
er seminars also have discussion sections
supervised by a teaching assistant. Students
occasionally drop a class on the first day be
cause they are unable or unwilling to attend
an additional section.
Fortunately, all these problems can be
easily remedied if professors and adminis
trators reflect all section times in the Time
Schedule. While a fair majority of profes
sors have already taken steps along these
lines, there are still many stragglers.
The section times listed could later be
changed if too many students have conflicts.

hut students could at least tentatively plan
their schedule around the section before
coming to the first lecture. A good idea tor
scheduling sections would be to have them
during regularly scheduled class time. For
example, in a Monday/Wednesday/I riday
class, a professor could have lectures on
Mondays and Wednesdays, while a teaching
assistant could hold discussion sections on
Fridays.
This pattern is already used in larger in
troductory courses, and can be successfully
employed even in smaller classes.The trick
is to integrate section into the standardized
class times designated by the Registrar
(available online at http://registrar.stan
ford.edu/faculty/scheduling/class_time_std
.htm).This way, students can easily plan to
attend section regularly
Additional hours spent in section should
be reflected in official documents, so that
they can be included in unit count consider
ations. For example, if a professor schedules
an additional one-hour section, he or she
should consider offering the class for an ad
ditional unit.
Some professors take discussion sec
tions very seriously, while others view them
as bridging the gap between formal lectures
and informal office hours. These expecta
tions— along with all scheduling informa
tion— should be made available well be
fore the start of the quarter on both Course
work and the Stanford Syllabus Web site
("The joy of a syllabus," Jan. 11). If partici
pation in section counts for any part of the
final grade, professors should make some
effort to schedule them officially in the
Time Schedule.
When sections are better integrated into
class schedules, professors will be encour
aged to integrate sections with regular lec
tures. Besides carefully scheduling sections
ahead of time, professors should work to
ward making section more relevant instead
of letting teaching assistants have free reign
over the content of their sections.
Amid the rush of the quarter system,
professors have an interest in getting sec
tions up and running efficiently. Discussion
sections should not be an afterthought, es
pecially it professors believe that these sec
tions play an important pedagogical role.
