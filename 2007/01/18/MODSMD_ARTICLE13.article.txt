# The 						surreal life: Stanford
## 
### 
Last night, writing a story for The Daily.
1 found myself in the enviable posi
tion of asking brilliant poet Eavan
Boland if 1 could interview staggeringly
debonair novelist lan McEwan.To translate
from lit geek, this was the equivalent of ca
sually swaggering up to David Bowie to ask
for an introduction to his friend Bob Dylan.
Or at the very least, knocking over Stephen
Baldwin to get your hands on Alec.
I approached Eavan. dancing from foot
to foot, vigorously but surreptitiously (I
hoped) rubbing my clammy palms against
my jeans, mouthing lines of Eavan s '"It's A
Woman's World." My throat seemed to
clear itself and as she turned around, I
opened my mouth and — ducked behind a
blue-haired old granny in the aisle. I could
n't do it.
What to you may seem like cowardice
was. on closer examination, the only course
of action. My history with celebrity is a long
one. 1 have on occasion flown too close to
the stars, and that almost-encounter with an
Irish poet reminded me of the burn.
My first significant celebrity encounter
occurred at the tender age of 12, when I ran
into John Cusack in a frozen yogurt empori-

um just outside of Malibu. (Chocolate fro
yo. white chocolate chips and rainbow sprin
kles — I call it a "I ligh Fro-delity Sundae.")
For weeks I cursed myself for not getting an
autograph, and dreamed that by some mira
cle he would show up under my window,
thrusting a boom box blaring cheesy "80s
power ballads up toward the heavens and
my awkward adolescent heart.
I le did not.
A year later. I believe I personally
caused the devastating Meg Rvan/Dennis
Quaid divorce of '99 when I ran into the
then-happy pair at a hamburger joint in LA.
In the process of shoving an almost-clean
napkin under Meg's nose for an autograph.


Lewin
Out and Aboutski
I knocked Dennis's burger on the
ground. Hie proprietor would not
give him a refund. Am I to blame?
Ilie peak of nn stalkerazzi career
came senior year of high school. At
Las Vegas' Annual Rib I est. Vanilla
Ice himself was playing a concert —
free admission with purchase of two
barbecued beef ribs. Admittedly, I
didn't know the lyrics to the embar
rassing gangsta rap segment of his
set. hut nobody was screaming "Too
cold, too cold!" louder than I.
After he belted out the last note. I
sneaked past security and climbed
over two fences and some sound
equipment — in heels, no less! — to
tell him personally that I am a fan.
1 le looked surprised. To my elation,
he not only signed my arm, but
kissed me on the cheek and gave me
the can of Red Bull he was about to
open. I 'm not saying I licked the can
after he handed it over, but I'm not
saying I didn't.
Two weeks later, at a different
concert. MC Hammer kissed that
same cheek. Sir Mix-A-Lot was also
at the venue, hut even I have stan
dards.
Sadly, at Stanford, my love for
celebrity sightings has taken a bit ol
a downturn. I'll admit, freshman
year I purchased some sketchy tome
entitled "Presupposition and Asser
tion in Dynamic Semantics" and
asked my linguistics professor to
sign it. but between you and me. that
had more to do with my crush on him
than my knowing what the heck dy
namic semantics are supposed to be.
But on balance, as a Russian lit
major. I have come to terms with the
inexorable fact of intellectual
celebrity: Most of the truly cool
dudes are dead.
Instead of letting this stop me.
though. I've taken my own route. If
there aren't celebrities. I'll make my
own. I packed away my autograph
book, left the signatures of Gloria
Gaynor, Meat I .oaf and the guy who
played the waiter on "Saved by the
Bell" to rot in their own elite obscu
rity. Now I am consumed with the
exact opposite of autographs: Fan
Mail.
Fan mail. Something of so little
worth,you don't even keep it. In the
digital age, where email addresses
are available to anyone with Gooi>le.

halt an hour and no shame, you can
write fan mail to anybody. And I do.
Sophomore year, after an epic
hutting of heads. I finally reached
synthesis with a hard-ass writing
teacher during finals week. In grati
tude. I wrote a lengthy letter praising
the improvement he had chiseled in
my style. Two quarters later, he re
turned to my life in the guise of a uni
versally despised TA in a class on a
different subject. One lecture, as
nine college students glared at him
with all the disdain they could
dredge, he told everyone. "You can
hate me as much as you want, hut I
will teach you how to write. I taught
kat here how to write. She sent me
fan mail."
I felt like a smoker in a California
restaurant.
My personal favorite recipient of
fan mail, though, is always the elu
sive Daily columnist. Last year I
took a shine to an overseas column
from Berlin, written by a guy we'll
call I lav id Herbert, illuminating the
city with the perfect mixture of psy
chological reality and cynical wit.
After a good five minutes' labor. I
composed the following:
"Awkward random email?: Were
Ilie Daily a mid-9()s television line
up. your column would he Legends
of the Hidden Temple.' But.y'know.
with German rugby players instead
of Temple Guards."
How was I supposed to know he
was the only kid in America who did
n't have cable? Months later. 1 hap
pened to meet him. He introduced
himself and I immediately blurted
out:"l know who you are! i sent you
fan mail."
Iliis obsession with celebrity —
meeting them, ruining their mar
riages. manufacturing their
verisimilitudes in the humdrum
patches of my daily life — is ludi
crous and not infrequently embar
rassing. but something in me can't
stop. Honestly, it's nice to pretend
that there exist in the world people
so great that even revealing to them
the depths of your admiration in
way makes you more special.
After all. it's nice to imagine some
one might feel the same about us.
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got
to go write a gushing email to my ed
itor. I'm a huge fan of her work.

Vicky, you are the Pete to my Pete, ex
cept instead of adventures, we have
goddamn journalism. Love, your
biggest fan, ktit (who can he reached

halt an hour and no shame, you can
write fan mail to anybody. And I do.
Sophomore year, after an epic
hutting of heads. I finally reached
synthesis with a hard-ass writing
teacher during finals week. In grati
tude. I wrote a lengthy letter praising
the improvement he had chiseled in
my style. Two quarters later, he re
turned to my life in the guise of a uni
versally despised TA in a class on a
different subject. One lecture, as
nine college students glared at him
with all the disdain they could
dredge, he told everyone. "You can
hate me as much as you want, hut I
will teach you how to write. I taught
kat here how to write. She sent me
fan mail."
I felt like a smoker in a California
restaurant.
My personal favorite recipient of
fan mail, though, is always the elu
sive Daily columnist. Last year I
took a shine to an overseas column
from Berlin, written by a guy we'll
call I lav id Herbert, illuminating the
city with the perfect mixture of psy
chological reality and cynical wit.
After a good five minutes' labor. I
composed the following:
"Awkward random email?: Were
Ilie Daily a mid-9()s television line
up. your column would he Legends
of the Hidden Temple.' But.y'know.
with German rugby players instead
of Temple Guards."
How was I supposed to know he
was the only kid in America who did
n't have cable? Months later. 1 hap
pened to meet him. He introduced
himself and I immediately blurted
out:"l know who you are! i sent you
fan mail."
Iliis obsession with celebrity —
meeting them, ruining their mar
riages. manufacturing their
verisimilitudes in the humdrum
patches of my daily life — is ludi
crous and not infrequently embar
rassing. but something in me can't
stop. Honestly, it's nice to pretend
that there exist in the world people
so great that even revealing to them
the depths of your admiration in
way makes you more special.
After all. it's nice to imagine some
one might feel the same about us.
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got
to go write a gushing email to my ed
itor. I'm a huge fan of her work.

Vicky, you are the Pete to my Pete, ex
cept instead of adventures, we have
goddamn journalism. Love, your
biggest fan, ktit (who can he reached

Last night, writing a story for The Daily.
1 found myself in the enviable posi
tion of asking brilliant poet Eavan
Boland if 1 could interview staggeringly
debonair novelist lan McEwan.To translate
from lit geek, this was the equivalent of ca
sually swaggering up to David Bowie to ask
for an introduction to his friend Bob Dylan.
Or at the very least, knocking over Stephen
Baldwin to get your hands on Alec.
I approached Eavan. dancing from foot
to foot, vigorously but surreptitiously (I
hoped) rubbing my clammy palms against
my jeans, mouthing lines of Eavan s '"It's A
Woman's World." My throat seemed to
clear itself and as she turned around, I
opened my mouth and — ducked behind a
blue-haired old granny in the aisle. I could
n't do it.
What to you may seem like cowardice
was. on closer examination, the only course
of action. My history with celebrity is a long
one. 1 have on occasion flown too close to
the stars, and that almost-encounter with an
Irish poet reminded me of the burn.
My first significant celebrity encounter
occurred at the tender age of 12, when I ran
into John Cusack in a frozen yogurt empori-

um just outside of Malibu. (Chocolate fro
yo. white chocolate chips and rainbow sprin
kles — I call it a "I ligh Fro-delity Sundae.")
For weeks I cursed myself for not getting an
autograph, and dreamed that by some mira
cle he would show up under my window,
thrusting a boom box blaring cheesy "80s
power ballads up toward the heavens and
my awkward adolescent heart.
I le did not.
A year later. I believe I personally
caused the devastating Meg Rvan/Dennis
Quaid divorce of '99 when I ran into the
then-happy pair at a hamburger joint in LA.
In the process of shoving an almost-clean
napkin under Meg's nose for an autograph.

Out and Aboutski
I knocked Dennis's burger on the
ground. Hie proprietor would not
give him a refund. Am I to blame?
Ilie peak of nn stalkerazzi career
came senior year of high school. At
Las Vegas' Annual Rib I est. Vanilla
Ice himself was playing a concert —
free admission with purchase of two
barbecued beef ribs. Admittedly, I
didn't know the lyrics to the embar
rassing gangsta rap segment of his
set. hut nobody was screaming "Too
cold, too cold!" louder than I.
After he belted out the last note. I
sneaked past security and climbed
over two fences and some sound
equipment — in heels, no less! — to
tell him personally that I am a fan.
1 le looked surprised. To my elation,
he not only signed my arm, but
kissed me on the cheek and gave me
the can of Red Bull he was about to
open. I 'm not saying I licked the can
after he handed it over, but I'm not
saying I didn't.
Two weeks later, at a different
concert. MC Hammer kissed that
same cheek. Sir Mix-A-Lot was also
at the venue, hut even I have stan
dards.
Sadly, at Stanford, my love for
celebrity sightings has taken a bit ol
a downturn. I'll admit, freshman
year I purchased some sketchy tome
entitled "Presupposition and Asser
tion in Dynamic Semantics" and
asked my linguistics professor to
sign it. but between you and me. that
had more to do with my crush on him
than my knowing what the heck dy
namic semantics are supposed to be.
But on balance, as a Russian lit
major. I have come to terms with the
inexorable fact of intellectual
celebrity: Most of the truly cool
dudes are dead.
Instead of letting this stop me.
though. I've taken my own route. If
there aren't celebrities. I'll make my
own. I packed away my autograph
book, left the signatures of Gloria
Gaynor, Meat I .oaf and the guy who
played the waiter on "Saved by the
Bell" to rot in their own elite obscu
rity. Now I am consumed with the
exact opposite of autographs: Fan
Mail.
Fan mail. Something of so little
worth,you don't even keep it. In the
digital age, where email addresses
are available to anyone with Gooi>le.
