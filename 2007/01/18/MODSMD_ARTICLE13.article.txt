Last night, writing a story for The Daily.
1 found myself in the enviable posi
tion of asking brilliant poet Eavan
Boland if 1 could interview staggeringly
debonair novelist lan McEwan.To translate
from lit geek, this was the equivalent of ca
sually swaggering up to David Bowie to ask
for an introduction to his friend Bob Dylan.
Or at the very least, knocking over Stephen
Baldwin to get your hands on Alec.
I approached Eavan. dancing from foot
to foot, vigorously but surreptitiously (I
hoped) rubbing my clammy palms against
my jeans, mouthing lines of Eavan s '"It's A
Woman's World." My throat seemed to
clear itself and as she turned around, I
opened my mouth and — ducked behind a
blue-haired old granny in the aisle. I could
n't do it.
What to you may seem like cowardice
was. on closer examination, the only course
of action. My history with celebrity is a long
one. 1 have on occasion flown too close to
the stars, and that almost-encounter with an
Irish poet reminded me of the burn.
My first significant celebrity encounter
occurred at the tender age of 12, when I ran
into John Cusack in a frozen yogurt empori-

um just outside of Malibu. (Chocolate fro
yo. white chocolate chips and rainbow sprin
kles — I call it a "I ligh Fro-delity Sundae.")
For weeks I cursed myself for not getting an
autograph, and dreamed that by some mira
cle he would show up under my window,
thrusting a boom box blaring cheesy "80s
power ballads up toward the heavens and
my awkward adolescent heart.
I le did not.
A year later. I believe I personally
caused the devastating Meg Rvan/Dennis
Quaid divorce of '99 when I ran into the
then-happy pair at a hamburger joint in LA.
In the process of shoving an almost-clean
napkin under Meg's nose for an autograph.
