(German) Wie heisst du?
(English) Wluit 's your name?
I love the fact that there is a special form
to ask someone their name it you are on
close friendly terms with that person; it's
one of the first things presented in my
"key German phrases" leaflet. It's not that
amazing— it's just using a different pro
noun and form of the main verb, which can
he done with most verbs in German (if
you've studied French or Spanish, it's the
same kind of distinction as between
"vous" or "usted" and "tu"). But really,
how often do you ask a friend or family
member what their name is?
On the other hand. I probably could
have used such a construction this week. I
just switched rooms at the beginning of
this quarter and acquired new roommates
in the process. I found out where I was
moving and with whom I would he room
ing mid-afternoon on Monday. By Tues
day, it seemed that somehow half of cam

pus knew my new living situation. I ran
into no less than four people (all casual ac
quaintances) who. upon seeing me, began
to exclaim with delight that they had heard
I was rooming with Katherine and Char
lotte.
All well and good, 1 suppose —
that's what happens when you're at a
school with only 6.000 undergrads,
right? Somehow everyone knows you,
as well as anyone else you might meet,
after less than a year and a half. So I

shouldn't have been so surprised
that so many people I would run
into would already know the de
tails of my new rooming situa
tion. (Whether or not it's also
improved could be argued about
until the sun goes down. Though
plenty of people have already
tried to get me to state an opin
ion one way or the other, 1 just
like leaving it at some infuriating
small detail like, "Well, the
floor's cleaner." That frustrates
most people for some reason.)
1 was really weirded out when
someone whose name I had even
forgotten was excited about my
new roommates. I mean, I felt bad
about forgetting his name, of
course, because he remembered
me clearly enough not only to rec
ognize me, but to know that 1 was
rooming with two other friends of
his. This was definitely a context in
which being able to ask someone
his name in a friendly-seeming way
would have been very useful.
On the other hand, sometimes a
blatant,"! ley, I don't actually know
you very well — what's your name
again?" can be very useful when
someone's coming on a bit too
strong. Everyone's had that hap
pen to them once or twice — you
know, out on the dance floor, after
dancing for approximately two
minutes he tries to kiss you and in
that moment you get the lull force
of his alcohol-breath. 'Unit's the
perfect time to drop a "So. what's
your name?" where it's very un
likely the formal form would make
enough sense, and the friendly
form wouldn't have quite the same
effect.
In general, though, I think it
would make college life so much
easier to have separate forms for
"friendly intent" and "formal, dis
tancing intent" in introductive
techniques. Heck, it could be used
to make the whole fumbling initial
flirtation period that much easier
overall. An interesting guy's smil
ing at you, you ask his name in a
very friendly manner; sketchy guy
doing the same, you drop the blunt,
"By the way, 1 have never met you
before." Oh, wait, we do that any
way. Silly nonverbal cuing.
Not to mention it's much easier
to attempt to recover from a non
verbal statement than a verbal one
flirting is only supposed to be
subtle hinting one way or the other.
And 1 have enough problems try
ing to figure out what to call people
anyway, with adults and professors
frequently asking to be called bv
their first name. If I had to try to
figure that out with everyone, and
not be able to skirt the issue by just
using pronouns and not referring
to them by name. 1 would probably
go insane.
On the other hand, if 1 don't
know someone's name at all. trying
to figure out what name to call her
is somewhat irrelevant.

Kate doesn't know your name, hut
feels silly asking. Tell her what to call
vou at kltang@stanford.edu.
