(English) Wluit 's your name?
I love the fact that there is a special form
to ask someone their name it you are on
close friendly terms with that person; it's

he done with most verbs in German (if
you've studied French or Spanish, it's the
same kind of distinction as between
"vous" or "usted" and "tu"). But really,
how often do you ask a friend or family
member what their name is?

day, it seemed that somehow half of cam

pus knew my new living situation. I ran
into no less than four people (all casual ac
quaintances) who. upon seeing me, began
to exclaim with delight that they had heard
I was rooming with Katherine and Char
lotte.
All well and good, 1 suppose —
that's what happens when you're at a
school with only 6.000 undergrads,
right? Somehow everyone knows you,
as well as anyone else you might meet,
after less than a year and a half. So I
