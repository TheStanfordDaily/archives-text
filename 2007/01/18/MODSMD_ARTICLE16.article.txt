1n 2005.16-year old Tashnuba I layder was
given a one-way ticket to Bangladesh,
courtesy of the United States govern
ment. At the age of five. I layder had emigrat
ed from Bangladesh with her parents. I laving
grown up in New York City. Hayder is unfa
miliar with the culture and language of
Bangladesh. I lowever. as a non-citizen of the
United States, she can be easily forced to re
turn to a country she doesn't know.
Question: What'd she do to deserve such a
fate?
Answer: She wrote an essay about suicide
bombing for a school assignment.
What Hayder did not realize was that the
rights of non-citizens can be easily violated. In
theory, she was covered by the first amend
ment It) the United States Constitution.guar
anteeing freedom of speech. In practice, many
non-citizens have few ways of defending
those rights.
I was lucky enough to have been born in
the United States. Mv older brother was born

in Calcutta, having moved to the United
States when he was four years old. I le became
a US. Citizen when he was 18. II my brother
had written about religion, about suicide
bombing or about the U.S. government,
would he have been sent to India, like a pack
aye stamped in bold block letters"RE TURN
TO SENDER "?
And yet, how many of us know about these
issues? Iliere are almost two million South
Asian Americans living in the United States,
making up about one percent of its popula
tion. This group, of which I am a part, has re

mained silent or been rendered silent (with
notable exceptions) while such atrocities
have occurred. This is not only a product of
the current administration, against which I
write strongly knowing (or at least hoping)
that I will not be deported, as 1 was born a U.S.
citizen.
What else is making us silent? South Asian
Americans, like other so-called model mi
norities. largely want to maintain our middle
class respectability. As model minorities, we
will not rock the boat. We rise on the ladder of
respectability in the United States because
we do not challenge the forms of oppression
that occur here on an daily basis. If it doesn t
affect us, we don't care.
And why do we think that we won't be
next? That if we hold onto our model minori
ty status, living with our model families in our
model houses, driving our model cars, pur
chased with money from our model jobs, we

won't be harmed? Should we really
wait until we find out — too late -
that our models are made of match
sticks? We can endure overeager au
tomatons with outfits emblazoned
with the ominous title "HOME
LAND SECURITY" frisking our
bodies and rummaging through our
suitcases. Can we endure shootings,
beatings and deportations? Contrary
to a certain conservative consensus,
immigrants of color will not gain the
privileges of full citizenship by mere

ly assimilating to a norm not of our
own making — wo are marked by
our skin and by our histories.
It is difficult to negotiate with eld
ers, especially parents, who seem to
own culture. For those of us born in
the United States, we are afraid to
challenge parents and grandparents
because they seem to know more
about what it is to be "traditional"
than we do. South Asia has a long and
heterogeneous history, as do South
Asians in America. We needn't be
told what it means to be South Asian
or American — we decide what it
means in our every action. Appeas
ing our parents and appeasing a
racist system will never result in full
citizenship. It is time to fashion for

ourselves a new set of traditions out
of old materials, traditions that we
can live with.
We need to reclaim these lost his
tories, and forge coalition politics
that challenge both immigrant and
non-immigrant communities to fight
for immigration rights. We need to
choose a culture of rights and politics
of solidarity. It we do not make this
choice, we might discover all too
quickly how flimsy models can be.
