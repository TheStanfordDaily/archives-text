1n 2005.16-year old Tashnuba I layder was
given a one-way ticket to Bangladesh,
courtesy of the United States govern
ment. At the age of five. I layder had emigrat
ed from Bangladesh with her parents. I laving
grown up in New York City. Hayder is unfa
miliar with the culture and language of
Bangladesh. I lowever. as a non-citizen of the
United States, she can be easily forced to re
turn to a country she doesn't know.
Question: What'd she do to deserve such a
fate?
Answer: She wrote an essay about suicide
bombing for a school assignment.
What Hayder did not realize was that the
rights of non-citizens can be easily violated. In
