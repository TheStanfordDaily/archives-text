# Letters to the Editor
## Stanford resources to help survivors of sexual violence 
### 
A recent Daily editorial ("Sexual Assault
at Stanford," Jan. 10) raises important issues
about campus services dedicated to helping
survivors of sexual violence. On behalf of the
Sexual Violence Advisory Board (SVAB).
which is a joint effort between students and
administrators, we would like to clarify a few
points.
SVAB was tasked by Vice Provost Greg
Boardman to examine and strengthen Stan
ford's response to sexual violence on campus
in 2005. We will launch a comprehensive new
Web site in February: http://www.stanford.
edu/group/svab/.
As noted in the editorial, acquaintance
rape, although underreported, does happen
at Stanford.The issues surrounding rape are
far from easy and the medical collection
exams mentioned by the editorial are one ex
ample. Medical Evidence Collection exams
are centralized by the county in order to im
prove the quality of evidence collected and
thereby increase the likelihood of successful
prosecution of perpetrators.This is a goal we
enthusiastically endorse. We recognize that a
15-minute drive to Valley Medical Center
can be troubling to a survivor who is already
in great distress, but she or he can be accom
panied and transported by friends, family
and/or residential staff members.
We would like to clarify the issues raised by
the editorial related to campus resources. For

more than a decade, many campus offices pro
vided victim assistance.The YWCA Sexual As
sault Center at Stanford opened its doors in
2005. The Center, located in a private office in
Vaden Health Center, is a partnership between
the University and the YWCA Rape Crisis
Center of Santa Clara County. Professional ad
vocates maintain strict confidentiality and hold
office hours, Monday through Thursday, 2 to 4
p.m. or by appointment. Ihe advocates empow
er survivors to make informed decisions, pro
vide campus and community resources for sup
port and healing and can assist survivors in
preparing for prosecution or a disciplinary
hearing. This is a complex and demanding
process. We wholeheartedly endorse the edito
rial's recommendation that the campus be
come familiar with the Center at Stanford,drop
in to meet the staff and develop confidence in
the partnership that has become a national
model for other campuses.
In addition to the Sexual Assault Center
office, our campus now has access to a dedi
cated Stanford number, (650)725-9955,
which links to the YWCA 24/7 hotline,
staffed by highly trained volunteers who re
spond to emergency situations. ITiey also
provide information about how to help a
friend, prevention efforts, relationship abuse
referrals and other resources.
The University takes the issue of sexual vio
lence and relationship abuse very seriously In
December 2006,The Daily published an article
"Stanford Wins Grant" announcing that Stan
ford's Community Partnership to F.nd Vio

lence Against Women was awarded a $220,000
grant from the U.S. Department of Justice's Of
fice for Violence Against Women. This grant
will result in paid internships for male and fe
male students to offer sexual violence and rela
tionship abuse education and prevention. It
should be apparent that both the administra
tion and the students dedicate a great deal of
thought and effort to ending campus sexual vi
olence and relationship abuse.
Finally, this is our message to any survivor:
You Jo not need to bear it alone. Seek help
from friends and others whom you trust and
respect. Use the services at Stanford s
YWCA Sexual Assault Center. Have confi
dence that your privacy, well-being and au
tonomy are our highest concern.
In closing,we would like to thank the writ
ers for raising awareness about this issue, lo
anyone interested in becoming involved,
please email us at perto@stanford.edu or
lbeeson@stanford.edu.

Sexual Assault at Stanford
The Jan. 10 editorial ("Sexual As
sault at Stanford") represents irre
sponsible and potentially harmful
journalism. The editorial's incorrect
and poorly researched assertion that
Stanford Emergency Department
provides inadequate medical servic
es for survivors of sexual assault is
not only false but also detrimental to
any person who may be a future vic
tim of sexual assault. For the benefit
of our students and the Stanford
community, we would like to provide
facts regarding the serious issue of
emergency evaluation of victims of
sexual assault at Stanford Emer
gency Department.
Any person presenting to Stan
ford's Emergency Department with
any type of complaint (regardless of
age, sex, race or ability to pay) is reg
istered as a patient and receives a
comprehensive medical screening
exam. Any patient presenting to the
Emergency Department with a com
plaint of "sexual assault" is made a
priority "one" (immediate attention
needed). A victim of sexual assault is
never told to wait and then placed in
the back of a police unit as incorrect
ly suggested by the Editorial Board.
We escort such patients to a private
examination room for immediate
evaluation by the Emergency De
partment staff (including the hospi
tal's social worker). We make every
effort to remain with the victim at ail
times to support their emotional and
medical needs.
Once the patient is deemed safe
and the Emergency Department
evaluation is complete, the police are
also notified as mandated by law.
With the patient's permission, they
are then transferred to the designat
ed sexual assault center of San
Mateo or Santa Clara County for a
comprehensive forensic medical
exam. Ihough Stanford Emergency
Department nurses have been
trained to disrobe sexual assault pa
tients in a way to collect any possible
piece of evidence, the nurses and
physicians do not conduct the actual
forensic medical examination for
good reason. A sexual assault exam
is not a "basic" service as written in
The Daily;and PERK (Physical Evi
dence Recovery Kit) is the name of

the evidence collection kit, not the
sexual assault exam.The actual exam
is a forensic medical and evidentiary
exam conducted by specialized pro
fessionals who are part of SART
(Sexual Assault Response Team).
Forensic sexual assault exams are
medical-legal examinations requir
ing specialized training and a team
approach. There is collaboration be
tween the medical, legal and judicial
systems to facilitate effective investi
gation and proper prosecution. The
editorial incorrectly states that there
is a 72 hour window in which to com
plete an exam. The forensic exami
nation produces DNA evidence for
10 days.
Both San Mateo County and
Santa Clara County have deemed it
necessary to designate a single sex
ual assault center for each county.
The Santa Clara County SART pro
gram is based at Valley Medical
Center (VMC) in San Jose. This
program sees patients from all 14
police jurisdictions of Santa Clara
County, including Stanford, l.os
Altos and Palo Alto. This Program
has been in continuous operation
since The forensic nurse ex
aminers are on call 24/7 for sexual
assault patients brought to VMC by
the police or arriving of their own
accord.The team consists of 16 very
well trained, clinically experienced
registered nurses, whose competen
cy and expertise are maintained
though the number of victims they
treat as well as ongoing specialized
training and recurring task-force
meetings. The forensic nurse exam
iners perform approximately 30
exams per month. Each exam takes
approximately 3-4 hours, during
which time the patient is inter
viewed and examined for medical as
well as forensic purposes, evidence
is collected, medication adminis
tered and emotional support pro
vided.The SART forensic nurse ex
aminers are court-qualified, expert
witnesses trained as to how to pro
vide effective testimony in sexual
assault cases.
Hie experienced SART members
at VMC understand the important
role they play in the care and evalua
tion of sexual assault victims. They
make every effort to provide a sup
portive, private environment for
these patients and are sensitive to
their needs during this time of crisis.
Why doesn't Stanford have a
SARI' program? Precisely for the
reasons stated above. It would be
very difficult (nearly impossible) for

any Emergency Department to
maintain the high standards of ex
pertise required when only perform
ing a few examinations per year.
Having inexperienced providers
conducting such exams would surely
endanger the very victims they
would be trying to protect. How
would the testimony of a less experi
enced provider hold up in a court of
law? That is why all of the Emer
gency Departments in Santa Clara
County rely on the expertise of the
SART program at VMC. As Santa
Clara County SART program direc
tor Linda Richards, RN. SAN I (Sex
ual Assault Nurse Examiner certi
fied). states, "This is not about Stan
lord Hospital, it is about providing
the very best care possible for stu
dent sexual assault victims."
It is unfortunate that the Editor
ial Board chose to publish their edi
torial without speaking to Linda
Richards, Diana Cummings (Direc
tor of the Keller Center for Family
Violence Intervention, San Mateo)
or Dr. Swaminatha Mahadevan
(Medical Director and Associate
Chief, Stanford University Emer
gency Department ). II they had
taken the time to do so, they would
understand the rationale behind the
carefully orchestrated evaluation of
sexual assault victims at Stanford. It
appears from the manner in which
Wednesday's editorial piece was
hastily thrown together, that there
was more intent on the part of the
authors to sensationalize the issue
than to determine the facts and
present a truthful description of
how sexual assault victims are man
aged.
The Stanford University Emer
gency Department prides itself on
being here 24/7 to serve the needs of
all Stanford students, including vic
tims of sexual assault â serving
them with compassion, expertise, in
tegrity and keeping their best inter
ests as our priority.
We would like to thank Linda
Richards and Diana Cummings for
their contributions to this piece.

Web site in February: http://www.stanford.
edu/group/svab/.
As noted in the editorial, acquaintance
rape, although underreported, does happen
at Stanford.The issues surrounding rape are
far from easy and the medical collection
exams mentioned by the editorial are one ex
ample. Medical Evidence Collection exams
are centralized by the county in order to im
prove the quality of evidence collected and
thereby increase the likelihood of successful
prosecution of perpetrators.This is a goal we
enthusiastically endorse. We recognize that a
15-minute drive to Valley Medical Center
can be troubling to a survivor who is already
in great distress, but she or he can be accom
panied and transported by friends, family
and/or residential staff members.
We would like to clarify the issues raised by
the editorial related to campus resources. For

more than a decade, many campus offices pro
vided victim assistance.The YWCA Sexual As
sault Center at Stanford opened its doors in
2005. The Center, located in a private office in
Vaden Health Center, is a partnership between
the University and the YWCA Rape Crisis
Center of Santa Clara County. Professional ad
vocates maintain strict confidentiality and hold
office hours, Monday through Thursday, 2 to 4
p.m. or by appointment. Ihe advocates empow
er survivors to make informed decisions, pro
vide campus and community resources for sup
port and healing and can assist survivors in
preparing for prosecution or a disciplinary
hearing. This is a complex and demanding
process. We wholeheartedly endorse the edito
rial's recommendation that the campus be
come familiar with the Center at Stanford,drop
in to meet the staff and develop confidence in
the partnership that has become a national
model for other campuses.
In addition to the Sexual Assault Center
office, our campus now has access to a dedi
cated Stanford number, (650)725-9955,
which links to the YWCA 24/7 hotline,
staffed by highly trained volunteers who re
spond to emergency situations. ITiey also
provide information about how to help a
friend, prevention efforts, relationship abuse
referrals and other resources.
The University takes the issue of sexual vio
lence and relationship abuse very seriously In
December 2006,The Daily published an article
"Stanford Wins Grant" announcing that Stan
ford's Community Partnership to F.nd Vio

lence Against Women was awarded a $220,000
grant from the U.S. Department of Justice's Of
fice for Violence Against Women. This grant
will result in paid internships for male and fe
male students to offer sexual violence and rela
tionship abuse education and prevention. It
should be apparent that both the administra
tion and the students dedicate a great deal of
thought and effort to ending campus sexual vi
olence and relationship abuse.
Finally, this is our message to any survivor:
You Jo not need to bear it alone. Seek help
from friends and others whom you trust and
respect. Use the services at Stanford s
YWCA Sexual Assault Center. Have confi
dence that your privacy, well-being and au
tonomy are our highest concern.
In closing,we would like to thank the writ
ers for raising awareness about this issue, lo

Sexual Assault at Stanford
The Jan. 10 editorial ("Sexual As
sault at Stanford") represents irre
sponsible and potentially harmful
journalism. The editorial's incorrect
and poorly researched assertion that
Stanford Emergency Department
provides inadequate medical servic
es for survivors of sexual assault is
not only false but also detrimental to
any person who may be a future vic
tim of sexual assault. For the benefit
of our students and the Stanford
community, we would like to provide
facts regarding the serious issue of
emergency evaluation of victims of
sexual assault at Stanford Emer
gency Department.
Any person presenting to Stan
ford's Emergency Department with
any type of complaint (regardless of
age, sex, race or ability to pay) is reg
istered as a patient and receives a
comprehensive medical screening
exam. Any patient presenting to the
Emergency Department with a com
plaint of "sexual assault" is made a
priority "one" (immediate attention
needed). A victim of sexual assault is
never told to wait and then placed in
the back of a police unit as incorrect
ly suggested by the Editorial Board.
We escort such patients to a private
examination room for immediate
evaluation by the Emergency De
partment staff (including the hospi
tal's social worker). We make every
effort to remain with the victim at ail
times to support their emotional and
medical needs.
Once the patient is deemed safe
and the Emergency Department
evaluation is complete, the police are
also notified as mandated by law.
With the patient's permission, they
are then transferred to the designat
ed sexual assault center of San
Mateo or Santa Clara County for a
comprehensive forensic medical
exam. Ihough Stanford Emergency
Department nurses have been
trained to disrobe sexual assault pa
tients in a way to collect any possible
piece of evidence, the nurses and
physicians do not conduct the actual
forensic medical examination for
good reason. A sexual assault exam
is not a "basic" service as written in
The Daily;and PERK (Physical Evi
dence Recovery Kit) is the name of

the evidence collection kit, not the
sexual assault exam.The actual exam
is a forensic medical and evidentiary
exam conducted by specialized pro
fessionals who are part of SART
(Sexual Assault Response Team).
Forensic sexual assault exams are
medical-legal examinations requir
ing specialized training and a team
approach. There is collaboration be
tween the medical, legal and judicial
systems to facilitate effective investi
gation and proper prosecution. The
editorial incorrectly states that there
is a 72 hour window in which to com
plete an exam. The forensic exami
nation produces DNA evidence for
10 days.
Both San Mateo County and
Santa Clara County have deemed it
necessary to designate a single sex
ual assault center for each county.
The Santa Clara County SART pro
gram is based at Valley Medical
Center (VMC) in San Jose. This
program sees patients from all 14
police jurisdictions of Santa Clara
County, including Stanford, l.os
Altos and Palo Alto. This Program
has been in continuous operation
since The forensic nurse ex
aminers are on call 24/7 for sexual
assault patients brought to VMC by
the police or arriving of their own
accord.The team consists of 16 very
well trained, clinically experienced
registered nurses, whose competen
cy and expertise are maintained
though the number of victims they
treat as well as ongoing specialized
training and recurring task-force
meetings. The forensic nurse exam
iners perform approximately 30
exams per month. Each exam takes
approximately 3-4 hours, during
which time the patient is inter
viewed and examined for medical as
well as forensic purposes, evidence
is collected, medication adminis
tered and emotional support pro
vided.The SART forensic nurse ex
aminers are court-qualified, expert
witnesses trained as to how to pro
vide effective testimony in sexual
assault cases.
Hie experienced SART members
at VMC understand the important
role they play in the care and evalua
tion of sexual assault victims. They
make every effort to provide a sup
portive, private environment for
these patients and are sensitive to
their needs during this time of crisis.
Why doesn't Stanford have a
SARI' program? Precisely for the
reasons stated above. It would be
very difficult (nearly impossible) for

any Emergency Department to
maintain the high standards of ex
pertise required when only perform
ing a few examinations per year.
Having inexperienced providers
conducting such exams would surely
endanger the very victims they
would be trying to protect. How
would the testimony of a less experi
enced provider hold up in a court of
law? That is why all of the Emer
gency Departments in Santa Clara
County rely on the expertise of the
SART program at VMC. As Santa
Clara County SART program direc
tor Linda Richards, RN. SAN I (Sex
ual Assault Nurse Examiner certi
fied). states, "This is not about Stan
lord Hospital, it is about providing
the very best care possible for stu
dent sexual assault victims."
It is unfortunate that the Editor
ial Board chose to publish their edi
torial without speaking to Linda
Richards, Diana Cummings (Direc
tor of the Keller Center for Family
Violence Intervention, San Mateo)
or Dr. Swaminatha Mahadevan
(Medical Director and Associate
Chief, Stanford University Emer
gency Department ). II they had
taken the time to do so, they would
understand the rationale behind the
carefully orchestrated evaluation of
sexual assault victims at Stanford. It
appears from the manner in which
Wednesday's editorial piece was
hastily thrown together, that there
was more intent on the part of the
authors to sensationalize the issue
than to determine the facts and
present a truthful description of
how sexual assault victims are man
aged.
The Stanford University Emer
gency Department prides itself on
being here 24/7 to serve the needs of
all Stanford students, including vic
tims of sexual assault â serving
them with compassion, expertise, in
tegrity and keeping their best inter
ests as our priority.
We would like to thank Linda
Richards and Diana Cummings for
their contributions to this piece.
