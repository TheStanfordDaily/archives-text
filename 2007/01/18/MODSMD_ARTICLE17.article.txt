## Stanford resources to help survivors of sexual violence 
### 
A recent Daily editorial ("Sexual Assault
at Stanford," Jan. 10) raises important issues
about campus services dedicated to helping
survivors of sexual violence. On behalf of the
Sexual Violence Advisory Board (SVAB).
which is a joint effort between students and
administrators, we would like to clarify a few
points.
SVAB was tasked by Vice Provost Greg
Boardman to examine and strengthen Stan
ford's response to sexual violence on campus
in 2005. We will launch a comprehensive new
Web site in February: http://www.stanford.
edu/group/svab/.
As noted in the editorial, acquaintance
rape, although underreported, does happen
at Stanford.The issues surrounding rape are
far from easy and the medical collection
exams mentioned by the editorial are one ex
ample. Medical Evidence Collection exams
are centralized by the county in order to im
prove the quality of evidence collected and
thereby increase the likelihood of successful
prosecution of perpetrators.This is a goal we
enthusiastically endorse. We recognize that a
15-minute drive to Valley Medical Center
can be troubling to a survivor who is already
in great distress, but she or he can be accom
panied and transported by friends, family
and/or residential staff members.
We would like to clarify the issues raised by
the editorial related to campus resources. For

more than a decade, many campus offices pro
vided victim assistance.The YWCA Sexual As
sault Center at Stanford opened its doors in
2005. The Center, located in a private office in
Vaden Health Center, is a partnership between
the University and the YWCA Rape Crisis
Center of Santa Clara County. Professional ad
vocates maintain strict confidentiality and hold
office hours, Monday through Thursday, 2 to 4
p.m. or by appointment. Ihe advocates empow
er survivors to make informed decisions, pro
vide campus and community resources for sup
port and healing and can assist survivors in
preparing for prosecution or a disciplinary
hearing. This is a complex and demanding
process. We wholeheartedly endorse the edito
rial's recommendation that the campus be
come familiar with the Center at Stanford,drop
in to meet the staff and develop confidence in
the partnership that has become a national
model for other campuses.
In addition to the Sexual Assault Center
office, our campus now has access to a dedi
cated Stanford number, (650)725-9955,
which links to the YWCA 24/7 hotline,
staffed by highly trained volunteers who re
spond to emergency situations. ITiey also
provide information about how to help a
friend, prevention efforts, relationship abuse
referrals and other resources.
The University takes the issue of sexual vio
lence and relationship abuse very seriously In
December 2006,The Daily published an article
"Stanford Wins Grant" announcing that Stan
ford's Community Partnership to F.nd Vio

lence Against Women was awarded a $220,000
grant from the U.S. Department of Justice's Of
fice for Violence Against Women. This grant
will result in paid internships for male and fe
male students to offer sexual violence and rela
tionship abuse education and prevention. It
should be apparent that both the administra
tion and the students dedicate a great deal of
thought and effort to ending campus sexual vi
olence and relationship abuse.
Finally, this is our message to any survivor:
You Jo not need to bear it alone. Seek help
from friends and others whom you trust and
respect. Use the services at Stanford s
YWCA Sexual Assault Center. Have confi
dence that your privacy, well-being and au
tonomy are our highest concern.
In closing,we would like to thank the writ
ers for raising awareness about this issue, lo
anyone interested in becoming involved,
please email us at perto@stanford.edu or
