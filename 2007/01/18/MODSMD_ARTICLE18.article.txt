## Nguyen taking center court After seeing limited action last season, sophomore has become one of team's most consistent performers 
### JACK SALISBURY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Standing at a mere 5-foot-4, Jessica
Nguyen isn't always the biggest presence on
the tennis court. But that hasn't stopped her
from emerging as one of the top players for

the three-time de
fending national
champion Stanford
women's tennis
team.
Nguyen, a sopho
more from Chatsworth,
Calif., has emerged as
a top player for a
team that lost its two
best starters from last
season.
At the Inter-Col
legiate Association

All-American tournament in October,
Nguyen won three consecutive matches in
the qualifying draw, making a small splash hv
qualifying for the main draw. It turned out to
be a precursor for her later and more notable
success, though, where she made it to both
the finals of the singles draw and the doubles
draw (with partner Celia Durkin). Jessica
also excelled at the ITA National Indoors,
where she was the only member of the Cardi
nal squad to advance past the first round of
the prestigious tournament.
The sophomore's impressive fall season
has been somewhat of a surprise,considering
that she didn't play in the top six for the team
during her freshman year and saw only limit
ed singles action.
Nguyen, who was home-schooled prior to
coming to Stanford, explained the struggles
that she experienced during her freshman
year.
"Fall quarter was very difficult with both
tennis and academics," she said. "The girls on
the team really helped me. My tennis wasn't
as great as I had hoped it would have been. I
thought I still improved but it was hard to im
prove as much as the other girls, and I wasn't
getting as much match play."
Coach Lele Forood also felt the same way
about the sophomore.
"We expected her to be a major player for
us, although not necessarily at first." she said.
"There's always adjustments during any
one's freshman year. We were a very deep
team last year, so she got into some matches
but certainly not all of them."
Nguyen was able to fine-tune her game
over the summer, working with fellow soph
omore teammate Megan Doheny during the
mornings and then training in the afternoon.
She also competed in several tournaments in
the Midwest.
Forood spoke highly of Nguyen's summer
efforts.
"I think she worked hard this summer,got
herself in the right mindset, had a chance to
experience college tennis this year and has
been running ever since," she said.
In spite of her smaller stature in compari
son to many of the other top tennis players,
Nguyen's fierce competitiveness and speed
carry her on the court.
"I'm not a big person, and a lot of the girls
in college are. but I'm an aggressive baselin
er." Nguyen said."l have a lot of variety in my
game and I use a lot. and that's something
that I'm still working on now. to incorporate
that [variety] on a regular basis."
Forood assessed the reason for Nguyen's
remarkable success in the early season.
"She's a very good player from a strategic
standpoint but has a very competitive atti
tude and really comes to play." she said.
"She's not intimidated by people."
Nguyen also attributed her success to hav
ing a lot of confidence going into matches.
"I'm confident in the way I'm playing and
it just feels good," she said. "I didn't let any
thing intimidate me. 1 just went out to the
tournaments and played like I knew I could,
and the results came."
Although the Cardinal's lineup of top six
has yet to be determined, the cagey sopho
more will most likely fit somewhere in the
mix after her impressive showings in the fall
tournament season.
Jessica has arrived at the collegiate level,
establishing herself as a key member of the
three-time defending national champions.
