It's Big Mac versus Ricky Hender
son. Hie 1 lulk against the Flash. The
Earth taking on a hurtling meteor.
But of all the hyperbole that could
describe tonight's game between a
Stanford team whose members could
model for Big and Tall and a small,
speedy No. 9 Oregon lineup, an actual
example might be even more jaw
dropping.
Stanford's 6-foot-5 Fred Washing
ton. who played power forward for
much of last season, will be asked to
guard Oregon sharpshooter Tajuan
Porter, a freshman who stands nearly a
foot shorter at 5-foot-6.
" 1 m going to be guarding a [5-foot
(>| guy, aren't I?" Washington said at
Monday's press conference, when he
realized that he would probably be
matched up against Porter. "This is
going to be interesting."
Cardinal head coach Trent Johnson
will start the lineup he has used in the
last two weeks. It compares favorably
with those of many NBA teams, fea
turing two 7-footers in freshmen
Brook and Robin Lopez, 6-foot-8
sophomore Lawrence Hill. Washing
ton and 6-foot-3 sophomore Anthony
Goods.
In contrast, 6-foot-9 Maarty Le
unen is the only player in Ducks coach
Ernie Kent's starting lineup who
stands over 6-foot-6.
But what Oregon lacks in size, it
more than makes up for in speed.
"If there's a quicker team in the
country, 1 can't imagine it," Johnson

said. "They're explosive."
Point guard Aaron Brooks, second
in the conference in scoring with 18.2
points per game — an eight-point im
provement over his average last sea
son — leads Oregon's fast-break at
tack. Johnson applied his praise of the
Ducks specifically to Brooks, calling
him perhaps the fastest player in the
nation.
"He's the fastest player I've ever
seen on tape," added a wry Goods,
who watched Brooks from the bench
in Stanford's two games against Ore
gon last season. "He'll be tough to
guard. He's attacking more this year
and shooting better. He causes a lot of
problems for us."
Trent Johnson said sophomore
point guard Mitch Johnson will proba
bly see more minutes tonight than he
has in the past few games, guarding
Brooks and bringing the ball up the
court against Oregon's press. An
under-the-weather Mitch Johnson
watched most of the games against the
Washington schools from the bench,
and felt so woozy against Washington
State that he had to excuse himself
from his coach's half-time locker
room speech.
The Cardinal (11-4, 3-2 Pacific-10
Conference) will rely on him to count
er Oregon's transition game, likely the
biggest challenge for Stanford's over
sized lineup.
"They get the ball and go," Wash
ington said in admiration. "All five of
them push."
"They're like a track team," Goods



ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore guard Mitch Johnson will face a tough challenge tonight guarding Oregon's Aaron Brooks, whose 1 8.2
points per game ranks second in the Pac-10.
