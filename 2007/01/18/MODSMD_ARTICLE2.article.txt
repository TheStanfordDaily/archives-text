It's Big Mac versus Ricky Hender
son. Hie 1 lulk against the Flash. The
Earth taking on a hurtling meteor.
But of all the hyperbole that could
describe tonight's game between a
Stanford team whose members could
model for Big and Tall and a small,
speedy No. 9 Oregon lineup, an actual
example might be even more jaw
dropping.
Stanford's 6-foot-5 Fred Washing
ton. who played power forward for
much of last season, will be asked to
guard Oregon sharpshooter Tajuan
Porter, a freshman who stands nearly a
foot shorter at 5-foot-6.
" 1 m going to be guarding a [5-foot
(>| guy, aren't I?" Washington said at
Monday's press conference, when he
realized that he would probably be
matched up against Porter. "This is
going to be interesting."
Cardinal head coach Trent Johnson
will start the lineup he has used in the
last two weeks. It compares favorably
with those of many NBA teams, fea
turing two 7-footers in freshmen
Brook and Robin Lopez, 6-foot-8
sophomore Lawrence Hill. Washing
ton and 6-foot-3 sophomore Anthony
Goods.
In contrast, 6-foot-9 Maarty Le
unen is the only player in Ducks coach
Ernie Kent's starting lineup who
stands over 6-foot-6.
But what Oregon lacks in size, it
more than makes up for in speed.
"If there's a quicker team in the
country, 1 can't imagine it," Johnson

said. "They're explosive."
Point guard Aaron Brooks, second
in the conference in scoring with 18.2
points per game — an eight-point im
provement over his average last sea
son — leads Oregon's fast-break at
tack. Johnson applied his praise of the
Ducks specifically to Brooks, calling
him perhaps the fastest player in the
nation.
"He's the fastest player I've ever
seen on tape," added a wry Goods,
who watched Brooks from the bench
in Stanford's two games against Ore
gon last season. "He'll be tough to
guard. He's attacking more this year
and shooting better. He causes a lot of
problems for us."
Trent Johnson said sophomore
point guard Mitch Johnson will proba
bly see more minutes tonight than he
has in the past few games, guarding
Brooks and bringing the ball up the
court against Oregon's press. An
under-the-weather Mitch Johnson
watched most of the games against the
Washington schools from the bench,
and felt so woozy against Washington
State that he had to excuse himself
from his coach's half-time locker
room speech.
The Cardinal (11-4, 3-2 Pacific-10
Conference) will rely on him to count
er Oregon's transition game, likely the
biggest challenge for Stanford's over
sized lineup.
"They get the ball and go," Wash
ington said in admiration. "All five of
them push."
"They're like a track team," Goods

Sophomore guard Mitch Johnson will face a tough challenge tonight guarding Oregon's Aaron Brooks, whose 1 8.2
points per game ranks second in the Pac-10.
added.
The Cardinal will try to slow the game
down and run a half-court offense, a plan
thai will depend on careful shot selection
and good ball control, [rent Johnson said
that the team will also try to exploit poten
tial mismatches and pound the ball inside,
where 7-foot Brook Lopez will be posting
up on 6-lbot-6 Oregon forward Malik
Hairston.
On the other side of the ball. Stanford's
big men will be forced to defend the
perimeter. All of Oregon's starters shoot
well from behind the arc— all make over
40 percent, in fact, except Brooks, who has
converted "only" 38 percent of his at
tempts.
"We don't want to have one of the
Lope/ twins matched up against a guard."
Johnson said.
Oregon (16-1.4-1) has turned heads by
eking out wins over Pac-10 rivals after
breezing through a light non-conference
schedule. After losing to USCon Jan. 4. the
team beat IJCLA,6B-66, then swept a road
trip at Arizona, defeating Arizona State,
60-55, and No. 11 Arizona, 79-77.
Fhe explanation for Ducks' improve
ment — they have already won more games
this season than they did in last year's 15-18
showing — can be largely attributed to the
fact that the team is a year older and wiser.
()regon retained all of the players in its rota
tion last year and added an impact player in
the freshman Porter, who averages 12.7
points and leads the Pac-10 in three-point
ers per game.
The team also shares the ball and shot
opportunities like a group that has been
playing together for several years. All five
starters average 12 or more points per
game, led by Brooks. Junior Bryce Taylor is
second on the team in scoring with 16.2
points per contest.
()regon's run seems even more impres
sive when one considers that last season's
leading scorer. Hairston. has been side
lined for much of the season with injuries.

in the soft tissue in his heel. Oregon beat
UCLA without Hairston before he re
joined the team for the Arizona trip.
Stanford's entire roster is also healthy,
with the possible exceptions of Mitch John
son and Washington, who is nursing a ten
der hamstring.
Tip-off is scheduled for 5:30.
TO WATCH
Jon, i 8 at Oregon
A win tonight could vault the Cardinal up
the conference standings and into great
position to earn a tourney berth. A loss
makes Saturday's game at Oregon State
nearly a must win.

Jan. 2: vs. use
While many fans will be looking ahead to
UCLA on Jan. 28, the matchup against the
Tro|ans could be more important. Stanford
and USC are battling in the middle of the
conference standings and a home loss
could be devastating. Freshman Taj Gib
son is a player to watch on an up-and
coming Trojans squad.
