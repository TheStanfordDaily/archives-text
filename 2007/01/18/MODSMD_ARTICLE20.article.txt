## GSC discusses Go Pass specifics and V-Day party 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The GSC wrapped up loose
ends from fall quarter and pre
pared for upcoming events at its
meeting hist night, including dis
cussing the recent Go Pass exten
sion and voting to fund the annu
al graduate Valentine's Day
party.
"We got the approval [for the
Go Pass), and we got most of the
money from the deans." said Mar
tin Mueller, member of the Grad
uate Student Transportation
Board that organized the one
time extension.
Negotiations at the end of last
quarter yielded a compromise
with the Provost's office and the
deans of the graduate schools to
share funding for the 2007 subsi
dized Go Pass program. While
this compromise only extended
the Go Pass program for the cur
rent year, there will be a ballot

measure in the spring elections
for a special fee to fund an annual
subsidy for future years.
The GSC also discussed the
upcoming Valentine's Day party,
slated to take place on Feb. 9. An
annual event, the party is free to
all graduate students 21 or older.
According to party planners, the
event is expected to cost $6,700
— of which $4,000 is dedicated
for alcohol at the open bar. The
GSC unanimously approved
contributing $3,500 to that
amount, with the rest of the
funding coming from various
other sources.
GSC members also attended
to a half-hour presentation
from Banana Loop.com. a new
event organizing service that
uses keywords to target audi
ences more narrowly. The Web
site is currently limited to select
testers but plans to open to the
Stanford community in upcom
ing weeks.
