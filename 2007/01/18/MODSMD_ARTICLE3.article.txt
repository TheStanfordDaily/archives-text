I have a confession to make. 'ITiis
whole Stanford sports scene? I 'm ac
tually kind of new to it all. I'm a jun
ior. so obviously I've been a fan for
three years — but before that? Not
really. I'm from St. Louis, so believe
me when 1 say that when people talk
about "Cardinal Pride" they don't
mean Stanford.
And that's why I really couldn't be
more excited about Trent Johnson
and Co. this year.
Let's face it. 12 straight Directors
Cups are nice and all. but the average
sports fan couldn't care less about

chronized water polo championship
race turns out. ITie only two colle
giate sports that truly have the abili
ty to capture people's attention on a
national level are football and men's
basketball. Maybe baseball would
have a chance if they got rid of the
aluminum bats. I mean the Little
League World Series is one thing, but
the college game needs to mirror the
pros and drop the "More Ping" slo
gan before anyone takes it seriously
as a pastime and not a homerun
derby.
Don't get me wrong; 1 love that
Stanford excels in the lesser known
sports of the world. If the NCAA is
going to govern competition in
something, we should expect noth
ing less of our University and our
student athletes than to shoot for the
stars.That they've succeeded in their
goals only speaks well of them. Hut
the very fact that these sports are less
popular means that the competition
is somewhat lessened. Not every Di
vision 1 program in the nation is real
ly killing itself to recruit the next golf
or tennis sensation, but everyone's
looking for the next Carmelo Antho
ny or Reggie Bush.
What I'm getting at is that Stan
ford's basketball team this year is
something new for all too many
Stanford students: a nationally rele
vant team in a nationally relevant
sport. Sure, the Matt Haryasz and
Chris Hernandez teams of the past
two years were competitive, but they
offered nowhere near the upside of
the Lopez twins and Anthony
Goods.
The Cardinal's record may not be
stellar (11-4, 3-2 Pacific-10 Confer
ence).but their conference is.As oth
ers have noted so far this season, the
Pac-10 has risen to the level of the
best in the nation; even if not all the
experts are willing to concede that it
is the strongest in the nation, at least
it's in the conversation. Nationally
ranked teams abound out West, with
UCLA. Oregon and Arizona all in
the top 11 of the AP poll.
Hut the true allure of this particu
lar Stanford team doesn't lie in its
record or the strength of its confer
ence alone. No. as anyone who
watched the Cardinal's most recent
three games, the team plays with a
scrappy. "Never say die" attitude
that has propelled them to big wins
over Virginia, Washington and
Washington State in recent weeks.
And that's not all Anthony Goods'
doing either. Even those who were
perceived as role players are step
ping up in a big way, as players like
Laurence Hill and Taj Finger have
had big moments late in bigger
games.
Still, the buzzword of the Cardi
nal this season is youth. With the
twin freshmen big-men, the future of
the front court is secure, and the
emergence of Goods and the more
recent emergence of Hill, who has
averaged 15.3 points over Stanford's
recent three game winning streak,
gives the team a pair of sophomore
difference makers.
It may still be too early in the sea
son to determine just how good the
Cardinal will be this year, but it looks
as if Stanford has found four starters
for the next three years. And that
can't be a bad thing.
In some ways, this is the best time
to be a fan. With a bright future and
a less-than-dull present, let the
Maples mayhem begin. There's no
reason not to enjoy this. A loss hurts
— it always does, — but the future
prospects of the young team are
more than reassuring enough to get
even the casual basketball aficiona
do through a rough game or two. It's
time to sit back, relax, and take note
of the future of Stanford basketball.
With a few more wins, the rest of
the Pac-10 and even the nation will
be too.
