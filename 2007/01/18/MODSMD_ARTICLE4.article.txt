No. 9 Stanford gearing up for struggling Ducks squad

Maples Pavilion will see its first
action since Anthony Goods' hack
to-back successes against Washing
ton and Washington State last
weekend. Luckily, though, the No. 9
Stanford women's basketball team
shouldn't need a last-minute savior
when it meets Oregon tonight at 7
p.m.
The Cardinal return from a road
trip to Washington, where they
gained momentum by extending
their winning streak to 12 games.
The dozen consecutive victories is
Stanford's longest stretch since
2004-05.
Meanwhile, the Ducks have pe
tered out since a hot 7-1 opening to
the season. Oregon has dropped in
five of its last eight contests, and it
has not been successful on the road
since Dec. 14.

ed by her teammates. Oregon
boasts the conference's leading
three-point field goal percentage at
just under 40 percent. Freshman
guard Taylor l.illey has hit 20-of-37
from behind the arc, while junior
Kaela Chapdelaine rounds out the
backcourt with 68 assists and 32
steals on the season. Jessie Shetters,
who measures up at 6-foot-6. will
help I taring in providing an inside
presence, averaging 5.4 rebounds
per game and blocking 27 shots on
the season.
I lowever, in recent outings, sen
ior Brooke Smith has proved that
she can handle nearly any match up
with ease. In the Cardinal's last
three games against the University
of South Carolina. Washington and
Washington State. Smith has regis
tered 2<S. 12 and 12 points respec-

tively.
Against Washington State
last weekend, she fell one re
bound short of a triple-dou
ble with nine rebounds and
10 assists.
Smith has shared post re
sponsibilities with senior tor
ward Kristen Newlin. who is
averaging more than 7.6 re
bounds per game and shoot
ing over 54 percent from the
field. Freshman center Jayne
Appel currently leads Stan
ford with 30 blocks.
The Cardinal hope to find
strength in junior guard Can
dice Wiggins despite an ankle
sprain that kept her out of
the game against Washington
State. Wiggins is averaging a
team-high 15.8 points per
game, and also leads the Car
dinal with 37 three-pointers.
Despite Wiggins' question
able status. Stanford (14-3. 7-
0) will look to freshman JJ
Hones to contribute in the
backcourt. Hones has recent
ly stepped into her role as
guard, distributing 70 assists
on the season and posting 17
points at Washington State.
As the Cardinal finish up
the front end of the Pac-10
season, they will rely on the
scoring balance and strong
defensive effort that has
placed them atop the confer
ence. Wins against Oregon
and Oregon State this week
will help maintain confi
dence and momentum before
Stanford travels to meet No.
10 Arizona State at the end of
the month. To do so. the Car
dinal will have to take advan
tage of their home court ad
vantage to further extend
their winning streak.
