# Ducks never an easy foe
## If history holds, tonight's game will be decided late 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ihe last time the Cardinal traveled north to
pi a > the Oregon at Mac Arthur court, they
brought along point guard Chris Hernandez —
one of the most clinch players in the team's recent
history. Hernandez's presence was especially
comforting because Stanford's last three games in
the Pit have come down to the final shot, and llcr
n indez had experience playing big games there,
including a memorable 22-point second-half per
formance that preserved the Cardinal's unbeaten
streak during the 2003-2004 season.
Not surprisingly, the former point guard
stepped up when the team needed him most,scor
ing Stanford's final eight points and draining a
three from the top of the key with 11.3 seconds
left to give his team a 57-56 victory.The perform
mce came only four days after he had converted
three free throws with two-tenths of a second left
to tie Washington at Maples Pavilion, and a cou
ple of weeks before he hit two game-winning free
throws against Southern California.
I he ('ardinal will travel to the Pit without I ler
nandez for the first time in four years, but it seems

that the team would still be in pretty good shape if
this game comes down to the final minutes. Stan
ford has eked out victories on the last possession in
each of its last three games, relying on various
means a Lawrence Hill lloater.a defensive stop
and an Anthony Goods three — to seal the win.
"When you have an open shot late in a game,
you just have to take it." senior guard Fred Wash
ington said."There's so much else going on,you're
not even thinking about those kinds of shots. Over
time, you learn not to panic."
Goods said that it's a matter of confidence,
something that he seems to have gained last week
end. when his last-second theatrics helped him
earn the Pacific-10 Conference Player of the
Week award. I le looked a lot like I lernandez, hit
ting what proved to be the game-winning free
throws with 27 seconds left against Washington on
Thursday before burying Washington State with a
three-pointer in the last seconds of overtime. He
didn't hesitate when the ball ended up in his
hands, despite the fact that he had missed a con
tested. off-balance jumper that could have won
the game at the end of regulation.
Fittingly enough. Goods took his first step to
ward taking over Hernandez's role in an away
game at Washington State last season, when he
tipped in Hernandez's missed jumper to beat the
buzzer and the Cougars.

Sophomore forward Lawrence Hill collected 1 5 points in the Cardinal's nail-biting win over the No. 23 Cougars. Tonight, he and
his teammates will have to focus on defense if they have any hope of stopping a quick Oregon offense.
