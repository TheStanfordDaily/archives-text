### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Senior Sabrina Duim. a math
major and talented musician, died on
Saturday in her apartment in Palo
Alto.
Duim,22. hailed from Irvine, Calif,
and graduated from St. Margaret's
Episcopal School in 2003.
According to Sergeant Sandra
Brown of the Palo Alto Police De
partment. the death occurred some
time between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Jan.
13 at Duim's off-campus apartment
on Alma St. Close friend and room
mate Ashley Brewer, a senior, found
Duim in her apartment around 3 p.m.
According to Brewer, the incident
was a result of complications involv
ing medications she was taking.
Though Brewer said that no one is
quite sure what this means or what ex
actly happened, she did say that the
death was accidental.
Friends overwhelmingly used the
word "sassy" to describe Duim, an ac
complished musician and student.
"Sabrina had a luminous personal
ity and a really dry. sarcastic sense of
humor." said friend Kyle Williams, a
2004 graduate. "I think what people
know about her is that she was a par
ticularly loyal friend. She was really a
good friend to a lot of people."
Senior John Collins had been a
close friend of Duim's since freshman
vear. when both lived on West Cam

pus.
"She had a sassy humor that tran
scended a lot of boundaries." he said.
"As for small and personal memories,
we watched a lot of zombie movies
and Dodgers games together, because
those were two of small things she re
ally loved to do."
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education and Dean of Freshman-
Sophomore College (FroSoCo) John
Bravman served as Duim's pre-major
u nde rgrad uate ad visor.
"Sabrina was more than talented;
she was truly gifted." Bravman re
called. "1 ler heart was set on a career
in science and by the time of her trag
ic passing she had already engaged in
several significant research projects.
She was particularly interested in
human immunology."
Music was also a huge part of
Duim's life, as she was an accom
plished harpist who toured with the
indie rock band Bright Eyes in 2005.
She can be heard in the 2005 album
Digital Asli in the Digital Urn on
tracks entitled "Hit the Switch,"
"Devil in the Details" and "Theme
from Pinata." She also recorded with
Rilo kiley.
More recently, she played with
Volunteer Pioneer, a folk-pop band
formed in 2004. Based in San Francis
co, the band featured Williams and

Jason Byers in addition to Duim.
"The music she made, both orches
tral and popular, was well crafted and
nuanced and personal," Collins said.
"She imbued the music she made
with a great deal of soul and personal
ity. She left her own stamp on every
thing she did."
FroSoCo Director Andy Dimock
remembered Duim sharing her musi
cal talents with her housemates dur
ing Cafe Night.
"I'd rarely seen a harpist perform,
and never in such an intimate set
ting." Dimock said. "It was magical."
Bravman also remembered Sabri
na's musical gifts.
"She entranced students with her
harp, many of whom had never en
countered the instrument before." he
said.
According to Williams, Duim was
deciding whether to pursue a career

in music, become more involved in
business, or dive into the sciences,
where she could take advantage of
her math degree and research experi
ence.
In 2003, Duim told the magazine
OC Family that she hoped to be a re
search scientist, perhaps even finding
a cure for cancer.
In high school.she worked in a lab
oratory at UC Irvine, researching T
cell movements in lymph nodes. She
also participated in the UC Irvine
Symphony Orchestra and the cross
country team In addition. Duim's in
terests included fencing, dance, fash
ion and volunteer work.

Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education

Duim was highly regarded by stu
dents and faculty alike.
Math Prof. Greg Brumfiel. Sabri
na's major advisor, last saw her early
autumn quarter, when they discussed
finishing her math major require
ments.
"She brought something quite
unique," said Brumfiel, citing her life
as a musician. "1 found her stories of
life on the road very exotic. At the
same time, Sabrina was such a sweet
person, calm and rather quiet."
Senior Tina Kin was Duim's neigh
bor in FroSoCo during their sopho
more year.
"She was definitely a great contri

bution to the Stanford community
and we'll miss her a lot," she said.
Duim was the first person Lin met
at FroSoCo; after Lin's parents
dropped her off. Duim and her family
invited her to sit with them at lunch.
"She had that kind of personality
where she just talked to people â€” she
wasn't afraid to talk to anybody." Lin
said.
Bravman said that he was "truly
shocked and saddened beyond meas
ure" upon hearing of Duim's passing.
"Sabrina was liked by everyone,
was kind, serene and humble," he
said. "All of us at Stanford were fortu
nate that she walked among us."
Collins said he relished the chance
to know her.
"She was. as a person, perhaps dif
ficult to know, or difficult to under
stand perfectly, but to try was, for
those close to her. to find a great deal
of happiness."
Memorial services, open to the
public, will be held in San Francisco
on Sunday afternoon. For more infor
