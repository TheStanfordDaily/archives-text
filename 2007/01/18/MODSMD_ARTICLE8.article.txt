## Growth hormones not a cure-all for aging Inadequate hormone therapy may actually induce unwanted side effects 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a report released Tuesday, a team from the Medical
School debunked the popular assumption that growth
hormones slow the aging process. The Stanford study,
conducted over the last two years, showed that in addi
tion to only marginal benefits, growth hormones can ac

tually put users at risk for a number of ailments includ
ing diabetes,carpal tunnel syndrome and joint swelling.
"All of our research suggested that the growth hor
mone therapy had modest benefits but the possibility of
serious side effects," said Medical I-'el low llau I in. the
lead author of the study. "People are paying hundreds to
thousands of dollars a month for this kind of therap\
for hormones that should really not be used for this pur
pose. This is not the magic bullet everyone thinks it is."
Liu found that while the drug can minimally build
muscle and decrease body fat. it does not improve bone
density, cholesterol or maximum oxygen consumption.
"Overall, your weight, bone density and stamina

don't change, and there is no evidence to suggest that
growth hormones given to a healthy person will lead to a
longer life," Liu said.
Vccording to a study published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association in 2005, the number of
people in the I 'nited States using growth hormone ther
apy for its supposed anti-aging benefits had topped
30.000.
Federal regulators approve of the use of growth hor
mones as a treatment for children and other patients
with growth problems, but forbid
commercial distribution of the drug
for anti-aging purposes.
"It is illegal for drug companies to
distribute any drugs that are not
under FDA approval and anti-aging
does not fall under FDA usage," Liu
said. "So no drug company is really
going to try and refute us."
However, this technical legal
block has not prevented doctors
from prescribing it to an increasing
number of elderly patients, despite
costs exceeding $1,000 a month.
"If you went to a gym pretty reg
ularly. you could get the same
changes without breaking into too
much of a sweat, and you wouldn't
spend $1,000 to $2,000 per month,"
Liu said.
Over the course of two years, Liu
and his team examined 31 medical
studies published around the world,
focusing on more than 500 elderly
patients who underwent at least six
months of growth hormone therapy
to treat effects of aging.
"When we started the project, we
were specifically interested in un
derstanding both the potential bene
fits and harms associated with the
use of growth hormone on the
healthy elderly," said Dena Bravata.

a senior research scientist at the
Medical School and one of the seven
researchers of the study. "We de
signed the study, a meta-analysis of
the published literature on the use of
growth hormone in this population,
to specifically look for both poten
tial positive and negative effects."
Liu said he was surprised at the
limited amount of research that had
been done in this field.
"We found only 18 unique studies
that included a little more than 200
tried patients," Liu said.
Bravata attributed the popularity
of the false myth to healthy individ
uals extrapolating the hormone's
positive edge on hormone-deficient
patients to the general population.
"When someone whose growth
hormone level is low is given the
hormone, they increase muscle mass,
decrease fat mass and increase stam
ina," Bravata said.
Liu pointed to a 1990 study as the
primary source of popular assump
tions.
"In the Journal of Medicine in
1990, they wrote about the effect of
growth hormones in 12 elderly men,
and found slight changes in body
composition and skin." Liu said.
"Many proponents have locked on
to this study and that's probably how
the whole idea came into fruition.
However, the results were clearly
preliminary and the authors of the
study suggested that a lot more re
search had to be done."
