## Growth hormones not a cure-all for aging Inadequate hormone therapy may actually induce unwanted side effects 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a report released Tuesday, a team from the Medical
School debunked the popular assumption that growth
hormones slow the aging process. The Stanford study,
conducted over the last two years, showed that in addi
tion to only marginal benefits, growth hormones can ac

tually put users at risk for a number of ailments includ
ing diabetes,carpal tunnel syndrome and joint swelling.
"All of our research suggested that the growth hor
mone therapy had modest benefits but the possibility of
serious side effects," said Medical I-'el low llau I in. the
lead author of the study. "People are paying hundreds to
thousands of dollars a month for this kind of therap\
for hormones that should really not be used for this pur
pose. This is not the magic bullet everyone thinks it is."
Liu found that while the drug can minimally build
muscle and decrease body fat. it does not improve bone
density, cholesterol or maximum oxygen consumption.
"Overall, your weight, bone density and stamina

don't change, and there is no evidence to suggest that
growth hormones given to a healthy person will lead to a
longer life," Liu said.
Vccording to a study published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association in 2005, the number of
people in the I 'nited States using growth hormone ther
apy for its supposed anti-aging benefits had topped
30.000.
