# STUDENT CAREERS
## Demystifying the allure of finance jobs 
### BETH WILKINS 
With lucrative salaries and perceived prestige, it's no
wonder investment banking and consulting are attrac
tive first jobs for graduating Stanford seniors. Yet as sum
mer internship application season for non-graduating
students begins, alums and career counselors are advis
ing job hunters to look beyond big paydays.
Career Development Center (CDC) Director Lance
Choy has seen a surge in interest in consulting and in
vestment banking over the last several years.
"As the economy has improved, so has recruiting in
these fields." he said in an email to The Daily. Firms like
McKinsey and JP Morgan run highly visible recruiting
campaigns on campus, holding infor-

r—© ;• - r c
mation sessions, advertising in cam-

pus publications and flooding
dortn chat lists with advertise- *

tnents.
But Choy said he is con
cerned that student inter
est in consulting and I
banking can be fueled
more by post-graduation
insecurities than a real in
terest in those fields.
"Many of them have
limited knowledge about
other career paths or alter
natives." he said.
Tim Chueh. a 2005 grad
uate, said that while com
pensation was a factor in his

decision to enter I banking as
an analyst with Merrill Lynch, lie-

said that it was interest in
financial markets and his

desire for experience that led him to the field. If you're
just in it for the money. Chueh says think again.
"It's not worth sacrificing your life when you're 22 for
an extra thousand bucks." he said.
According to the CDC Web site, reported salary of
fers for the ('lass of 2006 averaged $54,357 for consulting
and $61,250 for I -banking. By comparison, offers in edu
cation averaged $37,900, and in government. $40,958.
But Choy noted that these figures don't account for
number of hours per work week.
"Though students may think it's worth putting up
with a 60-80 hour work week for a couple of years. 1
know some pretty miserable young alumni," lie said.
CDC Career ("ounselor Stephanie Lberle noted that
many students think they will love consulting because of
the extensive traveling it requires, but fail to realize how
stressful business travel can actually be.
And while corporate positions do make a good entry
point into the professional world, Choy added that they
are not the only way to succeed in a new career or to im
press an MBA program. CDC survey results from 2004
to 2006 show that while many alumni do find positions
with consulting and 1-banking firms, they also entered a
wide variety of fields including engineering, communica
tion, education and research.
Junior Lindsay Reinsmith is graduating early and al
ready has plans to work for the consulting firm Accen
ture. While she was mainly attracted by the chance to use
her analytical and communication skills in a business en
vironment. salary considerations also weighed heavily
on her.
"I felt nothing else was going to pay me enough to
start paying off my debt," she said.
