## Editorial Board Revaluating Fraga's departure 
### 
The recent protests and student outcry
surrounding Professor Luis Fraga's
impending departure have addressed
continuing, legitimate concerns about los
ing a minority role model. However, keep
ing the conversation chained to issues of
race and diversity misses the point that we
are losing a talented teacher when we al
ready have a dearth of faculty who excel at
maintaining a presence in the classroom.
Beyond all the qualms about race and
faculty diversity the overarching concern
that Stanford will have one fewer engaging
lecturer, skilled scholar and sincere mentor.
For students whose academic careers have
been peppered with large lecture hall class
es with droning professors, there is some
thing to be said for a professor who elicits
intellectual inquiry and investment from his
students.The fact that so many students and
members of the Stanford community were
willing to step up and speak out about re
taining Luis Fraga speaks volumes about
the qualities we all value in our professors.

I le was and is an example of achievement in
race and ethnic politics, but. most impor
tantly. he exemplifies what it means to be a
great teacher in the classroom.
When searching for a replacement, the
University should take care to prioritize
among its criteria the unparalleled enthusi
asm and dedication that Professor Fraga
brought to his interactions with his stu
dents. Unlike many of our faculty, Professor
Fraga made himself accessible and avail
able to all students, whether they were in his
classes or not. and was truly a source of in
spiration and mentoring for various indi
viduals and student groups. Prioritizing eth
nicity over commitment to students would
be a mistake, though efforts should also be
made to fill Fraga's niche in race and ethnic
ity politics, l et's not forget that, above all.
Professor Fraga made his greatest contribu
tion to students by sparking the intellectual
curiosity that defines Stanford as a commu
nity of scholars, and we should not settle lor
anything less.
