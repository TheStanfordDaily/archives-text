# Football, tradition and dinosaur hormones
## 
### 
Is there any better excuse than playoff
season? Putting off work to watch a reg
ular season NBA game leaves an unset
tling residue of guilt, but an NFL playoff
game makes you feeling better for having
watched it. Deep down, you know you did
the right thing. To have done your home
work, to have not watched, would have been
un-American.
Playoff season is also a great excuse to
eat greasy food. I think this goes back to
prehistoric times, to the days when cavemen
would sit around gnawing on mastodon legs,
grease dribbling down their chins, and
watch their buddies throw around a big
rock. The West Coast passing offense was
just coming into its own. Brady versus Man
ning was Okk versus Grogg. Accusations of
juicing with dinosaur hormones received
pangeal attention. After the game, the win
ners were crowned with ceremonial gar
lands inscribed with the names of spear tip
craftsmen.
My favorite football food, maybe my fa
vorite food of all time, is Buffalo wings. Un
fortunately. no food has gotten worse treat
ment at the hands of dining hall chefs. "Buf
falo wings" are a staple in several dining
halls, but, in a noble effort to mass produce
them and perhaps make them healthier,
they are baked instead of fried and drowned
in a sort of tomato sauce. The result is a
tame, soggy creation that has little to do
with the classic from which it takes its name.
If you want the real thing, you have to do it
yourself.
Great Buffalo wings require three things.
First, they must be crispy.That means deep
fried. Second, they must be spicy. And third,
they must be served with bleu cheese sauce
(not ranch dressing).
Greasy foods are good, grease lires are
not. It's smart to take a few precautions to

avoid burning down your house. Start with
an oil with a high smoking point (meaning
the oil can get very hot without burning).
Peanut oil has a very high smoking point, as
does grapeseed oil. Vegetable oil is also fine.
Make sure to dry the wings thoroughly be
fore slipping them into the oil. since water
and oil don't mix. You'll also need a candy
thermometer to measure the temperature
of the oil.
Buffalo Wings
12 chicken wings
Oil for frying
1 cup hot sauce
1/2 cup butter
In a large pot. heat enough oil to fully
cover the wings to 350 degrees F. Fry the
wings for about 10-12 minutes, until golden
brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and
drain on paper towels, then transfer to a
bowl.
Melt the butter over low in a medium
size pan. Add the hot sauce and allow the
mixture to heat. Pour over the wings and
serve with bleu cheese dressing and, if at all
possible, those little wet napkins.
Email Nate at tis< edii with
