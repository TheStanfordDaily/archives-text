"Pot of Wisdom"
I wanted to thank Darren Franich for his
wonderfully rude and irreverent reflections
on the merits of Mary Jane ("The cutest lit
tle addiction." Jan. 16)). Clearly, he has ex
plored the cultural and psychological ter
rain of which he speaks and returned with
worthwhile insights.
Mr. Franich has no further need to pon
der the writing thing, failed novel or not.
This 58-year-old failed novelist will be look
ing for his byline.

Misplaced Marijuana Madness
Regarding Darren Franich's Jan. 16th
column, if health outcomes determined
drug laws instead of cultural norms, mari
juana would be legal. Unlike alcohol, mari
juana has never been shown to cause an
overdose death, nor does it share the addic
tive properties of tobacco. Marijuana can
be harmful if abused, but jail cells are inap
propriate as health interventions and inef
fective as deterrents. The first marijuana
laws were enacted in response to Mexican
migration during the early I ( HM)s, despite
opposition from the American Medical As
sociation.

Dire warnings that marijuana inspires
homicidal rages have been counterproduc
tive at best.
White Americans did not even begin to
smoke pot until a soon-to-be entrenched
government bureaucracy began funding
reefer madness propaganda. By raiding
voter-approved medical marijuana
providers in California, the very same U.S.
Drug I nforcement Administration that
claims illicit drug use funds terrorism is forc
ing cancer and AIDS patients into the hands
of street dealers. Apparently, marijuana
prohibition is more important than protect
ing the country from terrorism. Students
who want to help end the intergenerational
culture war otherwise known as the war on
some drugs should contact Students for
