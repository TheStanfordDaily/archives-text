# What's in a number?
## 
### 
Last week's i Phone debut and the excite
ment that followed got me thinking...
I Jfe used to be so simple. Not long ago,
children played in the park after school, peo
ple eha'ted amiably with their neighbors and
romantic prospects had only three options
for contact with one another — live interac
tion. honest-to-goodness letter-writing or
phone conversation.
ITianks to email, online chatrooms. instant
messaging programs and, of course, cell
phones with text-messaging capabilities,
the first two traditional methods of courtship
may be headed the way of the dinosaur. Just
ask the US Postal Service, who just removed
ten percent of previously existing mailboxes
due to lack of use.) But,some would claim, the
third option — the phone call — appears to
be alive and well. Look no further than the
single restaurant-goer dining in the company
of iiis Trio or the earbudded driver who just
cut you off in rush-hour traffic.
There's no doubt, though, that current
telecommunication is very different from its
predecessor, and not just because of the in
creasingly colorful, decreasing!)' bulky de
vices themselves (the iPhone measures4.s by
2.4 by 0.4(i inches — almost small enough for
women to carry in their backpockets without
ruining the. urn, view). Thanks to treedom,
frequency and finances, what was once a sim
ple. black-and-white step in the dating
process — the number request/exchange —
has entered a grey zone.
It may be hard to imagine now, but, as re
cently as the early nineties, phone conversa
tions occurred within the confines of the
home, office or, occasionally, phone booth.
Before cordless technology, the boundaries
were even narrower, dictated by the length
and flexibility of the cord itself. Now, howev
er, we can — and do — talk anywhere, any
time. In the airport security line, at the gym,
on the chairlift, at the top of the mountain
wherever we can get service (or. it we're will
ing to pay for it. analog).
One result of this relatively new freedom
is the frequency with which people speak to
one another. Back when being on the phone
meant sitting at your kitchen table,to the ex
clusion of cleaning the living room or run
ning errands, a phone call was a serious com
mitment of time, energy and focus. As a pro
fessional multi-tasker, 1 am certainly guilty of

double-booking (1 am convinced that my
best conversations happen while moving),
but I have yet to master multi-focusing. A
surprising number of people, however, claim
to be capable of carrying on three simultane
ous IM conversations while playing chess
while checking email. As someone who has
been on the other side of said IMs, I think it's
fair to say that their supposed "multi-focus"
reads more like ADD
Finally, cell phones have drastically
changed the finances involved in telecommu
nication. It's no longer a big deal to call some
one long distance, especially if it's after nine
o'clock or if both speakers happen to have
the same carrier. Assuming neither battery
dies and no one loses reception, a four-hour
conversation is no different from a four
minute one (with the exception of its ru
mored cancer-causing potential).
These changes affect all phone interac
tions, though. So what are the specific conse
quences within the dating world? First and
foremost, the overwhelming reduction in
commitment means that asking for a phone
number no longer means as much. What was
once an indication of serious interest — I will
call you when I am at home and available to
talk, and you will have to be home and unoc
cupied in order for us to speak to one anoth
er— can now be an indication of any num
ber of things. "It's about keeping my options
open," a 25-year-old male friend of mine said,
"if I had a good time, 1 want to know that 1
can call her again, if I want to." Not will, but
can.
"Who knows what's going to happen in
the next week?" he continued."Maybe I'll be
bored, maybe I'll be in the mood to hook up
with her (this is especially likely if we've al
ready hooked up), maybe Ill be drunk and in
the mood to flirt via text-messaging."
As a single girl who's given out her num
ber more than once in the past few months, I

find this range of options more than slightly
depressing. I only give my number to guys 1
would actually want to hear from again (and
no. 1 don't believe in giving out fake numbers
when I'm not interested — that's what my
email address is for). Is there no way to read
a number request as indicative of a more pos
itive potential outcome? 1 would like to be
lieve that it depends on the context in which
the exchange occurs (post-hookup, post-five
minute chat, post-mind-blowing conversa
tion). but recent history suggests that this is
not the case. I've heard from guys I never ex
pected to while other, seemingly more inter
ested prospects have dropped off the planet.
The mention of email raises a side ques
tion: does a number mean more or less than
an email address? An optimist would say that
email indicates a desire for intellectual com
munication, an exchange of words and ideas,
while a number is much more conducive to a
late-night boredom (or booty) call. A pes
simist would say that email is inherently less
personal, lacking both the non-verbal cues of
live interaction and the intonations and in
flections of actual conversation. (Say what
you will: in my opinion, punctuation marks
are a poor and ambiguous substitute....)
Regardless of the information exchanged
or requested. 1 think it's safe to say that
context is both crucial and complicated.
Judging someone's availability based on an
interaction at a party or in a bar is virtually
impossible; people go out to talk to others
(which is, presumably, what you've been
doing prior to the number/email request).
Add alcohol (and/or other substances) to the
mix, and it's safe to say that what you
see/hear/feel is not necessarily what you get.
A thousand words and a fair amount of
thought later, I can draw only one conclu
sion. The only surefire way to find out
what's in a number is to ask. Unless you're a
fan of awkward and intense moments, I don't
recommend this tactic. Playing it cool dic
tates that you don't ask about intentions —
back in the day, that was your father's job.

Despite the complications of the number ex
change, Lisa Mendelman went over her cell
phone minutes last month. You already have
her email address, though
HsnmeQstanford.edu, so what are you waiting
for?
