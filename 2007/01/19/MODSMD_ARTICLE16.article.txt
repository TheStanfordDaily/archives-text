## NO FIGHT No. 9 Stanford wins big for 13th straight victory 
### SCOTT BLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Thirteen did not prove unlucky for the
Stanford women's basketball team on
Thursday night as they beat Oregon 70-48
for their 13th consecutive victory.
Junior guard ("issy Pierce scored a career
high 14 points to lead the Cardinal (15-3,8-0
Pacific-10 Conference), and senior center
kristen Newlin grabbed 13 of Stanford's 55
rebounds, its highest total this season.
"It was kind of one of those mellow
games." coach l ira VanDerveer said. "It
wasn't real exciting, but we had some real
nice big plays that we got excited about."
Senior forward Brooke Smith (12
points) snapped Stanford out of a tunk late
in the first half to rally the team, and Pierce
nailed a buzzer-beating 19-footer to cap a
15-0 run. which established a 31-12 lead at
the break after perhaps the Cardinal's ugli
est stretch of offensive play this season.
"1 thought we dodged a lot of bullets in
that first half," VanDerveer said. "But our
team didn't get frustrated, they didn't get
discouraged, and they just stayed with it."
A different player scored each of the first
four baskets for the Cardinal as it started
yet another game on an early run. Oregon
(10-7. 2-5 Pac-10) missed their first nine
shots before senior forward Carolyn Ganes
hit a jumper in the lane from six feet.
The teams then proceeded to trade
bricks for much of the next ten minutes.
Stanford's usually reliable post players
were guilty of some glaring misses during a
shocking 0-for-l 1 stretch over eight-and-a
half minutes in the middle of the first peri
od.Hie Ducks did not fare much better after
cutting Stanford's lead to 10-8. But they
went only 2 for 11 for the rest of the half and
turned the ball over four times in the last
2:08 before the break.

NOTES: Stanford has continued to climb in the nation
al polls since its early season struggles. The Cardinal
have won 13 straight games and are a perfect 8-0 in
the Pac-10. Candice Wiggins returned to the starting
lineup after missing last week's game against Wash
ington State with an ankle injury. The junior guard
struggled in her first game, tallying only nine points
and three rebounds. The Cardinal have had fantastic
scoring balance all season, posting three double
digit scorers in all but three games this year. Senior
forward Brooke Smith, freshman center Jayne Appel
and junior guard Cissy Pierce all notched at least 10
points against Oregon last night. Stanford's defense
has been solid as well. Entering last night's action,
the Card have allowed 56.8 points per game.

thought of a Ducks comeback. Smith and
sophomore forward Jillian I larmon each hit
consecutive shots to widen the Cardinal's
lead, which expanded to 30 after a Pierce
three-pointer with 11:05 remaining.

ting two three-pointers. VanDerveei
did not spare any praise for her
third-year guard.
"This is how we see Cissy play
ing," VanDerveer said. "This season
she's almost bent over backwards to
be too team-oriented. 1 want her to
be more aggressive offensively."
Pierce agreed that she is begin
ning to take advantage of how teams
are guarding her.
"It's just a matter of taking what
the defense gave me." Pierce said.
"A lot of teams will probably play
me that way and give me the oppor
tunity to hit my three."
Freshman center Jayne Appel
also chipped in with yet another
strong performance, scoring 12
points and pulling down seven
boards in only 16 minutes of play.
She also had two blocked shots.

Junior guard Candice Wiggins re
turned to the starting lineup after
missing the previous game against
Washington State with a sprained
ankle. She scored nine points hut
was clearly not at full strength. Van-
Derveer said that her ankle will be
reevaluated before the coaching
staff determines whether she will
play this weekend.
Oregon's 12 first-half points, on
19.4 percent field goal shooting, was
the lowest total for any Stanford op
ponent since the team held Long Is
land to 1 1 in the first period in Nov.
2005. Until they went on a run
against the Cardinal's reserves at
the end of the game, the Ducks were
in danger of becoming the lowest
scoring conference opponent in
Stanford's history. That distinction
still belongs to California.The Gold
en Bears scored 36 points at Maples
Pavilioin in 19%.
Stanford returns to action at
home on Saturday at 2 p.m. to wrap
up the first half of its Pac-10 sched
ule against Oregon State.
