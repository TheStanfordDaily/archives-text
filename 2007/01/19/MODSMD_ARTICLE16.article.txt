### SCOTT BLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER

Stanford women's basketball team on
Thursday night as they beat Oregon 70-48
for their 13th consecutive victory.
Junior guard ("issy Pierce scored a career
high 14 points to lead the Cardinal (15-3,8-0

kristen Newlin grabbed 13 of Stanford's 55
rebounds, its highest total this season.
"It was kind of one of those mellow
games." coach l ira VanDerveer said. "It
wasn't real exciting, but we had some real
nice big plays that we got excited about."
Senior forward Brooke Smith (12
points) snapped Stanford out of a tunk late
in the first half to rally the team, and Pierce
nailed a buzzer-beating 19-footer to cap a
15-0 run. which established a 31-12 lead at
the break after perhaps the Cardinal's ugli
est stretch of offensive play this season.
"1 thought we dodged a lot of bullets in
that first half," VanDerveer said. "But our
team didn't get frustrated, they didn't get
discouraged, and they just stayed with it."
A different player scored each of the first
four baskets for the Cardinal as it started
yet another game on an early run. Oregon
(10-7. 2-5 Pac-10) missed their first nine
shots before senior forward Carolyn Ganes
hit a jumper in the lane from six feet.
The teams then proceeded to trade
bricks for much of the next ten minutes.

the Pac-10. Candice Wiggins returned to the starting
lineup after missing last week's game against Wash
ington State with an ankle injury. The junior guard
struggled in her first game, tallying only nine points
and three rebounds. The Cardinal have had fantastic
scoring balance all season, posting three double

forward Brooke Smith, freshman center Jayne Appel
and junior guard Cissy Pierce all notched at least 10
points against Oregon last night. Stanford's defense
has been solid as well. Entering last night's action,
