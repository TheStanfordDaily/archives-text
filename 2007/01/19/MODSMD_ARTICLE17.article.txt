## First win for Card won't come easy 
### BY REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's volleyball team will
have an extra chance at its elusive first win of
the season this weekend, as the Cardinal takes
on No. 2 Brigham Young both Friday and Sat
urday night.
After playing a pair in Utah last season, the
Cardinal (0-5, 0-2 Mountain Pacific Sports
Conference) will face the Cougars (4-0.2-0) at
home this time, though under unfamiliar cir
cumstances. As in many sports, volleyball
teams generally travel in pairs, playing two
opponents in a weekend series. Hut because
BYU and Hawaii have no conference neigh
bors. the Warriors and Cougars travel solo.
"It's a situation that we don't get to see
often enough," head coach John Kostv said.
"It's kind of a flip of the coin because of the
quick turnaround. You know exactly what's
going to be on the other side of the net the

NOTES ! The Cougars are coming off of a solid week
end at home with a sweep against No. 3 UCLA 30-
28, 30-22, 30-26 on Friday evening and 30-21,
30-23, 33-31 on Saturday evening. On Friday
night, sophomore Yosleyder Cala led BYU with
game-highs of 15 kills and a .789 hitting percent
age. Juniors Ivan Perez (1 1 kills) and Russell
Holmes (12 kills) combined for 23 of BYU's 51 total
kills. Freshman Robby Stowell received game-high
honors in digs with eight on the night. As a team,
the Cougars hit 500 on the match. On Saturday
evening Stowell lead BYU with a career-high 19 kills
with five blocks while hitting .654.

next night, but you don't have any practice
time to 112 ix something you didn't do well in the
first match."
The Cardinal will be attempting to make
adjustments going into this weekend's match
es after starting the season with five straight
losses. Stanford will also need to work around
the possible absence of junior outside hitter
Jesse Meredith. Meredith injured his ankle in
last Saturday's loss to UCSB and has not prac
ticed this week.
"Jesse is not back on the court yet," Kosty
said. "We are playing that day by day."
With the junior out of the lineup, a young Car
dinal squad will get even younger. Senior
libero Brian Lindberg and junior outside hit
ter Matt Ceran are the veteran leaders on a
roster that features only four upperclassmen
alongside five freshmen and five sophomores.
Against the more experienced Cougars, that
youth will likely be both an advantage and a
disadvantage.
"I'm on both sides of the coin." Kosty said.
"There are a lot of guys who are young or are
starting for the first time and so there are a fair
amount of bright spots for us [as they im
prove). What 1 am a little disappointed with so
far is our steadiness on the court. We are a lit
tle hot and cold right now. but I can under
stand that with a young team."
Last year, top-seeded BYU swept the Car
dinal twice, and the Cougars return the top
hitter and both middle blockers from that
team and have the depth to fill vacancies at
the setter and right side hitter spots.
"They do have more playing experience
than we do," Kostv said. "Sometimes that's

just the way il goes and there's not much we
can do about it. It's an opportunity for our
guys to play with some very good players who
have been in the league for a couple of years,
if not three or four years, as starters. It's just a
great opportunity for us to go out and battle
for the win."
Ivan Perez led the BYU offense in 2006
and is second on the team in kills this year, hit
ting just over .500 through the first four
matches of the season — two wins over Cal
Baptist and back-to-back sweeps of No. 3
UCLA. Robby Stowell has a team-high 54
kills and is hitting .483. Setter Yamil Perez av
erages nearly 15 assists per game and Russell
Holmes has a team-high 17 blocks.
"BYU has got a fairly veteran team.but we
will go after it just like any other game." Kosty
said. "It's zero-zero to start with and we are
going to go out with a good solid game plan
and really try to exploit some of their weak
nesses. Every team has some weaknesses and
we need to try to exploit them as best we can.
and I really see us competing this weekend."
If Meredith cannot play, the Cardinal will
look to Ceran to lead the attack along with
freshman right side Rvan Romero. The pair
notched 25 kills apiece last weekend and com
bined for 16 digs and six blocks.
Freshman Kawika Shoji has played both
setter and outside hitter for the Cardinal — if
he hits,sophomore Miki Groppi will take over
setting duties, as he did late in the UCSB
match. Shoji dished 76 assists in two matches
last week and recorded three kills, three aces

and 11 digs.
Lindberg anchored the back row
defense with 15 digs while sopho
more middle blocker Brandon
Williams had a team-high six blocks
and freshman Garrett Werner had
five.Though it is still early in the sea
son for his inexperienced squad,
kosty is optimistic about the Cardi
nal's progress in the first few weeks.
"The biggest thing we are work
ing on is our consistency and trying
to add a little more defensive pres
sure, making that extra effort to
make one more play, to keep the
ball off the ground one more time,
to allow us that one more swing." he
said. "That's something that we are
growing with day in and day out
and we are definitely on the right
track."
The Cardinal will face the
Cougars Friday and Saturday nights
at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion and
Burnham Pavilion, respectively.
