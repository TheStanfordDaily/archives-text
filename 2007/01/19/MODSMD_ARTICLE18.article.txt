## LA 						schools visit for final homestand 
### SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 1 ranked women's swimming and div
ing team will compete in its final two home meets
of the season this Friday and Saturday when it
hosts No. 14 UCLA and No. 11 Southern Califor
nia. Saturday's meet at Avery Aquatic Center will
he the final competition at home for senior swim
mers Lauren Costella. Morgan Hentzen and De
siree Stahley and diver Cassidy Krug.
After the Cardinal's wins at Arizona and Ari
zona State last weekend, it is just three victories
away from its first perfect dual meet season since
2001-02. Victories in this weekend's meet, as well
as in the Feb. 3 competition at California, would
give Stanford a 10-0 record, tying the best season
in school history.
The Cardinal is ready to compete after last
weekend's success.
"Last weekend was a big test because we were
ranked No. 1 and Arizona was No. 2," junior
Brooke Bishop said. "We came out firing and got
everyone really going, and we will go from there
this weekend."
The Bruins and Trojans would not seem to be
as formidable opponents as the Wildcats, but they
will certainly give the Cardinal a good fight.
UCLA has a 6-1 record and comes into the meet
after a decisive 104-57 win over UC-San Diego on
Jan. 6.The Bruins are led by senior Katie Nelson,
who currently ranks No. 7 nationally in the 1650
free. UCLA will also bring top divers Sara Clark.
Amanda Blongand Marisa Samaniego. All three
have picked up NCAA Zone "E" qualifying
marks and have posted victories throughout the
season.
USC is 4-1 for the season and most recently de
feated UC Santa Barbara by a score of 149-111 at
home on Jan. 6. This season, the Trojans have
counted on sophomore Rebecca Soni to rack up
the points, which she did with wins in the 200
breaststroke and 4(H) individual medley against
the Gauchos. Soni's fellow sophomore Katy
I louston followed her closely with second-place
finishes in both events.
Although this weekend's opponents are not as
challenging as Arizona, the Cardinal must be pre
pared to step up in a wider variety of events.
"Arizona's specialty was sprinting, but both
LJSC and LJCLA have fast swimmers in a broad
range of events, and we have to be prepared for
that" Bishop said. "Last weekend, we
weren't rested or anything and we
prepared ourselves pretty well, so |
think we should be ready to go this
weekend."
Last season, the Cardinal compet
ed against the Bruins and Trojans in
Southern California. Stanford fell to
UCLA 180-120 but beat USC 158-
142. When Stanford last hosted both
schools in 2004. it defeated UCLA by
a score of 174-126 and knocked off
USC 193-103.
Stanford's home-pool advantage
could give it the boost it needs to se
cure victories this weekend.
"I love competing at Stanford
because 1 am from the area so my
family and friends can come," Bish
op said. "Lots of the girls on the
team have parents coming this
weekend because we will be travel
ing during Parents' Weekend. The
atmosphere when competing at
home is amazing."
