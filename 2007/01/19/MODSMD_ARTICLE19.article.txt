## Hoops should dance 
### 
It's hard not to take notice of the
Cardinal men's basketball team,
even after its recent three game
winning-streak was snapped last
night in Eugene, Ore.
Prior to the 66-59 loss that was
closer than the final score would in
dicate, Stanford's games against Vir
ginia. Washington and Washington
State were all the kind of gut
wrenching, grind-it-out games that
usually aren't seen until late March.
And the Cardinal won all three of
'em.
It's surprising that such a young
team — nearly all of Stanford's con
tributors are either freshmen or
sophomores — would have the com
posure to pull out the recent stretch
of close, nail-biting games. The last
second victory on the road against
Virginia (the very same team that
took down Lute Olson and his
mighty Wildcats), the comeback
against Washington in the last few
minutes and the overtime heroics
against Washington State were all
games that tested and affirmed the
mettle of this Cardinal squad.
These were the three biggest wins
of the season for Stanford — and
they all came within a week. Virginia
is a decent ACC squad which could
possibly entertain thoughts of an
NCAA tournament bid down the
road. The two Washington schools
were both ranked when they played
Stanford (although it depends on
which poll you check), and, of
course, any victory is a good victory
when it's over a ranked team.
Although the Lopez twins have
both been huge for Stanford during
the team's recent success, in my
mind, two young sophomores have
made the difference for the Cardi
nal: combo guard Anthony Goods
and combo forward Lawrence Hill.
These two sophomores have been
money when the team has needed
them the most. Hill hit the game
winning shot that came with only
nine-tenths of a second left at Vir
ginia. It may have been the shot that
saved the Cardinal's season.
Goods was also huge in the first
half against Washington, draining
shot after shot and keeping the
Huskies on their heels from the start.
1 le was cool, calm and collected at
the end when he hit the game-win
ning free throws, too.
Let's not forget Hill's perform
ance against the Huskies, though.
I (ill was a solid presence throughout
the game, as he nearly always is, col
lecting 17 points and seven boards,
but his best work came at the most
important time during the final min
utes. After stealing the ball from
Spencer Hawes, Hill's three-point

play with just over 40 seconds left in
the game put the Cardinal on top.
And. oh yeah. Goods happened
to come up big again this past Satur
day, hitting the game-winning three
pointer against a pesky Washington
State team.
Seriously, what more can these
guys do?
Hill and Goods are big-time.
They've been clutch, money or what
ever other adjective you might come
up with to describe them.
After a shaky start to the confer
ence season, the Cardinal now stand
3-3 in the Pac-10 and 11-5 overall.
The team's RPI computer ranking
has jumped too: prior to the Oregon
loss, Stanford was in the top 40 of the
poll for the first time this season.
I might be making my judgment a
little too early here, but the Cardinal
has a reasonable shot at receiving an
at-large bid to the NCAA Tourna
ment. I'm not the only one who
thinks so, either: ESPN's "bracketol
ogist," Joe Lunardi. has the Cardinal
as a 12 seed in his current projections.
I truly believe that if Stanford can
go 11-7 overall in the tough Pac-10,

the team will he dancing come
March. An 11-7 conference record
would give the Cardinal an overall
record of 19-9 going into the postsea
son. A 19-9 record with quality victo
ries over Virginia, Texas Tech, and
the Washington schools would make
us a lock for the Big Dance.
It's not going to be easy to accom
plish. The team is still young, and.
even if they have played years above
their age during crunch time, their
youth is liable to catch up to them at
any time.
But so far, despite the ugly losses
against the Air Force and Santa
Clara and last night's tough loss to
the Ducks, Stanford has put itself in a
position to make the NCAA tourna
ment.
If someone had told me that Stan
ford would be in a position to make
the tournament after its loss to Air
Force, I would have called him crazy.
Don't look now. but the Card is right
in the thick of things.
