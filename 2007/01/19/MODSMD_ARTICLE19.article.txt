It's hard not to take notice of the
Cardinal men's basketball team,
even after its recent three game
winning-streak was snapped last
night in Eugene, Ore.
Prior to the 66-59 loss that was
closer than the final score would in
dicate, Stanford's games against Vir
ginia. Washington and Washington
State were all the kind of gut
wrenching, grind-it-out games that
usually aren't seen until late March.
And the Cardinal won all three of
'em.
It's surprising that such a young
team — nearly all of Stanford's con
tributors are either freshmen or
sophomores — would have the com
posure to pull out the recent stretch
of close, nail-biting games. The last
second victory on the road against
Virginia (the very same team that
took down Lute Olson and his
mighty Wildcats), the comeback
against Washington in the last few
minutes and the overtime heroics
against Washington State were all
games that tested and affirmed the
mettle of this Cardinal squad.
These were the three biggest wins
of the season for Stanford — and
they all came within a week. Virginia
is a decent ACC squad which could
possibly entertain thoughts of an
NCAA tournament bid down the
road. The two Washington schools
were both ranked when they played
Stanford (although it depends on
which poll you check), and, of
course, any victory is a good victory
when it's over a ranked team.
Although the Lopez twins have
both been huge for Stanford during
the team's recent success, in my
mind, two young sophomores have
made the difference for the Cardi
nal: combo guard Anthony Goods
