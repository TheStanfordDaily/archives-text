## New child care facility planned Escondido center will help alleviate faculty child care crunch 
### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
The lengthy waitlist for child
care at Stanford may soon shrink,
thanks to University plans to build
a new childcare facility in Escondi
do Village.
The estimated $3.5 million
building project was approved by
the Board of Trustees last month
and, pending final approval in
April, is scheduled to open in June
2008. With 8,300 square feet of
space, two floors, seven classrooms
and outdoor play areas and room
for about 1(H) children, the facility
is intended to give priority to facul
ty, staff and graduate students
caught in the midst of the childcare
crunch.
"We've always had long waiting
lists, so that's not a new situation,"
co-executive director of Children's

Nancy Witt said."But the Universi
ty keeps plugging away trying to

According to a University press
release, a Dec. 11 presentation to

the trustees' Committee on Land
and Buildings estimated that 600
families are in line for Stanford
childcare centers, significantly
more than the 385 children using
the existing facilities. With the out
side community equally strapped
for childcare space and generally
more expensive than services of
fered by Stanford, the University's
faculty, staff and graduate students
in need of childcare are relegated
to a long waiting list.
"I think there's a huge need.and
it's great that they're building it."
said David Lummus, a graduate
student in French and Italian as
well as father to four-year-old
Aidan. Lummus sends Aidan to the
Rainbow School, but he said that
other graduate students have a
hard time finding childcare, espe
cially at an affordable price.
"There's a huge demand for rel
atively inexpensive childcare," he
said."lf the price is reasonable, the
new center will fill up in a heart
beat. One of my friends currently
pays as much in childcare as in
rent."
The current difficulty in meet
ing childcare demands can be par

options in the outside community
and by legal and logistical prob
