Ihe National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) announced Wednesday that it
will present Dr. Shanhui Fan, assistant
professor of electrical engineering,
with the annual Award for Initiatives
in Research — and with it, a $15,(XX)

Fan expressed astonishment and a
sense of fulfillment at receiving the
award, which has been presented each
year since 1981.

a recognition of the work my group

and I have completed at Stanford,
and I am very proud. I am thrilled,
just really quite amazed. I see the
