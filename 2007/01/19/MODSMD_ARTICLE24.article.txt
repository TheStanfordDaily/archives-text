### MANEESHA LIMAYE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I editors and researchers celebrated the re
lease of a new collection of sermons by Martin
Luther King Ji in a discussion in Tresidder
Memorial Hall yesterday afternoon.
Speakers discussed the relevance of King's
ideas in today's world and expressed hope that
the collection and the civil rights leader's words
would intorni readers confronting the injus
tices of the 21 st century.
The book, "Advocate of the Social Gospel,
September 1948-March 1963," is the sixth vol
ume of a projected 14 volume series, "The Pa
pers of Martin Luther King. Jr.," which con
tains previously unpublished sermons deliv
ered during the formative years of the civil
rights movement.
"1 don't think a lot of us saw the day when
that red-covered book would be sitting on the
table," said Susan Englander. associate director
of the Martin Luther King. Jr. Research and
Education Institute and one of the editors of
the new book.
She stressed that "Advocate of the Social
Gospel' is the series' first thematic volume. It
breaks with the chronology of the first five
books so that the sermons are organized in one
coherent and continuous book.
Englander expressed hope that the book's
format would give readers ;i chance to compare
sermons and note the recurrent motifs and

style of King's preaching.
I he new sermons reveal that King consid
ered himself first and foremost a minister and
professed repeatedly that his faith was the mo
tivation behind his work as a civil rights leader.
"One of the things that struck me was the
profound message of faith that Dr. King was
able to communicate to those who were work
ing on the volume, and hopefully to those of
you that will read it." Englander said.
" I he thing that fueled [King's] optimism
was ultimately that justice would prevail and
eventually civ il rights would come,"she added.
"I le knew that we could not suppress the real
it) of justice in the world. All it took was an ac
tive faith m the movement."
Rev. Troy Jackson, a contributing editor of
the volume, agreed with Lnglander's assess
ment of taitli as the wellspring of King's social
ideology.
"This volume supports the idea that the
biggest mind King depended on was the
African American church," he said. "It was his
greatest reservoir."
Despite the strength he derived from the
church. King felt ambivalent about its power,
Jackson said.
"His mission was to prevent the church
from simply becoming a rubber stamp for
whatever culture or society or political powers
need to be endorsed," he said.
I listory Prof. Clayborne Carson, director of
the King Institute and of the book's editorial
team, said that King's examination of faith re
mains relevant nearly four decades after his
death.
"The appearance of the volume comes at a
time when religion is such an integral part of

American life, ( arson said. "People are argu
ing whether the nature of faith is a pernicious
force or a positive force. The influence of these
discussions and the arrival of this volume as an
added voice in that discussion is to be certainly
taken note of."
Research for "Advocate of the Social
(iospel" began in 1998. one year after Coretta
Scott King allowed Carson to analyze a box of
her late husband's sermon notes.
The previous five volumes of the collection

are a comprehensive account of King's life
from 1929 until 1960, illustrating his develop
ment as a political leader and the basis for his
theological foundation.
Senior Aysha Pamukcu, a researcher on the
King Papers Project, said that the discussion
"crystallized what a tremendous effort went into
this volume and how much work there is to
come. As a student researcher. I only see a small
part of the process, but to see it today in such a
broad scope is rcallv humbling,"she said.
