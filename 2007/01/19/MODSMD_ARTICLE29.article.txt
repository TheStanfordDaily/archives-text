## Epic journeys, modern quests and Incubus 
### DEAN SCHAFFER INTERMISSION INCUBATOR 
To be honest, I don't venture into the
city very often. San Francisco is neither
my room nor my IHUM lecture hall, so
making the journey seems hopelessly fu
tile. But a band like Incubus playing at
the Warfield is enough to attract my at
tention. And so, I ventured out of my
Florence-Moorean hole last week to at
tend night one of Incubus's two-night
stand at the famed venue.
My journey began ordinarily enough
— I rode the Caltrain into town with two
friends, Luke and Patrick, then walked a
mile or two to the Warfield. About five
minutes after a suspicious-looking man
named Sauce tried to sell Luke and me
crack outside a nearby BART terminal
(and then gave us his phone number),
the Warfield opened its doors to a long
line of anxious fans.
My friends and I quickly secured a
spot close to the stage. We waited in an
ticipation for the opening act — Albert
Hammond Jr. Hammond is one of the
guitarists in the Strokes, and we would
be seeing his side project. All I knew
about him was that he plays his guitar ex
tremely high up on his chest, he has a big
head of curly hair, and his father was a
jazz guitarist (I think). So I didn't know
much. But, with no expectations, I wasn't
$ucprised when his side pro
ject tSied out to be some-

Hammond's main band — a bouncier,
faster, less restrained Strokes (without
the unpleasant side-effects). Definitely
enjoyable, but not particularly ground
breaking.
With Prince Albert's last tune, the
crowd waited with one thought on its
one-track. Bay Area mind: Incubus. The
audience applauded pointlessly every
time the background music went silent at
the break between songs, regardless of

whether or not road
ies were still on
stage, but I won't
protest too much.
After an excruciat
ing 40-minute wait,
and several half
hearted chants of
"In-cu-bus," the
band finally ap
peared. greeted with
deafening applause.
Let me present
you with the most
probable stream of
consciousness of the

teenage girl standing to my left: "Oooh
it's getting dark. That must mean — yes!
Incubus. And... OMG. Brandon Boyd is
soooo hot. I want to, like, marry him. Or
at least touch him. Mmmmm...."
Before the cheering and salivating of
my female acquaintance could subside,
, t the group opened with
"Quicksand" and the explo
sive "A Kiss to Send

Us Off" (the first
two songs from
their new album,
"Light
Grenades"). The
band showed they
more than de
served the crowd's
enthusiasm, most df
which was directed
toward heartthrob
frontman Boyd and
his Undeniably god
like good looks. The
group quickly segued
into hits, such as "Anna

Molly" and "Wish You
Were Here," and lesser
known tracks, such as
"Paper Shoes" and
"Have You Ever." A few
ambitious fans even
crowd-surfed; I know be
cause one gracefully fell on
his face right behind me.
But nearly the entire audi
ence seemed to know the

words to practically every song; during
"Wish You Were Here," the still really,
really, really ridiculously good-looking
Boyd stopped to laugh with pleasure as
the crowd's own rendition of the chorus
drowned his out.
But, like so many unfortunate lovers,
the performance climaxed early. After a
handful of tunes, Boyd and guitarist
Mike Einziger slowed things down a bit
with a short acoustic set which included

an interesting recon
figuration of "New
Skin" (from 1997's
"S.C. I .E.N.C.E.")
and "Pardon Me"
(from 1999's "Make
Yourself"). While
enjoyable, the
change of pace lost
much of the crowd's
intense, almost manic
fervor.
But, to their
credit. Incubus
knows how to get it
up again (metaphori-

cally. of course). Boyd took off his shirt
— to the pleasure, screams, and near-hy
perventilation of most women in the au
dience— and the group performed an
impressive, extended version of "Sick
.Sad Little World" (from 2004's "A Crow
LefK)f the Murder..."), complete with a
virtuoso solo from bassist Ben Kenney.
After the group closed with "Nowhere
Fast," the crowd was more than ready for
the obligatory encore.
The most exciting part of said encore
may have been when Boyd donned the
red dress thrown at him earlier by a
crazed fan. But the group still finished
strong with "Pendulous Threads," "Pis
tola," and, finally, "Megalomaniac."
Surprisingly, they didn't perform their
chart-topping "Drive," though I suspect
the omission was a tactic to limit the
number of girls fainting from too much
blood to the heart (and not enough to the
brain).
Luckily, the show ended in time for us
to catch the last Caltrain back to campus.
Before I knew it, I was home, and my
ears were already ringing like a bitch.
All in all. Incubus rocked. Hard.
Maybe I should get out more often.... Or
not. I've still got IHUM to deal with. But
at least I met Sauce.
Dean Schaffer still has access to Sauce 's
number through his friend Luke. If
you 're into that kind of thing, email him at
deansss@stanford.edu, and he'll hook
you up.
