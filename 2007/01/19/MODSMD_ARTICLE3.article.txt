## Compromise extends grad student GoPasses Eleventh-hour deal to fund transportation 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It had one foot in the grave.
But a last-minute compromise
struck between students and ad
ministrators at the end of autumn
quarter salvaged the controversial
GO-Pass program for off-campus
graduate students from near-cer
tain extinction â€” at least for one
more year.
Negotiations between the
Graduate Student Transportation
Board (GSTB) and the Provost re
sulted in a proposal in which the
Graduate Student Council (GSC),
the Provost's office and the deans
of the various graduate schools
would provide joint funding for the
one-time extension.

The GSC passed the proposal in
a close vote at their Dec. 6 meeting,
and GSTB members orchestrated
a letter-writing campaign soon af
terward to secure the support of
the deans. All but one dean has
committed to provide their share
of funding, and GTSB members
say they expect to have the holdout
dean commit soon.
"We think this is exactly what
we need to keep the program alive
until we get sustained funding,"
G TSB co-chair and chemistry
graduate student Aaron Fafarman
said.
The total cost of the subsidy is
over $350,000. The GSC has con
tributed $36,000, the deans $30,000
and the Provost will pick up the rest
of the cost after users pay $99 to get
a ticket.
