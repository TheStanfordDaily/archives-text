## Compromise extends grad student GoPasses Eleventh-hour deal to fund transportation 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It had one foot in the grave.
But a last-minute compromise
struck between students and ad
ministrators at the end of autumn
quarter salvaged the controversial
GO-Pass program for off-campus
graduate students from near-cer
tain extinction — at least for one
more year.
Negotiations between the
Graduate Student Transportation
Board (GSTB) and the Provost re
sulted in a proposal in which the
Graduate Student Council (GSC),
the Provost's office and the deans
of the various graduate schools
would provide joint funding for the
one-time extension.

The GSC passed the proposal in
a close vote at their Dec. 6 meeting,
and GSTB members orchestrated
a letter-writing campaign soon af
terward to secure the support of
the deans. All but one dean has
committed to provide their share
of funding, and GTSB members
say they expect to have the holdout
dean commit soon.
"We think this is exactly what
we need to keep the program alive
until we get sustained funding,"
G TSB co-chair and chemistry
graduate student Aaron Fafarman
said.
The total cost of the subsidy is
over $350,000. The GSC has con
tributed $36,000, the deans $30,000
and the Provost will pick up the rest
of the cost after users pay $99 to get
a ticket.

$36,000 subsid\ passed with eight
CiSC members in favor — the mini

But that was after it almost failed,

seemed to have lost with only seven
votes in favor and six opposed. Sud

initially voted against the subsidy,
changed her mind.
"I didn't know it was going to be
that close." said GSC member
Shireen Barday, as she signaled her
change of heart.

clear motion to re-vote and despite

cussion, when (»S I B Kristina Keat

the entire debate to be off-the
record due to details in the program
that had yet to be determined.
The co-chairs overruled Keat
ing's request, saying that all ASSU
meetings must be public.
Another gaffe occurred just mo

Jenny Allen was forced to rephrase
her motion to bring the issue to a
vote. She had initially announced the
vote was to provide reserve funds

"You can't say that." called out
(iS( member Matt Andrews. "It's
unfairly influencing the vote."
Members of the public who had
attended the meeting in hopes ot ex
pressing their opinions also com
plained about the short time they
had to speak.
"I was surprised at the lack of in
terest in student opinion." said grad
uate student Mike Cooper. "Is it al
ways like this?"
While the CiSC spent 45 minutes
explaining the new subsidy program
and answering questions from repre
sentatives. it saved less than 10 min
utes for public comment, limiting in
dividual statements to 30 seconds
and even cutting one speaker off be
fore he was finished.
In comments to The Daily. Gur
ney admitted afterwards that the
meeting was not perfectly conduct
ed.
"As ( hairs, we may not have been
as robust as we should have been."
he said, while insisting that "the will
of the body was expressed in the
end."
The general public opinion that

was expressed at the meeting was
very much in favor of the subsidy
program.
"Since my partner commutes to
Berkeley, we wouldn't be able to live
together without the GO-Pass,"
Adam Millard, a doctoral candidate
in earth sciences, told the GSC.
Others cited the GO-Pass as a
major reason that they and others had
come to Stanford in the first place.
"When students are deciding
among other schools in the metro
politan areas, having access to San
Francisco makes Stanford more
competitive." said Adam l.eising. a
doctoral student in environment and
resources.
(iS( members acknowledged the
similarities between this year's dis
cussion and last year's, when the
Council ilso voted to allocate fund
ing for the GO-Pass.
"We have been here before,"
Keating said. "But the reason that
the ballot failed last year was be
cause it was so rushed. We have more
time this year."
Another major concern for sev
eral members was the fairness of
the subsidy. Although thesubsid) is
funded by the fees paid by all grad
uate students, only those living off
campus are eligible for the pro
gram. In total, approximately 1.000
students have bought subsidized
GO-Passes. There are more than
8.000 graduate students at Stan
ford.
"It is not fair to charge the 7.000
to fund the 1.000." said Adam Be
berg.a graduate student in computer
science. Another representative
called the subsidy a "solidarity pay
ment. saying it was essentially a "net
transfer of money from on-campus
students to off-campus students."

seemed to have lost with only seven
votes in favor and six opposed. Sud

initially voted against the subsidy,
changed her mind.
"I didn't know it was going to be

Shireen Barday, as she signaled her
change of heart.
I hough there did not seem to be a
clear motion to re-vote and despite
some complaints about the ambigui

That was only one of several in

the entire debate to be off-the

The co-chairs overruled Keat

meetings must be public.

her motion to bring the issue to a

vote was to provide reserve funds

be "dead."
"You can't say that." called out
(iS( member Matt Andrews. "It's
unfairly influencing the vote."
Members of the public who had
attended the meeting in hopes ot ex
pressing their opinions also com
plained about the short time they
had to speak.
"I was surprised at the lack of in
terest in student opinion." said grad
uate student Mike Cooper. "Is it al
ways like this?"
While the CiSC spent 45 minutes
explaining the new subsidy program
and answering questions from repre
sentatives. it saved less than 10 min
utes for public comment, limiting in
dividual statements to 30 seconds
and even cutting one speaker off be
fore he was finished.
In comments to The Daily. Gur
ney admitted afterwards that the
meeting was not perfectly conduct
ed.
"As ( hairs, we may not have been
as robust as we should have been."
he said, while insisting that "the will
of the body was expressed in the
end."
The general public opinion that

was expressed at the meeting was
very much in favor of the subsidy
program.
"Since my partner commutes to
Berkeley, we wouldn't be able to live
together without the GO-Pass,"
Adam Millard, a doctoral candidate
in earth sciences, told the GSC.
Others cited the GO-Pass as a
major reason that they and others had
come to Stanford in the first place.
"When students are deciding
among other schools in the metro
politan areas, having access to San
Francisco makes Stanford more
competitive." said Adam l.eising. a
doctoral student in environment and
resources.
(iS( members acknowledged the
similarities between this year's dis
cussion and last year's, when the
Council ilso voted to allocate fund
ing for the GO-Pass.
"We have been here before,"
Keating said. "But the reason that
the ballot failed last year was be
cause it was so rushed. We have more
time this year."
Another major concern for sev
eral members was the fairness of
the subsidy. Although thesubsid) is
funded by the fees paid by all grad
uate students, only those living off
campus are eligible for the pro
gram. In total, approximately 1.000
students have bought subsidized
GO-Passes. There are more than
8.000 graduate students at Stan
ford.
"It is not fair to charge the 7.000
to fund the 1.000." said Adam Be
berg.a graduate student in computer
science. Another representative
called the subsidy a "solidarity pay
ment. saying it was essentially a "net
transfer of money from on-campus
students to off-campus students."
It had one foot in the grave.
But a last-minute compromise
struck between students and ad
ministrators at the end of autumn
quarter salvaged the controversial
GO-Pass program for off-campus
graduate students from near-cer
tain extinction — at least for one
more year.
Negotiations between the
Graduate Student Transportation
Board (GSTB) and the Provost re
sulted in a proposal in which the
Graduate Student Council (GSC),
the Provost's office and the deans
of the various graduate schools
would provide joint funding for the
one-time extension.

The GSC passed the proposal in
a close vote at their Dec. 6 meeting,
and GSTB members orchestrated
a letter-writing campaign soon af
terward to secure the support of
the deans. All but one dean has
committed to provide their share
of funding, and GTSB members
say they expect to have the holdout
dean commit soon.
