## It's cold: So go to Green and get a DUD 
### KELLY PETERSON INTERMISSION COMFORTER 
Baby, it's cold outside.
Well, actually, I guess it's not *that* cold. My friends that
go to school in New England would be laughing at me by
this point — it's not even snowing, and until Tuesday, it
hadn't even rained, but weeks like these remind me of how
much Stanford has softened me. 1 think 1 was tougher in
high school... or at least I could drive to class.
Nonetheless, what better way to celebrate the season
than watching classic winter movies, in the warmth and
comfort of your dorm room?
"Fargo"
If you can stomach the Wisconsin accent, Fargo is a bril
liant suspense-comedy directed by the Coen Brothers. It
stars William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, who hires two
men to kidnap his wife and hold her for a ransom from her
wealthy father. One accidental murder leads to another,
and Fargo's pregnant sheriff, played by Frances McDor
mand in an Oscar-winning role, gets put on the case. If all
else fails, the sheer amount of snow in Fargo should remind
you why you chose not to go to school in the colder regions
of the US.
"Bridget Jones' Diary"
This movie is worth the trek to Green Library for the
opening scene, in which Bridget Jones (played by Renee
Zelleweger) drunkenly lip-sings "All By Myself" in her
bedroom with a bottle of champagne on New Years Eve. A
modern-day version of Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prej
udice, Bridget is a size-12 thirtysomething singleton living
in London who resolves to quit smoking, lose weight and
find love. We follow her through disastrously embarrassing
trysts with her boss (Hugh Grant) and awkward encounters
with the cold and aloof family friend Mark Darcy (ironical

ly played by Colin Firth). Bridget Jones' Diary is on my list

of favorite chick flicks
of all time, but 1 don't
think you have to be a
chick to enjoy it.

The Shining
Reason #1432

not to become a
writer: you may end
up as a caretaker of an
Alaskan lodge for a
winter, go completely
insane and try to kill
your family. Of
course, most Alaskan
lodges probably don't
have ghosts and
other supernatural
phenomena that ex
acerbate the prob
lem, but that's not
the point. Jack

Nicholson is terri-

fying in this adap
tation of a Stephen King bestselling novel. 1 have yet to
actually watch this movie because I'm too scared (I

spent "The Exorcist" in my friend's armpit, and even

"The Sixth Sense" gave me nightmares), but if
you're the scary movie type, this might be

right up your alley.
"Rocky"
If you haven't seen the original, this
should be high on your list of priorities.
It's not just a movie about an underdog
or a fight; it's a love story, it's an inspi-

ration and if nothing else, it won Best Picture in the 1976
Oscars. "Rocky" stars Sylvester Stallone as a struggling
Philadelphia boxer who gets the chance of a lifetime when
he is chosen to go up against the world heavyweight cham
pion Apollo Creed (as a publicity stunt, though Rocky
doesn't care). You'll feel sympathy chills as he gets up at 4


A.M. in the dead of winter to train, unless you're a Stanford athlete and ac
tually get to experience this a regular basis.
"The Holiday''
Oh. you wanted to take advantage of the new Movie Express and actually
go see a movie? I know, it's another chick flick — and actually this particu
lar chick Hick is rather heavy on the estrogen — but as guilty pleasures go,
this one is rather enjoyable. Kate Winslct plays the pathetic, frumpy Eng
lish woman whose "one true love" has just gotten engaged to someone else.
Cameron Diaz is the successful Hollywood producer who wants to escape
men after being cheated on. They decide to swap houses tor the holiday.
1 Throw in Judc Law and Jack Black and you've got yourself a really pre
dictable romantic comedy... which is also really cute...
"Hack to Back to Back to the Future"
This trilogy has nothing to do with winter, but if you're settling down to hi
bernate for the weekend, it might be the perfect companion. It's a little
cheesv, but you can't help but love Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly as he
travels through time with the loony Doc, played by Christopher Lloyd. I
wish DeLoreans were still around.
Many of you are heading up to Tahoe this weekend lor ski trip, and 1
wish you the best of times. You'll probably come home with better stories
than me, but I promise, I'll be warmer.
