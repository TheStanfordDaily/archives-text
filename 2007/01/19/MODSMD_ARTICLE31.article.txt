# Movies more wintery than your last trek to THUM
## 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION FLICK MAGNET 
If you're looking to stay indoors this week
end and avoid the low winter temperatures,
check out this list of movies that feature some
very, very cold weather.
"Beautiful Girls"
Plot: Willie (Timothy Hutton) returns to his
New England hometown for a ten-year high
school reunion and finds that little has changed
in his classmates' lives.
Lowdown: Ted Demme's sweet, sincere movie
about 30-year-olds who don't recognize how
lucky they are was unfairly overlooked upon
release. Similar in tone and content to last
year's "Last Kiss" hut lighter and more enter
taining. Film's highlights include its cast of
beautiful women (Uma Thurman, Lauren
Holly and Mira Sorvino) and a wonderful per
formance by Natalie Portman as a precocious
13-year-old girl who captures Willie's heart.
Trivia: Screen writer Scott Rosenberg decided
to write the movie's script while waiting in

Boston for his script for "Con Air" to be ac
cepted. "It was the worst winter ever in this
small hometown. Snow plows were coming by.
and 1 was just tired of writing these movies with
people getting shot and killed. So 1 said, 'There
is more action going on in my hometown with
my friends dealing with the fact that they can't
deal with turning 30 or with commitment' —
all that became "Beautiful Girls.' "
"The Shining"
Plot: A writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family
become the winter caretakers of an isolated
hotel in the mountains of Colorado. The writer
slowly slides into insanity as a result of cabin
fever and the hotel's ghosts who convince him
to "correct" his family.
Lowdown: Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of
Stephen King's horror novel is considered by
many to be one of the scariest films ever made.
Though full of disturbing images, its length and
sometimes languid pace detract from the pro
ceedings. Nicholson's over-the-top perfor
mance is fun to watch but seems out of place at
times, possibly better suited to a "Batman" se

quel.
Trivia: King notoriously disliked Kubrick's
movie claiming that important themes from
the novel, including the disintegration of the
the family and the perils of alcoholism, were
overlooked. Additionally, the author believed
the hotel's ghosts were the real cause of the
protagonist's insanity, not cabin lever. King su
pervised a television remake in 1997 that was
more to his liking.
"Groundhog Day"
Plot: While covering the annual Groundhog
Day festivities in Punxsutawney, Penn., Pitts
burgh weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray)
becomes trapped in a strange time loop that
forces him to re- live the same Groundhog Day
over and over again.
Lowdown: One of the most endearing come
dies ever made, "Groundhog Day" milks its
clever premise for maximum comic effect but
still manages to provide warmer, quieter mo
ments making it a real delight. As the lovable

grump who discovers how enriching it can be to
help others, Murray delivers one of his most
memorable performances.
Trivia: In another draft of the script, an ex
plicit reason for the time loop was given — a
voodoo spell cast by a female coworker at
Phil's television station whom he had reject
ed.
"The Thing"
Plot: An American scientific expedition to
Antarctica is interrupted by the emergence of a
parasitic alien that can perfectly imitate its vic
tims. Unsure of who has become assimilated,
members of the research output soon become
consumed by paranoia and threaten to turn on
each other.
Lowdown: John Carpenter's gory remake of
Howard Hawks 1951 "The Thing from Anoth
er World" has little in the way of character de
velopment or subtlety. Has become something
of a cult hit after its critical and commercial fail
ure at the box office. Mainly for horror fans
who want to know what it looks like when a vie

tim's stomach suddenly morphs into a guillo
tine that severs another victim's hands.
Trivia: John Carpenter and Kuri Russell (who
plays the film's lead) both admit that after all
of these years they still do not know who has
been replaced by the alien and when.
"The Day After Tomorrow"
Plot: Global warming causes world wide disas
ters and leads to an abrupt ice age. Climatolo
gist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) sets out from
Washington D. C. to rescue his son who is
trapped in New York.
Lowdown: Once again German director Hol
land Emmerich ("Independence Day"and
"Godzilla") combines a series of over-the-top
action set- pieces, paper-thin characters and
actors barely capable of these characteriza
tions. Although the premise and writing are
both ludicrous, the movie remains entertain
ing due to the equally ludicrous scale of its ac
tion scenes.
Trivia: Emmerich admits that while the events
portraed in the film are possible, the time
frame over which they occur was dramatically
"tailored" for entertainment value. Environ
mental activist George Monbiot called "The
Day After Tomorrow" "a great movie and
lousv science."
