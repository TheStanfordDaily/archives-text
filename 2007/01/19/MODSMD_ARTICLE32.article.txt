## You'll feel it in your fingers... and your toes 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN INTERMISSION LOVER ACTUALLY 
"Love Actually" is, in two words, irresistibly
charming. With 1 high Grant and lots of British
accents and a little boy whom I originally mis-

took to be a girl, you cannot help but be won
over. 1 loved it.
But let's take a look see here at how all of this
came about.
To begin. 1 love a good chick flick. Deep
down. ever>' girl does. There's no use in denying
it. There's just something about love-in-the
making, tragic near loss and a happy ending that
gets you every time. And what could beat going
through an entire box of tissues only to be re
lieved by a pleasant sense of romantic elation at

the end? Doing it with a willing hoy (or girl).
It was another late night at my boyfriend's
house, and, the sex having already been had and
the sleepy not yet setting in, we were in need of
something to do. I thumbed quickly through his
L)VI) collection: "Jackass," "Spiderman 2,"

"Fight Club,"
"Old School"
a couple of
National
Lamp o on
movies,
"Blow, "
"Love Aclu
allv" - . '^P!
"Whoa whoa
whoa whoa
whoa. You ac
tually OWN
Love Actual
ly?"
"It's a good
movie!"

1 blinked at him. "You actually OWN 'Love Ac
tually'"?
"Shut up!" He snatched the DVD from me, un
mistakably blushing.
"I've never seen it." I smiled coyly. "Can we
watch it?"
And next thing 1 know we're curled up under a

blanket, "Love Actually" in the DVD player.
Any movie thai begins with Billy Mack,
played by Bill Nighy, cursing in sheer frustration
at his half-ass attempt to save his career with a
Christmas album is automatically a favorite of
mine, but I stuck around to watch the rest. And
J watched, admittedly a tad confused but wholly
and utterly transfixed on the nine intertwining,
overlapping love stories unfolding before me.
To name a few: the Prime Minister of England,
played by the oh-so-beautiful Hugh Grant, falls
in love with his housekeeper. Mark, played by
Andrew Lincoln, falls in love with his best
friend's wife, played by Keira knightley. Hairy,
Alan Rickman, falls in love with his seductive
but unattractive secretary, unbeknownst to his
wife. It was a bit

o! a task to keep
nine love stories
on hand, but with
the help of an
amazingly well
written script, a
bunch of excel
lent actors and a
boyfriend who
kept reminding
me which British
guy was which, 1
did quite well.
Are there
happy endings?
Of course there
are. But they are
not all "happy"
in the sort of con-

ventional sense of happy, with the girl walking
off and the guy running to stop her and their
kissing, finally, amidst a crowd of people or tire
works or something of that sort. They are
"happy" in that everyone, one way or another,
finds love.
Or, put much more eloquently by Hugh
Grant: "General opinion's starting to make out
that we live in a world of hatred and greed, hut I
don't see that. It seems to me that love is every
where. Often it's not particularly dignified or
newsworthy, hut it's always there — fathers and
sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and
wives.bovfricnds, girlfriends, old friends...ll you
look for it. I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find
that love actually is all around."
