# BLAHBLAHBLAH Babel... it's good

### SAMUEL FRANCO INTERMISSION BABBLER 
"Babel" was just given the Golden Globe
for Best Picture (that Imitated "Crash").
Frankly, this is a tremendously disappointing
moment lor people who dislike being preached
to. "Babel" is nothing but what it's title says,
meaningless babble, attempting to make a
sweeping ovcrgencralization of the entire
world. Frankly, if you wanted to do that, you
fcould just spend all day throwing out stereo
types and linking them together. I'd prefer to
just think about who would win if a Great
Shark and a Man got into a fight, and the man
had a spear. The title "Babel" itself is ridicu
lous. comparing itself to a biblical story. If
you're going to go biblical, then at least put
korne scantily clad folks in fig leaves.
The niosl irritating thing about "Babel" is
Jiow it makes an attempt to define the world for
the viewer. Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu it, not

an authority on world culture,
and claiming to be so is a new
hallmark of pretension. One
man with a carefully construct
ed image for himself cannot be
"universally acclaimed," if his sup
port base comes from nothing more
than a similar minded group of peo
ple who've declared themselves
important enough to regulate the
tastes of an entire nation.
In this film, these know it alls
desperately try and shape your
opinion for you on immigra
tion, the US & Islam, and other
such "earth shaking" topic.
"Crash" and "Babel" were just
generalizations about generaliza
tions. Ironic isn't it? Filmmakers
claiming your pre-standing per
ceptions to be incorrect, yet try
ing to replace yours with "the

correct version." What is
worse, is that there was
very Utile in the movie that
actually imitated life, de
spite its claims. How exact
ly does an angsty, sex
starved, deaf girl in Japan
relate to the killing of an
American in Morocco? It
relates just as much as
venomous hedgehogs
and the writing of O'
Canada.
Perhaps the most
irritating part of ln
naritu is that he is
unaccepting of
opinion to the point
where he fired his
screenwriter, Guiller
mo Arriaga, and
banned him from the

initial screening. If a director is to ban a writer,
the man who wrote the film for him. the man
who decided which words were coming out of
the mouths of the actors, from a screening, the
writer better be some sort of genocidal-child
pornographer hybrid. Instead, he choked out
his partner, after having taken his work, and
essentially declared him unfit to be associated
with. Who knows, maybe Guillermo Arriaga
had a habit of trying to force used KFC drum
sticks through the actors' skin. But to cut him
off is to completely deprive a person who
helped is utter backstabbing.
The last two years, generalist films like
"Crash" and "Babel" have cleaned up during
awards season, and wooed that cud-chewing
Cannes crowd. Thank goodness neither of
these films have penetrated the imdb top 100.
for the sake of film itself. Instead, those spots
are left to films that do all the wonderful things,
like Bullseyeing Womprats in your T-16 back
home.
