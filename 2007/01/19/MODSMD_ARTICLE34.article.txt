### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION SEBASTIAN ANDREW HUNG INTERMISSION PRINCE 
It's the end of January. You are freezing. You are tired. And you are probably suffering from some
variation of the cold. Our remedy? Five different playlists to warm your chills, cool your fever or
just plain distract you. So stick them earbuds in, cough back a little Nyquil and enjoy.

To Tear Your Heart Out:
Seven Gut-Wrenching Moments in Seven
Gut-Wrenching Songs
1. Hallelujah, by Jeff Buckley, off the album
Grace.
Featuring only Jeff Buckley on an electric
guitar, the lush emotional content of Hal
lelujah is even more remarkable in the sim
plicity of its instrumentation. The end of
every verse is a genuine climax, with the as
cending chords and melody cascading into
another emphatic "hallelujah."
Defining Moment: The almost impromptu
sounding outburst into one last coda of hal
lelujahs after the last chorus (at 5:57).
2. The Blower's Daughter, by Damien Rice,
off the album O
Damien Rice uses pretty much every trick in
the book to seize our emotions. The ascend
ing chord progression; the voice switch to a
higher register; the pressingly catchy repeat
ed line in the chorus; the meandering strings
in the background; the key shift in the
bridge. And it toys with us beautifully.
Defining Moment: The second verse: "The
colder water/the blower's daughter/the
pupil in denial." You can almost hear the
tears falling in the background.
3. Touch, Feel, Lose, by Ryan Adams, off
the album Gold
Drawing from blues and gospel influences,
Ryan Adams enlists the help of an electric
organ and a backing vocal line to craft this
doleful ballad of heartbreak. Despite his
reputation for often being a belligerent
drunkard on stage, concert footage (on
You Tube) testifies to how charged up this
song (and Ryan Adams) can be.
Defining Moment: The lyrics to the chorus
should say it all: "Cry, cry cry."
4. Sometimes Salvation, by The Black
Crowes, off the album The Southern Har
mony and Musical Companion
The guts of this ballsy blues ballad are forti
fied with distorted guitars and a dominant
drumbeat. On top of it all, singer Chris
Robinson, certainly no stranger to ripping
his voice up on the high notes, belts out his

tortured yet powerful wail as if every bass
drum kick were delivered straight into the
stomach. They might as well be; we can feel
it.
Defining Moment: Guitarist Marc Ford slip
ping in and out of bends and virtually having
to rip notes off the fretboard in the fuzzed
oyt guitar solo.
5. Bones, by Radiohead, off the album The
Bends
A lesser known gem of Radiohead's, this
ode to singer Thom Yorke's fear of physical
pain and mental anguish features a little
trick that drives our emotions up; because
the chorus chord progression never returns
to the tonic, there is just buildup after
buildup, until the pressure is released in a
passionate rush'after the second chorus.
Defining Moment: The release is still thick
with lament and regret: "I used to fly like
peter pan/all the children flew when they
touched my hand."
6. Purple Rain, by Prince, off the album Pur
ple Rain
Every other power ballad in the 80s had the
same elements: cheesy electronic instru
mentation, high, high voices, wailing guitar
solos, and a more than healthy does of re
verb. However, with every lyric Prince con
veys such a tone of desperation, this ballad
actually delivers the full emotional content
that the epic arrangement calls for.
Defining Moment: The screeching transi
tion into the third verse: "Honey, I know, 1
know, 1 know times are changing." Oh so
desperate.
7. Stockholm Syndrome, by Muse, off the
album Absolution
This feverish anthem injects us with an
adrenaline dose of frenzied drums and reck
less guitar and levitates us towards the brink
with buildups dripping with diminished har
mony and the harmonic minor scale, before
hitting us with a massive wall of agony. Be
hind the in-your-face instrumentation, the
tinge of sorrow in the /voice is still identifi
able.
Defining Moment: When the high, full vocal
harmonies strike in the last two choruses:
"This is the last time I'll abandon you/and
this is the last time I'll forget you/I wish I
could."

"Cold December" — Matt Costa
This one has all the essentials of a good
winter song; it's infectious, overtly posi
tive, and appropriately themed.
"Winter Wooksie" — Belle & Sebastian
A warm comforter in song form?
"Little Yellow Spider" — Devendra Banhart
Goddamned cold is right. If you can make
bverarching sense of these lyrics, then
congratulations.
"Everything In Its Right Place" —Radiohead
Maybe it's the cover of Kid A that seems
to give the whole album a colder edge.
"Baby, It's Cold Outside" — Leon Red
bone ft. Zooey Deschanel
If the irony between the nice tone of this
song and its apparent subject matter
(namely sexual predation) isn't enough,
the fact that it's from Elf should be
enough to melt even the coldest heart.
"Strings That Tie to You" — Jon Brion
Good for my favorite winter pastime,
namely pretending I'm in a really de
pressing part of a movie.
"What Can I Do?" — The Rosebuds ~"
Not only can you use those first six notes
as a little entrance theme for yourself.

This one is also good for driving through
big dirty puddles in the street.
"Diamond Meadows" — T-Rex
Yeeees. This song is filthy.
"Snow Owl" — The Mountain Goats
The Goats come to SF in March!
"Mushaboom" — Feist
Winter feels like a more maternal season.
"Winter Song" — Nico
Her accent is so hot.
"Manhattan Skyline" — Kings of Conve
nience
Saturday morning, and it's raining.
"Natural's Not In It" — Gang of Four
Let them eat cake!
"Vans" — The Pack
MTV airs a version of this song, but the
edit out the word "vans." I guess Viacom
and Vans have beef or something. Got my
on!
"How It Should Be" — Ben Kweller
Groovy, fresh-faced, vaguely rube-esque,
post-indie?
So, be it by limewire or more legal means
get these songs onto a play list and dance
wildly around your room.
