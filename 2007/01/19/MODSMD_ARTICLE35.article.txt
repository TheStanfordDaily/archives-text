### NATALIE JABBAR INTERMISSION BEATNIK CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION AUSSIE CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION HARANGUER 
1. What we should all be doing: "I'll Follow the Sun" — The Beatles, Beatles for Sale
2. When wearing a scarf, beanie and 3 extra layers gets really, really old: "I Am Over It" — I'he
Dandy Warhols, Welcome to the Monkey I louse
3. II you are in love and therefore enjoy the extra excuse to cuddle...or want to fester in your
loneliness: "I've (Jot My Love to Keep Me Warm" — Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong,
Ella and Louis Again
4. Because sleep + sun=happiness: "Asleep on a Sunbeam" — Belle & Sebastian, Dear Cata
strophe Waitress.
5. Wishful thinking on a frigid, rainy day: If only we were still in kindergarten: "Opposite Day"
Andrew Bird. Andrew Bird &. The Mysterious Production of Eggs
6. Pretend you go to school in New England and that it's actually cold: And yes this is by the same
people who sang "Stacy's Mom." Don't knock it 'til you hear it. "Valley Winter Song" — Foun
tains of Wayne, Welcome Interstate Managers.
7. If you associate with this song, you might have Seasonal Affective Disorder: "Sunshine on my
Shoulders" — John I Denver, Voices of America
h S. It's like spring break with two quirky Norwegian dudes: "Cayman Islands" — Kings of Con
f venience. Riot on An Empty Street
9. A fun reminder of how much worse our winters could be: "Blizzard of 'IT' — Nada Surf, Let
Go.
10. Remember the disgustingly hot and humid Bth month of the year? You want it back now,
don't you?: "August" — Rilo Kiley, Take Offs and Landings
1 1.1 low could running away with Rivers Cuomo not warm your heart? I lip hip: "Island in the
Sun" — Weezer, Green Album
12. And because it's always good to end on an optimistic note: "Here Comes the Sun" — The
Beatles, Abbey Road

The "More reading? For reals?" Mix. Songs that help you zone out, re
focus, and make the monumental work seem doable.
"Fidelity"-— Regina Spektor
Hands down the best song 0f2006. Regina Spektor's voice is unforgettable
and pierces the heart. "Fidelity" holds up to repeated listenings because
the clever lyrics and upbeat music are more complex than the seemingly
simple pop song it appears as at first glance. The song breaks your heart a
little.
"Breathe Me (Four Tet Remix)" — Sia
Remixes are difficult and often cliche; this one is brilliant, however.
"Breathe Me" is haunting and gorgeous, due to Sia's silky voice-but the
remix manages to bring the song to a completely new level, turning the
strings into synthesizers while maintaining the beauty of the original.
"California" — Mates of State
Just when it seemed the O.C. could do no right. Josh Schwartz releases the
O.C. Mix 6, a cd of covers. Mates of State take an iconic song and offer a
subdued version that makes the song feel more personal and less commer
cial.
"Star Mile" — Joshua Radin
Joshua Radin's voice softly breaks your heart. This is the most emo-with
out actually being emo-song on the list. Pure poetry in song form.
"The Crane Wife #3" — The Decemberists
While "O, Valencia" received all of the press from The Decemberists new
album, "The Crane Wife" trilogy deserves the recognition. Number three
takes the cake, for its elegance-something rarely seen in Decemberists'
songs. It is one of their most effortless and poignant songs.
"Mushaboom (Postal Service Remix)" — Feist
Who could possibly take upon themselves the task of remixing an impossi
bly bubbly song? Why the Postal Service, of course-no strangers to upbeat
tracks. The result is an interesting blend between pop and electronica that
has the Postal Service stamped all over it, while still retaining the spirit of
Feist's original.
"Nadia" — Jeff Beck /
Trying to sell instrumental music as pop is difficult, but Jeff Beck is a gui
tar god and a living legend. "Nadia" is funky. Middle Eastern, modern, and
soulful. It transports you to a different time and place.

"Thursday" — Asobi Seksu
The title of their album is "Citrus," a fitting umbrella to a set of songs that
are light, airy, refreshing, yet surprisingly tart. "Thursday" is no exception,
and the melody is addicting.
"Calm Down" — Psapp
Electronica at its best. The beats are more likely to put you into a trance
than make you feel iike you're stuck in a pounding vortex of pain (aka a
rave). Strangely enough, it is quite calming to listen to. Psapp are inventive
and quirky.
"Hands Open" — Snow Patrol
Forget "Chasing Cars"; "Hands Open" is Snow Patrol's best song. There is
nothing radically different here, but the lyrics tug at the heartstrings, and
the driving beat will get your feet tapping.
"I Know I Know I Know" — Tegan and Sara
The perfect "we're broken up/but not/but 1 love you/but we're over song."
Tegan and Sara have an uncanny ability to capture myriad emotions at
once lyrically, vocally and musically-a difficult combination to get right.
"Rough Gem" — Islands
Listen to this one for the music. If you don't actually listen to the lyrics, it is
a cheery tune with a purpose. Then you realize it's about mining diamonds.
"Conceived" — Beth Orton
Beth Orton is often presumptuous and long-winded, but "Conceived" is a
masterpiece with powerful vocals and a fragile melody that captures your
attention and doesn't let go.
"In The Sun" — Joseph Arthur
One of Joseph Arthur's most positive songs, "In The Sun" is captivating.
This man knows how to begin a song; the first 90 seconds are brilliant.
"Junior Kickstart" — The Go! Team
Whether or not it was intentional, "The Price is Right's" theme song is sam
pled partway through the song. That alone makes this superb track worth
listening to. The Go! Team are masterful song crafters.
"Here (In Your Arms)" — Hellogoodbye
Hellogoodbye understand and utilize the best part of the 80's synthesizer
with sweet lyrics to make a catchy pop song that isn't afraid to build upon
itself.
"Gyroscope" — The Dismemberment Plan
"Gyroscope" is a frenetic song. Lyrically its brilliant, but the driving guitar
riff barely lets you pause long enough to listen. It is a more emotional song
than The Dismemberment Plan usually pen, but it doesn't lose its edge.
"Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl" — Broken Social Scene
The lyrics make absolutely no sense, but that's okay. You can barely un
derstand them anyway, and it's part of the song's charm. "Anthems" is a
quiet song that constantly promises to take-offe, but never does, yet is in-

I've been asked to compile a list of "winter worthy" music, something that will warm your heart while it's cold outside. But
those reading this consider 50 degrees and sunny to be cold. Try spending a winter in Vermont, where the temperatures get
below -30 degrees. You sissies. So put on the oversized wool hat, the fingerless gloves and listen to these songs that make you
forget about your tan, the skirt you're wearing, or the fact that you have no idea what frostbite is.
"Come Cover Me" — Nightwish: If you are feeling epic, nothing is better than some Nightwish. What's better than Finnish
power metal with an operatically trained female lead? While normally this is music that plundering warlords can go to war
with, this is more of the "lion in winter" type of song.
"A Winter's Tale" — A.F.1.: While winter is pretty standard fare for angst ridden outfits like A.F.I, they boast an abundance
of wintry imagery that could make this list. I like this one because of the obvious Shakespearean reference and it's not as over
produced as their modern stuff. They talk about "breath materializing" which is a scientific phenomena that none of you will
ever witness.
"Your Ex-Lover is Dead" — The Stars: This song has everything: violins, harmonica, dual vocalists, pensive lyrics and one of
the best introductions of a female lead on an album ever. Heartbreak in winter. Rain. Driving. Oh my lord I'm sad just writ
ing this.
"Cold December" — Matt Costa: One of those singer/songwriter guys with a semi-whiny, earnest little voice. Higher pitched
Van Morrissey comes to mind. With this song, you can imagine Costa in his scarf and a ski sweater playing guitar by the fire
place. Though, it'll be pretty crowded there with Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz, John Mayer and a hundred other sensitive guitar
I heartthrobs.
"Soldier" — The Slackers: Travel in a snow blanketed city at night and this song is good for hopping between pubs. Compared
to their horn laden ska beats, this is a more meditative, striped-down song with a dash of piano.
"Cold December Nights" — Boyz II Men: Now is the winter of our discount rack. They did an entire Christmas album. But,
honestly, I love them all seasons of the year.
"Frozen Orange" — David Kilgour: Jack Frost can be a complete asshole sometimes. You gotta feel for the produce farmers
of California right now, because their crops are turning into sherbet really quickly.
"Early Winter" — Gwen Stefani:You forget that when she's not talking about bananas or dancing or attempting to rap, Gwen
Stefani is really good looking. Oh, and not a bad singer too.
"Grace Cathedral Hill" — The Decemberists: I'd like to make the argument that the Decemberists, beyond the name, are re
ally good to listen to during the winter months. This one makes San Francisco into a ghost town of candles and cold.
"Settle for Satin" — Alkaline Trio: These death-obsessed pop-punks let you imagine what it would be like if you got kicked
out of bed and into the snow. And then, beaten with a snow shovel by your ex.
"Holiday in Cambodia" — Richard Cheese: It's not really a Christmas song, and he really didn't write it (thank you Dead
Kennedys) so it makes the list. Cheese's Bing Crosby-like crooning voice, lounge-singing style and jingle bells makes this a
winter favorite. It'll melt even Pol Pot's heart.
"Hands Away" — Interpol: Paul Banks, Interpol's vocalist, reminds me of a gothic version of R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe. He's
got this monotone voice and every song sounds big and empty. This one in particular is something that won't make you want
to go outside but instead shave your head and rock yourself back and forth on a couch.

The "More reading? For reals?" Mix. Songs that help you zone out, re
focus, and make the monumental work seem doable.
"Fidelity"-— Regina Spektor
Hands down the best song 0f2006. Regina Spektor's voice is unforgettable
and pierces the heart. "Fidelity" holds up to repeated listenings because
the clever lyrics and upbeat music are more complex than the seemingly
simple pop song it appears as at first glance. The song breaks your heart a
little.
"Breathe Me (Four Tet Remix)" — Sia
Remixes are difficult and often cliche; this one is brilliant, however.
"Breathe Me" is haunting and gorgeous, due to Sia's silky voice-but the
remix manages to bring the song to a completely new level, turning the
strings into synthesizers while maintaining the beauty of the original.
"California" — Mates of State
Just when it seemed the O.C. could do no right. Josh Schwartz releases the
O.C. Mix 6, a cd of covers. Mates of State take an iconic song and offer a
subdued version that makes the song feel more personal and less commer
cial.
"Star Mile" — Joshua Radin
Joshua Radin's voice softly breaks your heart. This is the most emo-with
out actually being emo-song on the list. Pure poetry in song form.
"The Crane Wife #3" — The Decemberists
While "O, Valencia" received all of the press from The Decemberists new
album, "The Crane Wife" trilogy deserves the recognition. Number three
takes the cake, for its elegance-something rarely seen in Decemberists'
songs. It is one of their most effortless and poignant songs.
"Mushaboom (Postal Service Remix)" — Feist
Who could possibly take upon themselves the task of remixing an impossi
bly bubbly song? Why the Postal Service, of course-no strangers to upbeat
tracks. The result is an interesting blend between pop and electronica that
has the Postal Service stamped all over it, while still retaining the spirit of
Feist's original.
"Nadia" — Jeff Beck /
Trying to sell instrumental music as pop is difficult, but Jeff Beck is a gui
tar god and a living legend. "Nadia" is funky. Middle Eastern, modern, and
soulful. It transports you to a different time and place.

"Thursday" — Asobi Seksu
The title of their album is "Citrus," a fitting umbrella to a set of songs that
are light, airy, refreshing, yet surprisingly tart. "Thursday" is no exception,
and the melody is addicting.
"Calm Down" — Psapp
Electronica at its best. The beats are more likely to put you into a trance
than make you feel iike you're stuck in a pounding vortex of pain (aka a
rave). Strangely enough, it is quite calming to listen to. Psapp are inventive
and quirky.
"Hands Open" — Snow Patrol
Forget "Chasing Cars"; "Hands Open" is Snow Patrol's best song. There is
nothing radically different here, but the lyrics tug at the heartstrings, and
the driving beat will get your feet tapping.
"I Know I Know I Know" — Tegan and Sara
The perfect "we're broken up/but not/but 1 love you/but we're over song."
Tegan and Sara have an uncanny ability to capture myriad emotions at
once lyrically, vocally and musically-a difficult combination to get right.
"Rough Gem" — Islands
Listen to this one for the music. If you don't actually listen to the lyrics, it is
a cheery tune with a purpose. Then you realize it's about mining diamonds.
"Conceived" — Beth Orton
Beth Orton is often presumptuous and long-winded, but "Conceived" is a
masterpiece with powerful vocals and a fragile melody that captures your
attention and doesn't let go.
"In The Sun" — Joseph Arthur
One of Joseph Arthur's most positive songs, "In The Sun" is captivating.
This man knows how to begin a song; the first 90 seconds are brilliant.
"Junior Kickstart" — The Go! Team
Whether or not it was intentional, "The Price is Right's" theme song is sam
pled partway through the song. That alone makes this superb track worth
listening to. The Go! Team are masterful song crafters.
"Here (In Your Arms)" — Hellogoodbye
Hellogoodbye understand and utilize the best part of the 80's synthesizer
with sweet lyrics to make a catchy pop song that isn't afraid to build upon
itself.
"Gyroscope" — The Dismemberment Plan
"Gyroscope" is a frenetic song. Lyrically its brilliant, but the driving guitar
riff barely lets you pause long enough to listen. It is a more emotional song
than The Dismemberment Plan usually pen, but it doesn't lose its edge.
"Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl" — Broken Social Scene
The lyrics make absolutely no sense, but that's okay. You can barely un
derstand them anyway, and it's part of the song's charm. "Anthems" is a
quiet song that constantly promises to take-offe, but never does, yet is in-

I've been asked to compile a list of "winter worthy" music, something that will warm your heart while it's cold outside. But
those reading this consider 50 degrees and sunny to be cold. Try spending a winter in Vermont, where the temperatures get
below -30 degrees. You sissies. So put on the oversized wool hat, the fingerless gloves and listen to these songs that make you
forget about your tan, the skirt you're wearing, or the fact that you have no idea what frostbite is.
"Come Cover Me" — Nightwish: If you are feeling epic, nothing is better than some Nightwish. What's better than Finnish
power metal with an operatically trained female lead? While normally this is music that plundering warlords can go to war
with, this is more of the "lion in winter" type of song.
"A Winter's Tale" — A.F.1.: While winter is pretty standard fare for angst ridden outfits like A.F.I, they boast an abundance
of wintry imagery that could make this list. I like this one because of the obvious Shakespearean reference and it's not as over
produced as their modern stuff. They talk about "breath materializing" which is a scientific phenomena that none of you will
ever witness.
"Your Ex-Lover is Dead" — The Stars: This song has everything: violins, harmonica, dual vocalists, pensive lyrics and one of
the best introductions of a female lead on an album ever. Heartbreak in winter. Rain. Driving. Oh my lord I'm sad just writ
ing this.
"Cold December" — Matt Costa: One of those singer/songwriter guys with a semi-whiny, earnest little voice. Higher pitched
Van Morrissey comes to mind. With this song, you can imagine Costa in his scarf and a ski sweater playing guitar by the fire
place. Though, it'll be pretty crowded there with Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz, John Mayer and a hundred other sensitive guitar
I heartthrobs.
"Soldier" — The Slackers: Travel in a snow blanketed city at night and this song is good for hopping between pubs. Compared
to their horn laden ska beats, this is a more meditative, striped-down song with a dash of piano.
"Cold December Nights" — Boyz II Men: Now is the winter of our discount rack. They did an entire Christmas album. But,
honestly, I love them all seasons of the year.
"Frozen Orange" — David Kilgour: Jack Frost can be a complete asshole sometimes. You gotta feel for the produce farmers
of California right now, because their crops are turning into sherbet really quickly.
"Early Winter" — Gwen Stefani:You forget that when she's not talking about bananas or dancing or attempting to rap, Gwen
Stefani is really good looking. Oh, and not a bad singer too.
"Grace Cathedral Hill" — The Decemberists: I'd like to make the argument that the Decemberists, beyond the name, are re
ally good to listen to during the winter months. This one makes San Francisco into a ghost town of candles and cold.
"Settle for Satin" — Alkaline Trio: These death-obsessed pop-punks let you imagine what it would be like if you got kicked
out of bed and into the snow. And then, beaten with a snow shovel by your ex.
"Holiday in Cambodia" — Richard Cheese: It's not really a Christmas song, and he really didn't write it (thank you Dead
Kennedys) so it makes the list. Cheese's Bing Crosby-like crooning voice, lounge-singing style and jingle bells makes this a
winter favorite. It'll melt even Pol Pot's heart.
"Hands Away" — Interpol: Paul Banks, Interpol's vocalist, reminds me of a gothic version of R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe. He's
got this monotone voice and every song sounds big and empty. This one in particular is something that won't make you want
to go outside but instead shave your head and rock yourself back and forth on a couch.
1. What we should all be doing: "I'll Follow the Sun" — The Beatles, Beatles for Sale
2. When wearing a scarf, beanie and 3 extra layers gets really, really old: "I Am Over It" — I'he
