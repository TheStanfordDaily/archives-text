## Thaiphoon: Don't be a loon, eat there soon 
### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION COKE DRINKER 
The fried banana with coconut ice cream dessert
at the Pan-Asian restaurant, Thaiphoon, is amazing.
So amazing, in fact, that I cannot talk about the rest
of the restaurant before I give the dessert the praise it
deserves. Consisting of two banana halves surround
ed by a crispy egg roll-like wrapping and two scoops
of coconut ice cream, it is perfect for sharing. To be
honest, as 1 have never tried fried fruit before, I was
wary of what it would taste like. However, I have to
say that that banana was the best banana 1 have ever
had. Even though the coconut ice cream was not as
sweet as ! would have hoped it to be, it definitely
worked well with the warm bananas: it reminded me

of a Thai ver
sion of warm apple pie and golden vanilla ice cream.
Trust mc, if you decide to try out Thaiphoon, you will
regret not saving enough room for this dessert.
Now that I have gotten that out of my system. 1 can
now talk about the rest of the restaurant. Recently
opened in 2005, Thaiphoon is conveniently located
just off of University Avenue (on Emerson Street)
and is an uniquely-decorated, casual place to go with
friends or even a date. The restaurant, although cozy,
had only about ten tables and did not have enough
space to fit all eight of us (we had to sit outdoors). Al
though it was in the 40s outside, the heat lamps they
set up gave us enough warmth to be complacent. 1
definitely suggest sitting outdoors on a warmer day if
you want a quieter, more serene experience.
For an appetizer, we took (lie traditional route
and ordered vegetable fried egg rolls (cabbage,
onions, carrots and celery). Including about ten egg
rolls, the appetizer is a pretty good thing to order with
a big group of people (it also a safe route, as not many
people arc opposed to egg rolls). All hough there was
nothing special about these egg rolls, my friend, who

greatly enjoyed them, found that the the "sweet and
chili flavored accents of the sauce were the perfect
addition to what could be considered a rather bland
dish." If you are willing to step out of your comfort
zone for an appetizer, I would suggest the torn kha
kai. a coconut based soup with lemon grass, mush
rooms, chicken and cilantro. which is presented in a
circular pot healed by a flame in the middle (the
fancy arrangement alone makes the soup worth or
dering).
When it came to the main course, the pad thai, or
dered by both me and two of my friends, was defi
nitely a hit. According to my friend, the pad thai was
once of the best she has ever had. and being a Thai
food enthusiast from L.A., she knows her pad thai.
My other friend, though, a novice to the Thai food ex
perience, did not enjoy her pad thai as much as we
would have hoped. She asked for spicy pad thai and
plainly put, the spiciness was just not there. However,
the spicy rib-eyed steak salad had the perfect flavor
to it, and its smaller portion is good if you want a

lighter option. For the vegetarians, the panang

tofu curry is a very tasty dish that includes crispy tofu
covered in a delicious red pepper, coconut sauce.
Most of the main dishes had pretty good prices ($7.75
for pad thai and around that for most of the other
dishes), which is few bucks less than most of the other
Thai places around Palo Alto.
On the more negative side, a disappointing entree
was the sea food kee mao, which, although advertised
as containing bean sprouts and prawns, only came
with one bean sprout and one prawn. My friend also
learned the hard way that the restaurant does not
have root beer like it says it does.
Known above all for their coconut dishes. Thaiphoon is
a food paradise for coconut lovers. But, even if you are not a
big coconut fan, like me. if you are craving Thai food and
looking for a nice, relaxed place to cat at,Thaiphoon is your
restaurant. If you come with a hungry stomach, an open
mind, and the mentality that you might have to drink Coke
instead of root beer, I guarantee you will have a successful
dining experience.
