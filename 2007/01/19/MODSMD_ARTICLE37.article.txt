## Cold Weather fashion advice from an east coaster 
### ELIZABETH FOX INTERMISSION FOXY FASHIOEER 
I must admit, 1
feel a little bit duped
| being at Stanford.

Coming from
Philadelphia, I mis
takenly believed

that all of Califor
nia required a
wardrobe of only
shorts and tank

tops. 1 looked
forward to call
ing my friends at
Penn who go
out on Saturday
nights in layers
of "party
sweaters" (they
swear the bot
tom layer is
low-cut) and

regaling them with stories of 80 degree tempera
tures. So you can imagine how now, every time I
pull a sweatshirt over my head, a little part of me
dies.
But then, when my roommate lent me
her purple scarf that I've been secretly cov
eting I remembered how much fun winter
fashion can be. Ordinarily, the height of
my morning style is jeans and a well-worn
sweatshirt, thrown on while struggling
from the bed to the door in order to make
a class that invariably began five minutes
ago. But winter offers an ideal time to as
pire to fashion greatness. After all. the
more layers one can pile on, the more
chances one has at achieving something
bordering on chic.
Since the heat wave that hit Philadelphia
during break dulled my winter instincts. I
called a few cold-loving friends for some
suggestions. 1 pass their words of wisdom
and my own winter recollections along here,
in hopes of your best-dressed winter yet -
East Coast style:
Wear pants. At first. 1 worried about this
one. What did my friends think I had been
wearing? Did they think 1 often forgot half
my morning attire? Then they clarified —
not leggings. Cute as you may (or may not)

find them, they were not designed for those
dealing with cold temperatures or over 5
percent body fat.
Don't wear flip flops. Or, more accurate
ly, do wear closed-toe shoes. Personally, I
feel that this was a stab at my newfound Cal
ifornia vibe, a punishment for regaling one
friend, currently at Michigan, about the
Stanford warmth after she had spent the pre
vious night wandering through the snow,
having missed the last bus back to her dorm.
But the advice still merits telling. She sug
gested cute boots or ballet flats as alterna
tives. possibly with layered socks under
neath. depending on Ihe level of frigidity.
Heels, while not impossible, aren't recom
mended. Not only do they offer precious lit
tle protection from the cold, but if you slip
on an icy patch in stilettos, you don't stand a
chance.
Find a wool coat. This comes from the
friend who wears several layers of sweaters,
and thus can't actually feel the wool. If you
happen to find it scratchy, go for any heavy
coat. Faux fur lends arctic-chic without any
ethical dilemmas, and the puffier the coat,
the less it will hurt if you get hit by a bike. For
the accident-prone, that's a cold weather
bonus.

Get into the accessories. Hat, gloves,
scarf — you know how it goes. They don't
have to match, but you get bonus points if
the colors coordinate. The mittens vs.
gloves debate can be solved by convertible
mitten-gloves (the cuteness of a mitten and
then, with the removal of a flap of cloth
covering the fingertips, the writing-ability
of a glove). Everybody agrees that scarvcs
are always in vogue and that one must al
ways be careful to watch out for staticy,
flattened "hat hair."
Layer. This one I had already been em
ploying, but my party-sweater friends were
quick to bring it up again. For those West
Coasters who aren't familiar with the con
cept, it's a lot like layering tank tops to be
fashionable, only now it has a practical pur
pose. Just make sure to build from light to
heavy, starting with something slim and
bodv-hugging and ending with the bulkiest
(but of course extremely fashionable) top
layer.
But there's no reason to retire those ratty
old sweatshirts. Despite a plethora of East
Coast, winter wonderland style advice, there
really is no substitute for them when you're
on your way out the door and late for class.
