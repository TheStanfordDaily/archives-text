## It could be a winter "pleasure" land 
### 
So Roxy was reading the weather report the other day, hoping for some sunshine, some 70-
degree California weather, and instead, what does she find?
A FREEZE warning? What the hell is a freeze warning? Roxy's roommate tells her a freeze
warning is just weather talk for it's fucking cold outside.
And how can we even imagine anything sexy when hobos on the street are on the verge of ex
tinction?
With Roxy's help, very easily.
You see, January may be the month of unbearable cold everywhere else, but here at Stanford, we sim
ply turn our heaters to 9, and summertime. What does this mean? A lot of time inside. A lot of time for
the joy that is sex. And a lot of time to — oh you didn't think it was possible but it surely is — make more
joyful the joy that is sex.
Roxy's going to skip over how exactly you get another (willing human) being on the
verge of nakedness into your room. We've been over this time and again. Alcohol, alcohol, al
cohol.
And if volumes of alcohol are an inadequate social lubricant for you, you — and this is rather
unfortunate — are so ugly as to be ugly even through beer goggles.
Frankly you are just shit out of luck. So where were we? Yes, there is a (willing human) being
on the verge of nakedness in your room. Excellent. We're halfway there. Time to show her (or
him) your...skills.

1 low hard could it he. right? We know how this goes. Penis (or other item) in the vagina (or
elsewhere), thrust thrust thrust, moan moan moan, and we're done. In about 15 minutes. But we
want to keep naked partner around! This is where Roxy comes in.

Let's mix it up a little, shall we?
Oh, Roxy would like to note that spontaneously surprising partner with any of
the commodities necessary lor the following actions may jeopardize your

chances of nookie that evening and all subsequent evenings. There
fore Roxy suggests that you broach the subject sometime prior to

the sex or at a time when you think she (or he) is really feelin 1 it
(though if said partner is a testosterone-driven he. Roxy thinks j
these rules need not apply). That being said, let's continue.

The Jov of W hipped Cream, or Sandwiches or Chicken Curry,
Whatever Floats Your Boat
You like food. You like sex. Why not combine the two?
The Joy of Role-Playing
We are nerdy Stanford students every other day of our lives. No
harm in being a naughty nurse or French maid for an evening, now
would there be?

The Joy of Handcuffs
Roxy handcuffed her boyfriend to her headboard once, did

some things, and by the time he was able to get through those blast
ed restraints he was riling to tear her apart (figuratively speaking).
Something about being unable to sex Rox that made him want to sex
her more.

The Joy of Porn
If you told Roxy you had never watched, listened to or read
pornography, she would tell you you are lying.

1
Because you are. You are voyeuristic. Indulge in your voyeuristic tenden
cies with another, why don't you? And you could learn, and reenact, a thing or
two.

The Joy of a Video Camera
Roxy would say people love being an audience almost as much as they love having one.
The Joy of Another (Willing Human) Being
Roxy has never had a significant other/fuck buddy who proposed a threesome to
her, but she knows deep down every boy (to be politically correct, Roxy usually inserts "or
girl" here, but in this case Rox doesn't exactly think that to be true. Some girls, she suppos
es, but she is a girl and the following statement does not qualify for her. so it cannot qualify
for every girl, so she will not use "or girl") is pining for one. Why? The math. Two girls is
two pairs of lips, four boobies, two vaginas, and four buttcheeks. It's simply looking at and
playing with more of the things he loves. And the same can be said for girls who pine for a
threesome with two boys: two boys is two pairs of lips, four pecs, 12 ab muscles, two penis
es, four buttcheeks, and so on.
If that doesn't keep you up 'till mornin', Roxy doesn't know what will.
