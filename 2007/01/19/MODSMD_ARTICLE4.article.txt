## Ducks down Card with 30 points from the line 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
EUGENE, Ore. — The refrain can be heard
throughout towns on the West Coast every winter:
if Pac-10 officials were paid by the whistle, they'd
be millionaires.
Sure enough, at McArthur Court last night,
Oregon penetrated to draw foul after foul against
Stanford —28 in total. The Ducks reached the
double bonus just eight minutes into the second
half to shoot 23 of 28 from the foul line on the peri
od and 30 of 37 overall. Propelled by the whistle,
the Ducks overcame Stanford's 40-32 second-half
lead and held their spot atop the Pac-10 standings,
downing the Cardinal 66-59 in a tight ballgame at
McArthur Court.
"I know it's been quite a while since we've beat
them," said Oregon center Maarty Leunen (eight
points, eight rebounds), whose squad had lost to
Stanford seven straight times. "And that's our mo
tivation for all the teams that have beaten us in the
past few years — a revenge-type thing."
Guard Aaron Brooks (game-high 19 points. 10
rebounds, 10 of 10 free throws) scored nine straight
Oregon points, six from the foul line, to give the
Ducks (17 1,5-1 Pac-10) a 53-51 lead they did not
relinquish in the game's final five minutes.
Sophomore guard Anthony Goods crashed
back to earth after being named Pac-10 Player of
the Week last week, missing a potential game
tying three with one minute to go that represent
ed Stanford's best last shot. I le shot 2 of 10 shoot
ing (I of 8 from three-point range), with five
turnovers, no assists and just seven points in 38
minutes to play.
But in a game that featured ten ties and a home
court atmosphere better than any in the Pac-10.

Stanford coach TVcnt Johnson, though visibly
upset with the foul calls, did his best to bite his
tongue.
"The double bonus was big." he said. "We didn't
do a good enough job of keeping our hands off and
knowing the angles, and that's as much on me as it
is on the kids.They won, and I'm going to leave it at
that."
