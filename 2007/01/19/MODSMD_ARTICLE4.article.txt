## Ducks down Card with 30 points from the line 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
EUGENE, Ore. — The refrain can be heard
throughout towns on the West Coast every winter:
if Pac-10 officials were paid by the whistle, they'd
be millionaires.
Sure enough, at McArthur Court last night,
Oregon penetrated to draw foul after foul against
Stanford —28 in total. The Ducks reached the
double bonus just eight minutes into the second
half to shoot 23 of 28 from the foul line on the peri
od and 30 of 37 overall. Propelled by the whistle,
the Ducks overcame Stanford's 40-32 second-half
lead and held their spot atop the Pac-10 standings,
downing the Cardinal 66-59 in a tight ballgame at
McArthur Court.
"I know it's been quite a while since we've beat
them," said Oregon center Maarty Leunen (eight
points, eight rebounds), whose squad had lost to
Stanford seven straight times. "And that's our mo
tivation for all the teams that have beaten us in the
past few years — a revenge-type thing."
Guard Aaron Brooks (game-high 19 points. 10
rebounds, 10 of 10 free throws) scored nine straight
Oregon points, six from the foul line, to give the
Ducks (17 1,5-1 Pac-10) a 53-51 lead they did not
relinquish in the game's final five minutes.
Sophomore guard Anthony Goods crashed
back to earth after being named Pac-10 Player of
the Week last week, missing a potential game
tying three with one minute to go that represent
ed Stanford's best last shot. I le shot 2 of 10 shoot
ing (I of 8 from three-point range), with five
turnovers, no assists and just seven points in 38
minutes to play.
But in a game that featured ten ties and a home
court atmosphere better than any in the Pac-10.

NOTES: The Beavers lead the all-time series with the Cardi
nal, 66-54. However, Stanford has won 13 of the last 14
games. The only OSU win during that stretch was at home
in 2004-05. All-time in Gill Coliseum, OSU is 32-19 in
the series. Last year, the Cardinal won in Palo Alto 80-66

Stanford coach TVcnt Johnson, though visibly
upset with the foul calls, did his best to bite his
tongue.
"The double bonus was big." he said. "We didn't
do a good enough job of keeping our hands off and
knowing the angles, and that's as much on me as it
is on the kids.They won, and I'm going to leave it at
that."

Sophomore forward Lawrence Hill fouls Oregon's Malik Hairston as he drives to the hoop in last night's
66-59 Cardinal loss in Eugene, Ore. The Ducks attempted 37 free throws in the game, compared to 1 4
for Stanford.
But senior forward I red Wish
ington (12 points, eight rebounds,
tour turnovers) spoke tar more can
didly.
"1 won't put up locker room ma
terial hut I feel like we could have
won the game," he said. "But to be in
the bonus at 12 minutes, you're not
going to win too many games like
that. I don't know whether they w ere
fouls or not. but we've got to talk to
the refs before games, ask them what
a hand-check is now."
Twin freshmen centers Robin and
Brook Lopez helped the ( ardinal
impose its will down low. Stanford
recorded 40 rebounds and 10 blocks
to Oregon's 35 and two, respectively
Robin Lopez paced Stanford's posts
by scoring 10 points on 5-of- 7 shoot
ing. grabbing seven rebounds and.
most importantly, bailing out team
mates beat repeatedly oft the dribble
with four blocks.
Though Brook did not start, pun
ishment for arriving 20 minutes late
to practice, he finished with six
points, six rebounds and two blocks
in |ust 12 minutes of pla\ Johnson
decided not to play him in thegamt s
final stretch,saying his freshman was
"mentally frustrated."
Brook Lopez's minutes were also
severely limited by his lour fouls
but that was true for practically
everyone in the lineup Sophomore
forward Lawrence Mill (13 points)
fouled out in just 23 minutes of play,
and freshman guard I andry Fields,a
pleasant surprise with seven points
and six rebounds, fouled out in 22
minutes. Washington, Goods and
sophomore guard Mitch Johnson
also finished with at least three fouls
Stanford, for its part, did draw 16
Oregon fouls to shoot 11 of 14 free
throws.
But Oregon's Brooks, forward
Bryce Taylor (14 points. 7-of-S free
throws) and guard Tajaun Porter (15
points.6-of-6 free throws) drove the
lane too quickly for Stanford's
perimeter defenders, forcing Stan
ford to react — often late, and often
with a foul.

Defending and gaining penetra
tion against opponents often faster
and more athletic has been an area of
concern tor Stanford all season long,
and Oregon's five starters are ar
guably the quickest m the confer
ence.
The Ducks' speed justified some
ot Stanford's foul troubles. Washing
ton. however, certainly did not see it
that way.
They 're quick, but lots of people
in the Fac-10 are quick," he said.
"They're small, so maybe it seems

quicker than most teams, but it's
nothing we haven't faced all year.
They did a good job of penetrating
and going to the line. The refs were
calling it. so they kept at it."
Ultimately though, given that
Stanford took a top-ten team to the
wire at home, perhaps Washington's
confidence was justified.
"We're going to see them again."
he said. "They've got to come to our
place, too. We played them pretty
much even here, so we'll see how
thev do on the road."
