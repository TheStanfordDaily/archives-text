## Senate, GSC urge greater diversity Call for increased minority presence in faculty, grads 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ASSU and Graduate Student Council
(GSC) representatives passed a joint resolu
tion last week challenging University admin
istrators to tackle diversity issues in faculty
and graduate student populations.
The bill passed unanimously in both bod
ies and calls upon the University to adopt a
concrete plan by spring quarter of 2007. It
marks an effort to "make Stanford account
able to a very important issue that the admin
istration has yet to adequately address." said
sophomore senator Mondaire Jones, a co-au
thor of the proposal.
"The most important request outlined in
the resolution is that the University adopt a
public and compelling five-year plan for in
ereasingthe number of Stanford's female and
underrepresented ethnic minority faculty
members." Jones added.
One section of the bill cites 2005 statistics
from the Office of the Provost stating that
women represent 24 percent of Stanford's
1.770 faculty members while African-Ameri
can, Chicano/Latino and Native American
faculty comprise just over ft percent. The bill
does not specify Asian and Asian-American
members of the faculty, which represent 12
percent.
This point was a cause for con
tention in the CiSC, which amended
the resolution by adding "in particu
lar" before the list in response to
some representatives' concerns that
the resolution excluded calls for in
creasing faculty diversity in other
ethnicities.
Hie bill also calls for the Univer
sity to adopt a five-year plan in which
"the Provost will require all schools
and departments to set goals for in
creasing graduate student diversity."
In addition, the bill calls for an annu
al mandate from the Provost for di
versity reviews in all schools and de
partments of the University.
On a broader level, the resolution

also asks the University to partner
with peer institutions to form a "con
sortium of universities publicly dedi
cated to the task of reaching out to
qualified minority candidates."
Finally, the bill asks the President
to devote money from the Stanford
Challenge to diversity programs and
initiatives.
Faculty diversity has recently be
come a hot topic â€” particularly the
retention of faculty members of
color. Popular political science Prof.
Luis Fraga's recent announcement
that he will leave Stanford at the end
of the current academic year p o
voked a firestorm of student ac
tivism and reignited campus debates
about diversity.
In many University departments,
faculty diversity continues to lag.The
Chemistry Dept. has no black, Na
tive American or Latino faculty
members and the Physics Dept., with

a 33-member faculty, has just one
Latino professor.
Jones believes that increasing fac
ulty diversity will strengthen stu
dent-faculty relations.
With a diverse faculty, "the pool
of qualified women and ethnic mi
nority faculty candidates will gradu
ally widen through increasing stu
dent exposure to professors with
whom they can identify," Jones said.
"An example of this is the psycholog
ical encouragement and mentorship
a female student's interaction with
women professors teaching in techie
departments is likely to engender."
In addition to discussing faculty
diversity issues, the bill also address
es graduate student diversity, which
has come under scrutiny in recent
years. According to figures compiled
by the GSC's Diversity Committee
co-chair Cullen Buie,a doctoral can
didate in mechanical engineering, 12

percent ot American citizens are
black and 13 percent are
Chicano I atino: Stanford's graduate
student population, on the other
hand, is only 3 percent black and 5
percent I lispanic.
Ihe bill follows in the footsteps of
Yale and Columbia Universities,
which both have long-term diversity
plans in place. Jones said the bill has
the potential to send a message to
other colleges and universities that
Stanford is also committed to diversity.
"That message must first be a
recognition that there is a serious
problem in American higher educa
tion. which is that faculties are not
representative of our increasingly di
verse nation." Jones said. "As a
leader in higher education, Stanford
has a special responsibility to join
peer universities like Vale and Co
lumbia to serve as a leader in helping
to fix this problem."
