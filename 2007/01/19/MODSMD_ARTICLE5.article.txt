## Senate, GSC urge greater diversity Call for increased minority presence in faculty, grads 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ASSU and Graduate Student Council
(GSC) representatives passed a joint resolu
tion last week challenging University admin
istrators to tackle diversity issues in faculty
and graduate student populations.
The bill passed unanimously in both bod
ies and calls upon the University to adopt a
concrete plan by spring quarter of 2007. It
marks an effort to "make Stanford account
able to a very important issue that the admin
istration has yet to adequately address." said
sophomore senator Mondaire Jones, a co-au
thor of the proposal.
"The most important request outlined in
the resolution is that the University adopt a
public and compelling five-year plan for in
ereasingthe number of Stanford's female and
underrepresented ethnic minority faculty
members." Jones added.
One section of the bill cites 2005 statistics
from the Office of the Provost stating that
women represent 24 percent of Stanford's
1.770 faculty members while African-Ameri
can, Chicano/Latino and Native American
faculty comprise just over ft percent. The bill
does not specify Asian and Asian-American
members of the faculty, which represent 12
percent.
