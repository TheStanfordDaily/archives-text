## Soph spirit rising, dance sales show Co-presidents cite dance turnout as evidence of spirit 
### LIA HARDIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sophomore class presidents cited high
turnouts at last night's sold-out Sophomore
Formal in claiming that the class of 2009 has
avoided slipping into the "sophomore
slump."
The sophomore class sold SOO tickets to
the dance, which took place from p.m. to 1
a.m. in both the restaurant and ballroom
portions of Illusions Super Club on Califor
nia Avenue in Palo Alto.
"The sophomore class this year has
turned out to beat the slump fantastically."
sophomore class co-president Casey Means
wrote in an email to The Daily, claiming that
the "Illusions: a Night of Magic"-themed
formal appeared to be the "largest class
wide sophomore event" in Stanford history.
Organizers planned to sell 500 tickets,
which took less than a day to sell out. A sec
ond round of tickets was then printed and
sold for $10 rather than the original price of
$5.
The success of this year's event should
not be overlooked; according to sources fa
miliar with the dance. Sophomore Formal is
not an easy event to organize.
"I think that for every class that comes on
campus at the beginning of their sophomore
year, the shine has worn off." said former
sophomore cabinet member and current
juniorco president Sean Sandoloski." Hiere
isn't as much of a 'woo, college' atmos-
phere."
lie added that "one of the
biggest challenges is getting people
excited about [the formal]."
According to junior co-president
Brett I lammon. who was also a co
president last year as a sophomore,
this year's sophomore officers con
sulted extensively with last year's
co-presidents and cabinet members
in order to ensure the success of the
formal.
"The outgoing sophomore class
presidents met with the incoming
ones to discuss what worked well
and what didn't." he said. "They
learned from our mistakes. That's
why their formal sold out."
Even after the price of the sec
ond batch of tickets rose, many stu
dents were eager to shell out their
money to attend the event.
According to Means, one entre
preneurial sophomore purchased
20 tickets in White Plaza and
planned to hawk them before last
night's event.
"1 asked him il he was going to
take 19 dates," Means said. "Ik
said. 'No. I'm selling these next
week.'"
1 le may have been successful. An
email circulating on the 2006 I lof lo
email list earlier this week offered
two times the going rate for a ticket
to the dance.
The spike in turnout at this
year's event — only 200 or so mem
bers of the class of 200<S pai ticipated
in last year's formal compared with
the 800 at this year's dance — may
be a result of the increased commu
nication between sophomores and
juniors.

This year's Sophomore Formal
planners also had to tackle Stan
lord's history of problems at large
venues off campus, including the
over-packed pub night at the BBC
last week. According to Means, in
order to secure Marguerite charter
shuttles for the event, the Sopho
more Cabinet had to offer a "puke
free guarantee."
Charter Services Coordinator
Karen Moscone acknowledged
that, although Sophomore Formal
has not been a problem before,
"there has been a history at some
events for vomit in shuttle buses."
In the event of problems, Char
ter Services gives a copy of the serv
ice contract to the Office for Stu
dent Affairs and the case is referred
to the Organizational Conduct
Board in the Dean of Students' Of
fice.
Means said that the Sophomore
Cabinet planned to turn away in
toxicated students before they
could leave campus.
'Hopefully people will be re
spectful," she said.
Illusions' Ullyses King said be
fore the event that, although he
knew there had been a number of
problems with Senior Pub Night, he
expected no problems with Sopho
more Formal. Illusions' capacity, he
said, is 1,000.
" There won't be any alcohol." he
said. "Kids can let out their hair and
just put in a showing."
The evening proceeed smoothly,
and Illusions' bouncers seemed al
most superfluous among the well
behaved sophomore crowd. A few
left early, citing tiredness, but most
dance attendees declared the event
a success.
" The planners did a great job,"
said sophomore Yule Schmidt.
"Kudos to the class of 2009 execu
tives."
