WASHINGTON (AP) — The House
wrapped up the Democrats'" 100 I lours" leg
islative sprint Thursday with time to spare,
voting to recoup billions of dollars in lost roy
alties from oil and gas companies and roll
back industry tax breaks.
The energy bill capped a two-week drum
beat of votes on legislation that, while popu
lar with voters last fall,awaits a sketchy fate
in the Senate.
Ihe House bill, approved 264-123, sets a
conservation fee on oil and gas from the Gulf
of Mexico, attempts to recoup royalties lost
because of a government error in drilling
leases in the late 19905, and rolls back several
oil industry tax breaks.
in the November election, the American
people signaled their wish for change—a
wish for our country to go in a new direc
tion." said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. D-
Calif. "Democrats promised that we would,
and these past two weeks, we have delivered
on our promise."
Democrats accomplished their early leg
islative goals in 87 hours, adopting new
ethics rules and passing bills raising the min
imum wage, expanding taxpayer financed
research into embryonic stem cells, forcing
more homeland security measures,directing
the federal government to negotiate for
cheaper Medicare prescription drugs and
lowering interest rates on subsidized stu
dent loans.
Democrats pushed the legislation
through swiftly,denying Republicans any op
portunity to amend bills, and established
themselves as the vanguard for the Democ
ratic agenda. But internal friction within
both parties, the potential for partisan grid
lock in the Senate and confrontation with the
White 1 louse over the war in Iraq signal less,
not more, legislative production in the weeks

ahead.
In the Senate. Democrats and Republi
cans on Thursday untangled a partisan knot
that threatened to sink ethics legislation, vot
ing 96-2 for the bill that tries to reduce the in
fluence of lobbyists on Congress. But the
episode illustrated how hampered Senate
Democrats are to impose their will with their
razor-thin majority.
The past two weeks also took the glow off
the cooperative tone both parties set in the
opening day of the new Congress. 1 louse Re
publicans complained bitterly about being
denied amendments on the legislation, an
echo of Democratic complaints during the 12
years of Republican dominance.
"We are short-circuiting democracy here,
and I think my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle understand it," said House Republican
leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. "I'm here
today to ask my colleagues on the other side
of the aisle to live up to the promises that
were made,to live up to the desire to be treat
ed fairly."
Democrats were not sympathetic.
"We are working on an agenda that the
minority would not or could not do, and
we're fulfilling our promise to the American
people," said Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the House Rules Committee.
"And all the whining you can do, all of it you
can produce will not deter us from it."
Still some Democrats were eager to move
on to a more deliberative pace.
"One of the things that we were savagely
critical of is the fact that the Republicans did
not follow the regular order." said Rep. John
Dingell. D-Mich. "Now it is time for us to get
back and take ourselves seriously and pro
ceed under the regular order."
For all its speed, the House legislation
now enters the quicksands of the Senate,
where Republicans already are displaying
their ability to alter or slow down the Demo
cratic agenda.

Senate Republicans, for instance, used the
ethics legislation to extract a promise from
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of
Nevada that the Senate would get a vote on
legislation to give the president authority to
challenge individual spending items for elim
ination.
Republicans also insisted on attaching $8.3

billion in small business tax breaks to a Senate
version of minimum wage legislation.The leg
islation was written jointly by Finance Com
mittee Chairman Max Baucus. D-Mont.,and
the committee's ranking Republican, Charles
Grassley of lowa. Reid has said he would sup
port the tax breaks to pass the new wage floor.
But House Democrats have objected, noting

that tax legislation must originate in the
House, with the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee.
Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,said Senate Democ
rats were essentially telling the House that
Congress would not raise the minimum wage
if it did not contain tax breaks.
