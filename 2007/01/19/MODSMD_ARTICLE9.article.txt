## American, Iraqi forces ramp up action against al-Sadr Will take matters into own hands if Sadr City attacked, Mahdi Army commander says 
### STEVEN R. HURST ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) —Two Shiite
militia commanders said Thursday that
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has
stopped protecting radical cleric Muqtada
al-Sadr's Madhi Army under pressure from
Washington, while the fighters described
themselves as under seige in their Sadr City
stronghold.
Their account of an organization now
fighting for its very existence could repre
sent a tactical and propaganda feint, but
there was mounting evidence the militia is
increasingly off balance and has ordered its
gunmen to melt back into the population.
To avoid capture, commanders report no
longer using cell phones and fighters are re
moving their black uniforms and hiding
their weapons during the day.
During much of his nearly eight months
in office. al-Maliki. who relies on al-Sadr's
political backing, has blocked or ordered
an end to many U.S.-led operations against
the Mahdi Army.
As recently as Oct. 31, al-Maliki, trying
to capitalize on American voter discontent
with the war and White House reluctance
to open a public fight with the Iraqi leader
just before the election, won U.S. agree
ment to lift military blockades on Sadr City
and another Shiite enclave where an
American soldier was abducted.
But al-Maliki reportedly had a change
of heart in late November while going into
a meeting in Jordan with President Bush. It
has since been disclosed that the Iraqi
leader's vision for a new security plan for
Baghdad, to which Bush has committed
17.5(H) additional U.S. troops, was outlined
in that meeting.
Al-Maliki is said by aides to have told
Bush that he wanted the Iraqi army and po
lice to be in the lead, but he would no
longer interfere to prevent U.S. attempts to
roll up the Mahdi Army.
In a meeting before his session with
Bush, Jordan's King Abdullah II was said
by al-Maliki confidants to have conveyed
the increasing anger of fellow Sunni lead
ers in the Middle East over the continuing
slaughter of Sunni Muslims at the hands of

Shiitc* death squads.
Until February, much of the violence in
Iraq was the work of al-Qaida in Iraq and
allied Sunni organizations.They had killed
thousands of Shiites in random bomb at
tacks in what was seen as an al-Qaida bid to
foment civil war.

It'll be a combination of
targeted killings and
more traditional
large-force operations.

When al-Qaida bombers blew up the
Golden Dome mosque, an important Shiite
shrine in the mainly Sunni city of Samarra on
Feb. 22, Shiite militiamen, especially the
Mahdi Army fighters based in Sadr City,
stormed out of the poor enclave in a drive for
revenge that has only grown in ferocity.
The U.N. reported this week that the
sectarian fighting killed more than 34,000
Iraqis last year, a figure that was criticized
but not disputed Thursday by the Iraqi gov
ernment.
With the Sunni threat in mind, evidence
since the meetings in Jordan indicates that
al-Maliki has kept his pledge to Bush that
there would be no further interference in
favor of Shiite militias.
On Wednesday, the prime minister said
400 Mahdi Army fighters had been de
tained in recent months.
I"he midlevel Mahdi Army command
ers, who spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity because the group
operates in secret, said at least five top
commanders of similar standing were cap
tured or killed in recent months, including
one snatched in a night raid from his Sadr
City hide-out on TUesday. They refused to
name him.

Two other key officials at the top of the
organization were killed in raids last
month:
— Sahib al-Amiri. a senior al-Sadr mili
tary aide, was slain by American forces in
the Shiite holy city of Najaf on Dec. 27. Hie
US. military reported his death,calling him
a criminal involved roadside bombings. Al-
Sadr lives in Najaf.
— The other top commander, identi
lied by a third Mahdi Army commander as
Abu al-Sudour, was shot to death in a joint
U.S.-lracji raid last month as well. He was
hunted down in Sadr City.
The third commander, who also spoke

anonymously to protect his identity, said
U.S.-led raiding parties were now also en
gaged in massive sweeps, having rounded
up what he said was every male old enough
to carry a gun in south Baghdad's Urn al-
Maalef neighborhood Tuesday night.
The I J.S. military spokesman, Maj. Gen.
William Caldwell, alluded to the tactics
early this month when he was asked by the
AP it the coming security operation would
focus on pinpoint raids or broader military
engagements.
"It'll be a combination of targeted
killings and more traditional large-force
operations," Caldwell said.
