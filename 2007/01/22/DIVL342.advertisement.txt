'The Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) and balances offered through June 4,2W7 on such accounts are: ] .00% APY on balances of $1 00 or more but less than $25,000 and 4 50% APY on
balances of $25,000 or more. After June 4,2007 the variable APY for that date will apply For example, using the Promotional Money Market Account from October 23,2006 for balances
above $25 000 an account opened on October 23,2006 will yield 4.50% APY for 225 days until June 4,2007 and will yield 3.75% APY after that date. So, the blended APY for the first year
after account opening is 4.21% APY The blended APY for funds that are on deposit for fewer than 225 days will be lower as it may vary depending on the number of days the promotional rate
is earned. The non-promotional APY is variable and may change during the Sale Period. Charges and fees may reduce earnings. After June 4,2007, qualifying accounts will be converted to a
