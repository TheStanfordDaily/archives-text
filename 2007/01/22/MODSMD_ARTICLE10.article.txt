# Snow Trip Snooper
## 
### BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION SHREDDER 
Most everyone at Stanford has
been on a freshman snow trip, hut
to relive the experience as a staff
member is an experience that only
fellow staff members can under
stand. That's how 1 spent this
weekend — in Tahoe. with 130
freshmen in an 80-person house
with a mixture of the excitement
that snow trip brings and the terror
of knowing that anything could go
wrong at any moment and that you
would be the person responsible
for it.
While all things went smoothly
for the most part, we had our mo
ments: three staff members' first
attempts at snowboarding. two
birthdays with hot tub throws at
tached. the welcoming committee
for the late bus. two toilet over
flows. running out of pizza/pasta
sauce and plenty of face shots.
Here is a sampling of some of the
quotes overheard throughout the
weekend:
"Most people sleep until they wake
up"
"I feel Crystal should be a stripper."

"Did you just say that you were a
vegetarian because you are a les
bian?"
— At In n Out
"1 think people were just having sex
on my bed. They're in the bath
room."
Follow-up: "I wasn't having sex on
your bed. I wouldn't do that."
Second follow-up: "That's like my
freshman year when I got caught in
the laundry room."
"If you freeze to death, I can only
amputate your arms. That's all I
have learned in Surgery 101."
"Jane Camarillo has dysentery!"
— Playing Oregon Trail with a
wagon full of administrators
"Jim Cadena is abusing Jane Ca
marillo."
— Still Oregon Trail, after Jane's
second broken arm in as many days
"Damn low flow toilets!"
— After our first toilet clog
"It's hard to drink and turn."
"I love snowboarding! This is so
much fun! I'm really getting the

hang of this."
— Followed by a face plant in the
snow
"We have a man down!"
"I'm not down. I 'm just snorting."
"We don't know if it is crap or if it's
crap."
— Again with the toilets
"Cold, cold, cold, h0t..."
"Heather, spoon me."
"I want to ride your second wind."
"Who would shit on the floor?"
— A staff member not realizing
that the toilet had overflowed
"Are you high?"
"I ligh is relative, man."
"Relative to what, low?"
"Man, now you're fucking with my
mind."
"It doesn't hurt me. If it hurt, I
wouldn't do it."
Editor's /VWr.The wagon full of ad
ministrators. led by Jim Cadena,
safely made it to Oregon with no
additional casualties.
