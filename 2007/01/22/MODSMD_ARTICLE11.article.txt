As open-minded students on a fairly
eco-friendly campus, we tend to be
lieve that we are doing everything in
our power to promote environmental
preservation. We recycle, lobby politicians
to pass environmental standards and talk
about reducing oil dependence. However,
one of our most potent and most under-uti
lized bargaining chips is our consumer pur
chasing power.
Iliis comes into play especially on the
problem of preserving fish biodiversity, an
issue raised by a New York Times editorial
in November of 2006. According to The
l imes, a recently published scientific study,
lead by Boris Worm of Dalhousie Universi
ty in I lalifax. Canada, showed ih;it 29 per
cent of all species now being fished has col
lapsed from over-fishing, habitat loss or pol
lution.Hie study predicted that all commer
cial fish and seafood species will disappear
by 2048, unless immediate action is taken to
protect biodiversity.
Although there is some debate over the
exact statistics, this report is not the first to
identify severe environmental degradation
in the world's oceans and to predict cata
strophic loss of fish species. There is clearly
an urgent need for a concerted effort to re
duce over-fishing and to pay special atten
tion to preserving the species that are now

endangered.
State officials, particularly in California,
are taking steps in this direction. Late last
year, the California Fish and Game Com
mission tentatively approved 29 new Ma
rine Protected Areas (MPA) along the
state's coast.These areas, which would place
heavy regulations and limitations on com
mercial and recreational fishing, cover 204
square miles of ocean ranging from Half
Moon Bay to Santa Barbara. State legisla
tures aim to create a network of MPAs.each
measuring at least nine square miles, by
2011.
But consumers can also dramatically al
leviate this problem by changing their pur
chasing behavior. Granted, there are nu
merous pressing global issues today, of
which this is only one. At the same time, so
few of those issues can be directly impacted
by the average consumer that it is even
more imperative to act when we are able to
do so. It should be easy enough for those of
us who live in self-ops or co-ops to request
Alaskan wild salmon instead of farmed
salmon, or to order some Dungeness crab
instead of Red Snapper at a restaurant.
Iliis is one of the few problems that can
be tackled at the individual level and. as
such.should be a top priority in the fight for
environmental preservation.
