# What goes around...

I was laid up with food poisoning all week
end, and I think I'm going to blame it on
the play 1 saw Friday night. You're prob
ably wondering what the conneetion be
tween theater and food poisoning is (bad
buttered popcorn?), but it all has to do with
karma.
Normally, karma takes a while to actual
ly work out. In the long run everything
evens out. but in the short run it seems like
small misdeeds go unpunished.This, howev
er, was one of the rare situations in which di
vine justice took effect as immediately and
hilariously as on an episode of Seinfeld.
See. I went to this play, and I kind of
made fun of it. A lot. I'm a natural born crit
ic and I've probably watched too many
episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000,
so I think I've developed a not entirely jus
tified sense of entitlement to criticize what
ever is in front of me. Unfortunately, I didn't
check my horoscope on Friday, or I proba
bly wouid've seen that it was "get bitch
slapped by karma" day.
The first part of div ine justice was that I
ended up sitting right in front of the director
whose work I was criticizing. The rule of
mockery is that the meaner you are, the
more likely it is that you're saying it right in
front of the person you're talking about.
The second part of divine justice was
waking up several hours later, in the wee
hours of Saturday morning, with all of my
body's distress signals going off at once.
What's especially telling is that this is the
second time in my year-and-a-half at Stan
ford that I've been laid up with stomach ail
ments. Last spring. I was one of only two
people in my dorm to get the Plague, which
escaped the confines of Toyon just to tor
ment me.
Since I wasn't of a particularly weak con
stitution before I arrived at Stanford. I have
to wonder if this is some kind of divine sig
nal urging me to mend my ways of debauch
and mockery, at pain of severe digestive dis
tress. I don't know what a life without mock
ery would be like, but then again, I really do
enjoy being able to eat things.
Anyway. I woke up early on Saturday
morning, and by the time I actually got "up"
I was in a pretty pitiful state. Ghastly pallor,
dark circles under my eyes, bloodless lips.
"Damn," I thought as I looked at my sallow
complexion in the mirror. "Hither you're in

love, or you've got food poisoning." 1 almost
shared that bon mot with someone, but in
stead I just lay on my bed and whimpered
softly.
I thought my lifeless eyes were a pretty
good indication of the fact that I wasn't feel
ing well, but I ended up having to reiterate
again and again (and again, for the guy who
picked me up in a bear hug and shook me
around roughly), that I was actually feeling
a little off and could you stop shaking me,
please? And then everyone, uniformly, of
fered one response: "What did you eat?"
I guess people are motivated in part by
morbid curiosity and part by worrying for
their own health (selfish bastards), but I can
tell you that someone who's feeling nause
ated really doesn't want to talk about food.
Neither do they want to watch someone else
eat an entire packet of soy sauce or endure
a discussion about eating an entire plate of
hash browns covered in syrup. But the third
part ot divine justice is that whenever you
are feeling nauseated, you must be sur
rounded by the most disgusting possible
types of food.
(Last year, 1 got the stomach flu the day
ol my dorm's special dinner, which was. of
course, sushi. One girl offered brightly,
"Sini, you should come eat a little some
thing. It will make you feel better."
"I'm going to throw up," I offered equal
ly brightly, and her face turned a gentle
shade of green.)
The good thing is that my stomach has
started feeling much better, just in time for
my nose to get stuffed up. So, if the director
is out there reading this, could she please
have a talk with the universe? Or just stop
poking needles in the voodoo doll?

If this column isn't up to Sini's usual stan
dards, it's because she really just wanted to
take a nap. Email complaints and condo
lences to Sini in (" stan ford, edi i.
