# Seven pillars for a new way forward
## 
### 
Just two weeks ago, President Bush issued
an unprecedented and strangely anticli
mactic mea culpa for the failures of the
American campaign in Iraq. In light of the
developing (deteriorating?) situation in the
region, brought into yet starker relief by this
admission, I'd like to offer my take on some
of the mistakes now going on in U.S. policy in
Iraq and in the broader Middle F.ast.
Hold new strategy, same old tin ear. Presi
dent Bush is making the so-called "troop
surge" the cornerstone of what his adminis
tration is billing as a new strategy for securing
Iraq. In his speech, he pledged to send 20,000
additional soldiers mostly to Anbar Province
and Baghdad, and he blamed the failure of
previous troop surges on their inadequately
small scales. But on Jan. 7. Frank Rich ob
served a deadly flaw in this reasoning, point
ing out that the Pentagon's new manual on
counter'insurgency "endorsed the formula
that '20 counterinsurgets per 1.000 residents'
is the minimum troop density required'" to
win this sort of war. ITiis proportion, he
noted, would require more than 100.000 ad
ditional troops just to secure Baghdad. In
other words, our 20,000-strong surge is just a
drop (of American blood) in the bucket.
Given this administration's track record, it's
hard to see this as anything more than half
measures for a war that, by all accounts, we
can't afford to win only halfway.
The Kosovar king. People who are con
fused by all the sectarian strife in Iraq today
would profit from reading about Kosovo in
the '90s. An Albanian majority region of the
Serbian state, Kosovo split into messy vio
lence between Albanian Muslims and Ser
bian Christians. NATO and the OSCE han
dled and continue to handle Kosovo well
enough, and here's a key tip we should take
from something they didn't do. 'ITiey didn't
pick a biased side with links to Balkan militia
groups, call it a government and declare that
this new Kosovar government has complete
sovereignty and can't be told what to do by
NATO and Europe.The Iraqi Shi'ite govern
ment, however, does have its bread buttered
by militias. At tomorrow night's State of the
Union, President Bush needs to make a clear
case that Iraq's Maliki government is worth
saving.To date, the President has stressed the
importance of security improvements over
political reforms. But if Bush really doesn't
think reform is just as important as security, I
know a cell phone video that he should
watch.
I lie next Gulf War. Recent arrests of Iran
ian agents in Iraq have sparked worries of
eastward escalation. Democratic Senator Joe
Biden, quoted on Jan. 12 in The New York
Times, voiced his concerns that the Bush ad
ministration might use Iran's involvement in
Iraq to provoke or justify military action
against the Tehran regime without seeking
Congressional approval for war. The White

I louse's finger probably isn't that close to the
trigger, but they should take note of Mr.
Biden's concern, because it's probably
shared by some figures in Tehran. Given the
sensitivity of the ongoing Iranian nuclear
talks, the Bush administration needs to be
careful about their orders for U.S. Special
Forces with respect to Iranian agents and ter
ritory, and make sure that we don't use our
guns to shoot our own diplomacy in the foot.
(living credit. Contrary to popular com
plaint. Iran is not the source of all our prob
lems in Iraq. Even after it was clear that the
WMI) justification was made on false pre
tenses and that the war was not going well, it
was still fashionable to speak well of the war
for the laudable outcome of deposing Sad
dam. It seems to me that if we agree Saddam

was such an awful man and a brutal dictator,
it shouldn't be too much of a mental effort to
credit him with creating the climate of mur
derous politics and the insane level of dis
trust that make Iraq so tragically deadlocked
today. It may have been possible to prevent
those forces from taking hold after we re
moved him. or it may not have been; either
way. we didn't have a new deal for the Iraqis
soon enough. The deadly genie is out of the
bottle now,but the Iranians didn't put it there
in the first place, nor did they uncork it. So
give credit where credit is due.
Maine and shame. In the same vein. 1
don't want to hear any more baseball
coach/boardroom talk from the Bush ad
ministration about how the Iraqis need to
"step up to the plate" or how their "failure
to perform" is sabotaging Iraq's future. Iraq,
like other countries, has good and bad peo
ple in it. What's more,under dictatorships as
vicious as Mr. I lussein's, the difference be
tween a good and a bad person inevitably
gets grayed. When we entered Iraq in 2003.

the good from the bad and make
sure the good got into places of
power. We tried to do that, but we
failed. The least we can do now is
have the decency to respect the
Iraqi people who, ultimately, are the
biggest losers in this endeavor. You
can't walk in the door shouting
about saving a people from a vio
lent overlord and later walk out the
door complaining that they "aren't
taking responsibility." That's the
height of irresponsibility. So to
those who would continue to slan
der the Iraqi people for the mount
ing quagmire in their country, I say
grow up and fess up.
Guns for Palestine. The Wall
Street Journal reported on Jan. 12
that the Bush administration is
sending an unprecedented $86 mil

lion to Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah
Party in Palestine in an effort to bol
ster l-atah against the Syria- and
Iran-backed llamas Party. Most of
this money is expected to go to ar
maments. It's unclear whether Fatah
represents a political center that is
worth supporting to the point of ar
mament, but it's certain that if
there's one thing we need less of in
the Levant, it's guns. American poli
cymakers are due a thoughtful re
minder of Machiavelli's insight that
"mercenaries bring nothing but
loss."
Apologies aside. The greatest
novelty of Bush's speech two weeks
ago was his atypical self-blame:
"Where mistakes have been made,
the responsibility rests with me." But
we are fast leaving the world of re
sponsibility for the world of conse
quences. Let's hope tomorrow
night's speech reflects that reality.
