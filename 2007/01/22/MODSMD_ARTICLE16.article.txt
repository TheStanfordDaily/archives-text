### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Speaking to a relatively small au
dience in Margaret Jacks 1 (all on Fri
day. award-winning Muslim comedi
an Sha/ia Mir/a held nothing hack,
mocking religion, race, politics and
society in a racy stand-up routine
that she has performed across the na
tion.
"In these times when we are
being fed a very distinct idea of what
it means to be a Muslim and what it
means to be a Westerner. Sha/ia is
defying our stereotypes and creat
ing a new space where we can laugh
together." said Program in Writing
and Rhetoric instructor Helle Rv
tkonen. who invited Mir/a to cam
pus as part of her class on political
satire. "She is poking fun at all of us.
and we are united in laughing with
her."
Born into a strict Muslim family in
Birmingham, England. Mirza is the
last person most would expect to see
making a living through controver
sial comedy.
"I didn't really intend to be a co
median." Mirza said. "But I love it
more than anything else I 've done."
Mirza said that while her Pak
istani parents probably intended for
her to enter into a more practical
field, they have come to accept her
new profession.
"My family knows and they don't
really mind." she said. "They're very
religious, so obviously they're a bit
ashamed of the anal sex jokes, but
they've learned to deal."
After receiving her graduate de
gree in biochemistry. Mirza began
teaching at an all-boys school in Lon
don before deciding to pursue her
passion for comedy Nearly eight
years later, she has become one of
the most prominent female comedi
ans in Britain, and is often cited as
the world's only female Muslim
comic.
"She has won a number of awards
and usually performs to thousands of
people st) it was really remarkable

that she came to perform for only 30-
40 students here." Rytkonen said.
"She's the headliner in San Francisco
right now."
Though she started performing in
early 2000. the events of 9/11 signifi
cantly jolted her career. Her honest
and sarcastic approach to the stereo
types and judgments associated with
the attack brought her both acclaim
and criticism.
"My name is Shazia Mirza," she
would tell her audiences. "At least,
that's what it says on my pilot's li
cense."
In addition to performing in com
edy clubs across the United States
and I urope, Mirza has toured in
India and Dubai.and has performed
on a number of television programs.
I ler experiences have allowed her to
reflect on the different cultural val
ues around the world.
"When I went to India, they said
that if I did sex jokes they would ar
rest me because it was offensive to
their country," Mirza said. "The po
lice told me it didn't have educa
tional value. I disagree. In Dubai I
was allowed to talk about every
thing except religion, and in Ger
many I was told to explain all my
jokes."
During a live performance in
2001. three men jumped onstage and
attacked Mirza after she made a sex
ual joke associated with Mecca and
Islam. Although the incident re
quired her to take a month off from
performing.she did not retreat from
her controversial rhetoric and in
stead began using Islamic funda
mentalist complaints as part of her
act.
In her performance Friday Mirza
read aloud from many of the recent
death threats she'd received, poking
fun at the authors' language.
" Ihis man wrote that 1 am 'a pros
titute to the white men and a prosti
tute to the West' because I do come
dy." Mirza said. "He said he wanted
to join the hatred' against me be
cause I am evil."
Mirza pointed to one Muslim in
dividual who signed his threat with
the email, "You-don't-need-to-con
tact-me-I-will-kill-you-soon(Â« hot
mail.com."
In the past year Mirza has been
working on a program for BBC

about "hairy women." and the stigma
associated with female body hair.
"I had to grow all my body hair. I
mean everything," she said. "Basi
cally I was a man trapped in a man's
body. I wanted to look at the taboos
associated with women with really
bad body hair. I had to go out and do
certain sketches, like go to a speed
dating event and see how the men
react. We would have secret cam
eras filming these guys and they'd
say things like 'you look like a goril
la' or haven't you ever heard of a
razor?"'

When asked about the quality of
comedy internationally. Mirza said
that while she enjoys some American
comedians. British comedy far sur
passes all the rest.
"Americans love to talk about
America." she said. "Because that's
what they know best. Ihey don't
have a great perspective on the world
really, but there's some good stuff.
Curb Your Enthusiasm and Arrested
Development are really funny. But
the best comedy is British. I lonestly,
Ihe Office and Borat both came
from Britain."
