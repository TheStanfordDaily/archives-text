# STUDENTS OCCUPY HENNESSY'S OFFICE
## University Human Resources defends living wage policy, argues that restrictions are necessary 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seven students protesting the University's
living wage policy briefly occupied President
John I lennessy's office lliursday, performing ;i
minute long interpretative skit before leaving
a deflated volleyball in their wake.
1 lennessy was not present, and after learn
ing this, the students took a volleyball, which
they claimed represented the idea of a genuine
living wage, and then passed it around to sym
bolize the passing of the responsibility o! the
living wage from the Student Labor Action
Coalition (SL.A( ') to President I lennessy to
the Presidential Advisory Committee on
Workplace Policies (PAC), back to President
Hennessy and finally to Human Resources. It
was in the hands of the student representing
Human Resources that the ball was dropped
and then popped. The students left the deflat
ed volleyball with the message, "a living wage,
like a volleyball, doesn't work when it has
holes in it."
Hie students, mostly members of SI.AC,
said that the skit was in response to a recent

Human Resources update, published in De
cember, which they claim effectively signaled
the demise of any possibility for a living wage
policy.
"Human Resources' update declared, once
and for all, and despite President Hennessy's
frankly untrue claim to have implemented all
the recommendations of the PAC, that the liv
ing wage policy will not be expanded." senior
Mariana lluerta. one of the skit performers,
said."lt will continue to be a fully empty docu
ment applying to few, perhaps no workers."
Executive Director of Human Resources
(IIR) Diane Peck, however, maintains that the
living wage is an issue that the I 'diversity con
tinues to take "very seriously."
"We continue to work toward creating the
best working environment for all those who
work on campus," Peck said.
I lie history of the University's living wage
policy is a complicated one. In the autumn of
2003, PAC' which was co chaired by Peck
was created to investigate the feasibility of a
living wage and to assess campus labor policies.

Seven members of the Stanford Labor Action Coalition stormed Hennessy's office on Thursday and passed around a volleyball before
deflating it. The volleyball they said, was a symbol for the University's living wage, which they accused of being passed aside by Hennessy.
