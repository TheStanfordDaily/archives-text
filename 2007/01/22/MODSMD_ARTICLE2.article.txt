# STUDENTS OCCUPY HENNESSY'S OFFICE
## University Human Resources defends living wage policy, argues that restrictions are necessary 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seven students protesting the University's
living wage policy briefly occupied President
John I lennessy's office lliursday, performing ;i
minute long interpretative skit before leaving
a deflated volleyball in their wake.
1 lennessy was not present, and after learn
ing this, the students took a volleyball, which
they claimed represented the idea of a genuine
living wage, and then passed it around to sym
bolize the passing of the responsibility o! the
living wage from the Student Labor Action
Coalition (SL.A( ') to President I lennessy to
the Presidential Advisory Committee on
Workplace Policies (PAC), back to President
Hennessy and finally to Human Resources. It
was in the hands of the student representing
Human Resources that the ball was dropped
and then popped. The students left the deflat
ed volleyball with the message, "a living wage,
like a volleyball, doesn't work when it has
holes in it."
Hie students, mostly members of SI.AC,
said that the skit was in response to a recent

Human Resources update, published in De
cember, which they claim effectively signaled
the demise of any possibility for a living wage
policy.
"Human Resources' update declared, once
and for all, and despite President Hennessy's
frankly untrue claim to have implemented all
the recommendations of the PAC, that the liv
ing wage policy will not be expanded." senior
Mariana lluerta. one of the skit performers,
said."lt will continue to be a fully empty docu
ment applying to few, perhaps no workers."
Executive Director of Human Resources
(IIR) Diane Peck, however, maintains that the
living wage is an issue that the I 'diversity con
tinues to take "very seriously."
"We continue to work toward creating the
best working environment for all those who
work on campus," Peck said.
I lie history of the University's living wage
policy is a complicated one. In the autumn of
2003, PAC' which was co chaired by Peck
was created to investigate the feasibility of a
living wage and to assess campus labor policies.

Seven members of the Stanford Labor Action Coalition stormed Hennessy's office on Thursday and passed around a volleyball before
deflating it. The volleyball they said, was a symbol for the University's living wage, which they accused of being passed aside by Hennessy.
partly as a result of a weeklong stu
dent fast. According to Peck, the
committee recommended in June
2(H)4 that Human Resources review
the possibility for expanding the
I Jniversity's living wage policy.
In April 2006. Human Resources
decided not to remove the restric
tions on the living wage policy, and it
defended this decision in the De
cember update.
In an interview with 'ITie Daily,
Peck argued that removing all of the
restrictions on the living wage policy
was impractical. She said that if
I luman Resources had not enforced
any conditions on the policy, then
every work contract, regardless of
dollar amount, would be subjected
to the living wage policy. Such an
arrangement. Peck argued, would be
"nearly impossible to monitor" and
would have required "unreasonable
additional resources."
Peck also insisted that the Uni
versity had increased the living wage
rates, effective Sept. 1. 2006, on the
recommendation of Human Re
sources and that a number of "very
positive changes" have been made
for those working at the University.
"I encourage anyone to review all
the important improvements HR has
made at our Web site." Peck said. "As
evidence of Stanford's position as an
employer of choice, we have more
than 50,000 applicants each year for
the approximately 1.600 staff posi
tions that we fill. And,even more im
portant ly. our staff turnover is among
the lowest of our Ivy colleagues
based on a recent survey in which we
participated. I think that says that
people really want to come to work
here and. once here, they feel re

spcctcd, valued and want to stay."
The students involved with the
skit, however, expressed strong dis
agreement with Peck's diagnosis of
the living wage policy, arguing that
the number of restrictions on the
policy effectively prevents most
workers from receiving a real living
wage.
"Among its findings, the PAC rec
ommended that if Stanford operates
a living wage, it should be meaning
ful and transparent,' and not have so
many restrictions that it excludes
most of the workers it's meant to
represent," said Daniel Weissman, a
second-year doctoral candidate in
physics and member of the group.
"In other words, I think that the PAC
made a direct recommendation for
Stanford to broaden its living wage
policy if it wants it to be a real living
wage."
Junior Bradley Heinz, another
skit participant, expressed increduli
ty at the response from I luman Re
sources.
"I low can Stanford say we have a
living wage for contracted workers
when I can more easily name work
ers who aren't covered by the policy
than I can workers who are?" I leinz
asked. "We don't even know
whether any single worker is cov
ered. It's just dishonest and shameful
on Stanford's part."
Ultimately, the skit's members
say that they hope that I lennessy re
considers the University's living
wage policy and eliminates some of
the restrictions.
"The administration rarely refus
es outright to address labor issues,"
Weissman said. " Ihey prefer to stall
decisions, to diffuse or pass on re
sponsibility or to make changes that
appear to be substantial but whose
loopholes negate any genuine effect."
The students said that they will
soon post their performance on the
Web site voutube.com.

the lowest of our Ivy colleagues
based on a recent survey in which we
participated. I think that says that
people really want to come to work
here and. once here, they feel re

spcctcd, valued and want to stay."
The students involved with the
skit, however, expressed strong dis
agreement with Peck's diagnosis of
the living wage policy, arguing that
the number of restrictions on the
policy effectively prevents most
workers from receiving a real living
wage.
"Among its findings, the PAC rec
ommended that if Stanford operates
a living wage, it should be meaning
ful and transparent,' and not have so
many restrictions that it excludes
most of the workers it's meant to
represent," said Daniel Weissman, a
second-year doctoral candidate in
physics and member of the group.
"In other words, I think that the PAC
made a direct recommendation for
Stanford to broaden its living wage
policy if it wants it to be a real living
wage."
Junior Bradley Heinz, another
skit participant, expressed increduli
ty at the response from I luman Re
sources.
"I low can Stanford say we have a
living wage for contracted workers
when I can more easily name work
ers who aren't covered by the policy
than I can workers who are?" I leinz
asked. "We don't even know
whether any single worker is cov
ered. It's just dishonest and shameful
on Stanford's part."
Ultimately, the skit's members
say that they hope that I lennessy re
considers the University's living
wage policy and eliminates some of
the restrictions.
"The administration rarely refus
es outright to address labor issues,"
Weissman said. " Ihey prefer to stall
decisions, to diffuse or pass on re
sponsibility or to make changes that
appear to be substantial but whose
loopholes negate any genuine effect."
The students said that they will
soon post their performance on the
Web site voutube.com.
