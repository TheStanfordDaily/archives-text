### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
It was like night and day for the No. L ) Stanford
women's basketball team this past Saturday at
Maples Pavilion. Subdued by the Oregon State
Beavers in the first half, the Cardinal came out in the
second half down by 11 and "laid down the law." as
head coach Tara VanDerveer put it. for a 69-55 win.
"I lopefully it's a wakeupcall for us." senior center
Brooke Smith said. "We played Oregon on Thursday,
and they didn't shoot the ball very well, so we were

the first half,gathering momentum against a weak ef

At first, Stanford seemed on its way to another
easy win in its now 14-game streak with an 8-0 run in
the first nine minutes and a 14-6 lead. The Cardinal

on a 13-3 run to take the lead.22-20.

Jayne Appel and one free throw shot. The Beavers,
on the other hand, gathered another 12 points,
damming up the Cardinal's flow for a 34-23 lead.
"I hope we're not the kind of team that has to get
