## No. 9 Card overcome big deficit 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
It was like night and day for the No. L ) Stanford
women's basketball team this past Saturday at
Maples Pavilion. Subdued by the Oregon State
Beavers in the first half, the Cardinal came out in the
second half down by 11 and "laid down the law." as
head coach Tara VanDerveer put it. for a 69-55 win.
"I lopefully it's a wakeupcall for us." senior center
Brooke Smith said. "We played Oregon on Thursday,
and they didn't shoot the ball very well, so we were
able to get away with not playing as well as we're ca
pable of. Oregon State came out and hit the shots,
though, and we still didn't play well."
The Beavers (7-10, 2-6 Pacific-10 Conference)
out-shot and out-rebounded Stanford (16-3,9-0) in
the first half,gathering momentum against a weak ef
fort. Although Oregon State shot just 38.9 percent
from the field, it was enough to overcome the Cardi
nal's 33.3 percent.
At first, Stanford seemed on its way to another
easy win in its now 14-game streak with an 8-0 run in
the first nine minutes and a 14-6 lead. The Cardinal
led by as many as eight points until the Beavers went
on a 13-3 run to take the lead.22-20.
In the final six minutes of the first half. Stanford
only mustered one layup from freshman forward
Jayne Appel and one free throw shot. The Beavers,
on the other hand, gathered another 12 points,
damming up the Cardinal's flow for a 34-23 lead.
"I hope we're not the kind of team that has to get
a bloody nose before we start fighting," VanDerveer
said. "We need to come out and be the aggressor —
and we weren't. We need to come out and take care
of the ball — and we turned it over. We had people

making had decisions, and we
weren't finishing a lot of shots."
Turning over the ball 10 times,
compared to Oregon State's five
giveaways, and not capitalizing on its
height advantage nor completing its
shots, VanDerveer brought the team
into the locker room with a strong re
minder: the team's No. 9 reputation
was at stake. When VanDerveer
heard the cheers of teams at other
arenas, celebrating the Cardinal's
possible downfall,she said,"We can't
let this happen."
The team understood. Sopho
more guard Jillian Harmon called
the 11 -point lead "unacceptable," but
the women were still confident they
could turn it around.
"Going into the second half. I had
great confidence in our team." Har
mon said. "I could just see it in our
eyes that we were going to bring that
energy we need in our games."
Stanford showed that energy in a
frenetic 20-6 run within the first six
minutes of the second half. Powered
by three jumpers and a game-clinch
ing three-pointer from junior guard
Candice Wiggins, the Cardinal re
gained the lead, 43-40. The Beavers
fought to keep their upset from
washing away, but were only able to
tie the game three more times before
Stanford truly "laid down the law." A
10-3 run toward the end of the half
secured Stanford's 14th straight win
and reasserted its high rank.
But the Cardinal's No. 9 standing
may be exactly what got it into trou
ble in the first half.
"Hopefully this will make us
aware that you can't just go into
games expecting to win." Smith said.
"We have to bring more energy and

get ourselves going. We can't expect
to beat a team just because we're
ranked higher or whatever."
VanDerveer agreed, and said that
the team has lately been "lackadaisi
cal."
"Oregon State came in with the
attitude that they were going to bat
tle, and they did." she said. "This is
what we want, but we don't have to
be down 11 at halftime and then get
into a frenzy in the second half."
After scoring just 23 points in the
first half, Stanford doubled that with
46 in the second. They also held the

second half, compared to the Cardi
nal's own 26 (for a total of 27 and 47,
respectively). VanDerveer was proud
of her team's renewed intensity.
"Our second half was excellent,
and we'd like to have back-to back
halves like that all the time," she said.
Stanford will need that kind of
game this next weekend when it
heads to the Arizona schools to face
its top Pac-10 rival, the No. 10 Ari
zona State Sun Devils (18-2,8-1).
"It's going to be tough going to
Arizona." VanDerveer said."We can
not come out and play like this in the
first half again."
