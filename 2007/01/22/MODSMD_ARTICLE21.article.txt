"It he missed 15 shots, he'll shoot
the next one like he just hit 15," said
(ioods ot I (ill. "That's a good quality
to have, because he doesn't care. He
just shoots. 1 le just scores."
Ihe Stanford defense stiffened
when its offense surged. They ha
rassed the Beavers into bad looks and
blocked shots, holding them without a
field goal for 8:07 down the stretch
iiin. Marcel Jones (20 points,eight re
bounds, seven steals), the Beavers'
leading scorer, finally hit a three to
snap the drought with I :<Xi to go. but it
was too little too late.
Ihe Cardinal had the game in hand
with a 61-52 lead, and Goods put the
final nails in the coffin by scoring
seven of his IS points in the last two
minutes.
Goods said senior forward Fred
Washington's defense and a focus on
offensive rebounding helped trigger
the run.
"Late in the game, we knew it was
coming to a point where it was do-or
die," Goods said." Ihe last eight min
utes, coming out of a timeout, I told
them we had to play like it was the last
two. And we came out there,
I awrence had some big blocks, the
twins had some big blocks and we
took care of the ball."
Ilie first 32 minutes went far worse
than the final eight. Stanford turned
the ball over on its first four posses
sions— setting the tone for an 18-
turnover night. Incredibly, the Cardi
nal (12-5,4-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
still jumped to an early 11-2 lead,only
for Oregon State (9-11,1 -6) to visibly
out-hustle the Cardinal for the rest of
the period. I"he Beavers scored seven
straight to cut the lead to two, and
ended the first half ahead, 34-29.
"Our margin of error is extremely.

freshman forward Brook Lopez (12
points.s-of-6 shooting, nine rebounds)
picked up the scoring slack on Satur
day. the Stanford guards' inability to
find the Lopez twins with entry passes
is a quickly-growing concern for the
team.
"We just have to work at involving
Robin and Brook a lot more so they
can be more effective," said Hill, who
added that perimeter players needed
to work on their positioning so that
defenders would not be able to dou
ble-team the freshman duo as easily.
"They only got eight shots off."

"It he missed 15 shots, he'll shoot
the next one like he just hit 15," said
(ioods ot I (ill. "That's a good quality
to have, because he doesn't care. He
just shoots. 1 le just scores."
Ihe Stanford defense stiffened
when its offense surged. They ha
rassed the Beavers into bad looks and
blocked shots, holding them without a
field goal for 8:07 down the stretch
iiin. Marcel Jones (20 points,eight re
bounds, seven steals), the Beavers'
leading scorer, finally hit a three to
snap the drought with I :<Xi to go. but it
was too little too late.
Ihe Cardinal had the game in hand
with a 61-52 lead, and Goods put the
final nails in the coffin by scoring
seven of his IS points in the last two
minutes.
Goods said senior forward Fred
Washington's defense and a focus on
offensive rebounding helped trigger
the run.
"Late in the game, we knew it was
coming to a point where it was do-or
die," Goods said." Ihe last eight min
utes, coming out of a timeout, I told
them we had to play like it was the last
two. And we came out there,
I awrence had some big blocks, the
twins had some big blocks and we
took care of the ball."
Ilie first 32 minutes went far worse
than the final eight. Stanford turned
the ball over on its first four posses
sions— setting the tone for an 18-
turnover night. Incredibly, the Cardi
nal (12-5,4-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
still jumped to an early 11-2 lead,only
for Oregon State (9-11,1 -6) to visibly
out-hustle the Cardinal for the rest of
the period. I"he Beavers scored seven
straight to cut the lead to two, and
ended the first half ahead, 34-29.
"Our margin of error is extremely.
