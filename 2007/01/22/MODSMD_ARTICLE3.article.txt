## New cafe sparks dining debate Nexus replaces Linx, no longer part of meal plan 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The campus eatery I.inx. located at
the Clark Center, left the Stanford Din
ing scene quietly in mid-December. It
was replaced two weeks ago by Nexus
Cafe, but undergraduate and graduate
students alike expressed dissatisfaction
with the new establishment because it
does not accept Cardinal Dollars.
Nexus — which is open for breakfast.

lunch, snacks and dinner — boasts a
wide variety of food, including a salad
bar and a taqueria. as well as Asian-style
food, burgers, sandwiches and pasta.
The cafe, which features slightly lower
prices than its predecessor, has been
open since Jan. 8.
As of Dec. 15, Stanford Dining ceased
to operate Linx and Peet's Coffee and
Tea at the Clark Center. Employees at
Feet's remain the same, but Nexus em
ployees are new to Stanford.
Jerry Boone, the new cafe's food serv
ice director, said that this takeover came
about when Linx's contract was up and
Nexus Cafe placed a bid to overtake the
services.

"It was just a matter of going in there
and presenting a plan." lie said.
Rati Taherian. executive director of
Stanford Dining, said that when Clark
Center management made a formal re
quest for proposals, Stanford Dining de
cided not to take part in the process,
choosing instead to focus its energy on
other priorities.
"We're very much focusing on devel
oping the Old Union cafes now. making
sure that Old Union will be a successful
destination place," laherian said."()nce
the renovation is complete, projected
sometime in the spring, we will proceed
with the planning and opening of the
cafe."
Boone added that since its open
ing. Nexus has been well received
and extremely busy.
"Literally about a thousand peo
ple per day go through there." he
said.
Boone estimated that most of his
customers were the doctors and sci
entists who generally frequent the
Clark Center, but that there was a
great mix of students as well.
Despite Boone's optimism, how
ever. many students expressed frus
tration at the new cafe's policy of not
accepting Cardinal Dollars.
"My friends and I had a weekly
tradition of going to I inx for over a
year, and now that it doesn't take
points, we've had to find somewhere
else to go." said sophomore Molly
Weiss."Linx was the best place to eat
on campus, so we're really annoyed
about this change."
Boone said that when his bosses
took over the cafe's contract, the
Cardinal Dollars issue was not a part

ot the discussion.
"It might have caught our people
off-guard a little bit, since we're just
not set up to take it. accounting
wise," he said.
Boone added that Nexus may ac
cept Cardinal Dollars in the future.
"[Cardinal Dollars] will be
looked at, and could become a vi
able solution," he said. "It could be
helpful to both parties, and 1 know
that students would like it. We want
ed to get the ball rolling and the
doors open, and the next part of it
will be to look at those other angles,
whether it's the tax issue or the Car
dinal Dollars, and see what we can
do about that."
Taherian did not comment on how
much of Linx's business came from
students using Cardinal Dollars, but
did say that over the past two years
students increasingly visited both
the cafe and Peet's Coffee at the
Clark Center.
Many of Linx's customers were
graduate students who are not on a
Stanford meal plan. At Nexus, these
students can no longer get the seven
percent discount they enjoyed at
Linx simply bv showing their student
IDs.
First-year medical student F.lsie
Gyang. who was having lunch at

Nexus, said she thought it was to the
new cafe's disadvantage not to offer
a student discount and said she prob
ably wouldn't dine at the new eatery
as a result.
Da Pan,a 2()0h graduate,said that
she didn't notice anything different
except for slower lines. I lowevei .she
agreed with Gyang that the eatery
would lose money by not giving a
student discount.
"When I was an undergrad, I
would use points exclusively here."
Pan said.
Opening up the Cardinal Dollars
option to dining locations not man
aged by Stanford Dining would in
crease the revenue source of these
locations, but Taherian said the
process could reduce funding
sources for other existing opera
tions.
"In exchange, we have to cut serv
ices in operations where we're cur
rently managing," he said.
Frequent Linx client Anish Mitra,
a sophomore, said he was unhappy
with the change, but understood that
the decision made sense for the Uni
versity.
"Stanford makes money from the
lease, and the main patrons at the
medical school get lower prices." he
said.
