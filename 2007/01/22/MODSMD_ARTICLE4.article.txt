## Black student graduation rate rises Grad rate nationwide still below 50 percent 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Good news: the nationwide enroll
ment of black students in college is the
highest it has ever been. Bad news: the
national graduation rate is still below 50
percent.

ITiis January, the Journal of Blacks in
Higher Education (JBIIE) found that
the average graduation rate, defined as
receiving a degree within six years, for
black college students has increased four
percent over the past three years but cur
rently stands at 43 percent, 20 percentage
points below the 63 percent average
graduation rate for white college stu
dents.
lTie article also reported that Stan
ford has the ninth highest black student
graduation rate in the nation at 90 per

cent, five percentage points below its
graduation rate for white students and
the black student graduation rate at I lar
vard. the leader nationwide in black
graduation.
Associate Prof, of Political Science
Luis Fraga, who will be leaving for the
University of Washington next tall, point
ed out that it makes sense that gradua
tion rates are higher at very selective uni
versities because of the high admission
standards.
"The students that are selected have a
consistent pattern of success that is likely
to be replicated at the university." I raga
explained.
Tracy Curtis 1 lolmes 11. a second-year
graduate student in chemical engineer
ing and treasurer of the Black (iraduate
Student Association (BGSA), agreed.
"Stanford gets a different caliber of
students who are ilready motivated." he
said."The high gt iduation rate isn't real
ly anything Stanford is doing."
Psychology Prof. Lwart Thomas sug
gested that because selective schools log
ically have higher graduation rates com
pared to the national average, a better
judge ol how Stanford is doing would be
to look at how it compares to other selec
tive schools.
In its report, the J BHE also in vest igat-


BECKY WRIGHT/The Stanford Daily
Ed the black student graduation
rates between different types of
schools and found that public state
schools and historically black col
leges and universities (HBCU) were
likely to have some of the lowest
graduation rates for black students.
()f the HBCU, Spelman College has
the highest black student graduation
rate at 77 percent. Twenty of the
lIBCIJ schools, however, have two
thirds or more of black students fail
ing to earn a diploma.
The study discussed several influ
ences on graduation rates, including
the racial climate at the school and
the si/e of the black community.The
report found that a large black com
munity and a welcoming atmos
phere increased the success of the
students, while preparation level and
family background also impacted

student performance.
Fraga noted that looking at statis
tics for only four-year universities
doesn't show the whole picture, ar
guing that a large percentage of mi
nority students, especially African-
American and Latino students, are
enrolled at community colleges.
"Many working-class students
think that going to community col
lege is a wise alternative to entering
a four-year school because of the
lower tuition costs, the flexibility to
enroll part-time and the low admis
sion standards," Fraga explained.
"The reality is that many of these
students never make it to four-year
colleges — only about 20 percent
transfer — and have limited oppor
tunities as a result."
The key to increasing graduation
rates and overall student success is
recognizing that students from dif
ferent backgrounds need different
kinds of support, Fraga emphasized.
Some students need remedial in
struction to bring iheni up to the rig
orous level of university classes.

while others need increased finan
cial support. Students from working
class families are often expected to
contribute to emergency family ex
penses such ;is health costs and rent.
University financial aid systems
often fail to take these additional ex
penses into account.
Fraga mentioned mentoring and
counseling, both in high school and
in college, as an important source of
support. I lolmes said that mentoring
undergraduates makes up an impor
tant role of the BGSA and advised
that schools consider providing pro
grams for freshmen the summer be
fore they enroll to help introduce
them to college and increase their
preparedness.
Stanford has many support pro
grams in place, such as the Partners
for Academic I Excellence program,
which partners upperclassmen and
graduate students with freshmen.
Thomas said theme dorms and other
programs that specifically target mi
norities are vitnl support systems
that also help students succeed.
