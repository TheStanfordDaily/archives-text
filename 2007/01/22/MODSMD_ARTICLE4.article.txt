## Black student graduation rate rises Grad rate nationwide still below 50 percent 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Good news: the nationwide enroll
ment of black students in college is the
highest it has ever been. Bad news: the
national graduation rate is still below 50
percent.

ITiis January, the Journal of Blacks in
Higher Education (JBIIE) found that
the average graduation rate, defined as
receiving a degree within six years, for
black college students has increased four
percent over the past three years but cur
rently stands at 43 percent, 20 percentage
points below the 63 percent average
graduation rate for white college stu
dents.
lTie article also reported that Stan
ford has the ninth highest black student
graduation rate in the nation at 90 per

cent, five percentage points below its
graduation rate for white students and
the black student graduation rate at I lar
vard. the leader nationwide in black
graduation.
Associate Prof, of Political Science
Luis Fraga, who will be leaving for the
University of Washington next tall, point
ed out that it makes sense that gradua
tion rates are higher at very selective uni
versities because of the high admission
standards.
"The students that are selected have a
consistent pattern of success that is likely
to be replicated at the university." I raga
explained.
Tracy Curtis 1 lolmes 11. a second-year
graduate student in chemical engineer

Student Association (BGSA), agreed.
"Stanford gets a different caliber of
students who are ilready motivated." he
said."The high gt iduation rate isn't real
ly anything Stanford is doing."
Psychology Prof. Lwart Thomas sug
gested that because selective schools log
ically have higher graduation rates com
pared to the national average, a better
judge ol how Stanford is doing would be
to look at how it compares to other selec
tive schools.
