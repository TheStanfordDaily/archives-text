# STUDENT ACTIVISM
## Students rally against sweatshops University has historically resisted apparel regulations 
### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
Citing the lack of independent monitoring of
the factories that produce Stanford apparel, the
Stanford Asian American Activism Committee
(SAAAC) has initiated a campaign to convince
the University to join the Workers' Rights Con
sortium (WRC) and the Designated Suppliers
Program (DSP) to ensure that the factories in
which its apparel are made are not sweatshops.
On Tuesday, the group plans to stage a noon
time rally at White Plaza, during which members
will march to the President's Office and present
their formal demands.
"We want to show that we are strong and that
we are gathering support," Sweat-free Stanford
Coalition co-organizer Daniel Shih. a sopho
more. told a group of 20 SAAAC members at a
planning meeting last Friday.
While Shih and fellow co-organi/.er Mark I iu.
a senior, described the planned march and the
presentation of the demands as "non-confronta
tional." both emphasized the need to be "spirit-

Ed" and show the University that the organiza
tion is serious about its campaign.
"We want to dictate the movement on our own
timetable," l.iu said."lf we had scheduled a meet
ing with the University, we wouldn't have had a
meeting for another month or two."
In its formal demands, the group calls on the
University to affiliate with the WRC.a non-prof
it organization that assists universities in drafting
codes of conduct for the factories in which its
clothes are produced, as well as with the DSP. the
enforcement program that would gradually im
plement the I Jniveisity's work regulations over a
three-year period.
"'Hie WRC is an independent monitoring
body that provides necessary oversight of licens
ee factories and establishes a code of conduct for
factories," Liu said,"while the DSP. through certi
fication and the consolidation of apparel manu
facture in a number of factories, is a necessary ad
ditional safeguard against exploitation."
Created in 1999 by various university adminis
trations. students and labor rights experts, the
WRC ensures that universities nationwide com
ply with sweatshop-free labor conditions
namely, that the factories that produce their ap
parel provide a living wage to their workers.com

compensate for overtime, permit
unionization and allow for inde
pendent monitoring.
To investigate factories' condi
tions both in the United States and
abroad, the WRC charges a fee of one
percent of gross licensing revenues,
up to a maximum of $50,000, from
each affiliated school.To this date, I6(i
colleges and universities have affiliat
ed themselves with the WRC — in
cluding Harvard, M.I.T. and Brown
while 30 schools are DSP affiliates,
including Columbia. Duke and the
entire UC system.
While both Shih and Liu admit
that they do not have concrete evi
dence to indicate that University-li
censed apparel factories are sweat
shops. they maintain that they are
calling for independent oversight and
greater accoun ta bi Ii t y.
"We're fighting for a mechanism
to ensure that the University is being
responsible," Shih said. "We don't
have definitive reports that the Uni
versity is using sweatshop labor, but it
is generally assumed in the garment
industry that without the enforce
ment of regulations, companies over
whelmingly rely on sweatshops."

Shih also pointed to a 2000. report
prepared by the Business for Social
Responsibility Education Fund
(BSREF) and commissioned by Har
vard and the University of California,
which found that without effective
and vigorous monitoring, sub-par
working conditions existed in univer
sity-licensed apparel factories.
I listorically. the University has re
sisted student calls for WRC-affilia
tion. In May 2000. 100 students gath
ered in White Plaza to sign a petition
calling on the University to join the
WRC but ultimately failed to garner
the administration's support. In
March 2002. 112 student-athletes
signed a similar petition and a sweat
free campaign was initiated in April
with the goal to convince President
Hennessy to join the WRC: yet this
movement similarly failed to secure a
positive response from the Universi
ty.
These campaigns were oriented
primarily around the Nike Corpora
tion, whose alleged use of child labor
and the sweatshop conditions in its
third-world factories became well
publicized in the early 2000s. Liu and
Shih said their campaign would not
suffer a similar fate because they have
not targeted any one apparel compa
ny.
"We're not going after the corpo
rations." Shih said. "We're going for a
systematic solution to the problem.

The University must use its unique
power to license its name out to man
ufacturers as a wa\ of ensuring that
human rights are respected when
sewing our apparel."
Currently, the Sweat-free Stanford
Coalition has drawn the support of
approximately two dozen students,
but members expressed confidence
that the group's public awareness
drives would garner more on-campus
support.
"Students don't knmv that the
brands that they are wearing are
made in sweatshops." freshman
Pal lua ( ha said. "1 was once at a
workshop about GAP. and I felt very
guilty when I looked down to see that
I was wearing GAP myself."
Ultimately, campaign members
emphasized the need to work with
the University to achieve reform.
"We need to take the step for
ward together," said Scott Frank, a
freshman. "The new campaign [the
Stanford Challenge] started by the
President compels the I University to
walk the talk that they have been
talking."
Inquiries to the President's office
were directed to Susan Weinstein.
