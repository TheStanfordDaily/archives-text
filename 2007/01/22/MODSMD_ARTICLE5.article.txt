# STUDENT ACTIVISM
## Students rally against sweatshops University has historically resisted apparel regulations 
### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
Citing the lack of independent monitoring of
the factories that produce Stanford apparel, the
Stanford Asian American Activism Committee
(SAAAC) has initiated a campaign to convince
the University to join the Workers' Rights Con
sortium (WRC) and the Designated Suppliers
Program (DSP) to ensure that the factories in
which its apparel are made are not sweatshops.
On Tuesday, the group plans to stage a noon
time rally at White Plaza, during which members
will march to the President's Office and present
their formal demands.
"We want to show that we are strong and that
we are gathering support," Sweat-free Stanford
Coalition co-organizer Daniel Shih. a sopho
more. told a group of 20 SAAAC members at a
planning meeting last Friday.
While Shih and fellow co-organi/.er Mark I iu.
a senior, described the planned march and the
presentation of the demands as "non-confronta
tional." both emphasized the need to be "spirit-

Ed" and show the University that the organiza
tion is serious about its campaign.
"We want to dictate the movement on our own
timetable," l.iu said."lf we had scheduled a meet
ing with the University, we wouldn't have had a
meeting for another month or two."
In its formal demands, the group calls on the
University to affiliate with the WRC.a non-prof
it organization that assists universities in drafting
codes of conduct for the factories in which its
clothes are produced, as well as with the DSP. the
enforcement program that would gradually im
plement the I Jniveisity's work regulations over a
three-year period.
"'Hie WRC is an independent monitoring
body that provides necessary oversight of licens
ee factories and establishes a code of conduct for
factories," Liu said,"while the DSP. through certi
fication and the consolidation of apparel manu
facture in a number of factories, is a necessary ad
ditional safeguard against exploitation."
Created in 1999 by various university adminis
trations. students and labor rights experts, the
WRC ensures that universities nationwide com
ply with sweatshop-free labor conditions
namely, that the factories that produce their ap
parel provide a living wage to their workers.com
ply with federal health and safety regulations
