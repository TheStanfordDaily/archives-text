## ALL A-BOARD GAMES 
### BEN EPPLER INTERMISSION BOARD GAMER 
What are you doing Friday night? What's that,
you're going to KA? 1 have to admit. 1 probably
won't be seeing you there. You see, this Friday,
like many other weekend (and weekday) nights,
I'll be playing a board game.
You might call me something of an anachro
nism, a relic of a bygone age (10 years old?) when
friends could gather around a Risk board for
hours, or just a nerd. I suppose I am all of these
things, but 1 have just this to say for myself: Don't
knock it until you try it.
If you've never marched with the armies of
Alexander the Great, committed your last tank
reserves to a decisive desert battle in World War
II or just deviously traded Boardwalk to the
owner of Park Place in exchange for the light blue
monopoly and a no-rent guarantee, you've never
really lived.
Board games afford us a unique blend of so
cial experiences unavailable anywhere else. An
evening of gaming combines the opportunity to
socialize afforded by a relaxed house party with
the friendly competition characteristic of rec
league sports, and throws in a nice dose of intense
but ultimately risk-free negotiation that can't be
found in any other activity. It's a recipe for deli
ciousness.
We've all played the so-called classics: Monop
oly. Life, Risk, maybe a little Parcheesi or Sorry.
I'm not going to bash these beloved games (who
doesn't love skipping the "Get Married" space
and having 5 bastard children in Life?), but such
pedestrian fare may eventually grow stale. Sorry
is a decent game, but one can only play it so many
times before putting it away and swearing never
to play again.
So I'm including below some strategy games
that fly under the radar.The indie games.The un
derground. down-with-the-man kind of board
games that are just daring you to turn off your
Xbox.call up your friends and give them a try.
Settlers of Catan: If you enjoyed the real estate
trading aspect of Monopoly, you're sure to like
the simple, addictive trading mechanics of this
German gem. which has sold over 10 million
copies worldwide. Players use the resources like
wool, timber and brick to construct roads and
towns, which are employed to extract more re
sources But its difficult for one player to create a
completely self-sufficient, mercantilist colony.
You may be able to produce hella wool, but
you're still going to need bricks to build those

roads and towns. Over the course of about an
hour and a half, the virgin island of Catan will be
colonized, armies will be raised and your towns
will grow into cities. It's a capitalist paradise.
Axis and Allies: Take Risk, add tanks, airplanes,
battleships and carriers, and you've got this 80s
classic that remains in print to this day. You will
know what it was like to be Stalin, staring down
the barrel of a massive German tank invasion and
ordering your stalwart but weaponless infantry
into the meat grinder. As Admiral Yamamoto.
your Zero fighters will sink the U.S. Pacific Meet
and run wild during the first years of the war. If
you play as the Yanks, you will mobilize your in
dustrial might to take the war to your enemies
overseas... but will your assistance arrive in time?
Axis and Allies plays best with five players (two
A\is and three Allies), lots of table talk and team
strategi/.ing.
Diplomacy: "Know your enemy," urged the an
cient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu in his "Art of
War." In Diplomacy.you may not even know who
your enemy is. And that's the brilliance of this
loose depiction of pre-World War 1 Europe.
Seven great powers, from the Ottomans to the
French, begin the game with equal strength. No
nation is strong enough to protect every inch of
its borders,so the key to the game is finding some
one to trust and getting others to trust you. All
movement is simultaneous, and in between
moves there is a negotiation period where you
can leave the table, make secret agreements, false
promises or blustering threats to the other play
ers. As the Austrians. do you negotiate an uneasy
truce with the Ottoman player in order to make a
concentrated attack on the Italians? If so, tell the
Italian you want to demilitarize your border with
him or her and then launch a sneak attack! Be
sure to tell the Italian. "No hard feelings, it's just
a game," as you wipe his or her unsuspecting
forces off the map.
Diplomacy shows your friends' true colors.
Most new players start the game with good in
tentions: They make alliances and plan to keep
them, and when they attack another player they
declare their intentions. Hut eventually, some
one turns their back a little too far. makes a be
trayal a little too profitable and the least scrupu
lous person at the table strikes. Then the game
gets interesting.
Best of all. there are no dice in Diplomacy. In
fact, the game contains no random elements
other than the always-unpredictable relations be
tween the up to seven people at the table. Win

ning is that much sweeter, and losers have no one
to blame hut themselves.
Civilization: ITiis is definitely the most complex
and user-unfriendly of the hunch, but it is also ar
guably the best.The game, printed in the early 80s
by the now-Hasbro-owned gaming titan Avalon
Hill, combines the commodities trading of Set
tlers with the diplomatic maneuvering of. well.
Diplomacy and adds a technological element to
simulate the development of civilization in the
Near East. It's a massive topic, and Civ treats it
well. Players struggle to develop their fledgling
cultures in the face of hostile competition, civil
war. floods, plagues of locust and other calamities.
This game consumes an entire day when it hits
the table, so watch out, but man. what a day Your
empire may rise, be struck down by war or other
disasters, and emerge from the ashes like a
phoenix to dominate the world again. Anyone
thinking of buying this game ought to make sure
not to pay more than $00 for it.and be careful not
to buy the Eagle Games version. It was released
in 2003 and is a black mark on the Civilization
brand name.
I'm not saying that getting a good multiplayer
game on the table is easy. Eirst. someone has to
own it. Ebay serves all of my game-purchasing
needs, especially for out-of-print gems like Civi
lization. Games also make great gifts. Want to buy
a game, but have to get a gift for a close friend?
Kill two birds with one stone! Everyone loves a
shiny new copy of Settlers of Catan or a vintage
(read: used) version of Civilization.
Game nights — because many games require
significant time commitments — also face prob
lems with coordinating the schedules of poten
tial players. Not even my closest friends are al
ways willing or able to sit down for an hours-long
confrontation over the fate of the Mediter
ranean world. And even if you talk fast enough
and romanticize bygone years eloquently
enough to actually get your friends to the table,
one of you has to be familiar enough with the
rules to teach the game.
Mut the investment is well worth it. Games af
ford unique opportunities for escapism.socializa
tion.competition and (simplified) historical spec
ulation. Think Japan and Germany should have
tag-teamed Russia in 1942? Try it out. But don't
come crying to me when the Tommies take
Berlin. Think you're the best liar or shrewdest
commodities broker in your group of friends?
Play Diplomacy or Settlers of Catan. You might
be surprised.

pedestrian fare may eventually grow stale. Sorry
is a decent game, but one can only play it so many
times before putting it away and swearing never
to play again.
So I'm including below some strategy games
that fly under the radar.The indie games.The un
derground. down-with-the-man kind of board
games that are just daring you to turn off your
Xbox.call up your friends and give them a try.
Settlers of Catan: If you enjoyed the real estate
trading aspect of Monopoly, you're sure to like
the simple, addictive trading mechanics of this
German gem. which has sold over 10 million
copies worldwide. Players use the resources like
wool, timber and brick to construct roads and
towns, which are employed to extract more re
sources But its difficult for one player to create a
completely self-sufficient, mercantilist colony.
You may be able to produce hella wool, but
you're still going to need bricks to build those

roads and towns. Over the course of about an
hour and a half, the virgin island of Catan will be
colonized, armies will be raised and your towns
will grow into cities. It's a capitalist paradise.
Axis and Allies: Take Risk, add tanks, airplanes,
battleships and carriers, and you've got this 80s
classic that remains in print to this day. You will
know what it was like to be Stalin, staring down
the barrel of a massive German tank invasion and
ordering your stalwart but weaponless infantry
into the meat grinder. As Admiral Yamamoto.
your Zero fighters will sink the U.S. Pacific Meet
and run wild during the first years of the war. If
you play as the Yanks, you will mobilize your in
dustrial might to take the war to your enemies
overseas... but will your assistance arrive in time?
Axis and Allies plays best with five players (two
A\is and three Allies), lots of table talk and team
strategi/.ing.
Diplomacy: "Know your enemy," urged the an
cient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu in his "Art of
War." In Diplomacy.you may not even know who
your enemy is. And that's the brilliance of this
loose depiction of pre-World War 1 Europe.
Seven great powers, from the Ottomans to the
French, begin the game with equal strength. No
nation is strong enough to protect every inch of
its borders,so the key to the game is finding some
one to trust and getting others to trust you. All
movement is simultaneous, and in between
moves there is a negotiation period where you
can leave the table, make secret agreements, false
promises or blustering threats to the other play
ers. As the Austrians. do you negotiate an uneasy
truce with the Ottoman player in order to make a
concentrated attack on the Italians? If so, tell the
Italian you want to demilitarize your border with
him or her and then launch a sneak attack! Be
sure to tell the Italian. "No hard feelings, it's just
a game," as you wipe his or her unsuspecting
forces off the map.
Diplomacy shows your friends' true colors.
Most new players start the game with good in
tentions: They make alliances and plan to keep
them, and when they attack another player they
declare their intentions. Hut eventually, some
one turns their back a little too far. makes a be
trayal a little too profitable and the least scrupu
lous person at the table strikes. Then the game
gets interesting.
Best of all. there are no dice in Diplomacy. In
fact, the game contains no random elements
other than the always-unpredictable relations be
tween the up to seven people at the table. Win

ning is that much sweeter, and losers have no one
to blame hut themselves.
Civilization: ITiis is definitely the most complex
and user-unfriendly of the hunch, but it is also ar
guably the best.The game, printed in the early 80s
by the now-Hasbro-owned gaming titan Avalon
Hill, combines the commodities trading of Set
tlers with the diplomatic maneuvering of. well.
Diplomacy and adds a technological element to
simulate the development of civilization in the
Near East. It's a massive topic, and Civ treats it
well. Players struggle to develop their fledgling
cultures in the face of hostile competition, civil
war. floods, plagues of locust and other calamities.
This game consumes an entire day when it hits
the table, so watch out, but man. what a day Your
empire may rise, be struck down by war or other
disasters, and emerge from the ashes like a
phoenix to dominate the world again. Anyone
thinking of buying this game ought to make sure
not to pay more than $00 for it.and be careful not
to buy the Eagle Games version. It was released
in 2003 and is a black mark on the Civilization
brand name.
I'm not saying that getting a good multiplayer
game on the table is easy. Eirst. someone has to
own it. Ebay serves all of my game-purchasing
needs, especially for out-of-print gems like Civi
lization. Games also make great gifts. Want to buy
a game, but have to get a gift for a close friend?
Kill two birds with one stone! Everyone loves a
shiny new copy of Settlers of Catan or a vintage
(read: used) version of Civilization.
Game nights — because many games require
significant time commitments — also face prob
lems with coordinating the schedules of poten
tial players. Not even my closest friends are al
ways willing or able to sit down for an hours-long
confrontation over the fate of the Mediter
ranean world. And even if you talk fast enough
and romanticize bygone years eloquently
enough to actually get your friends to the table,
one of you has to be familiar enough with the
rules to teach the game.
Mut the investment is well worth it. Games af
ford unique opportunities for escapism.socializa
tion.competition and (simplified) historical spec
ulation. Think Japan and Germany should have
tag-teamed Russia in 1942? Try it out. But don't
come crying to me when the Tommies take
Berlin. Think you're the best liar or shrewdest
commodities broker in your group of friends?
Play Diplomacy or Settlers of Catan. You might
be surprised.

What are you doing Friday night? What's that,
you're going to KA? 1 have to admit. 1 probably
won't be seeing you there. You see, this Friday,
like many other weekend (and weekday) nights,
I'll be playing a board game.
You might call me something of an anachro
nism, a relic of a bygone age (10 years old?) when
friends could gather around a Risk board for
hours, or just a nerd. I suppose I am all of these
things, but 1 have just this to say for myself: Don't
knock it until you try it.
If you've never marched with the armies of
Alexander the Great, committed your last tank
reserves to a decisive desert battle in World War
II or just deviously traded Boardwalk to the
owner of Park Place in exchange for the light blue
monopoly and a no-rent guarantee, you've never
really lived.
Board games afford us a unique blend of so
cial experiences unavailable anywhere else. An
evening of gaming combines the opportunity to
socialize afforded by a relaxed house party with
the friendly competition characteristic of rec
league sports, and throws in a nice dose of intense
but ultimately risk-free negotiation that can't be
found in any other activity. It's a recipe for deli
ciousness.
We've all played the so-called classics: Monop
oly. Life, Risk, maybe a little Parcheesi or Sorry.
I'm not going to bash these beloved games (who
doesn't love skipping the "Get Married" space
and having 5 bastard children in Life?), but such
pedestrian fare may eventually grow stale. Sorry
is a decent game, but one can only play it so many
times before putting it away and swearing never
to play again.
