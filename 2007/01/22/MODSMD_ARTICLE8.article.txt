# Crikey! Coming (back) to America
## 
### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION SHEILA 
Traveling in a country that

speaks English, it was easy to

forget that I was not. in fact.

in America. In our introduc-

tion to the Australia study
abroad program, one of

our professors warned us
that while it was tempting,

we should not make the mis

take of treating Australia as if it

were the U.S. because there are cul
tural differences that do actually
matter — and to act otherwise is to
he an ignorant American.
One large difference (one that
shouldn't seem like that big of a deal
at first) is which side of the sidewalk
to walk on. Common sense, no? I lere.
we naturally walk on the right side of
a street or sidewalk and pass on the
left. In Australia, not so—you walk on
the left side. It's a fast and easy test to
determine if you are a foreigner. The
result is often a collision or an awk
ward back-and-forth dance.
1 hadn't realized how ingrained
walking on the left side of the street
had become in me after only three
months down under until 1 collided
with a family of four in LAX after ar
riving from Brisbane. It's a seeming
ly small cultural difference, but the
consequences of getting it wrong are
rather embarrassing.
Another cultural difference —
that while minor, was strange — was
the food. Mexican food does not
exist. This may not seem strange, ex
cept that almost every other type of
cultural food is found in abundance.
You want Thai food? Japanese food?
Peruvian food? Indian food? You
can easily find a restaurant or four
within a several-block radius. You
want a burrito? Good luck.
1 also did not eat banana for three
months. Over the summer, a cyclone
hit the banana farms and destroyed
the crops. Australia does not import
their produce, so any bananas were
of poor quality and ridiculously ex
pensive.
Almost all of the food is grown in
Australia, and those Aussies are
proud of it. Every apple, orange,
squash, etc. comes with a sticker that
says"Made in Australia" with an out
line of the country. Beyond the pro
duce. most of the packaged food,
dairy, drinks and meat products also
are made in Australia. Whether this is
done from nationalist pride or a de
sire to keep out the "undesirable"
products is still up for debate. Either
way. it was always a feel-good mo
ment to know you were drinking or
ange juice squeezed from oranges
grown in Australia.
Also, there is no straight-up cof
fee. If you order "coffee" or "decaf"
you will get stared at. Same with
"non-fat." Instead, there are flat
whites, long blacks, skinny lattes and
cappuccinos. It was an adventure to
order, but always delicious, because
coffee is übiquitous.
Rounding out the cultural dispar
ities is Australian fashion. It is a com
bination of 80s and European cou
ture. only without actually caring.

Hie colors are bright and bold — or
ange. pink, teal, yellow and red polka
dots and stripes, with belts tied
around the mid-section.
Jewelry without fail consists of
large, plastic clunky jewelry equally
as bright and gaudy. Headbands are
also the rage — the sparklier the bet
ter. Shoes are of vast importance, and.
again, as bold and patterned as possi
ble. The saleswomen are brutally
honest and. as a consequence, very
helpful. Anything goes, fashion-wise,
but if it looks horrid, they will tell you.
Coming back to America, now,
the clothes look incredibly bland,
lackluster and all the same. What
happened to the beautifully loud
dresses and shirts? The clothes were
not about finding the shortest skirt
possible, but instead showing off
your personality. 1 wish 1 had bought
more clothes while I was there, be
cause going shopping here is painful.
This article barely touches upon
the differences economically (like
how expensive books and magazines
are).environmentally (like how they
actually talk about global warming,
the destruction of the reefs, how to
work towards solving the problems
and how hot and humid it is, which
my hair loved) or in the sports world
(every sports section was 90 percent
cricket, no lie), but they do exist, no
matter how similar our countries
may seem.
Because the two nations are com
parable (John Howard and George
W. Bush being BFF comes to mind),
it makes their differences even more
startling. After three months, howev
er. I was impressed how quickly it all
became the norm. Coming back to
the U.S. was an adjustment, mostly
because 1 was only in the country for
one week before winter quarter
classes began. But instead of suffer
ing from cultural shock, mostly 1 just
miss it.
