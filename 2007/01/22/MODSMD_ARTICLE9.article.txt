# Sorabol BBQ: Darn good for a food court
## 
### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION HBO LXPER I 
This past Saturday, my three
roommates and 1 decided to go on a
shopping trip in San Francisco.
Caught up in our consumerism, we
didn't realize how hungry we were
until we had tread through the entire
San Francisco Shopping Centre (a
new mall off Market Street that re
cently opened). With only 30 minutes
to eat before we had to leave to catch
the CalTrain, we needed something
close and quick. Given this, the food
court seemed the best solution. Al
though I was initially disappointed
that we had come all the way to San
Francisco (finally making it out of
the dining hall!) hut did not have
time to eat in a real restaurant, I soon
realized there was no reason to be let
down.
First of all. this shopping mall's
food court is. well, not your average
food court. Not only are there a large
number of places to choose from (it's
quite an overwhelming experience),
but all the options actually look ap
pealing. Unsure of where to eat. we
finally chose Sorabol Korean BBQ
& Asian Noodles because, alter scop
ing out the situation, it appeared that
the majority of people in the food

court were eating this.
Inexperienced in Korean BBQ. I
carefully listened to what everyone
else was ordering, and it seemed as
though the plate lunches were the
way to go. With a choice of BBQ Beef
(Bui Gogi), Chicken (Dak Gui),
Short Rib (Kal hi) or Spicy Pork
(Dwegi (iui), one gets a huge plate
112 ull of meat plus white rice, chap chae
(Korean style glass noodles) and
broccoli. And when I say a "huge"
plate, I mean a really, really huge
plate. There is more than enough
food for two people to share, and at
around $8 each, it is quite the deal. In
addition, the salad plate, a mix of cu
cumbers, bean sprouts, mushrooms,
carrots, green onions and zucchini,
caught my eye right before I made it
to the register. So for $3 additional. I
decided to spring for this as well as a
BBQ Chicken plate.
Most Asian food court venues
tend to at least be decent. But even
my roommate, who loves Korean
BBQ and has had it many a time, at
tested to the tastiness of our plates
here. ITie BBQ chicken was perfectly
cooked and surprisingly high-quality
meat for a food court establishment.
There was nothing special about the
broccoli and white rice (admittedly,
it's hard to make white rice verv ex

citing or different). but the clear noo
dles were quite unique. They were a
little slippery, but their delicious
taste more than made up for the mess
I made.
Although the rest of my room
mates raved the most about the noo
dles. my favorite part was the salad
plate. Soaked in a Korean dressing
and presented nl a beautiful arrange
ment, the salad had a healthy.refresh
ing taste. The only dish that can I can
think of that slightly resembles it is a
sunomono (a cucumber salad you
can get at Japanese restaurants). Be
sides the lunch plates, another popu
lar set of dishes that others seemed to
be enjoying were the noodle soups
(fish balls, shrimp, chicken or beef
with noodles in a hot broth, topped
with mushrooms, carrots, cabbage,
bean sprouts and green onions).
I can be quite picky about food,
but I can't think of any complaints
from this Korean BBQ experience.
The service was speedy, the dishes
were delicious and there was a plen
titude of food. If you are ever around
the San Francisco Shopping Centre
and need a quick bite. I would unre
servedly suggest Sorabol Korean
BBQ iSc Asian Noodle for a better
(or rather, far better) than average
food court experience.
