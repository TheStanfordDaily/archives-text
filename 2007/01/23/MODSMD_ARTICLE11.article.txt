## Editorial Board What can Jack Bauer do for you? 
### 
For Senior Jonathan Goldstein. Mon
day nights 112 rom 9-10 p.m. are off limits
for everything except FOX's hit
drama. "24."
"My friends know not to call me during
that hour." he said."lt's not that I'm anti-so
cial about it. I'll watch it with other people.
1 just want to he fully focused on what's
happening."
As most people familiar with the show
already know. Goldstein is hardly alone.
Since its debut in 2001 ."24" has become one
of the most popular and compelling shows
on television. Its debut this season garnered
33 million viewers and the DVD sales of its
past seasons are one of the highest of any
serial, F.ven at Stanford, where many peo
ple yearn for the days when watching plen
ty of TV was easy, students readily re
arrange their schedules to make time for
"24."
"I have multiple friends trying to cram
seasons of the show into a matter of weeks
to catch up for the new season," Goldstein
said.
Each season of "24" focuses on one day
in the life of counter-terrorism agent Jack
Bauer, with each episode showing a one
hour real-time segment of that day. Much of
the popularity is generated from the fast
paced action and constant sense of anticipa
tion, as Bauer has to race, puzzle-solve and.
more than anything else, fight his way to the
end of the day — which usually results in
saving the United States from a terrorist in
flicted disaster.
Yet despite the show's enormous enter
tainment value —and we admit that it is
addictive- whether you are a devoted
longtime fan, or just getting into the series,
it is important to pause and consider how
the show may influence the way audiences
think about current events.
On the positive side, the show constantly

raises issues like civil liberties and national
security, and portrays political debates with
obvious allusions to real politicians. These
plot points bring important issues to the at
tention ot viewers who may not regularly
follow current events, making fans of "24"
more likely to show interest when similar is
sues appear in the news.
Hut at the same time, there is the possi
bility that "24 "could replace news altogeth
er for some viewers, and the over-drama
tized events it presents to keep the adrena
line flowing could pervert the public's sense
of reality by creating a constant sense or
paranoia that is good for ratings, but not
necessarily for the general interest.
Ihe pervasiveness of torture in many of
the seasons distracts from the seriousness of
the matter. Bauer often has to extricate in
formation from terrorists by painful means
that would probably fit any textbook defini
tion of illegal interrogation. But because
Bauer is the good guy and has to work fast
to save the day.it often becomes too easy to
ignore any moral implications of his actions,
and accept the idea that everything he does
is for the greater good.
Furthermore, the constant portrayal of
Muslim terrorists as the source of threat op
portunistically plays off the public's fears
and perpetuates existing stereotypes that
all Arabs and Muslims are terrorists.
Though most Stanford students are able
to separate the entertainment value of the
series from its factual content, not taking
many of the over-t he-top plot twists as cred
ible depictions of the current political at
mosphere. next time you watch "24." it is
worth considering exactly how these ele
ments play into the excitement. We are con
fidant that our peers can make the distinc
tion between a fictional show and real life,
and we hope the rest of the 33 million view
ers will be equally discerning.
