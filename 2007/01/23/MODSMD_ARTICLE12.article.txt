I hate Apple. Don't be mistaken, this isn't
a gentle dislike. I despise the company,
their products and, above all else, their
customers.
When I see trendy young things tapping
away on their shiny Macßooks. bopping up
and down to their iPods or fellating their
lifesize model ol Steve Jobs. I feel an (al
most) uncontrollable urge to commit cruel
and unusual acts of punishment.
I am not.by nature.a violent man (I have
the musculature ot a malnourished urchin, vi
olence would be a particularly poor life
choice) but there's something about products
with the"i prefix that just makes me mad.
Ihere are many practical reasons to be
lieve the Mac is a pernicious influence on
the computer industry and that the products
in question don't quite live up to the propa
ganda. I lowever. I prefer to concentrate on
the more ephemeral.
It is not difficult to find appropriate
analogies for the Apple phenomenon. In a
way its remarkable that a thing can be
awful in so many different ways.
Presumably Mr. Jobs holds some sort of
( ommunist Utopian vision of what the
world should be like. A world where there is
only one computer, one operating system,
one music player, one phone and no free
dom to choose.
I imagine that this is the sort of mastur
batory fantasy Soviet apparatchiks would
hold dear a world of faceless drones in
grey, carrying their machines to and fro.
each and every one available only in black
or white.
On the other hand, whilst there may be
socialist dreaming, the reality is that Apple
embodies the worst excesses of capitalism.
Markets thrive on competition; Apple
thrives on ensuring it can never happen.
Epicycles of proprietary technology ensure
that once you're trapped in the labyrinth,
there's no choice.
As annoying as the company is, though, it
is the legions of acolytes that really feed my
bitter hatred and deep-seated revulsion.
It is a relatively popular pastime in the
technology press to compare Apple fanboys
(and girls) with cultists. Ibis, however,
seems a little unfair to the likes of Messrs
Cruise and Travolta. After all, at least Scien
tology makes us laugh.
Apple-worship, on the other hand, is a
humorless pastime, requiring slavish prod
uct devotion and bizarrely intimate expres
sions of love for one's iPod. Plus there's no
Xenu.
Iliose dreadful Mac vs. PC television ads
have few merits, but they do nicely capture
a certain kind of Apple user: The wannabe
creative.
Each evening, the cafes of San Francisco

are filled with people who spend their days
embarrasscdly scraping together a living by
working, but pass their nights living the dream
and "creating" (in fact, if everyone in the city
had as much to contribute to cultural enrich
ment as they thought they did, we would be on
the verge of a second Renaissance).
It is apparently the case that any deficit in
talent or inspiration can be made up with the
judicious purchase of a Macßook. Writer's
block is so much more meaningful when ac
cented by white plastic and glowing logos.
That indefinable idea of "cool" has been
neatly packaged up for sale (with the aid of
diverse-looking 20-somethings and hip
music) by the boys and girls at Apple. Even
more impressive, they've managed to mass
market the notion of uniqueness.
Hoards of folks buy M;ics, iPods and
whatnot in order to stand out from the
crowd. After all. nothing screams "Look at
me, I'm different!" quite like owning the
same computer as all of your friends.
Another thing that's a source of endless
puzzlement to me is the hero worship of Mr.
Jobs. After all. he's just a guy running a com
puter company.
Hi is devotion is especially odd when con
trasted with the reception Bill Gates general
ly gets from the same people. Without
launching into a tedious discussion of the rel
ative merits of the greatest charitable donor
in history and some dude who wears jeans,
presumably we can ;ill agree that whatever
the differences in achievements, they don't
merit the differences in public image.
11l ere are nice parallels between compa
ny, customers and products. Iliey all present
nothing to the outside world but image. It is
not so much style over substance, but some
seamless amalgamation of the two.
All of which means that this article is
pointless. No Apple user is going to read it
and suddenly realize the error of their ways
(or more to the point, acknowledge the
brainwashing). No. my criticism will slide off
the polished exterior casing.generating noth
ing more than a sotto voce "Apple-hater" or
a shake of the head at my ignorance.
Still, the ranting makes me feel better.

hash brownies. Alternatively, you could write
something about my article, but that would
kind of dull.
