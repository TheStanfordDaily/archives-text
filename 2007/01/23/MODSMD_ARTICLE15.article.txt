f~yt veil students protesting the University's
living wage policy briefly occupied Presi
dent John Hennessy's office Thursday,
performing a minute long interpretative skit
before leaving a deflated volleyball in their
wake..("Student's occupy Hennessy's office,"
Jan. 22).
I he Evening of Jan. 17:
ITie hour was late, the general feeling mis
erable. The Headquarters of the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition stank of coffee, per
manent markers and unrequited justice. A
pile of unfinished posters lay scattered across
the floor. It was time, all agreed, for a change.
"I just don't know if I can do this anymore,
friends," said Molly, tears in her freshman
eyes, her voice quivering like a timid violin.
"Whenever I think about the plight of our
workers. I just get so angry, and every time we
fail to force the Administration to institute a
living wage policy, I just get so sad. And then 1
get sadder because I 'm still so angry"
"That's quitting talk. Molly!" said Kip. the
handsome young Coxswain with a thirst for
social justice. "We all knew when we got into
the Labor Action game that it wasn't going to
be easy. Rome wasn't built in a day. It's like
what Henry David Thoreau writes in his Civil
Disobedience..."
Whilst Kip endeavored through passion
ate soliloquy to convince Molly to stay, there
was a rueful laugh from the corner of the
room, jaunty, without joy. Max Mumford was
the SLAC elder, a sixth-year double-coterm
still working on a thesis he had no intention of
finishing. Max's Coalition friends, the few he
had left, called him The Old Man; his enemies
called him quite a bit more.
Max had seen them come and seen them
go. Kip. with his unwashed ponytail and his
look-ma-I'm-in-college goatee, reminded
Max so much of himself â€” the glassy-eyed
idealism, the naive trust in man's inherent
goodness. When Max was a freshman, he'd re
ally believed he could change things at Stan
ford. He was out in White Plaza five days a
week with a megaphone and a message, ex
horting his peers to action, listing the employ
ees' grievances. Back in 2003. he hadn't eaten
for a week, part of the student fast that led the
administration to create PAC. the President
Advisory Committee on Workplace Policies
(those puppets!). Max spent the early years
demanding justice: then he started begging.
"Don't you guys care about workers'
rights?" he'd asked his friends, after PA( "s liv
ing wage recommendations accomplished ab
solute dick.
"Of course we do. Max. but who's got the
time for social justice?"
"But doesn't it bother you guys that some
workers need two jobs to support kids they
never see? Can you imagine that washing
dishes is the best you can do for the rest of
your life? Or cleaning rich kid vomit out of

sinks because stupid frat hoys don't even have
the common decency to puke in the toilet?
Aren't you angry that a university that makes
a $14 billion endowment claims that it's 'un
reasonable' to consider extending a living
wage to the people who need it the most?
I luman Resources? More like Inhuman Cru
elty. Diane Peck, you evil wench!"
"Whoa, dude, do you want to play Smash
Brothers?"
Max had begun to hate his fellow students
for caring so little, and also his fellow C'oali
tioneers for caring so much that it blinded
them to how pointless was their cause. Ideal
ism couldn't buy Palm Trees.
"To Hell With You. John Hennessy!" he
screamed at the constellations one night in
2005. a half-emptied bottle of Jimmy Beam
in his hand, the midwinter rain dropping
tears that Max was too broken to weep.
Later that night, he'd stumbled his way to
I lennessy's house and pissed upon the Pres
idential petunias. Small victories made for
proud defeats.
All for nothing, he ruminated now. staring
down the barrel of a life in academia."All for
nothing." he mumbled aloud. It was the first
time he'd spoken at a Coalition meeting in al
most two years.
"What's that. Max?" Barbara Billingston
was the Coalition Chair, a pretty face with a
schoolteacher's tone who feared Max nearly
as much as she despised him.
"All for nothing," Max said louder. "All the
rallies, all the demonstrations, the sit-ins. the
hunger strikes, the flyers. I've been at this for
longer than anyone, and I still have to explain
to people that no, I don't work at the God
damned Stanford Linear Douchefuck Accel
erator. We're a joke."
"There's no call for that negativity. Max,"
said Barbara.
"It's reality,sister," said Max.
"Max, you can't give up!" Kip exclaimed.
"You taught me everything 1 know. You're an
institution!"
"Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all
get respectable with age. I just got smart.The
administration doesn't care because they've
got alumni cash pouring out their ears and the
best lawyers in the nation tickling their
naughty spots. The students don't care be
cause they're tot) busy, or too selfish, or
maybe both. 1 don't know."
"Oh. Max. won't you please reconsider?"
A lone tear was streaming down Molly's

cheek. "Even if we can't change things for the
better, don't we have to try? Aren't we the
lone voice in the wilderness? Even if there's
no one around, a tree can still hear itself fall!"
"I'm all washed up, Molly doll. There's no
place left for social activism, not on this cam
pus, maybe not in this life. Nobody's listening.
I fell, those ditzy anti-Roe girls with the cute
little dead baby crosses get more press than
we do. I've got a thesis on Shakespearean
Iragicomedy that needs finishing. I've got my
own lite to think about, for once. Ihe Stanford
Working Man will have to fight for a living
wage without me. 1 sure didn't help any."
"Now Max. that's a bit extreme," said Bar
bara diplomatically. Good riddance, she
thought to herself, while the rest of the table
exploded with hubbub Last thing she needed
was some old has-been activist filling the air
with anti-positivity. The worst thing that can
happen to an activist is when they start believ
ing the truth.
"Hold the phone, fellas!" Kip cried. "Max
is right! We need our own cute little dead
baby crosses!"
"That wasn't my point at all." Max said.
"We need to create a whole new gosh
darned dialectic, something that'll grab peo
ple's attention and make workers' rights the
big issue on campus! Cut through all the
empty cliches of student activism, really
speak to the students, make the administra
tion hear us. think outside the box!"
"I ve got it! Molly's little face was wiped
free ol tears, her cheeks glowing rosy red with
naive passion. "How about performing an in
terpretive skit where we pass around a Vol
leyball labeled Living Wage Policy' to repre
sent how the administration keeps on passing
the responsibility without doing anything
about it?"
"Oh dear god," Max said.
"Lovely idea, Molly," Barbara said. "We
can all wear printed labels on our shirts. Who
wants to be Concerned Students?"
"Me!" "Oh Barbara, pick me!" "I call
Human Resources!"
"That's not enough. Barbara!" Kip bel
lowed. "We need to really send Hennessy a
message that there's a new SLAC in town,
that we re a force to be reckoned with. A
force to be reckoned with..." Kip tapped his
head, deep in thoughtful thought. "I know!
After we pass the ball for a minute, let's pop it
and leave it there, because a living wage, like
a volleyball, doesn't work if it has holes in it!"
Genius! "Brilliant!" "Wondrous
metaphor. Kip!"
"( apital idea!" Barbara clapped her
hands together once. "The popped volleyball
will be an eternal symbol of our solidarity!
rhat way his secretaries will HAVE to pass
the word of our brave, terribly true interpre
tive skit along to President Hennessy, who
