Fraga's race is an issue
While the Jan. 19 editorial.
"Reevaluating Fraga's Departure,"
recognizes the many skills of Profes
sor Luis Fraga, its attempts to di
vorce his race from his value as a pro
fessor are misguided. W.E.B. Du√üois
wrote that "the problem of the 20th
century is the problem of the color
line." Yet this editorial is a perfect ex
ample ot the fact that the problem of
the 21st-century is the problem of the
color-blind. 'The fact of the matter is

race matters. Fraga's race is inextri
cably linked to the great service he
provided this university because of
his ability to engage racial politics
and serve as a role model for other
Latino scholars. Given the embar
rassingly low level of diversity in our
faculty, it is crucial that the Universi
ty look for new professors of color to
help fill the void that Fraga left. Let
us not confuse color-blindness with
equality.
