## Support Stanford's sweat free campaign 
### THE SWEAT FREE COALITION 
Hie faces in Stern Dining last Wednesday were noth
ing out ot the ordinary. Students navigated through the
mass of bodies, intent on balancing trays laden with fuel
to keep their minds running for at least the next couple of
hours. Every so otten people picked each other out of the
crowd, and worlds would converge through words over
organic lettuce and complex carbohydrates. Our small
group ol seven the Action Committee for the Stan
ford Sweat Free Campaign—chose a table wedged in
the corner, and began to discuss the logistics of the up
coming Sweat-Free Week. Hie demands would be pre
sented to President I lennessey on Tuesday, Jan. 23. and
there was much to be hashed out. But as we discussed the
upcoming week, an important question arose. What was
the driving force behind this campaign? Why do we feel
that making Stanford Apparel "sweat-free" is important?
Many believe that it is impossible to live a life that in
every way adheres to the ideals of inherent human equal
ity. It seems unreal that we can have complete control
over the ripple effects of our daily actions when they seem
miniscule in comparison to world wide networks already
in place. I his is not true. As students at Stanford Universi
ty, and members ol an increasingly connected global com
munity, we are in the unique position to actively promote
these ideals. President I lennessey stated in his presenta
tion of the Stanford ( hallenge that it is necessary to"meet
the commitment made by Jane and Leland Stanford to
promote the public welfare by exercising an influence on
behalf of humanity and civilization.'"
But the changes we dream of cannot come about it
Stanford is a part of the problem. We must do everything
within our power to ensure that our business practices re
flect our values. Sourcing policies concerning Stanford ap
parel is the most poignant and logical place to start. Ap
parel bearing the Stanford insignia bears the reputation of
this university, and it is imperative that such symbols are
manufactured and distributed with moral integrity.
In a 2000 study commissioned by five universities in
cluding I larvard and the University of ('alifornia, it was
found that sub-par working conditions exist in apparel
factories in all seven countries they visited. Issues of con
cern included excessive work hours, limitations to free

dom of association and widespread health and safety
problems. To our knowledge. Stanford University does
not currently adhere to any labor standards for the pro
duction of its clothing or to any monitoring system that
ensures humane working conditions. We would like to
see this situation change.
Fortunately, there is a system in place for Stanford to
guarantee that theii clothes are not made in sweatshops.
ITirough independent monitoring, the consolidation of
lactones producing Stanford clothing and a factory certifi
cation process, the Workers? Rights Consortium (WRC)
and Designated Suppliers Program (DSP) ensure that fac
tory conditions are humane. Under this system, workers
are guaranteed a living wage, the right to unionize, free
dom from harassment and intimidation and a safe working
environment. Furthermore, by requiring licensees to sign
long-term contracts with their suppliers, the DSP will sta
bilize an industry known lor constantly shifting its produc
tion from country to country and provide garment work
ers with a reasonable level of job security.
Today. 166 schools, including Harvard, the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology, Brown and the University
of Pennsylvania, are all a part of the Workers' Rights
( onsortium (WR(') Thirty schools, including ('olumbia,
Cornell. Georgetown, Duke and the entire UC system,
have taken the next step by also joining the Designated
Suppliers Program (DSP). Clearly, the WRC and DSP
are well established and respected mechanisms through
which we can ensure the protection of fundamental
human rights in the manufacture of our apparel. As stu
dents. we ask that Stanford University take a vigorous
stand against sweatshops by affiliating itself with the
WRC and DSP.
We admire President Hennessey's initiative in con
-1 routing some ot the world's most pressing problems by
embarking on The Stanford Challenge. While we do not
expect licensees to support Stanford's entrance into the
WR( and DSP, we feel that Stantord's moral integrity
must remain paramount. Joining the WRC and DSP
presents the perfect opportunity for Stanford to do just
that.
