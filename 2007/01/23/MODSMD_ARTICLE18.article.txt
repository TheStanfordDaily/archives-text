## LAW SCHOOL Fair Use conflicts reach the Farm Internet era ushers in copyright questions 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIORS STAFF WRITER 
When English Prof. Carol Shloss
started work 011 her biography of
James Joyce's daughter Lucia, she
scoured primary source documents
011 the author for information rele
vant to her research.
Hut when the estate of James
Joyce caught wind of the project,
they "went out of their way to threat
en" both Shloss and her publisher,
according to Anthony Falzone. exec
utive director of the Fair I Ise Project
at Stanford Law School.
As a result, the publisher cut as
much as ten percent of Prof. Shloss'
content, which she instead posted on
a Web site.
From there, the legal battle
ramped up.
"We want an order by the court
that holds that Shloss' Web site does
not infringe on the estate's copy
right." said Falzone, who is on the
team representing Shloss. "Because,
amongotherthings.it is protected by
fair use."
"Fair use" is a term that entered
the books with the passage of the
Copyright Act of 1976, allowing
users to legally use copyrighted ma
terial under special circumstances.
Often, fail use is cited in scholarship
or review, though one common ap
plication today is when Web sites

post copies of song lyrics for listen
ers.
The Fair Use Project and Stan
ford's Cyberlaw Clinic are part of the
nascent ('enter for Intel net and Soci
ety at the Law School,started in 2000
and later bolstered by $2 million of
financial support from Google.
"It represents clients in non-com
mercial and commercial cases that
present compelling issues of fair use
and associated principles," a posting
on the Project's Web site says.
Conflicts like Shloss' have be
come more prevalent in recent years,
as the Internet has evolved and peo
ple have used it to host increasingly
diverse content.
With the proliferation of multi
media-sharing sites like
youtube.com, metacafe.com and my
space.com, court decisions regarding
fair use have taken on an added im
portance.
"When you think about the tools
available today to manipulate and
transform the media and culture
around you. it's astounding," Falzone
said. "You can do things today with
music and video - put them all to
gether, publish them on the net
that no one but a TV network could
do five years ago. With the explosion
of user-generated content sites, peo
ple have a lust for self expression."
But what comes next? That ques
tion stands before the Fair I >se Pro
ject and society at large today. While
many may not use these new tech
nologies to infringe copyright pro
tected content,countless others will.
I lie Fair Use Project represents

clients pro bono, whose cases "will
have an impact on the law. and
specifically cases that will help clari
ty. define and expand fair use rights."
according to Falzone.
llie Fair Use Project also repre
sents artists and musicians who face
legal troubles regarding copyright
law.
Documentary filmmakers, for ex
ample. often rely heavily on fair use
content.
Lawyers at the Fair Use Project
provide "legal representation to doc
umentary filmmakers who comply
with recognized fair use principles,
providing assistance during produc
tion. as well as a commitment to pro
vide defend them should litigation
arise," according to their website.
ha I zone pointed to the case of a
filmmaker working on a short video
he posted on youtube.com. in which
he used copyrighted music. After the
filmmaker received a cease-and-de
sist order from Universal Music, he
backed down. But then Fair Use Pro
ject lawyers "told Universal No. this
is fair use.' and sure enough. I hiiver
sal went away." said Falzone.
Thus, Falzone says one of the first
steps is for content owners to know
that there is a resource for them.
On a broader scale, though. Fal
zone sees the work he does as impor
tant in other ways.
"For me. what's at stake is whether
you will be merely a consumer of the
media culture around you. or will
you have the right and the ability to
speak back and be part of a dia
logue," Falzone said.
