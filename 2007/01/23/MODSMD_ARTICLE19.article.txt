# CAMPUS START-UPS
## New site lets users go bananas BananaLoop.com, launched last week, compiles campus events 
### 
l iver wish there was an easy way to find Stanford
events that you would he interested in? Inter Inter
net startup Banana Loop.com, which launched its
Web site last week.
"Banana Loop wants to make sure no one misses
out on interesting events happening around them."
said Banana Loop co-founder F-lbert I In. a bioengi
neering doctoral student who started the company
with his brother I lubert.
The Banana Loop site seeks to connect event
planners with possible attendees. Users create a pro
file of keywords, and event planners can narrow
down possible attendees based on their keywords.
"At a school with a social scene as lively as Stan
lord's, it's hard to keep up with what is going on," said
mechanical engineering graduate student Dan
Strickland."BananaLoop seems to fill a need by con
necting people with the things they like to do. I'm

surprised it wasn't thought of sooner."
Hubert Hu noted that the use of keywords can
sometimes be limiting. So in addition to keywords,
event planners ask questions to determine who
should be invited. Ibr example, students likely
wouldn't think to have "Lunar New Year" on their
keyword profile, so an event planner can instead in
vite people who respond in the affirmative that they
celebrate I unar New Year.
Elbert and Hubert llti plan to add at least two
new features to the website before spring quarter: an
RSVP function and the ability to create event distri
bution groups. Ilic latter would be useful for some
one like a resident advisor who wants to inform just
her residents about an event.
As the service matures, the two brothers hope to
expand it to other schools and cities.
"The idea is that if you're traveling or moving to a
new city, you will be instantly connected to all the in
teresting things happening in that area." Hubert Hu
said.
