## Dems and GOP, in a rare union Tressider event showcases bipartisan strategies for landing D.C. internships 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ihe Stanford Democrats and College
Republicans did something last night
that few of their counterparts in Wash
ington can boast: they worked together.
As co-sponsors of "Public Service In
ternship Night." both groups bridged the
partisan divide to offer students an in
depth look at how to apply for public
service internships at both state and
local levels.
" The truth is. though we might dis
agree ideologically at times, the Stanford
Democrats and the College Republicans
have at least one very important goal in
common: to help inspire interest in gov
ernment and policy on campus," said
senior and Denis President Bobby Lep
ore.
To meet this goal, both clubs joined
forces to provide students with a forum
in Tressider Union that showcased per
sonal anecdotes from previous public
service interns as well as insider tips on
how to land summer positions. They also
worked with the Career development
Center (CDC) and former interns to
compile a comprehensive list of public
service positions, which they distrib
uted to students attending the event.
Senior and College Republicans
President Megan Reiss and Lepore
both said that they were motivated to
sponsor the forum because they want
ed to make the I lerculean task of in-

ternship hunting easier for students.
"Navigating your way through the
political scene can he a lot about who
you know." Lepore said. "The CDC
offers a lot of great workshops, but we
thought a forum where students
could hear from their peers about the

opportunities that are available
specifically in public service was defi
nitely something that was missing."
Sophomore and Denis Political Di
rector Beth D'Aunno said she was ex
cited about the event because it pro
vided a unique student perspective.

"It gave students a chance to
hear a candid description of day-to
day life in various internships and
how those experiences have bene
fited students once they've re
turned to Stanford." she said.
"Often those are the kinds of an
swers that would be hard to wrangle
out of CDC advisors."
Lepore said the Dems have been
looking to work side-by-side with the
Republicans for some time. With the
conservative group rebounding from
a brief period of inactivity, bipartisan
cooperation is now possible, he
added.
"As for collaborations, this has
been a wonderful experience," Reiss
said."lt sheds light on our similarities
and non-partisan vision."
Lepore shared her sentiment and
said that he looked forward to future
collaboration between the organiza
tions.
"I think the leaderships of both of
our groups understand that we can be
very successful at motivating the stu
dent body to stay interested in gov
ernment when we collaborate," he
said. "1 think there's a recognition
that even when we disagree we are
still working to inspire civic engage
ment on campus and push the nation
al debate forward."
Junior Amber Davis expressed
mixed feelings about the event.
"I didn't really get an opportunity
to talk to anyone because there are so
many people here and far few intern
ship alumni to talk to." Davis said.
"But, the handouts were pretty help
ful. and I must say that they made an
effort to encourage students to reach
out to other students, which is more
than a lot of organizations on campus
can sav"
