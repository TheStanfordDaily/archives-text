## First win eludes struggling Card Close, but yet so far, as No. 2 BYU sweeps men 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Hosting undefeated No. 2 Brigham Young
this weekend, the men's volleyball team saw a
pair o! late rallies fall just short, as the Cougars
kept the Cardinal winless for another week.
BYU (6-0,4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration ) defeated the Cardinal (0-7,0-4) on Fri
day night, 30-23, 30-25, 30-28, and Saturday
night, 30-24,30-20,30-28, clinching the sweeps
with close wins in the third game of each match.
"In both matches, we did some good things
in the first two games and 1 was happy with the
way we played," head coach John kosty said.
"We gave up a couple of streaks that gave BYU
the separation they needed to win. In the end. it
just came down to an error or two by us. and
that's what rally scoring is about: you need to
play consistent volleyball through 30 points."
The Cardinal kept Friday's match close with
clean passing and tough serving, resulting in
two aces and only five errors compared to 13 bv
BYU.
The Cougars' hitting and blocking, however,
proved too much for the Cardinal. BYU had
five players hit over .400 on the night, while
junior outside hitter Matt Ceran was the most
consistent Stanford hitter at a .333 clip. Part of
the problem for the Stanford attack was a BYU
front line that notched 13 blocks in the match
against Stanford's eight.
Ceran led all players with 15 kills and fresh
man right side hitter Evan Romero posted 13.
"Matt Ceran has been playing better and
better," Kosty said."He is a transplant from the
middle and really coming along nicely on the
outside. And Evan Romero has been getting
good kills and picked up throughout the week
end. We have been relying on him more and
more to get us kills recently."
Freshman Garrett Werner was third on the
team with five kills and had a team-high four
blocks. Junior outside hitter Brian Skinner start
ed in the place of junior Jesse Meredith, who is
out indefinitely with an ankle sprain; he strug
gled offensively, but tied for second on the team
with two blocks and five digs. Senior libero
Brian Lindberg led in the back row with six digs.
After BYU's victory on Friday night, the
teams had less than 24 hours to regroup and
prepare for Saturday's rematch.
"We made some slight blocking adjustments
and a slight defensive change in aligning our
defenders that proved positive," Kosty said.
"What BYU adjusted was their mental attitude
coming into the second match. 1 think they re
alized that we are better than our record shows
and that we can compete.

They came out with their 'A' game on Saturday

The Cardinal took the first point of the
match on a kill by freshman setter kawika
Shoji, but that would prove Stanford's only
lead of the game. The Cougars took a 3-2 ad
vantage and did not even allow a tie down the
stretch.They built a seven-point lead late in the
game and, after three consecutive servers
missed, won the game on a kill by Russell

Romero had a game-high seven kills, but the

scored the next three points,
though, winning the game 30-2K on
a close out call.

good things and a couple of calls
didn't go our way," Kosty said.

Romero and Ceran again led the
Cardinal offense on Saturday, with
16 and 10 kills, respectively. Sopho
more middle blocker Brandon
Williams hit .667 with seven kills to
finish third on the team.
Romero and Williams tied with
Skinner with a team-high three
blocks, including a solo for Skinner.
Sophomore libero Jarod Keller led
with seven digs while Skinner had
five.
"Brian Skinner played outside
hitter the whole weekend and it was
his first time starting at outside,"
Kosty said. "Outside of his hitting

stats, lie did exactly what we needed
him to do and he played a solid role
for tis. He passed well both nights
and his solo block on their hitter,
C ala. in the third game gave us a ton
of momentum."
Despite remaining winless two
weeks into conference play, Kosty
remains confident about his team's
potential.
"Right now. we are at the point
where we are on the verge of win
ning matches," he said. "We are
competing with everyone we play,
we are playing an exciting style of
volleyball and we are getting better
in every game and every match."

Romero and Williams tied with

Sophomore libero Jarod Keller led
with seven digs while Skinner had
five.
"Brian Skinner played outside
hitter the whole weekend and it was
his first time starting at outside,"
Kosty said. "Outside of his hitting

stats, lie did exactly what we needed
him to do and he played a solid role
for tis. He passed well both nights
and his solo block on their hitter,
C ala. in the third game gave us a ton
of momentum."
Despite remaining winless two
weeks into conference play, Kosty
remains confident about his team's
potential.
"Right now. we are at the point
where we are on the verge of win
ning matches," he said. "We are
competing with everyone we play,
we are playing an exciting style of
volleyball and we are getting better
in every game and every match."
Hosting undefeated No. 2 Brigham Young
this weekend, the men's volleyball team saw a
pair o! late rallies fall just short, as the Cougars
kept the Cardinal winless for another week.
BYU (6-0,4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration ) defeated the Cardinal (0-7,0-4) on Fri
day night, 30-23, 30-25, 30-28, and Saturday
night, 30-24,30-20,30-28, clinching the sweeps
with close wins in the third game of each match.
"In both matches, we did some good things
in the first two games and 1 was happy with the
way we played," head coach John kosty said.
"We gave up a couple of streaks that gave BYU
the separation they needed to win. In the end. it
just came down to an error or two by us. and
that's what rally scoring is about: you need to
play consistent volleyball through 30 points."
The Cardinal kept Friday's match close with
clean passing and tough serving, resulting in
two aces and only five errors compared to 13 bv
BYU.
The Cougars' hitting and blocking, however,
proved too much for the Cardinal. BYU had
five players hit over .400 on the night, while
junior outside hitter Matt Ceran was the most
consistent Stanford hitter at a .333 clip. Part of
the problem for the Stanford attack was a BYU
front line that notched 13 blocks in the match
against Stanford's eight.
Ceran led all players with 15 kills and fresh
man right side hitter Evan Romero posted 13.
"Matt Ceran has been playing better and
better," Kosty said."He is a transplant from the
middle and really coming along nicely on the
outside. And Evan Romero has been getting
good kills and picked up throughout the week
end. We have been relying on him more and
more to get us kills recently."
Freshman Garrett Werner was third on the
team with five kills and had a team-high four
blocks. Junior outside hitter Brian Skinner start
ed in the place of junior Jesse Meredith, who is
out indefinitely with an ankle sprain; he strug
gled offensively, but tied for second on the team
with two blocks and five digs. Senior libero
Brian Lindberg led in the back row with six digs.
After BYU's victory on Friday night, the
teams had less than 24 hours to regroup and
prepare for Saturday's rematch.
"We made some slight blocking adjustments
and a slight defensive change in aligning our
defenders that proved positive," Kosty said.
"What BYU adjusted was their mental attitude
coming into the second match. 1 think they re
alized that we are better than our record shows
and that we can compete.

"It seemed like, even though they won in
three, they were disappointed about the oppor
tunity we had to win the third game on 1 nday.
They came out with their 'A' game on Saturday
and really stepped it up."
The Cardinal took the first point of the
match on a kill by freshman setter kawika
Shoji, but that would prove Stanford's only
lead of the game. The Cougars took a 3-2 ad
vantage and did not even allow a tie down the
stretch.They built a seven-point lead late in the
game and, after three consecutive servers
missed, won the game on a kill by Russell

Romero had a game-high seven kills, but the
Cougars tallied more kills, aces, digs and blocks
than Stanford in the frame.
In the second game as well. BYU pulled
ahead early and then charged to a victory. The
Cardinal fell back after a tie at 5-5, and the
Cougars' lead reached double digits during a
five-point service run for BYU's Yoslender
Cala.The Cougars won the game on a missed
Stanford serve, the ninth of the game and 13th
of the match.
The Cardinal prevented BYU from building
