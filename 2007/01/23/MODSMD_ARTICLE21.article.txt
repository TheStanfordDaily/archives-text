lost, the guys went out there and fought hard
the entire time. What really made a difference,
I think, was that we came together as a team.

"[The team] didn't give up." McCoy said.
They went out there with the idea that 'We
can win this match.' just went out there and
wrestled. And even in some of the matches we
lost, the guys went out there and fought hard
the entire time. What really made a difference,
I think, was that we came together as a team.

Freshman Alex Muller struggles out of a pre-season opponent's grasp. The Cardinal won their second-straight meet this past weekend against Cal
State-Bakersfield, 22-21, on the strength of No. 4 Tanner Gardner and No. 1 7 Josh Zupancic, who each built momentum for the team.
paced the squad with a pair of wins.
Mc( oy claims that the placement
of the two "big guns" in his lineup has
an immense impact on the confidence
of the rest of the team. No matter the
weight class at which the match starts,
Zupancic's and (iardner's matches
will be spread out,Mc('oy said,offer
ing two separate possible momentum
swings for Stanford.
"It's nice because you have that
no matter where the dual starts,"
McCoy said "11 we start out at 1125
pounds] we've got one, and if we start
off in the middle [weight classes]
we ve got one. It's really good to have
those two guys there — the other
guys really feed off of that."
Iliat much was evident Sunday.as
the dual opened at 149 pounds, where
sophomore Tyler Parker lost a major
decision in the opener, putting the
Cardinal down 4-0. But Zupancic fol
lowed with a major decision win of
his own, tying the match with the
heart of Stanford's lineup slated to
wrestle in the next three matches.
The Cardinal's lone senior, Brian
Perry, wrestled next at 165 pounds.

match away with a reversal in the
third period, en route to a 5-3 victory.
With the win. Perry continued a solid
season that McCoy believes could
signal big things on the horizon for
the team's co-captain.
"Brian has done a great job with
being consistent; |he's] one of the
most consistent guys in the weight
class." Mc( oy said. "So in our mind,
he's the guy that can win the confer
ence championship, and goon and be
an AIl-American. So it was a great
win for him. but it's just a stepping
stone for him to get to the end of the
year."

Stanford a 16-4 lead, the largest mai
gin of the day. Giesen 's pin was espe
cially meaningful, as it drew a big re
action from the Cardinal bench.
"Zack getting that pin it really
sparked the team on," McCoy said.
"Even though we lost four out of the
next five (matches], I realh think that
the momentum that we built made
the guys think that il they just went
out and did what they were supposed
to do that everything else would take
care of itself."
And so it did, as Gardner's win by
fall, along with the rest of Stanford
limiting the points they gave up to the

Roadrunners, was enough for the
('ardinal to carry the day.
"|Momentum| was definitely ;i hig
factor." McCoy said. "Last week we
believed.and went out there and doin
mated. Ihe guvs, they knew that Hak
ersfield was planning on coming in and
beating us. and they took that person
ally. livery team wants to go out and
win. but they took it like ' Ihey'ie not
going to beat us. and the fact that they
think that they're going to beat us is re
ally making us mad,' and they took
that to heart. It was really a total team
effort: guys got the job done and did
what they needed to."
