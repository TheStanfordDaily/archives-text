### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal kept building momentum for
their crucial late-season schedule in February,
eking out a close win over Cal State-Bakers
field on Sunday. In a match where the Stanford
wrestlers were clearly "the underdogs, at least
on paper." as head coach Kerry McCoy admit
ted, the Cardinal wrestled with confidence and
tenacity to defeat the Roadrunners.
"[The team] didn't give up." McCoy said.
They went out there with the idea that 'We
can win this match.' just went out there and
wrestled. And even in some of the matches we
lost, the guys went out there and fought hard
the entire time. What really made a difference,
I think, was that we came together as a team.

from familiar sources, winning the dual 22-21.
