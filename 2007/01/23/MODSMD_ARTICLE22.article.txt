# Breaking down the Pac-10
## 
### 
With the Pac-10 season nearly
halfway over, what better
time to take a quick look
around the league and hand out some
superlatives:
First, reprojedina the final Pac-10
standings:
1. Oregon — Top-to-bottom team
speed, plus ferocious home court
edge, overcomes a lack of size.
2. UCLA — A whisker away from
the Ducks, but the Bruins seem to
be playing with less passion than
last year.
3. USC — Conference's biggest sur
prise. Notable wins at Oregon and
at home against Arizona, plus a
dramatic, last-second loss to
UCLA.
4. Washington State — Demolished
Washington in a huge statement
game.The Cougars are ranked this
season for the first time since 1983.
5. Arizona — Lack ol a pure shooter
and pure center costing the athlet
ic Wildcats.
6. Stanford — Post play and just
enough scoring keeps eking out
theW's.
