# Breaking down the Pac-10
## 
### 
With the Pac-10 season nearly
halfway over, what better
time to take a quick look
around the league and hand out some
superlatives:
First, reprojedina the final Pac-10
standings:
1. Oregon — Top-to-bottom team
speed, plus ferocious home court
edge, overcomes a lack of size.
2. UCLA — A whisker away from
the Ducks, but the Bruins seem to
be playing with less passion than
last year.
3. USC — Conference's biggest sur
prise. Notable wins at Oregon and
at home against Arizona, plus a
dramatic, last-second loss to
UCLA.
4. Washington State — Demolished
Washington in a huge statement
game.The Cougars are ranked this
season for the first time since 1983.
5. Arizona — Lack ol a pure shooter
and pure center costing the athlet
ic Wildcats.
6. Stanford — Post play and just
enough scoring keeps eking out
theW's.

k Analysis
i
7. Washington — Awful start, but I
think a spirited stretch run is
around the corner.
8. California — Great start, but I
think the crash down to earth is
upcoming.
9. Oregon State — Keeps playing
everyone close. The Beavers wiil
upset someone big down the
stretch.
10. Arizona State — TTiis one, not so
much. Seem to have quit on their
coach. TTie Sun Devils are the
only easy win in the league.
Projected NCAA bids: Oregon (3-
seed), UCLA (4-seed), USC (6-
seed), Washington State (9-seed),
Arizona (11 -seed). Stanford (13-
seed. last team in — one can hope,
right?)
Midseason AII-Pac-10
Starting Five:
Aaron Brooks. Oregon — Faster
than anyone off the dribble.
Darren Collison. UCLA — League
leading 52 percent deep.
Marcus Williams, Arizona —
I .eague-leading 18.5 points per game.
Chase Budinger. Arizona —

League's best freshman in a league
stacked with youth.
Spencer I lawes. Washington — Visit
to Maples just about only off-night to
date.
Second Team:
Aaron Atflalo, UCLA — Numbers
are down, but importance to team is
not.
Nick Young. USC— 17 points per
game on 54.5 percent shooting. 45.5
percent deep.
Ryan Anderson, Cal— 17 points. 9
boards per game. Filling Powe's shoes
well.
Jon Brock man, Washington — Does
appear to take two steps before drib
bling though.
Robin Lopez, Stanford —On pace
to shatter school's freshman block
record.
Honorable Mention:
Mustafa Shakur. Arizona — League
leading 7.6 assists per game.
Marcel Jones, Oregon State —49
points in his last two games.
Kyle Weaver, WSU — Does it all:
shoots, steals, drives, defends, re
bounds.

Ivan Radenovich. Arizona — Gives
up inches, hut not guile, to other posts
in league.
Taj Gibson, USC — 63 percent
shooting, 9.2 boards per game.
Best Atmosphere: ()regon — The Pit
makes Sixth Man look like a Tuesday
night JV crowd.
Worst Atmosphere: Oregon State —
Would-be fans must be out enjoying
Corvallis' vibrant nightlife.
