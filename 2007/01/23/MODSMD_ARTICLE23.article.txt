## The
						6-foot-6 environmentalist Outside hitter Ceran thinks outside the box for his passions and future 
### BY ROXIE DICKINSON 
he intimidating 6-foot-6 junior
co-captain of the men's volley
hall team. Matt Ceran may look
like youi typical athlete. Making
sure to put emphasis on the "stu
dent" in student-athlete, though, his many
activities outside of volleyball set him apart.
But that doesn't mean Ceran isn't willing
to sacrifice himself for love of the game.
From practicing hours on end in high
school to spending his New Year's Eves and
spring breaks on campus. Ceran has man
aged to keep volleyball at the center of his
life
Playing competitively and bonding with
teammates has driven Ceran to want to pur
sue a professional volleyball career in Eu
rope or South America after graduating.
Ceran s journey to this point has been
long and rewarding. He has received abun
dant support from his family, especially his
father, who was often his coach in the years
before Stanford.
All of the help and Ceran's hard work
certainly paid off. with honors such as a
bronze medal in the 2002 Junior Olympic
(James and an MVP award in both 2003 and

2004 for the California lnterscholastic Fed
eration. I le was also a first-team all-tourna
ment honoree at the 2003 Junior Olympics,
leading his team to gold medals in the 2003
and 2004 games.
I his year, though Stanford has a small
team with only twelve on the roster, Ceran
and the rest of the Cardinal are working
hard to make the season the best it can be.
"This year's team is extremely dedicated
to volleyball" Ceran said. "We all love
coach [John Kosty). Every guy is willing to
put in the extra sprints and time to be the
best we can be to improve from last year's
rough season."
Ceran has had a great season up to this
point, especially after changing from a mid
dle blocker last season to an outside hitter
position. I le currently has a .236 hitting av
erage and leads the team with 13 solo blocks
and 45 block assists.
"He's still learning the position this sea
son. but he is growing as a player day by
day." Kosty said. "Right now, he's turning
into a good outside hitter, and by the end of
the season lie's going to be a great outside
hitter."

It was actually his best friend's older
brother who initially gave him the volleyball
bug and,alternatively helped him develop a
love of music.
"In middle school, my best friend and 1
decided to join the school volleyball team
and I have loved volleyball ever since," he
said. "I am also into hip hop and rap and
have been free styling for about six years
now."
Surprisingly, Ceran is also an environ
mental activist with strong feelings against
the government's current environmental
policy. I laving grown up among the polluted
water and air of Brentwood, Calif., near Los
Angeles,Ceran has been inspired to take ac
tion. I le explained that spending a month in
Peru and Ecuador was one ol the best times
of his lite. Seeing the amazing natural sur
roundings there, his love of the environment
expanded and has now become a potential
ly life-long interest â€” one that can coincide
with his hopeful professional career in
South America.
Though Ceran plans to continue his vol
leyball career, "I feel my true calling lies in
the Earth Systems field," he explained.
