## Raiders hire youngest NFL head coach in decades 
### GREG BEACHAM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
(AP) ITie Oakland Raiders hired Lane Kiffin
on Monday night, making the 31-year-old
Southern California offensive coordinator the
youngest NI L head coach in decades.
Kiffin, the son of Tampa Bay defensive coor
dinator Monte Kiffin. earned the job with a
strong interview Monday after the Raiders
failed to reach a deal last week with 32-year-old
Steve Sarkisian. Kiffin's fellow assistant to Pete
Carroll at USC.
ITie Raiders called a news conference for
Tuesday to announce the hiring.
Raiders owner Al Davis quickly moved to
land another up-and-coming offensive mind
with sterling college credentials, hut just one
season of Ni l. experience — as a defensive
qualitv control coach with Jacksonville in
2000.
At 31 years. 8 months, Kiffin is even younger

than I larland Svare. who took over the Los An
geles Rams in 1%2 at 31 y ears, 11 months. Svare
is listed by the Pro Football I lall of Panic's Web
site as the youngest coach in the modern era,
though younger coaches including George
I lalas led teams during the league's founding
years.
lint Davis has ample reason to trust in young
minds: Jon Grudeii. Mike Shanahan and John
Madden all succeeded as Raiders head coaches
in their 30s — as did I )avis.
Kiffin is 14 months younger than Madden
was when the I lall of l ame coach took over the
Raiders in 1%9. Dav is was 33 years, 6 months
when he took charge of the Raiders in 1%3.
Kiffin. a former Fresno State quarterback, is
younger than .it least nine players who finished
the season with Oakland during its NFL-worst
2-14 campaign, including defensive tackle War
ren Sapp. fullback Xack ( rockett and receiver
Alvis Whitted.
Coach Art Shell was fired after the season.

and Davis apparently was determined to hire
another young offensive-minded coach in the
mold of Gruden, his last successful hire. Davis
has fired three coaches in the last four years: Bill
Callahan. Norv Turner and Shell, whose return
to the Raiders lasted just one year.
Kiffin had been at USC for six years, ascend
ing from a job as tight ends coach to three jobs
last season as offensive coordinator, receivers
coach and recruiting coordinator. While former
Raiders assistant Sarkisian coached from the
sideline with Carroll last season. Kiffin called
the plays from the press box for the Rose Bowl
champion Trojans.
Sarkisian had two strong interviews with the
Raiders last week, but decided to stay at USC on
Friday night. Both claimed Sarkisian never was
offered the job, though numerous media reports
said Sarkisian turned the club down.
Davis first interviewed Kiffin on Thursday —
apparently to explore the possibility of hiring
Kiffin as the club's offensive coordinator.
