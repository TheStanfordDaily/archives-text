## On plane, squash to the rescue 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The men's and women's squash teams
endured a wild cross-country flight late
Sunday night that ended with a player
helping to restrain a passenger trying to
open an emergency exit door at 30,000
feet.
The teams, returning from a squash
tournament at Bowdoin College in
Brunswick, Maine, were aboard United
Airlines flight 178 from Boston to San
Francisco when things got interesting. Ac
cording to an affidavit written by FBI Spe
cial Agent Brian Gilhooly, passenger Erin
Callahan 1 .ambert went to the back of the
plane to talk on her cell phone. When
ilighl attendants told her to turn off the
phone, she "refused and became combat
ive." telling attendants she was calling 911
because the plane was being hijacked.
Lambert returned to her seat, but 20
minutes later, she took her pet dog and
luggage.and locked herself in the airplane
lavatory, refusing to obey flight attendant
demands. (iilhooly wrote that she told the
crew."You are going to have to kill me and
my dog."
Lambert left the lavatory moments
later and began to walk rapidly towards
the front of the plane. "I 'm getting off the
aircraft "she said.
She headed towards a cabin door, and
a llight attendant mobilized a couple of
passengers to assist in restraining
Lambert, who was kicking.screaming,
cursing, and spitting at flight atten
dants and passengers.
Men's team co-captain David Her
bert became suspicious when flight at
tendants asked him to return to his
seat and he saw two men standing by
the exit door. When Lambert began
charging down the aisle with her bags
in hand, he jumped into action.
"1 didn't know what was going on.
but then this woman ran up and was
clearly disturbed," he said. "The
flight crew was having trouble sub
duing her.so 1 jumped up and helped
grab her."
When Herbert took hold of Lam
bert's arm she taunted him, asking,
"What are you going to do, chicken
bone?" But Herbert, also Managing
News Editor at ITie Daily, said he was
unfazed.
"1 told her to shut up, and I
squeezed her arm tighter." he added.
Sophomore Ned Henningsen was
impressed with his captain.
"It shows how everyday people can
step up and become heroes," he said.
Several other passengers helped
restrain Lambert as she was hand
cuffed. Flight attendants then moved
her to an aisle seat in the middle of
the aircraft where she could be
watched.
Coach Mark Talbott has endured
numerous air travel mishaps with both
teams, including a player being hospi
talized before takeoff for dehydration
and frequent announcements from
the flight deck to announce that he. a
13-time world squash champion, is on
board. This incident, he admitted, set a
new standard.
"Everybody was a little freaked

out for a minute,just watching it ."Tal
bott said. "They restrained her really
quickly. In about 30 seconds or so,they
got her calmed down."
Authorities reported that Lambert
was intoxicated during her outburst,
an assessment that Cate Crowley, a co
terminal student in religious studies,
confirmed.
"She didn't act dizzy or slur her
words, but she was acting totally
crazy," Crowley said. "She wasn't
stumbling in the aisles and she was
more coherent than a drunk person in
her speech.but the things she was say
ing were completely ridiculous."
After the flight crew and passen
gers restrained Lambert, the plane
then prepared for a quick landing in
San Francisco.
"We started the most rapid descent
into San Francisco that I have ever ex
perienced," Crowley said. "It was like
a roller coaster drop — a steep de
scent the whole way down. We pulled
right into a gate and barely taxied be
fore police came onboard."
Five to six policemen on duty at the
San Francisco airport came on the
plane to take Lambert away. Accord
ing to Gilhooly, she refused an inter
view with the FBl,requesting an attor
ney.
United Airlines representatives
said they did not have any informa
tion about the incident, and a Trans
portation and Security Administra
tion security specialist could only
confirm for ITie Daily that the inci
dent occurred. Yesterday, federal
prosecutors charged Lambert with
assaulting a flight attendant and in
terfering with crew-member duties.
The midair excitement aside, the
teams had a strong weekend at Bow
doin.The men's team went 2-3 and de
feated St. Lawrence University and
Colby College in thrilling 5-4 decision.
ITie women went 3-2. downing rivals
Colby. Connecticut College and St.
Lawrence.
