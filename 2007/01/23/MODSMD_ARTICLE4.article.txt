### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On a campus overwhelmingly pro-choice,
the thirty-fourth anniversary of Roe v. Wade
passed yesterday with surprisingly little cele
bration but plenty of protest. Pro-life stu
dents turned out in stronger force than their
pro-choice peers, organizing more visible and
better-attended events.
For 10 hours, 464 white crosses dotted the
field outside the Bookstore in White Plaza.

The event, called "Remembering the Victims
of Roe." was organized by Stanford Students
for Life (SSFL) for the third straight year.
SSFL members also staffed a table at White
Plaza during the event.
Stanford Students for Choice (SSFC) did
organize some events, including a lunchtime
table in White Plaza and a panel discussion in
the evening. But while the SSFL event lasted
most of the day.the SSFC table was staffed
for only 45 minutes.
SSFL members estimated that about 200

people approached their table dm ing the day.
and countless more noticed the crosses as
they biked or walked by. Fhe\ added that
nearly all their flyers were taken by passersby.
In contrast, the SSFC evening panel at
tracted only 40 people.
"In the past, it [SSFC activity] has ap
peared as a reaction to our event." said senior
Dan Cervantes,co-president of Stanford Stu
dents for Life, though he acknowledged that
the panel discussion this year was planned in
advance.

SSI C members did admit that their events
on the anniversary are often in response to
pro-life protests.
"I think m a lot of ways it is a reaction "
said junior Mishan Araujao. Co-president of
SSI C. "We don't feel the need to he in White
Plaza all day. We were just there for people
upset by the SSFL event."
