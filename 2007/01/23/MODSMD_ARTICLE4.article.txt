## Roe v. Wade anniversary sees pro-life protestors outnumber pro-choicers 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On a campus overwhelmingly pro-choice,
the thirty-fourth anniversary of Roe v. Wade
passed yesterday with surprisingly little cele
bration but plenty of protest. Pro-life stu
dents turned out in stronger force than their
pro-choice peers, organizing more visible and
better-attended events.
For 10 hours, 464 white crosses dotted the
field outside the Bookstore in White Plaza.

The event, called "Remembering the Victims
of Roe." was organized by Stanford Students
for Life (SSFL) for the third straight year.
SSFL members also staffed a table at White
Plaza during the event.
Stanford Students for Choice (SSFC) did
organize some events, including a lunchtime
table in White Plaza and a panel discussion in
the evening. But while the SSFL event lasted
most of the day.the SSFC table was staffed
for only 45 minutes.
SSFL members estimated that about 200

people approached their table dm ing the day.
and countless more noticed the crosses as
they biked or walked by. Fhe\ added that
nearly all their flyers were taken by passersby.
In contrast, the SSFC evening panel at
tracted only 40 people.
"In the past, it [SSFC activity] has ap
peared as a reaction to our event." said senior
Dan Cervantes,co-president of Stanford Stu
dents for Life, though he acknowledged that
the panel discussion this year was planned in
advance.

SSI C members did admit that their events
on the anniversary are often in response to
pro-life protests.
"I think m a lot of ways it is a reaction "
said junior Mishan Araujao. Co-president of
SSI C. "We don't feel the need to he in White
Plaza all day. We were just there for people
upset by the SSFL event."

Stanford Students for Life placed 464 white crosses in White Plaza to commemerate the 464,000 abortions performed in the United States since the passage of Roe v. Wade 34 years ago.
members say that their campaign to
commemorate Roe v. Wade contin
ues through the year, while SSFL ac
tivism is concentrated on one day.
Other pro-choice activity at
White Plaza was notably muted and
seemed spontaneous and poorly or
ganized. According to multiple
sources, a group of students not

known to be affiliated with any stu
dent group brought a stick into
White Plaza with a baby doll im
paled on top. Most observers agreed
that it was a mockery of pro-life ac
tivism. and SSFL. members threw
the object away after its creators left
it there.
And while the SSFL demonstra
tion attracted students well into the
afternoon, the only pro-choice advo
cates to be found were three students
standing alone a few yards away.The
posters they held were hastily made
just moments earlier in the Book

store.
"We think the cemetery over
there is very morbid, and we just
wanted to do a counter-protest," said
freshman Jon Canel. The other two
students, both international, said
they were unclear on what Roe v.
Wade meant.
1 lowever. not all students were as
offended by the crosses as those
three.
"It's a very respectful way to
make your point." remarked junior
Aaron Polhamus."lt reminds me of a
war memorial."

Others criticized the SSFL event
for the effect it had on young women
who may be contemplating abortion.
"Using murder as a premise
makes women who are already vul
nerable more vulnerable." said
Araujao, echoing a sentiment other
students repeated.
Many passerby also criticized the
use of crosses as an overtly Christian
symbol for a group allegedly inde
pendent from religion.
"We definitely recognize that it's
a precarious symbol to use a cross,"
Cervantes said."But what better uni

versally recognizable symbol of
death is there than a cross in the
ground?"
Each cross, sized 8 by 12 inches,
each represented 1 ()().()()() abortions,
though SSFL members were quick
to point out that the crosses were
also meant to echo the men and
women affected by abortion, whom
they see as victims of Roe v. Wade.
"The main purpose is to memori
alize what we see as a very bad thing
in our society and to start some dia
logue in our community," Cervantes
said.
