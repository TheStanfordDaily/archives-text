## Iraq policy attacked 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
On the eve of President Bush's State of the
Union address, three prominent Stanford pro
fessors have called for a "new way forward" in
Iraq, condemning the administration's new
plan for the increasingly unpopular war as
"too little, too late."
In a noontime panel yesterday in Encina
Hall, Management Science and Engineering
Prof, and former Secretary of Defense
William J. Perry said that Bush's "surge" plan
to send 21,(KM) additional troops to the war
torn nation would do little to fix the "disas
trous security situation" on the ground there.
"It's obvious that we're in a very big hole,"
Perry said, adding that the president's plan
was "tactical and not strategic" and "only
deepens the divide in our country."
A member of the bipartisan Iraq Study
Group, whose recommendations Bush largely
ignored, Perry admitted he was "conflicted"
about reports that Congress would attempt to
halt Bush's aims by cutting funding for the
troop escalation.
"It's very difficult to execute that in prac
tice." he said, after pausing for several seconds
to respond to a question from the audience.
One of Perry's counterparts on the panel.
Hoover Senior Fellow Larry Diamond, was

more explicit in his calls for Congressional
oversight over any emerging conflict in the
Middle Hast.
"We have a chance to get it right now, in
terms of not bombing Iran," he said.
Diamond, who served as an advisor to
Iraq's provisional government in 2004 —
work which led him to author a book titled
"Squandered Victory" — did not mince
words in la> ing out a policy proposal that in
cluded greater accountability on the part of
Shiite Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's
government, dialogue with secular insur
gents and nearby Arab states and assistance
from the United Nations and European
Union.
"This is one of the biggest foreign policy
blunders in American history," he said, adding
that Bush's plan for additional troops was
"painfully reminiscent of Vietnam."
Echoing the words of Democratic Senator
and former presidential candidate John Kerry,
Diamond mused. "I low do you ask someone
to be the last man or woman to die for a mis
take?"
'ITie third member of the panel. Political
Science Prof, .lames I earon. warned that
"adding some brigades hardly brings us closer
to a self-sustaining Iraq."
Instead, he advocated a "stand-back, bal
ance" policy that would redeploy U.S. troops

to gain additional leverage with Iran and
Syria.
Echoing the Iraq Study Group's calls for
redeployment of military forces in the region.
Perry agreed.
"The army is dangerously close to being
broken," he said, citing interviews with top
generals in Iraq who agreed that additional
troops was not the answer to quell growing vi

olence and instability in and around Baghdad
lor his part. Perry expressed hope that the
growing unpopularity of the war would tem
per the president's plan for deploying addi
tional forces. Hie looming presidential elec
tions in 2(H)S. he said,could play .1 critical role
"If a sufficient amount of Republicans con
sider that this will be disastrous," he said,
"that's the kind of pressure we need."
