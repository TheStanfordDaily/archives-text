## BUSH TO FOCUS ON DOMESTIC AGENDA President's first State of the Union with Democrats in power 
### BEN FELLER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush
will tell Americans Tuesday night he has im
portant plans for health care, education and
other kitchen table topics that have little to
do with Iraq. Yet if the.' state of the union is
strong, so is the nation's skepticism that he
can deliver.
For the first time. Bush will give his State
of the Union address with Democrats in
power and looking over his shoulder—liter
ally, with I louse Speaker Nancy Pelosi seat
ed right behind him. Most people have no
confidence that Bush and a Democratic Con
gress can solve problems together, a trou
bling sentiment that has only deepened since
the November election, an Associated Press-
AOE News poll finds.
I he p.m. EST speech is a chance for
Bush to pull his domestic agenda out from
the shadow of the Iraq war, if only briefly. So
Bush will locus on issues he hopes will appeal
to mainstream America—and to Democrats
on Capitol Hill, shifting pressure onto them
to govern.
"He's got to he convincing, so that the
American people believe that he's serious
about working in a bipartisan way." said
Charlie Black, a longtime Republican strate
gist and informal White House adviser. "II
there's one headline they'd like to have out
of this, that would be it."
The president is expected to address:
—I iealth care: Bush will propose a tax de
duction of $7,500 for individuals and $15,000
for families regardless of whether they buv

their own health insurance or receive med
ical coverage at work. I iealth care insurance
would he considered taxable income, and
people with more generous policies could
face tax increases unless they change plans.
I'he administration says its plan will help
people who buy insurance individually
rather than through their employers.The ad
ministration says the tax deductions will
allow more Americans to buy insurance.
—Energy: Bush is expected to call for a
sharp escalation of corn-based ethanol as a
gasoline blend. I le also may seek the power
to raise fuel economy standards for passen
ger cars, probably as part of a plan to offer fi
nancial incentives for increasing alternative
fuels. The auto industry has resisted upgrad
ed mileage requirements and stressed a need
for vehicles fueled by alternatives such as
ethanol. Diesel and eventually hydrogen.
Bush asked for the same authority last year.
Some Democrats worry the plan would give
transportation officials overly broad author
ity to change the system and note the meas
ure would not have any impact on current
gas prices.
—Education: Bush will push for Congress
to renew his education law. No Child Left Be
hind. which expires this year. Democrats
have already signaled their intention to work
with him but will expect him to go along with
increases in spending.The law pushes schools
that receive federal poverty aid to show year
ly progress or face sanctions, including allow
ing students to transfer or demand extra tu
toring.
Bush will also push for an immigration
strategy that includes more than tougher
border security.
Meanwhile, bitter feelings over the war
stand in the way of the principal goal of the
speech—a bipartisan agenda.
Just about everything Bush wants to do is

dependent on a Congress in which even
some Republicans are resisting his ideas.
Within a day of his speech, the Senate For
eign Relations Committee is likely to vote on
a resolution condemning his move to send
more troops to Iraq.
No matter the emphasis on domestic is
sues. Bush cannot skirt the war.and he has no
intention of trying.
Without rehashing the Iraq speech he
gave two weeks ago. Bush will defend his
stand that Iraq is part of a war on terror that

will make Americans safer. That contention
will come during a foreign policy passage in
which Bush will also tout U.S. humanitarian
efforts abroad.
Since Bush announced his latest Iraq
plan, the White House has pointed to signs of
progress by the Iraqi government on both
political and security fronts. Yet U.S. forces
and Iraqi civilians have also endured some of
the heaviest, bloodiest attacks of the war.
Coming after his Iraq speech, which had
an enormous buildup. Bush's sixth State of

the Union approaches with an anticlimactic
feel. The Democrats and Republicans who
want his job are already making headlines
even though the 2008 election is still 22
months away.
With that in mind. Bush's aides took steps
to keep the speech concise and relevant.Top
ics that might have made the cut in other
years—such as recent advancements in can
cer research and a drop in cancer-related
deaths—have been set aside, often for sepa
rate events.
