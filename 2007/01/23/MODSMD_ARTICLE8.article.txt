I EHRAN. Iran (AP) - Iran has barred
38 nuclear inspectors on a United Nations
list from entering the country, the foreign
minister said Monday in what appeared to
be retaliation for the U.N. sanctions im
posed last month.
Hie rejected officials are on a list of po

tential inspectors drawn up by the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency to visit and
monitor Iran's nuclear facilities.
"The act of rejecting some inspectors
is legal and in accordance with the
agency's regulations," Foreign Minister
Manouchchr Mottaki told the official Is
lamic Republic News Agency. He said
others on the U.N. nuclear watchdog's
list remain eligible, but did not explain
how Iran decided which inspectors to
bar.
ITie lAEA "submits a long list of inspec
tors to member countries and the countries
have the right to oppose the visit by some

inspectors," Mottaki said.
Last month, the U.N. Security Council
imposed limited trade sanctions on Iran
over its refusal to cease uranium enrich
ment, a process that can produce the mate
rial for nuclear energy or bombs.
Days later, the Iranian parliament
passed a motion that obliged the govern
ment to revise its cooperation with the
lAEA, but gave it a free hand to determine
the steps to be taken.
lAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming
and other agency officials did not immedi
ately return after-hours calls from The As
sociated Press.

The United States rebuked Iran for the
move. State Department spokesman Sean
McCormack said it was "another example
of the Iranians trying to dictate the terms to
the international community—in this case,
the lAEA."
The United States and some of its allies
accuse Tehran of trying to develop nuclear
weapons. Iran denies this, saying its pro
gram is only to produce nuclear energy.
Iranian hard-liners had urged the gov
ernment to respond to sanctions by abro
gating the Nuclear Non-proliferation
Treaty—the agreement under which the in
spections are held.
