## Plan for peace reboots Fervish diplomatic activity surrounds Mideast negotiations 
### AMY TEIBEL ASSOCIATED PRESS 
JERUSALEM (AP) — After months of
inaction, a flurry of diplomatic activity to
ward reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace
making is under way.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is
planning a summit with Israeli and Palestin
ian leaders, top Israeli officials are floating
peace initiatives and the moderate Palestin
ian president says he is ready to discuss the
outlines of a final settlement.
But with Hamas militants dominating
the Palestinian parliament and Cabinet,and
weak leadership on all sides, no one expects
a deal any time soon.
Hie U.S. and Israel are trying to build on
the "road map" peace plan by initiating con
fidence-building steps such as easing finan
cial sanctions on the Palestinians and lifting
West Bank roadblocks. They are also hold
ing out the prospect of more wide-ranging
concessions to help Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas in his power struggle
against Hamas militants.
"We're at the pre-negotiation stage where
the emphasis is on confidence-building meas
ures," Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, said Monday.
"But we're not talking about the substance."
The 2(X)3 road map—which outlines a
staged plan for creating a Palestinian state
alongside Israel —never got off the ground
because each side failed to meet its initial
obligations. With the Israeli-Palestinian

peace process in deep freeze since 2000. and
the political rise of I lamas in the Palestinian
territories, moderates on each side have
found themselves with little choice but to
start talking again.
We're at the pre
negotiation stage
where the emphasis
is on confidence
building measures.
MIRI EISIN,
Spokeswoman for Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
In the past few weeks, the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders held their first substan
tive meeting, and Israel followed up by
transferring $100 million in frozen tax rev
enues to Abbas.
Rice has promised to lead a summit with
Abbas and Olmert by mid-February, and is
talking about reinvigorating U.S. involve
ment in Mideast peacemaking.

Meanwhile, the estranged leaders of the
two most powerful Palestinian factions,
Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal,
met over the weekend in Syria to try to put
together a governing coalition that could
negotiate with Israel. Though they did not
reach agreement, they said they would con
tinue the dialogue.
Early next month, the so-called quartet
of Mideast peace brokers who launched the
road map—the U.S.. the European Union,
Russia and the U.N.—also plan to meet to
explore ways to re-energize peacemaking.
Sharp differences have emerged between
the Israeli and Palestinian positions, howev
er.The Palestinians oppose an Israeli propos
al for a provisional Palestinian state in the
West Hank and Gaza, believing Israel could
use it to usurp land while the sides negotiate
endlessly over so-called final status issues.
It is precisely the big-picture issues—

final borders, the status of disputed
Jerusalem and the Palestinians' demand to
repatriate refugees and their descendants—
that have caused past peace talks to collapse.
"We are for negotiations on a final status
agreement, even if there are (confidence
building) steps," said Nimr Hammad, a po
litical adviser to Abbas. "But (those steps)
must be tied to a final status agreement."
The failure to reach agreement at the
Abbas-Mashaal meeting bodes poorly for a
resolution that could end months of Pales
tinian infighting. With Hamas holding so
much power. Abbas' room for maneuvering
in negotiations with Israel could be severe
ly limited.
If the international community wants to
move ahead in a meaningful peace process,
"we have to get our act together internally,"
said Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian ne
gotiator.
