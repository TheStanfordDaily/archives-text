Hezbollah-led protesters burned
tires and cars and clashed with gov
ernment supporters Tuesday, para
lyzing Beirut and areas across
Lebanon in the worst violence yet in
the pro-Iranian group's campaign to
topple U.S.-backed Prime Minister
Fuad Saniora.
At least three people were killed
and dozens injured as the two camps
battled each other around street bar
ricades with stone-throwing and in
sonic cases gunfire. Black smoke
poured into the sky over Beirut from
burning roadblocks.
The fighting quickly took on a
dangerous sectarian tone in a coun
try whose divided communities
fought a bloody 1975-1990 civil war.
Gunmen from neighboring districts
in the northern city of Tripoli—one
largely Sunni Muslim, the other
largely Alawites, a Shiite Muslim off
shoot—fought each other, causing
two of the fatalities.
The day gave a frightening

glimpse of how quickly the con
frontation between Saniora's gov
ernment and the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah and its allies could spiral
out of control, enflame tensions
among Sunnis, Shiites and Christians
and throw Lebanon into deeper tur
moil.
In the evening, the opposition an
nounced it would call off the road
blocks and the nationwide general
strike that sparked the unrest, saying
it had delivered a warning to the gov
ernment. But it threatened more
protests.
Opposition supporters began
withdrawing from their street block
ades, leaving behind burning tires,
concrete blocks and debris. At one
abandoned roadblock in the north of
Beirut,a fire engine extinguished the
burning tires.
Suleiman Franjieh. a Christian
opposition leader, told Hezbollah's
Al-Manar TV the next steps "will be
nothing compared to uhat we saw
today" if the government does not
respond to the opposition's de
mands.
The Hezbollah-led opposition is
growing increasingly frustrated after
two months of sit-in protests outside
Saniora's offices in downtown Beirut
failed to force him to step down or
form a new government giving the
opposition more power.
Saniora vowed not to give in. say

ing in a televised address: "We will
stand together against intimidation
and to confront sedition."
But he repeated his willingness to
discuss a political solution to the im
passe and called for a special session

of Parliament.
The violence called into question
whether Saniora will be able to at
tend a conference of donor nations
in Paris onThursday aimed at raising
billions in aid for rebuilding the dev-

astation wreaked on Lebanon by
last summer's Israel-Hezbollah war.
Saniora has been expected to at
tend and the suspension of the strike
increased the likelihood. But the
government has not made a formal

announcement about his travel
plans.
Cabinet Minister Ahmed Fatfat
told Lebanon's New TV that the
economy and finance ministers al
ready were in Paris.
