# When will we be in the mood for a serious film?
## 
### 
I" have seen "Old School" lour times and
"llie Big I .ebowski" three. I've watched
"Zoolander" once in the theaters and
twice on DYI). and I've seen every Will
1 ; are 11 movie that has been made.
1 get it when a friend misses a turn, has to
circle around one-way streets to get back
on track and says,"l'm not an ambi-turncr."
1 smile knowingly when Over McShare
warns (loody Me lwo-Shoes that she might
want to put on her earmuffs. My familiarity
with the realm of college comedies, howev
er. does not actually reflect my taste in
movies (although admittedly, I did really
like Will's "Stranger lhan l'iction"...and
"I If"). I have seen all of these films too
main a-time because of social ami-twisting
and brutish peer-pressuring: once I get to
gether with friends, as a collective group we
are never, and I mean ever, in the mood for
a serious film.
Now I agree that movies, like icecream
and earrings, should be selected depending
on the specific mood of the aforementioned
chooser's (or choosers') present disposi
tion. Some days, you wake up and arc ready
for the beaded, peacock-feather earrings
your bestie just got you from her semester
abroad,and some days you just need a dou
ble waffle cone with a scoop of Very Ikrry
Strawberry and (iold Medal Ribbon. You
aren't going to be keen on watching "Re
quiem for a Dream "every day.either.
But it seems that it is never the right set
ting for watching any movie where boy does
not meet girl, boy does not get girl and
sex/fart/tranquili/er gun jokes are not in
volved. Is it because friends mean a party, a
party means fun and fun means frivolity?
Granted, company by and large creates a
light-hearted mood,and to keep that casual
and congenial atmosphere afloat there is no
crime in calling upon Stiller,or perhaps San
dler, to provide a respeetable-hour-and-a
half of entertainment. But. if when I am with
friends I never see a serious film, and I am
always with friends when I see films, then by
applying the transitive property, carrying
the two and dividing by pi, it would appear
that I haven't seen a real movie since the
time I watched "Princess Bride" twice after
I broke up with my freshman year boyfriend
(I wanted to believe there was still magic
and true love in the world). < )r the one time
I was sick in college and watched "I ternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind by myselt
on a lonely I riday night. Excluding these
two notabie exceptions, however, for the
past four years. Blue has been my boy. her
tattoo might as well have been a bull's-eye
and it turns out she is not his special lady but
his lady friend.
Wliv don't we want to watch serious

films with friends? Is it because a good film
demands too close a focus? Would be 100
much of a mood-kill? Because it's too awk
ward to watch Kevin Spacey's conservative
and voyeuristic neighbor misinterpret his
marijuana-dealing son's kneeling and
rocking movements as a homosexual ad
vance?
(iod knows my friends and I don't read
the same books, if we read any thing outside
of class at all. or in class, really, for that mat
ter. Music tastes vary wildly, and even il you
can discuss an artist with a fellow listener.
I'll bet you more often than not the lyrics
are too jumbled or bizarre to understand.
Which leaves us. once again, with the fea
ture film, an expansive art form which, in
fact, encompasses many different types of
movies, some of which don't star old SNI
cast-members.
In fact, sometimes other nations make
movies. Sometimes movies don't end up
with a not so good-looking male comedian
getting a very good-looking girlfriend.
Sometimes, movies are poignant, thought
provoking and even sad.
Assuredly, I have laughed at Borat and
his unimaginably uncomfortable neon
Speedo, and I have cheered for l'rank the
lank right along with the best of them. But
1 have also been baffled In and ultimately
triumphant over the backwards timeline of
"Memento," just as I have been wowed by
the dreamlike Paris of "Amelic" and the
stunning cinematography in "Lawrence of
Arabia."
I am not saying comedy has no place in
film â€” after all, Princess Bride is my all
time favorite movie. But making lis laugh
and providing college students with memo
rable quotables is just one of the many
things that films can do. And every once in a
blue moon. I'd like to see a movie without a
punch line, a trusty and farcical sidekick, or
topless women wrestling in a kiddie pool of
KY jelly. I'd like to see a real movie with my
friends. And maybe even have some real
conversation about it afterwards
