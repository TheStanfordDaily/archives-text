# At least he's consistent...
## I could write doctor shows 
### Paul Craft 
In the wake of the success of "Grey's
Anatomy." "I louse" and"I R." I feel the
market for doctor dramas is at its height.
Now. 1 need to find a way to cash in. So I'm
going to make my own show.
In this doctor show. I need a sympathetic
and charismatic but at the same time deeply
flawed individual: "House" is a complete
jerk, the lead woman in "Grey's Anatomy"
always looks like she just woke up and
George Clooney isn't even on "I K" any
more. I think my doctor will defy moral con
ventions. the hypogriffin oath will be Haunt
ed- he'll routinely put his patients' lives in
jeopard) and slay innocent hypogriffins. I le's
also a recovering mescaline addict.did I men
tion that? Well he is. but he has a chiseled and
unshaven chin and is therefore lovable. But
ambiguously lovable.
I lis mescaline habit is more of a quirk, re
ally, and it's only suggested that it actually al
l'ccts his work in a two part episode. But in
that episode, he's so high he untucks his shirt
and is more rude to his patients than normal.
I le learns a valuable lesson.
Patient: "Doctor, I'm deeply depressed
and my kidneys have shut down."
Hunky Doctor: "You don't deserve to
live."
Audience:"! laha.he'sso witty. But inside,
you know he's hurting."
Real doctors: "wtf?"
I a Ist> need some kind of inexplicable and
anachronistic set of diseases that alllict my
local hospital. Somehow, the bubonic plague
hits northern New Jersey.
Hie entire staff gels chicken pox and for
some reason only gets sexier. Kubla Khan s
DNA is found in a young boy and only my
sympathetic doctor knows how to cure him
before he eats/pillages the entire hospital!
'Iliere needs to be a supporting cast of

characters that each have their own
drug/sex/social addiction that they must
overcome, But none of them lias a chiseled
chin like my hunky doctor, and so none of
them knows about the obscure Amazonian
crocodile that is eating a patient's pancreas.
Only the hunky doctor knows the truth, but
the other doctors who "follow the rules" and
"believe in moral accountability" make his
job more difficult 011 a weekly basis. Hiey all
wish they had a stubbled chin like his.
Ihen of course there is the sex. 1 gotta
have lots of sexual tension in the show. It
doesn't really matter if there isn't any chem
istry between the characters; it's the awk
wardness of the relationship that creates the
drama. One of the head doctors has a hand
injury so his lover has to secretly perform his
surgeries for him. One doctor asks her boss
out 011 a date and the entire team questions
her decision as a patient lies dying. Charac
ters sleep with their bosses, their workmates
and their patients. In season five of "Grey's
Anatomy", controversy stems from Dr.
Steven's decision to date her patient's un
born fetus while I )r. Shepard finds himself in
creasingly attracted to a chair.
The entire point of sexual tension is for
later on. when I have to kill the characters off.
I of course need to have the doctors die in the
hospital, preferably under the knife of their

lovers or friends, Ihat's what makes televi
sion show gripping, so real. And unlike the
parade of guest stars that appear on the
shows with bad cases of Dadaism. the doctor
characters 011 the show will be ol'fed in ridicu
lously inept and ironic ways. One walks in
front of a bus. Another wanders into Newark.
One of the least talented cast members wan
ders off into 1 lollywood and just kind of calls
in their role from then 011. Terrible, ironic
tragedies—all of them.
Near the end of my shows season, the en
tire hospital will go 011 some kind of lock
down or alert. Bomb threats, some airborne
virus and November sweeps, whatever- the
hospital needs to crank up the tension STAT.
I think it be cool if a rival group of doctors
came in and tried to out do the other doctors.
Like, an anti-lovable cast of characters, lhey
have questionable means or they go by the
book —whatever is the opposite of my cast.
My dreamy male lead has a foil who looks
just like him (complete with a listless love in
terest) but with an eye patch! Iliat way you
know he's evil. McTvil. even. 'Ihe show cul
minates in a pseudo-family double-dare mo
ment where fake blood and other fluids are
splaying everywhere as both teams race to
save the most amount of people possible
after the Knicks break free from their prison
and run amok among the local populace.
William 1 1. Maey guest stars as the unsympa
thetic hospital director who puts his patient's
lives at risk for economic gain. Oh. and he
and my dreamy doctor use to be rival street
fighters or something.
'Hie show practically writes itself.

Chris thinks "House" should he just culled
" House's Anatomy" because that's what every
body wants to see anyways. Send c<anplaints to
