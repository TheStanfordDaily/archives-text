## Challenge Us 
### TOD CHUBRICH 
On October l()th President I Icnncssy of
ficially launched the Stanford Challenge, a
4.3 billion dollar campaign that includes
among its chief objectives the pursuit of solu
tions tii"pressing global problems."'!liis is an
admirable goal, and a reassuring one: it indi
cates a vision commensurate with the univer
sity's considerable resources, both tangible
and intangible. Quite apart from the timeless
question of how to make a million (four
thousand three hundred times over, no less),
the implementation of this vision raises a
number of other vital questions, particularly
in light of I Icnncssy's belief that the cam
paign "will galvanize the Stanford communi
ty to meet the commitment made by Jane and
I .eland Stanford "to promote the public wel
fare by exercising an influence on behalf of

humanity and civilization."'
Stanford's efforts to thisend will apparent
ly foeuson luiman health,environmental sus
tainability. and international peace and secu
rity. 'lliese issues arc worthy of our concern
and in line with our expertise, but they do in
deed raise vital questions of interpretation.
Whose health concerns us—that of the
white-collar retirees with the financial re
sources to underwrite the rapid growth of the
health care sector, or that of the economical
ly disenfranchised? What criteria will deter
mine the balance we strike between the high
ly profitable, often-obscure conditions that
make for fabulous Manhattan benefits and
the more widespread diseases that cripple
the developing world and arc less amenable
to our intellectual property regime and the
privately funded research that drives it?
And what of"sustainability"?'lliis power-

I nl new word lias succeeded in encapsulating
a range of formerly contentious issues in an
ideologically neutral package that provides
its own. virtually incontestable argument.
Where do we take it? Ask five different peo
ple on this campus what "sustainability" is
and you'll likely get five very different an
swers. 1 or some, it might mean a highly local
ized and biodiverse food system grounded in
a rich set of cultural traditions, while for oth
ers, it could mean a few well-engineered
crops grown in large-scale centers of agricul
ture and processed in I I-I D-certified facto
ries. For some it could mean meticulously
conserving this planet's biological heritage in
its entirety, while (brothers it may well mean
saving the whales, the polar bears, the mana
tees, and ok even that creepy starry-eyed vole
or whatever it is but lor pete's sake
do we RI AI I.Y need an extra
600,000 species of beetles because
the Japanese ones are quite enough
already lor the (certified organic)
garden to cope with, l or some it
could mean returning to a home
tightly woven into a social, cultural,
and historical fabric unique to a par
ticular area, while lor some ('alil'or
nia governors, cough cough, it might
mean driving a nice hydrogen-pow
ered Hummer through soeioeco
nomically stratified, architectural!)
homogenous, and heavily privatized
suburbs to a fully recyclable, non
toxic. off-grid McChateau. Ihough
it's tempting to assume that a few ol
those hypothetical people are mere
ly uninformed—if onl> they were to
study up with the sustainability peo
ple, they would come to see sustain
ability in .til its glory as it truly is—it's
a phenomenally dangerous assump
tion. Sustainability is what we make
of it, and rest assured that not every
one wants to sustain the same things
or even realizes that there may be
things outside of one's own personal
experience worth sustaining.
Some of those answers may be
more palatable to the government
and the constituents of the Fortune
500 than others;some ol the most im
portant questions may be the most
difficult to ask. We must remember

that the University is strongly em
bedded in and very inuen a prpduet
of a particular political economy,one
that will inform its response to world
problems and the shape of the world
it's working towards. Of course my
advisor (.i very clever 11 isu>r\ profes
sor) could have told you this. And
that's the point. Iliis community of
fers a multitude of intelligent per
spectives on the world, perspectives
that continually surprise us and en
rich our time here. liy drawing in as
main of those perspectives as possi
ble. by tackling the most difficult
questions, the ('hallengc will be sure
to achieve great things indeed.
Ilius im pitch: the Advisory Panel
on Investment Responsibility will be
holding its annual lown llall meet
ing tonight in Cubberley Auditorium
at 6:30. Hie meeting is the main op
portunity for members of the com
munity to voice their thoughts and
concerns on how the University ap
plies the influence afforded it by its
si/able investments. Please come! If
we are to "promote the public wel
fare by exercising an influence on be
half of humanity and civilization." we
need to do it together.or the "public"
in "public welfare" may not turn out
to be very public at all.
