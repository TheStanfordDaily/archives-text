Cross symbolism
inappropriate
About your January 23 article
"l ight for their lives," on the an
niversary of Roe v. Wade, thank
goodness the so-called "pro-life"
protestors do not represent the
Stanford community or the country
at large. Aiul we're glad to hear stu
dents quoted, who recognize the
misuse of a ( hristian symbol and the
contempt for pregnant women im
plied by placing crosses as in a ceme
tery.
Itoth oi us are teaching courses on
the Holocaust at Stanford this year.
Ihis display made a cemetery for
"victims of Roe," but as we know
lrom the Na/is. victims have perpe
trators. Do the organizers mean to
brand women, who have many life
cherishing reasons to undertake a
legal abortion, as killers?
Ol course anyone has the right to
organize a demonstration on this
issue. Unfortunately, one student
who found this display "a very re
spectful way to make your point" be
cause "It reminds me of a war memo
rial." seems not to grasp an absolute
difference. A peaceful green field
pierced with white crosses evokes
military cemeteries harboring sol
diers actually killed while serving
their country-like the 3.056 Ameri
cans killed in Iraq. Ihe offensive
equation, for the third year in a row,
of those deaths willi ienallv-termi

natcd pregnancies brings tears of
anger and desperation.

Banning abortion would
be disastrous
livery year, the same display:
hundreds of crosses, as if in a gopher
graveyard, commemorate the an
niversary of the Roe v. Wade
Supreme ('ourt ruling finding a con
stitutional right to access to abor
tion.
In M Salvador, where abortion is
entirely illegal, one hundred women
each year are prosecuted for abort
ing their babies. World I lealth (>rga
nization estimates suggest that thirty
out of every thousand woman in
( 'entral America received abortions,
all illegal, in IWS. Rich women have
access to safe abortions; poor women
die from coat hangers and in back al
leys. Do the Stanford Students h>r
I ife hope toeriminali/e poverty with
a death sentence?
I'erhaps a compromise is appro
priate: contraception prevents abor
tion. homosexuality even more so.
