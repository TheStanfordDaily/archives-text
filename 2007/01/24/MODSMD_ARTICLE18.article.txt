lhought there was no connection
between African elephants and the
North American forests we see today?
Think again.
A new study on the effects of re
moving large herbivores from the
African savanna has implications that
can help understand the development
of the ecosystems ol North America
and Hurope. according to Biological
Sciences graduate students Rob
Pringle and Doug McCaulev. Their
study, a collaboration with Profs Tru
man Young ol I (-Dav is and Daniel
Rubenstein of Princeton.showed that
removing large herbivores from the
savanna produced not only direct in
creases in plant life, but indirect in
creases in the amounts of small herbi
vores and small predators as well.
Their findings, published in the Jan. 2
issue n| Proceedings ol the National
Academy of Sciences, represent a spe
cific example of a phenomenon eeolo
gists call "cascading el lects.
"The activities of certain species do
not just affect the species that they eat
and that eat them, but rather ripple
through the ecosystem, shaping tile
entire biological community in the
process." Pringle said.
Prof. Young's previous research
had shown that the removal ol large
herbivores like elephants.giratles. and
buffaloes from the savanna caused sig
nificant increases in plant life. Pringle
and McCaulev wanted to explore "the
indirect effects on the small things that
eat plants (like mice and insects)." said
Pringle.
'The study,conducted at the Mpala
Research ( entre in Kenya, used elee-

trie fences to exclude all
animals bigger than
about 15 kilograms. 1 le
and McCaulev each

chose a group of organ
isms that they expected

would show an indirect re
sponse to the exclusion of large
mammals.

"Doug looked at snakes, finding
that when large mammals disap
peared. rodents took over the world,
and snakes increased in abundance."
Pringle said. "I looked at a species of
tree-dwelling li/ard known as the
Kenya Dwarf Gecko. Since this
species lives on trees and eats insects,
we predicted that its abundance
would increase in response to increas
es in tree density and insect abun
dance when large mammals were ex
eluded."
With one minor exception, their
findings matched these predictions.
1 heir research also showed that the cas
cading effects of large herbivores were
greater in areas of poor productivity.
While Pringle and McCaulev arc
not the first eeologists to examine cas
cading effects. they are among the first
to focus on herbivores, not on preda
tors. and on a terrestrial ecosystem, as
opposed to an aquatic one, like a pond
or lake. 'llieir study also sheds light on
the evolving ecosystems of North
America and Hurope.
Up until about 10,000 years ago.
North America and Hurope were
filled with large mammals such as
mammoths and mastodons, similar to
the elephants that live in Africa today.
"Many scientists believe that hu
mans played a major role in the extinc
tion of these species, and our experi

ment. by removing all large
mammals, simulated such an extinc
tion event." Pringle said.
The results of their experiment are
similar to what actually happened
when North American mammals
went extinct —an increase in tree
density created woodlands out of
grasslands, and the densities of small
creatures, like mice, lizards, and
snakes, went up as well.
"So when you look at North Ameri
can — or l uropean. or Australian
ecosystems." Pringle summarized, "it
helps to remember that they're the
product of their own histories, and that
<i lot of the patterns that you see might
have their < irigins in this massive extinc
tion event that occurred millennia ago."
Pringle is currently continuing his
research in Kenya, while Mc( 'aulcy is
doing research on the cascading ef
fects of sharks on ecosystems in the
South Pacific.
