## Paytan preaches power of passion for ocean Geological Sciences Professor explains unique view of career 
### VAUGHAN MEYER 
Science can be like the ocean: deep, obscure
and unnerving. Geological Sciences Prof. Adina
Paytan entered her career in order to explore the
mysteries of the sea and demystify science for the

future generations. When I sat down with her, she
spoke at length not only about the interests that
led her to teach and to study the ocean, but also
her wisdom on "taking the time to grow up and
find your place in life and your passion."
Paytan started our interview by discussing her
role as a teacher at Stanford. As a professor, she
teaches a minimum of five classes each year, from
freshman introductory seminars to graduate
school lectures. Ihe majority of professors only
teach two classes.

Yet U> Paytan. research cannot exist without
teaching; they "Iced from each other." she said.
She took time to emphasize her belief that science
education requires more than just the presenta
tion of facts.
Professors, site said, must give the "tools and
skills in addition to the context," so that trained,
discerning scientific minds can be brought to "any
object in any place."
