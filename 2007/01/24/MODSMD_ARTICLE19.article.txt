## Paytan preaches power of passion for ocean Geological Sciences Professor explains unique view of career 
### VAUGHAN MEYER 
Science can be like the ocean: deep, obscure
and unnerving. Geological Sciences Prof. Adina
Paytan entered her career in order to explore the
mysteries of the sea and demystify science for the

future generations. When I sat down with her, she
spoke at length not only about the interests that
led her to teach and to study the ocean, but also
her wisdom on "taking the time to grow up and
find your place in life and your passion."
Paytan started our interview by discussing her
role as a teacher at Stanford. As a professor, she
teaches a minimum of five classes each year, from
freshman introductory seminars to graduate
school lectures. Ihe majority of professors only
teach two classes.

Yet U> Paytan. research cannot exist without
teaching; they "Iced from each other." she said.
She took time to emphasize her belief that science
education requires more than just the presenta
tion of facts.
Professors, site said, must give the "tools and
skills in addition to the context," so that trained,
discerning scientific minds can be brought to "any
object in any place."
Paytan teaches in a markedly stu
dent-centered style. She tailors each
of her classes not only to the educa
tional level of the students, but also
to their particular needs. The hesita
tion with which many students ap
proach science saddens her. She
makes sure not only to make the ma
terial approachable, but her teach
ing style as well.
In addition to teaching, Paytan
pursues her award-winning research
in oceanography. She came to
oceanography because she loved
chemistry, biology, geology, physics
and every other scientific discipline
she encountered. Oceanography,
says Paytan, "is by nature interdisci
plinary," so it allowed her to synthe
size her multiple passions and "see
how they intersect."
Despite her obvious love and tal
ent for oceanography, Paytan avoids
overspecialization and even expert
ise for fear that they will preclude

her from exploring and learning.
She describes herself as "an eternal
student" in this regard.
Taking a leaf out of Einstein's
book, Paytan mixes creativity with
hard science, and the human fascina
tion with unexplainable mysteries of
the Earth system. When she de
scribed the ocean, she talked of its
chemistry and physics but also man's
spiritual longing for this "vast, beau
tiful, scary, fearful....source of life."
Paytan also brought up the cur
rent state of the ocean. We only have
"one big ocean [that] is vast but not
unlimited," she said. She talked
about the ocean's integral role in
food, medicine and climate, among
other things, and how we must treat
the sea with greater respect and care
than we have recently.
With regards to her personal life
and approach to her passions, Pay
tan credits her upbringing in Israel
with shaping her personality. She
talked about an Israeli culture con
stantly on edge that instilled her
with an honest, straightforward de
meanor.
Paytan does not over think the
repercussions of communicating her

ideas, but "follows her passion, jus
tice, what is right."
Before going to college, she
served the mandatory two-year
term of service in the Israeli army
and then traveled for over a year in
the Himalayas. These experiences
gave Paytan time to grow up and t«>
step outside of herself. They forced
her to introspect and ask herseii
who she was and what she wanted.
Paytan said she would advise
everyone to strive for a similar expe
rience and to "think about what you
are doing rather than [follow] iner
tia...learn about [yourself] first. You
are losing a lot and compromising
yourself if you don't follow youi
dreams."
Paytan said she sees people
everyday who "forget about the
human aspect of their lives...forget
that they are dealing with people."
Yet, she shows how possible and in
spiring it is to find success while
cherishing that humanity. She is a
living example of how important it is
to have faculty and mentors who
care deeply about both the students'
education and their personal
growth.
