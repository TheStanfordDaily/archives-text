Zhou is currently considered "at risk" while
the police search for her is underway. She was last
sighted Saturday morning at 10:30 a.m when she
left her apartment in Rains to run errands in her
car. Neither Zhou nor her vehicle has been seen
since, which, according to the Department of Pub
lic Safety, is something "very much out of her
character."
Zhou. 23. is listed as 5 feet 5 inches and 120
pounds. Her car, a 2006 silver four-door Toyota
Corolla, has the California license plate
SVFG43O.
DPS Lieutenant Larry St. Denis told The
Daily late last night that there are no further de
tails known other than what has been listed on a
DPS flyer that is posted on its Web site.
Anyone with information regarding Zhou's
whereabouts is urged to contact DPS at (650) 723-
9633 during the day or (650) 329-2413 after busi
ness hours.
