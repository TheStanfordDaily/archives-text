## Herbivores removed to increase plant life Research shows plants directly benefit

'Ibought there was no connec
tion between African elephants
and the North American forests
we see today?' Hunk again.
A new study on the effects of
removing large herbivores from
the African savanna lias implica
tions that can help understand the
development of the ecosystems of
North America and Furope, ac
cording to Biological Sciences
graduate students Rob Pringle and
1 >ougMc('aulcy lheirstudy.acol
laboration with Profs. Truman
Young of DC-Davis and Daniel
Rubenstein of Princeton, showed
that removing large herbivores
from the savanna produced not
only direct increases in plant life,
but indirect increases in the
amounts of small herbivores and
small predators as well. Iheir find
ings. published in the Jan. 2 issue of
Proceedings ot the National Acad
emy of Sciences, represent a specif
ic example of a phenomenon eeol
ogistscall "cascading effects."
"The activities of certain
species do not just affect the
species that they eat and that eat
them, but rather ripple through the
ecosystem, shaping the entire bio
logical community in the process."
Pringle said.
Prof. Young's previous research
had shown that the removal of
large herbivores like elephants, gi

raflcs. and buffaloes from the sa
vanna caused significant increases
in plant life. Pringle and MeCauley
wanted to explore "the indirect ef
fects on the small things that eat
plants (like mice and insects),' said
Pringle.
The study, conducted at the
Mpala Research Centre in Kenya,
used electric fences to exclude all
animals bigger than about 15 kilo
grams. He and MeCauley each
chose a group of organisms that
they expected would show an indi
rect response to the exclusion ol
large mammals.
"Doug looked at snakes, tind
ing that when large mammals dis
appeared. rodents took over the
world, and snakes increased in
abundance." Pringle said. "I
looked at a species of tree
dwelling lizard known as the
Kenya Dwarf Gecko. Since this
species lives on trees and eats in
sects. we predicted that its abun
dance would increase in response
to increases in tree density and in
sect abundance when large mam
mals were excluded."
With one minor exception, their
findings matched these predic
tions. lheir research also showed
that the cascading effects ol large
herbivores were greater in areas ol
poor productivity.
While Pringle and MeCauley
are not the first eeologists to exam
ine cascading effects, they are
among the first to focus on herbi
vores. not on predators, and on a
terrestrial ecosystem, as opposed
to an aquatic one. like a pond or
lake, lheir study also sheds light on
the evolving ecosystems of North

Aincrica and kurope.
Up until about 10,000 years ago.
North Aincrica and Ruropc were
filled with large mammals such as
mammoths and mastodons, similar
to the elephants that live in Africa
today.
"Many scientists believe that
humans played a major role in the
extinction of these species, and our
experiment, by removing all large
mammals, simulated such an ex
tinction event." Pringle said.
'Hie results of their experiment
are similar to what actually hap
pened when North American
mammals went extinct —an in
crease in tree density created
woodlands out of grasslands, and
the densities of small creatures,
like mice, lizards, and snakes, went
up as well.
"So when you look at North
American — or Ruropean. or Aus
tralian — ecosystems," Pringle
summarized, "it helps to remem
ber that they're the product of
their own histories, and that a lot of
the patterns that you see might
have their origins in this massive
extinction event that occurred mil
lennia ago."
Pringle is currently continuing
his research in Kenya, while Mc-
Cauley is doing research on the
cascading effects of sharks on
ecosystems in the South Pacific.
