## Cassidy Krug Women's Diving Plunging into international waters Senior Krug is already tops in the Pac-10 and has her eye on national and international success as well 
### BY SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It would be easy to say that Cassidy Krug
was born to dive. As the daughter of two div
ing coaches, she grew up around the pool, at
tending her very first diving meet when she
was just a week old. Her early start has cer
tainly paid off in her diving career so far, both
at Stanford and on the national and interna
tional scenes.
Krug, a senior from Coraopolis, Penn., is a
five-time NCAA All-American and has
placed as high as third in an international
meet. Her most recent notable accomplish
ment is being one of 26 total male and female
American divers invited to attend the second
of two 2007 World Championship selection
camps. The camp is being held January 21-25
at the IU Natatorium in Indianapolis. Ind.
"There is a lot of competition in my events,
so I'm going to have dive well to make the
World Championships," Krug said. "But I've
worked really hard for this and would love to
make the U.S. team."
If selected. Krug would compete at the
2007 FINA World Championships in Mel
bourne, Australia, from March 18 to April 1.
Krug already has plenty of experience with in
ternational competition. In 2006. she placed
seventh in the three-meter event at the FINA
Diving World Cup and eighth in the same
event at the 2006 China FINA Grand Prix.
Krug's ultimate goal, however, is that of any
world-class athlete — to compete in the
Olympic Games.
In 2(X)4. as a freshman at Stanford, Krug
placed eighth in the three-meter at the U.S.
Olympic Trials.
"The 2004 trials felt like a Cinderella
story," Krug said. "I had no expectations and
barely made it to the trials."
Now, after her success throughout the past
four years, Krug knows she belongs among
the nation's elite divers.
"In 2(X)8,1 would be going to the trials for
a reason," she said. "I'm a much better diver
now than I was four years ago."
In her four years at Stanford, Krug has
been an invaluable asset to the Cardinal team.

She was an All-American in her freshman,
sophomore and junior years and in 2003-04
was the Pac-10 Diving Co-Freshman/New
comer of the Year. In her sophomore year, she
placed 13th in the three-meter and 14th in the
one-meter at the NCAA championships, and
continued to improve last season, placing sev
enth and ninth in the same two events.
St) far this year, she was named the Pac-10
Diver of the Month for November and has
recorded victories in each of the Cardinal's
dual meets. She also finished second in both
the one and three-meter events at the Indiana
Open Invitational in November.
"She's definitely the premier diver in the
Pac-10 right now, but our goals are far beyond
that," Stanford head diving coach Rick
Schavone said. "Our goal is to make her the
top diver in the country and winning now will
help her confidence in the postseason."
As an international athlete, a leader of a
top-ranked Division I team and Stanford stu
dent. it seems as though Krug would suffer
from intense pressure. Somehow, she man
ages to maintain a relaxed attitude and find
balance.
"Growing up, my parents were very con
cerned about not putting too much pressure
on me,"she said."Here at Stanford, I've found
that, with some extra work, it's doable to bal
ance school and diving."
Even now, as she heads into the World
Championship selection camps. Krug is a
model of calm confidence.
"I feel like I'm diving better than I ever
have right now." she said after the Cardinal's
recent sweep of Arizona and Arizona State.
"My good days are better than ever.and 1 just
really need to work on being consistent and
bringing up the bad days — that's my focus."
Krug's mature perspective reflects her role
as a senior leader of the Stanford team, a role
that she is going to find difficult to give up at
the end of the season.
"1 can't believe the end's here already." she
said. "It all passes by so fast."
As Krug's collegiate career draws to a
close, it is easy to believe that she will transfer

her NCAA success onto the interna
tional scene. She is quick to point out
that there is little difference between
collegiate dual meets and high-stakes
international competitions.
"1 go into big meets with lots of
extra time to prepare," she said. "But,
in the end. the dives are the same."
