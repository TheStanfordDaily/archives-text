# Replica jersey chasing
## 
### 
Thanks, bro. This past Saturday
I finally received in the mail a
hefty package containing
long-overdue Christmas gilts from
my brother and sister-in-law in Indi
anapolis. The arrival of these gifts is
cause for jubilation, as my brother al
ways seems to know exactly what I
want.
But they really outdid themselves
this year. Just one day before the
Colts battled the Patriots (insert
"Imperial March'songhere) in a his
toric AFC championship game. 1 re
ceived perhaps the greatest Christ
mas gift of all: a spiffy. brand-new
Marvin Harrison "88" jersey.
It wasn't the first time I had un
wrapped a jersey for the holidays —
past Christmas gifts have included a
total of three Kobe Bryant jerseys
(the home gold, the away purple, and
the "special" white), a Mexican na
tional soccer team shirt, a personal
ized "Lomeli" Clippers top and my
very first Michael Jordan jersey.
A close examination of my per
sonal closet makes me seem border
line obsessive: a Guadalajara Chivas
soccer uniform, the Rafael Furcal
Dodgers jersey, the Elton Brand
Clippers shirt and the Peyton Man
ning uni.in addition to the aforemen
tioned Christmas gifts.
As bad as 1 thought 1 was, my
friend Luis wears a soccer jersey
every day. No exaggeration — from
Real Madrid to some obscure team
in Central Peru, the guy's got every
football squad covered.
But both he and 1. and pretty
much everybody else willing to battle
hypocritical security standards in
order to play indoor soccer at Ford
Center nightly, have waited patiently
