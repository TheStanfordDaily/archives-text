# Replica jersey chasing
## 
### 
Thanks, bro. This past Saturday
I finally received in the mail a
hefty package containing
long-overdue Christmas gilts from
my brother and sister-in-law in Indi
anapolis. The arrival of these gifts is
cause for jubilation, as my brother al
ways seems to know exactly what I
want.
But they really outdid themselves
this year. Just one day before the
Colts battled the Patriots (insert
"Imperial March'songhere) in a his
toric AFC championship game. 1 re
ceived perhaps the greatest Christ
mas gift of all: a spiffy. brand-new
Marvin Harrison "88" jersey.
It wasn't the first time I had un
wrapped a jersey for the holidays —
past Christmas gifts have included a
total of three Kobe Bryant jerseys
(the home gold, the away purple, and
the "special" white), a Mexican na
tional soccer team shirt, a personal
ized "Lomeli" Clippers top and my
very first Michael Jordan jersey.
A close examination of my per
sonal closet makes me seem border
line obsessive: a Guadalajara Chivas
soccer uniform, the Rafael Furcal
Dodgers jersey, the Elton Brand
Clippers shirt and the Peyton Man
ning uni.in addition to the aforemen
tioned Christmas gifts.
As bad as 1 thought 1 was, my
friend Luis wears a soccer jersey
every day. No exaggeration — from
Real Madrid to some obscure team
in Central Peru, the guy's got every
football squad covered.
But both he and 1. and pretty
much everybody else willing to battle
hypocritical security standards in
order to play indoor soccer at Ford
Center nightly, have waited patiently

over the past few weeks for the un
veiling of the new Adidas Mexican
soccer jersey.
It's quite remarkable to think
what kind of market professional
sports have claimed through the
sales of replica and authentic jer
seys. Sure, for some people, it's
purely fashion: most people could
care less how the Tar Heels are
doing while sporting a North Car
olina jersey.
But for others, myself included,
wearing a jersey is about more than
just looking cool: it shows your alle
giance. ITie name across your chest
stands for your greater cause; the
name on your back indicates the ath
lete you aspire to be.
Hut.of course, there are some im
portant things to keep in mind. For
one, the jersey can't be some simple
$20 knock-off from Wal-Mart, a la
that wonderful Harrison jersey my

brother got me. If you're going to
shell out the money, then you'd bet
ter darn well shell out the money.
Nobody's saying you need to spend
$300 for an authentic football uni.
But you can at the very least fork
over $70 for a nice replica — that's
the pay for just four articles written
for the Daily.
The leagues recognize the lucra
tive nature of the jersey market. The
Los Angeles Galaxy are anticipating
millions from sales of the David
Beckham jersey. The Arizona Dia
mondbacks recently underwent a
major shift in uni style, adopting Se
dona red colors and the nickname
"Dbacks" across the front. Both the
Anaheim Ducks and the Cincinnati
Reds made major changes in their
jerseys lately as well, meaning dedi
cated fans of these squads will have
to toss their antiquated styles and
purchase the new uniforms.
But the importance of jerseys
goes beyond boosting the economy.
The NHL announced Monday
that new sleeker jerseys would be
worn at this season's all-star game
before going into full use by all

teams next season. After two years
of planning, the NHL and Reebok
have apparently created a new top
that will allow for better mover lent
and ventilation. The announcement
has received a mixed reaction, with
many arguing that players should
have more time to test the new stylo.
Either way, play in the NHL will del
initely be impacted next year as play
ers adjust to the new threads.
The fact that Kobe Bryant once
again owns the top-selling NBA jet
sey has led many to believe that he
has finally escaped the stigma of the
rape allegations of two years ago.
And Reggie Bush, owner of the
top-selling NFL jersey in 2006.
pledged to donate a quarter of his
jersey sales to victims of Hurricane
Katrina.
So please keep all this in mind the
next time you decide to don a uni
form. Yes, it's a pretty big deal, so at
least know the guy whose name is
written across your back.

you have jerseys to get off your hands,
