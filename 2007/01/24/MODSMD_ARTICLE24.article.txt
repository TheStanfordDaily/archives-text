# Eric McKean Men's Tennis
## Battling back After nearly a year on the sideline, senior McKean is back and ready to compete for Stanford one more time 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One year ago, Eiric McKean was uncertain
about whether or not he'd ever he able to return to
the tennis court. Following a nagging injury and a
slew of misdiagnoses, the senior was forced to take
off much of the 2005-2006 season. Instead of com
peting with an 18-4 team that found its way to the
quarterfinals of the NCAA Championship, the
Pacific Palisades, Calif., native instead focused his
efforts on recovering from his injury and support
ing his team from the sidelines.
McKean finally picked up a racket again at the
end of last summer and has quickly made up for
lost time. The senior has lost none of his positive
attitude and determination during his time away;
McKean has already seen notable individual re
sults since his return and was even elected this
year's team captain.
"[The break) actually made me enjoy tennis
even more, because I really didn't know just how
much 1 loved it," McKean said. "But once it was
taken away. 1 realized, 'This is a huge part of my
life that means a lot to me,' and I really saw how
much 1 dedicate myself to tennis."
Although the aches in his hand that could side
line him began the summer prior to his junior year,
it wasn't until after the Northwest Regional in Oc
tober 2(X)5 that McKean was unable to bear the
pain and told head coach John Whitlinger that he
could not play. McKean was diagnosed with se
vere tendonitis and spent the next two months re
habilitating his injury.
Ready to jump into the dual match season at
the start of 2(XXi, McKean felt the exact same pain
the first time he hit the ball, despite his rehab ef
forts in the previous months. An MRI told McK
ean that he had three stress fractures in his hand
and would have to take cortisone shots and anoth
er six weeks off. These efforts proved futile, and
after taking yet more time off, McKean opted for
surgery.
Three holes were drilled into McKean's hand
and he was told there was a 50-50 chance that he
would never be able to play tennis again.The sen
ior went through rehab and waited until late Au
gust before he picked up a racket again, after near

ly 10 months off.
'i got to focus on some other things in my life
besides tennis, and that was nice," McKean said.
"But tennis has always been my passion so it was
like my dream was being taken away. I've always
wanted to play Stanford Tennis, and in this criti
cal year, my junior year. I was ready to jump in
and make something happen and it just didn't
happen.
"[Coach Whitlinger] and a lot of my team
mates helped me out throughout that whole
time," McKean continued. "They stayed pretty
positive with me even though they knew 1 might
not ever play tennis again."
Whitlinger agreed that the time away was diffi
cult for McKean.
"I could tell it was not an easy situation for him
just to be on the sideline, knowing there was no
chance of playing, or even practicing for that mat
ter," Whitlinger said. "And that's not easy because
he's such a competitor."
Luckily for the Cardinal, McKean is back inac
tion this year and has already had notable success
in this year's individual tournaments. After drop
ping a tight three-setter in the second round of the
Bronco Classic in early October, McKean won
three matches and advanced to the fourth round
of the ITA Northwest Regional, eventually falling
to California's Kallim Stewart, 7-6 (6). 4-6. 6-4.
"Eric hadn't played in a year so 1 didn't know
what to expect," Whitlinger said. "It definitely
showed me a lot of what he is capable of doing.
Even though he lost that match [to Stewart], he
played well, and he played some other good
matches in that tournament too.
"[Eric's] capable of beating a lot of players."
Whitlinger continued. "I think he's starting to be
lieve that too. The Regional tournament showed
me he's back in it again. When you take off a year,
things can change, but he showed no tentativeness
and he went after it."
Another important win for McKean this year
came against the University of Hawaii. After
dropping the first set of his singles match, 5-7, the
senior captain bounced back to win the second
and third sets, 6-3, 7-5, respectively, helping his

team to the 4-3 victory over the War
riors.
Mckean has played several three
set matches this year and has won
about as many as he has lost.
Whitlinger commented that it is
never a lack of effort that costs McK
ean the match.
"The thing about Eric is you know
you're going to get a great effort,"
Whitlinger said. "You know he's
going to light until the last point no
matter what happens. Sometimes in
three-set matches, he might start get
ting a little tighter, but we just have to
keep him loose and going for his
shots. All it will take is to win a few
[three-set matches] and he'll get more

confidence."
ITiough the other players have
displayed confidence in McKean's
capabilities as a teammate and as a
leader, electing him this year's cap
tain, the senior feels that he still must
prove himself worthy of the position.
"Coming into Stanford Tennis, 1
was just excited to work as hard as I
could and help out the team," the sen
ior said. "I never thought I'd get this
opportunity to he in this role, but I
think it's definitely a position where 1
still have to earn the title of captain
and help the team gel.
"The season hasn't started so we
haven't faced any obstacles," he con
tinued. "But we will and that's the
time when we'll see if I'm a qualified
captain. I'm really excited about it
and it's an incredible honor. The
whole team works so hard day in and
day out, and we go out there to com
pete and to win. When I look back on

all that during a match, it gives me
motivation to stay focused and stay
in it."
Whitlinger said that McKean is mI
ways willing to do what it takes for the
good of the team and never puts him
self first.
"To me, that says a lot about some
body in his position," Whitlinger said.
"He really cares about everybody,
and I'm really excited that he's cap
tain of the team."
McKean will be tested as a player
and as captain this Saturday when the
No. 9 Cardinal kick off the season at I
p.m. against No. 25 Boise State at the
Tiube Tennis Center.
"I'm so excited." McKean said.
"Last year was fun, being able to
watch the team do so well. But at the
same time, it was bittersweet because
1 wanted to be out there competing
and grinding it out. It's been a long
time, but now I get another chance."
