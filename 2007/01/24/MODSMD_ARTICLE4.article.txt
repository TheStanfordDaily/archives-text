# Students visit Hennessy, again
## Coalition against sweatshops leads protest to President 
### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
About thirty students from the Stan
ford Sweat-Free Coalition marched from
White Plaza to President John 1 lennessy's
office yesterday calling on the University
to join the Workers Rights Consortium
and Designated Suppliers Program.
Despite the University's standard pro
tocol for crowds assembled before I len
nessy's office — namely, that a police offi
cer be posted at the door and that the of
fice be locked — the students were able to
present their demands to the President's
receptionist and said that they hoped the
University would respond positively to
ensure that apparel bearing its insignia is
not produced in sweatshops. But while
group organizers said that they expected
the University to reply to their demands
within the next few weeks, a University
administrator estimated that the evalua
tion process could last several months.
Yesterday's protest was the second in
cident in the past week in which student
activists brought their cases directly to
Hennessy's office. On Thursday, the Stu
dent Labor Action Coalition (SLAC)
protested the University's living wage pol
icy by performing a skit in his office, a
campaign unrelated to the Sweat-Free
rally.
The students gathered in White Plaza
at noon, ready to march toward Hen
nessy's office in what organizers stressed
should be a "positive and peaceful" man
ner.

"We're not interested in confronting
people." saitl freshman Scott Frank, who
led the group in two drum-accompanied
songs before the march. "We're interested
in walking side by side with people."
At 1 lennessy's office, the students ral
lied behind their banner, as three repre
sentatives presented the group's demands
to 1 lennessy's receptionist.

More specifically, the Coalition, which
was initiated by the Stanford Asian
American Activism Committee
(SAAAC). asked that the University af
filiate with the Workers Rights Consor
tium (WRC), a non-profit organization
that has assisted 166 colleges and univer
sities in drafting codes of conduct for the
factories in which their clothes are pro

duced.The Coalition also asked that the
University team with the Designated
Suppliers Program (DSP), an enforce
ment program — which 30 schools have
joined — that would apply the Universi
ty's work codes in sweat-free factories
over the next three years.
