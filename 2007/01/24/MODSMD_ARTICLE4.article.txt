# Students visit Hennessy, again
## Coalition against sweatshops leads protest to President 
### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
About thirty students from the Stan
ford Sweat-Free Coalition marched from
White Plaza to President John 1 lennessy's
office yesterday calling on the University
to join the Workers Rights Consortium
and Designated Suppliers Program.
Despite the University's standard pro
tocol for crowds assembled before I len
nessy's office — namely, that a police offi
cer be posted at the door and that the of
fice be locked — the students were able to
present their demands to the President's
receptionist and said that they hoped the
University would respond positively to
ensure that apparel bearing its insignia is
not produced in sweatshops. But while
group organizers said that they expected
the University to reply to their demands
within the next few weeks, a University
administrator estimated that the evalua
tion process could last several months.
Yesterday's protest was the second in
cident in the past week in which student
activists brought their cases directly to
Hennessy's office. On Thursday, the Stu
dent Labor Action Coalition (SLAC)
protested the University's living wage pol
icy by performing a skit in his office, a
campaign unrelated to the Sweat-Free
rally.
The students gathered in White Plaza
at noon, ready to march toward Hen
nessy's office in what organizers stressed
should be a "positive and peaceful" man
ner.

"We're not interested in confronting
people." saitl freshman Scott Frank, who
led the group in two drum-accompanied
songs before the march. "We're interested
in walking side by side with people."
At 1 lennessy's office, the students ral
lied behind their banner, as three repre
sentatives presented the group's demands
to 1 lennessy's receptionist.

More specifically, the Coalition, which
was initiated by the Stanford Asian
American Activism Committee
(SAAAC). asked that the University af
filiate with the Workers Rights Consor
tium (WRC), a non-profit organization
that has assisted 166 colleges and univer
sities in drafting codes of conduct for the
factories in which their clothes are pro

duced.The Coalition also asked that the
University team with the Designated
Suppliers Program (DSP), an enforce
ment program — which 30 schools have
joined — that would apply the Universi
ty's work codes in sweat-free factories
over the next three years.

After the demands were present
ed. Co-organizer Mark Liu, a senior,
emphasized to the group the histori
cal significance of the march.
"Students in the past have fought
against discrimination and for voting
rights," he claimed. "On this campus,
they have fought for ethnic studies
and for workers' rights. Now. it's be
come an international movement."
Organizers said that they were
surprised and heartened that the
I Jniversity did not post a police offi
cer outside the office.
"I honestly can't speculate about
the reasons why the President didn't
put a cop outside." said co-organizer
Daniel Shih.a sophomore. "Perhaps
our demonstrated willingness to
work with them and establish a con
structive relationship caused them to
change their mind."
Special Assistant to the President
Jeff Wachtel told Ihe Daily that pub
lic safety officials are typically called
on when large crowds are present to
reassure the receptionist. Wachtel
also emphasized that had he been
previously informed, he would have
met with the group.

"Nobody contacted me and told
me that they |were] coming," he said.
"I had scheduled a lunch meeting
today a week before, but had the
group contacted me, I would have
come out and met with them."
The protestors said that they ex
pect that the University will eventu
ally join the WRC and DSP, despite
its refusal to do so over the last six
years.
"I'd be surprised if they don't re
spond at all and, over the long run. if
they don't respond in our favor."said
2005 graduate Elizabeth deßham.an
internship coordinator with the De
partment of Urban Studies. "The ex
ample has been set by other universi
ties. and tor Stanford not to do any
thing would be irresponsible and
would exhibit a lack of will and not a
lack of way."
Director of Business Develop
ment Susan Weinstein, also the Uni
versity Privacy Officer, said that
while she had not read the demands,
evaluating the students' requests
would take months.
"Stanford supports both interna
tional and national efforts to pro

mote respect for labor rights" she
said. "Although 1 have not yet seen
the Campaign's letter, the University
takes very seriously our students'
concerns in this area. Over the next
few months we will evaluate the re
quests by the Coalition, along with
other relevant issues which touch on
the subject of international labor
rights. TTiis process will include con
versations with a number of experts
and other interested parties, both
within and outside of the Universi
ty"
Weinstein's emphasis clashed di
rectly with the Coalition organizers'
hopes that the group would receive a
response within a week. Sophomore
Walter Vulej expressed confidence
that students and alumni would rally
behind this cause.
"I don't want to be associated
with an institution that lends itself to
factories that are sweatshops," he
said. "I have just become aware of
this, and it makes my blood boil. I
hope that my fellow students and
alumni will have their blood boil
after hearing that the Stanford hood
ie is made in sweatshops."

partment of Urban Studies. "The ex
ample has been set by other universi
ties. and tor Stanford not to do any
thing would be irresponsible and
would exhibit a lack of will and not a
lack of way."
Director of Business Develop
ment Susan Weinstein, also the Uni
versity Privacy Officer, said that
while she had not read the demands,
evaluating the students' requests
would take months.
"Stanford supports both interna
tional and national efforts to pro

mote respect for labor rights" she
said. "Although 1 have not yet seen
the Campaign's letter, the University
takes very seriously our students'
concerns in this area. Over the next
few months we will evaluate the re
quests by the Coalition, along with
other relevant issues which touch on
the subject of international labor
rights. TTiis process will include con
versations with a number of experts
and other interested parties, both
within and outside of the Universi
ty"
Weinstein's emphasis clashed di
rectly with the Coalition organizers'
hopes that the group would receive a
response within a week. Sophomore
Walter Vulej expressed confidence
that students and alumni would rally
behind this cause.
"I don't want to be associated
with an institution that lends itself to
factories that are sweatshops," he
said. "I have just become aware of
this, and it makes my blood boil. I
hope that my fellow students and
alumni will have their blood boil
after hearing that the Stanford hood
ie is made in sweatshops."
