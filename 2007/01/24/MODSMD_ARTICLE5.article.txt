## Crothers solves housing crunch Students abroad for fall placed in grad residences 
### LIA HARDIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As upperclassmen returned this year
from fall quarters spent abroad, 31 under
graduate students were assigned to gradu
ate housing in Crothers I (all and Crothers
Memorial Hall when Housing reprised its
annual struggle to find sufficient space for
undergraduates.
Some students who waited until the
walk-in round, however, rather than apply
ing for housing prior to going abroad, were
able to obtain highly desirable rooms in
undergraduate residences in a process that
generated some resentment.
"In recent years, the number of under
graduates returning to campus Winter

Quarter has been too high to accommo
date all students in undergraduate resi
dences." said Director of Student Housing
Assignments Sue Nunan. As a result, she
said, students were assigned to graduate
housing with the option to move when ad
ditional space becomes available in under
graduate housing later in the quarter.
Crothers and Crothers Menioiial. she
added, have "been a fairly popular option
because of the availability of single i >oms.
because room rates are somewhat less than
in undergraduate dormitories, and because
[they] are close to Green l ibrary and the
center of campus."
Crothers Memorial is a dormitory-style
building, with long navy blue carpeted hall
ways and cinderblock walls. The rooms
available to undergraduates this year in
cluded nine singles and eleven one-room
doubles comparable in size to rooms in

Crothers Hall, typically reserved for graduate student housing, is now home to 31 under
graduate students who returned from fall quarter abroad.

Junior Carl Moore was assigned
to a C'rothers single when he re
turned from Oxford this quarter.
Due to a housing problem, he was
unassigned after the first round of
housing. 1 le was placed on the wait
ing list and eventually given a room
in graduate housing. Moore said that
he was not particularly upset about
the situation.
"| I lousing] was really sympathet
ic." he said. "I really appreciate that
once they discovered there was a
glitch they tried to make the best of
the situation."
Juniors Mason DcPasse and
Cieorge Levitte were assigned to a
one-room double in Crothers
Memorial after their quarters spent
abroad in Australia and Berlin, re
spectively.
Ilieir primary complaint is that
("rothers is antisocial.
"l'veryone is so quiet that we're
probably the loudest ones." Levitte
said. "There might be one open door
somewhere else (in Crothers]... [but]
it is another undergraduate."
DePasse was resigned about his
assignment, noting that although

('rot hers is antisocial, there are some
benefits.
'i like that I don't have a meal
plan," he said, "because Stanford
Dining jacks up the prices."
I lowever. despite this benefit. De-
Passe was still frustrated with his
housing assignment.
"For me, it's a waste of my pre
ferred year." he said.
Some students with lower hous
ing priorities. however, were assigned
to better housing in undergraduate
residences in the walk-in round.
"1 got into better housing than
people assigned in the first round."
said junior Meredith Bell, who ob
tained ;i room in Narnia as a walk-in
alter stopping out and spending a
quarter volunteering in Africa. Al
though liell had to send a friend as a
proxy during walk-in assignments,
she thought the walk-in process was
fairly easy to accomplish.
De Passe expressed some resent
ment at the inequality produced by
the separate rounds of housing as
signments.
"I think I got a much lower draw
number than people who got into
housing that 1 put on my list." he said.
Nunan pointed out that the
process did achieve its primary goal
this year.
"At this time."she said."all under
graduates have been offered an as
signment for Winter Quarter."
