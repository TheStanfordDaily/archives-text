## Crothers solves housing crunch Students abroad for fall placed in grad residences 
### LIA HARDIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As upperclassmen returned this year
from fall quarters spent abroad, 31 under
graduate students were assigned to gradu
ate housing in Crothers I (all and Crothers
Memorial Hall when Housing reprised its
annual struggle to find sufficient space for
undergraduates.
Some students who waited until the
walk-in round, however, rather than apply
ing for housing prior to going abroad, were
able to obtain highly desirable rooms in
undergraduate residences in a process that
generated some resentment.
"In recent years, the number of under
graduates returning to campus Winter

Quarter has been too high to accommo
date all students in undergraduate resi
dences." said Director of Student Housing
Assignments Sue Nunan. As a result, she
said, students were assigned to graduate
housing with the option to move when ad
ditional space becomes available in under
graduate housing later in the quarter.
Crothers and Crothers Menioiial. she
added, have "been a fairly popular option
because of the availability of single i >oms.
because room rates are somewhat less than
in undergraduate dormitories, and because
[they] are close to Green l ibrary and the
center of campus."
Crothers Memorial is a dormitory-style
building, with long navy blue carpeted hall
ways and cinderblock walls. The rooms
available to undergraduates this year in
cluded nine singles and eleven one-room
doubles comparable in size to rooms in
