### LAURA RUMPF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's no secret that a passion for phi
lanthropy runs in the Arrillaga family.
Laura Arrillaga. 36. a Graduate
School of Business (GSB) lecturer
whose family's contributions to cam
pus include several buildings, is making
headlines of her own for efforts to ef
fect change in the nonprofit sector.
Arrillaga founded the Silicon Valley
Social Venture Fund (SV2) in 1998 in
order to help Silicon Valley entrepre
neurs pool resources, as well as to work
with local non-profits to improve their
organizational effectiveness. SV2 typi
cally attracts young professionals with
out a legacy in philanthropy to guide
the professionals' investments by of
fering educational programs in cffec

tive personal giving and assuring in
vestors of a high accountability level in
results.
Arrillaga came up with the idea for
the venture fund after completing the
MBA program at the GSB in 1997. In
the Silicon Valley area, she encoun
tered a large number of successful 30
to 40 year-old locals, who expressed a
desire to use their wealth to serve the
greater good, but were not already en
gaged in philanthropy.
"The vast majority of those... able to
give weren't from Silicon Valley,so they
didn't have ties to charitable organiza
tions [in the area)."she said on the SV2
Web site. However, "their professional
experiences," Arrillaga noted, "provid
ed them with an understanding of the
need for a high level of accountability
alongside philanthropic investments."
She believed their skills would make
them effective investors in the non
profit sector, if given the right guid
ance.
