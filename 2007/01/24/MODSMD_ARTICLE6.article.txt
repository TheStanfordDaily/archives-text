## Other Arrillaga charitable too Laura Arrillaga, daughter of John, runs philanthropy fund 
### LAURA RUMPF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's no secret that a passion for phi
lanthropy runs in the Arrillaga family.
Laura Arrillaga. 36. a Graduate
School of Business (GSB) lecturer
whose family's contributions to cam
pus include several buildings, is making
headlines of her own for efforts to ef
fect change in the nonprofit sector.
Arrillaga founded the Silicon Valley
Social Venture Fund (SV2) in 1998 in
order to help Silicon Valley entrepre
neurs pool resources, as well as to work
with local non-profits to improve their
organizational effectiveness. SV2 typi
cally attracts young professionals with
out a legacy in philanthropy to guide
the professionals' investments by of
fering educational programs in cffec

tive personal giving and assuring in
vestors of a high accountability level in
results.
Arrillaga came up with the idea for
the venture fund after completing the
MBA program at the GSB in 1997. In
the Silicon Valley area, she encoun
tered a large number of successful 30
to 40 year-old locals, who expressed a
desire to use their wealth to serve the
greater good, but were not already en
gaged in philanthropy.
"The vast majority of those... able to
give weren't from Silicon Valley,so they
didn't have ties to charitable organiza
tions [in the area)."she said on the SV2
Web site. However, "their professional
experiences," Arrillaga noted, "provid
ed them with an understanding of the
need for a high level of accountability
alongside philanthropic investments."
She believed their skills would make
them effective investors in the non
profit sector, if given the right guid
ance.
With this unique pool of investors
in mind, Arrillaga devised the SV2
lund. SV2 donors select non-profit
organizations of interest and use a
grant-making model based on
"multi-year, mutually accountable
grants" to help these non-profits
achieve results. All the while, the
fund teaches the skills and knowl
edge necessary for being an effective
philanthropist.
The grants have been extremely
successful over the last ten years. In
vestors are currently focused on im
proving the organizational capacity
of a number of local non-profits, in
eluding Fresh Lifelines for Youth, a
center for at-risk youth in San Jose,
;md Acterra. an environmental sus
tainability group based in Palo Alto,
among others. "[There is] a doc

umented. measurable impact on our
grantees' effectiveness and efficien
cy as organizations," Arrillaga said
on the Web site..
She plans to continue improving
on SV2's grant-making model
through "increased partner engage
ment. focused issue areas and inter
action."
"We are approaching our ten
year anniversary in 19 months and
we have tremendous plans for in
creased growth, impact and sustain
ability— developing right now. I
could not be more excited for the fu
ture," she said.
Arrillaga also encouraged Stan
ford students to become involved in
SV2's work.
"We have a Stanford undergrad
uate summer fellowship each year,
and undergraduates working for our
staff." she said. "We might even cre
ate a post-graduate fellowship in the
coming year or two."
Arrillaga plans to offer a class in
the spring on philanthropy and so
cial innovation.

lanthropy runs in the Arrillaga family.
