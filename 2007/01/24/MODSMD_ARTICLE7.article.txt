## Chicago's Saller to be dean Former Chicago professor and provost coming to Stanford 
### LIA HARDIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The University of Chicago lost its top
academic administrator this year when
Stanford announced that Richard Sailer,
a history and classics professor and a for
mer provost at that school, will replace
Sharon Long as Dean of the School of

I iumanities and Sciences on April 1.
Though the details have not yet been
finalized. Sailer's faculty appointment at
Stanford, will most likely he another joint
appointment in history and classics. Me is
a self-described Roman historian, and his
forthcoming book. "The Cambridge I co
nomic History of the Cireco-Roman
World." was a collaborative effort with
Stanford Classics Profs. Lan Morris and
Walter Scheidel. At the I Jniversity of
Chicago, he teaches a course on Roman
economic history.
According to Long, Sailer will
have to overcome "several major op
portunities and challenges" as her re
placement. After serving a five-year
term, l ong is leaving the position to
return to teaching.
"1 really loved being Dean," I ong
said, "but what brought me here in
the first place was Stanford as a won
derful place to do science and to
work with students."
"I think the School [of Humani
ties and Sciences] is ready for a
strategic planning effort to look at
the direction forward for the depart
ments and programs." she added. "I
think this is an attraction for Profes
sor Sailer as he decided to come to
Stanford."
"1 think there are some opportu
nities to improve on some of the
[Stanford] programs." Sailer told The
Daily.
At the University of Chicago, stu
dents said that the feeling on campus
is that Sailer is leaving for a more at
tractive administrative appointment.

despite the fact that he is currently
provost.
"[Stanford has] more sunshine
and pretty people," joked Derek
Russell-Kraft, a University of ('hica
go senior.
Chicago senior Andrea Arntsen
llarris said students speculate that
Sailer's new job at Stanford will be
"less stressful" than the role he is
leaving behind.
Sailer said that he doubted the
Chicago students "had much evi
dence" for their claims. Although he
will watch over approximately 500
Stanford faculty members rather
than the more than 1200 he oversaw
as University of Chicago Provost,
some of the issues he will have to
tackle at Stanford, such as the re
cruitment of minority faculty, are
highly controversial.
Stanford continues to struggle
with recruiting and keeping minority
faculty on staff, as evidenced by the
impending departure of Political Sci
ence Associate Prof. I uis I'raga, who

announced in December his decision
to leave for the University of Wash
ington. As provost. Sailer worked
closely with faculty and students on
discussing and resolving minority is
sues.
In the 2002-2003 academic year,
he commissioned the Provost's Ini
tiative on Minority Issucs.'lhe Initia
tive indicated in its2oo2-2003 annual
report that "faculty recruitment is es
sential for minority students."
Despite this, lie said, the progress
made at (Ihicago was not sufficient.
"There is no eas\ quick solution
to [the problem of recruiting minori
ty faculty]." Sailer told Ihe Daily.
"Ihere are very lew things that 1
spent more time on as dean and
provost at the University of Chica
go-"
lie also said that he will encour
age students to break out of the
"Stanford Bubble."
"If the whole college career is
cloistered. I think that's really too
limiting," he said, adding that the

freedom to experienee the world in
new ways is an important aspect of
the college experience. Sailer be
came interested in classics alter tak
ing a course in Roman history as an
undergraduate at the University of
Illinois, lie emphasized that oppor
tunities to do community service and
to study abroad are equally impor
tant.
Sailer will be joined by his wife, a
professor of anthropology, whose ac
ademic appointment at Stanford is
also in progress. Both spent a year at
Stanford from 1986 until 1987 as vis
iting faculty members at the Center
for Advanced Study in the Behav
ioral Sciences.' I lie y will be leaving
behind their two grown sons and
close friends in ('hicago.
Sailer, an enthusiastic cyclist, said
that part of what convinced him to
come to Stanford were the "fun
memories" of his year spent here.
"Chicago isn't really a bad place
to cycle," he said, "but Stanford is
much better."
