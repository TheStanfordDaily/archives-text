### TERENCE HUNT ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A politically weak
ened President Bush implored a skeptical
Congress I'uesday night to embrace his un
popular plan to send more U.S. troops to
Iraq, saving it represents the best hope in a
\\ ar America must not lose. "Give it a chance
to work." he said.
l acing a political showdown with Democ
rats and Republicans alike. Bush was un
vielding on Iraq in his annual State of the
Union address, lie also sought to revive his
troubled presidency with proposals to ex
pand health insurance coverage and to slash
gasoline consumption by 20 percent in a
decade.
Democrats â€”and even some Republi
cans scoffed at his Iraq policy. Unmoved by
Bush's appeal. Democrats said the House
and Senate would vote on resolutions of dis
approval of the troop buildup.
"We need a new direction,"said freshman
Sen. Jim Webb, picked by the Democrats to
deliver their TV response. "The majority of
the nation no longer supports the way this
war is being fought; nor does the majority of
our military," said Webb, a Vietnam veteran
opposed to Bush's invasion of Iraq.
Republican Sen. Norm Coleman of Min
nesota, also took issue with Bush."! can't tell
you what the path to success is, but it's not
what the president has put on the table," he
said.
It was a night of political theater as Bush
went before the first Democratic-controlled
Congress in a dozen years with his lowest ap
proval ratings in polls.
Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Cal
ifornia, the first woman to lead the 1 louse.sat
over Bush's shoulder, next to Vice President

Dick Cheney. Reaching out to the Democ
rats. Bush opened with a tribute to Pelosi and
paused to shake her hand. He also asked for
prayers for Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson,
hospitalized for more than a month after suf
fering a brain hemorrhage, and Republican
Georgia Rep. Charlie Norwood, suffering
from cancer.
The speech audience included up to a
dozen 1 louse and Senate members who have
announced they are running for president or

are considered possible contenders.
Bush divided his 49-minute address be
tween domestic and foreign issues, but the
war was topic No. 1.
Pelosi set the tone for Democrats. She sat
silently and did not applaud as Bush warned
of high stakes in Iraq and said American
forces must not step back before Baghdad is
secure.
With Congress poised to deliver a stinging
rebuke on his troop increase, he made a per

sonal plea to lawmakers.
"I have spoken with many of you in per
son. I respect you and the arguments you
made." Bush said. "We went into this largely
united, in our assumptions and in our convic
tions. And whatever you voted for, you did
not vote for failure."
"Our country is pursuing a new strategy in
Iraq and 1 ask you to give it a chance to work."
Bush said. "And 1 ask you to support our
troops in the field and those on their way."

We went into this
largely united, in our
assumptions and in
our convictions. And
whatever you voted for,
you did not vote for
failure.
- GEORGE W. BUSH

Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid gave Bush a swift answer.
"While the president continues to ignore
the will of the country. Congress will not ig
nore this president's failed policy," they said
in a joint statement after his address. "His
plan will receive an up-or-down vote in both
the House and Senate, and we will continue
to hold him accountable for changing
course in Iraq."
Bush said the Iraq war had changed dra
matically with the outbreak of sectarian war
fare and reprisals.
"This is not the fight we entered in Iraq,
but it is the fight we are in," the president
said. "Every one of us wishes that this war
were over and won. Yet it would not be like
us to leave our promises unkept, our friends
abandoned and our own security at risk.
"Ladies and gentlemen: On this day, at
this hour, it is still within our power to shape
the outcome of this battle," the president
said. "Let us find our resolve and turn events
toward victory."
