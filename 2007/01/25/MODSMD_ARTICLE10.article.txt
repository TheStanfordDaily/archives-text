## GSC discusses Special Fees Council approves funding for seven student groups 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Talk of money and politics dominated
last night's Graduate Student Council
(GSC) meeting, as members approved
funding for seven student groups and met

with ASSU Special Fees Commissioner
Bernard Fraga, a junior, to discuss imple
menting new campaigning rules.
The GSC handled the funding requests
— the most of any meeting this year in
rapid-fire succession, before members
began squabbling over the overlap between
two groups asking for money. Some repre
sentatives argued that the Chinese Campus
Evangelical Fellowship and the Association
of Chinese Students did not deserve
separate funding, since their events
would attract the same students.
But GSC Funding Sub-Commit
tee Chair Adam Ik-berg said that he
was told the two groups do not get
along "as well as you might think"
and that the separate requests were
appropriate.
"We look at the two groups and we
make a call." Beberg said, when asked
what the GSC's formal policy for de
termining an overlap between groups.
I Jltimately, all funding requests were
approved without dissent.
The GSC also discussed a new
permanent campaigning rule pre
sented by Fraga, who said he
wants "to simplify the rules gov
erning elections." In particular,
Fraga said the new rules will per
manently close loopholes in cur
rent regulations and explicitly de

fine campaigning regulations.
While most GSC members
agreed that stricter campaigning
rules were needed, some believed
that it did not go far enough in one
aspect — limiting The Stanford
Daily from publishing editorials
during the week before elections.
"There is a huge conflict of in
terest between The Daily and spe
cial fees," Meberg said, claiming
that The Daily was "deeply rooted
in the special fees process" since it
could not get money from the stu
dent government. Fraga said such a
provision limiting Daily editorials
could be a topic for discussion, but
it was not added to the rule, which
passed by a vote of 7-2.
Also at last night's meeting, the
GSC brainstormed how to raise
the number of GSC candidates for
the spring elections and met with
Nominations Commission member
Amanda Marshall to discuss how
to improve relations between stu
dent representatives on various
administrative committees and the
