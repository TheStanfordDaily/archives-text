## Ceramics joins the arts scene Club members push for pottery facility on campus 
### JOHN LAXSON 
In ancient times, a kiln for firing pottery
was essential to any respectable settlement.
The Stanford Ceramics Club wants to bring
that same respectability to the Farm, which
currently lacks a ceramics facility
The club, which has about 60 members,
wants to find space for a ceramics studio, an as
pect of the campus arts scene that has been
sorely lacking. The group proposes a facility
with five to six potters' wheels, storage space
and potentially a kiln to fire creations on-site.
The proposed room, which would cover 500 to

700 square feet.could support as many as 2(H)
artists.
At present, students dedicated to pursuing
ceramics must do so at an off-campus studio.
Sophomore Alan Malek.who is helping to cir
culate a petition for a studio, currently travels
to Mother Earth Clay Art Center in Sunny
vale. which he described as "not exactly rea
sonable for a regular commute."
The Art and Art History Department has
so far resisted offering such a facility, although
a sculpture studio is available. Department
Chair Joel Leivick was not immediately avail
able for comment, but Associate Art Prof.
Jody Maxmin said she thought the studio was
a good idea.
"There is a real need for wheels
and kilns," she said. "1 would love to
see archaeology students be able to
try their hand at creating the same
things they study from thousands of
years ago."
I reshman Elyse Marr said she has
been trying all year to connect with
other artists and resources on campus.
"A pottery studio would be a great
way to bring artists together." she
said. "I would be happy to teach a
class to anyone." she added.
On its Web site,
http://ceramics.stanford.edu, the
group quotes President John Hen
nessy from a 2003 column in Stanford
Magazine. It also notes that it has
been in touch with his wife, Andrea
Hennessy, who is supportive of the
idea.
There is precedent for an on-cam
pus pottery studio. Ten years ago, the

basement of Wilbur 1 lull held a pot
ter's wheel which was used by an ac
tive campus pottery club, as well as
members of the outside community.
At some point, however, the base
ment was requisitioned for use as
summer storage, and the wheel was
moved to a trailer where Schwab Res
idential Center and Kimball I kill now
stand. When Schwab was built, the
trailer â€” and its resident wheel
disappeared, and there has been no
on-campus ceramics facility ever
since.
Until the potter's wheel has a
home once again on campus, the Ce
ramics Club has work yet to do. The
group plans to submit a formal pro
posal for a studio to the Office of Stu
dent Affairs within two weeks.
In the meantime, senior lan Whit
man, who runs the club, said he hopes
to collect plenty of signatures in the
next two weeks on the groups Web
site.
"[This will] show that there is sig
nificant interest from the community
in seeing ceramics thrive on campus,"
he said.
