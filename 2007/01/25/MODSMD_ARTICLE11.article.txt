## Ceramics joins the arts scene Club members push for pottery facility on campus 
### JOHN LAXSON 
In ancient times, a kiln for firing pottery
was essential to any respectable settlement.
The Stanford Ceramics Club wants to bring
that same respectability to the Farm, which
currently lacks a ceramics facility
The club, which has about 60 members,
wants to find space for a ceramics studio, an as
pect of the campus arts scene that has been
sorely lacking. The group proposes a facility
with five to six potters' wheels, storage space
and potentially a kiln to fire creations on-site.
The proposed room, which would cover 500 to

700 square feet.could support as many as 2(H)
artists.
At present, students dedicated to pursuing
ceramics must do so at an off-campus studio.
Sophomore Alan Malek.who is helping to cir
culate a petition for a studio, currently travels
to Mother Earth Clay Art Center in Sunny
vale. which he described as "not exactly rea
sonable for a regular commute."
The Art and Art History Department has
so far resisted offering such a facility, although
a sculpture studio is available. Department
Chair Joel Leivick was not immediately avail
able for comment, but Associate Art Prof.
Jody Maxmin said she thought the studio was
a good idea.
