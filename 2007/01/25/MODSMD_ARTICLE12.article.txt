There are several updates in the

Stanford police department has yet to
uncover any trace of credit card,email
or phone use since her disappearance.

ing qualifications exam on her first
try last year.
"She is definitely in the top part
of the class." Konda said.
And while Konda admittedly did
not know Zhou outside of the class
room. he said that she "did not seem
