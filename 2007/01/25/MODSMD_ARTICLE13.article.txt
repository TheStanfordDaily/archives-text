## Stanford scores an A-for sustainability Not settling, University works to improve in areas of transparency 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
An A- is something to be proud of, but it could be
better.
At least that was the message yesterday, alter a re
port from the Sustainable 1 ndowments Initiative gave
Stanford high marks tor its environmental initiatives.
In its first report card, the I Jniversity received an A
,a mark that represented an average across seven cate
gories. The grade put Stanford at the topof a pack of the
100 richest colleges and universities in the nation, along
with Harvard, Williams and Dartmouth.
"Stanford is in a strong position. It is the best in ( al
ifornia and the West," said Mark Orlowski, the founder
and executive director of the Institute. 'But Stanford
may not earn an A- grade next year."
The University got full "A" grades in the areas til ad
ministration, food and recycling programs,green build

ing, investment priorities and shareholder engagement.
For its efforts to combat climate change, the I Jniver
sity received a B. For the level of transparency in the en
dowment fund, Stanford was given a C\
"I think these results mean that the University lias
been working very hard in this area to further its lead
ership in both education and sustainable practices." said
ITierese Brekke. the sustainability manager in the Of
fice of I.and. Buildings and Real Estate Development.
She chairs the Sustainability Working Group, an ad
visory committee to the President and Provost charged
with making recommendations about campus environ
mental policy.
"There are tons of great people on this." she said.
' Hie University has been doing a lot of things for a re
ally long time."
Ihe Sustainable Endowments Initiative used a point
system to assess each school's performance. Ihe most
points went to schools that have already implemented
programs and practices, according to Orlowski. Some
points went to schools who are currently implementing
projects. Fewer points went to schools with planned but
imimplemented projects.
Flie president of Stanford Students for Sustainabili

ty was surprised that the University ranked so high.
"I do believe that the people who are working at
Stanford are very committed to helping sustainability,
but a lot of times it doesn't translate into actual proj
ects." Hmma Yuen, a coterminal masters student in so
ciology, said. "Translating it into major commitments,
standards ;ind projects is where we need to improve the
most."
Administrators credited students for being involved
in constructive ways.
"They've put pressure in the right way and in a lot of
ways." said Jeff Koseff, co-director of the Woods Insti
tute for the Environment, an institute launched two
years ago to spearhead environmental stewardship ini
tiatives.
EN I )OWM ENT TRANSPARENCY
The University was faulted in the report for a lack of
transparency in its endowment holdings.
As a private university, Stanford has the right to
keep proprietary financial information away from the
public eye. Investment managers
generally see this as an advantage
because competitors cannot see
where money is being allocated.
But. from the Institute's perspec
tive. too much is being held back
from potential scrutiny.
"There are endowments that are
roughly the size of Stanford which
do well on transparency," said Or
lowski. pointing to Dartmouth,
which has opened up some of its
books in recent years.
But a senior University official
told The Daily that it is crucial to
maintain this level of discretion.
"We don't plan to get into the
business of providing full trans
parency around the portfolio," said
John Powers, who manages the en
dowment fund as the president and
chief executive officer of the Stan
ford Management Company. "As
we showed with our responsiveness
on the Darfur issue |divestment],
we're very sensitive to those areas
where there is a real unanimity of
opinion around the University on a
topic."
Koseff said that the grading
mechanism puts private schools like
Harvard. Yale and Stanford at a dis
advantage.
"They have the information, and
they just want to keep it the way it
is," he said. "I think sustainability is
definitely a metric that should be
looked at."
The report applauded Stanford
for "leading by example" in the area
of "shareholder engagement." The
University was the first to establish
anti-global warming guidelines in
proxy voting.
CLIMATE CHANGE & ENERGY
Some say the University has done

good work on increasing energy effi
ciency, but they add that other
schools have taken a lead.
"The fact that we haven't made a
commitment to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions while other schools
did that years ago is another reason
we're lagging behind," Yuen said.
University leaders said that an
analysis is being done on how much
carbon is being emitted into the air
based on the energy that the Univer
sity uses.
"We expect to have that complet
ed within a month or so," Brekke
said. "Once it is completed, we'll
have a base line of information from
which we can set some realistic goals
for CO2 reductions."
At New York University, Orlows
ki said, the school acquired enough
renewable energy credits to entirely
offset their consumption. The Uni
versity of British Columbia, he said,
has cut carbon dioxide omissions by
30 percent.
"Stanford is doing well," he said,
"but there's certainly room for im
provement, and that's what the B in
dicates."
WATER CONSERVATION
One topic not included in the re
port card is water usage, an area
where the University has set high
standards.
"Unfortunately water conserva
tion itself was not a separate catego
ry," Brekke said.
Retrofits, more drought-tolerant
landscaping and better irrigation
helped decrease daily water con
sumption on campus from 2.7 mil
lion gallons per day in the 2000-2001
school year to 2.2 million gallons per
day last year.
Koseff said he was excited that
the University is being recognized
for years of work on environmental
issues.
"It's a big encouragement to keep
up the good work." he said, "but we
have lots more to do."

Ihe Sustainable Endowments Initiative used a point
system to assess each school's performance. Ihe most
points went to schools that have already implemented
programs and practices, according to Orlowski. Some
points went to schools who are currently implementing
projects. Fewer points went to schools with planned but
imimplemented projects.
Flie president of Stanford Students for Sustainabili

ty was surprised that the University ranked so high.
"I do believe that the people who are working at
Stanford are very committed to helping sustainability,
but a lot of times it doesn't translate into actual proj
ects." Hmma Yuen, a coterminal masters student in so
ciology, said. "Translating it into major commitments,
standards ;ind projects is where we need to improve the
most."
Administrators credited students for being involved
in constructive ways.
"They've put pressure in the right way and in a lot of
ways." said Jeff Koseff, co-director of the Woods Insti
tute for the Environment, an institute launched two
years ago to spearhead environmental stewardship ini
tiatives.
EN I )OWM ENT TRANSPARENCY
The University was faulted in the report for a lack of
transparency in its endowment holdings.
As a private university, Stanford has the right to
keep proprietary financial information away from the
public eye. Investment managers
generally see this as an advantage
because competitors cannot see
where money is being allocated.
But. from the Institute's perspec
tive. too much is being held back
from potential scrutiny.
"There are endowments that are
roughly the size of Stanford which
do well on transparency," said Or
lowski. pointing to Dartmouth,
which has opened up some of its
books in recent years.
But a senior University official
told The Daily that it is crucial to
maintain this level of discretion.
"We don't plan to get into the
business of providing full trans
parency around the portfolio," said
John Powers, who manages the en
dowment fund as the president and
chief executive officer of the Stan
ford Management Company. "As
we showed with our responsiveness
on the Darfur issue |divestment],
we're very sensitive to those areas
where there is a real unanimity of
opinion around the University on a
topic."
Koseff said that the grading
mechanism puts private schools like
Harvard. Yale and Stanford at a dis
advantage.
"They have the information, and
they just want to keep it the way it
is," he said. "I think sustainability is
definitely a metric that should be
looked at."
The report applauded Stanford
for "leading by example" in the area
of "shareholder engagement." The
University was the first to establish
anti-global warming guidelines in
proxy voting.
CLIMATE CHANGE & ENERGY
Some say the University has done

good work on increasing energy effi
ciency, but they add that other
schools have taken a lead.
"The fact that we haven't made a
commitment to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions while other schools
did that years ago is another reason
we're lagging behind," Yuen said.
University leaders said that an
analysis is being done on how much
carbon is being emitted into the air
based on the energy that the Univer
sity uses.
"We expect to have that complet
ed within a month or so," Brekke
said. "Once it is completed, we'll
have a base line of information from
which we can set some realistic goals
for CO2 reductions."
At New York University, Orlows
ki said, the school acquired enough
renewable energy credits to entirely
offset their consumption. The Uni
versity of British Columbia, he said,
has cut carbon dioxide omissions by
30 percent.
"Stanford is doing well," he said,
"but there's certainly room for im
provement, and that's what the B in
dicates."
WATER CONSERVATION
One topic not included in the re
port card is water usage, an area
where the University has set high
standards.
"Unfortunately water conserva
tion itself was not a separate catego
ry," Brekke said.
Retrofits, more drought-tolerant
landscaping and better irrigation
helped decrease daily water con
sumption on campus from 2.7 mil
lion gallons per day in the 2000-2001
school year to 2.2 million gallons per
day last year.
Koseff said he was excited that
the University is being recognized
for years of work on environmental
issues.
"It's a big encouragement to keep
up the good work." he said, "but we
have lots more to do."
