## Stanford scores an A-for sustainability Not settling, University works to improve in areas of transparency 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
An A- is something to be proud of, but it could be
better.
At least that was the message yesterday, alter a re
port from the Sustainable 1 ndowments Initiative gave
Stanford high marks tor its environmental initiatives.
In its first report card, the I Jniversity received an A
,a mark that represented an average across seven cate
gories. The grade put Stanford at the topof a pack of the
100 richest colleges and universities in the nation, along
with Harvard, Williams and Dartmouth.
"Stanford is in a strong position. It is the best in ( al
ifornia and the West," said Mark Orlowski, the founder
and executive director of the Institute. 'But Stanford
may not earn an A- grade next year."
The University got full "A" grades in the areas til ad
ministration, food and recycling programs,green build

ing, investment priorities and shareholder engagement.
For its efforts to combat climate change, the I Jniver
sity received a B. For the level of transparency in the en
dowment fund, Stanford was given a C\
"I think these results mean that the University lias
been working very hard in this area to further its lead
ership in both education and sustainable practices." said
ITierese Brekke. the sustainability manager in the Of
fice of I.and. Buildings and Real Estate Development.
She chairs the Sustainability Working Group, an ad
visory committee to the President and Provost charged
with making recommendations about campus environ
mental policy.
"There are tons of great people on this." she said.
' Hie University has been doing a lot of things for a re
ally long time."
Ihe Sustainable Endowments Initiative used a point
system to assess each school's performance. Ihe most
points went to schools that have already implemented
programs and practices, according to Orlowski. Some
points went to schools who are currently implementing
projects. Fewer points went to schools with planned but
imimplemented projects.
Flie president of Stanford Students for Sustainabili

ty was surprised that the University ranked so high.
"I do believe that the people who are working at
Stanford are very committed to helping sustainability,
but a lot of times it doesn't translate into actual proj
ects." Hmma Yuen, a coterminal masters student in so
ciology, said. "Translating it into major commitments,
standards ;ind projects is where we need to improve the
most."
Administrators credited students for being involved
in constructive ways.
"They've put pressure in the right way and in a lot of
ways." said Jeff Koseff, co-director of the Woods Insti
tute for the Environment, an institute launched two
years ago to spearhead environmental stewardship ini
tiatives.
