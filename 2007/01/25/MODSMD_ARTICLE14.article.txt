Linda Kimball, director of investment re
sponsibility for APIR-L. began the meeting
with a historical account of how the panel was
created as an ethical compass for the I Jniver
sity's investment decisions. Following Yale's

form through which concerned com
munity members may submit their
objections about ongoing decisions.
Current issues range from concern
over University relations with com
panies employing sweatshops to busi
nesses involved in Israel and Pales
tine.
A representative from the Asian
American Activism Committee
voiced concern over Stanford's possi

hie involvement with companies that
benefit from illegal sweatshop labor.
"As far as I know, there are likely
to be very few, if any, licenses that con
tract with manufacturers with inap
propriate labor practices." Director
of Business Development and pan
elist Susan Weistein said.
Another audience member ques
tioned the University's investments
in companies such as Bechtel and
Caterpillar, which have connections
to the West Bank.
'ITiough the members of the panel
admittedly had no specific knowl
edge of such dealings, they stressed
that concerned community members
can use APIR-L's Web site to submit

requests for review. Kimball empha
sized the fact that such input regard
ing responsibility in investments from
the community is vital to the panel.
"We can spend a lot of time and
money setting up all these venues for
dialogue, but if no one uses them, all
the effort is wasted." she said.
Panelist Alan Acosta, associate
vice president and director of Univer
sity Communications, responded to
the concern that these online requests
are merely given a cursory once-over.
"Don't think that all requests are
simply judged by what is written on a
sheet ol paper." he said. "The panel
has a tradition and practice of meet
ing with people."
