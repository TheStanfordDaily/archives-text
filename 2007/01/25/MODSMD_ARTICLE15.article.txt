## Editorial Board Global warming: Sooner than we think 
### 
With global temperatures on the rise.
A 1 (lore's movie popping up in
rental stores nationwide and a new
bout with 1 11 Nino expected this year, envi
ronmental consciousness is as high as ever.
And yet. even with all these weather head
lines. the tragedy in New Orleans and the
dire warnings of scientists, it is still some
times difficult to relate to a problem that
won't start wreaking havoc for at least an
other 10 or 20 years.
Or st) we think. According to a paper
published by Stanford and NASA re
searchers this past December in Geophysi
cal Research Letters, the problems we
thought were in store for the future have al
ready begun — and they're in our own
backyard.
ITie paper in question was co-authored
by Stanford Civil and Environmental Engi
neering Prof. Mark Jacobson and summa
rizes the findings of a study on the high lev
els of aerosol emissions and their impact in
California. Sulfate aerosol particles are the
products of the combustion of fossil fuels
and are produced en masse in the burning
of coal and oil in industrial processes. They
are found at high levels in vehicle exhaust,
in slash and burn farming and in power
plant pollution. Aerosols are also produced
naturally by volcanic eruptions and desert
dust storms, though such naturally pro
duced aersols are not found at nearly the
same levels as their man-made counter
parts.
Once released, aerosols become sus
pended in the atmosphere, scattering and
absorbing solar radiation. As they accumu
late. this scattering and absorption effect
can result in haze and redder sunrises and
sunsets. Aerosols can also impact cloud par
ticles. raising the number of water droplets
while making each droplet smaller. This in
turn changes the cloud's overall pattern of
reflection and absorption of sunlight, de
flecting light back into space. Because
aerosols typically remain in the atmosphere
for only several days and because they do
not distribute evenly over the globe, their
effects on global climate patterns have been
difficult to study in comparison to other
greenhouse gases. For climate modelers,
knowing how much aerosol is located with
in a particular region is essential to studying

its impact. In Jacobson's study, California
was his targeted region.
According to Jacobson's findings,
aerosol emissions are impacting us locally
by reducing overall wind speeds and rainfall
in the state. Using computer modeling, wind
speed measurements and data from NASA
satellites, his study found that aerosols
lower ground-level temperatures and also
impede convection currents that bring
faster winds closer to the Earth's surface.
The net result is that near-surface wind
speeds are significantly reduced. In turn,
slower winds reduce the power generating
capacity of wind turbines, which are both a
renewable energy source and a viable alter
native to fossil fuels.
Even more critically, slower winds and
aerosol rich clouds impair the water cycle,
reducing rates both of evaporation and pre
cipitation. In California, the study estimat
ed that aerosol pollution may reduce pre
cipitation by as much as five percent annu
ally. straining the state's water supply and
potentially leading to drought. In an article
in The Stanford Report. Jacobson stated
that. "The aerosol pollution in California
could be causing an annual loss of water
supply equivalent to the storage in the
planned upper San Joaquin River dam. with
a capacity of 1.3 million acre feet." Given
California's growing population, the strain
on the water supply will become even more
of a problem in years to come.
I*his problem is critical, but not in
tractable. Because of the short lifespan of
aerosols in the atmosphere, if emissions
were significantly reduced the problem
would lessen in kind. Jacobson emphasizes
that California can ease off her dependence
on fossil fuels by investing in renewable-en
ergy sources, such as wind farms and solar
thermal power plants. For our part as stu
dents. we can choose to invest in battery
electric and hydrogen-fueled cars if we have
the funds,or we can make a conscious effort
to drive the old combustion-engine around
a little less. We can use our voices in the po
litical process to push through necessary
change in the state's energy industry. Most
importantly, we can educate ourselves and
those around us about the important envi
ronmental issues that we face so we can
work together to forge a sustainable future.
