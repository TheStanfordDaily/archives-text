As I was browsing craigslist yester
day, dreaming of fixing up a vintage
Alfa Romeo on my annual income
of $250.1 wandered over to my favorite sec
tion of the site: Missed Connections.
In case you're not familiar with the con
cept.missed connections forums allow people
to post about mystery figures they have
glimpsed and with whom they hope to re
unite. You can live with the hope of once again
meeting that "Elegant Lesbian Shopping For
Crawdads." provided she reads your ad.
Sometimes people use the service to
send out messages in bottles to people they
see every day Tell that chisel-chinned hottie
at Starbucks that when he makes your latte,
he breaks your heart.
Even if you know your fascination won't
be reciprocated, you can use the service to
get something off your chest.
"Hey Pregnant Brunette Working at
Wendy's — thanks for the S I D."
The fact of the matter is. reading other
people's social epiphanies, fleeting desires,
is the Grover Cleveland of guilty pleasures.
Not the best by any means, but you'll be

back. I can even understand the appeal of
posting: Sure, it's completely ineffective, but
sometimes an ephemeral vision of a girl on
a bus or a Peruvian stock clerk jostling your
arm at Safeway can indelibly mark the fab
ric of your day.
And where else are we more changed
than at Stanford? With only 1.600 under
graduates. I've made a lot of connections,
but there are also a few memorable ones
I've missed.

approached them, one interrupted
their quiet conversation to scream:
"Pony hair!"
Me: Slightly sweaty, running late
for section, turning on my heel to dis
creetly follow them halfway to the
bookstore. Apparently they were
talking about pony-hair shoes. Be
tween you and me. I have my doubts.
You: Riding your bike from
Meyer Library around midnight,
wearing helmet, elbow pads and a
surgical mask. You screeched to a
stop and lit a cigarette, lifting the
mask to take deep drags, then hiked
off into the night, exhaling through
your nose with abandon.
Me: Offering my trusty Bic. You
did not accept.
You: Strolling down Mayfield on
the first bone-baking day of spring,
periodically stopping in front of
trees to wonder aloud what they
were thinking about. You paused at
one whose roots sneaked under the
concrete to encroach upon a street
light. Were the telephone poles jeal
ous, you asked no one in particular.
Me: Breathing in the cherry blos

You: Driving a dark gray SUV with

the license plate "H4TL3SS". I'm not
sure if the plate is a CS major's idea of
a joke or whether it was the work of
some überl337 haxOr at the DMV. but
you were not. in fact, wearing a hat.
Me: Making an illegal left turn
onto Palm Drive.
You: Speed walking under the
Braun Music Center archway on a
Tuesday morning, slurping away at a
ceramic bowl full of Frosted Mini-
Wheats with a metal spoon. You
stopped by the post office and sucked
down the last dregs of milk, spraying
droplets on your goatee, then hid the
bowl and spoon under a low shrub
bery. When I checked again five hours
later, they were gone.
Me: Eating yogurt, with a lamely
plastic utensil.
You: Gazing imperially, arms
clanging with silver rings and
bracelets too numerous to count,
hatting tinsel eyelashes, boldly geo
metrical neon shawl clutched around
your shoulders, three-inch acrylic
nails a-clatter. Your bearing is regal
and silence roars — Empress of
Pangea, High Holy Priestess of im
mortality and office supplies.
Me: Buying books. Nervous.
You: An elderly Asian man. carry

binders, galloping at breakneck

dime, dropped your briefcase and
binders on the ground and circled

the "Large Torso" statue in front of
the Cummings Art Building five or
six times, running your fingertips
over the sculpture's disembodied
hips. Gathered everything up and re
sumed your sprint.
Me: Reading "Farewell to Arms"
on the art library steps.
You: Barreling down Mayfield on
your bike on a Thursday night, steering
with one hand and using the other to
balance an overflowing red cup; the
drink sloshing over the sides left an
acrid alcoholic mist in your wake. You
hiked straight into the open door of a
cop car parked on Frenchman's Way
and slurred: "G'evenin',occifer!" then
burped and continued your flight
down Frat Row.
Me: Making eye contact with the
puzzled policeman and shrugging
with all the sobriety 1 could muster.

droplets on your goatee, then hid the
bowl and spoon under a low shrub

later, they were gone.
Me: Eating yogurt, with a lamely
plastic utensil.
You: Gazing imperially, arms
clanging with silver rings and
bracelets too numerous to count,
hatting tinsel eyelashes, boldly geo
metrical neon shawl clutched around
your shoulders, three-inch acrylic
nails a-clatter. Your bearing is regal
and silence roars — Empress of
Pangea, High Holy Priestess of im
mortality and office supplies.
Me: Buying books. Nervous.
You: An elderly Asian man. carry
ing a briefcase and an armful of
binders, galloping at breakneck
speed from Green Library toward
the Oval. Then you stopped on a
dime, dropped your briefcase and
binders on the ground and circled

the "Large Torso" statue in front of
the Cummings Art Building five or

Me: Reading "Farewell to Arms"
on the art library steps.
You: Barreling down Mayfield on
your bike on a Thursday night, steering

balance an overflowing red cup; the
drink sloshing over the sides left an
acrid alcoholic mist in your wake. You
hiked straight into the open door of a
cop car parked on Frenchman's Way
and slurred: "G'evenin',occifer!" then
burped and continued your flight
down Frat Row.
Me: Making eye contact with the
puzzled policeman and shrugging

You: Standing on your head in the
garden bordering the Slav Dom
parking lot, apparently nude, torso
blocked by an errant fence. Lan
rounded buttocks at eye level, lithe
nymph legs stretching into the sky.

leaves. Also, you are a tree.
Me: Kind of in love with you.

You: Sending in comments, complains,
connections of your own (this means
yon. Pony Hair!). Me: Reachable at

land: American president for two non
consecutive terms.
