As I was browsing craigslist yester
day, dreaming of fixing up a vintage
Alfa Romeo on my annual income
of $250.1 wandered over to my favorite sec
tion of the site: Missed Connections.
In case you're not familiar with the con
cept.missed connections forums allow people
to post about mystery figures they have
glimpsed and with whom they hope to re
unite. You can live with the hope of once again
meeting that "Elegant Lesbian Shopping For
Crawdads." provided she reads your ad.
Sometimes people use the service to
send out messages in bottles to people they
see every day Tell that chisel-chinned hottie
at Starbucks that when he makes your latte,
he breaks your heart.
Even if you know your fascination won't
be reciprocated, you can use the service to
get something off your chest.
"Hey Pregnant Brunette Working at
Wendy's â€” thanks for the S I D."
The fact of the matter is. reading other
people's social epiphanies, fleeting desires,
is the Grover Cleveland of guilty pleasures.
Not the best by any means, but you'll be

back. I can even understand the appeal of
posting: Sure, it's completely ineffective, but
sometimes an ephemeral vision of a girl on
a bus or a Peruvian stock clerk jostling your
arm at Safeway can indelibly mark the fab
ric of your day.
And where else are we more changed
than at Stanford? With only 1.600 under
graduates. I've made a lot of connections,
but there are also a few memorable ones
I've missed.
You: A tall, well-built undergraduate
with rippling Fabio-esque locks, passing a
gaggle of middle-aged German women on
