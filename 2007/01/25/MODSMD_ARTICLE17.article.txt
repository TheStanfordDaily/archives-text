Ilove my Chinese textbook. Over the
course of the year, we've been learning
how to tell other people that they're re
ally fat. why "four-eyed frogs" (a.k.a. geeks)
are bad people to date and how to avoid so
cial events in order to study Chinese. But
stories about dating (which is.obviously, the
main thing that students are interested in ...)
dominate much of the book.
Ihis results in numerous hilarious dis
cussions in class. Before Tuesday, one of my
fondest memories of Chinese class was
when our teacher asked everyone about
their previous boy- or girlfriends, and one
guy admitted that he'd never had a girl
friend Ihis turned into a 10-ish minute
grilling session that involved explaining to
our teacher what a "player" was. Everyone
laughed when he stated, "I always find
something about a girl that I don't like "and
our teacher taught us how to say "picky."
But this Tuesday managed to top even

that. (Although that might have had some
thing to do with having a fever and being
doped up on anti-coughing tea. By the way.
Yogi Tea's "Throat Comfort" is much more
effective than cough syrup, and it doesn't
make you drowsy. Just FYI. because sore
throat seems to be running amok around
campus.)
TTie class basically turned into a long rant
about how modern girls want everything. At
one point, our teacher went around the
room, asking everyone whether they'd be
willing to be a stay-at-home dad or mom.
