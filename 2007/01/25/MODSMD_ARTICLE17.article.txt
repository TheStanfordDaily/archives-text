# Wrong about Mr. Right
## 
### 
(Chinese) Bainui Wangzi
(English) A White-Horse Prince
Ilove my Chinese textbook. Over the
course of the year, we've been learning
how to tell other people that they're re
ally fat. why "four-eyed frogs" (a.k.a. geeks)
are bad people to date and how to avoid so
cial events in order to study Chinese. But
stories about dating (which is.obviously, the
main thing that students are interested in ...)
dominate much of the book.
Ihis results in numerous hilarious dis
cussions in class. Before Tuesday, one of my
fondest memories of Chinese class was
when our teacher asked everyone about
their previous boy- or girlfriends, and one
guy admitted that he'd never had a girl
friend Ihis turned into a 10-ish minute
grilling session that involved explaining to
our teacher what a "player" was. Everyone
laughed when he stated, "I always find
something about a girl that I don't like "and
our teacher taught us how to say "picky."
But this Tuesday managed to top even

that. (Although that might have had some
thing to do with having a fever and being
doped up on anti-coughing tea. By the way.
Yogi Tea's "Throat Comfort" is much more
effective than cough syrup, and it doesn't
make you drowsy. Just FYI. because sore
throat seems to be running amok around
campus.)
TTie class basically turned into a long rant
about how modern girls want everything. At
one point, our teacher went around the
room, asking everyone whether they'd be
willing to be a stay-at-home dad or mom.

From the Arm Chair
Every girl said "no" and every guy
said "yes." (Clearly polling a total of
eight students — three guys and five
girls — is an excellent data-gather
ing technique.)
So then several of the guys in the
class proceeded to rant about how
dating sucks because girls both
want chivalry and equality. Are we
really that awful? I've heard a num
ber of complaints from girls (I have
obviously never faced this myself)
who want to pursue careers of vari
ous forms, but still want to do the
"get married and have a family"
thing. Almost inevitably, we get
asked: "So you really think you can
have it all. huh?" Since when does
that make sense? Male members of
the species have never had to
choose between a career and a fam

ily. unless they wanted to become a
priest or monk. Guys have always
"had it all."
Now. I don't really want a "white
horse prince," as the Chinese phrase
goes, any more than 1 want a knight
in shining armor. Chivalry and its
modern materializations have a ten
dency to terrify me. Plus, horses and
armor just aren't that useful these
days. But according to our Chinese
textbook, girls still expect guys to
pay for everything, even as they're
demanding equality. This flat gener
alization came complete with a little
cartoon with a girl pointing at the bill
and yelling at a guy with question
marks over his head.
The "knight in shining armor"
and "white-horse prince" images
make me want to hurl something at a
wall. I don't want some valiant de
fender who has pretty trappings de
spite killing lots of people. But look
at all the similarities between the
two — high rank (knight or prince),
the fighter (armor and horses usual

ly denote such) and the beauty
(white or shining). There's got to he
something to that. So why don't I
want one? Huh? Who really doesn't
want a well-to-do guy. capable of
battling off anyone who challenges
your reputation and looks great on
top of that?
But back to the idiom of the
week, I find it rather amusing that
both Chinese and English have some
cliched version of "chivalrous Mr.
Right." Even the expression "Mr.
Right," 1 suppose, falls into this cate
gory. You never hear a guy talk about
wanting a "princess in a tower" or
"Ms. Right " nor are there any cute
little canned phrases in the language
that might describe such.
Is it yet obvious that I'm taking
the "Language and Gender" class?
Thank you for perpetuating
stereotypes, and have a nice day.
