## GROUND Men open tough three-game stretch against talented USC 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIORS STAFF WRITER 
In their upcoming stretch, the
Cardinal will play three home
games in seven days, against No. 25
Southern California, No. 3 UCLA
and perennial force Gonzaga.
"This is where it really picks up,
I guess," freshman center Robin
Lopez said during the Cardinal's
weekly press conference.
The importance of the stretch
varies depending on whom you ask.
Sophomore forward Lawrence Hill
called it the "make-or-break" part
of the men's basketball season (12-
5,4-3 Pacific-1G Conference), while
head coach Trent Johnson acknowl
edged that each of the games will be
like facing a pro team.
But everyone agrees that it's not
going to be easy.
"This will prove where we're
at." senior guard Fred Washington
said. "It's going to be a tough
stretch. We're going to have to man
up and get ready to play."
The games will begin tonight
against a defensive-minded USC
team (15-5.5-2) that has crept into
the national rankings for the first
time in nearly five years. Under sec
ond-year head coach Tim Floyd, the
Trojans have tightened the screws
on opponents, holding 18 of the 20
teams they've played below 40.4
percent shooting from the field.
"They're great athletes with

great quickness, and they've really
bought into the system," Johnson
said. "The hardest thing to do is to
get talented kids to buy in because
they're usually looking to score.
They have good quickness, and
they get in your face."
USC has been able to put things
together this year after a string of
seasons in which it fielded talented
teams that failed to win ballgames.
The team's attack features three
perimeter players who are as good
as any guard tandem in the league:
juniors Nick Young and Gabe
Pruitt. and senior Lodrick Stewart.
The Trojans have also benefited
from favorable scheduling, playing
five of their first seven games at
home.The team has hung with every
club it has played in the Pac-10. Only
two last-second shots separate it
from a perfect conference record.
By comparison, early favorite
Washington has all but been
bounced from the Pac-10 race after
losing all five of its Pac-10 road
games to start the conference
schedule at 1-6.
After Pruitt was ruled academi
cally ineligible for the first 11
games. Young took over as the
team's leading scorer with 17.2
points per game. Stewart, a sharp
shooter who made six three-point
attempts in a game earlier this sea

called it the "make-or-break" part
of the men's basketball season (12-
5,4-3 Pacific-1G Conference), while
head coach Trent Johnson acknowl
edged that each of the games will be
like facing a pro team.
But everyone agrees that it's not
going to be easy.
"This will prove where we're
at." senior guard Fred Washington
said. "It's going to be a tough
stretch. We're going to have to man
up and get ready to play."
The games will begin tonight
against a defensive-minded USC
team (15-5.5-2) that has crept into
the national rankings for the first
time in nearly five years. Under sec
ond-year head coach Tim Floyd, the
Trojans have tightened the screws
on opponents, holding 18 of the 20
teams they've played below 40.4
percent shooting from the field.
"They're great athletes with

great quickness, and they've really
bought into the system," Johnson
said. "The hardest thing to do is to
get talented kids to buy in because
they're usually looking to score.
They have good quickness, and
they get in your face."
USC has been able to put things
together this year after a string of
seasons in which it fielded talented
teams that failed to win ballgames.
The team's attack features three
perimeter players who are as good
as any guard tandem in the league:
juniors Nick Young and Gabe
Pruitt. and senior Lodrick Stewart.
The Trojans have also benefited
from favorable scheduling, playing
five of their first seven games at
home.The team has hung with every
club it has played in the Pac-10. Only
two last-second shots separate it
from a perfect conference record.
By comparison, early favorite
Washington has all but been
bounced from the Pac-10 race after
losing all five of its Pac-10 road
games to start the conference
schedule at 1-6.
After Pruitt was ruled academi
cally ineligible for the first 11
games. Young took over as the
team's leading scorer with 17.2
points per game. Stewart, a sharp
shooter who made six three-point
attempts in a game earlier this sea
son, ranks second on the team in

Much like the team as a whole, sophomore guard Anthony Goods has fared well in Maples Pavilion. He averages 14.4 points per
game at home.
scoring with 13.9 points.
Although Pruitt's scoring
dropped from 16.9 points per game
to 9.7, he has by many accounts as
sumed more of a leadership role this
season, especially important after
the death of point guard Ryan Fran
cis in a drive-by shooting during the
off-season.
"1 can't imagine losing a player"
Washington said of Francis' death.
"We were all just speechless. I can't
even begin to imagine what they're
going through, but I'm glad they're
pushing through."
USC has been aided by the early
development of freshman point
guard Daniel 1 lackett. It has also re
ceived a huge boost from forward
Taj Gibson, an early front-runner for
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. Gib

Stanford, on the other hand, has
come out on top in six of its last

caped with a narrow 58-56 victory
last season, when Chris Hernandez
made two free throws with four sec
