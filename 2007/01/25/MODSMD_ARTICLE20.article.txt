# Class of 2007: Class of the Iraq War
## 
### 
As a member of the class of 2007. 1
graduated high school and entered
Stanford the same year President
Bush sent troops to Iraq. When my peers and
I graduate in June, we will ho the graduating
class of a war. What does that mean? What
does it mean that the United States has been
in Iraq as long as we've been in college? What
does it mean that we've been in college as
long as the United States has been in Iraq?
While we've been studying, thousands of
American kids have been fighting in a war,
killing other people and seeing other people
get killed.These kids aren't so different from
us: Contrary to popular belief, they're about
as wealthy and as well educated as average
citizens. Their views on the war diverge from
our own views much less than you would ex
pect. Almost a year ago, 72 percent of them
believed the United States should exit Iraq
within a year. Today, there are more troops

who disapprove of the president's handling
of the war than those who approve of it.
Being the class of the Iraq War means that
over 3,000 of these soldiers — about 1,000
more people than are in the class of 2007 —
have died while we've been at Stanford.
If I could ignore history, if 1 could shut out
the lessons of the past. I would say that our
position as the class of the Iraq War means
that we will never again support military ac
tion against another country unless a clear

and present clanger to our national security
has been proven and we have an assurance
that our engagement will be limited.
But 1 cannot ignore history. I cannot ig
nore that over 58,000 American soldiers
died in Vietnam. I cannot ignore that four
separate classes of students entered college
and graduated while they died. And 1 cannot
ignore that those four classes of the war in
Vietnam allowed the war in Iraq to occur 28
years later. If the classes of the Vietnam War
pledged "never again" and it happened
again, how can 1, as a member of the class of
the Iraq War. tell the same lie?
My only hope is that our generation is dif
ferent than the one that came before us.
After taking the oath of office as the 35th
president of the United States, John F.
Kennedy declared "that the torch has been

passed to a new generation of Amer
icans— born in this century, tem
pered by war. disciplined by'a hard
and bitter peace, proud of our an
cient heritage — and unwilling to
witness or permit the slow undoing
of those human rights to which this
Nation has always been committed,
and to which we are committed
today at home and around the
world."
With Barack Obama's announce
ment that he will seek the presidency in
2(X)8.1 contend that the torch will again
be passed to a new generation of Amer

icans — bom after the baby boomers,
tempered by a decade of Republican
control of Congress, disciplined by a
war that has killed hundreds of thou
sands and has cost hundreds of billions,
proud of our multiculturalism — and
unwilling to witness or to permit the
slow undoing of those civil rights to
which this Nation has always been com
mitted. but which are today threatened
by the fear of terrorism and by the big
otry of religious zealots.
1 ask again: What does it mean to
be the class of a war? What does it
mean to have this torch passed on to
us? Will we commit the same mis
takes as our parents or will we learn
from history as they failed to?
I contend that we are a different
generation — a generation bold
enough to elect a black man or a

woman to the highest office, wise
enough to understand our impact on
the natural world we live in and en
lightened enough to know that race,
gender, sexuality and class matter.
As a member of this new genera
tion and of the class of 2007,1 say —
not with certainty, hut with infinite
hope — that never again will we go
to war when a threat to our security
has not been proven and when there
is no assurance of overwhelming vic
tory. Never again will we let our fear
overwhelm our intelligence.
