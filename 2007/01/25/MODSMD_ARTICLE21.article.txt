## Holocaust denial comes to Stanford 
### AMICHAI MAGEN 
The Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East (CJMF) and its splinter group. Students
Confronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAl).are
at it again: pulling no punches in their relent
less campaign to demonize the Jewish People
and delegitimize Israel. Tonight, the two stu
dent groups are stooping to new lows and
aligning themselves with the most radical el
ements in the Middle East by hosting Nor
man Finkelstein on this campus.
Finkelstein is an academic joke, and a bad
one at that.The 54-year-old Assistant Profes
sor at DePaul University. Illinois, has been
hired and let go by several middling schools,
before gaining his current (untenured) posi
tion in 2003. The New York Times Book Re
view has described his work as "juvenile,"
"arrogant" and "stupid."
I le is an American-born son of two I lolo
caust survivors who began his career as an anti-
Israel political agitator — circumstances which
on their own make his claims to objective histor
ical scholarship on the Holocaust highly sus
pect. Finkelstein can neither read nor write Ger
man. Being unable to access many of the
sources that are the foundation of sound re
search in this highly complex and sensitive field
has not prevented Finkelstein from passing
sweeping, tendentious and twisted judgments
on one of the saddest, and most important,
episodes in human history.
In essence. Finkelstein's argument is as
follows: The Jews, in a fiendish conspiracy,
have fabricated a "Holocaust Industry" in
order to portray themselves as victims, cyni
cally exploit their suffering and consolidate
Israel as a power set on regional domination.

If the Holocaust had never happened, the
Jews would have invented it themselves,
since the Holocaust served their diabolical
quest for money and global imperialism.
Iliis thesis is a hodge-podge of pathologi
cal paranoia, ignorance, malice and brutal
disrespect to the memory of the millions of
human beings systematically murdered by
the Nazis (Christians, Jews and Muslims). If
we applied Finkelstein's warped logic, we
would conclude that Blacks "exploit" the his
tory of slavery to obtain civil rights gains or
that in the 20th-century, women have created
a "Feminism Industry" in a cruel attempt to
gain power and subjugate men. How many
Einsteins, how many Kafkas. how many
Menuhins. how many lives (born and yet to
be born) were lost forever in the furnaces of
Auschwitz? The world will never know. But
to suggest that the Jewish People, or anyone
else on this planet, has "profited" from the
extinguishing of so many souls — each of in
finite value in its own right — is monstrous
beyond belief.
Finkelstein's brand of Holocaust denial is
all the more pernicious for its relative subtle
ty. Unlike David Irving — who claims the gas
chambers never existed and that Hitler was
the Jews' greatest friend — Finkelstein (who
calls Irving "a good historian") admits that it
did happen, and then proceeds to turn the
I lolocaust into a tool with which to attack its
primary victim. In the Finkelstenian mind, the
Jews, and the Jews alone, are prohibited from
collective mourning. Jewish insistence that
the Holocaust be remembered becomes an
act of unforgivable Jewish aggression, for
which Israel must be "censured," to use one of
his favorite expressions of attack. This Holo

caust erosion is at once more subversive and
more dangerous than the outright factual de
nial practiced by the likes of Irving or Iran's
President, Ahmedinejad. It insidiously as
saults our moral imperative to remember the
1 lolocaust and eats away at its chief lesson to
humanity: Never again!
Not surprisingly, Finkelstein has become
the house favorite of neo-fascists in America,
Europe and the Middle East; the dream-Jew
of the post-Holocaust anti-Semites. David
Duke — the white supremacist and former
Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klax Klan — en
dorses him warmly on his Web site
(www.davidduke.com). German neo-Nazi
queen. Ingrid Rimland, has intimated that
Finkelstein's writing makes her feel "like a
kid in a candy store." And Finkelstein's own
enthusiasm for Osama bin Laden and
Hezbollah have made him a welcome guest
on the radical Shiite militia's official satellite
TV station, Al-Manar.
l inkelstein is an American citizen and
thus at liberty to express his odious views.
Hut tree speech is not at issue here. The real
question is should this academic fraudster be
entertained at Stanford University? Does
Finkelstein's message of hate enhance or di
minish our academic standards and commu
nity? And is it legitimate for CJME, a Stan
ford funded student organization, to offer its
uncritical,enthusiastic endorsement to a man
who defames an entire people and its six mil
lion murdered innocents purely for the pur
pose of making Israel look bad?
