Why Does Everyone take SLAC
so seriously?
Last year. President John Hen
nessy's personal assistant, Jeff
Wachtel, likened the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) to
a "terrorist organization." A couple
months earlier, some administrative
staff person got an anonymous,
threatening but nondescript phone
call and assumed immediately (and
announced publicly) without any
apparent justification that it must
have been SI.AC.
Last quarter. The Stanford Re
view sent a freshman to infiltrate
SLAC, posing all quarter as a gen
uinely interested student. At the end
of the quarter. ITie Review published
an article under a pseudonym, in
which they still had to mix facts with
fabrications to come up with some
thing juicy enough to say about
SLAC's "secret plans." Apparently
determined to get rid of us, last
month the Office of Student Activi
ties told SLAC that if we fail to fol
low the protocols that they lay out
for student groups, not only SLAC,
but labor action as a concept, will
have hist its "privilege" on Stanford
campus — a thoroughly ridiculous
notion. Then on Tuesday, Daily
columnist Darren Franich wrote a
somewhat brilliant, lighthearted
satire of SLAC's recent action
("SLACtivism," Jan. 23). 1 guess he
missed the fact that the skit whose
ridiculousness he was exposing was
itself a lighthearted satire. His satire
was a hit more clever, but that was
never the point.
So for the whole Stanford world
that's fascinated or frightened or
scornful or dismissive of SLAC, lis
ten closely. I'm going to reveal an in
ternal secret: We're not spooky radi
cal terrorists; we're not solemn,
washed-up old socialists imagining
that street theater is going to bring
about the revolution tomorrow
morning; we're not self-righteous
idealists or hippie lifestylists. We're
just some folks. And all we're saying
(in as many silly or frank ways, for as
long as it takes) is this: Stanford says
it has a living wage. Because of a
technicality, a set of loopholes, it ac
tually doesn't. We think that's a
dumb thing to have to make a specta
cle about, but in the past, it's been the
only thing that has worked.
So chill out paranoid administra
tors, guilty conservatives, cynical
satirists — take a stand on the issue
and forget about SLAC. Don't worry
so much or take yourself so seriously.
We'll still be here as long as workers
are getting less than they deserve. II
administrative double-speak makes
you angry or wages that meet the
cost of living make you excited,
great. If not. fine, but there's no need
to get all in a huff about us;you'll just
waste your time and probably end up

making yourself look a little bit fool
ish in the meantime.

The Daily's Jan. 23 article. "I ight
for their lives: Roe v. Wade anniver
sary sees pro-life protesters outnum
ber pro-choicers," both upset and
emboldened me. The article states
that the 34th anniversary of Roe v.
Wade passed with "surprisingly little
celebration but plenty of protest."
Are you really so "surprised" that
the pro-life losers in this epic legal
battle are more urged to action than
the pro-choice winners? Of course
the pro-life community is going to do
everything it can to spread its cause if
it's still fighting. Of course the pro
choice community has already won
its main battle, so there's no need for
uproar.
It seems common sense to me
not strong investigative analysis
that more pro-life protesters showed
up in White Plaza on Jan. 22. And be
cause the focus of the article was the
absence of Stanford's pro-choice
community, not the pro-life protest, I
felt implicated and insulted as a
member of that community.
Pro-choice activists are put in a
tough place on this special da\ in his
tory because many people see cele
brating the right to choose as cele
brating abortion. Celebrating abor
tion makes little sense and is uncom
fortable, so playing down that stigma
and celebrating the right to choose is
sometimes difficult.
On Monday, I recognized the im
portant day in women's rights histo
ry.but felt no need to mobilize Hi is is
my body, this is my entitlement and 1
will not let someone dictate to me
how 1 should "celebrate" that right.

Thanks to John and Mary Felstin
er for the response to Monday's Roe
v. Wade memorial ("Cross symbol
ism inappropriate," Jan. 24). Stanford
Students for Life (SSI I.) did not in
tend any "contempt for pregnant
women;" rather, we mourned for the
dead (the aborted children), the hurt
women, partners, families and our
society — not to mention the many
women who courageously speak
about how they have suffered from
their abortions (http://www.silent
nomoreawareness.org/). We intend
ed to raise awareness while remem
bering the 4b.4 million abortions
with the cemetery of crosses. Instead
of using multiple symbols that would
have distinguished the cross as a re Ii
gious symbol, the uniform use of the

cross was used in a cultural, generic
manner.
ITiese "victims of Roe." as Felstin
er and Felstiner mentioned, have
died due to the culture in our society
marked by the Supreme Court deci
sion of Roe v. Wade, which dehuman
ized the pre-born. Not only does
abortion end the life of a human, but
abortion also "is the ultimate ex

feminist Alice Paul stated. l or those

California fish populations are

The Jan. 22 editorial, "Fishy Busi

it missed the mark on a few occa
sions. Despite assertions to the con
t r ary. fish p<jpulations along the coast
of ( 'alifornia are making a comeback
due to commercial and recreational
fishermen's compliance with existing
fishing regulations. What is most im
portant in selecting seafood options
is the sustainability of the fishing
practices and the source of the prod
uct.
The Fish and Game Commission
(F(jC) is making strides in ocean
conservation, but the significance of
their creating new Marine Protect
ed Areas (MPAs) is misrepresented.
I Jnfortunately, these new MPAs fail
to recognize that existing fishing
regulations do, in fact, have signifi
cant conservation values which do
not need to be duplicated by MPAs.
These values are recognized by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) Fisheries.
Over-fishing is no longer occurring
oil the coast of California, accord
ing to a study release just last spring.
The FGC is failing to consider all
impacts (e.g., pollution, coastal de
velopment, etc.) to the ocean, which
is necessary to allocate new regula
tions where the need actually exists.
Finally, the FGC is again failing to
consider all economic impacts to
fishing enterprises and coastal com
munities. Only by doing these things
is it possible to protect the ocean
without needlessly harming legiti
mate business and recreational ac
tivities benefiting millions of Cali
fornia ns.
What it all boils down to is seeing
past the political rhetoric and mak
ing buying decisions which include
fresh, healthy, sustainable California
seafood rather than importing
seafood from who knows where.

Why Does Everyone take SLAC
so seriously?
Last year. President John Hen
nessy's personal assistant, Jeff
Wachtel, likened the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) to
a "terrorist organization." A couple
months earlier, some administrative
staff person got an anonymous,
threatening but nondescript phone
call and assumed immediately (and
announced publicly) without any
apparent justification that it must
have been SI.AC.
Last quarter. The Stanford Re
view sent a freshman to infiltrate
SLAC, posing all quarter as a gen
uinely interested student. At the end
of the quarter. ITie Review published
an article under a pseudonym, in
which they still had to mix facts with
fabrications to come up with some
thing juicy enough to say about
SLAC's "secret plans." Apparently
determined to get rid of us, last
month the Office of Student Activi
ties told SLAC that if we fail to fol
low the protocols that they lay out
for student groups, not only SLAC,
but labor action as a concept, will
have hist its "privilege" on Stanford
campus — a thoroughly ridiculous
notion. Then on Tuesday, Daily
columnist Darren Franich wrote a
somewhat brilliant, lighthearted
satire of SLAC's recent action
("SLACtivism," Jan. 23). 1 guess he
missed the fact that the skit whose
ridiculousness he was exposing was
itself a lighthearted satire. His satire
was a hit more clever, but that was
never the point.
So for the whole Stanford world
that's fascinated or frightened or
scornful or dismissive of SLAC, lis
ten closely. I'm going to reveal an in
ternal secret: We're not spooky radi
cal terrorists; we're not solemn,
washed-up old socialists imagining
that street theater is going to bring
about the revolution tomorrow
morning; we're not self-righteous
idealists or hippie lifestylists. We're
just some folks. And all we're saying
(in as many silly or frank ways, for as
long as it takes) is this: Stanford says
it has a living wage. Because of a
technicality, a set of loopholes, it ac
tually doesn't. We think that's a
dumb thing to have to make a specta
cle about, but in the past, it's been the
only thing that has worked.
So chill out paranoid administra
tors, guilty conservatives, cynical
satirists — take a stand on the issue
and forget about SLAC. Don't worry
so much or take yourself so seriously.
We'll still be here as long as workers
are getting less than they deserve. II
administrative double-speak makes
you angry or wages that meet the
cost of living make you excited,
great. If not. fine, but there's no need
to get all in a huff about us;you'll just
waste your time and probably end up

making yourself look a little bit fool
ish in the meantime.

Abortion article misleading
The Daily's Jan. 23 article. "I ight
for their lives: Roe v. Wade anniver
sary sees pro-life protesters outnum
ber pro-choicers," both upset and
emboldened me. The article states
that the 34th anniversary of Roe v.
Wade passed with "surprisingly little
celebration but plenty of protest."
Are you really so "surprised" that
the pro-life losers in this epic legal
battle are more urged to action than
the pro-choice winners? Of course
the pro-life community is going to do
everything it can to spread its cause if
it's still fighting. Of course the pro
choice community has already won
its main battle, so there's no need for
uproar.
It seems common sense to me
not strong investigative analysis
that more pro-life protesters showed
up in White Plaza on Jan. 22. And be
cause the focus of the article was the
absence of Stanford's pro-choice
community, not the pro-life protest, I
felt implicated and insulted as a
member of that community.
Pro-choice activists are put in a
tough place on this special da\ in his
tory because many people see cele
brating the right to choose as cele
brating abortion. Celebrating abor
tion makes little sense and is uncom
fortable, so playing down that stigma
and celebrating the right to choose is
sometimes difficult.
On Monday, I recognized the im
portant day in women's rights histo
ry.but felt no need to mobilize Hi is is
my body, this is my entitlement and 1
will not let someone dictate to me
how 1 should "celebrate" that right.

Thanks to John and Mary Felstin
er for the response to Monday's Roe
v. Wade memorial ("Cross symbol
ism inappropriate," Jan. 24). Stanford
Students for Life (SSI I.) did not in
tend any "contempt for pregnant
women;" rather, we mourned for the
dead (the aborted children), the hurt
women, partners, families and our
society — not to mention the many
women who courageously speak
about how they have suffered from
their abortions (http://www.silent
nomoreawareness.org/). We intend
ed to raise awareness while remem
bering the 4b.4 million abortions
with the cemetery of crosses. Instead
of using multiple symbols that would
have distinguished the cross as a re Ii
gious symbol, the uniform use of the

cross was used in a cultural, generic
manner.
ITiese "victims of Roe." as Felstin
er and Felstiner mentioned, have
died due to the culture in our society
marked by the Supreme Court deci
sion of Roe v. Wade, which dehuman
ized the pre-born. Not only does
abortion end the life of a human, but
abortion also "is the ultimate ex
ploitation of women," as the early
feminist Alice Paul stated. l or those
women who are hurting, SSFL pro

aforementioned organizations. Pro

California fish populations are
rebounding
The Jan. 22 editorial, "Fishy Busi
ness." made a lot of good points, but
it missed the mark on a few occa
sions. Despite assertions to the con
t r ary. fish p<jpulations along the coast
of ( 'alifornia are making a comeback
due to commercial and recreational
fishermen's compliance with existing
fishing regulations. What is most im
portant in selecting seafood options
is the sustainability of the fishing
practices and the source of the prod
uct.
The Fish and Game Commission
(F(jC) is making strides in ocean
conservation, but the significance of
their creating new Marine Protect
ed Areas (MPAs) is misrepresented.
I Jnfortunately, these new MPAs fail
to recognize that existing fishing
regulations do, in fact, have signifi
cant conservation values which do
not need to be duplicated by MPAs.
These values are recognized by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) Fisheries.
Over-fishing is no longer occurring
oil the coast of California, accord
ing to a study release just last spring.
The FGC is failing to consider all
impacts (e.g., pollution, coastal de
velopment, etc.) to the ocean, which
is necessary to allocate new regula
tions where the need actually exists.
Finally, the FGC is again failing to
consider all economic impacts to
fishing enterprises and coastal com
munities. Only by doing these things
is it possible to protect the ocean
without needlessly harming legiti
mate business and recreational ac
tivities benefiting millions of Cali
fornia ns.
What it all boils down to is seeing
past the political rhetoric and mak
ing buying decisions which include
fresh, healthy, sustainable California
seafood rather than importing
