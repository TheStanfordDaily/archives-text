## Google project to digitize books grows Stanford's Green Library is the leading partner in joint venture 
### LAURA CARWILE 
Mired in controversy, the Google Book Search
Project has recently added the University of Texas to
its list ot partners that include the major libraries of
Stanford. 1 larvard,Oxford and the New York Public
I.ibrur\ m a large-scale effort to digitize millions of
books.
The project recently drew fire from the Associa
tion ot American Publishers as well as the Author's
Guild, which sued Google for threatening to take
awa\ revenue from book publishers, but the project's
goal is not to render printed books obsolete.
Andrew Herkovic, director of communications
and development for Stanford Libraries,clarified the
boundaries of the project.
"The project's focus is on books that are out of
print and no longer generating any sort of revenue
tor book publishers or the original copyright hold
ers." he said. "The project has a lot to do with index
ing. and very little to do with e-books."
One of the main goals of the project is to enrich
the research community by providing easy digital ac
cess to archaic and hard-to-read texts. By creating a
platform that will bridge the current gap between re
searchers and books, the participating universities
and Google hope to heighten, not diminish, the im
portance of literature.
"We actually believe that this project will increase
revenue for book publishers," Herkovic said. "Hie
project is not intended to allow tree downloads ot a
best-selling novel or to take away from someone
else's income."
The project idea was initially developed in 2(H) 1 by
1 lerkovic. Stanford librarian and director of academ
ic information resources Mike Keller and Google co
founder, president and Stanford alumnus Larry Page.
"This project marks a significant contribution to
ward our vision of a digitized library in order to pro
vide scholars at Stanford — and beyond — with un
precedented access to scholarly information,"
Herkovic said.
"Having digitized books, we can build better ac
cess to what we have," he added. "The power of ac
cess is vastly important. We can also create opportu
nities to conceive of new ways of organizing informa
tion. based on complete analyses and data mining of
large volumes of text."
Herkovic said that teaming up with Google was
an imperative step to realize this vision.
"It's an expensive undertaking," Herkovic said.
"Google is better able than we are to handle operat
ing costs. In fact, Google is carrying most of the cost
of the operation."
It is this cooperation that has allowed the project
to continue growing. Since its initiation more than
five years ago. numerous other partners — including
the University of California, University of Virginia
and the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison, along with
the National Library of Catalonia and University
Complutense of Madrid — have expressed interest
to join the venture.
