### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The sign taped to the door is still a
makeshift one. and the Web site is
under construction. But new Vice
Provost of Graduate Education
(VPGE) Patricia Gumport, the first
ever to hold the newly created office,
has already begun taking the baby
steps of her tenure in Building 310.
In an interview with The Daily.
Gumport discussed her approach to
the new position.emphasizing collab

oration with other parts of the Uni
versity and caution before making
any big changes.
Professing that she is "bringing
faculty sensibility to this role."
Gumport is giving priority to solid re
search before implementing any
changes. She currently has one aide
looking up the University's past
statements on graduate education,

"Everything we will be doing is
going to be small and experimental so
we can find out what works." she said,
adding that while changes may be
needed, she also wants to keep an eye
toward what "continues to make
Stanford excellent."

Since it is a new office, it is still un
clear where the VPGE will fit in
among other parts of the University
administration, including the Gradu

for Student Affairs.
"We need to he clear that this of

isting services for graduate students,"
(iumport said."We need to figure out
what's primarily in their purview, and
what's in our purview and where
there's overlap, so that we can work
together."
But more importantly, the
VPUH's involvement with student is
sues. like health care and transporta
tion, has yet to be determined.
"She could eventually [be in
volved with student issues], but right

now her focus is on graduate educa
tion. said Graduate Student Council
(GS(') co-chair Jenny Allen. Allen
and other top GSC members met
with Gumport last week to discuss
possible collaboration, including ar
