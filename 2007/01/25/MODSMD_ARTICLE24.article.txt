## New incoming VPGE tests waters Gumport focuses on research before change 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The sign taped to the door is still a
makeshift one. and the Web site is
under construction. But new Vice
Provost of Graduate Education
(VPGE) Patricia Gumport, the first
ever to hold the newly created office,
has already begun taking the baby
steps of her tenure in Building 310.
In an interview with The Daily.
Gumport discussed her approach to
the new position.emphasizing collab

oration with other parts of the Uni
versity and caution before making
any big changes.
Professing that she is "bringing
faculty sensibility to this role."
Gumport is giving priority to solid re
search before implementing any
changes. She currently has one aide
looking up the University's past
statements on graduate education,
and another studying the success in
graduate education at Stanford's
peer institutions.
"Everything we will be doing is
going to be small and experimental so
we can find out what works." she said,
adding that while changes may be
needed, she also wants to keep an eye
toward what "continues to make
Stanford excellent."

Since it is a new office, it is still un
clear where the VPGE will fit in
among other parts of the University
administration, including the Gradu
ate Life Office and the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs.
"We need to he clear that this of
fice was not meant to supplant the ex
isting services for graduate students,"
(iumport said."We need to figure out
what's primarily in their purview, and
what's in our purview and where
there's overlap, so that we can work
together."
But more importantly, the
VPUH's involvement with student is
sues. like health care and transporta
tion, has yet to be determined.
"She could eventually [be in
volved with student issues], but right

now her focus is on graduate educa
tion. said Graduate Student Council
(GS(') co-chair Jenny Allen. Allen
and other top GSC members met
with Gumport last week to discuss
possible collaboration, including ar


PATRICIA GUMPORT
ranging regular monthly meetings.
However, there is one issue that
Gumport has already begun giving
special attention to — diversity. She
plans to have a Diversity Steering
Committee composed of graduate
students and diversity officers up and
running by next month.The commit
tee's job will be to produce "an
agreed upon set of priorities in the
arena of diversity." from which
(iumport says the University can de
termine which areas — like recruit
ment and retention — deserve the
most attention.
In its meeting last night, the GSC
discussed who will serve on the com
mittee and decided to hold an applica
tion process open to all graduate stu
dents. 1 lowever. some GSC members
expressed concern that the commit
tee and the V PC i Li will not be promot
ing greater international diversity.
"It only focuses on Americans
and not on international students."
said CiSC member and business stu
dent Maxim Afanasyev, an interna
tional student on the council.
Iwo weeks ago. the ASSU and
CiSC passed a joint resolution calling
on the University to improve diversi

ty among faculty and graduate stu
dents. including developing a five
year plan and coordinating with peer
institutions. While (iumport said she
had heard of the resolution, she ad
mitted she has not had the chance to
read it herself, nor does she know of
any potential responses by the Uni
versity. But.she added, the resolution
did show that "the timing is right" for
the Diversity Steering ( ommittee.
Gumport has been involved with
the graduate community at Stanford
for decades, first as a graduate stu
dent and then as a faculty member at
the School of Education. And though
she shared experiences many stu
dents can still relate to working
the breakfast shift at I lobee's, mak
ing sandwiches at the Law School
cafe and pulling her fair share of all
nighters — some things have
changed.
"We actually went to the library,
and we would study in there," she
said, laughing, before adding that the
important things are still similar.
"Many of the ideals that inspired our
work — critical thinking and critical
inquiry — are still the same."
The Faculty Senate created the of
fice of the VPGE last year on the rec
ommendation of the Commission on
Graduate Education, (iumport offi
cially took office on Jan. 2. relieving
interim VPGI Arthur Bienenstock
from the position.
