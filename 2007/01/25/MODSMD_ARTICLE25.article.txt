## Law curriculums lack real world exposure 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Carnegie Foundation for
the Advancement of Teaching re
leased a report last week titled
Educating Lawyers: Preparation
for the Profession of Law that
criticized current law school cur
riculums as inadequate in prepar
ing future lawyers for the real
world.
An analysis of 16 U.S. and
Canadian law schools — Stan
ford Law School (SLS) was not
included — found that most law
students graduate with a solid un
derstanding of legal analytics, but
without practical skills to work
with clients or handle ethical
dilemmas. The report encourages
law schools to incorporate the lat
ter two components into existing
programs.
SLS Dean Larry Kramer be
lieves that the ideas reflected in
the Carnegie Report are not "rad
ically new," but do support ideas
that SLS has been developing
over the past several years.
"The Report is an extremely
useful shot in the arm and it lends
credibility to the need to adapt
legal training to the needs of stu
dents today," Kramer said.

La it November, SLS an
nounced significant additions to
its program that take a step for
ward in this direction. Second and
third year J.D. students are now
provided with clinical and class
room opportunities to represent
clients and litigate cases.
Also, new clinics and programs
will be created for collaboration
between law students and gradu
ate students from other disci
plines, in an effort to imitate how
real world litigations will entail
interactions with field experts.
For example, law students and
natural sciences students will join
forces to prepare witness testimo
ny for a simulated patent-in
fringement case.
"SLS is moving in the right di
rection by providing more oppor
tunities for clinical work and
practical courses," said Law Asso
ciation Co-President Emily
Zachar. a second year law stu
dent. "The possibility of a clinical
quarter program is an exciting
idea in this vein. Since SLS has a
traditionally strong bar passage
rate, we can perhaps be more in
novative and creative in expand
ing curricular offerings that em
phasize'acting like a lawyer' to com
plement the many parts of the cur
riculum designed to emphasize
'thinking like a lawyer.'"
However. Kramer also stated
that the Carnegie Report findings
are incomplete because boosting
hands-on experience is far from a
one-shot solution.
"More practical and ethical train
ing is part of what we need, but so
too is a broader intellectual training
to reflect the new demands on
lawyers to help solve clients' prob
lems and training to work with peo
ple from other disciplines and with
different sorts of training." Kramer
said. "The work lawyers do — the
law — is no longer isolated from
other dimensions of the problems
we are called upon to address."
