## Peyton Manning's true test 
### 
It s amazing, really, how much is
sometimes riding on one game. 1
Jon t just mean records or success
m a given season either. Because
sometimes there's more. Sometimes
there s pride, confidence and reputa
tion at stake. It's a schmaltzy,tired re
train by now. but believe it or not.
sometimes teams and players are
fighting for respect.
Unit's what Peyton Manning was
doing Sunday.
The struggle was so epic, I feel
sorry for any sports fan who missed it.
It was on the level of Texas-USC,
Boise State-Oklahoma or the 2001
Patriots- Rams Super Bowl show
down. But more than merely a great
matchup between two NFL heavy
weights, this was a grudge match.
The history of the teams heading
into the game has been much dis
cussed: the consummate winner in
Tom Brady against the guy who just
couldn't get it done when it counted
most in Manning. Hie genius of Bill
Belichick against the audibles of Pey
ton. The Colts, who always seemed to
be waiting for the other shoe to drop,
against the supremely confident Pa
triots. New England believed in its
own magical aura, especially when
playing the Colts.
And the amazing non-underdog
Colts pulled off the non-upset. When
you look at the matchups, how did
anyone expect the Patriots to win that
game, a game they were lucky to play
given the contest of a week before
against the Chargers? But the well
deserved reputations of both teams as
playoff gods and chokers made the
Patriots the favorites in most people's
minds, never mind what Vegas said.
You get the feeling that some
where. Peyton must be singing along
to Dashboard Confessional's "Vindi
cated."
Suddenly the pall has been lifted
from in front of so many eyes, and we
can see Peyton for what he truly is: the
iconic quarterback of our generation.
Iliis was his John Elway moment, his
Steve Young imitation. He's no longer
the statistically greatest choke artist,
he's just great. And from here on in,
because both the public and his team
believes that he can. in fact, lead when
it counts the most, things should only
get easier. Right?
And there's the trap that Manning
and the Colts have to avoid like the
plague for the next week and a half.
Peyton overcoming Tom Brady
was great, and if he goes on to win
Super Bowl XLI, last Sunday's game
will forever be remembered as the
seminal moment of his career — the
day he truly came into his own. no
matter what happens from here on.
But if he made it this far. past Brady
and Bill's defensive genius, only to be
felled by the less than incomparable
talents of Rex Grossman, then last
weekend's win will be remembered as
nothing more than any other memo
rable game.
The analogy that has been used
over and over to describe Manning's
victory is the 2004 ALCS, when the
Red Sox finally overcame their Yan
kee rivals, and in many ways it's a
valid one. The Yankees held a com
manding 3-0 series lead over the Sox
at one point, just as the Patriots held a
commanding lead at halftime over the
Colts. New England and New York
also held similar psychological edges
over their opponents going into their
playoff competitions.
Staying with that analogy, what
would people be saying about the
Curse of the Bambino now if the Car
dinals had beaten Boston in 2004 in
stead of being swept in the World Se
ries? The win over the Yankees would
have eliminated one set of the
demons Boston had carried with it for
so many years, but another would still
hang ominously over the heads of
every Red Sox fan and player.
And that's what will happen to
Peyton if he can't follow through with
a win over Lovie Smith's Bears on
Feb. 4. That's why the next game is
more important than the last. Because
sure, we know that Peyton can beat
Belichick and the Patriots, but if he
loses in Miami, he still hasn't won
THE big one.
Sometimes one game isn't enough
to turn a reputation and a career
around. Sometimes it takes two.
