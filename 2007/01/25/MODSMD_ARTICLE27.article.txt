NuitS: No. 1 Stanford will put its 86-match winning
streak on the line later this week, hosting UC Davis
and No. 21 Fresno State at the Taube Tennis Center
to kick off the 2007 dual match season.

Stanford women's tennis begins this year's
national title defense with two opening match
es against UC-Davis and Fresno State today
and tomorrow. The matches will kick off the
dual match team season for the Cardinal, who
come into the season tentatively ranked as the
No. 1 team in the nation.
Although the matches serve as a slight
warm-up to the season, Stanford is still wary of
its first opponents. Head coach Lele Forood
said Stanford does not know much about UC-
Davis expect that they will be a solid team. She
did go on to talk about the team's Friday op
ponent. No. 21 Fresno State.

"Fresno State is
a going to be a more
challenging situa
tion," she said.
"They were in the
round of 16 [of the
NCAA Champi
onships] last year as
a team, and I think
they're even better
than they were last
year. They're a top
team, so that'll be a
very good test for
us on Friday."
In terms of the
individual match
ups, the Cardinal
expect to see stiff
competition from
Fresno State soph

Gloria. Gloria has already faced the Cardinal
in some of the fall season tournaments.
"She's a very solid player," said Forood of
Fresno's top player. "You have to beat her; she
doesn't beat herself."
Freshman Lindsey Burdette also chimed in
about the Fresno state opponent.
"She's the one that 1 lost to in regionals,"
Burdette said. "She's a very good player and
did well at tour events. I had a match point
against her at regionals but I lost. Each of the
teams has a couple good players so we're def
initely going to have to be on our toes."
ITiere's a little more on the line, aside from
winning the year's opening games, when the
Cardinal play host at the Taube Tennis Center.
The team currently has a home winning streak
of close to 200 games, so there is always sus
pense in each home match, no matter the op
ponent. Stanford also has an overall match win
streak of 86 — a number which dates back to
the 2003 National Championship final against
Florida.
A testament to the Cardinal's depth.
Forood has yet to determine her lineup of six
singles players. Hie team has been playing

intra-squad matches to determine the lineup
but nothing has been set in stone.
Forood said that the situation would be
"fluid" for a bit longer. She expects the current
scenario to last through February until the
lineup is finalized.
Stanford's two opening matches will also
serve as preparation for the National Team In
doors, which take place next week in Madison,
Wis. The National Indoors will be the only
team tournament of the regular season for the

Cardinal, and it will have a strong bearing on
the teams' ranking in the national pools.
Stanford is currently ranked No. 1. but that
was largely established by the results of last
season. The National Indoors will play a large
role in determining the team's future ranking
as it plows into the substance of the regular
season schedule.
"We're definitely a top-five team in the
country," Burdette said. "It's just a question of
whether we're one or two. Even though we

lost two unbelievable players last year, we
have all the ability we need to be number one.
There are only eight of us this year.though. It's
going to be a lot tougher."
Regardless of the team's ranking, the Car
dinal are looking forward to starting off the
2007 dual season strongly. Stanford's two up
coming matches will go a long way in setting
the tone for the rest of the season.

Today's and tomorrow's matches are both
scheduled for 1:30 p.m.
