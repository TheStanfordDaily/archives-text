conversations between Reggie Bush or
members of his family and an investor in a
failed sports marketing agency could con

Southern California, Yahoo.com reported
Wednesday.
A federal investigation into extortion
claims by Bush and his family revealed the
existence of the taped conversations, ac
cording to the Yahoo.com report.
The U.S. District Attorney's office in San
Diego has issued grand jury subpoenas to
multiple witnesses in the probe, Yahoo.com
reported. According to a copy of a subpoe
na obtained by Yahoo, at least one of the
witnesses was asked to hand over "any
recordings in your possession of conversa
tions between Lloyd Lake and Reggie
Bush. Denise Griffin, or LaMar Griffin."
Lloyd Lake, who founded a sports mar
keting agency in hopes of landing Bush as
its first client, is the subject of a grand jury
probe into the extortion claims. Denise
Griffin is Bush's mother.and LaMar Griffin
is Bush's stepfather.
Yahoo.com, citing unidentified sources,
reported LaMar Griffin spoke with federal
investigators in the spring of 2006 and ac
knowledged the existence of the tapes.

When asked in the past about the allega
tions of receiving inappropriate extra bene
fits, Bush has insisted that he and his family
did nothing wrong.
Multiple sources told Yahoo.com that
Lake made the tapes in late 2005 to protect
his financial investment if Bush backed out
of a deal to sign with New lira Sports A: I n
tertainment. founded by Lake and San
Diego businessman Michael Michaels. In
January 2005. Bush signed with agent Joel
Segal and marketing agent Mike Ornstein.
On Jan. 12,2007, Lake's mother, Barbara
Gunner, testified before a grand jury, ac
cording to the Yahoo.com report, that she
had heard portions of tapes made by her
son, in which LaMar Griffin states Bush in
tended to repay New Era Sports "their
money." as well as for a car purchased for
him.
"I respectfully decline to comment on
the media frenzy regarding Reggie Bush,
his family and his college career," David
Cornwell, Bush's attorney, told Yahoo on
Wednesday.
Lake told Yahoo in August 2006 that he
contributed a portion of the cash and gifts
allegedly given to Bush and his family as
part of an agreement to represent the 2005
I leisman Trophy winner when he signed an
NFL contract. In September.Yahoo.com re
ported Ornstein also supplied Bush and his
family with gifts while he was still at IJSC.
