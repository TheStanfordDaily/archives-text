# Women aim for 15 straight
## No. 9 Stanford needs to step up for ASU 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
After 14 straight wins, the No. 9
women's basketball team faces a
large threat to its streak this week
end. Tonight, the Cardinal face the
Pacific-10 Conference's second-to
last team in Arizona, but will hold a
rematch against Stanford's top Pac
-10 rival. No. 10 Arizona State, on
Saturday.
Arizona (7-14.1-8) should prove
little challenge for Stanford (16-3,9-
0 Pac-10). The Cardinal blew out
Arizona 86-58 at the end of Decem
ber. I lowever, the same was said for
the Pac-10's third-to-last squad.
Oregon State, who rallied to an 1 1-
point lead over the Cardinal at half
time last Saturday. Stanford came
back in full force to score double the
points it had in the first half and re
gain the lead less than six minutes
into the half.
ITie signs pointed to what head

coach Tara VanDerveer called a
"lackadaisical" Cardinal.
"Our whole team conditioning
isn't where it should be," Van-
Derveer said. "It's going to be tough
going [with] Arizona and Arizona
State."
VanDerveer added that the
team would have to reassess its
focus in practice, as well as amp up
its early efforts.
Ready to pounce on the Cardi
nal — should they not come out
strong — are the Wildcats' Joy
Hollingsworth (16.5 points per
game,6.o rebounds per game). Ash
ley Whisonant (11.5 points per
game) and Amina Njonku (9.7
points per game). Overall, however,
Arizona is 0-4 against top-25 com
petition and is shooting just 39.9
percent from the field.
Its instate rival, on the other
hand, is the Cardinal's top Pac-10

Junior guard Cissy Pierce looks over the head of an
Oregon defender last week. That was Stanford 13th
consecutive win; the team now looks to make it 15
straight. Head coach Tara VanDerveer, however, is
looking for a little bit more from the team.
