# Women aim for 15 straight
## No. 9 Stanford needs to step up for ASU 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
After 14 straight wins, the No. 9
women's basketball team faces a
large threat to its streak this week
end. Tonight, the Cardinal face the
Pacific-10 Conference's second-to
last team in Arizona, but will hold a
rematch against Stanford's top Pac
-10 rival. No. 10 Arizona State, on
Saturday.
Arizona (7-14.1-8) should prove
little challenge for Stanford (16-3,9-
0 Pac-10). The Cardinal blew out
Arizona 86-58 at the end of Decem
ber. I lowever, the same was said for
the Pac-10's third-to-last squad.
Oregon State, who rallied to an 1 1-
point lead over the Cardinal at half
time last Saturday. Stanford came
back in full force to score double the
points it had in the first half and re
gain the lead less than six minutes
into the half.
ITie signs pointed to what head

coach Tara VanDerveer called a
"lackadaisical" Cardinal.
"Our whole team conditioning
isn't where it should be," Van-
Derveer said. "It's going to be tough
going [with] Arizona and Arizona
State."
VanDerveer added that the
team would have to reassess its
focus in practice, as well as amp up
its early efforts.

strong — are the Wildcats' Joy

game,6.o rebounds per game). Ash

Its instate rival, on the other
hand, is the Cardinal's top Pac-10

ANDREW DAVIS/The Stanford Daily
Junior guard Cissy Pierce looks over the head of an
Oregon defender last week. That was Stanford 13th
consecutive win; the team now looks to make it 15
straight. Head coach Tara VanDerveer, however, is
looking for a little bit more from the team.
rival. Arizona State (18-2.8-1) is riding a six-game
winning streak as it meets No. 20 California
tonight. The Sun Devils' only loss in the Pac-10
this season was to Stanford on Dec. 30, when the
Cardinal came back from a seven-point deficit at
halftime to regain the lead on a 17-3 run. Arizona
State was on Stanford's heels until the end and
came close to tying the game 74-74 on a three he
fore losing 77-71.
Much of the Cardinal's game-winning surge
came from junior guard Candice Wiggins, who
had 19 of her 21 total points in the second half. Hut
having nursed a sprained ankle in recent weeks.
Wiggins (15.3 points per game) has been on the
court for less time than usual.
"I would not say she's 100 percent, but she's
ready to practice and play," said assistant coach
Amy Tucker.
VanDervecr agreed that Wiggins is not where
the team wants her to be and made "uncharacter
istic" turnovers and missed easy shots against the
Oregon schools. I lowever, Stanford will still look
toward Wiggins for leadership.
"We have to put her in great situations, either
to score or with the ball on the floor.'"Fuckersaid.
"We have to bring her off the screens — single

screens, double screens — and get her the ball in
transition."
ITie Cardinal will need more than just Wiggins,
however. Senior center Brooke Smith continues
to be a Stanford staple with 13.7 points per game
and 7.3 rebounds per game. Freshman forward
Jayne Appel (12.1 points per game) has also
stepped up against the Cardinal's toughest com
petition with a breakthrough 23 points against
then-No. 4 Tennessee.
Meanwhile, the Sun Devils boast four players
averaging nearly 50 percent in field goals: senior
forward Emily Westerberg (15.3 points per
game), senior forward Aubree Johnson (11.0
points per game) and sophomore guards Danielle
Orsillo (10.9 points per game) and Briann Janu
ary (10.3 points per game).
Arizona State also leads the Pac-10 in assists
per game (20.1 per game), field goal percentage
(49.3 percent average), scoring offense (79.0
points per game), turnover margin (+5.6) and
steals (10.55 per game).
"There are some things you have to do when
you play at Arizona State," Tucker said. "You
have to take care of the ball and not give them the
ball or any easy baskets."
The Sun Devils will be looking to flip the rank
ing order with Stanford this weekend, but the
Cardinal will look to set a dominant tone from the
start, despite the team's recent sloppiness and
lesser efforts.
"We have some lessons to learn,"Tucker said.
