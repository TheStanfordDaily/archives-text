# Hones' Surprise Season
## "It's been a very cool experience I wasn't expecting at all". JJ HONES, freshman guard 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When asked how it felt to join
the Stanford women's basketball
team and immediately play an inte
gral part in the No. 9 Cardinal's suc
cess, freshman JJ I lones could only
find a few words and a quick smile.
"It was definitely a surprise," the
5-foot-10 guard said.
But don't let her modesty fool
you. Hones' achievements on the
court leave little room for surprise.
Leading the team with 4.2 assists
per game — good enough to ele
vate her assist-turnover ratio to sec
ond in the Pacific-10 Conference at
2.96 — Hones has brought a sharp
ability to distribute to Stanford's
backcourt. But the unselfish roots
of the Oregon native were estab
lished long before her arrival to the
Farm.

"As a point guard, I don't think
individual awards really matter
much to me." Hones said. "But
being able to lead my [high school]
team to [two consecutive] state
championships with the other great
players that we had was definitely
my most memorable and rewarding
accomplishment."
Hones provides the Stanford of
fense with more than steady sup
port. In the Cardinal's trip to Wash
ington. she posted 10 points and
three assists. She was one of four
Stanford players to hit double digits
in scoring. Two days later against
Washington State, she returned to
lead the team with 17 points and
four assists.
She attributes this shift in better
personal play to a greater level of
confidence in her team role as the
season progressed.
"At the beginning of the year. I was
more focused on making the right pass
and making sure the offense was set
up," Hones recalled. "Not that I'm tak
ing away from that, but now I'm being
more aggressive and actually attacking
the basket and trying to do more for the
team."
Part of that confidence comes in
practice, where the Stanford players
challenge each other with a high level
of competition. Hones recognizes that
much of her development this season is
a result of playing side by side with 2006
Pac-10 Player of the Year, junior guard
Candice Wiggins.
"I've learned to be more aggressive
because Candice is such a great player,"
Hones said. "It's a really great experi
ence to be able to watch her play every
day in practice. I just try to see what she
does and put it into my game."
Hones similarly takes note of the
wisdom of head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
"A lot of the time. I [take away] more
from the negative things [VanDerveer]
says." Hones said. "She'll say, It's not
high school anymore," or [tell me that] I
can't he making stupid passes. When
someone says something negative to
you,you let it brush off. If it's a learning
tip. though,you just take it for what it is
and don't get too upset about it. You re
alize that they're just trying to help you;
they're not asking you to do anything
you can't do."
Apparently. VanDerveer hasn't
asked too much. Although Hones had
n't anticipated that she would average
nearly 25 minutes per game so early in
her Stanford career, she has taken it in
stride, appreciating every second out on
the floor.
"1 didn't think I'd be able to come in
and make contributions because they
had a great point guard in [sophomore
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude], and un
fortunately she tore her ACL in the off
season." Hones said"! knew Mel [fresh
man guard Melanie Murphy] or I had to
step up. and 1 think we've both done a
really good job. It's been a very cool ex
perience that I wasn't expecting at all."
But. now that she's here. Hones and
the rest of the team are focused on the
cohesiveness. shared offensive respon
sibilities and defensive dominance that
have established the Cardinal atop the
Pac-10 and as a national power.
As for the future. Hones is ready to
reaffirm her team mentality by achiev
ing the squad's collective goal.
"A national championship," she said.
