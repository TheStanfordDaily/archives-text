# Hill gets spotlight in card's success
## "I want to help us on every defensive possesion. 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
This season was supposed to be a transi
tion for the Stanford men's basketball team.
Chris Hernandez, Matt Haryasz and Dan
Grunfeld all gone. Lawrence Hill, Antho
ny Goods. Mitch Johnson and the Lopez
twins â€” all underclassmen.
Hut the Cardinal, largely through the ef
forts of sophomore Hill and his young gun
teammates, have still found a way to stay
competitive in the toughest conference in
the country.
"We don't listen to all the hype." Hill said.
We're st;i\ ing humble and making sure that
we make this season what we can make it,
game by game."
It is impossible to give one player credit
for the Cardinal's 12-5 start. Sophomore
guard Anthony Goods has performed be
vond expectations, freshmen Brook and

Robin Lopez have dominated under the
basket and senior forward Fred Washington
has elevated his game to a new level But no
single player has been the face of Stanford's
surprising success more than I iill.
Not only is I lill first on the team in scor
ing with 15.3 points per game and second in
rebounding with 6.3 boards per contest, but
he has also played a major role in some of
the Cardinal's closest and most memorable
victories.
In a 69-67 victory over Fresno State on
Dec. 19.1 lill hit a pair of free throws with 14
seconds left to give the Cardinal the win. A
little more than two weeks later, Hill's
floater in the lane against Virginia with nine
tenths of a second left in the game propelled
Stanford to a 76-75 victory. And most re
cently, the sophomore forward had big plays
in the closing seconds of dramatic wins over
