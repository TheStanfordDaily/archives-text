twins â€” all underclassmen.
Hut the Cardinal, largely through the ef
forts of sophomore Hill and his young gun
teammates, have still found a way to stay
competitive in the toughest conference in
the country.
"We don't listen to all the hype." Hill said.
We're st;i\ ing humble and making sure that
we make this season what we can make it,
game by game."
It is impossible to give one player credit
for the Cardinal's 12-5 start. Sophomore
guard Anthony Goods has performed be

Robin Lopez have dominated under the
basket and senior forward Fred Washington

surprising success more than I iill.

SAMMY ABUSRUR/The Stanford Daily
In Stanford's last game, a 67-56 win over OSU, sophomore forward Lawrence Hill scored a career
high 24 points, five three-pointers.
Washington and Washington State.
The list of Hill's late game successes is ex
tensive. But the soft-spoken native of Cilen
dale, Ariz, claims that his final-second oppor
tunities just prove there is work to be done.
"It says a lot that we're able to do some
thing positive late in games," I lill said."Earli
er in the season, we may not have had the
confidence, but now we don't doubt our
selves. But we also know that the reason the
games were close was because of our earlier
breakdowns."
Defensive lapses have plagued Hill
throughout his career at Stanford. A natural
small forward, he was forced to play exclu
sively power forward last season and started
the 2006-07 campaign playing up due to
Brook Lopez's injury. As a result, the 6-foot
-8,205 pound 1 (ill had to learn to body up big
ger opponents.
"Mis problem to this point is that he still
needs to embrace contact and learn to use his
length on smaller, quicker players," head
coach Trent Johnson said of Hill's defensive
struggles."He has a tendency to get caught on
screens. I le needs to learn to embrace that
contact and run through screens and use his
size. Now, it is also an adjustment for him to
defend on the perimeter and small guys off
the dribble."
But Hill is taking pride in his defensive
progress. He said he hopes his defensive ef
fort will soon overshadow his offensive hero
ics.
"No matter what, 1 still want to be a good
team player that kept us into the game until

the end," 11 ill said. "I want to help us on every
defensive possession. I would he much happi
er to take a charge to win a game or box a
body or steal a ball. In a game a team hits
around 30 shots and most people see that last
one as the most important. On our team we
would see the defensive breakdowns that
made the game so close."
Hill admits that his game is still a work in
progress. In his freshman campaign he played
in all 30 games but averaged just over 15 min
utes a game. Now as a full time starter, he is
getting plenty of experience to help improve
his overall skills.
"The biggest thing for my improvement
has been the experience," Hill said."l 've been
playing a lot this year, on top of the time I got
last season. It would be really bad if I didn't
improve myself since last year."
"I try to be a lot like Fred," I lill continued.
"I want to do everything, whether it is outside
shooting, midrange. going to the basket,
guarding a big man or guarding a guard. I
want to do it all. As long as I can do a couple
of those a game, 1 can help out. If I can do
them all. that would be great."
That do-it-all, always-get-better mindset
has certainly contributed to I lill's overall suc
cess this season. He has taken the team's suc
cess. as well as his own personal accomplish
ments. in stride while still realizing that there
is plenty left to achieve.
"We're happy about how the season has
gone so far, but we understand that we've had
some bad losses," I lill said. "We know have a
lot more work to do."
