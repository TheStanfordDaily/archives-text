# IMPORTANT GAMES TO WATCH
## 
### 
Jan. 31
vs. Gonzaga
No Adam Morrison for the 'Zags, but
still a touogh team. A win against a
good non-conference team would
give Tourney hopes a boost.
Feb. 3
VS. CAL
Maybe not a must win, but pretty
darn close. The home loss to the
Bears set the Cardinal back in the
Pac-10 race. A road win could
make up for that early blemish. Look
for the Lopez twins to find success as
Cal is without Devon Hardin.
