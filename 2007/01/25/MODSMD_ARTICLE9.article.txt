## STUDENT GROUPS Sparking debate, SCAI launches divestment push Movement lacks "moral consensus" of previous campaigns, critics say 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Deeming it the "most moral, effective and nonvio
lent approach" to bringing peace to the Middle East,
Students Confronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAI) last
night launched its campaign calling on the University to
selectively divest from companies with ties to Israel.
The campaign, which comes on the heels of success
ful efforts in 2005 that prompted Stanford to sever rela
tions with corporations connected to Sudanese govern
ment. drew the ire of a number of student and faculty
members concerned with the use of "apartheid" in the
group's name and its potential to further polarize stu
dent dialogue.
Speaking in front of a crowd of about 150 students,
faculty and community members in Tressider Oak West,
senior and SCAI President Omar Shakir, a senior, out
lined the group's case for divestment and offered a brief
history of Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Shakir presented a five-part divestment approach in
which he called for the University Board of Trustees to
divest from companies that: support Israel's military, aid
the construction or maintenance of the West Bank "sep
aration fence," operate on occupied land, assist in the
demolition of homes or engage in institutional discrimi
nation. He defended the use of the word "apartheid," ar
guing that while the Israeli and South African regimes
are different on the surface, their result is the same.
"No one here is saying what is going on is genocide."
he said."But the systemic discrimination and institution
al racism is very clear."
SCAI's campaign has put campus Jewish student
groups on the defensive, and has fostered a "divisive at
mosphere," said Stanford Israel Alliance Co-President
Mishan Araujo, a junior.
"There's a temptation to use inflammatory rhetoric
to get attention, but it comprises a gross misrepresenta
tion and places all the blame on Israel," Aroujosaid."We
recognize that Israel has faults, but both sides need to
own up to their mistakes."
Associate Director for Honors Writing Hilton Oben
zinger. who participated on the panel and agrees with
SCAl'sstance despite the fact that he is Jewish.admitted
as much.
"Apartheid is a buzzword and is very upsetting for
those who support Israel," he said in his closing remarks.
"But I think we need to face it. We need to face the hard
realities."
The campus debate represents a microcosm of delib
erations both nationally and internationally over divest
ment campaigns and the use of the word "apartheid" in
connection with Israel. Former President Jimmy Carter
unleashed a firestorm of controversy when he published
a book titled "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid" in De
cember.
And previous campus divestment campaigns relat
ed to South Africa in the 1980s and Sudan in 2005 both
enjoyed widespread support that SCAI is unlikely to
find in its fight.
"What separates this from previ
ous divestment efforts is that there is
much less— in fact, no prospect —
in achieving community consensus
toward the goal of divestment," said
Hoover Senior Fellow Larry Dia
mond. "In the case of South Africa, 1
think there was a far. far greater con
sensus on the issues and the moral
imperatives."
While SC 'AI heralds the decisions
of the Presbyterian Church and the
Academic Union of Teachers in the
United Kingdom to divest from Is
rael. petitions and campaigns on the
issue at universities nationwide have
struggled to get off the ground. Di
vestment efforts at several Ivy
League schools and the UC system
made headlines in 2002 but failed to
produce the desired result.
In a 2002 speech. then-Harvard
President Lawrence Summers char
acterized Harvard's divestment
campaign as "anti-Semitic in effect,
if not in intent."
"Where anti-Semitism and views
that are profoundly anti-Israeli have
traditionally been the primary pre
serve of poorly educated right-wing
populists." Summers said, "pro
foundly anti-Israel views are in
creasingly finding support in pro
gressive intellectual communities."

So fur. the University has not
made clear its views regarding di
vestment from Israel, lor its part.the
Office of Student Affairs h;is been
working to "promote discussion that
fosters education, learning and un
derstanding through open and re
spectful dialogue." according to a
statement released by the office yes
terday.
"The original Founding Grant
composed by Jane and I.eland Stan
ford provides for studies and exer
cises directed to the cultivation and
enlargement of the mind."' Dean of
Students Maureen Powers said in
the statement. "It is with this educa
tional goal in mind that we hope to
encourage students to share their
viewpoints in an atmosphere of mu
tual respect and understanding dif
ferences. Without attention to these
basic values meaningful dialogue
and mutual learning are unlikely to
occur."
To that end. Assistant Dean for
Multicultural Education Thom
Massey is working to form a commit
tee of students, faculty and staff to
brainstorm community program
ming on issues relating to the Is
rael/Palestine conflict.
"The committee may choose to
broaden its focus, but the emphasis
on respectful dialogue will be at the
core of this committee's work." he
said in the Office of Student Affairs
statement. "Volunteers should con
tact me immediately (upglobal.Stan

meet for the first time next week."
