## STUDENT GROUPS Sparking debate, SCAI launches divestment push Movement lacks "moral consensus" of previous campaigns, critics say 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Deeming it the "most moral, effective and nonvio
lent approach" to bringing peace to the Middle East,
Students Confronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAI) last
night launched its campaign calling on the University to
selectively divest from companies with ties to Israel.
The campaign, which comes on the heels of success
ful efforts in 2005 that prompted Stanford to sever rela
tions with corporations connected to Sudanese govern
ment. drew the ire of a number of student and faculty
members concerned with the use of "apartheid" in the
group's name and its potential to further polarize stu
dent dialogue.
Speaking in front of a crowd of about 150 students,
faculty and community members in Tressider Oak West,
senior and SCAI President Omar Shakir, a senior, out
lined the group's case for divestment and offered a brief
history of Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Shakir presented a five-part divestment approach in
which he called for the University Board of Trustees to
divest from companies that: support Israel's military, aid
the construction or maintenance of the West Bank "sep
aration fence," operate on occupied land, assist in the
demolition of homes or engage in institutional discrimi
nation. He defended the use of the word "apartheid," ar
guing that while the Israeli and South African regimes
are different on the surface, their result is the same.
"No one here is saying what is going on is genocide."
he said."But the systemic discrimination and institution
al racism is very clear."
SCAI's campaign has put campus Jewish student
groups on the defensive, and has fostered a "divisive at
mosphere," said Stanford Israel Alliance Co-President
Mishan Araujo, a junior.
"There's a temptation to use inflammatory rhetoric
to get attention, but it comprises a gross misrepresenta

recognize that Israel has faults, but both sides need to
own up to their mistakes."

SCAl'sstance despite the fact that he is Jewish.admitted
as much.
"Apartheid is a buzzword and is very upsetting for
those who support Israel," he said in his closing remarks.
"But I think we need to face it. We need to face the hard
realities."
The campus debate represents a microcosm of delib
erations both nationally and internationally over divest
ment campaigns and the use of the word "apartheid" in
connection with Israel. Former President Jimmy Carter
unleashed a firestorm of controversy when he published
a book titled "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid" in De
cember.
And previous campus divestment campaigns relat
ed to South Africa in the 1980s and Sudan in 2005 both
enjoyed widespread support that SCAI is unlikely to
