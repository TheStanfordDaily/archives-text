## Study shows pollution slows winds

"If we clean up the
aerosols, we might
increase rainfall."

Two decades ago, Stanford's Mark Jacohson, asso
ciate professor in civil and environmental engineer
ing, decided to study air pollution "to improve human
health on a large scale." Jacobson's recent study,
"Wind reduction by aerosol particles" was published
Dec. 27,2006, in "Geophysical Research Letters."
"Air pollution problems were quite prevalent in
the 1980s," Jacobson said.
"Science can address them and ameliorate them."
Models are important tools for climate scientists.
Jacobson has personally developed the models he
used for his recent work over the course of his aca
demic career.
"One of the weaknesses of models [in the 1980s]
was aerosols," Jacobson said."lt was an area I thought
I could make some contribution to."
Because climate science is full of complicated feed
backs and convoluted indirect effects, Jacobson's
work on air pollution has often been confused with
the study of greenhouse gases or global warming. But
although Jacobson technically doesn't study global
warming, his models enable climate scientists to un
derstand the effects of aerosols — natural and man
made airborne particles — on climate change.
The recent study, coauthored by the late NASA
scientist Yoram Kaufman, details the effects that the
visible components of smog can have on winds close
to the Earth's surface.
Normally, when the sun's energy hits the ground, a
heat difference between the upper and lower atmos
phere develops. The hot air closer to the surface rises,
creating thermal currents that mix the layers of air.
Hie aerosol particles in smog prevent this process, Ja
cobson's study found.
Aerosol particles that prevent the mixing of the
upper and lower atmosphere can cause the average
speed of surface winds to decrease.
Jacobson's work has many implications for climate

science, including the study of global climate change
caused by greenhouse gases. Aerosols in the atmos
phere decrease surface temperatures, wind speeds ef
fect evaporation rates and increased numbers of
aerosol particles in the atmosphere can cause cloud
water droplets to form more slowly, decreasing rain
fall.
But Jacobson emphasized that it is important to
understand that there is a difference between the ef
fects of air pollution — which is caused by particles —
and global warming, which is caused by greenhouse
gases like carbon dioxide.
"This [study] was already used by climate skeptics
who were saying, 'Well, if winds were slowing down
there won't be more hurricanes,'" Jacobson said.
"That's a completely different mechanism."
Climate change and air pollution have been relat
ed since the 19th century's Industrial Revolution. In
California, Jacobson acknowledged, both pollution
and global warming seem to be functioning to reduce
annual precipitation.
He pointed out that cleaning up pollutants could
help.
"If we clean up the aerosols," Jacobson said, "we
might increase rainfall."
