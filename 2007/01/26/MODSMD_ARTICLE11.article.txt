## Editorial Board Aim High with Public Service 
### 
Stanford students are no strangers to
public service. Whether through reli
gious organizations, volunteer clubs or
honor societies, most of us have performed
community service in the past. For some, it
was simply a stepping stone toward college
admission, but Stanford's general popula
tion continually performs an enormous
amount of tutoring, mentoring, volunteer
ing and fundraising for charitable causes.
While Stanford currently has a powerful
public service community, we wish to en
courage more students to get involved and
those who are already participating to con
sider public service as more than a token ex
tracurricular activity. Volunteering can and
should be about more than simply making
yourself look good.
First of all. volunteering is so prevalent
across majors, interests and financial back
grounds because it really does go beyond
resume padding. To be sure, there is a fair
number of students with eyes on graduate
school and jobs, but extracurriculars like
community service tend to be less impor
tant than academics on these applications.
There is something motivating people be
yond the stature gained by volunteering,
and. if it's not motivating you, you should
consider what is. Simply ask a friend work
ing with one of the plethora of campus
groups trying to help people in settings that
range from local to international. Participa
tion in service activities can be one of the
most rewarding parts of the college envi
ronment and can provide a valuable per
spective for future decisions.
This is also the perfect time in our lives to
have an enormous impact. Many people
continue to volunteer after graduation and
some (a regrettably small number) go to
work in service-related fields. But college

years provide a special window of opportu
nity. Although it is cliche to call college stu
dents young and idealistic, we often are.
And instead of using this as a way to down
play what students imagine they can do,
youth and idealism should be channeled
into energy with enormous potential.
As an "elite" university, we are continu
ally hearing about all of the advantages our
school provides. Hut the same qualities like
extremely competitive admissions and mo
tivated students that draw investment
banking recruiters in hordes give us power
ful leverage for public service. We have the
ability to work with some of the best stu
dents in the country and share ideas, re
sources and manpower.
Additionally, the I laas Center for Public
Service is a resource that is secret to none.
Whether you want to work on campus, in
l ast Palo Alto, or Nepal, the Haas center
can help provide information, advice and
sometimes even funding.The staff draws on
years of experience in community-based
work and has helped launch student groups
inii) intluential international organizations.
No matter what your field of study or per
sonal interest. Haas can provide excellent
information about how to use your skills for
a greater good.
Author James Baldwin wrote, "Not
everything that is faced can be changed, but
nothing can be changed until it is faced." We
are proud to attend a university with stu
dents so committed to tackling tough issues
through public service, but there is always
room for improvement. Think hard about
what you want to take away from Stanford.
A few years down the road you might re
member a great party or a crazy night with
friends, but the memories of the people you
help will likely last much longer.
