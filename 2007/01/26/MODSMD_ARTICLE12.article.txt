# Let the wild rumpus begin
## 
### 
In case you missed the memo (or the
hundreds of emails and flyers), the
Farm's annual hunting season is about
to begin.
Although some overanxious poachers
have spent the past few months learning
to navigate the CDC website, prepping
their resumes and conducting practice in
terviews, next Monday's Career Fair
marks the official opening day of Job
1 lunt 2007 for everyone else.
As the successful survivor of several
harried seasons and the owner of 1.3333
widely-thought-to-be-unmarketable de
grees. 1 have generously decided to share
a few pointers. Before i do so. however, 1
would like to thank my friends at the Offi
cial Online Hunting Safety Course for
Michigan Hunters for providing the "Ten
Commandments of Firearm Safety"
(printed in bold below).
1. Watch that muzzle! Keep it pointed in a
safe direction at all times. It may seem
self-evident, but think before you speak
at the career fair, at an interview, at any
location within five miles of your poten
tial employer. Avoid "like," "hella." pro
fanity and. of course, Stanford acronyms
(the time and energy it takes to explain
them is much better spent talking about
your brilliant problem-solving abilities).
Stick to subjects you know (i.e., yourself)
and don't exaggerate. Professionals can
tell.
2.Treat every firearm with the respect due
a loaded gun. It illicit be, even if you think
it isn't. Don't dismiss the other candi
dates. You might feel better walking
around the goody-covered tables or step
ping into the interview, but you will feel
horrible when one of them gets the job.
Besides, you never know who can hear
you (see #1).
3. Be sure of the target and w hat is in front
of it and beyond it. Know the identifying
features of the game you hunt. Make sure
you have an adequate backstop — don't
shoot at a flat, hard surface or water. As
any practiced stalker will tell you: re
search. research, research. If you're about
to spend a summer, a year or a decade
working somewhere, you better like most
everything about it.
4. Keep your finger outside the trigger
guard until ready to shoot.This is the best
way to prevent an accidental discharge.
Whether you're putting together an appli
cation or considering an offer, don't act
too quickly. Just because you're worried
about spending the summer/year/rest of
your life living with your parents, you
should not take aim until you're good and
ready. Hastily prepared resumes and

cover letters generally reveal themselves
(as when you forget to change the compa
ny's name in the last paragraph of your
copy-and-paste job).
5. Check your barrel and ammunition.
Make sure the barrel mid action are clear
of obstructions, and carry only the proper
ammunition for your firearm. Although
your superstar personality will win you
points at an interview, it is unlikely to
make much of an impression at the career
fair. That means that, even if you've al
ready met your prey face-to-face, your re
sume is the only way to get your foot in the
door (or, to continue the column's extend
ed metaphor, your bullet in the brain).
Obstructions such as spelling, grammar
and parallel structure count, as do current
dating and font size. In terms of bearing
only "proper" ammunition, tailor your re
sume for each job; Goldman Sachs is un
likely to care much about your five sum
mers as a camp counselor, but Reading
Rainbow Nursery School certainly will.
6. Unload firearms when not in use. Leave
actions open; carry firearms in eases and
unloaded to and from the shooting area.
Down time, both at an extended interview
and in your regular life, is important. Do
not talk job-hunt at the dinner table, nor
in the company cafeteria. Unless prompt
ed to do so, do not distribute your resume
during a five-minute coffee break. You
will frustrate your potential employers,
annoy your friends and quite possibly
drive yourself crazy.
7. Point a firearm only at something you
intend to shoot. Avoid all horseplay with a
gun. In our senior year, one of my friends
went through 70 first-round interviews.
I le spent most weekends between January
and May in a hotel or in transit, and only
took his suit off long enough to get it
cleaned. I le currently has one job.
8. Don't run, jump, or climb with a loaded
firearm. Unload a firearm before you
climb a fence or tree, or jump a ditch. If
you carry a resume while exercising — be
cause "you never know" who will be run
ning Campus Drive at 5:00 pm — you
need help. See #6 for further details.

Pearls of wisdom
9. Store firearms and ammunition
separately and safely. Store each in
secured locations beyond the reach
of children and careless adults.
Save your resume in multiple

places — computers crash.
10. Avoid alcoholic beverages be
fore and during shooting. Also
avoid mind- or behavior-altering
medicines or drugs. Enough said.

Although she plans to attend the Ca
reer Fair on Monday afternoon, Lisa
Mendelman will gladly accept all job
offers and resume requests sent to
