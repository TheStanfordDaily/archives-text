# When it all goes wrong

Bobby May is the celebrity chef we love
to hate. I still remember watching him
leap onto his cutting board to perform
the "raise the roof" gesture after defeating
Iron Chef Japanese Masaharu Morimoto.
The camera cut to a stony-faced Morimoto.
"In Japan," he said, "the cutting board is
sacred."
Moments like these make his new show
Throwdown not only watchable, but almost
cathartic. May challenges experts to a
"throwdown" in their particular specialty, be
it gumbo, donuts, or BBQ. And most of the
time,he gets killed.To give him due credit, it's
not easy to go toe-to-toe with guys who have
spent the better part of their lives mastering
a single dish, and he takes the beat-down with
good humor.
The point is that even the culinary mighty
can be brought low. I have experienced a less
er version of this myself. When I invite people
over for dinner, they often expect, because 1
spend a lot of time cooking and write a col
umn about it. that anything I make will be a
masterpiece of flavor and presentation. That
would be nice, wouldn't it'.' In fact, most of
my cooking adventures turn out thoroughly
mediocre.

So this column is about making the best of
it when your cooking does not go according
to plan. In other words, most of the time.

I .Avoid disaster in the first place. Unless you
are exceptionally talented or experienced,
you are unlikely to succeed completely the
first time you try a dish. If you think your love
life or financial future rests on the results of
your cooking, you should probably go with
an old standby.

2.Head it off at the pass. Sometimes you just
know its not going to work out. Say the first
step in making a soup is browning some gar
lic. You neglected the stove and all of a sud
den notice an unpleasant,acrid smell. You've
burned the garlic into a charred, black mass.

At this point there's no saving it. I'm all for
respecting the food, but you don't help any
one by serving something inedible. So far
you're only out a little oil and a few cloves of
garlic. Wipe out the pan and start over.
3.Adjust seasoning. Most chefs recommend
seasoning in layers, meaning
tasting and seasoning at each step of the
cooking process. If the finished product
seems bland, the most common problem is
not enough salt. Salt not only adds its own fla
vor to the dish, it often makes other flavors
seem to pop out. If, on the other hand, the
dish is over-seasoned, it can sometimes be
corrected by adding an appropriate liquid
water, cream, chicken stock, etc.
4.Adjust texture. You can thicken a liquid
with flour,cornstarch and the like. Obviously
adding liquid will make for a thinner texture.
If for some reason the texture really isn't
working, you can always throw everything in
a blender and just whiz it smooth.
s.Order a pizza.
