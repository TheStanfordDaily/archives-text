## Holocaust Denial Does NOT Come to Stanford 
### TALA AL-RAMAHI 
I am going to spare you the fruitless argu
ment of what came first: the chicken or the
egg (or in this case, the Palestinians or the Is
raelis). I have moved past that unproductive
logic, and 1 am more interested in what is
happening now, today and at this very minute
in the occupied Palestinian territories. 1 want
you to know that innocent Palestinians are
today struggling helplessly to live as a result
of a harsh and unforgiving Israeli occupation.
Why do I need to defend myself against hurt
ful slurs of racism just because I choose not to
censor myself of criticism directed toward Is
rael?
Of course, let us not forget the abom
inable persecution of the six million Jews in
the I lolocaust. but let us not silence the calls
to stop crimes against humanity happening
now either. Jews, and every person with a
fiber of humanity for that matter, should and
must be allowed to mourn the genocide that
ultimately forced the Jewish population to
try to seek a safe place, free from anti-Semi
tism. That is not the issue here. The issue at
hand, however, is the misuse of the haunting
memory of the Holocaust to deligitimize the
plea of the Palestinian people and those who

call on the international community to re
spect their human rights (myself included).
The issue at hand here is how easily many
people throw around the word "anti-Semit
ic" in order to silence and ostracize any rea
sonable argument against corrupt and vio
lent Israeli policies and practices.
As a humanist. I am against any form of
injustice: Israeli government policies and Is
rael's army just happen to be part of those in
justices. And in this particular case, the per
petrators of an unjust occupation just happen
to be Jewish .They could've been Christians,
Atheists or Muslims, and it would still be as
wrong, as unjust, and just as appalling.
What Norman Finkelstein came to ad
dress is exactly what Amichai Magen'sOp-ed
(January 25,3007) tried to do: invoking sensa
tionalist rhetoric in order to intimidate any
one who thought of listening to an academic
and legitimate argument of how too many
people misuse the memory of the Holocaust
and exploit Jewish suffering in order to si
lence the voices that are critical of Israeli poli
cies toward the native Palestinian people.
Finkelstein did not come to deny the
I lolocaust.The Holocaust did happen, and it
is unfortunately one of the greatest tragedies
in human history. He was not here to deny

that anti-Semitism exists. Unfortunately, it
still does. He came here to tell those like
Amichai Magen that it is perversely wrong
and immoral to accuse people and organiza
tions of anti-Semitism (just as has been done
in yesterday's Op-ed) in order to silence and
deligitimize their cause of securing justice
and freedom for the Palestinian people.
Innocent Palestinians are dying today.
Millions are struggling to live under an unre
lenting occupation that has lasted for over
forty years. Innocent Israelis are dying as
well. As a matter of fact, human beings are
dying every single day from oppressive
regimes and armies. It should not matter who
perpetrates the violence; being Jewish or
Muslim or Christian should never excuse
that. The plea and struggle for seeking justice
is color-blind, race-blind, religion-blind. 1
know the Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East's plea is. After all. you don't see me call
ing you a racist anti-Arab every time you
condemn (and rightly so) ruthless Palestin
ian suicide bombers or when you criticize op
pressive Arab regimes, do you?
