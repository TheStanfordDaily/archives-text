# Whitney Sado: The Public Editor
## 
### 
Right now. it may feel like The
Daily is the laughingstock of
campus. It seems as though
everyone has been asking me about
the ramifications of the squash story,
questioning the integrity and credi
bility of The Daily?
For those readers unfamiliar with
the facts, The Daily published a
front-page article on Tuesday ("On
plane.squash to the rescue," Jan. 23)
that has since come under close
scrutiny. I*he article reported that
Managing Editor of News and men's
squash team co-captain David I lei -
bert — while traveling cross-coun
try with the men's and women's
squash teams — helped restrain and
subdue a violent and disturbed pas
senger who was trying to get off the
airplane during the flight.The article
quoted one of Herbert's teammates,
referring to Herbert a hero.
Upon reading The Daily's article,
another passenger who had been on
the flight contacted the Editor-in-
Chief and informed him that the
story was highly inaccurate. Accord
ing to this passenger, who wished to
remain anonymous because of a
pending criminal investigation re
garding the incident. 1 lerbert actual
ly made the situation worse with his
verbal abuse of Erin Lambert, the
disruptive passenger. litis anony
mous source called I lerbert's actions
on the plane a disgrace to Stanford.
When confronted regarding the
episode, Herbert acknowledged that
his memory of it was slightly hazy and
that he had a couple of drinks on the
flight. He admitted fault and apolo
gized for the article's inaccurate rep
resentation of his role. As a result of
this incident, Herbert has been sus
pended from The Daily for the re
mainder of the volume, which ends
Jan 31st and Editor-in-Chief Patrick
Fitzgerald ran a retraction piece
("Squash story contained inaccura
cies," Jan. 24) on Wednesday — in the
same place on the front page that the
original story ran.
Let me first say that this incident
does indeed reflect questionable
journalistic standards, a gross distor
tion of the truth and an unacceptable
abuse of editorial power. I do not
want to downplay or in any way ex
cuse these improprieties and will ad
dress them shortly. However, the sit
uation is not quite as egregious as it
appears on its face, and I would like
to clear up a few concerns 1 original

ly had so that others may similarly re
alize that The Daily's reliability
should not be completely discount
ed.
When I first read the retraction. 1
like many of you — was appalled and
angered. I felt more than a little be
trayed of the trust I place in the in
tegrity of I he Daily's editors. And due
to my considerable involvement with
the paper over the past four and a half
years. I felt personally embarrassed.
Accordingly. I became quick to judge.
The retraction story made it easy for
me, and others with whom I spoke, to
assume that Herbert had fabricated
the story for personal benefit.
I Jpon closer examination, howev
er. it became evident that the stories
told by Herbert and the anonymous
source were not fundamentally dif
ferent on a factual level. Moth agree
that Herbert involved himself in the
attempt to restrain Lambert and told
her to shut up (though the source
pointed out that Herbert did so re
peatedly and with use of profanity).
Hie issue then, is not factual error but
the passenger's objection to the arti
cle's portrayal of I lerbert as hero.
Iliis portrayal is the regrettable re
sult of various inexcusable missteps
in the editorial process. First, the arti
cle reflects questionable journalistic
standards - it probably should never
have run. because Herbert was the
only reachable source who witnessed
the events. Sometimes ITie Daily,like
most news outlets, must print stories
with only one source. This particular
story, however, probably did not
merit publication theThe Daily.a stu
dent newspaper, without either more
witnesses or a more direct link to the
University.
While the article's writer did refer
to an FBI affidavit that reported the
incident, she was unable to reach the
airline, I SA or the San Francisco po
lice during the course of two hours of
phone calls. The other squash team
members to whom 1 lerbert referred
her when assigning the story had all
been seated too far away from the in
cident to be able to respond to ques
tions about it. Unfortunately, this
was not made clear when the coach
and two players were quoted in the
article as if they had actually wit
nessed the event. The most blatant
misrepresentation was sophomore
Ned Henningsen's statement, "It
shows how everyday people can step
up and become heroes." Through

this comment, a source who did not
even see what happened set the
laudatory tone of the article.
ITiis is not how the story was pre
sented in the final version of the arti
cle. however. Due to the incomplete
reporting resulting from the use of
limited eyewitness sources, the story
became grossly distorted. Hen
ningsen's comment, which apparent
ly was made in a tongue-in-cheek
fashion,best illustrates this.The face
tiousness of this quote is not at all ev
ident from the article. Also, the
writer's interpretation of Herbert's
account includes several references
to the "help" Herbert provided - and.
most conspicuously, the article's
headline suggests Herbert came "to
the rescue." If this headline was in
tended to be playful, it was ill-ad
vised. If it was serious, then it misun
derstood the story. Herbert's short -
lived and minor participation in the
incident was thus vastly misrepre
sented.
ITie fault for this ultimately lies
with 1 lerbert. who displayed an unac
ceptable abuse of his editorial power
by allowing the article to advance
past his desk with these distortions
intact. Herbert had the second-to
last read of the story, and so saw it in
essentially its final form.
Yet he did not edit it to more ac
curately represent the event. In fact,
he removed a phrase that said he
was visibly drunk.This line was not a
direct quote and probably exagger
ated the extent to which Herbert,
who had had two drinks, was intoxi
cated. Whether this deletion repre
sents manipulation on Herbert's
part is debatable, but it is nonethe
less important to note. Regardless.
Herbert's implicit approval of the
article's veracity was both unprofes
sional and dishonest. Herbert
should have removed Henningsen s
comment entirely since it con
tributed nothing but hyperbole (that
was easily misconstrued as sincerity)
to the article. Further, the quote's
source was someone who had not
witnessed the event.
Finally, the whole article should
have been edited to accurately por
tray Herbert's limited role in the inci
dent. Fven accepting I lerbert's claim
that the article was more of a fea
turey article than hard-hitting news,
one cannot excuse his editorial ap
proval of a slanted story. I lerbert
himself is quick to admit misjudg

ment and wrongdoing
Hie Daily has by and large handled
the situation well. Rather than guard
ing its credibility and protecting one
of its own by keeping secret these
clarifications (which came from an
anonymous source who would not go
on record and so could fairly easily be
disregarded), the editors rightly
chose to expose the truth after Her
bert admitted that his memory of
events was somewhat hazy and that
the source's claims may be accurate.
1 lerbert's suspension from the paper
is definitely appropriate. Though the
suspension will ultimately last only
one week since Herbert's position
would have end with the conclusion
of the volume on Jan. 31st anyway,
the publicity of this slap on the wrist,
and the additional consequences
stemming from it, provide ample
punishment for I lerbert's poor judg
ments.
("he decision to print a retraction
in the same conspicuous spot the
original article ran was similarly a
good one. The story needed to be ac
curately told, and due to Herbert's
high-ranking position at The Daily,
his imprudence deserved a particu
larly public explanation.
The decision to take the original
article off Hie Daily's Web site was
wrong, as many frustrated online
readers would likely agree.The edi
tors simply wanted to remove misin
formation, so they have since recon
sidered and taken the more suitable
approach of including the article on
line, accompanied by an editor's
note that explains that the article
contains numerous errors. To quib
ble with semantics, however, the use
of the word "error" seems too ex
treme. Factually, the original article
was accurate; what is at issue is the
grossly inaccurate slant that the
story assumed.
1 lerbert's editorial judgment was
frankly disgraceful and The Daily's
integrity has admittedly been com
promised. However, Herbert's ac
tions were not as unscrupulous as
many probably believe after reading
Wednesday's retraction, and 1 sin
cereh hope that readers retain their
faith in ITie Daily and its hardwork
ing staff. A new volume with a new
assemblage of staff members begins
on Wednesday, and hopefully this
changing of the guard will help every
one put this disappointing episode
behind us.
