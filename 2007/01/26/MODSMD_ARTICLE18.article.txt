Boise State at the Taube Tennis Center.The Cardinal has
only competed in individual tournaments in 2007 and has
not played a dual match since last November when it nar
rowly defeated the University of I lawaii. 4-3.
"We've got a match on Saturday, and it's going to be a
pretty big one for us," senior captain Eric McKean said.
"Boise's pretty good, so we're going to have to come out
blazing."
Stanford rounded out its dual match season in 2006 in
the quarterfinals of the NCAA Championship. Alter an
upset of then-No. 4 Duke in the Round of 16. Stanford
faced then-No. 5 Baylor. Despite leading 3-1. the Cardi
nal was not able to pull off a win. ultimately losing to the
Bears after the match had been moved to the San Fran
cisco Tennis Center due to bad weather.
Stanford will have a chance to avenge last year's loss
to Baylor when it faces the Bears on Feb. 11. In the mean
time, the Cardinal must focus its efforts on No. 4 UCLA.
Southern California and Boise State this weekend.
"We've got a tough schedule." McKean said. "By our
fifth match, we're going to know where we stand, and I think
that's good. Ultimately, it comes down to the spring, but I
think we're either going to come out of these first matches
with a lot of confidence or we're going to look at it and say.
Hey. we've got a lot of hard work and a lot of improving to
do.'
"Either way. I think this is a great schedule." McKean
continued, "because we get to see the best teams in the
country and can compare ourselves. We're going to see
what they've got, and they're going to see what we've got."
In the 2006 season, the team was slated to play the
Broncos in April but the match was cancelled due to rain.
"We tried but just couldn't get the courts dry." head
coach John Whitlinger said. "So, unfortunately, they had
to leave. But they can't wait to play us and we can't wait
to play them because we missed it last year."

ABOUT Boise Stole! The Broncos are coming off the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association Mountain Region Team Playoff where
they advanced to the ITA National Team Indoor Championships
by sweeping UNLV 4-0 and New Mexico 5-0.
Generally speaking. Stanford's team is younger this
year, but by no means is the Cardinal short on talent.
"I don't think that [youth] is so much a factor in ten
nis." Mckean said. "We all grew up playing pretty high
level national tennis, so we've been on this type of stage
before. ()f course college is different since you're playing
for a team. ITiat adds a different pressure to the whole
mix. but we've got some clutch guys. We are young, but at
the same time I think we can step up to the plate."
Sophomore Matt Bruch looks to be one of Stanford's
standouts this year. Due to an injury, the Ail-American
did not compete in the fall but will most likely return to
the lineup on Saturday. As a freshman. Bruch won the
Pac-10 singles title and rounded out the year ranked No.
16 in singles and No. 44 in doubles.
As a doubles team, sophomore Blake Muller and
freshman Paul Morrissey also notched impressive results
in late October when the team advanced to the finals of
the Northwest Regional.
Another young member of the squad, freshman
Richard Wire, showed promise at the Sherwood Cup two
weekends ago when he upset the defending NCAA sin
gles champion, UCLA's No. 5 Benjamin Kohlloeffel.
In addition to being slightly younger, MeKcan com
mented that this year's team is much tighter.
"The team's a ton closer [this year]," he noted. "We've
got some great personalities in our freshmen. I love our
freshmen. They add a lot of energy and enthusiasm, and
they're talented.
"(Wire] rocks my world," McKean continued. "He's re
ally talented and really humble. Iliat's something you don't
find too often in talented athletes. And then we've got some
great sophomores; the whole team is just really close."
The Cardinal will rely on its team unity and fresh tal
ent against a strong Boise State team. Two of the Bron
cos' top players are Luke and Clancy Shields, who
cheeked into the most recent ITA rankings at No. 15 and
94, respectively.
