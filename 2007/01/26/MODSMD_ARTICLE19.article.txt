## AI is "The Answer" in Denver 
### 
Even a month or so after the
trade, I'm still getting used to
the notion of Allen Iverson
not wearing a 'Sixers uniform. The
two went together like bread and
butter. But now that I've had a full
month to digest the change, I'm
thrilled by the explosive implica
tions of the NBAs newest superstar
tandem — Carmelo Anthony and
"The Answer."
In the Nuggets' first two games
following Anthony's suspension for
his role in a December brawl with
the Knicks — both wins — we've
seen glimpses of a future title con
tender. Iverson has flourished in his
role as a point guard with a total of
17 assists, and Carmelo has benefit
ed immediately from the former
Philadelphia star's presence, aver
aging 31 points per game playing
alongside A I.
But questions still linger about
whether or not the duo will be able
to coexist to lead the Nuggets to
long-term success. We all remember
the last time two NBA superstars
were featured in the same lineup,
and let's just say it didn't end well
for the Lakers.
Moreover. Anthony and Iverson
may appear, on the surface at least,
to be head-cases of Shaq and Bryant
proportions. Al had constant fall
outs with his previous coaching
guru. Larry Brown, and has been ar
rested on several occasions for
minor transgressions. Melo. too. has
shown signs of "attitude problems"
in the past, and, for most of his
young career to date, he's been in
the shadows of his fellow players
from the NBA Draft Class of 2003:
Dwayne Wade and Leßron James.
But don't be fooled. As long as
Melo quits sucker-punching people
and running away, the tandem of AI
and Anthony will make the Nuggets
a formidable contender, both in the
West and out of it.
Neither Melo or Iverson has won
a title. Al could practically taste the
championship when he single-hand
edly pulled the Sixers into the 2000
Finals against the Lakers, but he
came up short against Kobe, Shaq
and Phil. Melo, on the other hand,
