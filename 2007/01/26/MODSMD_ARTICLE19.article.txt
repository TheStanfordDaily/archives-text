## AI is "The Answer" in Denver 
### 
Even a month or so after the
trade, I'm still getting used to
the notion of Allen Iverson
not wearing a 'Sixers uniform. The
two went together like bread and
butter. But now that I've had a full
month to digest the change, I'm
thrilled by the explosive implica
tions of the NBAs newest superstar
tandem — Carmelo Anthony and
"The Answer."
In the Nuggets' first two games
following Anthony's suspension for
his role in a December brawl with
the Knicks — both wins — we've
seen glimpses of a future title con
tender. Iverson has flourished in his
role as a point guard with a total of
17 assists, and Carmelo has benefit
ed immediately from the former
Philadelphia star's presence, aver
aging 31 points per game playing
alongside A I.
But questions still linger about
whether or not the duo will be able
to coexist to lead the Nuggets to
long-term success. We all remember
the last time two NBA superstars
were featured in the same lineup,
and let's just say it didn't end well
for the Lakers.
Moreover. Anthony and Iverson
may appear, on the surface at least,
to be head-cases of Shaq and Bryant
proportions. Al had constant fall
outs with his previous coaching
guru. Larry Brown, and has been ar
rested on several occasions for
minor transgressions. Melo. too. has
shown signs of "attitude problems"
in the past, and, for most of his
young career to date, he's been in
the shadows of his fellow players
from the NBA Draft Class of 2003:
Dwayne Wade and Leßron James.
But don't be fooled. As long as
Melo quits sucker-punching people
and running away, the tandem of AI
and Anthony will make the Nuggets
a formidable contender, both in the
West and out of it.
Neither Melo or Iverson has won
a title. Al could practically taste the
championship when he single-hand
edly pulled the Sixers into the 2000
Finals against the Lakers, but he
came up short against Kobe, Shaq
and Phil. Melo, on the other hand,
has yet to come close to winning a title at the pro
fessional level,despite winning an NCAA Champi
onship in his freshman and final year at Syracuse.
I"his should keep the two united and from squab
bling about who takes more shots. Again, you only
have to look as far back as that previously men
tioned Lakers dynasty to see the effects of winning
a ring. Once they had won the big one, the intensity
and drive of Los Angeles' dynamic duo diminished.
And you know the rest of the story from there.
lverson. especially, is the kind of player who
hungers for a championship. I le's done everything
he could have in his career so far — except win a
title. He's getting a bit old, and there's no way that
he'll put his own priorities over those of the team.
A second reason why the Melo-Al pairing will
succeed is the fact that lverson knows how to pass,
unlike some other NBA superstars (see: Bryant,
Kobe). With the Lakers,there was always some sort
of issue with who was going to get the ball, which ul
timately resulted in the battle of egos that brought
an end to LA's championship era. And it all started
with Kobe's trigger-happy playing style.
The common perception of lverson as a "ball
hog" stems from the sheer quantity of shots he took
as a 76er.That perception doesn't take into account
that he was basically the only scoring option every
year, lverson had no other choice but to take shot
after shot and hope for the best.
A 1 should revel in his new role as point guard
for the Nuggets, penetrating the lane and kicking it
out to Carmelo at will. Those who say he can't or
won't pass are simply ignoring the situation he's
been in for his whole career up until this point.
It's also important to take note of the develop
ment that both players have made in recent years,
lverson. once popular for his public diatribe on
"practice." seems as if he has finally wised up after
passing the age 30 threshold. He sees the big pic
ture now: winning an NBA title.
If lverson has matured off of the court, Melo has
done the same. When he first entered the NBA,
many doubted his attitude and whether he was any
thing more than a Glenn Robinson-esque scorer
who would only play defense on occasion. Carme
lo has since erased all doubts about his game in this
regard with his performance both last year and at
the beginning of this season, making a commitment
to defense and emerging as a leader for the
Nuggets.
Of course there was the incident in New York,
but I really don't think that a player getting into a
fight on the court has any bearing on his ability to
be a leader or a team player.
As far as I'm concerned, this trade will be noth
ing less than "The Answer" for a Denver franchise
looking to establish itself once and for all as a force
to be reckoned with in the NBA.
