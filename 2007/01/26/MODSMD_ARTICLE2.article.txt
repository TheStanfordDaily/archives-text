# BLOCK PARTY
## Brook Lopez's tripledouble powers Card 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
After a night of hard work, freshman for
ward Brook Lopez took a victory leap into the
student section at Maples Pavilion. Given his
performance on the court, no one could blame
him for his celebratory mood.
The 7-foot freshman put together one of
the best single-game individual efforts in
school history to help Stanford to a 65-50 vic
tory over No. 25 USC. Mis IS points and 11 re
bounds both matched or set new career highs,
and his 12 blocks shattered the previous
school record.
"I don't really have words for how it felt to
walk off the court after a game like that,"
Lopez said. "I can't tell you how great it feels."

ABOUT UCLA: The Bruins visit Maples Pavilion on Sun

California last night in Berkeley, 62-46, to claim sole
possession of first place in the conference standings


MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
Freshman forward Brook Lopez notched the first triple-double in Stanford history since at least 1 985
in Stanford's 65-50 win over No. 25 USC.
I ml' tuple-double In I.ope/ was
the Inst by any Stanford player 111 at
least 22 years (conference records for
that statistic only date back to 1985)
and only the second for any Pac-10
player this season. 1 lis 12 blocks in one
name crushed the previous school
record ot si\. which was tied earlier
this season by his brother. Robin.
ITie team's 19 blocks also set a new
school record, besting the previous
mark ol 13. set against Oregon State
during the 2003-2004 season.
"Brook is getting healths and in
shape Stanford coach I'rent Johnson
said of I ope/, who missed the first five
names of the season after having back
surgeiA in September. "He is starting
to show ,i lot more discipline. Plus, he
had i favorable matchup tonight
against another very good player, Taj
Gibson Brook is getting better, just
like the team is"
I S( 'sow n star freshman. 6-foot-9
Gibson, struggled both offensively
and defensively against 1 .opez. On the
offensive end. he was frustrated by
l.opez' long arms and solid post play,
and on defense he had difficulty keep
ing Lope/ awa\ from the basket.
"1 definitely think that I frustrated
him." Lope/ said. "I lis turnaround
shot was working great early, but for
some reason he went away from that.
I'm not sure why he stopped that shot,
but I wasn't giving him much space
down low."
Lope/ and the Cardinal took con
trol ol the game from the start. Just
ft:3o into the game, the Cardinal (13-5.
5-3 Pacific-10 Conference) led 12-2
behind si\ points from its freshman
forward The Stanford lead swelled to
17 points by halftime, 37-20.
Gibson and junior guard Nick
Young were the sole offensive threats
for the Trojans (15-ft. 5-3) in the first
half. Young scored II of USC's 20
points, and Gibson had seven first-pe
riod points.
"I don't think that we could play as
ell for 20 minutes again as we did in
;he first half," Johnson said. "We did a
iieat job altering their shots, taking
iood angles and keeping them out of
rhythm."
Sophomore Lawrence Hill
matched Lopez's offensive produc
tion with IS points. I le also added nine
rebounds and tour blocks, but. maybe
mo importantly, clamped down on
Young defensively in the second half.
USC's leading scorer had just two
points m the second period, on l-of-7
shooting.
"Tonight it came down to prepa

ration for me." Hill said. "1 haven't
had a whole lot of experience guard
ing guys at small forward. But all
week I've been working on my de
fense. Coach [Nick] Robinson has
been simulating Young in practice to
get me ready."
The Trojan offense never clicked,
scoring nearly 22 points fewer than
their season average. As a team, they
shot 25.4 percent from the field and
23.5 percent from beyond the three
point line.
USC did make two runs in the sec
ond half. During one stretch in the
middle of the half, the Trojans held the
Cardinal offense scoreless for over
seven minutes and cut a 22-point
deficit to nine. Brook Lopez ended the
run with a floater in the lane.
"USC is a tough, solid group."
Johnson said. "There are going to be
droughts against a team like that. But
Brook had a big shot to get us going
again."
After Robin Lopez's quick lay-in
to start the second half, the Trojans
scored nine straight points to cut the

Stanford lead to 39-29.
But Stanford countered with a big
run of its own. scoring the next 10
points to build a 22-point lead, its
biggest of the game.
Mitch Johnson had his most com
plete game of the season, scoring
seven points with five rebounds and
eight assists. The sophomore guard,
who was held to limited minutes in re
cent weeks due to a bout with influen
za, directed the Cardinal offense for 30
minutes.
"Mitch Johnson was really good
tonight."Trent Johnson said. "I think
this was a long time coming for him —
not the scoring, but taking care of the
ball as well as he did."
Life does not get any easier for the
Cardinal on Sunday when it faces No.
3 UCLA, the fifth ranked opponent
for Stanford in the last six games.
"The reward we get for tonight is
playing someone even better on Sun
day." Trent Johnson said.
Tip-off with the Bruins (18-1,7-1) is
scheduled for 5:00 p.m. Sunday at
Maples Pavilion.
