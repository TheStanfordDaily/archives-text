# BLOCK PARTY
## Brook Lopez's tripledouble powers Card 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
After a night of hard work, freshman for
ward Brook Lopez took a victory leap into the
student section at Maples Pavilion. Given his
performance on the court, no one could blame
him for his celebratory mood.
The 7-foot freshman put together one of
the best single-game individual efforts in
school history to help Stanford to a 65-50 vic
tory over No. 25 USC. Mis IS points and 11 re
bounds both matched or set new career highs,
and his 12 blocks shattered the previous
school record.
"I don't really have words for how it felt to
walk off the court after a game like that,"
Lopez said. "I can't tell you how great it feels."
