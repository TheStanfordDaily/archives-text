## Midwest trip a change of pace Card travel for two against IPFW 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
With a break from Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation competition,
the Stanford men's volleyball team is
leaving the mountains and Pacific be
hind this weekend and heading east.
The Cardinal (0-7, 0-4 MPSF)
will face sub-freezing temperatures
and a Top Ten team when it plays a
pair of non-conference matches at
No. 7 Indiana University-Purdue
University Fort Wayne on Friday
and Saturday nights.
The Mastodons (4-0. 1-0 Mid
west Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation) are the next in a string of
ranked opponents that Stanford has
played and will continue to face
throughout the conference season.
The Cardinal dropped a pair to No.
2 BYU last weekend and will take
on No. 12 Pacific next week.
The trip to Indiana will be a change
of scenery for the players who have
not yet played outside California. In
fact. Stanford has only one other trip
outside the state on its schedule, a
weekend in I lawaii in April.
"It's a hostile environment, cold
weather — which some of our guys
are not used to — and it's just dif
ferent." head coach John Kosty said.
"For the future of this program
these are definitely trips we need to
take."
The trip will also give the Cardi
nal an opportunity to see unfamiliar
competition and get outside the
MPS I. which can help both Stan
ford and the conference as a whole.
"First, it gives us the opportunity
to travel, be on the road, be in a dif
ferent. hostile environment, and
then it doesn't count in league."
Kosty said."lt will count in the over
all picture for going to the NCAA
Championships, but it doesn't count

in our league.
"Secondly, heading into the na
tional championships, these are
matches that the MPSF needs to
win," he continued. "It gives us, as a
league, the ability to put more teams
into the national championship. So
it is key for us to come out with a
couple of wins."
IPFW, also known as "Arnie's
Army" for head coach Arnie Ball, are
unfamiliar opponents for the Cardi
nal and. unlike most match-ups, the
coaches do not have film to heip pre
pare their teams. Although scouting
generally plays a hig role in the lead
up to a match. Kosty is happy with the
opportunity to focus the team's at
tention on their own side of the net.
"The team we have right now is a
young team, so I like just thinking
about us." he said. "From statistics
and the good old Internet, there are
ways to pick up some tendencies,
find out who is starting. We under
stand the team make-up, we just
haven't seen them in person. So it's
more knowing just a little bit about
their team and really trying to cor
rect the things that have led to our
errors in recent matches."
The Mastodons have not lost in
their first four matches of the season
and swept all but one opponent. Last
weekend, they needed five games to
get past No. 13 Loyola-Chicago to
maintain their perfect record.
Outside hitter CJ Macias was the
National Player of the Week after
the Mastodons' opening weekend
and spearheads the IPFW attack,
with 83 kills, more than twice as
many as any other player. Macias is
a threat from the whole court; he
leads his team in digs and is second
in blocks. Josh Stewart leads the
blocking defense and is second on
the team in kills, tied with Josh
Collins who has 32 kills and a hitting

The Cardinal has been led by
junior outside hitter Matt Ceran

Junior outside hitter Jesse Mered

until he injured his ankle in the fifth
match of the season. Junior Brian
Skinner has taken his place in the
lineup and will most likely see plenty
of action against the Mastodons.
"[Skinner] played well last week
and it looks like [he will start),"
Kosty said. "We've got 12 guys who
can really help our team, so it's not a
situation of starters. It's who is play

our bench being able to come in and
step up and improve the match."
