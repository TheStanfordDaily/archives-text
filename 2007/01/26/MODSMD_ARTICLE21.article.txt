## Menlo provides local opposition Card look to keep rolling as Pac-10 season looms 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Wrestling's goal in November and De
cember was to gear up for the season with the
toughest non-conference opponents they
could find. In January, the focus shifted to re
cuperation and preparing for the heart of the
Pac-10 schedule to come. Saturday, the Cardi
nal has one more chance for a tune up — as
Stanford hosts Menlo College just before the
competition truly heats up.
Stanford (4-5, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
will be looking to extend its current winning
streak to three matches against the Oaks (7-
10). Cardinal head coach Kerry McCoy cau
tioned that his squad could not afford to over
look Menlo given the tough slate of competi
tion coming up.
"Menlo is one of the top NAIA schools,"
McCoy said. "There should be a big local
crowd, and they may not be a Division I pro
gram. but they are very tough. They've got a
bunch of solid individuals, and the thing that 1
really like about Menlo is they've got a lot of
guys who just wrestle hard for seven min
utes."
Hie Cardinal will be led yet again by its
pair of nationally ranked juniors. No.3 Tanner
Gardner is 27-3 and a reigning All-American
at 125 pounds.and No. 17 Josh Zupancic is 27-
7on the season at 1 57 pounds. Gardner enters
the dual against the Oaks as the top-ranked
wrestler in the Pac-10 while Zupancic is cur
rently second in the conference.
Stanford has also seen strong early-season
showings from true-freshman Zack Giesen at
184 pounds, sophomore Luke Feist at 174
pounds and the squad's lone senior, Brian
Perry, at 165 pounds. Ciiesen and Perry are
each ranked third in their respective weight
classes in the Pac-10 with Feist ranked fourth.
Perry and Giesen are each new contribu
tors to the Cardinal. Giesen was a big-time
performer in high school, boasting a 118-11
career record and four Oregon state
wrestling titles, and is quickly living up to his
potential in the Pac-10. having earned 21 vic
tories so far this season. Perry, on the other
hand, has broken into the starting ranks as a
senior and is making the most of his opportu
nity.

heating everyone inside and outside the con
ference. [Perry has] proven that he can beat
all the top guys, and he's out there just chip
ping away — he's able to get those wins when
they're in tight situations. Now he's in a better
situation to get a higher seed in the confer
ence tournament, win the conference tourna
ment and be an All-American."
Despite all the momentum on Stanford's
side following the squad's surprising 22-21
win over conference rival Cal State-Bakers
field and a 37-6 trouncing of San Francisco
State, McCoy still expects a hard-fought
match.
"Menlo is going to give us a good test be
cause we're riding a wave right now," he said.
"It's going to be a different talent level than
we're used to and a different level of intensi
ty, but we've competed against them a couple
of times in the last year and a half, so it's going
to be a true battle.
"We talk to our guys constantly about the
way we set up our schedule and our training,"
McCoy continued. "So hopefully our guys
aren't taking them lightly. If we wrestle our
best we should be able to handle our own. but,
at the same time, it gives the guys another
chance to get to the place they need to be
their best.
"Just like 1 said about San Francisco State,
