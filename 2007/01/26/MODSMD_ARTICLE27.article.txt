standing research interest in career
development, he shares some of his
thoughts regarding beliefs students
have that can be obstacles for a stu
dent's career development.
Have you ever discovered that one
of your cherished assumptions was not
true? Almost everyone has. Beliefs
and assumptions about the world of
work and what you need for success
have a profound effect on the actions
you do. or do not, take. Here are the
three most troublesome:
The belief that you must declare your
occupational goal in advance. You
receive pressure from schools, employers
and parents to state what occupation you
will enter after you graduate. The truth is
that you really do not know. Telling peo
ple that you do not know, or that you are
undecided, is not well received. You can,
of course, make up some prestigious occu
pation ("I'm going to be an investment
banker") which will please everyone and
get them off your back for a while. Or
instead of saying you arc "undecided,"
you can state that you are "open-minded."
That sounds much better though it means
the same thing. Or you can ask your ques
tioner. "What is your occupational title
now? Was that the occupational goal you
had declared when you were 18?" Almost
all employed adults are working at jobs
and in locations that they never anticipat
ed at your age. You can politely confront
them with, "If you didn't decide on your
future occupation when you were 18, is it
reasonable to expect that I should do so
now?"

Slavery has been
abolished. You don't have
to work at a job you hate.

The belief that you should discover
your passion before taking your first
job. Sonic people are passionate about
work; most are not —especially at first.
Passion is learned —it is not an inborn
trait. You learn to be passionate about
an activity after you have tried it out
and found it to important and enjoyable
for you. Don't think that you can wait
to discover your passion before taking
on a new job. Take the job (almost any
job), do your very best at the tasks,
learn new skills, and see how you like it.
You can learn a lot of practical skills on
the job. and you can earn a reputation
for being a helpful and dependable
employee.
The belief that von must stick with a
particular type of work when it is no
longer satisfying. Slavery has been
abolished. You don't have to work at a
job you hate. You should always have
your eyes and ears open to detect new
opportunities. Your first job might
enable you to meet people who can
help you find your second job. You
must be the one to take the initiative,
but unexpected opportunities abound
if you are alert and bold enough to
jump into a previously unexplored ter
ritory.

Examples of people who have overcome
these and oilier troublesome beliefs ran be
