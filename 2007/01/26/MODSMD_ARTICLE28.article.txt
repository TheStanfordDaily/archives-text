# Business Leader Says Today's Engineers Have to Be Entrepreneurial
## 
### 
"Every engineer and scientist entering the job
market today needs to be entrepreneurial,
whether or not they plan to start their own busi
ness," says Donna Novitsky, partner at venture
capital firm Mohr Davidow Ventures and adjunct
professor in the School of Engineering. "It's no
longer an optional job qualification. It's a ticket to
entry in leading companies, even for undergrads."
Fortunately, one of the world's most
renowned entrepreneurship education programs
for engineers exists right here at Stanford. It's the
Stanford Technology Ventures Program (STVP)
in the School of Engineering.
