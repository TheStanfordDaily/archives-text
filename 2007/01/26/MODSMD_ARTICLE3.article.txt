## Friends, colleagues express shock at apparent suicide 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As word of 23-year old Mengvao "May"
Zhou's death trickled out. the graduate
community registered shock and sadness
and many expressed surprise at the appar

ent suicide of the second
year doctoral student ir
electrical engineering.
"It was a terrible shock
as I think we were all hop
ing she would show up
soon." said Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC) co
chair and electrical engi
neering student Paul Gur
nev. "Like all of May's

grad. student colleagues at Stanford, I'm re
ally sad about the latest news."
Zhou had been missing since Saturday,
and her body was found locked in the trunk
of her car at Santa Rosa Junior College. Po
lice have tentatively ruled her death a sui
cide.
Some Muduits expressed surprise that a
student as driven, ambitious and seemingly
successful as Zhou would have taken her
own life.
"I am very shocked to hear this, and I
can't believe she could have committed sui
cide. Even after she was found missing. I
wasn't expecting her to turn out dead."
wrote Yuki'Konda in an e-mail to the Daily.
A fellow electrical engineering student.
Konda took a class with Zhou and worked
on a computer vision project with her.
"She was a very driven individual and the
main motivator of our group." lie added.
"She did a lot of work."
Konda, like others, said that he was sur
prised to find out that foul play was not in
volved.
"I think it's just odd." lie said,adding that
figuring out what might have driven Zhou to
take her own life is "hard to say since we

can't really see inside her mind."
Many graduate students found out about
Zhou's death through e-mail lists. One e
mail from Director of the Graduate Life Of
fice Chris Griffith, which labeled the death
"an apparent suicide." was sent to residents
of Rains I louse, where Zhou lived. Students
then forwarded the e-mail to other graduate
student lists.
"The atmosphere here has been con
cerned [since her disappearance],'' said Eva
Steinle-Darling.one of two head Communi
ty Associates at Rains. "1 haven't spoken to
anyone who knew her personally, but every
one was anxious and wondering."
Stemlc Darling also said that Zhou's
roommate is currently off-campus with fam
ily friends in an effort to stay away from the
