There are a variety of
resources you can use in finding a
satisfying internship. One tool is
the Cardinal Careers jobs data
base. Log into your Cardinal
Careers account and click the
"jobs" button. You can do a
"detailed search" by criteria
including industry, company
name, location, job title, and/or a
series of key words. We recom
mend you check back weekly to
obtain any new listings submitted
to the system.
If you haven't set up a Cardinal
Careers account with the CDC,
you can do so by going to
https://stanford.csm.symplicity.com
/students and clicking the tab for
"New student/alumni registration."
Following is a partial list of

to the Cardinal Careers jobs data
base in the last couple of weeks. If
