Wasted wood: Engineers seek a more sus
tainable building material
A home builder can use a wide variety of
materials to build a house that is durable, but
virtually none of those choices will build a
house that is sustainable. At a time of bulging
landfills, record construction and enormous
third-world needs for housing, a group of
Stanford engineers is rethinking the life cycle
of today's building materials. They are
demonstrating how new "biocomposite"
materials could cycle through landfills much
more quickly than wood, minimizing waste,
providing energy, preserving perhaps thou
sands of acres of trees, and maybe even help
ing slow global warming.
"Materials that are used in a building are
often eventually sent to a landfill, not just the
structural materials hut the non-structural
ones as well," says Sarah Billington. an associ
ate professor of civil and environmental engi
neering (CEE). She leads a team of five pro
fessors and three graduate students who think
the solution might be in developing biocom
posites: strong hut quickly biodegrading
sheets of natural resins reinforced by fibers,
such as hemp or jute. "From what we know so
far about their mechanical properties, our
materials could be a replacement for wood.
Housing definitely is something to which this
can be applied."
Housing has a huge environmental impact.
In 2005, U.S. homebuilders used an all-time
high 27.6 billion board feet (165.6 million
cubic meters) of lumber for residential con

struction, according to the Western Wood
Products Association. Overseas demand is sig
nificant as well. In fact, an estimated S(H) mil
lion people around the world lack adequate
housing. Meanwhile, wood makes up a quar
ter of all debris from construction and demoli
tion. accounting for 35.1 million tons in 1998,
according to the Environmental Protection
Agency.
Changing the landfill landscape
When lumber and plywood go to the land
fill—tons did after Hurricane Katrina
destroyed about 2(K).()()() homes —they biode
grade in an anaerobic process that emits
methane. If not collected, this gas can seep
into the atmosphere, contributing to the
greenhouse effect and global warming, says
CEE Professor Craig Criddle. who is working
with Billington on the project. Although
methane is useful as an energy source, it just
isn't economical for small landfill owners to
invest in harvesting it. because decaying wood
and other landfilled materials release methane
so slowly.
Biocomposites, by contrast, degrade much
faster than wood and could therefore make
recapturing methane a profitable energy prac
tice. Alternatively, because methane can be
used to make the resin that is used in the bio
composites. much of the material's mass could
be chemically recycled into new biocomposite
materials of similarly high quality. In either
case, landfills would become productive parts
of a sustainable, "closed-loop" process, rather
than just dumps.

The most promising materials the group
has tested so far are made by fusing together
many layers of a plastic-like material made
from hemp fibers in a polyhydroxy-butyrate
(PUB) resin. The resin, produced commercial
ly by Procter & Gamble under the brand
name Nodax. is made naturally by a number
of microbes as their way of storing excess
food. These microbes thrive in oxygen-rich
environments, using a variety of food supplies.
The Stanford team is focusing particularly on
microbes that consume methane. When they
are fed extra methane but deprived of the
other chemicals, Criddle says, they store away
the carbon from the methane in the form of
PUB granules. These can be extracted and
made into a very strong resin either for plas
tics or for biocomposite building materials.
In lab tests, the group has found that hemp
reinforced PHB resin has almost exactly the
same tensile strength as wood. The material
has been able to withstand loads causing
between 30 and 55 million Pascals (a unit of
pressure), while common framing woods such
as Douglas fir typically rate between 28 and 55
million Pascals. Other tests have shown that
the material biodegrades in the right environ
ment not only much faster than wood, but also
much faster than any other biocompositc.
"It has two things going for it." Criddle
says, "fast biodegradation and strength."
Open questions, open future
While the biocomposites and a sustainable
process for making them, using them and then
reusing them, seem promising, Billington and

("riddle readily acknowledge questions remain
to be studied. One is whether the material
would biodegrade at an undesirable pace
while it is still "in service." Clearly no one
wants structural elements of their house to
start breaking down. The group also hasn't yet
tested how the material would best he sawed,
drilled, routed or planed. In other words, it is
as strong as wood, but might not be worked in
the same way.
For all the open questions, the researchers
arc optimistic that they are on to something
that could lessen the environmental costs of
the vital human need for shelter. The team is

Fundamentally their contribution has been
not only to test promising materials but also
to study their environmental impact during
their entire life cycle of use. disposal and

"We are excited to be developing an inte
grated cycle," Criddle says. Adds Billington:
"This is a great opportunity to make building
products that serve a societal need and respect
and protect the natural environment. We're
engineering materials to be used and then

many layers of a plastic-like material made
from hemp fibers in a polyhydroxy-butyrate
(PUB) resin. The resin, produced commercial
ly by Procter & Gamble under the brand
name Nodax. is made naturally by a number
of microbes as their way of storing excess
food. These microbes thrive in oxygen-rich
environments, using a variety of food supplies.
The Stanford team is focusing particularly on
microbes that consume methane. When they
are fed extra methane but deprived of the
other chemicals, Criddle says, they store away
the carbon from the methane in the form of
PUB granules. These can be extracted and
made into a very strong resin either for plas
tics or for biocomposite building materials.
In lab tests, the group has found that hemp
reinforced PHB resin has almost exactly the
same tensile strength as wood. The material
has been able to withstand loads causing
between 30 and 55 million Pascals (a unit of
pressure), while common framing woods such
as Douglas fir typically rate between 28 and 55
million Pascals. Other tests have shown that
the material biodegrades in the right environ
ment not only much faster than wood, but also
much faster than any other biocompositc.
"It has two things going for it." Criddle
says, "fast biodegradation and strength."
Open questions, open future
While the biocomposites and a sustainable
process for making them, using them and then
reusing them, seem promising, Billington and

("riddle readily acknowledge questions remain
to be studied. One is whether the material
would biodegrade at an undesirable pace
while it is still "in service." Clearly no one
wants structural elements of their house to
start breaking down. The group also hasn't yet
tested how the material would best he sawed,
drilled, routed or planed. In other words, it is
as strong as wood, but might not be worked in
the same way.
For all the open questions, the researchers
arc optimistic that they are on to something
that could lessen the environmental costs of
the vital human need for shelter. The team is
composed of Billington. Criddle, aeronautics
and astronautics Professor George Springer,
chemical engineering Professor Curt Frank.
CEE Professor Emeritus Perry McCarty and
CEE graduate students Molly Morse, Alison
Pieja and Sarah Christian. The project is fund
ed by a grant from the Woods Institute for the
Environment at Stanford.
Fundamentally their contribution has been
not only to test promising materials but also
to study their environmental impact during
their entire life cycle of use. disposal and
reuse.
"We are excited to be developing an inte
grated cycle," Criddle says. Adds Billington:
"This is a great opportunity to make building
products that serve a societal need and respect
and protect the natural environment. We're
engineering materials to be used and then
removed from service to generate energy and
re-create the substance needed to make them
all over again, closing the loop."
