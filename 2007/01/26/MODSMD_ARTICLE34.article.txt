## Nanotechnology: Smaller is Better 
### 
Of all the amazing technologies
for seeing inside the body, one of the
most versatile may be yet to come.
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) can
produce instant three-dimensional
images for diagnosis of diseases such
as cancer and atherosclerosis. At

Stanford, researchers led by electri
cal engineering Professor Butrus
•'Pierre" Khuri-Yakub are develop
ing innovations to deliver PAl's full
potential as a multipurpose, sensi
tive, and safe imaging tool.
In part because of advances

Khuri-Yakub is pursuing in collabo
ration with students and colleagues
at Stanford Engineering and at the
medical school. PAI is beginning to
look like it can offer many of the
best attributes of many other diag
nostic imaging technologies. Each
existing technology has its limita
tions. so new technologies are still
needed. For example, computerized
tomography scans can penetrate
deep into the body but involve
exposing patients to a level of harm
ful radiation. Ultrasound has very
high resolution but also produces a
very artifact-riddled image.
But PAI has very high resolution,
penetrates as deep as three centime
ters below the skin, produces a clear
image, can distinguish among differ
ent tissues and is safe, Khuri-Yakub
says. It can show, for example,
where there is an abundance of oxy
genated blood, which is often an
indicator of tumors. Compared to
some kinds of imaging. PAI is also
relatively inexpensive.
There are two opportunities to
optimize PAI. and Khuri-Yakub's
group is pursuing both. One is to
improve the transducers. To do that,
Khuri-Yakub has cast aside the
piezoelectric materials that have tra
ditionally been used. Instead he
makes arrays in silicon using tech
niques familiar in making microelec

tronics. Khuri-Yakub's chips are
called Capacitive Micromachined
Ultrasonic Transducers, or CMUTs.
There are several advantages to
rummaging in the semiconductor
industry's seemingly bottomless bag of
manufacturing tricks. By making
arrays of transducers in different geo
metric arrangements, for example,
Khuri-Yakub can create sensors for a
wide variety of tasks. An array of trans
ducers produced on a flexible sheet of
silicon could be wrapped around a
catheter like the rubber grip on a pen.
In that arrangement, the transducers
can "see" on all sides of the catheter. If
a doctor inserted a laser-equipped
catheter into a major artery in a
patient, the transducers could image
the plaque buildup on the walls.
In addition, the CMUTs can eas
ily be integrated with silicon com
puter chips that can amplify and
process the signals, says Omer
Oralkan, a postdoctoral researcher
in the group. CMUTs can also be
fashioned to be sensitive to a wider
range of frequencies than can piezo
electric transducers. National
Semiconductor has been making the
chips for free for the group.
What makes nanoparticles—liny
gold balls 300 billionths of a meter in
diameter —so special is that they can
be fine-tuned in three important
ways. First, researchers can attach

proteins to them that are the exact
match for proteins in tissues of inter
est, such as tumors. When such
nanoparticles arc injected, they will
link up only with cancer cells. When
they show up in a photoacoustic
image, radiologists will he able to
clearly sec where the tumor is.
Second, researchers can enhance
the nanoparticles to produce better
image clarity. Materials science and
engineering Assistant Professor
Mark Brongcrsma, who is making
the nanoparticles, can put a variety
of chemical coatings on them to pre
dispose them to absorb specific fre
quencies of laser light They are
then especially prone to heating and
therefore producing sound.
Finally, the nanoparticles can also
be crafted to resonate at particular
ultrasound frequencies. This would
make them especially well suited in
systems that combine photoacoustic
imaging with ultrasound imaging.
Khuri-Yakub's CMUTs can do such
double-duty. Experiments using the
nanoparticles as a photoacoustic
"contrast agent" have begun in the
lab of Sam Gambhir. a professor of
radiology in the School of Medicine.
While the research, both in nan
otechnology and microelectronics,
looks promising, the real benefit will
come when the technology can reach
patients.
