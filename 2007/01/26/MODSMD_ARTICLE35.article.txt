In the past both students and sponsors have
regarded the program with high esteem, with
evaluation remarks by students saying that.
"The program enabled me to realize what 1
had to do to reach my future goals, in terms of
education and work, but also personal skills."
And another evaluation stating that it is a,
"Good view in the day-to-day activities and
challenges that are faced in the work place."

The original Shadow Program was estab
lished over 15 years ago in 1991 through a
Banker's Trust grant to promote diversity for
career outreach for the benefit of Stanford
students. Today it's core mission is still the
same, aiming to provide first-hand learning
about a career field of a student's choice, in
addition to lending exposure to an array of
jobs.
What the Shadow Program does is contact
local professionals in the Bay Area, as
requested by a student, for a one-day observa
tion of their workday. Students are given the
chance to follow a career professional and ask
questions about their day-to-day work life. It's
an excellent introduction into a specific career
field, if not the world of work in general.
Our career fields range from Non-Profit
Public Service, to Engineering, to Medicine,
with plenty of options in between. One stu
dent participant commented. "I saw what
being a freelance graphic designer was like. 1
also received advice about certain Stanford
classes and professors." While another wrote,
"I learned a lot about the differences in the
consulting industry and the consequences of
being a woman in those fields."
Overall the Shadow Program caters to the

needs and schedules of students. With rolling
applications throughout the school year and
no deadline for completion of the Shadow
visit, it is structured entirely on the demands
of a busy student. All students have to do is go
on-line to the CDC's Shadow Program web
site http://cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/shad
ow . look through the database of available
hosts and request a sponsor. Students can
chose up to three per application. After the
requests have been sent in, the Shadow
Program Coordinator will contact the request
ed sponsor(s) and reply to the student with
contact information or alternate sponsor
names (in case of unavailability). From then
on it is the student's responsibility to contact
the sponsor for the visit arrangement.
While this may seem daunting, students
should rest assured that our sponsors are very
responsive to students and very amiable. One
sponsor in particular noted that the best part of
the program was the "feeling that I could con
tribute to personal and professional growth of
students." Others had similar opinions.
Alumni want to connect with students; "Fun
seeing students so early in their career choic
es", "I enjoyed showing my shadow the variety
of work available in my job" In addition the

"The program enabled me to
realize what I had to do to
reach my future g0a15..."

program is very flexible, centered on students'
schedules and those of the Shadow sponsors.
One student writes, "the program itself is a
great opportunity" and in response to the
question."What specific information was of
greatest value to you?" Different participant
replies represent the various benefits of the
program:
•Talking through what they liked and
didn't like about their job
•Advice for how to get hired and
•Learning about her lifestyle with her
career
