# Trailers: Tossin the trash so you don't have

INTERMISSION TRAILER PARK DENIZEN
I've grown up as a preview lover in a let's-get-straight-to
the-movie family. On those occasions when 1 could ignore the
bellowing of angry parents, annoyed at my disobedience with
the remote, I got to enjoy anywhere from two minutes to half
an hour of genius. Previews, you see, elicit within me the delight
of anticipation, familiar to us all in the best of every kind of
story — when will Elizabeth finally fall for Darcy? Jim kiss
Pam? Ender save the world? This movie actually come out so
that I can see the whole, wonderful thing?
Previews manage to condense an entire two hours into two min
utes, answering the most important questions about the movie, such

I as whether it's a thriller, drama or come
dy; whether a halfway decent car ,

chase; and whether the lead actor is

I hot enough to make the cut.
They also provide an ab-

sorbing way to pass the time
whilst procrastinating, as
one can easily watch them 4

online. And since ex
citement and antici- 6
pation are some of V
life's great joys — 1
see, again, that Jim
and Pam tension —
here are a few exam
ples of that greatness

in action. w
"Shrek the Third": 1
Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, \
et al are back — again. I
In the fairytale world of
spoiled princesses and
pure-evH villains, we

i tflg
find Shrek struggling 1
to be king-material, ,
Donkey transformed

into a cat and chaos and
mayhem abounding. Looks
like another hit.

"Lucky You": Eric Bana and Drew Bar- \
rymore star in what appears more a cliche

than a movie, a tale about a poker player who "plays cards as he
should live his life, and lives his life as he should play cards" (re
arrange the words a little, then cue Yoda). The only thing standing
between our young hero and gambling victory is his dysfunctional re
" laltonship with his father (just after Yoda leaves, cue sappy music).
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles": Yes. Yesyesyes! If previews
can predict the future, this movie is destined to be as amazing as its

TV predecessor. Anything with fighting turtles and pizza has to be
awesome, and the quick cuts, potty humor and juxtaposition of ac
tion and comedy are just right. There's even a "your mom" joke.
"Perfect Stranger": Halle Berry's friend goes missing after
having an affair with Bruce Willis. Berry sets out to discover the
truth and in the process must get close to Willis herself. A seem
ingly run-of-the-mill thriller, but one that appears to have a
good mix of intelligence and scariness, coupled with a hearty
dose of "danger" music. But there is a chance that the preview
gives too much away — I already think 1 know who did it with
out even being sure of what "it" is.
"Because I Said So": Cliched chick flick #1098432, right down to
its starring Mandy Moore and the prominent use of Natasha Bed
ingfield's song "Unwritten" in the uplifting second half of the pre
view. The storyline focuses on Diane Keaton's upcoming 60th birth-

day, her romantic es- 11
capades and her obsession I

with the love lives of
her daughters.
What's unclear

from the preview is 11

p whether it will rise to II
the clich6-but-wonder- II

ful heights of "Love, Actu
• ally" or sink to so-cute-I
a could-puke depths.
"300": Based on the
raphic novel by Frank Miller,
Jie movie appears to be.de
signed for anyone who
\ doesn't tire of seeing
swords/spears/axes/ar
■ rows thrown/fired &ver and
V over again for the duration
•J of a film. The preview it
self is overwrought, over-
Iramatic and more than a lit
tle overbearing but contains a
brilliant use of sepia tones.
It's an artistic preview, to be
sure, although not necessari-

ly one to sell a movie.
"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver 11

\» / Surfer": Silver Surfer? Are you kidding me? The
\ /' preview for this sequel to the first "Fantastic Four"
showcases a chase scene between Johnny the human
torch and a mysterious "Silver Surfer" from outer space (appear
ance-wise, he really is a flying silver guy on a surf board). Fun if you
like cheesy. Ridiculous if you do not. Actually, ridiculous either way.
In the end, like all previews, trailers are just fun to watch. I mean,
even the worst, most melodramatic of the bunch are at least more fun
than that econ problem set, right?
