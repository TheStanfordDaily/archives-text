## 'Catch' with Garner offers a real release: 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION FISHERMAN 
For a film with plot points including a dead husband-to-be, an
illegitimate child and an attempted suicide, "Catch and Release"
sure is a cheery little charmer. Delivering on the trailer's promise
of being a romantic comedy chick-flick, you can rest assured
knowing that the broken-hearted protagonist found at will love
again and find said love very soon in the "most unexpected" place
(at least, as regarded by anyone not in the audience) while cute
characters abound along the way. What sets "Catch and Release"
apart, then, is that it succeeds with genuinely likeable characters
and a pervasive optimism through which individuals deal with
and overcome tragedy — instead of just pushing it aside.
The story is pretty basic: The film begins with Gray Wheeler
(Jennifer Garner) mourning the loss of her fiancee, Grady. At the
funeral, Gray serves as an accidental witness to Grady's
scoundrel-of-a-friend Fritz' (Timothy Olyphant) sexual en
counter with a caterer. After packing up her once-futurc family
home, Gray stays in the home of her ex-fiancde's best friends.
Fritz, comes to stay at the house for reasons that become clear
later on, and over time Gray will find that there's much more to

Fritz than she had initially assumed. You
have one guess as to whom these two will
end up with.
The success of the film, however, has
little to do with the events of the pre
dictable plot but with the characters
within the story and how they react to
those events with realism yet not frustra
tion. Garner, while occasionally awk
ward, is quite endearing as a woman

whose life unravels before her eyes. Olyphant is very likeable as
well in the role of the guy we're supposed to hate at first — even

though very few do. Kevin Smith is particularly pleasant as
one of Grady's friends caring for Gray, upping the film's ap
peal to the male demographic while also delivering much of
the film's humor.
While light-hearted, the movie does not skirt around its
serious issues. Ralher, it moves along at a brisk pace that
gives each event proper respect and attention but does not
dwell too long on any one. Writer-director Susannah
Grant avoids overindulgence by showing just enough to
convey emotion to the viewer before moving on, a differ
ence easily seen in scenes such as a moment when Gray
begins to cry. Rather than playing out this scene of tears,
all the viewer sees are the first tears before the film moves
on. The emotional impact, if not heightened, is still there,
but there's none of the tedium that comes all too often
with the genre.
Another great characteristic of the film is that there is no
real bad guy, just a bunch of realistic people, caring and in
teresting in their own individual ways. At several points,
especially with the introduction of a character played by
Juliette Lewis, Grant could easily have fallen into the
realm of stereotyping. Instead, she depicts situations in
which there is no absolute right or wrong and characters
can have conflicting desires but with equally understand
able motivations.
"Catch and Release" is not unlike many chick-flicks
you've already seen. It is, however, a very well-done chick
flick. with a talented cast and a relatable story that both
women and men can enjoy. It's genuine — a sweet story
about loves of all kinds, both lost and found. "Catch and
Release" is no great romance or lasting classic, but for two
hours of varying levels of relationship intimacy and the
honesty between friends and lovers, the film offers an en
joyable viewing experience.
