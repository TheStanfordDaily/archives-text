Santa Rosa police announced last
night that the body of missing sec
ond-year doctoral student in electri
cal engineering Mengyao "May"
Zhou \v;is found in the trunk of her
car. Zhou had been missing since
Saturday when she left her residence
in Rains I louse to run errands.
Speaking to reporters at a 5 p.m.
press conference, authorities did not
release the cause of death, but they
said there were no indications of foul
play. Items in the trunk indicate
Zhou may have committed suicide,
reports said, and the officer who dis
covered the car noted that the car ap
peared to "have been parked there
several days."
"We found some things in the car
that were consistent with suicide,"
Santa Rosa police Sgt. Lisa Banayat
told the San Jose Mercury News,
adding that police "did not find any
thing consistent with foul play."
Authorities declined to comment
on the condition of the body. A final
determination for cause of death will
not be available until the investiga
tion has been completed by all in
volved agencies, including the Sono
ma County Coroner's Office.
An autopsy is scheduled for V a.m.
