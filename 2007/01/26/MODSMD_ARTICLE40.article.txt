# 'Sal's been gettin' a bad rap in Hollywood lately

### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION SOAP BONER 
People tell me I'm supposed to hate Berkeley.
But, to be honest, I haven't given it a mo
ment's notice since I started college. Cal is a
great school, and. regardless of my views on
bears (blood-thirsty fiends, thank you Mr. Col
bert). I think the rivalry between our schools is
childish, silly and an utter waste of energy.
Both are good institutions.
Hollywood disagrees.
Searching through the well-spring of all
human knowledge —Wikipedia— certain
shocking trends in movies concerning Berke
ley came to light. It is common knowledge that
the bear-worshiping campus is notorious for its
militant liberalism, botanical programs and an
indeterminate ire for "the Man." These con
ceptions are spread by the media. What my
search revealed, however, were subliminal
hints at what can only be described as a Holly
wood conspiracy to brainwash America into
believing that Berkeley is a bastion for — wait
for it — the seven deadly sins.

As with any good persuasive argument, 1
will need to cite evidence to prove this most
scandalous of claims. I'll start with the most
obvious sin, the one you sec everyday in
America: greed. In the 1995 masterpiece,
"Congo," a film about diamond-hoarding
monkeys (or apes, depending on whether or
not you subscribe to the theory of that
schmuck Darwin), early scenes of a university
campus are labeled as Berkeley. Granted,
these scenes were actually shot at UCLA, but
what Hollywood is trying to tell us that avari
cious pirate-scientists from Berkeley are pre
disposed to pillaging diamond-encrusted mon
keys to line their own pockets.
At another fictionalized version of Berke
ley, scientists wrap themselves in lab coats and
pride. They unlock "The Andromeda Strain,"
much to the chagrin of living tissue, and, as we
all know, the unlocking of any kind of super
virus does not lead to happiness and puppies.
It leads to boils and puss.
For the angriest sin of all, wrath, Holly
wood's vehicle turned out to be green and
poorly directed. Ang Lee's "Hulk" starts in a

lab on the Berkeley campus proper and pro
ceeds to rampage its way into the desert, quite
improperly. What America should have
gleaned from this film is that Berkeley is the
embodiment of rage, and it's certainly no coin
cidence that Hulk's body was green.
While it may seem counterintuitive to say
that sloth was the hardest sin for which to find a
cinematic example given the nature of Berke
ley's bountiful "gardens," this surprisingly
turned out to be the case. However, all I had to
do was check out film's ugly cousin, television,
to find a suitable inst;ince of lethargy, and boy
howdy did it deliver. "The OC" is filled with ab
solutely worthless and despicably unnecessary
people who sit around whining about how much
money they have. Some of them purportedly
graduated from Cal. 'Null said.
For my favorite sin of all, gluttony, Holly
wood targeted the college crowd with "Na
tional Lampoon's Van Wilder." The sly inser
tion of Sather Tower into "Van Wildcr's" cli
mactic courtroom scene makes a subtle point
of Van's fatuous presence on campus. Wilder
typifies the conspicuous consumption of alco

hoi. women and assorted "cream"-filled pas
tries of the gluttonous, self-made man. The
film's fictional college setting is merely a cover
— you're not fooling anyone, Hollywood; we
all know it's Cal.
An open and shut case for the sin of lust is
made by Sharon Stone's character in "Basic
Instinct." As a Berkeley graduate, Stone's
Catherine Tramell supposedly murders her
professor, but the world over knows her sim
ply for her methods of seduction. 1 can't
quite put my finger on it, but I would say that
Hollywood is trying to associate Berkeley
with a mean hankerin' for Ms. Stone. Despi
cable. Especially considering her role in
"Catwoman."
The seventh and final deadly sin Holly
wood films have pinned on our neighbors
across the Bay is, of course, envy. For this sin I
refer to our fearless Governator to provide a
suitable example. Like most of the other films
in this study of transgression, this one too was
cooked up in a test tube. A man with
impeccable (and possibly accidental)
comedic timing, Arnold
Schwarzenegger literally impreg-

nates himself in "Junior," a film shot
once again in a lab at Berkeley. The interesting thing about this
gender-bender is the fact that the fictional university in which the
physically impossible happens is called "Leland University" — a
clear reference to our alma mater. Now, I'm not one to adhere to
our juvenile rivalry, but it would seem to me that that cunning lit
tle reference implies that Berkeley scientists only wished they
could impregnate a man — a feat I predict Stanford scientists will
accomplish sometime in the near future, anatomy be damned.
So repent sinners and bear lovers, your time has come ... to a
theater near you!
