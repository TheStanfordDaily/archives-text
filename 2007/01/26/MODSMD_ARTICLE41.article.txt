## Got their vans on: The Pack debuts strong 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION SCRAPER 
Although Berkeley is admittedly lacking
in several aspects — quality universities and
places that don't smell like urine, to name a
few — something they do have is one of the
hottest rap groups in the Bay Area. The Pack,
an amalgamation of four Berkeley high
school students, is the new poster-group for
the next generation of self-proclaimed hyphy
artists to come out of the greater Bay Area in
the past year. Their hit song, "Vans," reached
number 23 on national hip-hop charts and was
named the #5 song of 2006 by Rolling Stone.
For the group's members, Young L, Stunna,
IJno and Lil B. all of whom range from 16 to
18 years old. that's quite an accomplishment.
Especially considering that all this success is
the result of a beat that was apparently con
structed in five minutes. Hustle and flow, any
one?
Legendary East Oakland rapper and pro
ducer Too Short, or so the story goes, heard
"Vans" on a friend's mix tape and embarked on

a Bay-wide search to find the quartet. They
were signed to his Jive records imprint, Up All
Nite. within a week.
"Vans" holds a special place among other
commercial hip-hop songs like Run DMC's
"My Adidas" and Nelly's "Air Force Ones."
All the publicity, however, is not without its
share of controversy. The Pack's denunciation
of Nikes is directly contrary to the previous
hyphy norm of "white tee, black jeans and
Nikes" established in 2004 by the Fairfield
hyphy conglomerate. The Federation. Conse
quently. the group has come under fire from fel
low artists. Drino Man. an Alameda emcee, im
mediately responded to the track with a song
entitled "Fuck Vans," which was, well, less than
positive.
Their debut EP, From Skateboards 2 Scrap
ers, isn't a bad album by any means. The seven
songs seem to add enough to flesh out the group
beyond the übiquitous "Got my vans on but
they look like sneakers."
The leadot'f track, the ever-popular "Vans,"
is without a doubt the best tune on the album.
It's infectious and a semi-departure from your

traditional macho posturing. The
song is basically all about Vans, what
sizes and colors each individual
member wears and how to wear
them. "Lace 'em past the fourth
hole, you some type of sucker."
Cult classics are a hard act to fol
low on any album, but especially on
this one. The next few tracks, "I'm
ShininY' "Ride My Bike" and
"Candy" are decent but not nearly up
to the same level. The hook, which pro
vides so much of the appeal for "Vans," is
painfully lacking. "Oh Go" and "Freaky Bop
per" are better, but the catchy quality that
haunts your sleep simply isn't there.
It's disappointing that with a vast library of
great material from previous albums, Wolfpack
Muzik Vols. 1 and 2, the group would select
these songs for its first widely released album.
"I'm a Boss," "Booty Bounce Bopper," "Ice
Creams," "Uno," "Blueberrys" and "Yes Sir"
are all vastly superior to the other tracks on this
album.
Personally, I was so pumped after I bought

the album at Best Buy in East Paly that I forgot
myself temporarily and almost blew out the tiny
subwoofer in my car. In terms of music, "Vans"
is phenomenal but some of the other tracks on
"Skateboards 2 Scrapers" are certainly forget
table. \\ &e very least, go listen to the single.
This albuifarriaiks a reassuring trend of sustain
ability within the hyphy movement itself, de
spite divisive tendencies, it's a great album to
have (especially when it's on sale).
Did Mac Dre wear vans? The jury is still out.
