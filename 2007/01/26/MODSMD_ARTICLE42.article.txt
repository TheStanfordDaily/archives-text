# East Bay punk: Two decades down...
## 
### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION PUNK 
B On Dec. 16 and 17 of 2006, East Bay punk legends Rancid
played the Warfield. For fans of the genre, the show was a meet
ling of the past, present and future of the Hast Bay scene. Young
East Bay punks Static Thought opened for Rancid in what may
be a glimpse of the future hut was at the same time recognition
of the past. Static Thought is striking in that they aren't new
sounding, hut instead recall their heroes. Rancid, and their pre
decessors. Operation Ivy. The headlining act itself was full of

I nostalgic songs and memories for a band pushing 20 years
together and with several albums to their name. Songs

I like "Journey to the End of the East Bay" recalled the
punk scene when Matt Freeman and Tim Armstrong
were growing up by telling the tale of their former band.
Operation Ivy.

I Old punks smiled as former frontman of Operation
Ivy, Jesse Michaels, stepped onstage. The future and
present relinquished the spotlight for a relic of the past

■ at that moment, for three original members of Oper
ation Ivy played the quintessential mobilization

■j
anthem "Unity." For punks, this is like Paul Mc-
ICartney calling John Lennon onstage.
While many people consider Rancid's San
Francisco two-night event with the Slackers to
be their homecoming shows, their home is ac-

tually across the bridge in the East Bay.
B The East Bay has continually produced
I some of the finest punk bands in the last 20
years. The "first wave" of American punk
largely originated in LA with bands like
Bad Religion, Black Flag and the Vandals.
The East Bay had its founding father in a
® way too: "East Bay Ray" of the Bay Area
_ punk group The Dead Kennedys was

there when it all began. 1 le s still around too, touring with a re
formed version of DK sans the original vocalist, Jello Biafra.
But the East Bay became known as a punk Mecca largely
based on the contributions of the second wave of punk and ska
music in the late 80s. Operation Ivy is often credited with revi
talizing the punk/ska scene of Berkeley; their album "Energy"
is considered one of the most influential punk albums of all
time.

Operation Ivy broke up in 1989; within days, a
band called Green Day was taking up the
I mantle of East Bay punk music. Green Day,
Rancid. Link 80. NOFX and the Mr. T Expe
rience all contributed to the vibrant East Bay
music scene. This "second wave" of punk gave
the genre and the East Bay scene a name. Hits

like Rancid's "... And out Come the Wolves"
and Green Day's "Dookie" gave the bands sig
nificant airtime on the radio and MTV.
Many groups afterward were considered

"third wave" and tended to change the sound
from its hardcore roots to be more poppy and
radio-friendly. During this era, bands like AFI

(who enjoyed a minimal following before
hand) and Blink-IS 2 became the faces of
punk to most audiences; many have derisive
ly referred to this brand of punk as false
"mallpunk."
Part of this resentment to mainstream suc
cess drew from the Do It Yourself (DIY) at-

titude that permeated the early punk scene.
This meant a rejection of social conven
tions, usually a radical critique of current
I politics and, above all else, a rejection of the
I consumerist music machine. This meant in
dependent labels for punks and by punks.
Many of these labels still exist today

and are rooted in the East Bay. Lookout! Records hails from I
Berkeley while Adeline Records, started by Billie Joe Arm-1
strong and his wife, still operates out of the East Bay.
Though Operation Ivy, American Steel, Redemption N7 and a
Link 80 are all gone, the East Bay Scene remains lively to this
day. Many of the elder statesmen of the punk scene, including |
Tim Armstrong and Billie Joe Armstrong (no relation), each I
has, in addition to still playing with the bands that made the I
scene what it is, started their independent labels and have ■
sought young talent to bolster the ranks. a
As the bands have changed, the home of East Bay punk has
changed as well. Many of the clubs and bars that were the ■
hotbeds for the raw unrest of the 80s are gone. However, places I
like the Stork Club and the historic 924 Gilman (which is non-1
profit and has a policy of not booking major label bands) helped ®
nurture the next generation of California punks. With shows
usually under $10, just about anyone can step in from the street
and enjoy the music. Many of these venues, including Gilman.
include policies of not only booking underground bands, but
bands that aren't homophobic, racist or sexist. The idea of
"unity" still exists today. '
While Rancid's performance at the Warfield served as a
bridge from the present and the past, where the future lies is un
certain. New bands like Static Thought are making a name for
themselves in the underground niche; these young punks (front
man Eric Urbach is only 17) have their premiere album on I im
Armstrong's Hellcat Records and have already drawn compar-1
isons to Rancid. These are lofty accolades for such a young
band. Part of why Static Thought is so promising is that they are
tapping into the energy and aggression of the previous genera
tion. rejecting mainstream pop-punk influences. By remaining
true to its roots, the East Bay punk scene may indeed be around
for another 20 years.
