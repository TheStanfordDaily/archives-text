## Beefcake: Yes, this really is at Cantor! 
### AMY STEINBERG INTERMISSION BEEFCAKE EXPERT 
You'd think that a collection of photographs featur- i
ing toned, young, handsome, athletic, striking (I could go
on ...) - not to mention naked - men would send most of
campus charging into Cantor. And maybe now that I've
let the cat out of the bag, they will. But viewers will be
sorely disappointed if an array of erotic poses of former
Stanford athletes is what they were expecting. Yes, some
are former Stanford athletes; some are 1950s San Fran
cisco body builders, but none of the images were taken
for the erotic pleasure of the scrutinizing public.
Simply look at the eyes - everybody knows seduction
and lust loom in the depths of the eyes and not the creas
es of the abs (okay, maybe not everybody knows that,
but it's the truth) - and you will see that there is some
thing much deeper, much more profoundly artistic in

these images. In fact, the eyes lit
erally reflect the artist, Dave
Martin, himself. In the few im
ages that do gaze back at the
viewers, such as "Dale Wesson"
(the only image with clothes) and
Randy Sanders (covered in net
ting), there is no indication of

ownership, of rapture or even of
playfulness. Furthermore, the re
mainders of the images that do not
show their eyes to the camera offer
no sense of humiliation; they exude
such indifference and confidence that
they could, in fact, be just as naturally

pictured wearing clothing.
So humor me for a little while when

1 say that it is not necessarily about sex, despite
the whisperings that these images and their correspond
ing fitness magazines validate an underground homoerot
ic culture of the 19505. At least these photographs are not
solely defined by the growing homoerotic movement, and
asking the question of whether the artist or models or in
tended viewers are homosexual is as entirely irrelevant as
asking whether the artist or models or intended audiences
are heterosexual. This is not to say that there were no ele
ments of sex that manifest from the conception of these im
ages and that the initiation of the movement wasn't ex
tremely significant, but there are other interpretations. So.
although our culture is inexplicably obsessed with the de
termination of gay versus straight. . . forget about it, at
least for a little while. After all, would this be the main dis
cussion in photographing current Stanford athletes in the

nude?
Instead, try looking at-the bodies as
shapes. They are beautiful, finely tuned
mechanisms of collected shapes that the
artist has manipulated into elegant photo
graphic composition. This geometric break
down essentially nullifies the absurd warning
for long-lost social decorum at the entry of the

gallery that reads, "Images in this gallery are not
suitable for young visitors." There is such an attention
to composition and dialogue between model and scenery
that one is not confronted with the nudity. For example,
"Wilber 'Bud' Counts" stands on the rocks jit the shore
with his body positioned in a scmi-backwaMarch. As a
result, his body becomes the wave that on^ : woukn?Xpect
from the encroaching ocean,
Also, "Roy Lang" proudly poses in front of the Gold
en Gate Bridge, which Suggests another underlying

theme in Dave Martin's photography. Perhaps he draws
on the parallel that this body - this combination of geo
graphic shapes and tension - is responsible for the feats
of humanity. We oftentimes forget that everything we
know is derived from and revolves around the corporeal
body. Its muscles, its organs, its microscopic blood cells -
this all is what conceived the Golden Gate Bridge. This
is quite a powerful concept to be able to capture within a
photograph, and. if for nothing else, Dave Martin should
be lauded for his incredibly strategic composition and
utilization of light and shadow to convey this idea.
As for the actual curating (the head curator is Stan
ford student Michele Kraus), 1 have to say, well done. It's
one thing to gather a collection, organize it and success
fully arrange it with the guidance of the artist, but to do
so while the artist breathes negative words about his own
work down your neck is another. The unadorned room.

terpretation of the "Beefcake" gallery. According to
someone else,' it could be totally and utterly wrong. In
