## Extreme case of deadly disease strikes man's genitals 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION REPORTER 
After returning from a recent trip to Las
Vegas. Nev., a man who wished to remain
anonymous (for obvious reasons) fell victim
to a peculiar affliction, which professionals
at the Stanford Hospital have positively
identified as Emasculitis. The doctors indi
cate that there has only been one other case
this severe — John Bobbit's 1992 encounter
with an eight-inch kitchen knife — but they
fear the possibility of the condition spread
ing to other males. The man's prognosis is
uncertain.
"I've never been so afraid in my life," said
the man. Emasculitis is a condition that has
only recently been seriously considered by psy
chologists and medical doctors, though it has
been documented for centuries. Strangely, the
disease only affects males in relationships.
Those affected suffer from a sudden loss of as
scrtiveness, a lowered gaze, the inability to
make decisions and a doused sex drive akin to
the impotence exhibited bv 80-year-old re
tirees. In certain cases. Emasculitis patients suf
fer a shrinkage in the testicular region. The first
documented case involved a man, a woman, an
apple and an argument over proper pruning
techniques. Throughout history, Emasculitis
has taken different forms and has been re
ferred to by various terms. Henpecked. Cuck
oled. Whipped. In every instance, the symp
toms have remained the same.
"We usually only see Emasculitis in older
couples," said the attendant at the ER. "[The
disease] almost never attacks with this severi
ty and swiftness in someone so young."
The case of Emasculitis in Las Vegas adds
a new wrinkle to this frightening condition.
Reports indicate that the Emasculitis was in
such an advanced stage that the man's testi
cles had atrophied to the size of raisins. Emer
gency medical technicians barely managed to

save him from a complete separation. Doctors
are still trying to ascertain the causes of this
bizarre case but have few leads. Reliable
sources report that the man was accompanied
throughout the weekend by five women, two
of which were turning 21.

Problems began as the beer started to flow
like wine. "A weekend trip to Vegas with five
women? That sounds amazing," joked the at
tending LMT. "just don't tell my wife." But
what is one man's Bacchanal is another's
nightmare. Shortly after midnight on the first
night, the women began exhibiting signs of ex
treme intoxication.
Dr. Henry Crane, leading psychologist and
social behavior analyst, describes the situation

that the man faced with an analogy to nature.
"The human female is much like the wilde
beest on the Serengeti. Normally, they travel
in small packs of three to live. Human males
can be considered as lions or another large
predatory mammal, if you'll pardon the con-

ccit. When the female drinks large quantities
of alcohol, usually in the form of fruity drinks,
she effectively becomes that wildebeest with
one game leg and a missing eye. The lion sees
easy prey. The man [from Vegas] unfortu
nately did not take into account the numbers.
Lions are not solitary hunters and the wilde
beest clearly outnumbered him."
Another suspected cause of Emasculitis
closely tied to female alcohol consumption is

the high-pitched squeals that issue forth from
inebriated women upon the occurrence of just
about anything. These frequencies are specif
ically attuned to the chemical composition of
testosterone, canceling out any male hormone
in the air to the ire of men and animals sensi
tive to higher frequencies alike.
"1 don't recall too much of the weekend,"
said the ball-busted man while recovering at
Stanford Hospital, "but 1 didn't have a thing
to drink."
Speculation in the case is rampant. The
man's own theory is that the Emasculitis set in
to full effect when the women he traveled with
insisted on his bringing a tie in order to adhere
to a strict high-end club's dress code. The man
was shocked when the women informed him
that "bring a tie" actually meant "bring nice
dress shoes, preferably in black or brown
leather, that don't look like sneakers but
aren't as dressy as what you would wear with
a tuxedo." The women interviewed said he
should have known better.
Perhaps the precipitating factor came
when the women insisted heeffeminize his be
havior so that the club's bouncer would allow
him through the doors.
Some close relatives believe that the man's
incapacitation was perhaps due to the atmos
phere of the city. A wretched hive of scum and
villainy. Las Vegas has been advertised as a
lockbox of incriminating behavior, but this
time it seems that what happened in Vegas has
not stayed there.
If you or anyone you know is affected by
Emasculitis, there is hope. Studies have
shown that long stints of watching football
and eating large slabs of red meat have re
versed the effects of Emasculitis. The disease
may be incurable but the symptoms can be
minimized. Men with the condition should be
avoided by other men until testosterone levels
have returned to normal.
