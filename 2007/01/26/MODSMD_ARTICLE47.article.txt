# Tropical Paradise: Good price, decent Ghanaian
## 
### FAMIA AKUA NKANSA INTERMISSION PUNCH COMMENTATOR 
Tropical Paradise, in due testament to its name, is a dif
ficult place to absolutely dislike. It's a Ghanaian restaurant
dedicated to evoking nostalgia among those who might
have visited West Africa once, liked ihe food and had it so
long ago they have a fairly generic idea of what it's sup
posed to taste like. Its menu is like its geographically am
biguous moniker: easy, running the very short gamut from
jollof rice and chichinga with black-eyed peas and spinach,
to fufu and goat light soup, to kenkcy and red-red. The
restaurant capitalizes on the small, tight space to lend it a

shabby elegance and on the dedicated service to make you
feel at home.
If you're in a small party, you'll feel very attended to. If
you're in a large party, you'll fill up the restaurant. Either
way, because of its 30-customer capacity, it's hard to be ig
nored. The meals have the kind of "just-so spiciness" you
wouid like if you were American, grudgingly accept if you
had heritage from the continent or the Caribbean and be
moan if you were from Idaho. The salmon and fried plan
tains have hints of ginger, the black-eyed peas and spinach
— like all easy Ghanaian food — a little bit of pepper and
a little bit of nil. Tropical Paradise, for all its global charm
and Caribbean suggestiveness is priced fairly like a typical
African restaurant — on the high end of cheap — charging

between $10-15 for a non-vegetarian entree and about $6- I
7 for a side order of plantains or spinach.
To its credit, though, the portions are large, and if you I
smile at the owner just right you might get some tropical
punch at the house's expense. It packs a punch, although I
not quite the kind you'd like ... it's flavored with citrus and ®
cinnamon rather than with vodka and pineapple syrup. But I
like the restaurant itself, it's nice, benign, has a hint of kick 1
to it. If you've either just really missed Ghana and will set- ■
tie for a cheap trip back or have what you think are high ex- |
pectations for international food (so long as it doesn't ■
make you end up fanning your mouth and feeling slightly |
mocked by your ignorance). Tropical Paradise should -
make for a satisfying night out.
