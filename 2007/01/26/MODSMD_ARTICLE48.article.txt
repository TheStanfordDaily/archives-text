## 'HISSING FAUNA'A STRANGE TRIP 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION RESIDENT CANADIAN 
I Kevin Barnes of Of Montreal is a weird genius. When I

saw him in concert, I was shocked by his outfit, which fea
tured mascara and some incredible pink boots. And his
band's newest album, "Hissing Fauna, Are You the
Destroyer?," is extremely strange, but in a good way, '
despite the album's weak spots.
"Hissing Fauna" is a very personal, autobiographi- ■
cal work from Barnes, a change from previous Of Mon
treal releases that weaved fanciful, crazy stories. "Hiss
ing Fauna" moves from emotion to emotion with
Barnes moving from depression to elation and back to
depression between songs. But despite the album's
personal style, the disc is often not intimate. Instead,
the album, except for a few very good songs, leaves the
listener strangely disconnected with the music.

I It starts off well with "Suffer for Passion " a cheery pop
Isong that starts with a baby happily squealing. "I know we

suffer for passion ... we don't want to these days to ever
end," Barnes cries. The song, full of guitars, drums and a
synthesizer, is so full of frenetic energy that it seems it could
easily trigger an epileptic fit.

A few songs later, "Heimdalsgate like a
Promethean Curse" deals with the singer's drug use.
Accordingly, the song shifts from highs to lows in a sug
ary, sticky mess. At the beginning, the tune is darker,
but the song soon shifts into a hook-laden chorus of
"Come on chemicals/Come on chemicals/Come on
chemicals," which fittingly captures the dynamic high
and low cycle of drug use.

I But the next several songs, except for "The Past Is a
Grotesque Animal," are fairly formulaic and boring. These

I tracks, like "A Sentence of Sorts in Kongsvinger" and "Faberge

Falls for Shuggie," are sadly unoriginal, pedestrian songs. They all feature slick electron
ic bass plucking and Barnes's smooth lyrics, but this formula only works

so many times. The reality is that the titles, such as "Gronlandic
Exit," are the most creative part of these.

However, the album's centerpiece, "The Past Is A
Grotesque Animal," sparkles with creativity. It starts off with
a synthesized science fiction-esque sound, which comes off
as utterly different from the rest of the album. The lyrics are
both strangely provocative and erudite: "The past is a
grotesque animal, and in its eyes you see how completely
wrong you can be... The sun is out/It melts the snow/It
makes you wonder/Why it bothered?... 1 fell in love with the
first cute girl I met/Who could appreciate Georges Bataille."
It's a great track, full of original metaphors and wordplay,
with a sort of spoken poetry feel: "At least I authored my
own disaster... Somehow you Red Rovered the Gestapo
circling my heart."
"Labrinthian Pomp" shows much potential, start-

ing off rather playfully with feisty opening lyrics in an inimitable

v J J r © -J -
falsetto: "How you want to take my style/I am so superior/How
you want to hate a thing/when you are so inferior?" The song
plays to Barnes' strengths, but two-thirds into it, it devolves into
a slow, electric bass mess. ilHririna^^

"Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer" doesn't have any
"bad" songs. But there's just something missing from it. I'm
not entirely sure what that is, but I think it's Barnes' sense of
fun that was so conspicuous in his previous efforts, like "Sa
tanic Panic in the Attic." Where's the passion that was so ob
vious in "Chrissy Kiss the Corpse" or the rollicking tongue
in-cheek fun of "Tim 1 Wish You Were Born a Girl"?
However, the album is certainly worth its price. Despite its

inconsistencies, "Hissing Fauna" features something for both
fans and new listeners alike. And if you like it, you can see
them live on Feb. 1,2 and 3 when they come to San Francisco.

Just be ready for those boots.
