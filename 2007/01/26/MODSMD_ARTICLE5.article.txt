## Endowment grows by $1.8 billion 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's endowment surged in
value by 15.4 percent, or $1.8 billion, last
year, according to numbers released by
the National Association of College and
University Business Officers
(NACUBO) this week.The growth solid
ified Stanford's position as the university
with the third largest endowment, with
$14.1 billion, behind onlv Harvard and
Yale.
"SMC [The Stanford Management
Company] has done ;i really exceptional
job in their asset allocation and selection
of investment areas." said University
Chief Financial Officer Randall Liv
ingston. referring to the division of Stan
ford responsible for the endowment.

Last June, after a six-year tenure.
Michael McCaffery left SMC to found a
private company — Markena Capital
which does similar endowment-style in
vesting. He was replaced as president
and chief executive officer by John Pow
ers. a well-respected, proven investment
strategist who earned his MBA at the
Graduate School of Business.
"It's a little bit early to judge John be
cause he just took over last June and
these numbers are only through August,"
Livingston said. "Really the investment
returns for fiscal year 2006 are attributa
ble to McCaffery and the leadership
team that was there."
Powers, who has been at the helm for
nearly seven months, welcomed the re
sults.
"Obviously the returns over the last

couple of years are a phenomenal testi
mony to the quality of the portfolio that
McCaffery and his team built." he said
Wednesday. "It's a stable, long-horizon
portfolio."
While many institutional investors
frequently turn over holdings, endow
ments like Stanford's are noteworthy for
the long-term nature of their invest
ments. For SMC. the focus has been on
long-run. diversified investing. This pa
tience has proved a virtue for Powers and
his predecessor.
"Any decision plays out over a couple
years to 10 years or more," Livingston
said.
The endowment's investment returns
were close to $2.2 billion last fiscal year.
according to Livingston, lie said
about $534 million of the endow
ment was spent to support Universi
ty operations. A year of strong
fundraising — partly attributable
to the kickoff of the Stanford Chal
lenge meant that about $250 million
in new gifts became available for in
vestment. Approximately $290 mil
lion in additional funds were trans
ferred from reserves and expend
able funds.
"The strong growth of the en
dowment is translating into in
creased support for faculty and fi
nancial aid,"Livingston said."lt has
been very beneficial."
Powers warned that the endow
ment will not necessarily always
generate such high returns.
"The number of years you're
going to hit on all cylinders is going
to be pretty small." he said. "You'd
only have to go back to the early
2000s when the endowment was
struggling to keep its head above
water" after the tech bubble burst.
The old adage that it takes
money to make money holds in the
world of institutional investing. In
vestments pools of greater than $1
billion outperformed those be

tween $500 million and $1 billion by
1.6 percent annually over 10 years.
"They're able to devote more re
sources to management and selec
tion of outside managers." said
Matthew Hamill. the senior vice
president of NACUBO.
Powers sees Stanford's large en
dowment as an opportunity to gain
leverage and market clout.
"Stanford and other great univer
sities have brand names and have a
chance to invest with the best man

agers out there," he said."l'd say that
is an important part of Stanford's
ability to generate the returns."
The average one-year invest
ment return for higher education
endowments was 10.7 percent last
year, according to data released by
NACUBO in conjunction with
TIAA-CREF, a financial services
company.
The University of California's
endowment grew by just less than
10 percent to $5.7 billion, the eighth
largest. Harvard's endowment is
valued at $28.9 billion, more than
twice as much as Stanford's.
"The biggest thing we see is that
there wasn't a shakeup on how in
vestors are managing their portfo
lios," Hamill said. "By relatively
small increments, institutions are
further diversifying their portfolios
out of stocks and bonds and into an
alternative mix of investments, from
natural resources to hedge funds."
That is true at Stanford as well,
where investments in private equity
funds, natural resources and real es
tate have helped the endowment
nearly double since 2000.
Stanford has long heavily
weighted itself on international in
vestments.
"The last year was a really strong
tilt to the international markets,"
Powers said. "That was a really big
part of what pushed Stanford into
the top echelons."
