## Endowment grows by $1.8 billion 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's endowment surged in
value by 15.4 percent, or $1.8 billion, last
year, according to numbers released by
the National Association of College and
University Business Officers
(NACUBO) this week.The growth solid
ified Stanford's position as the university
with the third largest endowment, with
$14.1 billion, behind onlv Harvard and
Yale.
"SMC [The Stanford Management
Company] has done ;i really exceptional
job in their asset allocation and selection
of investment areas." said University
Chief Financial Officer Randall Liv
ingston. referring to the division of Stan
ford responsible for the endowment.

Last June, after a six-year tenure.
Michael McCaffery left SMC to found a
private company â€” Markena Capital
which does similar endowment-style in
vesting. He was replaced as president
and chief executive officer by John Pow
ers. a well-respected, proven investment
strategist who earned his MBA at the
Graduate School of Business.
"It's a little bit early to judge John be
cause he just took over last June and
these numbers are only through August,"
Livingston said. "Really the investment
returns for fiscal year 2006 are attributa
ble to McCaffery and the leadership
team that was there."
Powers, who has been at the helm for
nearly seven months, welcomed the re
sults.
"Obviously the returns over the last

couple of years are a phenomenal testi
mony to the quality of the portfolio that
McCaffery and his team built." he said
Wednesday. "It's a stable, long-horizon
portfolio."
While many institutional investors
frequently turn over holdings, endow
ments like Stanford's are noteworthy for
the long-term nature of their invest
ments. For SMC. the focus has been on
long-run. diversified investing. This pa
tience has proved a virtue for Powers and
his predecessor.
"Any decision plays out over a couple
years to 10 years or more," Livingston
said.
The endowment's investment returns
were close to $2.2 billion last fiscal year.
