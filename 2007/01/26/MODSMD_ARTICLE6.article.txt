## Israel misuses Holocaust, Finkelstein insists 
### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
Controversial historian Norman F inkel
stein argued in front of a packed and bois
terous Cubberly Auditorium crowd last
night the disputed assertion that Israel uses
the Holocaust as a shield against criticism.
The event, co-sponsored by Students Con
fronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAD, the
Coalition for Justice in the Middle Hast
(CJMH) and the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
was the subject of criticism throughout the
week and during the talk itself for "polariz

ing" campus debate on the Israel-Palestine
question.
Finkelstein spoke before an audience
consisting mostly of community members,
but with scattered students and even a cam
erawoman from the San Jose community
group Justice for Palestinians, who was 112 ilm
ing the talk for a later broadcast on ArabTV
15.
The audience was largely sympathetic to
Finkelstein's position, bursting into fre
quent applause and laughter and giving a
standing ovation at the conclusion of the
speech. A small but vocal minority, howev

er, expressed dissent, ami linkelstein en
gaged in several shouting i xchanges with
audience members.
The embattled DePaul IJniveisity po
litical science professor addressed the Is
rael-Palestinian conflict and potential so
lutions as well as Israel's human rights
record. All of these topics, he alleged, were
"not controversial." based on his research
into World Court decisions, human rights
organizations and UN General Assembly
votes.
