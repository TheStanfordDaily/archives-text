## Israel misuses Holocaust, Finkelstein insists 
### SINI MATIKAINEN STAFF WRITER 
Controversial historian Norman F inkel
stein argued in front of a packed and bois
terous Cubberly Auditorium crowd last
night the disputed assertion that Israel uses
the Holocaust as a shield against criticism.
The event, co-sponsored by Students Con
fronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAD, the
Coalition for Justice in the Middle Hast
(CJMH) and the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
was the subject of criticism throughout the
week and during the talk itself for "polariz

ing" campus debate on the Israel-Palestine
question.
Finkelstein spoke before an audience
consisting mostly of community members,
but with scattered students and even a cam
erawoman from the San Jose community
group Justice for Palestinians, who was 112 ilm
ing the talk for a later broadcast on ArabTV
15.
The audience was largely sympathetic to
Finkelstein's position, bursting into fre
quent applause and laughter and giving a
standing ovation at the conclusion of the
speech. A small but vocal minority, howev

er, expressed dissent, ami linkelstein en
gaged in several shouting i xchanges with
audience members.
The embattled DePaul IJniveisity po
litical science professor addressed the Is
rael-Palestinian conflict and potential so
lutions as well as Israel's human rights
record. All of these topics, he alleged, were
"not controversial." based on his research
into World Court decisions, human rights
organizations and UN General Assembly
votes.

Norman Finkelstein, son of Holocaust survivors and author of the recent book "Holocaust Indus
try," addressed a packed crowd in Cubberley Auditorium last night.
"In the highest judicial body in
the world, there is no dissent, no de
bate. no dispute," he said, regarding
what he termed the illegality of the
Israeli occupation of Gaza and the
West Bank.
"The core of my remarks today
bears the question of why there is a
controversy surrounding something
which, if you look at historical
record, contemporary record, and
the record of past. present and future
conflict, is not very controversial at
all." Finkelstein said.
"Most of the controversy that
swirls around the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is contrived, fabricated, con
cocted." he added. "The purpose of
this artificial controversy is to divert
attention from documentary record
and sew confusion about what
record actually shows."
This statement met with derisive
laughter from a member of the audi
ence.
Finkelstein went on to allege
that Israelis have utilized the Holo
caust in their efforts to "mystify"
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and
to prevent critics from passing
judgment on it or comparing it to
what he deemed analogous situa
tions.
"It's not perfect, but you could
make a reasonable analogy between
the fate of Native Americans in
North America and the fate of Pales
tinians in the Zionist conquest of
Palestine," he said. "The problem is
that Israel comes out on the wrong
side of the analogy, so we don't com
pare it."
During the question-and-answer
session, audience dissatisfaction was
particularly voluble. Several audi
ence members were upset with being

forced to write their questions on
notecards instead of engaging in an
open forum.
Finkelstein himself disagreed
with this method of audience partic
ipation.
"Had 1 been asked. I would have
done it that way," Finkelstein
replied. "But I had to respect the
wish of the organizers. I have faith
that the professor will not make this
a rigged session."
SCAI members ostensibly at
tempted to limit audience outbursts
by passing out notecards and signal
ing that they should write their ques
tions down. Many audience mem
bers left before the two-and-a-half
hour event was over, either directly
after the speech or during the Q& A
â€” some visibly dissatisfied or upset.
One woman loudly compared
Finkelstein to a "wind-up toy" as she
moved into the aisle.
Though criticism during the
speech came from community mem
bers, some students also expressed
displeasure afterward, arguing that
Finkelstein s inflammatory rhetoric
detracted from constructive campus
dialogue.
"1 think no informed Jew would
claim that Israel shields itself from
criticism," said sophomore Andrew
Flinch, vice president of the Jewish
Student Association. "It's unfortu
nate that they [SCAI] use polarizing
speakers like this who make rational
discussion difficult. Finkelstein over
simplifies in a way that doesn't en
courage debate or help solve prob
lems."
"I think the selectiveness of the
facts he used was very academically
irresponsible," agreed senior Jeremy
Newman.
But others said they enjoyed the
controversial speaker's presenta
tion.
"1 loved it." said sophomore Jessi
ca Cornwell. "1 thought it was very
enlightening and balanced."
