## Energy Bowl kicks off Seeks to reduce energy use. water consumption 
### HEATHER HEISTAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During last year's Great Annual
Energ} Bowl and Water Derby, un
dergraduate dorms cut hack 150,000
kilowatt hours of electricity and 1.2
million gallons of water compared to
the year before, saving the University
$22,(XX).
In the third annual competition,
themed "Sav ing It For You."sponsors
Students for Sustainable Stanford
and Student 1 lousing aim to improve
on last year's 10 percent energy re
duction in campus-wide undergradu
ate housing.
"A lot of students get into it,"
Larry 1 loffman, housing energy man
agement coordinator, said. "Statistics
like the 10 percent decrease [in total
dorm energy consumption] have
shown that there are students really
trying to cut back."
Hie competition has two cate
gories. one for large dorms and a sec
ond tor Row and cluster houses. The
residence with the greatest percent
age reduction in energy and water
will win organic cotton "Energy
Bowl" t-shirts and either Energy Star

refrigerators or solar panel-powered
hot water heaters — appliances
which use less energy and will theo
retically give next year's competitors
an advantage.
Senior Emma Yuen, president of
Students for Sustainable Stanford,
suggested that would-be competitors
go beyond traditional energy conser
vation methods like turning off lights
and computers. She advised unplug
ging unused appliances, using a dorm
refrigerator instead of a personal one
and opening curtains during the day
rather than using overhead lights.
Last year's dorm winner. Fresh
man-Sophomore College (FroSo-
Co), cut back their winter quarter
power usage by almost 25 percent
compared to the previous year. But
some residents from the dorm sug
gested that it might have been more a
matter of luck than conservation ef
forts.
"To be perfectly honest, I'm not
sure if anyone was even aware of the
competition," said Zach Nevin. a
sophomore in FroSoCo. "For certain,
even if something had been men
tioned in an email earlier last year, by
the time we were announced as the
winning dorm, the vast majority of us
didn't remember there had been a
competition, not that anyone would
begrudge another free t-shirt."
l ie added that this year's residents

don't seem to
be doing any
thing differently.

Yuen said
while she doesn't
expect everyone
to participate, she

hopes that the derby will *
grow more successful as it
becomes part a of Stanford tradition.
Yuen cited dorm pride as an im
portant motivational tool for the
competition.
"In some houses people are taking
pledges to reduce energy, and there
are even sub-competitions in houses
to see who can take really fast show
ers." she said. "Last year the Theta
Delt fraternity tried very hard to win
because they were a unified, proud
and determined house — and they
did great in the competition."
She said she expects mid-competi
tion results posted in February to in
tensify dorms' bids to win. and she
has faith that students can improve
on last year's mark.
"Hopefully films like 'An Incon
venient Truth' will tie into the Ener
gy Bowl to make people aware that
they are going to have to change
their habits sooner or later to ad
dress the enormous environmental
problems we all face." Yuen said.
"The Energy Bowl is a convenient
way to start saving."
