Stanford alumnus and Tony Award-winning play
wright David I lenry I hvang'79 will kick off a partnership
between Stanford and the New York Public Theater by
conducting a residency on campus starting in February,
University officials announced Monday.
Hwang has high hopes for his residency at Stanford.
" I hope tii use my time at Stanford to continue rewrit
ing and reworking my new play,' Yellow Face,' in prepa
ration for its upcoming productions in Los Angeles and
New York," Hwang said.
11 wang's residency will give students and community
members the opportunity to witness an internationally
renowned playwright at work.
"Being able to work with and learn from a celebrated
playwright is not only an exciting opportunity for student
performers and writers, but is also important in fostering
a dynamic arts community on campus." said sophomore
Grace Mandler, who performed in Ram's Head Theatri
cal Society's Winter One-Acts this year.
" Hie idea here is to rethink the relationship between
the I niversity and the arts, so that the University be
comes a patron, supporter and incubator of the arts,"
Drama Department Chair Harry Elam Jr. said.
In addition to the residency program, the partnership
will offer a fellowship program for students which will in
clude post-graduate internships at the Public Theater.
Elam said. ITiis year's fellows will be chosen in May.
The Stanford Initiative for Creativity and the Arts is
funding the program and will seek to establish relation
ships with local theaters in the future, but Elam called the
partnership with faraway New York Public Theater a
good move for the University.
"The Arts Initiative is pursuing a relationship with

San Francisco Opera, but the rationale for the Public
Theater is its reputation and connections between the
ater officials and Stanford faculty," Elam said.
Hwang's residency is just one of several arts events set
to occur on campus in the next few months.
"This is part of a larger series of artist residencies that
are going on at Stanford, which include residencies with
poets, artists, pianists and percussionists," Robert Cable,
public relations manager for Stanford Lively Arts. said.
"We are just awash with artist residencies at the mo
ment."
This year's residency program will include a discus
sion between Hwang and visiting drama professor Stan
Lai, whom Elam characterized as "one of the most well
known playwrights in contemporary Asia."
Sophomore Kenneth Lam. who performed in the
Original Winter One-Acts, said he is enjoying working
with Lai on his play "Secret Love in Peach Blossom
Land." which will be performed on campus later this
quarter.
"It's been pleasant working with an Asian director,"
Lam said. "I 've been acting for a while, and this is the first
time I've been in a role that was written acknowledging
my race."
Many of I Iwang's plays focus on issues of race in soci
ety.
"'Yellow Face'" is a comedy about mistaken racial
identity, which blends truth and fiction to ask how much
of our lives and self-perception is 'real' and how much are
fictions which eventually become our truths," Hwang
said of the play he will workshop at Stanford before it
opens in Los Angeles in May.
Hwang has been using drama to explore his ethnic
roots since his undergraduate years at Stanford, when he
formed the Asian American Theater Project and per
formed his first play.
"Since my very first play,'FOÃŸ,' was written to be per
formed in the lounge at Okada I louse. I have had some
experience premiering new work at Stanford." Hwang
said, "so it is incredibly serendipitous for me to do so
attain."
