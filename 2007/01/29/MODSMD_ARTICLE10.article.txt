## New humanities fund announced Senate also approves permanent weeklong Thanksgiving break 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Faculty Senate members were all smiles last Thursday
after President John Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendv announced that the University plans to make
additional funding available for academic research in the
humanities.
ITie announcement for the new funding came shortly
after the Faculty Senate almost unanimously passed a res
olution to institutionalize the weeklong Thanksgiving
break that students have enjoyed for the last two years.
Speaking before almost 70 faculty and administrators.
I iennessy announced the creation of the Presidential Inno
vation Fund for the Humanities — which, he said, would
provide faculty in undergraduate humanities with $5,000
research awards. To be eligible for the new grants, faculty
will submit proposals for humanities research, which will be
awarded research funds after passing through committee
review.
Etchemendv similarly unveiled an award fund for excel
lence in undergraduate teaching: the fund has an endow
ment of $2 million. The University, he said, will look to re
ward professors who make contributions to pedagogical in
novation at the undergraduate level. He added that the
awards would be available after consulting with the Under
graduate Advising Council.
"Both announcements demonstrate the University's
broader commitment to improving the quality of under
graduate instruction and research." Etchemendv said.
The announcements for the new humanities research
grants and the funding for undergraduate teaching excel

lence followed the popular resolution to preserve the
weeklong Thanksgiving break. The scheduling modifica
tion would ensure that each quarter lasts 10 weeks and
would guarantee that finals be held on a Monday through
Friday schedule.
The Faculty Senate also considered the widening per
formance divide between American ;ind foreign fourth and
fifth gruders. Kenji I lakuta. dean of social sciences at UC-
Merced. presented his findings on the glaring inadequacies
in k-12 education in the United States and discussed the
progress that Stanford has made to address these concerns.
ASSU President Elizabeth Heng, a senior, voiced her
support for the University's efforts to contribute to K-12
education.
"From a student's perspective, there isa lot of interest in
supporting this cause," she said. "Not a week goes by that 1
don't see an e-mail in my inbox from students who are tak
ing the initiative to volunteer at schools in places like East
Palo Alto. It says something that there are schools right
next door to a university like Stanford that can't even meet
statewide performance standards."
While the Faculty Senate addressed a number of aca
demic issues in the meeting.it did not consider the addition
of an interdisciplinary program in Public Policy that would
add two new graduate degrees — a two-year Masters in
Public Policy (MPP) and a one-year Master of Arts in Pub
lic Policy (MAPP).
The proposal, which h;is been criticized by some stu
dents because it does not create new faculty positions for
Public Policy and would not initially offer a co-terminal
program, was originally planned to be introduced at the
Faculty Senate meeting. Public Policy Director Bruce
Owen said.
Owen told The Daily, however, that the graduate pro
gram proposal was not introduced at the meeting because
of an absence in the registrar's office.
"Due to the illness of a staffer in
the registrar's office," he said, "the
MPP did not get onto the agenda."
Owen said that consideration for
the graduate programs would be de
layed until one of the next two Facul
ty Senate meetings, on either Feb. 8 or
Feb. 22.

Prof. Russel Fernald expressed con
cern that student diversity in graduate
education was slipping. I le called for

data concerning the University's abil
ity to recruit and retain minority grad
uate students.
"Are there ways that we're men
toring students to understand what an
academic career is like?" he asked.
"We know what our advisees are
doing, but 1 don't think there's a col
lective wisdom about what we're
doing to attract underrepresented mi
norities to our graduate programs."
Senate members resolved to ad
dress graduate student diversity in an
upcoming meeting. Senate business
was adjourned following announce
ment of an upcoming panel discussion
on ethics, a longitudinal study on writ
ing and a discussion on the status of
female faculty.
