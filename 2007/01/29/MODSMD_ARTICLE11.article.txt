## Editorial Board Reforming the honors system 
### 
Compared to its top competitors Har
vard and Yale. Stanford awards rela
tively egalitarian honors programs at
graduation. Harvard, for example, has both
"Latin" honors, like magna cum laude. and
English" honors, like High Honors. Yale
has three tiers of" Latin " honors as well as a
separate "Distinction in the Major. Stan
ford. in contrast, awards only two distinc
tions. "Bachelor s Degree with Distinc
tion." for the overall top 15 percent of stu
dents with the highest grade-point average
and Honors." for those who complete a
satisfactory thesis.
Excessive stratification does not seem to
benefit either students or their prospective
employers. Law schools, medical schools. 1-
banking firms and the like care far more
about the actual numerical GPA than what
Latin term is attached to it. according to the
C areer Development ( enter Moreover, it
is difficult at a high-achieving school like
Stanford to argue that a distinction needs to
be made between someone in the top 5 per
cent and the top 10 percent. The highly -
stratified system at other schools would also
seem to incentivize "grade consciousness"
and competition, aspects that the Stanford
academic culture, compared to Harvard
and Yale, thankfully lacks.
To reward the cohort of students that do
exceptionally well, some honors system
does need to exist. And Stanford does have
two different systems — overall GPA. and
the completion of a thesis. Awarding Hon
ors simply for completing a thesis, however,
does not represent the right spirit of either
the thesis-writing experience or rewarding
overall academic achievement at Stanford.
About 25 percent of each class chooses to
write a thesis in senior vear. and while manv

write the thesis purely for the opportunity
to write a long and very focused researched
academic paper, the appellation of honors
for completing it is certainly a strong incen
tive as well.
The experience of writing a thesis should
be separated from honors. Many students
do very well in their classes and have a very
high GPA. yet choose not to write a thesis
for whatever reason: a time-intensive in
ternship. research at a lab or leadership in
an organization. It is hard to argue that
those students who write a satisfactory the
sis automatically deserve honors while
those students who simply do not write do
not deserve it.
Students should write a thesis purely for
the experience it provides. D<Ktorate pro
grams, for one.certainly want their students
to engage in original research. However,
honors should be about overall academic
achievement across all four years and in dif
ferent disciplines. Most schools, both the
top tier and others, reward performance
both overall and inside the major, the latter
often with faculty input. Stanford should
adopt a program similar to that: students
who are exceptionally proficient in many
fields will be rewarded for their efforts, as
they currently are.and those who are excep
tional inside their major will also be recog
nized. This frees the thesis to be a work of
pure academic love.
Reform of the honors sy stem at Stanford
will lead to a greater appreciation both of
what it means to write a thesis and what it
means to do exceptionally well in class. But
as long as we do so without the excessive
stratification found at other schools, we can
maintain Stanford's unique academic cul
ture.
