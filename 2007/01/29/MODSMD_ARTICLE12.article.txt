# Hands off South America

What happened to America's covert
coup-makers? If Latin America's
current populist/socialist hiccup
were taking place a generation ago, we
would he stuffing that hemisphere so full of
Pinochets that human rights groups would
have to take their eyes off that little slice of
Cuba we use for the devil knows what.
Mary Anastasia O'Grady's weekly col
umn in ("he Wall Street Journal takes Latin
American politics and politicians and tries
to show its readers where our neighbors to
the south are currently drifting. Lately her
entries have read like a more self-aware ver
sion of journalist John Reed's " Ten Days
That Shook the World," the classic first-per
son account of the triumph of Bolshevism in
Russia. Last week. Ms O'Grady observed
that Lcuador's recently sworn-in President
Correa has joined the chorus of "no a los
yanquis" that drives the Hugo ( havez/lidel
("astro fan club, or, as it is formally known,
the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americ
as. Who are the members and member
wannabes of this illustrious organization?
Naturally, the ever self-appreciatory
Venezuelan President Chavez is with Mr.
Castro at the helm, and they are joined by
Bolivia's Lvo Morales, who recently spat in
Washington's eye by promising to give more
muscle to Bolivian cocaine production.
Mr. Morales is also in the news this week
because Juan ( arlos ()rtiz. his appointee at
the head ol Bolivia's recently nationalized
natural gas company, resigned on Saturday.
Tins marks the departure of the second en
ergy chief in less than a year. While Bolivia
and Venezuela the two largest holders of
gas reserves in South America — may be
natural partners in energy autarky.the pres
ence of their leaders at the inaugural festiv
ities of Mr. Correa serves as an important
reminder that Latin America's anti-U.S.
strongmen are eager to expand their coali
tion. So eager, evidently, that they were will
ing to humor the broken record of "histori
cal" inquiries about the reality of the I lolo
caust from Iranian President Mahmoud Ah
madinejad, who was also in attendance at
the swearing-in ceremony.
While Ms. ()'(irady has been pointing to
the gathering clouds of communism on the
Latin American horizon, one threat to U.S.
interests certainly exists in the here and
now. Venezuela, which is dependent on the
capital that comes from its #1 importer (the
I J.S.), nevertheless can make life difficult for
Washington and Wall Street by injecting
bursts of uncertainty into energy markets.
In a report lor the ( ouncil on F-'oreign Rela

tions last November, Richard Lapper re
marked that Venezuela's state oil company
has been busily renegotiating terms of trade
with the U.S. and that recent changes ex
empt ( aracas from filing with Washington's
Securities and Lxchange ( ommission.
Ibe inevitable failings in transparency
that will result from such exemptions in
crease the unpredictability not merely of
Venezuela's production, but of energy mar
kets as a whole. From the point of view of
the market, the most worrisome part of Mr.
Lapper's report is in his account that, "on
several occasions, [Chavez] has threatened
to stop shipments of Venezuelan oil to the
United States or close Venezuelan-owned
refineries in U.S. territory." In the early
19605, such threatened and actual disrup
tion of the U.S. economy by Castro's Cuba
predicated an aggressive policy culminating
in the humiliation of the failed Bay of Pigs
invasion. Chavez, who recently announced
plans to nationalize telecommunications, is
not Castro, just as ('ingular is not Lxxon.but
it seems that something has indeed changed
since the days of I isenhower. Kennedy and
Kissinger regarding U.S. policy with the
southern hemisphere.
111 any case, as |< >ng as the I J.S.'s friends in
the Saudi Oil Ministry plan to keep the mar
kets competitive (an intention they an
nounccd yesterday), the potential of the
Chavez regime to deliver oil shocks will be
greatly reduced. Is this the going wisdom on
Latin America's populists— that they can
say what they want as long as their influence
in the energy sector is kept in check? Mas
the CIA. sometime in the last few decades,
learned that the coup is not a delicate tool
but a blunt object? ()r are we simply waiting
for an over-eager Pat Robertson to do our
assassinations for us? ()nly time will tell, for
at this writing, it cannot be predicted
whether or where the populist wave in Latin
America, which has not yet crested, is
bound to break.
