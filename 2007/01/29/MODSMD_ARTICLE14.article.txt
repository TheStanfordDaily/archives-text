# Breaking up is hard to do
## 
### 
I think I 'm breaking up with Facebook. I
know. 1 know. I've said this before. I've
even physically blocked Facebook from
my computer because I wanted to be finally
done with it.(I actually had to do a Google
search on parental controls, and all of the re
sults pointed out that an astute child would
easily be able to overcome the barriers. You
know what. Google? Sometimes you're just
try ing to protect yourself.)
But my self-imposed hiatus didn't last
very long, because I was getting desperate to
know if anyone had sent me a Facebook mes
sage. Except I wanted to know more or less
every five minutes, and it was getting so tiring
to enable and disable the controls, so it was
really more time efficient to leave the con
trols off. 1 mean, what if someone sent me a
message saying "HELP I AM DYING SIN I
CALL9I l"and I waited 10 minutes between
checking messages? Their death would be
onmy conscience.
I also resolved to quit in righteous indig
nation after the new stalker features were in
stalled, but that didn't work out either.
My problem was partly that it was an inva
sion of privacy, but more importantly. I didn't
necessarily want people to know about my
borderline pathological tendencies.
For instance, and I don't know if anyone
else does this, but I usually have to try out
several versions of profile changes before I
find one I like. Sometimes I type it out and
decide that it's too personal (does everyone
really need to know I'm "listening to Cold
play and crying softly?"), that putting "Anna
Karenina" under favorite books would be

unpardonably pretentious or just that my
picture actually makes me look too psychot
ic for comfort.
So I end up making several very obsessive
looking changes in short order, and I would
rather that Facebook doesn't let everyone
know that I changed my status at 10:35. then
10:37 and then again at 10:45.
But then Mark apologized, and the slight
ly relaxed invasions of my and everyone
else's privacy brought me back.
Plus. Facebook sometimes offers sudden
and inexplicable surprises, like a poke from a
random grad student in a foreign country.
Or. you know, three of them.
The first one was teaching in Switzerland
and had a profile picture of him hugging a
llama, the second one (from the Nether
lands) had a dramatic enio self-taken picture
and refused to respond to my message asking
if we knew one another and the third was a
Canadian who. upon my asking via Facebook
message, confided that he had poked me be
cause 1 "looked cute" in the Finland Face
book group.
Which is flattering, right? Except for the
fact that my profile picture at the time only

showed the back of my head. (I guess my
ponytail was just damn fine.)
1 ve also gotten a couple of friend requests
from sketchy guys who appear to be collect
ing Finnish friends in some kind of weird
fetishist approach to Facebook. a message
from a Midwesterner praising Finnish hock
ey and rock bands and even some girl from
New York asking for translation of some
thing her friend said to her in Finnish. 1 actu
ally felt embarrassed for the girl, though,
since it turns out her friend had said some
pretty salty things to her using words 1 didn't
even know existed. (1 probably don't hang
around enough drunk, angry Finnish
sailors.)
Clearly. I have been elected Ambassador
for Finland to the Entire United States, or At
Least Everyone On Facebook. and nobody
has deigned to notify me.
So 1 don't want to deprive Facebook of its
Finnish ambassador or anything, and 1 do
love wondering aloud to my roommates.
"Wait, who do 1 know in the Netherlands?"
but 1 think it might be better for my mental
health and my productivity if Facebook and 1
went our separate ways.
There's no sense in trying to stop me —
nothing short of a wall post or being bored in
lecture could ever lure me back.

Sini apologizes for vet another Facebook col
umn. especially since it's going ti >be lier last col
umn for this year. She's giving tip writing
columns for editing them as Opinions Editor,
but you can still e-mail her at
