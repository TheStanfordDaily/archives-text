The Daily Misses the Real Problem in
the Herbert Affair
In the follow-up to Kelley Fongs article
about Managing Editor David 1 lerbert's role
in confronting a troubled passenger on an
airplane flight ("On Plane, Squash to the
Rescue"), there has been a disturbing failure
from The Daily to realize the most problem
atic aspect of the incident.This affair actually
presents two quite distinct failings, only one
of which has been acknowledged.
I irst.there is the question of I lerbert's be
havior. both on the plane — where, accord
ing to some accounts at least, he aggravated
the situation and afterwards, when he em
bellished his role to the writer of the story.
The Daily has been quick to address this
problematic behavior, acknowledging it both
in a retraction on Wednesday by Editor-in-
C'hief Patrick Fitzgerald ("Squash story con
tained inaccuracies") and then in a long col
umn on Friday by Public Editor Whitney
Sado ("Whitney Sado's Report").
But nowhere has anyone mentioned the
second, much more troubling problem. Jour
nalism rests upon the principle of objective.

unbiased reporting and editing. When a jour
nalist becomes the subject of news himself, he
can in no way be expected to be unbiased to
wards the story. It is his duty to recuse himself
from all aspects of the story. 'ITiis is where
both I lerbert and the rest ofThe Daily failed.
Sado says that the fault lies with 1 lerbert,
"who displayed an unacceptable abuse of his
editorial power by allowing the article to ad
vance past his desk with these distortions in
tact." The real abuse of his editorial power
was the fact that the article passed by his desk
at all! Herbert should have recused himself
immediately from any editorial role in the
story, precisely because he cannot be expect
ed to have read the article fairly.
The blame should in no way rest just on
Herbert. That no one at The Daily seems to
have realized on Tliesday night that I lerbert
should have recused himself is a troubling re
flection of the journalistic practices at the
Daily There should be a culture at the Daily
where everyone understands the principles
and practices of unbiased, objective report
ing.
Both Fitzgerald and Sado have complete
ly missed the point. Yes. Herbert's actions

both on the plane and in embellishing the in
cident seem to have been inappropriate, but
the real fault lies in the institutional failures
both to ensure safeguards against bias that
would have prevented the incident and to re
alize in the aftermath the true nature of the
problem.
I hope that, ratlu i than simply laying the
blame on Herbert, I lie Daily uses this inci
dent as an educational opportunity to re-ex
amine its journalistic practices.

Moving towards healthy dialogue
It is ironic that an event marketed as a re
sponse to the stilling of debate would do just
that: stifle constructive debate. It was all too
easy for Norman Pinkelstein, the speaker
sponsored by SCAI and ( J ME. to spout his
one-sided, often misleading, viewpoints.
There was no debate! Audience members
voices were essentially stifled, since any
questions from them had to be writ
ten and then selected by SCAI and
( J ME officials. Finkelstein enjoyed
the uncontested stage without hav
ing to engage with a scholar who
could have shared an opposing view
point. Perhaps no one in the academ
ic community thought him to be
worthy of this debate.
If the aim of SCAI and CJME is
truly to promote a constructive and
healthy dialogue for peace in the
Middle East, perhaps they should
consider these ironies next time they
invite someone to speak. Ultimately,
the event reflected their current ap
proach of sacrificing evenhanded de
bate for an inflammatory mono
logue from a biased ideologue.

SLAC should be taken seriously
Yesterday, a letter to the editor
asked, "Why does everyone take
SLAC so seriously?" Iliis question

surprised me: SI.AC is a major oper
ation. Opening in 1%2. this two mile
long accelerator has been a corner
stone of the physics community.
It employs 1 .(XX) people and plays
host to 3,000 visiting researchers a
year. Even in today's booming econo
my. we cannot afford to ignore such a
contribution to the local job market.
But SLAC is not local; it is univer
sal. It has led to the research of three
Nobel prizes. How often do you stop
to think that the nature of nature is
being divined on your route to Se
cret Safeway?
Nor are SLAC's contributions to
humanity limited to physics. Its ac
celerative ability was "indispensa
ble" to the 2006 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry. And after serving as the
location for meetings of the Home
brew Computer Club (members in
cluded the Steves Jobs and Wozniak.
late of Apple fame), SLAC had the
first webpage in America.
For these reasons and so many
more, I do not know how the author
of yesterday's letter could want us to
not take SLAC seriously.
Oh. unless he meant some other
group that doesn't even have the
common sense to wonder if their
proposed acronym is already taken.

The Daily Misses the Real Problem in
the Herbert Affair
In the follow-up to Kelley Fongs article
about Managing Editor David 1 lerbert's role
in confronting a troubled passenger on an
airplane flight ("On Plane, Squash to the
Rescue"), there has been a disturbing failure
from The Daily to realize the most problem
atic aspect of the incident.This affair actually
presents two quite distinct failings, only one
of which has been acknowledged.
I irst.there is the question of I lerbert's be
havior. both on the plane — where, accord
ing to some accounts at least, he aggravated
the situation and afterwards, when he em
bellished his role to the writer of the story.
The Daily has been quick to address this
problematic behavior, acknowledging it both
in a retraction on Wednesday by Editor-in-
C'hief Patrick Fitzgerald ("Squash story con
tained inaccuracies") and then in a long col
umn on Friday by Public Editor Whitney
Sado ("Whitney Sado's Report").
But nowhere has anyone mentioned the
second, much more troubling problem. Jour
nalism rests upon the principle of objective.

unbiased reporting and editing. When a jour
nalist becomes the subject of news himself, he
can in no way be expected to be unbiased to
wards the story. It is his duty to recuse himself
from all aspects of the story. 'ITiis is where
both I lerbert and the rest ofThe Daily failed.
Sado says that the fault lies with 1 lerbert,
"who displayed an unacceptable abuse of his
editorial power by allowing the article to ad
vance past his desk with these distortions in
tact." The real abuse of his editorial power
was the fact that the article passed by his desk
at all! Herbert should have recused himself
immediately from any editorial role in the
story, precisely because he cannot be expect
ed to have read the article fairly.
The blame should in no way rest just on
Herbert. That no one at The Daily seems to
have realized on Tliesday night that I lerbert
should have recused himself is a troubling re
flection of the journalistic practices at the
Daily There should be a culture at the Daily
where everyone understands the principles
and practices of unbiased, objective report
ing.
Both Fitzgerald and Sado have complete
ly missed the point. Yes. Herbert's actions

both on the plane and in embellishing the in
cident seem to have been inappropriate, but
the real fault lies in the institutional failures
both to ensure safeguards against bias that
would have prevented the incident and to re
alize in the aftermath the true nature of the
problem.
I hope that, ratlu i than simply laying the
blame on Herbert, I lie Daily uses this inci
dent as an educational opportunity to re-ex
amine its journalistic practices.

Moving towards healthy dialogue
It is ironic that an event marketed as a re
sponse to the stilling of debate would do just
that: stifle constructive debate. It was all too
easy for Norman Pinkelstein, the speaker
sponsored by SCAI and ( J ME. to spout his
one-sided, often misleading, viewpoints.
There was no debate! Audience members
voices were essentially stifled, since any
questions from them had to be writ
ten and then selected by SCAI and
( J ME officials. Finkelstein enjoyed
the uncontested stage without hav
ing to engage with a scholar who
could have shared an opposing view
point. Perhaps no one in the academ
ic community thought him to be
worthy of this debate.
If the aim of SCAI and CJME is
truly to promote a constructive and
healthy dialogue for peace in the
Middle East, perhaps they should
consider these ironies next time they
invite someone to speak. Ultimately,
the event reflected their current ap
proach of sacrificing evenhanded de
bate for an inflammatory mono
logue from a biased ideologue.

Dangers of overfishing
overemphasized
In your recent editorial, you cite
the 2006 paper by Worm et al that
projects that all the world's fish

sttK'ks will be collapsed by 2048. This
projection has been met with univer
sal derision by knowledgeable fish
eries and scientists around the world
and ranks with Paul Ehrlich's famous
projection. "Famine 1975," as eco
sensationalism. While we recognize
that between 20 and 30 percent of the
world's fish stocks are overexploited
(but not collapsed), we also recog
nize that many places, like most ot
the U.S.. have found mechanisms to
sustainably manage their fisheries. In
the U.S., only about 15 percent of po
tential yield is being lost to overtish
ing and this fraction is declining. 1
imagine that most Stanford students
would be happy to achieve 85 per
cent of the maximum possible in a
complex task. Off the coast of Cali
fornia. the stocks that are classified as
overfished by NOAA constitute less
than 2 percent of the original ecosys
tem biomass. That ecosystem is very
well-managed and hardly at risk of
collapse.
