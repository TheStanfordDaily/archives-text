The Daily Misses the Real Problem in
the Herbert Affair
In the follow-up to Kelley Fongs article
about Managing Editor David 1 lerbert's role
in confronting a troubled passenger on an
airplane flight ("On Plane, Squash to the
Rescue"), there has been a disturbing failure
from The Daily to realize the most problem
atic aspect of the incident.This affair actually
presents two quite distinct failings, only one
of which has been acknowledged.
I irst.there is the question of I lerbert's be
havior. both on the plane â€” where, accord
ing to some accounts at least, he aggravated
the situation and afterwards, when he em
bellished his role to the writer of the story.
The Daily has been quick to address this
problematic behavior, acknowledging it both
in a retraction on Wednesday by Editor-in-
C'hief Patrick Fitzgerald ("Squash story con
tained inaccuracies") and then in a long col
umn on Friday by Public Editor Whitney
Sado ("Whitney Sado's Report").
But nowhere has anyone mentioned the
second, much more troubling problem. Jour
nalism rests upon the principle of objective.

unbiased reporting and editing. When a jour
nalist becomes the subject of news himself, he
can in no way be expected to be unbiased to
wards the story. It is his duty to recuse himself
from all aspects of the story. 'ITiis is where
both I lerbert and the rest ofThe Daily failed.
Sado says that the fault lies with 1 lerbert,
"who displayed an unacceptable abuse of his
editorial power by allowing the article to ad
vance past his desk with these distortions in
tact." The real abuse of his editorial power
was the fact that the article passed by his desk
at all! Herbert should have recused himself
immediately from any editorial role in the
story, precisely because he cannot be expect
ed to have read the article fairly.
The blame should in no way rest just on
Herbert. That no one at The Daily seems to
have realized on Tliesday night that I lerbert
should have recused himself is a troubling re
flection of the journalistic practices at the
Daily There should be a culture at the Daily
where everyone understands the principles
and practices of unbiased, objective report
ing.
Both Fitzgerald and Sado have complete
ly missed the point. Yes. Herbert's actions

both on the plane and in embellishing the in
cident seem to have been inappropriate, but
the real fault lies in the institutional failures
both to ensure safeguards against bias that
would have prevented the incident and to re
alize in the aftermath the true nature of the
problem.
I hope that, ratlu i than simply laying the
blame on Herbert, I lie Daily uses this inci
dent as an educational opportunity to re-ex
amine its journalistic practices.

Moving towards healthy dialogue
It is ironic that an event marketed as a re
sponse to the stilling of debate would do just
that: stifle constructive debate. It was all too
easy for Norman Pinkelstein, the speaker
sponsored by SCAI and ( J ME. to spout his
one-sided, often misleading, viewpoints.
There was no debate! Audience members
voices were essentially stifled, since any
