## Violence must end 
### ROEI KASHI 
As of Saturday, 25 militants and
civilians were killed in Gaza and the
West Bank, including innocent
women and children, this weekend
alone. Fifty more were wounded.
More than 20 were kidnapped. In
the last weeks, personal vendettas
were carried out: little girls were
slaughtered in front of their parents,
just before their parents themselves
were brutally executed.
This time the Israeli army is not
responsible. The Israeli army dues
not carry out such atrocities as
killing children intentionally and de
liberately, in cold blood in front of
their parents. This time it is the bru
tality of Islamic fanatics.The war be
tween Fatah and Hamas has taken
new dimensions, never seen before
in the territories under the political

control of the Palestinian Authority.
Why? How did the world, the PA. Is
rael. the Muslim community and
students groups on U.S. campuses
allow this to happen?
'"Students groups on US Campus
es?"you may wonder. This is not the
case.
Finkelstein's talk on Thursday, or
ganized by CJME and SCAI and
supported by Muslim leaders on
campus, has made me realize how
these students groups not only hin
der peace, but are also indirectly re
sponsible for the ongoing violence.
On Thursday night. Finkelstein's
controversial statements received
much applause from the pro-Arab.
pro-Palestinian, mainly Arab audi
ence. When he condemned the con
struction of the security fence as ille
gal. many cheered and clapped.
When he supported the use of the

word apartheid to describe Israel he
was loudly acclaimed. He even re
ceived deafening applause when he
deemed the Holocaust as not unique
and asserted that the Jews use the
"Holocaust Industry" to promote
their agenda. 1 lowever, in the Q& A
session that followed someone
asked whether Finkelstein's argu
ments can "lead to the conclusion
that all of Israel is occupied territo
ry?" Again, much applause. I lowev
er, when Finkelstein concluded that
the final objective of the Palestini
ans should be a two-state solution,
living side by side in peace and pros
perity, 1 was the only one who
clapped. I noticed the angry looks of
the few Arabs who sat before me.
They clearly did not support a two
state solution. 1 wondered then, how
SCAI and CJME define peace? A
one-state solution with an Arab ma

jority (i.e. Israel's destruction)? If
not, why don't you promote the idea
of a two-state solution to your audi
ence?
CJME. SCAI. and other Muslim
led groups on campus have hardly
organized events denouncing Islam
ic violence as a mean to an end.They
have hardly organized an introspec
tive event highlighting Palestinian
culpability that inflames and con
tributes to the ongoing hatred be
tween Israelis and Palestinians. They
have never organized an event at
tempting to fight the pervasive phe
nomena of suicide bombers, wide
spread Nazi-like propaganda in
Arab media and anti-Semitic incite
ment in mosques and other religious
activities. Rather, they choose to
focus only on Israel's faults, exagger
ating and often even distorting facts
in order to further incite and antag
onize their mainly Arab audience.
I"hus, the Arab world, including
student groups at universities, indi
rectly nurtures violence. Violence is
the main instrument Palestinian so
ciety as a whole (particularly teens)
is familiar with in order to advance
its goals. And now, this violence is
backfiring. It is being used internally

not only hurting innocent Israeli
civilians hut also hurting their inno
cent Palestinian brothers. 1 can only
hope that recent events in Gaza will
drive the Muslim community at
Stanford to act on this issue.
Moreover. 1 found the current be
liefs among Arab students at Stan
ford very disturbing. Unlike many
comments 1 received, as both an Is
raeli and a human being. I am NOT
happy with any bloodshed, whether
Israeli or Palestinian. On the con
trary. I am extremely disturbed that
in my country's backyard our
cousins in fate are turning against
each other. 1 cannot comprehend

how and why Arab and Muslim stu
dents think that I. or any other Is
raeli, would celebrate any blood
shed. Ibis belief is the product of
their anti-Israeli propaganda. By at
tempting to portray the Israelis as a
violent war machine whose sole pur
pose is to kill Palestinians, Muslim
student groups have indoctrinated
themselves with the belief that Is
raelis celebrate Palestinian blood
shed. Nothing could be further from
the truth.
