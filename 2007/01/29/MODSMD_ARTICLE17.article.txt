## Calling SCAI's bluff 
### MISHAN ARAUJO 
Students Confronting Apartheid
in Israel (SCAI) will have us believe
that they are really only interested in
peace. In fact, in the introduction to
their divestment campaign, they
state, "While peace can sometimes
feel elusive, divestment represents a
practical step we. here at Stanford,
can take to end apartheid and bring
peace to Israel and Palestine." Either
SCAI is deeply misinformed regard
ing the situation in the Middle East,
or they are trying to implement a
scheme that will demonize Israel and
impede the peace process.
Proposing divestment as a tool for
peace is unreasonable. Divestment
places all of the blame on Israel
rather than recognizing wrongs and
injustice on both sides. It incites
anger and resentment and hinders
the peace process. Furthermore, it
prolongs the suffering of the Pales
tinians because their economy is
deeply interwoven with the Israeli

economy.
Many international observers of
the Israeli/Palestinian conflict view it
as a dispute over land. Many Israelis,
however, see their very existence at
stake. After all. SCAI's website as of
Jan. 27, 2007 has a myths and facts
section containing the line "Myth #4:
Israel has a right to exist free from
terror."
SCAI's use of "apartheid" is an
other sign that they are not really in
terested in peace. If. as they claim, Is
rael is an apartheid state, why would
the Palestinians negotiate with it?
Why would America spend time and
money working toward a peace
process? Why would people all over
the world who support democracy
and human rights support Israel?
They wouldn't. Perhaps this is the
true aim of SCAI's rhetoric.
SCAI is not interested in peace,
because you don't make peace with
"apartheid." When SCAI is ready to
have an intellectually honest conver
sation about the conflict and its many

nuances,only then will they be work
ing toward peace.
Thomas Friedman once said.
"Criticizing Israel is not anti-Semitic,
and saying so is vile. But singling out
Israel for opprobrium and interna
tional sanction out of all proportion
to any other party in the Middle East
is anti-Semitic, and not saying so is
dishonest."
With this quotation in mind, let's
examine some of the recent events
on campus. According to their web
site. Coalition for Justice in the Mid
dle East (CJME) is "dedicated to
promoting awareness of current
events and instances of human rights
violations and injustice in the re
gion." Yet last quarter their five
events were: Ending Apartheid in the
Holy Land..., Lebanon, Hezbollah
and Israel: What really happened'/,
Breaking the Silence: An Evening
with Former Israeli Soldiers, The
Other Side of Israel..., and...South
Asian-Arab Solidarity against Israeli
Apartheid. It doesn't appear that the

Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East is interested in human rights vi
olations in the "region." It seems
they are interested in singling out Is
rael. It they were truly interested in
the region why wouldn't they have
events about the disgraceful way
women are treated in many Arab
countries, about honor killings, or
about the horrific way members of
the LGBT community are harassed
and often killed in many countries in
the Middle East? If. as Tala Al-
Ramahi claims in her Jan. 26 Op-Ed,
CJME's "plea and struggle for seek
ing justice is color-blind, race-blind,
religion-blind..." then why is their
programming so Israel-centric?
This quarter we've seen the birth
of SCAI, a group with largely the
same membership as CJME. and so
far they've brought us the launch of
their divestment campaign followed
by an event about the Jewish people's
exploitation of the Holocaust and
