legiate debut. She defeated Emma Shapiro by a score of

well, but it also extended Stan
ford's current overall winning
streak to 87 matches, a streak
which dates back to the beginning
of the 2004 season.
"I think [Thursday's] match was a
great way to start our season." Logar
said. "I think that everybody played
really well. It wasn't the most chal
lenging match, but we didn't take it
for granted."
Burdettc shared similar thoughts
on Thursday's results.
"I was super surprised at how well

we came together," she said."[l lead
coach] Lele [Forood] and [assistant
coach] Frankie [Brennan] haven't
been hard on us, but they really
asked us to step up our intensity ... I
think it got us in that bloodthirsty
mode."
"We just took care of business; it
was kind of amazing," Burdette
added.
After their relatively easy victory
over Davis on Thursday, the Cardi
nal were set to take on No. 21 Fresno
State. However, due to the rain, the
match was postponed to a later, in
definite date.
The postponement was some
what of a disappointment for Stan
ford. who had built a lot of momen
tum after its victory over Davis. It is

possible that the match might be
cancelled, although if the match is
eventually made up. it would be
scheduled in April.
"We were up and ready to go es
pecially coming off of Davis the day
before," Burdette said of the can
celled match. "Davis was a really
positive day for us and we were
ready to kick Fresno State's butt."
The Cardinal now fly out to
Madison. Wise., where they will com
pete in the National Team Indoors.
The National Indoors is a single
elimination tournament with teams
from all over the country competing.
A strong performance from Stan
ford will go a long way in establish
ing the team's supremacy on a na
tional level.
