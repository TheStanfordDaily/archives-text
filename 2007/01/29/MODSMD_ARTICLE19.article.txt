# Wiggins leads in Cardinal win
## Junior guard scores season-high 30 points 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
ITie N0.9 women's basketball team and No. 10 Arizona
State knew it would come down to the end in Saturday's
match-up between the top Pac-10 rivals. What the teams
might not have realized is that it would also come down to No.
1 1 —junior guard Candice Wiggins.
Wiggins led the Cardinal to a 73-65 overtime win Saturday,
stepping up against the Sun Devils as she had when her 19 sec
ond-half points gave Stanford a 77-71 win in December.This
time, after two close halves with neither team leading by more
than seven, Wiggins capped a season-high 30 total points with
10 in overtime.
"I think it will just build people's confidence to go in and
win in overtime and do as well as we did without two of our
top players." Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said.
At first, it seemed like Arizona State (19-3, l >-2 Pacific-10
Conference) would run the game when it pulled ahead 13-6
within the first six minutes. Stanford missed easy shots and av
eraged 33.3 percent from the field for the halt. Still, the Sun
Devils didn't get any farther as the Cardinal (18-3.11 -0) went
on a 9-2 run to take their first lead of the game with 8:40 left
in the first half.Though the game was tight for a few more min
utes, Stanford pulled away on a 6-0 run that left ASU catching
up at the end of the half, down 29-26.
After a layup by Sun Devil forward Emily Westerberg at
the start of the half, the heat was on again. The teams stayed
within one point of each other until a layup by freshman

NOTES: Stanford improves to 42-11 all-time against Arizona State and
has six of the last seven meetings. Candice Wiggins becomes the first
Cardinal player to score at least 30 points in a game since Brooke
Smith poured in 35 against Oklahoma on Mar. 25, 2006 in the NCAA
Tournament. Saturday represented Stanford's first overtime game since
an 85-76 loss to UCLA in last year's Pac-10 Tournament championship
game. It was the Cardinal's first overtime victory since defeating UCLA
78-71 back on Jan. 23, 2004. With her 30-point effort on Saturday,
Wiggins surpassed Jennifer Azzi on Stanford's all-time scoring list and
now ranks sixth with 1,645 career points.

a 73-65 overtime win over Arizona State in Tempe, Ariz.
guard JJ Hones gave the Cardinal a
three-point lead that was extended to
as much as four.
The Sun Devils came back again
for the lead,s4-52, with 4:40 left in the
half. Stanford pulled away again tin
five points by freshman center Jayne
Appel but encountered new prob
lems with senior center Brooke Smith
fouling out with less than two minutes
to go.
I laving lost their star post and
third-highest scorer (six points) for the
day, the Cardinal lost Appel (the sec
ond-highest scorer with 17 points) to
fouls as well. With ASU's free throws,
the lead was gone too, and the Sun
Devils led 59-57 with 1:09 left.
After she scored 11 of Stanford's
second-half points, Wiggins stepped
up and made the game-tying layup
with 52 seconds to go. Both teams
went for the win in the remaining sec
onds but a few misses and defensive
rebounds, as well as a last-second
block by senior center Kristen Newlin
against ASU's Briiinn January, led the
game into overtime.
Prom the first moments of over
time. the Cardinal left the Sun Devils
behind once and for all. Wiggins sunk
six free throws and two jumpers to put
Stanford ahead by as much as 10.
After a jumper by Arizona State's
Danielle Orsillo, the score was 73-65,
and a deflated Sun Devil squad let
Wiggins dribble the ball slowly down
the court until time ran out.
"This type of game will get us ready

for anybody," VanDerveer said.
"Coming in to this environment and
playing in this atmosphere is a great
confidence builder for our team and
for our young players. But we have a
lot of work to do. We can't just fast-for
ward to March and think that we're
ready. We're not."
Wiggins finished 10 for 22 from the
field and had five rebounds.
"She made great decisions," Van-
Derveer said. "She made her free
throws, really worked hard defensive
ly and stayed in the game and played
the whole 45 minutes."
Newlin led Stanford with 10 re
bounds, while freshman Jillian Har
mon, who stepped up in the absence of
Smith and Appel, had nine rebounds
and six points. After poor shooting in
the first halt the Cardinal averaged
4K.0 percent from the field in the sec
ond half and 75.0 percent in overtime,
for 41.9 percent overall.
Orsillo led Arizona State with 15
points, followed by January with 11
and Reagan Pariseau with 10. for
ward Aubree Johnson led the Sun
Devils with 13 rebounds.
Stanford continues its road trip this
week but will take a breather against

Prom the first moments of over
time. the Cardinal left the Sun Devils
behind once and for all. Wiggins sunk
six free throws and two jumpers to put
Stanford ahead by as much as 10.
After a jumper by Arizona State's
Danielle Orsillo, the score was 73-65,
and a deflated Sun Devil squad let
Wiggins dribble the ball slowly down
the court until time ran out.
"This type of game will get us ready

for anybody," VanDerveer said.
"Coming in to this environment and
playing in this atmosphere is a great
confidence builder for our team and
for our young players. But we have a
lot of work to do. We can't just fast-for
ward to March and think that we're
ready. We're not."
Wiggins finished 10 for 22 from the
field and had five rebounds.
"She made great decisions," Van-
Derveer said. "She made her free
throws, really worked hard defensive
ly and stayed in the game and played
the whole 45 minutes."
Newlin led Stanford with 10 re
bounds, while freshman Jillian Har
mon, who stepped up in the absence of
Smith and Appel, had nine rebounds
and six points. After poor shooting in
the first halt the Cardinal averaged
4K.0 percent from the field in the sec
ond half and 75.0 percent in overtime,
for 41.9 percent overall.
Orsillo led Arizona State with 15
points, followed by January with 11

1 1 —junior guard Candice Wiggins.
Wiggins led the Cardinal to a 73-65 overtime win Saturday,
stepping up against the Sun Devils as she had when her 19 sec
ond-half points gave Stanford a 77-71 win in December.This
time, after two close halves with neither team leading by more
than seven, Wiggins capped a season-high 30 total points with
10 in overtime.
"I think it will just build people's confidence to go in and
win in overtime and do as well as we did without two of our
top players." Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said.
At first, it seemed like Arizona State (19-3, l >-2 Pacific-10
Conference) would run the game when it pulled ahead 13-6
within the first six minutes. Stanford missed easy shots and av
eraged 33.3 percent from the field for the halt. Still, the Sun
Devils didn't get any farther as the Cardinal (18-3.11 -0) went
on a 9-2 run to take their first lead of the game with 8:40 left
in the first half.Though the game was tight for a few more min
utes, Stanford pulled away on a 6-0 run that left ASU catching
up at the end of the half, down 29-26.
After a layup by Sun Devil forward Emily Westerberg at
the start of the half, the heat was on again. The teams stayed

has six of the last seven meetings. Candice Wiggins becomes the first
Cardinal player to score at least 30 points in a game since Brooke
Smith poured in 35 against Oklahoma on Mar. 25, 2006 in the NCAA
Tournament. Saturday represented Stanford's first overtime game since
an 85-76 loss to UCLA in last year's Pac-10 Tournament championship
game. It was the Cardinal's first overtime victory since defeating UCLA
78-71 back on Jan. 23, 2004. With her 30-point effort on Saturday,
Wiggins surpassed Jennifer Azzi on Stanford's all-time scoring list and
now ranks sixth with 1,645 career points.
