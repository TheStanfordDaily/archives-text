ITie N0.9 women's basketball team and No. 10 Arizona
State knew it would come down to the end in Saturday's
match-up between the top Pac-10 rivals. What the teams
might not have realized is that it would also come down to No.
1 1 â€”junior guard Candice Wiggins.
Wiggins led the Cardinal to a 73-65 overtime win Saturday,
stepping up against the Sun Devils as she had when her 19 sec
ond-half points gave Stanford a 77-71 win in December.This
time, after two close halves with neither team leading by more
than seven, Wiggins capped a season-high 30 total points with
10 in overtime.
"I think it will just build people's confidence to go in and
win in overtime and do as well as we did without two of our
top players." Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said.
At first, it seemed like Arizona State (19-3, l >-2 Pacific-10
Conference) would run the game when it pulled ahead 13-6
within the first six minutes. Stanford missed easy shots and av
eraged 33.3 percent from the field for the halt. Still, the Sun
Devils didn't get any farther as the Cardinal (18-3.11 -0) went
on a 9-2 run to take their first lead of the game with 8:40 left
in the first half.Though the game was tight for a few more min
utes, Stanford pulled away on a 6-0 run that left ASU catching
up at the end of the half, down 29-26.
After a layup by Sun Devil forward Emily Westerberg at
the start of the half, the heat was on again. The teams stayed
within one point of each other until a layup by freshman

NOTES: Stanford improves to 42-11 all-time against Arizona State and
has six of the last seven meetings. Candice Wiggins becomes the first
Cardinal player to score at least 30 points in a game since Brooke
Smith poured in 35 against Oklahoma on Mar. 25, 2006 in the NCAA
Tournament. Saturday represented Stanford's first overtime game since
an 85-76 loss to UCLA in last year's Pac-10 Tournament championship
game. It was the Cardinal's first overtime victory since defeating UCLA
78-71 back on Jan. 23, 2004. With her 30-point effort on Saturday,
Wiggins surpassed Jennifer Azzi on Stanford's all-time scoring list and
now ranks sixth with 1,645 career points.
