# CAMPAIGN 2008
## Election draws student, faculty involvement Obama and Clinton energize student interest in primaries 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As four more presidential candidates entered
the fray last week, including the much anticipat
ed Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama an
nouncements. Stanford students and faculty are
revving up for what could be one of the most ex
citing— and crowded — elections in recent his
tory.
In addition to an increase in political aware
ness on campus, a number of Stanford communi
ty members are seeking out ways to get involved
in the primary races.
"Everyone in both parties seems to be starting
earlier this election," said senior Tyler Kirtley.
chair of Stanford in Government. "It's a much
more interesting election because you don't have
an incumbent who's clearly status quo and you
don't have a challenger who's the anti-status quo.
You have around eight to 10 people entering the
race from both sides, and students are going to be
looking closely at them and their policies."
Because 2008 will be the first election since
1928 that no presidential or vice-presidential in
cumbent is running, politicians and students from
both parties see it as an opportunity to focus on
new policies.
"It is the first time that the primary fields have
been open on both sides," said Mikey Lee. a 2005
graduate and spokesperson for Obama for
America. " There are already over a dozen credi
ble candidates who have announced a formation
of either a presidential exploratory or official
campaign committee. Fhough the Stanford stu
dent body tends to skew left as a whole. I antici
pate that this election will be highly competitive,
thus involving students from every viewpoint."
In addition to participating in campus activi
ties. many seniors have started to center their
post-graduation plans around various campaigns.
"1 think that a lot of people will end up work
ing on campaigns right after graduation." Kirtley
said. "Normally campaigns don't get started this
early, but since so many candidates have already
entered the field and started fundraising it makes
sense for'o7 graduates tostart working on them."
Political Science Prof. Josh Cohen said he ex
pects the 2008 election to elicit a good deal of fac
ulty participation as well.
"i expect that there will be a large involve
ment on the part of faculty who are Democratic
identified because they see substantial opportu
nities." Cohen said. "The presidential race is very
much open and there are large chances for new
policy initiatives at the national level."
Because more than 20 states will have their
primaries before mid-February of 2008, candi
dates will need fully developed national opera
tions by this fall. This strict timeline could force
both parties to choose their respective candidates
more than eight months before the general elec
tion.
Senior Bobby Lepore, president of the Stan
ford Democrats, said that California's recent de
liberations over moving up the date of its primar
ies could seriously affect student involvement.
"In terms of on-campus participation, I'm
going to be very interested to see how it will
change if California does go ahead with the plan
to move up the primaries," Lepore said."lf this is
the case, there will be a lot of opportunities for ac
tivism on campus. It could come down to Califor
nia as the state in which the candidate is decided.
Iliis is a great opportunity for Stanford students
to have a voice in the direction of the
country."
Political Science Prof. John Fere
john said the primary races and Cali
fornia's role in them could have a sig
nificant impact on the amount of
public involvement in the general
elections.
'I think it depends on who is run
ning in the primaries and whether
California's vote matters there, and
who is running in the general elec
tion," Ferejohn said. "Obviously fac
ulty and students care a lot about
Iraq and many other issues, but de
pending on who the candidates are
and what they run on, these questions

may or may not turn out to be impor
tant."
With more than 500
Facebook.com groups and hundreds
ot vocal supporters around campus.
Senator Barack Obama (D-ll.) has
turned out to be a leading candidate
in the Stanford community.
"There is an amazing amount of
excitement surrounding a potential
Obama campaign." Lee said. "One
of the national Students for Obama
organizations has over 50,000 Face
book group members. The group
"Barack Obama: One Million
Strong for Barack" has signed up
over 150.000 people in just over a
week.The Web site Obama4Ameri
ca.com raised over $10,000 from
over 100 small donors in a little over
a week. The sheer amount of stu
dent excitement will catapult
Obama's campaign into political

history."
Lepore attributed much of
Obama's popularity to his ability to
go beyond party lines.
"I think that there have been a lot
of people who have missed having a
candidate that can really articulate
what we believe in a way that tran
scends politics and sound bites," Lep
ore said. "I'm excited about his po
tential to bring some new issues to
the forefront with his popularity and
charisma."
While most faculty members
have not started contributing to the
200S presidential campaigns, a large
number contributed to recent sena
torial campaigns of prospective
presidential candidates, including
Obama. Evan Bayh (D-IN), George
Allen (R-VA) and Joseph Biden (D
--DE). yet Bayh and Allen have de
clared that they will not seek the

presidency. Hillary Clin

ton (D-NY) received the

new policies.
"It is the first time that the primary fields have
been open on both sides," said Mikey Lee. a 2005
graduate and spokesperson for Obama for
America. " There are already over a dozen credi
ble candidates who have announced a formation
of either a presidential exploratory or official
campaign committee. Fhough the Stanford stu
dent body tends to skew left as a whole. I antici
pate that this election will be highly competitive,
thus involving students from every viewpoint."
In addition to participating in campus activi
ties. many seniors have started to center their
post-graduation plans around various campaigns.
"1 think that a lot of people will end up work
ing on campaigns right after graduation." Kirtley
said. "Normally campaigns don't get started this
early, but since so many candidates have already
entered the field and started fundraising it makes
sense for'o7 graduates tostart working on them."
Political Science Prof. Josh Cohen said he ex
pects the 2008 election to elicit a good deal of fac
ulty participation as well.
"i expect that there will be a large involve
ment on the part of faculty who are Democratic
identified because they see substantial opportu
nities." Cohen said. "The presidential race is very
much open and there are large chances for new
policy initiatives at the national level."
Because more than 20 states will have their
primaries before mid-February of 2008, candi
dates will need fully developed national opera
tions by this fall. This strict timeline could force
both parties to choose their respective candidates
more than eight months before the general elec
tion.
Senior Bobby Lepore, president of the Stan
ford Democrats, said that California's recent de
liberations over moving up the date of its primar
ies could seriously affect student involvement.
"In terms of on-campus participation, I'm
going to be very interested to see how it will
change if California does go ahead with the plan
to move up the primaries," Lepore said."lf this is
the case, there will be a lot of opportunities for ac
tivism on campus. It could come down to Califor
nia as the state in which the candidate is decided.
Iliis is a great opportunity for Stanford students
to have a voice in the direction of the
country."
Political Science Prof. John Fere
john said the primary races and Cali
fornia's role in them could have a sig
nificant impact on the amount of
public involvement in the general
elections.
'I think it depends on who is run
ning in the primaries and whether
California's vote matters there, and
who is running in the general elec
tion," Ferejohn said. "Obviously fac
ulty and students care a lot about
Iraq and many other issues, but de
pending on who the candidates are
and what they run on, these questions

may or may not turn out to be impor
tant."
With more than 500
Facebook.com groups and hundreds
ot vocal supporters around campus.
Senator Barack Obama (D-ll.) has
turned out to be a leading candidate
in the Stanford community.
"There is an amazing amount of
excitement surrounding a potential
Obama campaign." Lee said. "One
of the national Students for Obama
organizations has over 50,000 Face
book group members. The group
"Barack Obama: One Million
Strong for Barack" has signed up
over 150.000 people in just over a
week.The Web site Obama4Ameri
ca.com raised over $10,000 from
over 100 small donors in a little over
a week. The sheer amount of stu
dent excitement will catapult
Obama's campaign into political

history."
Lepore attributed much of
Obama's popularity to his ability to
go beyond party lines.
"I think that there have been a lot
of people who have missed having a
candidate that can really articulate
what we believe in a way that tran
scends politics and sound bites," Lep
ore said. "I'm excited about his po
tential to bring some new issues to
the forefront with his popularity and
charisma."
While most faculty members
have not started contributing to the
200S presidential campaigns, a large
number contributed to recent sena
torial campaigns of prospective
presidential candidates, including
Obama. Evan Bayh (D-IN), George
Allen (R-VA) and Joseph Biden (D
--DE). yet Bayh and Allen have de
clared that they will not seek the

presidency. Hillary Clin

ton (D-NY) received the

most contributions.

bringing in nearly

$19,000 from Stanford

faculty.
"Hillary Clinton is a

person of enormous tal-

ent. strength, experience

and intelligence." Cohen

said. "She understandably has

a large following, but she also
comes to the campaign with
strong negatives: lots of peo-

ple do not like her. and 1 would

expect that to be a continuing
source of concern, even

among people who are broad
ly in agreement with her. She

J O"
also may be hurt by an under
standable sense of exhaus
tion with the politics of the

Bush-Clinton era."
