## Stanford drops home opener to Boise State 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite taking an early lead, the Stan
ford men's tennis team could not maintain
its momentum against Boise State this
weekend. The No. 25 Broncos used this to
their advantage and upset the No. 9 C ardi
nal. 5-1. on Saturday in Stanford's home
opener.
Because of a one-hour rain delay, the
match adopted an alternate format. Satur
day's contest began with the top two singles
matches followed by the next four singles

competitions, instead of the usual doubles
followed by singles, as the pace depended
on how quickly the courts dried.
Sophomore Ail-American Matt Bruch
returned to the lineup after recovering
from an injury and played in the top spot
for the Cardinal. Freshman Richard Wire
played in his first dual match at Taube Ten
nis Center in the second singles position.
After both players won their first sets. Stan
ford looked as if it was gaining momentum
and ready to pick up the "W."
In the first set. Bruch remained on serve
until 3-3 and then broke No. 15 Luke

1. in the first and effectively executed a one
two punch,combining a slice backhand fol
lowed by a put-away volley.
The four remaining singles matches hit
the court partway through Bruch and
Wire's first sets. Despite Stanford's early
edge, Boise State gained the drive and ran
with it.
"We got some momentum pretty quick
ly by getting two first sets," head coach John
Whitlinger said. "But boy, Boise State did a
great job of turning that match around."
Although both players won their first
sets. Bruch and Wire dropped their second
ones, making many more unforced errors
than they did in their opening sets.
"I think [Matt] was making the right de
cisions a lot of times, but things were a little
tougher for him than they usually are be
cause he hasn't played [in a while)."
Whitlinger said. "Luke Shields is a very
good player in his own right and just started
making some more balls."
Sophomore Blake Mullerand freshman
Paul Morrissey dropped identical 6-1 first
sets at the third and fourth singles positions,
respectively. Freshman Kevin Kaiser re
mained on serve until halfway through the
opening set before his opponent closed out
the first, 6-3.
Senior Eric McKean led 4-1 in the first,
and although the captain's opponent
evened the score to 5-5, the Cardinal was
able to claim the set. 7-5.
As the afternoon wore on and the sun
disappeared behind the clouds, Stanford's
chances started to appear bleaker.

Freshman Kevin Kaiser remained on serve through his opening set against the Mastodons'
Brent Werbeck before Werbeck won 6-3. Kaiser dropped the second set, 6-3, as well.
Muller was the first match off the
court, losing 6-1, 6-2. Following
match point, Muller's opponent
launched a ball into the stands and
announced to his teammates that
the first point was on the board for
Boise State.
Wire's match was the next to be
completed, as he dropped a 1 -6,6-3,
6-2 decision. In the second and third
sets, Clancy Shields moved well and
chased down many balls, pressuring
the Stanford freshman to hit just
one more volley each time and often
forcing errors.
Brent Werbeck defeated Kaiser.
6-3, 6-3, to give Boise State a 3-0
lead, and Eric Roberson made it 4-0
with his 6-1,6-2 defeat of Morrissey.
After a string of service breaks
from both players toward the end of
the third, Bruch hit a return into the
net to complete Luke Shields' 3-6,6-
1,6-3 win.
"I give a lot of credit to Boise
State for making shots." Whitlinger
said. "But I think if you look at a lot
of matches, we were really hurting
ourselves with a lot of unforced er
rors. We just have to do a better job
of that from top to bottom, and we
will â€” we'll get better at that. But to
me, that was the key to the match,
they made shots and we just missed a
lot of balls, balls that to me were un
forced."
Boise State led Stanford 5-0, and
all eyes turned to McKean's singles

match. Despite being down a break
for part of the second set. Mckean
forced a tiebreaker and eventually
picked up the breaker, 7-4. the set
and the match.
"I knew Eric would |keep fight
ing]," Whitlinger said. "That's just
the type of player that lie is. 1 think it
shows the new guys on the team
what it's all about. That was a great
statement by Eric to go out there
and fight to get us one point.
"I hope our entire team learns
from what Eric did," Whitlinger con
tinued. "Regardless of the situation,
you want to go out and play the
hardest and toughest that you can
play. Eric sure showed that, and I'm
really proud of him for that."
Although the final outcome had
already been decided, the doubles
matches hit the court but were soon
cut short due to rain. Stanford led
the top two doubles matches by a
service break but was down a break
in the final singles match.
The Cardinal hit the court again
next weekend when they travel to Los
Angeles to take on No. 431 JSC on Fri
day and No. 4 UCLA on Saturday.
