### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite taking an early lead, the Stan
ford men's tennis team could not maintain
its momentum against Boise State this
weekend. The No. 25 Broncos used this to
their advantage and upset the No. 9 C ardi
nal. 5-1. on Saturday in Stanford's home
opener.
Because of a one-hour rain delay, the
match adopted an alternate format. Satur
day's contest began with the top two singles
matches followed by the next four singles

competitions, instead of the usual doubles
followed by singles, as the pace depended
on how quickly the courts dried.
Sophomore Ail-American Matt Bruch
returned to the lineup after recovering
from an injury and played in the top spot
for the Cardinal. Freshman Richard Wire
played in his first dual match at Taube Ten
nis Center in the second singles position.
After both players won their first sets. Stan
ford looked as if it was gaining momentum
and ready to pick up the "W."
In the first set. Bruch remained on serve
until 3-3 and then broke No. 15 Luke

The four remaining singles matches hit
the court partway through Bruch and
Wire's first sets. Despite Stanford's early
edge, Boise State gained the drive and ran
with it.
"We got some momentum pretty quick
ly by getting two first sets," head coach John
Whitlinger said. "But boy, Boise State did a
great job of turning that match around."
Although both players won their first
sets. Bruch and Wire dropped their second
ones, making many more unforced errors
than they did in their opening sets.
"I think [Matt] was making the right de
cisions a lot of times, but things were a little
tougher for him than they usually are be
cause he hasn't played [in a while)."
Whitlinger said. "Luke Shields is a very
good player in his own right and just started
making some more balls."
Sophomore Blake Mullerand freshman
Paul Morrissey dropped identical 6-1 first
sets at the third and fourth singles positions,
respectively. Freshman Kevin Kaiser re
mained on serve until halfway through the
opening set before his opponent closed out
the first, 6-3.
Senior Eric McKean led 4-1 in the first,
and although the captain's opponent
evened the score to 5-5, the Cardinal was
able to claim the set. 7-5.
As the afternoon wore on and the sun
disappeared behind the clouds, Stanford's
chances started to appear bleaker.
