### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's volleyball team trav
eled 2.000 miles in search of its first win of
2007. hut came up empty against undefeated
No. 7 Indiana University-Purdue University
Fort Wayne this weekend.
ITie Cardinal (0-9, 0-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) saw season-best hitting
out of sophomore middle blocker Brandon
Williams, who had 19 kills on 27 attempts with
no errors on the weekend, but the Mastodons
(6-0) proved too powerful. IPFW finished
with a pair of sweeps at the non-conference
nits this weekend,3o-27,30-27,31-29 on Fri
day. and 30-26.30-28,30-24 on Saturday.
"Brandon Williams played great this
weekend." Stanford head coach John Kosty
said of the sophomore who celebrated his
twentieth birthday on Friday. "He did really
well for us. but I think our outside hitters were
a little inconsistent this weekend, and we
weren't able to get enough kills out of the out
side and opposite hitting positions to get our
selves in position to win."
"1 thought they were a little bit better than
what we had seen on tape, and they are basi
cally comparable to teams in our league,"
Kosty said. "I think they are ranked about
where they should be. They definitely have
the tools to win some big matches this sea
son."
The Cardinal scored the first point of Fri
day's match on a Williams kill and led by as
many as three before the Mastodons came
back to tie the game and then build a three
point lead of their own at the halfway point.
Stanford closed the gap and tied the game at
17. but the Mastodons pulled ahead for good
with a service ace at 27-26.
Stanford again won the first point to start
the second on a block by Williams and fresh
man setter Kawika Shoji.The Cardinal's lead
grew to four and that advantage held until 15-
11. But the Mastodons charged back with
four straight points to tie the game.The score

w;is tied at 27-27. but three Stanford errors
handed IPFW the win.
Neither team could build much momen
tum early in the third game, with the Cardinal
carrying a 15-12 lead into the official timeout.
Stanford powered out of that break with a f>-
2 run to go up 21-14. The Mastodons slowly
closed in, but the Cardinal reached game
point at 29-27. The Mastodons, however, fin
ished the game with four straight points on
three kills and a block to win and clinch the
sweep.
"In that third game, they [IPFW] made
some great plays," Kosty said. "It wasn't a sit
uation where we made a tremendous amount
of errors, but they were making plays, getting
good touch blocks and playing well in transi
tion. And then on match point, their digger
stuck out one hand to the side and miracu
lously dug [freshman opposite) Evan
Romero. The ball went straight up and they
took a swing and got a kill. We played well but
the ball was just not bouncing our way."
Junior outside hitter Matt Ceran had a
team-high 14 kills while Romero chipped in
13. Williams hit error-free with seven.
Romero, Williams and freshman middle
blocker Garrett Werner each notched three
