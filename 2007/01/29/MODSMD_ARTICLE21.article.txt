## Card drop back-to-back games against Mastodons Williams' play not enough to avoid two sweeps 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's volleyball team trav
eled 2.000 miles in search of its first win of
2007. hut came up empty against undefeated
No. 7 Indiana University-Purdue University
Fort Wayne this weekend.
ITie Cardinal (0-9, 0-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) saw season-best hitting
out of sophomore middle blocker Brandon
Williams, who had 19 kills on 27 attempts with
no errors on the weekend, but the Mastodons
(6-0) proved too powerful. IPFW finished
with a pair of sweeps at the non-conference
nits this weekend,3o-27,30-27,31-29 on Fri
day. and 30-26.30-28,30-24 on Saturday.
"Brandon Williams played great this
weekend." Stanford head coach John Kosty
said of the sophomore who celebrated his
twentieth birthday on Friday. "He did really
well for us. but I think our outside hitters were
a little inconsistent this weekend, and we
weren't able to get enough kills out of the out
side and opposite hitting positions to get our
selves in position to win."
"1 thought they were a little bit better than
what we had seen on tape, and they are basi
cally comparable to teams in our league,"
Kosty said. "I think they are ranked about
where they should be. They definitely have
the tools to win some big matches this sea
son."
The Cardinal scored the first point of Fri
day's match on a Williams kill and led by as
many as three before the Mastodons came
back to tie the game and then build a three
point lead of their own at the halfway point.
Stanford closed the gap and tied the game at
17. but the Mastodons pulled ahead for good
with a service ace at 27-26.
Stanford again won the first point to start
the second on a block by Williams and fresh
man setter Kawika Shoji.The Cardinal's lead
grew to four and that advantage held until 15-
11. But the Mastodons charged back with
four straight points to tie the game.The score

w;is tied at 27-27. but three Stanford errors
handed IPFW the win.
Neither team could build much momen
tum early in the third game, with the Cardinal
carrying a 15-12 lead into the official timeout.
Stanford powered out of that break with a f>-
2 run to go up 21-14. The Mastodons slowly
closed in, but the Cardinal reached game
point at 29-27. The Mastodons, however, fin
ished the game with four straight points on
three kills and a block to win and clinch the
sweep.
"In that third game, they [IPFW] made
some great plays," Kosty said. "It wasn't a sit
uation where we made a tremendous amount
of errors, but they were making plays, getting
good touch blocks and playing well in transi
tion. And then on match point, their digger
stuck out one hand to the side and miracu
lously dug [freshman opposite) Evan
Romero. The ball went straight up and they
took a swing and got a kill. We played well but
the ball was just not bouncing our way."
Junior outside hitter Matt Ceran had a
team-high 14 kills while Romero chipped in
13. Williams hit error-free with seven.
Romero, Williams and freshman middle
blocker Garrett Werner each notched three
blocks, and senior libero Brian l.ind
berg led the Stanford defense with
14 digs.
In the Saturday night rematch.
Williams and IPFW's Josh Stewart
both had career nights. Fach player
hit over .800.but the Mastodons held
off the Cardinal for a second sweep.
Neither team led by more than a
point in the first game until IPFW
pulled ahead 17-13. Ihc Cardinal
came within one. but the Mastodons
ultimately took the first frame on a
kill by Stewart.
IPFW got off to a faster start in
the second game and led by five
points before the Cardinal staged a
comeback. Stanford built an 8-2 run
to take back the lead at 19-18, forcing
a Mastodon timeout. IPFW came
back with three straight points to
force the Cardinal to use a timeout
as well. Stanford survived the first

game point, hut Stewart clinched the
game with a kill.
The third frame was another
close one. with the score tied as late
as 15-15. The Mastodons took ad
vantage of Cardinal errors, howev
er. and pulled ahead by five to put
the game out of Stanford's reach.
Shoji brought his team within two
with an ace at 25-23. but Stanford
would score only one more point
down the stretch,as a kill by Macias
ended it.
Romero led the Cardinal attack
with a match-high 17 kills while
Williams hit 12-for-15 with no errors.
For IPFW, Stewart's .824 hitting per
centage (14 kills on 17 swings) was
nearly a school record. On defense,
Stanford sophomore Jarod Keller
led all players with nine digs while
Werner and sophomore Cameron
Christoffers led the Cardinal with
two blocks apiece.
This past weekend was reflective
of past matches, where Stanford has
struggled to finish games, often los
ing by only two or three points. Kosty
is nonetheless confident in his team's

growth.
"It's a learning process," he said.
"We've got a young team and guys
on the floor who have not been in
that position. Or if they have been,
it was in a different playing position,
like Matt Ceran. He played in some
big matches for us last year as a mid
dle blocker, but now he is an out
side- and our go-to hitter. It's a
learning curve, and we are playing
some good teams with upperclass
men who have been there before.
And for us. we're still testing those
waters."
With only one full day of prac
tice between matches, the Cardinal
will take on local rival No. 12 Pacif
ic in Burnham Pavilion on Tuesday
night.
"We respond really well [to the
short turnaround]." Kosty said. "We
have improved in every single match
this season and I am expecting to see
the same competitive attitude that I
saw against BYU and in Fort Wayne.
Iliat is something I have been very
pleased with this season: how hard
they play every day."

of errors, but they were making plays, getting
good touch blocks and playing well in transi
tion. And then on match point, their digger
stuck out one hand to the side and miracu
lously dug [freshman opposite) Evan
Romero. The ball went straight up and they
took a swing and got a kill. We played well but
the ball was just not bouncing our way."
Junior outside hitter Matt Ceran had a
team-high 14 kills while Romero chipped in
13. Williams hit error-free with seven.
Romero, Williams and freshman middle
blocker Garrett Werner each notched three
blocks, and senior libero Brian l.ind
berg led the Stanford defense with
14 digs.
In the Saturday night rematch.

both had career nights. Fach player
hit over .800.but the Mastodons held
off the Cardinal for a second sweep.
Neither team led by more than a
point in the first game until IPFW
pulled ahead 17-13. Ihc Cardinal
came within one. but the Mastodons

the second game and led by five
points before the Cardinal staged a

a Mastodon timeout. IPFW came
back with three straight points to
force the Cardinal to use a timeout
as well. Stanford survived the first

game point, hut Stewart clinched the
game with a kill.

vantage of Cardinal errors, howev
er. and pulled ahead by five to put

nearly a school record. On defense,
Stanford sophomore Jarod Keller
led all players with nine digs while
Werner and sophomore Cameron
Christoffers led the Cardinal with
two blocks apiece.
This past weekend was reflective
of past matches, where Stanford has
struggled to finish games, often los
ing by only two or three points. Kosty
is nonetheless confident in his team's

growth.
"It's a learning process," he said.
"We've got a young team and guys
on the floor who have not been in
that position. Or if they have been,
it was in a different playing position,
like Matt Ceran. He played in some
big matches for us last year as a mid
dle blocker, but now he is an out
side- and our go-to hitter. It's a
learning curve, and we are playing
some good teams with upperclass
men who have been there before.
And for us. we're still testing those
waters."
With only one full day of prac
tice between matches, the Cardinal
will take on local rival No. 12 Pacif
ic in Burnham Pavilion on Tuesday
night.
"We respond really well [to the
short turnaround]." Kosty said. "We
have improved in every single match
this season and I am expecting to see
the same competitive attitude that I
saw against BYU and in Fort Wayne.
Iliat is something I have been very
pleased with this season: how hard
they play every day."
The Stanford men's volleyball team trav
eled 2.000 miles in search of its first win of
2007. hut came up empty against undefeated
No. 7 Indiana University-Purdue University
Fort Wayne this weekend.
ITie Cardinal (0-9, 0-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) saw season-best hitting
out of sophomore middle blocker Brandon
Williams, who had 19 kills on 27 attempts with
no errors on the weekend, but the Mastodons
(6-0) proved too powerful. IPFW finished
with a pair of sweeps at the non-conference
nits this weekend,3o-27,30-27,31-29 on Fri
day. and 30-26.30-28,30-24 on Saturday.
"Brandon Williams played great this
weekend." Stanford head coach John Kosty
said of the sophomore who celebrated his
twentieth birthday on Friday. "He did really
well for us. but I think our outside hitters were
a little inconsistent this weekend, and we
weren't able to get enough kills out of the out
side and opposite hitting positions to get our
selves in position to win."
"1 thought they were a little bit better than
what we had seen on tape, and they are basi
cally comparable to teams in our league,"
Kosty said. "I think they are ranked about
where they should be. They definitely have
the tools to win some big matches this sea
son."
The Cardinal scored the first point of Fri
day's match on a Williams kill and led by as
many as three before the Mastodons came
back to tie the game and then build a three
point lead of their own at the halfway point.
Stanford closed the gap and tied the game at
17. but the Mastodons pulled ahead for good
with a service ace at 27-26.
Stanford again won the first point to start
the second on a block by Williams and fresh
man setter Kawika Shoji.The Cardinal's lead
grew to four and that advantage held until 15-
11. But the Mastodons charged back with
four straight points to tie the game.The score
