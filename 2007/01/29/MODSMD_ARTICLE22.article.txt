Friday's article "Israel misuses
I lolocaust. Finkelstein insists." mis
takenly omitted the entirety of a
quote from sophomore Jessica
Cornwell. Hie quote should have
run as:"l loved it. On a purely factu
al level, it was very compelling, espe
cially from a human ri ''its perspec
tive. 1 thought it was very enlighten
ing and balanced."
