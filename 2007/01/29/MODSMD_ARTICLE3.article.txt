### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It hailed in Palo Alto yesterday, drenching mem
bers of the Sixth Man Club who waited outside Maples
Pavilion for the gates to open. But fans had to wait
until the second half before they saw Cardinal shots
raining in.
Stanford shot 70 percent in the second half to upset
the No. 3 Bruins 75-68 last night. The Cardinal
outscored UCLA. 50-31. in the period.
"We beat a pretty good team "Cardinal head coach
Trent Johnson said. "We kept our composure, and we
kept fighting. We're pretty excited."
Stanford made its comeback after getting washed
out in the first half. UCLA went on a 27-10 run late in
that period, aided in large pat t by six fast-break layups
off Cardinal turnovers and the slick shooting of Arron
Afflalo, who scored 17 points in the lirst half but only
five in the second on two-for-11 shooting.
