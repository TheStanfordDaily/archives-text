### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It hailed in Palo Alto yesterday, drenching mem
bers of the Sixth Man Club who waited outside Maples
Pavilion for the gates to open. But fans had to wait
until the second half before they saw Cardinal shots
raining in.
Stanford shot 70 percent in the second half to upset
the No. 3 Bruins 75-68 last night. The Cardinal
outscored UCLA. 50-31. in the period.
"We beat a pretty good team "Cardinal head coach
Trent Johnson said. "We kept our composure, and we
kept fighting. We're pretty excited."
Stanford made its comeback after getting washed
out in the first half. UCLA went on a 27-10 run late in
that period, aided in large pat t by six fast-break layups
off Cardinal turnovers and the slick shooting of Arron
Afflalo, who scored 17 points in the lirst half but only
five in the second on two-for-11 shooting.

ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
A SHOCKER: Senior forward Fred Washington goes up at Maples in Stanford's victory over
UCLA. The Bruins lost for just the second time this season as Stanford scored 50 second-half points.
"They like to run him off a lot of
screens." senior forward Fred Wash
ington said of Afflalo, who used
screens to create separation in the
first half. "1 tried to get physical and
bump him more, to stay on the inside
and be tough with him [in the second
half]."
Stanford (14-5,6-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference) went on a commanding 3:37
run in the second half to take a stun
ning lead. The 15-0 run gave the Car
dinal a 59-51 lead with 6:28 remaining.
Typical of the Cardinal's do-no
wrong second-half performance, the
team took its first lead of the game
when sophomore forward Lawrence
Hill banked in a three-pointer after
Stanford had managed to keep a
loose ball alive on offense. Hill tied
the game on the previous possession
with a jumper from the free-throw
line that rattled in.
In the second half, the Cardinal
used the Bruins' best weapon against
them, forcing turnovers and running
on the break. After his three-pointer.
Hill converted a fast-break layup on
Stanford's next possession after a
steal by Mitch Johnson. On the fol
lowing play. Washington took an out
let pass after an Afflalo air-ball, made
a layup and took a foul for a three
point play.
UCLA (18-2.7-2) closed the gap to
five with a minute remaining, but the
Bruins missed their final five shots.
I lill finished the night with a team
high 22 points. Seventeen of them
came in the second half, when he
made all six of his field goal tries. 1 le
went to work after Bruin power for
ward Luc-Richard Mbah a Moute
picked up his fourth foul with just
under 10 minutes left.
"I lonestly, I just blacked out," I lill
said of his six-for-six shooting in the

period. "1 know when the play is de
signed for scoring and I have an op
portunity to get it in. ITiat's my focus.
Whatever works."
Sophomore guard Anthony
Goods scored 16 of his 20 points in the
second half. I le hit a three with 10:38
remaining to shrink the Bruin lead to
five.
"We just kept attacking and trying
to get to the hole." (Joods said. "And
we stayed dedicated on the defensive
end."
An unorthodox substitution at the
end of the first half kept the Cardinal
alive as they headed into the second
period, as Trent Johnson sent little
used Carlton Weatherby and Kenny
Brown into the game. With Stanford
down, 37-20. Weatherby made a short
jumper on a put-back. He then
grabbed a missed jumper by UCLA's
Darren Collison on the other end and
passed to Brown, who hit a three as
the half expired and brought the Car
dinal within 12.
"Being down by 12 sounds so
much better than being down by 17,"
Washington said."When you're down
by 17. you go into the half thinking,
'crap.' When you're down by 12, that
sounds doable."
'Ihe Cardinal came out gunning in
the second half. Washington made a
layup and then grabbed a steal to ini
tiate a fast-break on the next posses
sion. Alter a Collison layup. Washing
ton threw an alley-oop to freshman
Robin Lopez to bring the Cardinal
within nine. TTiey kept chipping away
at the lead until the 10-minute mark,
when sophomore Mitch Johnson
made two tree throws to bring Stan
ford within five and spark the 15-0
run.

eight typified Stanford's second-half
performance. Collison stole the hall
from Johnson in the backcourt and
seemed poised to score, but Johnson
stole it back and threw an outlet pass
to 11 ill for a fast-break layup.
After the game, Trent Johnson
tried to put the win in perspective.

"These kids have to get up and go
to school tomorrow." he said. "They
have a practice at 3:30 to get ready for
a game against a very good team on
Wednesday."
That team is Gonzaga (14-7, 5-1
West Coast Conference). The game
will tip off at S p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
