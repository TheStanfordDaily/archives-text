## Eluding extermination efforts, bedbugs reappear 
### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
Despite an exhaustive effort by
the Stanford Housing Service to ex
terminate the bedbugs that plagued
Alondra in the fall, the unwelcome
pests have resurfaced in the Mo
re nee Moore Hall dorm.

On Friday, all the rooms in Alon
dra were examined for bedbugs, and
an infestation was discovered in a
third-floor room. The discovery of
the blood-feeding insects was the
first on the third floor, after bedbugs
attacked more than half a dozen sec
ond-floor rooms in December.
" ITicy did a check a couple of

days ago. and they found just one
bug in the room," said Garner
Kropp. a freshman resident of the in
fested room. "Now. they are proba
bly going to take out all the carpet
ing, put in new beds, put in new furni
ture and then repaint the walls."
The check for bedbugs on Friday
followed a more comprehensive in

vestigation during winter break,
when exterminators conducted a
thorough walk-through of Alondra
and destroyed all furniture and stu
dent belongings suspected to have
been infested by the pests.The win
tor break examination was motivat
ed by the discovery of bedbugs in
several student rooms in early De
cember. a discovery that forced the
temporary relocation of several
students to various dorms across
campus.
At this point, however, bedbugs
have only been found in one room,
and the two dislocated students —
Kroppand fellow freshman Leonard
Parker — have been moved to the
guest lounge in the Alondra base
ment. Kropp expressed relief that he
was not relocated outside the dorm
and took the move to the new room
in stride.
"It's still Alondra, so it's not that
bad." he said."lt's a little secluded,so
I'm probably getting a little more
work done."
