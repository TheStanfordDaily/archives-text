# Autopsy leaves questions unanswered
## Authorities stick to suicide scenario in death of graduate student 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
She drove ( X) miles north to Santa Rosa, parked at a junior college and got
into the trunk of her own car â€” all in order to take her own lite. At least that's
the story authorities are giving for the death of electrical engineering doctoral
student Mengyao "May" Zhou, 23.
The Sonoma ( ounty Coroner's ()ffice performed an autopsy Friday,finding
"no outward signs of trauma to the body."The autopsy was also unsuccessful in
determining a preliminary cause of death.
Officials say it will take several weeks, possibly even a month, before other,

more conclusive lab tests can
be completed. One of the
planned tests is a toxicology
screening, which will deter
mine whether any foreign
substances were present in
Zhou's body at the time of
her death.
Until new evidence comes
to light, authorities appear to
be sticking to their suicide
theory.
"No new information has
been developed that would
lead investigators to believe
foul play is involved," the
Santa Rosa police depart
ment said in a press release
Friday. Santa Rosa authori- I
ties, the lead investigators on |
the case, added that they are
still interviewing people who |
might have more informa- j
tion.
Investigators, however,
continue to leave many press
ing questions unanswered.
While police have said
that items found in the trunk
"indicate the subject may
have committed suicide," they
have so far refused to provide

Sergeant Lisa Banayat briefed the press after
police discovered Mengyao "May" Zhou's
body on Thursday in the trunk of her car
parked at Santa Rosa Junior College.
further details regarding that evi
dence. Nor have they offered any ex
planation for why Zhou's car was
found an hour and a half north of
campus or why Zhou would drive to
Santa Rosa Junior College in the first
place.
Details about Zhou's car render
the case even more perplexing. Police
found Zhou's body in the trunk of her
2<X)d Toyota Corolla. But according
to Toyota, all 2006 Corollas are
equipped with a glow-in-the-dark
"Internal Trunk Safety Handle,"
which allow the trunk to be opened
from the inside in the case of emer
gencies.
Four days after the discovery of
Zhou's body, it is also unclear how
much Santa Rosa and Stanford law
enforcement are cooperating on the
case.
"All we did was take the missing
person's report,"said Marissa.a Stan
ford Police dispatcher who refused to
nive her last name.

Other officials at Santa Rosa and
Stanford could not be reached for
comment over the weekend.
Meanwhile, Zhou's father, who
said that he found out about the dis
covery of his daughter's car from a
reporter and not from law enforce
ment, has questioned the suicide
theory. His daughter, he says, was
planning to edit her resume with
him over the weekend she went
missing.
"If you're thinking about your re
sume, why would you be thinking
about suicide?" Yitong Zhou asked in
an interview with the San Jose Mer
cury News. "I don't believe it. I don't
believe it."
Zhou also said that his daughter
conducted some "unusual" banking
transactions before her disappear
ance. but he did not elaborate on the
details.
Zhou was a second-year doctoral
candidate in electrical engineering.
She was reported missing last Sunday
by her roommate, and her body was
discovered Thursday in Santa Rosa.
Friends who knew Zhou described
her as a "driven" and hardworking
student and expressed shock upon
hearing the news ol her death.
