# Autopsy leaves questions unanswered
## Authorities stick to suicide scenario in death of graduate student 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
She drove ( X) miles north to Santa Rosa, parked at a junior college and got
into the trunk of her own car â€” all in order to take her own lite. At least that's
the story authorities are giving for the death of electrical engineering doctoral
student Mengyao "May" Zhou, 23.
The Sonoma ( ounty Coroner's ()ffice performed an autopsy Friday,finding
"no outward signs of trauma to the body."The autopsy was also unsuccessful in
determining a preliminary cause of death.
Officials say it will take several weeks, possibly even a month, before other,

more conclusive lab tests can
be completed. One of the
planned tests is a toxicology
screening, which will deter
mine whether any foreign
substances were present in
Zhou's body at the time of
her death.
Until new evidence comes
to light, authorities appear to
be sticking to their suicide
theory.
"No new information has
been developed that would
lead investigators to believe
foul play is involved," the
Santa Rosa police depart
ment said in a press release
Friday. Santa Rosa authori- I
ties, the lead investigators on |
the case, added that they are
still interviewing people who |
might have more informa- j
tion.
Investigators, however,
continue to leave many press
ing questions unanswered.
While police have said
that items found in the trunk
"indicate the subject may
have committed suicide," they
have so far refused to provide
