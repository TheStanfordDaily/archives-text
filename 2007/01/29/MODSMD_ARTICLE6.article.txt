### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Four first-year Stanford Law
School students received Top Attor
ney Awards at the I ourth Annual Bay
Area Mock Trial Invitational, which
was hosted by the Stanford Law
School Mock Trial program this
weekend. In team performance, UC-
I Listings took first place, followed by
UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall, while two
Stanford Law School teams rounded
out the top four.
Ilie fact that the four students
Alisha Beltramo, Amanda Bonn,
Scott Noveck and Casey McC'racken
are all in their first year was en
couraging to (lie team's leaders.
"We are thrilled with the results,"
said second-year law student Jeremy
Presscr, Stanford Law School Mock

Trial president. "The fact that Stan
ford received half Of all the Top Attor
ney Awards given out and all the re
cipients are lLs says so much about
the future of our organization."
1 our teams from the Stanford Law
School competed in the two-day com
petition against teams from the law
schools of Georgetown, University of
Wisconsin, UC-Hastings, UC-Berke
ley and the University of San Diego.
Iliis year's invitational marked the
first in which two non-California
schools participated and the event
was held over two days instead of one.
()vcr 50 Bay Area attorneys served as
judges during the competition to
share their experience and expertise.
" Iliis tournament provides a great
way for students to interact with Bay
Area attorneys and for attorneys to
hone up on their own trial skills,"
Presser said."lt is also a great way for
Stanford Law School Mock Trial par
ticipants to test themselves against
other law schools from around the country."
TTiis year s civil case involved a fr7-year-ol<J woman
who claimed that she was sideswiped by a truck driver,
who in turn alleged that he careened into a dump truck
as a result ot the elderly lady not allowing him to pass
her vehicle. While she acknowledged that she enjoyed
the intriguing case and the opportunity to practice trial
advocacy, second-year law student Crystal Tindell said
the best part about participating in mock trial was her
teammates.
"Working closely with three incredible people while
working to develop case themes and figure out how to
nail down facts in a cross-examination is what keeps me
in the program." said Tindell. who helped organized the
tournament and competed as a team captain.
Stanford's Mock Trial teams featured first- and sec
ond-year students, even though most schools limited
team participation to second- and third-years. One of
the Law School's teams was composed entirely of first
year students.
"We feel that forcing first-year students to the side
lines would be a waste of their talent." Presser said.
"Stanford is fortunate to have some of the brightest and
most ambitious law students in the country, and it would
be nearsighted to believe that lLs will be ineffective
contributors simply because they haven't completed the
first-year curriculum."
In mid-February, two teams from Stanford Law
School will participate in a regional mock trial competi
tion run by the Texas Young Lawyers Association in San
Francisco, and in early March, two teams will take part
in another regional competition, hosted by the Ameri
can Association for Justice in Santa Monica. Depending
on their performances in the regional tournaments, the
teams may qualify for the national finals to be held in
the spring.
