## It's not better than yours 
### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION MILKSHAKER 
I .ocated on Hmerson Street in downtown
Palo Alto, the Peninsula Fountain and Grill
(also known as the Creamery) looks like your
typical, fun diner. However, don't expect to find
typical diner costs at this restaurant. And, to be
completely honest, don't expect to find that
spectacular oi food.
F or $5.25 a milkshake (and 60 cents extra if
you want whipped cream). and $W. 75 for a burg
er (not even including fries), the prices are. sim
ply put.outrageous, especially for a casual diner.
1 veil though the milkshakes do taste really
good, they are only worth the price if you share
it with another person (they are big enough to
do so). I would suggest the Oreo milkshake or
peanut butter cup milkshake because they have
a little more pizzazz to them than plain choco
late or strawberry ones, which you can get at
McDonald's for much cheaper.
In regards to the actual food at the diner,
nothing is special. The BBQ burger was just
okay, and it was quite the pathetic scene to see

a big plate with only a burger on it. At least
some chips or even a pickle would have been
nice. In addition, there seemed to be a mis
placed entree on the menu: $177 for a burger
and wine. Who comes to a diner to spend $177?
All of the other food we tried was either just
okay or bad. The Reuben sandwich was
mediocre; there is not much to say about it. The
apple pie. although huge in size, came to the
table without any ice cream (as advertised),
and it actually made my friend feel sick after
wards. The worst thing we ordered was the
turkey chili. It sounded delicious and it seemed

as though a diner would he the perfect place to
order chili, hut it was the worst chili I have ever
tried. The chili was completely watered down
and the only things that made it resemble nor
mal chili were the beans and turkey chunks
swimming around.
I hate to say only completely negative com
ments. but the service was not up to par either.
When we wanted more water, it never came.
When we wanted ice cream with our apple pie,
there was no one to ask. Thus, although the at
mosphere was fun (music, 60s vibe), 1 would
suggest the dining halls over this restaurant.
There are plenty of other places in Palo Alto
where your money can be better spent.
We all crave comfort food at one point or an
other. and at first glace, this place seems like it
would be a winner. But. don't be mistaken by
the 60s decor and diner style tables. Unless you
only want a milkshake (and are willing to cough
up $5.25 for one), the Peninsula Fountain and
Grill is not a place to go for comfort food 1 low
can food be comforting when it takes a chunk
out of your wallet and does not even come close
to tasting like something Mom would make?
