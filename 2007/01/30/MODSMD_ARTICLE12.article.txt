## Manorexia is the new pink 
### 
I love to eat. I love devouring scrumptious
greased-up slices of Round Table Pizza,
smattered with spicy red peppers. I like
handfuls of goldfish, slabs of bacon and hot
slices of soft bread dipped in oil and vinegar.
1 like five course meals, mussels and prawns
and Caesar salad and New York Strip
(medium-well, crunchy) and something
drowning in chocolate. 1 love eating. I could
n't imagine living any other way.
Then my body screwed me, the Judas.
We had a deal: 1 stuff it full of several
food pyramids' worth of greasy cheese
bread, reheated spaghetti, breakfast cereal
at midnight and various excesses of beer,
Jamba, coffee and those crack-addict Late
Night chicken tenders; my body runs it all
through the Intestinal Meatgrinder and
keeps me looking slim as a hippie hundred
dollar-bill. To do my body a favor. I'd go to
the gym and slip an apple onto my plate.
We got along great. 1 spent six German
months eating fresh-off-the-spit kebab
meat and didn't gain a pound.
Then 1 came back to Stanford and gained
15.
The simple fact, doctor, is that I live an
unhealthy life. Because Fuzzy Profs are late
sleepers, my classes start after lunch —
which means, despite my best efforts to nor
malize my bio-rhythms, I have only success
fully had breakfast three times in college.
When our Chef has an off-day, 1 brave the
Tresidder sushi. Tabasco is God, and Dr.
Pepper is His Prophet.
1 came to several hypochondriac conclu
sions. One: You should think more about
your diet. Two: Don't worry so much about
your diet.Three:The voice telling you not to
worry is the fat man with the beer gut who
lurks in your esophagus. Four: Be a man. for
Christ's sakes! Five: My god. I'm turning
Manorexic.
Manorexia is the latest fad in teenaged
anxiety, after a decade-long tie between
school shootings and gross obesity. Blame
feminism, gay culture or good-old Ail-
American perfectionism, but men have be
come the new women. We distrust our natu
ral urges; we will have beautiful, thin
corpses.
Girls have it tougher, of course. They al
ways do. Guys don't like the idea of a girl
friend who starves on salad or purges three
meals a day; no. we'd prefer a girl who can
eat a slab of steak — so rare it bleeds on her
pretty little ivory teeth — pound a Bud
weiser, play nine holes of golf, make sweet
rude loud love and never gain an ounce.
Coming as I did from an all boys' school,
my last (and only) experience with girls was
a summer-camp makeout sesh with a Singa
porean ballet dancer. 1 had absolutely no
idea what eating disorders were. I wouldn't
have believed there were eating disorders at
Stanford; after all. isn't our very presence
here proof that we can be judged on our
merits and not our physics?
1 was wrong. It feels like incredibly poor
form of me to press very deeply into this
issue. I know about as much about eating
disorders as I do about menstruation and
the wonders of childbirth: zilch. (Though
men don't have it so super easy. Say "castra
tion" five times fast, giggle while your
boyfriend winces.) But there are eating dis
orders at Stanford. One of my girlfriends
thinks that every girl at Stanford has an eat

ing disorder

I figured I owed it to myself, as a citizen
of the world and a frenetic overanalyzer, to
learn a bit more about anorexia. Ignorance
is acceptance. A helpful wikipedia entry
sent me to a pro-ana Web site, a charmingly
apocalyptic support forum for anorexics
that will give you eye twitches and night ter
rors. Along with advertising helpful starva
tion regimens like "2-4-6-8" or "The Cab
bage Soup" diet (Cabbage Soup goes well
with everything, as long as "everything" is
bananas and green tea) and "thinspiration"
galleries (Nicole Richie has successfully
mixed coke-chic with heroin-chic, discover
ing "strung out on crystal meth starving in
the desert" chic), the Web site had a whole
laundry list of exhortations in epigram
form."Craving is only a feeling." "ITiin has a
taste all its own" and"The greasy fry. it can
not lie, its truth is written on your thigh."
which sounds like the worst scolding nurs
ery rhyme Mary Poppins never sang. Mean
while. Jesus wept.
What's interesting about these Web sites
— and immortally disturbing — is the
proud tone of self-actualization: 1 am ana,
hear me roar. Hie girls who post on the mes
sage boards seem to vaguely understand
that what they're doing is unhealthy,but for
a better body, they've made peace with the
side effects. 'ITiere's almost a jockish tone:
"If it was easy then everybody would do it."
Body image as competition, the Great
Game of Beauty. It reminds me of the gutter
camaraderie you find among cigarette
smokers — they know smoking's bad. and
they like it. It also reminds me of a choice
one of my athlete friends had to make after
his third or fourth knee surgery: Keep play
ing, make it to the pros and get metal knees
at 40; or quit without glory and teach the
kids how to play soccer.
I am a fraternity boy who has written at
least two puppydog articles about falling in
love (or at least deeply religious lust) with
pretty girls at first sight — both girls, I real
ize in hindsight, were thin. So any accusa
tion or moral judgment I could make would
be worth half a damn. Someone told me
that not eating becomes an addiction, and
in life, you have to choose your addictions:
Which ones you control, which ones control
you. I wonder about Stanford, though. Are
body image issues so pervasive in American
society that even here, at our intellectual
city on a hill, they seep in? Or does it go
even deeper? Does something within this
academic environment — the type-A per
sonalities. the perfectionism, the obsession
with appearing so much less busy then we
are — does it support disorder? Don't you
want everyone to see how beautiful your
mind is?
