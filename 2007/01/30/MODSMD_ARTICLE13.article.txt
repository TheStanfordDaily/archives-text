## No more waiting: Holding the university to its word 
### ALEXANDRA GOLDMAN 
The release of the December 2006
"Progress Report" by Human Resources
(HR) marks the conclusion of a process that
began nearly four years ago with the imple
mentation of the Living Wage Policy for Sub
contracted Workers in April 2003 and the for
mation of the Presidential Advisory Commit
tee on Workplace Policies (PAC) in May of
that year. After the fast that forced the cre
ation of the PAC. we waited for half a year for
the PAC to convene, another half a year before
they released their report, another half a year
for the president to respond and now nearly
two years later we finally see the fall-out from
the struggle of those students and workers. On
the issue of the living wage, the University has
managed to maintain the empty policy while
claiming publicly to have "accepted most of
the recommendations of the PAC" But now
the period of good-faith waiting is now over,
and the time has come once again to make de
mands. Every member of the Stanford Com
munity should stand up to demand a real living
wage policy — which is, very simply, to hold
the University to its word.
If President Hennessy left the living
wage for dead in his noncommittal 2005 re
sponse, then HR killed it with their recent
"update." Director of HR Diane Peck at
tempted to bury it in deceptions. Unrepen
tant in her reliance on misleading rhetoric,
Peck defended HR's response, claiming a
Daily article ("Students Occupy President
Hennessy s Office." Jan. 22) that the high
number of yearly applicants for jobs here re
flects Stanford's status as a great employer.
Ix't's not forget that in this curiously utilized
quote she is referring to Stanford's directly
hired, permanent workforce — who receive

a real living wage and the same benefits as
faculty The living wage policy in question,
on the other hand, concerns workers who
are not hired by Stanford, but who are con
tracted to do work for Stanford through
other employers, meaning that the number
of applications to Stanford and all the com
bined enthusiasm of all those directly-hired
workers fully irrelevant. We're talking about
different groups of people, and Peck's has
nothing to do with the discussion of the liv
ing wage for subcontracted workers.
To be honest, we are baffled. Because
Peck, of all people, should know the work
force in question. Hie PAC. which she co
chaired, couldn't definitively find any single
contracted worker who was covered by the
living wage policy, and for all their research,
discovered that Stanford knows next to
nothing about the contracted workforce. It's
as though Stanford wants to pretend these
workers don't even exist, much less deserve
a living wage. Let's just continue to pat our
selves on the back and pretend that every
thing, including the palm trees (which, by
the way. cost more than a workers yearly
wage), reflect how great things really are.
Are the workers who clean our academ
ic facilities, for instance, who are unionized
under SEIU and subcontracted through
ABM. and thus disqualified from the living
wage policy, really that invisible? ITiis is
why we need a living wage policy: because
the University, like so many corporations,
distances itself from responsibility for these
subcontracted workers who do some of the
most vital work to sustain the campus and
receive wages and benefits far below those
given to the workers Diane Peck boasts of.
So let's take a look at one key
issue that HR addressed, the living
wage policy for subcontracted
workers: on the issue of the living
wage, HR was asked to consider
eliminating five of the seven restric
tions that keep it from applying to
any workers — the PAC said that
three of these (limiting the size and
scope of contracts to which the liv
ing wage applies) should be elimi
nated outright, a fourth (limiting
the living wage to non-union work
ers) if it was found to be legal to do
so, and a fifth (restricting the appli
cability to tenant businesses on
Stanford land) only after an investi

gation of the costs and benefits. De
spite the PAC's recommendations
and careful research, HR refused to
eliminate any of the first three on
the basis of an unspecified (and ap
parently uncalculated) increase in
costs that would result — a factor
which was obviously already taken
into account, and with more diverse
input, by the PAC when they made
their recommendations. HR failed
to eliminate the fourth restriction
without even addressing the ques
tion of its legality, with which they
were charged (they just said that,
based on their own opinion, it
would be "inappropriate"). And
they failed to address the fifth re
striction at all.
Now that the fallout from the fast
and the PAC report is concluded and
revealed, we can forget about HR.
They just did what they were sup

posed to: maintained the status quo
whereby no subcontracted workers
get a living wage. Attention needs to
be turned back to President Hen
nessy, who must make real commit
ments and real change, not just
vague —or else downright decep
tive — agreements whose effect gets
lost in bureaucracy.That old process
is done, the time for waiting is over,
and it's now time for renewed hope
and renewed struggle.This time, stu
dents and workers should satisfy
themselves with nothing less than
substantial, comprehensive and
transparent labor policy reform, that
won't get killed by bureaucracy and
then buried by administration's rhet
oric.
