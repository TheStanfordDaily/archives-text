# All day breakfast
## 
### 
I go to bed late and 1 wake up early, very
early. It's a rare day that I'm not awake
past midnight, and an even rarer one that
I'm still asleep at six.
This, sadly, is not a result of a Clintonesque
ability to survive without snooze. No, my
sleep deprivation is mostly driven by a desire
not to waste time that could be better spent
pretending to work.
Now. I understand my dozing habits aren 't
particularly interesting to most people (or, in
fact, to any people), but as 1 was contemplat
ing my time earlier this week. I came up with
a rather puzzling puzzle: Where does it all
go?
Each of my days consists of around Hi or
18 hours of open eye time. Yet said eyes don't
seem to see very much during said open time.
Or to put it another way: 1 do nothing.
Actually, that's not quite true. 1 do an
awful lot: I just achieve nothing. It's not clear
to me exactly how this happens. I get to work.
1 sit at my desk and then... well, it's a mystery.
Many hours after I leave my bed. 1 return to
it with nothing to show for my time away
from the duvet.
1 don't understand where all these hours
go. More accurately, 1 don't want to under
stand — I suspect facing up to my apathy
would be a traumatic experience (not least of
all for my research advisor).
Still, despite my deep-seated reluctance to
explore this problematic aspect of my per
sonality. I've recently been changing my
mind and trying to figure out precisely what

magical forces are at work each day, stealing
my time away and gnawing at my sanity.
And, you know, 1 think I've got it. I may be
up for hours, but. really, I never get past
breakfast.
I spend from morning to night in the
mindset of one who is about to start a full day
of work. Perpetually on the edge of a begin
ning. always preparing to start and never ac
tually getting anything done.
My suspicion is that this disease is not just
restricted to me. An inability to get started is
a common human (and graduate student)
flaw.
It is amazing just how much better one can
feel, simply through the judicious and ex
tended application of preparation. Lots of
preparation.
The key is that once one is set to begin
work, the guilt is gone (or at least, shoved
back into the dark corner of your mind
whence it came). That awful,churning feeling
of fear mixed with bile attenuates, and one
can concentrate on wasting time surfing the
Internet.

And this is what my life comes down to.
1 wake up. 1 get out of bed. Shower. Fix my
hair. Drive to school. Settle in at my desk.
And. then, so happy I am at this string of in
credible achievement. 1 take the rest of the
day off.
It is a popular counsel that one should re
ward oneself for small successes; presumably
the theory is that all this positive reinforce
ment is an aid to personal progress, to getting
more done.
In my experience, existence doesn't quite
work like that. Instead, the natural tendency
of human beings to do nothing means that we
use "rewards" as an excuse to do. well, noth
ing.
I suspect that this "lazy start to the day ap
proach" to life is not restricted to graduate
school; not getting things done in the morn
ing is probably a relatively universal syn
drome. On the other hand, in real jobs, peo
ple have deadlines and actual things to do. So,
even if they start late, they will eventually get
it done.
We, however, have no "it"and. thus, can
perpetually wait until tomorrow. Which is
pretty much equivalent to never doing any
thing.
Now. it's about time for my midmorning
bagel, so 1 must dash — long day of doing
nothing and pretending to do something
ahead.
