# Op-Ed
## Cease fire 
### TIM GREGORY 
As a proud member of the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East (CJME). I have
watched on in silence and horror for the last
few weeks as my fellow activists and friends
have been viciously and rudely attacked time
and time again on campus and specifically in
this publication. In almost all cases. 1 have
seen them respond with respectful, academic
discourse while the subsequent rebuttals are
delivered with ever increasing vitriol. This
kind of childish point-counter-point is re
sponsible for the unpleasant atmosphere that
has tainted campus communities which try to
engage with these issues. It must end. This
Op-Ed is written on behalf of CJME: I will
not speak about SCAI because 1 am not a
member of that organization and. although
our pleas have thus far been ignored. I would
ask once again that the reader draws a clear
distinction between the two groups.
First of all. let me make one thing very
clear: It is offensive to suggest that CJME's
members are anti-Semitic and absurd to ask
that they defend themselves against this
charge. Yesterday. Mishan Araujo ("Calling
SCAI's bluff') asked that we come up with a
different term to describe the nature of our
Israel-focused events. A recurring theme of
these events is discontentment with certain

Israeli government policies. Would that suf
fice? When activists of all political and racial
stripes criticize President Bush's justification
for the war in Iraq, or the American intelli
gence services' use of torture. I would hope
that enlightened students at prestigious uni
versities could avoid vilifying them as anti-
American.
If you are still unconvinced, please feel
free to attend a CJME meeting. These take
place every Sunday at 8 p.m. at Tresidder.
Last night, the group featured great ethnic
and religious variety. For a more inaccurate
and xenophobic view,see Roehi Kashi's love
ly use of the words "Arab" and "Muslim" in
yesterday's Daily ("Violence must end").
This brings me to my second point: CJME's
programming is. frankly, the business of sole
ly those dedicated individuals who pour their
time and commitment into setting up inform
ative events for the Stanford public. It is true
that fall quarter was more focused on the Is
rael-Palestine issue than usual. 'ITiese were
the events that came to the attention of the
group and that were feasible at the time.
Fhose dissatisfied with our programming will
be pleased (and humbled) to know that in the
coming weeks and months, CJME will be
hosting a terrific student theater piece about
the effects of war, the premiere of a Stanford
produced film on America's use of torture

and a talk on accountability and human
rights abuses in the Arab world.
And if Stanford Israel Alliance or the
Jewish Students Association thinks that
these events were prompted by their barrage
of unjustified criticism, please think again.
May I remind you that last year CJME made
possible a wonderful discussion of Iran's nu
clear program and the visit of renowned
British journalist Robert Fisk. These events
and those that are currently in planning have
long been on our agenda because CJME
members are diverse and interesting people
who have persisted in spite of these attacks.
If there is an issue that relates to social jus
tice in the region that you feel has not re
ceived deserved attention, please feel free to
bring it up at one of our meetings. If you
identify strongly with Israel as a country and
Israelis as a people, then I would suggest you
concentrate your efforts on ending the occu
pation and establishing a two-state solution
rather than verbally abusing those with
whom you may disagree on one or two cos
metic issues.
