## Facilities drops the soccer ball 
### 
It's no secret that the typical
American hates soccer. Okay,
perhaps that's a bit too judgmen
tal. Let's try this: The typical Ameri
can does not understand soccer.
Therefore, the typical American will
most likely hate soccer before giving
it a shot.
Now you may be reading this and
be saying to yourself, "What are you
talking about? 1 love the global
game!" Well, while I sympathize
with you. my brethren, I'm sorry to
say that we are in the minority.
Major League Soccer — the US'
premier soccer league — has report
edly lost more than $350 million
since its inception in 1996. Debate
regarding the league's future is ram
pant. With the recent expansion into
Toronto combined with the con
struction of several new soccer-ex
clusive stadiums, many think we
could be entering a "Golden Age" of
soccer in the U.S.
On the other hand, the recent
signing of international superstar
David Beckham to the Los Angeles
Galaxy for $250 million over five
years leads many to believe that the
MLS is making the same mistakes as
its predecessor, the North American
Soccer League. Overexpansion and
huge contracts to aging players cost
the league millions, forcing it to fold
in 1984 after just 14 years. Beck
ham's signing is also sure to raise
ticket prices, alienating the modest
fans on whom the sport is built.
I can't completely blame the U.S.
for its lack of interest in soccer. After
all, fans can't help but be attracted to
the country's strong talent in basket
ball. hockey, baseball and American
football. Unlike other nations that
dedicate almost 100 percent of their
athletically gifted to soccer, the U.S.
must divide its best athletes between
a myriad of sports. There is little
doubt that the U.S. would be the
world's frontrunner in soccer if our
nation's best athletes were solely in
vested in that one game.
And thus soccer continues to be
looked down upon in the States.
Which brings me to my main point
— the story of me. my friends and
soccer.

come together at any time of day to
play a pick-up game on the fields
separating Stern Hall from Wilbur.
But with the beginning of the
Munger project came the demoli
tion of the fields "twixt the halls, as
well as Wilbur field. Stanford, look
ing out for its students like always,
was sure to build a basketball court
adjacent to the newly-built parking
lot lying atop what was once our soc
cer field. Great for students who
love basketball, but what about the
rest of us?
We were left with little choice but
to play nightly indoor soccer at the
Ford Center. And it was fun for a
while — until the security guards
unjustly started kicking us out.
It seemed like they had a differ
ent excuse each time. First they told
us that we weren't allowed to wear
black-soled shoes. And since a mi
nority of us were wearing that par
ticular kind of footwear, apparently
none of us were allowed to play.
Funny. I'd never seen a basketball
player get told anything for wearing
black-soled shoes.
Soccer players were forced to go
out of their way to obtain permis
sion from the Stanford athletics of
fice to play indoor soccer. While I'm
not saying that it wasn as huge an in
convenience as finding parking in
Berkeley, it is obvious that people
were establishing barriers to our
playing soccer. I thank Stanford
Manager of Events and Scheduling
Kris Becker for eventually allowing
us to play in the San Diego Sports
Hall in Ford. However, we have yet
to hear back from those in charge of
the Arrillaga Center for Sports and
Recreation after being rather rude
ly ejected from the premises a few
weeks ago.
The hassling hasn't stopped.

We've tried playing at multiple ven
ues and fields throughout campus,
and it seems as though there is al
ways some form of personnel trying
to stop us. The responsibility, ac
cording to them, falls on the players
to prove they are allowed to play at
the facility in question.
Because students pay thousands
each year for the use of Stanford's
facilities, the real burden of proof
should be on the ones kicking us off.
However, none of these security
guards has been able to pinpoint the
specific rule prohibiting us from
playing soccer on certain Stanford
facilities. It is completely unfair that
students playing soccer are expect
ed to always carry some sort of writ
ten permission to play on grounds
while security personnel can simply
cite the rule of "because 1 said so."
I can understand some of the ar
guments against allowing soccer in
certain facilities, the biggest of
which being the potential damages
done to locations such as Ford.
However, the damage that can be
done by soccer is not any more
threatening than the damage that
can be suffered due to basketball.
Players run just as much and will
thus scuff up the court just as badly
as in soccer.
It all comes back to a general dis
respect for soccer. I'm certain that
had we been playing basketball or in
door American football, we wouldn't
have been told anything. Heck, I'm
sure we could have flooded the entire
basketball court area to play water
polo without being chastised.
Don't be scared of soccer just be
cause you don't understand it. I'm
not asking you to love the sport; I'm
just asking for a little more respect
— at least enough respect to allow
"real football" players the same
rights afforded to basketball players
when it comes to the use of facilities.
Que viva el Tricolor!
