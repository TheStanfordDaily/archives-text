It's no secret that the typical
American hates soccer. Okay,
perhaps that's a bit too judgmen
tal. Let's try this: The typical Ameri
can does not understand soccer.
Therefore, the typical American will
most likely hate soccer before giving
it a shot.
Now you may be reading this and
be saying to yourself, "What are you
talking about? 1 love the global
game!" Well, while I sympathize
with you. my brethren, I'm sorry to
say that we are in the minority.
Major League Soccer — the US'
premier soccer league — has report
edly lost more than $350 million
since its inception in 1996. Debate
regarding the league's future is ram
pant. With the recent expansion into
Toronto combined with the con
struction of several new soccer-ex
clusive stadiums, many think we
could be entering a "Golden Age" of
soccer in the U.S.
On the other hand, the recent
signing of international superstar
David Beckham to the Los Angeles
Galaxy for $250 million over five
years leads many to believe that the
MLS is making the same mistakes as
its predecessor, the North American
Soccer League. Overexpansion and
huge contracts to aging players cost
the league millions, forcing it to fold
in 1984 after just 14 years. Beck
ham's signing is also sure to raise
ticket prices, alienating the modest
fans on whom the sport is built.
I can't completely blame the U.S.
for its lack of interest in soccer. After
all, fans can't help but be attracted to
the country's strong talent in basket
ball. hockey, baseball and American
football. Unlike other nations that
dedicate almost 100 percent of their
athletically gifted to soccer, the U.S.
must divide its best athletes between
a myriad of sports. There is little
doubt that the U.S. would be the
world's frontrunner in soccer if our
nation's best athletes were solely in
vested in that one game.
And thus soccer continues to be
looked down upon in the States.
Which brings me to my main point
— the story of me. my friends and
soccer.
Life used to be wonderful in Casa
Zapata. Football (and 1 mean real
