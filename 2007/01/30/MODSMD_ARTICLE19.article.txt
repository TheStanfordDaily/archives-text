# Card clench exhibition win over Menlo
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
It may not have counted for much beyond
pride and practice, but wrestling notched an
exhibition victory over the NAIA's No. 11
Menlo College this past Saturday. At the Ford
Center, in front of a home crowd that included
new football coach Jim Harbaugh and Athlet

ic Director Bob Bowlsby, the Cardinal put
forth another solid showing, winning 29-14. as
the team heads into the heart of its Pac-10 sea
son.
I"he match was originally slated to be a reg
ular-season dual meet, but when the official
failed to arrive at the Ford Center, the dual had
to be postponed. When no substitute could be
found on short notice, an exhibition was wres

tied instead. Although Stanford head coach
Kerry McCoy was disappointed that the win
won't count in his team's official record, he was
nevertheless pleased with the effort his squad
put forth and the progress he's seen so far.
"It's just unfortunate,because we wanted to
get a win and have a good showing, but realis
tically it's all practice until the conference tour
nament." McCoy said. "But the goal is to go out

and wrestle and get better towards the end of
the year, and the guys did well. We got some
momentum we can continue to build on next
week."
Stanford went into the meet without No. 17
junior Josh Zupaneic at 157 pounds and soph
omore Jared Boyer at l l )7 pounds, both key
starters. Nonetheless, when the match opened
at 125 pounds, it was all business as usual for
the Cardinal, as No. 4 junior Tanner Gardner
got things started in his traditionally dominant
fashion, with a first period pin at 2:27.
Hut after Stanford lost three of its next four
matches, the overall score was tied 11-11. One
particularly difficult loss came as redshirt
freshman Matt Kim, wrestling at 141 pounds,
pulled ahead of his opponent in the closing sec
onds of his match with a takedown,only to lose
seconds later as Menlo's Anthony Cunha an
swered with a quick reversal for the win.
McCoy said that Kim may have been ex
pending too much energy in the first period,
leaving him drained in the crucial end stages of
the match.
"Just like last week, he fought hard, wres
tled with intensity and did all the things we
wanted him to do." McCoy said. "But he just
fell a little bit short. It's going to pay off for him
