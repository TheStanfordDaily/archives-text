# Dark horse chosen for Commencement
## Choice of poet Dana Gioia surprises many seniors, who called for more "political" speaker 
### EMMA VAUGHN SENIOR STAFFS RITER 
Hie surprise choice of Dana Gioia as Com
mencement speaker on Monday had students
scratching their heads and searching Wikipedia for
more information about the poet and chairman of
the National Endowment for the Arts. As Univer
sity and student leaders praised the Bush ap
pointee. immediate reaction from the senior class
was mixed.
"The fact that a lot of us don't know who he is,"
said senior Susan Rodriguez,"is not a good sign."
In related news. President John Hennessy also
announced that former Episcopal Bishop of Cali
fornia Rev. William Swing will serve as this year's
Baccalaureate speaker.
A native Californian of Italian and Mexican de
scent. Gioia received bachelor's and business de
grees from Stanford before earning a masters de
gree in Comparative Literature from Harvard.
In addition to publishing three full-length poet
ry collections, Gioia has contributed to the New
Yorker. Ibe Atlantic, The Washington Post and
The New York Times.
In 2003. he was appointed by President George
Bush as chair of the National Endowment for the
Arts and. earlier this year, received unanimous

confirmation from the senate for his reappoint
ment.
"Dana Gioia's life story is one of an unyielding
thirst for knowledge and relentless dedication to
the art of the written word," I lennessv said in a
statement."His experiences are a testament to the
fact that education is a lifelong journey and that
taking on new challenges, while risky, can open
doors to remarkably rich existence. I believe such
life lessons are of tremendous value for those
about to embark on a new phase of life, and I am
eager to hear his words of wisdom for our graduat
ing students."
Many said that in such a heated political year, it
would have been more pertinent to bring in a figure
with a background in government or foreign affairs.
"1 am impressed with his credentials and his ex
perience," said senior Sasha Buscho. "But given
everything that's going on in the world with the
current war and the upcoming elections, it would
have been more effective to have a political figure
that could inspire us about the present issues."
The call for a political speaker appears strong
on campus, as Senior Shane Walker's Facebook
group "Bill Clinton for Stanford Commencement
Speaker in '07" had attracted 443 members. In an

email to The Daily, Walker expressed
disappointment with the speaker
choice and the University's lack of
transparency.
"Am 1 alone in saying,'that came
out of nowhere?!'" Walker wrote.
"This process just reeks of smoke
from the old backrooms. Open up
the process. Let us know who you
considered, what didn't work, and
why. Additionally, how many nomi
nations did this guy actually receive
from the class (outside of relatives)?
It can't be more than you can count
on one hand."
Senior Mike Lazar expressed dis
belief that Stanford could not exercise

its apparent clout to choose a more
prominent Commencement speaker.
"I'm really surprised that Stan
ford couldn't leverage it's reputation
to find a more prominent and well
known speaker," he said.
Senior Class President Vivek
Agrawal said that while some stu
dents may not be directly familiar
with Gioia's work, the poet's hack
ground in both business and art
would allow him to share a unique
perspective with graduating stu
dents.
"We feel that come commence
ment, he will give a truly memorable
speech," Agrawal said. "He has spo
ken at alumni reunions before and
the audience found him quite per
sonable. He really targeted issues
that people were feeling regarding
life after Stanford."
Some agreed, saying that their

unfamiliarity with Gioia did not
imply that Gioia would be a poor
speaker.
"Even though I haven't heard of
him. he seems incredibly well quali
fied and it also seems like he would
be a good speaker," said senior Tyler
Kirtley."ln the end it comes down to
the message and not the person who
delivers it."
Senior Reena Magsarili said that
she thought Gioia's strong connec
tion to the arts was a good perspec
tive to bring on campus.
"1 definitely feel that Stanford
doesn't focus on the arts that much,
and maybe that's why he presents a
problem as a speaker, because he's
not representative of what the Uni
versity is about," Magsarili said."But
maybe it's also a good reminder to
not forget about that aspect of a lib
eral arts education."
