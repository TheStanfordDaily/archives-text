Hie surprise choice of Dana Gioia as Com
mencement speaker on Monday had students
scratching their heads and searching Wikipedia for
more information about the poet and chairman of
the National Endowment for the Arts. As Univer
sity and student leaders praised the Bush ap
pointee. immediate reaction from the senior class
was mixed.
"The fact that a lot of us don't know who he is,"
said senior Susan Rodriguez,"is not a good sign."

announced that former Episcopal Bishop of Cali
fornia Rev. William Swing will serve as this year's
Baccalaureate speaker.
A native Californian of Italian and Mexican de
scent. Gioia received bachelor's and business de

the art of the written word," I lennessv said in a
statement."His experiences are a testament to the
fact that education is a lifelong journey and that
taking on new challenges, while risky, can open
doors to remarkably rich existence. I believe such
life lessons are of tremendous value for those
about to embark on a new phase of life, and I am
eager to hear his words of wisdom for our graduat

would have been more pertinent to bring in a figure
with a background in government or foreign affairs.

everything that's going on in the world with the
current war and the upcoming elections, it would
have been more effective to have a political figure
that could inspire us about the present issues."

on campus, as Senior Shane Walker's Facebook
group "Bill Clinton for Stanford Commencement
Speaker in '07" had attracted 443 members. In an
