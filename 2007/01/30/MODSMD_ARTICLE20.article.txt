# Evan Romero A CLOSER LOOK
## The
						non-expert spiker "Inexperienced" Romero jumps into volleyball calling 
### BY ROXIE DICKINSON 
The 6-foot-6 opposite for the Stanford men's
volleyball team, Evan Romero, claims that
he is an inexperienced player, learning more
and more about the game with each and
every day."lnexperienced"is hard to believe,
though, especially after Romero's 17 kills in Sunday's
match against IPFW.
Still, Romero remains modest.
"I learn something new every day."he said. "Com
ing here, 1 was pretty raw.The coaches have been pret
ty amazing to me, along with my teammates, who have
been very patient."
I lead coach John Kosty understands the freshman's

wariness, especially
considering his home
background. But, he
does think Romero is
up to the challenge.
"Evan's hometown
of Miami, Florida isn't
where volleyball is
played at the highest
level." Kosty said.
"Many of the guys we
recruit grew up in the
Los Angeles area and
have been playing since
they were twelve years
old. Evan is a dynamic
athlete and what he
lacks in experience, he
exceeds in his heart in
his athleticism."
Romero played soc
cer for most of his ele
mentary- and middle
school years and
switched over to bas
ketball in high school.
With his definite height
advantage, Romero
was soon convinced by
his basketball coach to
switch over to volley
ball. which he coached
as well. Before playing
in high school, Romero
had only played volley
ball at the beach or with
his family, but he never
considered playing for
a team.
"I had fun and want
ed to play volleyball."

Romero said. "It just comes natural to me."
Romero's parents had a hard time losing him to
Stanford, a college over 3,000 miles from Miami. I lis
parents had always supported him when played club
volleyball, though, and they and were happy and
proud that he could use it to get into a school like
Stanford.
On the other side of the country, Romero has found
some great friends in the other four freshmen on the
team. Over the course of the season, whether during
road trips or just at practice, the five of them have de
veloped great chemistry both on and off the court.
"The five of us are like brothers," Romero said." We
have a really close bond with each other, and we all
bring something different to the team. We are all just
doing the freshman thing."
"Evan is our Cuban jumping bean," fellow fresh
man opposite Ed Howell said. "He is a phenomenal
athlete, a great competitor and a good guy."
According to his teammates, Romero is a huge
presence and has earned much respect. Standouts,
however, just become one of the rest when it comes to
the daily practices.Together, the Cardinal is making its
way to its first sea-

son win.
"We have been
progressing
throughout the sea
son." Romero said.
" Hiis year is a year
where we are grow
ing and learning
how to play the
game better. We
have been playing
tough teams and
have been coming
up short by only a
few points. As the
season progresses
we will be a team to
mess with."
Kosty, as much as
he understands
Romero's inexperi
ence, also knows
that the Cardinal
will need Romero
as it develops into
the team it hopes to
become.
"Evan is going to
a big time player for
us." Kosty said. "He
is the type of player
you look for in the
opposite position;
his mentality is to
hit the ball as hard
as you can every
time, which is the
mentality you need
in the Evan's posi
tion.
