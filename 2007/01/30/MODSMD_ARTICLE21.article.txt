## Men crack AP top 25 No. 23 Cardinal ranked for first time this season 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
After upsetting No. 25 USC last
Thursday and shocking No. 3 UCLA
on Sunday, it is no surprise that the
Cardinal is getting a little national
recognition.
Stanford entered the AP Poll for
the first time this season, after stun
ning the Bruins 75-68 in front of a
sold-out crowd at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal earned the No. 23 spot
in this week's poll.
"It is nice to get some national
recognition," sophomore forward
Lawrence Hill said. "It will help re
cruiting and all that. But our next
game [against Gonzaga] is impor
tant. We have to keep the ranking out
of our head."
The Cardinal received votes in
the ESPN/USA Today Poll, but fell
just short of the top 25. Stanford's 28
votes put them in 30th.
""It is good to be ranked, but the
rankings don't really mean much."
sophomore guard Anthony Goods
said. "The only thing that matters is
who can win in March. We just need

to keep winning.
"We've worked hard and we've
beat some good teams," Goods con
tinued. "We've earned the ranking,
but at the same time we can't let it go
to our head."
This week's poll marks the first
time the Cardinal have cracked the
top 25 since the 2(X)5-2006 preseason
poll. Stanford weighed in at No. 13, but
fell out of the rankings after losing to
UC-Irvine in the opening game.
"Hopefully we don't pay a whole
lot of attention to it," head coach
Trent Johnson said. "We can be
happy, but we can't be satisfied. It is
human nature to get caught up by
what is said in the national media.
But we need to remember it is just
January."
Florida retained the top spot in
both polls. UCLA fell to No. 5 in both
polls after Sunday's loss. USC
dropped out of the polls after split
ting its series with the Bay Area
Schools.
The Pac-10 now has five teams in
the AP top 25. Oregon weighs in at
No. 9, Washington State is No. 18 and
Arizona is No. 20.

Freshman forward Brook Lopez was named the Pac-10 Men's Basketball
Player of the Week following a pair of dominant perform-

ances against the L. A. schools.
Lopez opened the week with the first record
ed triple-double in Stanford's history, finish-

ing with 18 points, II rebounds and 12
blocks against the Trojans. 1 lis blocks total
obliterated the previous school record of
six. which was held by his brother Robin

and three others.
"Brook has really improved a lot and it
has been pretty clear how good he

is in practice, Uoods said.
"This week he practiced a lot
harder than normal and
came out against USC with
12 blocks. Then against

UCLA he had some great
rebounds. He's been

amazing, which is really
good to see."

Brook followed up
his career day with a
seven-point, eight-re
bound game against
the Bruins.
"It is a really nice
honor," Brook said.

Honestly. I'm surprised that Lawrence [Mill] didn't get it. I guess my triple
louble overshadowed what he did a little bit."
Brook is the second Stanford player to earn the award this season. Goods
ook home the honor two weeks ago.
Ilns season marks the first time that three different freshman have all won
the award. Arizona's ( hase Budinger and Washington's Spencer

Hawes also took the prize
this season.
Wiggins also Player of the
Week

Junior guard C'andice Wiggins
made it a Stanford sweep of the

Pae-10 Player of the Week awards
by claiming the women's title. Wig-

gins helped the Card to a pair of road wins in Ari
zona.
Her best performance of the week

came on Saturday when she helped Stanford
hold off Arizona State 73-65 win in overtime.
She scored a season-high 30 points, including
10 in the extra period. The game-winning

performance is especially incredible

after Wiggins was out on a sprained
ankle just two weeks ago. She also
a had IS points against the Wildcats

this past Thursday.
It is the fifth time that Wiggins

has won the award in her career
and her second this season. She

was also Pac-10 Player of the Year
for the past two years and the
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year.
