## Men crack AP top 25 No. 23 Cardinal ranked for first time this season 
### ALEX GYR MANAGING EDITOR 
After upsetting No. 25 USC last
Thursday and shocking No. 3 UCLA
on Sunday, it is no surprise that the
Cardinal is getting a little national
recognition.
Stanford entered the AP Poll for
the first time this season, after stun
ning the Bruins 75-68 in front of a
sold-out crowd at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal earned the No. 23 spot
in this week's poll.
"It is nice to get some national
recognition," sophomore forward
Lawrence Hill said. "It will help re
cruiting and all that. But our next
game [against Gonzaga] is impor
tant. We have to keep the ranking out
of our head."
The Cardinal received votes in
the ESPN/USA Today Poll, but fell
just short of the top 25. Stanford's 28
votes put them in 30th.
""It is good to be ranked, but the
rankings don't really mean much."
sophomore guard Anthony Goods
said. "The only thing that matters is
who can win in March. We just need

to keep winning.
"We've worked hard and we've
beat some good teams," Goods con
tinued. "We've earned the ranking,
but at the same time we can't let it go
to our head."
This week's poll marks the first
time the Cardinal have cracked the
top 25 since the 2(X)5-2006 preseason
poll. Stanford weighed in at No. 13, but
fell out of the rankings after losing to
UC-Irvine in the opening game.
"Hopefully we don't pay a whole
lot of attention to it," head coach
Trent Johnson said. "We can be
happy, but we can't be satisfied. It is
human nature to get caught up by
what is said in the national media.
But we need to remember it is just
January."
Florida retained the top spot in
both polls. UCLA fell to No. 5 in both
polls after Sunday's loss. USC
dropped out of the polls after split
ting its series with the Bay Area
Schools.
The Pac-10 now has five teams in
the AP top 25. Oregon weighs in at
No. 9, Washington State is No. 18 and
Arizona is No. 20.
