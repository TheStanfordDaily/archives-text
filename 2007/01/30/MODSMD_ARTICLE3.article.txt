## Former homeless veterans share life experiences Veterans describe post-Vietnam struggles with drugs and stress 
### SAM BHAGWAT STAFF WRITER 
"I lore's a guy that slept in a park, and a year later he's
on his way to Europe!"
That's how Irwin Goodwin described his own journey
from drug addiction and homelessness to his current job
running the Homeless Veteran Emergency Housing Fa
cility (HVEHF) — which houses 200 veterans — to a
group of 15 students last night in a student-initiated
course focusing on veterans' issues.
Goodwin was part of a panel of five speakers that
spoke to the class "A Veteran's Affair: The Biomedical,

Economic, and Social Impact of War." The other speak
ers included two former homeless veterans affiliated
with Goodwin's program. Dr. Lan long — who runs a
homeless van that brings veterans to Goodwin's program
— and an outreach coordinator.
Less than 10 percent of Americans are veterans,Tong
said, but up to 35 percent of homeless people have served
in the Armed Forces. Goodwin said that his struggle with
drug addiction began in the military and motivated him
to initiate the homeless veterans program.
"The reason why I was homeless is because I was doing
drugs, like crack cocaine, heroin and marijuana," Good

Goodwin asked the students in the class to picture him
as a homeless panhandler with dirty pants, who "hadn't
taken a shower in 35 days," approaching them and asking
for money, so that he could go buy drugs. I le said his own
path out of homelessness, which started in 1995, began al

most as an accident.
"I didn't really go to the homeless facility for rehabil
itation," he said. "I went there to get out of the park"
Goodwin recalled one particular jarring incident with
drug addiction.
"I did a bunch of speed and 1 started tweakin' out," he
said. "Then I pulled this flier out of my pocket that I had
for three weeks, and it said 'rehabilitation for homeless
vets.' 1 said.'let me call this place and see what it's really
about. I'm tired of sleeping in the park — let me call this
place and see if 1 can sleep here for a while.'"
Former homeless veteran Duke, who declined to give
his last name, described how post-traumatic stress disor
der had affected his life since the Vietnam War.
"I was in so much pain, but you're a Marine and you
don't show pain," he said. "It took 27 years before I got to a
