ever walk the planet," Biological Sciences Prof. Terry
Root said last night to a packed Cubberley Auditori-

" I J
urn. "Our actions now can affect
the next 500 generations."

Week of Action anu was inspired
by the nationwide Campus Climate Challenge.
" Hie reason we gathered these people together to
show them the movie was to demonstrate that as a
community, climate change is an issue we really care
about." said sophomore Lauren Finzer, a member of
the Stanford Climate Control Crew, a smaller group
within the SCCC. "Our main goal is for Stanford to
make an institutional commitment to lower emissions
and to take leadership 011 the climate change issue."
The group's petition to the University, which calls
for a reduction in emissions, was available to sign at
the screening.
According to the Climate Control Crew. Yale
President Richard Levin recently announced his
pledge to reduce emissions by 10 percent. Harvard
President Lawrence Summers responded by an
nouncing an 11 percent reduction.
"Why can't we pledge 12 percent?" asked CCC
member Bryce Golden-Chen, a sophomore. "This is
the sort of stance Stanford should be taking. We
should have a green race of sorts."
The nearly 500 viewers in Cubberley mostly
watched Al Gore's documentary in rapt silence.They
laughed at nearly all of Gore's jokes and gasped at
images of global flooding, one of which showed Stan
ford nearly underwater.
The SCCC is a subgroup of Sustainable Stanford,
a larger student group, which advocates that students
and the University adopt environmentally responsi-

ble policies.
After the film screening. Root
fielded audience questions.
Asked about the proper course
of action. Root responded, "We just
have to start changing; each one of
us can make a difference."
The professor encouraged students
to keep their lights and computers off
whenever possible. She also suggested
that students write to their congres
sional representatives to share their
concerns about climate control.
"And get rid of Bush," she added.
Root told the crowd that she be
lieves the Earth is on the cusp of a
mass extinction, during which 15 to
35 percent of all species could be
come extinct in the next 100 to 200
years. She said it was "all because of
one species."
"We can do it," she said. "We just
have to have the political will. We
don't want to leave this horrible lega
cy to our children and grandchildren."
