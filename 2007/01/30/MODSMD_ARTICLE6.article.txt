## Report finds junior faculty satisfied Stanford deemed "exemplar" survey 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
Anyone who has ever considered
a career in academia. take heed: it
turns out that Stanford is not just a
good place to be a student; it's also a
great place to be a junior professor.
A 2005 survey by the Collabora
tive on Academic Careers in Higher
Education (COACHE) that was re
leased last week designated Stanford
as an "exemplar" school with regards
to the satisfaction of its junior facul
ty. Designed to single out the institu
tions in which junior faculty are most
happy with key elements in their
work life, the survey ranked each
school based on how it compared to
institutions of a similar stature.
COACHE gave Stanford, as well as
other five other schools, its highest

rank. Stanford also received top hon
ors in four of the survey's seven cate
gories — Nature of Work. Compen
sation. Collegiality and Global
[Overall] Satisfaction. Auburn.
Brown, Ohio State, Illinois at l'r
bana-Champaign and Davidson Col
lege were also given top marks.
COA< ill co director Richard
Chait, a professor of higher educa
tion at the 1 larvard Graduate School
of Education, said these schools de
serve special mention because they
are already succeeding.
"If they can sustain an earned
reputation as a great place for junior
faculty to work." Chait said, "they
will enjoy a competitive edge in re
cruiting and retaining the next gener
ation of faculty."
Pat Jones, Stanford's vice provost
for faculty development, was tem
pered in his reaction, cautioning
"that the survey was somewhat limit
ed in distribution and a number of
the universities that wc consider our
peers did not participate."
He did point, however, to concert-

Ed efforts to make junior faculty
more comfortable in the Stanford
community.
"Tenure-track faculty are evalu
ated for tenure on the basis of the ex
cellence of their teaching and schol
arship and do not compete with each
other for tenured positions — which
does occur at some other universi
ties. "Jones said. "We also have orien
tations and workshops for junior fac
ulty to help them know what they
need to do to be successful."
David Schneider, assistant profes
sor of Microbiology and Immunolo
gy, attributed Stanford's success to its
unique culture.
"There are a number of other
great schools that also have great
people but the cultures are differ
ent." Schneider said."l find less hier
archy here."
Schneider described the sense of
equality between Stanford faculty
and said that at other institutions he
had worked at,"you could tell a per
son's rank by the furniture in their
office."
"As a junior faculty member, I
feel like the University supports me
and is invested in the success of its
junior faculty, which is not true
everywhere," he said. A s si s -
tant Professor of Biological Sciences
and Pathology Anthony William De
Tomaso said he has found general
faculty to be quite supportive.
"If 1 want to try something new.

or get some advice, quite often I can
walk into the office of the inventor,
or the world authority."Tomaso said.
"1 can't tell you how many times that
has happened during my career
here."
Tomaso attributed the Universi
ty's success with junior faculty to the
"excellent post-doctoral students"
that it attracts.
"It's a cutting edge place and
everyone feels that," he said."But it
is also California, so it couples that
to a more laid back, yet 'go-for-it'
West Coast attitude. The two to
gether are a good match.and I think
it is just a place people want to be
part of."
