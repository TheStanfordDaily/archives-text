### KIM GAMEL ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BAGHDAD. Iraq (AF) - Iraq's
armv said Monday it killed the leader
cif a heavily armed cult of messianic
Shiites in a fierce gunbattle aimed at
foiling an attack on leading Shiite
clerics and pilgrims in the city of
Najaf on the holiest day of the Shiite
calendar.
Senior Iraqi security officers said
three gunmen of "the Soldiers of
Heaven" cult were captured in Najaf
after renting a hotel room in front of
the office of Iraq's most senior Shiite
spiritual leader. (Jrand Ayatullah Ali
al-Sistani. with plans to attack it.
The 24-hour battle was ultimately
won by Iraqi troops supported by
U.S. and British jets and American
ground forces. But the ability of a
splinter group little known in Iraq to
rally hundreds of heavily armed
fighters was a reminder of the poten
tial for chaos and havoc emerging
seemingly out of nowhere.
Members of the group, which in
cluded women and children, planned
to disguise themselves as pilgrims
and kill as many leading clerics as
possible, said Maj. Gen. Othman al-
Ghanemi. the Iraqi commander in
charge of the Najaf region.
Ilie cult's leader, wearing jeans, a
coat and a hat and carrying two pis
tols, was among those who died in the
battle. al-Ghanemi said. Although he
went by several aliases, he was iden
tified as Dia Abdul Zahra kadim,37.
from Hillah, south of Baghdad, ac
cording to Abdul-Hussein Abtan.
deputy governor of Najaf. Kadim
had been detained twice in the past
few years, Abtan said.
The LIS. military said Iraqi securi
ty forces were sent to the area Sun
day after receiving a tip that gunmen
were joining pilgrims headed to
Najaf for Ashoura, a commemora
tion of the 7th-centurv death of

Imam Hussein, grandson of the
Prophet Muhammad.The major reli
gious festival culminates on Tuesday.
The gunmen had put up tents in
fields lined with date palm groves
surrounding Najaf, 100 miles south of
the capital. They planned to launch
their attack Monday night when
Ashoura celebrations would be get
ting under way, the Iraqi security of
ficers told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity because they
were not authorized to disclose the
information.
In the battle to foil the attack on
the pilgrims. Iraqi and U.S. forces
faced off against more than 200 gun
men with small arms fire, rocket-pro
pelled grenades and hand grenades,
the U.S. military said.The battle took
place about 12 miles northeast of
Najaf.
ITie American military said U.S.
air power was called in after the
Iraqis faced fierce resistance. Ameri
can ground forces were also de
ployed after small arms fire downed
a US. helicopter, killing two soldiers.
U.S. and British jets played a
major role in the fighting, dropping
500-pound bombs on the militants'
positions, but President Bush said
the battle was an indication that
Iraqis were beginning to take con
trol.
"My first reaction on this report
from the battlefield is that the Iraqis
are beginning to show me some
thing," Bush told National Public
Radio on Monday.
The U.S. military said more than
100 gunmen were captured but it did
not say how many were killed. Iraqi
defense officials, by contrast, said 200
militants were killed, 60 wounded
and at least 120 captured.
"It seems most likely that this was
Shiite-on-Shiite violence, with mil
lenarian cullists making an attempt
to march on Najaf during the chaos
of the ritual season of Muharram."
Juan Cole, an Islamic scholar at the
University of Michigan, said on his
Web site. "The dangers of Shiite-on-
Shiite violence in Iraq are substan
tial. as this episode demonstrated."

But Iraqi officials said Sunni ex
tremists and Saddam Hussein loyal
ists were helping the cult in their bid
to ambush Shiite worshippers.
"We have information from our
intelligence sources that indicated
the leader of this group had links
with the former regime elements
since 1993," said Ahmed al-Fatlawi
said, a member of the Najaf provin
cial council.
In addition to Iraqi Shiites. the
gunmen included Sunnis and for
eigners. according to al-Fatlawi.
Other Najaf government officials
said Afghans, Saudis and even a Su
danese were among the dead.
Al-Ghanemi said the area where
the men were staying was once run
by Saddam's al-Quds Army, a mili
tary organization the late president
established in the 19905.

Abtan told Iraqi state television
that the group had developed a mili
tary structure, acquiring the heavy
arms and digging trenches in prepa
ration for battle.
"What we want to know is where
they bought all these weapons?" al-
Ghanemi said, adding that the army
seized some 500 automatic rifles in
addition to mortars, heavy machine
guns and Russian-made Katyusha
rockets in what amounted to a major
test for Iraq's new military as it
works toward taking over responsi
bility for security from U.S.-led
forces.
Al-Ghanemi said the group
called the Jund al-Samaa. or Soldiers
of Heavenâ€”is considered heretical
by mainstream Shiite clerics and had
been planning for months to attack
Najaf during the Ashoura cere

monies.
Imam Hussein died in the battle
of Karbala in A.D. 680.The battle ce
mented a schism in Islam between
Shiites and Sunnis, a division that has
spiraled in Iraq since the U.S.-led in
vasion in 2003 and in particular since
the Feb. 22.2006 bombing of a Shiite
shrine in Samarra.
The Ashoura festival includes
processions and ceremonies, includ
ing self-flagellation, in a show of
grief to mark Hussein's death in bat
tle.
The planned attack on Najaf was
an attempt by the cult to force the
return of the "hidden imam." a 9th
century saint who Shiites believe
will return to bring peace and justice
to the world, according to al-Fat
lawi.
Hie gunmen planned to distribute

leaflets in Najaf saying that the hid
den imam will appear again, al-
Ghanemi said. In the tents outside
Najaf. troops found pamphlets titled
"Heaven's Judge." according to the
senior Iraqi security officers.
Members had gathered on a farm
to prepare to launch their attack.
Abtan said. They used date-palm
groves as cover, forcing some farm
ers at gunpoint to help them, said al-
Fatlawi. Other officials in Najaf said
Saddam loyalists bought the groves
six months ago.
Abtan said they planned first to
occupy a major mosque in Najaf,
then bombard the police stations and
kill the religious leaders.
"They intended to occupy Najaf,
then topple the Iraqi government
and kill all the great religious lead
ers," he said.

were joining pilgrims headed to
Najaf for Ashoura, a commemora
tion of the 7th-centurv death of

Imam Hussein, grandson of the
Prophet Muhammad.The major reli
gious festival culminates on Tuesday.
The gunmen had put up tents in
fields lined with date palm groves
surrounding Najaf, 100 miles south of
the capital. They planned to launch
their attack Monday night when
Ashoura celebrations would be get
ting under way, the Iraqi security of
ficers told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity because they
were not authorized to disclose the

In the battle to foil the attack on
the pilgrims. Iraqi and U.S. forces
faced off against more than 200 gun
men with small arms fire, rocket-pro
pelled grenades and hand grenades,
the U.S. military said.The battle took
place about 12 miles northeast of
Najaf.
ITie American military said U.S.
air power was called in after the
Iraqis faced fierce resistance. Ameri
can ground forces were also de
ployed after small arms fire downed
a US. helicopter, killing two soldiers.
U.S. and British jets played a
major role in the fighting, dropping
500-pound bombs on the militants'
positions, but President Bush said
the battle was an indication that
Iraqis were beginning to take con
trol.
"My first reaction on this report
from the battlefield is that the Iraqis
are beginning to show me some
thing," Bush told National Public
Radio on Monday.
The U.S. military said more than
100 gunmen were captured but it did
not say how many were killed. Iraqi
defense officials, by contrast, said 200
militants were killed, 60 wounded
and at least 120 captured.
"It seems most likely that this was
Shiite-on-Shiite violence, with mil
lenarian cullists making an attempt
to march on Najaf during the chaos
of the ritual season of Muharram."
Juan Cole, an Islamic scholar at the
University of Michigan, said on his
Web site. "The dangers of Shiite-on-
Shiite violence in Iraq are substan
tial. as this episode demonstrated."

But Iraqi officials said Sunni ex
tremists and Saddam Hussein loyal
ists were helping the cult in their bid
to ambush Shiite worshippers.
"We have information from our
intelligence sources that indicated
the leader of this group had links
with the former regime elements
since 1993," said Ahmed al-Fatlawi
said, a member of the Najaf provin
cial council.
In addition to Iraqi Shiites. the
gunmen included Sunnis and for
eigners. according to al-Fatlawi.
Other Najaf government officials
said Afghans, Saudis and even a Su
danese were among the dead.
Al-Ghanemi said the area where
the men were staying was once run
by Saddam's al-Quds Army, a mili
tary organization the late president
established in the 19905.

Abtan told Iraqi state television
that the group had developed a mili
tary structure, acquiring the heavy
arms and digging trenches in prepa
ration for battle.
"What we want to know is where
they bought all these weapons?" al-
Ghanemi said, adding that the army
seized some 500 automatic rifles in
addition to mortars, heavy machine
guns and Russian-made Katyusha
rockets in what amounted to a major
test for Iraq's new military as it
works toward taking over responsi
bility for security from U.S.-led
forces.
Al-Ghanemi said the group
called the Jund al-Samaa. or Soldiers
of Heavenâ€”is considered heretical
by mainstream Shiite clerics and had
been planning for months to attack
Najaf during the Ashoura cere

monies.
Imam Hussein died in the battle
of Karbala in A.D. 680.The battle ce
mented a schism in Islam between
Shiites and Sunnis, a division that has
spiraled in Iraq since the U.S.-led in
vasion in 2003 and in particular since
the Feb. 22.2006 bombing of a Shiite
shrine in Samarra.
The Ashoura festival includes
processions and ceremonies, includ
ing self-flagellation, in a show of
grief to mark Hussein's death in bat
tle.
The planned attack on Najaf was
an attempt by the cult to force the
return of the "hidden imam." a 9th
century saint who Shiites believe
will return to bring peace and justice
to the world, according to al-Fat
lawi.
Hie gunmen planned to distribute

leaflets in Najaf saying that the hid
den imam will appear again, al-
Ghanemi said. In the tents outside
Najaf. troops found pamphlets titled
"Heaven's Judge." according to the
senior Iraqi security officers.
Members had gathered on a farm
to prepare to launch their attack.
Abtan said. They used date-palm
groves as cover, forcing some farm
ers at gunpoint to help them, said al-
Fatlawi. Other officials in Najaf said
Saddam loyalists bought the groves
six months ago.
Abtan said they planned first to
occupy a major mosque in Najaf,
then bombard the police stations and
kill the religious leaders.
"They intended to occupy Najaf,
then topple the Iraqi government
and kill all the great religious lead
ers," he said.

Iraqis move in through a heavy sandstorm during clashes with gunmen at Zarqa, northeast of Najaf, Iraq, Monday. Iraqi officials claimed that at least 200 mil
itants were killed in a fierce battle between U.S.-backed Iraqi troops and a religious cult called the Jund al-Samaa.
BAGHDAD. Iraq (AF) - Iraq's

calendar.

three gunmen of "the Soldiers of
Heaven" cult were captured in Najaf
after renting a hotel room in front of
the office of Iraq's most senior Shiite
spiritual leader. (Jrand Ayatullah Ali
al-Sistani. with plans to attack it.
The 24-hour battle was ultimately
won by Iraqi troops supported by
U.S. and British jets and American
ground forces. But the ability of a
splinter group little known in Iraq to
rally hundreds of heavily armed
fighters was a reminder of the poten
tial for chaos and havoc emerging
seemingly out of nowhere.
Members of the group, which in
cluded women and children, planned
to disguise themselves as pilgrims
and kill as many leading clerics as
possible, said Maj. Gen. Othman al-
Ghanemi. the Iraqi commander in
charge of the Najaf region.
Ilie cult's leader, wearing jeans, a
coat and a hat and carrying two pis
tols, was among those who died in the
battle. al-Ghanemi said. Although he
went by several aliases, he was iden
