"What Lakes Can Tell Us About Past
Environ merits"
I akes contain a record of long-term changes in climate, ecology
and human activities. In dryland regions, lakes can tell us about
the frequency of droughts and Hoods during the last ten millennia
in regions such as the American Midwest, the Sahara and the
Mediterranean. Lake sediments can also be used to reconstruct
past land cover changes, for example due to farming I his cou
pled "multi-proxy'" approach makes n possible to see if past
changes in climate and human activities could have been causally
related.
