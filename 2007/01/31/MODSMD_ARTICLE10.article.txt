## IN FOCUS Abel available for support 
### VAUGHAN MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A few months ago I received a
very enthusiastic email from a Stan
ford alumna telling me about her for
mer advisor Suzanne Abel, explain
ing why I should interview her for In
Focus. When I spoke with Abel, the
associate director for external rela
tions at the Haas Center. I saw how
she could touch a student's life so
deeply, even years after the students
have left the University. Abel is a
truly caring mentor and public ser
vant whose generosity is obviously
felt by everyone around her.
Her job technically deals with
donors, overseeing the Haas fellow
ships and clearly communicating the
actions and needs of the I laas Center
to the outside world, which she does
with a team of several other staff
members. But she gives a lot of her
energy to advising and mentoring
students, above and beyond the re
quirements of her job.
Referring to her role as a student
mentor as "a labor of love," Abel says
that it helps "keeps [ her J honest."
She said she needs "to find ways to be
in touch with students," both to help
her relate to donors, but also because
she personally gets "so much out of
the contact, especially with fresh
men."
Abel's passion for mentoring
comes from caring so much about
the students and their well-being.
She said she wants students to be
lieve that they made the right choice
by coming to Stanford. Abel recount
ed a number of stories about her cur
rent and former students, telling me
how she tried to help each of them in
dividually to find his or her place at
the University. She could remember
names and minute details without
pause or hesitation, revealing how
she has truly come to know and ap
preciate each of her mentees.
Abel focuses on more than just
her students' academic lives. Kmpha
sizing the need to nurture personal
and social development, she told me
that "students are whole people and
one of the strengths the best advisors
bring is that students aren't just (at
Stanford] for an academic experi
ence."
When I asked Abel where her
passion for mentoring came from,
she told me about graduating from
Harvard in 1971 —during the trau
matic Vietnam War era. She said that
"coming out of college in that era
shaped my generation." especially
the way it thought about public serv

ice.
"There was a strong shared sense
amongst us that we had to go out and
do something that would help the
world." she added.
The young Abel followed this
inner compass first towards anthro
pological work. While in graduate
school at Brown, she worked as an
archeologist with the National Mu
seum of Costa Rica, where she
helped to "literally discover the his
tory [and the prehistory] of the coun
try." She told me that her group's
work was important to the country at
that point, that Costa Ricans wanted
to understand their own origins and
their place in Lower Central Ameri
ca.
Following the Nicaraguan revolu
tion in 1979,5he left Central America
to work, again as an archeologist, in
California. Unlike in Costa Rica,
Abel encountered hostility toward
her role as an archeologist among
Native Americans. Much of the na
tive community did not appreciate
the work that she and other archae
ologists were doing at native sites.
Abel told me that the "last thing I
wanted todo was be on the other side
of the native peoples. To me it was
unethical."
In an effort to bridge the divide
between the Native American and
scholarly communities, Abel helped
found a community-based public
museum with an extensive Native
American collection in Mendocino
County She wanted to "facilitate a
lot of scholarship and public educa
tion...to research the collection in an
effort to bring the knowledge to light
in such a way (that] we were making
it available to the native people who
had been denied access for a lone
time."
Abel directed the museum for
several years before she came to the
1 laas Center. Since she left the muse
um. a scholar from the local Native
American community has become
the director. She calls this "the ideal
outcome" of her stewardship.
These days Abel tries to better the
world through her work at the Haas
Center and through her students. She
says she sees anger in her students
that stems from frustration with the
world's myriad problems and misun
derstandings. She wants the students
"to hold on to the anger and channel
it in a way that will be creative and
not destructive."
Abel's career path exemplifies
her view of public service; she sees
opportunities for service in every
lifestyle and job.This has not only al

lowed her to focus on service
through a number of different ca
reers but also to show students the
innumerable ways they can con
tribute.
At the end of our interview, Abel
stressed that students don't need to
worry or try to "avail themselves of
all possibilities" open to them at
Stanford. She said that when she
graduated from college, she had no
idea what path she would take or
where she would end up, but that by
keeping her life open to opportunity,
she could find joy and meaning.
In a touching and caring gesture,
Abel offered me a copy of "A New
Spirit is Stirring," a book of selected
quotations from John W. Gardner,
one of the founders of the Haas Cen
ter. Gardner, a noted public servant
and politician, had a profound and
lasting effect on Abel, and she was
keen to share his wisdom with the
world. She wanted me to include one
of his quotes, so I chose one that I
thought Abel embodied:
"My career had all the straight
line consistence of a tangled ball of
yarn. Did I know where 1 was head
ed? Absolutely not! Did I plan my
career moves in a logical progres
sion? Absolutely not! There was no
grand design. I was a California boy,
stumbling cheerfully through life,
succeeding, falling on my face, pick
ing myself up and plunging ahead,
holding onto some simple values, try
ing to live with a civil heart as some
one said, always learning, always try
ing. always wondering."

men."
Abel's passion for mentoring
comes from caring so much about
the students and their well-being.
She said she wants students to be
lieve that they made the right choice
by coming to Stanford. Abel recount
ed a number of stories about her cur
rent and former students, telling me
how she tried to help each of them in
dividually to find his or her place at
the University. She could remember
names and minute details without
pause or hesitation, revealing how
she has truly come to know and ap
preciate each of her mentees.
Abel focuses on more than just
her students' academic lives. Kmpha
sizing the need to nurture personal
and social development, she told me
that "students are whole people and
one of the strengths the best advisors
bring is that students aren't just (at
Stanford] for an academic experi
ence."
When I asked Abel where her
passion for mentoring came from,
she told me about graduating from
Harvard in 1971 —during the trau
matic Vietnam War era. She said that
"coming out of college in that era
shaped my generation." especially
the way it thought about public serv

ice.
"There was a strong shared sense
amongst us that we had to go out and
do something that would help the
world." she added.
The young Abel followed this
inner compass first towards anthro
pological work. While in graduate
school at Brown, she worked as an
archeologist with the National Mu
seum of Costa Rica, where she
helped to "literally discover the his
tory [and the prehistory] of the coun
try." She told me that her group's
work was important to the country at
that point, that Costa Ricans wanted
to understand their own origins and
their place in Lower Central Ameri
ca.
Following the Nicaraguan revolu
tion in 1979,5he left Central America
to work, again as an archeologist, in
California. Unlike in Costa Rica,
Abel encountered hostility toward
her role as an archeologist among
Native Americans. Much of the na
tive community did not appreciate
the work that she and other archae
ologists were doing at native sites.
Abel told me that the "last thing I
wanted todo was be on the other side
of the native peoples. To me it was
unethical."
In an effort to bridge the divide
between the Native American and
scholarly communities, Abel helped
found a community-based public
museum with an extensive Native
American collection in Mendocino
County She wanted to "facilitate a
lot of scholarship and public educa
tion...to research the collection in an
effort to bring the knowledge to light
in such a way (that] we were making
it available to the native people who
had been denied access for a lone
time."
Abel directed the museum for
several years before she came to the
1 laas Center. Since she left the muse
um. a scholar from the local Native
American community has become
the director. She calls this "the ideal
outcome" of her stewardship.
These days Abel tries to better the
world through her work at the Haas
Center and through her students. She
says she sees anger in her students
that stems from frustration with the
world's myriad problems and misun
derstandings. She wants the students
"to hold on to the anger and channel
it in a way that will be creative and
not destructive."
Abel's career path exemplifies
her view of public service; she sees
opportunities for service in every
lifestyle and job.This has not only al

lowed her to focus on service
through a number of different ca
reers but also to show students the
innumerable ways they can con
tribute.
At the end of our interview, Abel
stressed that students don't need to
worry or try to "avail themselves of
all possibilities" open to them at
Stanford. She said that when she
graduated from college, she had no
idea what path she would take or
where she would end up, but that by
keeping her life open to opportunity,
she could find joy and meaning.
In a touching and caring gesture,
Abel offered me a copy of "A New
Spirit is Stirring," a book of selected
quotations from John W. Gardner,
one of the founders of the Haas Cen
ter. Gardner, a noted public servant
and politician, had a profound and
lasting effect on Abel, and she was
keen to share his wisdom with the
world. She wanted me to include one
of his quotes, so I chose one that I
thought Abel embodied:
"My career had all the straight
line consistence of a tangled ball of
yarn. Did I know where 1 was head
ed? Absolutely not! Did I plan my
career moves in a logical progres
sion? Absolutely not! There was no
grand design. I was a California boy,
stumbling cheerfully through life,
succeeding, falling on my face, pick
ing myself up and plunging ahead,
holding onto some simple values, try
ing to live with a civil heart as some
one said, always learning, always try
ing. always wondering."
