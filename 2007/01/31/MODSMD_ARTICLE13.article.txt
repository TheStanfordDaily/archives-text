## Editor's Farewell 
### 
It is a little-known fact that the bathrooms in
the Storke Publications Building are open 24
hours a day. As such, the war-weary walls have
been subjected to years of scratched-in or
sharpied-on graffiti, marks of various wayward
individuals passing in and out through the nights.
Some are illegible, most are incoherent, all are
permanent.
My thoughts turn to these assorted im
prints as I put the paper to bed one final
time for Volume 230.1 wonder: what is the
mark The Daily has left on the Stanford
community these past five months? Is it an
important source of campus dialogue and
debate, or just a temporary fix for your
crossword or Sudoku addiction?
My hope is the former. We provided in
depth coverage of the various trials and tra
vails ol The Band;chronicled the initial out
rage. then gradual acceptance of the Bike
Ban; and published the most accurate and
up-to-date print results of the 2006 Election
in the Bay Area. Sports kept you posted on
the ups and downs of the football team, and
Intermission continued to rock. More than
anything, the outpouring of response to ed
itorials and columns as letters to the editor
and online comments shows how much The
Daily really can make an impact on campus
discussion.
That's not to say we always got every
thing right. As student journalists, we had to
master the art of fair, accurate and ethical
reporting while balancing our course load
and social lives. Reporters misquoted
sources, copy editors missed typos and sen
ior editors didn't return phone calls. 1 made
a critical lapse in judgment in allowing the
squash story to run despite initial misgiv
ings. but acted as quickly and decisively as 1
could to remedy the situation.
But we are tirelessly striving to improve
our product. 1 am fully confident that the

Daily will continue to improve next volume
under the reins of my successor, wun
derkind James Hohmann. We're holding
seminars to improve our writing and report
ing. and have been working behind the
scenes to continually improve the Daily's
Web site. A number of exciting changes will
debut in the next few months, so be sure to
check back often, if not daily. With more and
more newspapers turning to the Web to net
readers, Ilie Daily is innovating to stay
ahead of the tide. It's a time of uncertainty
for print journalism, but also one of excite
ment and creativity. No one is sure what the
future may hold.
1 thank my tremendously hard-working,
loyal and entertaining staffers for their tire
lessness efforts and patience throughout the
volume. I could not have picked a better
group of individuals to stay up to the wee
hours of the night writing, editing and eating
Treehouse Nachos with.
1 thank my friends for understanding
where my true home-away-from-home was;
my fellow housemates in Robinson most
likely have no idea 1 even live there. They
came to visit me in the office knowing 1
probably wouldn't see them anywhere else,
and put up with me when I was ever-so
slightlv testy following another 4 a.m. night.
Last, but certainly not least. I thank you
the reader. You sent in story tips, comment
ed on the Web site, kept us honest and con
stantly pushed us to get better. Seeing you
read The Daily during lunch and discussing
it in classrooms made the late nights more
than worth it. Keep the calls, emails and let
ters coming. After all. they're much easier to
read than the Storke bathroom wall.
