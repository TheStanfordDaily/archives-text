# Wedding announcements I don't want to hear
## 
### 
You get a phone call from your ex.
Like, let's say she is your first or
near your first significant other. In.
like, elementary school. Your first kiss was
in the broom closet between classes. You
remember it vividly because now they lock
the doors.
Then she tells you that they've been
dreaming about you a lot lately. This isn't
the "heavy breathing" and credit card
number kind of dreaming that you usually
get on phone calls. This is the deep emo
tional scarring type of dreaming, like that
time your voice changed during the choir
recital and that's why everyone called you
"Old Man River" in your frosh dorm.
Now. you haven't seen this girl in
ten years and when you dated, neither
of you had really hit puberty yet. In
fact, you recall the last time you saw
her, it was at a Halloween party and
you were dressed as a 12-year-old
Judge I to. You are unsure if your moth
er's costume choices or the women you
attracted as a youth contributed more
to your current single status.
So she has been dreaming of an under
-18 version of yourself, which is vaguely pe
dophiliac. For some reason, you grow jeal
ous of this younger version of yourself, and
realize that this is one of the few times you
can totally beat up your rival. Pasty blond
with a dinosaur shirt? You'll break his fuck
ing neck.
The conversation gets worse. They tell
you that the dreams have been really posi
tive and well, their fiancee is kind of pissed
off that you are so featured in their dreams.
Fiancee? Dropping that word in casual

conversation is like ending your sentence
with "...and then 1 found out, both hookers
were dead!"
It's a High Fidelity moment, you
think to yourself. You were there first.
Sure, this guy may be there now. but
you called dibs back when you both
sniffed markers. In a college world
where you've overdosed on sexual ten
sion. crammed so many expectations
into a metaphorical glass slipper that
it's shattered any clear vision — you
look for certainties. You settle for the
satin of familiarities. Your mind spills
thoughts like an exploding box of
candy: If only you hadn't broken up.
maybe you'd be that guy. If only she
hadn't wanted to focus more on pass
ing algebra, if you had been more ac
commodating to her heavy 7th grade
academic demands, you could have
made it.
But then the other part of you thinks:
there is still so much left to see. Your
friends, several of which are in long-term
commitments, still abhor the thought of


Holt
Holt's Harangue
marriage. You're not against mar
riage in principle, you think. But we
should shun people who marry be
fore they are 25. We as a society
should shun them and make them
wear bags over their heads and have
parades where we throw couscous
at them.
Most likely, though, her confident
declaration of marriage is a sign of
cold feet. It takes more than a few
cups of coffee and several Poison
the Well albums for you to realize
this isn't your fault that they are un
certain of their future. It's not your
fault that visions of your 12-year
old dinosaur-loving-sweat pan t
wearing-niother-dresses-you-as-a-
dancing-OJ-trial-judge-self is caus
ing premarital strife in a couple
three thousand miles away.
In uncertainty, you actually
have something in common. So
you thank her for the call, ask
her to keep you informed about
the wedding and tell her to keep
in touch. Then you vomit. When
your roommate asks you what's
going on. you don't know what
to tell him. You just say that you
had the most terrifying telemar
keting experience of your life,
and he leaves it at that.
At Stanford, you think about
people who are getting married. At
first, they seem to have nothing in
common — but as Stanford stu
dents. we all have a deep fear of
idleness. IIHJM study buddies set
tle down together. That couple who
hooked up at the progressive now
lives in Escondido Village. The irri
tating SC'AI member and the unse
rious/overly-serious SL AC member
are getting hitched at the church of
acronyms. Surrounded by the suffo
cating white gloved hands of the fu
ture. you think about putting on a
Judge Ito costume again.

Chris's editor is thankful she's (lone. He
thanks her for her time and effort. Send
complaints to duAt^statifont edti.
