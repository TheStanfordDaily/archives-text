In Defense of the Class of 2007
For months now I have been reading about
the criticisms of the administration skillfully
bearing down on the student body. With a change
here, a tweak there,the students will never know
the difference. In five years, no one will think
twice when Band Run ends up in the stadium or
that Absolut Fun runs many of Stanford's major
traditions. After all, those security officers have
always been handing out tickets if you try to park
your bike on one of the arcades.
1 rarely cared. Most of the lime I would criti
cize students for their over-dramatization of the
situation. Yes. many of the changes are annoying.
But I always return to the fact that we as the stu
dent body are in one of the best situations of any
people our age in the world. I am absolutely un
wavering in that statement.
Ihe announcement of this year's commence
ment speaker brought another wave of criticism
(in addition to an overwhelming number of con
fused faces). Gioia's profile reads well. He ap
peals to be accomplished in his chosen fields, and
we a>uld probably learn a lot from him.
Vet I hold the same dissatisfaction as almost
all of my fellow seniors. 1 chose to apply to Stan
lord after watching Condoleezza Rice's Stanford
Commencement speech on television in 2002.
My life is different because of a Stanford com
mencement speech.

With the end of my Stanford career ap
proaching, I have tochange my views of the Uni
vei"sity. 1 do not doubt that our professors care
deeply about our learning. I do not doubt that our
RA's and CA's and staff members work tireless
ly to foster community But 1 now doubt that the
administration respects the undergraduate Stu
dent body.
The list of past speakers is impressive. Sandra
I )ay O'Connor. Kofi Annan. Steve Jobs. Justice,
peace, entrepreneurship. With their accomplish
ments lie the hopes for the student body' I hey not
only encourage but expect the students to live up
to their examples.
Why do we deserve anything less than
former students? We already hold our share
of students who won Rhodes Scholarships
and created successful start-up companies
and increased student awareness of AIDS
nationwide. We are already scientists and
authors and inventors and businessmen.
Does this administration care about its
students, or do they simply believe that we
don't warrant the same caliber of speaker as
students of the past?
The Class of 2007 deserves better.The class
es of the future deserve better. Stanford de
serves better.
