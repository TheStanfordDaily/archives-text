# When will the liberal arts get some street cred?
## 
### 
I got up early, wore my adult-ish earrings,
pulled my hair back into a low, grown-up
pony tail. I wore nice shoes, wide-legged
black pants and a button down shirt. As soon
as my class got out at 12:50, which by the way
is the most inconvenient class time this
school has ever scheduled, 1 rushed to the
Liberal Arts Career Fair — missing lunch
one day was just the small price 1 was willing
to pay for landing the internship that would
begin my dazzling career.
1 arrive, and after pushing my way
through a lounge of consulting companies, 1
find the sad row of non-consulting tables,
perceptibly less-frequented, adorned with
noticeably less flashy banners, fewer free
knick-knacks and dull, matte brochures. I
catch the two, sad officers manning the Cali
fornia Department of Corrections table
looking longingly over at the students stand
ing ten deep at the Triage table and lining up
around the corner for A.T. Kearney, flow
can their red whistles on spirally plastic
bracelets and Junior Officer stickers com
pare to the lure of a hundred grand a year?
Also notably in attendance this last Mon
day was The Peace Corps and the City of
Brisbane. Not only does my Stanford degree

in the humanities qualify me to work as a vol
unteer. but one small city south of here (not
the one in Australia...that would be much too
intriguing of an opportunity) thinks I am ca
pable enough to do something for them.
So this is what 1 have to choose from, this
is the bounty and promise offered at Stan
ford's annual Liberal Arts Career Fair. 1 had
to bike a mile around White Plaza to get past
the Engineering Career Fair, and now, here,
when 1 finally have companies aimed at my
area of interest, my choices lie between Girls
Moving Forward and Enterprise Rent-a-Car.
When are the liberal arts going to get
some street cred? 1 am tired of hearing
friends talk about their easy classes, which
inevitably turn out to be English or psychol
ogy. Mv ears have grown weary to the dron

ing. ever-present complaints about Humbio.
chemistry labs and curved physics tests —
there is so much to memorize, the exams are
excruciatingly difficult. Between Stanford's
career fairs, the science-class bragging and
the humanities-disparaging, it would seem
that the only things worth studying involve
computers, numbers and cell biology and the
only things worth becoming are software en
gineers, consultants and doctors.
Are there honestly only three careers in this
world? Is there really no worth in poetry, history,
literature and the tine arts? 1 heard Energy Mc-
Squared just compiled some great inspirational
physics quotes,C)rgo McChem just bought a fancy
new 30" by 40" neon periodic table poster for his
dorm room and C elly Mcßio recently framed
si mie 3-1) eok>r-enhanced digital images of her fa
vorite gram stains.
Techies, if you are trying to tell me you work
harder, you don't. If you need to put-down my
classes to compensate for why your major isn't
more exciting, then fine. But don't belittle my in
terests I )on 't assume my classes demand less time.
Just because my career fair sucked, doesn't mean
that I haven't learned something significant and
