## Finkelstein lives in elaborate fantasy 
### JEREMY L. ENGLAND 
Last Thursday evening, I went to a cult
meeting. I did so not out of ideological
curiosity (as 1 had already thoroughly
studied this particular cult's teachings, and
discussed their finer points with some of its
most fervent devotees), but rather in order to
take a few notes so that I could relay my im
pressions here, in this article. My interest in
reporting on the cult is personal, as many of its
members would like to see one of my favorite
countries — a country where 1 have both
dear friends and close family — wiped off the
map.
The country, of course, is Israel (what other
nation's destruction is considered an accept
able political objective on a university cam
pus?). Hie cult itself bears no title, but its
acolytes populate the ranks of student groups
on our campus such as the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN), the ironically
named Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East (C'JMR) and Students Confronting
Apartheid in Israel (SCAl).OnThursday.two
of these groups hosted a lecture by Norman
Finkelstein here at Stanford. As is so often
the case at these gatherings, which elevate in
tellectual aggression against Israel into a form

of organized worship, the event began with
rote recitations of praise for the cause's most
venerated idols: the introductory speaker tirst
invoked the spirit of Noam Chomsky, "one of
the greatest intellectuals of today, and of the
twentieth century." Following this, he read
lengthy quotations from the writings of lid
ward Said (Apollo to C homsky's Zeus. 1 .enin
to his Marx). ITirough the words of these holy
teachers, the invited speaker was sanctified
before the assembled crowd. Chomsky and
Said had approved Norman Finkelstein; so
now must we.
And in large part, we did.To be sure. I saw
many students in the audience who 1 sincere
ly hope had come merely out of curiosity, or at
the request of a friend. But between the talk 's
many organizers and a pugnacious gang ol
gray-haired, never-lapsed hippies who always
emerge from the woodwork for lurid rhetoric
like Finkelstcin's. it was easy to get the feeling
that few people in attendance were not on the
same page. Indeed, my sense was that much
of the lecture would have sailed over the head
of an audience member who was not already
thoroughly with the program, l ight from the
point where the lecturer began his speech
with the assertion that "if you look at the past,
the present.and the future, the conflict is real

ly not very controversial at all."What may one
infer from Norman's casual failure to specify
which conflict he was talking about, except
that he fully expected his audience to know
what he was going to say before he said it?
Throughout his whole talk, this same, to
talitarian message persisted: all of us are al
ready with the program, except for you. De
spite furious note scribbling, 1 literally lost
count of the number of times he used turns
of phrase that asserted the total impossibili
ty of thinking differently than he does about
Jews holding sovereignty in the land of their
ancestors. To list only a few: "there's no dis
sent, no debate, no dispute,""they all agree."
"complete and total unanimity,""no contro
versy whatsoever," "no legitimate disagree
ment" etc. Many members of the audience
helped to reinforce this message by provid
ing the example of how one should behave if
one is. indeed, already on board. One should
laugh knowingly when Norman points out
the "extraordinary coincidence that each
new Arab leader who threatens Israel is
compared to Hitler," never wondering
whether people might have made those com
parisons because of something an Arab
leader said about wanting to pave
Arab roads with Jewish skulls, or
something he did to help organize
Muslim SS divisions in Bosnia dur
ing World War 11. One should tsk
disgustedly when some bigoted fool
is quoted making the outlandish
claim that European Muslims are
anti-Semites, never asking why it is
tli.it French and Belgian Jews fear to
wear their skullcaps on the streets of
Paris and Antwerp. ()ne should boo
derisively at the mere utterance of
the name of Alan Pershowitz, never
doubting the unredeemable evil of
the youngest professor to ever be
tenured at Harvard Law School.
And. most important of all, one
should applaud vehemently at the
suggestion from one audience mem
ber that all of Israel is an illegal
Zionist occupation that should be
dismantled, never once questioning
the morality of such an appealingly
final solution to the problem of
Zionism.
A debate always swirls around
people like Finkelstein. and whether
or not what they say is anti-Semitic.
Rather than come down on one side
or the other of this dispute, it is my
hope now to try to say something
slightly subtler. l ew people recall
that the term "anti-Semitism" itself is
a much newer thing than hatred of
Jews. The end of the nineteenth cen
tury in Western Europe was an era of
Enlightened secularism, and of ro
mantic notions of race. As the
C hurch's power waned, Europe's
deep-seated cultural animosity to
wards Jews could no longer be justi
fied on religious grounds (Hitler
himself later wrote in Me in Kanipf
that he viewed persecution of Jews as
Christ-killers to be backward, igno
rant behavior). It was in this context
that some Europeans began to devel
op a new framework, in which Jews
were seen to be the enemy because
of their demonic racial qualities. ITie
common thread connecting the older
anti-Jewish sentiment to the newer

was that both were based on an elab
orate fantasy about Jewish crimes in
an imaginary world that inspired
many people to support or partici
pate in violence against actual Jews
in the real world.
Today, the Jews have a state: one
that Norman thinks was founded
through "morally indefensible"
crimes against humanity that it con
tinues to perpetrate in the present
day. When all is said and done, I per
sonally am not interested in whether
or not we call such a preposterous
denunciation an anti-Semitic one.
What matters to me is that every
thing Norman Finkelstein says has
that same common thread worming
through it:he lives in a fantasy world
where Israeli soldiers "indiscrimi
nately fire intocrowd[s]"in the serv
ice of an "Apartheid" Jewish State
whose very existence is a crime, and
the anger that this fantasy inspires
leads him and his head-nodding dis
ciples in CJME, SCAI, and else
where to champion the cause of
people who long ago demonstrated
that they want nothing more than to
blow up actual Jewish children on
real buses.
Though few of us study history, we
live in a world laden by the weight of
it. Anti-Semitism and Nazism are
nasty words today because their his
torical conclusion was an orgy of
mass-murder so tremendous as to be
almost incomprehensible. Yet. we
must remember that, once upon a
time, a great many in the Enlight
ened European elite proudly called
themselves anti-Semites. During the
same period, across the Atlantic
Ocean, Nazi thinkers were wel
comed to teach their theories at
America's top universities in what
was surely a sad and ignoble chapter
in the history of American academia.
With that chapter written, and its les
sons apparent, it grieves me very
much that organizations at Stanford
like SCAI and CJME are so intent on
writing another one that is equally
shameful.

lengthy quotations from the writings of lid
ward Said (Apollo to C homsky's Zeus. 1 .enin
to his Marx). ITirough the words of these holy
teachers, the invited speaker was sanctified
before the assembled crowd. Chomsky and
Said had approved Norman Finkelstein; so
now must we.
And in large part, we did.To be sure. I saw
many students in the audience who 1 sincere
ly hope had come merely out of curiosity, or at
the request of a friend. But between the talk 's
many organizers and a pugnacious gang ol
gray-haired, never-lapsed hippies who always
emerge from the woodwork for lurid rhetoric
like Finkelstcin's. it was easy to get the feeling
that few people in attendance were not on the
same page. Indeed, my sense was that much
of the lecture would have sailed over the head
of an audience member who was not already
thoroughly with the program, l ight from the
point where the lecturer began his speech
with the assertion that "if you look at the past,
the present.and the future, the conflict is real

ly not very controversial at all."What may one
infer from Norman's casual failure to specify
which conflict he was talking about, except
that he fully expected his audience to know
what he was going to say before he said it?
Throughout his whole talk, this same, to
talitarian message persisted: all of us are al
ready with the program, except for you. De
spite furious note scribbling, 1 literally lost
count of the number of times he used turns
of phrase that asserted the total impossibili
ty of thinking differently than he does about
Jews holding sovereignty in the land of their
ancestors. To list only a few: "there's no dis
sent, no debate, no dispute,""they all agree."
"complete and total unanimity,""no contro
versy whatsoever," "no legitimate disagree
ment" etc. Many members of the audience
helped to reinforce this message by provid
ing the example of how one should behave if
one is. indeed, already on board. One should
laugh knowingly when Norman points out
the "extraordinary coincidence that each
new Arab leader who threatens Israel is
compared to Hitler," never wondering
whether people might have made those com
parisons because of something an Arab
leader said about wanting to pave
Arab roads with Jewish skulls, or
something he did to help organize
Muslim SS divisions in Bosnia dur
ing World War 11. One should tsk
disgustedly when some bigoted fool
is quoted making the outlandish
claim that European Muslims are
anti-Semites, never asking why it is
tli.it French and Belgian Jews fear to
wear their skullcaps on the streets of
Paris and Antwerp. ()ne should boo
derisively at the mere utterance of
the name of Alan Pershowitz, never
doubting the unredeemable evil of
the youngest professor to ever be
tenured at Harvard Law School.
And. most important of all, one
should applaud vehemently at the
suggestion from one audience mem
ber that all of Israel is an illegal
Zionist occupation that should be
dismantled, never once questioning
the morality of such an appealingly
final solution to the problem of
Zionism.
A debate always swirls around
people like Finkelstein. and whether
or not what they say is anti-Semitic.
Rather than come down on one side
or the other of this dispute, it is my
hope now to try to say something
slightly subtler. l ew people recall
that the term "anti-Semitism" itself is
a much newer thing than hatred of
Jews. The end of the nineteenth cen
tury in Western Europe was an era of
Enlightened secularism, and of ro
mantic notions of race. As the
C hurch's power waned, Europe's
deep-seated cultural animosity to
wards Jews could no longer be justi
fied on religious grounds (Hitler
himself later wrote in Me in Kanipf
that he viewed persecution of Jews as
Christ-killers to be backward, igno
rant behavior). It was in this context
that some Europeans began to devel
op a new framework, in which Jews
were seen to be the enemy because
of their demonic racial qualities. ITie
common thread connecting the older
anti-Jewish sentiment to the newer

was that both were based on an elab
orate fantasy about Jewish crimes in
an imaginary world that inspired
many people to support or partici
pate in violence against actual Jews
in the real world.
Today, the Jews have a state: one
that Norman thinks was founded
through "morally indefensible"
crimes against humanity that it con
tinues to perpetrate in the present
day. When all is said and done, I per
sonally am not interested in whether
or not we call such a preposterous
denunciation an anti-Semitic one.
What matters to me is that every
thing Norman Finkelstein says has
that same common thread worming
through it:he lives in a fantasy world
where Israeli soldiers "indiscrimi
nately fire intocrowd[s]"in the serv
ice of an "Apartheid" Jewish State
whose very existence is a crime, and
the anger that this fantasy inspires
leads him and his head-nodding dis
ciples in CJME, SCAI, and else
where to champion the cause of
people who long ago demonstrated
that they want nothing more than to
blow up actual Jewish children on
real buses.
Though few of us study history, we
live in a world laden by the weight of
it. Anti-Semitism and Nazism are
nasty words today because their his
torical conclusion was an orgy of
mass-murder so tremendous as to be
almost incomprehensible. Yet. we
must remember that, once upon a
time, a great many in the Enlight
ened European elite proudly called
themselves anti-Semites. During the
same period, across the Atlantic
Ocean, Nazi thinkers were wel
comed to teach their theories at
America's top universities in what
was surely a sad and ignoble chapter
in the history of American academia.
With that chapter written, and its les
sons apparent, it grieves me very
much that organizations at Stanford
like SCAI and CJME are so intent on
writing another one that is equally
shameful.

Last Thursday evening, I went to a cult
meeting. I did so not out of ideological
curiosity (as 1 had already thoroughly
studied this particular cult's teachings, and
discussed their finer points with some of its
most fervent devotees), but rather in order to
take a few notes so that I could relay my im
pressions here, in this article. My interest in
reporting on the cult is personal, as many of its
members would like to see one of my favorite
countries — a country where 1 have both
dear friends and close family — wiped off the
map.
The country, of course, is Israel (what other
nation's destruction is considered an accept
able political objective on a university cam
pus?). Hie cult itself bears no title, but its
acolytes populate the ranks of student groups
on our campus such as the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN), the ironically
named Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East (C'JMR) and Students Confronting
Apartheid in Israel (SCAl).OnThursday.two
of these groups hosted a lecture by Norman
Finkelstein here at Stanford. As is so often
the case at these gatherings, which elevate in
tellectual aggression against Israel into a form

of organized worship, the event began with
rote recitations of praise for the cause's most
venerated idols: the introductory speaker tirst
invoked the spirit of Noam Chomsky, "one of
the greatest intellectuals of today, and of the
twentieth century." Following this, he read
lengthy quotations from the writings of lid
ward Said (Apollo to C homsky's Zeus. 1 .enin
to his Marx). ITirough the words of these holy
teachers, the invited speaker was sanctified

Said had approved Norman Finkelstein; so
