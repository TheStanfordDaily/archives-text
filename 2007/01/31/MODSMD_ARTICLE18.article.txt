## Finkelstein lives in elaborate fantasy 
### JEREMY L. ENGLAND 
Last Thursday evening, I went to a cult
meeting. I did so not out of ideological
curiosity (as 1 had already thoroughly
studied this particular cult's teachings, and
discussed their finer points with some of its
most fervent devotees), but rather in order to
take a few notes so that I could relay my im
pressions here, in this article. My interest in
reporting on the cult is personal, as many of its
members would like to see one of my favorite
countries — a country where 1 have both
dear friends and close family — wiped off the
map.
The country, of course, is Israel (what other
nation's destruction is considered an accept
able political objective on a university cam
pus?). Hie cult itself bears no title, but its
acolytes populate the ranks of student groups
on our campus such as the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN), the ironically
named Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East (C'JMR) and Students Confronting
Apartheid in Israel (SCAl).OnThursday.two
of these groups hosted a lecture by Norman
Finkelstein here at Stanford. As is so often
the case at these gatherings, which elevate in
tellectual aggression against Israel into a form

of organized worship, the event began with
rote recitations of praise for the cause's most
venerated idols: the introductory speaker tirst
invoked the spirit of Noam Chomsky, "one of
the greatest intellectuals of today, and of the
twentieth century." Following this, he read
lengthy quotations from the writings of lid
ward Said (Apollo to C homsky's Zeus. 1 .enin
to his Marx). ITirough the words of these holy
teachers, the invited speaker was sanctified
before the assembled crowd. Chomsky and
Said had approved Norman Finkelstein; so
now must we.
And in large part, we did.To be sure. I saw
many students in the audience who 1 sincere
ly hope had come merely out of curiosity, or at
the request of a friend. But between the talk 's
many organizers and a pugnacious gang ol
gray-haired, never-lapsed hippies who always
emerge from the woodwork for lurid rhetoric
like Finkelstcin's. it was easy to get the feeling
that few people in attendance were not on the
same page. Indeed, my sense was that much
of the lecture would have sailed over the head
of an audience member who was not already
thoroughly with the program, l ight from the
point where the lecturer began his speech
with the assertion that "if you look at the past,
the present.and the future, the conflict is real

ly not very controversial at all."What may one
infer from Norman's casual failure to specify
which conflict he was talking about, except
that he fully expected his audience to know
what he was going to say before he said it?
Throughout his whole talk, this same, to
talitarian message persisted: all of us are al
ready with the program, except for you. De
spite furious note scribbling, 1 literally lost
count of the number of times he used turns
of phrase that asserted the total impossibili
ty of thinking differently than he does about
Jews holding sovereignty in the land of their
ancestors. To list only a few: "there's no dis
sent, no debate, no dispute,""they all agree."
"complete and total unanimity,""no contro
versy whatsoever," "no legitimate disagree
ment" etc. Many members of the audience
helped to reinforce this message by provid
ing the example of how one should behave if
one is. indeed, already on board. One should
laugh knowingly when Norman points out
the "extraordinary coincidence that each
new Arab leader who threatens Israel is
compared to Hitler," never wondering
whether people might have made those com
parisons because of something an Arab
