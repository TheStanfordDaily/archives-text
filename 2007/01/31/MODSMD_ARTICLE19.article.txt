## Freedom and right to protest: no nation should be immune from criticism 
### EUGENE GU 
Though leaving much to he de
sired. the United States be
haves relatively within bounds
when it comes to protecting our right
to free speech. Despite the mysteri
ous Patriot Act, you can still protest
the Iraq War without being hauled
off to prison. There's always the pos
sibility that the government may sur
reptitiously tap your phone, read
your emails or place you on the FBI
surveillance list. But at least they
won't shoot you in the face. And I
guess that's something.
Fundamental to every working
democracy is the right to peacefully
protest any government's policies, laws,
or actions that one might find disagree
able. Perhaps the reason our founding fa
thers made freedom of speech the First
Amendment was because they under
stood the importance of allowing criti
cism and dissent t<) spark constructive de
bate. They knew that stilling dissent not
only entails the violation of one's inalien
able rights but also represents an assault
on the institutions that stand to benefit
from reform.
The freedom to protest is not just
a domestic right. If our conscience
compels us. we can criticize the ac
tions of governments beyond our
borders no matter what diplomatic
ties the United States may have. In
an extreme case, some Republicans
and conservatives can criticize Mexi
co for failing to secure its border and
allowing a "flood" of immigrants to

"steal" jobs from Americans. I may
not agree with that assessment, but
as long ;is conservatives base their
criticisms on economics, security, and
foreign policy, rather than shameful
racism against Latinos, I won t be
calling foul. Sometimes the far right
does cross the line when they make
subtly racist remarks comparing
Mexican immigrants to inferior
human beings or advocate the build
ing of a 2,00()-mile sequel to the
Berlin Wall. Anti immigration pro
ponents do indeed have the constitu
tional right to make whatever com
ments ihey wish. But it they make
comments that are even remotely
racist, they leave themselves open to
condemnation from the leftâ€”and
rightfully so.
In addition toour own neighbors,
we also enjoy the freedom to stand
up against human rights violations
committed overseas. Although
countries like Saudi Arabia and
Egypt are "strategic" American al
lies in the oil rich Middle East, their
poor human rights record is still
open to criticism, l or instance, peo
ple can condemn Saudi Arabia's cav
alier capital punishment policy, the
nation's woeful failure to separate
church from state, and its denial ol
equal lights to women. Such criti
cism should not be viewed as anti-
Saudi or racist against Arabs.
Rather.it demonstrates empathy for
the Saudi Arabian people and the
desire to see them live in a democra
cy where thev can retain the funda

mental human rights that other peo
ple of the world take for granted.
But here's something that doesn't
add up. Even though it can be politi
cally correct to criticize the actions
of countries like Mexico. Saudi Ara
bia. United Kingdom. China, Japan.
Italy. Somalia and basically any na
tion you want to name, there is one
country that is simply off-limits. I"his
country is unique in that any criti
cism of its policies and behavior is
immediately reclassified as an attack
on its people. You can criticize
( hina's one-child policy or its stance
on laiwan without being anti-Chi
nese. You can stand up against So
malia's Islamic government without
being anti-Somali or anti-African.
You can even criticize Mexico and
Mexican immigrants for stealing
"good old American jobs" without
being considered racist for some
reason. But the moment you even
utter disagreement with the unlaw
ful military occupation of the West
Bank or (iaza.that the International
Court of Justice ruled the Separa
tion Wall illegal, or that Article of
the Geneva Conventions prohibits
the building of settlements in Pales
tinian territory, you're an anti-Semi
te.lry as you might,you can't defend
\ourself 112 om the onslaught of criti
cism you'll receive. You may have a
record of helping the homeless,
fighting racism alongside the
NAACP. or even helping little old
ladies cross the street. As far as any
one is concerned, you're the extrem

ist fringe. The party-line assumption
is that Israel is the beacon of democ
racy and civilization in a region of
savage, terrorist, religiously funda
mentalist Arabs. Anything else you
believe is taboo, or even worse, fun
damentally racist.
Recently, there has been debate
on-campus whether or not divesting
from companies that profit from Is
rael's well-documented oppression
of the Palestinians constitutes anti-
Semitism or unfair bias against Is
rael. The fact of the matter is that no
nation, whatever their painful histo
ry or awesome heritage, should be
immune from criticism of its policies
and actions. Ironically, Israeli com
panies are not even the main target
of the divestment campaign. SCAI
uses a five-point divestment criteri
on that prohibits investment in com
panies which 1) support the military
occupation. 2) finance the building
of the separation wall, 3) operate on
occupied territory, 4) support insti
tutional discrimination, or 5) are in
volved in illegal home demolish
ment. In fact, most of the companies
that lit the criteria are American
ones. Corporations like Caterpillar,
which construct bulldozers that de
molish homes and military suppliers
like Lockheed Martin, which manu
facture warplanes that blast civilians
from afar. Even Palestinian compa
nies that finance the Separation Wall
or violate any of the divestment cri
teria will not be spared. In any case,
what business does the university

have in supporting companies that
profit from the killing of civilians?
Just to reiterate, nobody is unfair
ly singling out Israel through the di
vestment campaign. ITiere were suc
cessful divestment movements
against South Africa in the 1980s and
more recently against Sudan in 2005.
There is also an ongoing divestment
campaign against sweatshop compa
nies. Given America's unprecedent
ed involvement in the occupation of
Palestine, and that for the past 30
years Israel has been the largest re
cipient of U.S. foreign military aid. di
vestment from select corporations
that support human rights abuses in
Israel-Palestine is simply the next
logical step.
Stanford University should not
profit from human misery anywhere
in the world. 1 would also like to see
Stanford divest from corporations in
Saudi Arabia that don't give equal
rights to women, from companies in
Burma that support the unlawful
military junta, from any corporation
anywhere that promotes injustice.
Starting with the region of the world
where America pours in most of its
money and foreign support seems
the most logical but the road to jus
tice will not end there. It is a contin
uing struggle that will be fought as
long as there is inequality, discrimi
nation. and violence in the world.
