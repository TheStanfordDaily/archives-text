## While percentages at most schools are decreasing, Stanford's students remain diverse 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Richard
Shaw attributes Stanford's success in attracting
minority applicants in the past decade to its main
tenance of strong ethnic communities on campus.
Since the state of California banned affirmative
action from its public schools in the mid 19905, the
enrollment of minorities in California's public uni
versity system has decreased. Ihe New York Times
reported last week. But minority enrollment at
Stanford has remained constant in recent years.
'ITie minority enrollment records of California
universities have become a matter of national in
terest lately as other states are passing legislation
comparable to California's Proposition 209, which
banned the selection of applicants on the basis of
race, gender or ethnicity.
"The point is that with regard to these various
initiatives in [states like] Michigan and Florida,the
private sector continues to be able to attract ex
tremely diverse populations," Shaw told The Daily.
The limes reported that Stanford's minority
enrollment has actually increased since 1995. cit

ing an 8 to 11 percent increase in African-Ameri
can enrollment.
But Shaw also said that the numbers, which
were provided to The Times by his office, listed
data for only 1995 and 2006 and did not provide in
formation for accumulated change over time.
"The numbers will fluctuate some and it de
pends upon how competitive the kids are," Shaw
said.
Enrollment by ethnic category at Stanford lias
been recorded in the Stanford University Com
mon Data Set since 1999. In that time, although
some fluctuation in the numbers is evident, minor
ity enrollment has remained relatively constant,
while enrollment of white students has decreased,
lliat decrease is partially explained by the number
of students who decline to report their ethnicities.
Shaw attributed Stanford's ability to attract
qualified minority applicants to the minority com
munities that already exist here. Stanford, he said,
attracts applicants by maintaining a commitment
to its constituencies.
"We have outreach programs in which we ac
knowledge students from diverse backgrounds," he
said. "It is the focus of the institution and proudly so.

YVe have increased the outreach in the past year. We
are also reaching out to students with ethnic or racial
backgrounds who are first generation [college] kids."
Stanford, Shaw maintained, does not use quo
tas or percentages to govern its admissions poli
cies.

I le said that ethnic centers like El
Centro Chicano are an important
aspect of campus life. Shaw warned,
however, that these centers cannot
he allowed to isolate their members.
"Ultimately, we want our kids to
be integrated into the community
and part of the whole, but [we also
hope] that the mini-experiences
they bring to the overall experience
are wonderful," he said. "There is a
comfort zone here where all are wel
come."
