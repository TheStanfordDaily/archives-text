So who's ready for a coronation?
By the look of things, just about
everyone. Reading the
columns, watching ESPN's coverage
and feeling the fan vibe, it seems like
most people outside of the Windy
City are ready to hand the Lombar
di trophy to Peyton Manning and
the Colts come Sunday. And in some
ways it's easy to see why. Despite
Denny Green's midseason tirade
that the media had already
"crowned' the Chicago Bears, Man
ning and the Colts have been mak
ing the best progress toward seizing
the proverbial NFL throne in recent
weeks.
Since the playoffs began, Indi
anapolis has defeated its arch-neme
sis. New England, improved its rush
defense to stall the league's best
power rushing attack against Kansas
City and won ugly over'the Ravens, a
team that earns its living by winning
ugly games. As Denny would say,
these Colts aren't, in fact, who we
thought they were.
But, make no mistake about it,
there will be two teams on the field
in Miami. And, you know, crazy
tilings can happen when they actual
ly play the game.
Consider that old adage â€” de
fense wins championships. Consider
how well it has held up in recent
years and try to think of the year
when a great offense beat a great de
fense in the Super Bowl. Consider
that the player supposedly responsi
ble for the Colts' miraculous defen
sive turnaround in the postseason is
a safety listed at 5-feet-8-inches and
206 pounds.
All this, coupled with the ridicu
lous media hype leaning in the Colts'
direction, should be enough to make
you think the game won't be quite so
easy for Peyton & Co.
The Bears have the cornerbacks
to cover Manning's speedy receivers,
and Brian Urlacher has the speed to
stay with Dallas Clark over the mid
dle. Even without defensive-tackle
Tommie Harris and safety Mike
Brown, both Pro Bowl-caliber per
formers, Chicago possesses the kind
