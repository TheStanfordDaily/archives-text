## Too close to call, almost 
### 
So who's ready for a coronation?
By the look of things, just about
everyone. Reading the
columns, watching ESPN's coverage
and feeling the fan vibe, it seems like
most people outside of the Windy
City are ready to hand the Lombar
di trophy to Peyton Manning and
the Colts come Sunday. And in some
ways it's easy to see why. Despite
Denny Green's midseason tirade
that the media had already
"crowned' the Chicago Bears, Man
ning and the Colts have been mak
ing the best progress toward seizing
the proverbial NFL throne in recent
weeks.
Since the playoffs began, Indi
anapolis has defeated its arch-neme
sis. New England, improved its rush
defense to stall the league's best
power rushing attack against Kansas
City and won ugly over'the Ravens, a
team that earns its living by winning
ugly games. As Denny would say,
these Colts aren't, in fact, who we
thought they were.
But, make no mistake about it,
there will be two teams on the field
in Miami. And, you know, crazy
tilings can happen when they actual
ly play the game.
Consider that old adage — de
fense wins championships. Consider
how well it has held up in recent
years and try to think of the year
when a great offense beat a great de
fense in the Super Bowl. Consider
that the player supposedly responsi
ble for the Colts' miraculous defen
sive turnaround in the postseason is
a safety listed at 5-feet-8-inches and
206 pounds.
All this, coupled with the ridicu
lous media hype leaning in the Colts'
direction, should be enough to make
you think the game won't be quite so
easy for Peyton & Co.
The Bears have the cornerbacks
to cover Manning's speedy receivers,
and Brian Urlacher has the speed to
stay with Dallas Clark over the mid
dle. Even without defensive-tackle
Tommie Harris and safety Mike
Brown, both Pro Bowl-caliber per
formers, Chicago possesses the kind


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
of defense that can give even a great
quarterback fits. And Lovie Smith
has always been a mastermind when
it comes to creating turnovers.
And yet. I just can't bring myself
to pick against the Colts.
Part of that might be that Rex
Grossman just scares me. He's not
'scary' in the good, tough to defend
kind of way. He's scary in the incred
ibly inconsistent kind of way.
Against a pretty good Colts pass de
fense. I just can't see Grossman out
dueling Peyton, and that could spell
disaster for a legion of Bears fans
who have been waiting a long time
to see the magic of'Bs repeated.
And then you've got the familiar
ity factor. Peyton Manning carves
up defensive schemes he sees once a
year — what is he going to be able
to do to a defense he basically prac
tices against every day? Lovie Smith
and Tony Dungy are both propo
nents of the "Tampa Two" defense.
In fact. Smith learned it from none
other than Dungy himself as a de
fensive assistant in Tampa. In short,
it would be surprising if either quar

terback were flummoxed hv some
kind of new, as-yet-unseen defen
sive wrinkle, but then again I'll
never put any mistake past Rex
Grossman. Peyton on the other
hand, should be able to eat the
Cover 2 for breakfast.
But history has shown that typi
cally it's just when the media starts
to feel that one team or one confer
ence is invincible in Super Bowl
play that the mighty have fallen.
Favre's dominant Packers were de
feated by the lovable loser Broncos
in the late "90s and Warner and
Faulk were humbled by upstart
Tom Brady in early 2002. So the
question remains, is Sunday the day
Peyton Manning becomes John
Flway. or the day he falls back into
the Dan Marino mold?
In any event, get ready for some
pulse-pounding action and edge-of
your-seat thrills, because I've got a
hunch that this game is going to be
good, whether we witness a corona
tion or a stunning defeat. As far as
actually making the pick, I'm not
going to touch that one with a ten
foot pole.
Or maybe I will. Manning and the
Colts win out in a close one, 24-23.
