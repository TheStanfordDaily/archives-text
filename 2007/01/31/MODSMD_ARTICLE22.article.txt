# CARD READY FOR ZAGS
## Ranked for the first time this season, Stanford men's basketball has won six of its last seven and looks better than ever 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Looking as dominant as they have in years,
Stanford men's basketball will try to keep the
momentum going and avoid a letdown
tonight against Gonzaga.
Coming off a home sweep of No. 25 USC
and No. 3 UCLA, No. 23 Stanford is in as
strong of a position as it has been since Josh
Childress played at the Farm, this year's sen
iors were freshmen and Nick Robinson hit a
miracle 35-footer against Arizona as the Car
dinal raced to a 26-0 start and No. 1 national
ranking.
Though the team is reluctant to talk more
than one game into the future, make no mis
take: Stanford (14-5,6-3 Pac-10) wants to get
back to the NCAA Tournament in the worst
way.
"That's the main goal: Pac-10 Champi
onships. going to the Tournament and doing
well," sophomore forward Lawrence Hill
said.
And after seeing their 11-year streak
snapped last year, they have put together
quite the resume this season.
Add up the gaudy overall record, the 5-2
mark away from Maples, the five wins against
top-50 teams and the 16th-toughest schedule
in the country, and Stanford comes out with
the 30th best RPI in the country, according to
WarrenNolan.com. Stop worrying about the

bubble — that No. 30 RPI correlates with an
eight seed.
The Cardinal find themselves in this posi
tion after winning six of their last seven in ab
solutely stunning fashion. The first three of
those wins — over Virginia and Washington
by one, and over Washington State in over
time— came by razor-thin margins. The last
three saw a school-record l l ) blocks in a dem
olition of IJSC sandwiched between dramatic

second-half comebacks against Oregon State
and, most shocking of all. UCLA, from 17
points down.
"We beat some good teams," sophomore
guard Anthony Goods said. "We worked hard
this whole season, but we canit let it get to our
heads."
No surprise then, that while the coachesi
poll continues to lag weeks behind reality —
ranking Virginia Commonwealth and slump

ing Arizona, among others, ahead of No. 30
Stanford — the voters in the AP Poll put the
Cardinal at No. 23.That is Stanford's first na
tional ranking since late 2005. and first rank
ing this late in the season since that magical
2003-04 campaign.
"National recognition, it'll help out with
recruiting, little things like that," Hill said.

Sophomore Anthony Goods is currently second on the team in points per game and scored 20 in Stanford's come-from-behind victory over UCLA
last weekend. But, he says, that upset is "not going to help us beat Gonzaga" in tonight's match-up.
