# CARD READY FOR ZAGS
## Ranked for the first time this season, Stanford men's basketball has won six of its last seven and looks better than ever 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Looking as dominant as they have in years,
Stanford men's basketball will try to keep the
momentum going and avoid a letdown
tonight against Gonzaga.
Coming off a home sweep of No. 25 USC
and No. 3 UCLA, No. 23 Stanford is in as
strong of a position as it has been since Josh
Childress played at the Farm, this year's sen
iors were freshmen and Nick Robinson hit a
miracle 35-footer against Arizona as the Car
dinal raced to a 26-0 start and No. 1 national
ranking.
Though the team is reluctant to talk more
than one game into the future, make no mis
take: Stanford (14-5,6-3 Pac-10) wants to get
back to the NCAA Tournament in the worst
way.
"That's the main goal: Pac-10 Champi
onships. going to the Tournament and doing
well," sophomore forward Lawrence Hill
said.
And after seeing their 11-year streak
snapped last year, they have put together
quite the resume this season.
Add up the gaudy overall record, the 5-2
mark away from Maples, the five wins against
top-50 teams and the 16th-toughest schedule
in the country, and Stanford comes out with
the 30th best RPI in the country, according to

Sophomore Anthony Goods is currently second on the team in points per game and scored 20 in Stanford's come-from-behind victory over UCLA
last weekend. But, he says, that upset is "not going to help us beat Gonzaga" in tonight's match-up.
"But as far as the next game goes, it'll
only serve as a distraction. We need
to get it out of our heads."
But for all its dramatic wins this
year, Stanford finds itself ranked as
much because it hasn't lost to any
weak opponents yet. Take away last
year's meltdowns at Montana. UC-
Davis and UC-Irvine, and that team
would have found itself in the
NCAA tournament too. And that's
the importance of this weekend.
"Winning this next game is huge
because of what they've been able to
do. their strength of schedule." said
Hill showing that the RPI is fore
front in his mind too. "And we defi
nitely need some momentum going
into Cal."
Gonzaga (15-7, 6-1 West Coast
Conference) and California (12-9,4-
5 Pac-10) are both talented and both
beat the Cardinal in their most re

" ITie (ionzaga game last year was

pull it off," Kill said. "Breakdowns
when we were told to double-team
Adam Morrison when he gets off
and no one is around. That'll defi
nitely be in the back of my head."
But right now.Stanford is looking
better than both. This year's Gonza
ga started out hot — beating North
Carolina and Texas and playing
Duke close — but has struggled with
consistency more recently. Perhaps
that is no surprise, given that their
two best players from last year. All-
American Adam Morrison and J.P.
Batista, have both left Spokane.
"I 've seen them a lot on TV, and 1

Sophomore Anthony Goods is currently second on the team in points per game and scored 20 in Stanford's come-from-behind victory over UCLA

"But as far as the next game goes, it'll

But for all its dramatic wins this
year, Stanford finds itself ranked as
much because it hasn't lost to any

year's meltdowns at Montana. UC-
Davis and UC-Irvine, and that team
would have found itself in the

Carolina and Texas and playing
Duke close — but has struggled with
consistency more recently. Perhaps
that is no surprise, given that their
two best players from last year. All-
American Adam Morrison and J.P.
Batista, have both left Spokane.
"I 've seen them a lot on TV, and 1
see a different team every once in
awhile." Hill said."A fierce team that
comes out and beats North Carolina
like they did and then goes out
against St. Mary's and doesn't seem
in their flow. But they're very dan
gerous and it's more important than
[UCI.A] now that we have that be
hind us."
Gonzaga s Derek Ravio is a pro
lific outside scorer, averaging 19
points per game on incredible shoot
ing accuracy (46.5 percent overall.
45.2 percent from three and 94 per
cent from the free-throw line). Guard
Jeremy Pargo adds another 12 points
per game, and the posts, led by Josh
Heytvelt (15 points. 7 rebounds per
game), are talented, if not deep.
"We've definitely got to get ready
for (ionzaga," Goods said. "They're a
very tough team and its going to be a
test for us No time to celebrate now."
ITie'Zags come off just one day of
rest, following a l )l-S2 victory over
San Diego Monday night. With the
home-court edge, the Cardinalfs size
advantage and the way Stanford has
been play ing of late, it should be "All
Right Now" in Maples tonight — if
Stanford can regroup and focus after
its biggest win in years.
"You just gotta stay focused."

tion comes true.

Goods said. "The UCLA game's long
gone.That's not going to help us beat
Gonzaga."

ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Freshman center Robin Lopez dunks the ball in the Cardinal's 75-68 win over then-No. 3 UCLA. The size mismatch
between Brook and Robin Lopez and the big men of Gonzaga should give Stanford a boost tonight.
