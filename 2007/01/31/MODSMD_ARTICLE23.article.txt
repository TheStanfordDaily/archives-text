# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Building a dynasty 
### JACK SALISBURY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It has been eighty-seven matches.That's
the number of team matches which seniors
Anne Yelsey and Theresa Logar of the
women's tennis team have played in their
careers.
87 also happens to be the number of
matches that the Cardinal has won with the
senior duo; they've never lost a dual match
in Stanford uniforms.
The term "dynasty" seems to be quite
fitting for the three-time defending nation
al champions, and the two seniors have
played a large role in the team's astonish
ing success.
Both Logar and Yelsey, who boast im
pressive accomplishments over the years,
were modest in evaluating their roles in
making history (Stanford is only 2 match
victories away from tying the NCAA
record of 89).
Yelsey, a psychology major hailing from
Newport Beach, Calif., attributed a large
part of the team's success over the years to
the coaches.
"I feel like the coaches have given us an
opportunity over the past few years to
come together with the best tennis players
in the country,"she said."l think that's how
Stanford tennis has become somewhat of a
dynasty...they do such a good job of recruit
ing."
Both players have racked up numerous
awards and accolades over the course of
their careers. Yelsey has played on the
WTA professional tour and even defeated
a player ranked in the Top 1(K) in the world.
She's played in the main doubles draw of
the U.S. Open twice,and has been national

"The Stanford legacy attracted
me to this school since I was a young
kid Logar said. "When you walk
out with that 'S' on your jersey it
means so much. You are Stanford,
and you are the best."
"Being a part of the last three
years of Stanford tennis has been
amazing," Yelsey added.
The duo both got off to a bit of a
slow start this fall. The pair's indi
vidual rankings have dropped from
where they were at the end of last
season, but, as Logar explained, the
early season rankings are often
"bogus" anyway.
Yelsey was hampered by a quad
injury sustained in last year's
NCAA Championships and had to
spend much of the fall season work
ing back from that injury.
"It's all better now and I'm just
trying to get back in to match
shape." she said. "1 feel like I've
come back at just the right time."
As for life after the Stanford, the
two seniors have bright prospects.
Yelsey plans to pursue tennis at
the professional level for the next
few years.
"I played on the professional cir
cuit last summer and it went pretty
well," she said. "I'm going give it a
shot for a couple years and see how
it goes. I'm really looking forward to
it."
Logar was less sure of her situa
tion.
"I'm going to see how the season
goes," she said. "After that it's kind
of an open book. I might be study
ing for the LSAT or GMAT. 1 don't
think my tennis career is over yet. I
don't want to say that it is and I
don't want to say that it isn't."
Regardless of what the two do in
their careers after Stanford, it is
clear that they have already left
their mark on the Cardinal tennis
program, the national collegiate
tennis scene and the university they
represent.
