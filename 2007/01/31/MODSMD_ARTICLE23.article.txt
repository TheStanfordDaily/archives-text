It has been eighty-seven matches.That's
the number of team matches which seniors
Anne Yelsey and Theresa Logar of the
women's tennis team have played in their
careers.
87 also happens to be the number of
matches that the Cardinal has won with the

But she was quick to deflect talk about
her individual accomplishments. Instead,
Yelsey talked about her teammates.
"To be able to compete and train and
spend all this time with these talented ten
nis players and friends...it's just amazing."
she said.
Logar.an International Relations major

in her time with Stanford. She received the
