## Bruce back and ready for big time NCAA title, 2008 Olympics are junior's goals 
### SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Being a two-time NCAA cham
pion, five-time All-American and an
Olympian is more than many ath
letes could hope for in an entire ca
reer. But junior Caroline Bruce had
achieved all of that by the end of her
freshman year at Stanford.
As a freshman. Bruce took five
titles at the Pac-10 Championships,
won the 100 and 200 breaststroke
events at the 2005 NCAA Champi
onships and placed ninth in the 200
breast at the 2004 Olympics in
Athens.
"1 can't even describe what it was
like to compete in the Olympics,"
she said. "I never predicted that I
would be there in 2004 and I learned
so much about how to race without
being fearful of even the fastest
competitors."
Unfortunately, sidelined with a
shoulder injury, Bruce was unable to
carry her momentum into her soph
omore season. But after surgery last
January and extensive recovery
work, she is back in the water and
has made significant contributions
to the top-ranked Cardinal's unde
feated season.

"I was nervous to come back
after being out of the water for so
long." Bruce said. "Hut my team
mates and coach have been great.
They are all really supportive of
me."
It seems that Bruce had nothing
to be nervous about, as she has al
ready achieved NCAA "A" times in
the 200 individual medley and 100
and 200 breast events.
Most recently, she swept the 100
and 200 breast against USC on Jan
uary 20, knocking off highly-regard
ed Rebecca Soni in both victories.
Last week, College Swimming.com
named her National Collegiate
Swimmer of the Week.
"To have Caroline Bruce named
the College Swimming.com Swim
mer of the Week is a great tribute to
the comeback she has made," Stan
ford head coach Lea Maurer said.
"While we've had some others get
ting a lot of the spotlight this season,
she has been putting in a lot of work
behind the scenes and showed them
the hard work it takes to succeed at
this level. It's nice for her to get this
accolade."
For Bruce, it is a relief just to be
back in top form.
"It was really hard when I could
n't compete last year, and coming
hack I had doubts that 1 could never
get back to where I was," she said.
"But doing well so far this season
has been really encouraging for
me."
Bruce's previous successes and
impressive comeback have made
her a role model for her younger
teammates.
"It's really motivating to know
what Caroline did during her fresh

man year," freshman Elaine Bree
den said. "It makes winning events
at NCAAs as a freshman seem pos
sible."
Of course, Bruce is thrilled with
her past successes, but she has high
hopes for the future of the Stanford
team and herself.
"1 already have personal NCAA
championships,but I'd really like to
win the national championship with
the team," she said. "Some people
doubted us at the beginning of the
season, but I think we can show that
we are the best in the country."
Bruce's dreams lie beyond just
collegiate swimming. She hopes to
return to the Olympics in 2008.
Olympic trial competition runs in
the familv for Bruce. Her older sis

ter. Elizabeth, and older brother,
Michael, have competed at the U.S.
trials. Michael also swam at Stan
ford from 2000 to 2004.
"I'd love to go back to the
Olympics in 2008." Caroline Bruce
said."When 1 went in 2004.it was to
tally unexpected, but this time I'll
definitely be training hard for those
trials."
For now. Bruce is focusing on her
role as a leader of Stanford's young
team.
"Caroline and the other upper
classmen are great," Breeden said.
"'lTiey take care of [the younger
swimmers] in and out of the pool
and everyone always has smiles on
their faces."
