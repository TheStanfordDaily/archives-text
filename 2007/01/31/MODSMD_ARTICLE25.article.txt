# Fred Washington Men's Basketball
## Right said Fred Senior guard leads young team through words and actions 
### BY DANIEL NOVINSON 
Anthony Goods always appears
confident. The Lopez twins, al
ways humble. Lawrence Hill,
always composed.
Those are all great qualities, but none
hold a candle to Fred Washington — he al
ways speaks his mind. And though the senior
hasn't embraced a traditional leadership
role, his direct, no-nonsense approach has
helped one of the youngest teams in the
country keep a sense of perspective as their
season has taken off.
Fred Washington does not mince words.
The beat reporters have figured it out: when
they want to know what happened on the
court, they know who to ask.
Remember Stanford's toughest loss this
season, up at Oregon? Stanford outplayed
the Ducks on the floor, but Oregon drew 28
( ardinal fouls to win by seven.
Flayers were visibly upset with the offi
ciating after the game, but none spoke his
mind once the cameras turned on.They at
tributed the foul discrepancy to Oregon's
speed, with nary a word about the referees.
"('oaches are always telling us we need to
move our feet more," was all sophomore for
ward Lawrence 1 lill would allow.'T expected
[the foul calls)."
Not Washington though.
"I don't know whether they were fouls or
not. but we've got to talk to the refs before
games — ask them what a hand-check is
now," he said. " Ihey're small, so maybe it
seems quicker than most teams, but it's noth
ing we haven't faced all year."
Washington spoke his mind then.and he's
been speaking out ever since. Perhaps he's
not the most talkative guy. but when he does
speak, his teammates know to listen.

"I don't really go for the leader role," he
said."l'm not the one doing that rah-rah stuff.
I just talk when something needs to be said."
And, though few people saw it. one of his
finest hours came at Virginia in Stanford's
first game of 2(X)7. Sure, fans saw Trent John
son trust him to bring the ball up the court for
the game-winning drive and dish to
Lawrence Hill — even though he's a for
ward. not a point guard — but Washington's
true leadership moment was early in the
game. Stanford had given up several offen
sive rebounds in a row. and simply wasn't
matching Virginia's effort.
Enter Washington.
"I just grabbed the guys together and said
we aren't going to win the game like this." he
said.
It was nothing major: it didn't grab head
lines at the time. But it turned the game
around and set the stage for Hill to grab
those headlines just a hour later.
And that Virginia game set the stage for
bigger headlines in the ensuing games. The
Cardinal rattled off another five wins in the
next three weeks and made the biggest
splash of all this past weekend, knocking off
No. 3 UCLA and jumping into the Top 25.
After the stunner against the Bruins with
one of the best comebacks in Maples Pavil
ion history. Stanford players were visibly
pleased — and didn't have to hide their emo
tions from the cameras this time.
But once again Fred spoke up. He was a
leader up at Oregon, and he led at home too,
providing a much-needed sense of perspec
tive.
"You guys might glorify it, but we can't
look at this game and think this is what we
wanted to accomplish," he said after the
UCLA win. "This year is far from over. We
got Gonzaga coming up.Cal after that.and a
whole bunch of tough teams after that too."
Washington watched Josh Childress lead

Stanford to a 26-0 start his freshman season,
and saw Chris Hernandez — whom he
called "one of the best point guards in Stan
ford history" — set the tone with his compo
sure the past two seasons. I lis level-headed
ness. then, comes as no surprise.
Most remarkable of all is Washington's
poise — even when it comes to his own fu
ture. Though he is a senior academically, ma
joring in political science, he is eligible for an
extra year at Stanford after suffering an in
jury only six games into last year.
Accordingly, he has applied for a medical
redshirt and is confident he will receive it. If
he does, he has stated repeatedly he would
love to stay on the Farm.
"There's a certain number of games you
have to play to get a redshirt, and I'm under

it,"he said."So I'll get a fifth year."
But Coach Johnson has yet to promise
Washington, this team's most athletic player
and only starting upperclassman, a spot on
next year's roster, going so far as to refuse to
discuss the matter until mid-February.
"We're going to make that decision,"
Coach Johnson said Monday. "Me and Fred
are going to sit down and make that decision
two or three weeks before Senior Night
|March 3, versus Arizona]."
But Fred, again setting an example for his
teammates,takes it all in stride.
"I hope I'll spend next year at Stanford,
but if not, I'll still have great memories," he
said.
Given Washington's leadership, the best
of those memories might be yet to come. ■

Senior Fred Washington can be a quiet force on the court but isn't afraid to speak his mind.
