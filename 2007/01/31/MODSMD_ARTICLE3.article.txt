## Free music site creates ruckus Site gives free access to college students 
### LAURA RUMPF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All U.S. college students can
now enjoy free access to the
Ruckus Network's online music
download service, the ad-support
ed music company announced Jan.
22.
Previously, only students at uni
versities who had entered into a
formal agreement with Ruckus
could access the music database,
but the network is now open to
anyone with a valid university e
mail account.
According to a recent New York
Times article. Ruckus will feature

music from both major and inde
pendent record labels who will li
cense their music to the network
for less money than they generally
charge. The record labels believe
that college students are more like
ly to steal music than pay the $10 or
$15 monthly fee charged by many
networks; as a result they would
rather charge a small fee to Ruckus
than risk making no profit at all.
Ruckus now boasts a database
of over 2.1 million music tracks, as
well as a collection of over 4,000
movies.
The deal Ruckus brokered with
record labels has allowed the com
pany to expand its free services, but
students whose universities origi
nally signed agreements with the
network retain the exclusive privi
leges to download movies.
