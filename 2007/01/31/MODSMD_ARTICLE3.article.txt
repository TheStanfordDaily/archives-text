## Free music site creates ruckus Site gives free access to college students 
### LAURA RUMPF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All U.S. college students can
now enjoy free access to the
Ruckus Network's online music
download service, the ad-support
ed music company announced Jan.
22.
Previously, only students at uni
versities who had entered into a
formal agreement with Ruckus
could access the music database,
but the network is now open to
anyone with a valid university e
mail account.
According to a recent New York
Times article. Ruckus will feature

music from both major and inde
pendent record labels who will li
cense their music to the network
for less money than they generally
charge. The record labels believe
that college students are more like
ly to steal music than pay the $10 or
$15 monthly fee charged by many
networks; as a result they would
rather charge a small fee to Ruckus
than risk making no profit at all.
Ruckus now boasts a database
of over 2.1 million music tracks, as
well as a collection of over 4,000
movies.
The deal Ruckus brokered with
record labels has allowed the com
pany to expand its free services, but
students whose universities origi
nally signed agreements with the
network retain the exclusive privi
leges to download movies.
Stanford students can now down
load music to their computers, hut
several students familiar with the
service note that there are several
drawbacks to the system.
Ruckus uses Microsoft Windows
media technology, so songs can only
he played on a user's personal com
puter. The network is charging stu
dents $4.99 per month, or $19.99 per
semester, for the right to transfer
songs to portable devices compati
ble with the Microsoft format, in
cluding devices made by San Disk or
Creative, according to the compa
ny's Web site.
Ruckus' biggest drawback? The
music will not play on an Apple iPod
and is not compatible with Macin
tosh's iTunes software.
Ruckus President Michael Babel
thinks that this will not deter stu
dents from using his site.
"Even iPod users on campus will
use Ruckus because they can find
music they like before they buy it
from Apple or get it another way," he
said.
A number of Stanford students
disagree with this prediction, howev
er.
"Who wants [a download service]
that doesn't work on iTunes?" ques
tioned sophomore Sydney Chang. "I
mean almost everyone has that."
Other students expressed similar
sentiments.
"1 might use it occasionally to lis
ten to a song, but not as my primary

downloading program," sophomore
Becca Eskin said.
Sophomore Eric Ma confirmed
record labels' worst fears when
asked if he would use the service de
spite its incompatibility with iTunes
and iPod.
"Probably not," he said, "because
it's so easy to get free music from
other places."
Despite Ruckus' limitations, the
site does have its advantages. The
download process is neither complicat
ed nor does it require students to re
lease much personal information, ac
cording to several who have used the
program already. Interested students
can download Ruckus at www.ruckus
