### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Brothers Don and Robert Winston spoke about
their experiences as activists in the l%()s Civil Rights
Movement as part of a Living History program in
Cedro Lounge Sunday night. The Winston brothers
were flown to Stanford to participate in the program,
the brainchild of Residential Education.
Don Winston spoke about his experience as a col
lege freshman in Atlanta in 1968 when Dr. Martin
Luther King. Jr. was assassinated, while Robert dis
cussed his participation as one of the leaders of the
Howard High School student sit-in at a white lunch
counter in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1%().
"We wanted to have a Martin Luther King-spirit
ed event dealing with racial and cultural issues." said
senior Mark Grimaldi, a residential assistant in
Cedro. "Having people come talk about their experi
ences seemed like the coolest option."
Don Winston said that he remembers the evening
of the assassination vividly.
"There was a talent show at one of the fraternities
scheduled for that night so we were waiting around to
go to that when there was a news flash saying that
King had been shot." he said. "Everyone in our dorm
was pretty much frozen. We were shocked that some
thing so drastic could happen."
Don Winston attended Clark Atlanta University,
home to five historically black colleges and to ap
proximately 1,500 students. Many students felt a need
to respond somehow to King's assassination.
"We were emotional and felt we needed to do
something, Don said. "Some people wanted to go
tear up the town, but Dr. Benjamin Mays, the presi
dent of Morehouse College, called the student lead
ers from the five colleges together and talked to them
about leadership."
He described the mixture of chaos and calm that
night, recalling scenes of people milling in the streets
and student leaders using megaphones urging people
not to riot.
"We went to the talent show to seek some direc
tion and to see what we could do at that time," Don
Winston said.
Before the funeral. King's body lay in state at Spel
man College. Don Winston viewed the dead civil
rights leader three times before the lines became un
bearably long. He remembered taking pictures and
said he foolishly sold them.
"I had never seen so many people together as dur
ing King's funeral," he said. "The feeling was to keep
Atlanta peaceful and to respect the dream."
Robert Winston spoke about his experiences as
one of the leaders of a ( hattanooga, Tennessee high
school student sit-in in 1 %0. Starting Feb. 19, students
from Howard I ligh School occupied all of the stools
