Stanford in 20 years from now may look
dramatically different from the Stanford of
today, University Manager of the I'A and
Planning Office David Lenox said last
night at an event sponsored by the Stan
ford I listoi ical Society.
During his hour-long talk, which he
called "A Snapshot in l ime." Lenox out
lined his vision for campus development
according to what he called "academic
precincts," which he designated as a "series
of Last-West quads to order and organize
the parts and pieces of the University."
These quads range from the existing Sci
ence and Engineering Quad to a proposed
Arts Community just east of the Oval.
1 .enox sees the future of Stanford's cam
pus in terms of these small academic com
munities, which would function both as au
tonomous units and as part of the larger
community. These quads would also be an
efficient use of available space, since cam
pus expansion is limited to two million new
square feet by the General Use Permit
(GUP). The changes Lenox discussed last
night would use up approximately one mil
lion square feet of this available area.
Lenox also spoke of future plans for the
Graduate School of Business, the School of
Medicine, the Cummings Art Building and
The Stanford Daily, among other buildings
scattered across campus.

"I think its
fascinating to
see the work
the university
is doing."
1 ie ended his talk by discussing sustain
able development and praising Stanford's
recent grade of A- in sustainability from
the Sustainable Endowments Institute. He
called sustainability a tradition at Stanford,
one that dates back to the original campus
plans that Leland and Jane Stanford com
missioned from Frederick Law Olmsted —
the architect famous for New York City's
Central Park.
"1 think it's fascinating to see the work
the University is doing." sophomore
Luukas lives said after Lenox's talk. "I
hope they remain public and open with
this development and continue to make an
effort to reach out to keep students and
others involved in the process. I also wish I
were 40 years younger — if my kids come
here and get to enjoy these changes, I'm re
ally going to envy them."

on Tuesday evening about the architectural future of the Stanfor d Campus.
