## Climate Change petitions for a pristine Stanford Students push for fight against global warming 
### JOHN LAXSON 
The Stanford Climate Change Cam
paign.a byproduct of Students for Sustain
able Stanford, has met with growing stu
dent enthusiasm in its push to encourage
Stanford to implement measures to re
duce its effect on global warming.
Students for a Sustainable Stanford — an
organization that introduces and promotes
sustainability projects on campus, including
the annual Energy Bowl — organized the

climate change campaign about a year ago.
The campaign calls on the University to
lower its carbon emissions by 10 percent
from 1990 levels by 2020. lint sophomore
Lauren 1 inzer, the president of the cam
paign. was quick to frame the group's
goals in a positive light.
"We're not criticizing,"she said."This is
an opportunity to step up."
The group has managed to generate
wide-spread support on campus. In Octo
ber. members rallied with other organiza
tions in White Plaza to start spreading
awareness. Since then, over 1,200 signa
tures from faculty, staff and students have
been logged on the group's Web site. Most
recently, the group's Monday night screen

ing of the Al Gore movie "An Inconve
nient Truth" in Cubberly Auditorium was
standing room only.
Climate Change members have brought
their concerns to the University administra
tion, meeting with President John 1 lennessy
last spring to discuss a 48-page report that
the group had drawn up outlining its ideas
and goals. While the organization failed to
gain traction at the time, members hope to
meet with I lennessy again soon, this time
with a demonstration of student support in
the success of the online petition.
"We don't want to be confrontational,"
Finzer said."We just want to show that stu
dents support making the kinds of changes
that would be required to do this."
