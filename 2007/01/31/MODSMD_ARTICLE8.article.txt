## Congress discusses climate Panel hears climate "spin" allegations from scientists

WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal scientists have
been pressured by the White House to play down
global warming, advocacy groups testified Tuesday
at the Democrats' first investigative hearing since
taking control of Congress.
The hearing focused on allegations White
House officials for years have micromanaged the
government's climate programs and have closely
controlled what scientists have been allowed to
tell the public.
"It appears there may have been an orchestrat
ed campaign to mislead the public about climate
change," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. Wax
man is chairman of the Oversight and Govern
ment Reform Committee and a critic of the Bush
administration's environmental policies, including
its views on climate.
Climate change also was a leading topic in the
Senate, where presidential contenders for 200S
lined up at a hearing called by Sen. Barbara Boxer.
They expounded — and at times tried to outdo
each other — on why they believed Congress must
act to reduce heat-trapping "greenhouse" gases.
■■TTiis is a problem whose time has come," Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y.. proclaimed.
"This is an issue over the years whose time has

come," echoed Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
Sen. Barack Obama, D-111., said "for decades
far too many have ignored the warning" about cli
mate change. "Will we look back at today and say
this was the moment we took a stand?"
At the House hearing, two private advocacy
groups produced a survey of 279 government cli
mate scientists showing that many of them say
they have been subjected to political pressure
aimed at downplaying the climate threat. Their
complaints ranged from a challenge to using the
phrase "global warming" to raising uncertainty on
issues on which most scientists basically agree, to
keeping scientists from talking to the media.
The survey and separate interviews with scien
tists "has brought to light numerous ways in which
U.S. federal climate science has been filtered, sup
pressed and manipulated in the last five years,"
Francesca Grifo, a senior scientist at the Union of
Concerned Scientists, told the committee.
Grifo's group, along with the Government Ac

countahility Project, which helps whistle-blowers,
produced the report.
Drew Shindell. a climate scientist with NASA's
Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said that cli
mate scientists frequently have been dissuaded
from talking to the media about their research,
though NASA's restrictions have been eased.
Prior to the change, interview requests of climate
scientists frequently were "routed through the
White House" and then turned away or delayed,
said Shindell. He described how a news release on
his study forecasting a significant warming in
Antarctica was "repeatedly delayed, altered and wa
tered down" at the insistence of the White House.
Some Republican members of the committee
questioned whether science and politics ever can
be kept separate.
"I am no climate-change denier," said Rep.Tom
Davis of Virginia, the top Republican on the com
mittee, but he questioned whether "the issue of
politicizing science has itself become politicized."
