## Cuba TV shows Castro meeting Healthier Castro meets with Chavez 
### ANITA SNOW ASSOCIATED PRESS 
HAVANA (AP) - Cuban state
television on Tuesday showed a
video of a healthier looking Fidel
Castro meeting and speaking with
Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, the first images of the ail
ing leader shown in three months.
The report said the 10-minute
video clip was taped on Monday
during a two-hour private meeting
in Havana that was not previously
publicized.
"It's not a lost battle," Castro
said of his health problems. "Nor
will it be," Chavez responded.
The newest images seemed to
be aimed at knocking down the
most recent round of reports about
Castro's health, including a report
in the Spanish newspaper El Pais
earlier this month that described
his health as "grave."
Both leaders appeared to take
pains in the video to make clear
when the session occurred. Chavez
could be heard saying that it began
at 3 p.m. on Jan 29. Castro read
aloud a headline of an article dated
Saturday from the Argentine
newspaper Clarin.
Castro, who was standing, more
looked alert and heavier than in
previous images that had showed

him much more thin and frail.
Dressed in a red, white and blue
track suit, the 80-year-old was also
shown sitting and drinking orange
juice.
"Fidel has said that we have not
lost this battle," Chavez said in the
video. "I'll say something more: we
have won it."
'ITie broadcast came six months
after Castro's July 31 announce
ment that he had undergone intes
tinal surgery and was provisionally
ceding power to his younger broth
er Raul. Castro had looked thinner
and frailer in the last video images,
which aired on Oct. 28.
Chavez said in Tuesday's video
that he found his friend to be "of
good humor, with a good face and
in good spirits." He said the pair
discussed a variety of issues, includ
ing the world's energy crisis and
that Castro showed "much clarity,
as always in his ideas and analysis."
Castro stunned the nation six
months ago when he temporarily
stepped aside for his younger
brother, the 75-year-old defense
minister. Since then, Raul Castro
has led the nation at the head of a
collaborative leadership that has
kept the government running
calmly in his brother's absence
from public life.
Chavez said he felt "happiness,
jubilation, to find Fidel as 1 have
found him" and thanked "every
one: the relatives, comrades, doc
tors, nurses for the great effort they
are making."
