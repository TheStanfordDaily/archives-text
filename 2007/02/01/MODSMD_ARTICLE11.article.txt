Then-Senior Larry Diamond,
now Poli. Sci. Prof. Larry Diamond,
wrote an editorial on Jan. 31,1974 ar
guing that "political thought and dis
cussion have themselves withered
away to almost nothing on this cam
pus," along with concern for social is
sues.
"The energy shortage and the
huge oil profits, the state of our cities,
our electoral system, the conflict be
tween ecological and energy impera
tives, the federal budget priorities
and the size of the military budget in
particular, the opportunities for mi
norities in society today, the Arab-Is
raeli controversy, Russia and her re
pression of courageous dissidents,
dictatorships supported with U. S. aid
- these are crucial issues that will pro
foundly affect our lives and those of
our children."
Diamond's solution?
"Imagine that we could stimulate
large numbers of people in this com
munity to argue with each other now
and then, about some of the great is
sues, argue factually and intelligently,
without the kind of bitterness which
made these kinds of serious and fair
minded discussions so difficult a few
years ago. Isn't this one of the vital
missions of a great university?"
Some things never change.
