"The reading's off the chart —
over 20,000," said Qui-Gon Jin in
astonishment. "Even Master
Yoda doesn't have a midichlorian
count that high."
In Star Wars Episode I. Qui-
Gon took a blood sample from
young Anakin Skywalker to
check for midichlorians. the
force-sensing life forms that take
up residence inside an organism's
cells. Midichlorians may be fic
tional, but researchers just discov
ered something similar in a galaxy
we can call our own.
Australian pathologist Nate
Lo was studying ticks when he no
ticed a new bacterium infecting
his specimens. ITie bizarre organ
ism was living in the ticks' mito
chondria. a part of a cell that con
verts food into energy. The bac
terium wriggles its way into a mi
tochondrion and devours it, leav
ing nothing but an empty sac.
Take a second to think about
how supremely weird this is. The
new bacterium is a parasite that
preys on mitochondria. Mito
chondria, in their earliest incarna
tion, were free-living parasites.
Now they are part of animals like
the tick, itself a blood-sucking
parasite. In effect, the new bac
terium is a parasite's parasite's
parasite.
And, of course, it had to have a
name. Since it makes its home in
side cells, Lo decided to name it
after the intracellular force-sen
sors of Star Wars. With George
Lucas' blessing, the new bacteri
um was christened Midichloria
mitochondrii. (Lo's paper nar
rowly edged out a competitor
proposing a much less colorful
name.)
The naming of this odd organ
ism isn't the only case of art in
spiring science. Fruit fly geneti
cists have long been lessening the
tedium of lab research by giving
quirky names to new genes. Many
of these names come from pop
culture, entertainment and even
literature.
For example, fruit flies with a
mutation in a gene called tinman
don't develop hearts. If the flies
could survive, they might join the
unfortunate metallic "Wizard of
Oz" character in singing "If I only
had a heart..."
Ken and limbic flies might
wish for another body part —
these mutants have no genitalia,
and their nether regions are as
featureless as those of the plastic
dolls
Fly mutations can also have
artistic merit. Normal flies have
