"The reading's off the chart —
over 20,000," said Qui-Gon Jin in
astonishment. "Even Master
Yoda doesn't have a midichlorian
count that high."
In Star Wars Episode I. Qui-
Gon took a blood sample from
young Anakin Skywalker to
check for midichlorians. the
force-sensing life forms that take
up residence inside an organism's
cells. Midichlorians may be fic
tional, but researchers just discov
ered something similar in a galaxy
we can call our own.
Australian pathologist Nate
Lo was studying ticks when he no
ticed a new bacterium infecting
his specimens. ITie bizarre organ
ism was living in the ticks' mito
chondria. a part of a cell that con
verts food into energy. The bac
terium wriggles its way into a mi
tochondrion and devours it, leav
ing nothing but an empty sac.
Take a second to think about
how supremely weird this is. The
new bacterium is a parasite that
preys on mitochondria. Mito
chondria, in their earliest incarna
tion, were free-living parasites.
Now they are part of animals like
the tick, itself a blood-sucking
parasite. In effect, the new bac
terium is a parasite's parasite's
parasite.
And, of course, it had to have a
name. Since it makes its home in
side cells, Lo decided to name it
after the intracellular force-sen
sors of Star Wars. With George
Lucas' blessing, the new bacteri
um was christened Midichloria
mitochondrii. (Lo's paper nar
rowly edged out a competitor
proposing a much less colorful
name.)
The naming of this odd organ
ism isn't the only case of art in
spiring science. Fruit fly geneti
cists have long been lessening the
tedium of lab research by giving
quirky names to new genes. Many
of these names come from pop
culture, entertainment and even
literature.
For example, fruit flies with a
mutation in a gene called tinman
don't develop hearts. If the flies
could survive, they might join the
unfortunate metallic "Wizard of
Oz" character in singing "If I only
had a heart..."
Ken and limbic flies might
wish for another body part —
these mutants have no genitalia,
and their nether regions are as
featureless as those of the plastic
dolls
Fly mutations can also have
artistic merit. Normal flies have
tiny bristles on their wings, which
grow in neat lines, all facing the same
direction. But Van Gogh flies are dif
ferent. Their wing bristles are all
over the place, swirling and looping
like the painted sky of "The Starry
Night."
A biblical mutant is called Lot.
Lot of the Bible was the only man to
escape the doomed city of Sodom.
He and his family were warned by
God not to look back as they fled.
Lot's wife tried to sneak a peek, and
God turned her into a pillar of salt.
What does this have to do with fruit
flies? It turns out wild-type fruit flies

are repelled by strong concentra
tions of salt. Flies who don't mind
bri ny conditions have the Lot muta
tion.
My personal favorite gene is
named Kenny. Mutant Kenny flies
have a defective immune system.
When exposed to bacteria, they
drop like — well, like flies.This pen
chant for death is something they
share with South Park's Kenny, who
manages to keel over in every
episode.
Personally, I'm a big fan of cre
ative naming in scientific discoveries.
But in some contexts, clever names
lose their charm. For example, what
works in the lab can get awkward in
the clinic. If Midicliloria mitochon
drii were infecting humans, would it
get such a glib name?
A real-life example of this prob

lem involves a gene called Sonic
hedgehog, after the speedy blue Sega
character. In humans. Sonic hedge
hog is critical to normal embryonic
development, and babies with a mu
tant version of the gene end up
grossly deformed. The worst cases
have one eye in the middle of their
heads, a floppy proboscis instead of a
nose and severe brain abnormalities.
Most are stillborn. Should grieving
parents be told their dead baby had a
gene named after a video game?
It's probable that some human
genes will be renamed in response to
such issues. But there's no reason to
change names in other species.
Midichloria mitochondrii can still
use the Force.
