## UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AnthSci and CASA merge into one dept. New dept. to offer more intro courses 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The School of Humanities and
Sciences (H&S) quietly decided in
mid-January to combine the Anthro
pological Sciences (AnthSci) and
Cultural and Social Anthropology
(CASA) departments, and the facul
ty's reaction to the merger has been
mixed.
"No one from Anthro Sciences
was involved in the decision in any

way — it was entirely handed down
from higher administrative levels,"
said Prof. John Rick, chair of the
AnthSci department."ln Anthro Sci
ences we are surprised to see this sort
of decision made in this way."
Because the details of the merger
are still largely unclear. Rick and his
peers are uncertain about how long
the process will take and about how
it will ultimately impact faculty, stu
dents and staff.
"Whatever planning and fore
thought that might have gone into
this major move either does not exist
or has not been communicated to
us." Rick said. "From what little we
have heard, we would expect the
merger to have significant impact on
faculty, if nothing more than the time

and effort of assembling a new de
partment out of quite divergent
parts."
According to Dean of ll&S
Sharon Long, her office made
queries to both departments last
spring to get a sense of their strategy
and plans, and the I l&S Curriculum
Committee carried out a periodic re
view of the undergraduate majors
this year. Consequently, the dean's
office concluded that integrating the
two departments would strengthen
the overall anthropology program in
terms of research and education.
"(Nearly there are distinct and dif
ferent areas of research in some parts
of AnthSci and CASA, but the
shared topics and strengths are also
very noteworthy," Long wrote in an

email to The Daily. "Many depart
ments have a wide range of research
and ver\ distinct and different disci
plinary and scholarly approaches
and assumptions.
"These departments are extraoi
dinarily strong; indeed, their breadth
allows students to train in a multi
and inter-disciplinary way. - ' she
added. "1 have come to believe that
the wide span of work and approach
in the two anthropology depart
ments would better benefit students
undergraduate and graduate alike
— if the two departments were re
united in one integrated depart
ment."
The timing of the merger was due
in part to the recent loss of faculty
members from both departments.
"In deciding how best to main
tain strength in the overall field ot
anthropology, we needed to choose
how to allocate resources for faculty
searches," Long noted. "The more
we looked at this issue, the more we
felt that new faculty should be cho
sen from the broad field of anthro
pology. rather than by assigning
some faculty slots to one depart
ment versus the other."
University of Chicago Prof.
Tanya Lulu mann — an expert in so
cial and medical anthropology —
will soon be joining the anthropolo
gy faculty at Stanford as part of
H&S's effort to rebuild the faculty
base.
"I am very happy that we are re
cruiting another senior female col
league' who will bring not just out
standing research and teaching to
Stanford, but also impressive lead
ership and mentoring skills." Long
wrote.
The H&S Curriculum Commit
tee will be working with department
faculty to sustain the breadth of top
ical coverage currently offered by
both AnthSci and CASA. while at
the same time developing a set of in
troductory courses to allow under
graduates to explore the discipline.
"I think this will be a big advan
tage for undergraduates because at
present, students have to choose the
department in which they want to
major without 112 irst being able to get
a broad survey of the field," Long
said. "Within a unified department,
students would have the chance to
explore more topics before deciding
on upper division electives. 1 think
when students and faculty look back
in a year or two they will conclude
this was a great idea. This is certain
ly in the spirit of Stanford's increas
ing emphasis on multidisciplinary
and interdisciplinary scholarship
and teaching."
