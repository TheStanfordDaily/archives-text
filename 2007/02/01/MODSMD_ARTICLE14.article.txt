## Tresidder hosts anti-racism speaker Contentions speaker takes on affirmative action 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
A firebrand crusader who runs an anti-racism
association in Tennessee criticized people who be
lieve that racism is no longer an issue in the Unit
ed States.
Speaking at the Oak West Lounge in Tresidder
Union, Tim Wise,director of the newly-formed As
sociation for White Anti-Racist Education
(AWARE), encouraged students to take responsi
bility for confronting lingering racism in American
society.
"The only reason you're all here to hear me
talk, the only reason that I have been so successful
in getting people to listen to what I have to say. is
because 1 fit the aesthetic," Wise said. "Colored
people have been saying the things I'm about to
say for years. Any colored person could give this
talk much better than 1 and could give it a lot
cheaper than I do too."
Wise went on to present the audience with a hy
pothetical question and challenged them to re
move diluting terminology from the racial dia
logue.
"First, would you be willing to accept what I
have to say if it came out of the mouth of a col
ored person?" he asked. "And second, are we
ready to have a conversation about racism rather
than diversity, because those are completely dif
ferent dialogues. Oftentimes when we confuse
the two. we lose ourselves in the minutiae of di
versity and we forget what we're supposed to be
talking about in the first place. Diversity is such a
vague word: it means everything and nothing at
the same time."
According to Wise, too many conversations
about race begin with the presumption that it ap
plies only to minorities. I le claimed that the prob
lem with such an approach is that it segregates the
races rather than improving a fuller understanding
of minorities' experiences. I le also suggested that
it is dangerous to assume racial questions refer
only to people of color, because whites may feel
they have been wronged when special accommo
dations are made for minorities.
Wise discussed what he deems is an incorrect
view of race in relation to the debate over affirma
tive action in college admissions.
"When underrepresented minorities in the ap
plicant pool are given any extra points based on
their race, people claim that the rules are being
bent for them." he said. "But the rules have been
bent for the privileged norm forever."
Me said that students with SAT scores and
grades significantly below others in a given univer

sity's applicant pool arc often offered admission if
they arc the children of alumni. When universities
give extra points in the admissions process to stu
dents with "rigorous high school curricula." he
claimed, they are indirectly favoring white stu
dents who have greater access to high schools thai
offer more honors classes.
Wise also explained why he speaks out against
what he views as modern racism.
"Many white people don't want to deal with
this problem because they feel like they did not

cause the mess." he said. "Sure, it's true that they
aren't directly responsible tor the marginali/.ation
of races throughout history. But guilt and respon
sibility are not the same thing."
"People start taking action only when they be
come tired of the funk, of the stench of injustice
toxitying our environment." he added." Iliat's why
I fight racism, to provide a cleaner, sounder socie
ty for my children and mv grandchildren."
