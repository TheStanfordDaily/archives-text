## High-stakes EE exams elicit stress, pressure Fewer than 60 percent pass annual exams Part one of two 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This is the first of a two-part series
about the high-stakes doctoral quali
fying exam in the electrical engineer
ing department. Part Two will run in
Friday's Daily.
It happens every year: Stressed-

out students with nerv
ous looks on their faces
roam the halls of
Packard and the engi
neering quad. The slow
start to the New Year
exhibited by electrical

engineering graduate students is not
just a holiday hangover. For many
HE students, regular life shuts down
until the doctoral qualifying exams
(quals) — held in the second or
third week of winter quarter — are
over.

Hie most impos
ing of several hurdles
on the way to a Ph.D.
degree, the Stanford
HE department's con
troversial qualifying
exams are known as

one of the most intimidating selec
tion processes in the country. Two
factors contribute to the stress and
pressure of the week Hie first is the
sheer numbers: ()l the over 150 stu
dents who take the quals each year,
no more than M percent will pass.

The second isth.it most students who
fail their two attempts will have to
leave the program without getting
doctoral degrees.
The I I qualifying exams are held
in the span of one week in January.
I very candidate has a 10-minute ses
sion with each ol 10 faculty members
Each professor questions the student
on a topic in the field, then scores the
student between one and 10. The
scores are added up and .ill students
are ranked in order.The faculty meet to de
cide where the passing line will be. and all
students above that score pass.
If and when they pass,students can file as
Ph.D. candidates. The benefits don't stop
there — students without research advisors
anecdotally report that professors are more
willing to discuss research with them after
they have passed.
The student-selected "examining com
mittee" must comprise professors from at
least three of eight subject areas, ranging
from computer hardware and software to
low-level device physics.
Examiners vary widely in their styles and
manners. Some are known to ask the same
type of question each year. Many ask basic
knowledge questions, but some ask brain
teasers or open-ended design questions.
Some professors interact with the student,
ask for clarification and give hints. Qthers
take a less hands-on approach and read their
email silently during the exam. One profes
sor brought a student to the parking lot and
conducted the examination while he re
parked his car.
Though a few daring students choose to
take the quals "cold turkey," most begin
studying in the fall. As the date nears, stu
dents have been known to de-emphasize
coursework and research before catching up
immediately after the exams are over.
The varying "styles of the examiners"
force students to prepare for everything in

their chosen subject areas. Second-year doc
toral candidate Tom O'Sullivan formed a
study group, meeting with three friends
from the department on a regular basis in
the fall and in January. I'he group practiced
the 10-minute format with past years' ques
tions which are available online.
Third-year Ph.D. candidate Kim Shultz
tried both preparation techniques. Accord
ing to Shultz, she put in "about four hours"
of studying for the 2005 exam; she "subse
quently" finished in the bottom quintile. In
2006. with a more focused attitude, she fin
ished in the top 10 — a score high enough to
merit a one-year graduate scholarship while
she decided on a research field. Shultz even
saw a silver lining in the normally high-pres
sure examinations.
"Quals would be fun if |they] weren't so
stressful," she said.
Since they are designed to facilitate aca
demic research, the quals come under fire
for not involving research skills in the exam
ination process. Shultz said, "Quals have
nothing to do with anything," implying that
the 10-minute format makes it difficult to
show broad academic knowledge and that
the style of questioning does not reflect the
ability of a student to perform extensive re
search.
All of this adds up to a day of high-stakes
interviews for students, with academic fu
tures on the line. Still, some are not as wor
ried. Second-year doctoral candidate Drew
Hall told The Daily. "I didn't feel very
stressed...people hype it up too much."
