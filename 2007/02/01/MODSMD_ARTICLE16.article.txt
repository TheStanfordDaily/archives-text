## Editor's Welcome 
### 
Dt'nr Reader,
When I w as five, 1 began publishing a
weekly called The Hohmann
Times. 1 phoned up family and jot
ted down dispatches from cousins, aunts and
grandparents. I didn't break any major sto
ries. except that we were having Pot Roast
for dinner. But this venture sparked my in
terest in journalism and impressed upon me
the value of the news.
At Stanford, I have found my calling in
the offices of The Daily. Now. in my first
issue as Editor-in-Chief. I am leading a
newspaper that tells the stories of what I be
lieve is the most exciting and dynamic insti
tution of higher learning in the world.
ITiis is the University's newspaper of
record. It is a watchdog,a storyteller and oc
casionally an igniter of campus conversa
tion. It is also where I've met my closest
friends. I am proud to admit that I have
spent more time in The Daily's office than in
class, but don't tell my professors. There's
nothing more rewarding than putting out a
paper every day, more exciting than break
ing a story or more fulfilling than explaining
a complex issue in a way everyone can un
derstand.
Our most valuable asset is our reputa
tion. When you read an item in TTie Stanford
Daily, you should be able to count on its ve
racity.
Last week.The Daily failed you with the
squash story. There was a conflict of interest
and fabrication of important facts. Thank
fully. my highly capable predecessor acted
decisively. The editor highlighted in the
story will not participate in Ilie Daily this
volume.
Effective today, there will be zero toler
ance for ethical transgressions. The Daily
has adopted a clearer anonymous source
policy, clarified its restrictions on manipu
lating photos and instituted newsroom
wide ethics training. We will work overtime
to gain and maintain your full trust.
With my name at the top of the mast
head. I am responsible for all content in the
newspaper. I take on this obligation with the
utmost seriousness to ensure that vou can

depend on w hat you read in these pages.
The Daily will better cater to our online
readers. Our stories will be infused with
more multimedia, and the Web page will be
more interactive. Watch for some exciting
features to be rolled out in the weeks to
come.
We are debuting Page Two, a compilation
of a calendar and fun. localized features.
Monday Mayhem will stress campus arts
and style. Photographers will be given more
autonomy to pursue high-end photojour
nalism. Our editors will solicit op-eds from
prominent members of the community. We
will cover more varsity sports on campus.
There will be a more compelling mix of
news.sports and opinions on the Front Page.
Hie Daily is the newspaper for the entire
University, not just undergraduates. We are
actively recruiting new staff from all corners
of campus.
As the premier source for Stanford news,
we are committed to being responsive, fair
and transparent. My office door will always
be open; I typically work from 5 p.m. to 3
a.m. Sunday through Thursday evenings.
My desk line is 650-725-2100.extension 501.
And. to prove that I'm serious about being
reachable and approachable, my cell phone
number is 651-331-6553. I will always an
swer emails (eic@daily.stanford.edu). From
today on.The Daily will print the email ad
dress of each reporter at the bottom of
every story. And. of course, you can contin
ue to post comments on our Web site.
It you have an idea for a story you'd like
to see in the paper, let me know. It you ever
have questions about anything, contact me.
And if you want to write for the paper,
please shoot me an email.
I speak for all of the more than 150 peo
ple involved with our newspaper when I say
we will do everything in our power to bring
you the best paper we can every morning.
Sincerely,
