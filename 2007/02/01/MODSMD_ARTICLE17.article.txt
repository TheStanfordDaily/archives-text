# Do you love me now
## that I can dance? 
### 
An admission: What I'm about to
share is a deep personal revelation,
something I carry close to my heart
and have only ever told one person (plus. I
guess, whoever was behind us in line at the
CoHo).
Growing up. I was an awkward, nay. an
ungainly youth, prone to hovering about
the fringes of social mediocrity. This took a
slight turn north in high school when I dis
covered casual disdain and the word "di
alectic." but even the holy demon of sar
casm didn't quite save me from social
scathing. During my first months at Stan
lord. unwieldiness clung to me like a Con
federate Hag decal to the bumper of a
Dodge Ram squealing down an Arkansas
highway
At frat parties, I was the one standing
outside, sucking down cigarette after ciga
rette. pretending to pretend I didn't recog
nize people for whatever modicum of social
standing that might afford me. While I
scoured the can-littered lawns for someone
anyone! — having a worse time than 1.
my roommate would invariably come up
and sloshedly request my presence in the
acrid.groping clusterfuck known as a dance
floor. At this point. I always suddenly re
membered an impending film essay and im
mediately took off. teetering down May
field in neon pink heels, a cloud of Marlboro

billowing in my wake.
This may not surprise you. but I cannot
dance. I mean. I've tried, but no matter how
many drinks I consume or Ricky Martin
videos I watch on You Tube. 1 just can't do it.
My feet stay planted, my arms flail wildly
and — my god. you mean my pelvis is sup
posed to MOVE? Because it most assured
ly does not.
And that is where my shameful secret
comes in: l or the past several years. 1 have
nursed the cherished ambition that one day
I might find myself at another lame frat
party.sipping my Keystone Light in the cor
ner. when all of a sudden the first notes of
the hot 'Ws jam "Everybody Dance Now"
(ill the air. Instantly I drop my cup and. to
my visible shock, my arms shoot out in time
with the notes. A circle forms around me as
the chorus plays and I. with a look of aston
ishment and delight, execute a carefully


Lewin
■ Out and Aboutski
choreographed series of tlips. twists,
turns and possibly a few break-dance
staples. I drop to a bow as the music
ends, then push through the crowd,
pick up my discarded drink and strut
out the front door, a hero of the
downtrodden and arrhythmic.
I've actually tried to make this
fantasy come true. At a Slav Dom
party last year. I asked the DJ to spin
"Everybody Dance Now" and sur
reptitiously sidled off to a corner,
waiting for my big moment. When
the song finally came on. I beamed,
threw out one arm and — spilled my
drink on the guy standing next to me.
I guess the music wasn't in me after
all.
I revealed this dream scenario for
the first time to my best friend the
other day. with great emotional in
tensity, going into small details, gen
uine tears brimming in my eyes. And
then, to my horror, she laughed at
me. I leveled with her about all those
years of pain, insecurity, wondering
where the cool kids bought their vin
tage blazers, and all she had was
laughter. Then I haughtily replied
that I was doomed to be the sad
clown — laughing on the outside,
but weeping on the inside. And she
laughed at that too, the bitch.
I guess I see her point, though. It
is kind of goofy.
When you get right down to it. I'm
kind of goofy. Most of the thoughts

that constantly occupy my mind are
marginal at best;some are downright
nonsensical. 1 suspect it is not the
ideas themselves that others find hu
morous, but how seriously 1 take
them.
The other day this came to a head
as I set the table for dinner with my
boyfriend. He recalled having trou
ble remembering where the utensils
went as a child; I stared at him in con
fusion.
"But sweetie, it's so obvious. The
knife is holding the spoon hostage
and the fork is coming to rescue
her!"
He scanned my face anxiously for
signs that 1 was joking. Such a sign
did not exist.
My long-held views on tableware
were somewhat validated when I
took Spanish in high school and
learned that the words for "knife"
and "fork" are masculine, while
"spoon" is the saucy maiden I've al
ways known her to be.
This may explain, in part, why
Russian and I just can't get along: In
Russian."knife" is masculine,but the
language short-sightedly casts the
spoon and fork as sweet little ladies
of the table. Frankly inconceivable.
The knife and fork may work in un
easy camaraderie (see also: open
faced sandwiches, steak), but the
fork and spoon are brazen lovers.
Anyone who's ever eaten spaghetti
will tell you that.
Except my boyfriend. I explained
this complex history — romance, re
venge, the whole bit — while he
shook his head slowly. It's just silver
ware. he told me. I felt like I lost a

dear friend.
There are, in my life, scores of
things like this. Late night trips to
the mausoleum with friends, stand
ing frozen, looking out of the cor
ners of our eyes at the Angel of
Grief statue, straining to catch her
in the act of winking or stifling a
cough. The crippling fear that
gummy worms will turn into real
worms once I've bitten them. When
I was in elementary school, 1 used to
sit cross-legged on the floor of my
walk-in closet with the doors closed,
pressing the palms of my hands hard
into my eyes and praying until I
shook that when I opened the door
again I 'd walk out onto the set of the
Nickelodeon game show "Double
Dare." Now every morning as I sift
through hangers to find my least
wrinkled hoodie, 1 still hold out
hope that today will be the day I fi
nally get splashed with that coveted
green slime.
I am confident that I'm not alone
here. In one way or another, we all
wish to live in a different world, a
better world — whether that world
entails wolfing down cheesecake
without gaining weight, ditching the
electoral college system, wowing the
crowds with your smooth moves or
owning silverware that has an au
tonomous love life is completely up
to you.

Kill 's second most cherished ambition
is to u<> on Jeopardy! and dominate the
"Presidential Nicknames" category.
Her third most cherished ambition is
to receive fan mail from von at

knife is holding the spoon hostage

He scanned my face anxiously for
signs that 1 was joking. Such a sign
did not exist.
My long-held views on tableware
were somewhat validated when I
took Spanish in high school and
learned that the words for "knife"

"spoon" is the saucy maiden I've al

This may explain, in part, why
Russian and I just can't get along: In
Russian."knife" is masculine,but the
language short-sightedly casts the
spoon and fork as sweet little ladies
of the table. Frankly inconceivable.
The knife and fork may work in un
easy camaraderie (see also: open
faced sandwiches, steak), but the
fork and spoon are brazen lovers.
Anyone who's ever eaten spaghetti

An admission: What I'm about to
share is a deep personal revelation,
something I carry close to my heart
and have only ever told one person (plus. I
guess, whoever was behind us in line at the
CoHo).
Growing up. I was an awkward, nay. an
ungainly youth, prone to hovering about
the fringes of social mediocrity. This took a
slight turn north in high school when I dis
covered casual disdain and the word "di
alectic." but even the holy demon of sar
casm didn't quite save me from social
scathing. During my first months at Stan
lord. unwieldiness clung to me like a Con
federate Hag decal to the bumper of a
Dodge Ram squealing down an Arkansas
highway
At frat parties, I was the one standing
outside, sucking down cigarette after ciga
rette. pretending to pretend I didn't recog
nize people for whatever modicum of social
standing that might afford me. While I
scoured the can-littered lawns for someone
anyone! — having a worse time than 1.
my roommate would invariably come up
and sloshedly request my presence in the
acrid.groping clusterfuck known as a dance
floor. At this point. I always suddenly re
membered an impending film essay and im
mediately took off. teetering down May
field in neon pink heels, a cloud of Marlboro

billowing in my wake.
This may not surprise you. but I cannot
dance. I mean. I've tried, but no matter how
many drinks I consume or Ricky Martin
videos I watch on You Tube. 1 just can't do it.
My feet stay planted, my arms flail wildly
and — my god. you mean my pelvis is sup
posed to MOVE? Because it most assured
ly does not.
And that is where my shameful secret
comes in: l or the past several years. 1 have
nursed the cherished ambition that one day
I might find myself at another lame frat
party.sipping my Keystone Light in the cor
ner. when all of a sudden the first notes of
the hot 'Ws jam "Everybody Dance Now"
(ill the air. Instantly I drop my cup and. to
my visible shock, my arms shoot out in time
with the notes. A circle forms around me as
the chorus plays and I. with a look of aston
ishment and delight, execute a carefully


Lewin
■ Out and Aboutski
choreographed series of tlips. twists,
turns and possibly a few break-dance
staples. I drop to a bow as the music
ends, then push through the crowd,
pick up my discarded drink and strut
out the front door, a hero of the
downtrodden and arrhythmic.
I've actually tried to make this
fantasy come true. At a Slav Dom
party last year. I asked the DJ to spin
"Everybody Dance Now" and sur
reptitiously sidled off to a corner,
waiting for my big moment. When
the song finally came on. I beamed,
threw out one arm and — spilled my
drink on the guy standing next to me.
I guess the music wasn't in me after
all.
I revealed this dream scenario for
the first time to my best friend the
other day. with great emotional in
tensity, going into small details, gen
uine tears brimming in my eyes. And
then, to my horror, she laughed at
me. I leveled with her about all those
years of pain, insecurity, wondering
where the cool kids bought their vin
tage blazers, and all she had was
laughter. Then I haughtily replied
that I was doomed to be the sad
clown — laughing on the outside,
but weeping on the inside. And she
laughed at that too, the bitch.
I guess I see her point, though. It
is kind of goofy.
When you get right down to it. I'm
kind of goofy. Most of the thoughts

that constantly occupy my mind are
marginal at best;some are downright
nonsensical. 1 suspect it is not the
ideas themselves that others find hu
morous, but how seriously 1 take
them.
The other day this came to a head
as I set the table for dinner with my
boyfriend. He recalled having trou
ble remembering where the utensils
went as a child; I stared at him in con
fusion.
"But sweetie, it's so obvious. The
knife is holding the spoon hostage
and the fork is coming to rescue
her!"
He scanned my face anxiously for
signs that 1 was joking. Such a sign
