# Do you love me now
## that I can dance?

An admission: What I'm about to
share is a deep personal revelation,
something I carry close to my heart
and have only ever told one person (plus. I
guess, whoever was behind us in line at the
CoHo).
Growing up. I was an awkward, nay. an
ungainly youth, prone to hovering about
the fringes of social mediocrity. This took a
slight turn north in high school when I dis
covered casual disdain and the word "di
alectic." but even the holy demon of sar
casm didn't quite save me from social
scathing. During my first months at Stan

Dodge Ram squealing down an Arkansas
highway
At frat parties, I was the one standing

My feet stay planted, my arms flail wildly
and — my god. you mean my pelvis is sup
posed to MOVE? Because it most assured
ly does not.
And that is where my shameful secret
comes in: l or the past several years. 1 have
nursed the cherished ambition that one day
I might find myself at another lame frat
party.sipping my Keystone Light in the cor

the hot 'Ws jam "Everybody Dance Now"
