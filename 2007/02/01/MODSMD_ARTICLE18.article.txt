German: Wie luenger, desto hesser.
English; /'he longer, the better.
The longer, the better.eh? Some things
are better not to try to hold onto. Per
haps an English idiom can be
scrounged up to demonstrate my viewpoint:
Get going while the going's still good. I've
written this column long enough. It's time
tor me to move on to bigger, better things.
Like passing classes and getting sleep. Al
though we all know I'm probably not going
to do the latter anyway. Regardless.
I've certainly learned a lot over the
course ot the volume, thanks to writing this
column and the wonderful feedback it
elicited from the readership. But before I
get to what i've learned. I will say that writ
ing for The Daily has introduced me to a
number of awesome people, and helped me
see just how many people on campus care
about me. My editor is one of those awe
some people, and she definitely deserves a
round of applause for putting up with my
antics over the course of the volume (of
which I made sure there was no lack). And
my house deserves a huge one. too. for help
ing me pull through some of the tougher
moments of this endeavor, as well as provid
ing material to write about. But that's an
other story — a lot of other stories, in fact,
some of which I've already written about.

But then, meeting awesome people
seems to happen whenever you stick your
neck out into the world, and going through
tough situations inevitably forces you to re
alize just how much people care. It's possi
ble that becoming a heroin junkie would
have had much the same effect — I
would've met a whole new community of
users, and people who knew me previously
would point out that I was being an idiot,
which is the same thing as caring in a lot of
ways.
Hut back to the "what have I learned"
theme. Well. I've learned that the editing
process changes whatever the writer origi
nally wrote a decent amount, sometimes
changes the overall meaning a great deal.
(This is nothing against my editor—be
cause she's awesome. Its just a reflection on
the inevitable result of the process.) Which
