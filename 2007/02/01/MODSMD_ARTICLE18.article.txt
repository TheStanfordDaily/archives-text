# Last words from the chair
## 
### 
German: Wie luenger, desto hesser.
English; /'he longer, the better.
The longer, the better.eh? Some things
are better not to try to hold onto. Per
haps an English idiom can be
scrounged up to demonstrate my viewpoint:
Get going while the going's still good. I've
written this column long enough. It's time
tor me to move on to bigger, better things.
Like passing classes and getting sleep. Al
though we all know I'm probably not going
to do the latter anyway. Regardless.
I've certainly learned a lot over the
course ot the volume, thanks to writing this
column and the wonderful feedback it
elicited from the readership. But before I
get to what i've learned. I will say that writ
ing for The Daily has introduced me to a
number of awesome people, and helped me
see just how many people on campus care
about me. My editor is one of those awe
some people, and she definitely deserves a
round of applause for putting up with my
antics over the course of the volume (of
which I made sure there was no lack). And
my house deserves a huge one. too. for help
ing me pull through some of the tougher
moments of this endeavor, as well as provid
ing material to write about. But that's an
other story — a lot of other stories, in fact,
some of which I've already written about.

But then, meeting awesome people
seems to happen whenever you stick your
neck out into the world, and going through
tough situations inevitably forces you to re
alize just how much people care. It's possi
ble that becoming a heroin junkie would
have had much the same effect — I
would've met a whole new community of
users, and people who knew me previously
would point out that I was being an idiot,
which is the same thing as caring in a lot of
ways.
Hut back to the "what have I learned"
theme. Well. I've learned that the editing
process changes whatever the writer origi
nally wrote a decent amount, sometimes
changes the overall meaning a great deal.
(This is nothing against my editor—be
cause she's awesome. Its just a reflection on
the inevitable result of the process.) Which


Hayes
From the Arm Chair
was kind ot devastating tor me, be
cause I used to believe that if you re
ally wanted to say something, you
could get your voice through be
cause we theoretically don't have
censorship around here. But it's still
really frustrating to go behind the
scenes and see that a dream isn't ac
tually realized.
1 think the biggest thing I
learned, though, was that if people
have a problem with what you say,
they'll do everything except telling
you directly. I recevied precisely one
email about the column, but saw a
large number of personal insults and
complaints posted on Ihe Daily
Web site. (Writers aren't permitted
to post comment on their own arti
cles in response.) Other readers sim
ply sent comments to my editors
without first contacting me.
I'm fine with people publicly ex
pressing intellectual points; every
one deserves to see those. But if
someone just wants to say that I'm a
poor excuse for a writer and should
n't even be allowed to write for a
high school paper — well. I think it
would be in better taste to send that
kind of thing directly to me, rather
than plastering it on a public Web
site where 1 can't defend myself. But
I suppose it takes some amount of
courage to take complaints directly
to the cause of your grief. And it
probably makes people feel more
powerful to slash at someone's rep
utation without fear of retribution.
And, of course, 1 acquired a great
deal of cynicism. But that seems to
happen to everyone whose ideals
don't quite match up with those of
the majority.
