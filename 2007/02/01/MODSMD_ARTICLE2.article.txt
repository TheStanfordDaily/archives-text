## OUTPLAYED IN OVERTIME Gonzaga wins 90-86 in close, 20T contest 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Call it karma. Call it regression to the
mean. Call it what you will, but Stanford
men's basketball finally lost a close one. 90-86,
in a double-overtime nailbiter to Gonzaga.
"Obviously, it's a tough, tough loss, but
that's what happens when you don't defend,
don't rebound at crucial times and don't take
care of the ball," head coach Trent Johnson
said."We definitely didn't in the first half, and
that's pretty much it."
Indeed, No. 23 Stanford (14-6,6-3 Pacifie
-10 Conference) led by 14 in the first half and
by seven with 5:32 to go in the second, but the
team lost its focus both times. The Cardinal
had gotten away with on-and-off effort in nar
row wins against Oregon State and Washing
ton State earlier this month, but its luck ran
out against the pesky Zags (16-7. 6-1 West
Coast Conference) — though not without
drama.
"I know we could have beat them, and 1
knew that when we had our surge at the be

ginning, but that's happened in every loss this
year "said sophomore forward Lawrence Hill
(22 points)."That's not new."
Sophomore guard Anthony Goods awoke
from his worst shooting game of the season —
l-of-8 for just two points through 44 minutes
— to push the Zags to the two extra periods.
Down by three with 17 seconds to go in the
first overtime. Goods dribbled to his right,
crossed over to his left, pulled up and
launched a 33-footer. fading away from the
two taller defenders in his face for a swish.
Goods (16 points) then hit 3-of-5 three
point attempts in double overtime to extend
the game, but an early hole proved too deep
for the Cardinal.
Three straight layups and a free throw
from Gonzaga guards Jeremy Pargo (23
points) and Derek Raivio(2l points) gave the
Zags a 74-67 lead just 90 seconds into the pe
riod. Stanford had no choice but to foul late,
and Gonzaga made 14 of its 17 overtime free
throws to clinch the victory.

the free throw line, including a killer 2-of-6 from senior for
ward Fred Washington. Gonzaga meanwhile finished 28-
of-38 (73 percent), with the team's accuracy steadily im
proving as the game progressed.
"Free throws — we spend as much time on that as on
anything we do," Johnson said. "I'd like to shoot 80 percent
I'd like not to miss them — hut Fm not going to worry
about it."
The Cardinal jumped to a 19-5 lead and Hill scored 14
early points on perfect 6-of-fi shooting. But when Hill
picked up his second foul with eight minutes to go in the
half, Johnson sat him for the rest of the period and Gonza
ga whittled away an 11-point lead to just 32-27 at halftime.
"Our mistakes early on got them back in the game, and
then our inability to make crucial shots hurt." Johnson said.
The visiting Bulldogs came out blazing in the second
half,building a 44-36 lead with 14:30 to go on a 17-4 run. But
Stanford punched right back. The Cardinal started a 14-2
spurt just minutes later to take a 56-49 lead with 5:32 to play.
"This was a new experience for us.coming out off a huge
win and having to see how we came out and competed,"
said Johnson, who stressed that he was pleased with his
team's effort, blown leads notwithstanding. "We competed
our tails off.This is a good group of guys.They come out and
work."
The game was similar to last year's matchup, when Gon
zaga's Adam Morrison scored 12 of his 34 total points in the
final three minutes as the Zagscame from behind to win by
four. 80-76, in Spokane, Wash. Last night, Raivio and Pargo
combined for 19 of Gonzaga's 23 double-overtime points.
"We had a guy have a career game against us, Pargo,"
Johnson said."That's what beat us."
Freshman center Brook Lopez recorded career highs
with 20 points and 12 rebounds, though he was held score
less in both overtimes.
Stanford last went to double overtime when much of
this year's roster was still in the womb, topping UCLA 116-
110 in the 1987-88 season.
