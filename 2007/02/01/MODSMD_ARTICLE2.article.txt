## OUTPLAYED IN OVERTIME Gonzaga wins 90-86 in close, 20T contest 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Call it karma. Call it regression to the
mean. Call it what you will, but Stanford
men's basketball finally lost a close one. 90-86,
in a double-overtime nailbiter to Gonzaga.
"Obviously, it's a tough, tough loss, but
that's what happens when you don't defend,
don't rebound at crucial times and don't take
care of the ball," head coach Trent Johnson
said."We definitely didn't in the first half, and
that's pretty much it."
Indeed, No. 23 Stanford (14-6,6-3 Pacifie
-10 Conference) led by 14 in the first half and
by seven with 5:32 to go in the second, but the
team lost its focus both times. The Cardinal
had gotten away with on-and-off effort in nar
row wins against Oregon State and Washing
ton State earlier this month, but its luck ran
out against the pesky Zags (16-7. 6-1 West
Coast Conference) — though not without
drama.
"I know we could have beat them, and 1
knew that when we had our surge at the be

ginning, but that's happened in every loss this
year "said sophomore forward Lawrence Hill
(22 points)."That's not new."
Sophomore guard Anthony Goods awoke
from his worst shooting game of the season —
l-of-8 for just two points through 44 minutes
— to push the Zags to the two extra periods.
Down by three with 17 seconds to go in the
first overtime. Goods dribbled to his right,
crossed over to his left, pulled up and
launched a 33-footer. fading away from the
two taller defenders in his face for a swish.
Goods (16 points) then hit 3-of-5 three
point attempts in double overtime to extend
the game, but an early hole proved too deep
for the Cardinal.
Three straight layups and a free throw
from Gonzaga guards Jeremy Pargo (23
points) and Derek Raivio(2l points) gave the
Zags a 74-67 lead just 90 seconds into the pe
riod. Stanford had no choice but to foul late,
and Gonzaga made 14 of its 17 overtime free
throws to clinch the victory.
