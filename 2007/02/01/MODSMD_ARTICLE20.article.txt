# Commencement 2007: Sponsored by the GOP and Philip Morris
## 
### 
At last count, the number of online re
sponses to the front-page Daily arti
cle announcing Dana Gioia as the
Commencement ("Dark horse chosen for
commencement," Jan. 30) speaker was 47.
The majority of these responses, unsurpris
ingly. have been negative. The Class of 2007
feels that once again, they have been
screwed.
But wait! A few online posts remind us
that the most famous speakers are not always
the most insightful speakers. Others note that
Commencement speakers always say the
same thing anyway, so who cares? A com
ment or two even accuses the Class of 2007 of
elitism for caring so much about the celebri
ty of the Commencement speaker.
But missing from this debate is an under
standing of who exactly this man is and what
he does.
Dana Gioia grew up in California and
made his way north from Hawthorne Stan
fold. I le cared about literature and about po
etry. hut decided to make a living by entering
the business world. According to the article,
Senior Class President Vivek Agrawal noted
that Gioia's "background in both business
and art would allow him to share a unique
perspective with graduating students."
So what is this "business" background that
makes Gioia such a swell person all around?
Gioia was vice-president of marketing for
General Food Corporation from 1 ( )77 to
IW2. General Foods was acquired by Philip
Morris Companies, the cigarette manufac

turer. in 1985. Iliis means that Gioia was
working to put money in Philip Morris' pock
ets for about seven years. I'm hoping Gioia
will avoid discussing business ethics in his
Com m e nee me nt add re ss.
And what about his background in the
arts? Gioia is an accomplished essayist and
poet — a winner of the American Book
Award. Accordingly, his literary peers seem
to think highly of him. Prominent poet
Lawrence Ferlinghetti praised Gioia for his
current occupation as President Bush's ap
pointed chairman of the National Endow
ment for the Arts, commenting that. "The
[National Endowment for the Arts], with its
implicit censorship by Congress, really
should be called the National Endowment
for the Arts of Complacency. As such, I think
Dana Gioia is an excellent choice for the
job." Ferlinghetti explained further that,
"Any poet or creative person who works for
a government that has had such murderous
policies as we have now in the Third World is
really compromising his position as a poet
and as a free thinker." United States Poet

Laureate Donald Hall seems to agree, not
ing, "Dana Gioia is full of shit."
Is Ferlinghetti justified in painting Gioia
as an accomplice to the misdeeds of the Bush
administration? Bush appointed Gioia, hut
does that make him responsible for current
foreign policy? If we examine his voting
record, the answer is a resounding "YES.'"
Gioia is a registered Republican, having
voted for both Bush senior and his bumbling
progeny.
Although I'm not terribly familiar with
Gioia's work. 1 have acquainted myself with
the ways in which his particular artistic per
spective filters into the programming of the
National Endowment forthe Arts. His obses
sion with a rigid formalism shows through in
his "Shakespeare in American Communi
ties program, which sponsors touring
Shakespeare troupes. The funding of opera
companies to tour military bases reveals his
inclination toward Art with a capital "A."
Don t get me wrong — 1 enjoy the occasion
al opera or performance of Shakespeare, but
it seems that Gioia is presenting us with an
extremely classist answer to the question of
"What is art?" 1 can only imagine "uncul
tured" youth scratching their heads at son
nets written in Early Middle English (god
knows 1 do) and military troops wondering
why someone had decided that a high
pitched aria was exactly what was needed to
boost morale.
