## Imperial queerness and Israeli propaganda 
### JERRY ZEE 
On Wednesday night, a number of groups
including the off-campus organization
pro-Israel advocacy group StandWithUs
screened a 15-minute film entitled "Out of
the Closet and into the Streets of Tel Aviv."
Ibis is neither a documentary (it was pro
duced by a PR firm in Israel), nor does it seek
to generate critical discussion. Among the re
cent surge ot discussion surrounding Israel,
the event was advertised as a "great docu
mentary about the open lifestyle of lesbians
and gays in Israel," but the movie itself is bla
tantly a propaganda piece that is simultane
ously distasteful in the way it represents an
amorphous and culturally backward Middle
East, offensive in the way that it explicitly
characterizes Islam and disgusting in the way
that it appropriates the rhetoric of the queer
movement.
Ibe film, subtitled "A Peek at Freedom
and Acceptance in the Middle East," opens
with images of presumably Muslim people
performing ritual ablutions and praying. An
announcer informs the audience that democ

racy and human rights have only recently ar
rived in the Middle East and, to the sound
track of the Islamic call to prayer, goes on to
inform us that the lives of LGBT people are
difficult throughout the Middle East. How
ever, we are told, in contrast to all the repres
sion of the Middle East."lsrael is an oasis of
gay and lesbian freedom" as the shape of Is
rael is highlighted, propaganda style, on a
map of the Middle East. Israel is represented
as a gay Utopia, where no one lives in fear of
homophobia, where gay life is open and free,
where anyone can be themselves â€” even gay
Palestinians (provided they carry their iden
tification cards).
I would like to point out that the rheto
ric of queer rights is being appropriated
and used instrumentally by the producers
and screeners of this film in a way that jus
tifies violence, occupation and oppression.
Queer Israel is presented as liberated and
modern, in explicit contrast to the sup
posed barbarism of the Middle East. The
doctrine of the queer movement that
stresses freedom and openness is being
used to justify Israel's claims to statehood

while at the same time demonizing the
Arab other as backward.
I am not claiming that perhaps condi
tions tor queer people are not better in Is
rael than they are elsewhere. I am arguing
that the way queer rights is being appropri
ated is disgusting and goes in complete op
position to the ideals of the queer move
ment. Israel's portrayal of itself as queer
friendly is contrasted with a vague Middle
Eastern barbaric other, so this film is not
about queer rights in Israel,but rather about
the demonization of the Middle East. What
this amounts to is using queer rights to at
tack the Middle East through language in
order to justify the physical violence that the
Israeli state commits.
As a member of the queer community. I
am angry at the use of our liberatory rhetoric
to justify exactly the opposite of liberation. I
hope, from now on. that the line between ed
ucation and propaganda will not be so
shamelessly flouted for politicized ends.
