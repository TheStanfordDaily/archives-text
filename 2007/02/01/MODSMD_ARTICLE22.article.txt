## To the Class of 2007: Have some civility 
### 
I recognize that for those expect
ing political celebrities like Bill Clin
ton or Condoleezza Rice for our
Commencement speaker, the rela
tively unknown Dana Gioia seems
like a second-rate compromise. But
to express your disappointment with
the Senior Presidents' selection in
such a public fashion demonstrates
extreme disrespect for an invited
guest of the University and of our
class.
The truth is that Dana Gioia is
an accomplished individual with
an interesting life story and signif
icant accomplishments. As some
one who shares his status as a first

generation college student. I'm in
spired by his example and hope
that he can remind us all of the in
credible opportunity this institu
tion has offered us. Further, I ex
pect that he has much to teach
every student, but especially those
future 1-Bankers and consultants,
about the importance of balance
between the material pursuits of
business and the altruism of the
arts. If any student says they are
above these lessons, then I suggest
they write their own Commence
ment address for our edification.
Some critics have suggested
that Ciioia's invitation is a sign that
the Administration (including, I
presume, our elected presidents)
doesn't care about students, and

that he fails to illustrate the values
of "justice, peace, entrepreneur
ship." In addition to the unfair na
ture of this carping, their critiques
ring hollow when you reflect on
the purpose of Commencement â€”
an opportunity to glean words of
advice at the onset of a new begin
ning. By his personal and profes
sional achievements, Mr. Gioia is
fully qualified for this task, and in
the future all criticism should be
directed not at an invited guest,
but to those responsible for his in
vitation.
In the meantime, please show
some respect.
