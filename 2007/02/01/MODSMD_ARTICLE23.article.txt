## Israel and you 
### DAVID COHEN 
What is Israel? With all the argu
ments and rhetoric we've heard over
the last week, it's easy to forget that
Israel is a country, not just a contro
versial subject. The fact is. every sin
gle Stanford student's life has been
vastly improved by Israeli innova
tions and advances in science and
technology
Israel has made your life better,
and not just by producing Natalie
Portman.
Don't believe me .' I et's try a little
thought experiment. Imagine what
life would be like without Israel's
contributions. What il you had to
avoid all technology developed in Is
rael, ignore all Israeli scientific ad
vances and otherwise pretend that
Israel never existed. ("oilld you do it?
For starters, you could not use
any cell phones. Ihe cell phone
was developed bv Motorola's Is
raeli R&D team. But who needs to
talk to people anyway? While
we're on the subject, the interna
tionally popular ICO instant mes
saging platform was developed in
Israel by a company called
Mirabilis before being sold to
AOL. In addition to popularizing
instant messaging, Mirabilis also
pioneered the large-scale peer to
peer network architecture later
used by companies such ;iv Nap
ster and Kazaa.
Forget emailing and doing work
on your laptop, since Intel's Israeli
R&D team designed the Pentium
M/Centrino and the dual core
processor. If you're using a laptop
with an Intel processor, the stieker on
it should probably say "Israel In
side." For those of you with oldei
Macs (before Mac√üooks came out),
your processors were made by IBM.
Any guesses on which small Middle
Fastem country holds IBM's largest
R&D facilities outside the United
States?
It's not just laptop users that
would be affected, however. Most of
Windows NT was developed by Mi
crosoft's Israel R&D team. And the
popular Windows XP operating sys
tem is built on top of N I So have fun
writing your term papers in I inux.
In fact, il you're missing out on
Israel, you're missing out on a lot.
Israel is home to the largest eon
centration of technology compa
nies outside the U.S. I here are
about 35.000 hi-tech companies in
Israel, which has a population of
about seven million people. Ameri
ca is the only country with more
companies listed on the NASDAO
than Israel. That tiny country
(about the size of New Jersey) also
has more biotech start-ups per
capita than any other nation.
Among the things you'd be missing
out on are the M2A camera in a
pill that has tremendous medical
and scientific applications, the Fx
Press shunt for glaucoma patients
and the first once a-das pill for

Parkinson's disease. Of special in
terest to women, Israel's Savyon
Diagnostics recently created the
first over-the-counter test for yeast
infections. For those afraid of nee
dles. an Israeli company called
Iranspharma just created the first
medicated patch for osteoperosis.
Then theie's Heal Or. which is rev
olutionizing care for diabetic ul
eeis. And don't forget Optimata,
which developed a Virtual Cancer
Patient Fngine that is state-of-the
art in predicting how breast cancer
patients will respond to
chemotherapy The list goes on.
Avoiding Israeli advances would
also mean avoiding a significant
portion of the world's academia.
That's because Israel has more uni
vei sity degrees per capita, more sci
entists per capita and more scientif
ic papers per capita than any other
nation in the world. Israeli contribu
tions include a method of using light
to kill cancer cells, the discovery of a
non-genetic code in I)NA which
sets the placement of nucleosomes
and ;i breath based liver test that
will reduce the need for biopsies. Is
raeli researchers have found a new
gene that will permit agriculture in
ultra saline environments. An Is
raeli doctor led the Merck team that
recently developed a vaccine
against cervical cancer. And again,
the list goes on.
Closer to home, participants in
this experiment will have to choose
llieii classes and research opportuni
ties earefully I've noticed that my de
partment. computer science, is lit
tered with Israelis; I've already had
three Israeli professors, including
Mac Arthur (ienius Grant winner
Daphne kollei (and 110. 1 don't pick
my classes based on the nationality
of the professor). Israeli CS profs
woi k in cutting edge fields such as ar
tificial intelligence and network se
em it v I might add. this trend goes be
yond 111st the professors. There are
five I lebrew speakers in my research
group alone.
In ease you were wondering,com
putet science is not unique in this re
gard. Brilliant Israeli professors are
all ovei the I'"arm, but don't take my
woid for it. Ask a certified genius,
like Mac Arthur winner Avner Greif
m the economics department.
II you really had to avoid every
thing Israeli, you'd probably have to
go live 111 the woods. As you sit here,
reading this column. Israeli re
searchers and entrepreneurs are
continuing with their steady stream
of contributions. So let's put this
thought experiment to rest, but do
me one little favor.'Hie next time you
hear the word "Israel." say "inside."
In the words of Weird Al: It's all
about the Pentiums.
