# STUDENT GROUPS
## Jewish groups, LGBT screen documentary 
### LAURA RUMPF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students who gathered in Pigott
Hall last night for the screening of
the 2(M)4 documentary "Out of the
Closet and into the Streets of Tel
Aviv" saw a side of Israel rarely por
trayed by the U.S. media.
ITie film, produced by Blue Star
PR in collaboration with Israel's two
largest Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
Transgender (LGBT) organizations
the Agudah and Jerusalem Open
House — featured members of the
gay community in Tel Aviv dis
cussing Israel's unique tolerance of
homosexuality, especially in the mil
itary.
"Tel Aviv is like the gay city to be
in all the Middle East — it's an
amazing place," remarked one Is
raeli man interviewed in the docu
mentary.
The film reported that
Jerusalem Open House, one of the
grassroots organizations that spon
sored the film, also helps Palestin
ian homosexuals estranged by their
own community to embrace their
sexuality.
Mishan Araujo "07, president of
the Stanford Israel Alliance (SIA),
collaborated with members of the

lewish Student Association, LGBT-
Community Academic Support and
Advising. Stanford Jewish Queers
and StandWithUs to show the film.
"1 originally heard of the docu
mentary from the Israel Center in
San Francisco, a group that serves Is
raelis in the Bay Area and works
closely with the Stanford Israel Al
liance." she said. "1 thought now
would be a great time to organize
the event, since Israel just legalized
gay marriage and the first gay couple
was recently married there."
Araujo expressed concern that
Stanford students are bombarded
with a singularly negative impres
sion of Israel, especially with the Is
raeli/Palestinian conflict receiving
considerable attention on campus
recently.
"When students think about Is
rael they think about war,controver
sy and the desert, when there are so
many positive things going on in Is
rael." she said. "LGBT rights is just
one of these things."
Dan Zeehandelaar '07, co-presi
dent of Stanford Jewish Queers,
agreed to work with SI A partially as
a reaction to the recent publicity
given to the Israel/Palestine conflict
on campus, hut also because his
group had a specific interest in the

issue at hand.
"In addition to having a commu
nity for Jewish queers, we want to
have a space for a dialogue about
people who share those identities,"
he said.
The Stanford Jewish Queers plan
to further the dialogue addressed by

the documentary by inviting Avner
Even-Zohar, the openly gay former
Captain of the Israeli Defense
Forces, to campus in hopes that he
will discuss the contrasting positions
of Israel and the United States on
gays in the military.
"The fact that Israel allows open

ly gay people to serve in the mili
tary." Araujo said, "is an interesting
discussion that could inspire us to
sec that in the [U.S.] military. LGBT
rights coulc work."
