## GSC remembers Zhou Council also discusses tax relief, grad. life survey 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Before attending to their regular business,
the Graduate Student Council (GSC) remem
bered recently deceased doctoral student
Mengyao "May" Zhao at their meeting last
night, inviting one of her friends to speak to the
members and having a moment of silence in her
memory.
Fernando Gomez, an electrical engineering
graduate student and a friend of Zhou's, told the
GSC that he is working with others to establish
a fellowship in Zhou's memory. The group aims
to raise $1 million for the award, he said —
though he admitted that their goals may be
come somewhat less ambitious if they are not
successful.
"There should be more people like her. not
less," Gomez said, the tears welling in his eyes as
he addressed the solemn GSC members."That's
why we should remember her in a big way."
He also mentioned that Zhou's friends and
family have decided to hold a small, private me
morial service for her and warned that her death
should not be manipulated for "political rea
sons."
After Gomez's remarks, GSC co-Chair (and
Daily Senior Staff Writer) Jenny Allen J.D. "07
called for a moment of silence for Zhou, before
the GSC moved to its prepared agenda.
Rebecca Kaplan MBA '07. who is in charge
of the upcoming Graduate Life Survey, present
ed a budget for the survey, which takes half an
hour to complete. Other members quickly
chimed in, saying that more incentive was need-

Ed than the one iPod Video and the eight gift
certificates that Kaplan had included in the
plan.
"We need to sweeten the deal." said GSC
member George Bloom, a comparative litera
ture graduate student. He suggested that there
be more "big" prizes.
After some discussion,the council decided to
allocate $100 to the prizes for every 100 respon
dents. with the exact prizes still to be deter
mined. bringing the total cost of the survey to a
maximum of about $2,800.
The council also listened to a presentation
from representative Dirk Englund, an applied
physics graduate student who will be one of two
members visiting Washington to lobby on be
half of the GSC. They will focus their efforts on
tax relief for graduate students, whose stipends
have been taxed since a 1986 tax code overhaul
under former President Ronald Reagan, and on
"making life for international students easier."
Some members asked Englund why the GSC
lobbyists were not participating in a larger lob
bying campaign organized by the National As
sociation of Graduate and Professional Stu
dents (NAGPS) in two weeks. Instead. Englund
and GSB student Maxim Afanasyev. the other
GSC member accompanying Englund, decided
to conduct their lobbying later.
In other business, the GSC approved funding
for five student groups, including an additional
$800 for the International Gala to meet higher
than expected venue costs.They had already ap
proved $2,000 for the Gala earlier this year,
after increasing their budget for the Gala from
last year.
GSC members also watched a presentation
from Capital Group on the new online banking
system for Stanford student groups.
