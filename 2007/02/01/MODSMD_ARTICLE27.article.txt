(ITA) National Team Indoors in Madison.
Wis. today.

NO. 17 VANDERBILT (ITA NATIONAL
TEAM INDOORS)
Madison, Wis.
9:00 A.M PT

Stanford, the No. 1 seed in the tournament,
is set to face off against No. 17 Vanderhilt (2-
2) in the first round at 9 a.m. The Com
modores lost two games last weekend. Their
No. 1 singles player, Amanda Fish, is expected
to sit the tournament out due to an ankle in
jury. Meanwhile, freshman Catherine New
man has stepped up for Vanderhilt; ranked at
No. 24. she is now 3-0 in singles competition
this year.
TTie ITATeam Indoors consists of 16 of the
nation's top teams. Some of the tough compe
tition that the Cardinal expects to see include
No. 4 Notre Dame, No. 5 Miami (Fla.), No. 6
Georgia Tech, No. 8 Northwestern and No. 11
California.
The tournament is invite-only and the top
16 teams in the country are given invitation.
But, as senior Theresa Logar explained, only
around 10 of them actually attend.
"It's always a really good tournament."
Logar said. "It's kind of a neutralizer for a lot
of teams. It's great for us to go over there and
see how we can play indoors."
Stanford (1-0) has also won a record nine
of the 19 ITA National Team Indoors titles.
"It's definitely a tough tournament and a
real good test." Logar said on the general cal
iber of the tournament.
The I TA Team Indoors serves as a good
measuring stick for teams in the early dual
season. It is the only major dual tournament
of the season until the NCAA Champi
onships at the end of the year, and it is one of
the few chances for the Cardinal to see strong
team competition from outside the West
Coast. The Team Indoors should also serve as
good practice for more important events to
come;the tournament,like the NCAA Cham
pionship. is a single elimination tournament.
"It's the first thing that legitimizes the
rankings on a national level," freshman Lind
say Burdette said. "It we lose in indoors,
we're probably going to drop."
Stanford's main advantage, as opposed to
many of the other nationally ranked teams, is
its depth. There is very little drop-off. if any,
between the number one and six players in
the lineup. Unlike other schools which boast
one or two superstar-quality players, the Car
dinal's top eight are all solid and formidable.
The indoor surface will provide a contrast
for the Cardinal, which is used to playing on
an outdoor court. The adjustment should not

prove too difficult, though: Logar. one of the
team's main contributors, grew up playing on
indoor courts.
"I think that the indoor courts really cater
well to our team," she said. "Four of our six
starters pound the ball and are really hard

hitters.That is such an advantage [when play
ing indoors). It's a pretty easy transition for
all of us â€” it works to our advantage."
After the Indoors, Stanford will face
Sacramento State next Thursday. 'Ihe contest
should be good preparation for the two cru

cial matches that the Cardinal have on l eh.
15 and Ih against opposing Pacific-10 Con
ference powerhouses. No. 2 Southern Cali
fornia and No. 14 UCLA.
