### MANEESHA LIMAYE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the first venture of its kind.
Stanford I lospital & Clinics began
renovation on a comprehensive out
patient center in Redwood City ear
lier this week. ITiis is the first time in
its history that the hospital will pro
vide off-site care.
The center, which is scheduled to
open at the end of 2008. will include
Orthopaedics, Sports Medicine. Der
matology and Pain Management
centers. In addition, the new facility
will house one of the largest imaging
centers in Northern California and
the largest sleep study center on the
West Coast.
According to Norman W. Ri/.k.
professor of medicine and senior as
sociate dean for clinical affairs, the
center will provide numerous bene
fits for the community.
"It will essentially double our out
patient space and. in addition, place

us closer to our patients in the com
munities north of us." he said.
Located at the former headquar
ters of HxciteC" Home, a broadband
Internet access provider that filed for
bankruptcy in 2001. the site features
four office buildings totaling approx
imately 360,000 square feet. Stanford
Hospital & Clinics will initially use
260.000 square feet for the project.
Larry Carr, director of govern
ment relations at Stanford Hospital
& Clinics, added that in addition to
its visibility from the US-101 freeway
and its proximity to the Stanford
campus, the location was chosen
based on patient needs.
"In looking at the demographic of
the peninsula in our service areas, we
saw an increase in the need for health
care services." he said. "This area is
aging; there is no population growth
and the people that are there now
will need more medical services."
While proponents are happy to
increase the number of health care
services in the area, it is the potential
to improve the way in which these
services are offered that truly excites
the medical community.
It is an opportunity to reinvent

from whole cloth the way we practice
and how we integrate medical infor
mation systems," Rizk said. "It will
allow us to refocus on the patient ex
perience in designing the interior of
the buildings. It is a fantastic oppor
tunity to become more effective, de
velop better outcomes and provide
great service."
Carr said that creating a positive
patient experience is a top priority.
"It's a great and unique opportu
nity to design such a center with a pa
tient-centric mind." he said. "We
think about how to make them as
comfortable as possible, how easy is
it for them to make an appointment
and how to make it as accessible as
we can. If any other services are
needed, they are right there. You
don't have to drive around."
The directors' hope is that the cen
ter will serve as a place where pa
tients receive not only numerous
services, but also better treatment
and care.
"It will make for a much better
medical experience." Carr said.
