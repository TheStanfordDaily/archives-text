ABOUT DC SANTA BARBARA: UGSantc
Barbara (11-9, 5-2 Big West) is
streaking as of late and figures to be
one of the top contenders in a wide
open conference race. The Gau
chos, who have traditionally been the
class of the Big West, qualified for
the WNIT last year while finishing
16 14 overall. UC Santa Barbara
enters the week having won seven of
its last eight overall. The Gauchos
average 67.8 points and 37.5 re
bounds per game, in addition to
shooting 41.2-percent from the field
and 33.8-percent from three-point
territory.

Having come off an overtime
win against its top Pacific-10 Con
ference competition, Arizona
Suite, the No. 8 Stanford women's
basketball team now heads out
side of the conference to UC-
Santa Barbara.Tonight's time out
should give the Cardinal an at
tainable win before it returns
home to face the Pac-l()'s third
ranked No. 21 California.
Tlie Gauchos (11-9, 5-2 Big
West) had a rough start to the sea
son.going 1-5, but have won seven
of their last eight games. Tonight,
however, their roll should turn for
the worse against Stanford (18-3,
11-0 Pac-10), looking for its 17th
straight win.
Averaging 67.8 points per
game and 41.2 percent shooting
from the field, UC-Santa Barbara
will have to contend with a Cardi
nal team that has limited its past
16 opponents to just 55.6 points
per game and 33.6 percent shoot
ing from the field.
The Gauchos will be looking
for the strongest efforts yet from
juniors Jcnna Green (15.5 points
per game,7.s rebounds per game),
Jessica Wilson (13.4 points per
game) and Chisa Ononiwu (13.3
points per game, 50 percent three
point shooting). All three were
around last season for Stanford's
lopsided 81-47 win.
The Cardinal's tougher com
petition will be waiting at Maples
Pavilion this Saturday. A consis

tent top-25 team, the Golden
Bears (16-5, 7-4) v/ill be looking
for a rematch in their favor. They
suffered a disappointing 69-44
loss back at I laas Pavilion in early
January.
"We know that with a team we
play the second time, especially
after winning the first time, it's
going to be a tough game." head
coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"We're working very hard to get

Tlie Gauchos (11-9, 5-2 Big
West) had a rough start to the sea
son.going 1-5, but have won seven

ready for it."

won five of its six games, with the
only loss coming to then-No. 10

back-to-back losses and are
shooting 46.8 percent from the
field, while holding opponents to
36.8 percent from the field.

with a lot of confidence," Van-
Derveer said."'They're a very tal
ented team, and a very well
coached team, so we know we
have to play well."

though: sophomore guard and
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
