# Getting Back in Her Game
## After 30-point ASU game, Wiggins appears back in top form 
### SCOTT BLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When centers Brooke Smith and Jayne Appel both
fouled out late in a tightly-played second half against No.
12 Arizona State (19-3, 9-2 Pacific-10 Conference) last
weekend, no one could blame Cardinal fans for getting a
little jumpy.
Enter Candice Wiggins. Faced with a two-point deficit
and just 1:09 left on the clock, the junior guard sank one
of her patented pull-up jumpers to tie the game at 59. That
was just a teaser for the clinic she proceeded to put on in
overtime.
Wiggins hit a few more jump shots and sank each of
the six foul shots she drew to reach 30 points and drive
No. 8 Stanford's (18-3, 7-3) 16th straight victory. Junior
guard C issy Pierce scored the only other field goal in OT,
and Wiggins was partly responsible for that, too: By that
point the Sun Devils' defenders had been keying on Wig
gins so heavily that Pierce had a wide-open lane to the
basket.
The performance should come as no surprise to any
one who follows Stanford women's basketball, even
though Wiggins has been hindered by injuries this season.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer said that her star is just
starting to get back to full strength.
"I think that was the Candice we've seen for two years
at Stanford." VanDerveer said of Wiggins's performance
against Arizona State. "I can't say that we've really seen
that [this year] to the degree that we saw it last weekend."
A tweak to Wiggins' hamstring and a sprained right
ankle recently conspired to keep Wiggins out of a few
games and out of form in a few more. For the first part of
January, her first step and mobility were not at the light
ning-quick level that Stanford has become accustomed to
seeing, and Wiggins's rhythm and shooting suffered as
weH.
Things are finally starting to look more promising.
"I'm at about 95 percent right now," Wiggins said.
Despite the difficult circumstances, the junior has re
mained an integral part of the women's offense. Wiggins
leads the team in scoring again this year, and her 17.5
points per conference game is good for third in the Pac
-10.
But more than in the last two years, the pure points
numbers, though impressive, do not tell the entire story.
Wiggins leads the Cardinal in a different way this year.
Two factors combined this season to forge an altered
role for the two-time Pac-10 Player of the Year. First,
Stanford's three primary post players — seniors Smith
and Kristen Newlin and freshman Appel — are collec
tively scoring more than 34 points per game. In addition,
the team lost one of its best three-point shooters, Krista
Rappahahn. to graduation.
In order to accommodate the first factor and offset the
second. Wiggins has taken on the responsibility of feeding
the centers and serving as the Cardinal's chief perimeter
shooter. She is averaging more assists per game than last
year and leads the Pac-10 in three-pointers per confer
ence game (3.0). Without Wiggins deflecting defensive at
tention and dishing them the ball, it is hard to imagine
that each one of Stanford's post trio would be shooting
over 50 percent from the field.
Another player might chafe at not scoring 20 points
per game again (she averaged 21.8 last season), but Wig
gins relishes having a host of big-time scorers in the paint.
"Our style is getting the ball inside." Wiggins said. "So
do I want to take it in — or just lob it to Jayne or Brooke."
And if teams adjust to try to shut down Wiggins as a
three-point threat, it is not as though she has forfeited the
right to just drive past them.
"[Arizona State] was guarding tight, so it was very easy
to put the ball on the floor," Wiggins said. "I thought to
myself that this is a time where I can attack."
All of this should serve as troubling news for the Car
dinal's rivals from now through the NCAA tournament.
A team can only defend so much and. for opponents, Wig
gins has pushed the Stanford squad to a level almost un
manageable.
