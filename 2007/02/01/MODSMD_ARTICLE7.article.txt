against Kansas on Dec. 10.
Since then. Cal has been read
justing. Head coach Joanne Boyle
believes her team has risen to the
challenge.
"[Our team is] really good at
being in the moment, and I feel that
we've got just enough to get by, and
they all believe in what we can do
with that," Boyle said.
VanDerveer agreed, taking note
of the perimeter players and others
who have stepped up for Cal.
"The loss of Alexis Gray-Lawson
was tough early on, but now they're
used to it," VanDerveer said.

"[Our team is]
really good at
being in the mo
ment, and I feel
that we've got

get by..."

JOANNE BOYLE, Cal
women's head coach

Boyle added that the team will be
looking toward its guards to step up
both offensively and defensively.
More players will need to contribute
as the Bears already have enough
power in the post.
"Cal has similar strengths to ours
in terms of their post players," Van-
Derveer said. "Devanei Hampton
and Ashley Walker are both having
great sophomore years."
Walker leads the Bears in scoring
(17.8 poi nts per game) and rebound
ing (8.7 rebounds per game — the
best in the Pac-10). Hampton is sec
ond in both stats (14.2 points and 6.8
rebounds per game). Together, they
have made up for Gray-Lawson's
missing presence.
Stanford, on the other hand, has
its own returning presence — that
of junior guard Candice Wiggins.
Wiggins had a season-high 30 points
against the Sun Devils this past
weekend. 10 of them in overtime for
the win.
Wigginsm, who was out due to in
juries just a few weeks ago, has re
covered. VanDerveer said that
though Wiggins' hamstring is now
good, her ankle remains tender.
VanDerveer did add that Wiggins "is
getting there."
With Wiggins revamping, the rest
of the Cardinal is "getting there" as
well,climbing the ranks back toward
its No. 4 preseason slot. Two wins at
Maples Pavilion — tonight at 7 p.m.
and Saturday at 1 p.m. — will help
in the run toward the NCAA tour
nament.
