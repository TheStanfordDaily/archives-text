# PAGE TWO
## Turning the page 
### 
Meticulous readers might have
been confused by the "Page
Two" on the heading above. Well,
we'd like to welcome you to Page
Two anyway — even if, due to
Cardinal Today, at present we find
ourselves on half of page three.
With the beginning of Volume
231, we're proud to introduce a
new section of The Daily. Page Two
will run Tuesday through Friday
(Monday will be home to Intermis
sion's Monday Mayhem) and will,
we hope, be the place to turn to
when you're looking to get a quick
read on the Stanford scene.
Some of the things Page Two
will feature consistently through
out the volume:
• A thorough calendar of events on
campus
• Associated Press news briefs
from around the state, the nation
and the world
• A "Day in the Life" of Stanford
history
• Features and statistics on campus
trends and aspects of Cardinal life
and culture

• "Faces on the Farm" — inter
views with Stanford students
• Q&As and profiles highlighting
some of our amazing faculty
• Articles and columns on science,
technology and innovation
• A "Quote of the Week" from The
Daily and a weekly "Who's up /
who's down" compilation
We're really excited for this vol
ume, and would love to hear your
input for our new section. Have an
event you think should he included?
Just email the information to calen
dar@daily.stanford.edu. Know of an
interesting student or professor to
profile? A student group or campus
trend worthy of notice? A suggestion
for who's "up" and who's "down"?
Email your ideas and any comments
to us at ktfong@stanford.edu and sb
hagwat@stanford.edu.
We'll see you on Page Two to
morrow!
Love,
