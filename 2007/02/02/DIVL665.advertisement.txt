games in a season back from a club that
finished 33-27 overall last year and
reached an NCAA Super Regional. Cal
State Fullerton has just four returning posi
tion player starters and one starting pitch
er back from a 2006 club that was 50-15
overall while finishing tied for third at the
College World Series after winning Big
West, NCAA Regional and NCAA Super
Regional crowns.
