## General who led Iraq war takes criticism from McCain 
### ANNE FLAHERTY ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHING I ON (AP) — The Army general who led the
Iraq war for 2 1 12 years came under tire Thursday from a
leading supporter ol President Bush's new strategy in Iraq
as two other influential senators sought to gain GOP sup
port lor a compromise resolution against Bush's troop
buildup.
Sen. John McC ain. R-Ariz.,criticized Gen. George Casey
tor what he called misjudgments about the prospects for
progress toward stabilizing Iraq during his tenure in Bagh
dad. McCain said he has "strong reservations" about Casey's
nomination to become the next Army chief of staff.
"While I don't in any way question your honor, your pa
triotism or your service to our country, I do question some
of the decisions, the judgments you've made over the past
two and a half years," McCain said. "During that time things
have gotten markedly and progressively worse."
Ibe proposed Senate resolution is likely to pose a threat
to the White House because of its potential appeal to Re
publicans who have grown tired of the nearly four-year war
and want a chance to express their concerns. The White
I louse has been hoping to avoid an overwhelming congres
sional vote criticizing Bush's handling of the war.
In his opening statement to the Senate Armed Services
C ommittee.C asey defended his record as the top command
er in Iraq, saying he remained true to his original commit
ment to request the number of troops he thought he needed
to accomplish his mission.
Casey also spoke optimistically of the situation in Iraq.
"The struggle in Iraq is winnable," Casey said, but will
take patience and will.
After asserting last week that "I'm the decision-maker"
about troop levels in Iraq, Bush acknowledged that Con
gress has the power to cap force levels and put conditions on
where soldiers are deployed.
" ITiey can say. 'We won't fund,"" he told 71ie Wall Street
Journal. "That is a constitutional authority of Congress...
They have the right to try to use the power of the purse to
determine policy.' As for Congress hav ing a voice on where
troops go. Bush said. "They put conditions on funds all the
time."
