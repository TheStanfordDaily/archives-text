PARIS (AP) — The world's loading climate scientists, in
their most powerful language ever used on the issue, said
global warming is "very likely" man-made, according to a
new report obtained Friday by Tho Associated Press.
rhe report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli
mate Change — a group of hundreds of scientists and repre
sentatives of 1 13 governments — represents the most au
thoritative science on tho issue. It was due for official release
on Friday morning in Paris.
"The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere
and ocean, together with ice-mass loss, support tho conclu
sion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change
of the past 50 years can bo explained without external forc
ing, and very likely that is not duo to known natural causes
alone," said the 20-page report.
The phrase "very likely" translates to a more than 90 per
cent certainty that global warming is caused by man.
What that means in layman's language is "wo have this
nailed, said top U.S. climate scientist Jerry Mahlman, who
originated the percentage system.
It marked an escalation from the panel's last report in
2001, which said warming was "likely" caused by human ac
tivity. There had been speculation that the participants
might try to up the ante to "virtually certain" man causes
global warming, which translates to 99 percent chance.
