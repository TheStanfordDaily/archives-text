## Sophomore heads up group for students with disabilities Two-sport high school star works to improve disability resources, access 
### HEATHER HEISTAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Joe Kay never expected to begin his Stanford career
as a student with disabilities. The highly-touted Stan
ford volleyball recruit had lettered in volleyball and
basketball in high school and had earned awards for his
saxophone skills. But immediately after his final high
school basketball game. Kay was crushed and trampled
by fans who stormed the court in celebration. Kay, the
team's star, was left without the use of his right arm and
had great difficulty using his right leg.
Kay — a sophomore who is also a sports writer for
The Daily — was supposed to enter Stanford as a mem
ber of the Class of 2008 but was forced to delay his en
rollment by a year due to his injuries.
Sensing a disconnect between Stanford community
members with disabilities and their peers. Kay decided
to start a disability advocacy group last quarter.
"The goal is to be able to connect members in the
Stanford community with disabilities so they can learn
about and support each other," said Law Prof. Bill
Abrams. the group's faculty advisor.
Group member Ben Davidson '04, now a student at
the Law School, agreed with Abrams and expressed
hope that disability diversity would be taken into con
sideration in the admissions office as well.
"1 would like to explore with undergraduate and
graduate admissions officers the role that disabilities
have and ought to have in the admissions process," he
said. "1 believe that there is room for us to learn from
each other and that engaging in dialogue is an essential
part of our belonging to a community of scholars."
The group spent most of autumn quarter organizing,
but members hope to launch various awareness proj
ects this quarter. One such project is working to inte
grate questions about disability issues into "Crossing
the Line," a program in freshman dorms that challenges
students to think about diversity at Stanford.
Other plans for the future include training Resident
Assistants and Resident Fellows about disability needs,
better equipping the gym to serve disabled students and
starting sports teams for students with disabilities.
Kay's experience at the disability resource center at
the University of Arizona motivated him to begin his
group at Stanford. After he was injured, Kay spent a
year in rehab at the Tucson. Ariz, school, during which
he regained the ability to speak and walk. In the spring
of 2005. Kay even enrolled in classes at Arizona.
When he arrived at Stanford in the fall of that year.
Kay was accommodated by the staff at the Disability
Resource Center (DRC), but he found that the pro
grams and facilities for students with disabilities did not
compare to the wheelchair-friendly campus of Arizona.
Aman Kumar '09. who suffers from weak vision and
has a speech impediment, said Stanford's DRC actually
drew him to the University.
"The disabilities resource center at Stanford was one
of many reasons that drew me here in the first place," he
said. "Even as a prospective student. I found it far more
helpful than the DRCs at peer institutions."
But. as Kumar said, the DRC was not Stanford's only
attractive attribute.
"Another reason 1 came to Stanford was because of
the inclusive and tolerant culture." he added. "It really
makes life easier most of the time. People are patient
and very likely to bend the extra two percent that you
need."
Kay said he believes Stanford still has a long way to
go in terms of accommodating students with disabilities.
He hopes that in the future, freshman dorms will more

Davidson recommended the group not only to those
interested in disability advocacy, but also anyone with
an interest in issues of diversity.
"Anyone who just wants some general support from
a group of people who have overcome significant obsta
cles could find this group quite helpful," he said.
