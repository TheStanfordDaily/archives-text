## Editorial Board Have some class, seniors

L ist lluiisday. a Stanford student at
tending Senior Night at the Blue
( halk Cafe watched as her designated
driver threw back drink after drink. Terri
fied to be dtiven home by someone clearly
under the influence, she instead decided to
ride back on the Marguerite.
The student was carrying both her dri
ver's license proving that she was 21 and her
Stanford ID card. As she boarded the bus.
she showed hoth forms of identification to
the Stanford security guard supervising the
shuttle s\ stem Hie student was turned away
by the security guard and told to find anoth
er way home.
Ihe reason? Her Stanford ID did not
have the small holographic sticker on it re
quired to board the Senior Night Mar
guerite. Ihe student explained that she
knew her sticker was missing, but she was
afraid of driving home with a drunk driver.
Instead of giving her access to the bus,
the security guard referred the student to
the supervising guard on duty. Again, she
explained her situation. Again, she was de
nied access to the Marguerite. It was only
after 10 minutes of pleading with the super
vising security guard that she finally was al
lowed onto the charter bus. Ibis act of
mercy was actually a breach in policy â€” the
student should have been referred to a Se
nior Night sober monitor and given the
number of a cab company.

Hie easy argument would he that the Se
nior Class Cabinet has created this terrible
situation for stranded Senior Night atten
dees. rhey are the chief architects of the new
Senior Night policies that went into effect
this year, so they should be the ones to
change the policy to avoid similar circum
stances in the future.
However, before assigning blame, it is
important to question why the University
required the Senior Class Cabinet to put
such a strict policy in place. Perhaps the
General Counsel's Office was worried
about a messy incident involving Senior
Night splashing across CNN Headline
News? Maybe Stanford Parking and Trans
portation Services finally got fed up with
finding surprise body-fluid deposits inside
their buses?
The real reason that the female student
couldn't hop easily onto the Marguerite last
week is because we have messed up. We, the
undergraduate student body at Stanford,
have messed up, and we do not even seem to
be able to acknowledge it.
We as students need to take accountabil
ity for the fact that we are robbing ourselves
of our traditions through ridiculous behav
ior. We urinate publicly and get caught by
the police. We appear to be incapable of
serving as successful designated drivers. We
