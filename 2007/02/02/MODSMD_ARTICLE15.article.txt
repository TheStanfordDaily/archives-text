# An early Valentine's
## 
### 
Valentine's Day is still a few weeks
away, but since this is the end of my
run as a Daily columnist, I hope
you 'll forgive me for jumping the gun.
JTic connection between food and love is
too obvious to ignore.
M.I K. Fisher, my favorite food writer of
all time, wrote, "When I write of hunger. I
am really writing about love and the hunger
for it."
Even more specifically, though, through
out history certain foods have been believed
to enhance sexual desire. They're called
aphrodisiacs.afterAphrodiie.the Greek god
dess of love. Often these foods were singled
out for their physical resemblance to sexual
organs. Asparagus has long been believed to
be an aphrodisiac because of its phallic shape.
Ihe A/tec word for avocado, ahuacatl. means
testicle, apparently referring to the way the
fruit grows in pairs on the tree.
Hie catalog of foods believed at some
time or another to have aphrodisiacal pow
ers — asparagus, avocado, chocolate, gin
seng. oysters, truffles, green M&Ms —at
some point begins to suggest a sort of
Rorschach taste test for mankind. Every
thing reminds us of sex.
In general,science has not borne out the
sexual properties ascribed to these foods.
One possible exception is chocolate. Sever
al chemicals associated with happiness and
excitement, such as tryptophan, which con
tributes to the production of serotonin,
have been found in chocolate.
On the other hand, these chemicals
occur in such small concentrations that they
are unlikely to have a noticeable effect.
ITiat does not make chocolate any less of
a great choice to serve on Valentine's Day.
Even if the biochemical side doesn't pan
out.chocolate still has a cultural association
with love. Supposedly Montezuma con
sumed prodigious amounts of chocolate to
keep up his extensive love life. So when you
eat chocolate on Valentine's Day, you are

tapping into a centuries-old tradition.
Mexican hot chocolate would make for a
great Valentine's Day libation. Mexican
chocolate differs from European chocolate
in that it's processed with cinnamon. It has a
granular texture and often comes in cones or
discs. Blended with a little milk.it produces a
sexier, more complex take on hot chocolate.
You could even add a little chili powder
to spice things up. It you take that route,
look for one labeled with a specific variety
of pepper (ancho, for example). Generic
chili powder often contains garlic and salt,
which don't go great in hot chocolate.
As they say. it's the thought that counts.
Ibe fact that you went to the trouble may be
all the aphrodisiac you need.
Mexican hot chocolate
Serves 2
4 ounces Mexican chocolate
2 cups milk
Ancho chili powder (optional)
Break down the chocolate into smaller
pieces, either by cutting it with a heavy knife
or by snapping it apart with your hands. Com
bine the chocolate and milk in a saucepan and
heat over medium low. stirring with a whisk,
until it just begins to boil. Remove from the
heat and pour into mugs. It you like, gingerly
sprinkle a little of the chili powder over top.
