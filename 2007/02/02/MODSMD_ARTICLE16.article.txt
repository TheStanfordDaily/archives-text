For the record
As a speaker on campus Wednesday
night. I was pleased with the nice turnout
and good coverage in the Daily, but one
problem with said coverage really necessi
tated correction. I.et me be very clear: 1 did
not use the term "colored people" even
once in my speech, let alone the multiple
times that Mike Ding suggested I did. I said,
and say, "people of color." And while this
may seem like a semantic issue. I assure you
it is not. I"he term "colored people" is an his
torically offensive term, used by whites to
denigrate blacks, in particular, for genera
tions I would never use it, and never have.
"People of color." on the other hand, is a
term developed BY people of color them
selves Although it may sound essentially
the same, it isn't, for two reasons: first, the
historical origins of both terms (one as a vir
tual put down, and the other as an internal
ly developed phrase of pride), and secondly,
for reasons of emphasis "Colored people"
after all. suggests that the person's color is
what is most important about them, while

"people of color" implies that their person
hood (i.e.. their humanity) is paramount.
And yes. I know, the NAACP still stands
for the National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People, but their use
of the name is more in keeping with a proud
organizational history, rather than an en
dorsement of the phrase itself. Rarely if ever
will you hear members of that group, for ex
ample. call folks of color "colored people."
Perhaps the misunderstanding is genera
tional: after all. for someone like myself, in
my late 30s. I was made aware early on of how
problematic a term like "colored people"
was. It is possible that persons younger than
myself have never been taught those things,
and for that Mike I )ingcan most assuredly be
forgiven. But the way that language has been
and continues to be deployed to maintain
racism and subordination isan important les
son to learn nonetheless, no matter how late
in the day the lesson may come.
