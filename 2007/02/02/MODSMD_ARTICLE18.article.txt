## Coping with campus tragedies 
### GREG BOARDMAN 
In the last several weeks, the University
community has experienced the tragic and
still unexplained deaths of an undergraduate
and a graduate student and the media atten
tion that may accompany such incidents.
I wanted to first share with you my own
personal sadness and sense of loss. I feel that
I speak for the entire campus community in
extending my condolences to the families,
friends, and colleagues and to all who have
been touched by these tragic losses.
The death of a student is a haunting,and in
many ways, incomprehensible event — one
that profoundly affects all of us. 11 touches the
entire University community — students,
faculty, administration and staff. Sadly, these
are not the only student deaths that we have
endured: there have been a total of four stu
dent deaths in the past few months and, as we
grieve the loss of all these talented young
people, we are left with questions.
How much is known and can be shared
about the circumstances, and causes of these
deaths? As an administrator. I feel acutely
the need we all have for answers. It is human
nature to seek explanations and closure, es
pecially when faced with the issue of death;
however, it is not always possible to have the
certainty we seek.

Determinations of the cause of death can
he complicated and may take time. Coroners
are the authorities who gather all the data,
and only they can and should speak defini
tively. While that process unfolds, 1 under
stand that tension may lead to speculation
iind allegations. I urge all to avoid those and
be patient as the facts are disclosed.
Just as important, the University is not in
a position to supersede the privacy, legal
rights and prerogatives of families following
a student death. We wish to support families
in their grief, and not to complicate their dif
ficulties with unwanted intrusion and specu
lation. It may at times appear that the Uni
versity is holding back, and is somehow not
forthcoming, but it is the way we must re
spond as a community and an institution. I
hope you will understand that, and support
it.
1 am aware that many in our community
are asking about the implications of our re
cent deaths. Is this a safe campus? What
about student well being? I want you to
know that these issues are of paramount
concern to me and that Stanford is commit
ted to do its best to assure the well being of
our students.
First, Stanford is a safe campus. Our crime
statistics and the experience of those living
on campus show that this is a safe place to live

and work.
Though Stanford is first and foremost an
academic institution, we are also a caring
community committed to the well-being of
all our students. We have a large network of
services designed to proactively support stu
dents. Please make sure that you are person
ally aware of these services and take advan
tage of them whenever appropriate. You can
find a list of campus resources online at
http://nevvs-service.stan ford.edu/news/
2007/january3l /resource-013107.htm1.
In addition, we are actively collecting
ideas on how to enhance the supportiveness
of the campus community through an exist
ing student mental health and well being task
force created last summer. We will soon have
a Web site available where you can post your
ideas and suggestions.
We have the unique opportunity to live,
study and work alongside truly remarkable,
talented and diverse individuals who each
contribute to our life experience. In the com
ing days, weeks and months as we cope with
our losses, let's all reach out to one another
and express the care and concern we feel as
members of this community.
