# Life in the fast lane

Last week, my friends at the Official On
line I hinting Safety Course for Michi
gan Hunters facilitated an extended
comparison between the perilous world of
the animal hunt and the equally perilous
world of the job hunt.This week, however. I
need no outside sources to create my next ca
reer-related extended metaphor: the job
search-as-romantic-enterprise. Given the
unexpected dating deluge of the past six
months (apparently, the rain gods realized
that 24 years of drought is about all a girl can
take), 1 have more than enough material to
craft this one on my own.
Although the parallels between the quest
for the Right Job and the quest for the Right
Guy had never occurred to me, the synapses
started tiring at this Monday's Liberal Arts
( areer l air. As I walked intoTresidder's Oak
Lounge, there was something vaguely famil
iar about the room lull of crowded tables and
anxious candidates — and not just because
1 ve been to a few career fairs in my time.
Over and above the din of semi-awkward
small talk. 1 recognized the complex patter of
constant and conscious mutual evaluation.
Once you've attended one, there can be no
mistaking a speed dating event.
In many ways, the entirety of my past six
months comprises a form of speed dating. In
that short time, I've been on at least 17 first
dates, several of whom will probably read this

(remember when I promised I wouldn't use
your name?). Ironically enough, this pseudo
speed-dating blitzkrieg was predated by an
actual, honest-to-goodness, $30-for-one
evening-in-a-cheap-hotel-bar speed dating
evening.
The back-story: 1 can generally be con
vinced to try anything short of skydiving
once, so when my newly-single girl friend ap
proached me with the speed dating idea last
July. 1 happily agreed. The guidelines for the
evening were clear enough. Five minutes at
each table, state your name but reveal no
other personal information (therein lies the
only perceptible difference from the career
fair, where you hopefully hand over your re
sume sooner rather than later), and be sure to
give both parties ample time to introduce
themselves.
Before I go any further into the details of
the evening's spectacular failures, let me
begin to draw the connections to the inter

view process. In both cases, the event begins
long before it officially starts, requiring both
physical and mental preparation on the part
of the seeker. For starters, there is the all-im
portant issue of attire. In these highly super
ficial situations, first impressions matter. So
how do you represent yourself? Fun/casual?
Serious/professional? Athletic/unemploy
able'.' Hie choices are endless, and potential
ly disastrous. If your choice involves anything
overly revealing, under-washed or leather, it
is better left at home. Same goes for aviator
glasses, leisure suits, excessive cologne and
Harley Davidson rings. If only the men at my
speed-dating event had read this column
first...
Once you're fully and appropriately
clothed, it's time for the mental pre-game.
Different people take different approaches,
but all roads should lead to Rome (or, if
you're channeling I-Banking, Wall Street; if
not, pretty much any altar should suffice). In
real speed dating, of course, the Google
search is not an option;you get whomever (or
whatever) is at your assigned table. But in
other tirst date and interview situations, you
have the means and the information to do a

it's time for the event itself. Remem
ber the importance of the first im
pression: walk confidently up to the
table, make eye contact and give
your potential significant other a
winning smile. If you have braces or
a mustache, I highly recommend
stopping by a mirror first.
When it comes to conversation,
privilege your strengths; there's a
reason why the I IK reps wax poetic

and it's not because there are no

should be able to shine for five min

need to lay all your cards out on the
table from the get-go.Trust me, some
things (your future or current salary,
your astrological sign, your daily
phone calls to your mother) are bet
ter left unsaid.
One thing you should both know
and be comfortable discussing, how
ever. is what you're looking for. Al
though full-disclosure can be risky,
revealing your desire for a 35-hour
work-week or a 25-year-old house
wile may be the only way you're
going to locate such rare entities
(given that this is Silicon Valley, how
ever. I'd say good luck on both ac
counts). 1 have always been a girl
who knows what I want (trust me,
this gets easier and more obvious the
more dates/interviews you go on).
On Monday, I walked up to each
table and asked point-blank, "What
are your writing opportunities?"
Given the specific and complex na
ture of my writing interests (non
technical. creative and. above all,
meaningful), this question is the
equivalent of my romantic high stan
dards (I only have 200 words left,so
I won't start listing them here). Let's
just say that neither my Right Job
nor Right Guy is exactly a dime a
dozen.
Once you've made it through
your five minutes of key information
exchange, it's time to shake hands
and move along, l ime is of the

essence for both of you and there is
no reason to pretend otherwise. If
they've piqued your interest, it's
only natural to he curious about
what they're writing — either on
your resume or on their "I'd like to
hear from" card (in real speed dat
ing. anonymity is preserved by weal
ing numbered tags: the coordinators
contact you if you both indicate in
terest) — but lingering at the table is
a definite no-no. Much better to
walk away with the confidence that
you're worth calling back. If you
never hear from them again, it's their
loss, right?
Assuming all goes well at the
event, there's the issue of the follow
up. Call? Email? Wait 24 hours?
Iliree days? Two weeks? The choice
is yours, but I will say this: after you
pass the 24 hour mark, the longer
you wait, the more likely the open
ing will be filled by someone who's
more excited about the possibility of
a long-term commitment. As for
what to say when you make contact,
try something along the lines of "1
enjoyed meeting you the other
day/night, and I'd love to get togeth
er again soon." No need to write a
master's thesis or a stand-up come
dy routine (and yes, I've received
both).
Now 1 know I've made both of
these potentially stressful processes
sound like virtual cake-walks, but,
lest 1 mislead you, dear reader, I con
clude with a caveat. In an ideal
world, the jobs and dates at these
events would be worthy of someone
as high-quality as you. In reality,
however, the pickings are rather
slim. Because neither my friend nor
I, nor any of the other five speed dat
ing women, found a match, the event
coordinator generously offered us
another round on the house.

Last week, my friends at the Official On
line I hinting Safety Course for Michi
gan Hunters facilitated an extended
comparison between the perilous world of
the animal hunt and the equally perilous
world of the job hunt.This week, however. I
need no outside sources to create my next ca
reer-related extended metaphor: the job
search-as-romantic-enterprise. Given the
unexpected dating deluge of the past six
months (apparently, the rain gods realized
that 24 years of drought is about all a girl can
take), 1 have more than enough material to
craft this one on my own.
Although the parallels between the quest
for the Right Job and the quest for the Right
Guy had never occurred to me, the synapses
started tiring at this Monday's Liberal Arts
( areer l air. As I walked intoTresidder's Oak
Lounge, there was something vaguely famil
iar about the room lull of crowded tables and
anxious candidates — and not just because
1 ve been to a few career fairs in my time.
Over and above the din of semi-awkward
small talk. 1 recognized the complex patter of
constant and conscious mutual evaluation.
Once you've attended one, there can be no
mistaking a speed dating event.
In many ways, the entirety of my past six
months comprises a form of speed dating. In
that short time, I've been on at least 17 first
dates, several of whom will probably read this

(remember when I promised I wouldn't use
your name?). Ironically enough, this pseudo
speed-dating blitzkrieg was predated by an
actual, honest-to-goodness, $30-for-one
evening-in-a-cheap-hotel-bar speed dating
evening.
The back-story: 1 can generally be con
vinced to try anything short of skydiving
once, so when my newly-single girl friend ap
proached me with the speed dating idea last
July. 1 happily agreed. The guidelines for the
evening were clear enough. Five minutes at
each table, state your name but reveal no
other personal information (therein lies the
only perceptible difference from the career
fair, where you hopefully hand over your re
sume sooner rather than later), and be sure to
give both parties ample time to introduce
themselves.
Before I go any further into the details of
the evening's spectacular failures, let me
begin to draw the connections to the inter

view process. In both cases, the event begins
long before it officially starts, requiring both
physical and mental preparation on the part
of the seeker. For starters, there is the all-im
portant issue of attire. In these highly super
ficial situations, first impressions matter. So
how do you represent yourself? Fun/casual?
Serious/professional? Athletic/unemploy
able'.' Hie choices are endless, and potential
ly disastrous. If your choice involves anything
overly revealing, under-washed or leather, it
is better left at home. Same goes for aviator
glasses, leisure suits, excessive cologne and
Harley Davidson rings. If only the men at my
speed-dating event had read this column
first...
Once you're fully and appropriately
clothed, it's time for the mental pre-game.
Different people take different approaches,
but all roads should lead to Rome (or, if
you're channeling I-Banking, Wall Street; if
not, pretty much any altar should suffice). In
real speed dating, of course, the Google
search is not an option;you get whomever (or
whatever) is at your assigned table. But in
other tirst date and interview situations, you
have the means and the information to do a
background check, if you so desire. Regard

it's time for the event itself. Remem
ber the importance of the first im
pression: walk confidently up to the
table, make eye contact and give
your potential significant other a
winning smile. If you have braces or
a mustache, I highly recommend
stopping by a mirror first.
When it comes to conversation,
privilege your strengths; there's a
reason why the I IK reps wax poetic
about benefits and growth potential,
and it's not because there are no
downsides to their company. You
should be able to shine for five min
utes, and so should they. I lonesty is a
great quality, but no one says you
need to lay all your cards out on the
table from the get-go.Trust me, some
things (your future or current salary,
your astrological sign, your daily
phone calls to your mother) are bet
ter left unsaid.
One thing you should both know
and be comfortable discussing, how
ever. is what you're looking for. Al
though full-disclosure can be risky,
revealing your desire for a 35-hour
work-week or a 25-year-old house
wile may be the only way you're
going to locate such rare entities
(given that this is Silicon Valley, how
ever. I'd say good luck on both ac
counts). 1 have always been a girl
who knows what I want (trust me,
this gets easier and more obvious the
more dates/interviews you go on).
On Monday, I walked up to each
table and asked point-blank, "What
are your writing opportunities?"
Given the specific and complex na
ture of my writing interests (non
technical. creative and. above all,
meaningful), this question is the
equivalent of my romantic high stan
dards (I only have 200 words left,so
I won't start listing them here). Let's
just say that neither my Right Job
nor Right Guy is exactly a dime a
dozen.
Once you've made it through
your five minutes of key information
exchange, it's time to shake hands
and move along, l ime is of the

essence for both of you and there is
no reason to pretend otherwise. If
they've piqued your interest, it's
only natural to he curious about
what they're writing — either on
your resume or on their "I'd like to
hear from" card (in real speed dat
ing. anonymity is preserved by weal
ing numbered tags: the coordinators
contact you if you both indicate in
terest) — but lingering at the table is
a definite no-no. Much better to
walk away with the confidence that
you're worth calling back. If you
never hear from them again, it's their
loss, right?
Assuming all goes well at the
event, there's the issue of the follow
up. Call? Email? Wait 24 hours?
Iliree days? Two weeks? The choice
is yours, but I will say this: after you
pass the 24 hour mark, the longer
