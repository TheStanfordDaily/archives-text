Last week, my friends at the Official On
line I hinting Safety Course for Michi
gan Hunters facilitated an extended
comparison between the perilous world of
the animal hunt and the equally perilous
world of the job hunt.This week, however. I
need no outside sources to create my next ca
reer-related extended metaphor: the job
search-as-romantic-enterprise. Given the
unexpected dating deluge of the past six
months (apparently, the rain gods realized
that 24 years of drought is about all a girl can
take), 1 have more than enough material to
craft this one on my own.
Although the parallels between the quest
for the Right Job and the quest for the Right
Guy had never occurred to me, the synapses
started tiring at this Monday's Liberal Arts
( areer l air. As I walked intoTresidder's Oak
Lounge, there was something vaguely famil
iar about the room lull of crowded tables and
anxious candidates — and not just because
1 ve been to a few career fairs in my time.
Over and above the din of semi-awkward
small talk. 1 recognized the complex patter of
constant and conscious mutual evaluation.
Once you've attended one, there can be no
mistaking a speed dating event.
In many ways, the entirety of my past six
months comprises a form of speed dating. In
that short time, I've been on at least 17 first
dates, several of whom will probably read this

(remember when I promised I wouldn't use
your name?). Ironically enough, this pseudo
speed-dating blitzkrieg was predated by an
actual, honest-to-goodness, $30-for-one
evening-in-a-cheap-hotel-bar speed dating
evening.
The back-story: 1 can generally be con
vinced to try anything short of skydiving
once, so when my newly-single girl friend ap
proached me with the speed dating idea last
July. 1 happily agreed. The guidelines for the
evening were clear enough. Five minutes at
each table, state your name but reveal no
other personal information (therein lies the
only perceptible difference from the career
fair, where you hopefully hand over your re
sume sooner rather than later), and be sure to
give both parties ample time to introduce
themselves.
Before I go any further into the details of
the evening's spectacular failures, let me
begin to draw the connections to the inter

view process. In both cases, the event begins
long before it officially starts, requiring both
physical and mental preparation on the part
of the seeker. For starters, there is the all-im
portant issue of attire. In these highly super
ficial situations, first impressions matter. So
how do you represent yourself? Fun/casual?
Serious/professional? Athletic/unemploy
able'.' Hie choices are endless, and potential
ly disastrous. If your choice involves anything
overly revealing, under-washed or leather, it
is better left at home. Same goes for aviator
glasses, leisure suits, excessive cologne and
Harley Davidson rings. If only the men at my
speed-dating event had read this column
first...
Once you're fully and appropriately
clothed, it's time for the mental pre-game.
Different people take different approaches,
but all roads should lead to Rome (or, if
you're channeling I-Banking, Wall Street; if
not, pretty much any altar should suffice). In
real speed dating, of course, the Google
search is not an option;you get whomever (or
whatever) is at your assigned table. But in
other tirst date and interview situations, you
have the means and the information to do a
background check, if you so desire. Regard
less, many daredevils, myself included,
choose to go into it blind, in the hopes that
