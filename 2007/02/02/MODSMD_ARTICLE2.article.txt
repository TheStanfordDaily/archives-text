Fans, let the countdown begin: J.K. Rowling

mensely popular Harry Potter series will be re

Potter in his 17th year as he continues to battle
Lord Voldemort, the wizard who killed his par
ents.
"We join J.K. Rowling's millions of readers
— young and old. veterans and newcomers —
in anticipating what lies ahead," said Scholastic
Children's Books president Lisa Holton. in a
press release.
The first book,"Harry Potter and the Sorcer
er's Stone." was released almost a decade ago
and made Rowling an international celebrity.
Since then. Stanford students and fans around
the world have eagerly followed Harry's jour
ney, anticipating each new installment with in
creasing fervor.
Reactions to release date vary
Rumors had been swirling about the book's
release date for months, and many fans were
hoping it would be unveiled on July 7, 2007
(07/07/07).
"For symmetry's sake, it would've been awe
some to have the seventh book come out on the
seventh day of the seventh month of the sev
enth year." said Carlos Ortiz '07.
Marisa Dowling '09 also found the release
date somewhat disappointing.
"I really didn't think it'd be until one year
from now." Dowling said."! was just like,what?
What? And the fact that it's a week after the
movie? I guess maybe it's a Harry Potter blitz."
The fifth movie in the series."HarryPotter and
the Order of the Phoenix." is due for release July
13.Dowling said she thought the book and movie
releases should have been more spread out.
"I don't know why they decided to do this,
and 1 kind of want it to last a little longer." she
added.
Matt Docker '10 said ho would probably
wait until tho rush diod down before purchas
ing his copy.
"I'm not the midnight party typo of fan."
agreed AlishaTolani'lo."l wont one year,and
it was like a party for 10-year-olds."
Some fans, however, wore already excitedly
planning for tho Friday night release.
Ortiz said that ho didn't know whore ho
would be on July 21. but that ho plans to bo at a
store to pick up a book at midnight.
"I wont to a midnight party when tho sixth
book came out and it was really fun — it was
liko being a six-year-old again," ho said.
Anneli von Reinhart '07, a self-described
"huge I larry Potter fan," said she was surprised
at her lack of excitement.
"1 got nervous because I'm afraid." von
Reinhart said."l've been living in I larry Potter
world since junior year of high school, and I
don't want it to be over yet. It's going to bo a
major struggle and I can't even decide whether
1 want to read it."
Some remain unaffected by the Harry Pot
tor craze.
Tristan Harris '06 said he didn't know any
thing about I larry Potter and was unaware that
this newest book would he the last in the series.
"July 21st means nothing to mo." Harris
said.
Booksellers prepare lor
event of the decade
Bookstores across the world, upon hearing
the announcement, immediately began to pre
pare.
The book has already reached the number
one spot on tho online presales of
Amazon.com. Borders and Barnes and Noble.
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"
tho sixth book in the series, was the fastest-sell
ing book in history, selling ft. 1 ) million copies
within the first day of its release in July 2005
and easily topping the worldwide bestseller list,
according to Scholastic.
All six books have been bestsellers, and
there are currently 120 million copies in print in
the United States.
With a $34.99 list price, increased $5 from
the previous installment, stores have moved

quickly to reduce prices for their customers.
Amazon.com and Borders are selling the
book for $18.89 — a 46 percent savings rate —
while Barnes and Noble's price for non-mem
bers is $20.99, a 40 percent markdown.
Representatives from the Borders book
store on University Avenue in Palo Alto are
preparing for the July release.
"We've had quite a few people calling al
ready and asking if they can reserve a copy,"
said Borders employee Mat Kendall.
Pam Parsons, another employee, said she
expected it to be the largest lay-down release
for the store and definitely the largest reserve
request of the year.
Parsons said that, as with previous releases.
Borders will have a midnight release party with
Pottor-thomed events before fans who have re
served their copies can take them homo.
"Last time, it was a big thing on University
Avenue, with a real mix of people eating dinner
and hanging out in the area," she said. "It was a
great Saturday summer night."
She added that this release party should bo
bigger than any of its predecessors.
"It's tho last one — it's the big ending
party." Parsons said. "We will have more than
we have had for anything else. It's just been
going higher and higher in the number of first
printings sold. From a book perspective it's just
phenomenal."
Students speculate about series' ending
In the almost two years since tho sixth book
in the series,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood
Prince," was released, fans have boon exchang
ing rumors and predict ions about plot details in
the final book.
Rowling announced early on that the last
word in the seventh book would be "scar," but
other than that has offered few conclusive do
tails. only mysterious hints.
Ortiz said he has been rereading the books
over the past couple months and speculating
about plot details in the final novel.
"1 think Harry is somehow related to Godric
Gryffindor and it's going to come full circle at
the end. Gryffindor versus Slytherin," Ortiz
said."l 'm also speculating that tho final fight be
tween I larry and Voldemort is going to occur in

Dumbledore's of
fice, and that's how w
he'll be integrated 1
into the seventh book, 1
through his portrait in '
the office."
A big question on
fans' minds: Is Severus
Snape good or evil?
"I can't decide," Ortiz
said."l'm going to go with
my instinct and say that
he's good, that he'll redee

himself before he dies. I think
he will die in this hook but there will be re
demption — same thing with Malfoy."
Von Reinhart also remained undecided
about Snape's character.
"I think there's a lot of evidence either way
but I think you can't really get around the fact
that, as far as we've seen.Snape has never done
anyone physical harm," she said. "I don't think
he's completely evil, though 1 think he's a nasty,
dirty man that I wouldn't want to be friends
with."
"I'm almost positive Snape is good, though
1 have no basis to that," said Decker.
"1 think he's evil, but 1 know many people
think he's good," Dowling said. "He killed
Dunibledore. Evil. Period. End of story."
For a limited time, Borders and Walden

hooks customers will be able to proclaim their
loyalty to one of the two camps with a free
sticker upon reservation.
Customers will be able to choose which
sticker they want: "Trust Snape" cr"Snape is a
very bad man."
Avid readers have their minds made up
about how the series should and will end.
Von Reinhart was convinced that Volde
mort would die in the final installment.
"Otherwise, what's the point of the fight be
tween good and evil if evil lives?" she said. "It's
a kids' book."
Howling brought up another issue on many
fans' minds: Will Harry survive the book's end
ing?
"I just really hope Harry lives "she said. "If
he dies, I'll be very sad."
