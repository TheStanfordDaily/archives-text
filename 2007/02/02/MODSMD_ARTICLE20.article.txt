## Stanford should work harder for faculty diversity 
### STUDENTS OF COLOR COALITION 
The recent announcement of the depar
ture of Political Science Prof. I .uis Fraga from
Stanford University lias refueled many dis
cussions about the importance of faculty di
versity on our campus. As an organization,
the Students of Color Coalition (SOCC) is
deeply concerned about the recent loss of
many faculty of color. The departure of Prof.
Iraga, who is one of a handful of faculty of
color who has left within the last few years,
should lead the University to re-evaluate its
faculty diversity policies.
While Stanford may already have strong
faculty diversity recruitment and retention
programs, it is imperative that in its contin
ued commitment to faculty diversity, Stan
ford must honestly and critically examine
why such faculty have accepted positions in
other universities. Stanford must make a con
certed effort to recruit more faculty of color
who can bring both the mentorship and the
intellectual curiosity that Prof. Fraga and the
other departed faculty have provided for the

Stanford community. We believe that Stan
ford should create a stronger infrastructure
of people and resources to support its re
cruitment and retention policies for faculty
of color.
While the loss of Professor Fraga is felt by
us all. it is important to put his departure in
the context of the loss of several faculty of
color in many different departments within
the last two years. In the political science de
partment last year, tenured African Ameri
can Prof. Claudine Gay left for Harvard
while Asian American Prof. Carolyn Wong
moved to Carleton College in Minnesota.
Gay and Wong taught courses concerning
African Americans and Asian Americans in
American politics, respectively. Most recent
ly, two tenured Asian American professors
— Akhil Gupta and former Asian American
Studies Chair Purnima Mankekar. both in
the CASA department, announced their de
parture to UCLA, leaving only two profes
sors to teach Asian American Studies-related
courses.
The departure of five faculty of color in

the past two years should be reason enough
for the University to scrutinize and improve
its faculty diversity policies. It is possible, if
enough resources are committed, to recruit
and retain faculty of color, like Prof. Fraga,
whose unyielding commitment to student
learning is surpassed by few. We strongly en
courage the University to take active steps to
fulfill the void that these faculty of color have
left, as well as develop and commit resources
to a long-term faculty diversity plan.
Strengthening the connection between Uni
versity departments and diversity adminis
trators would help to retain faculty of color.
Contrary to what some students may
argue, focusing on faculty diversity does not
detract Ironi standards of academic rigor or
quality teaching. If anything, faculty of color
strengthen Stanford by offering unique per
spectives that are well-suited to speak to our
diverse student body. SOCC wants it to be
clear that our communities are also commit
ted to having great faculty on campus and
having a campus environment that
actively engages different intellectu
al perspectives. We believe that the
University can promote diversity
within the professoriate while main
taining its commitment to intellectu
al variety.
Finally, we would like to com

mend the ASSU on passing a resolu
tion that will hopefully make large
strides on the issues of both faculty
and graduate student diversity.
However, we know that this is only
the first step in the process of ensur
ing a diverse faculty throughout all
departments at Stanford.
