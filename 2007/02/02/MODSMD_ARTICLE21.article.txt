## Card roll over UCSB in second half No. 8 women dominate in 17th-straight win, 84-59 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you're keeping tally, notch mark number 17
into the count. That's how many consecutive wins
the No. 8 Stanford women's basketball team has
registered over this stretch of the season. The Car
dinal dominated UC-Santa Barbara last night with
an 84-59 victory.
While Stanford (19-3, 11-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) opened the mutch up with a steady lead, the
Gauchos( 11-10,5-2 Big West Conference) went on
an 8-0 run with three minutes left in the first half to
climb within three. But the Cardinal responded,
sinking 32 unanswered points over the next 10 min
utes of play. Senior forward Kristen Newlin attrib
uted the scoring to motivation after the break.
"We knew that the first five minutes of the sec
ond half were crucial," Newlin said. "We got things
going. We wanted to get the ball inside, they [dou
ble-teamed), we kicked it out, and things were just
falling for us."
Junior guard Candice Wiggins, who led all scor
ers with 21 points, agreed that Stanford's opportu
nity to regroup helped change the momentum.
"1 think it was important that we got together,
regrouped and refocused," Wiggins said. "They
were playing at a very fast pace, and we wanted to
make sure that we didn't get caught up in that.The
key word of the half was definitely 'poise.'"
Poise was seen primarily in the post, where sen
ior Brooke Smith registered a double-double with
16 points and 10 rebounds;Newlin's 10-point. nine-

GAME NOTES: Stanford marked it's first appearance in Santa
Barbara since Nov. 24, 1984. The Cardinal has won nine of
the 10 games played between the two schools. Stanford
wraps up non-conference play with a 7-3 record. The Cardi
nal bench outscored the Gaucho reserves 26-7. Stanford im
proves to 6-0 in Thursday games this year. The Cardinal
owned a dominating 44-25 edge in the rebounding depart
ment, including a 29-13 advantage after the first 20 minutes.

rebound appearance was only one board shy of a
double-double. Wiggins noted that the paint play
ers were the greatest influences in the game.
"1 think our biggest advantage was our inside
game," Wiggins said. "They played four guards, so
we were able to get it inside. [Smith] had some early
foul trouble, but she was able to come back in the
second half and really show why she's one of the
best post players in the country. And [Newlin] also
stepped up; she stayed out of foul trouble, and got
a bunch of rebounds."
While freshman Jayne Appel added nine points
and seven rebounds to the Cardinal's lethal rota
tion of forwards, she struggled the most to limit her
fouls. Appel left the game with five fouls in only 14
minutes of play. Wiggins believes the difficulty is
merely a sign of Appel's youth.
"I think that [Appel's] foul trouble is just a
learning experience," Wiggins said."l look back to
my freshman year, and it seems like I was in foul
trouble every single game. It's just one of those
things that you pick up and you learn. Its not some
thing that she can really concentrate on or think
about because that would be more of a distraction.
I don't think it's going to be a problem."
Despite this minor chink in Stanford's armor,
the Gauchos' leading scorer, center Jenna Green
(14 points), could not find a way to match the re
bounding prowess of Smith, Newlin and Appel.
Stanford pulled down 44 rebounds compared to
UCSB's 25—15 of the 44 came as offensive
boards.
The Cardinal also found success in transition.
Wiggins said that running the court was "definitely
another big advantage." Newlin recognized Stan
ford's ability to capitalize on its shots in transition.
"We knew that we wanted to run," Newlin said.
"We didn't want to call a timeout, even though we
were tired, because we knew that we could keep
running and getting those easy layups. We're al
ways trying to look up the floor and get easy bas
kets on a breakaway with no defense."
While an on-the-run offense helped to propel
the Cardinal's 32-point mid-game roll, scoring in
that stretch alone was shared by seven different
Stanford players.The Gauchos, on the other hand,
did not display similar offensive balance. With four
players scoring 12 or more points, UCSB received
its remaining 7 points from only two bench players.
As Stanford prepares to return home and face
No. 21 California at I p.m. on Sunday, the team
again looks toward the leadership of its upperclass
men.aswell as an even distribution of scoring. Wig
gins says the Cardinal will look to draw upon the
lessons of their long string of victories to find re
peated successes in the future.
"We've got a long winning streak that we want
to keep going," Wiggins said. "We just want to be
hungrier and not be satisfied with just winning."
