# TOP FIVE TO WATCH
## 
### 
1. Avert Anderson
Cal forward Ryan Anderson leads the
Bears and all Pac-10 freshmen in scor
ing with 1 7.2 points per game. Looking
to limit Anderson is Stanford forward
Brook Lopez, fresh off Pac-10 Player of
the Week honors. Anderson was held
to 12 points on 4-of-14 shooting when
the teams last met on Jan. 3.
2. Bounce back
The Cardinal are 4-1 following a loss
this season. A solid win in Berkeley
would lessen the sting from Stanford's
67-63 defeat to Cal at Maples earlier
this season and would cement the
Card's resume for the Big Dance.
3. Tame the
turnovers
Stanford's 16 turnovers against Gon
zaga proved especially costly
Wednesday night, as the Zags
scored repeatedly on the ensuing
fast breaks. Better control will serve
the Card well against the Bears and
prevent Stanford from giving up easy
buckets in transition.
4. Greater Goods
Guard Anthony Goods' late-game
heroics against Gonzaga overshad
owed what was an otherwise tepid
shooting night (1 -for-8 before he
awoke in the 44th minute). More con
sistency from the streaky sophomore
is a must.
5. No such thing as

a free lunch
Head coach Trent Johnson said he's
"not going to worry about" the Cardi
nal's ugly 16-for-26 performance
from the stripe on Wednesday. But a
similarly unsightly 1 8-for-29 at the
line doomed the Card against the
Bears last month.
