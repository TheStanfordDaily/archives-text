in determining seeding in the conference tournament.
Despite the pressure that is building on head coach Kerry
McCoy's squad to perform its best yet. he says he's never felt bet
ter about his team's chances.
"I feel really good," McCoy said. "Last week was probably our
toughest week of training, and our best. We had a good perform
ance [against Menlo College] and,so far in practice, the guys have
looked even better this week."'
Perhaps even better news for the Cardinal comes on the injury
front, as No. 16 junior Josh Zupancic at 157 pounds and sopho
more Jared Boyer at 197 pounds should both return to action
today. Zupancic, especially, is a key starter for Stanford. He and
No. 3 junior Tanner Gardner at 125 pounds represent the Cardi
nal's only nationally ranked wrestlers. McCoy stressed that his
team knows just how crucial these last few weeks of competition
will be for the conference and NCAA tournaments at the end of
February.
"Our full lineup should be ready to compete," he said. "It's im-
portant to just go out there these last
three weeks and get ready for the
end of the season â€” our guys know
it's important."
Including last weekend's exhibi
tion victory over Menlo College, the
Cardinal are riding a three-meet
winning streak heading into today's
competition. Oregon and Cal Poly,
on the other hand, have had more
up-and-down seasons as of late.
"We really don't know what to ex
pect as far as lineups go." McCoy
said. 'I do know that they're both
very tough teams. Cal Poly is always
one of the conference's top teams
and Oregon is coming off of a season
where they had two Ail-Americans
and a national champion."
Hie match ups are particularly
intriguing in that it doesn't appear
the Cardinal will be matching
strength against strength. Both
squads are strong in the 133.197 and
heavyweight weight-classes, and
Oregon is also strong at 141 pounds.
Rie Cardinal are still looking for
consistency at most of those weights.
"On paper, I don't necessarily
know who the favorites are individu
ally. but both those teams are expect
ed to come in and beat us," McCoy
said. "Our guys just have to realize
that and go out and defend our home
gym. liven though we don't get
10.000 people coming to our match
es. being home is huge."
Ihe Cardinal have been strongest
this season at 125 pounds, where
(iardner has racked up a 27-3 record
with nine pins, as well as in the four
weight classes from 157 to 184
pounds, where Zupancic, senior
Urian Perry, sophomore l.uke Feist
and true-freshman Zack Geisen

have all been solid performers. Re
gardless of how I riday's competition
goes, everyone on the team should
have a better idea of where lie stands
by Saturday.
"There are actually seven teams

competing [today]" McCoy said."So
everyone's kind of wrestling each
other.The guys know it doesn't matter
who the competition is; they're just
getting ready for the end of the year."
First up tonight for the Cardinal is

Oregon at 5 p.m., followed by Cal
Poly at 7 p.m. Both matches will be
wrestled in Burnham Pavilion.
