Logar.and Yelsey and Durkin.All of

son and Logar winning most con
vincingly, as they defeated their
counterparts from Vanderbilt 8-0.

face a familiar, but also formidable,
opponent: Pacific-10 Conference
rival No. 11 California. The match

takes place at 1:30 p.m. today.
A lot will be on the line when
Stanford takes on Cal.but the Cardi

ting motivated for the match.
If Stanford wins today, the Cardi
nal will face either North Carolina or
Georgia Tech in the semifinal round.
Both teams won their matches yes
terday against Pepperdine and Texas
Christian, respectively.
Although the Cardinal are three
time defending national champions,
Stanford has yet to establish its dom
inance early in the season. Winning
the tournament would go a long way
toward legitimizing the Cardinal's
current No. I ranking.
