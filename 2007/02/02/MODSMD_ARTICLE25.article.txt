# Nolan Gallagher Through My Eyes
## Friday-Night Spotlight 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
The Cardinal pitching corps lust three
key contributors to the Major League
Baseball First-Year Player Draft at the
end of last season. 1 leadlining the list of
pro departures was 2(X)6 junior, right
hander Greg Reynolds, taken second overall by
the Colorado Rockies.
And suddenly, the Cardinal was without its
staff ace and a key team leader — Reynolds had
led the team on its near miraculous recovery from
a horrendous season start and would eventual-

ly help take Stanford all the way to C'orvallis.
Ore. in the NCAA Super Regionals.
So entering the 2(X)7 season, a new

frontline pitcher was needed for the Car
dinal starting rotation, and there was a
significant leadership void to be filled.
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess knew

just who to turn to. Junior right-hander
Nolan Gallagher will take the mound tonight

in Fullerton, Calif, as the squad's "Friday-
Night Pitcher." a role Marquess couldn't seem
to overemphasize.
"[Gallagher] might be facing the best Friday
night player in the country," said Marquess, refer
ring to Fullerton starter Wes Roemer (13-2,2.3K
ERA). "That will probably be the toughest
match-up we have all year, but I think he's up to
that challenge. 1 le's competitive, he can throw

more than one pitch for a strike and he's a win
ner, so 1 think he'll do a good job for us."
Gallagher (5-5,3.99) knows he has a lot
to live up to, but he didn't shy away from the

importance of his first start against a Pacif
ic-10 Conference rival this season.
"As a starting pitcher, you can either get
your team going or you can get them

hanging their heads." Gallagher said.
"So 1 just want to go out there, get a
few quick innings and get us back

in the dugout, and let us swing it a
little. 1 want to do the best I can
to just get us going for the week-

end — and for the year, really,
because I think that first big
win against a good team is

going to be a big step for
us."

And Fullerton is cer
tainly a good team.
The Titans were 50-

15 and tied for third
at the College World
Sewes in 2006. Al-

though Fullerton only returns four starting posi
tion players and one starting pitcher from last sea
son. Gallagher still expects a tough battle that
should tell the entire team where they are in their
quest to get back to the College World Series for
the first time since 2003.
"I couldn't think of a better spot I'd rather be
in."Gallagher said.' I'm really excited.They made
it to the College World Series last year, they've al
ways been a top-notch program and they've got a
big guy starting for Friday, so you can't wait to be
in that position. It lets you know where you're at
starting against a good program like that."
Over the long haul of the regular season
though, it will be paramount for Gallagher to de
velop not only as a pitcher, but perhaps more im
portantly as a leader for a team that will be fight
ing for supremacy in the Pac-10.
"I think it'simportant [for Gallagher to step up
as a leader]." Marquess said. "If you're happy at
the end of the season not just with your pitching
but with your team in general if you think
you've had a good season — normally your older
players, your juniors and seniors, probably have
had their best years of their careers. It's his year to
step up and fill in that leadership role, and I think
he's ready to do that."
Gallagher also believes in the power of leader
ship, because he's seen it first-hand after a partic
ularly hard 12-3 loss to Arizona last April 23.
"There was a moment last year when we were
kind of down in the dumps and struggling." Gal
lagher said."And the seniors kind of just pulled us
aside and said there were two things we could do
with this: We could either go cold or we could step
up and deal with it. I think that was kind of a big
thing. We just realized, what better thing to do
than to come back. Of all my time at Stanford, that
was probably my most memorable experience."
Marquess believes that Gallagher will be in a
good position to become one of the best starters
in the Pac-10, in part because of all the pitching
talent that left the league at the end of the 2006
season.
"It would be more worrisome if we were in this
situation last year, because the league was domi
nated by great Friday-night pitching," Marquess
said. "But all those guys are gone, so everybody is
in the same boat. Nolan is going to be our Friday
night guy, and he's got as much chance as anybody
in our league to fill that role and be a top-notch
starter."
