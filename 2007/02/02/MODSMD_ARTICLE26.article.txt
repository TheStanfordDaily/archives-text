# PAC-10 Conference Outlook
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
With three Pacific-10 Con
ference pitchers selected
among the first 10 picks of the
200(i Major League Baseball
First-Year Player Draft, quali
ty young arms could make the
all the difference in this year's
conference title-race. Then
again, a team with a strong of
fense could capitalize on the
inexperience of the confer
ence's hurlers.
"The league will he wide
open because no one has dom
inant pitching [on par with last
season]," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said. "I'd be a lot
more concerned with this team
if this was last year, but every
one's in the same boat. Five or
six teams could win [the con
ference]."
Though the conventional
wisdom says the top spots are
up for grabs, here are the
Daily's predictions for each
team going into the 2007 sea
son:
(Teams are ordered accord-
ing to their position in the preseason
coaches' poll. Rankings are accord
ing to the ESPN/USA Today Poll.)
No. 15 Arizona State (37-21, 14-10
Pac-10): The Sun Devils were select
ed to finish first by the coaches, due,
in part, to what should be a prolific
offense led by Wallace Watch nomi
nees infielder Eric Sogard (.353 BA,
9 HR. 50 RBI) and outfielder Ike
Davis (.329,9 and 65). But concerns
surround their rotation. Only three
pitchers return from last year, and
the 13 newcomers to the staff are a
relative unknowns in Pac-10 compe
tition.
"They play smash-mouth base
ball," Stanford junior infielder Adam
Sorgi said. "You expect them to hit
three to four homeruns a game at
home."
No. 14 Oregon State (50-16, 16-7):
Despite winning the last two confer
ence crowns and entering the season
as the defending College World Se
ries Champions. Oregon State was
picked to finish second. That drop
may be in response to what the
Beavers lost: their top three pitchers
and last year's Pac-10 Player of the
Year. Cole Gillespie. But Marquess
thinks the Beavers may have a slight
edge due to the returning talent re
turning on their pitching staff. On the
mound, junior Mike Stutes (8-2,3.10
ERA, 14 GS) and Eddie Kunz (5-1.
3.61 in 29 appearances) will look to
fill the 316.4 innings pitched that
were lost to the draft.
No. 25 Stanford (33-27, 11-13):
Offensively, the Cardinal will look
for a big year from "Baseball Amer
ica" third team All-American jun
ior outfielder Michael Taylor (.325,
5.29), who should hit in the third or
fourth spot in order. Stanford will
also get a boost in the second week
with the return of Sorgi from injury
after he led the team with a .322 bat
ting average in his sophomore year.
The sophomore tandem of right
hander Nolan Gallagher and south
paw Jeremy Bleich will anchor the
starting rotation. Freshman Jeffrey
Inman has a chance to make an im
mediate impact as a starter as well.
With tough road trips to Cal State-
Fullerton and Texas in the first
three weeks, Stanford will know
where it stands nationally from
early on.
No. 21 UCLA (33-25, 13-10): The
fourth Pac-10 team to reach the
NCAA Regionals last year, UCLA
took two of three from Stanford at
Jackie Robinson Stadium in 2006. Se
nior 'fyson Brummett (6-7. .452) will
try to transition from pitching on
Sundays to Fridays as the Bruins'
new No. 1 starter. Bay-area product
Brandon Crawford should provide a
solid middle-of-the-order hitter
(.318. 6, 30). Hie sophomore short
stop spent his summer playing for the
U.S. National Team.

Arizona (27-28,12-12): After finish

ing fourth in conference last year.
Arizona returns its entire starting ro
tation in 2007. Led on the mound by
lefty Brad Mills (6-5,4.7,82 IP), the
Wildcats will look to improve on
their conference-worst 5.41 team
ERA last season. Offensively, the
Wildcats return the majority of a
team that hit for a .350 average with
43 home runs. Junior infielder Colt
Sedbrook. who set a team record
after being hit by a pitch 26 times,
also boasted a .339 average and
should provide the 'Cats with an of
fensive spark.
California (26-28, 9-15): After los
ing ace Brandon Morrow, the Gold
en Bears plan to lean heavily on
sophomore right-handed pitcher
Tyson Ross. Ross, who notched a
3.19 ERA in 84.2 innings may be the
cornerstone, but sophomores Matt
Gorgon and Craig Bennison will
need to provide some depth behind
their Friday starter. The freshman
class will infuse the team with defen
sive speed and new base-stealing
threats, while Fullerton transfer
David Cooper will provide a solid
bat. Cooper hit .305 as a freshman,
including a 5-5 night against top
seeded Clemson in the 2006 College
World Series,
Southern California (25-33, 1 1-13):
The biggest change for USC will be
in the dugout. Long-time Trojan
skipper Mike Gillespie retired in
June after 20 years. New head coach
Chad kreuter opened the season
with a 6-4 victory over Cal Poly snap
ping the 11-game losing streak that
ended USC's 2006 season. The Tro
jans lost their entire outfield, but re
turn All-Pac-10 second baseman
Matt Cusick (.368, 4. 35). USC also
returns 75 percent of its starters from
last season.
Washington (36-25, 1 1-13): Stan
ford swept Washington at home last
year, and the I luskies have lost some
talent since then. Washington will be
without their best player from last
year, two-time Pac-10 Pitcher of the
Year Tim Lincecum (12-4. 1.94
ERA. 125.1 IP) who was drafted by
the San Francisco Giants with the
10th overall pick in the draft. The
I luskies' only preseason All-Ameri
can, junior Third-Teamer Matt
Hague will attempt to switch from
the outfield to third base this year.
Offensively. Washington will count
on Hague and his school-record .394
batting average.
Washington State (36-23, 10-14):
The Cougars have a .254 confer
ence winning percentage since
1999. and were once again picked
to finish last in the Pac-10. Wash
ington State finished one game out
of a tie for fifth place last season,
and returns with a team that is
largely unchanged from 2006.
Seven of nine position players and
eleven of fourteen pitchers return
for the Cougars. On offense, sopho
more outfielder Jared Prince will
look to build on a season in which
he hit over .400 (.401.9.58).

team going into the 2007 sea
son:
(Teams are ordered accord-
ing to their position in the preseason
coaches' poll. Rankings are accord
ing to the ESPN/USA Today Poll.)
No. 15 Arizona State (37-21, 14-10
Pac-10): The Sun Devils were select
ed to finish first by the coaches, due,
in part, to what should be a prolific
offense led by Wallace Watch nomi
nees infielder Eric Sogard (.353 BA,
9 HR. 50 RBI) and outfielder Ike
Davis (.329,9 and 65). But concerns
surround their rotation. Only three
pitchers return from last year, and
the 13 newcomers to the staff are a
relative unknowns in Pac-10 compe
tition.
"They play smash-mouth base
ball," Stanford junior infielder Adam
Sorgi said. "You expect them to hit
three to four homeruns a game at
home."
No. 14 Oregon State (50-16, 16-7):
Despite winning the last two confer
ence crowns and entering the season
as the defending College World Se
ries Champions. Oregon State was
picked to finish second. That drop
may be in response to what the
Beavers lost: their top three pitchers
and last year's Pac-10 Player of the
Year. Cole Gillespie. But Marquess
thinks the Beavers may have a slight
edge due to the returning talent re
turning on their pitching staff. On the
mound, junior Mike Stutes (8-2,3.10
ERA, 14 GS) and Eddie Kunz (5-1.
3.61 in 29 appearances) will look to
fill the 316.4 innings pitched that
were lost to the draft.
No. 25 Stanford (33-27, 11-13):
Offensively, the Cardinal will look
for a big year from "Baseball Amer
ica" third team All-American jun
ior outfielder Michael Taylor (.325,
5.29), who should hit in the third or
fourth spot in order. Stanford will
also get a boost in the second week
with the return of Sorgi from injury
after he led the team with a .322 bat
ting average in his sophomore year.
The sophomore tandem of right
hander Nolan Gallagher and south
paw Jeremy Bleich will anchor the
starting rotation. Freshman Jeffrey
Inman has a chance to make an im
mediate impact as a starter as well.
With tough road trips to Cal State-
Fullerton and Texas in the first
three weeks, Stanford will know
where it stands nationally from
early on.
No. 21 UCLA (33-25, 13-10): The
fourth Pac-10 team to reach the
NCAA Regionals last year, UCLA
took two of three from Stanford at
Jackie Robinson Stadium in 2006. Se
nior 'fyson Brummett (6-7. .452) will
try to transition from pitching on
Sundays to Fridays as the Bruins'
new No. 1 starter. Bay-area product
Brandon Crawford should provide a
solid middle-of-the-order hitter
(.318. 6, 30). Hie sophomore short
stop spent his summer playing for the
U.S. National Team.

Arizona (27-28,12-12): After finish

ing fourth in conference last year.
Arizona returns its entire starting ro
tation in 2007. Led on the mound by
lefty Brad Mills (6-5,4.7,82 IP), the
Wildcats will look to improve on
their conference-worst 5.41 team
ERA last season. Offensively, the
Wildcats return the majority of a
team that hit for a .350 average with
43 home runs. Junior infielder Colt
Sedbrook. who set a team record
after being hit by a pitch 26 times,
also boasted a .339 average and
should provide the 'Cats with an of
fensive spark.
California (26-28, 9-15): After los
ing ace Brandon Morrow, the Gold
en Bears plan to lean heavily on
sophomore right-handed pitcher
Tyson Ross. Ross, who notched a
3.19 ERA in 84.2 innings may be the
cornerstone, but sophomores Matt
Gorgon and Craig Bennison will
need to provide some depth behind
their Friday starter. The freshman
class will infuse the team with defen
sive speed and new base-stealing
threats, while Fullerton transfer
David Cooper will provide a solid
bat. Cooper hit .305 as a freshman,
including a 5-5 night against top
seeded Clemson in the 2006 College
World Series,
Southern California (25-33, 1 1-13):
The biggest change for USC will be
in the dugout. Long-time Trojan
skipper Mike Gillespie retired in
June after 20 years. New head coach
Chad kreuter opened the season
with a 6-4 victory over Cal Poly snap
ping the 11-game losing streak that
ended USC's 2006 season. The Tro
jans lost their entire outfield, but re
turn All-Pac-10 second baseman
Matt Cusick (.368, 4. 35). USC also
returns 75 percent of its starters from
last season.
Washington (36-25, 1 1-13): Stan
ford swept Washington at home last
year, and the I luskies have lost some
talent since then. Washington will be
without their best player from last
year, two-time Pac-10 Pitcher of the
Year Tim Lincecum (12-4. 1.94
ERA. 125.1 IP) who was drafted by
the San Francisco Giants with the
10th overall pick in the draft. The
I luskies' only preseason All-Ameri
can, junior Third-Teamer Matt
Hague will attempt to switch from
the outfield to third base this year.
Offensively. Washington will count
on Hague and his school-record .394
batting average.
Washington State (36-23, 10-14):
The Cougars have a .254 confer
ence winning percentage since
1999. and were once again picked
to finish last in the Pac-10. Wash
ington State finished one game out
of a tie for fifth place last season,
and returns with a team that is
largely unchanged from 2006.
Seven of nine position players and
eleven of fourteen pitchers return
for the Cougars. On offense, sopho
more outfielder Jared Prince will
look to build on a season in which
he hit over .400 (.401.9.58).

With three Pacific-10 Con
ference pitchers selected
among the first 10 picks of the
200(i Major League Baseball
First-Year Player Draft, quali
ty young arms could make the
all the difference in this year's
conference title-race. Then
again, a team with a strong of
fense could capitalize on the
inexperience of the confer
ence's hurlers.
"The league will he wide
open because no one has dom
inant pitching [on par with last
season]," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said. "I'd be a lot
more concerned with this team
if this was last year, but every
one's in the same boat. Five or
six teams could win [the con
ference]."

wisdom says the top spots are
up for grabs, here are the
