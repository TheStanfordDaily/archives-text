# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## No. 3 polo hosts Stanford Invitational 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
It's hard to say that the members of the No. 3
women's water polo team are set to "hit the
ground running," as their sport involves neither
the ground nor running. Call it "diving in kicking"
or "starting things off with a splash," but regardless
of how its euphemized. the Cardinal will he ready
to go this afternoon when it jumps into the pool for
their season opener against I lawaii.
Hie Stanford squad has taken on a unique look
this year, featuring a new senior leadership core,
an emerging supporting cast and a fresh set of
faces. It is a team with an identity distinctly differ
ent from that of the team that claimed victory in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation confer
ence tournament last year before finishing third in
the NCAA tournament. But according to junior
driver Jackie Ciauthier, that fact is reason only for
optimism about the upcoming campaign.
"I aeh year the team dynamic changes and peo
ple step into new and more prominent roles," she
said. I here are girls that have really taken to the
challenge and will have a big impact in the coming
season. It's exciting to watch and be a part of."
Co-captains for the Cardinal squad this year
are seniors Alison Gregorka and Katie Hansen.
Gregorka, a two-meter defender, competed this
past summer in the 2006 FIN A World Cup as a
member of the U.S. national team. She will also be
asked to handle some of the toughest defensive as
signments in the league as an integral member of
Stanford's defense. Hansen, meanwhile, posted
the team's second-highest scoring total last year,
and will be the most experienced driver in the
Stanford lineup. The Cardinal will depend upon
Hansen to guide the offense and to pose a long
range scoring threat from the perimeter.
((implementing Gregorka and I lansen are fel-

low seniors Meridith McColl
and and Christina Hewko. Both
have played invaluable roles in
the team's success in recent
years, as evidenced by their five
combined nominations for All-
American honors. McColl be
gins her fourth season in the
cage as the Cardinal's startintÂ»

goalkeeper, already having racked up more than
500 saves in her career. Hewko will continue to
constitute an irreplaceable two-way force, assum
ing critical roles at the two-meter mark in both the
offensive and defensive ends of the pool.
Gauthier and driver Megan Nesland are the
team's lone juniors, together providing leadership
by example in their work ethic and dedication to
the team. Driver Lolo Silver and two-meter Jessi
ca Steffens head a strong sophomore class, with
five freshman newcomers rounding out the Stan
ford squad's roster.
With a lineup balanced in nearly every regard,
it comes as no surprise that every member of the
Cardinal sees the squad as primed to compete for
the 2007 NCAA title.
"Like every Stanford water polo team, we set
out with the intention of competing for a national
championship." said head coach John Tanner, who
enters his 10th season at the helm of the women's

team. "We intend to compete
every day in practice, with an
eye toward competing in the last
game, the last tournament and
the last day of the collegiate sea
son.
"The biggest thing we've car
ried over from last year and the
years past is a serious commit-

ment to excellence, from game strategy to how we
walk onto a pool deck," I lansen added. "Winning
NCAAs is the reason for everything we do. But
May is a long time off, so we're taking it one game
at a time, starting with [today]."
Speaking about the Cardinal's opener against
the Rainbow Wahine and the Stanford Invitation
al in the two days following, Nesland clearly cap
tured her team's eagerness to get the season un
derway.
"[We're all] very excited to actually play some
blood-pumping, nail-bitingly exciting games," she
said. "It's time to start getting paid back for all the
work we have done so far."
The Cardinal play at 4 p.m. this afternoon at the
Avery Aquatic Center and will be hosting the
Stanford Invitational tournament all day Saturday
and Sunday.
