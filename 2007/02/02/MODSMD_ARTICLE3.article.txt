## EE exams press students Students, faculty criticize shortcomings of must-pass test 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This is the second of a two-part
series on (he high-stakes doctoral
qualifying exams (quals) in the
electrical engineering department.
Yesterday's article ("High-stakes

Port TWO
of two

EE exams elicit stress, pressure ") dis
cussed the examination process and students' study
ing techniques; today's piece covers the controversy
surrounding the tests and their aftermath.
Almost all doctoral programs have qualifying
exams, which are as diverse as the fields the tests
examine. UC-Berkeley's EE quals involve a one
hour examination between a student and three
professors in the student's area. MlT's Ph. D.cand
idates take final exams in undergraduate courses
and present their research to a committee.
Stanford's chemical engineering department
utilizes "pre-quals," with students presenting an
other scholar's published research before they
present their own findings in the actual qualifying
exam. The mechanical engineering department re
quires that students gain research experience be
fore taking the quals.
The crushing attrition of the EE quals — no
more than bO percent of students will pass in any

given year — can be attributed in part to the num
bers: There are simply not enough positions in re
search groups (nor is there enough funding lor re
search) for the 100-plus students each year who
seek them, and not all students possess the profi
ciency to do doctoral-quality research.Hie depart
ment enrolls approximately 200 graduate students
each year, and typically passes fewer than l >o
through each year's qualifying exam.
Second-year EE graduate student Drew Hall
said that the forced competitiveness of the qualify
ing exam makes the process imprecise.
"There's so much pressure to make the ques
tions harder each year, so professors end up with
questions that most people can't even get an an
swer for," he said. "And it's harder to score those
kids, which introduces noise into the process."
I fall cited a bottleneck in the middle of the scor
ing — a difference of a single point above or below
the passing mark can involve a dozen or more stu
dents.
"It is only good for picking out the very top and
the very bottom," he added.
Several students said their advisors had private
ly expressed frustration with the quals. especially
regarding the hassle of the process and the need to
make questions harder each year. I T I department
Chair Bruce Wooley noted that students tend to
get too worked up about the exams.
"The important thing is to get an advisor." he
said, citing examples of students who passed but

sponsor their work.
Hall and third-year EE doctoral
candidate Kim Shultz both feel that
more students should be "weeded
out" of the Ph.D. track in the admis
sions office. Hall says that the quals
receive unfair criticism in light of the
sheer numbers.
"It does what it needs to do, yet
every body blames it"he said.
However. Wooley says changes in
admissions are not feasible and that
stricter admissions standards would
impede the quality of research.
"Especially with all the interna
tional students, we just can't tell by
the transcript who is Ph.D. material,"
he said. "Sometimes it's not the high
scorers [in classes] who are successful
in research."
Wooley added that quals were a
necessary obstacle that forces stu
dents to consider if thev reallv want a
Ph.D.
"If we could make [admissions]
better, we would," he said.
A recent policy change may have
helped reduce the field and increase
the pass rate. Several years ago, the
department added a Masters-only
option to their admissions process,
accepting a batch of students who are
barred from taking the quals.The de
partment had previously admitted all
graduate students into the Ph.D.
track.
The number of students taking the
quals has declined in the last three
years, possibly aided by this policy. A
departmental administrator declined
to release admissions statistics to The
Daily.
ITie Master's-only option caters to
students who do not aspire to earn a
doctoral degree. Second-year gradu
ate student Christina Hernandez is

anxious to graduate and return to the
working world.
"1 have no life right now," she said
jokingly. "Six more months and I
have a life. I'm looking forward to
having nothing to do at 6 p.m."
There is a final appeals process
for students who fail to pass the
quals after two years. A faculty
committee reviews appeal requests
and considers both the student's ac
ademic performance and research
portfolio. Students who show po
tential stand a decent chance at
having their results overturned —
another reason Wooley and other
faculty members emphasize finding

a research advisor early in the grad
uate career.
Upon passing the quals,students
can officially declare as Ph.D. can
didates, provided they obtain two
faculty members to serve as disser
tation advisors. Students must then
complete a doctoral research proj
ect, present and defend their re
sults to a committee and write a
thesis, which must be approved by
the advisors.
In electrical engineering, the en
tire process can take anywhere from
three to seven years, depending on
the project's complexity and the stu
dent's initiative.

EE students typically hit the night life
scene twice — once for finishing the
exams and again when they get their
results.

friends, then headed to the Rose and

questions that most people can't even get an an
swer for," he said. "And it's harder to score those
kids, which introduces noise into the process."
I fall cited a bottleneck in the middle of the scor
ing — a difference of a single point above or below
the passing mark can involve a dozen or more stu
dents.
"It is only good for picking out the very top and
the very bottom," he added.
Several students said their advisors had private
ly expressed frustration with the quals. especially
regarding the hassle of the process and the need to
make questions harder each year. I T I department
Chair Bruce Wooley noted that students tend to
get too worked up about the exams.
"The important thing is to get an advisor." he
said, citing examples of students who passed but

could not get a faculty member to
sponsor their work.
Hall and third-year EE doctoral
candidate Kim Shultz both feel that
more students should be "weeded
out" of the Ph.D. track in the admis
sions office. Hall says that the quals
receive unfair criticism in light of the
sheer numbers.
"It does what it needs to do, yet
every body blames it"he said.
However. Wooley says changes in
admissions are not feasible and that
stricter admissions standards would
impede the quality of research.
"Especially with all the interna
tional students, we just can't tell by
the transcript who is Ph.D. material,"
he said. "Sometimes it's not the high
scorers [in classes] who are successful
in research."
Wooley added that quals were a
necessary obstacle that forces stu
dents to consider if thev reallv want a
Ph.D.
"If we could make [admissions]
better, we would," he said.
A recent policy change may have
helped reduce the field and increase
the pass rate. Several years ago, the
department added a Masters-only
option to their admissions process,
accepting a batch of students who are
barred from taking the quals.The de
partment had previously admitted all
graduate students into the Ph.D.
track.
The number of students taking the
quals has declined in the last three
years, possibly aided by this policy. A
departmental administrator declined
to release admissions statistics to The
Daily.
ITie Master's-only option caters to
students who do not aspire to earn a
doctoral degree. Second-year gradu
ate student Christina Hernandez is

anxious to graduate and return to the
working world.
"1 have no life right now," she said
jokingly. "Six more months and I
have a life. I'm looking forward to
having nothing to do at 6 p.m."
There is a final appeals process
for students who fail to pass the
quals after two years. A faculty
committee reviews appeal requests
and considers both the student's ac
ademic performance and research
portfolio. Students who show po
tential stand a decent chance at
having their results overturned —
another reason Wooley and other
faculty members emphasize finding

a research advisor early in the grad
uate career.
Upon passing the quals,students
can officially declare as Ph.D. can
didates, provided they obtain two
faculty members to serve as disser
tation advisors. Students must then
complete a doctoral research proj
ect, present and defend their re
sults to a committee and write a
thesis, which must be approved by
the advisors.
In electrical engineering, the en
tire process can take anywhere from
three to seven years, depending on
the project's complexity and the stu
dent's initiative.

EE students typically hit the night life
scene twice — once for finishing the
exams and again when they get their
results.
Shultz celebrated her high score
by attending her favorite bar in
Mountain View and sleeping in. Sec
ond-year doctoral candidate Tom
O'Sullivan went out for dinner with
friends, then headed to the Rose and
Crown for drinks. O'Sullivan is
thrilled the quals are behind him.
"There's nothing like your first
time," he said.
