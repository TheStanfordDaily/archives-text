## EE exams press students Students, faculty criticize shortcomings of must-pass test

This is the second of a two-part
series on (he high-stakes doctoral
qualifying exams (quals) in the
electrical engineering department.
Yesterday's article ("High-stakes

EE exams elicit stress, pressure ") dis
cussed the examination process and students' study
ing techniques; today's piece covers the controversy
surrounding the tests and their aftermath.
Almost all doctoral programs have qualifying
exams, which are as diverse as the fields the tests
examine. UC-Berkeley's EE quals involve a one
hour examination between a student and three
professors in the student's area. MlT's Ph. D.cand
idates take final exams in undergraduate courses
and present their research to a committee.
Stanford's chemical engineering department
utilizes "pre-quals," with students presenting an
other scholar's published research before they
present their own findings in the actual qualifying
exam. The mechanical engineering department re
quires that students gain research experience be
fore taking the quals.
The crushing attrition of the EE quals — no
more than bO percent of students will pass in any

given year — can be attributed in part to the num
bers: There are simply not enough positions in re
search groups (nor is there enough funding lor re
search) for the 100-plus students each year who
seek them, and not all students possess the profi
ciency to do doctoral-quality research.Hie depart
ment enrolls approximately 200 graduate students
each year, and typically passes fewer than l >o
through each year's qualifying exam.
Second-year EE graduate student Drew Hall
said that the forced competitiveness of the qualify
ing exam makes the process imprecise.
"There's so much pressure to make the ques
tions harder each year, so professors end up with
questions that most people can't even get an an
swer for," he said. "And it's harder to score those
kids, which introduces noise into the process."
I fall cited a bottleneck in the middle of the scor
ing — a difference of a single point above or below
the passing mark can involve a dozen or more stu
dents.
"It is only good for picking out the very top and
the very bottom," he added.
Several students said their advisors had private
ly expressed frustration with the quals. especially
regarding the hassle of the process and the need to
make questions harder each year. I T I department
Chair Bruce Wooley noted that students tend to
get too worked up about the exams.
"The important thing is to get an advisor." he
said, citing examples of students who passed but
