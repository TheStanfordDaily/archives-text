# STUDENT HOUSING
## Coed housing debated Students supportive, administrators hesitant 
### CAMILA TAPERNOUX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the Draw looming only a few
months away, many students are al
read\ considering their housing op
tions for next year. And some say that
the\ want roommates of the opposite
sex.
More than 20 colleges and univer
sities offer the option for coed pairings
in room assignments,a policy Stanford
has yet to offer.
Some of the schools offering coed
housing include Wesleyan University,
Swarthmore College. Sarah Lawrence
College and UC-Riverside.
At Wesleyan, upperclassmen can
enter the General Room Selection —
that school's version of the Draw — in
groups of up to six people, regardless
of gender. Housing options include
dorms and university-owned apart
ments and houses.
"I'd say it's pretty common for guys
and girls to live together." said Wes
leyan freshman Gianna Palmer.
Hut it's not quite Three's Company
at Stanford.
In contrast, Stanford offers coed
housing only for married couples or
domestic partners without children.
According to Director of Housing As
signments Susan Nunan, there are cur
rently 76 undergraduates and 816
graduate students living in coed rooms
on campus.
"Single-sex rooms are generally
the standard in other universities,"
Nunan said in an email, "although a
few colleges and universities are ex
perimenting with methods to allow
some coed housing."

Currently, the only way unmarried
students can room with someone of
the opposite sex is by living in a coop
erative house.The Columbae co-op,
for example, does not segregate rooms
by gender. Instead, residents have
total control over roommates.
"I've lived in Columbae for three
years now, and the experience has
been extremely positive," said Eva
Dehlinger '07. "It really adds balance
to rooms and lessens the pressure to
be gender binary. It's hard for me to
grasp why people don't have this op
tion on other parts of campus."
Nunan said that permitting coed
roommates would create a gender im
balance in houses across campus.
However, as Bharat Venkat '07
pointed out. the University allows
housed fraternities and sororities —
which are. by their nature, single-gen
dered — to remain on campus. Venkat
questioned why dorms must have sim
ilar numbers of men and women if
there are no such regulations regard
ing racial background, class year and
sexuality.
"Why, when it comes to gender," he
asked, "are we so afraid of having un
even numbers?"
Jeff Waheed '10 implied that stu
dents can go behind administrator's
backs in order to live in a coed room.
"They can't stop you once you get
into the house," he said.
Still. Nunan said that a coed hous
ing policy' is not a popular sticking
point for the majority of students.
"We currently receive very few, if
any. requests for coed housing at Stan
ford." she said. "Most students and
their parents assume that they will be
living in single-sex rooms when com
ing to campus."
