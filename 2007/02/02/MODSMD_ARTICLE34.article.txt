### YOUR FRIENDLY EDITORS INTERMISSION FAITHFUL 
Volume 231. Two-THIRTY-onc.
The frightening thing is. Brendan was here back in the day for
Volume Two-TWENTY-one. Betsy isn't quite that old. but hey,
everyone still thought she was graduating last year anyway. Rumor
is she's really class of 2003. (We're still waiting for confirmation
from Megan and Sameer. though.)
So Brendan and Betsy are back to serve up another volume of
Intermission for you all. Why? Well, for one. it's Brendan's last
volume ... soon he'll be entering the "real world," complete with
a Blackberry-oriented corporate 9 to 5 (a.m.) and everything.
Scary. And for Betsy, well, when Brendan made offers of all-night
Tiger Woods PGA Tour tournaments on his PS2 and complimen
tary In-n-Out runs, she couldn't resist signing up for her FOURTH
lour of duty. (Yikes, even the U.S. military doesn't make you do a
fourth ... yet.)
But wait, we're getting ahead of ourselves ... it's not even just
Brendan and Betsy this time. Enter Natalie (a.k.a. "nabar'). Natal
ie will be handling Monday Mayhem this volume and — get this —
turning it into a TWO-page section. That means a full two pages of
madness every Monday. We hope you can handle it. And if you
can't, for God's sake get on our mailing list (contact
intermission.daily@gmail.com for more information) so you can
start writing for us in order to, well, get some stuff in the section that

you CAN handle. Meanwhile, Brendan and Betsy will be holding
down the fort on Fridays, bringing you 12 pages of Intennissiony
goodness, all for you to enjoy over those mediocre pancakes and
ready-made eggs at Wilbur.
Between Mondays and Fridays, we hope to bring you the latest
and greatest about movies, music, TV, popular culture, art, drama,
campus events — you get the picture. Just name it (ahem, as long as
it's not News or Sports), and it's our aim to cover it. We're planning
for this to be the best volume of Intermission ever, so that means
even more amazing themes (The "In n' Out issue"? Pure genius, we
say.. •). zany antics (Joel Stein stalking and treasure maps, to name
a few) and good times. (Stop by the office on Thursdays and we'll
gladly introduce you to Pebble Beach, for A LOT cheaper than the
typical green fee)
So sit back, relax and enjoy Volume 231 of Intermission. We're
confident you'll like it. And if you don't, please, let us know how we
can improve what we're running. Or, if you're interested in being
part of the team (whether through writing, poking us on Facebook
or whatever), be sure to let us know. We'd be happy to have you
aboard, in whatever capacity you're interested in contributing. Like
we said above, shoot us an email at intermission.daily@gmail.com.
Alternatively, you can give us a call at 650-725-2100 xsl2(though we
can't promise that we'll actually check the voicemail more than once
a month) or stop by Storke on a random Thursday night to see what
we're about.
You won't be disappointed.
