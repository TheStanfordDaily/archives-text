# Clap Your Hands has less pop, more crackle
## tunes 
### BRENDAN SELBY INTERMISSION HAND CLAPPER 
After listening to the first track of
"Some Loud Thunder" you might be
tempted to rush out and buy new head
phones. Surely it can't be intentional to
have that much static in the background
— right?
With their second release. Clap Your
Hands Say Yeah and lead singer Alec
Ounsworth are throwing a lot of shit at
the wall: some harmonica here, some
clanking cutlery there, a stray trumpet
whinny, quite a few blips and Kraftwerk
like computer effects, and yes, more
than a little static (think John Lennon's
voice on "I Am the Walrus"). Not all of
it sticks. The melodies are still there, the
energy less so, but now you have to go
looking for both.
Put it this way: If, in all earnestness,
you were to name your book "Read It
and Weep," I had better be bawling by
page 12. And if you were to name your
band, "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah" ...
you get the idea.
Indeed, the beauty of their 2005 self
titled debut was the group's apparent
earnestness in taking on the ridiculous.
When, on the track "Is This Love?",
Ounsworth sang, "You're so much dif
ferent than me, this I know,"and his
voice cracked three times on the last
word, you might have been laughing if
you weren't so affected. It's also the rea
son that "Upon this Tidal Wave Of
Young Blood" was one of the best anti
war songs in the past few years. Amid all
the cleverness and sarcasm, we needed
someone who sounded on the verge of a
mental breakdown to remind us: "But
upon this tidal wave (Oh God! Oh
God!), young blood."
The first album reaffirmed that hav
ing fun can be an act of rebellion. In this
respect Clap Your Hands has something
in common with Arcade Fire, which
taught that anyone who says you can't
stay awake forever is a dirty liar. Is it a
coincidence that these two bands had
the most successful indie debuts since
the start of the current war?
If the great new Arcade Fire single
"Intervention" is any indication, that
group's forthcoming album "Neon
Bible" will pick up the banner about
where "Funeral" left off. Over a crush
ing background of pipe organs, the song

explores the conscience of a mercenary
soldier who is "working for the church
while my family dies."
Sometimes bluntness is a virtue.
"Some Loud Thunder," on the other
hand, wanders through more difficult
and hermetic terrain. Static aside, the
initial title track is just about the only
danceable tune. The best tracks are the
slow ones. "Love Song No. 7," for ex
ample, is a fine piano ballad that de
clares, with cynicism worthy of Thorn
Yorke, that we're all "safe and sound."
"Goodbye to the Mother & the Cover"
is gentle and beautiful, putting to good
use the band's capacity for strange,
repetitive backgrounds. "Yankee Go
Home," the album's most political
song, is a bluesy, three-chord jam that
just plain works. The last song. "Five
Easy Pieces," allows the guitars to waltz
and shuffle around Ounsworth as he
basically chants the same note over and
over.
Unfortunately, the strident produc
tion values begin to intrude on otherwise
good songs like "Emily Jean Stock" and
"Arm & Hammer." Meanwhile, "Un
derwater (You & Me)" starts off well
but turns out to be a one-trick pony that
goes on far too long. In a sense, the
album title says it all. The band does not
seem to be after lightning flashes of fo
cused brilliance, but rather an ominous
diffusion of noise and chaos.
At the risk of scoring the obvious
point, none of these tracks will actually
tempt the listener to clap his or her
hands. The prevailing mood, as on
"Mama. Won't You Keep Them Castles
in the Air and Burning?", is a quasi-po
litical paranoia:
"And I'm touched by the same sad
feeling of dread
Just to know that you can't wait to see
me dead
An idea in your head and a compass
in your hand
On a mission to a foreign land."
Unfortunately, this sentiment is not so
hard to find these days.
If nothing else, "Some Loud Thun
der" is an interesting album with sev
eral spine-tingling songs. By the end, it
provides enough rewarding moments
to justify your time and money —as
long as, after hearing it, you didn't go
out and buy new headphones by mis
take.
