## Who's in, who's out: Hollywood edition 
### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION HOLLYWOOD SIGN 
There's an old saying in Hollywood that
"you're only as good as your last picture."
When deciding who's "in" and who's "out" in
Tinseltown these days, that maxim is worth
keeping in mind.
Sam Raimi: The creator of the "Evil
Dead" trilogy and creative genius behind the
"Spider-man" franchise, Raimi is currently
one of Hollywood's most sought after direc
tors. His phenomenal success with Peter
Parker has also made him one of the few di
rectors that film geeks would be comfortable
with tackling an adaptation of "The Hob
bit" which is a good thing if recent rumors
are to be believed. Would Raimi's version of
Tolkien's book be any good? I'm not sure but
it's hard to imagine someone who's better
suited to this kind of material (other than
Peter Jackson). Raimi is definitely "in."
Alfonso Cuaron: Okay, so it wasn't that
hard to imagine someone better-suited to
"The Hobbit" after all! Cuaron's work with
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"
should convince you of that. His most recent
endeavor, "Children of Men," was also very
smart. Cuaron is "in" and so is fellow Mexi
can director and good friend ...
Guillermo del Toro: Actually, Del Toro
should be a contender for directing "The
Hobbit" as well. "Pan's Labyrinth" was one
of best films of 2006. At the very least, the
year's most visually striking movie. The
"Hellboy" director is definitely "in."
Sofia Coppola: Speaking of visually strik
ing, "Marie Antoinette" was a splendid
movie to look at. Unfortunately, it was also
an interminable bore and one 2006's most

vapid movies. De-

spite their visual anc
aural similarities,
it's difficult to rec
oncile
involvement!

both this movie and "Lost in Translation."
The daughter of legendary director Francis
Ford Coppola is "out."
M. Night Shyamalan: My oh my. If
"Marie Antoinette" was one of the emptiest
movies of 2006, "Lady in the Water" was one
of the stupidest. Words cannot describe how
painful it is to watch Shyamalan's latest at
tempt to blend fantasy and reality. The direc
tor was showing "signs" (Gcddit? Ah, that's
just too funny!) of creative fatigue with "The
Village" but few would have predicted some
thing this awful. Shyamalan is also "out."
Mel Gibson: The star of Shyamalan's alien
invasion film "Signs," Gibson didn't have the
best 2006 and managed to add to this article's
opening phrase: "You're only as good as your
last picture. But if you behave like a retarded
anti-semite, it doesn't matter if your last
movie was 'Citizen Kane.' " Apparently
"Apocalypto" was a really good film but it
barely recouped its production cost at the US
box office. Gibson is "out."
Tom Cruise: Perhaps Gibson should have
paid closer attention to the recent misfor
tunes of Tom Cruise? "Mission Impossible
III" was artistically the best of the series (not
saying much) but its domestic take of $133
million was well below that of the first two
movies. Cruise is certainly "out."
Katie Holmes: The mother of Cruise's
child and former "Dawson's Creek" star.
Holmes is also "out." Literally that is!
Though her character from "Batman Begins"
returns for its sequel. "Dark Knight," Holmes
won't be reprising the -role. Current rumors
suggest the gorgeous Rachel McAdams
("The Notebook," "Red Eye") will be play
ing Bruce Wayne's girlfriend instead.
McAdams is "in."
