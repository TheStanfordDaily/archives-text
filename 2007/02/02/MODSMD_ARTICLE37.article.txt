## DEERHOOF: AS CUTE AS TOURISTS 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION DEER HUNTER 
When chatting with my friends regarding college, one
thing I like to brag about is how Stanford gets attracts Japan
ese and other Asian tourists. Japanese people-come 5,000
miles to visit my school — Stanford must be good. And when
ever I see them on my bike ride to chemistry. I never cease to
be amused and impressed. They're so funny! They're so cute!
From the start to finish of Deerhoofs latest album,
"Friend Opportunity," I had the same feeling of impressed
amusement. It's not just Japanese lead singer Satomi Mat
suzaki's inimitable voice or the dynamic experimental ener
gy of the songs — rather, it's the combination of the two that
create such an remarkable result.
It's difficult to describe Deerhoofs unique sound, but
they're certainly no normal rock band. They are unafraid to
experiment and have created a sound that is both slick and
controlled. A prominent feature of "Friend Opportunity" is
the precise and varied percussion that helps to drive each
song. Deerhoof also provides their tunes with crunching, rol
licking guitars as well as synthesizers.
But perhaps the most distinctive part of Deerhoofs
sound is Matsuzaki's voice. It's utterly adorable, conjuring
up images of Hello Kitty, koalas and animals wearing
clothes. While the voice is light, little and floating, the pro
duction is done so well that it is never obscured.

The album begins with three gorgeous songs, "The Per
fect Me," "+81," and "Believe E.S.P." The first abruptly
starts with guitar and foot-tapping percussion interplaying
with each other, and tells the plaintive story, with a lonely girl

asking others to "Meet me/meet
the perfect me." When Matsuza
ki girlishly sings these lyrics, it's
almost as if you need to get up,
find her and give her a hug.
"+81" starts with a horn in
troduction and then commences
with marching drums carried by
sugary guitars and bass. Like all
the other songs on the album
(except for "Look Away"), the
song is short (three minutes) and
therefore easily keeps the listen
er's attention for the entire song.
"Believe E.S.P." features a
cowbell that keeps the rhythm of

the song as well as guitars and horns that mirror and accen
tuate Matsuzaki's voice. The song, like nearly all the rest on
the album, is playful, featuring a vibe that seems straight
from a pinball machine.
A song that doesn't seem to fit on this restless album is
"Whither the Invisible Birds?", which exhibits an appealing
dreamlike feel. Instead of strpng drums and guitars, "Whiter"

features sonorous piano and Matsuzaki singing in a slow, de
liberate and melodic manner.
It's songs like this that showcase Deerhoofs imaginative ex
perimentalism. In "Kidz Are So Small," the tunc starts off like

some of the others on "Friend Op
portunity" — with fast-paced
horns and packed energy — but
then suddenly shifts gears, as if the
band suddenly decided they want
ed a change of pace. Matsuzaki
starts to sing, "If I were man," and
again we again are lulled into the
sense that this is going to be a nor
mal soqg telling us how the singer
would act if she were a man. But
then Matsuzaki continues with
"and you are dog/I'd throw a stick
for you." No, this is no conven
tional tune, but one full of a
strange, amusing atmosphere.

For that matter, this is no conventional album. Rather,
Deerhoof has created an experimental — yet accessible —
work that's an incredible amount of fun to listen to. However,
there is one thing I will never do: Listen to this album on the
way to chem class. Because not only could the police cite me,
but if I saw those Japanese tourists, I would be overwhelmed
by a cuteness overload.
