### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION SHIN 
I have a sort of nostalgic love for The Shins. They were the
first "indie" band 1 really ever listened to. 1 remember popping
in "Chutes Too Narrow" and being absolutely enchanted by the

group s ability to craft some
thing original, beautiful and
moving that was light-years be
yond any of the stale material
that was on the radio. And yes.
I started listening to The Shins
long before 1 watched "Garden
State."
The Shins's long-awaited
third album, "Wincing the
Night Away," follows their
2001 debut, "Oh, Inverted
World." and 2003's much ac
claimed "Chutes." As the title
suggests, "Wincing the Night
Away" is darker and less play
ful than its predecessors but re
tains The Shins's previous or
ganic style, which blends old
school pop, independent rock
and folk.
However, "Wincing" can't
continue the progress it made
between "Oh, Inverted World"

and "Chutes" — but what band could? "Wincing" is certainly a
decent album, maybe even a good album, but it falls far short of

the excellence of The Shins's prior efforts.
One of the failures of "Wincing" is that it lacks the spectacu
lar songs of Chutes Too Narrow — "So Says I" and "Young Pil
grims" come to mind —• and while it has a couple of decent
songs, by in large, the album is a relatively pedestrian effort.
There certainly are songs that I like on "Wincing." such as

"Sleeping Lessons" and "Girl
Sailor," but there's no song that
could be put on repeat and still
retain its freshness.
Certainly, "Wincing" is
more "mature" than The Shins's
older material. The songs are
more varied and feature a little
more production, and the songs
are technically more challeng
ing, moving away from The
Shins's previous simplistic
sound. In addition, "Wincing" is
a more "focused" album, as op
posed to "Chutes," which
sounded a lot like a compilation
of several singles.
But while "Wincing"
seems to have abandoned the
"juvenile" sound of "Chutes"
and "Oh. Inverted World" that
made those albums so great.
"Wincing" is far less whimsical

seems that ITic Shins felt that needed to make a "mature"
album and interpreted this to mean they need to make a "seri

ous" album, rather than a better album.
One thing that fortunately remains consistent between the
albums is the gorgeous lyrics The Shins have written. In "Spilt
Needles," the album's ninth song, we are treated with brilliant
lyrics like "I've done myself an impossible crime/Had to paint
myself a hole/And fall inside," and "It's like I'm pressed on the
handle bars/Of a blind man's bike/No straws to grab, just the
rushing wind."
The album starts off slowly with "Sleeping Lessons," which
gives lead singer James Mercer a chance to show off his vocal va
riety and range. He starts with a sleepy, low slightly harsh sound,
but as the song builds energy, his voice rises with the song's en
ergy and becomes a lush, near-falsetto sound.
The fourth song, "Phantom Limb" exemplifies the Shins's
"mature sound." It is a sleeper of a song, never moving too
fast, preferring the vocals and guitar to plod along toward the
end of the song. "Phantom Limb" and other songs like "Spilt
Needles" and "Sea Legs," are subtle, and sometimes border
on the mundane because of their relative lack of variety and
speed.
But there are some pretty good songs. "Red Rabbits" the
song that most resembles The Shins's previous work, is light and
unique: "We've pissed on far too many sprites/And they're all
standing upfor their rights." "Turn on Me" offers a melodic,
amusing and soft take on relationships and breakups: "You can
lake it for a while/Bite your tongue and smile/Like every moth
er does an ugly child."
For most artists, producing an album like "Wincing the Night
Away" would be an achievement, but for The Shins. "Wincing
is, sadly, a disappointment. It's still a good album, but it certain
ly isn't the kind of album that will turn many kids towards indie
rock.
