Nation's Giant Hamburgers
In 1952, Russ Harvey traded his car for a 10-foot wide roadside hotdog stand
in San Pablo with just six stools. And loyal fans of the local chain Nation's Giant
Hamburgers are sure glad that he did.
First called Harvey's, then Nation's, as Harvey and partner Dale Power be
lieved they served the best hamburgers in the nation. Nation's today has 24 Bay
Area locations and serves a whole lot more than hot dogs. Still, everything served

has one thing in common: It's giant. From
hot dogs and hamburgers to pancakes
and waffles to pies and cakes, the restau
rant prides itself on never skimping,
while still offering reasonable prices.
Nation's has quite the following with
in the Bay Area. Over the years, Nation's
has won "Best Hamburger" multiple
times from publications such as the Oak
land Tribune, the Tri-Valley Herald. Di
ablo Magazine and the Contra Costa
Times. Many Nation's locations sell t
shirts and other company memorabilia,
which proudly display Bay Area pride.
Nation's also has occasional television
and radio commercials with former Oak
land A's manager Ken Macha.
For giant portions of food at truly
miniature prices (and that awesome
19505-diner atmosphere), don't miss Na
tion's, a true Bay Area original. All loca
tions today proudly sport over six stools.

Dick's
For more than 50 years, Dick's Drive-In has
served the greater Seattle area with some of the best
food for a good old-fashioned coronary. Because of
their prime locations, the chain has never expanded
past its original five stores, preserving the look and
feel of a 1950s burger joint and all that goes with it.
I've been eating at Dick's since 1 was five years old
and in that time, they've only upped the prices a nick
el's worth and they've kept things just as delicious.
For less than five bucks, you can get a Dick's Deluxe
(scrumptious), a thing of fries (tasty) and a milkshake
(better than fornicatin'). Now. these aren't the Mc-
Crap versions of these fast food mainstays — the
Deluxe is made as you order it.the fries are freshly
cut from Idaho potatoes before your very eyes and
the milkshakes arc made from real ice cream.
If you can get past the teenage urge to giggle
at the name, Dick's delivers more bang for your buck
than any fast food chain. Be warned though: If you're
a picky cater, don't bother with Dick's because they
don't do the "have it your way" business — every
thing is made in bulk and the menu is fixed. It's part
of the place's charm, but if you want a burger with just
ketchup (gross) there's plenty of other sub-par burg
er places out there. But if you want delicious, trust the
golden wrapper of a Deluxe. Next time you're in the
Pacific Northwest, forget the smoked salmon or Star
bucks and mosey on down to Dick's and have your
self a true piece of Washington history.

Five Guvs Famous Burner and Fries
Mmm. That is all that Brendan has to say about Five Guys. This chain which now stretchcs
up and down the East Coast, originated outside of Washington, D.C. My local Five Guys, in
Georgetown, stays open until 1 a.m. on weekdays and 5 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. How can
you not love getting a burger at 4 a.m. after catching the red-eye home?
You can either sit at the bar (yes. they serve wine) or chomp on some peanuts while you wait
for your order. The food is make-as-you-want burgers — little, if you want one pattv — the lit
tle bacon cheeseburgers are killer. Fries come Cajun or Five-Guys style (regular) in either large
or regular. The large is a big soda cup filled with fries.
1 know that I don't have that much to say about Five Guys — it's just that good. But next time
you are in DC. It's worth the trip...no matter what time of night it is.
