## CARD LOOK TO TAME THE TITANS Baseball heads to Fullerton for season opener 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
The baseball team has been itch
ing to get back on the field since it
was eliminated by the now reigning
national champion Beavers in last
year's NCAA Super Regionals.
Today, the Cardinal will get its wish.
Baseball opens its season tonight at
No. 14 Cal State-Fullerton after hav
ing swept the Titans in last season's
opening series. The Cardinal experi
enced an up-and-down 2(X)6. finishing
11 -14 in the Pacific-10 Conference and
33-27 overall — narrowly making the
NCAA tournament before losing two
straight to the Beavers.

The Cardinal return just one sen
ior in outfielder Ryan Seawell, but
eight position players have started
more than 20 games. Perhaps the
most highly touted of the squad's re
turning players is junior preseason
All-American Michael Taylor, who
hit .325 with five home runs and 39
RBI. while anchoring the heart of
Stanford's lineup and playing right
field last season. For the second
straight season. Taylor has been
named to the Wallace Watch List.
(The Brooks Wallace Award is pre
sented annually to the college base
ball player of the year.)
"i don't look at it as too much
pressure: [the praise] is just some

outsiders' thoughts," Taylor said.
"Right now, I 'm just focused on team
goals and putting the best effort day
in and day-out for the team and for
the fans."
Seawell will join Taylor in center
field.The left-center job still has not
been decided.
ITie Cardinal also return junior
infielder Adam Sorgi, who sat out
last season due to injury. Sorgi hit
.322 with live homers and 41 RBI in
2(K)5 and looks to start at shortstop
this season. Due to last season's lay
off. Sorgi will most likely not start
this weekend.

Although the Cardinal finished strong in 2006, the squad's slow start nearly
doomed the team. Stanford will look to improve their early season play with a
win over last year's third-place Titans, tonight in Fullerfon, Calif.
"I've got the experience from my
sophomore and freshman year,"Sorgi
said. "I'm most excited to just get out
there on the field — I've never had a
year off in my life. As far as all the ad
justments go, winning for Stanford
baseball is the most important thing
right now."
The Cardinal's biggest question
mark this season could be the squad's
pitching. After losing Friday-night
pitcher Greg Reynolds to the first
round of the 2006 MLB First-Year
Player's draft. Stanford returns two
solid hurlers in junior right-hander
Nolan Gallagher and sophomore
southpaw Jeremy Bleich. The Cardi
nal will add freshman left-hander Jeff
Inman, who will start Saturday in
Fullerton.
Junior Brian Juhl will complete the
battery as the starting catcher. Juhl hit
.217 with a round-tripper and three
RBI last season. Sophomore Jason
Castro (.238 in 2(X)(i) will platoon at
first, sophomore Austin Yount (.139)
at second and junior Randy Molina
will play at third (.308).
Gallagher will match-up tonight
against 200h Co-National Player of
the Year Wes Romer, who earned a
2.38 ERA last season. Gallagher fin
ished 5-5 with a 3.99 ERA and a com
plete game in 2006.
After accumulating a 50-15 record
en route to the College World Series
last season, Fullerton returns just four

starting position players and one
pitcher in the prolific Roemer.
After meeting the Titans this
weekend, Stanford opens its home
schedule next week against Fresno
State.The Cardinal then travel to No.
4 Texas, a team its head coach Auggie
Garrido describes as one of his best in
years.
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess said that playing such a tough
early schedule on the road will come
in handy as the team tries to gauge its
talent level at the start of the season.
"[Fullerton] is very talented and
tough to beat at home, so playing
them will show us where we are as a
team." Marquess said. "After these
tough nine games, we'll know where
we need to improve. Otherwise, if you
play a lesser opponent, it may mis
serve (sic) you."
Taylor agreed with Marquess'
evaluation of the Titans.
"The tough environment will be
good for us to see where our team is."
Taylor said. "Sure, we're going to be
tested, but one of our team's biggest
strengths is our experience. Last
year's roller coaster ride gave us the
kind of experience we'll need for the
tough battles this season."
Tonight's first pitch is scheduled
for 7 p.m. in Fullerton.
