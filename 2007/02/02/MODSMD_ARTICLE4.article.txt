## CARD LOOK TO TAME THE TITANS Baseball heads to Fullerton for season opener 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
The baseball team has been itch
ing to get back on the field since it
was eliminated by the now reigning
national champion Beavers in last
year's NCAA Super Regionals.
Today, the Cardinal will get its wish.
Baseball opens its season tonight at
No. 14 Cal State-Fullerton after hav
ing swept the Titans in last season's
opening series. The Cardinal experi
enced an up-and-down 2(X)6. finishing
11 -14 in the Pacific-10 Conference and
33-27 overall â€” narrowly making the
NCAA tournament before losing two
straight to the Beavers.

The Cardinal return just one sen
ior in outfielder Ryan Seawell, but
eight position players have started
more than 20 games. Perhaps the
most highly touted of the squad's re
turning players is junior preseason
All-American Michael Taylor, who
hit .325 with five home runs and 39
RBI. while anchoring the heart of
Stanford's lineup and playing right
field last season. For the second
straight season. Taylor has been
named to the Wallace Watch List.
(The Brooks Wallace Award is pre
sented annually to the college base
ball player of the year.)
"i don't look at it as too much
pressure: [the praise] is just some

outsiders' thoughts," Taylor said.
"Right now, I 'm just focused on team
goals and putting the best effort day
in and day-out for the team and for
the fans."
Seawell will join Taylor in center
field.The left-center job still has not
been decided.
ITie Cardinal also return junior
infielder Adam Sorgi, who sat out
last season due to injury. Sorgi hit
.322 with live homers and 41 RBI in
2(K)5 and looks to start at shortstop
this season. Due to last season's lay
off. Sorgi will most likely not start
this weekend.

Although the Cardinal finished strong in 2006, the squad's slow start nearly
doomed the team. Stanford will look to improve their early season play with a
win over last year's third-place Titans, tonight in Fullerfon, Calif.
