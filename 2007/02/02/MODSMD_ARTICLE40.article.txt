## Buca offers a lof of food, not all of if good 
### ELIZABETH FOX INTERMISSION DINER 
"Quality, not quantity" is the catchphrase that was ham
mered into me as an impressionable fifth grader, but clearly
not into anyr neat Bucadi Beppo. The restaurant, part of a na
tional chain that's located here at 643 Emerson Street, pushes
quantity over all else. Sometimes it works, but sometimes, it
painfully does not.
All of this, however, came as a surprise. At first, it seemed
like the perfect place to me. 1 liked entering through the
kitchens, bombarded by smells of garlic and tomato. I liked
the idea of large portions served family-style to share among
everyone at the table. 1 even liked the kitschy decorations —
every wall covered with murals of tomatoes, colorful Christ
mas lights, and black-and-white photos of happy women, fat
dogs, and fat babies (which provide great fodder for jokes
about what one will look like post-dinner). The red-and-white
checked tablecloths and run-of-the-mill Italian music drifting
out of the speakers just added to the campy atmosphere. It
was all fun. and 1 and the nine friends that 1 had dragged along
with me were ready for it.
The food, however, didn't live up to the promise. It's not
that it was bad. but it certainly wasn't good. The apple gor
gonzola salad that we ordered, for example, a gargantuan serv
ing of lettuce, apple slices, cheese, and dried cranberries, came
mixed with walnuts so completely covered in cinnamon that
they turned us off the salad all together. Likewise, the chick
en glorioso that we ordered from the specials menu was mere

ly chicken smothered in cheese — anything hut glorious. The
eggplant parmesan seemed to consist mostly of breadcrumbs
and chunky tomato sauce, or at least, that's all one could taste.
The fettuccine alfredo also fell short, as merely cheesy pasta
without any subtly of taste. All were served in massive por
tions that landed at one end of the table and were served down
to the other. With the exception of the walnuts, nothing was
inedible, but no one would go beyond a halfhearted "fine"
when asked for opinions on these dishes.
There were a few highlights, though, that are worth point
ing out. The garlic bread that we ordered as an appetizer was
a standout. Large trays of soft, warm bread appeared on our
table, sprinkled lightly with parmesan and slivers of garlic.
The taste was delicious without the garlic being overwhelming,
so that I had no qualms about my breath as 1 talked to the per
son next to me.
The Margherita pizza was also a happy choice. It came on
a thin crust with slices of mozzarella, tomato, and basil, ac
companied by a container of "spicy pizza oil" that turned out
to be simply tasteless oil that we could pour on our pizza if we
so desired (why would we?). If the speed with which we ate
the garlic bread and the pizza can be seen as a measure of
how much we liked them, the Buca hit those two out of the
park.
Less impressive, though also good, was the fried calamari
that we ordered as our second appetizer. Though it hardly
lived up to the standard of the garlic bread, the pieces were soft
and chewy, and the sauce had the right amount of spice. There
were a few pieces that still looked like alarmingly like their oc-

topus origins, and I
would have liked

the dish to be a
little crispier,
but it was happi
lv demolished by

the majority of the
diners, and, later, in the

wake of the chicken glorioso, remem
bered fondly.
As we had one birthday girl in our

party, desserts were requisite. As
stuffed as we were, they were so
good that we ate nearly the entirety
of the huge portions in under ten

minutes. The double dark chocolate cake was the favorite —
rich, moist cake, layered with a lighter chocolate icing. The
chocolate vesuvio combined an enormous fudge brownie with
vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce, so good that we kept eat
ing it long after our stomachs felt like bursting. The home
made cheesecake with raspberry sauce was also a favorite,
light and fluffy. While it wasn't quite up to Cheesecake Facto
ry standards, our party's cheesecake connoisseur assured us
that it beat Stern dining's by a mile.
It was a good end to a mediocre meal, but as we waddled
out of the restaurant and away to the bus stop, it occurred to
me exactly how much we had eaten. Next time, I decided, we'd
order only the appetizers and desserts, and then, for good mea
sure, we'd walk home.
