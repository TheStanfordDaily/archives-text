# Stanford police: If only it existed
## 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN INTERMISSION FASHIONISTA 
In my short time here at Stanford. I've come to notice some
thing rather amusing about our highly ... err. eclectic and in
tellectual student body.
Most of us don't give a rat's ass about how we look.
Ah. priorities. It does seem preposterous to choose an af
ternoon adventure of shopping and other fancy things (yes. I
am aware of the fine, fine selection of boutiques and parlors we
have here on campus — the Stanford Bookstore, and again the
Stanford Bookstore, and somewhere far off, maybe Stanford
Mall? I think? Maybe? You learn to make do!) over a physics
problem set. Preposterous! 1 low could 1 suggest such a thing?

Easily, I tell you. Very easily. Sometimes I wish there were re
ally such a thing as the Fashion Police ... because bad dress

is nothing less than murder to the eyes.
Granted, even the least nerdy of us can't be expect

Ed to be perusing Melrose (don't be embarrassed if

you don't know what Melrose is. It's okay. Mel
rose is one of Los Angeles' most popular shop
ping districts), all over the latest trends the very

nanosecond each comes off the runway. We don't '
have time for that kind of child's play! We've got to treat

AIDS in Haiti, developing cures for cancer and just plain
saving-the-world to do. But we're all overachievers. So let's
multitask and do all of it in stvle.

It only makes sense to start from the bottom up. so I'll begin
by addressing the most heinous fashion crimes 1 have seen com
mitted here at the Farm, and gradually advance up the ladder
■ mmmm m Mm wmmam mmaam mamma ammmm mmgarnm amamm

of Stanford style.
The HAVE-ALWAYS-BEEN-AND-ALWAYS-WILL-BE
OUT Fashions
High-waters: Defined by Urban Dictionary as "Pants that
are unintentionally short in the hem. You can wear them in a
Hood and they won't get wet (hence the name)." Hands down,
the most universally stupid-looking article of clothing ever seen
in the history of man. And they just won't go away. Though a
solution seems to be in the works. When I told my deliciously
evil roommate that "high-waters" were on my list of "out" fash-

ions, she said. "1 used to make fun of pco
i pie who wore high waters. I would point

■and them and be like, 'Hey where's the
flood?'" She paused briefly for an evil

> snicker. "And they would never wear them
again." "Genius," I thought. If only I could

pull out a heartless commentator every time 1

saw someone wearing a pair of high-waters.

Sandals with socks (and exposed socks when
they aren't supposed to be exposed in general):
Blame it on laziness, if you want to, but there is
no valid excuse to leaving the dorm wearing both
i socks and sandals.

Crocs: I've never seen these shoes that they
call "Crocs." But my roommates tell me they
are quite pervasive at Stanford and in the
L world overall, and thev are heinous. Any-

thing that is described as "those shoes with

the holes in them" is, well, heinous to me. Stop wearing them.
The OUT-AND-NOT-RETURNING-ANYTIME-SOON
Fashions
Platform shoes: In the world of fashion, there are two reme
dies that exist for girls who are vertically challenged and wish
remedy that: platforms and high heels. Some girls, for whatev
er reason, don't like high heels, and instead prefer weird things
that look like regular sandals hut arc really three inches thick in
the sole. These contraptions are quite aesthetically displeasing.
If we could just leave platforms in the decade they were born, it
would be wonderful.
White pants: Apart from the fashion-related reasons no self
respecting male should ever wear white pants — there are
some major practicality issues here. What if it has just rained
and a biker rides through a puddle right next to you. splashing
you with rainwater and perhaps ruining your white pants for
ever? What if you sit in poo? What if you sit in poo and are in a
rush to your next class, resulting in unchanged poo pants and
ridicule galore? White pants are just a horrible, horrible idea.
The OUT-BUT-IN-AT-SOME-POINT-IN-TIME Fashions
Pants that are too large: While once thought to be uncon
ventionally adorable in that unpolished, reckless kind of way or
smokin' in that badass, I-don't-want-my-pants-to-fit-because
rd-have-no-placc-to-put-mv-shank kind of way. general opin-

ion has finally come to senses and realized intentionally large pants are
nearly as stupid as intentionally short pants (alluded to earlier). The only
reason they have not quite reached that apex of stupidity is the existence
of people like Jay-Z, who have so much damn clout they could wear
panties outside of their pants and not look stupid. But you are not Jay-Z.

Miniskirts and Ugg boots (scarf optional): When there are numer
ous Facebook groups (some with separate chapters) devoted to making fun of how utterly stupid some
thing is, you bet your ass it is stupid. The creator of the Stanford Chapter of the "Anti Uggs with Mini
Skirts Group" put it best when he said: "If it's cold enough to wear the shoes, it's cold enough for some
pants. A long skirt at least. Common sense people..."
Popped collar (doubly heinous if there are two of them): Was it the Abercrombie and Fitch models
who made this look famous? Let's be honest here. With those chiseled abs and pecs that rival Calvin
Klein models and bone structure so perfect as to make girls jealous, those guys could pull off any look
(much like Jay-Z. alluded to above). You cannot. But we'll just pretend you got your collared shirt con
fused with your turtleneck sweater.
The YOU-CANT-GO-WRONG-WITH-THESE (SEMI-IN) Fashions
Stanford Paraphernalia: Not so much the article of clothing or accessory that is in. but the message
conveyed: 1 am smarter than you. My school is better than yours (unless you are among Princeton. Yale
or Harvard paraphernalia wearers, in which case this is still true, but arguable). Ha.
The YOU-CANT-POSSIBLY-BE-THAT-SMART-AISD-THAT-WELL-DRESSEI) Fashions
The Skinny Jean: Kate Moss isn't the only one who can pull these off. You know, her legs look that
skinny because of her jeans.
The Big Purse (females only): So practical. Mine fits my laptop, a notebook, camera, cell phone, wal
let, keys... the list goes on.
Layers: Cold? Work in the layers.
Vintage Tees and Hoodies: Nothing spells 1-rolled-out-of-bed-looking-this-good like a vintage tee
and a hoody.
If you haven't done so already, you are now free to go into your closet and throw out (or donate) any
and all of the articles of clothing "out' Misted here. And please, I may be pushing it a little, but if you don't
have time for silly adventures to the mall, there is a vast, vast virtual mall just a few clicks away. You know
where to find it. Start clicking.
