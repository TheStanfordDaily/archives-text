# Stanford police: If only it existed
## 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN INTERMISSION FASHIONISTA 
In my short time here at Stanford. I've come to notice some
thing rather amusing about our highly ... err. eclectic and in
tellectual student body.
Most of us don't give a rat's ass about how we look.
Ah. priorities. It does seem preposterous to choose an af
ternoon adventure of shopping and other fancy things (yes. I
am aware of the fine, fine selection of boutiques and parlors we
have here on campus — the Stanford Bookstore, and again the
Stanford Bookstore, and somewhere far off, maybe Stanford
Mall? I think? Maybe? You learn to make do!) over a physics
problem set. Preposterous! 1 low could 1 suggest such a thing?

Easily, I tell you. Very easily. Sometimes I wish there were re
ally such a thing as the Fashion Police ... because bad dress

is nothing less than murder to the eyes.
Granted, even the least nerdy of us can't be expect

Ed to be perusing Melrose (don't be embarrassed if

you don't know what Melrose is. It's okay. Mel
rose is one of Los Angeles' most popular shop
ping districts), all over the latest trends the very

nanosecond each comes off the runway. We don't '
have time for that kind of child's play! We've got to treat

AIDS in Haiti, developing cures for cancer and just plain
saving-the-world to do. But we're all overachievers. So let's
multitask and do all of it in stvle.

It only makes sense to start from the bottom up. so I'll begin
by addressing the most heinous fashion crimes 1 have seen com
mitted here at the Farm, and gradually advance up the ladder

of Stanford style.
The HAVE-ALWAYS-BEEN-AND-ALWAYS-WILL-BE
OUT Fashions
High-waters: Defined by Urban Dictionary as "Pants that
are unintentionally short in the hem. You can wear them in a
Hood and they won't get wet (hence the name)." Hands down,
the most universally stupid-looking article of clothing ever seen
in the history of man. And they just won't go away. Though a
solution seems to be in the works. When I told my deliciously
evil roommate that "high-waters" were on my list of "out" fash-

ions, she said. "1 used to make fun of pco
i pie who wore high waters. I would point

■and them and be like, 'Hey where's the
flood?'" She paused briefly for an evil

> snicker. "And they would never wear them
again." "Genius," I thought. If only I could

pull out a heartless commentator every time 1

saw someone wearing a pair of high-waters.

Sandals with socks (and exposed socks when
they aren't supposed to be exposed in general):
Blame it on laziness, if you want to, but there is
no valid excuse to leaving the dorm wearing both
i socks and sandals.

Crocs: I've never seen these shoes that they
call "Crocs." But my roommates tell me they
are quite pervasive at Stanford and in the
L world overall, and thev are heinous. Any-

thing that is described as "those shoes with

the holes in them" is, well, heinous to me. Stop wearing them.
The OUT-AND-NOT-RETURNING-ANYTIME-SOON
Fashions
Platform shoes: In the world of fashion, there are two reme
dies that exist for girls who are vertically challenged and wish
remedy that: platforms and high heels. Some girls, for whatev
er reason, don't like high heels, and instead prefer weird things
that look like regular sandals hut arc really three inches thick in
the sole. These contraptions are quite aesthetically displeasing.
If we could just leave platforms in the decade they were born, it
would be wonderful.
White pants: Apart from the fashion-related reasons no self
respecting male should ever wear white pants — there are
some major practicality issues here. What if it has just rained
and a biker rides through a puddle right next to you. splashing
you with rainwater and perhaps ruining your white pants for
ever? What if you sit in poo? What if you sit in poo and are in a
rush to your next class, resulting in unchanged poo pants and
ridicule galore? White pants are just a horrible, horrible idea.
The OUT-BUT-IN-AT-SOME-POINT-IN-TIME Fashions
Pants that are too large: While once thought to be uncon
ventionally adorable in that unpolished, reckless kind of way or
smokin' in that badass, I-don't-want-my-pants-to-fit-because
rd-have-no-placc-to-put-mv-shank kind of way. general opin-
