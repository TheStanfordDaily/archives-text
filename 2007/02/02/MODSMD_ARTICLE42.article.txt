## Berkeley's 'Pillowman' morbid, intriguing 
### CLEA ALSIP INTERMISSION DRAMA QUEEN 
Get excited to go off campus and see some theater! We
Stanford students have so much at our disposal. There are
various very well-known and amazing professional theater
companies within an hour's drive,from our campus, and
very few (if any) of us ever take the time to even look into
them. Well, if any of you at all desire to start any time soon,
the Berkeley Repertory Theater's production of "The Pil
lowman" is playing until March 11 in Berkeley. (Yes I
know, it's Berkeley, but you should definitely still go!)
Martin McDonagh's "The Pillowman," currently being
produced by the Berkeley Repertory Theater, tells a dark
tale of an unknown authoritarian dictatorship and a writer
whose morbid stories haunt all who hear them. The play is
a light-hearted horror show, causing its audience to laugh
£nd giggle one moment but gasp in horror and disbelief in
the next. The show is extremely morbid, shocking and in
parts grotesque, yet also moving and engrossing.
The play tells the story of Katurian (Erik Lochtefeld, in
a noteworthy performance), a writer on trial for the myste
rious and creative murders of several local children — mur

ders that take place very similarly to nar
ratives in some of his odd and horrific sto
ries . . . stories described in the play as
how-to guides of "101 ways to skewer a
five-year old." Yet the trial is behind
closed doors with no real court or judge
and it is up to Detective Tupolski (Tony
Amendola, performing at a first-class
level) and his side kick, bad-cop Ariel
(Andy Murray), to solve the crime
through brains as well as brute and forced
confessions.
More than just focusing on the murdei
and mystery, the story deals with broadei
themes of protecting ones life's work and
allowing what you leave behind to mean
the most. McDonagh imbues the piece
with a sense of the elevated influence arl
has in our world and how this can be seer
as a threat in authoritarian regimes where
personal freedoms are squandered.
The set design by Antje Ellermann did

much to comple
ment the timeless
ness of the piece as
well as provide an
innovative differ
entiation from the
all-black and much
more nightmarish
set of the 2005
Broadway produc
tion: While on
Broadway, the
show was extreme
ly well reviewed
and widely accept
ed. It was filled
with an amazing
cast including Billy
Crudup and Jeff
Goldblum. In its
run in 2005, "The
Pillowman" was
nominated for five
Tony Awards, in
cluding best play
and best actor
(Crudup in the role,
of Katurian) and
won two of them:

best lighting and best scenic design in
a play.
The show's music and sound is
incredible and adds to the mood and
suspense of the plot tremendously.
Berkeley Repertory was lucky
enough to have Obadiah Eaves, the
man who created the music for the
Broadway production, with them on
their own presentation of McDon

agh's play.
Berkeley Repertory's production may not have the
names or the media attraction that the 2005 Broadway pro
duction did. but it is still a very admirable representation of
McDonagh's play, with a talented cast that skillfully and
cleverly portray their characters, making the audience be
lieve they are actual witnesses to this parallel universe. Go
for the screams, go for the laughs, go for the gasps or just go
to get off campus for a night and see some really good and
innovative theater.
