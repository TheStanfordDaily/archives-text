## Roxy Sass on hook-ups and hardware 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION IN 'N' OUT GODDESS 
It's the In 'n' Out Issue, and you all know what Roxy's
thinking. So many sexual innuendos, so little time! A sex
columnist's paradise. Never fear, dear reader, for all-know
ing, all-boning Roxy will reveal more than one this week. But i
first, Roxy's gonna take a walk on the serious side of sassy. '
, Read on for a bit of Roxy you've never seen before. And
I that's saying something. ....

The phrase "in and out" very much describes today's
I hook-up culture. But is that really an "issue" or just a harmless
I trend? Based on the following quotes from Roxy's sexalicious
[ sources, you can decide for yourself. Roxy spoke separately to Jerk
off Jack and Jilted Jill — real Stanford students, she swears!

/Jack: "Last night I hooked up with Jill, and it was incredi
ble. She did everything I asked her to do, moaning and scream
ing like she enjoyed it, too. I can't wait to tap that again."
Jill: "Jack is the sweetest guv I've ever met! I

112 think we have a real emotional connectio
112 and I'm looking forward to taking our rela
tionship to the next level."

Next, Rbxy talked with Gawky Gus and
Sexy Sue. i

Gus: "At first I was terribly nervous around Y
Sue, but last night we both let go of our inhibi- \
tions, and it felt amazing. I'm looking for her right A
now to talk about where this is going.
Sue: "I was so drunk last night, I don't even remem
ber what happened."

It is in these 100 percent true exaggerations, or \
maybe understatements, that hooking up becomes a \
problem. And we've all seen it before. If, like Roxy, you \
can approach a hook-up with absolutely no expectations, \
have a blast for one night and move on baggage-free, then ]L
you won't have any trouble. The problem is, not everyone is \
like that. And the cultural phenomenon of in-and-out sexual
relationships thus becomes an issue for society as a whole —
and our campus in particular. (Although not as much of an issue

as at, say, Duke.) \
In a way, Roxy is glad because it leaves more ass to be had at \
Stanford by her and her compatriots, paradoxically capable of both *
indulging as well as displaying self-control. But she worries for her

Jr more emotional friends and part-
/ ners. Many, many partners. How many peo- \
pie has Roxy hurt? If you choose to hook up, Roxy \
says, try to be sure you and your partner have compati- \
ble expectations. \
But enough serious stuff. A second sexual innuendo of this \
week's I-mission theme involves penis size. Listen up, boys. Do \
you have that pesky problem where you simply can't get your \
Johnny-wobbler to keep his um, "head" in the warm, tight game? \ .
Otherwise known as the size-doesn't-matter-except-in-my-case prob- \
lem? Roxy is sure glad you decided to read her column today. Are you
suddenly wondering why your smirking friend insisted that you read it?
There are several sex positions that work well for the slightly less well
endowed — namely, ones that maximize penetration. These include modi
fied missionary (you're on top but with her legs over your shoulders)
and any number of rear-entry positions. Girls, if you can flex your
pelvic floor (or PC) muscles, this will be even more effective. Just one
warning: THis can flatter your ass to such a degree that he just hauls
\ off and smacks it. More on that next week.

V In the end, however, self-confidence about penis size is key.
\ And, another important thing to keep in mind is that most girls
V are more annoyed by huge penises than they are ever disap
-1 pointed by small ones. Imagine having stretch marks around your
Jr mouth. Eww, Roxy says.
/ Finally, the last sexual innuendo Roxy will reveal to you today
/ would be better stated as the in and out and in and out and in and out
\ and in and out issue. Get the picture?
Acclaimed sexologist Yxor Ssas says, "Rapid and repeated jackham
mer thrusts lead to swift male orgasm and a subsequent unavoidable in
\ terruption in the festivities." In other words, boys, occasionally stop to
smell the, um, roses. After all, it's about the journey, not the destination.
Our friend Jilted Jill agrees: "The only thing Jack *scream* did *sigh*
Jrihat I *moan* didn't *shriek* like was thrust like Emasculitis was about to set
-inn. I would have *mmm* preferred a little more emasCuLlTis action."
/You can't get much more expiCLIT than that. Roxy over and (in and) out.
