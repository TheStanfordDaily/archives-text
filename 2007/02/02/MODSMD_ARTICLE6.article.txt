# Afroman party nixed
## OSA cites security concerns, forces Sigma Nu to cancel tonight's scheduled event 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There were supposed to he hun
dreds of people enjoying them
selves ;it Sigma Nil tonight, listen
ing, singing and dancing to the beats
of acclaimed rap artist Afroman,fa
mous for his hit 2001 single "Be
cause 1 Clot I ligh."
ITiat was until the Office of Stu
dent Activities (OSA) cancelled
the event earlier this week, citing
security concerns raised by the pos
sibility of large numbers of unwel
come. off-campus guests.
The University's decision has
frustrated some students, who say
the cancellation is an overreaction.
OSA's decision to call off the

party came down to a technicality.
Sigma Nu originally registered the
Afroman appearance as a level
three party, typical for an affair that
would bring people from all over
campus. Soon after, however. OSA
reclassified it as a level four party
— signifying it as an event open to
the public — when the bash was ad
vertised off-campus.To be permissi
ble, level four parties must be regis
tered earlier than level three parties
in order to address additional secu
rity concerns. As a result. OSA
forced Sigma Nu to cancel the
event.
Speaking on behalf of Sigma Nu.
Dave Ryan '07. former president of
the fraternity and a planner of the
party, said that OSA's fears stemmed
from a one-line notation on Afro
man's Web site. http://wwwafroman
music.com, which said the rapper
would be performing .it Stanford
tonight.
"OSA cancelled the party be
cause it had been advertised off-cam
pus, which made it a level four party."
he said. "Afroman advertised it on
his Web site, under his touring sched
ule."
''We told Afroman's agent from
day one that there couldn't be any
advertising, that it there was any ad
vertising, the party would be can
celled," he added. "We felt like we
were really clear. At the same time,
we were talking to his agent, and who
knows who runs the Web site? There
was probably a mistake somewhere."
Lynn Santopietro. assistant direc
tor of OSA. said that her office re
quires at least one month advance
notice for all level four parties. Level
three parties, by contrast, require
only 14 days notification.

"In the case of Sigma Nu, the no
tification was not submitted by the
required deadlines for what was a
large-scale and broadly publicized
party," she said. "After review, the
University could not allow the party
to proceed, as there was not ade
quate time to address party needs.
The recommendation was made for
the party to be postponed to a later
date.
According to Ryan, OSA contact
ed the fraternity last Friday with its
concerns. Although Sigma Nu at
tempted to bargain, offering to hire
more security personnel, the frater
nity could not sway OSA.
"It's a legitimate concern from
the OSA." Ryan said. "No other fra
ternity has brought a known artist to
a party where there's already a lot of
alcohol and security concerns."
Lindsay Schauer*o7,an RA at 680
Lomita, expressed support for OSA.
"It's a shame that this party had to
be cancelled, but given the nature of
our housing here, that makes sense,"
she said. "They have all these rules

for a reason, and they're for our own
safety. When information about a
party or an event on campus is
leaked to surrounding people, you're
kind of asking for a security issue."
Erik Lee '08. a social manager at
Phi Kappa Psi. offered a different
perspective, saying that he felt the
party could have gone ahead if
Sigma Nu's story is accurate.
"1 don't see how they could have
anticipated that [Afroman] was
going to publicize that," he said. "1
know that when we hire acts, we
don't specifically tell them. 'Don't
tell anyone else that you're coming.'
1 sort of see where OS A is coming
from, but from [Sigma Nu's] end. if
they only advertised on campus and
they had security to make sure that
only students were allowed at the
party, that would be a level three."
Afroman's agent. William Mess
er. could not be reached for com
ment.
