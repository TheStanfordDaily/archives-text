# RESIDENTIAL EDUCATION
## RA application to include early option 
### JENNIFER LIU SENIORS STAFF WRITER 
Early decision is no longer limited
to college admissions.
Residential Education intro
duced a new Early Decision applica
tion earlier this quarter designed to
streamline the Resident Assistant
(RA) and College Assistant (C'A) se
lection process. Geared toward can
didates with tics to a particular house
or a prior relationship with a Resi
dent Fellow (RE) or College Direc
tor (CD), the new application offers
a binding option that allows students
to apply early to a single house.
"In the regular selection process,
a lot of applicants don't know where
they want to he." said Josh Schiller.
'97. associate director of Residential

Education. "It's often through the
interview process that applicants
and Resident Fellows or College
Directors determine the best
match."
The new Early Decision process
is designed for applicants who know
exactly where they want to be. De
veloped in part because of input
from RFs and CDs, the selection
process is intended to place "one-on
one matches" in houses that have
opted to participate in the new pro
gram.
As in the college admissions pro
grams of the same name, students
who receive Early Decision offers,
which will he made on a rolling basis
beginning on Feb. 22. must either ac
cept the offer or give up their eligibili
ty for any other RA or CA position.
Students who do not receive an offer
will he able to edit and submit their
applications for consideration in the
Regular Spring selection process, for
which job offers will be released on
May 3.
The new process is expected to
eliminate some of the stress that ac
companies multiple rounds of inter
views with candidates who have ap
plied to more than one house. Patrick
Young, an Rl in West Florence
Moore Hall, said in an email to The
Daily that he receives as many as 120
RA applications for 11 positions each
year. I le estimates that he spends ap
proximately 30 hours interviewing
RA candidates during the Regular
Spring selection process, and approx
imately 60 to 80 hours total interview
ing all dorm stall applicants.
"The problem with the current
system is that many of my 120 RA ap

plicants have no intention of coming
to West Flo." he said. "Many appli
cants have a specific dorm or dorm
complex in mind, but interview at the
maximum allowable number of
dorms in order to have backup choic
es. The hope is that the new system
will remove the one-to-one matches
[from the regular application
process], lb at means less work for the
candidate and less work for the Rl s."
However, Schiller stressed that
applicants who are unsure of their
preferences should apply through ci
ther the Regular Spring process or
the Away Spring application process
— available for students who will be
abroad for spring quarter — and
that students who choose not to
apply through the Early Decision
process will not be disadvantaged in
any way.
All RA and C'A applicants sub
mit the same materials and partici
pate in the interview process. In ad
dition, each participating house is re
quired to limit the number of posi
tions they fill through Early Deci
sion and to keep open RA and CA
positions for both women and men
for the Regular Spring and Away

Spring cycles.
"The main thing we want to em
phasize is that there will still be posi
tions available after Early Decision,"
Schiller said. "[The new process] is for
people who know without a doubt
what house they want to be in."
Rose Reidy,*o7,a Paloma RA and
former Paloma HPAC who lived
there during her freshman year, said
that Paloma was her first choice when
she was applying for a dorm staff po
sition. However.she added that appli
cants should only apply through the
Early Decision process if they are
positive they know where they want
to staff.
"I was definitely drawn to Paloma,
but I wanted to use the interview
process as a time to survey the other
dorms." Rcidy wrote in an email to
The Daily.'i needed to check out the
other options before I committed.
I've been extremely happy in Paloma.
but I'm glad I had a chance to get a
feel for how other dorms are run and
how other staff members interact
with their Rls. Sometimes it's good to
remember that not all dorms operate
in the same way."
Rishan Mohamed. '08, who plans
to apply to the Away Spring selection
process, agreed.
"Early Decision is an interesting
idea, but it's not for me." he wrote in
an email to The Daily. "There are
multiple residences where I would
like to staff."
The Early Decision application is
being implemented on a trial basis
this year and will be closely evaluated
by Rl s, CDs and participating appli
cants.
"It's not guaranteed that we'll be
keeping this process, just that we're
testing it out." Schiller said. "We're
committed to keeping the Early De
cision process fair and open to every
one and making sure that this isn't
something that would disadvantage
anyone if they didn't participate."
Young also said that he would be
looking out for what he called the
"risks" in the Early Decision process.
"In particular, 1 am concerned with
creating a perception of two tiers on
my new staff: those who were hired
through Early Decision and those
hired during the regular process," he
said. "I expect it will take several
years for us to fine tune the new
Early Decision process. Ultimately,
however. 1 am hopeful it will lead to a
better hiring experience both for RA
candidates and for the staff hiring
them."
Application materials for the Early
Decision RA and C'A process are due
on Feb. 13. More information and appli
cation materials are available at
