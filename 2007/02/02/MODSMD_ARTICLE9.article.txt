Admissions office, ethnic groups find common ground
Feb. 2.1988: "Campus minorities and tho University admis
sions office blame lack of communication for much of last
week's tension between the groups concerning minority re
cruitment, and although disagreements still exist, the parties
concur on several issues, officials from both sides said.
"At a forum of campus minority leaders at Otero House last
Tuesday, representatives from the Asian American Student
Association. El Centro Chicano,The Studonford American
Indian Organization and the Black Student Union criticized
as inadequate the admissions office's efforts to recruit mi
nority students.
"Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Joan Fetter defended
her office in a letter in yesterday's Daily:' Some gross misstate
ments have impugned tho efforts and credibility of tho admis
sions staff and have contributed to further the misperceptions
about our efforts towards minority recruitment,' Fetter wrote."

Feb 3.l9B6:"Fliers demanding a boycott of the formerly stu
dent-run Coffee House flooded the campus last quarter and
cries of protest were head when Saga Corp. took control, but
the Coffee House has not been seriously affected, according
to employees.
"During fall quarter/Business was down because of the boy
cott.. Now. it's up and as good as last winter quarter, maybe
better...Saga is doing a pretty good job.* said Maria Botte, a
student manager at the Coffee House.

group of students last quarter began the Espresso Bar, an al
