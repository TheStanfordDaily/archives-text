# Touchdowns, fumbles of Super Bowl XLI ads
## 
### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION CRITIC FORMERLY KNOWN AS PRINCE 
BEST:
Kud Lite
liud I .ite's overall ad campaign was
the strongest in general this year.
Featuring laugh grabbers like
"Slap-a-round,""Rock, Paper. Scis
sors.' "Great Apes" and "Auction
eer Wedding," Hud Lite was the
only consistently funny ad series of
the Super Bowl. It once again
proves that the guys in Budweiser

advertising can still come up with
something funny after all these
years.
Fmerald !Nuts — Robert (ioulet
Watching Goulet play pranks on
dozing office workers as he tap
danced across their desks was
nothing short of genius. And I'm
sorry, but if you didn't laugh at
Robert Goulet slinking away on
the ceiling at the end of the spot
there is a good chance that you
have no soul. Bravo to Emerald
Nuts for putting up the money not
only for a Super Bowl spot but

also for Robert Goulet — it came
away with a hysterical commer
cial.
Tostitos/Coca-Cola
It was only expected that the first
appearance of African-American
coaches in the big game would also
generate ads talking about it. I low
ever. despite immense room for
error and poor taste, both Tostitos
and Coke came away with very
tasteful, appropriate and well
made commercials honoring the
achievements of coaches Tony
Dungy and l .ovie Smith.

E*Trade — Things You Can Do
Willi One Finger
An amusing spot featuring, as the
title suggests, a plethora of things
you can do with one finger, aside
from e-trading of course. Notable
achievements included "declaring
your team's supremacy,""getting to
know your doctor" and "saving
I lolland."
Nationwide Insurance — k.Fcd
It's nice to know that at least he
isn't oblivious to how big of a joke
