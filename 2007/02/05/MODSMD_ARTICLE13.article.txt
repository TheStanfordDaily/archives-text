### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION FOOTTAPPER 
Sanskriti. Stanford's undergrad
uate South Asian organization pre
sented Rhythms, an assemblage of
13 Stanford performing arts groups
last Friday. February 2. in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
Tickets were rather expensive
for ;i student performance,with pre
sale tickets costing $ ( ) and those at
the door running for $12. Moreover,
the the $5 from each ticket, howev
er. went to Face AIDS, an inter-col
legiate student campaign started by
three Stanford students in order to
help raise awareness and funds for
those suffering from HIV and
AIDS m Africa. In fact,the five dol
lars from each ticket generated $15
from face AIDS' matching part
ners. further helping the group to
achieve its $1 million goal.
Ilie all-male Raagapclla group
opened the performance with some
always entertaining boy-choreogra
phy. They were followed by a brief
explanation from one of Face
AIDS' founders about the perfor
mance's cause and an introduction
by the emcees.The show roared to a
start with a performance by the al
ways impressive Taiko and an in
tense, incredibly visceral homage to
the Japanese sun goddess. As the
drummers built from softer thumps
to full-body blows, the drums' vibra
tions thundered through the room
even situated in the back. I felt
the vibrations quite literally rumble
through my heart. Ihe all-female
Noopur dance group. Stanford's
classical Indian dance troupe, fol
lowed with a softer piece, sporting
perhaps the most beautiful and

vividly colored costumes of the SI
night. The soft hushing ol their 1
ankle hells created an enchanting
rhythm all to itself in addition to
their music. Urban Style, arguably
the best modern dance troupe on
campus.continued the show with an
incredibly dynamic jazz piece that
modulated from fast to slow and
fast again. The powerhouse of a
capella, Talisman, performed three
beautiful stings, each one proving
why they are largely considered the
best singing group on campus. The
first half of the show ended with the
Hindi Film Dance Team, which was
incredibly entertaining with its
wonderfully over-the-top, pre
recorded dialogue and super-high
energy dance numbers.
After intermission, two new em
cees graced the stage, introducing
the first act. The Filipino Folk
Dance Troupe, impressed the audi
ence with its light-footed, stick
hopping piece, although I couldn't
help from imagining someone's
foot getting squished in between
their clacking sticks. Alliance
Streetdance provided a taste of the
contemporary, sampling from
Nelly Furtado and Justin, and
Everyday People sang three fan
tastic songs, including their closing
number "Papa Was a Rolling
Stone." The belly-dancers of
Arabesque were sultry, sensual and
incredibly sexy; they left me won
dering how hips can be moved in so
many different directions. Next up
were The Stanford Steppers, who
were superb Their moves were ex
ceedingly creative- I have never
thought there were so many ways
to clap and stomp â€” not to their
mention eerily adept imitating of

robots Kuumba. Stanford's
African Dance and Drum Ensem
ble, performed a wonderful, very
tribal dance number, markedly dif
ferent from any other style seen be
fore in the show. Lastly, Stanford's
Bhangra Team (bhangra is an ener
getic Punjabi dance form), ended
the show with music so catchy you
had to tap your foot and dancing so
enthusiastic you wanted to join the
team yourself.

Rhythms was a wonderful collec
tion of some of Stanford's best per
forming arts groups, many of which 1
had never seen or heard before. Al
though 1 was sometimes uncertain
why certain non-South Asian groups
were invited and others were not, the

13 groups that performed at
Rhythms were a pleasure to watch. It
the emcees would have introduced
each act more quickly and concisely,
the three-hour show could have
been a more manageable length. But
despite its long run.the show helped
fund a wonderful on-campus organi
zation. brought a broad swath of
vastly different student performing
groups onto one stage, and, above
all. was absolutely and entirely en
tertaining.
