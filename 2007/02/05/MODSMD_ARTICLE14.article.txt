# Happy Birthday to me
## 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION BIRTHDAY BOY 
Saturday was the big, dreaded 2-0
and the end of teenagerdom for the
rest of my life. Terrifying, indeed. A
playlist full of comforting and vaguely
birthday-themed songs was in order
for my weekend, which was certainly
full of more reading and applications
than any newly-minted adult should
have been forced to do.
1.50 Cent, in Da Club" —Not only do
1 not need to pretend it's my birthday,
but I'm short. As a result, this song
perfectly describes how 1 wish 1 could
have spent my entire birthday, if not
for all the work 1 had to. Same place
next year, Fitty.
2. Architecture in Helsinki. "Maybe
You Can Owe Me" — Although I had
a nice weekend, early February seems
a bad time to have one's birthday, with
the approaching prospect of midterms and
the realization that one has to write reading
responses.
3. Stars, "Celebration Guns"— Internship
applications over? Time to celebrate by
metaphorically firing guns into the air. and
hoping you don't hit anyone, either with bul
lets or your trendy indie pretensions.
4. Thorn Yorke, "A Rat's Nest"— There
seems to be a correlation between the

amount of work one has, and the state of
one's room. The dark, somber mood of the
song perfectly sums up one's complete lack
of desire to clean.
5. Minus The Bear. "Monkey!!! Knife!!!
Fight!!!"— Despite the extremely exciting
title, this song is not that thrilling. That
being said, it reflects the mood of a quiet,
busy weekend relatively well, minus the
knife-wielding monkeys fighting each
other.
6. Justin Timberlake & Timbaland, "Summer
Love/Set the Mood Prelude" — 1 think it's a
true statement that those that have their
birthdays in the middle of winter quarter are
jealous of those who have their birthdays in

summer, or at least, fall quarter.
7. Philip Glass, "I'm Going to Bake a Cake
[The Hours Soundtrack]" — I was consider
ing baking a cake, actually, but the limitations
of my own laziness and a dorm un-open
kitchen prevented that. So 1 baked cookies
instead.
8. Deerhoof, "Giga Dance" — 1 don't think
anyone really knows what this song is about,
and neither do I. Yet, I can't stop listening to
its clanging guitars, high-altitude vocals and
rapid shifts in pace.
9. Be Your Own Pet, "Adventure"— This
sums up mine and many readers' sentiments
this weekend, "We are adventuring! We are
adventurers!" If only.
