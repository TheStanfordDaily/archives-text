# When Pies Attack: A Night at the 2007 Pumpkin Pie Film Festival
## 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION PIE EATER 
Every year, a group of ragtag film
makers go through an intense hoot
camp called the Advance Film Work
shop/Phis gauntlet of filmic tasks chisels
a rough familiarity with film production
into a diamond-edged knowledge of the
process. Countless hours spent both in
front of and behind the camera culmi
nates in the AFW's finest moment —
the Pumpkin Pie Film Festival.
Sponsored by the Stanford Film So
ciety, the Pumpkin Pie Film Festival al
lows students to flex their cinematic
muscle in a series of short films. ITiis
year's theme was "Outside the Box" and
each director had to innovatively come
up with solutions to this quirky concept.
A variety of styles, from the hyper-com
mercialized gangster experimental to a
conceptual look at the aesthetic of jani
torial art, came through in six films.
Annenberg Auditorium was packed
to the rafters with an audience rowdy
and excited to see some student films —
or perhaps just to see their friends up on
the silver screen. That kind of excite
ment was reflected in the films made by
the students.The aforementioned films,
titled "The Job" (Dir. Matt Monahan)
and "Daily" (Dir. Ben Henretig) were
not the only films exhibited that showed

oft'some ripening student potential.The
other films ineluded "Storage USA"
(Dir. Michael Zeligs), a introspective
look at the nature of The Man: "Just
Desserts" (Dir. Cole Paulson), a
macabre look at roommate conflicts;
"Gopher Village" (Dir. Doug Blumey
er), a drug fueled ninja fight with trippy
visuals: and"The Christmas Party" (Dir.
Teresa Ingram), a film about childhood
wish fulfillment at a hierarchical office
party.
Csver all, the evening with filled with
the creative air of students excited
about film. The Q&A session with the
directors after the festival featured
some humble filmmakers whose work
revealed the countless hours of sleep
lost in creating films. It is always refresh
ing to listen to a director, regardless of
age or experience, explain the purpose
of his film and what jobs he undertook
in completing their ambitious projects.
Keep your eyes peeled for upcoming
SFS events, including but not exclusive
to the Stanford Student Film Festival in
May. If you're interested in being one of
these student filmmakers, go to the SFS
Web site (http://www.stanford.edu/
group/sfs) and check out the possibility
of signing up for the next workshop.
Who knows, maybe your name will be
up in lights someday. Or at least on a
photocopied flier all over campus.
