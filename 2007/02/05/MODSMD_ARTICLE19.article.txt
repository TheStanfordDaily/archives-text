If restaurants were real estate, then the Stan
ford Grill would he an ocean side mansion in Long
Beach. As you drive up the curving, narrow road
through one of Stanford's many wild-wooded
patches, the street eventually opens up onto The
Grill's sloping lawns and Stanford's violently
green golf course. Perched atop a good-sized
knoll,The Grill overlooks artful, mature oaks and
the 18th fairway; it even offers a glimpse or two of
some of Stanford's terra cotta roofs.
The Grill's interior, however, is admittedly less
impressive, with plain white walls, run-of the-mill
laminate tables and simple metal-backed chairs.
The tone is casual and unexpectedly un-fancy and
un-golf-club-esque.
The row of tables by the expansive wall of win
dows overlooking the golf course is definitely the
best place to sit.There is umbrella-ed patio seating
outside which also offers equally notable views of
the course's flawless greens and the well-groomed,
most likely very wealthy golfers who play on them.
(It costs $100 a round for alumni, but only $25 for
students, so do yourself a favor, save $75 and
schedule a tee time before Commencement).
The breakfast and lunch menus offer entrees
varying from about $6-$ 12, with meals ranging
from tried and true basics like eggs and pancakes,
deli sandwiches and monster burgers to more in
teresting creations such as a Wild Mushroom
Ravioli, Cajun Fish Tacos and a Turkey and
Smoked Gouda Panini sandwich (which is deli
ciously toasted).
The entrees were neither overwhelmingly de
lectable nor underwhelmingly sub-parâ€” 1 would
say a bit above-average overall. (Apparently,
breakfast is rumored to be their superior meal)
Lunches come with the option of fruit salad,
coleslaw, potato salad or fries. When my friends
and I paused a moment to weigh the options, the

waiter assured us that the Grill served the world's
best French fries. Which we ordered. And. admit
tedly, not only were they well-salted, they were
also the good thin kind that have a high surface
area to volume ratio and are thus a first-rate
amount of crispy.
The service was helpful and accommodating,
(although at first I was upset that our waiter didn't
hold true to my 'no mayo' request, 1 soon realized
that this angering white condiment on my veggie
sandwich was,luckily,cream cheese.) In fact, when
1 asked our waiter if it was possible to modify my
sandwich, he responded. "Sure. Everything is pos
sible at Stanford."
And apparently it is, if you are Michelle Wie.
Whom we saw, for realsies, yes indeedy, no joke, I
kid you not. gliding into The Grill with her proud
looking parents and an eager-to-impress golf
guide. It was one of the moments when you're a

kid in Disneyland, thinking, "Wouldn't it just be
funny if I saw Mickey here?" and then low and be
hold, there is the little rodent himself, red bow-tie
and all.
The tall.confident millionaire Michelle already
looked the part of the Stanford legend she is
bound to become. (She is enrolling in the fall.) I
started to wonder if she looked out at the all the
wealthy, amateur Stanford golfers and pitied their
incredible lack of skill and coordination. Kind of
like how Mickey must feel about all the pitiably
un-fun humans he meets all of the time.
A little known on-campus eatery, the verdant
landscapes and the get-away feeling are certainly
worth with the trip. Come for the views, a decent
meal and some star spotting. Maybe you could
even catch sight of Stanford's not-quite-an-alum
Tiger. After all. anything is possible at this univer
sity of ours.
