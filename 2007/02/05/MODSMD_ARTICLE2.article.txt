season sweep since 1992-1993.

Stanford got the message, as the
Cardinal (15-6, 7-3 Pac-10) raced to
an early double-digit lead, withstood
a Cal comeback attempt and ran
away with a 90-71 victory on Satur
day. Hill made good on his words with
a game-high 24 points on red-hot 10-
for-13 shooting, while senior forward
Fred Washington had his best all
around game of the season with 21
points. 6 rebounds and 8 assists.
Guard Ayinde Übaka scored 15
of his 17 points in the second half for
the Bears (12-10. 4-6), well short of
his season-high 26 that doomed the
Cardinal on Jan. 3. Freshman for
ward Ryan Anderson, averaging 16.9
points per game on the season,
scored only 11 points on 4-for-ll
shooting, thanks to the stilling de
fense of Stanford freshman centers
Brook and Robin Lopez.
Stanford "just looked different"
than the team Cal beat a month ago.
Anderson said.
"Different guys were stepping
up." he said. "Everyone was con
tributing."
The Cardinal especially enjoyed
the contributions from Washington,
whose defense, ball handling and
other intangibles usually don't show
up in the box score. But the senior
was more aggressive than usual on
Saturday, driving toward the basket
with reckless abandon and setting up
his teammates for easy buckets.
"I just feel like I needed to attack
the basket," Washington said. "I
don't care about scoring as long as
we're winning. I just do what is
asked."
Stanford also received a boost
from its performance at the free
throw stripe, where it has struggled at
times this season.The Cardinal made
22 of its 24 free throws, including 12
of 12 in the final minutes to ice the
victory.
"Don't tell anyone, but that's ex

ceptional for us," Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson said. "This is
probably the best game we've played
on the road."
Despite an early 20-4 lead, the
Card's sloppy play midway through
the half allowed the Bears back into
the game. Freshman guard Jerome
Randle frustrated Stanford with his
quickness and accuracy from beyond
the arc,sparking an 8-0 Bears run. In
dicative of his team's frustration at
the time. Brook Lopez committed a
sloppy offensive foul and Johnson
sat the freshman down to offer some
words of wisdom.
"He told me not to worry about it
and to calm down." Lopez recalled
afterward. "I was a little annoyed;
mad at myself, really."
But Lopez and the Cardinal re
gained their composure. The fresh
man took over the game in the wan
ing minutes of the first half, scoring
the Cardinal's final five points before
the break with a deadly jumper from
the baseline. Übaka hit a running
jumper with five seconds left to bring
the Bears within 35-29 midway.
Lopez ended the half with 15 points
on red-hot 7-of-9 shooting from the
field, finishing the game with totals
of 19 points and seven rebounds.
Cal opened up the second half on
a tear; it got within four points after
an Übaka three-pointer, six minutes
into the period. But Stanford
clamped down on defense, going on
an 8-0 run. thanks largely to the post
defense of Robin Lopez. Lopez had
three blocks during the span and fin
ished the game with a team-high five.
Saturday was the second of two
games in which the Cardinal opened
up a big lead early, but unlike
Wednesday's double-overtime loss
to Gonzaga, Stanford demonstrated
an ability to withstand the opposing
team's run.
Hill admitted that his team had

Stanford got the message, as the
Cardinal (15-6, 7-3 Pac-10) raced to
an early double-digit lead, withstood
a Cal comeback attempt and ran
away with a 90-71 victory on Satur
day. Hill made good on his words with
a game-high 24 points on red-hot 10-
for-13 shooting, while senior forward
Fred Washington had his best all
around game of the season with 21
points. 6 rebounds and 8 assists.
Guard Ayinde Übaka scored 15
of his 17 points in the second half for
the Bears (12-10. 4-6), well short of
his season-high 26 that doomed the
Cardinal on Jan. 3. Freshman for
ward Ryan Anderson, averaging 16.9
points per game on the season,
scored only 11 points on 4-for-ll
shooting, thanks to the stilling de
fense of Stanford freshman centers
Brook and Robin Lopez.
Stanford "just looked different"
than the team Cal beat a month ago.
Anderson said.
"Different guys were stepping
up." he said. "Everyone was con
tributing."
The Cardinal especially enjoyed
the contributions from Washington,
whose defense, ball handling and
other intangibles usually don't show
up in the box score. But the senior
was more aggressive than usual on
Saturday, driving toward the basket
with reckless abandon and setting up
his teammates for easy buckets.
"I just feel like I needed to attack
the basket," Washington said. "I
don't care about scoring as long as
we're winning. I just do what is
asked."
Stanford also received a boost
from its performance at the free
throw stripe, where it has struggled at
times this season.The Cardinal made
22 of its 24 free throws, including 12
of 12 in the final minutes to ice the
victory.
"Don't tell anyone, but that's ex

ceptional for us," Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson said. "This is
probably the best game we've played
on the road."
Despite an early 20-4 lead, the
Card's sloppy play midway through
the half allowed the Bears back into
the game. Freshman guard Jerome
Randle frustrated Stanford with his
quickness and accuracy from beyond
the arc,sparking an 8-0 Bears run. In
dicative of his team's frustration at
the time. Brook Lopez committed a
sloppy offensive foul and Johnson
sat the freshman down to offer some
words of wisdom.
"He told me not to worry about it
and to calm down." Lopez recalled
afterward. "I was a little annoyed;
mad at myself, really."
But Lopez and the Cardinal re
gained their composure. The fresh
man took over the game in the wan
ing minutes of the first half, scoring
the Cardinal's final five points before
the break with a deadly jumper from
the baseline. Übaka hit a running
jumper with five seconds left to bring
the Bears within 35-29 midway.
Lopez ended the half with 15 points
on red-hot 7-of-9 shooting from the
field, finishing the game with totals
of 19 points and seven rebounds.
Cal opened up the second half on
a tear; it got within four points after
an Übaka three-pointer, six minutes
into the period. But Stanford
clamped down on defense, going on
an 8-0 run. thanks largely to the post
defense of Robin Lopez. Lopez had
three blocks during the span and fin
ished the game with a team-high five.
Saturday was the second of two
games in which the Cardinal opened
up a big lead early, but unlike
Wednesday's double-overtime loss
to Gonzaga, Stanford demonstrated
an ability to withstand the opposing
team's run.
Hill admitted that his team had
