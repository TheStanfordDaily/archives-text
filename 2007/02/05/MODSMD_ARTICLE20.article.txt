# Delve into a mystery

### ELIZABETH FOX INTERMISSION PLFASURE READER 
Do you remember free reading?
Can you recall it at all? For those
who cannot, the term entails picking
up a book that is not required and pe
rusing it for the sheer enjoyment of
its contents. I know. Weird —once
you try it.
Hut fun too. At least, it is in the
case of The Thirteenth Tale" by
Diane Setterfield. 1 ler debut novel
tells the story of Margaret Lea, an
amateur biographer working in her
father's bookshop, who spends her
time alone, still mourning the death
of her Siamese twin sister at birth.
When Margaret one day receives
a letter from Vida Winter — Eng
land's most famous living writer,
about whom next to nothing is
known — inviting her to chronicle
Vida's life, she hesitates before tak
ing the commission. But Vida's story
is one of gothic twists and turns, hor
rors and romance, madness, and
above all. twins, sucking Margaret
and the reader in. At the same time,
though. Margaret wonders whether
Vida is telling her the truth or just an
other story, as Vida has done in her
many previous interviews.
The mysteries—the veracity of
Vida's tale, the characters Margaret
meets, and. most importantly, the
ending to the great gothic story —
keep the reader on the edge of his
seat and up the whole night.
Perhaps I enjoyed the book so
much, though, because I'm an Eng
lish major, and this book is essential
ly a love letter to reading. In particu
lar. Setterfield seems to have a love
of gothic novels, such as "Jane Eyre"
and"The Woman in White." Not only
do the books themselves feature
prominently in the story, but themes
and even situations from them ap
pear boldly throughout. Ancient
manors, governesses, incest and se
cret family madness, staples of such
books, are here in abundance. Setter
field's novel also maintains a roman

ticism common to gothic novels; her
twins, for example, are imbued with
secret connections, inner under
standings and languages and physi
cal pain when the other is gone, even
in the case of Margaret, whose twin
has been dead since just after her
birth.
The writing, too, is excellent. Set
terfield has a knack for drawing char
acters whom we like despite our
selves. even when we cannot under
stand them or know better than to
trust them. I ler descriptions are vivid
and beautifully stated, yet never ob
scure. When Margaret, for example,
opens an ancient novel, she speaks of
"the smell of old books, so sharp, so
dry you can taste it." I feel better
about buying used books already.
The greatest flaw in Setterfield"s
novel comes at the end. The conclu
sion does manage to surprise the
reader and neatly and cleverly tic up
all the threads and confusions of
Vida's story. However, it is too far
fetched. even in as wild a novel as
this, to really satisfy.
The time period of the story is
also unclear — telephones and cars
