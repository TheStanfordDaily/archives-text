## Editorial Board Stanford: a corporate beacon of clap board and stucco 
### 
When I.eland Stanford opened the
doors to his university in 1891, it
was viewed as decisively different
from its East Coast counterparts. In particu
lar. the main quadrangle was a concrete tes
tament to this proud divergence. Built in the
form of mission-style revival, Stanford's ac
ademic center looked out onto the world. Its
garish sandstone massing, set ablaze with
red tiled roofs, proudly declared a fierce al
legiance to the ideology of the Wild West.
The message was clear: This was to be an in
stitution for academic pioneers, boldly blaz
ing their way into an optimistic future. The
architecture of our campus matched the
ethos of our university.
Over one hundred years later. Stanford
still embodies this pioneering spirit. Our
university is renowned for the entrepre
neurial vibe that permeates campus culture.
The founders of Google, Yahoo, Nike and
Victoria's Secret all attended Stanford. We
are a community that sets ourselves apart by
being different and taking risks.
Why then, are Stanford's buildings of
today so lackluster? From the Arrillaga
Alumni Center to the Graduate Communi
ty Center, the recently-built structures on
campus look like they belong in an industri
al park. Try to picture a corporate logo on
the side of Sweet Hall. The image is not so
difficult to conjure.
Industrial buildings are often built to be
uninteresting because companies move and
merge and declare bankruptcy. Most of
these buildings are not expected to last
more than 25 years.They are built for quick

assembly and cheap deconstruction.
So what kind of message does Stanford
send when it lets its new buildings look like
an addendum to the Googleplex in Moun
tain View?
Granted, not every building constructed
post-1900 looks as though it were carelessly
ordered from a catalog of innocuous build
ings. When Stanford decides to take archi
tectural risks, the results are often notewor
thy. There are I . M. Pei's William R. Hewlett
leaching Center and David Packard Elec
trical Engineering Building, the latter of
which was incorporated into the cover of
the 2005-2006 Stanford Bulletin. There is
Norman Foster's intelligent "inside-out"
( lark ( enter, an inverted building with win
dows facing an inner courtyard and solid
walls facing Campus Drive. The new addi
tion it) the Cantor Center for Visual Arts,
designed by architect James Polshek. is a
thoughtful space that sets a dramatic hack
drop for Party on the Edge, an event held on
the first Thursday of the school year.
But mind-numbingly boring and often
times downright irresponsible buildings
overwhelm the developing landscape at
Stanford. Take a trip up to the observation
deck at I loover Tower and compare the sil
houettes of the Main Quad or Pei's build
ings to the jumbled mass of Escondido
Road. Thoughtless boxes capped with
mandatory red tile grossly overwhelm any
attempts at architectural innovation.
It might be excusable to build what
