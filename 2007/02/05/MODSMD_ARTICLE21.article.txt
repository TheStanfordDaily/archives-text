## Editorial Board Stanford: a corporate beacon of clap board and stucco 
### 
When I.eland Stanford opened the
doors to his university in 1891, it
was viewed as decisively different
from its East Coast counterparts. In particu
lar. the main quadrangle was a concrete tes
tament to this proud divergence. Built in the
form of mission-style revival, Stanford's ac
ademic center looked out onto the world. Its
garish sandstone massing, set ablaze with
red tiled roofs, proudly declared a fierce al
legiance to the ideology of the Wild West.
The message was clear: This was to be an in
stitution for academic pioneers, boldly blaz
ing their way into an optimistic future. The
architecture of our campus matched the
ethos of our university.
Over one hundred years later. Stanford
still embodies this pioneering spirit. Our
university is renowned for the entrepre
neurial vibe that permeates campus culture.
The founders of Google, Yahoo, Nike and
Victoria's Secret all attended Stanford. We
are a community that sets ourselves apart by
being different and taking risks.
Why then, are Stanford's buildings of
today so lackluster? From the Arrillaga
Alumni Center to the Graduate Communi
ty Center, the recently-built structures on
campus look like they belong in an industri
al park. Try to picture a corporate logo on
the side of Sweet Hall. The image is not so
difficult to conjure.
Industrial buildings are often built to be
uninteresting because companies move and
merge and declare bankruptcy. Most of
these buildings are not expected to last
more than 25 years.They are built for quick

assembly and cheap deconstruction.
So what kind of message does Stanford
send when it lets its new buildings look like
an addendum to the Googleplex in Moun
tain View?
Granted, not every building constructed
post-1900 looks as though it were carelessly
ordered from a catalog of innocuous build
ings. When Stanford decides to take archi
tectural risks, the results are often notewor
thy. There are I . M. Pei's William R. Hewlett
leaching Center and David Packard Elec
trical Engineering Building, the latter of
which was incorporated into the cover of
the 2005-2006 Stanford Bulletin. There is
Norman Foster's intelligent "inside-out"
( lark ( enter, an inverted building with win
dows facing an inner courtyard and solid
walls facing Campus Drive. The new addi
tion it) the Cantor Center for Visual Arts,
designed by architect James Polshek. is a
thoughtful space that sets a dramatic hack
drop for Party on the Edge, an event held on
the first Thursday of the school year.
But mind-numbingly boring and often
times downright irresponsible buildings
overwhelm the developing landscape at
Stanford. Take a trip up to the observation
deck at I loover Tower and compare the sil
houettes of the Main Quad or Pei's build
ings to the jumbled mass of Escondido
Road. Thoughtless boxes capped with
mandatory red tile grossly overwhelm any
attempts at architectural innovation.
It might be excusable to build what
amounts to a series of aggrandized
chicken coops if they were not so
shamelessly dismissive of environ
mental considerations, as well. To
this day.the buildings that use the
least amount of energy per square
foot are a part of the old Main Quad.
Ihe most environmentally innova
tive building on campus is not even
Stanford's, but rather the Carnegie
Institution's Department of Global
Ecology building.
Ihe greatest victims of Stanford's
mindless building tactics are its stu
dents. The Lakeside Houses and the
Lomita Court Houses, such as Jerry
and 680. are concrete cell blocks
completely unproductive to encour
aging community-building. It is for
tunate that half of these houses are
occupied by inherently social frater
nities and that they all primarily
offer two-room doubles. If 680
Lomita consisted of only two-room
triples, for example, it is doubtful
that this terrible building would
carry the same niche.
Addressing the frightful efficien
cy with which the architecture of
Manzanita Park alienates residents
from one another would require an
essay almost entirely devoted to the
subject. Suffice to say. the winding
superplex functions as the ideal
home to those who wish to avoid all
forms of human contact. It this were
the intention of the design, then per
haps congratulations are in order to
the architect who decided that shov
ing 400 bodies into cubicles was the
key to encouraging a robust commu
nity.

There are some promising signs
that Stanford might be ready to
build buildings on campus that stand
up to the strength of Stanford's
founding pioneering vision. The yet
to-be-planned Green Dorm has the
potential to nationally lead the way
in both energy efficient living and
thoughtfulness toward student
needs.The new Bing-backcd student
center for the arts will have the capi
tal supporting it to make it aestheti
cally innovative and thoughtful in
design. The Bing Wing of Green Li
brary, although somewhat overly
reverent of Stanford's original archi
tecture. was at least willing to spend
the money to erect that type of
building intelligently and successful
ly.
Ultimately, Stanford should
reevaluate its current building val
ues. Yes. it is easier to let donors
serve as the bland masterminds to
their sterile buildings. Yes, it is easier
to cut project budgets instead of
spending extra money to woo some
one like Donald Gellespie, architect
of Wellesley College's victorious stu
dent union. But how will these build
ings age? We can already find the an
swer to this question by driving
south down the 101 and seeing the
crumpled, dot-com masses littering
the flanks of the highway.
What do our recent buildings,
ranging from mediocre to terrible,
say about the values of our Universi
ty? I.eland Stanford spent a sizable
fortune to make his university a bea
con — a beacon that had the power
through aesthetics alone to declare
Stanford as an intellectual outpost in
the daring West. What has happened
to Stanford's founding dream?
When did we decide to abandon his
dream of grandness, and exchange it
for stucco and clap board?

send when it lets its new buildings look like
an addendum to the Googleplex in Moun
tain View?
Granted, not every building constructed
post-1900 looks as though it were carelessly
ordered from a catalog of innocuous build
ings. When Stanford decides to take archi
tectural risks, the results are often notewor
thy. There are I . M. Pei's William R. Hewlett
leaching Center and David Packard Elec
trical Engineering Building, the latter of
which was incorporated into the cover of
the 2005-2006 Stanford Bulletin. There is
Norman Foster's intelligent "inside-out"
( lark ( enter, an inverted building with win
dows facing an inner courtyard and solid
walls facing Campus Drive. The new addi
tion it) the Cantor Center for Visual Arts,
designed by architect James Polshek. is a
thoughtful space that sets a dramatic hack
drop for Party on the Edge, an event held on
the first Thursday of the school year.
But mind-numbingly boring and often
times downright irresponsible buildings
overwhelm the developing landscape at
Stanford. Take a trip up to the observation
deck at I loover Tower and compare the sil
houettes of the Main Quad or Pei's build
ings to the jumbled mass of Escondido
Road. Thoughtless boxes capped with
mandatory red tile grossly overwhelm any
attempts at architectural innovation.
It might be excusable to build what
amounts to a series of aggrandized
chicken coops if they were not so
shamelessly dismissive of environ
mental considerations, as well. To
this day.the buildings that use the
least amount of energy per square
foot are a part of the old Main Quad.
Ihe most environmentally innova
tive building on campus is not even
Stanford's, but rather the Carnegie
Institution's Department of Global
Ecology building.
Ihe greatest victims of Stanford's
mindless building tactics are its stu
dents. The Lakeside Houses and the
Lomita Court Houses, such as Jerry
and 680. are concrete cell blocks
completely unproductive to encour
aging community-building. It is for
tunate that half of these houses are
occupied by inherently social frater
nities and that they all primarily
offer two-room doubles. If 680
Lomita consisted of only two-room
triples, for example, it is doubtful
that this terrible building would
carry the same niche.
Addressing the frightful efficien
cy with which the architecture of
Manzanita Park alienates residents
from one another would require an
essay almost entirely devoted to the
subject. Suffice to say. the winding
superplex functions as the ideal
home to those who wish to avoid all
forms of human contact. It this were
the intention of the design, then per
haps congratulations are in order to
the architect who decided that shov
ing 400 bodies into cubicles was the
key to encouraging a robust commu
nity.

There are some promising signs
that Stanford might be ready to
build buildings on campus that stand
up to the strength of Stanford's
founding pioneering vision. The yet
to-be-planned Green Dorm has the
potential to nationally lead the way
in both energy efficient living and
thoughtfulness toward student
needs.The new Bing-backcd student
center for the arts will have the capi
tal supporting it to make it aestheti
cally innovative and thoughtful in
design. The Bing Wing of Green Li
brary, although somewhat overly
reverent of Stanford's original archi
tecture. was at least willing to spend
the money to erect that type of
building intelligently and successful
ly.
Ultimately, Stanford should
reevaluate its current building val
ues. Yes. it is easier to let donors
serve as the bland masterminds to
their sterile buildings. Yes, it is easier
to cut project budgets instead of
spending extra money to woo some
one like Donald Gellespie, architect
of Wellesley College's victorious stu
dent union. But how will these build
ings age? We can already find the an
swer to this question by driving
south down the 101 and seeing the
crumpled, dot-com masses littering
the flanks of the highway.
What do our recent buildings,
ranging from mediocre to terrible,
say about the values of our Universi
ty? I.eland Stanford spent a sizable
fortune to make his university a bea
con — a beacon that had the power
through aesthetics alone to declare
Stanford as an intellectual outpost in
the daring West. What has happened
to Stanford's founding dream?
When did we decide to abandon his
dream of grandness, and exchange it
for stucco and clap board?
