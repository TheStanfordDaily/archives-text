# Dorm Foosball: Behind the addiction
## 
### 
I've been playing a lot of fooshall this
year. In fact, my whole dorm has. Al
though it's not my place to diagnose
the conditions of my fellow foos-enthusi
asts. I'll openly confess my own addiction
to the game, nay .sport. But whether or not
my habit classifies as injurious, Ill say one
thing with certainty: Robinson House is a
loos-haven on a campus largely unaware
of the joy and camaraderie that foosball
provides. Indeed, foosball has brought
peace, love and sunshine to our admitted
ly. ahem, quiet dormitory located in the
quaint and pastoral setting of Governor's
Corner.
Frankly. I'm not interested in grand
schemes to unite the Stanford undergradu
ate population, because I'm one of those
unfortunate cynics that people with school
spirit don't like. But for my own amuse
ment. and for your imminent enlighten
ment, let's suppose I had the power to enact
one law that would potentially affect all six
odd thousand of us undergraduates. With
out hesitation I would mandate that shiny,
new tournament-caliber foosball tables be
installed in every common room of every
dorm from Mirrielees all the way to my own
Robinson House in the farthest reaches of
West Campus.
I know the skeptics are thinking. What's
so great about foosball anyway? I low can it
compete with billiards, the undisputed king
of bar sports, or the easy-to-pick up, impos
sible-to-master likeability of ping pong? I
mean, nil you have to do is spin a couple
rods really hard and the ball eventually
finds its way into the goal. Well, to all the
boors out there harboring this misguided
opinion, let me tell you: YOU'RE* DEAD
WKON(i. First, let's clear one thing up.
Spinning the rods is cardinal sin #1 in the
world of Fooshall. Don't believe me? Let
me direct your attention to the official II SI
(International lahle Soccer Federation)
rule book, page II section 15: "Spinning of
the rods is illegal." Table soccer, or as it's
colloquially known Stateside as "foosball."
is serious business. ITiey've got rules and an
international federation bent on laying
down said rules.
Second, discard any confused images
you might have of drunken, beer-guzzling
b;ir creatures, of either the Texan or Euro
pean variety. Well, actually, don't, because
they're probably all true But what matters
is that these guys can play. man. Top foos
ball pros hit speeds upwards of 40mph on
their 3-bar snake shots. It's just this sort of
mastery we strive for in Robinson — the
collective progress we make as players is
mutually inspiring, and the constant effort
and training necessary to stay in top shape
provides a framework for living a healthy
lite. ()r something.
At the very least, everyone should play

toosball because it unites a group of people
around a common cause — improving one
sell in some higher Olympic sense. Add in
the fact that anywhere from two to eight can
play (4v4 action is heavenly), and you've got
a bona fide dormwide activity.
Of course, dormmate competition can
sometimes degenerate into a chaotic. Dar
winian moshpit.but this too can be edifying.
Observers of campus life might distill tru
isms from the colorful blur of trash-talking
and high-octane, survival-of-the-fittest
styled gameplay.
But it's time tor me to be perfectly hon
est. It's time to let you in on the real secret
behind foosball's admittedly peculiar popu
larity. You may or may not have heard ru
mors of the famed naked lap. In Robinson,
some of us like to call it "throwing a bagel."
You never want a bagel thrown at you.
As dictated by the higher powers, the
horrific consequence of a shutout defeat
(zero points, like a bagel) in foosball is a
"naked lap." This means exactly what it
says: The loser must run. fully unclothed,
through each and every hall of the dorm in
which the "bagelling" took place, and all
spectators must laugh and exalt in the mer
riment of the event. No. the excitement is
not motivated by perversion — it's a cele
bration of the victor's supreme mastery and
impeccable style (it takes art to win l()-zip),
as well as ;i recognition of the loser's good
faith ;tnd acknowledgement of a generally
well-liked house rule.
That's really the secret behind the joy of
foosball. in my rather skewed opinion. I
can't describe anything more gratifying
than finally blasting a shot into the oppos
ing goal after being down seven or eight to
nothing, teetering on the threshold of a
shutout -it's like surviving a near-death
experience.
My dorm is having an in-house tourna
ment this quarter, and many of us are wait
ing with great anticipation. Whether or
not a bagelling occurs is immaterial — the
intensity is what counts. Foosball is a med
icine I'd prescribe to any ailing dorm, of
fice or home. Just don't sue me if you end
up attending meetings of Foosmen
Anonymous.

foosball. in my rather skewed opinion. I
can't describe anything more gratifying
than finally blasting a shot into the oppos
ing goal after being down seven or eight to
nothing, teetering on the threshold of a
shutout -it's like surviving a near-death
experience.
My dorm is having an in-house tourna
ment this quarter, and many of us are wait
ing with great anticipation. Whether or
not a bagelling occurs is immaterial — the
intensity is what counts. Foosball is a med
icine I'd prescribe to any ailing dorm, of
fice or home. Just don't sue me if you end
up attending meetings of Foosmen
Anonymous.
