# Most certainly not a mail-order bride
## 
### 
I was at a party with some friends when I
spotted a ruggedly handsome individual
standing in the corner. Someone suggest
ed I go "cop a feel. "The comment was greet
ed by a blank stare. After an explanation. I
was eager to begin using this new and excit
ing phrase in conversation, lint on a test run,
I got a little confused and suggested to anoth
er friend that she should feel a cop.
On the whole, I 'd like to think my linguis
tic abilities are on par with the average Joe,
but much of the nuance of this fine language
seems to evade my grasp.
It took me 10 minutes to figure out what
"finagle" means and still I can never remem
ber how to say it (1 had to ask my friend for
the purposes of this column). Until last week,
I thought baking soda and bleach were one
ar.d the same. When my drawmate referred
to Scarlett Johansson as a sexpot. I assumed
she meant a seductive stoner. My friends
have lovingly dubbed me "Comrade ESL."
Now technically, English is my second lan
guage. So I always have the 1-was-raised-in-
Soviet-Russia-so-it's-not-my-fault card up
my sleeve. And. to be honest. I play it quite
often. But that excuse doesn't seem entirely
legitimate because I've lived in California
since I was six. I guess those first six years re
ally are that formative.That, and the fact that
I spent my first few years here in an ESL
playground gang probably didn't help.
On top of these, what I like to think are
charming mistakes, my not-from-around
here-ness is made even more obvious by the
wisp of an accent. Most of the time. 1 could
pass for a good ol' American girl, born and
bred. But certain words ("kitten" and "girl"
are particularly nasty culprits) betray my
Russki background. 1 wouldn't complain if I

had one of those heavy Slavic accents that re
mind people of a mail-order bride â€” Russ
ian mail-order brides are hot, just think of
Nicole Kidman in "Birthday Girl." But as it
is, the accent is pretty useless when it comes
to adding sultry foreign mystery.
Under normal circumstances, this would
n't bother me. I 'm fluent, my vocabulary is of
a decent size. I have an artful command of
grammatical rules and I'm not particularly
eager to pass off as American. Only problem
is. I can't pass off as anything else, either.
My quote unquote native language is
Russian. But the moment 1 open my mouth,
it becomes blazingly obvious (again) that I'm
not from around there. Russians always com
pliment me on my speaking skills, until they
learn that I was born in the heart of the
USSR. Then, nodding sympathetically, they
tell me it's hard for those who broke through
the Iron Curtain at a young age to keep up
their language, and 1 should be proud I've
done as well as I have.
And even though I'm fluent, 1 feel posi
tively foolish when speaking Russian. I once
spent six months confusing the Russian
words for "rabbit" and "midget."The amount
of times these came up in conversation was
surprising, to say the least. Trying to under
stand my cousins' new-fangled slang leaves

me mentally drained and emotionally
scarred. And my grandparents spend a good
portion of family reunions apologizing to rel
atives for the Americanisms running ram
pant in my speech.
At least in English, I can sometimes carry
on whole conversation without getting the
inevitable, "Where are you from? ... I mean,
originally?" In Russian. 1 couldn't pass for a
native speaker if my life depended on it. Oh
cruel irony of fate, what a crooked hand thou
hast dealt me.
What it really comes down to, then, is that
I have no native language. Its like everyone
else is part of some cool, secret club for peo
ple in possession of a native language and I'm
not invited.That time my roommates created
a cool, secret club that required members to
be "not ESL" didn't help my self-esteem.
To the fortunate language-endowed
masses, not having a native language may not
seem terribly distressing. Hut because our
language defines the way we look at the
world (try thinking in a different language -
you'll see everything in a new light), not
being able to completely align with one cre
ates a sort of mini identity crisis.
Perhaps I 'm overreacting. After all. surely
I'm not the first language-less person. Russ
ian-born-and-raised Nabokov learned Eng
lish before he learned Russian, then mastered
both and. just for the hell of it. added a dash of
French. I think it's a safe bet that his accent
was heavier than mine and he ended up writ
ing the great American novel. I'm a French
Lit major. History is bound to repeat itself.

Think "Loliiti" is not the great American
novel? Email Vicky at vickyd@stanforci.edu to
be convinced otherwise.
