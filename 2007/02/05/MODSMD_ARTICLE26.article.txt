Breeden won both the 100 and
200 butterfly events, setting person

the 1 (K) and missed Shelly Ripple's
time in the 200 by .03 seconds. In
both victories, Breeden beat out
Cal's 2004 Olympic gold-medalist
Dana Vollmer. With times of 51.70 in
the 100 and 1:53.23 in the 200. Bree
den is now the Cardinal's third- and
second-ranked all-time performer in
the respective events.
"This was the most exciting dual
meet I've ever swam in." Breeden
said. "To have all of your teammates
around you, cheering for the com
mon goal of the team winning, was
amazing."
Breeden s classmate. Smit, put up
three individual victories for Stan
ford. with first-place finishes in the
200 freestyle, 200 backstroke and 200

individual medley. Her 200 free win
in 1:45.91 was a personal-best and

Smit's 1:56.20 in the 200 back and
1:58.12 in the 200 IM were both
NCAA "A" times.

with a 22.41 in the 50 free and a 53.88
in the 100 back, both of which were
also NCAA "A" times. Krug, who re
cently returned from the World
Championship Selection Camp in
Indianapolis, took first in both the
one-meter and three-meter diving
events.

up one victory for Stanford. Bruce

breast. Bishop captured it with her
second-place finish in the 100 free,
and Stanford's 2(X) and 4(X) medley
relay teams reached the mark when
they placed second.
"This was a meet of great per
formances and momentum swings,"
head coach Lea Maurer said. "We
handled those momentum swings
well and had a phenomenal all-around
team effort. It was great to come away with
the win."

son, the Cardinal's win broke the Golden
Bears' dual-meet win streak at 21.Cal's last
loss also came at the hands of Stanford, on
Feb. 12,2005 at Berkeley.
"It was huge for the team to go unbeat
en," Breeden said. "It was a goal at the be
ginning of year. We still want to focus on the

upcoming championships meets, hut no
body can take this away from us."

more pleased with her team's performance.
"We were so composed as a team
today," Maurer said. "1 couldn't be more
proud of how we handled ourselves and
represented Stanford. It was really impor
tant for the team to finish an unbeaten reg
ular season."
Maurer kept the team's regular season
achievements in perspective, looking ahead
to preparing for the NCAA championships.
"The great thing is that we were able to
reach a happy medium and able to accom
plish this (undefeated season] without
going to the emotional well too much," she

said. "We were able to do it without peak
ing and compromising our goals for the
NCAA Championships."
