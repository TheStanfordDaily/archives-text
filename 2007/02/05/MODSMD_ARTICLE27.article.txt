# Manning proves his might
## Colts win first title since moving to Indianapolis 
### MICHAEL MAROT ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MlAMl—Joseph Addai and Dominic
Rhodes split carries all season, so it was fit
ting they shared the credit Sunday.
With Addai playing the role of setup
man and Rhodes emerging as the finisher,
the Indianapolis Colts' tag-team of running
backs gave Peyton Manning enough bal
ance in rainy Miami to finally bring home
the Lombardi Trophy with a 29-17 victory
over the Chicago Bears in the Super Bowl.
While Manning was selected the game's
MVP. Rhodes and Addai demonstrated
how two running backs could carve out a
niche — together.
"What makes it work is that we're two
unselfish guys," said Rhodes, who can be
come an unrestricted free agent. "Defenses
can't look to just stop one style, and that
makes it harder for them."
Addai. who led all rookies in rushing
during the regular season despite not start
ing a game, ran 19 times for 77 yards and
softened up a defense considered one of the
strongest in the league.
He also caught 10 passes, more than any
of his more notable teammates or any rook
ie in a Super Bowl, for 66 yards. In fact, his
reception total tied the Super Bowl record
for a running back, established by Miami's
Tony Nathan in 1985.
Rhodes, who graciously accepted his new
role as the backup in the playoffs, was even
better. He ran 21 times for 113 yards and
scored one touchdown — and the contrast
ing styles caused problems for Chicago.
"He's a cutting guy, and I'm more a
downhill guy," Rhodes said. "When you
have a guy cutting and another guy who will
hit you, it makes it hard for the defenses."
After overpowering Kansas City, Balti
more and New England in their AFC play
off games, the Colts got a performance from
their running backs Sunday will be forever
etched into the memories of their fans.
Addai and Rhodes repeatedly ran into
the middle of the wet field, challenging the
Bears' strength, and then quickly cut out

side. They put Manning in position to con
vert third downs.They took care of the ball
in the breezy, slippery conditions except
once when Manning's handoff slid right
through Addai's fingers.
And when they had to close it out, they
did that,too.
It was no surprise to the rest of the Colts.
"All year they've been splitting carries
because we wanted them healthy for the
end of the season." left tackle Tarik Glenn
said.'"They certainly did their job today."
In fact, without Addai and Rhodes, the
Colts might not have made it this far.
It was Addai's 3-yard touchdown run
against New England two weeks ago that
earned them a ticket to Miami, and Rhodes'
solid play late that helped close out Balti
more.
But in Miami, Addai and Rhodes were
on a different level.
Addai never seemed to struggle with
making cuts on the soft turf, and Rhodes'
straight-ahead style was a perfect comple
ment.
Together, they helped the Colts become
the first dome team to win a Super Bowl in

an outdoor stadium.
"We just try to take advantage of what
they give us. That's what we've been doing
all year." Addai said. "It's just going out
there and believing in each other that we
can get the job done for our teammates."
While they proved all season that it
could work, Sunday's performance, on the
grandest stage of all. demonstrated it to the
world.
With a blend of short, powerful runs and
an occasional big one, they forced Chica
go's linebackers closer to the line of scrim
mage, llie few times the Bears backed off,
Addai and Rhodes made them pay.
Rhodes' 36-yard dash late in the third
quarter set up Adam Vinatieri's field goal
that gave the Colts a 22-14 lead.
And on their last possession. Manning
didn't even throw a pass. He simply handed
the ball to Rhodes, who safely tucked it
away in a turnover-plagued game to seal the
win.
"They blocked for us, and he (Manning)
put us in some great plays," Rhodes said.
"We knew it would be a running football
game, and I'm glad we got it done."
