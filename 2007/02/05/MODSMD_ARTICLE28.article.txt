# Baseball swept out of Fullerton
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
ITie Stanford baseball team knew it would
have to start the season sharp in order to suc
ceed in one of the nation's most demanding
opening schedules. Faltering in the late in
nings. though, the young Cardinal's defensive
errors and inconsistent pitching gave No. 8
Cal-State Fullerton a weekend sweep.
Stanford (0-3) found itself in a deep hole
early on, as the Titans (3-0) jumped out to an
11-0 lead by the fourth inning in Friday night's
season opener.The Cardinal mounted a rally,
but fell short, losing 11-5.
The team appeared rejuvenated the next
day, leading 5-0 in the fourth inning of Satur
day's game. At that point, however, Stanford's
pitching staff started showing chinks in its
armor, surrendering six unanswered runs for
the 6-5 loss in a demoralizing defeat.
Up 2-1. and holding another late-inning
lead on Sunday, the Cardinal let Cal State-
Fullerton explode with an 11-run seventh in
ning. The Titans completed the sweep with a
12-10 offensive slugfest in which Stanford
once again fell one step short.
In the season opener, sloppy Stanford play
set the tone early as the Cardinal gave up six
runs in the first two innings. Junior starter
Nolan Gallagher (0-1) hit 1 ullerton's Icadoff
man, junior outfielder Clark 1 lardman (2-4,3
R, 2 RBI), and plunked another Titan in the
second, while sophomore and second base
man Austin Yount was charged an error for
failing to step on first base on a sacrifice bunt
attempt in the first frame.
The leadoff men for the Titans proved
nasty once again after back-to-back doubles
by 1 lardman and second baseman Joel Weeks
(2-4,3 R, 4 RBI) broke the game open in the
second inning, scoring four runs. Gallagher
was pulled after giving up eight hits, seven
runs and recording an 18.00 FRA by the third
inning.
Unfortunately, the relievers did not fair
much better against the Fullerton bats, giving
up four more runs in the fifth inning.
Stanford attempted a rally on Wes Romer
(1-0). one of the nation's top starters, but it
wouldn't be enough. After four scoreless in
nings, the Cardinal led off the tilth with three
straight singles from the bottom of the order
in junior Brian Juhl (1-4). sophomore Cord
Phelps (1-3) and freshman Adam Gaylord (1-
3). Stanford would touch up Romer for only
five hits and three runs surrendered over six
innings. The Cardinal mustered two more
runs off the bullpen, but it proved to be too lit
tle, too late for Stanford.
The most frustrating game of the weekend
series for Stanford proved to be the second.
The Cardinal jumped out early on Fullerton
and appeared to be in control on Saturday.
After back-to-back singles by sophomores
Sean Ratliff (2-5,1 R) and Joey August (I -5.1
R) to lead off the game, junior outfielder
Michael Taylor (1-4, 2 RBI) hit a two-RBI
triple down the right-field line in the first in
ning to plate two. Yount scored Taylor with an
RBI groundout to take a 3-0 first-inning lead.
Juhl (1-3) then hit a homerun off a 0-1 pitch
over the right-field fence to kickstart the sec
ond inning.The homerun was Stanford's first
this year.
But even with the 5-ocushion, the C 'ardinal
couldn't put the game out of reach. Freshman
hurler Jeff Inman. who started off brilliantly
with three scoreless innings, began to show
signs of fatigue. The right-hander was able to
wiggle out of a bases-loaded, no-outs jam by
inducing a double play and a ground out to es-

cape giving up only one run.
The near-miss proved to be a sign of things
to come as the Titans did not let up in the fifth.
Fullerton took advantage of two Taylor er
rors, which turned I lardman's one-out single
into a run-scoring triple. Three batters later,
right fielder Chris Jones' two-run double tied
the game at five.
Reliever Max Fearnow (0-1 ).who replaced
Inman. was able to stave off the Titans until
the bottom of the eighth when Uardman got
the eventual game-winner, an RBI single. In
the topol the ninth, Stanford would have one
more chance to even the score, but Taylor's
game-ending ground out stranded sopho
more pinch runner J.J. Jelmini, who had
reached second on a balk by Titan reliever
Adam Jorgenson.
Except for that slip-up, Jorgenson was the
key to the Titans' come-from-behind victory.
Taking over for starter Adam Kaplan in the
third, Jorgenson pitched 6.1 innings of score
less baseball with seven strikeouts.
I bi the second-straight game, the Cardinal
appeared in the driver's seat into the seventh
inning on Sunday. Sophomore lefty Jeremy
Blcich (0-1) had pitched six innings of one
run ball, pacing Stanford to a 2-1 lead. But the
Titans emerged from their funk in the seventh
to plate 11 runners against seven Cardinal
pitchers.
It all started to unravel for the southpaw
when he gave up two singles and a w;ilk to
start the inning, and was pulled for Yount.
But the bullpen did not live up to its name,
providing little relief. Instead, the sophomore
righty and second baseman gave up two hits
and two earned runs to put the Titans up for
good, 7-2. Stanford finally got out of the in
ning when freshman Rex Petrill threw one
pitch in his first appearance to record a dou
ble play, but the damage had been done, as the
Cardinal was down 12-2.
Despite the demoralizing inning, Stanford
fought back with a leadoff homerun in the
eighth from Taylor. ITie offensive rebuttal
would prove to be not enough ;is the ('ardinal
would get six in the final two innings, falling
12-10.
Stanford will try to rebound with its home
opener against Fresno State this Friday,Feb.9.
First pitch is at 5 p.m. on the Sunken Dia
mond.
