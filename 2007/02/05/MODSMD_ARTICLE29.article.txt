Brian I erneyhough, the Wiliam
II Bonsall Professor in Music, has
been selected as the winner of the
2007 international Ernst von
Siemens Music Prize, commonly re
ferred to as the Nobel Prize for clas
sical music. The award, which in
cludes a $260,000 cash prize, will be
formally bestowed on Ferneyhough
in a May o ceremony at the kammer
spiele I heater in Munich, Germany.
A pioneer of the New Complexity
movement. Ferneyhough has an
eclectic repertoire, ranging from the
opera Shadowtime to one of the
most difficult string quartets of the
genre.
According to a statement from
the I rust von Siemens Foundation.
Ferneyhough has "rethought and il
luminated the myriad possibilities of
manipulating musical material and
stretched these possibilities to their
limits."
Ferneyhough, who described his
musical approach as "provocative"
and "controversial," was humble in
his acceptance of the award.
" Ihere are many composers who
would do the prize honor, so I can
only assume that it's recognition of
my being a great survivor!" he said.
Ferneyhough revealed to The
Daily that he was surprised when he
learned he'd won the award via a let

"Most of us tend to assume that
nothing much of consequence is sent
by snail-mail these days," he said. "1
had to do a double-take on the con
tent of that one, especially since it
was in German."
This is the first time that a Stan
ford faculty member has been
awarded the prize. Prof. Stephen
Sano. chair of the music department,
shared Ferneybough's excitement.
"You can imagine what it means
to a student in composition to have
the opportunity to study with Prof.
Ferneyhough." Sano said. "The
Siemens Music Prize is one of the
most revered honors in the music
world."
Sano agreed with the founda
tion's statement that few composers
have so consistently expanded upon
the avant-garde music approaches of
the 1950' sand I%o's.
"Prof, 112 erneyhough brings exact
ly this intellectual and musical vitali
ty to our music department." Sano
said. "As a department, we are
tremendously proud of Brian's ac
complishments and this honor be
stowed upon him — a most deserved
honor indeed."
Ferneyhough plans to continue
composing and teaching — two ac
tivities he can hardly imagine doing
separately. While he has yet to figure
out what to do with the monetary
prize, the professor of 35 years did
confess one wish.
One idea he had: "Buy myself
some unadulterated composing
time, perhaps?"
