# Women's hoops stunned in big win for No. 21 Cal
## Stanford drops first loss to Bears in 17 matches 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
For the No. 8 Stanford women?s bas
ketball team, yesterday brought both
the end of one era and the start of an
other. After 17 straight wins, the Cardi
nal women were upset, 72-57, by No. 21
California, which broke its own streak
of 14-straight losses to Stanford for the
beginning of a "real" Bay-Area rivalry.
"When people talk about a rivalry,
you've got to win some of them." said
Golden Bears head coach Joanne
Boyle, who called the game "the biggest
win in our program?s history."
For the Cardinal, though, it was
nearly the complete opposite.

Freshman center Brook Lopez is stopped en route to the basket. Lopez nabbed 19
points in the Cardinal's victory in Berkeley, while sophomore forward Lawrence Hill
contributed 24 to the effort.
A 26.6 field goal percentage was
the worst in school history, as Stan
ford (18-4, 11-1 Pacific-I*o Confer
ence) went 9-for-30 and 8-lor-34 in
the first and second halves, respec
tively. Cal (17-5. N-4) shot 46.0 per
cent from the field overall, and went
a devastating 58.8 percent in the sec
ond halt compared to the Cardinal'.'s
23.5 percent. Needless to say, Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer
was disappointed that [Stanford]
didn't battle more.
Junior guard Candice Wiggins,
who had a team-high 17 points for
the day, was similarly upset.
"It was ourselves, 1 feel; we defi
nitely had control, and it was our
game to lose," Wiggins said.
Problems started early on with a
three-point attempt by freshman
guard J J Hones. Coming into her
jump-stop slightly off-balance,
1 lones was on the floor and had to be
carried off the court just 39 seconds
into the game. VanDerveer fears that
1 lones may have torn her ACL. dis
couraging for the game and the rest
of the season.
"It was really upsetting to our
team to see JJ go down,? Van-
Derveer said. "But that happens, and
we have to play through an injury
like that."
Stanford did. with Wiggins taking
over point guard, but the Cardinal
went on to show an uncharacteristic
lack of energy, especially against a
fellow top-25 team. VanDerveer
called her team "glazy." A rough
awakening was to come, though,
when an 8-0 run near the middle of
the half gave Cal its first lead of the
game, 13-17. Barely hanging on
through most of the rest of the half, it
wasn?t until 29 seconds were left on
the clock that sophomore guard Jil
lian 1 larmon sunk a three-pointer to
give Stanford a narrow 31-30 lead
going into halftime.
"We didn't battle, we didn't come
out aggressive and we weren't talk
ing," VanDerveer said.
The Golden Bears, on the other
hand, came with a vengeance after a
difficult 69-44 loss at Berkeley. Jan. 6.
And in the second half, the Golden
Bears retook the lead.43-42. at 12:57.
When senior center Brooke
Smith countered with a jumper at
12:29. Cal's Devanei Hampton re
scinded the Stanford lead for the last
time with a jumper of her own. The
Golden Bears went on to extend
their lead to as much as nine points in
the next 10 minutes.
All of the Golden Bears con
tributed, just as Boyle had hoped for.
Guards Natasha Vital and Lauren
Grief each stepped up with 19 and 15
points, respectively.TTiey also had six
rebounds each.
Although sophomore forward

Ashley Walker, Cal's usual team
leader, was having an ice-cold night
with only six points, her fellow pow
erful post, sophomore Hampton, was
having one of her best games yet.
Hampton had her fourth double
double of the season with 22 points
and 14 rebounds, 12 of which were
off the Cardinal boards.
"They have great post players,
like Devanei," Smith said. "They're
very tough, hard to get around and a
great challenge for us."
Working from the outside then,
Stanford still had trouble getting
through the hoop. Watching the win
and its 17-game streak slip away, the
Cardinal panicked, shooting threes.
The team went 0-for-16 on the shot in
the second half, though, keeping
Cal'.'s lead safe from any last-minute
runs.
Stanford scrambled in the last two
minutes, attempting to extend the
game with fouls. The plan backfired,
with the Golden Bears garnering 12
of their 14 last points from the free
throw line. The Cardinal remained
scoreless for the last 1:07, and when
the buzzer sounded, Cal celebrated
its victory center court at Maples.
"A spectator out there would've
thought, 'That's some great basket

ball,' and that's what we want to con
tinue to build at Cal," Boyle said.
Stanford, though, with its streak
broken and confidence shaken by
the idea of the first Cal loss in nearly
six years, let alone its worst-ever
shooting percentage, is looking to re
build in the coming days.
"This type of game will be good
for us; we need this type of battle in
our conference," VanDerveer said.
"We're just trying to look forward
and say this'll help us in the tourna
ment."
Unsure of Hones' health after
yesterday's game, the Cardinal will
have to readjust in the coming weeks.
VanDerveer said she'll continue with
Wiggins at the point guard position,
or she may try senior Markisha Cole
man or freshman Melanie Murphy.
Wiggins said she is ready for whatev
er comes.
"I know I'll have the ball in my
hands a lot more now." she said. " I'm
just going to try to keep everyone
poised, settle up the score and do
what I do. We're going to work
through this as a team."
