# Women's hoops stunned in big win for No. 21 Cal
## Stanford drops first loss to Bears in 17 matches 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
For the No. 8 Stanford women?s bas
ketball team, yesterday brought both
the end of one era and the start of an
other. After 17 straight wins, the Cardi
nal women were upset, 72-57, by No. 21
California, which broke its own streak
of 14-straight losses to Stanford for the
beginning of a "real" Bay-Area rivalry.
"When people talk about a rivalry,
you've got to win some of them." said
Golden Bears head coach Joanne
Boyle, who called the game "the biggest
win in our program?s history."
For the Cardinal, though, it was
nearly the complete opposite.
