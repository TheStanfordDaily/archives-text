# Mental health reevaluated
## Counselors describe drawbacks of "Stanford duck syndrome" 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This is the first of a multi-part series on mental
health at Stan fori). The second part will appear in
Tuesday's Daily.
On a campus that prides itself on bright
moods, carefree demeanors and relaxed atti
tudes, the recent death of graduate student

Mengyao "May Zhou came as ;i shock to many
students. Labeled an apparent suicide by the
Santa Rosa Police Department, Zhou's death
has brought the state of mental health at Stan
ford into focus, sparking debate and discussion
about student well-being.
It should be no surprise that Stanford stu
dents, like their peers on other campuses, suffer
from their share of mental health issues or that
the University maintains an extensive network
to serve students struggling with these issues.
But an ongoing investigation by The Daily
into mental health on campus shows that there
are other factors that sot Stanford apart — for

better or worse.
Living on a residential campus, most enjoy
the benefits that come with being in an especial
ly close-knit community where students are able
to watch out for one another.
But students and administrators familiar with
mental health at Stanford told The Daily that
problematic issues lurking under the surface
have not always received the attention they de
serve. They said that sometimes students feel the
need to hide their problems from their friends
and housemates in an effort to appear as happy
as the\ perceive their classmates to
be. an act popularly known as the
"Stanford duck syndrome."
Below the Surface
According to the American Asso
ciation of Suicide Prevention, suicide
is the second leading cause of death
among college students only car
accidents claim more lives per year —
and in the vast majority of youth sui
cides. mental illness plays a role.
At Stanford, mental health ten
sions are exacerbated by the "Stan
ford duck syndrome." As the analogy
goes, Stanford students appear calm

and relaxed on the surface, but. like
ducks, they are often paddling fever
ishly underneath just to stay afloat.
"1 very thing can seem wonderful
here, including the students." said Dr.
Alejandro Martinez, director of Coun
seling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) at Vaden I lealth Center.
l"he perception of übiquitous hap
piness. students say. can place added
pressure on those who may not actu
ally be happy.
"It's a very real issue." said Kyle
Evaldez'o9. a live-in counselor at The
Bridge. "F.veryone thinks everyone's
always happy."
According to Evaldez. many stu
dents come to The Bridge because
they feel uncomfortable discussing
their problems with friends or house
mates. Several of the students
Evaldez has counseled have told him

they feel the daily pressure of having
to be a "duck."
You feel that you have to be
happy," Evaldez said. "If you're not
happy, you think something's wrong
with you."
He added that the University
sometimes exacerbates the problem
by making a greater effort to"hype up
its reputation" as a happier alterna
tive to its peer institutions. By main
taining the facade of happiness, he ar
gued. the University increases the
pressure on students to remain
"ducks."
"The Stanford duck syndrome' is
a huge part of the problem since it
prevents an open discussion." said
Alejandro De Los Angeles'o7, one of
the founders of Stanford Peace of
Mind — a student group that ad
dresses mental health and life issues

on campus. "Any time there's an in
ternalization of these problems,
there's a strong tendency to make
things worse."
De Los Angeles described the
problem as a "lack of dialogue" and
said the responsibility for reform rest
ed on the shoulders of both the stu
dents and the University.
Seeking Help
According to mental health spe
cialists at The Bridge and CAPS, stu
dents seek counseling for a number of
mental health issues, ranging from de
pression and anxiety to thoughts
about suicide. Relationship problems
are the most prevalent issues encoun
tered in counseling, they told The
Daily.
"For undergraduates, tensions in
family or romantic relationships that

trace back to home are common,"
Martinez said. "Many don't have as
much experience in relationships."
Graduate students, however, gen
erally seek counseling for dramatical
ly different issues. While many discuss
problems with relationships, these is
sues typically involve long-term part
ners.
Even more often, specialists at the
Bridge and CAPS said, graduate stu
dents seek counseling because they
feel lonely and isolated. Many of the
students that they encounter are per
forming independent research or
completing their dissertations and
may not participate in meaningful so
cial interaction for days. Some of
these students live in studios alone
and feel isolated without a roommate.
University officials recognized
these concerns and described their ef

forts to address these issues.
"I think there is general acknowl
edgement that many graduate stu
dents experience stress and increased
demands on their time, both of which
can he isolating," Graduate Life Of
fice director Chris Griffith wrote in an
email to The Daily." What we try todo
is create opportunities for graduate
students to meet each other and form
supportive communities of friends."
Ultimately, students expressed the
importance of discussing their mental
health life with each other to alleviate
the pressures caused by the "Stanford
duck syndrome."
"As amazing as Stanford is,"
Evaldez said, "people do get stressed
out here."
