powerful experiences in the lives of
Sikhs.
The films were shown in clusters of
three to four hours, with each cluster
aimed at a specific age group.The fes
tival also gave viewers the opportuni
ty to interact with some of the films'
actors and directors in post-film ques
tion and answer sessions.
"It was excellent," said A par Bo
laria. a software engineer from San
Mateo who brought his entire family
to the festival. "I really liked 'The
Gold Bracelet' and, because I grew
up in Rngland, I enjoyed Who Do
You Think You Are?'as well.The film
was told quite well and not necessari

ly in a traditional documentary style."
Stanford Sikh Student Associa
tion members and other volunteers
were on-hand throughout the day to
distribute tickets and answer ques
tions. Mantaj Kajpal, a student from
Cupertino High School, volunteered
to help because of his experience at
last year's festival.
"1 came here last year and I really
liked the movies." he said.
Sikhism. a 16th century religion
with its roots in northern India, has
more than 23 million adherents
worldwide. Most Sikhs live in the In
dian state of Punjab. Hie religion's
philosophy centers on egalitarianism
and inner devotion.
There is a feeling among Sikhs
that a lack of awareness among the
general public has contributed to a
post-Sept. 11 backlash against the
religious community. The Spinning

Wheel Film Festival was founded in
Toronto, Canada four years ago in
an effort to combat this ignorance
and to spread knowledge of Sikh
culture.
Singh expressed hope that the film
festival and other Stanford Sikh Stu
dents Association activities would
raise student awareness about Sikhs
on campus.
"The film festival will help stu
dents understand how the Sikh com
munity fits into the larger quilt of the
Stanford community," he said.
The association has planned a cel
ebration for Lohri — a traditional
Punjab holiday — in the Lake Lagu
nita barbeque area next Saturday and
plans to sponsor a Student Initiated
Course on Sikhism next quarter.
