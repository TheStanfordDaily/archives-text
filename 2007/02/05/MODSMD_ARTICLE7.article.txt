## Grief group facilitates healing Students find empathy after tragedy strikes 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Grieving for loved ones while
surrounded by driven, optimistic
peers in the perpetual California
sunshine can become emotionally
isolating and logistically challeng
ing, and the Student Grief Group
which met last Thursday for the first
time since the recent death of grad
uate student Mengyao "May" Zhou
aims to help students with this
process and to rebuild a sense of
community after a tragic loss.
"I think that a recurring theme is
that people are very frustrated with
the image of the perfectly happy
Stanford student," said Chris Carlos
'07. who attended last Thursday's
(irief Group session.
Carlos described his reasons for
attending the grief sessions.
"My father passed away |last]
June," he said, "it was very sudden.
He was playing tennis; that's the
sport we played together. He
tripped and fell and hit his head on
the pavement. It was the day after
tny last day of finals spring quarter."
lb cope with his father's death.
( arlos gave up his summer research
project and his senior honors thesis
in order to spend more time at home.
"I had the entire summer to cope
with it and that has allowed me to
grieve." he said. "1 was fortunate. At
Stanford, many feel the pressure to
always place academics before any
thingclsc. which can get in the way of
grieving."
lit provide an outlet for students
like Carlos to express feelings and
emotions after a loss, the Student
('lief Group, a decade-old program,
meets twice a quarter in the Vaden
Health Center and is led by acting
Dean for Religious Life Patricia
karlin Neumann, Residence Dean
lim Cadena and Dr. Jennifer Grego
ry of Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS). Organizers and
student participants alike described
the meetings as relaxed settings
where students can share their per
sonal experiences.
During C iriefC iroup sessions. Kar
lin-Neumann, Cadena and Gregory
provide students with information
about I Jniversity resources available
to grieving students. According to ( a
dena, the Office for Religious Life,
Residential Education and CAPS
each offer unique resources that in
clude academic help, assistance with
taking leaves of absence and one-on
one counseling sessions.
C arlos said that information
about available resources provided
at the (irief C iroup was an important
aid for grieving students but added
that the steps students must take to
get the information were often un
clear and difficult to navigate.

"Everyone deals with loss differ
ently. he said. "There are so many
resources, but some [students] are
uncomfortable with their RAs and
CAPS can be hit or miss."
The Grief Group's participants
and leaders all said that the most
valuable asset the session provided
was a sense of community.
"Most [college-age students]
have not experienced a death," Ca
dena said. "The feelings that come
up when grieving can be strong and
unfamiliar. People come [to the grief
groupj ar| d immediately feel safe be
cause everybody is dealing with the
same thing."
Students who attended the meet
ing described the importance of dis
cussing their experiences with stu
dents who could empathize.
"I think it was good to be able to
separate the worlds in my life." said
Pamela Sud "OS. "It has been a dual
role dealing with [grief] for myself
and as a resident staff member."
"I guess that when you live in a
community with a lot of 20-year
olds: Not many know how to talk
about these issues." she said. "I felt a
lot of sympathy for the other partici
pants."
Both students and organizers
agreed it was important that grieving
students realize that they are not
alone.
"| ITiursday's] group was timely
because of the recent death [of
Zhou] that occurred," Cadena said.
"We encourage anybody and every
body to come. If you think you need
to be in a place to talk about your
feelings, we encourage you to come."
Hie next meeting of the Student
Grief (iroup will be held on lliurs
day. March 1. from 5:30 to 7:00 p.m.
at Vaden. In the spring, a multi-faith
gathering called "Honoring Lives.
