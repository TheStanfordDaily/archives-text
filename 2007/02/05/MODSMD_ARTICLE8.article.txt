## Genetics, depression linked in study 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
There is a genetic component to
early-onset clinical depression, a
new study suggests.
Genetics of Recurrent Early-
Onset Major Depression
(CienRHD). a study coordinated by
l)r Douglas I.evinson. professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences,
lias shown that ;i gene in a small re
gion of Chromosome 15 is probably
responsible for increasing the risk of
early-onset clinical depression, de
spite the influence of environmental
factors.
The study, a joint effort between
Levinson's Stanford-based group
and live other research teams at Co
lumbia, Howard, John Hopkins,
Rush and lowa universities, was the
culmination of two decades of sci
entific work on the genetic influ
ence on psychiatric diseases. ITie
study's findings were published in
two papers in the February issue of
the American Journal of Psychiatry.
ITie primary research technique
used in the study was "positional
cloning," an approach in which the
exact sequence of a gene is located
using its position on the genome.
Iliis technique is necessary for dis
eases like depression, which are dif
ficult to diagnose and have un
known causes.
Levinson said that lie became in
terested in the genetic approach to
studying psychiatric disorders when
scientists began looking at the simi
larities between twins separated at
birth. Striking similarities, like the
tendency to dress alike, were proba
bly genetic and are easy to observe.
But there are also genetic simi
larities that are harder to observe,
and it is through the linking of the
invisible to the observable that
Levinson has been able to trace the
genetic origins of diseases like
schizophrenia and depression.
"That reality blew me away."
Levinson said."lt just fit what 1 was

seeing.
In positional cloning, genes are
located using their proximity to
known "markers" in the genome.
The "markers" are like the obvious
similarities that Levinson uses to
track the invisible genes that cause
diseases. Use of different markers
has allowed scientists to become in
creasingly precise over time. The
original markers were known ge
netic variations like blood type,
which could be assessed clinically,
but Levinson's team turned to sin
gle nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs or "snips").
"You're looking for direct corre
lation between having DNA se
quence variation and getting sick."
Levinson said.
Earlier research on psychiatric
diseases using positional cloning fo
cused on disorders like schizophre
nia or Alzheimer's that were widely
thought to be influenced by genetic
rather than environmental factors.
Depression. Levinson said, is influ
enced by so many variables that
finding a genetic link is like looking
for a needle in a haystack.
SNPs allowed scientists to form
genetic maps detailed enough to
track even the weak genetic influ
ence exerted by diseases like depres
sion. But they did so only in conjunc
tion with extremely large sample
sizes.
"This wasn't possible just four or
five years ago," Levinson said.
Levinson's studv relied on fund

ing from the National Institutes of
Mental Health (NIMH) and on re
cent science that allows researchers
to build a library of human genetic
data for use in studies like
Gen RED. The technique enables
white blood cells to regenerate after
being frozen and stored.
"The GenRED study was one of
the initial studies funded in order to
develop the [NIMH] repository
program." Levinson said.
According to Levinson and Dr.
Jennifer Johnson, who executed
most of the Stanford GenRED
team's clinical work, the sample size
needed for the depression study to
be statistically significant was 1.000
participants. Each participant had
to demonstrate recurrent episodes
of unipolar (rather than bipolar) de
pression that occurred by age 30
and a family history of unipolar de
pression. Participants also had to be
over the age of 21.
Johnson said the study used
brochures in clinics and radio an
nouncements to advertise, but she
added that most participants
seemed happy to help.
"One of the things that is most
striking in interviewing these sub
jects is that they're not doing it for
the money," she said. "I hear time
and time again that these people
say, "My parents had depression, my
grandparents had depression...l'm
scared to death that my children are
going to have depression.'"
"They reallv want to do some

thing to contribute," she added.
Genetic samples and clinical in
formation from the study are per
manently stored at the repository at
NIMH, labeled with identification
numbers so that participants' iden
tities are protected.
In the future, Levinson said, in
creasingly accurate genetic infor
mation may lead pharmaceutical
companies to develop more ad
vanced drugs to treat depression.
Alternatively, scientists could con
trol for known genetic factors to iso
late environmental variables that
contribute to the likelihood of de
pression. Levinson is planning to
run another study, this time with an
even larger sample size.
Levinson said that the findings
could eventually lead to advances in
the treatment of early-onset depres
sion. This particular form of depres
sion. he said, affects three to four
percent of the population and can
lead to suicide. Patients with de
pression. he said, describe "losing a
sense of enjoyment in things."

"One of the things that is most
striking in interviewing these sub
jects is that they're not doing it for
the money," she said. "I hear time
and time again that these people
say, "My parents had depression, my
grandparents had depression...l'm
scared to death that my children are
going to have depression.'"
"They reallv want to do some

thing to contribute," she added.
Genetic samples and clinical in
formation from the study are per
manently stored at the repository at
NIMH, labeled with identification
numbers so that participants' iden
tities are protected.
In the future, Levinson said, in
creasingly accurate genetic infor
mation may lead pharmaceutical
companies to develop more ad
vanced drugs to treat depression.
Alternatively, scientists could con
trol for known genetic factors to iso
late environmental variables that
contribute to the likelihood of de
pression. Levinson is planning to
run another study, this time with an
even larger sample size.
Levinson said that the findings
could eventually lead to advances in
the treatment of early-onset depres
sion. This particular form of depres
sion. he said, affects three to four
percent of the population and can
lead to suicide. Patients with de
pression. he said, describe "losing a
sense of enjoyment in things."
