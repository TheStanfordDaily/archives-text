aging more dialogue within the organization.
"It is a big order — our purpose is to bring overarch
ing planning and evaluation to the NIH." he said. "We
plan to identify important areas of emerging scientific
opportunities or rising public health challenges and to
help accelerate investments in these areas to make sure
new ideas have a chance to develop."
Krensky is enthusiastic when he describes how he en
visions his new role at the federal agency.
"Today's scientific advances are largely interdiscipli
nary." he said."With our facilitation, the NIH has the op

fields."
Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni, the Institute's director echoed
these sentiments in his support of the new appointee.

Portfolio Analysis and Strategic Initiatives provides an
'incubator space' to address critical research efforts in
cross-cutting areas of NIH priorities."
