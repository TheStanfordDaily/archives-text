## Editorial Board For open kitchens, accountability is key 
### 
For Stanford undergraduates, the prime
draw of living in row housing or Suites
has long been the student-managed
eating clubs and kitchens. In years past, self
ops with popular chefs have boasted low
cut-offs in the draw, while co-ops have con
tinued to attract more students every year,
many of them eager to partake in organic,
home-cooked meals. What makes student
managed dining such a universally appeal
ing option is likely the open kitchen, which
makes snacks, cereals, and beverages readi
ly available 24/7. In exchange for the variety
of dishes available through a Stanford Din
ing plan, self-ops and co-ops offer residents
a larger degree of flexibility in their eating
habits, allowing them to eat what they want,
when they want, and to prepare their own
food.
Quarterly board bills vary widely be
tween kitchens, ranging from $600 to $700 in
the vegetarian co-ops to upwards of $1500
in some of the pricier self-ops. While board
bills also reflect social programming fees,
the bulk of the money goes toward paying
the chef, hiring hashers, buying staple foods,
and stocking the open kitchen. Kitchen
money is managed jointly by the financial
manager and by the kitchen manager, with
the brunt of the task falling on the latter.
That task can be at times overwhelming.
Kitchen managers are responsible for hiring
and supervising the chef, training hashers,
planning meals, overseeing bulk purchases,
stocking the open kitchen and ensuring that
the kitchen complies with health-code regu
lations. The work is taxing and constant: a
virtual balancing act between the demands
of house members, suppliers and staff.
Because the job requires such a great
deal of coordination and communication,
kitchen managers-in-training are appren
ticed to current managers during the spring

and also receive training through the Row
office and Student Organized Services pro
gram. becoming food-handler certified in
the process. Since the position comes with
no official prerequisites other than ex
pressed interest, the quality of that training
process may translate into the quality of the
service provided. Unfortunately,some man
agers claim that the guidance provided by
the University is not adequate to prepare
them for the demands of the job. iiiis may
be part of the reason that the quality be
tween open kitchens can vary so dramati
cally.
As any student who has sampled from a
variety of eating clubs will tell you, there are
some genuinely amazing open kitchens and
others that hardly seem like kitchens at all.
There are those that are always stocked and
somehow manage to strike that delicate bal
ance between snack food and substance.
Walk into one and you'll probably find an
overflowing fruit bowl next to a full-on
sandwich bar. Dig into the freezer, and
you'll find fried cheese puffs wedged be
tween gourmet sausage and Chinese
eggrolls. a variety of frozen yogurts and ice
creams to the left, and a store of hummus
and spreads down below. ITien there are
those other kitchens, which seem to either
have an abundance of low-quality food, or
to be always running out of food — or.
worst of all, to always be running out of low
quality food. It's hard not to wonder how
kitchens with comparable board bills can
differ so widely in quality.
The problem seems to be one of account
ability. What makes for a good open kitchen
depends to a large extent on the skill and ef
fort of the manager, but after the manager is
selected and trained.there is little in the wav

of quality oversight or control. The
University regulations in place are
minimal and leave kitchen managers
with a great deal of autonomy in
their weekly purchasing decisions.
Further, internal oversight by
other managers — the financial
manager in houses and a general eat
ing club manager in Suites — is gen
erally a hands-off affair.This appears
to be in part because managers in
self-ops are in many cases hand
picked by the RA, meaning that
house positions are often filled by a
tight-knit circle of friends. This kind
of system has its pitfalls. While cama
raderie between managers can make
for a cohesive, social atmosphere, it
does not so easily lend itself to ac
countability, transparency or effec
tive oversight.
While there is the occasional tale
of the kitchen manager "skimming
off the top," or dipping into kitchen
funds to buy alcohol, it seems likely
that mediocre open kitchens are
more often the result of inexperi
ence and mismanagement than out
right fraud. In either case, there are a
number of productive strategies
house members or eating associates
can adopt to try to turn the situation
around. In instances where money
seems to be disappearing, a non-staff
member should be elected to con
duct an internal audit of kitchen fi
nances, checking receipts against
budget allotments.
One of the problems with the
standard suggestion sheet is that stu

dents may request expensive items
that run out quickly and prevent the
purchase of other, widely liked and
less expensive alternatives. Another
problem is that suggestion sheets
allow people to make multiple re
quests within a given area: say, junk
food. One person might request
Twizzlers, another might ask for
Starbursts and another might call for
Fruit Roll-Ups, until all there is is
candy.
The mark of a good kitchen is a
healthy balance between tasty treats
and more substantial options, and
this cannot be achieved if everyone
gets their favorite candy every week.
The basic categories — including
such items as cereals and granola,
breads, fruits and vegetables, eggs,
milk, juice, yogurt, basic snack foods
like candy and crackers, and substan
tial snack foods like enchiladas and
chicken wings — should be avail
able through out the week. Resi
dents can suggest the kind and qual
ity of such items, but expensive sug
gestions should never prevent a cat
egory from being adequately
stocked. In the case that there is ad
ditional money for specialty items,
they should only be bought it they
are supported by a substantial num
ber of residents or required by a
food allergy.
ITiese are just a few suggestions
that may be helpful in turning
around a lackluster open kitchen.
The most important step in the
process is starting a dialogue with
the kitchen manager to ensure that
the basic needs of the house are met.
The bottom line is that board bills
can be very expensive and, student
managed or not, open kitchens
should be done right.

The basic categories — including
such items as cereals and granola,
breads, fruits and vegetables, eggs,
milk, juice, yogurt, basic snack foods
like candy and crackers, and substan
tial snack foods like enchiladas and
chicken wings — should be avail
able through out the week. Resi
dents can suggest the kind and qual
ity of such items, but expensive sug
gestions should never prevent a cat

stocked. In the case that there is ad

they should only be bought it they
are supported by a substantial num

The most important step in the

the kitchen manager to ensure that
the basic needs of the house are met.
The bottom line is that board bills
can be very expensive and, student
managed or not, open kitchens
should be done right.
For Stanford undergraduates, the prime
draw of living in row housing or Suites
has long been the student-managed
eating clubs and kitchens. In years past, self
ops with popular chefs have boasted low
cut-offs in the draw, while co-ops have con
tinued to attract more students every year,
many of them eager to partake in organic,
home-cooked meals. What makes student
managed dining such a universally appeal
ing option is likely the open kitchen, which
makes snacks, cereals, and beverages readi
ly available 24/7. In exchange for the variety
of dishes available through a Stanford Din
ing plan, self-ops and co-ops offer residents
a larger degree of flexibility in their eating
habits, allowing them to eat what they want,
when they want, and to prepare their own
food.
Quarterly board bills vary widely be
tween kitchens, ranging from $600 to $700 in
the vegetarian co-ops to upwards of $1500
in some of the pricier self-ops. While board
bills also reflect social programming fees,
the bulk of the money goes toward paying
the chef, hiring hashers, buying staple foods,
and stocking the open kitchen. Kitchen
money is managed jointly by the financial
manager and by the kitchen manager, with
the brunt of the task falling on the latter.
That task can be at times overwhelming.
Kitchen managers are responsible for hiring
and supervising the chef, training hashers,
planning meals, overseeing bulk purchases,
stocking the open kitchen and ensuring that
the kitchen complies with health-code regu
lations. The work is taxing and constant: a
virtual balancing act between the demands
of house members, suppliers and staff.
Because the job requires such a great
deal of coordination and communication,
kitchen managers-in-training are appren
ticed to current managers during the spring

and also receive training through the Row
office and Student Organized Services pro
gram. becoming food-handler certified in
the process. Since the position comes with
no official prerequisites other than ex
pressed interest, the quality of that training
process may translate into the quality of the
service provided. Unfortunately,some man
agers claim that the guidance provided by
the University is not adequate to prepare
them for the demands of the job. iiiis may
be part of the reason that the quality be
tween open kitchens can vary so dramati
cally.
As any student who has sampled from a
variety of eating clubs will tell you, there are
some genuinely amazing open kitchens and
others that hardly seem like kitchens at all.
There are those that are always stocked and
somehow manage to strike that delicate bal
ance between snack food and substance.
Walk into one and you'll probably find an
overflowing fruit bowl next to a full-on
sandwich bar. Dig into the freezer, and
you'll find fried cheese puffs wedged be
tween gourmet sausage and Chinese
eggrolls. a variety of frozen yogurts and ice
creams to the left, and a store of hummus
and spreads down below. ITien there are
those other kitchens, which seem to either
have an abundance of low-quality food, or
to be always running out of food — or.
worst of all, to always be running out of low
quality food. It's hard not to wonder how
kitchens with comparable board bills can
differ so widely in quality.
The problem seems to be one of account
ability. What makes for a good open kitchen
depends to a large extent on the skill and ef
fort of the manager, but after the manager is
selected and trained.there is little in the wav

of quality oversight or control. The
University regulations in place are
minimal and leave kitchen managers
with a great deal of autonomy in
their weekly purchasing decisions.
Further, internal oversight by
other managers — the financial
manager in houses and a general eat
ing club manager in Suites — is gen
erally a hands-off affair.This appears
to be in part because managers in
self-ops are in many cases hand
picked by the RA, meaning that
house positions are often filled by a
tight-knit circle of friends. This kind
of system has its pitfalls. While cama
raderie between managers can make
for a cohesive, social atmosphere, it
does not so easily lend itself to ac
countability, transparency or effec
tive oversight.
While there is the occasional tale
of the kitchen manager "skimming
off the top," or dipping into kitchen
funds to buy alcohol, it seems likely
that mediocre open kitchens are
more often the result of inexperi
ence and mismanagement than out
right fraud. In either case, there are a
number of productive strategies
house members or eating associates
can adopt to try to turn the situation
around. In instances where money
seems to be disappearing, a non-staff
member should be elected to con
duct an internal audit of kitchen fi
nances, checking receipts against
budget allotments.
One of the problems with the
standard suggestion sheet is that stu

dents may request expensive items
that run out quickly and prevent the
purchase of other, widely liked and
less expensive alternatives. Another
problem is that suggestion sheets
allow people to make multiple re
quests within a given area: say, junk
food. One person might request
Twizzlers, another might ask for
Starbursts and another might call for
Fruit Roll-Ups, until all there is is
candy.

healthy balance between tasty treats
and more substantial options, and
this cannot be achieved if everyone
