## Editorial Board For open kitchens, accountability is key 
### 
For Stanford undergraduates, the prime
draw of living in row housing or Suites
has long been the student-managed
eating clubs and kitchens. In years past, self
ops with popular chefs have boasted low
cut-offs in the draw, while co-ops have con
tinued to attract more students every year,
many of them eager to partake in organic,
home-cooked meals. What makes student
managed dining such a universally appeal
ing option is likely the open kitchen, which
makes snacks, cereals, and beverages readi
ly available 24/7. In exchange for the variety
of dishes available through a Stanford Din
ing plan, self-ops and co-ops offer residents
a larger degree of flexibility in their eating
habits, allowing them to eat what they want,
when they want, and to prepare their own
food.
Quarterly board bills vary widely be
tween kitchens, ranging from $600 to $700 in
the vegetarian co-ops to upwards of $1500
in some of the pricier self-ops. While board
bills also reflect social programming fees,
the bulk of the money goes toward paying
the chef, hiring hashers, buying staple foods,
and stocking the open kitchen. Kitchen
money is managed jointly by the financial
manager and by the kitchen manager, with
the brunt of the task falling on the latter.
That task can be at times overwhelming.
Kitchen managers are responsible for hiring
and supervising the chef, training hashers,
planning meals, overseeing bulk purchases,
stocking the open kitchen and ensuring that
the kitchen complies with health-code regu
lations. The work is taxing and constant: a
virtual balancing act between the demands
of house members, suppliers and staff.
Because the job requires such a great
deal of coordination and communication,
kitchen managers-in-training are appren
ticed to current managers during the spring

and also receive training through the Row
office and Student Organized Services pro
gram. becoming food-handler certified in
the process. Since the position comes with
no official prerequisites other than ex
pressed interest, the quality of that training
process may translate into the quality of the
service provided. Unfortunately,some man
agers claim that the guidance provided by
the University is not adequate to prepare
them for the demands of the job. iiiis may
be part of the reason that the quality be
tween open kitchens can vary so dramati
cally.
As any student who has sampled from a
variety of eating clubs will tell you, there are
some genuinely amazing open kitchens and
others that hardly seem like kitchens at all.
There are those that are always stocked and
somehow manage to strike that delicate bal
ance between snack food and substance.
Walk into one and you'll probably find an
overflowing fruit bowl next to a full-on
sandwich bar. Dig into the freezer, and
you'll find fried cheese puffs wedged be
tween gourmet sausage and Chinese
eggrolls. a variety of frozen yogurts and ice
creams to the left, and a store of hummus
and spreads down below. ITien there are
those other kitchens, which seem to either
have an abundance of low-quality food, or
to be always running out of food â€” or.
worst of all, to always be running out of low
quality food. It's hard not to wonder how
kitchens with comparable board bills can
differ so widely in quality.
The problem seems to be one of account
ability. What makes for a good open kitchen
depends to a large extent on the skill and ef
fort of the manager, but after the manager is
selected and trained.there is little in the wav
