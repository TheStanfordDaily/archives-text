# Righteous entitlement

### 
This was supposed to be a satiric re
sponse to the administration's glori
ously underwhelming choice of a
Commencement speaker. I was all set to
make a list of speakers who could deliver
better, more inspiring speeches than Dana
Gioia (1: My Ass:2:T.S. Eliot's Corpse;3:This
week's episode of "Heroes"; 4: T.S. Eliot's
Corpse's Ass). But then 1 met Arthur.
I was up at around 4 a.m. scanning the
Daily's Web site. There were two or three
more op-eds about that Israel thing, which is
apparently CRAZY controversial. (God ap
pears to support both sides, that wily old two
timer.) A classmate named Megan Reiss had
written ;i passionate letter begging for a high
er caliber of Commencement speaker.
Megan said everything 1 was going to say. ex
cept without the smug.
Hut there was Arthur. On the bottom of
the letter. Arthur had written that "the anger
over not having a big celebrity is a bit embar
rassing and does not reflect well on Stanford
students."
Arthur: who said that Dana Gioia "has
achieved much more than the ungrateful
members of the graduating class ever wi11...
they are full of themselves and they should
have never been admitted to Stanford."
Arthur: who also referred to the class of
'07 as "self-important," "childish." "embar
rassing." "arrogant" and "bratty" in several
dozen wall postings scattered across the
Daily's wallosphere.
Arthur: my enemy, and I pray yours, too.
I have an instant reaction to a man who
says that a passionate emotion felt by hun
dreds of people "does not reflect well" upon
them: a sudden urge to stuff a plasma
grenade down his throat and watch it explode
out of his self-righteous ass. It's a terrible
thing to realize that someone your own age
has already become a grandma.
Being a man of quick passion and light
forethought, 1 posted a response to Arthur...
"We're allowed to want a celebrity at our
graduation. We're humble 99 percent of the
year, but by god, if I'm going to have some
body tell me stupid bullshit about life after
graduation. I want that someone to be fa

mous as hell. We're unhappy with our no
name commencement speaker, and that re
flects poorly on us? Jesus Christ. Arthur,
we're only human, not robots like you!"
...which was meant to be both funny and
true, like almost everything I write that no
body but my older brother understands.
Arthur responded within minutes from
high atop his keyboard soapbox: "What re
flects poorly on us is the self-important, arro
gant, and bratty attitude of entitlement." Ah.
the crux of the matter.
Entitlement, ladies and gentlemen, the
shadow we cannot escape, the giant
douchebag halo hovering over our fat heads,
out out damned spot! When we truthfully yell
"Safety School!" at Big Game, those plague
stricken hand-to-mouth Dickensian orphans
from Berkeley screech that we're stuck-up
brats. When we complain that the alcohol
policy hasmorphed from logical toOrwellian
in just under a decade, the administration
fires back."What, you think you're above the
law just because you pay us an exorbitant
sum of Palm Tree fertilizer? Naughty
naughty, little children."
And when we make the frankly unfussy
request for a Commencement speaker who is
known to more than one half of one percent
of the senior class, Arthur and his ilk scream.
"Such arrogance! Don't you know he's one
of the two hundred most important poets
working today? Don't you know he's written
for The New Yorker AND The New York
Times?"
Taking Arthur's words to heart, I looked
Dana up. 1 le writes decent poetry — he's no
Seamus I leaney. but he's got an ear for casu
al sorrow ("Summer Storm" was the best I
found, flawed, but the killer last lines fuse to

your soul.) His 6-step guide to making poet
ry popular again is naive (#6: "Use Radio to
expand the art's influence" — that's Poetry
on the Radio, youth demographic!), but pas
sionate. and I am helplessly in love with lost
causes (supporting Democrats,chasing beau
tiful girls, freezing time), so he's got that
going for him. In fact, 1 see a bit of myself in
the guy: We both read F.dgar Rice Burroughs
in elementary school; we both hid that fact
from everyone, guessing at a young age that
Martian Princesses and spaceships would
never be attractive.
Here's the thing, though: I don't want
somebody like me delivering the Com
mencement speech, the same way I don't
want somebody like me in the White House
or holding a deadly weapon. Commence
ment speeches are lame by nature. Hie
speaker doesn't know me, what college was
like for me, if 1 fell in love, found my calling,
went Republican, went gay. They don't care
whether I change the world or get a job or
move home and spend the trust fund on a
PS3. They will deliver vague, meaningless
platitudes, and 1 will lap it up. because at
graduation — like at your wedding and your
first orgasm — everything is amazing. But by
gum. I want someone incredibly, famously ac
complished to deliver those vague, meaning
less platitudes. I want a fucking demi-god. J
want to drink in the reflected glory of a bril
liant newscaster, a Supreme Court Justice, a
Secretary of State. Iliere is no comparison
between Kofi Annan, the 2000 speaker, and
Dana Gioia. Anyone who says there is barely
qualifies for freedom of speech.
You know what, Arthur? 1 worked hard in
school ever since first grade. I had a god
damned lonely childhood, me and my comic
books, a loneliness that spurred an interest in
expressing myself through the written word
(because I didn't stutter when 1 typed). I
would gladly give that back if 1 could've ever
once in my young life felt normal. I didn't; 1
studied through high school, spent four
months on college applications, and wound
up here. 1 was lucky — I grew up in pleasant
