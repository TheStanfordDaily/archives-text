Yale has out-greened us.
Within a year of its 2005 commit
ment to substantially cutting its
greenhouse gas emissions. Yale managed
to lower its greenhouse gas output by (■>%.
a huge achievement that was followed by
Yale President Richard Levin's announce
ment that he planned to make Yale the na
tion's greenest university. In stark con
trast. Stanford doesn't even have an offi
cial plan for reducing its greenhouse gas
emissions.
Although it's incredibly disappointing
that Stanford doesn't have a formal plan for
increasing its sustainability, the University
has made constructive moves toward in
creasing the sustainability not only of the
University, but of the world at large.
On the large scale. Stanford has allocat
ed $250 million of the $4.3 billion (yet to be
raised) Stanford Challenge funds to the Ini
tiative on the Environment and Sustain
ability The Initiative is intended to provide
money for students and researchers com
mitted to tackling the global challenges of
"providing the resources we need without
irrevocably compromising our precious
life-support systems."
On the small scale, Stanford has seen on
campus movements toward sustainability.
including the Woods Institute's energy-effi
cient Environment and Energy Building
(currently under construction), and Stan
ford Dining's recently announced plan to
develop a biodiesel waste vegetable oil re
cycling system. But what we're missing is a
formal plan to organize all of these small
scale efforts.
It's foolishly optimistic to believe that,
without a formal plan. Stanford will magi
cally make substantial moves toward sus
tainability. We. as a University, need the
structure and accountability that a formal
plan provides in order to make real strides
toward increasing our sustainability and de
creasing our carbon output. It is neither eth
ical nor prudent for Stanford to continue in
its development as an institution without a
coherent plan for dealing with environmen
tal degradation and climate change.
It seems to me that the best way to begin
is by making a formal commitment, as Yak
did. to reducing our greenhouse gas emis
sions. And efforts in this direction are cur
rently being made; the Stanford Climate
Change Campaign is currently circulating a
petition to the administration that asks,
among other things, for the University to
commit to a 10% reduction in greenhouse
gas outputs from I WO levels by the year
2020. This is the same goal to which Yale
committed in 2005. (For more information
on the petition, visit ccc.stanford.edu.)
Although significantly reducing our car
bon footprint isn't going to be easy, it also
isn't going to be impossible. There are con
crete, feasible changes to which the Stan

ford community can commit in order to de
crease greenhouse gas output. Measures
that Yale, for example, has successfully en
acted include the use of biofuel busses, fuel
cells,compact fluorescent bulbs and motion
sensors on lights. Yale has also gotten over
2.000 students to commit to reducing their
personal energy use. ITiese changes are
ones that Stanford can easily make and
even improve upon.
It we're shying away from an official
commitment to greenhouse gas reduction
because its too costly, then we need to think
again. Lowering greenhouse gas emissions
can go hand in hand with long-term savings.
Creating energy efficient buildings, putting
better seals on windows, maximizing heat
ing efficiency, distributing fluorescent bulbs
and other measures will all lead to long
term reduced energy consumption, thus si
multaneously lowering Stanford's green
house gas emissions and cutting Stanford's
energy costs. A win-win solution is ab
solutely possible.
rhere will, however, be short-term ex
penses that can't be ignored. But if the ad
ministration is willing to shell out $250 mil
lion for the Initiative on the Environment
and Sustainability, then surely it will also
have the foresight to make a down payment
on our ultimate sustainability as a universi
ty.
It seems foolish for Stanford to ask its
students, faculty, and donors to contribute
to a worldwide push for greenhouse gas re
duction while Stanford itself, as an institu
tion and as a microcosm of society, is doing
less than it can and should. It is only through
making small changes that we will be able to
build toward a greener future and inspire
even greater changes.
It is for this reason that we need immedi
ate action from the members of the Stan
ford community. We need the administra
tion to formally commit to reducing Stan
ford's greenhouse gas emissions, but if we
don't see action on this issue, it's up to the
faculty, the staff, the alumni and the stu
dents to demand that the administration
make this commitment.
We must not be out-greened.
