## Success and mental illness are not mutually exclusive 
### ADAM KAHN 
1 love being on stage — not as an actor,
but as myself. 1 love giving speeches. 1 was
fortunate enough to have the opportunity to
do so on multiple occasions last year as direc
tor of the ASSU Speakers Bureau. I loved in
troducing our invited guests. However, the
two speeches 1 am most proud of came on the
stage of MemAud in during New Student
Orientation in the fall of 2(M)4 and fall of
2(M)5. In front of crowds of 17(H) people, 1 told
people about my history with mental illness,
specifically bipolar disorder (also known as
manic-depression).
I entered my senior year of high school at
the top of my class. I ended it barely graduat
ing. Depression made it impossible for me to
complete my schoolwork on time, if at all.
When I got to Stanford, I thought my high
school problems would all of a sudden disap
pear.
The fall of my freshman year was rough. I
failed I HUM my first quarter here, 1 thought
the only help 1 needed was medication. My
parents wanted me in psychotherapy since
my psychiatrist only did med management.
Hut no—l thought I was still the same
Adam from a few years before who could do
anything academically he wanted.
Over the next two years. I piled on incom
plete after incomplete. Each quarter I told
myself "Next quarter things will be back to
normal." And with every quarter came in
completes. Even v\hen I was placed on Acad
emic Probation, I didn't worry much.
I entered the fall of my junior year having
four incompletes. I finally allowed myself to
take a reduced course load and I utilized a
writing tutor. I started psychotherapy. And I
thought I'd be fine because I was finally on a
perfect med regimen that made me the hap

piest I was in a long time.
But it was too late at that point. Because
of all the incompletes, 1 was too anxious to
112 inish the quarter. Due to my lack of academ
ic progress. Academic Standing placed me on
it one-year academic suspension.
During my suspension, at first my depres
sion spiraled downhill.Things got so bad that
my parents made me enter a continuing day
treatment program at a local psychiatric hos
pital. Slowly, but surely, with the skills I was
being taught in treatment. 1 learned to take
control of my life. I was able to prove to the
school, and more importantly to myself, that
I was well enough to return a quarter early
from my suspension. Upon my return. 1
pulled off a mighty fine quarter — turning all
my work in on time for the first time in over
four years.
Almost a year later. I took to the stage of
MemAud and told the incoming freshman
class about my experiences. Soon after, al
most two years to the day that I found out I
was suspended. 1 was accepted to a coterm
program. Last year, I graduated with a B.S. in
computer science, a B.A. in history, and an
M.A. in communication, with a 3.6 under
graduate GPA and a 3.9 graduate GPA.
However. I don't care about the number
of degrees or the GPAs. I just care that I grad
uated. These numbers are just a testament
that mental illness does not need to stand in
the way of somebody's academic success.
I'm not afraid to tell my story. I've spo
ken at I ACKS of Community twice and
talked to smaller groups as well. I even
wrote a book this summer and hope to find
a publisher. I put my speeches on my Stan
ford Web space for the world to see. and
every now and then I get emails from
strangers telling me how much my story
sounds like their own. Many of these emails

come from students who go to other presti
gious schools, such as Penn and Columbia,
and students of all ages, from freshmen to
doctoral students.To say that smart students
can t suffer from mental illness or to isolate
the "duck syndrome" to Stanford would he
a fallacy.
for all the articles The Daily, the San Fran
cisco C hronicle and other periodicals publish
about campus suicide and mental health
problems, they neglect stories like mine: the
success stories. Instead they focus on how
mental health problems are on the rise on
college campuses and how students are not
getting help out of shame. Maybe if more stu
dents knew that having a mental illness only
has to be a temporary road block in their ac
ademic pursuits, more would be willing to
seek help.
My story might make it sound easy to
overcome the challenges of mental illness,
but it takes a lot of hard work, determination
and (to some extent) even luck. While I'm a
testament that you can get better, you can't
get better without help — be it professional
help or help from your friends. Not once have
I had anybody at Stanford judge me for being
bipolar. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
You might think that somebody who
speaks about mental illness as much as I do
would know all the statistics about suicide
and mental health on college campuses.
However, I don't know these statistics be
cause I have not let myself become one.
