## Pinning the competition 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
I lie Cardinal wrestlers continued their Pacific-10 Con
ference dominance on Friday, as they leveled the competi
tion with i unaway victories in a pair of duals against Oregon
and Cal Poly at Burnham Pavilion. Despite the fast start to a
crucial month of competition. Stanford head coach Kerry
Me( oy s;iid he still believes his team has yet to reach its full
potential.

"()verall. we did well,"
McCoy snid. "We didn't
wrestle our best, and we
shouldn't be wrestling our
best yet. We're not taking
anybody lightly, but this is
the kind of performance
we need in order to be
ready for the end of the

year.
With the Pac-10 tournament looming on Feb. 24, and just
four duals between now and then. McCoy had to be encour
aged by his team's showing. The Cardinal (6-5.4-1 Pac-10)
opened their evening of competition with a 26-12 win over
Oregon (6 11. 1-7) and followed through later that night
with a 25-13 victory over Cal Poly (5-5.4-3).
1 lie Stanford (oach had emphasized that his team need
ed to "defend the gym" prior to the home duals.and the Car
dinal went into the weekend to do just that.
"I think that we definitely proved that we deserved to win
both of them," said No. 16 junior Josh Zupancie. who wres
tled at 157 pounds. "Being 4-1 now in the Pac-10 is a good
record."

For the most part. Stanford succeeded in the spots tor
which it was expected, as No. 3 junior Tanner Gardner (125
pounds),senior Brian IVii\ (I (>5 pounds), sophomore Luke
Feist (174 pounds) and true-freshman Zack Geisen (184
pounds) each earned two victories on the night.
Freshman C anieron leitclmunn. wrestling at 133 pounds,
and sophomore Jared Hover at 197 pounds were also unde
feated on the night. But both wrestled just one match apiece,
as Boyer took a forfeit against Cal Poly, and Teitelmann did
not wrestle against Oregon due to his recovery Irom an ill
ness.
Gardner's wins for the Cardinal were especially impres
sive. as he won a 16-4 major decision over Oregon's Ryan
Dunn and earned a 17-2 tech fall over the Mustangs' Joshua

()bregon to improve his season record to 29-3 with nine pins.
Despite Gardner's fantastic record coming into the
evening's competition. McCoy said that he expects even fur
ther improvement from his junior standout.
"It's always funny because Tanner gets the motor going
as the match rolls along,"he said."l tell him he gets stubborn
at the beginning of a match because he wants everything to
go the way he wants it to go. Against Oregon he came out
strong right away, and that's the first time we've seen that in
a long time. |( )bregon] was a little different, and he had to
make some adjustments. I told him that's what it's going to
take to be a national champion."
