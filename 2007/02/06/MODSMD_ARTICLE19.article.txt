## Pinning the competition 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
I lie Cardinal wrestlers continued their Pacific-10 Con
ference dominance on Friday, as they leveled the competi
tion with i unaway victories in a pair of duals against Oregon
and Cal Poly at Burnham Pavilion. Despite the fast start to a
crucial month of competition. Stanford head coach Kerry
Me( oy s;iid he still believes his team has yet to reach its full
potential.

"()verall. we did well,"
McCoy snid. "We didn't
wrestle our best, and we
shouldn't be wrestling our
best yet. We're not taking
anybody lightly, but this is
the kind of performance
we need in order to be
ready for the end of the

year.
With the Pac-10 tournament looming on Feb. 24, and just
four duals between now and then. McCoy had to be encour
aged by his team's showing. The Cardinal (6-5.4-1 Pac-10)
opened their evening of competition with a 26-12 win over
Oregon (6 11. 1-7) and followed through later that night
with a 25-13 victory over Cal Poly (5-5.4-3).
1 lie Stanford (oach had emphasized that his team need
ed to "defend the gym" prior to the home duals.and the Car
dinal went into the weekend to do just that.
"I think that we definitely proved that we deserved to win
both of them," said No. 16 junior Josh Zupancie. who wres
tled at 157 pounds. "Being 4-1 now in the Pac-10 is a good
record."

For the most part. Stanford succeeded in the spots tor
which it was expected, as No. 3 junior Tanner Gardner (125
pounds),senior Brian IVii\ (I (>5 pounds), sophomore Luke
Feist (174 pounds) and true-freshman Zack Geisen (184
pounds) each earned two victories on the night.
Freshman C anieron leitclmunn. wrestling at 133 pounds,
and sophomore Jared Hover at 197 pounds were also unde
feated on the night. But both wrestled just one match apiece,
as Boyer took a forfeit against Cal Poly, and Teitelmann did
not wrestle against Oregon due to his recovery Irom an ill
ness.
Gardner's wins for the Cardinal were especially impres
sive. as he won a 16-4 major decision over Oregon's Ryan
Dunn and earned a 17-2 tech fall over the Mustangs' Joshua

()bregon to improve his season record to 29-3 with nine pins.
Despite Gardner's fantastic record coming into the
evening's competition. McCoy said that he expects even fur
ther improvement from his junior standout.
"It's always funny because Tanner gets the motor going
as the match rolls along,"he said."l tell him he gets stubborn
at the beginning of a match because he wants everything to
go the way he wants it to go. Against Oregon he came out
strong right away, and that's the first time we've seen that in
a long time. |( )bregon] was a little different, and he had to
make some adjustments. I told him that's what it's going to
take to be a national champion."

Freshman Cameron Teitelmann grapples for position against Cal Poly's John Hanks. Teitelmann, weighing in at 133 pounds,
took the 7-6 decision in his only match of the evening, helping Stanford emerge victorious over the Pac-10 rival Mustangs.
As striking as Gardner's contin
ued run of dominance was, another
strong performer for the Card suf
fered a disappointing loss in his
second match of the evening. Zu
pancic, ranked second in the Pac
-10, dropped a close 3-1 match in
overtime to Cal Poly's Chase Pami,
who was ranked third in the con
ference.
Zupancic had sat out last week's
exhibition against Menlo College
because of a knee injury, and it ap
peared that the same knee gave
him trouble in Friday's matches.
The loss could have significant im
plications for Pac-10 tournament
seedings.
"My knee's a little banged up. but
he was just better than me today,"
Zupancic said in reference to his op
ponent, Pami. "I had trouble with
him in the finals of the Cal Open,
too, and 1 really just didn't make the
improvements 1 needed to to get the
win."

McCoy expected Zupancic to
move forward based on the experi
ence he gained from the match.
"He tweaked his knee in the first
match, and in hindsight we could
have probably held him out [of the
second match]," McCoy said. "But
he looked ready. He was a little
banged up. but he might be a little
banged up in the conference or na
tional tournament. He's got to win
those close matches if he wants to be
a conference champ, a national
champ. But he'll learn from it â€”
he'll improve.
"Obviously it's all practice until
the end of the year, but we didn't
want to give up that one," McCoy
continued. "Its disappointing, but
he's got to get that experience and
he can learn from it. We'd rather
have it now than have it in three
weeks."
The Cardinal will hit the road this
weekend to take part in three more
Pac-10 duals. Stanford will face
Boise State on Friday evening, fol
lowed by Oregon State and Portland
State on Sundav.
