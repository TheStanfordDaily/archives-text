## Industry support increases Stanford ranks third in country for funding 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Industry funding for academic re
search increased in 2005 af.er a
three-year decline, according to data
compiled by the National Science
Foundation.
The Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion reported last week that industry
funding reached a record high of $2.3
billion in 2005, a 7.7 percent increase
over the previous year.
Despite this increase, industry
funding covers only five percent of
academic research. Federal funding
— which provided $29.2 billion in
2005 — is the primary source of sup
port. State and local governments
and institutions also provide signifi
cant sources of funding for academic
research.
Stanford received the third high
est amount of federal academic
funding in 2005, with a total of
$574,675,000. Only Johns Hopkins
University (just under $1.3 billion)
and the University of Washington
(just over $600 million) received
more money.
Though industry funding makes
up only a small percentage of fund
ing on the national scale. Chemical
Engineering Asst. Prof. Charles Mus
grave said industry support is
stronger at Stanford than at most
other universities. Musgrave attrib
uted this to the University's tradition
of helping students and alumni start
companies, such as Google and Sun
Microsystems.
"Industry support is not typically
strong." he said. "Stanford is one of
the most fortunate universities in the
level of industry funding we do get."
Musgrave noted the intense com
petition for funding, especially over
the past decade, as science depart
ments have grown and more schools
have developed programs and en
tered the funding scramble.
"There is more and more faculty
fighting for a research funding pie
