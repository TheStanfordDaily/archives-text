### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
I or the third time this season, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team needed a tie
breaking fifth game to end a match. And for
the Inst time, the Cardinal came out on top.
After losing in three games to No. 12 Long
Reach State (5-5,3-4 Mountain Pacific Sports
federation) on Friday, Stanford (1-11, 1-6)
jumped out to a two-game lead against DC-
San Diego (3-6. 1-6) and held on to win the
match with a 15 II win in game five.
I lie win marked the end of an 11-game
skid for the Cardinal, which included a pair
ol heartbreaking filth-game losses during
the preseason.The win this weekend should
boost the confidence of a young Stanford
team that has struggled to put together a
complete game.

"For our guys, they have competed in
every single game this season as hard as they
can go." head coach John Kosty said. "And.
they have been getting better and better in
each game. This justifies for them that they
can do it and that they are good enough to
win in our league."
The trio of junior outside hitter Matt
Ceran, freshman right-side hitter Hvan
Romero and sophomore middle blocker
Brandon Williams headed the Stanford of
fense with more than 20 kills apiece on the
weekend. Williams hit .500 in the win over
UCSD (18 kills) and Romero chipped in 14
kills in each match. Ceran was quiet against
the 49ers on Friday, but he did post a team
high 21 kills against the Tritons.
"Matt Ceran won the fifth game for us."
kosty said of the junior's role in the team's
victory over UCSD. "Matt played a good
match and had a very good fifth game."
The Cardinal started the weekend slowly,
dropping the first game to I .ong Beach State
while hitting negative as ;t team. ITie 49ers
took the lead on the first point of the game
and ran away with it. leading 14-6 before

winning the frame 30-18.
Stanford bounced back in the second
game, with almost twice as many kills as in
the first. The 49ers, however, stepped their
play up a level and made only a single hitting
error en route to the 30-23 victory.
I lie Cardinal put up its best offensive
numbers in the third game and held the
49ers to their worst,but il was not enough to
prevent the 30-18.30-23,30-25 sweep.
After the loss, in which only freshman
middle blocker Garrett Werner hit over .100
(I le hit 7-for-9 with one error for a .667 av
erage.). Stanford regrouped and came out
firing on Saturday.
"That is something that we have done
well all year long," Kosty said of his team's
turnaround. "No matter what happened in
the past, we have been good at always look
ing at the future. We haven't dwelled on loss
esâ€” we just know what we need to do to
make ourselves improve."
The Cardinal and Tritons matched each
other point-for-point in the first frame, with
the score standing tied as late as 26-26. But it
was Stanford that put together a run at the

Stanford stretched its lead in the match
to 2-0 with another close win in the second
game, this time 30-27.The Cardinal broke a
19-19 tie and would not let the Tritons with
in two points down the stretch.
Down two games to none, UCSD came
back with a vengeance in game three anil
shocked Stanford with a 30-19 win.They hit
.393 with If) kills in the game while holding
the Cardinal to 11 kills at a .059 clip.
It was more of the same in the fourth
game as the Tritons turned a one-point
deficit into a five-point lead over a span of
only eight points. Stanford closed that gap,
but could not regain the lead, and UCSD
evened the match with a 30-26 win.
But the Cardinal's offense took
over the tilth game to snatch the win
with eight kills and no errors. The
Iritons tallied eight kills as well, but
their lour errors proved to be Stan
lord's margin of victory, with the
final score 15-11.
"That fifth game is exactly what
we have been trying to do in practice
stay focused and not create hit
ting errors," Kosty said.
Ceran led Stanford with 21 kills
and 14 digs while Williams had 18
kills and Romero had 14. Williams
also nabbed a team-high seven block
assists as the Cardinal outblocked
UCSD 11-10. Freshman setter Kawi
ka Shoji dished 61 assists and led the
squad with three aces to go with four
blocks and 13 digs. Sophomore
libero Jarod Keller posted 11 digs in
the match.

Though Stanford let a two-game
advantage get away, Kosty was
nonetheless satisfied with the final
result.
"A win is a win in the MPSF," he
said. "UC-San Diego has beaten a
ranked team this year, and they are a
good team. If you win in three or you
win in five, the' W' is what counts."
The Cardinal return to southern
California this coming weekend,
searching for its second win against
No. 2 UC-Irvine and No. 8 UCLA.
The Anteaters( 11-2,6-2) were swept
by top-ranked BYU last Friday, but
came back with a five-game upset of
the Cougars the following night.
UCLA (5-6, 3-5) swept Hawaii in a
pair of matches last weekend, ending
a streak in which the Bruins had lost
six of seven.
Stanford has already seen the
Anteaters once this season, losing a
three-game match at a season-open
ing tournament in early January.
