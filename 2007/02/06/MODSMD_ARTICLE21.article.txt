# Yay Colts... who's ready for baseball?

### 
The Indianapolis Colts are the world
champions. Damn, that felt good. 1 lold
up, let me say it again:The Indianapo
lis Colts are the world champions. Aww,yeah,
that's the stuff.
Super Bowl XLI. along with its less-than
satisfving commercials, is in the hooks, and
the attention of the athletic media has offi
cially shifted to the nation's unofficial pas
time: baseball.
After originally having decided to end my
column-writing days last week, my managing
editor convinced me that the Stanford com
munity needs my voice of reason, primarily
to afflict the comforted and to provide a
SoCal perspective for a newspaper de
plorably invested in NorCal athletics. My
only condition: I exclusively write about
what means the most to me: baseball — the
true sport of kings. After all, it's only like two
more hours a week — and that's two less
hours a week of being down about not having
a girlfriend.
This week. I'd like to outline a few of the
National League's winners and losers of the
offseason thus far. Feel free to disagree, but
just remember: The Indianapolis Colts are
still the world champions.
The Winners:
Chicago Cubs — OK. ignore the fact that
they spent close to $300 million on free
agents this offseason. The Cubs picked up
southpaw Ted Lilly, power-hitting outfielder
Alfonso Soriano, outfielder Cliff Lloyd and
the best available manager, Lou Piniella. It
also convinced Notre Dame's Jeff Samardzi
ja to choose baseball over American foot
hall. Look for the Cubbies to contend for —
anil probably win — the NL Central.
Los Angeles Dodgers — My old column
wasn't called "The SoCal Bias" for nothing.
I'm still not digging the five-year. $144 mil
lion deal for the speedy Juan Pierre when the
Blue Crew already has the leadoff strength in
Rafael Furcal. But the additions of Jason
Schmidt and Randy Wolf to a rotation of
Brad Penny, Derek Lowe and either Chad
Billingsley or I long-Chili Kuo gives Los An
geles one of the game's best staffs. General
Manager (G.M.) Ned Coletti didn't find a
much-needed power hitter, but the squad's
abundance of pitching talent should allow
