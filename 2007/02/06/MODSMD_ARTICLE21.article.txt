# Yay Colts... who's ready for baseball?
## 
### 
The Indianapolis Colts are the world
champions. Damn, that felt good. 1 lold
up, let me say it again:The Indianapo
lis Colts are the world champions. Aww,yeah,
that's the stuff.
Super Bowl XLI. along with its less-than
satisfving commercials, is in the hooks, and
the attention of the athletic media has offi
cially shifted to the nation's unofficial pas
time: baseball.
After originally having decided to end my
column-writing days last week, my managing
editor convinced me that the Stanford com
munity needs my voice of reason, primarily
to afflict the comforted and to provide a
SoCal perspective for a newspaper de
plorably invested in NorCal athletics. My
only condition: I exclusively write about
what means the most to me: baseball — the
true sport of kings. After all, it's only like two
more hours a week — and that's two less
hours a week of being down about not having
a girlfriend.
This week. I'd like to outline a few of the
National League's winners and losers of the
offseason thus far. Feel free to disagree, but
just remember: The Indianapolis Colts are
still the world champions.
The Winners:
Chicago Cubs — OK. ignore the fact that
they spent close to $300 million on free
agents this offseason. The Cubs picked up
southpaw Ted Lilly, power-hitting outfielder
Alfonso Soriano, outfielder Cliff Lloyd and
the best available manager, Lou Piniella. It
also convinced Notre Dame's Jeff Samardzi
ja to choose baseball over American foot
hall. Look for the Cubbies to contend for —
anil probably win — the NL Central.
Los Angeles Dodgers — My old column
wasn't called "The SoCal Bias" for nothing.
I'm still not digging the five-year. $144 mil
lion deal for the speedy Juan Pierre when the
Blue Crew already has the leadoff strength in
Rafael Furcal. But the additions of Jason
Schmidt and Randy Wolf to a rotation of
Brad Penny, Derek Lowe and either Chad
Billingsley or I long-Chili Kuo gives Los An
geles one of the game's best staffs. General
Manager (G.M.) Ned Coletti didn't find a
much-needed power hitter, but the squad's
abundance of pitching talent should allow


Andrew
Lomeli
The SoCal Bias
for a trade to fill in that gap as the
season approaches. This is the
Dodgers' year.
Barry Zito — The offseason's most
coveted free agent, Zito, signed the
biggest deal for a pitcher at $126
million over seven years. And the
guy didn't even have to move that
far. Giants fans will now have an
other Barry to be disappointed in.
The Losers:
New York Mets — Don't get me
wrong: The Mets will still molly
whop the rest of the NL East, and
probably the rest of the NL this sea
son. But this squad let Zito slip
through its fingers, making New
York's biggest offseason addition
Moises Alou.
Washington Nationals —G.M.Jim
Bowden refused to trade away Sori
ano last season because he thought
Soriano would be convinced to stay
in Washington. Now. the NL. East
bottom-dwellers are left without
Soriano and without the prospects
he could have been dealt for.

Ehh..Can't Complain:
San Francisco Giants — I don't
think that a "rebuilding" team
should spend so much money on
one player. Barry Zito. But the Gi
ants added some nice free agents in
Bengie Molina. Dave Roberts and
Rich Aurilia. Nice managerial
choice in Bruce Bochy, too.
Houston Astros —Nice additions
with Carlos Lee and — en it. Woody
Williams. Houston loses offensive
leader Jeff Bagwell to retirement and
Andy Pettite to the Yankees. Roger
Clemens' future remains up in the air.
San Diego Padres — Between
keeping David Wells and signing
Greg Maddux and Marcus Giles,
the only thing keeping me from
naming the Padres a "Winner" is
their naming former Angels pitch
ing coach Bud Black the new skip
per. Also, (he additions just may not
be enough to keep up with the
Dodgers in a talented NL West.
And just in case anyone forgot:' Hie
Indianapolis Colts are still the
world champions. Look for a more
carefully-written analysis of the
American League next Tuesday.

Andrew Lomeli is a sophomore. Con
tact him at alomeli@stanford.edu.
