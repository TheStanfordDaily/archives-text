### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
With the first live games of their season coming within
a span of just three days this past weekend, the members of
the No. 3 Stanford women's water polo team had no choice
hut to kick things into high gear from the get-go. A re
sounding victory in their season opener and a solid third
place finish in the Stanford Invitational served as testa
ment to the success of the Cardinal's efforts.
hollowing a convincing 10-6 conference win over
Hawaii on Friday afternoon. No. 3 Stanford (4-1. 1-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) cruised through its
first game of the weekend tournament by defeating San
Jose State, 15-8. The Cardinal faltered in their second
round showdown against perennial powerhouse Southern
California, however, dropping a tough 8-6 decision in a
closely contested match. Nevertheless, the Stanford
women were ready to rebound on Sunday, posting wins
over No. 7 Arizona State and No. 4 California to claim third
in the annual Invitational.
Starting their 2007 campaign on Friday afternoon
against the visiting Rainbow Wahine, the Cardinal knew
that their pcrtormance would set the tone for the coming
tournament as well as the season. Freshman driver Folo
Silver put Stanford on the board first with a goal at 6:41 in
the opening period, but then Hawaii's defense began to
clamp down, l ime and time again. I lawaii goalie Meike De
Nooy stonewalled Stanford shots from point-blank range
as the Rainbow Wahine collected themselves and took a 2-
I lead.
lronically.though.it was the longest shot of the quarter
that proved the most difficult for De Nooy to handle. With
the clock running down in the lirst period of play. Silver
found herself in possession of the ball, not more than 10
meters from her own net. But instead of simply allowing
time to expire. Silver wound up and fired a laser across
three quarters of the pool's length, straight into the top left
corner of the goal. Just as the buzzer sounded, the ball
rocketed into the back of the cage past De Nooy's out-
stretched hand, giving the Cardinal a jolt of ener
gy asthe\ headed into their huddle.
Although the Rainbow Wahine came out
strong in the second period and built a two-goal
lead. Stanford fought back and seized a 5-4 advan
tage before the half on the strength of a pair of
goals from junior driver Jackie Gauthier and an
other from senior captain Katie Hansen.
F rom that point forward it was all Stanford, as
the ( ardinal stepped up their defensive play while
continuing to pressure 1 lawaii on the transition. Se
nior goalie Meridith McC oil. who collected lftsaves

on the day. closed out her brilliant performance in
the season opener by surrendering only two goals to
the Rainbow Wahine over the final two periods of
play Silver was unstoppable on the offensive, net
ting five goals to pace the Stanford offense.
The next morning, the Cardinal showed up
bright and early to take on No. 10 San Jose State in
the first round of the Invitational's competition.
Stanford never trailed during the match, explod
ing for five unanswered goals in the second period
of play to take control. Before the final buzzer
sounded, nine different members of the Cardinal

squad got in on Ihe scoring act. Senior two-meter
defender Alison Gregorka. playing despite recov
ering from a recently broken nose, was the offen
sive star of the game, finding the hack of the net
four times. A trio of freshmen also recorded the
first goals of their collegiate careers; driver Kelly
Donahue and two-meter Alex Koran contributed
two goals apiece, and driver Kelly Eaton added an
other as the Cardinal rolled to the 15-8 win.
Stanford's afternoon match proved to be a
tougher challenge, as the Cardinal squared off
against the top-ranked Women of Troy. Although
both lineups featured high-powered offensive
threats, the game took on a decidedly defensive
nature during the first half of play. After trailing 1-
0 at the end of the first period, Stanford rallied for
two to take a narrow 2-1 lead into the half.
But the Women of Troy drew even in the third
period, and a pair of unanswered USC goals mid
way through the fourth period put the Cardinal in
the hole. Hansen came through with her fourth
goal of the day to bring Stanford back within one,
but it was too little too late as USC went on to take
the 8-6 victory.
On Sunday, the Stanford women returned to
their dominant form, dropping No. 7 Arizona State
by a score of 16-7. Freshman Kate Heddleston
started in goal for the Cardinal and earned the first
victory of her career while stopping six shots. Sil
ver again led the scoring charge with four goals,
while Gauthier, Hansen, sophomore Jessica Stef
fens and treshman Kelsey Houlshouser all
notched two apiece.
In their final game of the tournament, the Car
dinal clinched a third-place finish by knocking off
the No. 4 Golden Bears, 7-5, in another highly de
fensive match. Stanford jumped out to a 4-2 ad
vantage in the first period of play, but neither side
was able to muster any offense before the conclu
sion of the halt. Senior two-meter Christina
1 lewko broke the stalemate by tallying her first
goal of the day midway through the third period.
She added two more in the fourth, effectively put
ting the game out of reach as the Stanford women
went on to beat their cross-Bay rivals.
