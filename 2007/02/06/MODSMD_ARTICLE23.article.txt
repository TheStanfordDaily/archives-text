## Tennis still winless after SoCal swing Cardinal men upset by Southern California before being shut out by UCLA for first time in more than a decade 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford tennis made history once again
this weekend, hut not in the positive way that
is usually associated with the program.
In Madison.Wis.,No.6GeorgiaTech bare
ly managed to break the 89-match win streak
of the top-ranked Stanford women. On the
same day. No. 4 UCLA scored its first shutout
of the Stanford men's tennis team since I C W2.
The No. I 4 ) Stanford men (0-3) also dropped
a 5-2 decision to No. 43 Southern California
in Los Angeles on Friday.
"USC and UCLA are two of the better
teams in the nation right now," assistant
coach Dave Hodge said. "It was. a pretty
tough weekend for us. hut we knew it was
going to be an uphill battle the whole way."
As has been the theme of the season thus
far for the Card, there were a few silver lin
ings in the gray clouds of the dismal outcome.
Against the Bruins (5-0), senior Eric
McKean and sophomore Jeff Zeller notched
an impressive 8-3 win in doubles over No. 18
Mathieu Dehainc and Jeremy Drean. The
pair also edged out a 6-5 win on Friday
against the Trojans' Adam Loucks and Gar
rett Snyder. A tiebreaker was played at five
all because I ISC (5-0) had already picked up
the doubles point. However. Stanford was
not able to pull out a second doubles set on ei
ther day and thus gave up the doubles point
against both SoCal teams.

"Eric and Jeff are a very energetic pair
who came out quickly," I lodge said. "That's
what we need in college doubles. We just
need to find another doubles pro-set out of
the other two teams."
Another bright spot in the weekend oc
curred on Friday against the Trojans when
sophomore Matt Bruch tallied his first win
of the season after returning from a wrist in
jury. defeating Jamil Al-Agba. 7-5. 6-4. On
Saturday though, the defending NCAA
champion. No. 5 Benjamin Kohlloeffel,
proved to be too much for Bruch, handily
defeating the Card, 6-2,6-1.
"Another positive was really seeing Matt
back," I lodge said."l wouldn't say he's all the
way back, but he got some match form back
with his win at USC and [faced] a tough op
ponent at UCLA."
Despite these few highlights, the remain
der of the weekend proved difficult and bleak
for Stanford. Ilie Cardinal's 5-2 loss to USC
only set the stage for Saturday's more deci
sive 7-0 defeat at the hands of the Bruins.
After dropping the doubles point against
the Trojans. Stanford readied itself for singles
action. USC picked up four singles matches
in straight sets, as well as the overall win. be
fore the ('ard were able to even jump on the
scoreboard.
Ihe Trojans tallied wins at the second,
third, fifth and sixth singles positions before
