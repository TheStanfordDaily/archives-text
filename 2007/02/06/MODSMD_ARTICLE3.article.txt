### JACK SALISBURY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"It's really strange."
This was the reaction offered by women's tennis head coach Lele
Forood after her team's first dual-match loss in three years.The three
words spoke volumes, though, about top-ranked Stanford's defeat at
the hands of No. 6 Georgia Tech in the semifinals of the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association (ITA) National Team Indoors tournament in
Madison, Wis. Saturday.
The shocking 4-3 loss to the Yellow Jackets (3-0) broke the Cardi
nal's 89-match winning streak, which dated back to the 2003 N( A A
Championships.
The match came down to the very last point, with Stanford (3-1)
and No. 6 Georgia Tech tied 3-3. Tech's Tarryn Rudman came up big
when it mattered most, defeating junior Whitney Deason in a well
fought match by a 6-3,5-7.6-4 final.
Georgia Tech went on to claim the tournament title the following
day, defeating Notre Dame 4-2.
Forood offered high praise for the Yellow Jackets' performance.
"Georgia Tech was a very feisty, upstart team," she said. "They had

a lot ol girls and coaches who really believed they could win the toui
nament.'lTiey really hit (lie hall well from the first point of the dou
bles; it kind of set a tone. It wasn't like they shocked us. but they cer
tainly let us have it."
The Cardinal still got a strong performance from senior Ilieresa
I .ogar. who handily won her singles match against (ieorgia Tech 's No.
1. Kristi Miller.The Stanford doubles duo of freshman Lindsay Bur
dette and sophomore Jessica Nyugen knocked off the Yellow Jackets'

Despite their best efforts, junior Whitney Deason (shown above) and senior Theresa Logar were unable to pull out the victory in their doubles
match, losing by a narrow 9-7 margin. Deason was a senior in high school the last time the Cardinal dropped a match.
Although Georgia Tech was a championship-
Ciiliber opponent, many factors contributed to the
Stanford loss.
"It was a combination of everything." said sen
ior Anne Yelsey, who had never lost a team match
in her Stanford career until Saturday. "Georgia
lech basically outplayed |us). But people are al
ways gunning for us — they're always playing
their best against us because we're number one.
lliey played really well and just came out better
than us. It was a tough loss.
"I really think the pressure and everything got
to people." she said. "It's almost a relief to have
[the burden of the 89-match winning streak] off
our backs."
Forood said the loss might help the team later
in the season.
"Losses can always be positive," she said.
"Losses allow you to focus better on the things you

need to do better. It'll have a very positive effect
on our team. We'll start chasing people, instead of
being the ones who've been targeted for the last
three years."
The shocking loss overshadowed the Cardinal's
impressive quarterfinal victory over Pacific-10
Conference rival California (4-2). Stanford hail lit
tle trouble disposing of the No. 11 Golden Bears
on Friday, defeating them by a final score of 6-1.
"To play a team of that caliber was going to be
a difficult task." said Forood, who was thrilled with
her team's victory on Friday "They're much better
than the No. 11 team in the country, which is what
their ranking was at the time. We got ready for the
match and played absolutely great — it was a very
emotional victory for us."
Yelsey testified to the significance of her
squad's win over the Bears.
"The Cal match was great." she said. "1 think

that Cal's going to he one of our toughest compe
titions all year, and we were mentally prepared for
it. |We) just crushed them. 1 think any time you
beat Cal, it's a good feeling."
Despite her team's loss in the semifinals.
1 -brood was pleased with Stanford's performance
as a whole.
"When you're playing high-level competition,
it's very tough," she said. "I'm really proud of how
we handled going into such a huge tournament.
We did a pretty good job. and we have so much
room for improvement, especially on the doubles
side."
Hie Cardinal have a chance to rebound from
their shocking setback when they face Sacramen
to State at the Taube Family Tennis Center, 1:30
p.m. on Thursday.
