"It's really strange."
This was the reaction offered by women's tennis head coach Lele
Forood after her team's first dual-match loss in three years.The three
words spoke volumes, though, about top-ranked Stanford's defeat at
the hands of No. 6 Georgia Tech in the semifinals of the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association (ITA) National Team Indoors tournament in
Madison, Wis. Saturday.
The shocking 4-3 loss to the Yellow Jackets (3-0) broke the Cardi
nal's 89-match winning streak, which dated back to the 2003 N( A A
Championships.
The match came down to the very last point, with Stanford (3-1)
and No. 6 Georgia Tech tied 3-3. Tech's Tarryn Rudman came up big
when it mattered most, defeating junior Whitney Deason in a well
fought match by a 6-3,5-7.6-4 final.
Georgia Tech went on to claim the tournament title the following
day, defeating Notre Dame 4-2.
Forood offered high praise for the Yellow Jackets' performance.
"Georgia Tech was a very feisty, upstart team," she said. "They had

a lot ol girls and coaches who really believed they could win the toui
nament.'lTiey really hit (lie hall well from the first point of the dou
bles; it kind of set a tone. It wasn't like they shocked us. but they cer
tainly let us have it."

I .ogar. who handily won her singles match against (ieorgia Tech 's No.
