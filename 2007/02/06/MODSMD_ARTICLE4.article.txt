# Health services abound
## A 						plethora of health services await students in need 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
lliis is the second of a multi-part series on
mental health at Stanford, lite first part ran in
yesterday's Daily ("Mental health reevaluated").
At Stanford, sometimes it seems as if help is al
ways right around the corner. Resident Assis
tants. Resident Id lows and Resident Deans are
readily available for consultation in dorms. Coun
seling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at
Vaden 1 lealth Center and The Bridge offer pro
fessional mental health services. The University
has even designed resources specifically for facul
ty and staff.
But after recent student deaths — several of
which authorities consider to he apparent sui
cides — Stanford's mental health resources have
come under increased scrutiny from both stu
dents and University officials.
Many students and counselors told llie Daily
that while they generally feel the University's
mental health support network is extensive, sev
eral glaring inadequacies remain. The responsi
bility for reform, they said, rests on both students
and administrators.
Filling the Gaps
After the body of 23-year old graduate stu
dent Mengyao "May" Zhou was discovered in
Santa Rosa last week, the University released a
list of campus support resources that spanned IK
different administrative offices.
"They're all pretty good services" said James
Poole '05'. who worked at The Bridge for several
years as a Stanford undergraduate. "The Univer
sity has something for everyone."
University officials acknowledged that there
is room for improvement.
"Because the University is dedicated to sup
porting student well-being, we are always inter
ested in enhancing our network of services," Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
wrote in an email to The Daily.
Two resources that students and mental health
counselors have targeted are the main counseling
services on campus: CAPS and The Bridge.
According to both current and past coun
selors. Hie Bridge does not come close to meeting
its full capacity of students, despite
the fact that it is the only on-campus
service dedicated to counseling other
than CAPS. Some attribute this
under-ut ilization to a lack of publici
ty.
"I'he University doesn't publicize
as much about us and doesn't give us
as much credit as we deserve," said
Kyle Evaldez '09. a live-in counselor
at The Bridge. "The University
should recognize our presence
more."
Evaldez blamed The Bridge's rel
ative obscurity on a lack of funding.
1 le noted that the counseling service
currently raises most of its funds
through its own efforts, pointing to
the Spring Faire that The Bridge
helps organize each year. The Uni
versity's only contributions to The
Bridge last year. Evaldez said, were
free phone lines.
For many students. The Bridge is
only the "first stop." Most students,
counselors said, are eventually re
ferred to CAPS, which provides the
kind of long-term counseling The
Bridge cannot give students.
On the other hand, some say
CAPS can be over utilized and that
they are sometimes too busy to ac
commodate the number of students
who request appointments.
While CAPS maintains a commit
ment to handle urgent crises on a
same-day basis, students with long
term issues have sometimes waited
for weeks before getting an appoint

ment.
"We can, at times, he very busy,"
said Dr. Alejandro Martinez, director
of CAPS.
Recognizing the problems posed by
long waits, Martinez said that CAPS
would ideally be able to offer stu
dents appointments within three or
five days of the initial call.
"1 feel the same frustrations as the
student [who cannot get an appoint
ment]." he said. "We'd like to do bet
ter. We'd like to have students not
wait for more than five days."
Most students who had sought
counseling offered by C 'APS told The
Daily that they found the services
helpful and rated their experiences
positively. The popularity of CAPS
among students may partially explain
the difficulty in making appoint
ments.
Those familiar with mental health
at Stanford also told Hie Daily that
the University should improve out
reach efforts, instead of waiting for
students to seek help on their own.
In an effort to review its mental
health services, the University con
vened the Mental I lealth and Well-
Being Task Force last fall. According
to Boardman, the responsibilities of
the Task Force include "gaining a
more complete understanding of the
stresses that students face" and "in
vestigating ways to provide a more
supportive environment for all mem
bers of the Stanford community."
Boa rdma n an d ot her ran k ing Un i -

versity officials have declined to re
lease important specifics about the
Task Force — including a list of its
members and what issues it has dis
cussed.
Working Together
While students, counselors and
I Jniversity officials agreed that men
tal health was a primary concern on
campus, many acknowledged that
students and the University have
often failed to work together to re
form existing services.
"Unfortunately, it seems the stu
dents do not really trust the adminis
tration," Poole said.
Students significantly involved
with mental health on campus agreed
with Poole, suggesting that their
peers should recognize that the Uni
versity is attempting to improve its
current services.
"The administration is doing the
best |it] can." said Alejandro De Los
Angeles '07. one of the founders of
Stanford Peace of Mind, a student
group that addresses mental health
and life issues on campus.
Students, De 1 -os Angeles said, are
often unaware of critical mental
health issues felt by their peers.
"It is a lot more difficult to have
activism here about mental health is
sues because it is not considered to be
a mainstream problem." he said.
In the past few weeks, many stu
dents have expressed concerns about
the administration's apparent unwill
ingness to reveal information about

possible suicides.
"We do make as much of an effort
to find out what happens," Martinez
said. "But we don't always get to
know firsthand what happens to a
student."
Concerns of privacy for both the
individual and his family have also
sometimes precluded the University
from releasing information.
"Once Stanford is informed, it dis
seminates information to University
departments and offices which need
to have this information." Boardman
said."We respect privacy to the great
est extent possible."
Both University officials and stu
dents said they anticipate more stu
dent activity concerning mental
health in the coming weeks as the
University grapples with the fallout
of recent student deaths.
But, like others, Evaldez took a
moment to reflect on the reasons for
students' recent interest in mental
health.
"It's sad." he said with a sigh,"that
it has to he done in light of a suicide."

Task Force — including a list of its

Working Together
While students, counselors and
I Jniversity officials agreed that men
tal health was a primary concern on
campus, many acknowledged that
students and the University have
often failed to work together to re
form existing services.
"Unfortunately, it seems the stu
dents do not really trust the adminis
tration," Poole said.
Students significantly involved
with mental health on campus agreed
with Poole, suggesting that their
peers should recognize that the Uni
versity is attempting to improve its
current services.
"The administration is doing the
best |it] can." said Alejandro De Los
Angeles '07. one of the founders of
Stanford Peace of Mind, a student
group that addresses mental health
and life issues on campus.
Students, De 1 -os Angeles said, are
often unaware of critical mental
health issues felt by their peers.
"It is a lot more difficult to have
activism here about mental health is
sues because it is not considered to be
a mainstream problem." he said.
In the past few weeks, many stu
dents have expressed concerns about
the administration's apparent unwill
ingness to reveal information about

possible suicides.
"We do make as much of an effort
to find out what happens," Martinez
said. "But we don't always get to
know firsthand what happens to a
student."
Concerns of privacy for both the
individual and his family have also
sometimes precluded the University
from releasing information.
"Once Stanford is informed, it dis
seminates information to University
departments and offices which need
to have this information." Boardman
said."We respect privacy to the great
est extent possible."
Both University officials and stu
dents said they anticipate more stu
dent activity concerning mental
health in the coming weeks as the
University grapples with the fallout
of recent student deaths.
But, like others, Evaldez took a
moment to reflect on the reasons for
students' recent interest in mental
health.
"It's sad." he said with a sigh,"that
it has to he done in light of a suicide."

lliis is the second of a multi-part series on
mental health at Stanford, lite first part ran in
yesterday's Daily ("Mental health reevaluated").
At Stanford, sometimes it seems as if help is al
ways right around the corner. Resident Assis
tants. Resident Id lows and Resident Deans are
readily available for consultation in dorms. Coun
seling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at
Vaden 1 lealth Center and The Bridge offer pro
fessional mental health services. The University
has even designed resources specifically for facul
ty and staff.
But after recent student deaths — several of
which authorities consider to he apparent sui
cides — Stanford's mental health resources have
come under increased scrutiny from both stu
dents and University officials.
Many students and counselors told llie Daily
that while they generally feel the University's
mental health support network is extensive, sev
eral glaring inadequacies remain. The responsi
bility for reform, they said, rests on both students
and administrators.
Filling the Gaps
After the body of 23-year old graduate stu
dent Mengyao "May" Zhou was discovered in
Santa Rosa last week, the University released a
list of campus support resources that spanned IK
different administrative offices.
"They're all pretty good services" said James
Poole '05'. who worked at The Bridge for several
years as a Stanford undergraduate. "The Univer
sity has something for everyone."
University officials acknowledged that there
is room for improvement.
"Because the University is dedicated to sup
porting student well-being, we are always inter
ested in enhancing our network of services," Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
wrote in an email to The Daily.
Two resources that students and mental health
counselors have targeted are the main counseling
services on campus: CAPS and The Bridge.
According to both current and past coun
selors. Hie Bridge does not come close to meeting
its full capacity of students, despite
the fact that it is the only on-campus
service dedicated to counseling other
than CAPS. Some attribute this
under-ut ilization to a lack of publici
ty.
"I'he University doesn't publicize
as much about us and doesn't give us
as much credit as we deserve," said
Kyle Evaldez '09. a live-in counselor
at The Bridge. "The University
should recognize our presence
more."
Evaldez blamed The Bridge's rel
ative obscurity on a lack of funding.
1 le noted that the counseling service
currently raises most of its funds
through its own efforts, pointing to
the Spring Faire that The Bridge
helps organize each year. The Uni
versity's only contributions to The
Bridge last year. Evaldez said, were
free phone lines.
For many students. The Bridge is
only the "first stop." Most students,
counselors said, are eventually re
ferred to CAPS, which provides the
kind of long-term counseling The
Bridge cannot give students.
On the other hand, some say
CAPS can be over utilized and that
they are sometimes too busy to ac
commodate the number of students
who request appointments.
While CAPS maintains a commit
ment to handle urgent crises on a
same-day basis, students with long
term issues have sometimes waited
for weeks before getting an appoint

ment.
"We can, at times, he very busy,"
said Dr. Alejandro Martinez, director
of CAPS.
Recognizing the problems posed by
long waits, Martinez said that CAPS
would ideally be able to offer stu
dents appointments within three or
five days of the initial call.
"1 feel the same frustrations as the
student [who cannot get an appoint
ment]." he said. "We'd like to do bet
ter. We'd like to have students not
wait for more than five days."
Most students who had sought
counseling offered by C 'APS told The
Daily that they found the services
helpful and rated their experiences
positively. The popularity of CAPS
among students may partially explain
the difficulty in making appoint
ments.
Those familiar with mental health
at Stanford also told Hie Daily that
the University should improve out
reach efforts, instead of waiting for
students to seek help on their own.
In an effort to review its mental
health services, the University con
vened the Mental I lealth and Well-
Being Task Force last fall. According
to Boardman, the responsibilities of
the Task Force include "gaining a
more complete understanding of the
stresses that students face" and "in
vestigating ways to provide a more
supportive environment for all mem
bers of the Stanford community."
