and lyrical phrases.
Quickley — who was deported just
before the war began during the so-called

the sounds and experiences of fighting
and recounted them in his poetry when
he returned.
"Evervthinu was unraveling." he said

of his experience in Iraq."lf there were 20
journalists in a room it would be:' You and
you — go!* It was the way things crumble
at the end of the regime.There wasn't a lot
of logic in place."
Quickley said that the universality of
poetry in Iraq surprised him.
"I 'd be at some cafe in Falluja." he told
the audience, "and some insurgents run
ning around with their Rl'Cis would run
back to their homes and then come back
without their RPGs and with their
poems."
