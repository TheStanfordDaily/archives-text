### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
An Open Mic poetry contest held at
Ruble Theater last night ended with stu
dents in a three-way tie for first place.The
contest was sponsored by the Lively Arts
and judged by artist-in-residence Jerry
Quickley, who will perform later this
week.
Quickley previewed his performance
piece "Live from the Front" for students
before the contest began.The full version
of "Live from the Front" will be per
formed on Wednesday night at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The piece cen
ters on Quickley's experiences in Iraq.de
picted with both percussive curse words
and lyrical phrases.
Quickley — who was deported just
before the war began during the so-called
"Shock and Awe" campaign — collected
the sounds and experiences of fighting
and recounted them in his poetry when
he returned.
"Evervthinu was unraveling." he said

of his experience in Iraq."lf there were 20
journalists in a room it would be:' You and
you — go!* It was the way things crumble
at the end of the regime.There wasn't a lot
of logic in place."
Quickley said that the universality of
poetry in Iraq surprised him.
"I 'd be at some cafe in Falluja." he told
the audience, "and some insurgents run
ning around with their Rl'Cis would run
back to their homes and then come back
without their RPGs and with their
poems."
Quickley had some difficulty selecting
a winning poet for the Lively Arts-spon
sored $100 grand prize. The work he had
to choose from, he said, was all terrific
Students from the Spoken Word Col
lective, among others, arrived to perform
their work, which was also judged by
Lively Arts' Director of Campus Engage
ment Michelle Lee. who used what
Quickley called a "utilitarian, mercenary
style point system."
The participants offered a wide array
of pieces, including a poem by Takeo
Rivera '08 entitled "Suicide Dream."
which reflected on the recent death of
graduate student Mengyao' May" Zhou.

Jeff Mendelman '09 performed "Dear Mr. Bush" in Roble Theater last night at an
open mic event judged by Jerry Quickley.
After Lee and Quickley decided
to call the contest a three-way draw,
I ee increased the total monetary
prize available from $100 to $3(X) so
that the three winners would not
have to split the award.
The winners were Philana
Omorotionmwan '07. who per
formed " l et Down Hair"; Gwen
dolyn Watson W. who performed
"Creative Rebellion"; and Jeff
Mendelman '0 ( ), who rapped "Dear
Mr. Bush."
In addition to judging student po
etry and performing his own work.
Quickley is working on a community
outreach program as part of his resi
dency with Lively Arts.
Quickley will work with students
in College Track, an outreach pro
gram that helps East Palo Alto stu
dents with disadvantaged back
grounds in their quest for college ad
mission.
" Hie idea is to have high school
students from East Palo Alto go into
the communities (in which] they live
and collect immigration stories,"
Quickley told llie Daily.
"In creating his work. [Quickley]
went and interviewed citizens in
Iraq," said Lee, who originally con
ceived the project."We're recreating
that with the kids in College Track."
Lively Arts aims to become more
than just a performance series, ac
cording to Lee. The Open Mic pro
gram in Roble was part of Lively
Arts' recent decision to reach out to
the entire student body.
Roble Resident Fellow Kate
Chesley agreed that bringing Quick
ley to Roble is important to increase
awareness.
"Our objective is to bring more
student attention to 1 .ively Arts." she
said.
Quickley said that it was impor
tant that students in the United
States not lose track of their connec
tion to poetry.
"In a sense, poetry is elevated lan
guage used to tell stories." he said.
"That's a powerful,almost tribal con
nection."
