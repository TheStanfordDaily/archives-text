## Stanford nabs top stem cell researcher Reijo-Para to lead Center for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research and Education 
### SALONE KAPUR 
After a decadc at DC San Francisco
(t ICS!•'), researcher Renee Reijo Pera will join
the Stanford community.lcading the Center for
Human I mhryonic Stem Cell Research and
I Education within the Stanford Institute for
Stem ( ell Biology and Regenerative Medicine.
At Stanford. Reijo-Pera hopes to expand
the University's cloning efforts to bring its re
search to the forefront of regenerative medi
cine. A world leader in the study of human em
bryonic stem cells. Reijo-Pera was an associate

professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at
I < SI
I lei research focuses on the earliest stages of human embry
onic development and the pathway between embryonic stem
cells and developing or developed oocytes (eggs).
In 2(H> 1. Reijo-Pera oversaw stem cell lines at UCSF and has
since been studying how the amorphous stem cells become par-


Reijo-Para
ticular cell types.
Reijo-Pera joins Stanford in a
controversial and often misunder
stood field. The University has
lagged behind institutions like Mar
vard and IJCSI'. the only academic
research centers in the I Jnitcd States
which have conducted human em
bryonic stem cell research.
Dr. Irving Weissman, director of
stem cell research at Stanford, ex
plained the reasoning behind the
University's hesitation in proceed
ing with this controversial re
search.
"|We are] very reluctant to do
this research with eggs donated from
volunteers." he wrote in an email to
The Daily "We needed to recruit
someone who is committed to try
this with eggs from animals first
using the same animal's skin cells,
then try with eggs derived from al

tentative sources, not volunteers.
Rence is the key for all these ef
forts."
Reijo-Pera will be part of a large
group with expertise in areas not
presently pursued at UC'SI". such as
blood-forming, cancer and leukemia
stem cells.
Aside from playing a primary
role in the department of obstetrics.
Reijo I Via will also work with lead
ing biologists and embryologists.
"Renee will help develop courses
in the program tor regenerative
medicine, in human biology and in a
new medical school course and will
likely take students to train in her
lab." Weissman said.
Weissman predicted that Reijo-
Pera will have an impact on the Uni
versity. beyond her work as a re
search scientist.
She is "deeply interested in
women's health issues." he said, "a
subject that cuts across the entire
Stanford campus."
