Global warming examined
Last week in Paris, 46 states dis
cussed the new report by the Intergov
ernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), the first in more than live
years. The IPCC concluded that human
beings are probably the principal cause

of global warming and that cata
clysmic natural disasters in the
forms of rising sea levels, mas
sive storms or severe droughts
will be likely results of climate
change. /

Beijing puts pressure on Sudan
China for the tirsi time exerted strong,public pressure
on the government of Sudan as Chinese President Hu
Jintao told Sudan's leader Omar al-Bashir that both the
UN and the African Union should be given more power
to peacefully resolve the crisis in Darfur. The message,
apparently delivered personally by I In during an official
visit, came with assurances that China, which is the
largest importer of Sudanese resources and Sudan's
principal investor, wishes to expand its economic rela
tionship with the African country.

Attacks in Iraq

In Iraq, the deadliest
jingle attack of the new
year took the lives of at least

130 Shi'ites in a Baghdad market

and wounded approximately 300. Shi'ites
in the neighborhood expressed outrage at
the inability of the Iraqi government or the

U.S. military to provide security. Several days ear
lier, the U.S. Government's National Intelligence

Estimate had described the Iraqi military as unready for the
challenges it faces. ITie report also pointed to mounting
sectarian tensions in the country, indicating that a failure
to resolve the opposition between Sunnis and Shi'ites in
Iraq could destroy the already weak Iraqi government
\or give rise to a new dictatorship like that of executed
strongman Saddam I lussein.

Beirut cafeteria fight turns deadly
Sectarian fighting flared in the Lebanese capital of Beirut last
week, where the atmosphere has remained tense since the Israeli De
fense Forces invaded last August. A fight in the cafeteria of the Beirut
Arab University escalated when Sunni followers of Saad al-Hariri's
Future Movement, which has a strong base of support in the univer
sity area, prevented Shi'itc Lebanese from leaving the campus. Vio
lence. ranging from throwing stones and bottles to fatal sniper at
tacks. swept the neighborhood when Shi'ite supporters arrived in
vans and inserted themselves in the conflict between the Lebanese
Army and supporters of the Future Movement.

Russian parties blocked from ballot
Hie Russian Federation, which will send its representatives to
take part in the Beijing-based talks, has caused concern about the
/] r in tlm I nni

future of democracy in tne country. Last

week it was revealed that the Russ
ian government has decided to

block a number of political par
ties from participating in the re
gional parliamentary elections

O I J
set to take place in March. In the
Caucasian republic of Dagestan, for
example, the list of blocked parties in
cludes rightist party STS along with
the Communist Party and the Kreni-

lin?s principal opposition, SPR, also
known as Yabloko. Yabloko is also banned from

running in the cities of Vologda and Samara, as
well as St. Petersburg — its main base of support.

m *— cr r i
Critics of the Kremlin say that the ruling is predicated
on a technicality and accuse President Vladimir Putins
government of silencing his main opponents.

Cat and mouse with Pyongyang
From Beijing, non-governmentally-affiliated U.S. spe
cialists told reporters that high-level North Korean offi
cials had indicated a willingness to give up their nuclear

program in exchange for certain incentives. According to the
specialists — one of whom is a former North Korea policymak
er from the Clinton administration — Pyongyang wants the ener
gy equivalent of 500,000 tons of oil per year along with an end to
the financial sanctions that Washington has imposed on the
regime of leader Kim Jong 11. Communications between the
American specialists and the North Korean officials was not part
of any formal diplomacy, hut may provide insight into the Kim
regime's strategy going into the six-party talks, which are set to re
sume on Thursday after more than a month hiatus.
