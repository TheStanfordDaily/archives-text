Feb. 7,1950: Lake Lag close
to overflow
Weekend rains raised the water in
Lake Lagunita to 90 million gallons.
This brings the lake to within two-and
one-half feet of the top. Clogging in the
drainage ditch has resulted in seepage
coming out in front of Lagunita Court
and the Chemistry Building.
The ASSU has not set a definite
date to open Lake Lagunita for swim
ming. 7Tie Lake is now sufficiently full
and will be held at its present level for
as long as possible."
