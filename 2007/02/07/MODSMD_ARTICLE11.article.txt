# Grace AND Intensity
## MAYERS REFLECTS AFTER YEAR WITH BALLET 
### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
Tina Zoccoli Mayers'o9 did any
thing hut take a year off. In between
high school and Stanford, she spent
10 months as a professional balleri
na with the Washington Ballet,
dancing 40 hours a week in class
and rehearsals.
Born in Los Angeles, Mayers
spent middle and high school in
northern New Jersey, outside of
Manhattan. She studied with Elaine
Kudo, formerly a dancer with the
American Ballet Theatre (ABT),

and did summer programs with the
School of American Ballet and
ABT.
Even after her year as a profes
sional dancer, Mayers said she
never really considered formally
studying dance while at Stanford.
"Coming to Stanford. I wanted
something very different from my
dance experience, because I've had
a very intense dance experience,"
she said."l really feel like I've done
a lot with it, and I wanted to come
here and have something that was
very different so I could explore
something else about myself."

In some ways I did leave because I wanted to do something
where I could have more of a voice.
TINA ZOCCOLI MAYERS, sophomore

Iliis is the first year Mayers has
taken off from dance since she
began at age six and a half, and she
admits missing it.
"That's only natural," she said.
"But you can use your body in a lot
of different ways." adding that she
has gotten more involved in mod
ern dance.
She said her lifestyle is different
now that she's focusing on school.
"There's such intensity, of danc
ing 40 hours a week, eight hours a
day It's really a way of life to move
at that level constantly, and 1 think
this year 1 wanted to see what it was
like to not have that, to not have
that to go back to. to see if anything
else about myself came out."
During the fall of her senior year
in high school. Mayers said that she
was entirely focused on the college
application process.
"All throughout high school,
even though dance was something 1
pursued very seriously, academics
were always my first priority." she
said.
She remembers a conversation
she had with her ballet teacher
early in the fall of her senior year, in
which Mayers' teacher told her she
had the potential and talent to be a
professional if she were interested.
When she got into Stanford
through the early action program,
Mayers began to think about taking
a year off to dance.
Mayers then turned her atten
tion to getting into shape for the
yearly stretch of open auditions in
New York City.
"It's a one-shot deal,so you real
ly have to be able to gather your en
tire presence," she said. "You arrive
at a ballet audition like that and
they're just looking at you, saying, I
door I don't want you in my compa
ny. And it has nothing to do with
where you come from really, or
where you see yourself going. It's a
very fleeting, momentary thing, and
that's what performing is about —
it's about totally just living in the
moment."
The way ballet auditions are
portra, _d in the movies. Mayers
said, is not inaccurate. Dancers are
given numbers to pin to their leo
tards and sometimes not even given
a chance to exhibit their talents.
"1 went to one audition that was
so crowded that we all stood in a
line, snaking around the room,
quite literally, and they walked up
and down and without even seeing
people dance, they started cutting
people based on body type," she
said. "It's reallv something."

Mayers survived the audition
experience and was offered con
tracts with three companies: the
Joffrey Ballet in Chicago, the Col
orado Ballet in Denver and the
Washington Ballet in Washington,
DC.
In April, she accepted a contract
with the Washington Ballet.
"I'd never really spent that much
time in that city and they had a real
ly good lineup and a very young and
vibrant company," she said. "To per
form at the Kennedy Center
seemed like a really good opportu
nity."
During her year in DC., Mayers
"basically lived as an adult, "sharing
an apartment with a roommate,
paying bills and shopping for food.
Every weekday, she would be at
the studio by 9:30 for an hour and a
half of class.
"Any ballet class you take, any
where in the world, has a tradition
al structure," she said. "So every
morning you're taking that class no
matter where you are in the world,
if you're a professional ballet
dancer."
After class, she would be slated
for six hours of rehearsals, but her
devotion to the lifestyle of a profes
sional dancer did not end when she
left the studio.
"It's 40 hours a week, but the
thing about ballet is that your
body's your instrument." Mayers
said. "Which means that even when
you're outside of the dance studio,
you're still being careful. You're al
ways attuned to how to take care of
your body — it's really a whole
comprehensive lifestyle."
During the year, the company's
repertoire included Gisele. The
Nutcracker and Romeo and Juliet.
Of the thirty other dancers in the
company. Mayers said her position
was unique, not only because she
was the youngest, but because she
planned to dance for only a year be
fore heading to college.
"To say it's cultish implies a lot
of really negative things, which is
not what I mean, but it's sort of
cultish in the sense that it's a very
small community that has its own
rules that really don't match up
with modern society." she said.
"When you study music, when
you study acting or theater, you can
often go to a university and it will be
a perfectly compatible experience,"
Mayers added."But classical ballet,
it's its own community and if you're
really serious about it you have to
be in that community. You have to
study with those teachers in New

York and you have to start dancing
when you're 17 years old."
But Mayers said she knew she
didn't want to be a permanent part
of the professional dance communi
ty
"I just wanted to see what the
experience was like," she said. "If 1
had fallen in love with professional
life. I would have definitely pur
sued it. But going into it, I honestly
didn't think I would fall in love
with it, because I didn't want to
give up college and any other ca
reer."
Coming to Stanford, she said,
was a big transition, as she had been
accustomed to living as an adult,
having a fulltime job and having
friends in their 20's and 30's. Sud
denly, she was thrust into a fresh
man dorm and a constant commu
nity.
With regards to the stress and
pressure she faces as a college stu
dent as compared to a dancer, May
ers said there are different stan
dards.
"With dance, you hear a lot in
the media that it's a preoccupation
with your body, and that is true to a
certain extent," she said.
Academic pressure, she added, is
about mental abilities and inde
pendent thought.
"With ballet, unlike other dance
forms, you're much more of a
muse," Mayers added. "The chore
ographer really has creative liberty
and freedom, but the dancers' real
goal in most cases with ballet is to
just exhibit what they're asked to
do. So there's sort of a complacency
n that. In some ways I did leave be
cause I wanted to do something
where I could have more of a
voice."
At Stanford, she has worked to
find this voice, dancing in modern
pieces with the Dance Department
and with its guest artists.
Mayers said she is still thinking
about what role, if any. dance will
play in her future.
"I'm trying not to plan every
thing out, to see what spontaneous
ly happens," she said.
She enjoyed a progressive dance
course she took in the fall with
Anna Halprin, which linked dance
with social change. Mayers is inter
ested in modern dance, choreogra
phy. theater and film.
"The arts will always be an im
portant part of my life," she said."in
some form."

planned to dance for only a year be
fore heading to college.
"To say it's cultish implies a lot
of really negative things, which is
not what I mean, but it's sort of
cultish in the sense that it's a very
small community that has its own
rules that really don't match up
with modern society." she said.
"When you study music, when
you study acting or theater, you can
often go to a university and it will be
a perfectly compatible experience,"
Mayers added."But classical ballet,
it's its own community and if you're
really serious about it you have to
be in that community. You have to
study with those teachers in New

York and you have to start dancing
when you're 17 years old."
But Mayers said she knew she
didn't want to be a permanent part
of the professional dance communi
ty
"I just wanted to see what the
experience was like," she said. "If 1
had fallen in love with professional
life. I would have definitely pur
sued it. But going into it, I honestly
didn't think I would fall in love
with it, because I didn't want to
give up college and any other ca
reer."
Coming to Stanford, she said,
was a big transition, as she had been
accustomed to living as an adult,
having a fulltime job and having
friends in their 20's and 30's. Sud
denly, she was thrust into a fresh
man dorm and a constant commu
nity.
With regards to the stress and
pressure she faces as a college stu
dent as compared to a dancer, May
ers said there are different stan
dards.
"With dance, you hear a lot in
the media that it's a preoccupation
with your body, and that is true to a
certain extent," she said.
Academic pressure, she added, is
about mental abilities and inde
pendent thought.
"With ballet, unlike other dance
forms, you're much more of a
muse," Mayers added. "The chore
ographer really has creative liberty
and freedom, but the dancers' real
goal in most cases with ballet is to
just exhibit what they're asked to
do. So there's sort of a complacency
n that. In some ways I did leave be
cause I wanted to do something
where I could have more of a
voice."
At Stanford, she has worked to
find this voice, dancing in modern
pieces with the Dance Department
and with its guest artists.
Mayers said she is still thinking
about what role, if any. dance will
play in her future.
"I'm trying not to plan every
thing out, to see what spontaneous
ly happens," she said.
She enjoyed a progressive dance
course she took in the fall with
Anna Halprin, which linked dance
with social change. Mayers is inter
ested in modern dance, choreogra
phy. theater and film.
"The arts will always be an im
portant part of my life," she said."in

aave up a classical ballet career to studv at Stanford.
Tina Zoccoli Mayers'o9 did any
thing hut take a year off. In between
high school and Stanford, she spent
10 months as a professional balleri
na with the Washington Ballet,
dancing 40 hours a week in class
and rehearsals.
Born in Los Angeles, Mayers
spent middle and high school in
northern New Jersey, outside of
Manhattan. She studied with Elaine
Kudo, formerly a dancer with the
American Ballet Theatre (ABT),

and did summer programs with the
School of American Ballet and
ABT.
Even after her year as a profes
sional dancer, Mayers said she
never really considered formally
studying dance while at Stanford.
"Coming to Stanford. I wanted
something very different from my
dance experience, because I've had
a very intense dance experience,"
she said."l really feel like I've done
a lot with it, and I wanted to come
here and have something that was
very different so I could explore
something else about myself."

In some ways I did leave because I wanted to do something
where I could have more of a voice.
TINA ZOCCOLI MAYERS, sophomore

Iliis is the first year Mayers has
taken off from dance since she
began at age six and a half, and she
admits missing it.
"That's only natural," she said.
"But you can use your body in a lot
of different ways." adding that she
has gotten more involved in mod
ern dance.
She said her lifestyle is different
now that she's focusing on school.
"There's such intensity, of danc
ing 40 hours a week, eight hours a
day It's really a way of life to move
at that level constantly, and 1 think
this year 1 wanted to see what it was
like to not have that, to not have
that to go back to. to see if anything
else about myself came out."
During the fall of her senior year
in high school. Mayers said that she
was entirely focused on the college
application process.
"All throughout high school,
even though dance was something 1
pursued very seriously, academics
were always my first priority." she
said.
She remembers a conversation
she had with her ballet teacher
early in the fall of her senior year, in
which Mayers' teacher told her she
had the potential and talent to be a
professional if she were interested.
When she got into Stanford
through the early action program,
Mayers began to think about taking
a year off to dance.
Mayers then turned her atten
tion to getting into shape for the
yearly stretch of open auditions in
New York City.
"It's a one-shot deal,so you real
ly have to be able to gather your en
tire presence," she said. "You arrive
at a ballet audition like that and
they're just looking at you, saying, I
door I don't want you in my compa
ny. And it has nothing to do with
where you come from really, or
where you see yourself going. It's a
very fleeting, momentary thing, and
that's what performing is about —
it's about totally just living in the
moment."
The way ballet auditions are
portra, _d in the movies. Mayers
said, is not inaccurate. Dancers are
given numbers to pin to their leo
tards and sometimes not even given
a chance to exhibit their talents.
"1 went to one audition that was
so crowded that we all stood in a
line, snaking around the room,
quite literally, and they walked up
and down and without even seeing
people dance, they started cutting
people based on body type," she
said. "It's reallv something."

Mayers survived the audition
experience and was offered con
tracts with three companies: the
Joffrey Ballet in Chicago, the Col
orado Ballet in Denver and the
Washington Ballet in Washington,
DC.
In April, she accepted a contract
with the Washington Ballet.
"I'd never really spent that much
time in that city and they had a real
ly good lineup and a very young and
vibrant company," she said. "To per
form at the Kennedy Center
seemed like a really good opportu
nity."
During her year in DC., Mayers
"basically lived as an adult, "sharing
an apartment with a roommate,
paying bills and shopping for food.
Every weekday, she would be at
the studio by 9:30 for an hour and a
half of class.
"Any ballet class you take, any
where in the world, has a tradition
al structure," she said. "So every
morning you're taking that class no
matter where you are in the world,
if you're a professional ballet
dancer."
After class, she would be slated
for six hours of rehearsals, but her
devotion to the lifestyle of a profes
sional dancer did not end when she
left the studio.
"It's 40 hours a week, but the
thing about ballet is that your
body's your instrument." Mayers
said. "Which means that even when
you're outside of the dance studio,
you're still being careful. You're al
ways attuned to how to take care of
your body — it's really a whole
comprehensive lifestyle."
During the year, the company's
repertoire included Gisele. The
Nutcracker and Romeo and Juliet.
Of the thirty other dancers in the
company. Mayers said her position
was unique, not only because she
was the youngest, but because she
planned to dance for only a year be
fore heading to college.
"To say it's cultish implies a lot
of really negative things, which is
not what I mean, but it's sort of
cultish in the sense that it's a very
small community that has its own
rules that really don't match up
with modern society." she said.
