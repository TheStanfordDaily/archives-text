### CHRISTIAN L. TOM 
Step aside, Simon Cowell.
Absolute Idol. Stanford's response to the hit
H )X television show, is again a primetime cam
pus event, with auditions being held both lust
weekend and this Saturday.
Absolute Fun co-Chair Patrick Cordova '09.
who is spearheading this year's event.continued
the two-year-old tradition started by current
ASSII President Elizabeth Heng'o7.
"Everyone you meet at Stanford has some
arts background â€” dancing, singing," Heng
said."The arts are everywhere but not expressed
as much they could be. | Idol | is a chance for peo
ple to showcase this."
Organizers are happy with this year's con
testants thus far.
"There was some pop singing, which I
thought was very appropriate," Cordova said.
e"There was lots of Josh Groban as well as' Som

where Over the Rainbow' kind of singing."
Last weekend's round of auditions brought
roughly twenty auditioners toToyon 1 lall to per
form before a panel of students.
Hie judges included recording artist Brodie
Jenkins '09, Judy Asuzu "OS. Jonathan Grossman
'08, ASSU Undergraduate Senate Chair Her
shey Avula '08 and Alison Aver'o7 whose broth
er. Chris '04. is a musician.
"The atmosphere was casual [during the first
round of auditions]." Cordova said. "The judges
were really excellent and had no Simon-esque
activities; they were very constructive."
Also in attendance was Junior Class Presi
dent Brett 1 lammon.who will serve as emcee for
the final round.
After this Saturday, the field will be divided
into three groups of eight.
Three elimination rounds will follow, with the
top two contestants from each night and two
wildcards moving into the finals.
Students will be able to log in to the show's
Web site (http://absoluteidol.stanford.edu) to
vote for their favorite performers during each
round of the contest.
The elimination and final rounds will be
broadcast on Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting

Network (SCBN).
Winners will enjoy a "reign," according to
Cordova, with perks that will include "several
different high profile appearances," such as a
possible cameo in Gaieties, a role in theO-Show,
possible air time on either KZSU or SCBN and
a donation to the charity of their choice.
While some students left something to be de
sired, according to Cordova, others blew the
panel away with their talent.
Other hopefuls were memorable for per
formance aspects outside of their singing, in
cluding unorthodox physical gestures.
"They had their eyes closed and were moving
around." Cordova said, referring to some con
testants. "There was some spastic activity, but no
one was absolutely nuts."
Avula said that sub-par contestants are treat
ed with dignity, no matter how unpopular theii
performance.
"We don't exactly say,' Stop. You're just not
cut out for it.'" he said. "We like to give people a
chance to finish their song and leave knowing
that at least they had the courage to sing in front
of us, when others did not."
