## Editorial Board Commencement choice 
### 
The selection of Dana Gioia as com
mencement speaker, and the subse
quent student reaction to the deci
sion. demands some comment. Gioia is in
deed something of a dark horse choice, and
it is understandable that his lack of celebri
ty. relative to recent commencement
speakers (who have included Tom Brokaw.
Steve Jobs, and former Supreme Court Jus
tice Sandra Day O'Connor), has sent some
ripples of consternation through the stu
dent body — particularly among graduat
ing seniors. It is not unreasonable.or elitist,
for that matter, for students to hope to
have had some acquaintance with the ac
complishments of their commencement
speaker prior to the announcement of his
or her selection. Mr. Gioia, for all the
achievements and honors of his distin
guished career, has not served in the public
eye in such a capacity that this is likely to
be the case for the majority of Stanford stu
dents.
Nevertheless, the level of vitriol with
which some members of the senior class
have reacted to Gioia's selection is wholly
unbecoming of individuals who. in a few
months time, will enjoy the honor of receiv
ing Stanford degrees.The fact of the matter
is that Gioia has been invited by the Uni
versity to give this year's commencement
address and that he has accepted. I le there
fore will indeed be the commencement
speaker, and no protestations — no matter
how shrill or petulant — will change this
outcome. Gioia has been gracious enough
to agree to share with us his insights on life
after The Farm, and he is accordingly due
every respect worthy of a distinguished
guest and returning member of our com
munity.
An ancillary complaint has been raised
that the controversy over Mr. Gioia's selec
tion indicates the need for reform of the
speaker selection procedure so that it is
more responsive to student body input.This
is a fair point, and this is certainly as good an
opportunity as any to re-launch the peren
nial discussion about the general lack of stu -
dent involvement in University decision
making processes. It should be noted,
though, that both President Henessy's of
fice and the senior class presidents have in
sisted that, in the words of an email sent by
Senior Class President FarisAli Mohiuddin.
"a good faith effort [was made] to re
search/pursue every candidate with signifi
cant support from the Senior Class Brain
storming survey." the online survey con
ducted by the senior presidents to identify
commencement speaker candidates. Re

form advocates should therefore realize
that speaker selection is an intrinsically un
certain business, and that no process, no
matter how deferential to student prefer
ences. is guaranteed to result in speakers
who enjoy universal plaudits.
It should likewise be understood that
calls for increased transparency in the
speaker selection process cannot be met in
full because to do so would actually limit the
selection committee's ability to procure a
speaker. If the list of candidates preferred
by the senior class were published in order
based on the number of votes received, for
example, it would be embarrassing for all
parties involved to call up the fifth-choice
candidate after the first four turned the se
lection committee down.
But some practical reforms to the selec
tion process can and should be made. In par
ticular. the voting procedure for candidates
should be made a formal part of the selec
tion process, and it should be made the offi
cial responsibility of the senior class presi
dents that they advocate the resulting short
list to the Office of the University President.
This would be a good clarification of the
present policy, which has resulted in a more
de facto advocacy role for the senior class
presidents. Ensuing senior classes should
also be provided with a list of noted individ
uals with Stanford affiliations lroni which
they can draw for ideas when voting for
their speaker candidate selections, so that
they do not waste their votes on unreason
able choices.
Over the past several years Stanford has
heard commencement addresses from lead
ers of the business world (Carly Fiorina,
Steve Jobs), from politics (Justice O'Con
nor, Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo,
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice), and
from broadcasting (Tom Brokaw). We are
due to hear from a man or woman whose
achievements have been in the arts or hu
manities. Gioia. as an accomplished poet,
critic and chairman of the National Endow
ment of the Arts, is an ideal person to offer
such a perspective.
An added benefit of inviting a man of
letters with a significant and sincere attach
ment to the University is that he is more
likely to offer a meaningful comment on
the threshold Stanford seniors will be pass
ing through, and less liable to indulge in the
boilerplate rhetoric and empty platitudes
that are often characteristic of commence
ment addresses. Perhaps we are investing
too much faith in Gioia's rhetorical talents.
The point remains: celebrity isn't every
thing. Give the man a chance.
