# Typing my second chance
## 
### 
When I was in middle school I actual
ly cheated during an exam. Wow. It
feels good to finally get that off my
chest. It's not as bad as it sounds; it was com
puter class. Yes. my school forced every ten
year-old child to spend an hour each day
learning how to properly type, in a room
that could only be described as hell-on
earth and with a teacher that could only be
described as Mrs. Mustachio.
"That's great."you may be thinking."My
school never offered me typing lessons."
Are you kidding me? I don't know about
you. but when I was in middle school I spent
the majority of my time playing video
games, picking my nose and wondering if
my mom was telling me the truth. ("It hap
pens to every boy your age. honey."). 1 cer
tainly could not focus, nor did I care enough
to learn how to properly type.
So I cheated.The program said not to look
down.but I could not resist. It said to only use
my pointer-fingers for the keys in the middle
of the keyboard, but I still went over to the
land of Ps and Os. The fact that the program
tried to make an exercise fun by having me
race against cartoon animals did not help my
problem. I was an expeditious two-finger-typ
ist and I was not about to lose a race against
Tyson theTypin Tree Monkey just because it
wanted me to use "proper" form, dammit.
Thus began the downward spiral to the
man I am today: A 21-year-old. soon-to-be
college graduate who still uses his index fin
gers to type â€” an "indie typist" you might
say. My deficiency actually did not present
me with any problems until 1 came to Stan
ford; after the quarter when I had to take
both I HUM and PWR my two favorite fin
gers were about to fall off. That's when I
learned to adjust my academic lifestyle.
First of all. the idea of typing a "first
draft" is absurd. Once I start typing I do not
plan on typing this information ever again.
Second. I chose my major wisely. This deci
sion was affected by more than my interests,
career choices and possible graduate school
ambitions. I needed to consider how much
typing would be involved. Obviously fu//v
majors were out of the question. A five page

reflection paper once a week? Absolutely
not. I'd rather take chemistry lab. No. I take
that back; nobody likes chemistry. I'd rather
read a text book and take multiple-choice
tests. Human Biology hit the nail on the
head. Finally, I did have to make some sacri
fices. Writing an honors thesis was a prospect
I had to ignore. And writing for the campus
newspaper? Despite my yearning to voice
my opinion, that idea seemed like torture.
As graduation looms I can't help but
think that maybe I have been missing out on
a crucial element of academia: the ability to
fully express one's thoughts, beliefs, and
opinions through the typed word. Or maybe
I read it on a " Try Something New Each
Day Calendar, hither way. I decided 1
needed to make a change.
The first thing I did was subscribe to Doc
tor Dictionary's Word-of-the-Day email list.
I don't mean to maunder, but after twelve
years of avoiding typing at all costs, my vo
cabulary, not to mention my overall ability to
write effectively and use correct grammar,
has dropped below par. (Was that proper
usage of "maunder"? It was today's word.)
'The next big step would be to undertake a
typing challenge beyond any paper I have
ever written. Unfortunately the deadline to
write an honors thesis had already passed, so
I settled for being a columnist for The Daily.
So far this column has taken me over six
hours to type and there are certainly innu
merable grammatical errors (thank God for
editorial review). Yet,despite the loss of feel
ing in my fingers,the bottom line is that we do
not have to be trapped by our past mistakes
for the rest of our lives. I cheated and I'm

The Indie Typist
sorry, Mrs. Mustaehio. I regret it
everyday. Now I don't want to leave
college wondering what could have
been (typed).
I will spare my readers the cliche

advice to "seize the day." (We still
have time seniors! Live, love and
learn!). Although I will say that sec
ond chances are a luxury that should
not be overlooked. Whether it is tak
ing that class you avoided freshman
year because it had the word ' litera
ture" in the title,or trying an extracur
ricular that is sure to give you carpal
tunnel syndrome, there is no better
time than now to give yourself a sec

ond chance.
Speaking of which. I downloaded
software that guarantees to improve
my typing ability and this time I
promise not to cheat. Unless, of
course. I need to race against Tyson
the Typhi" Tree Monkey.

type some more? Email him at
