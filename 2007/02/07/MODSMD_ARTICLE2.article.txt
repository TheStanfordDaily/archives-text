### JENNIFER LIU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's twelfth annual benefit perform
ance of Eve Ensler's " ITie Vagina Monologues"
will open this year's V-Week in an effort to draw
emphasis to the week's activities and their mes
sage of ending violence against women.
"V-Week consists of more than just the show,
but 'The Vagina Monologues' was more popular
than a lot of the V-Week events last year," said
Paz Hilfinger-Pardo "08, a cast member in the
production. "It's great that so many people at
tend the performances, but V-Week is when
thinking about and processing the messages of
the show occurs.
ITie first performance of the three
da) run is scheduled for tomorrow at
8 p.m. in Annenberg Auditorium. V-
Week activities will then take place
from Feb. 12 to 16.
I'iisler, the founder of the V-Day
movement behind V-Week. based
"The Vagina Monologues" on more
than 2(H) interviews she conducted
with women about their memories
and experiences. Productions of the
show are variations on the same
script. I lilfinger-Pardo said, adding
that this year's performance would in
clude a new monologue from a trans
gender perspective.
Also new this year, said Margo
Watson *09. coordinator of V-Week. is
a post-show discussion during a lunch
at the Women's Community Center
(WCC)on Feb. 12.
"[The show] is great, and it's pow
erful. but it's not perfect," Watson
said. "It's important to have a produc
tive discussion about the issues it pres
ents. 1 ITie Vagina Monologues' is a
way for people to express and release
their discomfort, but it's also a way to
draw attention to subjects left unspo
ken. like sexual assault and genital
mutilation."
I lilfinger-Pardo agreed with these
sentiments and emphasized the im
portance of perspective.
"A lot of different perspectives are
presented in this show, and even I
don't agree with some of them," she
said. "But it's a perspective and a

voice that's out there."
V-Week is organized by the ap
proximately 30 members of Stanford
V-Day. including the self-proclaimed
"Vagina Warriors," who focus on
community outreach. All money
from donations and ticket sales,
which usually adds up to about
$11.(XX), will go to charities. Ninety
percent ol the money raised will go to
the Woodhull Freedom Foundation.a
nonprofit group dedicated to affirm
ing sexual freedom: the other 10 per
cent goes annually to a second chari
t\ selected by the national V-Day or
ganization
Hi is year, the V-Day spotlight
highlights women in conflict zones.
Amparo Vazquez "ON. sexual as
sault program coordinator at the
WCC. said that a Feb. 13 panel will
focus on sexual assault not only in
conflict zones, but at Stanford as well.
In addition, a self-defense workshop
is planned for the end of V-Week.
" There's a big stigma attached to
self-defense workshops," she said.
"People think that they don't need to
learn about self-defense, or that
knowing about it won't help. But
knowing that you can defend yourself
is important, and so is the ability to
walk with confidence. We're trying to
raise awareness about something neg
ative. sexual assault, but we're also
emphasizing the positivity of sexual
freedom."
