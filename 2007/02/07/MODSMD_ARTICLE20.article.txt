# You say you want a revolution

### 
Guys, 1 don't know how to say this, but I
think I'm losing my empathy for the
proletariat.
I'm not sure when the trouble started. Last
1 remember, a few years ago, I reread the
Communist Manifesto as an annual pilgrim
age. opposed marriage because it values
women as private commodities and almost
never said "bourgeois" when I meant "bour
geoisie." Then, next thing 1 know. I'm in a flea
market in Kiev buying two busts of Lenin —
but my heart just isn't in it anymore.
1 guess, looking back on it, the decline of my
certified proletariat-friendly status has been a
long time coming. Sure, every once in a while at
a party I ll call someone's Razor "bourgeois,"
and, depending on my alcohol intake, perhaps
spit on or around their shoes. And whenever I
run into a captain of industry. I unsheathe my
rapier (wit) and let loose a few well-crafted
aphorisms that are meant to sting, by gum. But
in spite of these valiant efforts, I feel myself
every day getting older, whiter, balder and dis
tinctly concerned with equity markets. Plus,
calling them "the proletariat" to their faces
hasn't exactly bolstered my popularity with the
sUxk boys at our local Safeway.
Back in better days. 1 truly believed that the
glorious revolution writhed under the surface

of our desperately reactionary culture. In my
heart of hearts, I earnestly awaited the single
magnificent word that would send our un
washed (but heavily Old Spiced) masses rising
to the top of society.
Growing up, class issues were never a red
button topic in my family. I was raised in a sub
urb of Las Vegas, rubbing shoulders with the
children of croupiers and cocktail waitresses,
quickie divorce lawyers and plastic surgeons.
Although money is always an issue, it was
rarely discussed among my friends. My home
town is one of the fastest-growing cities in
America, which gives it the perpetual unset
tledness of an immigrant community: In one
way or another, most of us found ourselves
there as refugees from something — high
property taxes, bad weather, California —
and bonded together in contempt of the out

side world, instead of letting that contempt
draw lines between us.
My parents complicated any internal class
affiliation by raising my sister and me in a
proudly bohemian household. My father is a
comedy magician and mother got her degree
in visual arts then went on to apply her creativ
ity to raising two kids and one rambunctious
dog full-time. Living on a freelance entertain
ment income gives rise to the paradoxical sit
uation of establishing an affluent lifestyle
while constantly worrying when or even
whether the next check is coming in: We
bought a palatial house in the best school dis
trict, yet wore Payless shoes and seriously dis
cussed the cost-benefit ratio of Jiffy versus
store brand peanut butter.
Store brand usually won.
Growing up. 1 had everything I wanted, but
never paid retail for anything (up to and in
cluding income taxes). Then 1 came to Stan
ford. Until 1 set foot on this campus, 1 thought
that single-sex private boarding schools were
just invented for whimsical children's books
or fetish pornography; my freshman room
mate had to explain that an Audi was not a
