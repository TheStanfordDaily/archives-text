# You say you want a revolution
## 
### 
Guys, 1 don't know how to say this, but I
think I'm losing my empathy for the
proletariat.
I'm not sure when the trouble started. Last
1 remember, a few years ago, I reread the
Communist Manifesto as an annual pilgrim
age. opposed marriage because it values
women as private commodities and almost
never said "bourgeois" when I meant "bour
geoisie." Then, next thing 1 know. I'm in a flea
market in Kiev buying two busts of Lenin —
but my heart just isn't in it anymore.
1 guess, looking back on it, the decline of my
certified proletariat-friendly status has been a
long time coming. Sure, every once in a while at
a party I ll call someone's Razor "bourgeois,"
and, depending on my alcohol intake, perhaps
spit on or around their shoes. And whenever I
run into a captain of industry. I unsheathe my
rapier (wit) and let loose a few well-crafted
aphorisms that are meant to sting, by gum. But
in spite of these valiant efforts, I feel myself
every day getting older, whiter, balder and dis
tinctly concerned with equity markets. Plus,
calling them "the proletariat" to their faces
hasn't exactly bolstered my popularity with the
sUxk boys at our local Safeway.
Back in better days. 1 truly believed that the
glorious revolution writhed under the surface

of our desperately reactionary culture. In my
heart of hearts, I earnestly awaited the single
magnificent word that would send our un
washed (but heavily Old Spiced) masses rising
to the top of society.
Growing up, class issues were never a red
button topic in my family. I was raised in a sub
urb of Las Vegas, rubbing shoulders with the
children of croupiers and cocktail waitresses,
quickie divorce lawyers and plastic surgeons.
Although money is always an issue, it was
rarely discussed among my friends. My home
town is one of the fastest-growing cities in
America, which gives it the perpetual unset
tledness of an immigrant community: In one
way or another, most of us found ourselves
there as refugees from something — high
property taxes, bad weather, California —
and bonded together in contempt of the out

side world, instead of letting that contempt
draw lines between us.
My parents complicated any internal class
affiliation by raising my sister and me in a
proudly bohemian household. My father is a
comedy magician and mother got her degree
in visual arts then went on to apply her creativ
ity to raising two kids and one rambunctious
dog full-time. Living on a freelance entertain
ment income gives rise to the paradoxical sit
uation of establishing an affluent lifestyle
while constantly worrying when or even
whether the next check is coming in: We
bought a palatial house in the best school dis
trict, yet wore Payless shoes and seriously dis
cussed the cost-benefit ratio of Jiffy versus
store brand peanut butter.
Store brand usually won.
Growing up. 1 had everything I wanted, but
never paid retail for anything (up to and in
cluding income taxes). Then 1 came to Stan
ford. Until 1 set foot on this campus, 1 thought
that single-sex private boarding schools were
just invented for whimsical children's books
or fetish pornography; my freshman room
mate had to explain that an Audi was not a


Lewin
Atomic Nectarine
type of belly button.
When a dormmate spilled Dom
Perignon on my favorite hoodie while
pre-partying for a frat kegger. I
snapped. Invoking the sacred
specters of Marx, Mao and Marcuse. 1
smeared on my Commie red war
paint, sharpened my sickle and pre
pared for warfare. Class warfare.
I Tie lirst step was simple. The sum
mer before sophomore year, while all
o! my friends sought out high-pow
ered internships with newspapers and
senators. 1 decided to stay at home
and work at I lollywood Video. He
fore my interview, 1 consulted the
CDC resume guide, triple-checked
my references and cannibalized my
fingernails in a nervous frenzy. Final
ly. 1 drove into the strip mall of my
destiny and met the manager, a twen
ty-year-old woman with a quivering
blue vein in her temple and a crusty
smear of baby formula on the front of
her shirt.
She asked if I was in school; 1 rif
fled through my resume and pointed
to the words "Stanford University"
with one raw fingertip.
"So why are you here?"
1 explained that I was a film minor
while she furrowed her brows suspi
ciously. When she asked my favorite
movie, on a whim 1 decided to forgo
my rehearsed spiel on German ex
pressionism. and instead answered,
"Office Space." She asked if I was free
to begin the next day.
The three months 1 spent at that
1 lollywood Video remain some of the
most enjoyable and formative of my
life. It turns out that my Stanford ex
perience wasn't what raised her
qualms — it was the fact that I was
the only non-manager in our branch
who had graduated high school, peri
od. But the work was easy and fun,
and I took to it like a Jack Russell Ter
rier to an old sock: They tossed me
Membership Renewal Protocols and
$5.75 an hour, and 1 yelped for more.
Best of all. I got to spend time with my
co-workers, real honest-to-goodness
members of the proletariat! Just us.

hanging out as colleagues, prole to
prole! One of them even taught me
how to use a mop.
What with my fancy Stanford edu
cation, it didn't take long to realize
that although we had the same jobs,
the actual work my co-workers and I
did was very different. I rushed in 10
minutes early every day to begin al
phabetizing movies before cloeking
in: my eight-months-pregnant assis
tant manger Emily spent the first halt
hour of her shift massaging her ankles
behind the counter after walking two
miles from the apartment she shared
with her boyfriend's mother. 1 com
plained when customers wreaked
havoc in my carefully arranged dis
plays; Brendan the night manager
slashed at concessions shipments
with a pair of box cutters, hoping to
"accidentally" rip a bag of Reese's
Pieces so he could take them home to
his three-year-old daughter as dam
aged goods. I spent eight hours a day
in my polyester uniform working as
an ironic, self-deprecating jab at my
over-privileged intellectual lifestyle;
my co-workers, I guess, missed that
level of satire.
One day Emily asked me for a few
dollars, just until payday. She had to
buy something for dinner and, she
cleared her throat and avoided my
eye, accidentally forgot her wallet.
After that. I ran to the delicatessen
across the street three times a week
and bought us turkey sandwiches. I
would bolt mine down then scan the
Previously Viewed racks for movies
on which to squander my employee
discount. She nibbled with epic pa
tience, biting in neat little rows, spin
ning slowly in a rolling chair. More
often than not. she wrapped up the
second half to take home for later.
Every day she told me with a straight
face that she would pay me back to
morrow.
Even then. 1 still hoped 1 might be
among their ranks.Then, near the end
of the summer. 1 started complaining
to my co-workers about the injustice
of the minimum wage racket — that
we make peanuts straining our backs
and pinching nerves in our necks re
stocking thousands of copies of some
terrible Queen Latifah DVDs in an
aesthetically pleasing "Cascading
Waterfall" configuration, while some

fat cat reclines in his leather executive
chair smoking cigars wrapped in hun
dred dollar bills. What about human
dignity? Is integrity only a word? It's
time for a revolution. 1 screamed — is
Tuesday good for everybody?
"Just shut up, Kat," Emily said, her
face strangely static, exhausted. "11118
isn't a game. This is my fucking job."
Two weeks later, our manager cut
Emily's hours and increased mine, as
a reward for my hard work and en
thusiasm. to say nothing of the fact
that I got paid 25 fewer cents an hour.
Emily stared at the time sheet in real
terror, her jaw clicking.
Finally it dawned on me —no
amount of ideology or tacky poly
ester could make me a member of the
proletariat. Yes, I worked a minimum
wage job and had the same superficial
gripes as the co-workers I adored, but
at the end of the day. 1 got to go home
to my big screen television and
leather couches. Emily went home to
bills and a baby and a whole lifetime
of what for me was just a strenuous
summer-long game.
1 guess that was the beginning of
the end. When 1 returned to Stanford
after my long hot working-class sum
mer. I still had disdain for the design
er jeans and luxury cars, but deep
down I knew 1 was unworthy of that
disdain. While I still hold my basic val
ues to light against elitism and con
spicuous consumption and to struggle
unceasingly for basic human equality,
over time I've realized that a fantasy
connection to a nonexistent prole
tariat, this imagined empathy, is not a
role one can slip into at will. In spite of
my best wishes, it is clear that by ran
dom virtue of birth and culture I am
bourgeois-phone-coveting, credit
card-wielding part of the very ma
chine that oppresses the glorious rev
olution of which 1 si ill so fervently
dream.
Even as I type this, the bust of
Lenin on my desk stares down at me
reproachfully. Sorry I let you down,
comrade.
