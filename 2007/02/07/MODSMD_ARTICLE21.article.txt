# A
						new approach to literary criticism
## 
### 
There are many "-isms" in the field of lit
erary criticism — "post-modernism,"
whatever the hell that means;
"deconstructivism," best talked about in
terms of what it is not. rather than what it is:
and the various "-isms" relating to creating
heroes of all the women, minorities, and es
pecially women-minorities in a work of liter
ature.just to name a few.
Mut I propose a new-ism:Anti-textualism.
In this "-ism," you assume that the author
didn't really mean what the author actually
meant, and support this argument with rea
sons that not only lack textual evidence but
heavily reflect personal preferences, biases
and even prejudices. Essentially,you don't let
the idea of "textual evidence" get in the way
of understanding a work.
For instance, take John Steinbeck's mas
terpiece, Hie Grapes of Wrath. Hailed by
many as "The Great American Epic," it has
received a great deal of praise in high literary
circles for its stark depiction of the suffering
of the Great Depression.
Or so its Wikipedia entry suggests.
Despite its terrific reputation. I have
never read The Grapes of Wrath. But! I won't
let this get in the way of my careful scrutiny,
using Anti-textualist techniques.
For you see. the work in question creates a
flawed notion of"heroity."(ln the Anti-textu
alist response, one need not use actual words
— in fact, one is actively encouraged to create
them. The more letters the better, and bonus
points for "-ity" and words which appear to
have Greek/Latin roots, e.g. Bathycolpian).
Investigating skewed representations of
the totality and omnipresence of the
good/evil dichotomy, Steinbeck's master
piece ironically obscures the more crucial

question of cultural anthropology. Indeed,
there exists a certain Est-ce que vans ftes ivre
— might our narrator lack appropriate
grounding for his notion of "brave-ity" and
audaciousness?
(The use of French or other Western-Eu
ropean languages in a lengthy and ultimately
meaningless explicatory paragraph adds le
gitimacy to your claims, despite what the
phrases actually mean. Here, the phrase
means, "Are you drunk?" But no one has to
know that.)
In many ways, the hero in The Grapes of
Wrath is not *Namc omitted*, but instead
the grapes. Good and good for you, the true
winner here today is Welch's, creator of such
fine products as 100% calcium-fortified
Welch's Grape Juice. Welch's Grape Jelly and
Welch's On-The-Go Fruit snacks, the fat
free, on-the-move snack for today's busy kid!
As you can see, this is a wonderful market
for advertisers and marketing executives.
The field of literary criticism is a largely un
tapped goldmine for burgeoning entrepre
neurs: Wh;it better way to sell your product
than to sne;ik it into a scholarly article about
a masterpiece only tangentially-rclated to it?
William Faulkner's harrowing novel As I
Lay Dying can be used to sell funerary servic
es. And wouldn't it be .1 Catch-22 if you were

stuck with the other two brands of peanut
butter? Alice Walker's The Color Purple, a
powerful novel investigating racism in Amer
ica , can be used to market the "Purple Pill "
Prilosec, offering 24-hour heartburn relief.
Seeking to tear down the imperialist socio
rhetoric of neo-capitalists. Anti-textualism it
sell can be seen as a particularly populist form
of rhetorical criticism It seeks to liberate a
work from the often cumbersome bonds of
"meaning and "significance." and this is an
exercise in which we can all participate.
Anti-textualism is a thought-exercise in
which I regularly engage, and I would encour
age all ot you to do the same. Have a boring
essay due on a book that you just don't want
to read? lake the Anti-textualist approach
and ignore the prompt entirely, as you write
an essay about a Spiderman comic book that
you particularly enjoyed. As long as the
prose is inflated and meaningless, and as long
as it conforms to the minimum page require
ment. its fair game. The teacher will be im
pressed with your avant-gardism and sheer
Outside-of-the-boxedness.
It is a common criticism levied against lit
erary circles that we are moving too far away
from substance and legitimacy in our disci
pline. lb my critics. I need point out only one
'law in this logic: there is still an "-ism" at the
end ol whatever I am doing, so I am still bet
ter than you. Remember this as you sit back to
enjoy your cool and refreshing Welch's Grape
juice product, brought to you by the good
people at John Steinbeck Ltd.
