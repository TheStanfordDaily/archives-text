### BY SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off a successful showing in last week
end's dual meet at No. 3 California, the divers
from Stanford's top-ranked women's swimming
and diving team head to Federal Way, Wash., this
weekend for the Pac-10 Championships.
Against the Golden Bears, senior Cassidy
krug took first in the one-meter and three-meter
events and junior Katie Lampe finished third in
each. Cardinal divers have recently been success
ful against other Pac-10 rivals as well, with Krug
and sophomore Sarah Ohr taking first and second
in the one-meter event against No. 14 Southern
California on Jan. 20. Krug also placed first in the
one-meter against No. 16 UCLA on Jan. 19.
"We have a really tight community of divers in
the Pac-10," Lampe said. "We really know who
our competition is and are going to he prepared
for them."
Head diving coach Rick Schavone is pleased
with the team's success at this point in the season,
but wary of putting too much faith in the squad's
achievements so far.
"Our team has been very successful, but 1
would say our performance has really only been
fair to good." he said. "I think we can be reason
ably successful at the Pac-10 Championships, but
1 am concerned about whether we can go farther."
This year's most notable performer for Stan
ford has been Krug. who has recorded victories in
each of the Cardinal's dual meets and finished
second in both the one- and three-meter events at
the Indiana Open Invitational in November. She
was named Pac-10 Diver of the Month for No
vember and recently returned from a World

Junior Katie Lampe and the re~+ of the Cardinal
divers will compete in this weekend's Pacific-10
Conference Championships. Lampe will look to
improve on a sophomore campaign in which she
finished in the top 10 three times: one-meter spring
board, three-meter springboard and platform.
Championship selection camp in In
dianapolis. l ast year, krug placed
second in both diving events at the
Pac-10 Championships.
"Cassidy is probably the best
diver Stanford has ever had. and it's
reall\ motivating to practice along
side her." Lampe said. "She's so pos
itive and is a great teammate."
Lampe's praise of Krug down
plays her own important role on the
Stanford team. In addition to her
season-best pair of third places last
weekend. Lampe has consistently
brought in points for the Cardinal
throughout the season and has high
hopes for this weekend's meet.
"Last weekend felt really good,
but I still think there are things I
could have done better." she said.
"My goal for this weekend is to
make the finals in all three diving
events: platform, one-meter and
three-meter."
Last season. Lampe placed fifth
in the three-meter.eighth in the plat
form and ninth in the one-meter at
the Pac 10 Championships. She also
was a finalist at the NCAA Zone
I meet, where she placed 12th in
the one-meter, 15th in the three
meter and 24th in the platform.
Iliis year, in addition to her per
sonal goals. Lampe is embracing her
position as an upperclassman on the
team. She is excited to work with her
team as they head into this week
end's competition.
"It's really exciting as a team to
go into the championships after our
great season and the meet at Cal last
weekend." she said."l think that as a
team we can score the highest this
weekend."
Lampe herself is looking toward
the leadership of Schavone, who has
coached her since she was 13.
"He has been a huge part of my
life both in and out of the pool." she
said. "He is one of the main reasons I
wanted to dive at Stanford."
Schavone is obviously proud of
all Lampe has accomplished
throughout her diving career.

DIVING CHAMPIONSHIPS
Federal Way,
Washington
MEET NOTES: The Stanford divers will com
pete this week in the conference champi
onships, where they will battle athletes from
Arizona, Arizona State, California, UCLA
and USC. In dual meet competition, Stan
ford's Cassidy Krug posted the top scores in
both the 1 -meter and 3-meter diving events
against all five conference opponents,
though sometimes diving exhibitions which
did not count toward the team point total.
Krug placed second in both events last year
while teammate Katie Lampe placed in the
top ten in three events at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships.

"It's been tremendously reward
ing to watch her grow up," he said.
"Since she has come to Stanford, she
really increased her strength, which
added ability to her already strong
skills. She has shown that she can be
a national-level college tower diver,
and I think she could reach that level
in the springboard as well."
Krug, Lampe and Ohr are joined
on the Cardinal squad by freshmen
Shana Karp and Carmen Stellar and
junior Brooke Sullivan. Karp fin
ished seventh and eighth in the one
and three-meter events last week
end and Stellar took sixth place in
both. Sullivan last placed at the
UCLA meet, where she finished
sixth in the one-meter.
"My goals for this weekend are to
pick up our level of diving and score
as many points as possible for the
swim team," Schavone said. "I think
we can have two or three of our
divers final in each event."
