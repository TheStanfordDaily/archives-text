### BY SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off a successful showing in last week
end's dual meet at No. 3 California, the divers
from Stanford's top-ranked women's swimming
and diving team head to Federal Way, Wash., this
weekend for the Pac-10 Championships.
Against the Golden Bears, senior Cassidy
krug took first in the one-meter and three-meter
events and junior Katie Lampe finished third in
each. Cardinal divers have recently been success
ful against other Pac-10 rivals as well, with Krug
and sophomore Sarah Ohr taking first and second
in the one-meter event against No. 14 Southern
California on Jan. 20. Krug also placed first in the
one-meter against No. 16 UCLA on Jan. 19.
"We have a really tight community of divers in
the Pac-10," Lampe said. "We really know who
our competition is and are going to he prepared
for them."
Head diving coach Rick Schavone is pleased
with the team's success at this point in the season,
but wary of putting too much faith in the squad's
achievements so far.
"Our team has been very successful, but 1
would say our performance has really only been
fair to good." he said. "I think we can be reason
ably successful at the Pac-10 Championships, but
1 am concerned about whether we can go farther."
This year's most notable performer for Stan
ford has been Krug. who has recorded victories in
each of the Cardinal's dual meets and finished
second in both the one- and three-meter events at
the Indiana Open Invitational in November. She
was named Pac-10 Diver of the Month for No
vember and recently returned from a World
