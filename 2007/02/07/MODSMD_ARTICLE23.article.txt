"There is a good field of teams this year."

head coach Conrad Ray said. "Hawaii is a
venue that draws top teams this time of year
because of the amazing weather and the
good course. This is the type of course where
the wind doesn't blow, so sometimes the
golfers have to get aggressive and get some
birdies to win. I know that the guys are up to
the challenge."

TOL ■ :: ■ r'S. Stanford will be one of 1 8 teams
at this weekend's Hilo Invitational, trying to improve its
third-place finish in the same event last year. At No. 2
in the nation, Stanford will be the highest-ranked team
at Hilo, but it should face stiff competition from No. 3
Oklahoma State and several other ranked opponents.
The Cardinal has not competed since the fall season,
when the team placed first in three of its five tourna
ments. Senior Zack Miller won the individual title three
out of five times as well and was named the Pac-10
Golfer of the Month and Golf World Golfer of the
Week.
four low scores for each day will go
on the scoring record.There will be
no ties in this tournament — the
fifth score will serve as a tie break
er. Sudden-death matches between
individual competitors will also
serve to break individual score ties.
"Each golfer on the team has to
play his own game and do what he
needs to do." Ray said. "It each guy
does what he needs to do, everyone
should add to a great team score."
Last year. Stanford ended the
tournament with a three-round
total of 858 (284-293-281). earning
fifth place among the 18 highly
ranked teams playing last season.
Individually, the Cardinal has
some phenomenal players. Right
now, senior Zack Miller is leading
the team with three individual
tournament wins and a 71.6
stroke average. He also won a
spot on Golf World magazine's
All-American team. Along with
Miller, each golfer on the team
has finished a tournament placing
in the top 20 at least once during
the fall season.
"Zach is leading the charge for
us with three wins." Ray said. "The
guys had some great individual per
formances this fall. Everyone is
playing well."
During the five events of the fall
season, Stanford managed to cap
ture three tournament wins while
ranking in the top five teams com
peting in each event. The Cardinal
ended the season on a good note,
with a tournament win at the Corde
Valle Classic in November. With
such an outstanding performance in
the fall. Stanford has high hopes
going into the Hilo Invitational to
morrow.
"We were really excited about
our performance during the fall
season," Ray said. "The guys gained
confidence and felt good about
their play during the fall and off
season: however, we are only
halfway to our goal of going to the
NCAA Championships."
