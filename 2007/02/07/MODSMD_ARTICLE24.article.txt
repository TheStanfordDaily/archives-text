# Not another Super Bowl column
## 
### 
This column is not about the
Super Bowl. Hie Super Bowl
was a boring affair for all but the
most diehard Colts or Bears fans and
those who tune in to the Nil. once a
year.
Iliat's really not anything new ei
ther, because- the NFLs championship
game is the one sporting event that is
more about the non-sports fan than
the fanatic. As much hype is given to
the half-time show and the commer
cials as to the game, and ( BS sees the
need to force Katie Couric on us for
yet another heartwarming story about
I lines Ward reconnecting with his Ko
rean heritage and changing that na
tion's views on children of mixed
racial backgrounds.
ITiat one was a fantastic story last
February. Now? I lonestly Katie, you
could have done better.
No. this column is not about the
Super Bowl. Because it was bad. Good
for Peyton that he finally won the big
one; good for Tony Dungy and for mi
norities in the N FL and pro sports; and
good for CBS, which garnered outra
geous ratings for a mediocre game.
Bad for the rest of us who sat through
a few hours of agonizingly sloppy play,
all for the hope that maybe, just
maybe. Manning would display the
smallest shred of human emotion.
Crack a smile. Maybe even laugh a lit
tle. 1 wasn't holding out for a Steve
Young or Shannon Sharpe kind of
hysterical breakdown, but something
just a bit raw and unrehearsed would
have been nice.
But we. the fans, didn't get that, so
this column is not about the Super
Bowl. And it's definitely not about the
Super Bowl commercials. Especially
not the Snickers commercial that was
wrong on so many levels that it's al
ready been pulled off the air.
It's not about the sporting dol
drums of February, either. With the
NBA and NHL still mired in their re
spective midseason modes, pitchers
and catchers yet to report, March
Madness still weeks away and even
NFL free agency on hold until next
month, February is truly the worst
time of the year for sports fans. But
we've been there and done that in this
column, and I don't think we need to
