# Not another Super Bowl column
## 
### 
This column is not about the
Super Bowl. Hie Super Bowl
was a boring affair for all but the
most diehard Colts or Bears fans and
those who tune in to the Nil. once a
year.
Iliat's really not anything new ei
ther, because- the NFLs championship
game is the one sporting event that is
more about the non-sports fan than
the fanatic. As much hype is given to
the half-time show and the commer
cials as to the game, and ( BS sees the
need to force Katie Couric on us for
yet another heartwarming story about
I lines Ward reconnecting with his Ko
rean heritage and changing that na
tion's views on children of mixed
racial backgrounds.
ITiat one was a fantastic story last
February. Now? I lonestly Katie, you
could have done better.
No. this column is not about the
Super Bowl. Because it was bad. Good
for Peyton that he finally won the big
one; good for Tony Dungy and for mi
norities in the N FL and pro sports; and
good for CBS, which garnered outra
geous ratings for a mediocre game.
Bad for the rest of us who sat through
a few hours of agonizingly sloppy play,
all for the hope that maybe, just
maybe. Manning would display the
smallest shred of human emotion.
Crack a smile. Maybe even laugh a lit
tle. 1 wasn't holding out for a Steve
Young or Shannon Sharpe kind of
hysterical breakdown, but something
just a bit raw and unrehearsed would
have been nice.
But we. the fans, didn't get that, so
this column is not about the Super
Bowl. And it's definitely not about the
Super Bowl commercials. Especially
not the Snickers commercial that was
wrong on so many levels that it's al
ready been pulled off the air.
It's not about the sporting dol
drums of February, either. With the
NBA and NHL still mired in their re
spective midseason modes, pitchers
and catchers yet to report, March
Madness still weeks away and even
NFL free agency on hold until next
month, February is truly the worst
time of the year for sports fans. But
we've been there and done that in this
column, and I don't think we need to


Griffin
Rants and Raves
go there again.
This column isn't about Barry
Bonds either. The Giants' embattled
slugger who made the news yet again
when San Francisco presented him
with a contract that could be voided
if Bonds is indicted â€” presumably
on a charge of perjury before the
grand jury when he testified on his
dealings with BALCO, Greg Ander
son and steroids. We've all heard
enough to form our own opinions on
the Bonds soap opera,and anything I
wrote here probably wouldn't
change your mind.
Moreover, has anyone ever pon
dered just how ridiculous it is that the
media devotes so much coverage to
Bonds, not because he very well may
have taken illegal performance-en
hancing drugs in an era when many
players were taking them, but rather

because he was the most successful of
these players? Bonds is singled out
not for cheating, but for being the
most successful cheater. It's an unfor
tunate disservice to the game and a
gross omission on all our parts that
the other possible steroid abusers of
the late '90s and early '00s aren't fac
ing more scrutiny as well. So this col
umn isn't about Bonds, Bonds on
Bonds or baseball on Bonds.
This column is rather about just
how much the NFL rules the world
of the American sports fan. The
sporting realm won't seem whole
again until September rolls around
and the greatest spectator sport in
North America, and possibly any
where. reenters our lives with its
promises of another riveting season
of head-on collisions, quarterback
drama and coaching changes.
Super Bowl XLI was. beyond a
doubt, the worst of this past decade
on an entertainment scale. Its nearest
competitor for the dishonor was
probably last year's Steelers' victory,
which carried with it the retirement

of Jerome Bettis. the controversies
over the officiating and Pittsburgh's
record-tying fifth Super Bowl ring.
The 2(H)1 contest between the Balti
more Ravens and the New York Gi
ants was also difficult to watch, but
given the amazing Ravens defense, at
least there was the sense that the
team had some elements of great
ness. And coupled with Ray Lewis'
recent brush with the law there was
something to talk about.
That 1 still can't get the NFL out
of my head, even after Manning's
dullest of victories on the grandest of
stages, is a sign of either my own in
sanity or the fanatical grip this sport
has on the country. I've just seen Rex
Grossman give away a champi
onship and Peyton Manning only re
luctantly take it from him, and 1 still
can't wait for free agency, the draft
and even preseason.This is an obses
sion.
This is the NFL.
