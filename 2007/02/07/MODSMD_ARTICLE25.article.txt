# Tabitha Yim Women's Gymnastics
## Yim a humble tumbler 
### BY CALEY ANDERSON 
Tahitha Yim does not like to talk about herself. "I
am not special." the 5-foot-2 junior said. "Real
ly, I'm not." The numbers, however, speak dif
ferently.
Yim was named the Pacific-10 Conference Gymnast
of the Week for Jan. 23-29, and has garnered seven Ail-
American honors during the past two seasons, including
winning the All-Around title at the Pac-10 ( hampi
onships in 2(MK>.
What she does like to discuss is her team. Ask a ques
tion about her teammates, and her eyes light up. Due to
scheduling, traveling and practice, teammates naturally
spend a lot of time together, but the women's gymnastics
squad seems especially close.
"You hear a lot of people say they love everyone on
the team, but we really do," Yim said. "We respect each
other's differences and different interests outside of the
gym. which makes it better when we come back togeth
er."
Those who believe athletes do not have a life outside
of their sport would be mistaken when it comes to Stan
ford's women's gymnastics team. In fact, the diverse in
terests and focus on academics is what attracted Yim to
Stanford in the first place.
It was off-putting for Yim that most other schools re
cruiting her did not even require her to apply.
"Even though the application process [for Stanford]
was hard, I feel like I earned a spot here,' she said. "I
know I'm not going to be doing gymnastics forever, and
in high school I sacrificed a lot for it. so 1 wanted to have
the complete school experience in college."
That does not mean her time at Stanford has been a
breeze. Juggling the double life of a student and an ath
lete is a constant battle, one that Yim declared she is get
ting better at handling. It helps that her coaches believe
that school comes before sports.

"I don't like to tell people
I'm a gymnast because it's
not who I am. It's what I do."

"Managing your time is hard,and it is hard to study on
the road.but you have to,"Yim said."Hut I like it here;it s
a good fit."
It was almost a non-fit, though. At tirst Yim decided
that she was going to attend I '('LA. It was her brother,
Jonathan, who told her she should look at Stanford.
"I was intimidated at first because it's Stanford, and
my parents wanted me to stay close to home, Yim said.
"But he said I should check it out."
Luckily for Stanford, Yim listened to her big brother s
advice â€” not surprising when considering the large influ
ence he has on her life.The two are incredibly close.
"He's my biggest fan," Yim said. "Me comes to meets;
he gives me pep talks. I'm lucky to have that good support
system of family, and I appreciate it even more now that
I've been away at college for a few years.
Yim also liked the prospect of mixing with all of her
fellow freshmen at Stanford, instead of being sequestered
into an all-athlete dorm and known only as the gymnast.
"My freshman year, most of the people in my dorm
didn't even know I was a gymnast until winter quarter.
Yim said.
Anonymity is not a luxury Yim can always afford,
though, because of her time on the U.S. Gymnastics
Team; it also doesn't hurt that she was one of the hottest
prospects to join the US. Olympic squad in 2(K)4. Unfor
tunately. she snapped her Achilles tendon right before

the Olympic Team Training Camp and spent the
summer with her family recuperating instead of
competing in Athens. If the response to her injury
is any indication, Yim has quite the fan base.
Following her injury, fans sent flowers and gifts
to Yim's home, at one point filling her entire living
room.
"1 was really touched," Yim said.'i never real
ized before how you could reach people. People
are actually watching. It makes me want to be a
better person, knowing 1 could make a difference."
Another perk of fame? I laving your own page
on Wikipedia.
"I'm so embarrassed," Yim said."! don't like to
tell people I'm a gymnast because it's not who I
am; it is what 1 do."

Yim continually emphasizes that she could not
do it, however, without the strength of her team be
hind her.
"If you have a good day and the team has a bad
day, it doesn't matter" she said. "It's about per
forming as a team."
Last year, the squad lost in Regionals, ending
their quest for an NCAA bid. After winning the
Pac-10 Championship, not making it to the
NCAAs was disappointing.
"It had an impact." Yim said."We are not going
to repeat last year; we are more motivated.
"We came in this year with a different mindset
and perspective than in previous years," she added.
"We decided to do more to be successful in the
postseason and have committed and sacrificed a

lot this year, and it is helping."
The team also received a boost this year in the
form of five new freshmen: Stephanie Carter. All
yse Ishino, Carly Janiga, Blair Ryland and lenaya
West.
"I can't say enough about the freshmen. Yim
said. "I love them. They bring new. fresh energy to
the team.They come in on their days off; it is inspir
ing."
In addition to energy, the freshmen add ;i cru
cial element: depth. Yim contends that the Stan
ford team can go eight or 10 girls deep in every
event, which gives much-needed confidence and
allows for the occasional break.
