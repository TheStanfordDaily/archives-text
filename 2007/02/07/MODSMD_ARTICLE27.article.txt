ITie Stanford fencing team will head into the post

showing at the Western Invitational. The men swept
the tournament, with the women finishing second
only to Northwestern.
The closest challenge for the men was a nail-biting
14-13 victory over Air Force. The women had a close
match of their own, edging out UC-San Die go, also
by a score of 14-13.
The two most impressive squads were women's
sabre at fvO. men's foil at 5-1 and men's epee also at
5-1. Sophomore sabreist Eva Jellinson finished 17-0,
and is now 38-1 on the season. Freshman standout
foilists Julian White and Phil Arredondo each fin
ished with 10-2 records. Junior foilist Rick Fulton fin

ished 9-1 for the weekend.
I lead coach Lisa Milgram was pleased with the re
sults and is looking forward to the young team's fu
ture. Hie Cardinal's post-season begins with the first
round of the NCAA tournament on March 11. again
in San Diego.
"We will attempt to qualify as many individuals
(as we can] to the NCAA Championships in Drew
University. NJ, which happens during finals week in
March." Milgram said. "Last year, we qualified six,
and we are hoping for more this year."
I"he other teams competing in the tournament
were CalTech.C'al State Fullerton and North Caroli
na.
Stanford will face some stiffer competition in the
weeks to come, and Milgram believes her squad is
ready for anything.
"As of now, the entire traveling team has qualified
for the first time ever." she said. "Every person has a
record strong enough to enter the Western Regionals
and take their shot for the championships."
