## Acid leak at SLAC quickly contained 
### JENNIFER LIU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Palo Alto Fire Department was called
to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SI.AC) yesterday morning to contain a sulfu
ric acid leak. There were no injuries, and all
SLAC buildings were open for work by 8 a.m.
Lee Lyon '65. Director of Human Re
sources at SLAC.said that the cause of the leak
was still unknown.
According to Lyon, the cooling tank that
leaked the mixture of water and acid was dis
covered early in the morning during a routine
maintenance check and was immediately re
ported to the Palo Alto Fire Department,
which maintains an on-site service facility.
ITie fire department's hazardous materials
team, backed up b\ an additional
crew from Mountain View, spent ap
proximately three hours evaluating
the situation. According to The San
Jose Mercury News, the crews used
an absorbent material to soak up the
10 to 15 gallons of water and acid.
"We had to make sure that the
acid wasn't spreading and harming
the environment," Lyon said. "It
didn't. Nobody was in danger and
there were no injuries, so we're pret
ty pleased."
Five people were evacuated from
the only SLAC building located
near the leaking cooling tower.
At SLAC. the circulating water
used to cool the heat generated by
the accelerator is pumped into cool
ing towers,exposed to air and re-cir
culated. Chemicals are added to the
water to prevent contamination by
algae or mold. The acidity of the
mixture that leaked yesterday
morning was comparable to that of
lemon or orange juice, Lyon said.
ITie leaking tower will be out of
commission until repairs are made.
