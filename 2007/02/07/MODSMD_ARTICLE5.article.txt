# Grad formal has steep price tag
## Open bar, live entertainment contribute to escalating costs 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I his year's (iraduate Student Formal promis
es to he a one-of-a-kind event — at least in how
much it costs.
Planning lor the event has been marked by ad
hoc funding and several unexpected increases in
costs that have rendered it one of the most expen
sive student-organized dance events at Stanford.
ITie Graduate Student C ouncil (GSC) is plan
ning the event for the second consecutive year.
Last year, the formal cost the GSC only $16,000.
ITie same amount was allocated for this year's for
mal.

But costs quickly started piling
up well past that number.
In late November, the event's
planners asked the GSC for an
additional $10,000. saying they
needed the money for a live band.
The vote to allocate this extra
funding passed unanimously. One
week later, formal planners asked
for another $10,000. this time to
make sure they had enough funds
to sign contracts for the venue
and the entertainment.
"We have to know we have the
money," GSC member and event
planner Donna Winston said at
the time, adding that the money
would be returned to the GSC if it
could be offset by funds from the
Graduate Student Programming
Board (GSPB).
The GSPB contributed the
funds — at the expense of a
spring mixer—but formal or
ganizers are still holding onto the
money from the GSC
Ultimately even the addition
al $20,000. plus the original
$16,000 allocated in the GSC's
budget, was not enough, forcing
organizers to raise ticket prices
despite November claims that

they would not do so.
"It we have this additional funding, that would
help us lower the price back to $25 [the same price
as last year]." (JSC member and event planner
Fen Zhao said in the tall."lf we increase the price
to $30. which is something I've talked about, $30
would be enough to cover everything."
When the additional funding was granted, tick
et prices remained at $30. provided they are
bought before Feb. 18. If purchased after that
date, tickets will be $35 each.
According to those organizing the formal, the
event's cost could rise to $54,000 if all the 600

available tickets sell out — as they
did last year and are expected to this
year.
If all 600 tickets are sold, the for
mal will cost $90 per person, far ex
ceeding some of the most expensive
student dances on campus.
The Viennese Ball and the Senior
Formal not only accrue smaller event
costs, but they also attract over twice
as many people, leading to per person
costs that are half that of the graduate
formal. The Sophomore Formal cost
only $10,000. despite drawing over
800 students.
About two-thirds of the total cost
of the graduate formal — approxi
mately $35,000 — will pay for food
and drinks at the party, including a
three-hour open bar. Another
$10,000 is going to pay for the enter
tainment. including a live band that
will perform two shows.
Organizers also said in November
that the rising costs were due, in part,
to the decision to host the formal in
San Jose. But they later changed the
venue, moving it back to the Crowne
Plaza Cabana in Palo Alto, citing long
transportation times to San Jose as
the reason.

I ■ vent organizers now say this
year's formal is costing more because
of more expensive food, an addition
al hour for the open bar and the live
band.
Ihev added that the open bar and
live entertainment make the party
cost more than similar events such as
the Viennese Ball and the undergrad
uate formats, which lack such ameni
ties.
Planners also insist that the final
cost could still change, citing such un
foreseeable expenses as "puke fees"
in case someone vomits on the buses
chartered for the night.
But others who have had experi
ence in planning similar events say
that costs for such occurrences are
easy to project.
"We typically have a very good
sense of how much the dance will
cost." Viennese Ball organizer Jessi
1 lumphreys *()S told The Daily in an
email. "Things like puking on the bus
shouldn't alter the cost — but in fact
we have almost no unknowns. Every
thing is set from the amount of food
to the shuttle system to the bands and
sound."
The graduate formal also stands
out in another way. Where under
graduate formals can usually accom
modate most members of their re
spective classes, the graduate formal
has only 600 tickets available for a
student body of over 8.000.

According to event organizers,23o
tickets had already been sold by Mon
day.
Most of the money for the formal
comes from the student fees paid by
graduate students. Some in the GSC
are concerned that the event is paid
for by the entire graduate student
population, even though relatively
few can attend.
"In the future ticket prices will
have to match the costs." GSC Fund
ing Committee Chair Adam Beberg
told The Daily in an email. "This will
not be an ongoing draw on reserves,
and we've made that clear to every
one."
Those involved with the formal
say the limited number of tickets is
partly due to size constraints.
"Ideally we'd love to have a venue
that would hold <S,()(X) people," said
GSC co-Chair Jenny Allen (also a
senior staff writer for The Daily),
adding that such a venue is impossible
to find.
Organizers defend the intention of
the formal, saying it provides some
thing for graduate students that many
felt was missing.
"They're the reason we're putting
on this event," Allen said. "We're try
ing to make this economical for stu
dents so they can afford it."

ganizers are still holding onto the
money from the GSC
Ultimately even the addition
al $20,000. plus the original
$16,000 allocated in the GSC's
budget, was not enough, forcing
organizers to raise ticket prices
despite November claims that

they would not do so.
"It we have this additional funding, that would
help us lower the price back to $25 [the same price
as last year]." (JSC member and event planner
Fen Zhao said in the tall."lf we increase the price
to $30. which is something I've talked about, $30
would be enough to cover everything."
When the additional funding was granted, tick
et prices remained at $30. provided they are
bought before Feb. 18. If purchased after that
date, tickets will be $35 each.
According to those organizing the formal, the
event's cost could rise to $54,000 if all the 600

available tickets sell out — as they
did last year and are expected to this
year.
If all 600 tickets are sold, the for
mal will cost $90 per person, far ex
ceeding some of the most expensive
student dances on campus.
The Viennese Ball and the Senior
Formal not only accrue smaller event
costs, but they also attract over twice
as many people, leading to per person
costs that are half that of the graduate
formal. The Sophomore Formal cost
only $10,000. despite drawing over
800 students.
About two-thirds of the total cost
of the graduate formal — approxi
mately $35,000 — will pay for food
and drinks at the party, including a
three-hour open bar. Another
$10,000 is going to pay for the enter
tainment. including a live band that
will perform two shows.
Organizers also said in November
that the rising costs were due, in part,
to the decision to host the formal in
San Jose. But they later changed the
venue, moving it back to the Crowne
Plaza Cabana in Palo Alto, citing long
transportation times to San Jose as
the reason.

I ■ vent organizers now say this
year's formal is costing more because
of more expensive food, an addition
al hour for the open bar and the live
band.
Ihev added that the open bar and
live entertainment make the party
cost more than similar events such as
the Viennese Ball and the undergrad
uate formats, which lack such ameni
ties.
Planners also insist that the final
cost could still change, citing such un
foreseeable expenses as "puke fees"
in case someone vomits on the buses
chartered for the night.
But others who have had experi
ence in planning similar events say
that costs for such occurrences are
easy to project.
"We typically have a very good
sense of how much the dance will
cost." Viennese Ball organizer Jessi
1 lumphreys *()S told The Daily in an
email. "Things like puking on the bus
shouldn't alter the cost — but in fact
we have almost no unknowns. Every
thing is set from the amount of food
to the shuttle system to the bands and
sound."
The graduate formal also stands
out in another way. Where under
graduate formals can usually accom
modate most members of their re
spective classes, the graduate formal
has only 600 tickets available for a
student body of over 8.000.

According to event organizers,23o
tickets had already been sold by Mon
day.
Most of the money for the formal
comes from the student fees paid by
graduate students. Some in the GSC
are concerned that the event is paid
for by the entire graduate student
population, even though relatively
few can attend.
"In the future ticket prices will
have to match the costs." GSC Fund
ing Committee Chair Adam Beberg
told The Daily in an email. "This will
not be an ongoing draw on reserves,
and we've made that clear to every
one."
Those involved with the formal
say the limited number of tickets is
partly due to size constraints.
"Ideally we'd love to have a venue
that would hold <S,()(X) people," said
GSC co-Chair Jenny Allen (also a
senior staff writer for The Daily),
adding that such a venue is impossible
to find.
Organizers defend the intention of
the formal, saying it provides some
thing for graduate students that many
felt was missing.
"They're the reason we're putting
on this event," Allen said. "We're try
ing to make this economical for stu
dents so they can afford it."
