# Grad formal has steep price tag
## Open bar, live entertainment contribute to escalating costs 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I his year's (iraduate Student Formal promis
es to he a one-of-a-kind event — at least in how
much it costs.
Planning lor the event has been marked by ad
hoc funding and several unexpected increases in
costs that have rendered it one of the most expen
sive student-organized dance events at Stanford.
ITie Graduate Student C ouncil (GSC) is plan
ning the event for the second consecutive year.
Last year, the formal cost the GSC only $16,000.
ITie same amount was allocated for this year's for
mal.

But costs quickly started piling
up well past that number.
In late November, the event's
planners asked the GSC for an
additional $10,000. saying they
needed the money for a live band.
The vote to allocate this extra
funding passed unanimously. One
week later, formal planners asked
for another $10,000. this time to
make sure they had enough funds
to sign contracts for the venue
and the entertainment.
"We have to know we have the
money," GSC member and event
planner Donna Winston said at
the time, adding that the money
would be returned to the GSC if it
could be offset by funds from the
Graduate Student Programming
Board (GSPB).
The GSPB contributed the
funds — at the expense of a
spring mixer—but formal or
ganizers are still holding onto the
money from the GSC
Ultimately even the addition
al $20,000. plus the original
$16,000 allocated in the GSC's
budget, was not enough, forcing
organizers to raise ticket prices
despite November claims that

they would not do so.
"It we have this additional funding, that would
help us lower the price back to $25 [the same price
as last year]." (JSC member and event planner
Fen Zhao said in the tall."lf we increase the price
to $30. which is something I've talked about, $30
would be enough to cover everything."
When the additional funding was granted, tick
et prices remained at $30. provided they are
bought before Feb. 18. If purchased after that
date, tickets will be $35 each.
According to those organizing the formal, the
event's cost could rise to $54,000 if all the 600
