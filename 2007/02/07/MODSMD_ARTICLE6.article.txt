# STUDENT GROUPS
## Non-profit start-up seeks recruits 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Student leaders of a nascent non-profit
venture sought to recruit volunteers last
week for a new information service that
would help facilitate the transfer of free med
ication from drug manufacturers to con
sumers.
About 30 students watched a slideshow
created by the architects of "Supporting Ini
tiatives for the Redistribution of Unused
Medicine"(SlÃŸUM) in Building6olast lues

day.
Adam Kircher '07, the group's co-direc
tor, said the meeting was a critical part of the
effort to ensure the venture's long-term suc
cess.
"It's important that we recruit new mem
bers." Kircher said. "[SI RUM | wants to be fi
nancially sustainable and talent sustainable.
'ITiat's why we started this recruitment ef
fort."
SI RUM aims to provide an information
service that pharmaceutical companies and
other large-scale donors of free medication

can use to link up with reputable free clinics.
The organization was founded two years ago
in response to the catastrophic tsunami that
struck Indonesia. Ii is the brainchild of co-di
rectors kircher, Debby Chang "07 and Man
agement Science and Engineering co-termi
nal student Ronald Ho '07.
Ho said that the organization's beta serv
ice will initially be launched in the Bay Area,
but organizers hope it will eventually expand
to serve clinics both nationally and interna
tionally.
"International distribution is the prime

problem," Kircher said. "[And] there isn't a
great solution."' lie added, noting that radio
communication could be used to expand
SI RDM's services in places where the Inter
net is unavailable.
Advised by professional consultants and
professors in the sociology, human biology
and management science and engineering
departments. SI RDM aims to take informa
tion from for-profit industries like technolog
ical consulting firms to streamline the distri
bution of free medication, which Kircher said
was a big problem after the Indonesian
tsunami.
"The supply chain for donations right now
is a wreck." he said. "We saw a need, and we
thought of an idea to fill that need."
SI RDM will stop short of actually stock
piling the medications. The group's leaders
cited numerous regulations that govern the
handling of medicine as the reason for the
more hands off approach.
Naveen Agrawal '() ( ), SI RDM's fund
sourcing officer, said that the venture's lofty
ambitions made recruitment by-application
a necessity.
Most ol the session's attendees remained
afterward to obtain applications and talk to
Kircher. Agrawal and I 10.
Drin Dizon'o9.abiomechanics!engineer
ing major, said she attended the session be
cause it was widely publicized and the
group's goals interested her.
"There is a real need tor [SI Rl JM's servic
es)." she said. "I never realized."
