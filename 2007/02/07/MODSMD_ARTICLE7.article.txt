### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
"Old Union is not being done right."
Those were the words of ASSU Presi
dent I lizabeth I leng "07 during her State
of the Association address last night. 1 leng
spent a large portion of her speech voicing
her dissatisfaction with what she charac
terized as a lack of student input on the
construction currently underway on Old
Union.
"A new student union should have stu
dent input — it makes logical sense."
I leng said."There have been rumors circu
lating that Old Union will open either this
spring or summer.
"While I would love to see this happen.
1 do not want to see Old I Jnion rushed at
the expense of making it sub-par. I would
rather see the timeline pushed to the fall
and done right — with student
input."
Heng plans to work with the
ASSU and the University to ensure
that student input on Old Union's
construction is drawn from a cross
section of campus.
Ileng's address also summarized
her achievements as ASSU Presi
dent and detailed her plans for the
remainder of the year. These plans
ranged from the possible creation ot
a student-run shuttle to-and-from
airports to improving health care for
graduate students.
I leng expressed concern that the

University currently does not pro
vide dependent healthcare to Ph.D.
students.
"Kills need access to doctors,"she
said, adding that the ASSI J will send
members to Washington, DC. to
lobby for the elimination of taxes on
graduate student stipends.
()ther ASSI I projects — some of
which are currently in progress — in
clude a revaluation of the Funda
mental Standard's stance on sexual
harassment and assault, a centralized
plan to expand environmental proj
ects on campus and performance arts
initiatives to promote the Universi
ty's arts scene. Hie ASSI) is also
working to fund a summer program
that would train students to enter the
international non-profit sector.
Before Heng's speech, the Un
dergraduate Senate discussed

changing the procedure to approve
special fees to reflect differences in
the interests of undergraduate and
graduate students.
Currently, a group must earn the
approval of more than 50 percent of
the combined population of under
graduate and graduate students to
be awarded special fees.
However, many graduate stu
dents believe that a group should be
forced to gain separate approval
from over 50 percent of the graduate
and undergraduate populations.
Graduate students believe that
I his change would encourage special
fees groups to be more responsive to
graduate interests than they would
otherwise.
