The Petri Dish
About 8 percent of rams
have the hots for other
rams. Show them the
sexiest ewe in the world, and they'll
still go for the stud next to her. 1 see
this as just another example of the
sexual diversity that typifies the ani
mal kingdom. But for sheep breed
ers, it's a big problem. Breeding rams
are worth up to $500, and no one
wants to drop hank on a gigolo who
won't sleep with women.
That economic consideration was
one reason Charles Roselli began
studying ram sexuality. Roselli, who
works for Oregon Health and Sci
ences University, is trying to under
stand what makes some rams gay
and others straight.
How do you tell if a ram is gay,
anyway? Roselh's behavioral essays
go something like this. One young
ram gets to pick between four mates.
He is free to walk around, while his
potential partners (two rams, two
ewes) are restrained. The ram is al
lowed to sow his wild oats.and the re
searchers observe who he goes for.
Roselli has taken other approach
es to understanding homosexuality
in rams. Most recently, he tried to cre
ate gay rams by depriving male fetus
es of estrogen stimulation. The ex
periment was inconclusive, but the
response to it was anything but.
After a London paper ran a story
about Roselli's work, the blogos
phere churned with indignation.
PETA called the study "an affront to
human dignity and a colossal waste
of precious research funds." Lesbian
tennis star Martina Navratilova
called the experiments "homophobic
and cruel" and demanded that they
end "at once." 1 ler concern is that the
research could be used to try to'cure'
gay adults, or to selectively abort gay
fetuses.
Like Ms. Navratilova, I have a
personal interest in research on ho
mosexuality. But unlike her, I'm not
in favor of halting basic science.
Yes. research on homosexuality
could be used for ignoble purposes.
But the solution to a problem like
homophobia lies in changing society,
not squelching science. We don't get

to stop asking questions just because
we might not like the answers. Why
are some rams gay? 'ITie question has
an answer, and someone will uncov
er it. Scientific progress is inexorable.
The truth is out there, like it or not.
Don't tell PETA, but I also study
gay animals. 1 work in Biology Prof.
Bruce Baker's lab. which studies the
gene responsible for sexual behavior
in fruit flies.This gene was first called
fruity, because one type of mutant
male sexuallv solicits both females

and males. (The name was later
changed to the more PC. fruitless.)
The Baker lab now has a whole li
brary of sexual mutants - everything
from asexual to lesbian to bisexual
fruit flies.
I believe very strongly in the value
of scientific research. But I'm start
ing to feel a bit panicky. Roselli
claims his research is about under
standing. rather than changing, sexu
al behavior. Still, his reassurances
sound hollow. Surely, the better we
understand something, the easier it is
to change it â€” why does so much re
search go into 'understanding' can
cer? Say homosexuality in humans
turns out to be controlled by a cer
tain combination of hormones
bathing a developing fetus. Might
mothers-to-be someday take a pill to
ensure heterosexual offspring?
I'm reminded of cochlear im
plants. These surgically-inserted de
vices can help a deaf child hear -
something that causes the deaf com
munity to fear for its life. Some deaf
parents opt not to implant the device
in their children. "Deafness doesn't
need to be cured," they insist. "It's a
culture, not a disability." Most hear
ing people cannot understand why
anyone would choose deafness for
their child, and criticize any parent

who does.
I see potential parallels in the
queer community. Its continued exis
tence could also be threatened by sci
entific progress. Imagine a future in
which parents of gay children are
chastised for not choosing a gay-pre
vention device for their son or
daughter. 1 picture these parents of
the future weakly insisting that
"being queer is a culture, not a dis
ability..."
My panic subsides when 1 remember

our fruit flies. Even for them, sexual
orientation is not so simple. Young
male flies are bisexual: In the first
hours of their lives, they court both
males and females. These would-be
suitors are forcefully rejected by
their older male targets. Only then
do they switch to exclusively hetero
courtship. And if even humble fruit
flies have a cultural component to
their behavior, imagine how much
more complicated human behavior
must be. But if there is a way to'cure'
human homosexuality, it is certainly
many years away. Maybe by then,
we'll have realized that there's noth
ing to cure.
