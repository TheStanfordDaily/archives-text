skeletons dating back to the late
Neolithic period outside Mantua,
25 miles south of Verona, the city of
Shakespeare's story of doomed
love.
Buried between 5,000 and
6,000 years ago, the prehistoric
pair are believed to have been a
man and a woman and are
thought to have died young, be
cause their teeth were found in
tact. said Elena Menotti, the ar
chaeologist who led the dig.

closely while facing each other on
their sides, were probably buried
at the same time, an indication of
a possible sudden and tragic
death, said Luca Bondioli.an an
thropologist at Rome's National
Prehistoric and Ethnographic
Museum, who was not involved in
the dig.
