New security measures
take effect in chaotic
Baghdad
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -
Baghdad's streets were electric
with tension Wednesday as U.S.
officials confirmed the new secu
rity operation was under way. U.S.
armor rushed through streets, and
Iraqi armored personnel carriers
guarded bridges and major inter
sections.
New coils of barbed-wire and
blast barriers marked check
points that caused traffic bottle
necks. U.S. Apache helicopters
whipped the air over parts of the
capital where they hadn't been
seen before.
But gunfire still rang out
across the city, and some residents
said they doubted life would get
better."Nothing will work,it's too
late," said 1 lashem al-Moussawi.a
resident of the Sadr City Shiite
enclave who was badly wounded
in a bombing in December.
Underlining the dangers, a
U.S. Marine transport helicopter
crashed northwest of Baghdad,
killing all seven on board — the
fifth American aircraft lost in Iraq
in just over two weeks. A military
statement did not give a cause for
the crash, hut a senior U.S. de

fense official in Washington said
the CI l-4(i Sea Knight did not ap
pear to have been hit by hostile
fire. An Iraqi air force officer,
however, said the chopper was
downed by an anti-aircraft mis
sile. An al-Qaida-linked Sunni
group claimed in a Web statement
that it was responsible.
At checkpoints that seemed to
have been thrown up overnight
— some of them blocking half the
lanes of traffic on wide streets —
Iraqi police and army soldiers
searched cars at random. Drivers
and passengers had to get out and
show identity papers.
Adding to the tension. Iraqi
army and police convoys fired
rounds into the air above mo
torists. warning them to make way
for passing forces. The security
troops drove over traffic medians
and into incoming traffic.
Gunfire rang out across the
capital, and the wail of police and
ambulance sirens seemed inces
sant. The buzz of low-flying U.S.
helicopters and growl of fighter
jets was nonstop above a new
crop of government posters and
billboards speaking of Baghdad's
struggle.
"Our streets are deserted
and our blood is fair game." de
clared one that showed an
empty street strewn with debris
from a bombing.
