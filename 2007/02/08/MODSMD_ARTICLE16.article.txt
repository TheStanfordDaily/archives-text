## STUDENT LIFE Tech team to travel to Tokyo Students will compete in international contest 
### 
EMMA TROTTER
A team of three Stanford students
will attend the final round of the In
ternational Collegiate Programming
Contest (IC 'P(') in Tokyo this March,
marking the University's first inter
national appearance at the contest in
three years.
The team won a silver medal at the
contest in 2002 and placed 13th in
2(X)4. Coach Jerry Cain, a lecturer in
the computer science department, is
leading the ICPC team for the fourth
year in a row. He expects another
strong finish this year.
"Stanford always sends strong
teams." he said, "and they always do
well."
I"he annual contest — a collabo
ration between the Association for
Computing Machinery, Baylor Uni
versity and IBM — is a 31-year old
event.
Hie contest consists of a written
exam with 10 problems; participants
have five hours to complete the test
as thoroughly as possible.
"We like for teams to be able to
solve at least one problem," said
Doug Heintzman, a strategy director
for IBM who is the contest's sponsor
ship executive for the fourth consec
utive year. •'Still, there will always be
some that barely anyone on the plan
et can solve. We had one last year that
no one even tried."
The problems are generated by
the same group that judges the con
test a committee that works with
computer science professors from
universities around the world. At
least two committee members must
be able to solve a problem before it is
considered for inclusion in the con
test.
The contest also employs a cre
ative method for announcing which
teams have solved problems.
"It's really quite fun because at
the end of the room there are 10 dif
ferent bunches of balloons of 10 dif
ferent colors, so whenever you solve a
problem, someone brings you a bal
loon of the color corresponding to
that problem," Heintzman said. "It's
exciting because teams are constant
ly reevaluating which problems to at
