A team of three Stanford students
will attend the final round of the In
ternational Collegiate Programming
Contest (IC 'P(') in Tokyo this March,
marking the University's first inter
national appearance at the contest in
three years.
The team won a silver medal at the
contest in 2002 and placed 13th in
2(X)4. Coach Jerry Cain, a lecturer in
the computer science department, is
leading the ICPC team for the fourth
year in a row. He expects another
strong finish this year.
"Stanford always sends strong
teams." he said, "and they always do
well."
I"he annual contest — a collabo
ration between the Association for
Computing Machinery, Baylor Uni
versity and IBM — is a 31-year old
event.
Hie contest consists of a written
exam with 10 problems; participants
have five hours to complete the test
as thoroughly as possible.
"We like for teams to be able to
solve at least one problem," said
Doug Heintzman, a strategy director
for IBM who is the contest's sponsor
ship executive for the fourth consec
utive year. •'Still, there will always be
some that barely anyone on the plan
et can solve. We had one last year that
no one even tried."
The problems are generated by
the same group that judges the con
test a committee that works with
computer science professors from
universities around the world. At
least two committee members must
be able to solve a problem before it is
considered for inclusion in the con
test.
The contest also employs a cre
ative method for announcing which
teams have solved problems.
"It's really quite fun because at
the end of the room there are 10 dif
ferent bunches of balloons of 10 dif
ferent colors, so whenever you solve a
problem, someone brings you a bal
loon of the color corresponding to
that problem," Heintzman said. "It's
exciting because teams are constant
ly reevaluating which problems to at
tempt."
This year's team includes comput
er science coterminal student James
Connor, electrical engineering grad
uate student Alex Utter and Justin
Solomon '10.
Cain was impressed by Solomon's
contribution.
"He wasn't on campus two
months before he carved out a spot
for himself on the team," the coach
said.
Only 88 teams out of 1,756 world
wide were selected for participation
in the final competition, including 20
American teams.
Cain said that Stanford's regional
opponents, which included the Uni
versity of British Columbia, Simon
Fraser University, the University of
Washington and UC-Berkeley, were
particularly strong.
"Stanford isn't the only good
school in the region — in fact, our re
gion is considered to be one of the
most competitive in North Ameri
ca," Cain said. "Five schools are al
ways vying for the top two spots so

they can go to Worlds."
Despite the challenge presented
in the regional round, the Stanford
team expects the final round will be
significantly harder.
"These are the smartest and
brightest students you can imagine."
I leintzman said. "Still. Stanford has
demonstrated the potential to be up
there in the top. We hope for great
things in Tokyo."
Cain said the contest's problems
and the event itself have far-reaching
applications in the modern world.
"Students who participate in
these contests gain a fluency in ad
vanced material and gain the experi
ence needed to solve real problems
in research and industry." he said.
Heintzman said he hoped the
contest would highlight the success
of both the students and the new
technology
"We want to expose the best and
brightest students to state of the art
tools, and many [of them] are offered
internships at IBM." he said. "We
also hope the contest will highlight
the importance of technology and
technology skills in a small and flat
world."
