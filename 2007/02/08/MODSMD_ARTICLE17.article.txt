# EPA violence draws protest
## Discussion will continue today in El Centro Chicano lounge

Nearly I,(XX) community members marched
through the streets of East Palo Alto (EPA) on
Saturday, preaching the message that violence
in the city will no longer be tolerated.
A recent spate of violence— three homi
cides and 15 shootings from Jan. I to Jan. 22 —
has generated widespread concern.
" lliis march was about saying no to vio

lence. and about showing the community
that we are united to expel violence from the
I'PA community." said Marjorie Soto '09. who
attended the march, in an email toThe Daily." It
was really nice for me to get the sense of com
munity and unity, all working towards a noble
cause."
The recent shootings were gang-related, ac
cording to police reports, and most involved
narcotics or retaliatory motives.
The rally was attended by local politicians,
and marchers enjoyed a performance by Stan
ford's Ballet I'olklorico. Participants in the
march were diverse, but the young people in at
tendance were especially vocal, according to
one student.

"Most of the protest rallies I go to consist of
middle-aged, middle-class ex-hippies." said
Christina Guros '09. "On Saturday there were
representatives of all races and demographics."
"More importantly, the young people made
their voices heard," Guros wrote in an email to
The Daily. "It was the most beautiful thing to
see little children holding up signs that said
PEACE:* and to hear high school sophomores
address the crowd about the changes they want
to see in their communities."
Stanford students are mobilizing around
this issue on campus as well, and today a panel
including city council member and vice mayor
Ruben Abrica and Deputy Chief of Police
Kathy Samuels will discuss the recent violence

in East Palo Alto and what Stanford students
can do to end it.
Some students, like Martha Alvarez '08.
have a connection to EPA: Alvarez provides
after-school tutoring services to the city's chil
dren.
"We cannot be indifferent to what is hap
pening to these children since they are our
neighbors, and the only physical barrier is the
bridge that divides us." Alvarez said in an email
to The Daily. "I believe that it is unacceptable
for us to remain within our 'Stanford bubble'
while violent incidents are occurring a few
miles from us."
