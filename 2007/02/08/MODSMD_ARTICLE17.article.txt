# EPA violence draws protest
## Discussion will continue today in El Centro Chicano lounge 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
Nearly I,(XX) community members marched
through the streets of East Palo Alto (EPA) on
Saturday, preaching the message that violence
in the city will no longer be tolerated.
A recent spate of violence— three homi
cides and 15 shootings from Jan. I to Jan. 22 —
has generated widespread concern.
" lliis march was about saying no to vio

lence. and about showing the community
that we are united to expel violence from the
I'PA community." said Marjorie Soto '09. who
attended the march, in an email toThe Daily." It
was really nice for me to get the sense of com
munity and unity, all working towards a noble
cause."
The recent shootings were gang-related, ac
cording to police reports, and most involved
narcotics or retaliatory motives.
The rally was attended by local politicians,
and marchers enjoyed a performance by Stan
ford's Ballet I'olklorico. Participants in the
march were diverse, but the young people in at
tendance were especially vocal, according to
one student.

"Most of the protest rallies I go to consist of
middle-aged, middle-class ex-hippies." said
Christina Guros '09. "On Saturday there were
representatives of all races and demographics."
"More importantly, the young people made
their voices heard," Guros wrote in an email to
The Daily. "It was the most beautiful thing to
see little children holding up signs that said
PEACE:* and to hear high school sophomores
address the crowd about the changes they want
to see in their communities."
Stanford students are mobilizing around
this issue on campus as well, and today a panel
including city council member and vice mayor
Ruben Abrica and Deputy Chief of Police
Kathy Samuels will discuss the recent violence

in East Palo Alto and what Stanford students
can do to end it.
Some students, like Martha Alvarez '08.
have a connection to EPA: Alvarez provides
after-school tutoring services to the city's chil
dren.
"We cannot be indifferent to what is hap
pening to these children since they are our
neighbors, and the only physical barrier is the
bridge that divides us." Alvarez said in an email
to The Daily. "I believe that it is unacceptable
for us to remain within our 'Stanford bubble'
while violent incidents are occurring a few
miles from us."

Fifteen shootings in January prompted a protest in East Palo Alto on Saturday. A number of Stanford students joined other community members in a show of solidarity.
Others, such as Teresa Pina '10.
were driven to action by personal ex
periences.
"I personally come from an urban
environment," Pina said in an email to
The Daily."Back home in Boston, [we
experience] the same issues, so it hits
home considering all the work I've
done at my local Boys and Girls Club,
and I can see how kids get caught up
in — and by — the streets.

Stanford students and resources
should be used to target at-risk youth,
students said.
"I believe that Stanford has the re
sponsibility to address the situation in
EPA." Pina said. "Not through any
paternalistic dictates, but by putting
some of the University's great re
sources toward serving community
needs as determined by the commu
nity. There could be a beautiful rela
tionship between East Palo Alto and
Stanford University. Both communi
ties can learn a lot from each other."
Aton Gutierrez *06 pointed out
that in 1994. the Stanford community
saw violence in EPA as a major prob

lem and went to great lengths to en
sure a University presence in the
town.
"I low can we get Stanford moving
in that direction?" he asked in an
email to The Daily. "It's not going to
happen until programs like the one
happening on Thursday alert students
to the problems "next door.'"
Many students, including Ingrid
Fox '08. hope that events like the
panel discussion will help in popping
the "Stanford bubble."
"Before last Saturday. 1 had only
been [to HPA] for an Ikea run and to
observe an after-school program," she
said. "But I feel that it is important for

us as Stanford students to take an in
terest in EPA, since we live right next
door. I low can we live so close, and yet
in a totally different world? I hope
more people make an effort to break
the bubble and learn more about our
neighboring community"
Today's panel will take place at
noon in the El Centro Chicano
lounge and is co-sponsored by El
Centro Chicano, the Movimiento Es
tudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA), the Black Student Union
(BSU) and the NAACP.
