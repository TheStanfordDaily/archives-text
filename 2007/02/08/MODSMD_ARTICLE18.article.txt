### KAT LEWIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Can you imagine how we'd treat an
Irac|i journalist in America on the eve of
an Iraqi invasion?" performance poet
Jerry Quickley asked a packed audience in
Dinkclspiel Auditorium last night.
Quickley presented his multimedia
program "Live From the Front" as part of
the Stanford Lively Arts series. Me de
scribed his experiences as a reporter in
Iraq during the early days of the American
invasion. Woven into the spoken poetry
monologue were songs, television clips
and sound bytes, as well as actual photo
graphs and documentary footage he took
during his month-long stay in Baghdad.
Hie poet has been active on campus
this week, acting as the judge of a slam po
etry contest held in Roble Mali on Monday
night.
Quickley prefaced his performance
with a slideshow of his own photographs
of Baghdad residents and urban scenery.
I le then discussed his family's and friends'
initial reactions to his decision to live in
Iraq on the verge of American invasion.
"I had to go stand up with the Iraqi peo

ple, broadcast some truth about Bush's
war plan." Quickley said. "The thing is,
when you're sitting across the dinner table
watching your mother's heart break, all
that rhetoric sounds empty. But she under
stood I had to go."
By the time Quickley left for Baghdad,
the Iraqi government was restricting entry
for American reporters, so he became
stranded in Oman while attempting to ob
tain a visa. Eventually, he was allowed into
Iraq — but he was under constant surveil
lance.
Quickley addressed his guilt regarding
being an American in Iraq. The poet said
he felt especially emotional upon visiting
the Amariya bomb shelter, which Ameri
can forces bombed during the Gulf War,
allegedly killing 420 civilian women and
children. The shelter was left essentially
untouched, and Quickley showed footage
of the ruins while describing his response.
"All that misery trapped in the walls
and floors, all that memory cracked in the
concrete, and for me there was a lot of
shame in coming from the country that did
this," he said. "The walls lined with the

burnt faces of women and chil
dren."
Quickley dedicated the last por
tion of the two-hour performance
to discussing his deportation from
Iraq, which took place while the city
was under constant barrage by U.S.
bombers. When his visa expired, he
was ordered to make the 600-kilo
meter drive to the Iraqi border at
night, in spite of the bombing.
" ITie only thing moving on the
street that night was going to be us
and hundreds of U.S. war planes."
he said.
The poet described the drive in
detail — a journey that included
watching a man get killed by a land
mine, avoiding gunfire from AK-47s
and the eventual death of the three
men who drove him to the border.
ITie audience gave Quickley a

standing ovation at the end of his
performance, which was followed
by a question and answer session.
"It's the most important per
formance that I've ever seen," said
Nainia Green '08. "I say important
because he really needs to be telling
the story he tells. It has direct rele
vance to what's happening right
now, although some part of me
wishes I had never ever come."
Jessica Galant '10 said she felt
the show was emotionally provoca
tive.
"It's really compelling and eye
opening to hear such personal testi
mony because so many of us are de
tached from the situation and see
only what's on the news," she said.
"Now I have more understanding of
the actual situation. It makes me feel
very lucky to be where I am. Now I
think I'm going to call my parents
and brother and tell them I love
them."
