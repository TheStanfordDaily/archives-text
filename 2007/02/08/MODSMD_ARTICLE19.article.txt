## ResComp to wait on Vista system 
### JENNIFER LIU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Microsoft released its new Windows Vista
operating system (OS) to the general public last
week, making it the first major Windows over
haul since the 2001

debut of Windows XP.

Available for pur
chase in stores and

online, Windows

Vista boasts secu-

rity improve
ments and a
more user- .
friendly inter-

face than its predecessors —
but Stanford students should not expect to see
the new ()S installed on campus computers, nor
should they count on full technical support from
Residential ( omputing (ResComp) in the near
future.
Aceording to Surajit Mose, who manages
over 80 computer clusters on campus, ResComp
has no plans to immediately upgrade the ap
proximately 350 Windows machines in clusters,
library kiosks and the multimedia studio — a
task that would cost approximately $ 17.5(H).
"The earliest date we anticipate for having
Vista on cluster machines is autumn quarter of
2007," he wrote in an email to The Daily. "For
cluster machines. [Vista s advantages] are out
weighed hv the sheer complexity of trying to roll

out a new OS in the middle of the
school year. We try to keep our clus
ter machines secure already, so the
new security features aren't that
critical for us."
ResComp generally waits until
the summer before incorporating
major OS upgrades into cluster soft
ware in order to allow adequate
time to test the system and academ
ic software, Bose said.
Often. OS upgrades aren't com
patible with Stanford's own systems,
Bose added. ResComp had to wait
nearly nine months before integrat
ing Apple's most recent upgrade,
Mac OS 10.4. into computer clusters
because it lacked a client to support
AFS. the system Stanford uses to
provide network home directories.
Cluster hardware also may pose
a challenge: According to Bose, new
machines don't always boot with an
older OS, which he said "sometimes
forces our hand if we have to replace
cluster hardware."
F van Kutter '08, residential com
puting consultant (RCC) in Muwek
ma. said that RCCs are also not yet
equipped to offer full support for
Vista machines and added that he
was not aware of a timetable for
doing so.
"There hasn't been a huge re

sponse to the Vista release so far,
and I don't expect a lot of students
to upgrade their operating systems
right away," he said. "Vista requires
a pretty powerful machine, so my
personal feeling is that not too many
students on campus are going to be
able to upgrade unless they bought a
top-of-the-line computer in the last
six months."
Instead, he said. ResComp would
probably offer more support in the
fall, when an influx of new comput
ers on campus would bring a higher
percentage of Vista machines.
As is the case with any newly-re
leased OS. Kutter said that Vista
users should be prepared for poten
tial problems. Apple recently
warned Windows iTunes users of in
compatibility issues and has advised
customers to wait for the next re
lease of iTUnes before upgrading to
Vista.
Kutter also recommended that
students currently considering the
upgrade take their own needs into
account.
"If you're used to the latest and
greatest and you have experience
with cutting-edge technology, go for
it — just remember to back up your
data," he said. "If not, I'd wait at
least until Microsoft releases its first
Windows Vista service pack later
this year. Otherwise, it's going to be
an interesting ride."
