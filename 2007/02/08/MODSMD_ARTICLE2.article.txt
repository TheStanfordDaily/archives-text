## GOOD TO GO Goods, Card ready for likely grind against WSU 
### ALEX GYR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Anthony Goods has Washington State's number. In
three career games against the Cougars, the sopho
more guard has twice hit game-winning shots. When
Stanford and then-No. 23 Washington State squared off
at Maples Pavilion less than a month ago. Goods scored
30 points and hit a contested three-pointer in the clos
ing seconds of overtime to give the Cardinal a 71-68
win.
So is Goods looking for game-winner No. 3 against
the No. 14 Cougars when No. 25 Stanford (15-6,7-3 Pa
cific-10 Conference) travels to Pullman tonight?
"Every game is a grind against Washington State,"
Goods said. "It seems like they are all close, no matter
what.This week's game will probably be close too. but
hopefully we won't need a last-second game-winner to
win this one."
It took a career night from Goods to beat Washing
ton State at home in January. Without an individual
performance like that, beating the Cougars at all — let
alone by a comfortable margin — will not be easy.
Washington State (I'M. 8-3 Pac-10) has lost by more
than three points just once this season, and that came
back on Dec. 2 in a 69-55 defeat at Utah. Add to that
one of the best home-court advantages in the confer
ence and taking down the Cougars at Friel Court seems
like a tricky proposition.
"They are really consistent from start to finish,"
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson said. "Kyle Weaver
is really good. Derrick [Low] is really good. You're talk
ing two all-league players there. [Daven] I larmeling --
my goodness, he is special. But it is not like it is a shock.

When you look at their demeanor and their compo
sure, they expect to beat people."
It may not be shocking to see the Cougars win now.
but at the beginning of the season there were far more
skeptics than believers in first-year head coach Tony
Bennett. The Cougars were picked 10th in the Pac-10
media poll by a comfortable margin. Entering this
weekend's action, they are ranked No. 14 in both the
AP and USA Today polls, matching their highest rank
ing ever.
Junior guard Low and junior forward Weaver have
been the difference makers for Washington State this
season. Low, the three-time "Mr. Basketball" for
Hawaii's high schools, leads the team with 15.0 points
per game. Weaver plays a more balanced game, scoring
11.3 points per game and collecting 5.7 rebounds per
game, while dishing out a team-best 114 assists over the
season. Weaver notched the first triple-double in
school history earlier this year against the Cardinal.
I larmeling.too, has stepped up in recent weeks.The
sophomore guard was named Pac-10 Player of the
Week last week after leading the Cougars to a sweep of
the Arizona schools in the desert, lie averaged 14
points over the two games and hit a crucial shot in the
final moments of WSU's 72-66 win at then-No. 20 Ari
zona.
Harmeling keyed the Cougars' late rally when
Washington State visited Maples on Jan. 13. lie hit a
pair of three-pointers on a late 10-1 run as the Cougars
overcame a nine-point deficit to force overtime. The
comeback erased 35 minutes of hard work by Stanford
and set up Goods' heroics.

Sophomore guard Anthony Goods has proven clutch in key situations this season.
While he has two game-winning shots against WSU, he hopes the Cardinal don't find
themselves needing that kind of dire help tonight.
"Watching our game tape against
them here, we were very fortunate."
Johnson said. "Anthony played real
ly well, and we made some crucial
baskets at crucial times. But from the
game tape, you would think we were
on the losing side."
"We know that if we ever get a
nine-point lead with a couple min
utes left, we have to hold it," Goods
said. "They are a tough defensive
team, and we have to take care of the
ball a lot better than last time. We
had a lot of turnovers, and against a
team like Washington State that
doesn't turn the ball over, every pos
session matters. We have to rebound
and control the boards. If we can do
all those things, hopefully we can get
another win."
A road win for the Cardinal
would put the team in great position
in a very tight Pac-10 race. With his
team just one and a half games be
hind first-place UCLA, sophomore
forward Lawrence Hill said every
game takes on added significance.
"We need to go out and win out,"
said Hill, who is sixth in the confer
ence in scoring with 16.6 points per
game." We can't afford to lose.Given
the way we played against every
team, we know we can hang with
them. It's not like our losses like
Oregon and Arizona were blowouts.
We have to win out. Our goal is a
Pac-10 championship."
Winning in Pullman this season
has been a difficult task for anyone
but the Cougars. While Stanford is 6-
2 away from Maples, Washington
State is 10-1 at Friel Court, which has
become one of the most hostile gyms
in the conference.
"It seems like the gyms weren't
this loud last season," Goods said.
"Home and away, it seems like it is
a piercing noise every game. It is
going to be tough to win on the
road. But good teams win games on
the road, so we'll see what we can
do."
But, as always. Hill is confident.
"We have a phrase we use on the
road:'We all we got,'" Hill said. "We
usually say it when the refs give
home-court calls, or the other team
makes a run and the crowd is against
you. We feel comfortable on the road
because it brings us together. We
count on each other more."
The Cardinal downed the
Cougars. 39-37, last season in Pull
man. Wash, on a tip-in by Goods with
3.7 seconds remaining in the game.
Stanford has won four straight
games against WSU.
