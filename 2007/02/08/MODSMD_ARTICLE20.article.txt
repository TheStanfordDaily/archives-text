## Editorial Board End the Stigma on Mental Health 
### 
An unthinkable scourge is gripping a
University known universally for its
picture-perfect weather and perpet
ually happy students. Over the past school
year, several Stanford students have lost
their lives. Suicide — a word unspoken and
seldom heard on campus — has reared its
ugly head.
But why now? And why have we heard
of so many deaths within such a short time
period? Contrary to popular belief, suicide
is not a new phenomenon affecting Stan
ford's students. Two years ago. The Daily
published an article documenting a string of
suicides within a short three-month period.
Officially, the administration has declined
to release the statistics on the number of sui
cides over the past few years, so we can't be
sure of the exact numbers.
Nevertheless, there is still a marked lack
of awareness about mental health on cam
pus. Frankly, mental health is stigmatized at
Stanford. Only the fact that we've had high
profile, apparent suicides has shaken us out
of our complacency.
It's hard to pinpoint who exactly is to
blame for the lack of discussion on mental
health issues. Is the administration not
doing enough to cater to the health and
wellness needs of its students? Are the
available resources on campus, such as the
Bridge Peer Counseling Center and Vaden
Health Center's Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services (CAPS), not effective?
These questions are difficult to answer.
But so is the next assertion. Perhaps, we are
to blame. When was the last time you sat
down at the dinner table with your friends
and had a frank discussion about mental
health? It's an unsaid fact that topics like
depression and suicide are stigmatized on
campus.To admit a problem with your mind
— that great vehicle which got you into
Stanford in the first place — is like admit
ting a personal failure. We learn from an
early age that we should be able to achieve
anything. If we mess up. then it's our own

fault because we should have total control
of our lives, never mind any chemical imbal
ances that come in our way.
Before we can even begin to deal with
the issue of suicide in a clear and open en
vironment, we need to end the stigma of
mental health on campus. We have to real
ize that academic success cannot be equat
ed with happiness and vice versa. Mental
illness does not disproportionately affect
the academically disadvantaged. Plus, it is
extremely hard for students to admit that
they need help and even harder for them
to take advantage of mental health servic
es.
According to the National Institute of
Mental Health, there is no common way to
define mental health, and it can take on var
ious expressions.The World Health Organi
zation describes mental health as a combi
nation of biological, psychological and so
cial factors. Therefore, on campus, mental
illness might manifest itself among us as
weight problems, irritability, insomnia or
even extreme fatigue.
At Stanford, we cultivate an atmosphere
of accomplishment. We aren't afraid to take
20-unit courseloads. We aren't afraid to pull
several all-nighters in a row. We aren't
afraid to spend all our time in meetings. So.
we shouldn't be afraid anymore to talk
about what is really bothering us. We need
to start noticing marked changes in behav
ior and not be afraid to question our friends
on it. We need to be able to say that it's OK
to stop our crazy paddling underwater for a
moment and take a long, hard look at our
legs. It's OK to stop smiling for a bit.
Eiasier said than done — this is true. But,
we need to at least make an effort. Suicide
has profound effects on a college campus.
Ihese are our friends, these are our neigh
bors; it affects us all. If we can get over our
preconceptions and egos,and at least for the
sake of our friends, start talking, who
knows? Maybe in two years, we won't have
to write another article.
