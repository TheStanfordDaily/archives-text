# Avarice and alchemy at pub night
## 
### 
I figured I'd throw my shoe into this whole
pub night discussion before this flu wore
off and I regained my sense of not caring.
Right now everyone seems to believe
there is a new campaign to curtail our liber
ties, for the administration to take an active
role in making us safe as if only now people
are realizing that booze, college-age stu
dents and fearlessness is a bad combination.
They want us to be more responsible. If I
had a magical phone booth. I'd go back in
time and tell them the same damn thing.The
60s and 70s were decades of the utmost irre
sponsibility. and anything we're doing now
pales in comparison to the flower smoking
crap they pulled. Back in the day students
used to have royal rumbles in the quad, and
now parties on Thursdays are at risk? I'm
the fucking ghost of fun past, and you bas
tards just woke me from my slumber. Fee fi
fo fum.
The point of pub night is to go to a pub
and drink and dance.That's why it was orig
inally called pub night. Not Senior Night.
Not Group Hug night. Not magical bus ride
to Chuck E. Cheese. Though. I've tried re
peatedly to get the bus driver to take a de
tour. even going so tar as to promise him
free tickets and a slice of pizza, but I've had
no such luck. Personally, I think if you really
want to take the emphasis off ethanol, driv
ing a bunch of drunken brats to a ball pit
with a giant man in a rat suit will scare kids
straight. Otherwise they just get loaded up
every Thursday and fall back asleep in their
beds made of the fluff of — well, cotton 1
guess. But the metaphorical cotton of igno
rance.
In all fairness, even I. fair reader, indulge
in the past-sunset sojourns to dives filled
with divas. Sometimes you need to get on
the bus to get off the ride, know what I
mean? But the powers that be. the Titanic
Tie-Bearers, won't allow moments of merri
ment to happen on the eve of Iliurs. on cam
pus. See the cancellation of my flaming pina
ta catapult party set for last Thursday.
The OS A was not invited.
Now, though, they won't let you get off
the ride. They don't want the flaming mis
siles of candy-filled cuisine and their wor
shippers on campus, so we pack in our sup
plies, the dozens of unlit pinatas and my
lawyer tells me about two kilos of gasoline
and head onto the bus. On our way home,
the night's merriment over, the Tie-Bear
ers don't want us there either. They'd just
as soon let the Palo Alto Persian rug mon
sters eat us then safely medi-evac us; they
worry about liability of putting drunk peo
ple on buses, but I suppose it's much safer
to let them roam the streets of Palo Alto
late at night. Don't bother with pepper
spray, kiddos — the monsters consider it
an appetizer.

Doc Josh wasn't looking so well. He had
a bit too much of the strawberry kiwi mixed
with laundry detergent and needed to call
the choppers to get us out of the hotzone.
But his card lacked its magical hologram of
passage, and the three-headed dogs were
tossing him to the proverbial Styx. 1 protest
ed, explaining to them Aristotle's view of
human compassion and for some reason,
the lineup of the 1985 Chicago White Sox,
when they stopped me and told me I might
not get outta there either. Josh took me on
the shoulder and led me away from the
snarling dogs, but I vowed revenge. II the
ship was sinking and the lifeboats were
there, these people would still be checking
ID while you became a human ice cube.
Don't let go. Jack...
You know why I go to these things? For
the awkward five minutes before the bus
comes. I cherish these minutes. No one cares
about dancing abilities then, and I'm able to
employ a trustworthy way to engage in con
versation with any woman. It's called the
bus schedule. Yes, I'm gifted with the super
natural ability to remember that the buses
run on loops regularly.Thus, I can make the
clairvoyant comment that "the bus will be
here in 10 minutes." Shortly followed by
"Hi. I'm Chris. I live in a room with some
books, how you doin'?"
Ah. pub night — where "Can I have a
cigarette?" is a pick-up line.
The Tie-Bearers don't want us on the
buses, don't want us in the houses, they don't
want men with Afros or rock and roll. The
swine can push all they want, but one of
these days, that hand grenade is going to ex
plode and leave a stump speech that no one
will listen to. we'll be someplace else and
they'll be penniless and powerless in the
anti-septic hole they created. I won't live to
see that day. But maybe you will.
1 want seniors to be respectful on the
buses and the administration to be re
spectful in their policies. Either has about
as much chance of happening as Cheney
putting on a top-hat and fighting Batman.
And now. back to my cave of allusions and
wonder...

Respectful salutes to Gonzo journalists who
came before me, may their candles he dipped
in napalm. Send complaints to cholt@stan

clairvoyant comment that "the bus will be
here in 10 minutes." Shortly followed by
"Hi. I'm Chris. I live in a room with some
books, how you doin'?"
Ah. pub night — where "Can I have a
cigarette?" is a pick-up line.
The Tie-Bearers don't want us on the
buses, don't want us in the houses, they don't
want men with Afros or rock and roll. The
swine can push all they want, but one of
these days, that hand grenade is going to ex
plode and leave a stump speech that no one
will listen to. we'll be someplace else and
they'll be penniless and powerless in the
anti-septic hole they created. I won't live to
see that day. But maybe you will.
1 want seniors to be respectful on the
buses and the administration to be re
spectful in their policies. Either has about
as much chance of happening as Cheney
putting on a top-hat and fighting Batman.
And now. back to my cave of allusions and
wonder...

Respectful salutes to Gonzo journalists who
came before me, may their candles he dipped
in napalm. Send complaints to cholt@stan
