# When does not having a real job get embarrassing?
## 
### 
There are those that are super-prepared.
Fhe make-you-feel-badders. ITiej go
from Stanford Consulting to Gold
manSachs, from a bio and philosophy double
major straight into Harvard Med. Fhey are
the ones that followed that natural How of
job-getting — they interned at a great tirm
and then Apple swooped down from the Job-
Filled Heavens and carried them off to its
cushy, dog-friendly workplace.They were the
super-dedicated hum bio studiers who
worked in free clinics and shadowed doctors
then had so many fat envelopes stuffing their
little P.O. boxes that annoyed post office
workers stopped trying to kick more med
school acceptance letters into them and just
permanently gave out keys to the big boy
lockers in the back.
I am a make-you-feel-badee. All I get in
my mail box is a warning that my Gl Rs have
yet to be satisfied and weekly I .ively Arts up
dates. (F your I, the dance companies have
been wonderful.) No. I haven't completed
my GFRs. nor have 1 taken the GRFs. al
though I do own a Kaplan get-you prepared
or-your-money-back book. I'd like to think
thousands — no, millions — of others out
there are just like me. As the judicious John
Mayer once sang, we are going through a
"quarter-life crisis." and it takes time to find a
true calling. In fact, my wishy-washy post
grad plans have included becoming a ski pa
trol. hiking the Appalachian Trail and work
ing on organic farms in South America.
I'd like to think, however, that it is gener
ally accepted to take some time oil. do some
traveling, work at a cool (though not real)
job. It is exciting and fun when someone says
he's going to join the Peace Corps, teach art
classes, bartend for a year in New York or
work as a yoga instructor. When a friend
mentions she has plans to work as an au pair
in Berlin or as a ranch hand in Wyoming, you
begin to wish you had a command over two
languages or were living out the "Brokeback
Mountain'" fantasy (minus the tragic ending,
that is.) Why not buy a flight around the
world? Or live with a cool pack of friends in

Frisco?
ITie question is, will it be embarrassing at
my five-year high school reunion when I'll
have an ethnic embroidered bracelet and a
strange pair of leaf earrings to show for my
year abroad? A year abroad coupled with no
concrete plans lying patiently in its wake.
And so I stand there, punch in hand, wonder
ing when it will be embarrassing not to have
a real job. Will it be awkward talking to Rilla
McScrilla in my from-high-school-jeans and
Guatemalan tie-dye while she looks stunning
in Louis Vuitton? Will the med students, the
I-bankers and the consultants make me feel
bad? Perhaps more importantly, will they
feel bad for me?
When do you go from becoming the cool
world traveler to the pitiably unfocused guy
who still has a sort-of funny blog with "Are
you jealous, suckas?" titling his pictures of
exotic locales?
1 have to wonder how long of a grace pe
riod we as 20-somethings actually have be
tween college and the work force. I think,
sadly, that for many there is no wiggle room,
no time for adventures or jobs that don't
build to a bigger and better job. For them, it
is either higher education or a career worthy
of the 4(H) Benjamins your parents shelled
out each year. Clearly, many think a year off
is acceptable, maybe even two. In fact. I'd
like to think that in general the interim
grace period between college and the real
world keeps increasing. In my parents' age.
the linear progression of growing up went
from college to immediately getting
hitched, popping out babies, grooming them
to go to good colleges, and then getting di

vorced. Now, we get much married later,
travel, go to grad school and then get di
vorced.
Wonderfully, the average age of an enter
ing med student is 24 — that means people
are taking their time and taking two years off
before jumping head-long into post-grad
programs (or they arc getting held back in el
ementary school, either one). For all the
Doogie Howsers, there is also Pa McGraw.

From the man who brought us "Strictly
Ballroom" and "Moulin Rouge," Aussie Baz
Luhrmann also gave us the 1999 radio sensa
tion the "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sun

tionally. not to "feel guilty if you don't know
what you w;mt to do with your life.The most
interesting people 1 know didn't know at 22
what they wanted to do with their lives. Some
of the most interesting 40 year olds I know
still don't."
So there you have it. folks, from an incon
trovertible source. From a summer to almost
two decades, clearly there are no right an
swers to what you should be doing after col
lege.The world is our oyster, and let's enjoy it
while we can. All I know is that you won't
find me embarrassed as I am picking bananas
in Costa Rica. Or maybe teaching on the
slopes of Tahoe....Or maybe hiking the

sadly, that for many there is no wiggle room,
no time for adventures or jobs that don't
build to a bigger and better job. For them, it
is either higher education or a career worthy
of the 4(H) Benjamins your parents shelled
out each year. Clearly, many think a year off
is acceptable, maybe even two. In fact. I'd
like to think that in general the interim
grace period between college and the real

the linear progression of growing up went
from college to immediately getting
hitched, popping out babies, grooming them

two decades, clearly there are no right an

while we can. All I know is that you won't
find me embarrassed as I am picking bananas
