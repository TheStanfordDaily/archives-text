LOS ANGELES —In his $2»
trillion proposed budget for the 2008
fiscal year which is aimed at slowly
eliminating the nation's deficit. Pres
ident Bush included the largest in
crease to the Pell Grants in 30 years.
But in a budget which also includ
ed $145 billion for the war in Iraq in
2008 and cuts to spending on
Medicare and Medicaid, Bush did
not specify how he would fund the
Pell Grant increase, which would
cost $2 billion.
According to a statement from
Secretary of Education Margaret
Spellings, the maximum amount
awarded in a Pell Grant would be in
creased from $4,050 to $4,600 in
2008. and there would be a 33 per
cent increase in awards over the next
five years.
ITie total award would increase
from $1,350 to $5.4(X). the largest five
year increase in the history of the Pell
Grant, Spellings said in the statement.
Pell Grants, originally part of the
Basic Educational Opportunity

Grant, are awarded to low-income
students who have difficulty afford
ing college, said Chris Lindstrom,
higher education program director
of U.S. Public Interest Research
Group.
"From a federal perspective it is
an absolutely important step to help
college remain affordable and acces
sible and for students in mid- and
low-income families," Lindstrom
said.
Pell Grants are a large portion of
federal higher education funding and
are grants that do not have to be re
paid.
But since their creation in 1972.
Pell Grants have steadily decreased
in purchasing power since grant
moneys have not increased as steadi
ly as tuition costs. Lindstrom said.
As a result, the grants that once
covered up to 80 percent of college
costs now only make up roughly 35
percent of student costs.
ITie proposed increases in the
maximum awards for Pell Grants
would take strides in making college
more affordable for students, espe
cially California students, said Bill

Schiebler, president of the Universi
ty of California Students Associa
tion. "Over 65,(XX) students in Cali
fornia receive Pell Grants. Our stu
dents benefit more than any stu
dents in the country," he said.
But while some student leaders
say they support the increase in fed
eral funds for the Pell Grants, others
are concerned about existing specu
lation that the increases will he
funded by cutting other existing fed
eral aid programs. But because Bush
has not announced how he plans to
foot the $2 billion increase, there is
some speculation that the money
may come as a result of cutting other
existing federal programs for higher
education.
"The concern is that raising the Pell
is meaningless it it cuts other federal
aid programs." l.indstrom said.
In addition to possible cuts to fed
eral funds allocated for higher edu
cation assistance. Schiebler said he
worries that cuts in federal programs
could lead to cuts in state funds.
"We support increasing Pell
Grants," he said, "but at what
cost?"
