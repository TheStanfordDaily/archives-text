## Team aims to bounce back today 
### JACK SALISBURY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cardinal women's tennis looks to rebound from
its shocking loss to Georgia Tech last Saturday
when the team faces Sacramento State this after
noon at theTaube Family Tennis Center.
Although Sacramento State isn't necessarily a
tough opponent along the likes of No. 15 UCLA or
No. 5 Southern California, the match is still of para
mount importance to No. 2 Stanford (3-1). a team

recovering from its first loss in more than three
years.
Assistant coach Frankie Brennan said this
seemingly "warm-up" match has greater impor
tance than that to the season.
"Every match has a purpose, whether the pur
pose is just to scrap and win against a really good
team or whether it's to build confidence," Brennan
said.
Although the match against Sacramento State
will serve as a warm-up for Pacific-10 Conference

rivals UCLA and USC next week, it shouldn't he a
complete Cakewalk for the Cardinal.
A testament to 1 iornet coach and Belarus na
tive Dima I Irynashka,Sacramento State has boast
ed a wealth of strong Russian players over the
years. Where the Hornets excel in quality, though,
they lack in quantity.
"[Hrynashka] always seems to have a pretty
good one or two [players] there w ho can compete
with the better players" Brennan said. "They just
lack the depth."
Freshman Lindsay Burdette agreed that Sacra
mento will have difficulty against the much deeper
Stanford.
"I'd say their top players are going to be tough,
and that it might drop off towards the end of the
line up." she said.
Still.Sacramento State has captured champi
onships in the Western Athletic Conference
(WAC) in recent years, so they likely will not be a
complete pushover.

More than anything, the match should be a good
opportunity for Stanford to get ready for their cru
cial matches against the Southern California teams.
"1 know they have a couple good players, so
that'll be good in terms of getting more matches"
senior Anne Yelsev said."l think the match will be
a good warm-up for the LAs."
Brennan also spoke about the importance of the
team's match against the Hornets, and said that
today's match will be about rebounding from the
Georgia Tech loss.
"For the first time in the past three years we can
say that our last match was a loss." Brennan contin
ued. "We haven't been able to say that in a while. I
think this is a huge test of this team's character."
Burdette added that today's match would help
the Cardinal gain momentum as it heads into Los
Angeles.
"It's definitely going to be an important confi
dence booster." Burdette said.
Tliis particular match is of such importance to
the team that head coach Lele Forood already
plans to reschedule the match for Friday if it rains
today The last time that Stanford had a match
rained out (against Fresno State), the match was
not rescheduled.
The lineup may see a few subtle changes this af
ternoon. Junior Lejla I lodzic.whohas played in the
number six spot for the Cardinal, is currently sick,
and Burdette could make her singles debut in a
dual match.
In any case, today's event will go a long way in
preparing Stanford for the huge matches against
the Los Angeles schools. With a businesslike ap
proach, Yelsey summed up the team's current atti
tude.
"We're going to work really hard this week and
next week," she said. 'We're going to be ready."
