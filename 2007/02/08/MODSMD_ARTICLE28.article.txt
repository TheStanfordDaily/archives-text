ship to Lind Violence Against Women
which received a $200,(XX) grant
trom the U.S. Department of Justice
last fall — has been working closely
with the non-profit Center for Rela
tionship Abuse Awareness to offer a
three-unit pilot course entitled "Vio
lence Against Women," as well as su
pervising and training seven interns.
Director and Founder Nicole
Baran (K) and Donnovan Yisrael '89.
the health empowerment educator
at Vaden Health Center, teach the
pilot course, which will also be of
fered during the spring quarter. The
class is open to both interns and in
terested students.
"We are very excited about the
energy and enthusiasm of the stu
dent interns and their commitment
to ending violence against women on
campus," Baran said.

After completing the course, stu
dent interns will conduct focus
groups in conjunction with commu
nity centers and other key areas of
student life.
The partnership aims to create al
liances and affiliations between men
and women, different races and the
undergraduate and graduate com
munities in order to work toward the
common goal of ending violence
against women and violence in rela
tionships.
Stanford, along with many other
colleges and universities, is also host
to the Men Against Violence pro
gram. Interns are learning how to in
corporate and engage the entire
Stanford community to end relation
ship abuse and sexual violence.
' Recognizing that relationship
abuse and sexual violence does not
discriminate [is important]," Baran
said. "Students are responding to the
diverse student body by choosing a
population focus, researching the
needs of that particular group, and
then implementing projects campus
wide."
Carole Pertofsky and Laurette

Beeson, co-chairs of the Sexual Vio
lence Advisory Board (SVAB) —a
part of the Community Partnership
— said the YWCA Sexual Assault
Center at Stanford now maintains a
24/7 hotline that links to the YWCA
Rape Crisis Center.
In addition to the SVAB. the
Community Partnership also con
sists of Vaden Health Center, the
Dean of Students Office. Public Safe
ty, Student Affairs, Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) and
Health Promotion Services.
"The presence of this grant, in and
of itself, sends a message to students
and staff that violence against
women will not be tolerated and that
there are available resources to help
friends who experience violence in
isolation." said Baran. "The grant has
formalized the collaborations that
have been established by all of the
participating entities on campus in
order to provide a coordinated com
munity response to relationship
abuse and sexual violence."
