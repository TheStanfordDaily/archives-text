### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A joint resolution that calls on the University to
place stricter controls on apparel manufacturing was
introduced at the Graduate Student Council (GSC)
meeting last night.
The proposal, which the GSC will vote on next
week, was passed by the Undergraduate Senate on
Tuesday. Members of the Stanford Asian American
Activism Committee (SAAAC). who introduced the
hill last night,said that its goal is to encourage the Uni
versity to make sure it is not using sweatshop labor in
producing Stanford apparel.
"We have to make sure we're not part of the prob
lem. but that we're part of the solution," said Daniel
Shih 09. one of the SAAAC members present last
night.
SAAAC members said they have a meeting sched
uled with President John Hennessy next week at
which they will address these concerns; they noted
that they would like to have a "show of support" be

fore then.
The GSC also hammered out details for New
Graduate Student Orientation, which it says will be
the graduate equivalent of New Student Orientation.
"Its [purpose is] to get graduate students connect
ed more with the University as a whole and not just
with their departments," GSC co-Chair Jenny Allen
J.D. "07 said. [Allen is a Senior Staff Writer at The
Daily.]
The GSC got a sneak peek at its new Web site,
which is expected to be made public soon. Touted to
be "more user-centric" than the current version, one
of the key changes will allow individual GSC mem
bers to add or change content themselves, making up
dates easier and less dependent on the Webmaster, ac
cording to current Webmaster Matt Turk, a graduate
student in physics.
Just before concluding the meeting, the GSC briefly
discussed an article on the graduate formal that ran in
yesterday's issue ofThe Daily ("Grad formal has steep
price tag"). While some members admitted that they
had not yet read the story, others said they were not
very concerned about rising costs of the event.
"I'm hoping what it will do is get people really ex
cited about going." said GSC co-Chair Paul Gurney.a
graduate student in electrical engineering."lt's OK to
spend some money to have some buzz."
