### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
F resh off a disturbing loss to Berkeley andwith
only six games to go in the regular season, the No. 11
Stanford women's basketball team will take on
Washington State and Washington at Maples Pavil
ion before the week's end.
Last Sunday, No. 20 California disrupted the Car
dinal's 17-game win streak, handing Stanford its first
conference loss. The Cardinal (19-4, 11-1 Pacific-10
Conference) hopes to begin a new string of victories
tonight with a strong home appearance against the
Cougars (5-18.1-12 Pac-10).
The numbers are in the Card's favor, as Stanford
owns a 43-0 all-time series record, and Washington
State has not won any of its past 12 outings. But the
( ardinal will make the most of the match-up. incor
porating lessons from the Cal defeat into its game
strategy. Freshman guard Melanie Murphy acknowl
edged the importance of this,given the similarities in
the Golden Bears' and Cougars' styles of play.
"Washington State will probably play sagging in.
just like C;il did. so it'll be good to see how we recov
er and make that transition," Murphy said, "It
should just be a good challenge for the team over
all."
Hie challenge, however, could extend beyond
merely improving upon past mistakes. Washington
State has suffered seven of its 12 conference defeats
with a margin of 10 points or fewer. In a Jan. 13 game,
the Cardinal fit this trend, winning by only eight
points Freshman guard JJ Hones then led Stanford
in scoi ing with 17 points, and senior forward Brooke
Smith had a near triple-double.
Such an arrangement is impossible this time
around, as 1 lones went down less than a minute into
the Cal meeting and tore her ACL. The Cardinal
must maintain its composure if it is to have a success
ful weekend. Murphy, though, is optimistic, noting
