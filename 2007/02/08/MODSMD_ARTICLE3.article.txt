## Women attempt to rebound from snapped 17-game win streak 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
F resh off a disturbing loss to Berkeley andwith
only six games to go in the regular season, the No. 11
Stanford women's basketball team will take on
Washington State and Washington at Maples Pavil
ion before the week's end.
Last Sunday, No. 20 California disrupted the Car
dinal's 17-game win streak, handing Stanford its first
conference loss. The Cardinal (19-4, 11-1 Pacific-10
Conference) hopes to begin a new string of victories
tonight with a strong home appearance against the
Cougars (5-18.1-12 Pac-10).
The numbers are in the Card's favor, as Stanford
owns a 43-0 all-time series record, and Washington
State has not won any of its past 12 outings. But the

strategy. Freshman guard Melanie Murphy acknowl
edged the importance of this,given the similarities in
the Golden Bears' and Cougars' styles of play.
"Washington State will probably play sagging in.
just like C;il did. so it'll be good to see how we recov
er and make that transition," Murphy said, "It
should just be a good challenge for the team over
all."
Hie challenge, however, could extend beyond
merely improving upon past mistakes. Washington
State has suffered seven of its 12 conference defeats
with a margin of 10 points or fewer. In a Jan. 13 game,
the Cardinal fit this trend, winning by only eight
points Freshman guard JJ Hones then led Stanford
in scoi ing with 17 points, and senior forward Brooke
Smith had a near triple-double.
Such an arrangement is impossible this time
around, as 1 lones went down less than a minute into
the Cal meeting and tore her ACL. The Cardinal
must maintain its composure if it is to have a success
ful weekend. Murphy, though, is optimistic, noting

Senior guard Clare Bodensteiner has shot 50 percent from the field in seven career
games against Washington State. She also has seven three-pointers total when play
ing the Cougars.
the offensive balance found
throughout the season.
"[What happened to Hones] is
very unfortunate," Murphy said.
"The whole team is upset about it,
but at the same time, more people
are going to get the opportunity to
show what they can do."
The biggest Cougar threat is
freshman forward Marisa Stotler,
who averages 10.9 points and 5.4 re
bounds per game. Senior forward
Kate Benz, who is only 20 boards
short of becoming Washington
State's all-time leading rebounder,
also poses a menace. But junior
guard Cissy Pierce voiced the team's
confidence in its ability to dominate
inside with the deep rotation of
Smith, senior center Kristen Newlin,
sophomore forward Jillian Harmon
and freshman center Jayne Appel.
"Our team goal this week is to
get the ball into the post," Pierce
said. "Hopefully, we'll fill in the void
of assists. [Hones had 90 assists on
the season.] But if we get the ball
into the posts, it's pretty much an
automatic two."
Saturday's 1 p.m. match up
should prove more difficult for
Stanford, particularly for its guards.
ITie Huskies (14-10,7-6 Pac-10) are
led by one of the Pac-10's top point
guards: Cameo Hicks. As the con
ference's third-leading scorer (17.6
points per game),she will be a tough
offensive force to guard for whoev
er is playing the point.
In Hones' absence, the team will
rely even more on a collection of
backcourt players, including Pierce
and Murphy, to bring the necessary
defensive pressure and to continue
protecting the ball. The team feels
that it is ready for that challenge.
"[Head coach Tara VanDerveer]
has been saying everyday after
practice that we can't change [what
happened to Hones]," Pierce said.
"Its something that we have no
control ovei, so we should just push
on and move on.
"()ur goal is just to come out and
blast Washington State," Pierce con
tinued. "We didn't play well up
there, so we just want to come out
this weekend and prove that we're
still a great team, and although it
hurt us to lose our starting point
guard, we can still win."
