# TOP FIVE TO WATCH
## 
### 
1. Working Without Hones
With starting point guard JJ Hones out for the season
with a torn ACL, Stanford will need to transition quickly,
looking to Cissy Pierce, Melanie Murphy, Markisha Cole
man and Clare Bodensteiner to help Candice Wiggins
lead the offense.
2. Candice s Continuation
Back to her old self after struggling with an injury earlier in
the season, Wiggins has led the Cardinal in scoring in the
last three outings. Should she maintain this high level of
production, Stanford will be that much closer to clinching
the Pac-10 title.
3. Battle in the Backcourt
Washington's Cameo Hicks is third in the Pac-10 in scor
ing, averaging 1 7.6 points per game. In the Huskies'
games against Arizona and Arizona State, she shot 56.7
percent and extended her streak to 19 games with 10 or
more points.
4. Power in the Paint
Since the Stanford forwards are unlikely to meet other
dominant forces against whom they must compete, the
Cardinal will try to go inside to the likes of Brooke Smith and
Jayne Appel as their primary offensive players. In the last
meeting with WSU, Smith nearly completed a triple-dou
ble. Similarly, Appel led the team in scoring with 19 points
when Stanford traveled to play Washington.
5. Maintaining Momentum
Aside from requiring new individuals to step up, the loss of
Hones throws a wrench in Stanford's momentum, especial
ly when compounded by a tough loss to Cal at home. The
Cardinal will look to the leadership of Wiggins and Smith
to help the team maintain composure.
