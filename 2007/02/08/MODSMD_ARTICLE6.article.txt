# A 						Strong Case
## Mens defensive numbers tell solid story 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the old adage goes, there are
three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies
and statistics.
But No. 25 Stanford's recent de
fensive surge isn't just showing up on
paper: it's making a difference on the
court.
The Cardinal enters this week
end's road swing through the Wash
ington schools as an elite defensive
team in the Pacific-10 Conference.
Stanford leads the conference in re
bounding and blocks (averaging
39.4 and 7.7 per game, respectively),
and is third in field-goal defense,
holding opponents to 40.7 percent
from the field.
I lead coach Trent Johnson attrib
utes the Cardinal's success in stop
ping opponents to a balanced, team
oriented approach.
"This is a team that's becoming
more and more complete," Johnson
said after Stanford's 90-71 win over
California on Saturday. "We need all
our parts to compete against any
one."
Having two seven-footers —
freshmen twins Brook and Robin
Lopez — on the court at the same
time doesn't hurt either. The Cardi
nal is 7-1 since moving Brook Lopez
into the starting lineup on Jan. 7 in
the win at Virginia. Since then, the
Cardinal has been on a defensive
tear — and opponents are taking
notice.
"They're just a strong, dominant
force down low," Cal forward Ryan
Anderson said after being held to 11
points on 4-for-ll shooting against
the Lopez twins."They just play real
ly well together."
But Johnson does not simply rely
on his squad's size on the defensive
end. He's quick to employ a more
traditional lineup, with 6-foot-8 jun
ior forward Taj Finger or 6-foot-8
sophomore Lawrence Hill at the
power forward position against
smaller, more perimeter-oriented
teams.
"They've got to match up defen

sively," Johnson said of keeping both
Lopez twins on the floor together.
ITiis weekend, the Cardinal takes
on two very different teams with op
posite defensive philosophies.
Tonight's game against Washington
State will likely be a low scoring,
grind-it-out affair, as the Cougars
give up a meager 59.7 points per
game. Washington, which Stanford
will face on Sunday, instead prefers a
run-and-gun approach, allowing a
league-high 77.9 points per game.
The Cardinal's 39-37 win in Pull
man, Wash, last season was the
team's lowest score in a victory since
the 1946-47 season, and Stanford's
fewest points in any game since 19«S 1 -
82. The teams' combined total of 76
points was also a conference-low in
the shot-clock era.
In last month's home series
against the Washington schools, the
Cardinal's defensive prowess was on
lull display, with the Lopez twins
once again leading the charge. The
pair combined for 10 of Stanford's 13
blocks in the two games, teaming up
to hold heralded Huskies freshman
Spencer 1 lawes to six points on 3-of
-12 shooting.
Individually, the two are among
the best interior defenders in the
conference and are tied for second in
the Pac-10 with a 2.6 blocks per game
average. Robin Lopez's 54 blocks on
the year already ranks second for a
single season in Stanford history.
"They're big guys," Anderson
said. "That's going to be a struggle
for a lot of undersized teams like\is."
For their part, the twins humbly
defer much of the Cardinal's success
to the team as a whole
"We just come out and go to
work." Brook Lopez said, adding
that the team continues to get "bet
ter by the day."
And while the majority of the at
tention has focused on the fresh
man twins, senior guard/forward
Fred Washington has been quietly
shutting down opponents on the
perimeter. His offensive explosion
at Cal — a season-high 21 points
and career-hiuh eight rebounds —

largely overshadowed a remark
able performance from the Golden
Bears' Ayinde Übaka at the other
end of the court.
Übaka torched Stanford for 26
points in Cal's 67-63 victory on Jan 3.
But last weekend, Washington and
sophomore guard Anthony Goods
teamed up to hold the Cal guard to
two points in the first half. Übaka ul
timately labored up 15 points in the
second period — much of it after the
game was already out of reach for
the Bears — and finished with 17

points.
Washington, who contributed
equally impressive performances
guarding UCLA's Aaron Afflalo and
Gonzaga's Derek Raiviol last
month, said the Cardinal's defensive
strength came as no surprise.
"I always thought we had the po
tential to he a good defensive team."
Washington said. "We just had to do
it."

Senior forward Fred Washington has been keeping his opponents quiet along
the perimeter. Washington has faced the tough tasks of guarding UCLA's
Aaron Aflalo, Gonzaga's Derek Raiviol and Cal's Ayinde Übaka this season.
