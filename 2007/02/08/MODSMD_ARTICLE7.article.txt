# TOP FIVE TO WATCH
## 
### 
1. Handle Harmeling
Washington State guard Daven
Harmeling hasn't been the
Cougars' highest scorer, but no one
has hit more big shots for the up
start Cougars than him. Harmeling
was named Pac-10 Player of the
Week after leading his team to a
pair of wins over the Arizona
schools on the road.
2. Hill Topper
Sophomore forward Lawrence Hill has
hit double-digit scoring totals in his last
13 games. He has been especially
strong in recent weeks. In his last three
games, Hill averaged 22.0 points per
game and shot 66.1 percent from the
field.
3. So Good
Sophomore guard Anthony Goods
has hit two game-winning shots
against Washington State. Last season
in Pullman, Wash., Goods scored on a
tip-in with 3.7 seconds left to give the
Cardinal a 39-37 victory. This season,
his three-pointer in the final seconds of
overtime on Jan. 13 helped Stanford to
a 71-68 win.
4. Breaking Down
the Rankings
Washington State enters this week
end's action at No. 14 in the AP Poll.
The ranking matches the best in school
history. The last time the Cougars
achieved this rank was in 1949.
5. One-sided Rivalry
The Cardinal has won the last four
games over Washington State, but that
doesn't even begin to describe Stan
ford's dominance in the rivalry's recent
history. The Card has won 21 of the last
23 games between the two teams.
