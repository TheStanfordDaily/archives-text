# Card could be better
## Wishing the starting five could play longer 
### 
The tendency for Stanford
men's basketball to blow leads
has been driving me nuts. It
hasn't cost Stanford too much thus
far. but it the team doesn't shape up
come March, it's going to be a long
off-season.
Game after game, the starting five
have built a huge lead in the first few

minutes of the game, only for the op
ponents to come charging back as
soon as head coach Trent Johnson
substitutes.
The Card led 11-2 against Oregon
State, hut the Beavers then scored
the next seven points and built a five
point halftime lead. In two nearly
identical first 15 minutes on Wednes
day and Saturday, Stanford led l c )-5
against Gonzaga and 20-4 against
California, only for the Zags to close
in and the Bears to tighten to
24-20.

The most obvious explanation is
that the team lacks a killer instinct.
Add in Stanford's collapse after an
eight-point second-half lead at Ore
gon. Washington State overcoming a
nine-point last-minute deficit to
force overtime, and watching USC'
go on a 10-0 run to turn a 51-31 rout
into a 51-41 game, and Stanford has
blown substantial leads in six of its

last seven games.
And the one game where Stan
ford didn't slow down? It was
against Pac-10 frontrunner UCLA,
the one game you would expect
Stanford to give 100 percent effort
for 40 minutes.
Fortunately for the Card, its killer
instinct should improve as the team
matures and the stakes grow higher
— as the UCLA game suggests. For
the biggest of games, focus shouldn't
he a problem.
But what if it's all a matter of
depth?
Longtime Stanford photographer
and fan Steve Durrett keeps excel
lent plus-minus statistics (see for

yourself: http://durrettphoto.com/ht
docs/stats/2lmaster.htm) that show
how many points Stanford has
scored and allowed with any given
player on the floor. These numbers
confirm what the fans have been ob
serving for an entire season.
Since the start of Pac-1() play,
the team is at its best offensively
when Anthony Goods, Lawrence
Hill or Fred Washington are in the
game. Stanford averages about 75
points per 40 minutes of playing
time for each of the three starting
wings.

Analysis
Defensively, Brook and Robin
Lopez are tops; Stanford allows
about 65 points per 40 minutes of
play from either of them.
The most important statistic of
all. though, is this: From Fred Wash
ington's 75-68 differential per 40
minutes to Robin Lopez's 70-66
edge, Stanford has outscored its op
ponents when each of its starters are
on the floor.
For any bench player, meanwhile,
the exact opposite is true. From
Mitch Johnson and Taj Finger's 68-
70 and 68-72 (disappointing for play
ers noted for their defense) on
down, opponents have outscored
Stanford when any bench player is in
the game.
The contrast is dramatic. Sure, the
starting five are better than the
bench — that's why they're the
starters. But for every starter to be
positive and every sub to be nega
tive? 1 don't know if that's true of
any other team in the country.
Again, the numbers confirm our
eyesight: This team has no real

depth.
Remember all those 20-5 starts
the past few weeks? Those were built
on the backs of the starting five.The
subs then start to come in. the oppo
nent all but ties the game, and Stan
ford finds itself in a second-half
slugfest.
Coaches are always scapegoats,
and Trent Johnson has been no ex
ception in my corner of Sixth Man.
And while Johnson has made
wrong in-game decisions through
out his tenure at Stanford, his hands
are tied here. 1 le can't play Anthony
Goods, Brook Lopez and company
for 40 minutes, two times per week,
every week.
1 le has to keep feeding significant
minutes to Mitch Johnson. Landry
Fields. Taj Finger and, now. Peter
Prowitt, and they keep losing leads.
How well those four bounce back
will decide a lot of games these next
few weeks.
1 lopefully, the bench will shorten
come NCAA tournament time. And
if the top live are getting 35-plus
minutes a game, they might surprise
the country with how good they ac
tually are.
