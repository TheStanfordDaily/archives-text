# Card could be better
## Wishing the starting five could play longer 
### 
The tendency for Stanford
men's basketball to blow leads
has been driving me nuts. It
hasn't cost Stanford too much thus
far. but it the team doesn't shape up
come March, it's going to be a long
off-season.
Game after game, the starting five
have built a huge lead in the first few

minutes of the game, only for the op
ponents to come charging back as
soon as head coach Trent Johnson
substitutes.
The Card led 11-2 against Oregon
State, hut the Beavers then scored
the next seven points and built a five
point halftime lead. In two nearly
identical first 15 minutes on Wednes
day and Saturday, Stanford led l c )-5
against Gonzaga and 20-4 against
California, only for the Zags to close
in and the Bears to tighten to
24-20.

The most obvious explanation is
that the team lacks a killer instinct.
Add in Stanford's collapse after an
eight-point second-half lead at Ore
gon. Washington State overcoming a
nine-point last-minute deficit to
force overtime, and watching USC'
go on a 10-0 run to turn a 51-31 rout
into a 51-41 game, and Stanford has
blown substantial leads in six of its

last seven games.
And the one game where Stan
ford didn't slow down? It was
against Pac-10 frontrunner UCLA,
the one game you would expect
Stanford to give 100 percent effort
for 40 minutes.
Fortunately for the Card, its killer
instinct should improve as the team
matures and the stakes grow higher
â€” as the UCLA game suggests. For
the biggest of games, focus shouldn't
he a problem.
But what if it's all a matter of
depth?
Longtime Stanford photographer
and fan Steve Durrett keeps excel
lent plus-minus statistics (see for

yourself: http://durrettphoto.com/ht
docs/stats/2lmaster.htm) that show
how many points Stanford has
scored and allowed with any given
player on the floor. These numbers
confirm what the fans have been ob
serving for an entire season.
Since the start of Pac-1() play,
the team is at its best offensively
when Anthony Goods, Lawrence
Hill or Fred Washington are in the
game. Stanford averages about 75
points per 40 minutes of playing
time for each of the three starting
wings.
