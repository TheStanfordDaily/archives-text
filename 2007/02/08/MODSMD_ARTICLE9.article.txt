# New Starting Point
## Women's basketball has many choices in finding new point guard 
### SCOTT BLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the second time in eight
months, the Stanford women's basket
ball team needs a new starting point
guard.
ITiings were looking dicey enough
before the season when sophomore
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude tore an anteri
or cruciate ligament (ACL) in her knee
at the U.S. U-20 team trials in May. In
coming freshman JJ Hones was there
to step in. and she did an admirable job
for the Cardinal, posting a league-best
assist-to-turnover ratio and playing al
most 25 minutes each game in her first
year.
Hut now another injury has robbed
No. 11 Stanford (19-4, 11-1 Pacific-10
Conference) of Hones' services for
the remainder of this season. Just 45
seconds into the game with California
last Sunday, the point guard's left
knee buckled horrifically while she
was driving down the lane. It was con
firmed to be an ACL tear on Monday
night.
"It's a very big loss for our team,"
head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"She's been playing very well. She does
the things we need at that position."
The 72-57 loss against the Golden
Bears is likely not an indicator of a
Cardinal season on the verge of unrav
eling. VanDerveer felt that the team
was struggling to focus on the game
after watching a teammate go down

early.
"Ilie kids were really upset." Van-
Derveer said. "A side of you wants to
say. Put it behind you.' but it's good
that they care about each other."
Now. VanDerveer needs to figure
out how to keep last Sunday's emo
tional problem from quickly degener
ating into a tactical one. The Pac-10
schedule continues this weekend
against Washington and Washington
State, and the postseason is less than a
month away.
Ihe options are almost as deep as
Stanford's bench. Junior Candice
Wiggins could move to the point to
make room for either junior Cissy
Pierce or senior Clare Bodensteiner
at shooting guard. If Wiggins' contri
bution from the off-guard position is
deemed to be too valuable, freshman
guard Melanie Murphy or senior
guard Markisha Coleman would step
in as a direct replacement for Hones
at the point.
There is a smaller chance that soph
omore forward Jillian Harmon or
freshman forward Michelle Harrison
could get rotated into the backcourt
and that Stanford will go with a big
lineup at times.
Ihe biggest question remaining,
though, is: Which one of those players
can best replace Hones' intangibles
and basketball smarts?
"[Hones] was very much a glue."
VanDerveer said. "She kept people to
gether. and she did a really good job

running our team."
Pierce seems to be in prime position
to fill space in the starting lineup,given
her experience and improved scoring
this season. She has already started
nine games, including each game in
which either I lones or Wiggins did not
start. Pierce also has some experience
playing point from last season.
To keep the backcourt productive,
bench play and rotation will be even
more important in the coming months.
When Wiggins is handling the point,
her off-guards are going to need to be
flexible to allow her to operate some
what normally.
"If we want to run a play for C'an
dice on the wing, I can play point
guard," Pierce said. "But it looks right
now like she'll be playing the 'one. 1 "
For the moment. Van Derveer is not
making a permanent decision. Van-
Derveer says that this moment can be
a big opportunity for Pierce, Boden
steiner. Murphy and Coleman to show
what they can offer the team with more
minutes of playing time.
"If Cissy or Clare come in and do
what [graduated guard] Krista Rappa
hahn did and knock down five or six
threes and make really good plays,
then we'll play them." VanDerveer
said."But if Mel or Markisha say [with
their play], Hey, I'm going to be the
one,' then we'll play them."
