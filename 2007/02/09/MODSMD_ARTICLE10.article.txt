dreds of hours over the past 11 months to

NICK CHENG
Cheng, from Cincinnati, Oliin, is majoring in
comparative studies in race and ethnicity. His
passions include service work and outdoor ac
tivities like skiing, hiking, camping and caving.
How did you get involved in
Dance Marathon?
1 moraled for a friend. And I got completely
hooked when 1 saw the enthusiasm and dedica
tion of the students who put on DM2005. When
they announced the total amount of money
raised. I realized I could engage students in
service by becoming part of Team DM. 1 was
the web exec last year.and I was so excited after
DM2006 that, instead of sleeping after the
event (from Friday morning to Sunday night I
got five non-continuous hours of sleep), I wrote
a giant outline of how I thought we could reor
ganize for this year to make ourselves more ef
fective. I gave it to the co-chairs to give to next
year's co-chairs and. well, here 1 am.
Who is your inspiration?
Amanda Crowell-ltliong. the service groups
outreach coordinator at the Haas Center, is
amazing — she's got the most creative solu
tions for so many different kinds of problems,
and I've talked to her for hours on topics
ranging from "We can't figure out the best
ways to engage this section of DM — can you
help us?" to "What on earth do I do with my
life?" 1 could never put into words how awe
some she's been.
What is your favorite hook?
1 don't know how to choose — there are so
many great ones. My two favorites over the
past few years are "Things Fall Apart"
(Achebe) and Pullman's "His Dark Materi
als" trilogy.
What arc your plans for the future?
Find the best intersection between my skill
set and community needs. And I will continue
to pursue that wherever it may lead.
How do you feel now that Dance Marathon
is onl\ a few days away?
I'm so, so excited — I can't wait until the clos
ing ceremony when the dancers can see what
they've accomplished. I also can't wait until

that last hour when the pace gets feverish,
we're almost there, and there's this empow
ered community saying, "We did it!" And
then to see our staff watch their year of work
and dedication come to fruition. That will be
amazing too.
What is your favorite dance move?
Although I'm completely uncoordinated, 1
enjoy the little social dance I know. And
DDR, of course.
TORYKAUER
Kiuier is an American studies major from
Cleveland Heights, Ohio. She is also a peer
counselor at the Bridge, a kitchen manager at
drove House, a tour guide, a babysitter and a
member of Stanford Women in Business. Her
interests include being outside, dancing and
hanging out with friends.
What has been your most memorable
experience at Stanford?
Probably my freshman year at Dance
Marathon when it was revealed that we had
exceeded our fundraising goal of $40.(H)0 by
$10,000.1 was ecstatic — perhaps due in part
to incredible exhaustion, but 1 really felt a
sense of accomplishment and community that
1 have not found anywhere else.
How did you get involved in
Dance Marathon?
1 have been in Dance Marathon since its be
ginning at Stanford two years ago. My fresh
man year I was a dancer, and 1 unfortunately
sprained my ankle four hours into the event.
I lowever, 1 stayed and did the rest of the event
on crutches. After that experience. 1 knew that
if I did the event on crutches, I could certainly
do it again with the use of both of my legs, so 1
was a dancer again my sophomore year. I had
such an incredible experience my second time
around that 1 figured 1 would apply to be co
chair, and. lo and behold, 1 got the position,
and DM has been my life ever since.
Who are your role models?
My mom. Sylvia Nguyen and Joel Philpot.
Without the support of these three individu
als, I do not know what I would do. I depend
on them for emotional support, and 1 am in
credibly grateful for their presence in my life.
What is your favorite book?
Sounds rather cliche, but one of them is defi
nitely "Mountains Beyond Mountains" by
Tracy Kidder. Whenever I need a little extra
motivation I return to this book. It helps
ground me and remember the reason why we
are doing all of this work.
W hat will you do when Dance
Marathon is over?
I suppose the first thing I will do is sleep for a
very long time. After that I am sure I will find
something to occupy myself with.

What are your plans for the future?
At the moment I am interested in getting in
volved in business — in particular leadership
and development work. I lowever.who knows
where 1 will end up? It's kind of exciting and
a little intimidating to think about life after
Stanford.
What is your favorite part about
Dance Marathon?
My favorite part is the feeling of community
and accomplishment that each dancer gets by
staying the full 24 hours. There really is no
other feeling like it.

What has been your most memorable
experience at Stanford?
Probably my freshman year at Dance
Marathon when it was revealed that we had
exceeded our fundraising goal of $40.(H)0 by
$10,000.1 was ecstatic — perhaps due in part
to incredible exhaustion, but 1 really felt a
sense of accomplishment and community that
1 have not found anywhere else.
How did you get involved in
Dance Marathon?
1 have been in Dance Marathon since its be
ginning at Stanford two years ago. My fresh
man year I was a dancer, and 1 unfortunately
sprained my ankle four hours into the event.
I lowever, 1 stayed and did the rest of the event
on crutches. After that experience. 1 knew that
if I did the event on crutches, I could certainly
do it again with the use of both of my legs, so 1
was a dancer again my sophomore year. I had
such an incredible experience my second time
around that 1 figured 1 would apply to be co
chair, and. lo and behold, 1 got the position,
and DM has been my life ever since.
Who are your role models?
My mom. Sylvia Nguyen and Joel Philpot.
Without the support of these three individu
als, I do not know what I would do. I depend
on them for emotional support, and 1 am in
credibly grateful for their presence in my life.
What is your favorite book?
Sounds rather cliche, but one of them is defi
nitely "Mountains Beyond Mountains" by
Tracy Kidder. Whenever I need a little extra
motivation I return to this book. It helps
ground me and remember the reason why we
are doing all of this work.
W hat will you do when Dance
Marathon is over?
I suppose the first thing I will do is sleep for a
very long time. After that I am sure I will find
something to occupy myself with.

What are your plans for the future?
At the moment I am interested in getting in
volved in business — in particular leadership
and development work. I lowever.who knows
where 1 will end up? It's kind of exciting and
a little intimidating to think about life after
Stanford.
What is your favorite part about
Dance Marathon?
My favorite part is the feeling of community
and accomplishment that each dancer gets by
staying the full 24 hours. There really is no
other feeling like it.
