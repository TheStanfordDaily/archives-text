## Editorial Board Stanford wisdom on Iran 
### 
In recent weeks, President Hush has
brought this country ever closer to be
ginning a war against Iran. In a danger
ous game of bullying, brinkmanship and
tough rhetoric. Bush has sent a second air
craft carrier to the Gulf, conducted raids on
Iranian embassies and authorized the US
military to kill or capture Iranian operatives
in Iraq. Even more worrisome. President
Bush refuses to rule out the possibility of a
nuclear strike, publicly maintaining that "all
options remain on the table "
The White House is rightly concerned
about the threat from Iran. Iranian presi
dent Ahmadinejad is a menace who denies
the Holocaust and maniacally clings to a
thinly veiled ambition of developing nu
clear weapons. Iranian meddling frustrates
American efforts in Iraq while overt sup
port for terrorist organizations such as
Hezbollah and Hamas threatens American
allies abroad. Despite these dangers, a mili
tary confrontation is not the answer. In fact,
the first bomb dropped on Iran would spell
disaster for American security objectives.
Members of Congress may be the only ones
who can stop this calamity.
Experts here at Stanford have made it
clear that conflict with Iran would only
strengthen Ahmadinejad's tenuous hold on
power and solidify the Iranian public's tepid
resolve to acquire nuclear weapons. In a tes
timony before Congress last week. Hoover
Research Fellow and Iranian expert Abbas
Milani described how Ahmadinejad's arro
gant spending and poor domestic policies
have undermined his former supporters.
The only thing that would save Ahmadine
jad. argues Milani. is a conflict with the U.S.
A public panel two weeks ago echoed Mi

lam's views. There. Hoover Senior Fellow
and former US. official in Iraq. Prof. Larry
Diamond, urged Congress to enact strict
legislation limiting the ability of the presi
dent to widen the current war in Iraq to in
clude Iran.
Since President Bush has already demon
strated that he is willing to ignore expert ad
vice and intelligence in rushing to war. con
gressional legislation may be the only op
tion Ilius. Congress must act now to re
strain the President from starting yet anoth
er war on a whim. Representative Walter
Jones (R-N.C.) has made a promising start
in January by introducing legislation to do
just that. We urge both parties to support his
efforts.
At the very least, we encourage Congress
to pay heed to an open letter last week from
Nobel Laureate and Stanford Prof. Douglas
Osherofl and 11 other Nobel Prize winning
physicists. In the letter, Osheroff and col
leagues called on Congress to enact legisla
tion requiring the president to seek congres
sional approval before conducting nuclear
strikes against states which do not have nu
clear weapons.This is a no-brainer.
A nuclear attack launched on impulse
against a state which does not have nuclear
weapons would set a dangerous precedent,
spark the development of countless other
nuclear weapons programs and set back
U.S. security for decades. Of course, nothing
in Osheroff's proposal would protect a state
with nuclear weapons from such a strike.
Consequently, Iran still has a strong incen
tive to refrain from acquiring nukes.This ap
proach is the correct one. We commend Os
heroff for his efforts, and we hope Congress
is listening.
