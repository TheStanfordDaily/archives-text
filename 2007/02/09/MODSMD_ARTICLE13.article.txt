# Hungry labradors, faceless Frenchies and reality TV
## 
### 
In May 2005. Isabelle Dinoire awoke
from a drug-induced sleep. She then at
tempted to smoke a cigarette but was
confused as to why she couldn't hold the cig
arette between her lips. According to The
New York Times, that was when she "saw
the pool of blood and the dog beside it." Six
months later. Ms. Dinoire became the vehi
cle for a scientific breakthrough as the first
recipient of a face transplant. Ms. Dinoire's
moment in the limelight culminated in a
press conference on February 6. 2006.
Though her borrowed lower lip hung slack
below her gums, she was still able to drink
water from a plastic cup. At points her face
twitched, indicating the future possibility of
being able to smile.
One year after her historic media appear
ance, the French seem willing to let Ms. Di
noire disappear from the press and focus
primarily on the amazing scientific feat that
her new face signifies. However, 1 am fairly
certain that if Ms. Dinoire and her Labrador
resided in the United States, her fate would
have unfolded quite differently. Clearly, Ms.
Dinoire would have ended up on "The
Swan."
For those unfamiliar with the premise of
Fox's cancelled reality show. "The Swan"
was a beauty pageant with a twist. Each
episode "made-over" two fairly unattractive
women with extreme cosmetic surgery,
three months of personal training, psycho
logical counseling and nutritional advice. At
the end of each episode, one woman was
picked to compete in the season finale beau
ty contest. ITie woman who had metamor
phosed most successfully from ugly duck
ling to swan — as determined via tradition
al beauty pageant categories, including a
swimsuit contest — was declared the win
ner of the show.
Wouldn't Ms. Dinoire. with her tragic
background and hideous disfigurement,
make the perfect contestant? Fade in as Ms.
Dinoire struggles with the elliptical.Transi
tion to the scene where Ms. Dinoire learns
to trust her Labrador again with the help of
a celebrity psychologist. Jump cut to Ms. Di
noire competing against the other finalists
in the talent segment of the beauty competi
tion where she does the can-can and sings a
bawdy.yet wistful.ditty from her homeland.
I really think that if FOX had access to
Ms. Dinoire, they would have gleefully
served her up to the American public then
cheerfully dry-humped the giant pile of

money that they made from the outlandish
ratings.
What is wrong with us? We are of an era
when Web sites such as rheSuperficial.com
hungrily follow Denise Richards' latest
labia slip and. consequently, are rewarded
with more than one billion hits per day. If
France's transplant-happy medical commu
nity is as an indicator of French values. 1 can
not help hut question the meaning behind
America's public appetite for the grotesque
underbelly of humanity.
Where is the boundary between the sala
cious and the perverse? Fvents considered
shocking a few years ago — for example,
Janet Jackson's nipple slip at the 2004 Super
Bowl — now pale in comparison to watch
ing Pete Doherty. Kate Moss's boy-toy. in
ject cocaine into his arm in a Thai hostel.
On the one-year anniversary of Ms. Di
noire's press conference, I find myself con
vinced that the American public will not
grow tired of other people's perverted ab
surdities as quickly as the French let Ms. Di
noire fade from the media. Being the bud
ding despot that I am, I am partial to the
idea of an Entertainment Czar relegated ul
timate power to decide what is and is not
high-brow enough for the American masses.
Just picture an Internet full of innovative art
and culture, completely devoid of Lindsay
Lohan's insipid misadventures.
Unfortunately, with our fervent rever
ence for "freedom of speech," it seems un
likely that we would stand for a Big Broth
er-esque figure censoring entertainment
content on television and the Internet. Pity.
Knowing the unscrupulous ethics of the
men in suits at Network Cable, by this time
next year they will have stolen my "The
Swan" revival idea and have added 50
midgets competing for the winner's affec
tions in a battle royal.
