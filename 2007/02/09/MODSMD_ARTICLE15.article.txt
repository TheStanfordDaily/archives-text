The Quad (is that where you all live?)
Stanford CA. 94305
Dear Ms. (and maybe Mr.) Stanford Under
graduate,
I am a first-year student at Stanford Law
School and am interested in making your
acquaintance. I first learned about your
existence from the Web site
www.stanford.edu. after which I was rejected
from your fine institution when the admis
sions committee interpreted as fraudulent
my somewhat hyperbolic claim that 1 ghost
wrote the Bible. Although my initial sortie
into your lands was repelled, the undergrad
uate peoples of Stanford have always in
trigued me, and I continued to "wish they all
could be California girls" (and sometimes
guys). It is with a strong belief that you are a
tribe with whom 1 could have many fruitful
interactions that 1 write you this missive.
I have extensive experience interacting
with people, especially those of the XX as
sortment. My mother, my first and foremost
female role model, raised only one fool —
my brother. Following her advice. I avoided
all contact with women under her command
ment that "once 1 got a steady job. I could
think about marriage. But only then." Iliis
brilliant methodology resulted in zero bad
breakups, no hurt feelings and a lrightening
ly fervent devotion to personal hygiene.
I know that many of you are living that

same glory in your time here at Stanford. I
see you skulking around campus, trying to in
flate your CiPAs and garnish your resumes,
all the while hoping, no, praying, that your
bright, lucrative futures will shed light
retroactively on the dark, dank weekends
you've passed in the Chem Lab or in the
stacks of whatever you call your undergrad
library. Well. I'm you down that road.and I'm
here to tell you that your resplendent future
will, in fact, enable a revisionist view of your
past. At least it might, especially if this plea
bears the fruit that 1 am imagining.
For now the maternally-imposed hiatus is
over! Not because 1 have a steady job (I most
likely never will), but because my mother no
longer has complete control over everything
I do ( just most things). As such. 1 am open to
meeting and getting to know all of the beau
tiful peoples of this world who were hereto
fore deprived of my company. And what bet
ter place to do that than the "House of
Cards" that somehow has its own zip code?
By the end of this letter I'm sure that you too
will be convinced that our conversations

could yield much benefit to society.
For starters, we have the same interests.
You need refreshments for your parties; I can
buy you said beverages, legally. You need a
lawyer to convince a judge that "you only
tried coke that one time, just to see what it
was like, and you'll never do it again": I can
be that lawyer. Hell, 1 can be that judge.
You've just cooked a load of dosas with spicy
coconut chutney, and you have no clue what
to do with them. 1 will eat your dosas. All of
them.
But we are more than just BFFs in a social
sense — we are ideologically in sync. I'm a
progressive who loves America. You're a
compassionate conservative. We both want
to do more to help the poor while promoting
personal responsibility, and neither of us
wants the terrorists to win. So let's move for
ward without forgetting the past and forge a
new direction for our nation that's a continu
ation of our time-tested traditions.
References are available upon request
from my mom. Chief Justice John Roberts
and Dana Gioia (1 can't believe you've never
heard of him!).TTiank you for your time and
consideration, and I look forward to hearing
from you soon.
Sincerely yours,
Vishnu Sridharan
