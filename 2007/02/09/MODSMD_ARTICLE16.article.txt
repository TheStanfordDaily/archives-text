The appearance of the shiny, black lim
ousines, the bountiful bouquets of ex
pensive flowers and the impeccably
clad men on campus can only mean one
thing: it's just another day at Stanford Uni
versity, wedding photo capital of the Western
world.
While the rest of the world reserves such
luxuries for special occasions like the rose
colored holiday just around the corner, we
Farm-hands are privy to romantic extrava
gance all year long. Professional photogra
phers? I nearly ran one over yesterday.
Never-to-be-worn-again bridesmaid dress
es? Serra Mall is a virtual catwalk. Clearly,
this campus (and by "this campus," 1 mean
the Quad.the Oval, and the Rodin Sculpture
Garden in particular) holds the utmost of
amorous possibilities — for some people,
that is.
But what about those of us who actually
live here/qualify for MemChu nuptials? With
Valentine's Day less than a week away, it's
only natural to wonder: w here do we fit into
the global brid;il order? Or rather, where
does it fit into our busy day planners?
Based on ;i verv informal survey conducted

over the course of my four years as an un
dergrad. I have empirical proof that virtual
ly every romantic interaction on this cam
pus falls into one of three categories, none
of which resemble anything close to the
classic Hollywood/Danielle Steele para
digm.
1. Random hook-ups.
These passionate, generally substance-en
abled deep connections happen at colleges
the world over, but, here at Stanford.they oc
cupy a special place in our over-worked,
under-slept lives. With little time or energy
left over to commit to anyone other than the
single most important person in the world
(that would be you), many dedicated stu

dents view the random hook-up as the most
realistic option for much-needed, um, ro
mantic release.
Yes. it's narcissistic, but it's not necessarily
evil — provided both parties have a full un
derstanding of the expectations (and the lack
thereof) vis a vis tomorrow. You will not ex
change Hallmark cards on Wednesday, nor
will you receive an a cappella serenade. You
might, however, exchange a few words the
next time your paths cross. Might.
Lest you (or your respected campus ad
ministrators) begin to worry, this commit
ment- and expectation-free stage says noth
ing about the romantic health of Stanford's
undergraduate population. In fact. I would
venture to say. the random hook-up phase is
a part of normal collegiate development.
Nearly all of my friends, both male and fe
male, went through a period of exploration.
For some (mostly women), the stage lasted a
quarter; for one (male), who still lives in the
area and regularly attends sorority formals.
it's been a glorious seven years.
One clarification. Randomness exists in
