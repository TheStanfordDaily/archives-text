The appearance of the shiny, black lim
ousines, the bountiful bouquets of ex
pensive flowers and the impeccably
clad men on campus can only mean one
thing: it's just another day at Stanford Uni
versity, wedding photo capital of the Western
world.
While the rest of the world reserves such
luxuries for special occasions like the rose
colored holiday just around the corner, we
Farm-hands are privy to romantic extrava
gance all year long. Professional photogra
phers? I nearly ran one over yesterday.
Never-to-be-worn-again bridesmaid dress
es? Serra Mall is a virtual catwalk. Clearly,
this campus (and by "this campus," 1 mean
the Quad.the Oval, and the Rodin Sculpture
Garden in particular) holds the utmost of
amorous possibilities — for some people,
that is.
But what about those of us who actually
live here/qualify for MemChu nuptials? With
Valentine's Day less than a week away, it's
only natural to wonder: w here do we fit into
the global brid;il order? Or rather, where
does it fit into our busy day planners?
Based on ;i verv informal survey conducted

over the course of my four years as an un
dergrad. I have empirical proof that virtual
ly every romantic interaction on this cam
pus falls into one of three categories, none
of which resemble anything close to the
classic Hollywood/Danielle Steele para
digm.
1. Random hook-ups.
These passionate, generally substance-en
abled deep connections happen at colleges
the world over, but, here at Stanford.they oc
cupy a special place in our over-worked,
under-slept lives. With little time or energy
left over to commit to anyone other than the
single most important person in the world
(that would be you), many dedicated stu

dents view the random hook-up as the most
realistic option for much-needed, um, ro
mantic release.
Yes. it's narcissistic, but it's not necessarily
evil — provided both parties have a full un
derstanding of the expectations (and the lack
thereof) vis a vis tomorrow. You will not ex
change Hallmark cards on Wednesday, nor
will you receive an a cappella serenade. You
might, however, exchange a few words the
next time your paths cross. Might.
Lest you (or your respected campus ad
ministrators) begin to worry, this commit
ment- and expectation-free stage says noth
ing about the romantic health of Stanford's
undergraduate population. In fact. I would
venture to say. the random hook-up phase is
a part of normal collegiate development.
Nearly all of my friends, both male and fe
male, went through a period of exploration.
For some (mostly women), the stage lasted a
quarter; for one (male), who still lives in the
area and regularly attends sorority formals.
it's been a glorious seven years.
One clarification. Randomness exists in


Mendelman
Pearls of wisdom
two forms: unknown, in which you
don't know his or her name prior to
the evening's interaction, and un
planned. in which you most certainly
know one another, but not in that
way. One might think that acquain
tances and friends make better
hook-ups, but, based on my personal
experience, this is far from true (at
Full Moon on the Quad my fresh
man year. I vowed to only kiss peo
ple 1 knew, neglecting to consider the
ensuing awkward meals/house
meetings/ski trips). In general, more
prior contact equals greater expecta
tions (this nugget ol" truth may be
one of the few carry-overs from the
Stanford dating bubble into the real
world), which can easily lead to an
interaction that belongs in the next
category.
2. Regular hook-ups.
Long before Facebook existed,
the "It's complicated" category was
alive and well on the Farm. We've
been complicated since 1895. as far
as I 'm concerned. Just because Her
bert later wrote of being captivated
by Lou Henry's "whimsical mind,
her blue eyes and a broad grinnish
smile," we have no reason to believe
the Hoovers' five-year path to the
altar was a perfectly smooth one.
I tell, he was a senior and she was a
freshman in the virtually all-male ge
ology department. If that's not a sit
uation ripe for complication. 1 don't
know what is.
lliis category may well be the
most popular option on campus. It's
more stable than the random hook
up. which, by definition, can only
happen once, but it's hardly a com
mitted. time-consuming connection.
At least until one person starts to
tall, the regular hook-up is driven by
the unbeatable tag-team known as
ambiguity and convenience, requir
ing both willing and able parties to
be in the right place at the right time.
This issue of proximity may explain
why so many of these interactions in
volve a staff member of some sort.

Forget well-positioned sconces,
everyone looks attractive under a
red light.
3. Pseudo-marriage.
While everyone else enjoys free
heart-shaped candy at Stern dining,
a small portion (my sources suggest
less than 25%) of Stanford students
will soon be enjoying a romantic,
candle-lit dinner in one of Palo
Alto's expensive restaurants (not
that there are many other options).
Also known as Siamese twins and se
rial monogamists, the Cardinal-col
ored versions of TomKat and
Brangelina prefer to spend four
years attached at the hip, memorize
one another's schedules, and keep
most ot their sane classmates firmly
rooted in category #2.
Given the heft of the average
courseload. it's understandable why
most Stanford students shy away
from the equivalent of a five-unit
class. From the moment the love
birds wake up in their shared twin
extra-long to the time they return to
its miniature parameters, they are
virtually connected. Thanks to tech
nology. it's now possible to talk en
route to class, I\l throughout lec
ture, and exchange text messages
during meetings. At least until it ends
in a blaze of angry emails inspired by
a philosophical/political rift.
Careful readers will note that,
though I am now a grad student, this
column has focused exclusively on
undergraduate mating habits. Con
trary to popular belief, grad students
do. in fact, have lives that reach be
yond the lab and/or library, and
some of them, not just sketchy un
dergrad-hunters, even make time to
date. By dating, I mean coffee dates
and sit-down dinners, not a walk
around Lake Lag. a stopover at
Tresidder.or a surreptitious meeting
in the stacks (though I'm sure all of
these occur, too). However, as a
member of this older and wiser pop
ulation. 1 have also learned that it is
much better not to kiss and tell.

prior contact equals greater expecta
tions (this nugget ol" truth may be
one of the few carry-overs from the
Stanford dating bubble into the real
world), which can easily lead to an
interaction that belongs in the next
category.
2. Regular hook-ups.
Long before Facebook existed,
the "It's complicated" category was
alive and well on the Farm. We've
been complicated since 1895. as far
as I 'm concerned. Just because Her
bert later wrote of being captivated
by Lou Henry's "whimsical mind,
her blue eyes and a broad grinnish
smile," we have no reason to believe
the Hoovers' five-year path to the
altar was a perfectly smooth one.
I tell, he was a senior and she was a
freshman in the virtually all-male ge
ology department. If that's not a sit
uation ripe for complication. 1 don't
know what is.
lliis category may well be the
most popular option on campus. It's
more stable than the random hook
up. which, by definition, can only
happen once, but it's hardly a com
mitted. time-consuming connection.
At least until one person starts to
tall, the regular hook-up is driven by
the unbeatable tag-team known as
ambiguity and convenience, requir
ing both willing and able parties to
be in the right place at the right time.
This issue of proximity may explain
why so many of these interactions in
volve a staff member of some sort.

Forget well-positioned sconces,
everyone looks attractive under a
red light.
3. Pseudo-marriage.
While everyone else enjoys free
heart-shaped candy at Stern dining,
a small portion (my sources suggest
less than 25%) of Stanford students
will soon be enjoying a romantic,
candle-lit dinner in one of Palo
Alto's expensive restaurants (not
that there are many other options).
Also known as Siamese twins and se
rial monogamists, the Cardinal-col
ored versions of TomKat and
Brangelina prefer to spend four
years attached at the hip, memorize
one another's schedules, and keep
most ot their sane classmates firmly
rooted in category #2.
Given the heft of the average
courseload. it's understandable why
most Stanford students shy away
from the equivalent of a five-unit
class. From the moment the love
birds wake up in their shared twin
extra-long to the time they return to
its miniature parameters, they are
virtually connected. Thanks to tech
nology. it's now possible to talk en
route to class, I\l throughout lec
ture, and exchange text messages
during meetings. At least until it ends
in a blaze of angry emails inspired by
a philosophical/political rift.
Careful readers will note that,
though I am now a grad student, this
column has focused exclusively on
undergraduate mating habits. Con
trary to popular belief, grad students
do. in fact, have lives that reach be
yond the lab and/or library, and
some of them, not just sketchy un
dergrad-hunters, even make time to
date. By dating, I mean coffee dates
and sit-down dinners, not a walk
around Lake Lag. a stopover at
Tresidder.or a surreptitious meeting
in the stacks (though I'm sure all of
these occur, too). However, as a
member of this older and wiser pop
ulation. 1 have also learned that it is
much better not to kiss and tell.

The appearance of the shiny, black lim
ousines, the bountiful bouquets of ex
pensive flowers and the impeccably
clad men on campus can only mean one
thing: it's just another day at Stanford Uni
versity, wedding photo capital of the Western
world.
While the rest of the world reserves such
luxuries for special occasions like the rose
colored holiday just around the corner, we
Farm-hands are privy to romantic extrava
gance all year long. Professional photogra
phers? I nearly ran one over yesterday.
Never-to-be-worn-again bridesmaid dress
es? Serra Mall is a virtual catwalk. Clearly,
this campus (and by "this campus," 1 mean
the Quad.the Oval, and the Rodin Sculpture
Garden in particular) holds the utmost of
amorous possibilities — for some people,
that is.
But what about those of us who actually
live here/qualify for MemChu nuptials? With
Valentine's Day less than a week away, it's
only natural to wonder: w here do we fit into
the global brid;il order? Or rather, where
does it fit into our busy day planners?
Based on ;i verv informal survey conducted

over the course of my four years as an un
dergrad. I have empirical proof that virtual
ly every romantic interaction on this cam
pus falls into one of three categories, none
of which resemble anything close to the
classic Hollywood/Danielle Steele para
digm.
1. Random hook-ups.
These passionate, generally substance-en
abled deep connections happen at colleges
the world over, but, here at Stanford.they oc
cupy a special place in our over-worked,
under-slept lives. With little time or energy
left over to commit to anyone other than the
single most important person in the world
(that would be you), many dedicated stu

dents view the random hook-up as the most
realistic option for much-needed, um, ro
mantic release.
Yes. it's narcissistic, but it's not necessarily
evil — provided both parties have a full un
derstanding of the expectations (and the lack
thereof) vis a vis tomorrow. You will not ex
change Hallmark cards on Wednesday, nor
will you receive an a cappella serenade. You
might, however, exchange a few words the
next time your paths cross. Might.
Lest you (or your respected campus ad
ministrators) begin to worry, this commit
ment- and expectation-free stage says noth
ing about the romantic health of Stanford's
undergraduate population. In fact. I would
venture to say. the random hook-up phase is
a part of normal collegiate development.
Nearly all of my friends, both male and fe
male, went through a period of exploration.
For some (mostly women), the stage lasted a
quarter; for one (male), who still lives in the
area and regularly attends sorority formals.
it's been a glorious seven years.
One clarification. Randomness exists in

Pearls of wisdom
two forms: unknown, in which you
don't know his or her name prior to
the evening's interaction, and un
planned. in which you most certainly
know one another, but not in that
way. One might think that acquain
tances and friends make better
hook-ups, but, based on my personal
experience, this is far from true (at
Full Moon on the Quad my fresh
man year. I vowed to only kiss peo
ple 1 knew, neglecting to consider the
ensuing awkward meals/house
meetings/ski trips). In general, more
prior contact equals greater expecta
tions (this nugget ol" truth may be

interaction that belongs in the next
