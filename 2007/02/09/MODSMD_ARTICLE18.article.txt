# Card D crushes Cougars
## No. 11 Women hold Washington State to record-low 34 in home victory after crushing defeat to Cal, loss of Hones 
### SCOTT BLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford women's basketball
team defeated Washington State 60-34 at
Maples Pavilion on Ihursday night to im
prove to 44 0 all-time against the Cougars.
Freshman center Jayne Appel scored 19
points to lead all players and added 14 re
bounds for the first double-double of her ca
reer.
"We played with a purpose." Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We
wanted to get the hull inside, and I thought
people were working really hard to get
Jayne the ball."
Junior guard Candice Wiggins chipped in
16 points, and senior forward Brooke Smith
added 12 for the Cardinal (20-4.12-1 Pacif
ic-10 Conference).
"We wanted this one so we could move
on from the last game," Appel said.
The first-year post did everything she
could to facilitate the victory, using all of her
moves, including a neat left-hand hook in
the second half, to overpower Washington
State (5-19, 1-13 Pac-10). ITie Cougars'
starting frontcourt combined for seven
fouls and only three points.
Ihat was just part of a general malaise af
flicting Washington State during the game.
The Cougars had to wait 6:24 for their sec
ond field goal after hitting their first shot of
the game and finished the first half with
only 11 points on 10.3 percent shooting.
Washington State was also a horrendous 0-
for-16 from three-point range. Their final
tally of 34 points (10-for-58 from the field,
17.2 percent) made the Cougars the lowest
scoring conference opponent in Stanford's
history.
Stanford's defenders hounded Washing
ton State's shooters all night long, blocking
seven shots, forcing a number of off-balance
attempts and inducing a shot-clock viola
tion in the first half.
"I thought we worked hard defensively
and really tried to get out on their shooters,"
VanDerveer said.
Both teams opened with sloppy play, as
Stanford missed six of its first nine shots to
keep a narrow Cardinal lead of 10 6 over
eight minutes into the game. But Stanford
blew the contest open with a 13-3 run over
the next eight minutes. The ('ardinal's points

came from all over the court: Appel and
Smith finished in the paint and Wiggins hit a
three-pointer just alter stealing the ball and
assisting junior ( issy Pierce on a fast-break.
Hie Cardinal picked up in the second half
right where il left off, expanding its 17-point
halltime lead to 27 over the first eight-and-a
hall minutes of the second period. Wiggins
sank another two three-pointers and Appel
continued her strong night, despite injuries
to Smith and senior center Kristen Newlin.
Hie pair sat out the rest of the game after
Smith rolled her light ankle and Newlin
came out of a scrum under the basket with
what appeared to be whiplash. Newlin was
still experiencing pain after the game.

Still, Washington State never threatened
Stanford's dominating lead. The Cardinal's
combination of energetic all-around play
and Washington State's frustrating night on
offense left the Cougars entirely drained of
energy midway through the second half.
Iliey went quietly as Stanford's reserves
finished the game.
One game after starting point guard JJ
Hones' season-ending ACL injury, Van-
Dei veer said she was pleased with the ef
forts of all of her guards. Wiggins, however,
had special praise in store for freshman
