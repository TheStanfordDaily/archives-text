# Madness looms in Feb.gloom
## 
### 
For a lot of fans, the month of Feb
ruary fees like a lull in the sports
world. 'Ihe Super Bowl is over,
the NBA is still iu its fairly mundane
midseason and the NHI well, let's
just not go there.
And these detractors definitely
have a point. February, on the surface,
really seems to be a dull month for
sports. But those who come to this eon
elusion are missing out â€” college bas
ketball is all that this fanatic needs for
his sports fix.
I'm pretty sure that I could write a
doctoral dissertation explaining why
the college game completely outdoes
its professional counterpart, but I only
have around SIX) words each week to
convince you of my opinion, so I won't.
Plus, I'm not sure Stanford offers a PhD
in hoops (yet).
But 1 digress.
College basketball fever is rampant
nationwide at this time of the year,
from Madison to Chapel Hill to the
"rolling foothills" at our campus' very
doorstep.
Iliis week, there have been rivalry
games between the likes of Texas and
Texas A & M. Duke and North Caroli
na and UCLA and Southern Califor
nia. You don't even have to like basket
ball to know that these schools will al
ways produce exciting and emotionally
charged games when they play against
one another.
100 often, I find myself sitting back
on my couch, watching my television
and saying to myself, "Could it really
get any better than this?"
Of course not. ITiat is, not until
