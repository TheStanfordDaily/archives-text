# Madness looms in Feb.gloom
## 
### 
For a lot of fans, the month of Feb
ruary fees like a lull in the sports
world. 'Ihe Super Bowl is over,
the NBA is still iu its fairly mundane
midseason and the NHI well, let's
just not go there.
And these detractors definitely
have a point. February, on the surface,
really seems to be a dull month for
sports. But those who come to this eon
elusion are missing out — college bas
ketball is all that this fanatic needs for
his sports fix.
I'm pretty sure that I could write a
doctoral dissertation explaining why
the college game completely outdoes
its professional counterpart, but I only
have around SIX) words each week to
convince you of my opinion, so I won't.
Plus, I'm not sure Stanford offers a PhD
in hoops (yet).
But 1 digress.
College basketball fever is rampant
nationwide at this time of the year,
from Madison to Chapel Hill to the
"rolling foothills" at our campus' very
doorstep.
Iliis week, there have been rivalry
games between the likes of Texas and
Texas A & M. Duke and North Caroli
na and UCLA and Southern Califor
nia. You don't even have to like basket
ball to know that these schools will al
ways produce exciting and emotionally
charged games when they play against
one another.
100 often, I find myself sitting back
on my couch, watching my television
and saying to myself, "Could it really
get any better than this?"
Of course not. ITiat is, not until


Salisbury
Above ihe Rim
March, anyway.
College basketball is just getting
started. And that's a wonderful thing.
So bring on the power conferences,
the mid-majors, the bubble teams and
even the Ivy League.
Bring on the 12 seeds beating the
five seeds, the 15s shocking the twos,
and of course, the expected top-seed
dominance.
Bring on the inevitable upsets, the
overtime heroics and the miraculous
buzzer beaters.
Bring on the powerhouses: the
UCLAs. North Carolinas and Floridas
of the world. Bring on the teams who
breezed into the tournament, the at
large teams who struggled to make it in.
and the teams who were lucky to win
their conference tournaments.
Bring on the George Masons and
Wichita States of the world. Because
after all. the slipper does fit sometimes.
Bring on the future superstars who
make a name for themselves in the Big
Dance: the Carmelo Anthonys, the
Joakim Noahs and even the Michael
Jordans of the world.
I 'm ready for the Sweet 16, the Elite

I light and the Final Four. I leek. I can't
even wait for the play-in game — with
out a doubt the most inconsequential
game in March.
In case I haven't mentioned it be
fore. I really, really like college basket
ball.
It's really all 1 need.There is no bet
ter event in all of sports than the
NCAA tournament. It's one of the few
things in life that actually lives up to the
hype. Ihis separates it from Coke
Zero. Notre Dame Football and the
Super Bowl. And it you're better than
Coke Zero, then you've really got
something.
And the best part? Stanford has a
legitimate chance of being a part of it
all — a big part. A tournament run isn't
out of the question for the Cardinal so
long as the Lopez twins. I .awrence I lill
and Anthony Goods are involved.
There's only one real downer:
March Madness happens to start right
as our lives feel like they're ending. Hie
first two rounds of the tournament w ill
coincide with Dead Week and finals
week.
Make sure that you have your pri
orities straight.
