## Old Union delays ire students ASSU complains about lack of student input 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
After more than a year of con
struction and delays, administrators
say the new Old Union is nearing
completion.
But as the University prepares to
take possession of the renovated
building by the end of March.it is still
unclear when students might be able
to begin using the facility — which
was supposed to be completed by last
fall Campus groups are expressing
frustration that they have been ex
cluded in the decision-making
process and concern that the Univer
sity is making poor choices.
"Old Union is not being done
right." ASSU president Elizabeth
Heng '07 said in her State of the As
sociation speech Tuesday night.
Assistant Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Jennie Nicolayev said
that, "the Old Union project is near
ing the finish line."
"This doesn't mean that we'll be
moving in. but it does mean that the
fences will be down, the construction
crews gone and access to the building
will be controlled by the Vice
Provost of Student Affairs, as op
posed to the contractor," she said.
"We'll spend the months of April and
May taking care of signage, security,
IT and communications infrastruc
ture and the arrival and placement of
furniture."
While Nicolayev could not speci
fy when Old Union would reopen,
she said that Dean of Students Mau
reen Powers would "make sure that
seniors have an opportunity to tour
the building" if it is not completed
before their graduation in June.
Heng said that she would prefer to
see the timeline for the completion of
Old Union pushed to the fall if it
meant that more student feedback
could be incorporated into the plans.
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Chair 1 lershey Avula '08 and Senator
Mondaire Jones '09 agreed.
"To be fair, we were fairly in
volved in the process during last
spring and summer," Avula said. "We
helped design and choose the furni
ture for the rooms we would use."
However, both Avula and Jones
said that University responsiveness
to student input has declined since
the beginning of the academic year.
"I think that the concern of the
ASSU is that the University is mak
ing decisions about Old Union and
we're not hearing about them,"
Avula said.
"We've been in contact with the
University, and they're not shutting us
completely out," he said,adding that the
project has recently seemed increasing
ly closed off from student input.
In an email to The Daily, Avula
said the "building still fails to address
a lack of a social student gathering
places at Stanford."
Old Union Project Manager
Laura Goldstein said that student
input was widely considered in the
construction process.
"We had many focus groups with
students during the planning and de
sign phases of the project," she said.
"We also met individually with
groups of students and staff who will
occupy the buildings to complete the
design and select furniture."
Nicolayev praised the features of
the new building, citing the "stunning
redwood sanctuary" that will be part
of the Office of Religious Life's new
interfaith center on the third floor.
The first and second floors will be
filled with meeting rooms and
lounge spaces so "students will have
no trouble finding a comfortable
chair or couch to sink into."
The first floor will also include a
diner "still to be named by students"
that will serve burgers, shakes, pies
and sundaes. The ground floor will
also house a pool table and an enter
tainment area.
"We're deliberately leaving the
building in a fairly bare bones state in
terms of decoration," said Nicolayev,
"so that students can put whatever
stamp they'd like on the interior
spaces."
Avula envisioned a facility that
would be more conducive to social
interaction.
"It would have been great," he
wrote,"to see more social aspects put
into the blueprints as well — for ex

ample, a bowling alley, an arcade and
game room, pool tables, etc."
Jones acknowledged that he has
had the opportunity to share his vi
sion for the building.
"1 want to stress that 1 did meet
with an administrator about Old
Union," he said."but that virtually all
of the decisions concerning how stu
dent space should be used seemed to
have already been made."
Goldstein said that the Universi
ty's responsiveness to student input
had not declined. Instead, she said,
less input was needed as the project

moved from the design phase to the
construction phase. She explained
that the focus of the project during
the current academic year has been
on executing the plans developed
last spring.
The new Old Union will house
various student groups, including LI
Centre) Chicano, the Native Ameri
can Cultural Center and the Asian
American Activities Center. There is
a measure of discontent within these
groups about the lack of communica
tion between themselves and the
University with regard to the con

struction process.
"Spring quarter [of 2005-2006] is
the only time that I remember them
asking us how we wanted Old Union
to look, or what we wanted it to
have,"said Nydia Cardenas*oB, a vol
unteer at El Centro Chicano.
"Last year, they knocked down
one of our murals when they were
cleaning out the inside and only noti
fied us afterward," she said. "1 hope
nothing else has been changed."

also house a pool table and an enter
tainment area.
"We're deliberately leaving the
building in a fairly bare bones state in
terms of decoration," said Nicolayev,
"so that students can put whatever
stamp they'd like on the interior
spaces."
Avula envisioned a facility that
would be more conducive to social
interaction.
"It would have been great," he
wrote,"to see more social aspects put
into the blueprints as well — for ex

ample, a bowling alley, an arcade and
game room, pool tables, etc."
Jones acknowledged that he has
had the opportunity to share his vi
sion for the building.
"1 want to stress that 1 did meet
with an administrator about Old
Union," he said."but that virtually all
of the decisions concerning how stu
dent space should be used seemed to
have already been made."
Goldstein said that the Universi
ty's responsiveness to student input
had not declined. Instead, she said,
less input was needed as the project

moved from the design phase to the
construction phase. She explained
that the focus of the project during
the current academic year has been
on executing the plans developed
last spring.
The new Old Union will house
various student groups, including LI
Centre) Chicano, the Native Ameri
can Cultural Center and the Asian
American Activities Center. There is
a measure of discontent within these
groups about the lack of communica
tion between themselves and the
University with regard to the con

struction process.
"Spring quarter [of 2005-2006] is
the only time that I remember them
asking us how we wanted Old Union
to look, or what we wanted it to
have,"said Nydia Cardenas*oB, a vol
unteer at El Centro Chicano.
"Last year, they knocked down
one of our murals when they were
cleaning out the inside and only noti
fied us afterward," she said. "1 hope
nothing else has been changed."

The bike path next to Old Union was blocked off for renovation work, forcing bicyclists to make their way through a
muddy make-shift path over a grass patch. Students have expressed frustration about delays and a lack of input.
