## Old Union delays ire students ASSU complains about lack of student input 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
After more than a year of con
struction and delays, administrators
say the new Old Union is nearing
completion.
But as the University prepares to
take possession of the renovated
building by the end of March.it is still
unclear when students might be able
to begin using the facility â€” which
was supposed to be completed by last
fall Campus groups are expressing
frustration that they have been ex
cluded in the decision-making
process and concern that the Univer
sity is making poor choices.
"Old Union is not being done
right." ASSU president Elizabeth
Heng '07 said in her State of the As
sociation speech Tuesday night.
Assistant Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Jennie Nicolayev said
that, "the Old Union project is near
ing the finish line."
"This doesn't mean that we'll be
moving in. but it does mean that the
fences will be down, the construction
crews gone and access to the building
will be controlled by the Vice
Provost of Student Affairs, as op
posed to the contractor," she said.
"We'll spend the months of April and
May taking care of signage, security,
IT and communications infrastruc
ture and the arrival and placement of
furniture."
While Nicolayev could not speci
fy when Old Union would reopen,
she said that Dean of Students Mau
reen Powers would "make sure that
seniors have an opportunity to tour
the building" if it is not completed
before their graduation in June.
Heng said that she would prefer to
see the timeline for the completion of
Old Union pushed to the fall if it
meant that more student feedback
could be incorporated into the plans.
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Chair 1 lershey Avula '08 and Senator
Mondaire Jones '09 agreed.
"To be fair, we were fairly in
volved in the process during last
spring and summer," Avula said. "We
helped design and choose the furni
ture for the rooms we would use."
