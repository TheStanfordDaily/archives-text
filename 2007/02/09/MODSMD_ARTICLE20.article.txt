GAME NOTES: Stanford hopes to bounce back after
being swept by the Titans in Fullerton, Calif. Stanford
last lost its first three games in 1989, and has never
been swept in a three game series to start the season in
the school's recorded history. Nolan Gallagher will
take the mound for the Cardinal after having given up
six earned runs on eight hits in three innings of work
last Friday against tfie Titans. Despite its record, Stan
ford has had no trouble scoring in its first three games,
having notched 20 runs against Fullerton. The Cardi
nal is coming off of their 1 3th consecutive winning sea
son and has been above .500 in 41 of the past 42
seasons. As expected, junior Michael Taylor has been
an offensive leader for the Cardinal and is off to a hot
start with a home run, four RBI and has scored five runs
himself.

Ihe biggest obstacle to Stanford baseball
getting its first win of the season may be the
weather. Current Bay Area forecasts predict
rain for the next two days, possibly clearing
by Sunday morning.
This is far from welcome news for the
Cardinal (0-3,0-0 Pac-10). whose 2007 debut
at Sunken Diamond is sandwiched between
road trips to No. 8 Cal State-Fullerton and
No. 6'lexas. The worry on the Farm is that a
strong storm could wash out the first two
days of Stanford's home-opening three
game set against Fresno State (1-3, 0-0
WAC).
" Ihe weather's going to come into play,"
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said.
"Hopefully we can get all three in. We've al
ready gotten two days of practice this week,
so 1 think we can play better [than against
Fullerton]."

ITie Cardinal will attempt to rebound
from being swept by the Titans in an effort its
head coach rated a "C-minus." Stanford
jumped out to early leads in the second two
games only to lose them both due to incon
sistent pitching and outfield defense.
Still, they did not give up in any single
contest against the top-10 team. Alter giv ing
up 11 runs in the seventh inning of the series
finale, Stanford scored eight runs over the
final two innings to fall just short. 12-10.
"Obviously the results aren't exactly
what we wanted, but we played with some
flair," sophomore pitcher Jeremy Bleich
said. "We battled, not always at the right
time, but we showed a lot of positives. Base
ball's a funny game, so we just need to keep
playing hard."
Though not as impressive on paper as ei
ther the Titans or Longhorns. the defending
WAC-champion Bulldogs are once again
picked to finish toward the top of their con
ference.

"We played them last year, and they're al
ways a good club." sophomore second base
man Adam Yount said. "We're looking for
ward to the challenge they'll bring us."
Fresno State returns four starting posi
tion players with postseason experience
from last year's regional run. but their best
offensive contributor so far has been a new
comer. With four starts at third base, fresh
man Tom Mendonca is currently hitting .357
with two home runs and 11 total bases.
"Considering it's a non-conference game
early in the season, you just pitch to what you
see and then react to what they do." Bleich
said. "Scouting reports aren't really that
huge because I'm sure they have plenty of
new guys this year."
On the mound, the Cardinal will be going
with the same rotation as last week, with jun
ior righty Nolan (iallagher scheduled for Fri
day, followed by freshman Jeff lnman and
sophomore Jereim Bleich closing out the
weekend.

Of all the pitchers on staff, Gallagher (0-
1,1K.1H) f-RA) especially needs a strong per
formance. At I ullcrton. he pitched three in
nings, giving up seven runs, six of them
earned, en route to an 11-5 loss.
"Nolan didn't pitch well at all, and that
was a surprise to us," Marquess said. "If that
happens again over the next two weeks, then
you don't know why |he's struggling! an d
that's a problem. But you have to keep in
mind it was the first time we played against
outside competition, and very good competi
tion,at their home field. I think he'll be fine."
The most intriguing pitching matchup of
the weekend could be Bulldog junior Bran
don Burke (0-1,2.45 ERA) against lnman
(0-0,9.64) on Saturday. Both had solid per
formances early in their first starts but were
ultimately unable to get wins. Burke threw
seven innings of shutout baseball only to im-
pi ode in the eighth against USI tor
the loss while Inman started his Stan
ford career with three shutout in
nings before giving up five in the
next 1 2/3 for the no decision.
Bleich. who pitched six innings of
one-run hall against Fullerton. had
the most successful start last week
end despite the loss (0-1, 6.00). He
will look to eliminate the small mis
takes that cost him a win at Fullerton
on Sunday.
"It's just a matter of doing it at the
right time," Bleieh said. "Our timing
needs to get better: instead of playing
six innings of shutout baseball! we
need to play nine innings. We need to
put everything together in the same
game."
That also goes for Stanford's of
fense, which, despite averaging over
six runs a game, also managed to
strand 23 base runners. Twice over
the weekend, Stanford brought the
tying run to the plate in the ninth but
was unable to get that one key hit.
"1 don't think the lineup is ever
set," Yount said. "Everyone's com
peting with each other, we're going
to keep working hard to put runs on
the board and we're excited to play
at home."
All Stanford can do is look to the
clouds and hope the tarp can come
off.
Today's first pitch is scheduled for
5 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
