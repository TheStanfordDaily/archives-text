### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Only in the Pacific-10 Conference
could a team ranked eighth in the na
tional pre-season polls find itself
picked to finish fifth in its conference.
llie No. 8 Stanford women's soft
hall team will begin its 2007 season at
the Kajikawa Classic in Phoenix this
weekend. The Cardinal is set to play
four games in three days, starting Fri
day with matchups against Western
Michigan at 3:30 p.m. and Utah at
5:30 p.m.
"Western Michigan is a really
competitive team which finished sec
ond in their conference tourney last
year and just missed the NCAA tour
nament," said head coach John
Rittman, who is entering his eleventh
year with Stanford. "That's going to
be a great opening game for us to see
where we are as a team."
Western Michigan's strong of
fense is powered by last year's nation
al doubles champ, senior outfielder
Kristi Strange. Strange hit .340 with
23 doubles in 200b to lead the Bron
cos. Stanford is 2-1 all-time against
the Broncos but has not faced them
since the 2(K)3 season.
The Utes' strength lies in their
pitching tandem of Karina Cannon
and Meghan Deyer. Cannon finished
the 2006 season with a 20-8 record
while Deyer averaged 9.2 strikeouts
per game. The Cardinal holds an all
time advantage of 5-0 against Utah.
"Utah is a very talented team and
was in the postseason last year,"
Rittman said. "We're going to be

challenged from the first day of com
petition, and it's good to let the play
ers see where they are."
On Saturday, Stanford will face
two ranked opponents, including last
year's national runner-up. No. 4
Northwestern, at 11 a.m. and last
year's third-place finisher. No. 17
Texas, at 1 p.m.
"Day two is just outstanding when
you're talking about playing North
western and Texas," Rittman said.
Northwestern is coming off a 50-
win season with three returning
NFCA Ail-Americans, llie team's
pitching staff is led by senior Eileen
Canney, who capped the 2006 season
with 26 wins and a 1.20 ERA. The
Cardinal is 2-3 all-time against the
Wildcats but last won a 5-4 decision
against them at the Fort Worth Clas
sic in Fullerton, Calif., during the 2006
season.
Stanford will face Texas once
again at the Classic after losing to the
Longhorns 2-0 last season. Texas
boasted a 55-9 record last year and
finished third at the Women's Col
lege World Series. Texas' offense is
led by shortstop Desiree Williams,
who blasted 12 homeruns with a .333
average last season. Their defense is
anchored by senior catcher Megan
Willis, the liig-12 Defensive Player of
the Year. Stanfoid is 0-2 against Texas
all-time, with both losses coming last
season.
On Sunday, the Cardinal will fin
ish the Classic with an 11 a.m.
matchup against Northwestern State.

ranked eighth in the preseason poll
conducted by NCAA Division I head
coaches, Stanford women were se
lected to finish fifth in the perennial
ly strong Pac-10. However, Rittman
said that his team's focus is not on
preseason accolades.
"After the season gets going, the
only poll that matters is the final poll,
so we try not to get too caught up in
it," Rittman said. "It's still exciting to
know that enough people voting
think that highly of our program and
who we have."
