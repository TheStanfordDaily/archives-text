# Maddy Coon Through my eyes
## Scene-stealing slugger 
### BY DENIS GRIFFIN 
If there is no better sign for a team's fu
ture than the presence of young talent,
Stanford Softball is in good hands for
the next three years.
Sophomore Maddy Coon exploded onto
the scene last year and is back for more in
2007. Ille Cardinal infielder saw plenty of ac
tion as a true-freshman, starting in all 60 of
Stanford's regular season contests. But Coon
did more than just get her feet wet last season
as she led the team in home runs (nine). RBls
(40) and doubles (13). And for all you new
age stat-heads out there. Coon also posted
fantastic on-base and slugging percentages,
leading the team in both categories (.467
OBP. .584 SLG).
But Coon credits her teammates with
much of her success at the plate last season.
"Our team has always had a really good
lineup." Coon said. "And it was fun to be in
the middle of such a great group and be sur
rounded by such great hitters all around. We
all just play the roles [head coach John
Rittman] puts us in."
Rittman, though, was more than willing to
put most of Coon's success so far on her
shoulders.
"What makes Maddy a great hitter is her
tremendous bat speed and power," Rittman
said. "But she also understands hitting, and
she's able to make adjustments. That makes
her very effective. She has a little bit of a rep
utation — teams are very aware of her. She
was a very highly touted recruit."
Coon earned Second-Team All-Pacific-10
Conference honors last season and has been
named to the Top 50 Watch List, along with
senior teammate Jackie Rinehart.for the Na

tional Collegiate Player of the Year Award.
With all those accolades, some might wonder
just how high Coon can climb. Rittman has
no doubts about his sophomore slugger.
"She's only going to get better, and I think
that was evident last year in watching the
progress that she made from the beginning of
the season to the end of the season," Rittman
said."Maddy's biggest challenge is to be able
to take walks and recognize when people are
pitching around her. Obviously, at this level,
if you have a weakness, teams are going to
pick it up.They're scouting and they're going
to attack your weaknesses. Maddy's best at
tribute this year is she's made some of her
weaknesses better, and so she's going to be
that much tougher of an out."
Nevertheless, Coon also led the team in
walks with 32 in 2006.1 ler closest challenger
for that distinction on the Stanford squad
managed to draw 19. Given her power, on
base percentage and ability to play both
shortstop and third base, the well-rounded
nature of Coon's game may be the biggest
testament to her skills.
'i just want to go up and get a good pitch
and hit it hard," Coon said. "I like to hit for
average more than for power — my first goal
is just to get on base. On defense [Rittman]
has put me in a bunch of different places, so 1
would say my versatility for the team is my
biggest strength."
Despite her personal achievements. Coon
said her priorities this season centered
around fitting into the team on the whole.
"I just want to see us play well as a team
— as a cohesive unit together," she said.
"That's all I'm looking for. We need to play
hard. We've got a lot of talent,so we just need

to put it all out there on the field and not hold
anything back. 1 just want to help out. offen
sively, defensively, any way that I can."
That attitude, along with her tremendous
production, could thrust Coon into the spot
light this season and into a leadership role for
the highly touted Cardinal, ranked No. 8 in
the preseason polls. Rittman would not rule
out the possibility of Coon's rising to promi
nence in such a role despite her relative
youth.
"In our program, we expect everyone to
lead." Rittman said. "We don't name cap

tains. Certainly our upperclassmen are able
to be more natural leaders because they've
been in the system, but I have no doubt that
any one of our players, regardless of class,
could be a leader in our program."
Coon, who repeatedly said she couldn't
wait for the season to begin this weekend at
the Kajikawa Classic in Phoenix, sees bright
things in store for the Cardinal this year.
"It's a classy program; we've got a great
coach." Coon said. "Just the people I'm sur
rounded by are unbelievable, academically
as well as athletically. And our work ethic, I

feel, is unlike any other team's. As a team, we
have a lot of talent. Great lineup, great de
fense, great pitching this year and every
body's healthy."
"At the end of the year, I would want peo
ple to say that we were fun to watch," she
continued."That we played hard and hustled
and made things happen."
For Coon and the rest of the squad, the
chance to bring these hopes to fruition starts
this weekend.
