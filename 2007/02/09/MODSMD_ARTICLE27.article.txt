Inspired by her experience in her fall Intro

sions of Mortality, hut depressed by the course se
quence she took during winter and spring quar
ters. ( orina lacopetti '09 recently joined IS other
students on ;i newly formed 1111 JM student advi
sory board.
Ihe University is recruiting students like la
copetti to sit on student panels that offer feed
back on undergraduate programs like lIIIJM.
PWR and I Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (I JAR).
"The idea behind it is to make sure that stu
dents have a way o| sending ideas to the adminis
tration of 111 l VI mi addition to course evalua
tions.' said Dr. Phaedra Bell, the academic re
search program officer for lIH M
Sam Dubai '08. another member of the lIIIJM
student advisory board, cited a number of issues
the students would like to address.
"Our recommendations tend to reflect those
that we .ind other students have about lIIUM.
ranging from the disparity in the amounts of work
between courses to the potential overlap be

tween PWR and IHUM to misleading course de
scriptions put forth in the prospectus sent to in
coming students." Dubai said.
Ihe student panel worked with humanities
faculty to organize an open house in November
featuring winter-spring lIIUM courses and to de
sign an electronic questionnaire about the IHUM
experience.
lacopetti said the response to the question
naire was impressive, with almost one-third of
uppcrclassmcn responding last fall and '>()() of
them submitting individual responses.The sur
vey is part of an lIIUM self-study conducted by
the 111 l J M governance board. 011 which la
copetti also sits as one of two student represen
tatives.
As part of a Faculty-Senate mandate to review
111 l JM every four years, the study has sought crit
ical student and faculty feedback. While the find
ings will be released in a few weeks. Dr. Russell
Herman.director of IHUM and head of the gov
ernance board, said."it is premature to talk about
study findings themselves."
Aman Kumar'(W has been working with Lor
raine Sterritt. director of UAR. since he was a
freshman. I his year he joined the program's stu
dent advisory panel, whose main function is to

provide student perspectives on how to better
merge undergraduate advising and research.
"The advising system served us well, hut we
s;iw ways we could make it better" he said.speak
ing on behalf of the UAR student board.
One of the current plans to accomplish this
goal is a campaign to increase awareness for in
coming freshman with regard to major track re
quirements so they do not lose their first year as
an opportunity to take courses necessary for
graduation. Kumar said.
Because students are not always initially
paired with an advisor in their area of interest,
some miss out on crucial guidance for planning
their freshman year courses of study. Kumar also
noted the related effort to improve the student
advisor matching process.
While implementing changes can be ;i slow
process. Kumar finds faculty eager for student
feedback and. ultimately, has considerable faith
in the system.
"Programs designed with student feedback in
mind," he said, "are that much more likely to be
used bv them."
