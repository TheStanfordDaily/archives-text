## Senate approves new public policy master's Ethics panel talks about student stress 
### ADAM SOWLATI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Senate met Thursday
afternoon to approve the new Mas
ter's in public policy program and to
discuss ethical issues vital to the Uni
versity's mandate.
The Senate unanimously ap
proved the formation of a new public
policy Master's program for gradu
ate students already enrolled in an
other Stanford graduate degree pro
gram. Hie program will offer gradu
ate students either a two-year Mas
ter's in public policy (MPP) or a one
year Master of Arts in public policy
(MAPP).
Most faculty members were opti
mistic that the proposed program
would thrive. However, some ex
pressed reservations because the
program will not fully fund all its stu
dents. Others were worried that the
interdisciplinary program could po
tentially stretch the resources of
other academic departments.
Public policy director Bruce
Owen said the program will only en
roll 40 students in each class and will,
therefore, not be a burden on other
professors. I le added that it will be at
least five years before a coterminal
program in public policy will be of
fered, in part, he said,because the un
dergraduate program is more rigor
ous at Stanford than Master's pro
grams at many universities.
"[Our undergraduate program] is
even more rigorous than the

Woodrow Wilson School at Prince
ton," he said.
The meeting also featured an
ethics panel consisting of Rabbi Pa
tricia Karlin-Neumann, the adminis
trative dean of the Office for Reli
gious Life; Prof. David Magnus, di
rector of the Center for Biomedical
Ethics; Deborah Rhodes, professor
of law and director of the Stanford
Center on Ethics; and School of Ed
ucation Prof. Eamonn Callan.
The panel discussed the impor
tance of students' ethical knowledge,
the need for professors to involve
themselves more in students' lives
and the pressures students place on
themselves.
"Ethics is central to the intellectu
al mission of the University," Callan
said. "All the problems that consti
tute the Stanford Challenge have in
tellectually daunting ethical studies."
After expressing sympathy for
the students that have recently
passed away, Karlin-Neumann
warned that students must not let
their drive for academic success in
terfere with their well-being.
"Prodigious intellect does not
guard against sometimes tragic out
comes," she said. "Our students are
so accomplished that they have
rarely failed and live in fear of letting
people down."
She emphasized that professors
are sometimes the only adults in stu
dents' lives and therefore have a
unique responsibility to engage per
sonally with students.
"Professors," she said,"play a crit
ical role in student well-being."
