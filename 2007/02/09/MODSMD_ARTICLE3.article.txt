# Email scam snares students
## Scam artists masquerade as Bank of America in scheme to steal unknowing victims' identities 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Over the last week.Stanford chat lists have
been inundated with messages caution
ing students about a Bank of Ameri
ca scam that managed to make its
. way into many students' email inbox-
V es. But the warning came too late for a
few students who had already disclosed
private information to spammers.

A number of
Stanford students re
ceived a message with the
Bank of America logo that
indicated "irregular card
activity" in their accounts.
The email asked individuals
to verify their private infor
mation by clicking on a link
— a link that did not lead
to the official Bank of
America log-in page,
which has a secure log
in, but to a phony site

created by the
spammers.
Th e
Stanford Uni
versity Depart
ment of Public
Safety issued a

press release
Wednesday express-

ing concern over "a re
cent rash" of phishing at-

tacks — scams that collect
private information from un
suspecting email recipients. The

press release noted that six Stanford af
filiates have been known victims of identity

theft in the past year.
Email rackets are not a new phenomenon
at Stanford. Last year a fraudulent eßay mes
sage solicited credit card information from

students; a Stanford Federal Credit Union
scam and the same Bank of America scheme
have occurred repeatedly over the last few
years.
One junior was duped by the Bank of
America scam the summer after his freshman
year. After receiving the counterfeit email, he
typed his name and password into the link.
"1 found out that my Bank of America sav
ings account had been zeroed and the money
had been transferred to a Pay Pal account," he
said."l was very lucky, however, since Pay Pal
actually gave me back all of the money."
Some students who were potentially vic
tims of identity theft asked not to be identified
in this article due to privacy concerns.
I leather lleistand '08 (who is also a Staff
Writer at The Daily) said she immediately fell
for the scam.
"My purse was stolen two months ago," she
said."! was completely taken in by the scam
because I thought Bank of America was just
checking in to be sure everything was in order.
In fact. 1 had explicitly asked them to investi
gate, so that made the scam even more con-,
vincing."
The current phishing episode also fooled a
freshman who has since taken steps to protect
her identity by tiling a fraud alert with several
credit bureaus and canceling her Bank of
America account.
"As soon as 1 submitted the information, 1
knew something was wrong," she said in an
email to The Daily "! suddenly remembered
that Bank of America, or any other bank,
would not ask for such personal and private
information over email or phone call, so I
called Bank of America immediately and real
ized the huge mistake 1 had made in respond
ing."
She noted that many other people she
knew received the duplicitous email.
