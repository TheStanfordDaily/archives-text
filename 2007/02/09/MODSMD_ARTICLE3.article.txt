# Email scam snares students
## Scam artists masquerade as Bank of America in scheme to steal unknowing victims' identities 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Over the last week.Stanford chat lists have
been inundated with messages caution
ing students about a Bank of Ameri
ca scam that managed to make its
. way into many students' email inbox-
V es. But the warning came too late for a
few students who had already disclosed
private information to spammers.

A number of
Stanford students re
ceived a message with the
Bank of America logo that
indicated "irregular card
activity" in their accounts.
The email asked individuals
to verify their private infor
mation by clicking on a link
— a link that did not lead
to the official Bank of
America log-in page,
which has a secure log
in, but to a phony site

created by the
spammers.
Th e
Stanford Uni
versity Depart
ment of Public
Safety issued a

press release
Wednesday express-

ing concern over "a re
cent rash" of phishing at-

tacks — scams that collect
private information from un
suspecting email recipients. The

press release noted that six Stanford af
filiates have been known victims of identity

theft in the past year.
Email rackets are not a new phenomenon
at Stanford. Last year a fraudulent eßay mes
sage solicited credit card information from

students; a Stanford Federal Credit Union
scam and the same Bank of America scheme
have occurred repeatedly over the last few
years.
One junior was duped by the Bank of
America scam the summer after his freshman
year. After receiving the counterfeit email, he
typed his name and password into the link.
"1 found out that my Bank of America sav
ings account had been zeroed and the money
had been transferred to a Pay Pal account," he
said."l was very lucky, however, since Pay Pal
actually gave me back all of the money."
Some students who were potentially vic
tims of identity theft asked not to be identified
in this article due to privacy concerns.
I leather lleistand '08 (who is also a Staff
Writer at The Daily) said she immediately fell
for the scam.
"My purse was stolen two months ago," she
said."! was completely taken in by the scam
because I thought Bank of America was just
checking in to be sure everything was in order.
In fact. 1 had explicitly asked them to investi
gate, so that made the scam even more con-,
vincing."
The current phishing episode also fooled a
freshman who has since taken steps to protect
her identity by tiling a fraud alert with several
credit bureaus and canceling her Bank of
America account.
"As soon as 1 submitted the information, 1
knew something was wrong," she said in an
email to The Daily "! suddenly remembered
that Bank of America, or any other bank,
would not ask for such personal and private
information over email or phone call, so I
called Bank of America immediately and real
ized the huge mistake 1 had made in respond
ing."
She noted that many other people she
knew received the duplicitous email.

"This particular email affected
many students and staff on campus,"
she said."l personally know five other
students and a staff [member] who,
like me, responded to the email."
"Almost all my friends received
the email." she added. "Apparently
those who had Gmail accounts were
more fortunate in that Gmail auto
matically labeled the email as spam,
making it easier to identify it as
fraud. I hope Stanford takes steps
into protecting email accounts from
receiving spams such as this."
Suzanne Karpilovsky.a third year
graduate student in Fnglish who re
ceived the same email, said the mes
sage initially appeared legitimate.
"I thought it was from Bank of
America." she said."So. the first thing
I did was I went to the real Bank of
America Web site, and I checked my
account, and there was no change in
the account. I went back to the email
and clicked the link, and I saw that
when they asked for things like your
Social Security number, it was a
fraud."
William Ito '0 ( >. the Resident
Computer Consultant (RCC) in
Fresh man-Sophomore College
(I roSoCo). said that such scams are
particularly deceptive because they
look valid.
"II it feels fishy or you ever have
to enter private information, make
sure you actually are looking at the
Web site you think you are." he said.
"A lot of the phishing attacks trick
people into thinking they are on a
different legitimate site, such as
eßay, or. in this case. Bank of Ameri
ca. Thev collect personal informa
tion. emails, phone numbers and [in
the] worst case, credit card informa
tion and Social Security numbers."
Ito said it is difficult for Stanford's
spam filters to catch these well-cam
ouflaged scams.
"The filters are designed to catch
the things that are trying to sell you
things like Viagra." he said. "[Phish
ing attacks] that get sent out go out of
their wa\ to look as official as possi
ble. Thai's win banks always go out
of their way to say we will never ask
for youi personal information 011
their Web sites."
I Executive Director of IT Services
Bill Clebsch noted that Stanford's
spam filtering is aggressive com
pared to that of the non-Stanford
population, but that it is hard for the
University to immediately filter
against spam like the Bank of Amer
ica racket because such messages
look reasonable.
"We know that certain providers
do nothing but send spam," he said.

"We never even let (these messages]
get to the mail system."
But he conceded that it would he im
possible for the University to imple
ment a system that blocks email from
all non-trusted senders.
"In corporate Amei ica what they
basically do is, the\ say. If you're not
a trusted vendor we don't allow your
e-mails through,"' he said. "We can't
do that. We are the intellectual cen
ters of the world — we're trying to
promote collaboration. So we have
to [have] 100 times as many complex
rules."
IT Services Info Systems Project
Manager Nancy Ware said that this
technology will address virus con
cerns rather than identity theft issues.
"Say somebody had their laptop
swiped and they contracted some
kind of virus and they plugged their
laptop into the Stanford network."
she said. "The Departmental Fire
walls Project can quickly contain the
scope of that attack. In a student
area, you could contain it to a dorm
and protect everybody else."
She added that the University
does subscribe to services that help
to identify improperly formatted
emails that could be phishing at
tacks. The Department of Public
Safety's Web site (http://www.stanford.
edu/group/SUDPS/)offers a link with
suggestions for identity theft pre
vention with advice for victims.
In September 2006, the offices of
the president and provost funded the
Departmental Firewalls Project —
an IT Services plan for firewall im
plementation. Clebsch said that the
project will take a year or more to
complete.
"It's a large and significant project
to really protect Stanford much." he
said, "much more from viruses, from
worms, from email scams, from any
kind of attack from the outside and
from an attack from an inside pro
tected machine."
