### BETSY CONGDON BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION EDITORS

Joel Stein. If we haven't

I rubbed it in your face enough,
that is our theme this week. I think

Iwe have earned our membership
eards in the Joel Stein Cult. But serious-

I ly, wc admire him because he is the ulti-

Imate lovable dork who took his Stanford
gree and did something truly cool with it (he is on

"1 Love the 905," after all).
We also look up to him because we hope that we have
something of him in ourselves. He was Intermission Editor
way back when we had a prime office out in the newsroom
(and not the windowless closet that we currently occupy).
Like Brendan, he lived in Branner his freshman year, and, like
Betsy, he was on Branner staff asan upperclassman (asa Writ
ing Tutor).
Stanford Daily staffers go on to do big things. They write for
Time, The LA. Times, The Washington Post and The Wall
Street Journal, etc. You recognize their headlines and remem
ber when you were up until 7:30 a.m. with them. You wonder
what it is like to be an editor / writer, when being a student isn't
your main profession.
When Daily staffers come back, it's like in high school when
J^ormer^mk^Hs^m^ho^^u^

questions I
like, "What I

is it like in col- I
lege?" Here we are I
i • 1:1 I

asking questions like, ■
"How do you make it as a jour- I

nalist in the real world?" "What is I
the state of journalism today?"

Then there are the more mundane I
like when Joel Stein asked us, "Is Sports the only sec I

lion at The Daily now?" (He noticed that the front page was I
Sports today and was curious why).

Things change. It's just like when you go back to high school I
and it has suddenly become a closed campus. Condi isn't I
provost like she was back in Joel's days, hunger strikes haven't I
happened in awhile and, of course, the alcohol policy has I
changed (the grass is always greener on the other side, isn't it'.'). I
We all think that, somehow, the past is a better manifestation of I
now — people just don't protest like they used to.
What we realize is that this Stanford is just as good as. al- I
though maybe different from, the past one — can you imagine I
your college experience without the Internet? Someday, we will I
come back to The Daily office and talk about the days when wc I
would play T-Woods 2007 in our windowless closet.
The moral of the story is that you should come write for In-1
termission (intermission.daily@gmail.com). You could be the I
one who has a future working for Time and appearing as a n
talking head on VHL
