## Dorkalicious movies: Dig in nerds! 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION NERD MOVIE EXPERT 
The history of dorkalicious movies is as long as the history
of the usage of "dorkalicious' (i.e., deliciously dorkv — the
word seems to belong, of all things, to "The OC") is short.
And there have been so many such flicks, especially over the
past two decades or so. that even the most ardent nerd would
be unable to see them all. From the vast selection, a few stand
out. not necessarily for their acting, special-effects or writing,
but for their special place in the history of dorks and nerds
worldwide.
"The Lost World"
Essentially "Jurassic Park 11." A staple of late-night, 12-
year-old boy sleepovers everywhere. There's a lot to love in
this movie, especially the Tyrannosaurus rex romping around
San Diego. Jeff Goldblum spouts off chaos theory at random
intervals and declares that he's "a genius." "Jurassic Park"
might be for everyone, but only true connoisseurs of
Michael Crichton novels-turned-movies prefer the sequel.
"The Matrix Revolutions"
A film for only the truly devoted. While everyone pro
claimed himself a fan of the first "Matrix" flick, and some

people tolerated the second, the

third was almost a caricature of

itself, with the gratuitous

Christ imagery at the end

and the endless battle

scene. Only true

diehards could

bear to watch

this one more
than once.

there are plenty of

those out there —

the ones with the

scrolling green symbols as

their screensavers. The ones

who wear flowing dark trench
coats. Here's to you.

"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Bth Di- I
mension"
Yours truly may or may not have seen this movie in his ju- I
nior high Science Fiction Club, depending on what your def- I
inition of "have" is. It's hard to boil this movie down to any I
sort of summary, but you should know that Buckaroo Banzai I
is a neurosurgeon, rock star and samurai, and he's fighting I
Red Lectoids with the help of otherworldly allies with thick I
Jamaican accents. Jeff Goldbluin is in it, by the way, and if I
that isn't enough, well, 1 don't know what is. Chaos theory, I
damnit!
"The Fifth Element"
This movie is so bad it's good, or it's so good it's bad. I'm I
not really sure which. It's a classic of the genre, though I'm not I
really sure what the "genre" actually is. At times, this fine film I
seems like a more cheesy "Blade Runner." No Jeff Goldblum I
in this one, unfortunately, bui the cast does include Bruce I
Willis and Chris Tucker, the latter in a predictably annoying I
and high-pitched role. The part with the blue opera singer is I
particularly memorable, especially when her stomach ex- I
plodes. I've probably seen this movie four or five times, but I
I'm not sure why.
