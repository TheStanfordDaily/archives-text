# Borat: We like it more than Joel Stein did
## Sunday FLICKS 
### BRENDAN MARTEN WHITNEY SADO INTERMISSION KAZAKHSTANIS 
To a group of frat boys at the University of South Carolina, it's a publicity night
marc. To Pamela Anderson, it's grounds for a restraining order. And to a group of
rowdy rodeo-goers, it's a call to initiate mob violence. It's garnered multiple lawsuits
â€” as well as an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe award.
It might be called "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glori
ous Nation of Kazakhstan," but, to most students across the nation, it's just "Borat."
A creation of Sacha Baron Cohen (of "Da Ali G Show" fame), this weekend at Flicks
is your chance to catch the pop culture phenomenon of 2006 and see what all the buzz
is about.
Cohen plays a caricature of a backwards, racist, sexist and homophobic television re
porter from Kazakhstan who is traveling across the United States to document the great
ness of "the US-of-A" for his fellow countrymen. He pulls stunts ranging from releasing

a live chicken on a New York subway car to bringing his own feces to the table at an el
egant Southern dinner party. His efforts to produce the news report, however, quickly
transform into a mission to make Pamela Anderson his wife (since she's the "virgin" for
him) after seeing her on " Baywatch." And while the Americans with which Borat inter-

acts are shocked by his behavior, those in
the audience are equally shocked by their
often offensive responses.
While it's easy to imagine how a project
like this could start to lose steam after the
first few scenes, Cohen manages to keep
the comedic momentum and saves the
most outrageous for last. But, at the same
time, one might wonder whether the
inane antics are enough to justify a fea
ture-length film.
And then there are some who just won't
relate to Cohen's over-the-top and in
your-face style of comedy. After all, for
those who arc older, as columnist Joel
Stein notes in Time, "What exactly is
funny about being invited to nice people's
homes and handing them your feces?"
Fair point. But we, along with critics and
millions of young Americans, arc more
than willing to give Borat a "high-five."
