## CONFESSIONS OF A CAMPUS GEEK 
### 
Every student eventually assimilates into the geeky culture
that characterizes Stanford. Often it is said that every one of us
has some "geek" in him or her — we all made it here, after all.
So it is surprising, even shocking, when a geeky Stanford stu
dent sticks out like a sore thumb: the geek of the geeks.
The following is my experience with this race of über
geeks, the unfortunate men and women on campus who must
be planning to take over the world (or at least doing something
cool, to justify their socially unacceptable behavior).

' My very inspiration for

writing about campus geek

I sightings nearly walked into

I me as 1 was leaving The

Daily office one evening. A plain Jane, walking briskly

down the sidewalk barreled past me with reckless
abandon. 1 spun around, expecting an apology, but
was left in the dust as I watched her tear down the j
road, Jan Sport backpack strapped high on her back.
Suddenly, I noticed something 1 had overlooked: a

light shining faintly down in front of her. Not to light
her path but to illuminate the pages of her classic

novel. My eyes almost popped out. GEEK!

Now 1 don't mean to come off as a high school bully

or something, but it is hardly acceptable to read while

walking during the daylight hours, let alone acquire

a mini hand-held flashlight just to read while

walking at night. Walking at night at is also

risky business. Drivers can hardly handle

all the stop signs, let alone be vigi-

lant for cruising bookworms.
A second geek-spotting oc-

curred a few days later while a

few of my friends and I were talk-

ing up Stanford to a visiting Pro Fro

. and her dad. "The people are what have

really made my time here so awesome," ex
plained my friend. Out of nowhere, an ine
briated group of minstrels rolled by and

began to sing. "Drunken a cappella is actually one of the I

most popular activities at Stanford..." my friend said

lamely, trying to laugh it off. Shamed, my friends and

I apologized profusely for our classmates' behavior, I
' swearing that not all Stanfordians are that geeky.

My final geek encounter was, I nuist I

admit, highly unexpected. After eating lunch and
playing Smash Bros, at my fraternity of choice, I

sauntered down to my religious studies class. I'd re- I

cently broken my right index finger in a ski accident '
and the awkward, oversized splint the doctor had

given me was impairing my ability to carry .

and realized I was already five minutes late. I

my laptop, Jamba Juice and course read- I

er all at once. I checked the time on mv

defaced cell phone (by defaced I mean
that I tried to bejewel it, but the jewels I

fell off and all is left is super-glue residue) I

"1 don't want my teacher to think I'm a slack- I

er," 1 thought, as 1 quickened my pace. Hurrying
up the stairs two at a time, I couldn't balance my

Q self any longer. 1 stumbled on a step, my Jamba
went Hying and that's when 1 realized that (eek!) 1

was a geek among geeks. Apparently, it can happen I

to anyone.
