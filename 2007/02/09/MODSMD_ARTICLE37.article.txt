### CLAIRE ROSCOW BILL LOUNDY INTERMISSION V-EXPERTS 
If you've been wondering why Tresidder Express has been
sold out of hand mirrors recently, it's because of what's heating up
Annenberg Auditorium. You guessed it — vaginas of the world
rejoice! Stanford's rendition of "The Vagina Monologues," Eve
Enslcr's national phenomenon, is everything it's talked up to be
and so much more. 0000 ohhh OHM HHHH so much more. This
provocative and daring new performance stretches the mind and
explodes with excitement from the start — like some unfortunate
men.
Naturally, guys and gals will have entirely different reactions
to the monologues. Guys might (and probably should) have a
tough time comprehending the intricacies of TVM. (B\ the way,
don't think we abbreviate because we're afraid to say the word.
Vagina, vagina. VACiINA! It's really no big deal — trust us,
we're experts). Perhaps the simplest way to characterize the per
formance is like this: Imagine the exact opposite of a sausage fest.
Mix in feminism and a dash of emotion. Finally, drench the whole
concoction in estrogen. If you can figure out how to work the
oven, bake on scorching HIGH heat and you have the essence of
"The Vagina Monologues."
Make no mistake about it.the play was designed by and for
women. This is not to say that curious and relationship savvy men

(ana vvno isn i:) snouid steer clear. As a matter ot tact, men
should see it in their own best interest. Any guy who claims to know all the 'ins and outs' of the
vertical smile' is lying to himself. After all, if a woman has to take a personal journey to un
derstand her own coochi snorcher. then men really need to do some intense investigating if they
hope to have a shot.

Let's get to the point. Vaginas are socially taboo. They just are.
Thankfully, everything about "The Vagina Monologues" screams the
opposite. Of course, the vagina symbolizes much more than a physical
organ; it represents womanhood and femininity. Getting to know your
vagina means getting to know yourself. Emotional and physical sexu
al abuse rob women everywhere of sexual identity, which is a signifi
cant part of personhood. Though "The Vagina Monologues" is enter
taining, it offers an underlying message that women truly need to de
velop a personal relationship with their vaginas. Vaginas deserve re
spect.
