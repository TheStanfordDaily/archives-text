# Gems from Joel "down with the aphorisms" Stein
## 
### 
On pushing his editors' limits: "You can't walk the line if
you don't know where it is."
On parental affection: '"Every parent wants their kid to
go to raed school. If they don't, that's their way of say
ing they don't love you."
On how he channels his creative drive: "All writing
is deadline based. Whether self-imposed or real."
On why he will eventually shave his balding
head: "You've got to fire them before they
quit."
On being a pushover: "I feel the need to email everybody
[who emails me] back. I just wish 1 wouldn't get the emails."
On current fashion trends: "The cell phone is the new pocket watch."
On pleasure: "You can't really masturbate with your friends in the
room."
On his basic life philosophy: "I'll do anything for tree.'
