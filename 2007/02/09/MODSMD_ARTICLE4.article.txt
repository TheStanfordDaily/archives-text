# ROAD TO A DOLLIE DREAM
## Audition, selection process underway 
### LAURA CHANG 
Sorry. MTV lovers, but last week's first Dollie audition
workshop was hardly the catty scene one might expect
from a girls' dance competition. True, a competitive spirit
hung in the air— representing one of Stanford's classiest
traditions is quite the prize, after all — but the girls seemed
surprisingly composed in light of the long audition process
to come. Just seven minutes into the hour, about 20 girls
were already on their nimble feet, comfortably swaying
their heads and hips as if they had done the warm-up a
thousand times before.
The Dollies, a group of five girls who accompany the
Band with choreographed dances at athletic events and
rallies, are a long-standing tradition in Stanford history.

Each group is selected in February and has 10 weeks to
learn 10 dances before beginning its yearlong term. During
the first weekend of May, the new Dollies, numbered one
through live in order of height, are unveiled in the "Dollie
Splash."
"The audition process is low-pressure, supportive and. as
I remember it. a lot of fun," recalled current Dollie #4. Lau
ren Smith *09. "I'm still friends with some of the girls 1 met
through Dollie auditions."
According to Dollie #2. Amy Kurzweil '09, the audition
process is not simply a means to an end, but "an experience
in itself."
