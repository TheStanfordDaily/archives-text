# ROAD TO A DOLLIE DREAM
## Audition, selection process underway 
### LAURA CHANG 
Sorry. MTV lovers, but last week's first Dollie audition
workshop was hardly the catty scene one might expect
from a girls' dance competition. True, a competitive spirit
hung in the air— representing one of Stanford's classiest
traditions is quite the prize, after all — but the girls seemed
surprisingly composed in light of the long audition process
to come. Just seven minutes into the hour, about 20 girls
were already on their nimble feet, comfortably swaying
their heads and hips as if they had done the warm-up a
thousand times before.
The Dollies, a group of five girls who accompany the
Band with choreographed dances at athletic events and
rallies, are a long-standing tradition in Stanford history.

Each group is selected in February and has 10 weeks to
learn 10 dances before beginning its yearlong term. During
the first weekend of May, the new Dollies, numbered one
through live in order of height, are unveiled in the "Dollie
Splash."
"The audition process is low-pressure, supportive and. as
I remember it. a lot of fun," recalled current Dollie #4. Lau
ren Smith *09. "I'm still friends with some of the girls 1 met
through Dollie auditions."
According to Dollie #2. Amy Kurzweil '09, the audition
process is not simply a means to an end, but "an experience
in itself."
With the help of six workshops, Kurzweil explained.
Prospective Dollies (Pro Dos) must ultimately perform three
dances — one of which is self-choreographed — in front of
an audience of former Dollies and Band members.
Although about 40 girls initially expressed interest.
Kurzweil estimated that the field will be cut in half before the
first audition because Pro Dos realize the huge commitment
involved.
The first audition assesses Pro Dos' dance abilities. The 10
or so who make it past the first cut to the second audition face
a true test of mental focus — by this stage, Pro Dos must be
prepared to dance in front of the entire Band, whose rowdi
ness closely mimics the atmosphere of an athletic event.
"We want them to smile, exude excitement and show per
formance quality." Kurzweil said.
The eight who make it past the second audition are invited
to interview with Band members so they can get a sense of the
Pro Dos' personality.
"The key." divulged Kurzweil. "is to stay cool and keep
smiling."
'ITie Band, after all, is an integral part of the Dollie experi
ence. At last week's Dollie Information Session, the Band
stormed the meeting in full chaotic procession, as if to dare
anyone to leave such a brilliant Dollie dream behind.
Smith said that how the final five are chosen after the in
terviews is a big secret, and that she isn't even sure exactly
how it happens.
"As far as picking Dollies, the five of us [current Dollies]
have nothing to do with it." said Brittiany Broadwater '09,
Dollie #1.
According to Kurzweil, all the former Dollies and Band
members have an equal say.
"In the end they come to have similar ideas about what
they want," she said. "It's usually clear, but sometimes they
argue into the night."
Being a good dancer and having spirit aren't the only fac
tors that matter.
"We are looking for five girls who are going to work well
together, so. rather, we are looking at the whole individual."
she said. "It is not only important that we find five girls who
are going to perform well together, but girls that will be com
mitted and responsible in representing [The Band] and the
University."
Although the multi-stage audition process and the band's
scrutiny may appear intense, Broadwater assured the girls

that "we're there to help you do well. If you're supposed to do
a double pirouette, but can only manage a single, that's fine."
Most of the competition's intensity, she believes, comes not
from the other girls or current Dollies, but from the pressure
Pro Dos put on themselves.
Molly Pam 10 admitted pre-workshop that she was a bit
nervous.
"It's one of those things, though, where I'll regret it if 1
don't do it," she said. Having grown up locally, she has
watched the Dollies perform ever since she was little and says
she would treasure the chance to live out one of her childhood
fantasies.
In regards to those who. like Pam, are a bit anxious about
the coming auditions, it is easy to understand how a girl could
take the process very seriously. For the talented five who
make it past final cuts on Sunday, Feb. 18, the year ahead as a

Dollie could possibly he"the highlight of [her] Stanford ca
reer," as it was for Annemarie Estess '09, Dollie #3. In her
eyes, "performing is one of the best things in the world. The
rush is just incredible."
For Broadwater, too, the Dollie experience has far exceed
ed her initial expectations.
"These are some of the greatest people I've ever met." she
said. "When I come back to my reunion, these are the first
people 1 will call."
Lovely red and white costumes and free makeup aside, the
biggest perk seems to be making four unexpected and incred
ibly close friends.
"There's no coach for Dollies," said Abby Williams '09,
Dollie #5. "It's just the five of you."
