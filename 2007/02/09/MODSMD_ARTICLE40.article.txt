## Lily Allen: Give 'era try, love 
### BRENDAN SELBY INTERMISSION ANGLOPHILE 
Pity ihe poor Cockney lass. As Lily Allen tells it, she spends her days scooting around

London on her bike (because "the filth" took away her license), trying to think of

ways to get back at her cloying ex-boyfriend and avoiding the unwanted advances
of the chavs at the local pub.
Except that Allen, the talented 21-year-old British singer, has been exposed by I
the British press as no Cockney at all. Apparently she's a "Mockney," or an upper

class Brit who goes slumming to build a rep on the street.
But such distinctions are of little value to the American listener of her album
"Alright, Still" (2006). Not to do injustice to that sizable group of East Londoners
who, tragically, are incapable of pronouncing the letter "h," but as far as Allen is con
cerned. all that matters is that the album is mostly great fun, both droll and
catchy.
Her dominant persona is a bratty, world-weary girl whose interests
are limited to relationships, family, wandering around and hitting the
club. As such, she is walking on territory already covered by The
Streets, the group to which she is most often (and appropriately)
compared. Basically, despite the predictable hype about "girl
power," all that sass and attitude seems to arise more from stan
dard-issue middle-class boredom.
To my mind. "Alright, Still" is best viewed as British comedy
packaged together with some great beats and choruses.
When a creep asks for her number at the bar in the track
"Knock 'Em Out," Allen replies, with perfect nonchalance: "No, not
in a million years, you're nasty, please leave me alone." As if this were

not enough, she invents a series of excuses, such as being pregnant and having herpes.
The songs are essentially straight-up pop, with traces of influence from ska and reg
gae. On several tracks, including "Smile" (the album's hit single). Allen is backed up by
a mellow horn section.
"Alright, Still" has been out in Europe for months, and "Smile" in particular is
no well-kept secret. My roommate who spent last summer in Sicily tells me the
t song was second in popularity to no less than Paris Hilton on the local radio.
Nonetheless, Allen's lyrics can make a fairly traditional (but always
well-constructed) track sound subversive. She is at her best in songs that take
advantage of this contrast. "LDN," about wandering around London, starts off
with a silly, mariachi-style trumpet solo as Allen sings in her cheeriest voice,
"Everything seems to look as it should / But 1 wonder what goes on behind
doors / A fella looking dapper, but he's sitting with a slapper / Then 1 see
it's a pimp and his crack whore."
Like most comedy, however, you can only return to it so many
times before it starts to lose its flavor. 1 have only listened it
a few times, but already some of the songs are getting on
my nerves, such as "Alfie," where she scolds her pot
smoking younger brother, and "Nan You're A Win
dow Shopper," where she tosses off some pre
dictable old-person jokes about bingo and
colostomy bags. (The latter is a bonus track on the
U.S. version of the album.)
Overall, it's great music to play with friends to show
off your witty, slightly subversive side. But not the kind of music you
would listen to alone, on your iPod, for the 200 th time.
