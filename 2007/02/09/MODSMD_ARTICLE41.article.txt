### ANDREW HUNG INTERMISSION DORK 
Dorks run rampant

on this lovely campus of ours. They are truly/
everywhere — in every math lecture, behindtl
every lab bench, under every bicycle helmet/
Just because they are united under one label I
because of their dedication toward the noblest \
of intellectual pursuits (and awkwardness in
the most ordinary of social situations), does not
mean that they are all the same. Dorks, like
normal people (and ice cream), come in all
shapes, sizes and flavors, too. Naturally, that
means that even dorks will tend to have varying
music tastes among themselves. However, I am
assured that the sheer diversity in this playlist
will provide something to enjoy for every dork.
For all of you out there in the lab or the library
on a Saturday night, creating the next break
through in collective human knowledge — I
salute you.
