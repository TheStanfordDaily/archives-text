# We built this Dork rock 'n' roll
## 
### ANDREW HUNG INTERMISSION DORK 
Dorks run rampant

on this lovely campus of ours. They are truly/
everywhere — in every math lecture, behindtl
every lab bench, under every bicycle helmet/
Just because they are united under one label I
because of their dedication toward the noblest \
of intellectual pursuits (and awkwardness in
the most ordinary of social situations), does not
mean that they are all the same. Dorks, like
normal people (and ice cream), come in all
shapes, sizes and flavors, too. Naturally, that
means that even dorks will tend to have varying
music tastes among themselves. However, I am
assured that the sheer diversity in this playlist
will provide something to enjoy for every dork.
For all of you out there in the lab or the library
on a Saturday night, creating the next break
through in collective human knowledge — I
salute you.
1. "Loser," by Beck, off the album "Mellow
Gold" (1994)
Pretty much the most prominent of the
wildly popular slacker anthems of the 19905,
"Loser" is crammed full of mumbo-jumbo
lyrics in between hypnotic repetitions of "Soy

selves in an airport realizing that all they have ,
to show for their hard work is "a new com
puter and a bright future in sales?" The band
is metaphorically speaking, of course —
there are plenty of undesirable careers be
sides being traveling salesmen.
6. "In the Garage," by Weezer, off the album
"Weezer (Blue Album)" (1994)
To all the Weezer fanboys and fangirls out
there: Face it. Rivers,Cuomo is a huge dork.
And it's not just beca/use of his dorky glasses
or abject absence of stage presence. The au
tobiographical song "In the Garage" pro
vides some insight — with references to idol
izing KISS, fawning over X-Men characters
(Nightcrawler and Kitty Pride) and playing
Dungeons and Dragons, it's the perfect ex
planation to where his awkwardness comes
from. Dorks everywhere: Celebrate that
there is a bona fide rock star in your ranks.
7. "The Nature of Empirical Truth," by We
Are Scientists, off the album "Bitchin"' (2002)

The three members of We Are Scientists
look like they went into their parents' base
ments (or Ukrainian nuclear physics labora
tories) in the '70s and just recently resurfaced.
It's no coincidence their band name is appro
priately dorky — when trying to rent a U-
Haul van to tour, they were asked in which
line of science they worked, and that conver
sation struck them hard enough to inspire
their band name. There is much for any dork
to learn from this song: The band dispenses
indispensible advice such as, "There's noth
ing Velcro can't do" and "You won't find
tacos or cats on Mars."
8. "The Elements," by Tom Lehrer, off the
album "An Evening Wasted with Tom
Lehrer"(l9s9)
This is it. The epitome. One dorky anthem
to rule them all. All the chemical elements
• listed off one by one to an incredibly catchy
tune (Sullivan's "Major General's Song," for
those of you that care that much). Although
dork purists will object to the fact that only
the elements up to number 102 (nobelium)
are listed, it is absolutely undeniable that this
is the most revered song in the hallowed halls
where any dorks reside.
