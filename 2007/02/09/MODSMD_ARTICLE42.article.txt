## Hollywood's finest: Who knew? (We did...) 
### LAUREN OTERO INTERMISSION CELEBRITY 
When a celebrity readies a certain level of fame, he sudden
ly becomes alluring to us common folk. Take Adrien Brody. His
lose, his hair and his gangly physique hardly resemble the Hol
ywood ideal. Yet he has donned the covers of entertainment
magazines, has dated beautiful women, has high-end designers
dressing him in couture suits and has Hollywood producers
vying for him. Why is it that the Adrien Brodys walking among
us can't cut the same deal? Why is it that an equally crooked
schnoz is considered in need of rhinoplasty when placed on your
average Joe Schmo? There are a number of celebri ties who man
age to capture women and men alike despite their atypical —
one might say — "geeky"appearance. Let's take a look at some
of Hollywood's finest dorks and examine what really makes
them so appealing.
Elijah Wood: He started out as a child actor, winning over a
younger generation of women. At the tender age of eight he
began his career in "Back to the Future Part II" (1989). Soon

after he appeared in countless films, most notably as a hobbit in
"The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Had Wood discontinued his
film career, he would have grown into a pale, pixie of a man with
a forgettable claim-to-fame. Instead, he be
came a lovable gap-toothed hobbit with man
hair 011 his feet. He may not be an A-list
celebrity, but let's face it. who can resist a
hobbit?
Jon Heder. Jon Heder broke out in the un
expected 2004 hit "Napoleon Dynamite."
The film quickly acquired a cult following
ranging from prepubescent tweens to your
best friend's mom. He is destined to live the
remainder of his career as Napoleon Dyna
mite. As a consolation, he'll have a select fe
male following to hand over the Chap Stick
when necessary and boost his confidence
along the way.
Robin Williams: This one's for the over-40
crowd. He is incredibly talented, hairy and per
verted. The

combination
of the three
blended with
Williams'
comedic ge
nius spell attractive to your equally
unattractive middle-aged mama.
He has that sparkle in his eye that
can be inteipreted as tender affec-

tion and genuine emotion when applied to films like "Patch Adams"
or simply perversion as displayed in his one-man comedy routine.
David Arquette: As the bumbling Deputy Dewey in
"Scream" (19%) he didn't do much for
the 13-and-up crowd. It was not until
the quirky actor began dating Court
ney Cox that his graphic design button
ups. mismatched polyester pantsuits
and matted hair suddenly became a
trademark look. Naming his firstborn
Coco, Arquette made an irresistible
move by showing his unfettered devo
tion to children's sugared cereals and
ensuring his daughter's misery
throughout the sandbox-ridden years
of her childhood.
Tobey Maguire: Tobey Maguire is Spidey.
For those of us who were not raised on
comics, Maguire represents our vision of
"Spider-Man" as captured by Hollywood.
He buffed up to play the role and managed
to fill out his spandex onesic. Though
Maguire is not conventionally handsome,
his superhero role increases his appeal.
With a third Spider-Man movie on the
way, he is bound to garner more female

fans.
