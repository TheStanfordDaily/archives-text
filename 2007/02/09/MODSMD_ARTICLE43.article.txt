# MIYARE: IT'S HIP, AND THE SUSHI'S CHEAP
## 
### DANA TURKER INTERMISSION SUSHI CHEF 
Every time I pass down University Avenue on a Friday or
Saturday night, I see a long line outside of Miyake Sushi (it
turns out that after 7 p.m., it is the place to be if you are over 21
and want a sake bomb). And every time I see this line, I tell my
self that I am going to eat there the next time I make it to Palo
Alto. And finally, 1 made it.
I he first thing that caught my eye when I entered Miyake
was the impressive sushi bar; the different types of sushi of
fered are placed in little boats that rotate around the counter
for customers to see. This works as a grab and eat (vpe situa
tion, so if you are really hungry and lucky enough to see what
you want, you don't even have to wait a minute to get your lix.
However, if you choose to order off of the menu (which offers
both sushi and real meals), the food doesn't lake long at all
(only about 10 minutes). Not only was the service speedy, but
the waiters were actually quite funn\ and friendly. (One wait
er even convinced us that they really didn't have any spoons in
the entire restaurant.)
I he menu options are plentiful, especially for a person
(like me) who does not eat raw fish but
enjovs sushi. There

were over 25 vegetarian rolls (yes, I am serious), and the best
part is that each vegetable roll (which comes with 6 pieces)
only costs $ 1.65 (which means you could get 30 pieces of sushi
for under $10)! Seeing the great prices, I became a bit suspi
cious of the quality — nothing in Palo Alto is usually that
cheap.
However, my Kappa roll, carrot roll and chicken
tcriyaki roll were all delicious. The chicken was hot
and smothered in a delicious tcriyaki sauce -1 was en
joying it so much that 1 didn't even realize the mess 1
was making with my rice. Now, as 1 said, I am not a
seafood fan. so 1 cannot vouch for the quality of the
seafood rolls. But my friend, who had the shrimp tern
pura roll, devoured it and said it was some of the best
sushi she had ever had. Even if the seafood rolls are
not as fresh or tasty as the vegetable and chicken rolls
1 tried, the prices at Miyake arc too low to say no.
The best bang for the buck, though.
is not the sushi rolls but the Obento
dinner special my friend ordered,
which comes with chicken tcriyaki,
salmon tcriyaki, vegetable tempura, rice,
cdamamc, soup and salad for only $9.95.
(This must be what Japanese Thanksgiving
would be like.) The fried vegetable tempura was
crunchy and delectable, a little less healthy than the other
items but definitely worth it. The miso soup was very fresh
also (but then again, I'm comparing it to the dining hall's so
called "miso soup"). The only thing not so great was the salad,
which came with an interesting peanut dressing. But still, it was

decent. The presentation of this Obento dinner was also quite
nice. It came in a big box divided into four sections (one for the ■
chicken, one for the salmon, one for the edamame and one for I
the fried tempura). Stylish! ®
It was a nice feeling to finally
in |
downtown Palo Alto
that served good food ■
for an extremely low I
cost. In addition, Miyake ®
is one of the
closest restaurants to Stan- |
w ford on Universit\ Drive,
and for a car-less person like ■
me. that's another huge plus. II I
you are over 21, 1 would suggest ®
going cm the weekend and seeing what all the sake-oriented hype
is about, but if you aren't, then take a break from studying and go I
on a weeknight! Ii will be a quick trip and your stomach will thank I
you.
