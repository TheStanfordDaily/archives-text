"doing," pleasure.
Spanking
Don't get her wrong, Roxy is not talking about whips and
chains. Unless you're into that â€” in which case you've proba
bly had the extraordinary fortune to have hooked up with her.
Remind her of your name, please?
But anyway, there's a kind of spanking for everyone, from
bondage to a couple of friendly smacks to the tushy. Hardcore
bondage implies a rigid dominant/submissive relationship and
usually requires a lot of leather and metal equipment, while
spanking can be done spontaneously whenever someone is in
the mood. Use the open hand or a flat object and be sure to
mix spanks with rubbing to ease sore areas. And/or extremely
aroused areas.
Role-Playing
No, Roxy is not talking about WoW. Closely related to spank
ing is the kinky fetish of role-playing. In a spanking situation, ex
amples
are father/daughter,
mother/son, or head
master/student. A lot of
frat party themes dabble
into role-playing, and
often the Catholic
schoolgirl or French
maid roles are exalted to
the level of ultimate
turn-on.

I
Role-play is an
effective way to
change up sex be- j
cause, by pretend
ing to be someone
else, you'll probably
feel more comfortable
expressing desires that
might otherwise seem taboo.
You can go anywhere with this,
and if you have costumes, great, but
you can also just use your imagination. Make any fantasy
- come true.
Change of Setting
This can mean almost anything. Instead of (or in addition
to) having sex at night, do it the next morning. Instead of
going at it facc to face, turn around once in a while. And
Roxy really, desperately wants you to have sex outside of
your dorm room!
Not only does it halt the awkwardness of having to sexile
your roommate and stifle your orgasmic screams, but a change
o( setting can really spice up sex. You'll practically be forced
to try new positions, as a car seat or an office chair might not
work so well for what you, well, always do. Also, depending on
where you go, the thrill underlying the risk of getting caught
could send you and your partner to new heights.
Don't be shy about getting what you want. Spanking, role- j
playing and changing the setting can either be done with
someone you trust enough not to tell anyone about your kinky
desires, or with someone you never have to see again. Take
your pick! Selectively employ these techniques, Roxy says,
and soon you'll be having the kind of sex everyone dreams of
having. Especially the geeks.
