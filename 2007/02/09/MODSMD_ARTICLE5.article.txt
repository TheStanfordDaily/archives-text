Joel Stein '93 is a narcissist. But if I were any
thing like him. I 'd he obsessed with myself too.
It's unlikely that any past Daily columnist has
fashioned iiis Stanford soap box into a bona
fide fortress quite the way Stein has. And if
someone else has. chances are he isn't as cute.
In the 14 years since he graduated. Joel has
written for more publications than the aver
age person picks up in a lifetime, including En
tertainment Weekly, Time and the L.A.Times
(where he currently writes a weekly column).
If you haven't read his stuff, you've probably

seen him on TV as one of those talking heads
waxing nostalgic on VHl's "I Love the <SOs"
and some of those other shows you watch
when nothing better is on.
I've always been a fan of Joel, so when I
found out he was coming to campus this week,
I wrote him an email asking for an interview.
I'd like to say my email was poised and profes
sional. but. in retrospect, it read more like one
of those gushy fan letters you wrote to
Jonathon Taylor Thomas in sth grade after
you stumbled on his address inTigerÃŸeat.
But unlike J IT, Joel Stein wrote back.
