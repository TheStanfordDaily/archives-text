Joel Stein '93 is a narcissist. But if I were any
thing like him. I 'd he obsessed with myself too.
It's unlikely that any past Daily columnist has
fashioned iiis Stanford soap box into a bona
fide fortress quite the way Stein has. And if
someone else has. chances are he isn't as cute.
In the 14 years since he graduated. Joel has
written for more publications than the aver
age person picks up in a lifetime, including En
tertainment Weekly, Time and the L.A.Times
(where he currently writes a weekly column).
If you haven't read his stuff, you've probably

seen him on TV as one of those talking heads
waxing nostalgic on VHl's "I Love the <SOs"
and some of those other shows you watch
when nothing better is on.
I've always been a fan of Joel, so when I
found out he was coming to campus this week,
I wrote him an email asking for an interview.
I'd like to say my email was poised and profes
sional. but. in retrospect, it read more like one
of those gushy fan letters you wrote to
Jonathon Taylor Thomas in sth grade after
you stumbled on his address inTigerßeat.
But unlike J IT, Joel Stein wrote back.

Stein smiles for the first time while back at The Daily after receiving his
long-awaited columnist royalty check.
I'm not sure what I expected Joel to be
like in person. Smug? Unpleasant? Only
capable of speaking in 20-second incre
ments about why he loves the 80s?
After meeting with Joel in his hotel (it's
not what you think — he's happily mar
ried, ladies), taking him to class and fi
nally interviewing him in Branner, where
he lived his freshman and senior years (as
a Writing Tutor. Sketch.), I think I've fig
ured out his secret weapon: he's actually
a genuinely nice guy. Or a really good
actor.
For someone who claims that quality
humor hinges upon judging people
rather than listening to them, he's sur
prisingly accessible. So much so that I
found myself talking to him about ear
wax and the tennis lessons my mom
made me go to in 4th grade. Horrifying.

Joel is charmingly self-deprecating in
the way only someone with a healthy
self-esteem (read: a beautiful wife who
shops at Anthropologic) can be. Any
straight man who drives a Mini Cooper
has to have some confidence.
Though he has a MySpace — and you
wonder why you have so many 16-year
old admirers, Joel — and he pseudo-runs
his own fan website, f/iqoelstein.com, he
still refuses to believe that people actual
ly want to read aboyt him. In fact, he is
probably shaking his head in disbelief as
he reads this, horrified that we devoted
so many pages to him. See, Joel? I wasn't
just pretending to work at The Daily to
spend time with you.
What surprised me most, though, is
how remarkably real Joel Stein is. When
I took him to an English class taught by a
professor he once had, he was nervous.
I'm pretty sure he hated me for a mo
ment when he realized I was one of those
kids who doesn't like to hide in the back
row of class. But by the time the class was
over, he was energized, utterly impressed

by the same professor who had taught
him years prior.
Sure, Joei padded around Martha
Stewart's TV-kitchen in sanitary booties
when he wrote for her show — she anal
ly required it of all employees. And, yes,
he's toured the Playboy grotto and
knows that Hugh Hefner spends his days
whittling away the hours with his garden
er and zookeeper, not having sex with
wimen whose breasts are larger than
their heads. But he's still tickled to pieces
by the simplest things. Like the fact that I
was wearing a watch — according to him
a very "20th century thing." And that
there are now so many students here who
ride skateboards and even more who are
well-dressed and (appear to be) show
ered. I get this feeling Joel wishes he were
back at Stanford just so he could glide
around campus on a skateboard in his
bright orange Nikes, so fresh and so
clean.
Don't get me wrong, Joel has definite
ly moved up the ranks since his heyday as
a Daily columnist and editor. But I get

the feeling that he hasn't really changed
that much. While he's constantly getting
calls from snazzy people on his snazzy,
21st century, multi-functioning cell
phone, he still peppers his speech with
"like"sand "uh"s. And even a
"douchebag" here or there. What's
more, when I met him for our interview,
he was chatting animatedly with his dad
on the phone. For the record, I didn't
hear him call his father a douchebag.
Once again, I'd like to say that I re
mained poised and professional during
our interview(s). But I didn't. I giggled
more than a sth grader in Sex Ed. There
goes my dream of being Barbara Wal
ters. If I'm lucky, I might still be able to
wrangle an appearance as a talking head
on "I love the 2000s."
At one point during our interview, Joel
said: "Don't meet your heroes and crush
es. That's my advice. You've projected so
much on them and they can't live up to
it."
I'm still glad I met you, Joel Stein ...
even if you are going bald.
