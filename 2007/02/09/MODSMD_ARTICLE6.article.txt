Movimiento Pstudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MPChA), the
Black Student Union (BSD) ;md the NAACP — in which
Abrica and Samuels talked about their strategy to respond to
the increase in gang-related violence. From Jan. 1 to Jan. 22.
the city lias seen three homicides and 15 shootings.
"In the last two weeks, we have made 25 arrests, done
three search warrants where we have recovered numerous
guns, done 13 parole searches and IK probation searches,"
Samuels s;iid. "And in a week we did 137 field contacts, iden
tifying each person."
Samuels added that assaults are down 60 percent from
2005, but she asked the community for help.
"More guns are out there than there are people. It is a way
of life, and that is what we are combating." she said."but it is
going to require collaboration and cooperation."
Iliis past Monday, Abrica and other City Council mem
bers held a meeting with parents and some of Past Palo
Alto's youth. I le declared that the objective of such meetings
was to appeal to different communities within the city to or
ganize and eventually work together.
On Saturday, more than 1.2(H) people marched from Past
Palo Alto's Home Depot to a local park as a way to protest
the surge in violence. Ihe large turnout, according to
Samuels, is an indicator of the community's desire to elimi-
nate violence.
Abrica and Samuels explained that
much of the violence in the city is with
in ethnic communities and usually
stems from fights over "turfs, villages
and gardens" in the city.
Aton Gutierrez '07, technology co
ordinator of El Centro Chicano.
stressed that University students can
make a difference.
"We need to really look into the sit
uation and evaluate what we can do to
help a community that has always been
linked to Stanford," he said. "East Palo
Alto is across a bridge. It is really right
next door. We as Stanford students eas
ily turn a blind eye. I really want you
guys to leave with that impression that
there is something that you can do."
Stanford student involvement in
aiding the East Palo Alto community
was a major topic of discussion at the
event.
"We had to mobilize ourselves," said
Marjorie Soto 'O 1 ). outreach coordina
tor tor El Centro Chicano. "Stanford is
a great resource, right across the bridge.
[We wanted toj inform Stanford stu
dents about what is going on and talk to
them about different ways in which
they can get involved with the commu
nity."
Some students said that a lack of in
formation on the issue of violence in
the nearby city prompted them to at
tend.
Hie event's sponsors provided audi
ence members with fliers listing Stan
ford organizations who send volunteers
into East Palo Alto. One of the pro
grams featured on the flier was
Ravenswood Tutors, a program that al
lows students to tutor elementary
school students in literacy and lan
guage.
Abrica expressed hope that the tide
of violence would soon be reversed.
"There is no reason why we can't
eventually catch up with every young
man," he said, "and help them find an
other way to project their identity and
who they are."
