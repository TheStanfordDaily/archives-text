## Campus event Senior semi-formal: Middle school dance, reloaded 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION SEVENTH GRADER 
That's pretty much where 1 felt
like I could have been this past Fri
day night — a middle school dance
— except for the fact that alcohol
could be purchased (because don't
think for a second that $12 gets you
any free booze) and that it wasn't in
the cafeteria, but at the Pacific Ath
letic Club somewhere in Redwood
City. I'm not saying that I didn't have
fun or that I regret going — it just
felt like I had already been to this
dance 10 years ago.
Why's that? To me. the evening
reeked of middle school mostly be
cause the whole thing seemed pretty
awkward. When I arrived around
10:30, the place was basically empty.
The dance floor was deserted and
there were only a few people min
gling around the club, both indoors
and out.

but know are popular,etc.) to remind
us that we are in fact living in the year
2007, but then there was also Sir Mix
a-Lot and the Tag Team.
Are "Baby Got Back" and
"Whoomp There It Is" seriously the
best musical relics of our childhood
that they could manage to drum up?
In my opinion, you shouldn't do a
throwback half-heartedly. If that's
the way you're going to go, at least
play some *NSync!
And speaking of throwbacks. the
DJ had to end the thing with the
dreaded 'slow dance.' Just like in
middle school, when those with dates
happily paired off, and the stag sen
iors like me were left awkwardly
standing in the middle of the dance
floor. I mean, there wasn't even fair
warning so that I could have slyly es
caped to the bathroom or some
thing...Ten seconds earlier they had
been playing "Whoomp There it Is."
for Pete's sake!

I know that it's always encour
aged to meet new people and make
new friends, but at this point in my
senior year. I wasn't all too inspired
to "stop and chat" (that's coined by
my hero. Larry David) with strangers
gathered in their cliques of friends; it
would just be too strange ("Where
did you live freshman year? What are
you majoring in?"), like a freshman
conversation three years too late.
After wandering around for 15
minutes or so. I opted to sample the
bar. A highlight of the evening: my
Long Island Iced Tea cost a mere six
dollars. That's a good three dollars
cheaper than it would be at most of
our pub night venues. Kudos to
someone on that.
Then 1 attempted to be cool as 1
walked around sipping my drink,
searching for people that might rec
ognize me. By 11. people that actual
ly knew my name had finally filed in.
so I spent most of the following hour
catching up and "stopping and chat
ting".
This actually was fun — some
times we forget about our long lost
triends that have either moved to
West Campus or are too busy staffing
a frosh dorm or writing a thesis to
visit us during daytime hours.
Around midnight, when I was
both sufficiently buzzed from my
Long Island and talked out. some of
my friends and I decided to hit the
dance floor. Back to the middle
school comparison, what was going
on with the music? Yes. there Were
the current Billboard Hits (i.e. Justin,
F'ergie, other songs I can't identify

So. after a quick fruitless scan of
the dance floor, I determined that my
social dance skills would not be put
to the test that evening. 1 then walked
off of the dance floor with my head
ducked in shame, and waited in the
lobby with the other dateless folk.
Soon after, my friends and their dates
reappeared, and we all went home.
To clarify. I didn't dislike the
evening. I would have regretted not
going — after all this was likely my
penultimate prom-style dance in life
(no grad school formals for me and
weddings " shudder* are somehow of
a different class).
I got dressed up, saw some old
friends, took some pretty pictures,
had a little bit to drink and even man
aged to more or less avoid the rain
(sSure are my heroes). Besides, mid
dle school may have been awkward
but it was fun enough (for me at
least; rumor has it that it was down
right depressing for some), so why
complain?
Perhaps the take-home message
is that prom-style dances will be a lit
tle bit awkward no matter how old
we get—so just embrace them. Also.
Sir Mix-a-Lot creates music that
transcends the ages.
So, class officers, make sure that
you get a larger venue with more
tickets for the Senior Formal (there
were only 400 for this event for a
class ot around 1600, which left quite
a few people that wanted tickets
without them), as it would be just
tragic if anybody missed another
night ot pleasant awkwardness come
spring quarter.
