## Smells like tea spirit 
### NATE SOLON INTERMISSION ENLIGHTENEDONE 
It v easy to get the same thing every time you go to Jamba
Juice Why take a risk when nil you want is some fruity hy
dration ' Every week we will take the risk and review a
different, less common smoothie flavor. So take the
plunge and try something new.

Matdia Green Tea Itlast

According to Jamba Juice's promotional materials,
"the power of Matcha. with antioxidants, theophylline
;tnd caffeine.makes this a blast."This smoothie is part of
their new line of "Totally Tea

Smoothies." I ordered it without
additional boosts to get the purest
estimation of its flavor and texture.
The drink's color is a mysteri
ous green somewhere between
seaweed and the mucus associated
with .1 sinus infection.The granular
appearance suggests the drink's
texture: creaminess punctuated by
crunchy ice crystals. The aroma is
dominated by dairy, resembling
vanilla ice cream (though the drink
is actually made with nonfat fro/en

yogurt). Hie same presence of
dairy envelopes the front of the
palate on the first sip.

It's followed by strong citrus
notes and hints of ripe fruits, includ
ing pineapple and banana. The drink

finishes with a whiff of the eponymous
green tea. Overall, it closely resembles
the green tea ice cream offered in some
Japanese restaura 111 s.

As tor the psychological effects of matcha green tea,
at first they proved disappointing. 1 felt nothing out of
the ordinary as I hiked down Santa Teresa away from
Jamba Juice. Just then. I heard a screech of tires and
everything went black.

I can't vouch for what hap
pened after that, but when I
came to. a guy said it appeared
that I had "stopped the car with
my mind." Also. I had achieved
Nirvana. So let me just say this:
I larry Potter dies in book seven,
riding a unicycle stopped being
cool and quirky about a year ago
and watching a season of 24 isn't
worth 24 hours of your life. I
could tell you more, but would
n't it be easier to try the drink
yourself?
