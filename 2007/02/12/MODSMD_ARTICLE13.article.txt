Despite its proximity to the dates of 11e11. the
Cool ('ale is aptly named. Iverything about this
quirky, organie histro is lukewarm: the food, the
service and even the decor of the .lane Pearson &
John I). I.eland Family room in the Cantor Arts

Stanford student feeling a little bit tepid herself.
Of the Stanford campus eateries. Cool Cafe
leels the least scholastic, due perhaps to its largely
non-Stanford clientele. Hie most obvious indica
tion of such clientele is the prices; few things 011 the
chalkboard menu are under Of course, the
extra expense reflects an attention to quality that
a Stanford student won't find in his or her local
dining hall. ( 00l ('ale uses local, seasonal and or
ganic ingredients, and its menu changes to reflect
the seasonality of their produce. Knowing that the
vegetables in your watery black bean soup are or
ganic. however, doesn't make them taste any bet
ter. Trust me.
The cafe itsell is quiet and understated. Only
one wall is painted (a deep eggplant color), and
there are no more than twelve tables in the small
room. A collection of black-and-white photo
graphs on the wall illustrates the food-making
process. All of the silverware, napkins and condi
ments are stacked neatly 011 a wire shelf to the
right of the entrance. You place your order at the

front counter, and then take your number to \oui
table, where the food is brought to you with rela
tive swiftness.
'Hie menu's evenly split between salads and
sandwiches with a respectable variety of vegetari

,ui options in both categories. Ilie meat lover
would also be pleased at the mere mention ot "nat

ingly demure lunch selection. After
some deliberation. I ordered the
Cafe ( 'ombo: half of the turkey sand
wich and a bowl of the black bean
soup. My friend ordered the Chutney
Chicken Salad, described on the
menu as a "medley of free range
chicken, water chestnuts, and celery
in a light dressing with curry yogurt
dressing." We took our number "11"
to a table near the window for a
sweeping vista of the Keck Science
building.
My turkey sandwich was simple
but pleasantly experimental with
thick, tender slices of Coleman natu
ral turkey between a layer of tangy
honey mustard and avocado. 1 re
moved the Swiss slice, but fans of the
cheese might have appreciated that
even this was organic (from Clover
Farms). Ihe wheat bread, though of
the sliced variety, was flavorful and
nutty. Ihe black bean soup also earns
points for creativity with its unex
pected segments ol green beans and
chunky dices ol potatoes and carrots,
but the consistency disappointed me.
Black bean soup, by convention,
should be thick enough to blur the
line between soup and solid. Cool
Cafe makes theirs a little smoother.
The presentation of the chutney
chicken salad came as a pleasant sur
prise. A globe ol chicken salad rested
on the right end of the plate, while
across the central green leaf assort
ment, two slices of Bay Bread organ
ic baguette balanced the ensemble.
Around the edge of the plate, the
chef had sprinkled random, organic
vegetablesâ€”a slice of beetroot here,
a violet sprout of cauliflower there.
In my friend's final assessment,
the salad was overall agreeable, al
though perhaps not worthy of its $10
price. Once we paused to contem
plate the dollar amount we are rou
tinely charged by Stanford Dining
for our lackluster lunches at Lag.
however, we realized that Cool
Cafe's chutney chicken was more of
a bargain than we thought.
In spite of a refreshing commit
ment to organic food, as well as ener
getic innovations on the traditional
salad and sandwich maneuvers, the
Cool Cafe leaves you saying. "Yeah,
but..." Its menu prices are too expen
sive for the ordinary student lunch,
and its location in Cantor makes it in
accessible for hectic weekdays. But if
you're looking for a quiet corner of
campus to show your mother on Par
ents' Weekend. Cool Cafe maybe the
ideal locale. For everyday student life,
however, this cafe plays it too cool.
