It's not that I don't like l'rat parties. What could
be cozier than spending a few hours getting
wastey-face with 300 close, personal strangers who
probabh know a lot more about physics than
thev're willing to reveal? Nothing.except possibly
spending two hours scrubbing off a marinade of
melted makeup, boxed wine spills and other peo
ple's sweat as soon as you get home. And yet for
some reason I was not in the mood for Kappa Sig
May be-You'll-( icl-Some this weekend. What hap
pened to a simpler time, a better time, when the
Spice (iirls were hot, "l ull I louse" rnled the
screen and the closest we ever got to controlled
substances was juice boxes or possibly spinning
around until we felt sick?
Ihis weekend. I had a sleepover.
Il you're in a relationship, you're probably
complaining that every night is a sleepover— but
when's the last time your boyfriend let you give
him a make-over or a new hairdo made out of
shaving cream? I called up the girls (they were
skeptical), ran to Safeway for cocoa mix and
cranked up the hawt Wis jam/ Xigazig-ah.

1-2-3: lb get everybody into the game-playing
mood, the first thing we attempted was the decep
tively simple " 1-2-3" game. Hie premise, if you've
never been on a catastrophically long road trip, is
that one player thinks of any word and when he
has, says, "One." I hen another player thinks of a
word and says,"'l\vo." ()n "three" both players say
their random words. The goal is to think of a

word that aptly combines some quality of both
random words,and to match this word with the
other person playing. I ike "memorable" and
"Germany" might yield "Hitler" as a middle
ground, or "golf" and "blue" might lead to
"balls " (>nce you think of your guess, say "one"
or "two" and on "three" reveal it simultaneous
ly with your partner. II you don't match up on
the first try. then keep play ing, trying to c< >mc
up with a new word that relates to both of the
guesses in the last round.
