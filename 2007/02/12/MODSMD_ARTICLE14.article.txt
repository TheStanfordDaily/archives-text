It's not that I don't like l'rat parties. What could
be cozier than spending a few hours getting
wastey-face with 300 close, personal strangers who
probabh know a lot more about physics than
thev're willing to reveal? Nothing.except possibly
spending two hours scrubbing off a marinade of
melted makeup, boxed wine spills and other peo
ple's sweat as soon as you get home. And yet for
some reason I was not in the mood for Kappa Sig

Spice (iirls were hot, "l ull I louse" rnled the

substances was juice boxes or possibly spinning
around until we felt sick?
Ihis weekend. I had a sleepover.
Il you're in a relationship, you're probably
complaining that every night is a sleepover— but
when's the last time your boyfriend let you give
him a make-over or a new hairdo made out of
shaving cream? I called up the girls (they were
skeptical), ran to Safeway for cocoa mix and
cranked up the hawt Wis jam/ Xigazig-ah.
Alter tiie obligatory initial sleepover girly fac
tor — gossiping about cute boys, an absurdly long
conversation about eyeliner and maraschino cher

ries on everything — we got to the crux ol the
event: games. Since we were going old school, I
racked my three years of (iirl Scout Assistant
'Iroop I cader experience to find a few games that
would bring back that old spin-'til-you-dropsensa

111 Ml.
1-2-3: lb get everybody into the game-playing
mood, the first thing we attempted was the decep
tively simple " 1-2-3" game. Hie premise, if you've
never been on a catastrophically long road trip, is
that one player thinks of any word and when he
has, says, "One." I hen another player thinks of a
word and says,"'l\vo." ()n "three" both players say
their random words. The goal is to think of a

word that aptly combines some quality of both
random words,and to match this word with the
other person playing. I ike "memorable" and
"Germany" might yield "Hitler" as a middle
ground, or "golf" and "blue" might lead to
"balls " (>nce you think of your guess, say "one"
or "two" and on "three" reveal it simultaneous
ly with your partner. II you don't match up on
the first try. then keep play ing, trying to c< >mc
up with a new word that relates to both of the
guesses in the last round.
112 lour Swing: While word games are fun.
they jlist don't scream "eight-year-old at sum
mer camp" enough to satisfy my sleepover
cravings. So next, we went outside.armed with
knee-high stockings and a bag of flour to play

one of my all-time favorite games To play Flour
Swing, you pour about four cups of flour each in

the toes of two knee-high stockings,
tie a knot under the flour, and put
the free end of the stocking on two
people's heads.Then they square off.
Ihe goal is to use your flour sack to
dislodge your opponent's. Be sure to
wear old clothes — 1 got brutally
flour-pummeled for suggesting the
game in the first place and am not
looking forward to laundry day.
Also, try to brush off some of the
white flour before you head back in
side, or else some disgruntled janitor
is going to wonder what Lindsay
Lohan was doing in the stairwell
next Monday.
Jell-o Toes: Our final game of the
evening. I'll admit, was discovered on
a Christian youth ministry Web site
while procrastinating on a film essay.
To play, prepare two boxes of Jell-o (I
chose lime green, redolent of Nick
elodeon slime and the glory of life
pre-puberty) in a disposable alu
minum turkey roaster. As the Jell-o

begins to set, drop in a bag of 100 mar
bles. Clear out a shelf in your fridge
(dude, just throw out that six-gallon
container of non-fat organic cottage
cheese — you're never going to finish
it) and let it set for several hours.To
play, spread out a tarp on the floor
(disposable plastic tablecloths from
Safeway are cheap and get the job
done), put the roaster on it and have
everyone sit around barefoot. Hie ob
ject of the game is to transfer as many
marbles as you can from the roaster to
a Dixie cup, using only your toes.
Squelch.
After we'd cleaned everything
up. my once-skeptical friends had
completely transformed and were
pretty psyched about the campy
nostalgia. We hung out in a fort
made of pillows and extra sheets, ate
s'mores (helpful hint: Don't use a
lighter instead of a stovetop. It
makes them taste like cancer.) and
talked for hours. All in all. it was one
alcohol-free weekend significantly
more exciting than sitting in the
Meyer 24-hour room, knocking
back Jack and Cokes —hold the
Jack. Plus, nobody spilled his beer
on us.
