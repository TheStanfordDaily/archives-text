SPOII I R WARNING! If you
don't want to know what happens in
I lie seventh and final I lain Potter
novel,"l larry Potter and the Death
ly 11 allows," stop reading this article
now.
I lain Potter dies in book seven.
People have been talking about
the final I larry Potter hook since the
moment Ik Rowling.an author now
richer than the Ouecn of I ngland,
announced thai the series was
capped at seven books. Now that the
release date (.1 ul\ 21.2007) has been
set and the pre-order frenzy on Aina
/on.com has already begun, specula
tive theories of the boy wizard's final
fate are running rampant. As much
as it pains me to sa\ it.the boy who
lived is eoinii to become the h<>\ that
died.
The seeds for I larry's demise
were planted in book five "The
Order ot the Phoenix." In Professor
Trelawncy's prophecy, the Divina
tion teacher says, "either must die at
the hand of the other for neither can
live while the other survives..." 1 ie

cause Voldcmort chose 1 larry rather
than Neville Longbottom .is the
child who would fulfill the prophecy.
1 larry was marked for death practi
cally from birth. In order to rid the
world of Voldemort. I larry must sac
rifice himself —a true hero's death.
Furthermore, the ending of the
"'Hie llalf-lilood Prince" seis up
I larry as a Messianic figure, no
longer just a boy in a magical world
but a man who has to assume the
mantle of savior for the sins < particu
larly arrogance) of the wizarding
world.
Though the textual evidence
points Harry toward the grave, it's
the real world circumstances that
drive in the final nails into his coffin.
Hie first clue is the release date of
the book. Warner Bros, is releasing
the movie adaptation of" llic Order
of the Phoenix" on .lul\ 13 and the
seventh book comes out a week
later. Any marketer worth his salt
knows that if you're releasing the
seventh book of a literary franchise
on the magnitude of Harry Potter,
the date 7/7/07 is a marketing god
send.
However, if the main character
dies in the final book, there must be a
buffer period between the release of
the film and the release of the book
so that the scarred children will not
be deterred from going to see the
movie because their hero is no longer
among the living.
A billion-dollar film franchise
seen all over the world- one on
which Warner Bros.' summer block
buster budget was invested—is
enough to ensure that all the cogs in
the Harry Potter machine arc
greased up to make the most money.
I)espile the economics of the film
industry, the greatest tlire.it to
Harry's life is not the Ministry of
Magic. Voldemort or even teenage
hormonal fluctuations. It's Ik.
Rowling. 'Ilie author wields the pen
like a mighty sword, already threat
erring that two major characters are
going to die. The identity of these
characters is being kept a closely
guarded secret, but given the circum
stances already presented in the pre
vious novels, the possible victims are
few.
In a recent interview about the
novel. Rowling stated that she was "in
mourning" despite her sense of
achievement on finishing the series.
' I've never felt such a mixture of ex
treme emotions in my life, never
dreamed I could feel simultaneously
heartbroken and euphoric," Rowling
said. "I always knew that Harry's story
would end with the seventh book, but
saying goodbye has been just as hard
as I always knew it would be."
Hie most convincing and unam
biguous evidence of Harry's death
sentence comes from a recent inter
view conducted by the BBC. During
the interview, Rowling said "she
could understand why authors might
want to finish off their main charac
ters in order to ensure they could
never be resurrected."
F rom a business standpoint, with
I larry dead. Rowling retains not just
intellectual rights over the character,
she retains an absolute control of his
fate — in other words, Harry cannot
be used in spin-off novels.This means
we won't ever see "I larry Potter and
the College Years"; given the dilu
tion of past properties once they are
taken away from the original au
thors. perhaps this is a good thing.
Rowling is not only a clever
writer, she is a savvy business
woman. So. come July 21, listen for
the collective scream of millions of
children all around the world as
their childhood hero says goodbye
to I logwarts...and to life.
