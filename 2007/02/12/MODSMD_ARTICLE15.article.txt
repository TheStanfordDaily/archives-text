### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION DEATHFATER 
SPOII I R WARNING! If you
don't want to know what happens in
I lie seventh and final I lain Potter
novel,"l larry Potter and the Death
ly 11 allows," stop reading this article
now.
I lain Potter dies in book seven.
People have been talking about
the final I larry Potter hook since the
moment Ik Rowling.an author now
richer than the Ouecn of I ngland,
announced thai the series was
capped at seven books. Now that the
release date (.1 ul\ 21.2007) has been
set and the pre-order frenzy on Aina
/on.com has already begun, specula
tive theories of the boy wizard's final
fate are running rampant. As much
as it pains me to sa\ it.the boy who
lived is eoinii to become the h<>\ that
died.
The seeds for I larry's demise
were planted in book five "The
Order ot the Phoenix." In Professor
Trelawncy's prophecy, the Divina
tion teacher says, "either must die at
the hand of the other for neither can
live while the other survives..." 1 ie

cause Voldcmort chose 1 larry rather
than Neville Longbottom .is the
child who would fulfill the prophecy.
1 larry was marked for death practi
cally from birth. In order to rid the
world of Voldemort. I larry must sac
rifice himself —a true hero's death.
Furthermore, the ending of the
"'Hie llalf-lilood Prince" seis up
I larry as a Messianic figure, no
longer just a boy in a magical world
but a man who has to assume the
mantle of savior for the sins < particu
larly arrogance) of the wizarding
world.
Though the textual evidence
points Harry toward the grave, it's
the real world circumstances that
drive in the final nails into his coffin.
Hie first clue is the release date of
the book. Warner Bros, is releasing
the movie adaptation of" llic Order
of the Phoenix" on .lul\ 13 and the
seventh book comes out a week
later. Any marketer worth his salt
knows that if you're releasing the
seventh book of a literary franchise
on the magnitude of Harry Potter,
the date 7/7/07 is a marketing god
send.
However, if the main character
dies in the final book, there must be a
buffer period between the release of
the film and the release of the book
so that the scarred children will not
be deterred from going to see the
movie because their hero is no longer
among the living.
A billion-dollar film franchise
seen all over the world- one on
which Warner Bros.' summer block
buster budget was invested—is
enough to ensure that all the cogs in
the Harry Potter machine arc
greased up to make the most money.
I)espile the economics of the film
industry, the greatest tlire.it to
Harry's life is not the Ministry of
Magic. Voldemort or even teenage
hormonal fluctuations. It's Ik.
