## Editorial Board Keep green space alive 
### 
The past year may have been tougher
than usual for some of the recreation
minded in the Stern and Wilbur dorm
complexes.Thanks to a major gift for the Law
School, the new Munger underground park
ing garage underneath Wilbur Field is cur
rently under construction. "Ibis garage is the
first step in a project which will provide hous
ing and parking for all law students and place
them essentially next to the Law School.
While Wilbur Field was being excavated, the
nearby Stern Field (which is between Stern
and Wilbur) was converted from grass to a
temporary parking lot for the duration of the
construction, leaving both out of commission
for all intents and purposes.
On a positive note, the loss should only
he temporary. The Munger garage is specif
ically designed to house a new recreational
field above it.and the temporary paved
parking on Stern will be converted back to
grass once construction ends. Also, undevel
oped space near the Manzanita complex
was converted to a groomed field with sev
eral basketball courts, which helps make up
for the difference and will result in an over
all gain when all construction is finished.
Naturally, students living nearby have
lamented the inconvenience of their miss
ing fields. Even it it is temporary, they will
not necessarily be in the same place when
work is complete. This view is understand
able. as is the point that construction is in
evitable and frequently inconveniences at
least some people. I lowever, noting the dis
content is worthwhile as a reminder of how
important the outdoor environment is to
our campus.
Green space is a crucial part of Stan
ford's identity. It is no coincidence that the
University's current video advertisement

features aerial shots of the Oval and en
trance to the Main Ouad. In the video, red
tile roofs contrast sharply with the large
grassy areas, and trees seem to be every
where. Palm Drive is a signature of the cam
pus. and we pay lots of money to maintain
the non-native trees. Anyone acclimated to
the school is probably sick of hearing about
it. hut a constant chorus to visitors is that the
scenery leads to a friendly, fun and liberat
ing environment.
Besides the role of supplying beautiful
backdrops that seem to be useful in promo
tional strategies, green space is also subject
to heavy recreational use. Sunbathing is one
of the most popular leisure activities. Pick
up games of Frisbee, soccer and football can
provide gratifying short breaks from study
ing. Faculty, staff and neighbors—in addi
tion to current students—are also among
those who run on the paths, play on the
fields and sunbathe in the grass.
As demonstrated by the ads and the at
tempts to mitigate the Munger side effects,
administrative decision makers are aware
of the value ot green spaces. Providing
green areas around Old Union was a pri
mary consideration in its redevelopment,
and the site behind Casa Italiana designated
for the future Green Dorm was chosen in
part so that it would not encroach on Flo
rence Moore (FloMo)A field.
With the strong correspondence be
tween student preferences and University
interests, continued emphasis on green
space should not be contentious. We hope
that preserving, refining and expanding out
door areas for both informal and formal ac
tivities will remain a main concern of the
I Jniversity.We hope a commitment to green
space is reflected in future developments.
