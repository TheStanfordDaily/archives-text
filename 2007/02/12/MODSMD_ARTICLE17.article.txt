# An inquiry into principles of epicacity
## 
### 
Epic. It's all the rage with the kids these
days, and for that I've got mixed feel
ings. If you can 't tell by the title of my
column. I'm enamored by the epic. So on the
one hand. I'm happy. Excited, even. For
sure, it's amusing to watch as the word, the
concept, the lifestyle develops — it's a revo
lution.
But at the same time I've got my reserva
tions. because the epic I've come to cherish
so passionately is being beaten to death by a
bunch of patently un-epic goons who sit
around on You Tube watching videos of
other people pulling off epic stunts they are
too un-epic to do themselves. And, of
course, most of you know this Friday night
scene well: the crowd of faceless drunks who
incoherently bump and grind to the played
out beats of our very own O-S-V-A-L-D
-OHHHH. Dude, this party is so epic —
OHH TEN!
Don't get me wrong. I love dance parties
and online videos. They just don't fit the bill,
if it's epicacity we're talking about.
So how does one define epic? Well, you
might consult Urban Dictionary (urbandic
tionary.com). a very handy online resource
(it's the height of hip, the pulse of the
youth).
Okay, first off, a disclaimer. Urban Di
ctionary is probably the least reliable source
of information you'll find anywhere this
side of the information highway. Most of the
dictionary entries are submitted by 12 year
olds whose eyes (and souls) have been
scarred by frequent visits to the grimier cor
ners of the World Wide Web.
But in all honesty, I was curious to see
how the far the epic movement has come,
and checking out what the kiddies are say
ing is a good indicator of that. A quick
search of the word "epic" yields a number of
interesting definitions, but it's the related
entries that provide the most hilarity. Just
for fun. try it yourself and you'll see: epic
fail. epic maneuver (x 2). Epic Movie, Epic
proportions, EPIC, EPIC SHIT, Epicicity,
Epicnicity, Epicac (...oh whoops), and. my
personal favorite. Epic Mount (Look it up
at your own peril...)
I can relate to a lot of these. I especially
love observing the way people innovate in
their slangy use of language. One man's
"epicnicity" is another's "epicicity." Com
pare those to my own "epicacity." There's
something to be said about the way trends
ebb and flow — it's a phenomenon that's
impressive, if anything.
Ultimately, however, what it comes down
to is that "epic"can't be defined. It's really a
mode of existence, a philosophy for living. If
you aspire to the epic, it'll pay dividends.
That much I guarantee.
From something simple, like biking to
San Francisco at night (with a helmet and

bike light) to more impressive feats,like, uh.
becoming a pirate: chartering a seafaring
vessel, hoisting the main, and navigating the
dangerous waters of the White Plaza foun
tain. for example. And truly it's spontaneity
that matters most. You can't plan epicness.
It should come to you like a Bacchanalian
frenzy, except less insane.
Still. I ve had more "safety" oriented
friends complain that my so-called epicacity
is merely self-destructive, dangerous and
above all idiotic. I disagree. Granted, the
line between epic and stupid is often fuzzy,
so exercise some judgment.
hither way. the sole purpose of the epic is
self-improvement, a quality attained by
shattering conventions and breaking new
ground — this is the heart of epicacity. Do
you remember that tear-jerking scene from
"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,"
when our two lovable heroes are standing at
the edge of a cliff, with nowhere to go but
down? And what did Kumar say? Well,
something corny about hunger and immi
grants and so forth, but the point is — they
hangglided off a mountain to attain their
goal: a scrumptious stack of iddy-biddv
White Castle burgers and all the life lesson's
they represent. Ihat s as epic as you can get.
As it turns out, there was this one time
over winter break my freshman year when
my friends and I got the itch. The itch for
White ( astle. Now. I live in Boston, and the
nearest White Castle is four hours away in
New \ork. But we were totally set on that
goal. We were going to do it. to make the
drive, no matter what obstacles stood in our
way And then I drove into a house. Ok fine,
1 just clipped it. Needless to say. it kinda
killed the mood.
So I'm obviously not the most epic per
son in the world. And I certainly don't try to
be. and neither should anyone else, because
you II injure yourself and/or innocent peo
ple in the process. But take what I've said to
heart — spice up your life and do some
thing you normally wouldn't. You (hopeful
ly) won't regret it. And you sure as heck
won't forget it.

over winter break my freshman year when
my friends and I got the itch. The itch for
White ( astle. Now. I live in Boston, and the
nearest White Castle is four hours away in
New \ork. But we were totally set on that
goal. We were going to do it. to make the
drive, no matter what obstacles stood in our
way And then I drove into a house. Ok fine,
1 just clipped it. Needless to say. it kinda
killed the mood.
So I'm obviously not the most epic per
son in the world. And I certainly don't try to
be. and neither should anyone else, because
you II injure yourself and/or innocent peo
ple in the process. But take what I've said to
heart — spice up your life and do some
thing you normally wouldn't. You (hopeful
ly) won't regret it. And you sure as heck
won't forget it.
