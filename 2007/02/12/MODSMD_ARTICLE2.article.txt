# Dance Marathon raises record funds
## 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Almost I.(XK) people participated in this
weekend's third annual Stanford Dance
Marathon — a 24-hour fundraising party that
took place at the Arrillaga Alumni Center from
noon on Saturday until noon on Sunday.
More than 940 dancers tried to remain on
their feet for a full day in an effort to raise
awareness about HIV/AIDS.
This year's event teamed up with Partners in
Health (PI 11) — a nonprofit organization that
provides healthcare to some of the world's
poorest communities — to raise $150,893.62,
smashing the organizers' goal of $100,000 and
almost tripling the $58.(XX) raised by last year's
party.
FACE AIDS, a student-run campaign de
signed to promote awareness about
HIV/AIDS in Africa,contributed an addition
al $60,000, increasing the total for the event to
$210,000. The money will go to support health

clinics in Rwanda recently set up by PI 11.
More than three times the number of
dancers had registered for this year's edition of
Dance Marathon (940) than had last year
(300). The event's organizers also tried to in
crease community involvement by encourag
ing local families to participate in the party,
which coincidentally fell on Family Day.
In addition, a number of students from
Santa Clara and Touro Universities signed up
for the event.
By most accounts, this year's dance was a
huge success.
"It's awesome; I love dancing," said Nikil
Viswanathan '10. "It always feels like right
when you are in the heat of the dance, it usual
ly ends. But this one keeps going. And it is even
more special and awesome because 1 am with
all of my best friends and my dorm."
Participants also were grateful for the sup
port of "moralers." who helped keep the weary
dancers inspired and awake.
"It is a constant How of energy which keeps

everyone going," said Team Branner leader
Kyla Barr *10. "It's nice because every three
hours moralers come in. and it gets everyone's
energy back up so it's not a slump."
Moralers and dancers alike were required
to raise money for lIIV/AIDS awareness in
order to participate in the event. Each dancer
pledged to raise at least $140.enough to pay for
one year's worth of anti-retroviral treatment
for one patient. Moralers pledged to raise at
least $35. Dance Marathon also obtained fund
ing from corporate sponsors, including Apple
and Kaplan.
"I think that [sponsors] get encouraged that

students are the ones getting involved and tak
ing the initiative," Barr said. "We are actually
doing something rather than just voicing our
opinion through student groups and writing
letters. It's not just about raising money for
AIDS. It's about realizing the bigger picture
and voicing what you believe should be done
about the problem."
The party's organizers were thrilled with the
turnout and commitment at this year's event,
and said they were hopeful that the fundraiser
was successful in spreading awareness about
the problems associated with lIIV/AIDS.
"I think it was really successful in terms of a

new level of professionalism and doing new
things," said Dance Marathon co-Chair Tory
Kauer '08. "People's energy level was just awe
some (...) we had a lot of people do all 24 hours.
We wanted to introduce students to social ac
tivism through dancing and connecting with a
cause."
Despite their exhaustion, most dancers re
mained enthusiastic after the event.
"You are really tired," said Philip Hon '10.
"Your feet hurt. Hut it's all worth it."
