# Vanity fair
## 
### 
A silk, pink blazer thrown over a little
black dress; legs clad in a modernized
pair ol black fishnets accentuated by
pink, über-pointy four-inch heels covered by
graffiti-esque designs. Is she a lady of the
evening? A misguided socialite? One of Brit
ney's back-up dancers? Or me on my way to
my physics? If you turn to the "Campus Fash
ion" page of my senior year high school year
book. the answer will become blatantly, ut
terly, painfully clear.
The me of today wouldn't be caught dead
in anything even remotely resembling the
above outfit, but in high school, it was the
standard fare. And honestly, I think in a
weird. Euro-trashy kind of way, it looked ...
not bad? Or. at the very least, it caught peo
ple's attention and was a nice conversation
starter. So why did I trade in my heels for
flats, my fishnets for jeans and my pink blaz
er for something most decidedly not pink?
The decision was neither a conscious nor
a sudden one. Far from it. in fact. When I
rolled into Roble freshman year, 1 brought
four huge boxes brimming with clothes. I had
two J-Lo hats, skirts ranging from peasant
chic ankle-length to "wtf was I thinking?"
hoochietude, a sun dress, a little black dress,
my prom dress, a gold-sequined dress that
came in handy a time or two and more shoes
than any one person could ever need (includ
ing a pair of Dior boots that I've only worn
once for fear of scratching the leather or
scuffing the heals).
During hall introductions, my RA asked
us everyone to pick a hand signal to repre
sent some interesting facet of our personali
ties and I tugged on my ears, explaining that
1 like big earrings. It seemed like the best way
to sum up my essence. Fashionista was the
role I was born to play, and 1 wasn't going to
let something silly like college come between
me and my destiny.
But as the year wore on. my lust for fash
ion began slowly slipping away. At first, it
wasn't a big deal — I just stopped curling my
hair. Accessories were next to go. Soon, jeans

began to replace skirts with increasingly
frightening frequency and dresses ceased to
leave the closet at all. Finally, perhaps in
evitably. the unthinkable happened. 1 aban
doned the love of my life, my pride and joy —
my big earrings. But by the time 1 realized
what was happening, it was too late. 1 was a
lost cause, doomed to wander the earth in
jeans and a sweatshirt. Unkempt and
unloved.
1 could blame this unholy transition on
the inherently busy and lazy nature of col
lege. It's hard enough to find time for the
necessities of lite (i.e., sleeping, eating,
showering), let alone for the superfluous
details (i.e. coordinating outfits, curling
hair, applying make-up). But introspection
suggests this isn't the real reason. I'm a bit
of an attention whore and getting up a mere
30 minutes earlier would be a small price to
pay for the thrill of turning a few heads. 1
just didn't want the same kind of attention
anymore.
Each time I concocted some snazzy outfit,
showed up to brunch with makeup and hair
already done, or decided to wear a nifty pair
of heels to a 9 a.m. class, my friends laughed
at me (those hussies). They called me silly
and hurled epithets at Los Angeles, blaming
my beloved hometown for this preoccupa
tion with appearances. "Vain! Vain! Vain!"
they chanted in unison.
And. like a fool, I listened. I accepted. I
conformed.
To my own horror. I joined their condem
nation of all things fashionable without be
lieving a word of it. Many a time have I found

myself mocking that girl who gets dolled lip
for lecture, the one who rides her hike in
heels and a skirt that's about two inches too
short to he appropriate, or the one who
shows no shame in spending more on a purse
than (in a computer. I shouted insults and
cast metaphorical stones of hypocrisy.
But even though I scoff, I'm of the firm
opinion that all of these girls look like stone
foxes. 1 admire and respect those who take
the time and effort to look like bombshells
even during the only four years of life when
being perfectly put-together isn't expected of
a woman. Oh. how ardently 1 yearn to carry
myself with the poise and grace reserved
only for the truly well dressed among us. Hut
my damned insecurities implore me to pro
tect myself from the cruel taunts of my peers.
"Vain ' Not I!" 1 yell as a pull on my hoodie
and sneakers, my heart breaking from the
homeliness.
Its a shame that in this bastion of acade
mia, style and intellect are, more or less, con
sidered mutually exclusive. Sadly, being a
fashionista too often comes at the expense of
being taken seriously.
I don't pretend to be a diehard feminist
I have no qualms about using feminine
charm to get ahead; I don't mind playing the
I m just a girl. I need you to do this for me"
card; I like when guys open the door,pour the
drinks and pick up the check — but even I
can t deny that any woman has to work twice
as hard as any man to be respected. Especial
ly if that woman is cute and nicely dressed
with dainty strands of hair strategically fram
ing her ivory skin, rosv cheeks and cherry red
lips.
But what if they're all wrong? Maybe Los
Angeles and my high school self actually got
it right. Maybe vanity is just a fact of life.
Maybe 1 II bring my pink blazer back from
retirement,after all. But then again,probably
not.
