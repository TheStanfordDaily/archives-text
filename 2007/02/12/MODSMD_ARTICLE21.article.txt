## Stop the blame game 
### CYNTHIA CHO, ANTHONY HA, WILL OREMUS, CAMILLE RICKETTS BARRETT SHERIDAN 
As former Daily editors, we followed the
squash story scandal of the past two weeks
with dismay and growing frustration. We
were dismayed by the story itself ("On plane,
squash to the rescue," Jan. 23) and the dam
age it caused to The Daily's reputation. But
we were frustrated by the paper's response to
the incident, which fixated on the mistakes of

one staff member while skirting systematic
failings.
In the interest of full disclosure, we are all
acquaintances of the scandal's starring play
er. David Herbert. Some of us are good
friends with him. others simply workplace
colleagues. Either way, we are not entirely
disinterested. But we are also professional
journalists with the ability to evaluate an
issue skeptically and impartially.
ITiat The Daily immediately printed a
thorough correction to the squash story was
commendable, as was the correction's pronii

nent placement on the front page ("Squash
story contained inaccuracies," Jan. 24). We
also applaud the new editor in chief's pledge
to institute newsroom-wide ethics training
( anies Hohmann: F ; .ditor's Welcome," Feb
What remains troubling, however, is the
extent to which the paper's leadership has
placed the blame for the entire incident on
lerbert s head. In Hohmann's editorial, we
are told that his "highly capable predeces-
sor" Patrick Fitzgerald "acted deci
sively." I Icrhcrt is not mentioned In
name, but I lohmann writes that lie
"will not participate in' I lie Daily this
volume."
I lerbert certainly showed poor
judgment by editing a story in which
he was falsely cast as a protagonist.
' I lie intent oi' the story might have
been tongue-in-cheek, but it was
misguided nonetheless. Still. Her
bert's actions did not occur in a vac
uum. A Daily stall reporter wrote
the article, a news desk editor pre
sumably scrutinized it line by line,
and l it/gerald approved it before it
went to print. Not to target l ilzger
ald, who openly admits he made a
mistake, but if 1 lohmann truly be
lieves that the editor in chief is "re
sponsible for all content in the news
paper." why does he hold his prede
cessor to a different standard?

Moreover, to pretend that a mis
leading story about a squash team's
plane ride was a shocking anomaly in
an otherwise ethically impeccable
newspaper is disingenuous lhe I >ail\
is a college paper. Il regularly runs
joke articles in its news pages, includ
ing a recent one about llohmanns
election as editor ("I lohmann seizes
Daily reins in coup," Jan. 'llie tag
lines at the bottom of its stall-written
opinion columns often contain hu
morous fabrications. In the context of
this blurry line between news and
satire. Herbert's firing appears arbi
trary and unjust. Such scapegoating
won't solve Ihe Daily's credibility
problems.

I lie Daily, like other college
newspapers, occupies an unusual po
sition. It is both a newspaper of
record for the campus and a learning
environment for the students who
contribute to it. Herbert made mis
takes in the squash story So did oth
ers. We urge I lohmann and the rest
of Ihe Daily staff to stop the blame
game and treat the embarrassing
saga as a learning opportunity for all
involved.
