## Women's hoops keeps rolling Wiggins injured in Stanford's 80-54 win over Huskies 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Maples Pavilion fell silent as 3,885 pairs of eyes watched yet
another Stanford guard fall to the ground after driving the lane.
Iliis time it was Candice Wiggins, who needed assistance off the
court and never returned to the game. Just after passing her ca
reer 1,700-point mark, Wiggins' lay-up attempt was good, but the
junior came down in traffic, spraining her right ankle for the sec
ond time this season.
In her 32-minute appearance, Wiggins led the team in scoring
with 23 points as the Cardinal (21-4.13-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
rolled over Washington (15-11,8-7). 80-54. Head coach Tara Van-
Derveer noted Wiggins' contribution as one of the key factors in
sparking the team's win.
"Candice had an excellent floor game," VanDerveer said.

Jayne Appel (eight
points, eight rebounds) and senior kristen Newlin (12 points,
nine rebounds). Senior Brooke Smith was the only forward to
meet the mark with 12 points and 12 boards.
VanDerveer praised the post players for their execution on
both sides of the ball, especially down low. where they out-re
bounded the I luskies 48-32.
"I think our post really stepped up big. scoring inside," Van-
Derveer said. "It's also great that we're a good rebounding team.
We want to be a great defensive team, and 1 think that it does start
with our'bigs." [Newlin] is one of our best rebounders, especially
an [offensivej-boarder. She's got a knack for the ball, she goes
and finds it. and scores really well."
Throughout the game, the Cardinal kept Washington guard
Cameo Hicks quiet. She registered only eight points — a steep
decrease from her 18-point season scoring average. With 3:31 to
go in the first half, though. I licks pulled down an offensive board,
which she dished to fellow guard Emily Florence. Florence hit a
three-pointer that pulled the Huskies within seven.
Soon after the break, Stanford tound Wiggins for back-to
back three-pointers, and the Cardinal widened its lead to as much
as 27. Although Florence finished leading Washington with 11
points, four assists, eight rebounds and three steals, the Huskies
were never again able to close the margin to fewer than nine.
When Wiggins left with 7:59 to play, it was freshman Melanie
Murphy's turn to lead the backeourt. Midway through the peri
od. Murphy powered her way through the lane tor three layups
in two minutes,contributing to her 11 -point.eight-assist perform
ance. VanDerveer was confident that Murphy would continue to
produce for the team.
" Hiis was a breakout game for [Murphy], VanDerveer said.
"She was definitely the difference tor us. She handled the ball re
ally well, and she did a great job of getting it inside. I'm really
proud of her and really excited
for our team. She just needed
this opportunity, and she look
advantage of it. She's just going
to get better."
Murphy said that her confi
dence grew over the course of
the game, but her self-assurance
was also due to the confidence
the rest of the team showed
throughout the week.
"1 think it was good that 1 got
the opportunity [to step up
today]," Murphy said. "A lot of
my teammates spoke to me and
showed that they had confidence
in me. lhat enabled me to feel
that 1 could do it.and to try my
best to do what I could in the
game."
As the Pae-lO season winds
down. VanDerveer knows that

Stanford will be unable to rely
solely on Murphy or any other
individual players. She empha
sized the need for offensive vari
etv and balanee down the
stretch.
"We need different people to
step up for us. and that's just the
nature of it," VanDerveer said.
"With C'andice's situation, if
she's out for the next couple
games or the next couple weeks,
other people just really need to
step in and do it for us. I don't
know that there's any other
choice."
However, VanDerveer still
believed that the win was well
deserved and well-earned.
"1 think that considering
what our team has been
through. I really couldn't have
asked for much more from peo
ple than what they gave today,"
she said.

nature of it," VanDerveer said.
"With C'andice's situation, if
she's out for the next couple
games or the next couple weeks,
other people just really need to
step in and do it for us. I don't
know that there's any other
choice."
However, VanDerveer still
believed that the win was well
deserved and well-earned.
"1 think that considering
what our team has been
through. I really couldn't have
asked for much more from peo
ple than what they gave today,"
she said.
