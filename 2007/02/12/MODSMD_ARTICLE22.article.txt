Maples Pavilion fell silent as 3,885 pairs of eyes watched yet
another Stanford guard fall to the ground after driving the lane.
Iliis time it was Candice Wiggins, who needed assistance off the
court and never returned to the game. Just after passing her ca
reer 1,700-point mark, Wiggins' lay-up attempt was good, but the
junior came down in traffic, spraining her right ankle for the sec
ond time this season.
In her 32-minute appearance, Wiggins led the team in scoring
with 23 points as the Cardinal (21-4.13-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
rolled over Washington (15-11,8-7). 80-54. Head coach Tara Van-
Derveer noted Wiggins' contribution as one of the key factors in
sparking the team's win.
"Candice had an excellent floor game," VanDerveer said.
