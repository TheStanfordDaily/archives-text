## No. 25 men's basketball drops huge loss to Washington 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal entered Sunday's
game against Washington with a
chance to grab third place in the Pa
cific 10 Conference. Instead, the
team played give-away in the second
half, committing 10 turnovers and
shooting just 25 percent from the
field for the period to lose to the
I luskies, 64-52.
The No. 25 Stanford men's bas
ketball team came away empty
handed from its trip to Washington
after losing to No. 14 Washington
State on Thursday, and it fell to sixth
in the tight Pac-10 race.
The team also lost its second
leading scorer, sophomore guard
Anthony Goods, who went down
with a twisted ankle midway
through the second period after
pulling down an offensive rebound.
I le spent the rest of the game on the
bench with an ice pack, but the ex
tent of Goods' injury is unclear.
Stanford (15-8,7-5 Pac-10) made
only one shot from the field over a
13-minute stretch early in the sec
ond half, allowing Washington (16-8,
6-7 Pac-10) to pull away for a deci
sive 18-3 run. The Huskies also
played anemically on the offensive
end in the second period, shooting
only 27 percent. That allowed the
Cardinal to stay within five with less
than 10 minutes to play.
Hut Washington proceeded to put
the game away, taking a 60-41 lead at
the three-minute mark.
In a sloppy game, the Cardinal

committed as many turnovers as

The win allowed the Huskies,
