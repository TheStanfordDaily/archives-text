# Card sweep Bulldogs in short series
## Baseball battles tough weather, wins two at home 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A week after the Cardinal struggled
to put together a complete nine-inning
effort at Fullerton, Stanford baseball
showed improvement in all three phases
of its game by winning both games of a
rain-shortened set against Fresno State
with margins of 9-2 and 6-4.
"1 think we hit the ball a little bit bet
ter." head coach Mark Marquess said."lt
was still a little sloppy, but its early in the
year. 'ITiey made a couple errors that
helped us, but we took advantage of
them."
After a Friday rainout, the Cardinal
(2-3) opened Saturday with junior Nolan
Gallagher. The junior righty got the
bounce-back game he needed after last
week's 11-5 loss, as he struck out the last
two batters he faced (4 IP, 4 H. 1 ER, 4
SO, 1 BB) Saturday. Rain closed in after
the fourth, however, postponing the
game's conclusion to a Sunday double
header and ending Gallagher's run.
Fellow starter Jeff Inman (1-0. 5.59
ERA) got the unusual "relief'start pick
ing up the win with effective control. In
heriting a 6-1 lead. Inman allowed no
walks and only six hits over five innings.
The freshman closed his first career win
with his fifth strikeout of the game.
"The thing we didn't do that helped

us is we didn't have a walk in the second
game." Marquess said. "When you walk
them, and then they get those hits in.
they're able to score runs: we're fortu
nate we didn't walk anyone."
On both days, Stanford was oppor
tunistic. Junior Brian Juhl (2-4) reached
on an error by the Bulldogs' (15. ()-()

VVAC) second basomen. scoring sopho
more Sean Ratlilf to tie the game in the
first. 1-1. Freshman Toby Gerhart (2-5,3
RBI) hit a two-out ground ball hard to
the left side of the infield to score sopho
more Cord Phelps and extend the lead to
7-1 in the fifth.
"We're definitely taking advantage of

mistakes." Juhl said. "It's really impor
tant.espedally since errors don't happen
that often.so when they do. you got totry
to score some runs off of those."
'ITie final blow came in the sixth when
freshman Adam (jaylord (2-4,2 RBI) hit

Junior catcher Brian Juhl went 2-4 with one run in Sunday s vicrtory over Fresno State. Stanford s match with the Bulldogs ended
prematurely after four complete innings Saturday, due to rain,
an RBI double down the right-field
line, (iavlord would advance to third
on the throw to home, only to score
after the catcher failed to corral the
relay and the ball went into the (ardi
nal dugout.
(ierhart also hit the first home run
at Stanford this year, a two-out, three
run job homer in the bottom of the
third to extend the Stanford lead to 6-
1 before the rain delay.
Having squandered a lour-run
lead in the fourth, the ('ardinal would
score the eventual game-winning runs
on a bizarre play in the sixth inning.
Willi sophomore Brent Milleville
and senior Ryan Seawell on first and
second, with two outs and the game
tied at four. Juhl hit a grounder right
back up the middle. Bulldog short
stop Todd Sandell would mull his
fielding attempt and the ball would
squirt into tile outfield. Fresno State
second baseman Irik Wet/.el recov
ered the ball quickly, however, catch
ing Seawell between second and
third, while Milleville stayed at third.
Wet/el threw to third, attempting
to catch one of the runners and
Milleville broke for home. After an
other throw of the ball, the ('ardinal
first baseman and the catcher would
arrive all at the same time. Milleville
knocked into Ryan ()verland.and the
ball rolled toward the backstop. Sea
well. running the whole time, would
sneak in for the insurance run.
"I don't know what happened."
Marquess said. "I don't know if coach
Stot/ sent him and then he stopped,
or whatever. Ihat was a baserunning
mistake on our part... Bui it was craz\
and it helped us. We'll take it."
Stanford had built a 4-0 lead in the
first with a string ol six singles made
possible by a single hustle play from
sophomore Joey August (1-2). With
two (Hits and men on second and

third. August beat out the pitcher to
the bag on a ehopper to second base.
Iwo runs would score on the play that
the team termed "critical."
'Ihe ('ardinal showed some defen
sive flare in the middle innings. In the
top of the second. August snagged a
rocket and then tagged first for the
unassisted inning-ending double play.
Phelps tried to one-up his team with a
sliding catch in foul ground, where he
slammed into the fence along the
third baseline in the following inning.
"In my warm-ups I like to look be
hind me. make sure they're all set and
remind myself of how talented these
guys are," reliever junior David
Stringer said.
But it was a defensive slipup — a
fielding error on second baseman
sophomore Austin Yount with no one
out — that opened the door to let the
Bulldogs back in the game. Sopho
more lefty Jeremy Bleieli cruised
unlil that point, but he would eventu
ally give up four runs and leave with a
no-decision (4.1 IP.SH)

A week after the Cardinal struggled
to put together a complete nine-inning
effort at Fullerton, Stanford baseball
showed improvement in all three phases
of its game by winning both games of a
rain-shortened set against Fresno State
with margins of 9-2 and 6-4.
"1 think we hit the ball a little bit bet
ter." head coach Mark Marquess said."lt
was still a little sloppy, but its early in the
year. 'ITiey made a couple errors that
helped us, but we took advantage of
them."
After a Friday rainout, the Cardinal
(2-3) opened Saturday with junior Nolan
Gallagher. The junior righty got the
bounce-back game he needed after last
week's 11-5 loss, as he struck out the last
two batters he faced (4 IP, 4 H. 1 ER, 4
SO, 1 BB) Saturday. Rain closed in after
the fourth, however, postponing the
game's conclusion to a Sunday double
header and ending Gallagher's run.
Fellow starter Jeff Inman (1-0. 5.59
ERA) got the unusual "relief'start pick
ing up the win with effective control. In
heriting a 6-1 lead. Inman allowed no
walks and only six hits over five innings.
The freshman closed his first career win
with his fifth strikeout of the game.
"The thing we didn't do that helped

us is we didn't have a walk in the second
game." Marquess said. "When you walk
them, and then they get those hits in.
they're able to score runs: we're fortu
nate we didn't walk anyone."
On both days, Stanford was oppor
tunistic. Junior Brian Juhl (2-4) reached
on an error by the Bulldogs' (15. ()-()

VVAC) second basomen. scoring sopho
more Sean Ratlilf to tie the game in the
first. 1-1. Freshman Toby Gerhart (2-5,3
RBI) hit a two-out ground ball hard to
the left side of the infield to score sopho
more Cord Phelps and extend the lead to
7-1 in the fifth.
"We're definitely taking advantage of

mistakes." Juhl said. "It's really impor
tant.espedally since errors don't happen
that often.so when they do. you got totry
to score some runs off of those."

MICHAEL RAMM/The Stanford Daily
Junior catcher Brian Juhl went 2-4 with one run in Sunday s vicrtory over Fresno State. Stanford s match with the Bulldogs ended
prematurely after four complete innings Saturday, due to rain,
an RBI double down the right-field
line, (iavlord would advance to third
on the throw to home, only to score
after the catcher failed to corral the
relay and the ball went into the (ardi
nal dugout.
(ierhart also hit the first home run
at Stanford this year, a two-out, three
run job homer in the bottom of the
third to extend the Stanford lead to 6-
1 before the rain delay.
Having squandered a lour-run
lead in the fourth, the ('ardinal would
score the eventual game-winning runs
on a bizarre play in the sixth inning.
Willi sophomore Brent Milleville
and senior Ryan Seawell on first and
second, with two outs and the game
tied at four. Juhl hit a grounder right
back up the middle. Bulldog short
stop Todd Sandell would mull his
fielding attempt and the ball would
squirt into tile outfield. Fresno State
second baseman Irik Wet/.el recov
ered the ball quickly, however, catch
ing Seawell between second and
third, while Milleville stayed at third.
Wet/el threw to third, attempting
to catch one of the runners and
Milleville broke for home. After an
other throw of the ball, the ('ardinal
first baseman and the catcher would
arrive all at the same time. Milleville
knocked into Ryan ()verland.and the
ball rolled toward the backstop. Sea
well. running the whole time, would
sneak in for the insurance run.
"I don't know what happened."
Marquess said. "I don't know if coach
Stot/ sent him and then he stopped,
or whatever. Ihat was a baserunning
mistake on our part... Bui it was craz\
and it helped us. We'll take it."
Stanford had built a 4-0 lead in the
first with a string ol six singles made
possible by a single hustle play from
sophomore Joey August (1-2). With
two (Hits and men on second and

third. August beat out the pitcher to
the bag on a ehopper to second base.
Iwo runs would score on the play that
the team termed "critical."
'Ihe ('ardinal showed some defen
sive flare in the middle innings. In the
top of the second. August snagged a
rocket and then tagged first for the
unassisted inning-ending double play.
Phelps tried to one-up his team with a
sliding catch in foul ground, where he
slammed into the fence along the
third baseline in the following inning.
"In my warm-ups I like to look be
hind me. make sure they're all set and
remind myself of how talented these
guys are," reliever junior David
Stringer said.
But it was a defensive slipup — a
fielding error on second baseman
sophomore Austin Yount with no one
out — that opened the door to let the
Bulldogs back in the game. Sopho
more lefty Jeremy Bleieli cruised
unlil that point, but he would eventu
ally give up four runs and leave with a
no-decision (4.1 IP.SH)
Sophomore reliever Max

threw three straight balls to the first
batter he faced. Bui he settled down,
got a swinging strikeout and a pop out
to second to end the inning en route
to the win.
Palo Alto native Stringer threw
three innings of two-hit ball for the
save.'lhe staff as a whole gave up no
walks in the game, and only one on
the weekend.
"I didn't even know that." Juhl
said. "We preach on that a lot. I ree

lead in the fourth, the ('ardinal would
score the eventual game-winning runs
on a bizarre play in the sixth inning.
Willi sophomore Brent Milleville
and senior Ryan Seawell on first and
second, with two outs and the game
tied at four. Juhl hit a grounder right
back up the middle. Bulldog short
stop Todd Sandell would mull his
fielding attempt and the ball would
squirt into tile outfield. Fresno State
second baseman Irik Wet/.el recov
ered the ball quickly, however, catch
ing Seawell between second and
third, while Milleville stayed at third.
Wet/el threw to third, attempting
to catch one of the runners and
Milleville broke for home. After an
other throw of the ball, the ('ardinal
first baseman and the catcher would
arrive all at the same time. Milleville
knocked into Ryan ()verland.and the
ball rolled toward the backstop. Sea
well. running the whole time, would
sneak in for the insurance run.
"I don't know what happened."
Marquess said. "I don't know if coach
Stot/ sent him and then he stopped,
or whatever. Ihat was a baserunning
mistake on our part... Bui it was craz\
and it helped us. We'll take it."
Stanford had built a 4-0 lead in the
first with a string ol six singles made
possible by a single hustle play from
sophomore Joey August (1-2). With
two (Hits and men on second and

third. August beat out the pitcher to
the bag on a ehopper to second base.
Iwo runs would score on the play that
the team termed "critical."
'Ihe ('ardinal showed some defen
sive flare in the middle innings. In the
top of the second. August snagged a
rocket and then tagged first for the
unassisted inning-ending double play.
Phelps tried to one-up his team with a
sliding catch in foul ground, where he
slammed into the fence along the
third baseline in the following inning.
"In my warm-ups I like to look be
hind me. make sure they're all set and
remind myself of how talented these
guys are," reliever junior David
Stringer said.
But it was a defensive slipup — a
fielding error on second baseman
sophomore Austin Yount with no one
out — that opened the door to let the
Bulldogs back in the game. Sopho
more lefty Jeremy Bleieli cruised
unlil that point, but he would eventu
ally give up four runs and leave with a
no-decision (4.1 IP.SH)
Sophomore reliever Max
1 eamow (1-1. 2.05) came in and
threw three straight balls to the first
batter he faced. Bui he settled down,
got a swinging strikeout and a pop out
to second to end the inning en route
to the win.
Palo Alto native Stringer threw
three innings of two-hit ball for the
save.'lhe staff as a whole gave up no
walks in the game, and only one on
the weekend.
"I didn't even know that." Juhl
said. "We preach on that a lot. I ree
passes kill you in baseball, so that's
dcfinitel\ a big positive. We definitely
bounced back, and we gol some good
timely pitching when we needed il
I his weekend."
'Ihe third game of the series was
rescheduled for April 25. with the
starting pitch time to be announced
later.
Ihe Cardinal will next play in an
exhibition on Sunken Diamond
against Rikkyo University of Japan
this Tuesday at 2 p.m. before heading
