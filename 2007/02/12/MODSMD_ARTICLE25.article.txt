A week after the Cardinal struggled
to put together a complete nine-inning
effort at Fullerton, Stanford baseball
showed improvement in all three phases
of its game by winning both games of a
rain-shortened set against Fresno State
with margins of 9-2 and 6-4.
"1 think we hit the ball a little bit bet

was still a little sloppy, but its early in the
year. 'ITiey made a couple errors that
helped us, but we took advantage of
them."
After a Friday rainout, the Cardinal
(2-3) opened Saturday with junior Nolan
Gallagher. The junior righty got the
bounce-back game he needed after last
week's 11-5 loss, as he struck out the last
two batters he faced (4 IP, 4 H. 1 ER, 4
SO, 1 BB) Saturday. Rain closed in after
the fourth, however, postponing the
game's conclusion to a Sunday double
header and ending Gallagher's run.
Fellow starter Jeff Inman (1-0. 5.59
ERA) got the unusual "relief'start pick
ing up the win with effective control. In
heriting a 6-1 lead. Inman allowed no
walks and only six hits over five innings.
The freshman closed his first career win
with his fifth strikeout of the game.

us is we didn't have a walk in the second
game." Marquess said. "When you walk
them, and then they get those hits in.
they're able to score runs: we're fortu

7-1 in the fifth.
"We're definitely taking advantage of

mistakes." Juhl said. "It's really impor

that often.so when they do. you got totry
to score some runs off of those."
