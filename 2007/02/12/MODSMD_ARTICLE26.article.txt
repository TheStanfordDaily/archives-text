dinal pulled within one on Ilaber's
homer to right-center. Northwestern
quickly answered in the seventh on
freshman Nicole Pauly's round-trip
per to left.
"In the Northwestern game, we
only had three hits but we still had op
portunities." Rittman said. "Really, in
that game, a timely hitter might have
changed the final score."
Stanford could not overcome the
two-run deficit, losing 1-3.'llie team's
three hits and one run on the day
squandered IVnna s second complete
game and her record-tying lfi-strike
out performance.
Against lexas. the Cardinal of
lense was able to produce more hits
but couldn't produce a win. In the

lirst. Stanford strung together three
straight singles, but could not drive
any runners home. Instead, 'lexas
built up a 6-1 lead at the end of the
second.
In the sixth, the Cardinal pulled
within one run on a sacrifice fly by

live RBI. and Henna pitched her first
shutout of the season with six strike
outs
Despite a dominating perform
ance by their offense and pitching

staff, the Cardinal leave the Classic
with a disappointing 3-2 record.
Rittman acknowledges that there is
some fine-tuning to be done.
"After reflecting on the weekend,
there's a lot of things we can build on
and areas of improvement, but over
all we played pretty well," he said.
"For the most part, we need to im
prove our defense a little bit. pitch
better and get a few more timely hits."
Considering Henna's dominating
performance this weekend and the
more-than-often powerful Cardinal
offense. Rittman isn't worried about
his team.
"We're a very talented team top to
bottom," Rittman said. "It seemed
like every other game somebody was
coming through for us. and we're
going to need it in the long run be
cause we can't rely on one or two
players offensively for the whole sea
son.
"'lhe biggest thing for us is that we
saw some very good pitching this
weekend, and I thought our kids did
really well." Rittman added.
Stanford hosts Sacramento State
on Tuesday, and then the Stanford In
vitational. Friday through Sunday.
Alter the home-stand, the Cardinal
will start a two-week road trip, includ
ing Cal State-Fullerton and another
encounter with Northwestern.
