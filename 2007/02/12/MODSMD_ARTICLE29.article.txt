### SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With their performance at this
weekend's Pacific-10 Conference Div
ing Championships in Federal Way,
Wash., the top-ranked Stanford divers
made a major statement in the Cardi
nal's effort to take the Pac-10 women's
swimming and diving title.
The divers' points will be added to
the swim team's score following next
weekend's Pac-10 Swimming ("hampi
onships to determine which team wins
the conference title.
ITie Cardinal divers were led by
senior and five-time Ail-American
Cassidy Krug, who was named
Women's Diver of the Meet after tak
ing first place in both Friday's three
meter event and Saturday's one-meter
competition.The victories were Krug's

second and third career Pac-10 titles.
Krug scored 367.30 points in the
three-meter event, soundly topping
her nearest competitor, I J( 'I.A sopho
more Marisa Samaniego, by 43.10
points.
"It felt really good." King said. "In
the finals today.it was the best I've felt
all year. I've been working on technical
things to help me do my dives better,
and I was able to do that better in the
finals today than I have in a while."
Despite expressing some pre-meet
doubts about Krug's ability to bring
her competition up to the next level.
Stanford head diving coach Dr. Kick
Schavone said he was satisfied with
Krug's performance on Friday.
"I'm really pleased with where she
is right now," Schavone said. " Ibday
was a really big step forward for ( as
sidy. UCLA threw three big divers at
her. and she dominated them."
Krug continued to out-dive the
Bruins on Saturday, when she scored
293.45 points to take the one-meter
event. Ihe one-meter win was not as

convincing as King's three-meter title,
as she attempted a pair of new dives
with a high difficulty and beat
Samaniego by just 6.05 points. Krug es
pecially struggled on her fourth dive,
but regained the lead with her fifth and
sixth attempts. I ler fifth was an inward
two-and-a-half somersault, and she
followed it with a reverse.
"It wasn't pretty, but 1 got the job
done." King said. "Trying the dives I
(.lid definitely put pressure on my other
di\es today. 1 here are definitely things
to still work on and things I could have
done better."
Schavone did not seem concerned
by King's performance on the new
dives.
"We tried a couple of dives that no
other women's diver in the world does
to see it she could be ready for the
N( AAs." he said."(Mherwise. she was
fine and handled the added pressure
well."
Junior Katie Lampe was Stanford's
other top point-scorer at the meet.
Lampe reached the finals in all three of

the weekend's events: the three-meter,
one-meter and platform. She finished
fifth in the three-meter with 292.60
points, sixth in the one-meter with
258.80 points and fourth in the plat
form with 242.85 points.

the group of finalists for the ("ardinal.

event with a score of 259.30 points.

nals when she finished ninth in the pre
lims with 244.95 points. Freshman ( ar
men Stellar and Karp finished 16th and
18th, respectively, in their prelim dives.
