# 5-SURE adds online service
## Organizers hope feature will make service more interactive and user-friendly 
### ARAM HUR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For party goers and late night library
dwellers alike, the ride back home may be
come progressively faster and safer as 5-
SURE.the rape prevention service on cam
pus that handles about 1,600 requests per
quarter, went digital last Wednesday.
As a complementary addition to the ex
isting call in service, the new online feature
allows students to complete the process of
registering, scheduling and canceling rides
with the click of a mouse. It also includes a
feedback option and indicates the number
of rides scheduled prior to the last request,
in an attempt to make the service more in
teractive and user-friendly.
The idea — which is the brainchild of 5-
SURE co-Manager Eric Frenkiel '08 —
was first conceived in late September as
part of a larger plan to develop a 5-SURE
Web site. According to co-Manager Andrea
Romero '09. the Web site was originally de
signed as an informational system with
links to groups similarly dedicated to cam
pus safety.
"During the brainstorming of the Web
site, we also thought it would be appropri-
ate to be able to request a ride online
for those who have limited cell
phone service inside buildings or
those in meetings," Romero said.
"1 built the Web site with the in
tention of strengthening our mission
to pick up single riders from their
dorms or libraries," Frenkiel said."lf
someone is studying at a friend's or is
at the library, it is much more con
venient to log on than to phone in."
With the approval of Jeanette
Smith-Laws, assistant dean of meet
ing services and overseer of 5-
Sl RE, Frenkiel began coding the
program and finished shortly before
Thanksgiving. It was only after sev
eral weeks of alpha-testing that the
service went live last week.
"The real benefits of the Web site
are being felt within the 5-SURE or
ganization." Frenkiel said. "The Web
site has multiple checks to ensure

that we collect all the information
needed to fulfill the ride."
Frenkiel said the time he spent
creating the Web site has been worth
it.
"Making Stanford a safer place to
live, work and study is what drives
many of us at 5-SURE to work those
long and late hours," he said. "The
Web site was well worth the hard
work because I'm happy to have
been able to contribute back to the
community."
While it is too early to tell if the
new service will appeal to users, stu
dents have mixed opinions on the
Web site's value.
"I think it depends on how users
have been using it in the past." said
Soo Kim '08. "If they've been using
5-SURE to get home from the li
brary, the digitalization will be a
huge help, but a lot of people 1 know
use 5-SURE: to get to and from par
ties, when they're usually out some
where withoui a computer."
Charles Guan "08 also expressed
skepticism at the value of the im
provements.

"I can definitely see how it will he
beneficial for within 5-SURE in
terms of organization and efficien
cy.* he said. "But we, from the user
side, don't see those benefits as
much. I think most people are going
to stick to their old habits of calling."
Frenkiel said that 5-SURE is
preparing to publicize its new digital
branch through fliers and by visiting
house meetings in the upcoming
weeks. I le added that he has more
ideas for improvement.
"In the next month or so, I plan to
also add an .SMS texting feature, so
that users can call, text or log on —
whatever they want," he said.
Students can use 5-SURE's on
line features only during normal
business hours. During winter quar
ter. they are: Monday to Thursday, 8
p.m. to 2 a.m.; Friday and Saturday, 8
p.m. to 3 a.m.
