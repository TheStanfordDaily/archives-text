## Racial theme parties draw criticism 
### ARAM HUR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
White men in shirts reading, "1
love chicken"; a girl dressed in a red
and-white checkered apron posinu
with Aunt Jemima syrup in hand; oth
ers dressed in gangster clothes and
sporting afro wigs.
Such were the pictures of a Tar
leton State University (Stephenville,
Tex.) "ghetto fabulous" party hosted
on Martin Luther Kingjr. Day. Simi
lar photos surfaced after parties at
the University of Connecticut. Uni
versity of Chicago, Cornell and Texas
A&M. where non-minority students
dressed and acted "ghetto."
Racially-charged theme parties
are a growing trend on college cam
puses nationwide and. some argue,
representative of deep racial igno
rance.
"These parties are not isolated in
cidents," said Sociology Prof.
Lawrence Bobo, director of the Cen
ter for Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity. "They are sympto
matic of a much deeper problem in
our society and culture, one that man
ifests itself in many ways."
Although racially-themed parties
have drawn criticism from the
NAACP and other African Ameri
can leaders, the national trend does
not appear to be subsiding. At Stan

ford, the Black Student Union (BSU)
recently hosted a talk that attracted
about 65 to 70 attendees to discuss
the issue and to provide a forum for
community reaction.
"A lot of people were shocked at
first,because they hadn't seen a lot of
the things we were showing and got
angry," said BSU member Macarrin
Morton "07. "I was particularly both
ered by people who talk about color
blindness and that people need to
start looking past race."
Others said these parties were
probably hosted with harmless inten

tions.
Bobo suggested that the parties
were analogous to children dressing
up as black disco-goers or Asian
Kung Fu fighters for 1 lalloween.
"This all might be different if neg
ative racial stereotypes had not been
an important part of practices of
racial oppression and discrimination
in the American past." he said. "This
all might be different if negative
racial stereotypes no longer influ
enced social behavior today. Unfor
tunately, neither of these hypotheti
cal scenarios is true."
Bobo gave a historical explana
tion for a blind, deaf and mute atti
tude toward race.
"As a society, our culture, material
economic arrangements and institu
tions of law and politics were power
fully structured by earlier years of
systematic racial discrimination and
bias." he said. "We have made enor
mous progress but we remain a very
long distance from being a society
where race does not matter. So. un
fortunately, we live in a time domi
nated by rhetoric calling for color
blindness and the insistence that race
is an irrelevance."
At their meeting, BSU members
discussed the possibility of using the
personal injury clause of the First
Amendment to the Constitution to
place a legal ban on racially charged

parties.
"We want to ensure these things
don't happen because they're ridicu
lous," Morton said.
While these parties have yet to
pop up on the Stanford social scene,
officials agreed on the necessity of
promoting awareness at the Univer
sity.
"1 think we need to have a lot
more intercultural communication
taught in the extracurriculum so that
people would know when and where
they may be crossing the line." said
Thom Massey, a student affairs offi
cer in the Dean of Students office. "1
am trying to put together a set of
workshops based on understanding
the new school of social and cultural
engagement."
Hobo agreed with Massey that di
versity and student awareness were
necessary for the creation of an at
mosphere of acceptance on campus.
"We need to continue and redou
ble our efforts at creating a diverse
student body," he said. "The same
must happen at the levels of graduate
students, faculty and staff. We need to
continue and redouble our insistence
that all students receive significant
curricular exposure to courses with
diverse racial and ethnic content."
