Registrar Roger Printup will retire this June, im

retiring from his position as a Resident Fellow
(RF) in Larkin. A search for his successor is cur
rently underway.
"It is hard to overestimate Roger Printup's im
pact on the Stanford community," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman in an
email to The Daily. "Roger serves the University
with the utmost in professionalism and the highest
standards. 1 le is a wonderful source of institution
al knowledge.To me he is the quintessential regis
trar, from his ever present necktie to his dry, eru

dite wit. I know he will be sorely missed by all his
colleagues."
Printup —who served as the registrar for the
University of Virginia for 11 years before arriving
at Stanford recalled being excited by the rich
assortment of people, cultures and world views he
discovered at the University.
"You get the feeling that this is what other parts
of the world will be like 50 years from now. but we
get to experience it all today." he said.
As Registrar. Printup's greatest challenge
and one of his foremost accomplishments — was
moving manual, paper-intensive clerical opera
tions to electronic systems that enable registrar-re
lated activities to take place 24 hours a day.
"In a world of instant messaging, we could
never go back to the way things were when I first
started working in universities." Printup said. " The
expectation of students, as well as faculty and staff,
is that (services like Axess| will be available to
them."
Boardman described Printup's leadership as
"essential" during the University's transition to

"As Registrar, Roger has successfully managed
a fundamental transformation in the way that his
office conducts business," Boardman said.
Printup said that his experience as an RF in
Larkin an all-freshman residence hall where he
and his wife, Georgia, have worked for the past
four years — have complemented his services as
Registrar.
"Being an RF has allowed my wife and I the op
portunity to know Stanford students in ways that
are just not possible if you just work eight hours
and day and leave campus at the end of the day,"
Printup said. "There have been things that I have
changed in the Registrar's Office because of what
I have learned about what works and what does
not work with students."
Printup said he found it "particularly satisfy
ing" to watch students he knew as freshmen in
