### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a 14-year career at Stanford, University
Registrar Roger Printup will retire this June, im
mediately after Commencement. He will also he
retiring from his position as a Resident Fellow
(RF) in Larkin. A search for his successor is cur
rently underway.
"It is hard to overestimate Roger Printup's im
pact on the Stanford community," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman in an
email to The Daily. "Roger serves the University
with the utmost in professionalism and the highest
standards. 1 le is a wonderful source of institution
al knowledge.To me he is the quintessential regis
trar, from his ever present necktie to his dry, eru

dite wit. I know he will be sorely missed by all his
colleagues."
Printup —who served as the registrar for the
University of Virginia for 11 years before arriving
at Stanford recalled being excited by the rich
assortment of people, cultures and world views he
discovered at the University.
"You get the feeling that this is what other parts
of the world will be like 50 years from now. but we
get to experience it all today." he said.
As Registrar. Printup's greatest challenge
and one of his foremost accomplishments — was
moving manual, paper-intensive clerical opera
tions to electronic systems that enable registrar-re
lated activities to take place 24 hours a day.
"In a world of instant messaging, we could
never go back to the way things were when I first
started working in universities." Printup said. " The
expectation of students, as well as faculty and staff,
is that (services like Axess| will be available to
them."
Boardman described Printup's leadership as
"essential" during the University's transition to

electronic records and the People Soft student ad
ministrative system
"As Registrar, Roger has successfully managed
a fundamental transformation in the way that his
office conducts business," Boardman said.
Printup said that his experience as an RF in
Larkin an all-freshman residence hall where he
and his wife, Georgia, have worked for the past
four years — have complemented his services as
Registrar.
"Being an RF has allowed my wife and I the op
portunity to know Stanford students in ways that
are just not possible if you just work eight hours
and day and leave campus at the end of the day,"
Printup said. "There have been things that I have
changed in the Registrar's Office because of what
I have learned about what works and what does
not work with students."
Printup said he found it "particularly satisfy
ing" to watch students he knew as freshmen in
Larkin excel as upperclassmen in
leadership, academics and athletics
at the University.
Larkin residents and staff said
they will miss having the support of
the Printups.
"I'm definitely going to miss
them when they retire," said Larkin
Head Peer Academic Coordinator
(HPAC) Nila Bala 'OS."Roger is re
ally great to work with as an Rl .This
year Roger and Georgia brought [a
program called] Discover Stanford
to Larkin, which has been a great
source of information for the resi
dents about the history of Stanford."
Boardman said he expects the
committee in charge of finding
Printup's replacement will hire a
new Registrar later this year.
"The search committee, which 1
am chairing, has met several times,
and we hope to have a new Regis
trar in place during the summer." he
said.
Printup said that adaptability is
crucial to being a successful regis
trar.
"Stanford never stays the same
for very long." he said. "I call it 'man
aging in the nanosecond.' Anyone
who is inflexible would be very un
happy here."
When he retires, Printup said he
will take advantage of the free time
to relax and get some reading done.
But he but did not discount the pos
sibility of returning to academia in
the future.
"1 plan to spend about six
months adjusting to not working,
not having to worry about the next
meeting, the next pile of emails, the
next student crisis." he said. "II I
find I miss all of that after six
months, 1 will consider getting back
in the game somehow."
