# Guest House workers walk out
## University defends its policies toward temporary workers 
### AMIT ARORA CHRISTIAN L. TOM 
Five of the Stanford Guest
House's 20 workers expressed dis
satisfaction with their jobs in a pow
erful way late last month — using
their feet.
Four temporary workers — em
ployed by Manpower as front desk
staff at the hotel — asked for reas
signment after one University em
ployee. the front desk supervisor,
abruptly resigned.
Citing fundamental concerns
with ongoing staff reorganization
and the treatment of temporary
workers at the hotel, these workers
hoped to send the message to their
employer that what they deemed to
be marginalization would no longer
be tolerated. Guest I louse manage
ment and Student Housing admin
istrators expressed surprise with
the workers' unhappiness and said
they were shocked to find their staff
considerably depleted at the end of
January.
I lli: ROOTS OF DISCONTENT
On Sept. 11. 2006, Jonathan
Faulkner, formerly general manager
of the UCLA Guest House, began
his new job as general manger of the
Stanford Guest I louse, the fourth
general manager in the last two years
at the hotel, which had previously
been associated with the Stanford
I inear Accelerator Center.
Iliree workers who left the Guest
House in January and two workers
who are still employed at the hotel
told The Daily that from day one of
Faulkner's term, it had become ap
parent their work environment had
taken a turn for the worse.
"[Faulkner] didn't bother to learn
our names or to even look at us." said
Kerry Stroud, a temporary worker
assigned the night shift at the front
desk for several months.
Hie University vehemently dis
putes this claim and other concerns
raised by the workers since the walk
out.
Zeb Feldman, the front desk su
pervisor and the only full-time I )ni
versity employee to resign from the
Guest I louse, shared Stroud's senti

ments.
"When he would go to his office,
he would just make a beeline." Feld
man said. "He wouldn't make eye
contact, and he wouldn't say 'hello'
to whoever was working at the front
desk."
Yet, the workers said they tolerat
ed Faulkner's attitude because they
hoped to apply for the two 1 A4-clas
sified positions that the previous
Guest House general manager, Re
becca Benaderet, reportedly said
would be posted in the fall.
The IA4 pay-structure classifica
tion used by Stanford Human Re
sources signaled that the position
would offer a starting salary of
$40,320 and up — far greater than
the approximately $28,000 annual
salary the temporary workers were
making at the time.
()n Jan. 17.2(X)7, Faulkner did not
post two IA4 salaries. Ile instead in
troduced four IA2 positions — jobs
that would offer starting salaries of
$30,880 and up.
Feeling overworked and under
valued. several temporary workers
said it was at this point that they
began to strongly consider asking for
reassignment from Manpower, ef
fectively terminating their employ
ment at the Guest I louse.
Feldman described a difference
in the way he and Faulkner expected
workers to be treated and said this
difference led him to resign in the
last week of January, a decision that
motivated the four temporary work
ers to leave their jobs over the next
two days.
By the end of January, five work
ers — 25 percent of the Guest 1 louse
staff —had either asked for reas
signment or quit.
FEELINGS OF SHOCK
While the workers expressed dis
satisfaction during Faulkner's tenure
at the Guest House. Student Hous
ing administrators and Faulkner
himself described the changes at the
hotel as positive and said they were
surprised that the workers decided
to leave.
"I am shocked," said Mike Van-
Fossen, University manager of Stu
dent Housing. "Some of these tem
porary employees we were definitely
thinking about when creating these
positions. We were absolutely dumb
founded that some of these employ
ees would ask for reassignment back
