# Guest House workers walk out
## University defends its policies toward temporary workers 
### AMIT ARORA CHRISTIAN L. TOM 
Five of the Stanford Guest
House's 20 workers expressed dis
satisfaction with their jobs in a pow
erful way late last month — using
their feet.
Four temporary workers — em
ployed by Manpower as front desk
staff at the hotel — asked for reas
signment after one University em
ployee. the front desk supervisor,
abruptly resigned.
Citing fundamental concerns
with ongoing staff reorganization
and the treatment of temporary
workers at the hotel, these workers
hoped to send the message to their
employer that what they deemed to
be marginalization would no longer
be tolerated. Guest I louse manage
ment and Student Housing admin
istrators expressed surprise with
the workers' unhappiness and said
they were shocked to find their staff
considerably depleted at the end of
January.
I lli: ROOTS OF DISCONTENT
On Sept. 11. 2006, Jonathan
Faulkner, formerly general manager
of the UCLA Guest House, began
his new job as general manger of the
Stanford Guest I louse, the fourth
general manager in the last two years
at the hotel, which had previously
been associated with the Stanford
I inear Accelerator Center.
Iliree workers who left the Guest
House in January and two workers
who are still employed at the hotel
told The Daily that from day one of
Faulkner's term, it had become ap
parent their work environment had
taken a turn for the worse.
"[Faulkner] didn't bother to learn
our names or to even look at us." said
Kerry Stroud, a temporary worker
assigned the night shift at the front
desk for several months.
Hie University vehemently dis
putes this claim and other concerns
raised by the workers since the walk
out.
Zeb Feldman, the front desk su
pervisor and the only full-time I )ni
versity employee to resign from the
Guest I louse, shared Stroud's senti

ments.
"When he would go to his office,
he would just make a beeline." Feld
man said. "He wouldn't make eye
contact, and he wouldn't say 'hello'
to whoever was working at the front
desk."
Yet, the workers said they tolerat
ed Faulkner's attitude because they
hoped to apply for the two 1 A4-clas
sified positions that the previous
Guest House general manager, Re
becca Benaderet, reportedly said
would be posted in the fall.
The IA4 pay-structure classifica
tion used by Stanford Human Re
sources signaled that the position
would offer a starting salary of
$40,320 and up — far greater than
the approximately $28,000 annual
salary the temporary workers were
making at the time.
()n Jan. 17.2(X)7, Faulkner did not
post two IA4 salaries. Ile instead in
troduced four IA2 positions — jobs
that would offer starting salaries of
$30,880 and up.
Feeling overworked and under
valued. several temporary workers
said it was at this point that they
began to strongly consider asking for
reassignment from Manpower, ef
fectively terminating their employ
ment at the Guest I louse.
Feldman described a difference
in the way he and Faulkner expected
workers to be treated and said this
difference led him to resign in the
last week of January, a decision that
motivated the four temporary work
ers to leave their jobs over the next
two days.
By the end of January, five work
ers — 25 percent of the Guest 1 louse
staff —had either asked for reas
signment or quit.
FEELINGS OF SHOCK
While the workers expressed dis
satisfaction during Faulkner's tenure
at the Guest House. Student Hous
ing administrators and Faulkner
himself described the changes at the
hotel as positive and said they were
surprised that the workers decided
to leave.
"I am shocked," said Mike Van-
Fossen, University manager of Stu
dent Housing. "Some of these tem
porary employees we were definitely
thinking about when creating these
positions. We were absolutely dumb
founded that some of these employ
ees would ask for reassignment back
at Manpower to remain being tempo
rary employees."
Faulkner said it was "regrettable"
and "unfortunate" that some of the
workers found his attitude unfriendly,
and he said he tried to ensure that
none of the workers were negatively
affected by the Guest 1 louse reorgan
ization he had planned. VanFossen
emphasized that none of the workers
were fired and, in fact, more positions
were introduced.
"Through this reorganization, we
have more full-time employees up
there," he said. "We are providing
more people the opportunity to get
excellent jobs. We made sure that we
took care of all the employees — both
full-time and temporary. None of
them were negatively affected in this.
None of them lost a job. None of them
lost a salary in this."
VanFossen also disagreed with the
workers' claim that they should have
reasonably been able to count on IA4
positions opening up for them.
"They were not strung along all
this time," he said. "They were aware
of the desire to reorganize.They knew
that we had pulled these positions.
They chose to continue to work with
Manpower, to work with us and to
continue to have an income."
Faulkner said that introducing
four IA2 positions, rather than two
IA4 positions, would be more bene
ficial for both the workers and the
hotel.
He also attributed the lower salary
of the IA2 positions to the fact that
the requirements and responsibilities
of those jobs would be diminished in
his proposed reorganization plan.
"The reorganization shows that
some of the significant responsibilities
on the front desk team are lessened
now," said Benaderet, who now works
as a regional supervisor for Student
I lousing. "It really frees up that front
desk team to provide excellent cus
tomer service to every guest at that
hotel."
Faulkner and VanFossen de
scribed the workers' accusations as
fraught with "misstatements," and
both suggested that the reorganiza
tion was designed to make the Guest
1 louse more efficient in its service to
its patrons as well as its reliance on
permanent University employees.

TEMPORARY WORKERS
Central to this conflict between
some of the Guest I louse workers and
management is the status of tempo
rary workers on campus and the dif
ference in benefits offered to tempo
rary laborers versus permanent Uni
versity employees.
Of the 20 employees at the Guest
I louse in late January, Faulkner esti
mated that six or seven were tempo
rary workers and that the number was
subject to increase if hotel occupancy
demanded it. Faulkner and Student
Housing administrators conceded
that the Guest I louse relied more on
temporary workers than they would
have liked over the last year and at
tributed this to the frequent changes
in management.
The temporary workers and Feld
man, however, suggested that the
Guest I louse sought to maintain its
reliance on temporary workers in
order to avoid providing its workers
with health benefits and to minimize
their pay.
Feldman said that the reliance on
temporary workers was particularly
obvious in the housekeeping staff.
"The housekeepers enjoy a differ
ent benefit because of the union (Ser
vice Employees International Union,
Local 715]," Feldman said. "Because
of the union, if there's a temporary
worker that works longer than six
months, then the union contract says
that's a job. You have to hire that per
son or let him go. And every six
months, the four or five temporary
people on the housekeeping staff are
cycled out and four or five new people
are brought in."
A member of the housekeeping
staff, who was granted anonymity be
cause he continues to work at the
Guest 1 louse, confirmed Feldman's
account in an interview with The
Daily.
"They're letting them go," he said.
"And then they're bringing in new
ones because we need them."
Faulkner, however, dismissed the
claim that temporary workers were
hired every six months, and said the
reorganization plan he had imple
mented was designed to reduce the re
liance on temporary workers. While
Faulkner and VanFossen expressed
satisfaction with the performance of
the temporary workers at the hotel,
they said that the new positions re
ceived the support of the local union
and would provide benefits to more
individuals at the hotel.
They also cited the continual sup

port they have received from Man
power. the company that directly em
ploys the temporary workers at the
Guest House.
The director of human resources
for Manpower's Silicon Valley and
Central California Coast operations
told The Daily that complaints from
workers employed at the University
were rare.
"Manpower has had a long rela
tionship with Stanford University, and
in that period, we have found them to
he very forthright and fair," said
Donna Long.
CURRENT EXPERIENCES
Faced with the loss of a quarter of
his staff in late January, Faulkner re
placed the departing temporary work
ers with new temporary workers from
Manpower.
A front desk employee, who
wished to remain anonymous for fear
of losing her job, described the effects
of the sudden change in staff.
"The gift shop hasn't been counted
in nine days," she said, "and nine days
of reconciliation haven't been com
pleted."
The employee also described the
lack of training for the current tempo
rary workers.
"To my understanding, none of
them were interviewed." she said.
"One person who came on for a day
did not even know how to copy and
paste. One of them who came on for
three days had no customer service
skills. She barely knew how to use a
computer."
TTie housekeeping staff member
interviewed by The Daily described
similar problems. He said that 15
rooms were not assigned to be
cleaned one day and that some
guests were accidentally taken to
dirty rooms before the mistake was
corrected.
While Faulkner conceded that
some mistakes have been made over
the last few weeks, he suggested that
mistakes were "natural" in the hotel
business and that the Guest I louse's
customer service ratings continue to
be extremely high.
Faulkner provided The Daily with
the average customer ratings for the
Guest House, as he had tabulated
them, over the last five weeks. The 17
customer service quality cards he col
lected after the recent departure of
the five disgruntled employees had an
average quality rating of 4.8 out of 5
— a mark consistent with ratings from
the month before.

"Ihe quality at the hotel continues
to he exceptionally high." Faulkner
said. "I've worked my butt oil the last
week, and we are pulling it together
for our customers."

Five of the Stanford Guest
House's 20 workers expressed dis
satisfaction with their jobs in a pow
erful way late last month — using
their feet.
Four temporary workers — em
ployed by Manpower as front desk
staff at the hotel — asked for reas
signment after one University em
ployee. the front desk supervisor,
abruptly resigned.
Citing fundamental concerns
with ongoing staff reorganization
and the treatment of temporary
workers at the hotel, these workers
hoped to send the message to their
employer that what they deemed to
be marginalization would no longer
be tolerated. Guest I louse manage
ment and Student Housing admin
istrators expressed surprise with
the workers' unhappiness and said
they were shocked to find their staff
considerably depleted at the end of
January.
I lli: ROOTS OF DISCONTENT
On Sept. 11. 2006, Jonathan
Faulkner, formerly general manager
of the UCLA Guest House, began
his new job as general manger of the
Stanford Guest I louse, the fourth
general manager in the last two years
at the hotel, which had previously
been associated with the Stanford
I inear Accelerator Center.
Iliree workers who left the Guest
House in January and two workers
who are still employed at the hotel
told The Daily that from day one of
Faulkner's term, it had become ap
parent their work environment had
taken a turn for the worse.
"[Faulkner] didn't bother to learn
our names or to even look at us." said
Kerry Stroud, a temporary worker
assigned the night shift at the front
desk for several months.
Hie University vehemently dis
putes this claim and other concerns
raised by the workers since the walk
out.
Zeb Feldman, the front desk su
pervisor and the only full-time I )ni
versity employee to resign from the
Guest I louse, shared Stroud's senti

ments.
"When he would go to his office,
he would just make a beeline." Feld
man said. "He wouldn't make eye
contact, and he wouldn't say 'hello'
to whoever was working at the front
desk."
Yet, the workers said they tolerat
ed Faulkner's attitude because they
hoped to apply for the two 1 A4-clas
sified positions that the previous
Guest House general manager, Re
becca Benaderet, reportedly said
would be posted in the fall.
The IA4 pay-structure classifica
tion used by Stanford Human Re
sources signaled that the position
would offer a starting salary of
$40,320 and up — far greater than
the approximately $28,000 annual
salary the temporary workers were
making at the time.
()n Jan. 17.2(X)7, Faulkner did not
post two IA4 salaries. Ile instead in
troduced four IA2 positions — jobs
that would offer starting salaries of
$30,880 and up.
Feeling overworked and under
valued. several temporary workers
said it was at this point that they
began to strongly consider asking for
reassignment from Manpower, ef
fectively terminating their employ
ment at the Guest I louse.
Feldman described a difference
in the way he and Faulkner expected
workers to be treated and said this
difference led him to resign in the
last week of January, a decision that
motivated the four temporary work
ers to leave their jobs over the next
two days.
By the end of January, five work
ers — 25 percent of the Guest 1 louse
staff —had either asked for reas
signment or quit.
FEELINGS OF SHOCK
While the workers expressed dis
satisfaction during Faulkner's tenure
at the Guest House. Student Hous
ing administrators and Faulkner
himself described the changes at the
hotel as positive and said they were
surprised that the workers decided
to leave.
"I am shocked," said Mike Van-
Fossen, University manager of Stu
dent Housing. "Some of these tem
porary employees we were definitely
thinking about when creating these
positions. We were absolutely dumb
founded that some of these employ
ees would ask for reassignment back
at Manpower to remain being tempo
rary employees."
Faulkner said it was "regrettable"
and "unfortunate" that some of the
workers found his attitude unfriendly,
and he said he tried to ensure that
none of the workers were negatively
affected by the Guest 1 louse reorgan
ization he had planned. VanFossen
emphasized that none of the workers
were fired and, in fact, more positions
were introduced.
"Through this reorganization, we
have more full-time employees up
there," he said. "We are providing
more people the opportunity to get
excellent jobs. We made sure that we
took care of all the employees — both
full-time and temporary. None of
them were negatively affected in this.
None of them lost a job. None of them
lost a salary in this."
VanFossen also disagreed with the
workers' claim that they should have
reasonably been able to count on IA4
positions opening up for them.
"They were not strung along all
this time," he said. "They were aware
of the desire to reorganize.They knew
that we had pulled these positions.
They chose to continue to work with
Manpower, to work with us and to
continue to have an income."
Faulkner said that introducing
four IA2 positions, rather than two
IA4 positions, would be more bene
ficial for both the workers and the
hotel.
He also attributed the lower salary
of the IA2 positions to the fact that
the requirements and responsibilities
of those jobs would be diminished in
his proposed reorganization plan.
"The reorganization shows that
some of the significant responsibilities
on the front desk team are lessened
now," said Benaderet, who now works
as a regional supervisor for Student
I lousing. "It really frees up that front
desk team to provide excellent cus
tomer service to every guest at that
hotel."
Faulkner and VanFossen de
scribed the workers' accusations as
fraught with "misstatements," and
both suggested that the reorganiza
tion was designed to make the Guest
1 louse more efficient in its service to
its patrons as well as its reliance on
permanent University employees.

TEMPORARY WORKERS
Central to this conflict between
some of the Guest I louse workers and
management is the status of tempo
rary workers on campus and the dif
ference in benefits offered to tempo
rary laborers versus permanent Uni
versity employees.
Of the 20 employees at the Guest
I louse in late January, Faulkner esti
mated that six or seven were tempo
rary workers and that the number was
subject to increase if hotel occupancy
demanded it. Faulkner and Student
Housing administrators conceded
that the Guest I louse relied more on
temporary workers than they would
have liked over the last year and at
tributed this to the frequent changes
in management.
The temporary workers and Feld
man, however, suggested that the
Guest I louse sought to maintain its
reliance on temporary workers in
order to avoid providing its workers
with health benefits and to minimize
their pay.
Feldman said that the reliance on
temporary workers was particularly
obvious in the housekeeping staff.
"The housekeepers enjoy a differ
ent benefit because of the union (Ser
vice Employees International Union,
Local 715]," Feldman said. "Because
of the union, if there's a temporary
worker that works longer than six
months, then the union contract says
that's a job. You have to hire that per
son or let him go. And every six
months, the four or five temporary
people on the housekeeping staff are
cycled out and four or five new people
are brought in."
A member of the housekeeping
staff, who was granted anonymity be
cause he continues to work at the
Guest 1 louse, confirmed Feldman's
account in an interview with The
Daily.
"They're letting them go," he said.
"And then they're bringing in new
ones because we need them."
Faulkner, however, dismissed the
claim that temporary workers were
hired every six months, and said the
reorganization plan he had imple
mented was designed to reduce the re
liance on temporary workers. While
Faulkner and VanFossen expressed
satisfaction with the performance of
the temporary workers at the hotel,
they said that the new positions re
ceived the support of the local union
and would provide benefits to more
individuals at the hotel.
They also cited the continual sup

port they have received from Man
power. the company that directly em
ploys the temporary workers at the
Guest House.
The director of human resources
for Manpower's Silicon Valley and
Central California Coast operations
told The Daily that complaints from
workers employed at the University
were rare.
"Manpower has had a long rela
tionship with Stanford University, and
in that period, we have found them to
he very forthright and fair," said
Donna Long.
CURRENT EXPERIENCES
Faced with the loss of a quarter of
his staff in late January, Faulkner re
placed the departing temporary work
ers with new temporary workers from
Manpower.
A front desk employee, who
wished to remain anonymous for fear
of losing her job, described the effects
of the sudden change in staff.
"The gift shop hasn't been counted
in nine days," she said, "and nine days
of reconciliation haven't been com
pleted."
The employee also described the
lack of training for the current tempo
rary workers.
"To my understanding, none of
them were interviewed." she said.
"One person who came on for a day
did not even know how to copy and
paste. One of them who came on for
three days had no customer service
skills. She barely knew how to use a
computer."
TTie housekeeping staff member
interviewed by The Daily described
similar problems. He said that 15
rooms were not assigned to be
cleaned one day and that some
guests were accidentally taken to
dirty rooms before the mistake was
corrected.
While Faulkner conceded that
some mistakes have been made over
the last few weeks, he suggested that
mistakes were "natural" in the hotel
business and that the Guest I louse's
customer service ratings continue to
be extremely high.
Faulkner provided The Daily with
the average customer ratings for the
Guest House, as he had tabulated
them, over the last five weeks. The 17
customer service quality cards he col
lected after the recent departure of
the five disgruntled employees had an
average quality rating of 4.8 out of 5

TTie housekeeping staff member
interviewed by The Daily described
similar problems. He said that 15
rooms were not assigned to be
cleaned one day and that some
guests were accidentally taken to
dirty rooms before the mistake was
corrected.
While Faulkner conceded that
some mistakes have been made over
the last few weeks, he suggested that
mistakes were "natural" in the hotel
business and that the Guest I louse's
customer service ratings continue to
be extremely high.
Faulkner provided The Daily with
the average customer ratings for the
Guest House, as he had tabulated
them, over the last five weeks. The 17
customer service quality cards he col
lected after the recent departure of
the five disgruntled employees had an
average quality rating of 4.8 out of 5
— a mark consistent with ratings from
the month before.

"Ihe quality at the hotel continues
to he exceptionally high." Faulkner
said. "I've worked my butt oil the last
week, and we are pulling it together
for our customers."
