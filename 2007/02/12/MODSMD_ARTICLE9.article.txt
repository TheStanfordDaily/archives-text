# On being ill
## When all you have left is Late Nite 
### EMILY FINLEY INTERMISSION SPLEEN TARANTULA 
Everyone seems to be dying this quarter. "I'm
so sick." you hear someone complain to a friend.
"Something's going around right now ..."
I know better. I've been sick since the moment
that I walked onto this campus for the first time,
hut my immune system likes to be tricky. It lived
a pretty boring existence before college — no
excessive food sharing, no unwashed shot glass
es, no Full Moon on the Quad.
Now that I'm here, it must take some kind of
perverse pleasure in the fact that I am never fully
healthy. My roommate and I know that two
weeks have passed when we run out of Kleenex.
But this weekend was especially horrible. My
sickness stopped being dormant and decided to
take control.
Bv the time that Thursday night rolled
around. 1 had a visiting friend (sleeping on the
miniature tloor of my very miniature double,
spending the majority of her time getting in my
way and straightening her hair), a massive head
cold, an impending midterm and a huge guilt
complex.
What was I supposed to do with her while I
played around with matrices and hiked around in
the cold, extending the life of my sore throat by
another few days? I felt so guilty after my
midterm that I had one of my more brilliant
ideas, called "Going to a I rat Filled with Fresh
men on a rhursday Night When the Temperature
Parallels Antarctic Lows."
I woke up on Friday feeling like someone had
turned my head inside out and pulled it down
around my knees. And I lay there in pain for two
hours before I realized that yes, over-the-counter
drugs are made for this purpose.Then I took two
Advil and felt better.
I slept through most of Friday, keeping the
room in perpetual darkness and occasionally

venturing out into the hallway to ask for drugs.
What do you do when you're sick? There's not re
ally much that you can do. and somehow every
thing is only amusing in retrospect.
I managed to get out of bed for the first time
around seven in the evening,decided that getting
dressed was too much of an effort, and wandered
to some lounge in some remote location on West
Campus. (Nobody cares exactly where. It's West
Campus.)
I spent some enjoyable hours watching "The

()ffice," which is a great show to watch when
you're sick. (You can miss as many scenes of
the episodes as you want or skip around be
tween them — because, hey. the tension be
tween Jim and Pam is exactly the same w hen
you wake up).

I managed to stand up for an
entire game of Beirut, which
showed off how sick my hand
eye coordination was (ahaha).
and then I even managed to wan
der across campus to Stern's
Cyber Cafe. After being awake
lor a total of about five hours. 1

took Sudafed until I felt better and lit
erally passed out in bed.

Hiis cycle repeated itself on Saturday, though
I managed to convince myself that I was working
on my seminal paper by holding one of the as-

signed hooks when I fell asleep. I didn't think
much about sleeping 16 hours a day. until some
one pointed out that mono was a likely culprit
especially since this had been going on for four
days.
A quick Wikipedia search revealed that I had
every single symptom of mono, including a se
vere pain in the region of my spleen. Never mind
that 1 have no idea where my spleen is: if you have
mono, your spleen can rupture and it can be po
tentially fatal. Dying was just what I needed to
get out of writing my paper, so 1 extrapolated on

this concept for awhile to several of my friends,
who all left me to go do better things than hand
me Kleenex every five minutes.
The only option left to me was Stern's Cyber
Cafe. I have to point out that Lagunita's Late
Nile is far superior, but when there is nothing else
to do. Stern's attempt suffices. In fact, going to
Late Nite (twice) was the highlight of my sick
weekend. It required the maximum amount of ef
fort that 1 could physically put forth, the appro
priate reward at the end and a strong incentive

to get back in bed and rest when I got back to
my room.

Being sick is a time-consuming
activity — the only things that you
can really do are sleep, watch TV and
laugh at your dormmates when they

stumble back from a party at

three in the morning.

Oh. and perhaps
take a trip over to
Late Nite. But when
walking to the
PHE 's room to get
free medicine

(again) taxes your
strength, perhaps

this is not the best idea

r The support of your
friends is. of course, vital. But

there's always that one kid who has to make it
worse. When I started asking if my spleen was
likely to rupture. I got this response:
"Well.you do know that mono is just the result
of a large spleen tarantula crawling around in
your spleen, trying to get out into your blood
stream. right?"
I thought this was the most asinine thing that I
had ever heard, but if you Google "spleen taran
tula," you get an image result. Disturbing? Yes.
Activity for a sick person? Yes. Fortunately, the
result of my mono test: Negative.
