# Domination, fish-style
## Stanford prof and students research whether fish use logical reasoning in establishing hierarchy 
### RACHEL WHELAN 
Three researchers at Stanford have observed
signs of intelligence in fish by giving them a test
usually administered to 4- or 5- year olds.
At Lake Tanganyika, in Eastern Africa, the aggres
sive males of a tish species known as Astatotilapia bur
toni constantly try to improve their social status by
winning fights over territory and resources. A male
must win or risk becoming reproductively dormant
and stigmatized by a temporary loss of the imposing
black eyebar striping his face.
In the laboratory of Biology Prof. Russell Fernald,
graduate student in statistics Logan Grosenick. and
former psychology postdoctoral fellow Tricia S.
Clement, A burtoni males are taking a test originally
designed for 4- to 5-year-old children. This test assess
es the ability to make transitive inferences — deduc
ing. for example, that if A is dominant over Band B
over C. then A is dominant over C'. Grosenick and his
partners have found the first direct evidence that fish
use this basis ot logical reasoning to derive a domi
nance hierarchy merely from observing a series of
fights between rival males.
Why do fish have the capacity for transitive infer
ence? For the A. burtoni. who engage in many aggres
sive battles over territory and resources, it is evolu
tionary adaptive to be able to size up the competition
and determine the local dominance hierarchy.This en
ables A. burtoni to save energy and avoid dangerous,
unnecessary battles that they are certain to lose.
In a special square tank designed by Grosenick and
Fernald. a "bystander" tish is enclosed in an opaque
central "observer deck.' around which five size
matched rival males swim in their own individual
compartments. Through imposing disadvantages on
certain fish, the experimenters rig the matches so that
tish "A" will beat fish "B." fish "B" will beat fish "C,"
and so on tocreate the hierarchy A>B>C>D>E. After
the rival lish find each other in the same compart
ment,an opaque barrier in the central compartment is
lifted, enabling the bystander to watch the two fish
light. Chasing, biting and threatening behaviour indi
cate victory, whereas fleeing indicates defeat.
After watching two lights a day for eleven days,
and waiting for the losing fishes' black eyebars to re
turn, the bystander must choose which rival he prefers
between the most-dominant and least-dominant fish
(A and E), and the second-most-dominant and sec
ond-lcast-dominant fish (Band I)), to see if he can

infer a hierarchy based on the
fights he has witnessed. Previ
ous experiments have established

that A. burtoni and other fish prefer
to be with a lower-ranked, less threat
ening male and indicate this preference
by spending more time in that fish's vicini
ty. Since neither A and E. nor Band D,
had ever directly fought one anoth
er. this task determines whether

the bystander can make deci
sions based on logical inference
rather than mere observation.
The choice between A. who always won.
and F. who always lost, provided more of a general
evaluation of the bystander?s preference, since choic
es between the two extremes usually yield conclusive
results. The real test was the choice between the more
closely ranked 13 and D. Since both Band D had won
and lost fights, the only difference between them was
their hierarchical rank.
The researchers measured the bystander lish's rea
soning capacity by lifting an opaque barrier separat
ing him from the two rival fish and allowing the by
stander to swim towards the fish it preferred. The re
searchers observed which fish the bystander chose to
swim to first, but the more important indicator of pref
erence was which fish the bystander spent more time
with. The bystanders virtually always chose to spend
more time with E than A, and with D than B.
They tested how the bystander's ability to infer a
hierarchy from observation would be affected by con
ducting the same preference test in a new tank. Al
though the bystander still chose E over A. and D over
B. a new factor emerged in the his ability to infer a hi
erarchy: C"s behavior during the rigged matches. If C
exhibited ambiguous dominant behavior, for exam
ple. quickly submitting to B but easily dominating 1).
then the relationship between Band D would become
more difficult to infer — but C 's behavior only played
a role in the novel setting. In the original tank, whether
C had expressed uniform or ambiguous behavior did
not significantly affect which rival fish the bystander
preferred. In the new tank, however, if C's rivalry be
havior had been ambiguous, the bystander was less
likely to correctly discriminate between rivals.
Previous experiments indicate that fish redun
dantly code both spatial and featural aspects of their
environment — that is. they store both characteris
tics in their memory when only one should be neces

sary for recognition. When in a familiar environ
ment, the bystander can use both aspects of informa
tion regarding fish A and E.or Band D. But when in
a new setting, the bystander can use only featural
cues to discriminate between the two paired rivals —
and is thus less accurate when choosing between
them.
Although the capacity for transitive inference has
also been found in nonhuman primates,rats,and birds,
Fernald and his colleagues concluded that A. burtoni's
use of both spatial and featural representations is evi
dence that no universal neuronal circuitry for transi
tive inference exists. Instead, any species that evolves
in a social system characterized by male competition
for mates and resources will independently acquire
the capacity to understand and exploit its hierarchy,
simply because the ability to do so is evolutionarily
adaptive.
