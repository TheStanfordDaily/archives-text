## Editorial Board A 						call to action in 2008 
### 
The 2008 race for the White House is
off to an astonishingly fast start. For
the first time in SO years, no incum
bent president or vice president is aiming
for the Oval Office, and a star-studded field
of promising candidates has rushed to fill
the vacuum. Much attention has focused on
Hillary Clinton's quest to become the first
woman to hold the nation's highest office,
and Barack Obama announced on Saturday
that he will seek to become the first African-
American president. Americans can expect
a roller coaster of a campaign.
Nor will this glitzy election lack sub
stance. Media pundits delight in haphaz
ardly labeling every presidential election
"the most important ever." yet this distinc
tion rings true for 2008. The next presi
dent's policies will have little margin for
error. And because the future occupant of
the White House must address imminent
problems with potentially astounding
long-term consequences, his or her priori
ties stand to acutely impact our generation
in particular.The consequences of the next
president's policies on energy, climate
change, the Middle East and the fiscal sus
tainability of entitlements like Medicare
and Social Security will be borne by the
young adults of today.
Along with the palpable excitement sur
rounding the election comes unmatched op
portunity for Stanford students to get in
volved. Students at the University have a
history of volunteering for political cam
paigns at all levels of government. Many re
cent graduates seek employment with polit
ical operations after graduating: some even
pursue careers as political consultants. We
applaud these paragons of dedication to the
democratic process, and implore current
students to pursue similar endeavors during
the 2008 campaign.
Options for students to become involved
with the 2008 election are as remarkable as
they are diverse. Although the Stanford De
mocrats have traditionally been more active
than their Republican counterparts, it
would be a mistake to discount the influ
ence of those on campus with conservative
leanings — particularly if offered a socially
moderate Republican candidate like John

McCain or Rudy Giuliani.
Students seeking to make an impact at a
broader level should not hesitate to con
tact state or national campaign offices di
rectly. For those not outwardly motivated
by the politics of personality, ample oppor
tunities exist both on- and off-campus to
play a less partisan role. Issue-oriented stu
dent groups mobilize to support candi
dates who they feel will best support their
causes.
As the primaries approach, we can also
expect a flurry of campaign-related
speeches and events on campus. Stanford
in Government has traditionally organized
a smorgasbord of non-partisan panels and
information sessions during the campaign
season. Further, the University has a histo
ry of attracting both active and former
presidential candidates. John Kerry ap
peared in 2003 at a Stanford Democrats
sponsored event on technology policy
prior to winning the lowa caucuses. Former
Democratic candidates John Edwards. Ai
Gore and I loward Dean have spoken on
campus in recent years,and President Bush
met with Hoover Institution leaders in
April 2006.
California is poised to play a critical role
in the 2008 election, as candidates expect to
raise $100 million by the end of 2007 seek to
tap the state's vast fundraising resources.
An even greater consideration hinges on
California's decision on whether to move its
primary from June to February, as has been
rumored.The shift to the earlier date would
give the nation's largest state a bona fide say
in choosing each party's nominee. More
over, the increased attention focused on the
Golden State due to an early primary would
allow Stanford students volunteering for
campaigns to amplify their collective im
pact.
In less than one month of existence, the
global Facebook group "One Million
Strong for Barack [Obama|" has swelled to
over 250.000 members. This display of sup
port characterizes the energy and devotion
to the political process that college students
are poised to harness. For the 2008 cam
paign. let us aspire to translate this raw pas
sion into action.
