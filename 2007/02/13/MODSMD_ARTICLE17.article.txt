# And one fine morning
## 
### 
The hors d'oeuvres were delectable,
the drinks overpriced. The ladies
pecked at the cheese tray; the gen
tlemen demanded more gin, less tonic.The
DJ played old favorites, while the dance
floor waxed and waned with future cap
tains of industry, commandants of science,
emperors of banking, ensigns of art.
Names and faces from IHUM sections
and freshman dorms appeared out of the
ether. The boys wore ties, the girls classical
ly demure dresses (except for the car model,
who glued herself into trim slits of reflective
blue fabric, dressing for Oscar at the Peo
ple's Choice Awards).
Amidst the general din of Senior Semi-
Formal, you could hear the same question
over and over, the opening lines of the hack
neyed chorus we all have to sing eventually:
"How'd we get so damn old?"
In college, you grow up accidentally,
when you're not looking. The quarter sys
tem isn 't made for wimps or whimsy, no time
for smelling the flowers. It's a hard-driving
lifestyle, addiction-building, more coffee on
Tuesday, more weed on Saturday. I low long
can ( ampus Drive protect your metabo
lism? 1 ime barely ever passes: construction
projects snail along, vague winters blow in,
your friends fall in and out of love and beds.
Everyone I know who studied abroad wor
ried about all the stuff they'd miss while
they were gone. Everyone remarked, upon
return, how little things change, here in the
Fun house.
But all good things come to a slow and
painful finish, and Stanford is no different.
Semi-formal, the prequel to the beginning
of the end. was a pleasant affair. Stanford
kids need more excuses to dress up, because
everyone looks so much better when they
have to put in the bare minimum of effort.
All the guys look equally handsome; all the
girls look uniquely beautiful.
It's a nice break from the scuzzball roll
out-of-bed fashion sense this school en
courages. I start every quarter wearing
collared shirts and jeans; I end every quarter
wearing sweatpants, flip-flops, and t-shirts
that pass the smell test. Hv comparison, at
Semi-formal.rocking a lilac long-sleeve and
a blue tie so tacky it could only have come
from Istanbul. I was god damn CIO (except
for my haircut, which makes me look 12 in
stead of my usual 16). 1 would have worn a
blazer, but once you've got lilac and deep
blue, anything else ignites a rift in space
time.
TTie whole event was a regular James
Joyce soiree, the space between words filled
with unspoken melancholy. It's not the
"old" thing that gets you down, because I
don't think that anyone in the class of'o7 ac
tually feels very old. If anything, we're a bit
embarrassed at how young we still feel —

weren't we supposed to have discovered
ourselves by now? That's the great hippie lie
of college, the notion that there's some se
cret person hiding in the back of your high
school subconsciousness, and all it takes is
the right combination of high acadcmia and
casual dormcest to find them.
It anything, college is about realizing
that no one ever really finds themselves.
Even Ciod just makes it up as he goes
along. Don't you ever wish a great Wagner
ian rain would flood out your world, take
you back to the beginning.give you a second
chance? There are so many other things you
want to do. There are so many more people
you need to meet.
That was the second question on every
one's lips, a joke without a punchline: "Who
are all these people?" Maybe it's because
our school is so small, so remote from the
rest of the world, that it feels like we should
know everybody in the colony. Maybe it's
because Facebook reminds us we have so
many hundreds of friends. ()r maybe it's be
cause we have just the right blend of type-A
work ethic and emotional neediness that we
have to know, and be loved, by everyone.
For whatever reason.everyone I talked to at
Semi-Formal couldn't believe how many
people they didn't know. That might be be
cause a lot of people weren't there,.or be
cause Semi-Formal attracts a certain kind of
crowd (of all the fraternities, only Kappa
Sigma made a decent showing — we heard
there was shrimp cocktail), but I've been
hearing the same thing all year. You're sur
prised you don't know everyone, disap
pointed that you never will.
When something comes to an end,
there's always the strong feeling of missed
chances, especially at Stanford. I know peo
ple who spent their whole lives yearning,
waiting, working to come here. In some
weird way. I think that NSO might be the ab
solute pinnacle of the Stanford experience,
rhe dorm cheers, the icebreakers, the new
roommates, baby's first shot of Bacardi,
baby's first college textbook — that sense
of eternal possibility, stretching before you.
An Undiscovered Country, just waiting for
you to lay some Manifest Destiny all across
its immortal terrain. The Grecian Urn mo
ment.
