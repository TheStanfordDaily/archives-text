# A 						push for tush
## 
### 
On my daily bicycular jaunt down Santa
Teresa Street, I'm constantly distracted
by the cute little Toyota Prii (my room
mate's plural for Prius) that line the road.
Snugged into their white-lined spaces, they
look like the lovely, non-threatening low-emis
sions vehicles they are. And what's more, they
have cute butts. Some people call them ugly,
but that's to be expected, i think, in a world
that so recently embraced the tiny posteriors
of Kate Moss and her heroin-chic comrades.
But 1 suppose my taste in buttocks is simply
old-fashioned. While I fail to be charmed by
the waspish figure of a Jaguar or the finely-ta
pered ass of a Mercedes. I 'm a pushover for the
more capacious rear end of a Pri us. I suppose
you could say that I like my Prii like Rubens
liked his women — amply buttocked.
Hut the Prius's value cannot derive solely
from its charming derriere. As one must ask
of a significant other, one must ask of the
Pi ius."Am I interested in you as a functional
whole, or do I simply admire your cute little
tush?" While there are clear benefits of hy
brid ownership (lower emissions, reduced
gas consumption, use of thecarpool lane, free
parking in Santa Monica for 2 hours, clear
moral conscience, etc.), there are also tough
questions that must be asked, the most press
ing being, "Will I be crushed to death in this
tiny tin can of a contraption? And if so. do the
advantages of my moral righteousness as a
low-carbon-emitter outweigh the disadvan
tages of being dead?"
A worthy question. And one that was
brought up by my parents when they first
considered purchasing a hybrid vehicle. Ini
tially. my mother and father spurned the hy
brid on the grounds that it might be. as they
said, "dangerous." Of course, this is the same
mother who claimed that nail polish is per
ilous because it "stops your nails from
breathing." and this is the same father who
cajoled me into wearing a cowbell around my
neck while I skied, so as to warn others of my

approach. But did my parents, paranoid as
they were, have a point?

In search of information about hybrid
safety, I plunged into the messy frontier of
the Internet. The ever-optimistic
hybridcars.com claimed that hybrids do well
in crash situations because they are "small,
quick and nimble (good at avoiding acci
dents)." 1 appreciate the optimism, but I
doubt that many accidents are the result of
our not driving fast enough. So I looked for
harder evidence and found this: hybrids gen
erally do well in crash tests; cars such as the
Honda Accord Hybrid and the Toyota Prius
have rated five stars for frontal and rear col
lision safety, and five stars for rollover safety.
However, the weak point of the hybrids is
their side-impact crash ratings, which fall to
four stars (not the absolute best, but not
shabby) for the aforementioned cars. In the
grand scope of midsize and compact cars, it
seems that the hybrids lie somewhere in the
middle. While a hybrid can't beat the three
ton hunk of metal that is a midsize Mercedes,
hybrids test much better than, say, the Nissan
Sentra, whose front-impact crash ratings are
only slightly better than those of an alu
minum foil pie tin.

Okay, so hybrids are decently safe with re
spect to other compact and midsize cars. But
you could still pick something safer. You could,
if you have the means, pick the Mercedes. And
that extra ton of steel would give you better
protection against the dangers of the modern
road: the pickup trucks, the SUVs,the moving

vans, and the unspeakably immoral I lummers.
But is it worth it to be a bigger polluter, if it
means you'll be a little bit safer?
My answer is no. It sounds heartless and
even irresponsible, especially when you con
sider that moms are putting their kids and
dogs ;ind mothers-in-law into their Pi ii, when
they'd be safer in a Benz. Here's my rebuttal:
with car choice, as with all things, there is a
level of acceptable risk. We take acceptable
risks all the time: flying in planes, eating sushi,
playing with strange dogs — all of those are
acceptable risks. And maybe you'll crash,
maybe you'll get food poisoning,maybe you'll
get rabies, but what kind of quality would your
life have if you didn't take those risks?
And hybrids aren't vastly w/safe. lhey are
reasonably safe. So driving a hybrid isn't an
unconscionable risk: it's a sensible one. And
it's a risk that brings with it no small amount
of moral rectitude. When given the choice be
tween a car that's reasonably safe and low
emitting and a car that's marginally safer and
high-emitting, my vote falls with the reason
ably safe car. If I do have kids (unlikely), I'd
like to tell them, "Yes, I let you swim even
though you could drown, and yes I let you eat
cookie dough even though you could get sal
monella, and yes. I was driving you to school
in a conscience-friendly vehicle while our
global climate went down the toilet."
ITie choice of a hybrid is. for me, largely a
matter of principle, but also an attempt to
push for a greater hybrid trend.The more hy
brid vehicles on the road, the fewer SUVs
and steel-heavy midsize cars there will be.
and (hopefully) we'll get to a point where
most of the cars on the road are of compara
ble weights, and we won't have to worry
about a whopping 5 tons of Hummer bearing
down on a compact car.
It's a sharp slap in the face to my Catholic
school education that I can't bring myself to


McCann
levy absolute moral judgments. But
it's true — I can't claim that my
morality on this issue is entirely satis
factory. But it's the best I've got. Mor
bid and cruel as it sounds, I have to
say, yes, it is right to give your child

less protection in order to contribute
to a national reduction of emissions.
Yes.it is right to make sacrifices in the
face of a larger, global problem. No.it
is not right to take absurd risks, but
driving a hybrid is not an absurd risk;
it is a calculated one.
But if my moral stance doesn't
sway you. perhaps the cuteness of
the Prii will, l ined upon Santa Tere
sa Street like little J-Lo's in a row.
they're simply irresistible.

vans, and the unspeakably immoral I lummers.
But is it worth it to be a bigger polluter, if it
means you'll be a little bit safer?
My answer is no. It sounds heartless and
even irresponsible, especially when you con
sider that moms are putting their kids and
dogs ;ind mothers-in-law into their Pi ii, when
they'd be safer in a Benz. Here's my rebuttal:
with car choice, as with all things, there is a
level of acceptable risk. We take acceptable
risks all the time: flying in planes, eating sushi,
playing with strange dogs — all of those are
acceptable risks. And maybe you'll crash,
maybe you'll get food poisoning,maybe you'll
get rabies, but what kind of quality would your
life have if you didn't take those risks?
And hybrids aren't vastly w/safe. lhey are
reasonably safe. So driving a hybrid isn't an
unconscionable risk: it's a sensible one. And
it's a risk that brings with it no small amount
of moral rectitude. When given the choice be
tween a car that's reasonably safe and low
emitting and a car that's marginally safer and
high-emitting, my vote falls with the reason
ably safe car. If I do have kids (unlikely), I'd
like to tell them, "Yes, I let you swim even
though you could drown, and yes I let you eat
cookie dough even though you could get sal
monella, and yes. I was driving you to school
in a conscience-friendly vehicle while our
global climate went down the toilet."
ITie choice of a hybrid is. for me, largely a
matter of principle, but also an attempt to
push for a greater hybrid trend.The more hy
brid vehicles on the road, the fewer SUVs
and steel-heavy midsize cars there will be.
and (hopefully) we'll get to a point where
most of the cars on the road are of compara
ble weights, and we won't have to worry
about a whopping 5 tons of Hummer bearing
down on a compact car.
It's a sharp slap in the face to my Catholic
school education that I can't bring myself to

it's true — I can't claim that my

Yes.it is right to make sacrifices in the

is not right to take absurd risks, but
driving a hybrid is not an absurd risk;
it is a calculated one.

On my daily bicycular jaunt down Santa
Teresa Street, I'm constantly distracted
by the cute little Toyota Prii (my room
mate's plural for Prius) that line the road.
Snugged into their white-lined spaces, they
look like the lovely, non-threatening low-emis
sions vehicles they are. And what's more, they
have cute butts. Some people call them ugly,
but that's to be expected, i think, in a world
that so recently embraced the tiny posteriors
of Kate Moss and her heroin-chic comrades.
But 1 suppose my taste in buttocks is simply
old-fashioned. While I fail to be charmed by
the waspish figure of a Jaguar or the finely-ta
pered ass of a Mercedes. I 'm a pushover for the
more capacious rear end of a Pri us. I suppose
you could say that I like my Prii like Rubens
liked his women — amply buttocked.
Hut the Prius's value cannot derive solely
from its charming derriere. As one must ask
of a significant other, one must ask of the
Pi ius."Am I interested in you as a functional
whole, or do I simply admire your cute little
tush?" While there are clear benefits of hy
brid ownership (lower emissions, reduced
gas consumption, use of thecarpool lane, free
parking in Santa Monica for 2 hours, clear
moral conscience, etc.), there are also tough
questions that must be asked, the most press
ing being, "Will I be crushed to death in this
tiny tin can of a contraption? And if so. do the
advantages of my moral righteousness as a
low-carbon-emitter outweigh the disadvan
tages of being dead?"
A worthy question. And one that was
brought up by my parents when they first
considered purchasing a hybrid vehicle. Ini
tially. my mother and father spurned the hy
brid on the grounds that it might be. as they
said, "dangerous." Of course, this is the same
mother who claimed that nail polish is per
ilous because it "stops your nails from
breathing." and this is the same father who
cajoled me into wearing a cowbell around my
neck while I skied, so as to warn others of my

approach. But did my parents, paranoid as
they were, have a point?

In search of information about hybrid
safety, I plunged into the messy frontier of
the Internet. The ever-optimistic
hybridcars.com claimed that hybrids do well
in crash situations because they are "small,
quick and nimble (good at avoiding acci
dents)." 1 appreciate the optimism, but I
doubt that many accidents are the result of
our not driving fast enough. So I looked for
harder evidence and found this: hybrids gen
erally do well in crash tests; cars such as the
Honda Accord Hybrid and the Toyota Prius
have rated five stars for frontal and rear col
lision safety, and five stars for rollover safety.
However, the weak point of the hybrids is
their side-impact crash ratings, which fall to
four stars (not the absolute best, but not
shabby) for the aforementioned cars. In the
grand scope of midsize and compact cars, it
seems that the hybrids lie somewhere in the
middle. While a hybrid can't beat the three
ton hunk of metal that is a midsize Mercedes,
hybrids test much better than, say, the Nissan
Sentra, whose front-impact crash ratings are
only slightly better than those of an alu
minum foil pie tin.

Okay, so hybrids are decently safe with re
spect to other compact and midsize cars. But
you could still pick something safer. You could,
if you have the means, pick the Mercedes. And
that extra ton of steel would give you better
protection against the dangers of the modern
road: the pickup trucks, the SUVs,the moving

vans, and the unspeakably immoral I lummers.
But is it worth it to be a bigger polluter, if it
means you'll be a little bit safer?
