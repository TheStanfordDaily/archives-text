# Froman hails free speech, gun rights
## Second female NRA president argues for the right to bear arms, citing personal experience

Twenty-six years ago, Sandra Froman
heard a strange sound coming from her
front door in the middle of the night. She
looked through the peephole to find a large
man attempting to break her lock and enter
her house. Petrified. Froman screamed to
make it clear that someone was home. But
her effort to scare the would-be intruder off
was to no avail.
"I was terrified he knew someone was
here," Froman '71. said last night during a
talk in kresge Auditorium sponsored by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau. "Why was he still
trying to get in?"
Froman called the police, who told her to
lock herself in an upstairs bedroom. Having
no lock on her bedroom door she panicked,
finding relief only when the police found the
would-be intruder gone when they arrived
minutes later.
"I realized 1 was out of options," she told
the crowd. "I decided then and there I was
never going to be that helpless again."
Froman. a self-described 5-foot-2 Jewish
woman, bought a gun the next day. She is

the organization's 136-year history.
On a night where news broke of a gun
man killing several people in a Utah shop

more on freedom of speech than on the na

political correctness and moral relativism,
which she argued eroded "the freedom to
think."
"Pretty soon there will be no differences
between right and wrong," she said, offering
a laundry list of famous personalities who
fell out of favor for what she portrayed as
slips of a tongue â€” ranging from actor Mel
Gibson to senators Trent Lott (R-MS), Joe
Biden (D-DE) and former senator George
Allen (R-VA).
"I'm not here to defend the freedom to
tell a racist joke," she said. "In an open mar
ketplace of ideas, you're always going to get
some crazy ideas."
That open marketplace of ideas was re
sponsible for such luminaries as Louis Pas
teur and Albert Einstein, whose break
throughs were not accepted by the scientific
establishment at the time, she said.
"By seeking to silence those it doesn't
want to hear, society is also silencing those
