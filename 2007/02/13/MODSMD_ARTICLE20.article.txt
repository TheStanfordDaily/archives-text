Protecting green space takes work
The Stanford community can he acutely
grateful for your excellent February 12 edito
rial. "Keep green space alive." It says better
than I've ever heard it said here,how integral
and necessary green space is to our universi
ty experience.
I would only reinforce the Editorial
Board's point by a reminder that keeping
green space at Stanford doesn't happen as a
matter of course. Whenever I look at the var
ied use and pleasure people get from the
Mayfield Playfield, 1 remember the two years
of dogged work it took, on the part of con
cerned residents and others, to preserve that
amenable place from development.
As for the Munger project, let us hope
that the green spaces and hardy trees that
have been lost along with Salvatierra Walk it
self will be replaced by an equivalently "lib
erating environment"!

SLAC article unfair
On behalf of the Stanford Guest House, I
am writing in response to the February 12,
2(X)7 article, "Guest House workers walk
out." The article, in its tone and narration,
misrepresents the situation and does not pro
vide a balanced perspective on events.
We appreciate that change is never easy
for some people, and we also understand that
reasonable people can hold varying views on
strategies to improve services and efficien
cies at the Guest House. That said we don't
want the personal opinions and mischarac
terizations of a few people to stand as the
record on this matter.
Much of the article is an unfair chastise
ment of Stanford for its treatment of tempo
rary workers. Yet the article does not explain
what the purpose of temporary workers is at
the Guest I louse.Temporary workers are not
used as trainees for permanent jobs or to sup
plant permanent jobs.'lhcy arc assigned tem
porarily to fill in during periods when jobs are
vacant, staff are sick or on vacation, or during

peak periods when additional staff are need
ed on a short-term or interim basis. This was
made very clear to the Manpower employees
which Manpower Director of Human Re
sources Donna Long confirmed in a written
statement given to reporter Christian Tom.
"... our employees are well informed that
their terms of employment with Stanford
University are temporary, and that Stanford
University is under no obligation to hire our
temporary employees into permanent posi
tions at the university." The Manpower em
ployees were paid good wages for their tem
porary work, and benefits are available to
them from Manpower, their employer.
The reporters summarize sources' com
ments that "the (iuest 1 louse sought to main
tain its reliance on temporary workers in
order to avoid providing its workers with
health benefits and to minimize their pay."
I his is absolutely talse and contradicts the
changes we are making. We are specifically
increasing the number of regular, ongoing
staff beyond previous levels in order
to reduce our reliance on temporary
workers. This is a central purpose of
the reorganization. We are not just fill
ing two previous, open positions; we
have created four,new, Stanford posi
tions with pay and benefits that are ex
ceptional in the hospitality industry.
The reporters also quote sources
who assert that we seek to rely on
temporary housekeeping staff.
Again, the reporters failed todisclose
that one of the new positions we have

created is an ongoing, bargaining
unit, housekeeping position, infor
mation that we provided to reporter
Tom.
Sources referenced in the article
also make a number of unwarranted,
unfair, and derogatory comments
about Jonathan Faulkner, general
manager of the Guest House. Mr.
Faulkner is a longtime, highly re
spected member of the hospitality
industry who ran two of the most
successful university guest houses in
the United States at UCLA. His
work at UCLA in start-up and man
agement of hotel operations is well
known. In the short time he has been
at Stanford, he has already infused
our guest house operations with new

ideas and changes that will take it to
a new. even higher level of service
and efficiency.
The Stanford Guest House pro
vides a convenient, on-campus hotel
for visitors to the Stanford campus.
We invite Stanford community
members to visit the Guest House
and experience first-hand our high
level of service and amenities. We re
main confident that the changes we
are making will benefit our staff and
our guests and are in the long-term
interest of the Guest House and the
Stanford community.
