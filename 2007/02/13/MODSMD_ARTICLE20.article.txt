Protecting green space takes work
The Stanford community can he acutely
grateful for your excellent February 12 edito
rial. "Keep green space alive." It says better
than I've ever heard it said here,how integral
and necessary green space is to our universi
ty experience.
I would only reinforce the Editorial
Board's point by a reminder that keeping
green space at Stanford doesn't happen as a
matter of course. Whenever I look at the var
ied use and pleasure people get from the
Mayfield Playfield, 1 remember the two years
of dogged work it took, on the part of con
cerned residents and others, to preserve that
amenable place from development.
As for the Munger project, let us hope
that the green spaces and hardy trees that
have been lost along with Salvatierra Walk it
self will be replaced by an equivalently "lib
erating environment"!

SLAC article unfair
On behalf of the Stanford Guest House, I
am writing in response to the February 12,
2(X)7 article, "Guest House workers walk
out." The article, in its tone and narration,
misrepresents the situation and does not pro
vide a balanced perspective on events.
We appreciate that change is never easy
for some people, and we also understand that
reasonable people can hold varying views on
strategies to improve services and efficien
cies at the Guest House. That said we don't
want the personal opinions and mischarac
terizations of a few people to stand as the
record on this matter.
Much of the article is an unfair chastise
ment of Stanford for its treatment of tempo
rary workers. Yet the article does not explain
what the purpose of temporary workers is at
the Guest I louse.Temporary workers are not
used as trainees for permanent jobs or to sup
plant permanent jobs.'lhcy arc assigned tem
porarily to fill in during periods when jobs are
vacant, staff are sick or on vacation, or during

peak periods when additional staff are need
ed on a short-term or interim basis. This was
made very clear to the Manpower employees
which Manpower Director of Human Re
sources Donna Long confirmed in a written
statement given to reporter Christian Tom.
"... our employees are well informed that
their terms of employment with Stanford
University are temporary, and that Stanford
University is under no obligation to hire our
temporary employees into permanent posi
tions at the university." The Manpower em
ployees were paid good wages for their tem
porary work, and benefits are available to
them from Manpower, their employer.
The reporters summarize sources' com
ments that "the (iuest 1 louse sought to main
tain its reliance on temporary workers in
order to avoid providing its workers with
health benefits and to minimize their pay."
I his is absolutely talse and contradicts the
changes we are making. We are specifically
increasing the number of regular, ongoing
