## More guns, more crime: Columbine revisited 
### NIKO THEO MILONOPOULOS 
In an essay released last year by investiga
tors ol the 1999 Columbine High School mas
sacre, 18-year-old gunman Eric Harris
mused. "Students can get weapons into
school too easily and they have [too] much
access to weapons outside of school."
Long before he took the lives of 12 of his
classmates, Harris recognized the societal
loophole that allowed him and 17-year-old
Dylan Klebold to commit one of the worst
American atrocities of the last century — the
result of a liberal gun culture that prizes
more highly a right to wield a rifle than a
right to live without the fear of being shot.
Given a horrific series of fatal shootings in
the last few weeks. I larris' revelations ring all
too alarmingly true. In January alone, at least
15 shootings ravaged Hast Palo Alto, includ
ing one that claimed the lives of 13-year-old
Moises Jimenez and 18-year-old Tomas Her
nandez as they stood in broad daylight un

derneath a carport of an apartment complex.
Iliese disturbing episodes of gun violence
are part of a larger epidemic claiming the
lives of nearly 3.(XK) young people in the
United States each year.
But despite this alarming trend. Congress
has generated a series of reactionary gun
policies that have reversed decades of
progress toward a safer society. In 2004, Co
ngress let expire the federal assault weapons
ban. a measure that prohibited the sale of
military-style assault rifles that included
those used by Klebold and Harris in the
Columbine massacre. Just a few months later
Congress granted gun manufacturers immu
nity from lawsuits brought by victims' fami
lies. And the Senate refused to sign a United
Nations protocol against the illicit manufac
turing and trafficking of firearms despite the
fact that the US-initiatcd collapse of Saddam
Hussein's regime led to the single most sig
nificant small arms stockpile transfer in the
world.

Where is the outrage? Why have politi
cians shied away from sensible legislation
that has the potential to save tens of thou
sands of lives in the United States each year?
Why don t we as citizens hold our legislators
accountable tor the bloodshed spilling into
our homes, through our schools, and onto our
streets?
Ihe highly charged political reaction
against sensible gun violence prevention leg
islation has been orchestrated in large part
by the National Rifle Association, one of the
most powerful lobbyist organizations whose
president, Stanford alumna Sandra Froman.
spoke at Stanford yesterday evening. This in
timidating gun lobby has convinced govern
ment officials and the public at large into be
lieving that the Second Amendment protects
an individual s right to own a gun. Rut ac
cording to the Legal Community Against Vi
olence, the US Supreme Court in US v. Miller
rejected claims that the Second
Amendment protects an individual
right to own a firearm Since this
precedent — which has yet to be
overturned — no federal appellate
and district courts from across the
country has invalidated firearm reg
ulations on Second Amendment
grounds.
The gun lobby argues that gun
control will deny people the ability
to protect themselves. But studies
suggest that a gun in the home may
actually pose a greater risk to the
owner and his family than it would to
any potential criminal or invader.
According to Physicians for Social
Responsibility, a study published in
the New England Journal of Medi
cine reported that for every one
time a gun was used for self-protec
tion, 43 gun-related homicides, sui
cides or accidental deaths occurred
among household members.
Especially frustrating is the gun
lobby's uncompromising opposition
to any form of sensible firearm regu
lation. They argue that these laws
simply target responsible gun own

ers rather than criminals. But, ac
cording to the New York Times,
loopholes in a Florida law permitted
citizens to carry concealed weapons
allowed hundreds of criminals to ob
tain firearms despite pleading guilty
or no contest to felonies including
manslaughter, burglary and child
molestation. And despite President
Bush's stated willingness to sign the
reauthorization of the federal as
sault weapons ban, the NRA aggres
sively persuaded a Republican-con
trolled Congress to keep the renew
al of the ban off the agenda.
Measures that seek to reduce the
number of firearms in our communi
ties actually seem to be having a
measurable impact on reducing gun
crime. A study by the Harvard
School of Public Health suggests
that children ages five to 14 living in
the five states with the highest gun
ownership were 16 times more likely
to die from unintentional firearm in
juries,? times more likely to die from
firearm suicide and 3 times more
likely to die from firearm homicides
compared to children of the same
age living in the five states with the
lowest gun ownership. This correla
tion suggests that lawmakers can in
deed save the lives of children by
limiting the number of firearms
readily available in our homes and

on our streets.
Eric Harris ominously warned us
of the consequences of shirking our
respons-bility to take whatever
measures necessary to protect our
children. Many gun owners worry
about a slippery slope that would ac
company any form of regulation.
But this concern cannot stand in the
way of common-sense legislation
that can help end the bloodshed. In
cities where turf wars are common
place occurrences, where being
caught in the crossfire is a part of
everyday life, remember to look at
the faces of school children in Los
Angeles, in New York, in East Palo
Alto and in the hundreds of other
places across this country where
young lives are cut far too short by
gun violence each year. Gaze at their
lopsided grins and the sparkle in
their eyes and tell us that their lives
are not worth saving.
