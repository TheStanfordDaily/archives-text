## More guns, more crime: Columbine revisited 
### NIKO THEO MILONOPOULOS 
In an essay released last year by investiga
tors ol the 1999 Columbine High School mas
sacre, 18-year-old gunman Eric Harris
mused. "Students can get weapons into
school too easily and they have [too] much
access to weapons outside of school."
Long before he took the lives of 12 of his
classmates, Harris recognized the societal
loophole that allowed him and 17-year-old
Dylan Klebold to commit one of the worst
American atrocities of the last century â€” the
result of a liberal gun culture that prizes
more highly a right to wield a rifle than a
right to live without the fear of being shot.
Given a horrific series of fatal shootings in
the last few weeks. I larris' revelations ring all
too alarmingly true. In January alone, at least
15 shootings ravaged Hast Palo Alto, includ
ing one that claimed the lives of 13-year-old
Moises Jimenez and 18-year-old Tomas Her
nandez as they stood in broad daylight un

derneath a carport of an apartment complex.
Iliese disturbing episodes of gun violence
are part of a larger epidemic claiming the
lives of nearly 3.(XK) young people in the
United States each year.
But despite this alarming trend. Congress
has generated a series of reactionary gun
policies that have reversed decades of
progress toward a safer society. In 2004, Co
ngress let expire the federal assault weapons
ban. a measure that prohibited the sale of
military-style assault rifles that included
those used by Klebold and Harris in the
Columbine massacre. Just a few months later
Congress granted gun manufacturers immu
nity from lawsuits brought by victims' fami
lies. And the Senate refused to sign a United
Nations protocol against the illicit manufac
turing and trafficking of firearms despite the
fact that the US-initiatcd collapse of Saddam
Hussein's regime led to the single most sig
nificant small arms stockpile transfer in the
world.

Where is the outrage? Why have politi
cians shied away from sensible legislation
that has the potential to save tens of thou
sands of lives in the United States each year?
Why don t we as citizens hold our legislators
accountable tor the bloodshed spilling into
our homes, through our schools, and onto our
streets?
Ihe highly charged political reaction
against sensible gun violence prevention leg
islation has been orchestrated in large part
by the National Rifle Association, one of the
most powerful lobbyist organizations whose
president, Stanford alumna Sandra Froman.
spoke at Stanford yesterday evening. This in
timidating gun lobby has convinced govern
ment officials and the public at large into be
lieving that the Second Amendment protects
an individual s right to own a gun. Rut ac
