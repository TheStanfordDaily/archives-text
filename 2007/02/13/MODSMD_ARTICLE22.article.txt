MATCH NOTES: Stanford gets a chance to
avenge their defeat last week at the
hands of UC-lrvine when the Anteaters
come to the Farm this weekend. Irvine
dropped to No. 3 in the rankings after
being upset by No. 13 Pacific last week
end. After their Friday evening showdown
against the Anteaters, the Cardinal will
get ready to play host to the visiting Bru
ins as the second half of the MPSF sea
son gets underway.

Stanford men's volleyball had one of its
best offensive performances of the season
this weekend, but it was not quite enough
to win against a pair of tough opponents in
southern California. The Cardinal lost all
six games in its two weekend matches,
three of them by an agonizingly close mar
gin of only two points.
Coming off an upset of top-ranked
8YU,N0.3 UC-lrvine (12-3,7-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) kept up its mo- t
mentum, notching a 30-28, 30-22, 30-22
sweep over Stanford (1-13,1 -8) on Friday.
Stanford stayed with No. 6 UCLA (7-6,
5-5) point for point through most of Satur
day's match, but couldn't quite finish,
dropping the match in three games, 30-25,
30-28,34-32.
The Cardinal have played close games
throughout the season, but has too often
come up short. Although Stanford has
won one game by a score of 30-28 this sea
son, it has lost by that same score seven
times while falling twice in games that
went past 30.
"The big picture is there for us." head
coach John Kostv said. "To start winning
the 28-30 games, we need to concentrate
on the little plays, just getting the one or
two more points we need to get over this
hump It comes down to one missed serve
here, a hitting error there or a missed dig
opportunity. Making those little plays is
key."
The Cardinal raced out to a 6-2 lead in
the first game against Irvine on Friday,
powered by freshman setter Kawika
Shoji's pair of solo blocks. Stanford was
within three points of victory when the
Anteaters came alive, turning a three
point deficit into a 28-27 lead. A kill by
Cardinal junior outside hitter Matt Ceran
tied the game, but UCI got the points they
needed for the 30-28 win.
"In the Irvine match, we were up. and
then it came down to not being able to side
out consistently." Kosty said. "We gave up
a run late in the first game — they scored
25 through 28 — and we couldn't rebound

that late in the game."
Irvine began the second game with an
other run, jumping ahead 7-1. Stanford
could not fight back to close the gap and
lost the game, 30-22. I lie Anteaters held
the Cardinal to negative hitting, forcing 11
offensive errors while only making three
of their own.
Stanford bounced back to keep the
third game close early on. trailing by just
one. But UCI pulled ahead with five
straight points, leaving the Cardinal be
hind for good. Again, Stanford was too far
behind too late in the game to threaten the
Anteaters, ultimately falling 30-22 as
Irvine completed the sweep.
Ceran had nine kills to lead the Cardi
nal. while sophomore middle blocker
Brandon Williams and freshman opposite
Evan Romero each chipped in seven. No
other Stanford hitter finished with more
than two. Struggling on offense in the last
two games, the Cardinal hit only .075 for

the match, while the Anteaters rolled with
a .347 percentage.
Williams led with four ol Stanford's six
blocks -UCI finished with ll\p>—and
Shoji had a match -high 10 digs to go with
his 27 assists.
The Cardinal cut down on the errors
against UCLA the following night, but it
was still not enough to avoid the weekend
sweep.
Both teams came out swinging in the
first game, each hitting over .400 in the
frame, but the Bruins claimed the 30-25
victory.
In the second game, the Cardinal's of
fensive efficiency dropped off. but the
score was closer, as U( I A barely eked out
the 30-28 victory. ITie Bruins then clinched
the sweep with a heartbreaking win in
extra points in the third game.

our opportunities to win it. but it was
not making the little plays that hurt us.
In the third game, we did a good job
lighting back to tie at 30-30, but we
could not get that one swing that
would put us up an advantage and
serving for the game."
Ceran again led the Stanford of
fense on Saturday.notching IS kills —
twice his output against the Anteaters.
Romero added 10 kills while Williams

had nine and hit .500 on the match. As
a team, the Cardinal hit .323 in the
match, including .458 in the first game.
Stanford out blocked IK'I. A by a
margin of five to four, with Williams
tallying three total, including a pair of
solos. Sophomore libero Jarod Keller
dug a match-high 10 balls for the Car
dinal.
"We definitely improved, and I
thought we played very well on Satur
day." Kosty said. "'lhe big thing that
we have been doing in practice has
been tryingtoeliminate our hitting er
rors and we did that, especially in
game one."
Stanford will get a chance to re
verse this weekend's results when

Irvine and I'( I A come to Palo Alto
this Friday and Saturday as the second
half of the MPSb season gets under
way
"I think there is a confidence fac
tor." Kosty said. "|( )ur players] knew
that they were in the match against
Irvine and had the opportunity to take
game one. which could have turned
around the whole match. And at
IJCI A. we had our opportunities to
go up two games to one and play for
the win in Pauley Pavilion. 1 think we
were mostly mad at ourselves that we
didn't take advantage."

six games in its two weekend matches,
three of them by an agonizingly close mar
gin of only two points.
Coming off an upset of top-ranked
8YU,N0.3 UC-lrvine (12-3,7-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) kept up its mo- t
mentum, notching a 30-28, 30-22, 30-22
sweep over Stanford (1-13,1 -8) on Friday.
Stanford stayed with No. 6 UCLA (7-6,
5-5) point for point through most of Satur
day's match, but couldn't quite finish,
dropping the match in three games, 30-25,
30-28,34-32.
The Cardinal have played close games
throughout the season, but has too often
come up short. Although Stanford has
won one game by a score of 30-28 this sea
son, it has lost by that same score seven
times while falling twice in games that
went past 30.
"The big picture is there for us." head
coach John Kostv said. "To start winning
the 28-30 games, we need to concentrate
on the little plays, just getting the one or
two more points we need to get over this
hump It comes down to one missed serve
here, a hitting error there or a missed dig
opportunity. Making those little plays is
key."
The Cardinal raced out to a 6-2 lead in
the first game against Irvine on Friday,
powered by freshman setter Kawika
Shoji's pair of solo blocks. Stanford was
within three points of victory when the
Anteaters came alive, turning a three
point deficit into a 28-27 lead. A kill by
Cardinal junior outside hitter Matt Ceran
tied the game, but UCI got the points they
needed for the 30-28 win.
"In the Irvine match, we were up. and
then it came down to not being able to side
out consistently." Kosty said. "We gave up
a run late in the first game — they scored
25 through 28 — and we couldn't rebound

that late in the game."
Irvine began the second game with an
other run, jumping ahead 7-1. Stanford
could not fight back to close the gap and
lost the game, 30-22. I lie Anteaters held
the Cardinal to negative hitting, forcing 11
offensive errors while only making three
of their own.
Stanford bounced back to keep the
third game close early on. trailing by just
one. But UCI pulled ahead with five
straight points, leaving the Cardinal be
hind for good. Again, Stanford was too far
behind too late in the game to threaten the
Anteaters, ultimately falling 30-22 as
Irvine completed the sweep.
Ceran had nine kills to lead the Cardi
nal. while sophomore middle blocker
Brandon Williams and freshman opposite
Evan Romero each chipped in seven. No
other Stanford hitter finished with more
than two. Struggling on offense in the last
two games, the Cardinal hit only .075 for

the match, while the Anteaters rolled with
a .347 percentage.
Williams led with four ol Stanford's six
blocks -UCI finished with ll\p>—and
Shoji had a match -high 10 digs to go with
his 27 assists.
The Cardinal cut down on the errors
against UCLA the following night, but it
was still not enough to avoid the weekend
sweep.
Both teams came out swinging in the
first game, each hitting over .400 in the
frame, but the Bruins claimed the 30-25
victory.
In the second game, the Cardinal's of
fensive efficiency dropped off. but the
score was closer, as U( I A barely eked out
the 30-28 victory. ITie Bruins then clinched
the sweep with a heartbreaking win in
extra points in the third game.

and gave it up." Kosty said. "We had
our opportunities to win it. but it was
not making the little plays that hurt us.
In the third game, we did a good job
lighting back to tie at 30-30, but we
could not get that one swing that
would put us up an advantage and
serving for the game."
Ceran again led the Stanford of
fense on Saturday.notching IS kills —
twice his output against the Anteaters.
Romero added 10 kills while Williams

had nine and hit .500 on the match. As
a team, the Cardinal hit .323 in the
match, including .458 in the first game.
Stanford out blocked IK'I. A by a
margin of five to four, with Williams
tallying three total, including a pair of
solos. Sophomore libero Jarod Keller
dug a match-high 10 balls for the Car
dinal.
"We definitely improved, and I
thought we played very well on Satur
day." Kosty said. "'lhe big thing that
we have been doing in practice has
been tryingtoeliminate our hitting er
rors and we did that, especially in
game one."
Stanford will get a chance to re
verse this weekend's results when

Irvine and I'( I A come to Palo Alto
this Friday and Saturday as the second
half of the MPSb season gets under
way
"I think there is a confidence fac
tor." Kosty said. "|( )ur players] knew
that they were in the match against
Irvine and had the opportunity to take
game one. which could have turned
around the whole match. And at
IJCI A. we had our opportunities to
go up two games to one and play for
the win in Pauley Pavilion. 1 think we
were mostly mad at ourselves that we
didn't take advantage."
