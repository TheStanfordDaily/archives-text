# To take the high road or the low?

### 
Let me preface this week's col
umn with this: 1 am a Mexican
soccer fan.
Yes, I wore a green jersey with the
"Tricolor" in my hands while watch
ing Wednesday's game against the
U.S. I stood, right hand perpendicular
to my heart, singing the words ot
"Mexicanos.Al Gritode Guerra and
sat down during the playing of the
"Star Spangled Banner."
And only one silly political science
midterm kept me from braving an 11-
hour drive to Phoenix in hopes ol
watching Mexico beat the Americans
on U.S. soil for the first time this cen
tury. Instead, I watched the game
along with my friends â€” our eyes
glued to the screen, and our hands
ready to catch the tears falling from
our faces.
A timing error by a Mexican de
fender and a happenstance referee
interference led the U.S. to the 2-0
win in front of an Arizona crowd
clearly supporting the Mexican "se
leccion."
All that said, I'm not about to cry
foul about the Americans' lucky win.
Rather, what fans saw last Wednes
day was an embarrassment for soccer
everywhere. The Tricolores' lack ot
sportsmanship throughout and after
the match offers just another reason
for Americans to dismiss football as a
wannabe sport in a nation dominated
by more mainstream athletics.
Mexico came into the match with
a vendetta. It was clear the seleccion
didn't want to lose to the U.S. for the
ninth time since 2(MX).
