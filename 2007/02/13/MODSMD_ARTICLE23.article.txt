# To take the high road or the low?
## 
### 
Let me preface this week's col
umn with this: 1 am a Mexican
soccer fan.
Yes, I wore a green jersey with the
"Tricolor" in my hands while watch
ing Wednesday's game against the
U.S. I stood, right hand perpendicular
to my heart, singing the words ot
"Mexicanos.Al Gritode Guerra and
sat down during the playing of the
"Star Spangled Banner."
And only one silly political science
midterm kept me from braving an 11-
hour drive to Phoenix in hopes ol
watching Mexico beat the Americans
on U.S. soil for the first time this cen
tury. Instead, I watched the game
along with my friends — our eyes
glued to the screen, and our hands
ready to catch the tears falling from
our faces.
A timing error by a Mexican de
fender and a happenstance referee
interference led the U.S. to the 2-0
win in front of an Arizona crowd
clearly supporting the Mexican "se
leccion."
All that said, I'm not about to cry
foul about the Americans' lucky win.
Rather, what fans saw last Wednes
day was an embarrassment for soccer
everywhere. The Tricolores' lack ot
sportsmanship throughout and after
the match offers just another reason
for Americans to dismiss football as a
wannabe sport in a nation dominated
by more mainstream athletics.
Mexico came into the match with
a vendetta. It was clear the seleccion
didn't want to lose to the U.S. for the
ninth time since 2(MX).

Following the loss, the Mexican
squad walked off the field without
shaking the Americans' hands and
exchanging jerseys — a customary
gesture following international play.
Now, 1 can understand Mexico's frus
tration over losing to a team whose
fans number less than the readership
of The Stanford Review, but it is no
cause for poor sportsmanship. It is
this kind of attitude that generates
racial hostility in a sport that is sup
posed to bring people together; I
can't even begin to describe some of
the bigoted comments 1 found on
various websites following the
events.
Following Landon Donovan's
game-winning goal, Mexican keeper
Oswaldo Sanchez attempted some
sort of inexcusable slide tackle on the
U.S.' Eddie Johnson.This action took
place after play had been stopped,
thus makinu it clear that Sanchez was

acting completely out of frustration.
I can understand some of the
cause for animosity, though. Dono
van in particular described Mexico's
sportsmanship as "poor," citing the
Americans' good will when they play
in Mexico. Yet Donovan nearly creat
ed an international incident by uri
nating on a sacred Guadalajara foot
ball field in 2(X)4 without ever apolo
gizing. But even after such a distaste
ful act by Donovan. Mexico needed
to step up Wednesday and be the big
ger men. Again, however, they failed.
After the loss, the team sang the
tune that's become all too familiar to
Mexican fans everywhere.
"The result was unjust," Mexican
head coach Hugo Sanchez said. "This
is a unique game in that you can de
serve to win and still lose. We de
served to win and they did not."
Sure, the U.S. didn't play all that
well, but neither did Mexico. The
Mexican squad may have made a
mistake in calling players from Eu
rope for a friendly game, and in de
ciding to start the ageless, yet slow,
Jared Borghetti at forward. TTie se
lection also made another mistake

by considering the contest much
more crucial than the Americans that
have dominated the match for so
many years considered it to be.
Mexico did dominate the game in
the mid-field, but for some reason or
another, the Tri just couldn't seem to
figure out that the American offense
relies on quick strikes. The Red,
White and Blue's gameplay isn't that
hard to figure out: Make them pass
the ball and force their way up the
field.
That said, Mexican soccer took a
giant step back last Wednesday, both
on and off the field. But before
American fans get too excited about
the results, remember that you still
got a long way to go over the next
four years, and that not every match
is going to be against Mexico.
Oh. and sooner or later, you're
going to have to travel down to the
Estadio Azteca — over 7,000 feet
above sea level and packed with
130.000 fans cheering for the Tri.
