## Sharpshooter Goods hobbled by bum ankle 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's basketball received a double
dose of bad news today when it learned that it will
be without a key player this weekend and that it

fell out of the Associated Press top-25 poll.
Sophomore guard Anthony Goods will miss
this weekend's games against Oregon State and
Oregon after suffering a high ankle sprain on
Sunday against Washington, coach Trent Johnson
announced today.
Goods injured his left ankle eight minutes into
the second halt when he collided with a Washing
ton player. After lying on the tloor clutching the
ankle, he attempted to walk on his own before
leaving the game for good.
Johnson said it "remains to be seen" when
Goods will play again.'Hie team confirmed that

the sophomore would miss action this weekend,
with further play pending the results of an MRI
next week.
"I feel for Anthony," Johnson said."He's had a
heck of a season up to this point."
Goods is second on the team in scoring, averaging
13 points per game. Sophomore guard Mitch
Johnson is expected to start in Goods' place this
weekend, when the Cardinal take on Oregon
State and No. 15 Oregon at home on Thursday
and Saturday, respectively.
