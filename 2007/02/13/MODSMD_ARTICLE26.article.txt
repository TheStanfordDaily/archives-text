"That's one thing that 1 think we
continue to stress to our guys: that
the\ need to just go out there and
light as hard as they can," McCoy
said. " IViey fought hard, hut maybe
they could have fought a little bit
harder [against Boise State]. And that
\\ as disappointing.seeing them go out
there and not able to win that battle."
Stanford was only able to pick up
four wins against Boise State, one of
which came by forfeit as No. 15 junior
Josh Zupancic at 157 pounds earned
six points for the Cardinal. N0.3 junior

"I sen though we didn't wrestle our
best, we still wrestled better than we

Sunday. Stanford wrestled a pair of
duals against No. 18 Oregon State (17-
2.7-1) and Portland State (1-15.0-7).
11k- Cardinal's noon match against

ries in the contest. Gardner and
(iiesen continued their winning ways,
with Gardner notching a pin against
Oregon State's Jake Gonzales at 2:4b,
while Giesen picked up his 25th win of

"[Giescn's) a special kid,and that's
why we were really happy when he
decided to come here," McCoy said,
"lie's still a freshman, he's 18 years
and old and he still has adjustments to
make. But he's pretty good now and
still has plenty of room for improve
ment.
"We thought he could be a confer
ence champ and an All-American this
year." McCoy continued. "And when
we first told him that, he was kind of
taken aback. At the start of the year
he had some rough starts, but now I
think he's really starting to believe it."
Zupancic, who suffered a tough
defeat in his previous match, against
Cal Poly's Chase Pami. got back on
track bv defeating Oregon State's
Keegan Davis, 8-o.The Stanford jun
ior went on to sweep his weekend
competition with two wins, one com
ing by pin. and the other by forfeit.

"Josh was a little bit clown about
the performance [against Parni],"
McCoy said. "He just needed to get
out and go after guys and score some
points, and that's what he did. He
went out there against Oregon State
and against Portland State and really
put himself in a good position with
those matches, and he's getting ready
for the big match this weekend ;md at
the Pac-10 Tournament."
The Cardinal finished their week
end with a dominant 36-9 victory over
Portland State, as Gardner and Zu

Redshirt junior Phillip Doerner closed out Stanford's emphatic 36-9 victory over Portland State on Sunday by posting a 3-1
overtime win in the heavyweight event. Like the Cardinal, Doerner's record for the weekend finished up at 1 -2.
"That's one thing that 1 think we
continue to stress to our guys: that
the\ need to just go out there and
light as hard as they can," McCoy
said. " IViey fought hard, hut maybe
they could have fought a little bit
harder [against Boise State]. And that
\\ as disappointing.seeing them go out
there and not able to win that battle."
Stanford was only able to pick up
four wins against Boise State, one of
which came by forfeit as No. 15 junior
Josh Zupancic at 157 pounds earned
six points for the Cardinal. N0.3 junior
Tanner (iardner at 125 pounds, senior
Brian Perry at 165 pounds and true
freshman Zack Giesen at 184 pounds
were the only Stanford wrestlers who
managed to overcome their oppo
nents. Gardner's win brought his over
all record on the year to 30-3.
Despite his team's loss, McCoy
was encouraged by the improvement
he continued to see from the Cardi
nal, even in defeat.
"Overall, everyone wrestled bet
ter. and that's the goal," McCoy said.
"I sen though we didn't wrestle our
best, we still wrestled better than we
did last week or the week before that."
Sunday. Stanford wrestled a pair of
duals against No. 18 Oregon State (17-
2.7-1) and Portland State (1-15.0-7).
11k- Cardinal's noon match against
the Beavers was another difficult
challenge for Stanford. Oregon State
picked up the win, 31-13, but the Car
dinal managed to gain some key victo
ries in the contest. Gardner and
(iiesen continued their winning ways,
with Gardner notching a pin against
Oregon State's Jake Gonzales at 2:4b,
while Giesen picked up his 25th win of
the year, a Stanford freshman record.
"[Giescn's) a special kid,and that's
why we were really happy when he
decided to come here," McCoy said,
"lie's still a freshman, he's 18 years
and old and he still has adjustments to
make. But he's pretty good now and
still has plenty of room for improve
ment.
"We thought he could be a confer
ence champ and an All-American this
year." McCoy continued. "And when
we first told him that, he was kind of
taken aback. At the start of the year
he had some rough starts, but now I
think he's really starting to believe it."
Zupancic, who suffered a tough
defeat in his previous match, against
Cal Poly's Chase Pami. got back on
track bv defeating Oregon State's
Keegan Davis, 8-o.The Stanford jun
