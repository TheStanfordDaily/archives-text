# Announcement: ASSU seeks candidates
## 
### ASHLEY ANDERSON 
If you have begun to see Bill Clin
ton flyers posted around campus
urging you to "BE A LEADER"
don't worry that you've stumbled
upon an alternate reality, its just a
clear sign that elections season is fi
nally upon us. This year the elections
commission is searching for innova
tive ways to bring more Stanford Stu
dents to the podium and the polls, in
cluding a creative ad campaign for
their upcoming Candidate Informa
tion Sessions.
Of the upcoming sessions Assis
tant Elections Commissioner Ashley
Anderson says."It is very important
to the Commission that we increase

enthusiasm among students to run
for positions in the ASSU. We want
to make sure that people have a
number of candidates to choose
from in the elections."
The information sessions, which
seek to provide potential candidates
with the information they need to
know before beginning the elections
process, will be held for both the un
dergraduate and graduate communi
ties at Stanford.
There are a few changes in the
works for this year's election. This
includes a clarification of some rules
regarding campaigning, including
the first formal definition of cam
paigning written into the ASSU
Joint governing Bylaws. "A simpli

fied, clear set of rules allows the
Elections Commission and the Can
didates themselves to enjoy a sense
of legitimacy in the Spring Elec
tions." stated Bernard Fraga, the
2007 ASSU Elections Commission
er.
Candidate informational sessions
will be held on Feb. 15.20 and 22. and
are an opportunity for students to
learn about the positions open in the
election and how the campaigning
process works. The annual ASSU
Spring Election will be on April 11
and 12.

Ashley Anderson '09 is ASSU assis
tant flections commissioner. She can
