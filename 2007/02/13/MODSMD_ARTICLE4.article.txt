### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After her talk Monday night, NRA
President and Stanford alum Sandra lor
man '71 sat down with reporters to talk
about the NRA's growth, the changing
political tide in Washington and her lega
cy as president. I lere are some selections

from the interview:
On the political atmosphere when slic was
at Stanford in the late 1960s anil early
19705:
"Are things the same or are they dif
ferent? Are people still as free to speak
out as when I was a student here? I
mean, ii was a very eontroversial
time ami ii was pretty much free ami
open debate. And a lot of very con
troversial tilings happened since
then I'd love to hear what you guys
sa\ about that."
On the political atmosphere in
Washington, now that the De
mocrats have taken control of Con
gress:
"We know that some of the De
mocrats are pro-gun. Some ol the
Democrats were elected on pro-gun
platforms.and we hope that the\ will
be true to their campaign promises.
But we don't know until things come
up for a vote, so that remains to be
seen.
"We hope that they will support
the right to keep and bear arms; we
hope they know that's important to
their constituents. But I think the
temptation will be very great for
many of them to side with the De
mocratic leadership. Nanc\ Pelosi.
( "buck Schumcr. I lilar\ ('linton and
those people who are avowedly anti
gun."
On the Nl<As choice among the
candidates for the 2<)<)X I*residential
election:
"We'll wait and see what happens
in the primaries. Iliis is longest pres
idential election in history, from the
start, and I think a lot of things can
happen between now and Novem
ber 2008. As we say. we're going to
'keep our powder dry.'"
On how the NRA is doing as an
organizatif >n in terms < >/'membership
and growth:
" Ihe NRA kind of cycles. When
we're really successful, when we pass
good legislation like we did this past
year, when we resist bad legislation,
when we have our candidates win.
our members tend to think there's

no more threat. I "hen things change,
like in the last election.so c\ ervthing
is starting to get activating again.
"The organization is the
strongest it's been since I've been on
the NRA board of directors, which
has been 15 years. Anil it a major
political force in America.
"What I continue to find amazing
is that we do so much with so little.
People don't realize we really don't
have a lot of people; we really have a
very sparce staff. And we're really
able to accomplish a lot. Mostly be
cause we have a lot of credibility on
the |( apitol] I lill.wc always back up
what we sa\ with empirical data and
our lobbyists are really well respect
ed.
()n the ,\RA in post 9/11 America:
"I've gotten so many more in
quires from women after 9/11 about
gun ownership â€” how can they
learn, what kind of gun should they
buy? The\ want to make sure their
family is safe and secure. There is a
real emphasis on safety and security
and on being secure in the home.
Being ready for the unexpected.
"People realized that your world
can change in an instant.That's what
happened to me."
()n In m < >ften she carries a gnn:
"Whenever I can. I can't in Cali
fornia. and you can't, obviously, on
the airplane. When I'm in Arizona. I
have <i gun on me prett\ much all the
time. Sometimes I have two."
()n her legacy as NRA president:
"()ne of the things I concentrated
on rcalh intently was building a
good financial future for the organi
zation. I Universities like Stanford or
other universities have huge endow
ments.and that's how the\ fund their
operations. Ihe NRA is still playing
catch up. We still need to be better of
making sure we have a secure finan
cial foundation to continue to pro
tect this fundamental right."
