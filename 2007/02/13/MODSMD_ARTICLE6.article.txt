## Pot-like chemicals heal disease Molecules similar to marijuana decrease effects of Parkinson's disease in mice 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Smokinji pot is not an effective cure for
j Parkinson's disease, according to Psychiatry
and Behavioral Sciences Prof. Robert Malen
j ka. lint a study by Malenka and co-author
Anatol Kreitzer that was published in "Na
ture" last week indicates that increased levels
ol molecules similar to the active ingredient in
marijuana can rescue mice from Parkinson's
like symptoms.
Drugs that reduce the degradation of these
molecules, called endocannabinoids or
cannabinoids, were used in the study in con
junction with currently available dopamine
drugs to treat the mice. Cannabinoids are nat
urally produced molecules similar tol l IC. the
active ingredient in marijuana.
"If we gave dopamine drugs to these mice
we got a little bit of effect, but if we gave the
two drugs together, we got a whopping ef
fect." Malenka told The Daily in an interview.
I le added that new treatments for humans
with Parkinson's disease will probably not be
available for another 15 years, despite the ad
vancements made in the recent study.
Kreitzer. a Stanford researcher who is now
an assistant professor of psychology and neu
rology at UC-San Francisco, thinks future re
search will show that dopamine is involved in
chemically motivating movement. Movement,
he said, is related to the chemical systems re
sponsible for motivation in ways that scientists
do not fully understand. But he thinks it is not
entirely coincidental that the cannabinoids
that affect movement are so similar in form to
the recreational drug marijuana.
" This is getting philosophical but the idea
in evolution is that in order to do something,
animals had to be rewarded." he said. "So
movement and reward are related at least in
their neural substrates."
In their study. Kreit/er and Malenka aimed
to illuminate parts of the "black box" of un
known neurological circuitry brain wiring
that lies in between the current under
standing of the cause of Parkinson's and the
disease's outward symptoms.
The wiring of the brain relevant to Parkin-
