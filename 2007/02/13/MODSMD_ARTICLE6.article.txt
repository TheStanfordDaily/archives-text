## Pot-like chemicals heal disease Molecules similar to marijuana decrease effects of Parkinson's disease in mice 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Smokinji pot is not an effective cure for
j Parkinson's disease, according to Psychiatry
and Behavioral Sciences Prof. Robert Malen
j ka. lint a study by Malenka and co-author
Anatol Kreitzer that was published in "Na
ture" last week indicates that increased levels
ol molecules similar to the active ingredient in
marijuana can rescue mice from Parkinson's
like symptoms.
Drugs that reduce the degradation of these
molecules, called endocannabinoids or
cannabinoids, were used in the study in con
junction with currently available dopamine
drugs to treat the mice. Cannabinoids are nat
urally produced molecules similar tol l IC. the
active ingredient in marijuana.
"If we gave dopamine drugs to these mice
we got a little bit of effect, but if we gave the
two drugs together, we got a whopping ef
fect." Malenka told The Daily in an interview.
I le added that new treatments for humans
with Parkinson's disease will probably not be
available for another 15 years, despite the ad
vancements made in the recent study.
Kreitzer. a Stanford researcher who is now
an assistant professor of psychology and neu
rology at UC-San Francisco, thinks future re
search will show that dopamine is involved in
chemically motivating movement. Movement,
he said, is related to the chemical systems re
sponsible for motivation in ways that scientists
do not fully understand. But he thinks it is not
entirely coincidental that the cannabinoids
that affect movement are so similar in form to
the recreational drug marijuana.
" This is getting philosophical but the idea
in evolution is that in order to do something,
animals had to be rewarded." he said. "So
movement and reward are related at least in
their neural substrates."
In their study. Kreit/er and Malenka aimed
to illuminate parts of the "black box" of un
known neurological circuitry brain wiring
that lies in between the current under
standing of the cause of Parkinson's and the
disease's outward symptoms.
The wiring of the brain relevant to Parkin-
son's is best understood as a sort *.>1
signaling relay, where dopamine trig
gers a brain cell to communicate to
the next cell down the line. In a sort
ol convoluted relay reminiscent of an
electrical circuit, this signaling con
tinues until motor output is pro
duced. In Parkinson's victims, how
ever, that motor output is Hawed.
According to Kreit/er. new un
derstanding ol the signaling mecha
nisms that underlie Parkinson's may
over time lead to new treatments lor
the brain disorder.
"By understanding this whole cir
cuit you can rationally design new
therapies." he said.
Prior to this study, researchers
knew that Parkinson's was caused
by a depletion of dopamine in a re
gion of the brain called the stria
tum. 'Ilie striatum is located in the
forebrain and is associated with
both movement and addictive dis
orders like obsessive-compulsive
disorder. Kreit/er said. Without
normal dopamine signals in the
striatum, the body's motor func
tions can become impaired. This
condition, known as Parkinson's
disease, can include tremors and
rigid slowness.
Kreit/er and Malenka wanted to
determine how dopamine loss could

lead to such ellects.
Ilie researchers found the next
step in the Parkinsons signaling
relay a neural circuit called the "in
direct pathway" Ihe reduction ol
dopamine input to that circuit. the>
discovered, can cause Parkinson's
like motor deficiencies in mice.
Iliey also found that the critical
step in the changed circuitry was a
chemical signal carried In cannabi
noids. In mice with Parkinson's
symptoms, cannabinoids can perma
nently reduce the number of neural
signals that traverse the indirect
pathway Ihose signals .ire necessar\
for normal movement.
'I lie study also found th.it cou
pling increased cannabinoid levels
with current dopamine replacement
drugs greatly reduces Parkinson's
symptoms. Ihcse drugs can there
fore "rescue" mice from the disease
Malcnka's future research will
continue to focus on dopamine in
the brain.
"We want to poke further into
other actions of dopamine." he s.tid.
lie emphasized that the findings
do not indicate in any way that
smoking marijuana is a cure for
Parkinson's disease.
"Smoking pot is not the same
thing." Malenka said. "[ln smoking],
you are indiscriminately going to be
activating cannabinoid pathways all
over the brain."
