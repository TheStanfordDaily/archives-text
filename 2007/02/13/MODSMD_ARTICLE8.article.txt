# Driven to the Nobel Prize
## Kornberg's inexhaustable work ethic praised "There isn't a question in science that you can't get absorbed in and find fascinating to pursue." 
### SAM BHAGWAT PAGE 2 EDITOR 
There was no single "Eureka!"
moment in the work leading to
Structural Biology Prof. Roger
Kornberg's recent Nobel Prize.
Rut research associate Dave
Rushnell recalled the excitement
of a day in December 2000 when
one ol the key discoveries re
fining a computer model of a key
molecule to decipher its structure
was made.
"I very hour he was coming in
and interrupting us. saying.'What
do the new maps look like? What
can you see now?'" Rushnell said,
imitating Kornberg's animation
that day"I llien postdoctoral stu
dent| Patrick Cramer actually
said.'()ne day we'll be toasting
him all in Stockholm. "
Today. m\ years after that key
refinement was completed and
two months after he traveled to

Sweden to accept the 2006 Nobel
Prize in Chemistry. Kornberg is
sanguine about his accomplish
ment.


ROGER KORNBERG
' It was nice to get a pat on the hack," he
said. "But the challenge now is to tend off all
the extraneous things and to keep focused
on these central issues, which haven't
changed."
Romberg remains fascinated with science.
Soft-spoken, his words are descriptive rather
than flowery. I lis ethos resounds with sinceri
ty. I le describes himself as a man devoted to
understanding the fundamental structure of
the world through his research.
"There isn't a question in science that you
can't get absorbed in and find fascinating to
pursue," he said. "The goal is to solve the prob
lem. and the satisfaction comes from succeed
ing."
kornberg is undoubtedly dedicated to the
work that he does. Associates say that he has
few hobbies and rarely attends social events.
"Roger works a lot — he'll work as many
hours as you let him." said his wife. Yahli
Lorch. who works in his lab and is a professor
of structural biology, it's the only thing he
wishes to do."
"Roger is 99 percent science." Bushnell
said."But he knows everyone's not like that."
As a result. Kornberg's doctoral and post
doe researchers describe their work environ
ment and the temperament of the man who

runs it as easy-going, in contrast to other labs
run by professors whose names they mutter
under their breath.
it's a very good environment — very re
laxed." post-doc Guillermo Calero said
Indeed, the environment in Kornberg's lab
oratory on the first floor of the Fairchild Sci
ence Building, said his researchers, is reflective
of the Nobel Prize winner's leadership style.
Bushnell, along with post-doc Phil Robinson,
said the lab environment emphasizes individ
ual initiative, with students working on proj
ects individually or in small groups, consulting
Kornberg only when necessary.
"He's here if you need help, inspiration [or
have] a question," said Bushnell. "He's not
standing behind you saying." Pipette this now.'"
"Obviously Roger's the boss," said Robin
son, "but you get to decide how to do things."
Kornberg's students appreciate this ap
proach. Bushnell recalled a place he used to
work where "you couldn't even read the San
Jose Mercury News in the lab."
It's the conducive environment, and the
projects researched there, that has kept Bush
nell in Kornberg's lab for almost fourteen
years. 1 le now works as a research associate
rather than a student.
"Roger's one of the most laid-back guys

I've met," Robinson said."He's eternally posi
tive."
That, according to Bushnell. is why Korn
berg runs such a casual work environment.
Personally. Bushnell says, when relaxing, sci
ence will still be on the back of his mind, and

ROGER KORNBERG, professor and Nobel Prize recipient

the times he spends relaxing will give him ideas
for working. He added that Kornberg judges
students by how much they accomplish rather
than setting up strict work schedules.
With his $1 million-plus Nobel prize. Korn
berg. 59. could retire and walk into the sunset,
but instead he hopes to pursue his work for a
good deal longer.
Many of the projects pursued in Kornberg's
lab are long term, evolving over the course of
several years. But because of the pressure to
obtain immediate results, a lab-wide joke has
evolved.

When Kornberg talks about how much
time will be necessary to complete a project,
Bushnell said, "usually the multiplier is about
10-fold. A day is two or three weeks. A month
is a year."Three-months is a longer-term proj
ect, but one about which Kornberg is confi-

dent.
"You don't want to be working on a six
month project," Bushnell joked.
Skewed time horizons aside, Romberg an
ticipates that he will be continuing his work for
a while.
"1 would hope that we'll be here for not five
but 10 or 15 years if all goes well, and that we'll
find solutions to all of these problems," he said.
"The work that led up to the Prize is just the
beginning,"
