# Driven to the Nobel Prize
## Kornberg's inexhaustable work ethic praised "There isn't a question in science that you can't get absorbed in and find fascinating to pursue."

There was no single "Eureka!"
moment in the work leading to
Structural Biology Prof. Roger
Kornberg's recent Nobel Prize.
Rut research associate Dave
Rushnell recalled the excitement
of a day in December 2000 when
one ol the key discoveries re
fining a computer model of a key
molecule to decipher its structure
was made.
"I very hour he was coming in
and interrupting us. saying.'What
do the new maps look like? What
can you see now?'" Rushnell said,
imitating Kornberg's animation
that day"I llien postdoctoral stu
dent| Patrick Cramer actually
said.'()ne day we'll be toasting
him all in Stockholm. "
Today. m\ years after that key
refinement was completed and
two months after he traveled to

Sweden to accept the 2006 Nobel
Prize in Chemistry. Kornberg is
sanguine about his accomplish
ment.
