SACRAMENTO (AP) - Judges
would get more discretion to sen
tence criminals under a bill passed
Tuesday by the state Senate in re
sponse to a recent U.S. Supreme
Court decision.
The court invalidated Califor
nia's current law because it requires
judges to choose the middle of three
sentencing options unless the facts
of a particular case justify a shorter
or longer prison sentence.
By law. many of the factors judges
weigh in that decision are never con
sidered by jurors. The justices said it
is unconstitutional to increase a sen
tence based on facts that were not
found true by a jury.
The Senate bill, sent to the As
sembly on a 36-1 vote, would end the
problem by giving judges the discre
tion to choose any sentence within a
range set by law for a particular
crime.
An estimated 10.000 or more
criminals could seek new sentences
because of the ruling. Each day the
state delays a new sentencing law
means more criminals can file a chal
lenge. said Senate Majority Leader
Gloria Romero, who is carrying the
legislation.
"That's potentially 10.000 addi
tional cases that would wind through
an already congested system."
Romero. D-Los Angeles, said after
the vote. "We've got to stop the
bleeding."
The lone opponent,Sen.Tom Mc
( lintock. R- Iliousand Oaks, said
sentences should be set by a jury, not
a judge as under Romero's bill.
