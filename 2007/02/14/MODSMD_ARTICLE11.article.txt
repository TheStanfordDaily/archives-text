"To state that my career was a choice would be a bit of a stretch"

Sociology Professor David
Grusky describes himself as an "aca
demic's academic" and speaks pas
sionately of "intellectual puzzles"
that captivate the academic audi
ence. Though he thinks that these
traits and actions have in the past
confined his impact to the realm of
academia, in founding the Center for
the Study of Poverty and Inequality
he is spearheading a movement to
make it possible for cutting-edge re
search about poverty and inequality
to have a wider impact on the world.
Though Grusky hails from a long
line of sociologists, he had no real
idea what he wanted to do when he
entered college, though he had a "so
cial relevance criterion." He settled
on sociology, and liked it so much
that he went on to earn his doctorate.
I le now says that "to state that my
career was a choice would be a bit of
a stretch." He said that, finding him
self as a sociology professor "wasn't
me...so much as social forces acting

upon me... it certainly wasn't a
chance outcome." These words per
fectly demonstrate Grusky's tenden
cy to downplay himself and his ac
complishments â€” though any casual
observer can tell that he was driven
by the intensity of his curiosity and a
desire to serve that brightens the
space around him.
As a researcher Grusky has ex
amined questions of inequality, both
with regards to gender and socioeco
nomic status. After many years of
such study, however, he found that he
and other researchers were collect
ing enormous amounts of useful data
and results - but that these results
weren 't diffusing out to non-academ
ics, politicians, and policy makers
currently dealing with poverty and
inequality.
Academics had "created a world

unto itself that's very self-absorbed,"
Grusky said.
This "self-criticism" caused
Grusky to rethink what he wanted to
achieve. He didn't want to exit this
world having focused exclusively on
academic, rather than real-life, prob
lems and puzzles. So he started to
look for ways to apply sociological
data to solving the problems they de
scribed.
His search led him to found the
Stanford Center of the Study of
Poverty and Inequality, intending to
make it"the go-to clearing house for
trend data on poverty and inequality."
With a web-based center for trend
data, journalists, politicians, and poli
cy makers at all levels could have im
mediate access to a wealth of infor
mation, making it possible to monitor
poverty and inequality just as easily as

monitoring economic output

Grusky says that this access is nec
essary now. because his generation
dropped the ball on poverty and in
equality. As a consequence, he says,
every American loses, not just those
afflicted by these diseases. In addition
to seeing the existence of poverty and
inequality as moral problems,Grusky
argues that they create huge exter
nalities through raising crime rates
and increasing the national health
care bill, among other things. In other
words, they affect the bottom line and
should be treated accordingly.

Grusky hopes that his work can help
prepare the next generation to face
the looming spectre of poverty and
remove this social blight.
