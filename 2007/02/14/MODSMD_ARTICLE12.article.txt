# Parking tickets frustrate drivers
## Citations generate over $1 million for county 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
A little orange envelope, pinned
under windshield wipers like a
dreaded referee's flag, is a common
sight in Stanford parking lots.
In fact, more than 35,000 tickets
are doled out yearly to parking of
fenders at the University, according
to Tom Dairy, head of parking affairs
at the Stanford Police Department.
Santa Clara County — which is the
beneficiary of parking violators' mis
steps — receives $1.225 million each
year from the infractions.
People who park at the Univer
sity without a permit, park with the
wrong permit or park for a longer
duration than their permit allows
are slapped with a $35 ticket.
Many students have expressed
frustrated with the frequency with
which these tickets appear.
Katherine Bell '08 said she was
so frustrated that she felt compelled
to start the Facebook group "De
port Stanford Cops to East Palo
Alto."
"What made me mad was the
first day of fall quarter, when I got a
$35 ticket for not having a parking
pass," she said. "The ironic thing was
I discovered it when I was on my
way to buy my pass."
The division of parking lots into
different sections requiring differ
ent passes is frustrating, students
say. Parking is organized based on a
student's housing location, but
some students complain that they
do not always park close to their
residence.
"Setting up separate parking
zones does not discourage driving, it
only increases student frustration,"
said Lindsay Reinsmith '07. "Uni
versity officials are crazy if they
think students are going to walk
across campus late at night in Feb
ruary in the rain. Frankly I don't feel
safe doing that, and I don't neces
sarily feel any safer biking.
"Students are going to drive,
plain and simple," she added. "Set
ting up separate zones only capital
izes on and exploits basic student
needs to drive."
Parking violations are not the

only source of ticket angst on cam
pus. Some students lament being
cited for running stop signs on their
bikes, riding unregistered bikes or
for biking with their headphones.
Bell reports a friend who received a
$118 fine for the latter offense.
"1 mean, really, worse things are
happening in the world than a stu
dent listening to a little music on
their way to class," said Sherie

Gertler '08.
If students wish to contest their
ticket, they must do so in the Small
Claims Division of the Municipal
Court. A form for this is provided

ment Web site at http://police.
