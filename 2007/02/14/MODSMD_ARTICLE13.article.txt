## ASSU talks sweatshop labor Senate passes bill urging Univ to offer counsel 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
ITie ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate passed two significant advocacy
hills at their weekly meeting last
night. One hill recommended that
the ASSU Legal Counseling Policy
Board allow the ASSU Legal Coun
seling Office to provide advice to stu
dents with complaints against the
University, its faculty or its staff.The
other bill was written to ensure
sweat-free labor in factories that pro
duce Stanford apparel.
"The ASSU Legal Counseling
Office has turned away cases involv
ing students in dispute with Stanford,
its faculty or its staff for more than a

decade," said Senate Campus Advo
cacy Committee Chair Mondaire
Jones'o9, who authored the legal ad
vocacy bill.
Jones explained that the ASSU
recommended the change in policy
because the ASSU Legal Counseling
Office is a joint special fees group
funded by undergraduate and gradu
ate students.
" The ASSU Legal Counseling
Office provides counseling services,
not trial advocacy," he said. "We want
to be sure that institutions out of
court are utilized before going to the
next level."
ITie bill would also ensure that
students who are in dispute with the
University but cannot afford legal
counsel have a means to resolve their
issues, he said.
The second bill passed last night
made two recommendations in order
to safeguard against sweat-free labor

in factories producing apparel that
bears the Stanford name.
First, it encouraged the Universi
ty to switch its membership from the
Fair Labor Association to the Work
er Rights Consortium, an organiza
tion with a stronger stance against
sweatshop labor.
Second, the bill urged the Univer
sity to join the Designated Suppliers
Program, which "concentrates ap
parel manufacture within specific
factories in order to make it easier
for independent organizations to
monitor working conditions," ac
cording to the bill. This would pro
vide a better means for the Universi
ty to ensure adequate working con
ditions exist in the factories that pro
duce its apparel, the bill's propo
nents said.
