## GSC to unveil new Web site New page will offer more frequent updates, easier access 
### ANDREW VALENCIA 
Ihe Graduate Student Council (GSC) will soon un
veil a newly updated and revamped Web site to replace
the existing outdated version. The new site is expected
to offer graduate students speedier access to GSC up
dates. as well as general graduate school news and ad
vocacy information.
The new edition will be online as soon as content up
dating is complete, according to GSC webmaster Matt
lurk, a graduate student in physics, who said he expects
the new site to be a vast improvement over the previous
version.
"It will be a much more dynamic page with articles
from dynamic databases,"Turk said.
Students criticize the current GSC Web site because
they say it is difficult for anyone not directly involved
with online maintenance to update and post informa
tion. As a result, students say, many facets of the site re
main outdated; the news section, for example, still lists
GSC plans for the 2004-2005 academic year.
lurk hopes that by allowing all GSC members to

edit the sites content, new information will be posted in
a more timely fashion. Council members agreed this
was a necessary step.
"It's easier for anybody to update, not just the Web
master, and so it will be more up to date." said GSC co-
Chair Paul Gurney, a graduate student in electrical en
gineering. "There are forums and 'wilds' and a
bunch of discussion features that will help us."
The GSC Web site includes information on advoca
cy and funding issues and has links to resources ranging
from childcare and healthcare to academics and cam
pus diversity.
"I think [the Web site) is a place that graduate stu
dents know they can go to for advocacy issues." Gurney
said.
The new site — which will be accessible via a link
from the old site — will be unveiled in stages during the
next two weeks.
link said he hopes the graduate student community
as a whole will benefit from the renovation.
"Putting people in touch with what's going on with
the Graduate Student Council will be advantageous to
everyone," he said.
l.ook for the new GSC Web site in the next few
weeks at http://gsc.stanford.edu.
