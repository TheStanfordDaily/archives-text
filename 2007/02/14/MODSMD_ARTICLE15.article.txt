## Editorial Board Metaphors and guns don't mix 
### 
Metaphors make for good novels and
great poetry. However, in her
speech to a half-empty kresge au
ditorium Monday night. NRA President
Sandra Froman "71 demonstrated the ease
with which a metaphor inserted into politi
cal discourse can polarize, warp and muddle
a divisive issue.
Some ol Froman's metaphors were spe
cific. narrowly articulated points. Her open
ing remarks were a tolerable extended anal
og) comparing constitutional freedoms
such as the right to bear arms to a family
property that has been around for so long
that collective stewardship of this • inheri
tance" has faltered.However. Froman's
words became more difficult to swallow
when she began comparing programs re
quiring gun-safety education programs for
owners of firearms with Jim Crow laws in
the segregated South. Disqualifying voters
for not knowing obscure constitutional triv
ia ma\ he unfair, but in no way is it compa
rable to requiring that gun owners know
how to operate a deadly weapon. One won
ders where Froman stands on requiring
drivers to understand traffic laws and know

how to operate their vehicles — a more ap
propriate metaphor by any means.
I roman's other metaphors were broad
attempts to reframe the terms of the gun
control/right to bear arms debate. Froman
specifically mentioned guns only anecdotal
ly during her speech, choosing instead to
focus on defending "outspoken points of
view" and "a marketplace of ideas that isn't
policed." In a rather dubious analogy, she
likened former NRA president Charlton
1 leston to Thomas Paine and Martin Luther
King, Jr. for his willingness to vocally sup
port racial integration in Hollywood's
Screen Actor's Guild and, later, gun rights
with the NRA.
lo some extent, all metaphors require
some suspension of belief on the part of the
listener. One thing really is not like another,
and we are all more likely to accept that one
thing may be reasonably compared to an
other when we agree with the viewpoint and
worldview of the speaker. Fromer's speech,
however, was so laden with imprecise
metaphors that it obscured the real issues at
stake in Second Amendment and gun con
trol debates.
