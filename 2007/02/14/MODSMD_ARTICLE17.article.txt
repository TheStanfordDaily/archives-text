# My father, the You Tube phenomenon
## 
### 
A few days ago. 1 had the terrible
shock of a lifetime: my father sub
scribed to my videos on You Tube.
My father is on You lube. My initial reac
tion was one of confusion, unwelcome real
ization of the profound perversion of the
world, like when you go to see a production
of "King Lear" and the lead actor has for
gotten to take off his digital wristwatch.
Stop the world, I wanted to shout, we have
an anachronism on our hands! This is the In
ternet — it's not just for everybody.
Then I took an hour and watched all of
the videos he had uploaded, which made my
lirst reaction pale in comparison. I lis videos
are actually cool. My father, a magician by
trade, uploaded twenty-odd clips of various
performances lie had done over the years. 1
watched them in reverse chronological
order, giggling at the progression from the
dear dad I know through a cycle of increas
ingly goofy fashion trends: a mustache 1 only
vaguely recall from long-ago tickling good
night kisses, a hybrid mullet that several au
dience shots reveal was pretty popular
among comedy club-goers in the late-NOs, a
crisp leopard-print blazer that's been rot
ting in our hall closet for decades and—
dear god, a clip of my father looking
younger than I am.
Among all the vapid You Tube clips out
there ol Mentos-Coke explosions and

sneezing kittens, there exists footage of my
lather, about 25years old, making money ap
pear from the inside of a lemon and joking
about Olivia Newton-John. He is young,
confident and extremely good-looking. I am
flabbergasted.
Not that I didn't know, in my heart, that
my father was once my age — he and my
mother are both tremendously charming,
charismatic people — but actually seeing it
with my own eyes through the wonder of
technology was disconcerting, to say the
least. The weirdest thing was. after the first
defamiliarizing shock. 1 wasn't freaked out
or paralyzed by that immediate and illogical
embarrassment kids sometimes feel when
our parents deviate from unswervingly self
less devotion to our solipsistic childhood
worlds. 1 watched the clip again. In all hon
esty. the guy in the video seemed like some-

one I'd want to hang out with, leop
ard-print blazer or not.
Don't get me wrong, it's no secret
to me that my parents are cool; 1 grew
up with the ambivalent pride of
knowing that they are both cooler
than 1 am ever likely to be. When
friends see me getting off the phone
with my mom. they ask how she is and
actually listen to the answer. One of
the first things 1 tell new acquaintanc
es is that my father is a professional
magician. The conversation rarely
swerves back to me afterwards. Every
time 1 go back to Las Vegas, my best
friend from high school invariably
calls me up and asks whether my par
ents are free to go to dinner — oh. but
you can come too, Kat. If you want.
It's not that they were born in
nately cooler than me, I try to con
vince myself, but that they've just had
so much more practice. My mother
was born and raised in California,
spent warm summer nights cruising
down Mulholland Drive in old con
vertibles, made incredible art at
UCLA, then bravely packed up her
things and gave England a try. My
dad was working on Greek cruise
ships at my age, performed for Cary
Grant and a host of other legends at
the Magic Castle in LA. and has so
many other awesome stories that he
took until 1 was 20 to get around to
telling me that he used to hang with
David Bowie. They both look gor
geous in their wedding photos.
This is the legacy I am supposed to
live up to.
Even 20 years of settling in the
suburbs raising two high-mainte
nance daughters could not suppress
their cool factor. When my mom
calls and asks what's going on in my
life, the answer is usually: "Reading
"War and Peace.'" When 1 return the

question, I am treated to a breathless
torrent of cross-continental drama,
tales of my father performing on a
nudist cruise ship and —just in case
I'm out of the loop — she also fills
me in on all the latest celebrity gos
sip. 1 usually am out of the loop.
1 guess this is what you'd expect of
the type of parents who challenge
you to an annual parents-versus-kids
beer pong tournament. And then
proceed to annihilate you every year.
But up until the You lube Incident
of '07.1 had only ever seen their cool
at a distance. Seeing my father as an
insolent, swaggering youth hit a little
too close to home. I realized concrete
ly for the first time that 1 will never be
as young again as 1 am at this moment,
that soon it will be my turn to raise
kids who cannot reconcile themselves
with the fact that 1 too once used
crackin' slang and checked out hot
I As. Seeing my parents' coolness full
force seriously depleted my hit points,
but in the end the source of my shock
also offered great consolation.
My mother and father pulled off the
unimaginable: they are not only great
parents but great people, and did not
let the responsibility of having kids
suck them dry of rebellion and wit
and, yes, intense coolness — they
used those things to cultivate our rela
tionship. Instead of relegating them
selves to supporting roles in their chil
dren's dramas,they kept on starring in
their own wild narratives. 1 can only
hope that when I have children, I offer
them the same brilliant example.
But first I'll probably delete all of
my video blogs on You Tube. Would
n't want them to find out about all
the terrible hairdos 1 had back when
I was their age.

are actually cool. My father, a magician by
trade, uploaded twenty-odd clips of various
performances lie had done over the years. 1
watched them in reverse chronological
order, giggling at the progression from the
dear dad I know through a cycle of increas
ingly goofy fashion trends: a mustache 1 only
vaguely recall from long-ago tickling good
night kisses, a hybrid mullet that several au
dience shots reveal was pretty popular
among comedy club-goers in the late-NOs, a
crisp leopard-print blazer that's been rot
ting in our hall closet for decades and—
dear god, a clip of my father looking
younger than I am.
Among all the vapid You Tube clips out
there ol Mentos-Coke explosions and

sneezing kittens, there exists footage of my
lather, about 25years old, making money ap
pear from the inside of a lemon and joking
about Olivia Newton-John. He is young,
confident and extremely good-looking. I am
flabbergasted.
Not that I didn't know, in my heart, that
my father was once my age — he and my
mother are both tremendously charming,
charismatic people — but actually seeing it
with my own eyes through the wonder of
technology was disconcerting, to say the
least. The weirdest thing was. after the first
defamiliarizing shock. 1 wasn't freaked out
or paralyzed by that immediate and illogical
embarrassment kids sometimes feel when
our parents deviate from unswervingly self
less devotion to our solipsistic childhood
worlds. 1 watched the clip again. In all hon
esty. the guy in the video seemed like some-

one I'd want to hang out with, leop
ard-print blazer or not.
Don't get me wrong, it's no secret
to me that my parents are cool; 1 grew
up with the ambivalent pride of
knowing that they are both cooler
than 1 am ever likely to be. When
friends see me getting off the phone
with my mom. they ask how she is and
actually listen to the answer. One of
the first things 1 tell new acquaintanc
es is that my father is a professional
magician. The conversation rarely
swerves back to me afterwards. Every
time 1 go back to Las Vegas, my best
friend from high school invariably
calls me up and asks whether my par
ents are free to go to dinner — oh. but
you can come too, Kat. If you want.
It's not that they were born in
nately cooler than me, I try to con
vince myself, but that they've just had
so much more practice. My mother
was born and raised in California,
spent warm summer nights cruising
down Mulholland Drive in old con
vertibles, made incredible art at
UCLA, then bravely packed up her
things and gave England a try. My
dad was working on Greek cruise
ships at my age, performed for Cary
Grant and a host of other legends at
the Magic Castle in LA. and has so
many other awesome stories that he
took until 1 was 20 to get around to
telling me that he used to hang with
David Bowie. They both look gor
geous in their wedding photos.
This is the legacy I am supposed to
live up to.
Even 20 years of settling in the
suburbs raising two high-mainte
nance daughters could not suppress
their cool factor. When my mom
calls and asks what's going on in my
life, the answer is usually: "Reading
"War and Peace.'" When 1 return the

question, I am treated to a breathless
torrent of cross-continental drama,
tales of my father performing on a
nudist cruise ship and —just in case
I'm out of the loop — she also fills
me in on all the latest celebrity gos
sip. 1 usually am out of the loop.
1 guess this is what you'd expect of
the type of parents who challenge
you to an annual parents-versus-kids
beer pong tournament. And then
proceed to annihilate you every year.
But up until the You lube Incident
of '07.1 had only ever seen their cool
at a distance. Seeing my father as an
insolent, swaggering youth hit a little
too close to home. I realized concrete
ly for the first time that 1 will never be
as young again as 1 am at this moment,
that soon it will be my turn to raise
kids who cannot reconcile themselves
with the fact that 1 too once used
crackin' slang and checked out hot
I As. Seeing my parents' coolness full
force seriously depleted my hit points,
but in the end the source of my shock
also offered great consolation.
My mother and father pulled off the
unimaginable: they are not only great
parents but great people, and did not
let the responsibility of having kids
suck them dry of rebellion and wit
and, yes, intense coolness — they
used those things to cultivate our rela
tionship. Instead of relegating them
selves to supporting roles in their chil
dren's dramas,they kept on starring in
their own wild narratives. 1 can only
hope that when I have children, I offer
them the same brilliant example.
But first I'll probably delete all of
my video blogs on You Tube. Would
n't want them to find out about all
the terrible hairdos 1 had back when
I was their age.

Kat sends out best Valentine's Day
wishes to lier embarrassed future kids,
all of you and especially her father,
whose birthday it is today and whose
You Tube username is "nicklewinl."
Check him out ami tell Kat how cool
he is at klewin@stanford.edu.
