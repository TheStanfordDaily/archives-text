# My father, the You Tube phenomenon
## 
### 
A few days ago. 1 had the terrible
shock of a lifetime: my father sub
scribed to my videos on You Tube.
My father is on You lube. My initial reac
tion was one of confusion, unwelcome real
ization of the profound perversion of the
world, like when you go to see a production
of "King Lear" and the lead actor has for
gotten to take off his digital wristwatch.
Stop the world, I wanted to shout, we have
an anachronism on our hands! This is the In
ternet — it's not just for everybody.
Then I took an hour and watched all of
the videos he had uploaded, which made my
lirst reaction pale in comparison. I lis videos
are actually cool. My father, a magician by
trade, uploaded twenty-odd clips of various
performances lie had done over the years. 1
watched them in reverse chronological
order, giggling at the progression from the
dear dad I know through a cycle of increas
ingly goofy fashion trends: a mustache 1 only
vaguely recall from long-ago tickling good
night kisses, a hybrid mullet that several au
dience shots reveal was pretty popular
among comedy club-goers in the late-NOs, a
crisp leopard-print blazer that's been rot
ting in our hall closet for decades and—
dear god, a clip of my father looking
younger than I am.
Among all the vapid You Tube clips out
there ol Mentos-Coke explosions and

sneezing kittens, there exists footage of my
lather, about 25years old, making money ap
pear from the inside of a lemon and joking
about Olivia Newton-John. He is young,
confident and extremely good-looking. I am
flabbergasted.
Not that I didn't know, in my heart, that
my father was once my age — he and my
mother are both tremendously charming,
charismatic people — but actually seeing it
with my own eyes through the wonder of
technology was disconcerting, to say the
least. The weirdest thing was. after the first
defamiliarizing shock. 1 wasn't freaked out
or paralyzed by that immediate and illogical
embarrassment kids sometimes feel when
our parents deviate from unswervingly self
less devotion to our solipsistic childhood
worlds. 1 watched the clip again. In all hon
esty. the guy in the video seemed like some-
