With all this talk about depression,
mental health and stress, I better
get my two cents in before the next
round of Rhodes scholars are announced
and everybody goes back to talking about
the impeccable Stanford student body. I'm
not an expert on any of the above topics, but
that doesn t mean I haven't exercised my
frowning muscles from time to time. Yes.
even me the jackass who posed with not
one. but two. thumbs up tor his columnist
picture — can get down and out. livery
body gets the blues, a fact that is often for
gotten among the palm trees and dry lakes
of this academic paradise.
In tact, this paradise may exacerbate feel
ings of dejection. Think about it: Get togeth
er a plethora of overachieving, ambitious
scholars who have never seen a small enve
lope or the letter "C." 1 lave them apply to the
same programs, be dots on the same grading
curve or compete for the same grants, and
there are bound to be disappointments. Add
the chagrins of college life to those of real life
and suddenly the glass can look half-empty.
So who is responsible for looking out for
lis ' I wouldn't bet on the residential staff.
ITiey try hard. yes. Hut your RA might be
the one who needs a hug. The persistent
I niversity-sponsored support networks
might not be the answer cither — the idea
ot talking to a complete stranger about
emotional ailments is not for everyone. Not
to mention that when I'm sad. I like curling
up in the fetal position under a fort of pil
lows. not searching for a phone number.
This leaves one remaining antidote for
the doom of despondency: ourselves.
Wait, don't turn the page! I'm not com
pletely naive. I realize that mental health is
a brew of biological, psychological, socio

logical and other "-ological" factors that
cannot possibly be cured by a hug from your
neighbor. Everyone knows that getting
enough sleep, exercising and eating right
may help alleviate feelings of malaise. Doc
tors prescribe their own remedies: profes
sional counseling and, of course, drugs. This
is a perfect time to give a big "fuck you" to
lorn ( ruise and the other self-proclaimed
"experts" who believe psychiatry is not real.
Psychiatric remedies often work, and they
will always be a better bet than get-well tips
from a wack-job scientologist or a strug
gling unpaid columnist. Since I can't pre
scribe drugs and I already see you at the
gym every week, I'll offer further advice
concerning the power of self.
I know I'm not the first to say this: Get off
campus. Skip class and go to the beach, go
abroad for a quarter or two. volunteer at a
soup kitchen in East Palo Alto or go clubbing
in San Jose (if you're into that sort of thing).
Do anything that gives you perspective and
reminds you that there is a world outside ac
ademia. Also, do not add fuel to the fire. If
you're already feeling down, do not put on
your favorite Elliott Smith CD while reading
Robert Cormier's "I am the Cheese" or
watching "Requiem for a Dream."
