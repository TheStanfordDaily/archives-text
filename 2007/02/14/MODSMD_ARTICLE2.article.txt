# Initiatives aim to boost grad diversity
## Grad diversity day and fellowship programs planned 
### JENNIFER LIU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a continuing effort to bolster graduate
student diversity, the University announced
several initiatives last week designed to re
cruit and retain underrepresented minority
students in its graduate programs.

Two programs launched last year have
been extended: a grant program allowing
faculty to apply for up to $S(X) to cover the
cost of campus visits for prospective stu
dents and the summer Graduate Student In
stitute, which emphasizes an interdiscipli
nary approach to student interaction.
New initiatives offered this year include a
Graduate Student Diversity Day on Feb. 23
and a fellowship program for Mexican doc
toral students.
In a Nov. 2(X)6 Faculty Senate presenta
tion on graduate diversity, Gail Mahood, as

sociate vice provost for graduate education
and a professor of geological and environ
mental sciences, noted that there are more
retirement-age minority faculty members
than there are minority graduate students.
One solution the report proposed was to
intensify recruitment efforts. Associate
Dean of Students Thorn Massey '69, who
concentrates on cultural and diversity edu
cation. said that Stanford's location made
prospective student visits particularly im
portant.
"We have to have more than just faculty

involved in increasing diversity," Massey
said. "Our students are especially valuable
because Stanford is so geographically far
away from so many places. Both undergrad
uate and graduate students here have made
the decision to come to Stanford regardless
they can help convince and reassure
prospective students that the environment
here is a welcoming one."
Last year, faculty from the department of
aeronautics and astronautics used money
ion! the grant program to cover the
expenses of three prospective
women from the East Coast, said
Lynn Kaiser, director of student serv
ices for the department.
"In our department, females are a
minority," Kaiser said. "I think the
visit helped the visiting students
make an informed decision about
their graduate education. In fact, one
of them accepted right away."
The conclusion of Mahood's No
vember report, however, emphasized
the importance of what is called the
"pipeline" issue, or the retention of
Stanford's own minority undergrad
uates in addition to recruitment of
students from other schools.
Mahood said that the Office of the
Vice Provost for Graduate Educa
tion, a new position that opened in

January, is currently working on pro
viding support to the Arthur
Walker Program for the Ad
vancement of Science and Engi
neering, which will begin this spring.
The long-term goal of the program,
Mahood wrote in an email to The
Daily, is to address the pipeline issue
for minority students by ensuring re
tention at the "leaky" points in the
pipeline.
At a Jan. 25 Faculty-Senate
meeting, however. Biology I'rof.
Russell Fcrnald called on fellow
faculty and administrators to ex
plore other means to encourage un
dergraduates to consider graduate
careers. I le requested data collec
tion for the number of Stanford un
dergraduates going on to graduate
school.
"Faculty have to realize that we
are part of the pipeline." Fernald
said. "At the Senate meeting, I also
noted that the cost of being a gradu
ate student has gone up remarkably.
Ibis might also contribute to the lack

of minority students in graduate
schools â€” especially if we don't
make clear what an academic career
entails."
Stanford's success in promoting
undergraduate diversity has long
been held as a model for graduate di
versity, according to Massey.
"Institutionally, we have to start
somewhere, perhaps at the level with
most potential." he said. "But now,
we've got to look at what we've done
with the undergraduate population
and couple it with our efforts to pro
mote graduate diversity. And recruit
ment is only the first step. We need to
put as much effort into retention as
we do in recruitment.
"It's more difficult for graduate
students because their tenures are
longer, which means that they'll be
looking closely at the Stanford envi
ronment," he added. "We have to
give them all the information they
need to be able to take advantage of
our campus."
Mahood said one way of evaluat

ing the success of diversity initiatives
is to look at the acceptance rate of
minority applicants in addition to the
opinion surveys that are already in
use. In the longer term, administra
tors plan to look at statistics on reten
tion and degree completion.
Massey noted, however, that the
initiatives would not work by them
selves.
"If faculty don't take advantage of
(the programs], then they're not help
iul," he said."lf our goals aren't being
reached, we've got to take a look at
the things we've decided so far to go
forward with."
According to Mahood. faculty in
volvement has not been an issue
thus far. She said she has already ap
proved faculty requests to bring
more than 30 applicants to campus
in addition to the more than 1 (K) ap
plicants who will attend graduate re
cruiting and diversitv events.
