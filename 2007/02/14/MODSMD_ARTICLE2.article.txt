# Initiatives aim to boost grad diversity
## Grad diversity day and fellowship programs planned

In a continuing effort to bolster graduate
student diversity, the University announced
several initiatives last week designed to re
cruit and retain underrepresented minority
students in its graduate programs.

Two programs launched last year have
been extended: a grant program allowing
faculty to apply for up to $S(X) to cover the
cost of campus visits for prospective stu
dents and the summer Graduate Student In
stitute, which emphasizes an interdiscipli
nary approach to student interaction.
New initiatives offered this year include a
Graduate Student Diversity Day on Feb. 23
and a fellowship program for Mexican doc
toral students.
In a Nov. 2(X)6 Faculty Senate presenta
tion on graduate diversity, Gail Mahood, as

sociate vice provost for graduate education
and a professor of geological and environ
mental sciences, noted that there are more
retirement-age minority faculty members
than there are minority graduate students.
One solution the report proposed was to
intensify recruitment efforts. Associate
Dean of Students Thorn Massey '69, who
concentrates on cultural and diversity edu
cation. said that Stanford's location made
prospective student visits particularly im
portant.
"We have to have more than just faculty

involved in increasing diversity," Massey
said. "Our students are especially valuable
because Stanford is so geographically far
away from so many places. Both undergrad
uate and graduate students here have made
the decision to come to Stanford regardless
they can help convince and reassure
prospective students that the environment
here is a welcoming one."
Last year, faculty from the department of
aeronautics and astronautics used money
