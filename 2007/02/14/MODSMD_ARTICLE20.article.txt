I like Fruit Loops. Really, I do. Having not
yet advanced beyond my childhood cere
al preferences, I look forward to "follow
ing my nose" during dinner to the cereal con
tainer to the far left, the one I always go to,
the one I own. And. I must admit, I take the
ritual of obtaining my Fruit Loops VERY se
riously.
As it usually happens, even before I get a
tray. I go to the cereal section, the abode of
my lover, and turn the plastic wheel exactly
six strokes in a clockwise direction.
At this point, I become so focused as to ig
nore the world around me as the bowl and 1
dance in the elegant ballroom of Stern dining
hall, gliding across the floor in time to
ABBA, mariachi, or Paula Abdul's 1988 hit
single "Straight Up."
"Straight up now tell me, Tucan Sam: is it
going to be you and me forever?!? Or, (most
dreadful!), am 1 caught in a hit and run?" I
sing to my circles, as they are bathed from
above with heaven's milk.
But my nightly Fruit Loops quest was
abruptly sullied several days ago. by what can
only be identified as the conniving plot of the
Devil himself.
Somewhere around turn number three of
my darling's wheel, I caught in my peripheral
vision an intruder. With a face full of smiling
teeth and a too-eager glimmer of the eyes, he
casually popped his head into my view, a ges
ture made to seem unintentional.
I continued turning, the Fruit Loops
falling like golden doubloons into my eager
bowl, but couldn't help but notice an attempt
at communication on the part of the intruder.
He must not understand, 1 said to myself.
Surely, his sacrilege must be excusable, given
that only I could hear the soft serenade I was
singing at the time to my circles.

But now. it became obvious. My tryst only
half over, 1 had to move to the milk machine.
And it was there, at the very cusp of my love
affair's fruition, that I was intercepted.
"Those are good.aren't they?" he asked,a
feeble attempt at small talk. I noted inwardly
that really, he couldn't even begin to under
stand the depth of their goodness, as 1 nod
ded in agreement, unwilling to betray the in
tensity of my love in such an open fashion to
someone so likely to ridicule me.
Ile held out his hand to shake, and 1 awk
wardly shifted the tray to the other hand. I le
informed me that he was called "Anakin,"
like the guy from Star Wars. As I replied,"l'm
Nat. like the King Cole," 1 certainly had other
things on my mind.
And then I looked down. KAMU'L
Something is dreadfully awry here. I realized.
None but the most suspect ol human beings
eat Kamut whole wheat breakfast cereal. Its
promotional Web site identifies it as a •"for
gotten "grain from ancient Lgypt, citing the
story that it is descended from a handful of
grain found in a tomb near Dashare, Egypt in
the 19405. It is often found on the same shelf
as such appetizing delectables as "Muselix"
and "Textured Vegetable Product." I almost
anticipated what was coming next.
"Now,you look like a pretty smart guy. am

I right? he gushed. 1 glanced longingly at the
milk machine, taking a vacation from reality.
"Would you be interested in joining a
cabal ot bright, entrepreneurial upstarts? I
work with a company that seeks to identify
and intercept talent, to foster relationships
between the corporate world and our illustri
ous student body."
1 had no idea what the hell he was talking
about, but nodded anyway. Sure, I'm smart,
whatever...just get out of my hair, you dread
ed cock block.
I le proceeded to drill me about my major
and my interest in corporate financing. 1 was
lorced to lose interest in the Fruit Loops.

"Straight up now tell me, Tucan Sam: is it
going to be you and me forever?!? Or, (most
dreadful!), am 1 caught in a hit and run?" I
sing to my circles, as they are bathed from
above with heaven's milk.
But my nightly Fruit Loops quest was
abruptly sullied several days ago. by what can
only be identified as the conniving plot of the
Devil himself.
Somewhere around turn number three of
my darling's wheel, I caught in my peripheral
vision an intruder. With a face full of smiling
teeth and a too-eager glimmer of the eyes, he
casually popped his head into my view, a ges
ture made to seem unintentional.
I continued turning, the Fruit Loops
falling like golden doubloons into my eager
bowl, but couldn't help but notice an attempt
at communication on the part of the intruder.
He must not understand, 1 said to myself.
Surely, his sacrilege must be excusable, given
that only I could hear the soft serenade I was
singing at the time to my circles.

But now. it became obvious. My tryst only
half over, 1 had to move to the milk machine.
And it was there, at the very cusp of my love
affair's fruition, that I was intercepted.
"Those are good.aren't they?" he asked,a
feeble attempt at small talk. I noted inwardly
that really, he couldn't even begin to under
stand the depth of their goodness, as 1 nod
ded in agreement, unwilling to betray the in
tensity of my love in such an open fashion to
someone so likely to ridicule me.
Ile held out his hand to shake, and 1 awk
wardly shifted the tray to the other hand. I le
informed me that he was called "Anakin,"
like the guy from Star Wars. As I replied,"l'm
Nat. like the King Cole," 1 certainly had other
things on my mind.
And then I looked down. KAMU'L
Something is dreadfully awry here. I realized.
None but the most suspect ol human beings
eat Kamut whole wheat breakfast cereal. Its
promotional Web site identifies it as a •"for
gotten "grain from ancient Lgypt, citing the
story that it is descended from a handful of
grain found in a tomb near Dashare, Egypt in
the 19405. It is often found on the same shelf
as such appetizing delectables as "Muselix"
and "Textured Vegetable Product." I almost
anticipated what was coming next.
"Now,you look like a pretty smart guy. am

I right? he gushed. 1 glanced longingly at the
milk machine, taking a vacation from reality.
"Would you be interested in joining a
cabal ot bright, entrepreneurial upstarts? I
work with a company that seeks to identify
and intercept talent, to foster relationships
between the corporate world and our illustri
ous student body."
1 had no idea what the hell he was talking
about, but nodded anyway. Sure, I'm smart,
whatever...just get out of my hair, you dread
ed cock block.
I le proceeded to drill me about my major
and my interest in corporate financing. 1 was
lorced to lose interest in the Fruit Loops.
He took out a pad of paper, and wrote
down a series ot incomprehensible figures:
mutual equity loans.annual interest rates.ex
pected annual income. Who was this guy?
I low had lie been turned so quickly into a
coiporate whore? Why was lie hanging out
b\ the cereal bar in Stern Dining? l ie can't
have been much more than several years
older than me, and yet here he was talking
about the benefits of Roth IRA investments,
mounting his soapbox several meters away
Irom the hot dog guy with the Jamaican ac
cent. pontilicating to a soundtrack of Madon
na's "Material Girl."
< Hir conversation turned quickly into the
typewiitten monologue that one often hears
■edited at the beginning of telemarketing
calls. ( ailing financial ignorance "our na
tion s tragedy, lie encouraged, no. urged me
to start saving now. After all. at the near 12
percent interest rate which is common in this
Jvpe ol investment. I could be a millionaire
by the age of 26.

Nat-ural Philosophy
my watch. I know. My too-copious
French fries and my bowl of concilia
tory carrots had started to assume
roughly the same temperature, and
my tray wobbled haphazardly. When

all was said and done, and 1 had as
sured this sketchy recruiter that not
only was 1 ignorant of financial mat
ters and proud of it. but I literally had
3 dollars in my bank account, left
over from my last lemonade sale, he
left, and 1 approached the milk ma
chine.
1 felt deflated and flaccid. No, 1
couldn't do it. 1 had to throw out the
Fruit Loops. You. Mr. Sketchy Re

cruiter for a Nondescript Organiza
tion of Unclear Purpose, had ruined
my life's only pleasure. Let this be an
open letter to you and all of your ilk:
Stop the corporate prostitution, and
let us all enjoy our vices in peace.

it was just a fling. You can ask him
