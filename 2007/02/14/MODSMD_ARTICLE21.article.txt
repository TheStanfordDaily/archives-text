In support of SLAC Guest House
Manager
I wanted to take this opportunity to re
spond to the article dated Monday. February
12, 2(X)7 titled "Guest House workers wiilk
out."
To be clear. Jonathan Faulkner, current
general manager of the Stanford Guest
House, was the former general manager of
the l)C LA liverton House. Prior to working
at the Liverton House. Mr. Faulkner was the
general manager of the UCLA Guest House.
Hie purpose of this letter is to provide The
Stanford Daily readers with a more rational
and accurate portrait of Jonathan Faulkner.
My intent is to give the Stanford community

a greater understanding of who this man is
from the viewpoint of his former manage
ment team at the UCLA Tiverton House.
Jonathan Faulkner is one of the most ear
ing. supportive and inspirational bosses I
have ever had the opportunity to work with.
I worked as the assistant general manager at
theTiverton I louse. Kvery morning Jonathan
would check in with our food service manag
er, Janina Krupa. on how her morning was
going and if our guests were happy. I le would
then pop his head into our offices and say
good morning. He would also do his daily
rounds' and stop by the front desk to check in
with the staff. I le did this to not only check on
the physical appearance of the hotel but also
because he deeply cared about how everyone

was doing.
When Jonathan learned that niv brother
was about to he deployed with his Army unit
o iaq. without hesitation he told me.
ansa. you have to he with your family,
lion t worry about the hotel: I'll stay in town
so t lat you can leave." It was my responsibil
ity to cover the hotel for the holiday and he
graciously ottered to cover me.
( aring tor his employees has always been
the number one priority for Jonathan. When
one o! our housekeeping staff went on med
ical leave he sent her cards throughout her
recoNcry. Vhen she returned to work and
could no longer handle the physical demands
