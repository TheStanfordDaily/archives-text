In support of SLAC Guest House
Manager
I wanted to take this opportunity to re
spond to the article dated Monday. February
12, 2(X)7 titled "Guest House workers wiilk
out."
To be clear. Jonathan Faulkner, current
general manager of the Stanford Guest
House, was the former general manager of
the l)C LA liverton House. Prior to working
at the Liverton House. Mr. Faulkner was the
general manager of the UCLA Guest House.
Hie purpose of this letter is to provide The
Stanford Daily readers with a more rational
and accurate portrait of Jonathan Faulkner.
My intent is to give the Stanford community

a greater understanding of who this man is
from the viewpoint of his former manage
ment team at the UCLA Tiverton House.
Jonathan Faulkner is one of the most ear
ing. supportive and inspirational bosses I
have ever had the opportunity to work with.
I worked as the assistant general manager at
theTiverton I louse. Kvery morning Jonathan
would check in with our food service manag
er, Janina Krupa. on how her morning was
going and if our guests were happy. I le would
then pop his head into our offices and say
good morning. He would also do his daily
rounds' and stop by the front desk to check in
with the staff. I le did this to not only check on
the physical appearance of the hotel but also
because he deeply cared about how everyone

was doing.
When Jonathan learned that niv brother
was about to he deployed with his Army unit
o iaq. without hesitation he told me.
ansa. you have to he with your family,
lion t worry about the hotel: I'll stay in town
so t lat you can leave." It was my responsibil
ity to cover the hotel for the holiday and he
graciously ottered to cover me.
( aring tor his employees has always been
the number one priority for Jonathan. When
one o! our housekeeping staff went on med
ical leave he sent her cards throughout her
recoNcry. Vhen she returned to work and
could no longer handle the physical demands
of working in a hotel. Jonathan
worked tirelessly with UCLA
Human Resources to see about
transferring her to another depart
ment as per her request.
Promoting employees who show
outstanding achievement is also one
of Jonathan's positive traits.
Stephanie Robinson. Tiverton
House housekeeping director, ex
plained. "Jonathan promoted me to
housekeeping director after seeing
my dedication, hard work and lead
ership skills. 1 am forever grateful
that he gave me a chance." Mr.
Faulkner also recognized something
special in Janina krupa. former front
desk clerk and current food services
manager for UCLA Tiverton I louse.
Janina stated. "Jonathan promoted
me from a front desk clerk to a man
ager. I am so appreciative that he ad
vanced my career."
Jonathan Faulkner is a very smart
and dedicated professional. He was
asked to reorganize the UCLA
Tiverton I louse and did so with great
success. At first. I was unsure at how
his reorganization techniques would
work at our hotel. Over time, howev
er. 1 was delighted at his improve
ment ideas. These ideas included re
structuring the staff, changing job de
scriptions. revamping the property
management system and more.
In my opinion, those five staff
members that walked off the job at
the Stanford Guest House did not
give Mr. Faulkner a chance. My heart
goes out to them that they did not
choose a different path such as nego
tiation proceedings, union counsel
ing and other proven job satisfaction
techniques where their voices could
be heard. Jonathan is a very reason
able man and only wants his employ
ees and guests to be happy.

sustainability plan
1 am writing in response to Ruth
McCann's article regarding Stan
ford's sustainability efforts ("Green
Envy." February 6,2007) in which she
suggests that Stanford has "no for

mul plan for increasing its sustain
ability." Iliat is not true. Sustainabil
ity is of crucial importance to the
staff in Land. Buildings and Real Ins
tate as well as to our colleagues in
Residential & Dining Enterprises,
Environmental Health & Safety and
DAPER. Over the past several
years, our commitment to imple
menting sound, sustainable practices
in the design, construction and oper
ation of our campus facilities has re
sulted in many positive impacts on
our environment and has gained no
tice from our peer institutions. The
following list highlights some impor
tant examples of our continuing
commitment to a sustainable Stan
ford:
• A rigorous annual capital planning
process that "right sizes" new build
ing requests through utilization stud
ies and audits of existing space
• Formation and implementation of
the Project Delivery Process at Stan
ford in 2001. which requires Project
Managers to consider sustainable
opportunities early in the design
process for new and renovated build
ings
• Input from students, faculty and
leading sustainability professionals
in the development and implementa
tion of the Guidelines for Sustain
able Buildings in 2002. which has
subsequently been used on all new
building projects
• Formation and implementation of
the Guidelines for Life Cycle Cost
Analysis in 2005 for new building
construction to ensure that sustain
able features in our buildings make
economic sense
• Every new construction project has
a LEED-accredited Stanford project
management professional trained in
sustainable design practices
• A central energy facility that uses
highly efficient cogeneration to pro
duce electricity and steam
• A highly-efficient ice storage facili
ty (the largest of any university in the
country and third largest overall!)
that produces chilled water for cool
ing throughout campus
• The roll-out this year of a multi
phased "Sustainability in Existing
Buildings Program" that includes
retrofits and energy efficiency im
provements to our biggest energy
users
• An existing building retrofit pro
gram. in place since 1992. that pro
vides $750,000 per year for projects
to improve energy efficiency

• Extensive Transportation Demand
Management programs that have re
sulted in a reduction of single-car
commuters to campus from 77% to
55% since 2001
• Eco-Pass and GO Pass programs
on public transit that offer free trans
portation to campus for all university
staff
• Green cleaning supplies and prac
tices are used throughout campus
• A leading recycling program that
currently diverts 58% of our waste
from landfills with a goal of 75%
goal by 2010
• An Energy Conservation Incentive
Plan that provides financial rewards
to departments for conserving ener
gy in their buildings
• All light fixtures have been re
placed with highly efficient T8 lamps
(a new program starts this year to re
place these fixtures with even more
efficient ballasts)
• A Water Conservation and Recy
cling Master Plan, which has reduced
water consumption from 2.7 M gal
lons/day to 2.2 M gallons/day since
2001
• Stanford is among the first group of
universities to register with the Cali
fornia Climate Action Registry
which requires the inventory and re
porting of green house gas emissions
• Stanford is certified as a "Green
Business" by Santa Clara County
A few of Stanford's significant
awards and recognitions include:
• Highest grade (A-) among all uni
versities for sustainable practices by
the Sustainable Endowments Initia
tive
• United States Top Ten Green Pro
ject Award for the Leslie Shao-ming
Sun Field Station at Jasper Ridge by
the American Institute of Architects
• Design Award, Toyon Hall Reha
bilitation, California Preservation
Society
• Recognition by the US EPA as one
of the "Best Workplaces for Com
muters"
• Acterra's Business Environmental
Award, Commute and Transporta
tion category
• Recipient of the Clean Air Award
from the Bay Area American Lung
Association
• Recognition as a Bicycle-Friendly
Community by the League of Amer
ican Bicyclists
• National Recycling Coalition's
Outstanding School Program Award
• Clean Bay Business Award from

the Palo Alto Regional Water Quali
ty Control Plant
• Environmental Achievement
Awards from the US EPA for the
Mercury Thermometer Replace
ment Program and the Household
Battery Recycling Program
In 20()(i. the provost endorsed the
formation of the Sustainability
Working Group (SWG). which com
prises faculty, staff and students.
Their charge is to understand and
identify issues and to establish in
formed goals for reducing our impact
on the environment through conser
vation, sustainable practices and off
sets. Throughout 2007. the SWG will
be focused on developing a compre
hensive plan that establishes respon
sible goals for reducing our carbon
footprint and greenhouse gas emis
sions. Achieving a more sustainable
Stanford requires effort from each
member of the campus community
and must involve a more than a dis
cussion about green buildings. Our
challenge is to strike a balance be
tween green practices (environ
ment), fiscal discipline and fiduciary
responsibility (economy) and fur
thering our academic mission (equi
ty).
Every fall for the past three years,
1 have met with environmentally fo
cused student groups and individu
als. 1 am pleased that, every year
after our meeting, they leave excited
about all the work that is being done.
We have a great story to tell regard
ing our sustainability efforts on cam
pus and 1 know you will be hearing
more about it throughout the year. I
hope the message conveyed will be
strong and unequivocal in the minds
of our community: that Stanford is
committed to being a leader in sus
tainability. not a follower.

desk clerk and current food services
manager for UCLA Tiverton I louse.
Janina stated. "Jonathan promoted
me from a front desk clerk to a man
ager. I am so appreciative that he ad
vanced my career."
Jonathan Faulkner is a very smart
and dedicated professional. He was
asked to reorganize the UCLA
Tiverton I louse and did so with great
success. At first. I was unsure at how
his reorganization techniques would
work at our hotel. Over time, howev
er. 1 was delighted at his improve
ment ideas. These ideas included re
structuring the staff, changing job de
scriptions. revamping the property
management system and more.
In my opinion, those five staff
members that walked off the job at
the Stanford Guest House did not
give Mr. Faulkner a chance. My heart
goes out to them that they did not
choose a different path such as nego
tiation proceedings, union counsel
ing and other proven job satisfaction
techniques where their voices could
be heard. Jonathan is a very reason
able man and only wants his employ
ees and guests to be happy.

sustainability plan
1 am writing in response to Ruth
McCann's article regarding Stan
ford's sustainability efforts ("Green
Envy." February 6,2007) in which she
suggests that Stanford has "no for

mul plan for increasing its sustain
ability." Iliat is not true. Sustainabil
ity is of crucial importance to the
staff in Land. Buildings and Real Ins
tate as well as to our colleagues in
Residential & Dining Enterprises,
Environmental Health & Safety and
DAPER. Over the past several
years, our commitment to imple
menting sound, sustainable practices
in the design, construction and oper
ation of our campus facilities has re
sulted in many positive impacts on
our environment and has gained no
tice from our peer institutions. The
following list highlights some impor
tant examples of our continuing
commitment to a sustainable Stan
ford:
• A rigorous annual capital planning
process that "right sizes" new build
ing requests through utilization stud
ies and audits of existing space
• Formation and implementation of
the Project Delivery Process at Stan
ford in 2001. which requires Project
Managers to consider sustainable
opportunities early in the design
process for new and renovated build
ings
• Input from students, faculty and
leading sustainability professionals
in the development and implementa
tion of the Guidelines for Sustain
able Buildings in 2002. which has
subsequently been used on all new
building projects
• Formation and implementation of
the Guidelines for Life Cycle Cost
Analysis in 2005 for new building
construction to ensure that sustain
able features in our buildings make
economic sense
• Every new construction project has
a LEED-accredited Stanford project
management professional trained in
sustainable design practices
• A central energy facility that uses
highly efficient cogeneration to pro
duce electricity and steam
• A highly-efficient ice storage facili
ty (the largest of any university in the
country and third largest overall!)
that produces chilled water for cool
ing throughout campus
• The roll-out this year of a multi
phased "Sustainability in Existing
Buildings Program" that includes
retrofits and energy efficiency im
provements to our biggest energy
users
• An existing building retrofit pro
gram. in place since 1992. that pro
vides $750,000 per year for projects
to improve energy efficiency

• Extensive Transportation Demand
Management programs that have re
sulted in a reduction of single-car
commuters to campus from 77% to
55% since 2001
• Eco-Pass and GO Pass programs
on public transit that offer free trans
portation to campus for all university
staff
• Green cleaning supplies and prac
tices are used throughout campus
• A leading recycling program that
currently diverts 58% of our waste
from landfills with a goal of 75%
goal by 2010
• An Energy Conservation Incentive
Plan that provides financial rewards
to departments for conserving ener
gy in their buildings
• All light fixtures have been re
placed with highly efficient T8 lamps
(a new program starts this year to re
place these fixtures with even more
efficient ballasts)
• A Water Conservation and Recy
cling Master Plan, which has reduced
water consumption from 2.7 M gal
lons/day to 2.2 M gallons/day since
2001
• Stanford is among the first group of
universities to register with the Cali
fornia Climate Action Registry
which requires the inventory and re
porting of green house gas emissions
• Stanford is certified as a "Green
Business" by Santa Clara County
A few of Stanford's significant
awards and recognitions include:
• Highest grade (A-) among all uni
versities for sustainable practices by
the Sustainable Endowments Initia
tive
• United States Top Ten Green Pro
ject Award for the Leslie Shao-ming
Sun Field Station at Jasper Ridge by
the American Institute of Architects
• Design Award, Toyon Hall Reha
bilitation, California Preservation
Society
• Recognition by the US EPA as one
of the "Best Workplaces for Com
muters"
• Acterra's Business Environmental
Award, Commute and Transporta
tion category
• Recipient of the Clean Air Award
from the Bay Area American Lung
Association
• Recognition as a Bicycle-Friendly
Community by the League of Amer
ican Bicyclists
• National Recycling Coalition's
Outstanding School Program Award
• Clean Bay Business Award from

the Palo Alto Regional Water Quali
ty Control Plant
• Environmental Achievement
Awards from the US EPA for the
Mercury Thermometer Replace
ment Program and the Household
Battery Recycling Program
In 20()(i. the provost endorsed the
formation of the Sustainability
Working Group (SWG). which com
prises faculty, staff and students.
Their charge is to understand and
identify issues and to establish in
formed goals for reducing our impact
on the environment through conser
vation, sustainable practices and off
sets. Throughout 2007. the SWG will
be focused on developing a compre
hensive plan that establishes respon
sible goals for reducing our carbon
footprint and greenhouse gas emis
sions. Achieving a more sustainable
Stanford requires effort from each
member of the campus community
and must involve a more than a dis
cussion about green buildings. Our
challenge is to strike a balance be
tween green practices (environ
ment), fiscal discipline and fiduciary
responsibility (economy) and fur
thering our academic mission (equi
ty).
Every fall for the past three years,
1 have met with environmentally fo
cused student groups and individu
als. 1 am pleased that, every year
after our meeting, they leave excited
about all the work that is being done.
We have a great story to tell regard
ing our sustainability efforts on cam
pus and 1 know you will be hearing
more about it throughout the year. I
hope the message conveyed will be
strong and unequivocal in the minds
of our community: that Stanford is
committed to being a leader in sus
tainability. not a follower.

In support of SLAC Guest House
Manager
I wanted to take this opportunity to re
spond to the article dated Monday. February
12, 2(X)7 titled "Guest House workers wiilk
out."
To be clear. Jonathan Faulkner, current
general manager of the Stanford Guest
House, was the former general manager of
the l)C LA liverton House. Prior to working
at the Liverton House. Mr. Faulkner was the
general manager of the UCLA Guest House.
Hie purpose of this letter is to provide The
Stanford Daily readers with a more rational
and accurate portrait of Jonathan Faulkner.
My intent is to give the Stanford community

a greater understanding of who this man is
from the viewpoint of his former manage
ment team at the UCLA Tiverton House.
Jonathan Faulkner is one of the most ear
ing. supportive and inspirational bosses I
have ever had the opportunity to work with.
I worked as the assistant general manager at
theTiverton I louse. Kvery morning Jonathan
would check in with our food service manag
er, Janina Krupa. on how her morning was
going and if our guests were happy. I le would
then pop his head into our offices and say
good morning. He would also do his daily
rounds' and stop by the front desk to check in
with the staff. I le did this to not only check on
the physical appearance of the hotel but also
because he deeply cared about how everyone

was doing.
When Jonathan learned that niv brother
was about to he deployed with his Army unit
o iaq. without hesitation he told me.
ansa. you have to he with your family,
lion t worry about the hotel: I'll stay in town
so t lat you can leave." It was my responsibil
ity to cover the hotel for the holiday and he
graciously ottered to cover me.
( aring tor his employees has always been
the number one priority for Jonathan. When
one o! our housekeeping staff went on med
ical leave he sent her cards throughout her
recoNcry. Vhen she returned to work and
could no longer handle the physical demands
of working in a hotel. Jonathan
worked tirelessly with UCLA
Human Resources to see about
transferring her to another depart
ment as per her request.
Promoting employees who show
outstanding achievement is also one
of Jonathan's positive traits.
Stephanie Robinson. Tiverton
House housekeeping director, ex
plained. "Jonathan promoted me to
housekeeping director after seeing
my dedication, hard work and lead
ership skills. 1 am forever grateful
that he gave me a chance." Mr.
Faulkner also recognized something
special in Janina krupa. former front
desk clerk and current food services
manager for UCLA Tiverton I louse.
Janina stated. "Jonathan promoted
me from a front desk clerk to a man
ager. I am so appreciative that he ad
