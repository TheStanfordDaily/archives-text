## Sunken Diamond Sayonara Stanford beats Japanese Rikkio University 5-1 in exhibition 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
For a game that won't affect its season's record
or statistics, yesterday's exhibition game with
Japan's Rikkio University meant a lot more to the
Stanford baseball team than one might expect.
The Cardinal (2-3) collected three runs in the
first inning and never looked back, defeating
Rikkio 5-1 at Sunken Diamond yesterday after
noon. Sophomore first baseman Jason Castro led
Stanford's offensive charge, going 3-for-4 with one
RBI in his first game back from injury this season.
"I was just able to see the ball really well, and the
swing just took care of itself," Castro said. "We were
able to get some hits at key situations with runners
on base and just string those hits together."
Austin Yount earned the win in a rare start for
the sophomore righthander, allowing one hit and
nabbing a strikeout in two innings. Rikkio's Yasuhi
ro Kuwazuru surrendered seven hits and four
earned runs in four innings, while fanning seven.
Cardinal freshman Brandt Walker threw three
innings, allowing three hits and one run. Sophomore
Tom Stilson tallied four strikeouts in two innings,
junior Erik Davis gave up a run in two innings and
sophomore Max Fearnow struck out two in one in

ning.
"It was good for us to see a different style of
pitching with a lot of breaking balls," head coach
Mark Marquess said. "Our pitching was solid, too.
We've given up a lot of hits in the innings we've
pitched, but we ve been pretty good locating our
pitches,and we haven't walked too many."
Sophomore Sean Ratliff. freshman Toby Ger
hart and junior Michael Taylor opened up the bot
tom of the first with three straight singles. With one
out in the inning, senior shortstop Ryan Seawall
grounded out to score Gerhart. In the very next at
bat, Castro knocked a two-out double to cash in
Taylor for the early 3-0 Stanford advantage.
Kuwazuru settled down in the second, hurling
three consecutive strikeouts. But the Cardinal
struck again in the third, as Taylor hit a triple after
Rikkio third baseman Daiki Hayase had dropped
Taylor's foul pop-up earlier in the at-bat. Rikkio's
starter balked to allow Taylor a free pass home, and
Seawell whacked an RBI double, scoring sopho
more catcher Brent Milleville.
