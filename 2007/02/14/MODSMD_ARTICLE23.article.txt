Aiming lor a 17th title, the top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming team enters its first day of competition in the Pa
cific-10 Conference Championships today in Long Beach.

ot an undefeated season and a successful performance by the

we have a chance to win."
ITie Stanford team is deep with talented swimmers, but
freshmen Elaine Breeden and Julia Smit and juniors Caroline
Bruce and Brooke Bishop are expected to lead the campaign
for first in the conference.

Breeden 's outstanding freshman season earned her na
tional attention last week when College Swimming.com
named her National Collegiate Swimmer of the Week. She
also earned Stanford's Muscle Milk Student Athlete of the
Week honor. The awards came on the heels of Breeden's
sweep of the 100- and 200-yard butterfly events during the
Cardinal's defeat of No. 3 California on Feb. 3.
"The awards and my recent swims were definitely a confi
dence booster for me." Breeden said. "But they don't make
anything any easier for me this weekend, because competi
tion is still really intense and there will be a lot of swimmers
there who are tapered and ready to race."
Breeden currently holds the nation's top time for this sea
son in the 200 fly and the second-best mark in the 100 fly. She
came close to breaking school records in both events with her
swims at Cal.
" Tlie records will be in the back of my mind at the Pac-10
meet, she said. "But I'd rather focus on swimming fast and
scoring points for my team, and hopefully [the rest] will fall
into place."
Smit and Bruce have both been named Swimmer of the
Week this season. Smit has starred in the 200 freestyle, 200
backstroke and 200 and 400 individual medley events
throughout the season. She is the N0.4 all-time performer in

112!: Top-ranked Stanford enters the conference meet with a perfect
regular-season record, having survived a close meet with cross-bay rival Cal
last weekend. Cassidy Krug already won the one-meter and three-meter titles
at the Pac-10 Diving Championships last weekend. Brooke Bishop is the only
reluming individual winner from a 2006 squad that finished third in the Pac
-10 meet, and she will look to repeat as champion in the 50 free. Caroline
Bruce has returned from injury to attempt to repeat her conference and na
tional success of two years ago, when she won the 200 breast and 200 and
400 IM at Pac-10s and then the 100 and 200 breast at the NCAA meet.
the 200 free at Stanford, and No. 3 all-time in the 200 IM.
Throughout the season, she has broken pool records, both at
Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center and at away meets.
After sitting out last season with a shoulder injury. Bruce
— a two-time NCAA champion, five-time All-American and
2004 Olympian — is back and making significant contribu
tions this year. Bruce has picked up a string of first-place fin
ishes at dual meets throughout the season and has posted
NCAA "A" times in the 100 and 200
breaststroke and 200 IM.
Bishop has led the team in the
sprint freestyle and backstroke
events this year. She has consistently
captured victories at dual meets and
has achieved N( A A "A" times in the
100 back and 50 and KM) free, as well
as"B" times in the 200 back and free
events.
Although the Cardinal will look
to these four swimmers to lead
them in points, the meet is also a
good opportunity for the swimmers
who have not yet made NCAA
times this season.
"There is less pressure on the
marquee players at this meet."
Maurer said. "Instead, it's the last
chance for the other swimmers who
are looking to make the NCAAs. So
we are looking to them to carry the
burden and lead the team."
Even though Breeden may not
face the pressure of trying to quali
fy for the NCAA championships in
March, she recognizes that this is a
hiu meet for her and the team.

"The pressure is off me because 1
already have my NCAA times." she
said. "But that doesn't make the
meet any less exciting, because I
have several teammates who are
trying to get NCAA times."
For the Cardinal swimmers, who
are already looking ahead to the
NCAA championships, the Pac-10
meet will be especially tough.
"This isn't their peak meet, so
they're not going to feel very good,"
Maurer said. "It's more of a dress re
hearsal where they have a chance to
swim best times and win, but they're
going to have to be composed and
swim smart against those who are ta
pered and have more speed."
Nonetheless, Stai >rd is confi
dent that it can prove itself to be the
best team in the Pac-10.
"Our team goal is to win this
meet," Breeden said. "We really
want to win Pac-10s and then go on
and win NCAAs — that would be
incredible."
Maurer echoed the high expec
tations for the Cardinal.
"We have a lot of momentum
going into this meet, and hopefully
we can live up to the hype." she said.

PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIPS
Long Beach, Calif.

112!: Top-ranked Stanford enters the conference meet with a perfect
regular-season record, having survived a close meet with cross-bay rival Cal
last weekend. Cassidy Krug already won the one-meter and three-meter titles
at the Pac-10 Diving Championships last weekend. Brooke Bishop is the only
reluming individual winner from a 2006 squad that finished third in the Pac
-10 meet, and she will look to repeat as champion in the 50 free. Caroline
Bruce has returned from injury to attempt to repeat her conference and na
tional success of two years ago, when she won the 200 breast and 200 and
400 IM at Pac-10s and then the 100 and 200 breast at the NCAA meet.
the 200 free at Stanford, and No. 3 all-time in the 200 IM.
Throughout the season, she has broken pool records, both at
Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center and at away meets.
After sitting out last season with a shoulder injury. Bruce
— a two-time NCAA champion, five-time All-American and
2004 Olympian — is back and making significant contribu
tions this year. Bruce has picked up a string of first-place fin
ishes at dual meets throughout the season and has posted
NCAA "A" times in the 100 and 200
breaststroke and 200 IM.
Bishop has led the team in the
sprint freestyle and backstroke
events this year. She has consistently
captured victories at dual meets and
has achieved N( A A "A" times in the
100 back and 50 and KM) free, as well
as"B" times in the 200 back and free
events.
Although the Cardinal will look
to these four swimmers to lead
them in points, the meet is also a
good opportunity for the swimmers
who have not yet made NCAA
times this season.
"There is less pressure on the
marquee players at this meet."
Maurer said. "Instead, it's the last
chance for the other swimmers who
are looking to make the NCAAs. So
we are looking to them to carry the
burden and lead the team."
Even though Breeden may not
face the pressure of trying to quali
fy for the NCAA championships in
March, she recognizes that this is a
hiu meet for her and the team.

"The pressure is off me because 1
already have my NCAA times." she
said. "But that doesn't make the
meet any less exciting, because I
have several teammates who are
trying to get NCAA times."
For the Cardinal swimmers, who
are already looking ahead to the
NCAA championships, the Pac-10
meet will be especially tough.
"This isn't their peak meet, so
they're not going to feel very good,"
Maurer said. "It's more of a dress re
hearsal where they have a chance to
swim best times and win, but they're
going to have to be composed and
swim smart against those who are ta
pered and have more speed."
Nonetheless, Stai >rd is confi
dent that it can prove itself to be the
best team in the Pac-10.
"Our team goal is to win this
meet," Breeden said. "We really
want to win Pac-10s and then go on
and win NCAAs — that would be
incredible."
Maurer echoed the high expec
tations for the Cardinal.
"We have a lot of momentum
going into this meet, and hopefully
we can live up to the hype." she said.
