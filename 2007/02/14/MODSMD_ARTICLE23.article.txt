ot an undefeated season and a successful performance by the
teams divers at last weekend's Pac-10 Diving Champi
onships.
"We're really excited for the meet." head coach Lea Mau
rer said." Hie divers gave us a good position and we feel like
we have a chance to win."
ITie Stanford team is deep with talented swimmers, but
freshmen Elaine Breeden and Julia Smit and juniors Caroline
Bruce and Brooke Bishop are expected to lead the campaign
for first in the conference.

Breeden 's outstanding freshman season earned her na
tional attention last week when College Swimming.com
named her National Collegiate Swimmer of the Week. She
also earned Stanford's Muscle Milk Student Athlete of the
Week honor. The awards came on the heels of Breeden's
sweep of the 100- and 200-yard butterfly events during the
Cardinal's defeat of No. 3 California on Feb. 3.
"The awards and my recent swims were definitely a confi
dence booster for me." Breeden said. "But they don't make
anything any easier for me this weekend, because competi
tion is still really intense and there will be a lot of swimmers
there who are tapered and ready to race."
Breeden currently holds the nation's top time for this sea
son in the 200 fly and the second-best mark in the 100 fly. She
came close to breaking school records in both events with her
swims at Cal.
" Tlie records will be in the back of my mind at the Pac-10
meet, she said. "But I'd rather focus on swimming fast and
scoring points for my team, and hopefully [the rest] will fall
into place."
Smit and Bruce have both been named Swimmer of the
Week this season. Smit has starred in the 200 freestyle, 200
backstroke and 200 and 400 individual medley events
