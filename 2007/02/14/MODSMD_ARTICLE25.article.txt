# So long, Marty! Hello...?

### 
Sometimes, nice guys finish last.
And sometimes they finish
first, then last, and then they
get fired.
That's the story of how Martyhall
died in San Diego, nearly a month
after the Chargers' hopes in the
postseason died once again — this
time to the New England Patriots in
a wild home game that turned out to
be San Diego's finale for 2006.
Schottenheimer is the kind of coach
who's good enough to make you feel
sorry for him. but obviously not
good enough to keep his job.
After leading the Chargers to a
fantastic 14-2 regular season record
— the best in the NFL — a few
freak plays in the AFC Divisional
Playoffs cost San Diego its chance at
the title this year and cost Marty his
job. To be fair, it was apparent that
he probably wasn't going to be long
for San Diego anyway, given the
level of animosity that had arisen
between Chargers General Manag
er AJ Smith and him. but this termi
nation was nevertheless unforeseen.
Or at least its timing was.
The Chargers waited a month
after losing just their third game of
the '06-'O7 season before finally
showing Schottenheimer the door.
San Diego brass had to choose one
side or the other in the rift that had
grown between Smith and their
coach. And in the end. they chose
the man who had found the talent
that brought San Diego 14 wins in
stead of the guy w ho developed it. It
must have been a tough call, but it
was probably the right one, becomes
(iMs who can find talent, like Smith,
don't come along very often. And of
course Marty still carried the dread
ed coaching blemish of supposedly
being unable to "win the big one."
And now, perhaps the most tal
ented team in the NI L is without a
coach to guide it. Whoever they hire
next will ultimately have the final
say in whether this was a bold step in
the right direction, or an epic blun
der.
Make no mistake, the Charger
job is the kind of prize NFL assis
tants and college coaches dream of.
It comes with MVP LaDanian Tom
linson. It comes with young, up-and
coming quarterback Philip Rivers.
And it comes with the kind of ag
gressive 3-4 defense that has been so
en vogue in the league in recent
years.
Hut. of course, it also comes with
