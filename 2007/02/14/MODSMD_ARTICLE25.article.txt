# So long, Marty! Hello...?
## 
### 
Sometimes, nice guys finish last.
And sometimes they finish
first, then last, and then they
get fired.
That's the story of how Martyhall
died in San Diego, nearly a month
after the Chargers' hopes in the
postseason died once again — this
time to the New England Patriots in
a wild home game that turned out to
be San Diego's finale for 2006.
Schottenheimer is the kind of coach
who's good enough to make you feel
sorry for him. but obviously not
good enough to keep his job.
After leading the Chargers to a
fantastic 14-2 regular season record
— the best in the NFL — a few
freak plays in the AFC Divisional
Playoffs cost San Diego its chance at
the title this year and cost Marty his
job. To be fair, it was apparent that
he probably wasn't going to be long
for San Diego anyway, given the
level of animosity that had arisen
between Chargers General Manag
er AJ Smith and him. but this termi
nation was nevertheless unforeseen.
Or at least its timing was.
The Chargers waited a month
after losing just their third game of
the '06-'O7 season before finally
showing Schottenheimer the door.
San Diego brass had to choose one
side or the other in the rift that had
grown between Smith and their
coach. And in the end. they chose
the man who had found the talent
that brought San Diego 14 wins in
stead of the guy w ho developed it. It
must have been a tough call, but it
was probably the right one, becomes
(iMs who can find talent, like Smith,
don't come along very often. And of
course Marty still carried the dread
ed coaching blemish of supposedly
being unable to "win the big one."
And now, perhaps the most tal
ented team in the NI L is without a
coach to guide it. Whoever they hire
next will ultimately have the final
say in whether this was a bold step in
the right direction, or an epic blun
der.
Make no mistake, the Charger
job is the kind of prize NFL assis
tants and college coaches dream of.
It comes with MVP LaDanian Tom
linson. It comes with young, up-and
coming quarterback Philip Rivers.
And it comes with the kind of ag
gressive 3-4 defense that has been so
en vogue in the league in recent
years.
Hut. of course, it also comes with


Denis
Griffin

Rants and Raves
plenty of expectations. As the lone
professional football team in
Southern California, there should
be plenty of media focus on the tal
ented Chargers. And given how
good they are now,that high profile
is justified.
Yet, with a coaching staff that's
only a shell of its former self —
having lost its head coach,offensive
coordinator, defensive coordina
tor. linebackers coach and tight
ends coach — there is a leadership
\oid that needs to be filled immedi
ately. And leadership, by all ac
counts. is the one thing good old
Marty had in spades.
Which is exactly why this whole
tiling reeks of the start of a down
ward spiral. Not because firing
Marty Schottenheimer is the kind
of thing that usually takes teams a
while to get over, but because the
timing of this is the kind of thing
that desperation is born from.
Having lost out on the best of
their in-house candidates when
Wade Philips left to coach the Cow
boys and Cam Cameron left to
coach the Dolphins, the Chargers
will be searching through the scrap
heap for someone who can di op
whatever he's doing right now, re
build a decimated coaching staff
and help out with the offseason
grind, which really begins in a mat
ter of weeks. Moreover, whoever
they choose will have to be content
with playing a definite second-fid
dle to AJ Smith. Smith just won one
power struggle, and he's not about
to hire a coach who's likely to start
a new one.
That means there will be few
sexy names on the list of serious
candidates in San Diego. No Pete
Carroll or Bill Parcells. No. the
Chargers w ill be forced to settle for
a retread or an untested youngster.
A Norv Turner, Denny Green or
Rex Ryan, perhaps.
But none of those really solves
the Chargers' problems. San Diego
lias a Super Bowl-caliber roster and
needs a Super Bowl-caliber coach
logo along with it. But it's probably
too late in the offseason to find one
of those.
So failing that, what the Charg
ers need is a caretaker. Someone
with experience, someone you
know won't screw things up too
badly, even if he isn't a slam-dunk
hire, lie should be the kind of guy
who can motivate a young roster,
but at the same time he needs the
experience to keep them on an
even keel. Moreover, he'll need
connections throughout the NFL to
rebuild a decimated coaching staff.
The man the Chargers need is
someone like, well . . . Marty
Schottenheimer.
And so. when the dust has set
tled and San Diego can get back to
football and away from drama, the
final word on Martygate will prob
ably be "Whoops."

Maybe junior Denis Griffin should
ouch the Chargers. Ask him about it
it (Ijgriffk'stanford.edu.
