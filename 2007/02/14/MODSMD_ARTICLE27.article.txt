# WATER POLO
## Card drown Tigers, Trojan time 23-5 drubbing of Tigers, nemesis USC waiting in the wings By MATT LUCKY 
### 
The No. 3 Stanford women's water polo team
maintained its spot atop the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation standings with a dominating 23-5 victory
over Pacific this past Saturday in Stockton, Calif.
Beating the winless Tigers — not the most demanding
opponent on Stanford's schedule — improved the

Cardinal's record to 5-1 overall and 2-0 in conference
action.
Stanford was led in scoring by senior Katie
Hansen, whose five goals helped propel the Cardinal
to a 9-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. Stanford
also got help from sophomore Jessica Steffens and
senior Christina Hewko, who each tallied three goals
in the Cardinal victory.
With the game out of the Tigers' reach from early
on — the score was 14-3 at halftime and 20-3 at the
end of the third quarter — the younger Stanford play
ers were provided with valuable game experience.
When the final whistle blew, all five freshmen had
contributed significantly to Stan
ford's second league victory.
Kate Heddleston, a freshman
goalkeeper from Granite Bay,
Calif., started her second game of
the year. Heddleston gave up only
five goals while stopping 11 Pacific
shots.
Ilie four other Cardinal fresh
men each contributed at least one
goal to their team's impressive vic
tory Both Alex Koran and Kelly
Eaton recorded two goals in the
Stanford's thrashing of the Tigers.
Even though it is still early in the
season and the toughest competi
tion is yet to come, the experience
gained by the Cardinal's youngest
players will likely prove important
as Stanford aims to defend its M PSI

title.
"This game gave the younger
players an opportunity to gain expe
rience and earn minutes they
wouldn't normally see in a game
against tougher competition like
USC." I leddleston said.
This Saturday, the Cardinal will
try to use its momentum from the
Pacific game for a victory over \ isit
ing No. 2 USC. As both teams are
undefeated in league play, the game
will serve as a key indicator of the
favorite to win the MPSI champi
onship.
"The USC game is vital because
they are our toughest competition."
I leddleston said. "USC and UC LA
are going to be the two teams we
compete with to win another MPSI
title."
In the Stanford Invitational ear
lier this year, then-top-ranked I S(
defeated Stanford 8-6 in a game in
which the Cardinal outshot the Tro
jans. However, the Stanford players

hope that things will be different
this time around.
Last year, the Cardinal lost three
times to the Trojans, but was still
crowned the MPSF champion. In
fact, in John Tanner's decade as
Stanford's head coach, USC is the
only team against which he has a
losing record. In 26 meetings, his
teams have posted a 10-16 record.
Saturday's important match-up
could elevate the Cardinal to the
top ranking in the nation. It will also
be crucial if Stanford is to maintain
its top spot in the MPSF standings.
The Cardinal will face off against
the Trojans at 1 p.m. on Saturday,
and the players are hoping for sup
port from the home fans.
"Having a big and enthusiastic
crowd would be really helpful in
one of our biggest games of the
year." I leddleston said.
