## WASHINGTON WILL BE BACK 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Senior forward Fred Washington will return to
Stanford basketball next season to use his final
year of eligibility,Theßootleg.com has reported.
Washington was granted a fifth year by the
NCAA after a knee injury ended his junior cam
paign only six games into the season. Washington
did not decide immediately whether he would
take advantage of the extra year. Head coach
Trent Johnson had said that they would wait to
make the decision, and he announced yesterday
that Washington would be back.
"We're happy to have him back," Johnson said
to Theßootleg.com. "With Fred Washington re
turning, just based off the improvement he has
made as a player this year, he should be a much
better player next year. 1 le will be one of the focal
leaders of this basketball team, by example and
by being vocal."
Washington has started in all 23 games for the
Cardinal this year and is fifth on the team in scor
ing, averaging 7.7 points per game. His .530 shoot
ing percentage from the field is second only to
sophomore Lawrence Hill's .535 and he has
amassed a team-high 87 assists. Washington's as
sist average is the eighth-best in the Pacific-10
Conference, and he ranks ninth in assist-to
turnover ratio.
With the announcement of Washington's re

turn, the Cardinal stands to lose only two seniors
at the end of the season: guards Chris Bobel and
Carlton Weatherbv.
