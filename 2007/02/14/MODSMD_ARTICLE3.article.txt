MEET NOTES: No. 3 Stanford won a four-way
meet this weekend with a one-point lead over
runner-up lowa State. Sophomore Nicole
Ourada won the All-Around with a personal
best of 39.575 and earned Pac-10 Gymnast
of the Week honors. She is the third Cardinal
athlete in a row to win the award, following
teammates Carly Janiga and Tabitha Yim.
The Cardinal will next face the Wildcats, who
beat Washington last weekend with Karin
Wurm taking the all-around title with a score
of 39.150.

start training," head coach Kristen Smyth said. "We tell them that
we want to be eight or 10 deep on every event, with people ready
to score 9.8 or better. So we have prepared the girls for that men
tally and physically, and when they are called upon to compete,
they are ready."
The Cardinal posted a season-high 197.275 to finish more than
a full point ahead of the Cyclones in the chaotic quad meet.
"All of our meets so far have been dual meets, where we do
only one event at a time and the athletes are spotlighted one at a
time," Smyth said. "This meet was more like a three-ring circus,
with things going on in every event all night long. It requires a dif
ferent kind of focus and is great preparation and a good experi
ence to get early in the season."
Sophomore Nicole Ourada scored 39.575 to take the first All-
Around title of her Stanford career. Ourada started the meet with
a 9.850 on the vault and a 9.875 on the bars before posting back
to-back 9.925 performances on the beam and floor.
