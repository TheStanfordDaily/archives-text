MEET NOTES: No. 3 Stanford won a four-way
meet this weekend with a one-point lead over
runner-up lowa State. Sophomore Nicole
Ourada won the All-Around with a personal
best of 39.575 and earned Pac-10 Gymnast
of the Week honors. She is the third Cardinal
athlete in a row to win the award, following
teammates Carly Janiga and Tabitha Yim.
The Cardinal will next face the Wildcats, who
beat Washington last weekend with Karin
Wurm taking the all-around title with a score
of 39.150.

start training," head coach Kristen Smyth said. "We tell them that
we want to be eight or 10 deep on every event, with people ready
to score 9.8 or better. So we have prepared the girls for that men
tally and physically, and when they are called upon to compete,
they are ready."
The Cardinal posted a season-high 197.275 to finish more than
a full point ahead of the Cyclones in the chaotic quad meet.
"All of our meets so far have been dual meets, where we do
only one event at a time and the athletes are spotlighted one at a
time," Smyth said. "This meet was more like a three-ring circus,
with things going on in every event all night long. It requires a dif
ferent kind of focus and is great preparation and a good experi
ence to get early in the season."
Sophomore Nicole Ourada scored 39.575 to take the first All-
Around title of her Stanford career. Ourada started the meet with
a 9.850 on the vault and a 9.875 on the bars before posting back
to-back 9.925 performances on the beam and floor.


ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore gymnast Nicole Ourada matched or bettered her career bests in every event en route to her all-around
title in Stanford's quad meet victory over lowa State, Oregon State and San Jose State last Friday.
Ourada was named the Pacific-10
Conference Gymnast of the Week
for her career-best performance, the
third consecutive weekly honor for
Stanford. Freshman Carly Janiga
won the honor last week as did Yim
the week before.
"1 think this is the first time in
Stanford history that we have had
three in a row, and maybe even the
first time with three in the same
year," Smyth said. "It is indicative of
the contributions we are getting
from everybody on the team. To
have three different all-around ath
letes honored is very exciting."
"I think our team has been doing
so well that it's easy for us to go out
and have great meets," Ourada
added. "And that energy carries
through so that we are all able to
step up even when two major play
ers had to step down because of in
juries."
The Cardinal started the meet on
the vault, with junior Alex
Pintchouk scoring 9.900 to lead the
team. Stanford stretched its lead in
the second rotation with Janiga's
9.950, the meet's top score on that
apparatus. Her four teammates post
ed identical scores of 9.875 to solidi
fy the Cardinal's lead.
Stanford's dominance continued
on the balance beam where sopho
more Kelly Fee scored 9.950 to go
with Ourada's 9.925. Ourada was
particularly proud of her perform
ance in that rotation.
"At the beginning of the year, 1
was having some trouble [on the
beam]," she said, "so it was great to
be able to go out and do so well."
The third rotation was dampened
by a knee injury for Oregon State's
Claire Pierce during a tumbling pass
in her floor routine. As Oregon State
fell back, it became a two-way battle
between the Cardinal and lowa
State, but Stanford was too far ahead
to be caught.
The Cardinal sealed its victory on
the floor with a team score of 49.250,
including 9.925 for Ourada and
9.900 for Pintchouk.
"This year we have an incredible
amount of depth, and everyone is ca
pable of stepping up — different
people every weekend, the same

people every weekend." Smyth said.
"When they are called upon, they
are ready to go. and that is what
makes this season so exciting.This is
the largest team we have ever had
with 14 on the roster ready to con
tribute."
All in all. eight different athletes
scored points for Stanford, most of
them in multiple events.
Yim and Tricase are both out for
three to five weeks with soft tissue
injuries in the wrist and shoulder, re
spectively.
"lor the team to do so well for the
last two weeks without Tab and Liz
says a lot about the leadership on the
team, from the captains and every
body else," Smyth said. "We have
had major contributions from Kelly
Fee, Alex Pintchouk, Carly Janiga,
[junior] Lauren Elmore and the fist
goes on. What makes this team so ex
citing is that anybody on any given
night can go and to a great job. And
l ab and Liz bring a lot of energy and
enthusiasm, which really lifted the
team on Friday."
The Cardinal also drew energy
from the large and appreciative
crowd.
"It was great to have parents and
students down on the floor at the
meet," Ourada said. "And it was nice
to have four teams so that we didn't
have to wait for our events and could
just go at our own pace."
More than 1000 fans turned out
for the meet, many of them clad in
pink as part of a breast-cancer re
search fundraiser. All four teams
wore pink and red leotards made
particularly for the event.
"There were some great teams
competing on Friday," Smyth said.
"lowa State is an outstanding team
and well coached, and they have
done well after their historic 'Super
Six' last year. OSU is a great team
and San Jose State is just improving
all the time. For the athletes and the
fans, this was a great competition to
be a part of."
The Cardinal's next meet will be
this Friday in Arizona against the
No. 13 Wildcats.
