The match between Baylor and Stanford marked the incep
tion of the HP Cup. which will become an annual event. Be
tween the two schools, I IP is a familiar name.The two founders
of I IP. William 1 lewlett and Bill Packard,graduated from Stan
ford, and the company's current CEO Mark I lurd played tennis
at Baylor. Sunday's contest included a trophy presentation, and
a video of the match will air on the Tennis Channel in the near
future.
The match began with singles due to the possibility of in
clement weather. After UCLA shut out the Cardinal last week,
it seemed as though the results could not get any worse, but they
did. Freshman Richard Wire was the lone playet who managed

to win even one set against the Bruins; but on Sunday. Ba\ lor did
not give up a single set to Stanford, winning in straight sets
across the board.
Stanford's team was noticeably younger the Bears', starting
only one senior, three sophomores and three freshmen, while
Baylor returned four starters from last year.
The Card did not fare much better in doubles, with the clos
est set coming at the second doubles position, in which Wire
teamed up with freshman Paul Morrissev to drop an 8-5 deci
sion.The first and third doubles pairs both fell by scores of 8-4.
This is Stanford's third loss to Baylor in the past two seasons.
In May. the Bears narrowly edged out the Card in the quarterfi
nals of the 2006 NCAA Championship. 4-3. Stanford led 3-1, but
after a relocation to the San Francisco Tennis ( enter due to rain,
the team could not close out the match, giving Baylor just
enough of an opening to come back and clinch the berth to the
semifinals.
The Cardinal travel to Chicago this weekend to compete in
the Indoors, where they will see 10 of the top 11 teams in the na
tion. Hie University of Georgia won in 2006 and is this year's top
seed. Prior to that. Baylor nabbed the title in 2005 and host Illi
nois won back-to-back titles in 2003 and 2004. Stanford enters as
the 15th seed, with matches set to begin Friday morning.
