# Tour guides pave their own paths

You've seen them before — or at least the crowd
surrounding them.
Iliey are the gregarious, well-groomed, name-tagged
Stanford student tour guides, who routinely walk the
walk and talk the talk — backwards the whole way.
Maybe it was in the Main Quad, as a group of photo
snapping senior citizens paused to admire Memorial
Church, or in White Plaza, as a horde of prospective stu
dents and their accessorized parents prepared to pur

chase costly paraphernalia at the Stanford Bookstore.
Or maybe it was passing by a group of innocuous
looking students, when one suddenly burst into the his
tory of Stanford architecture.
Sometimes 1 start in the middle of the tour while I'm
walking around campus with my friends," confessed
Chris Elmore '08. a student guide. "My friends are like.
'Chris, shut up.'"
One can't really blame Elmore, a mathematics and
computational science major who has been tour guiding
since the end of his freshman year, for showing off a lit
tle. As official employees of the University, the tour

guides are selected through a competitive application
process in the spring. Iliose who make the cut are trained
rigorously.
"We look for a number of things in our tour guides,"
said Jennifer Bland, coordinator of Visitor Information
Services, who emphasized that the tour guides func
tioned as public relations liaisons for the University.
"We want them to be articulate and well-spoken. We
want them to be sharp, quick learners. And we want
them to be poised, professional and mature."
