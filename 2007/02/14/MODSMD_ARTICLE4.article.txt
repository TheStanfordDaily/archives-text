# Tour guides pave their own paths

### JANET KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
You've seen them before — or at least the crowd
surrounding them.
Iliey are the gregarious, well-groomed, name-tagged
Stanford student tour guides, who routinely walk the
walk and talk the talk — backwards the whole way.
Maybe it was in the Main Quad, as a group of photo
snapping senior citizens paused to admire Memorial
Church, or in White Plaza, as a horde of prospective stu
dents and their accessorized parents prepared to pur

chase costly paraphernalia at the Stanford Bookstore.
Or maybe it was passing by a group of innocuous
looking students, when one suddenly burst into the his
tory of Stanford architecture.
Sometimes 1 start in the middle of the tour while I'm
walking around campus with my friends," confessed
Chris Elmore '08. a student guide. "My friends are like.
'Chris, shut up.'"
One can't really blame Elmore, a mathematics and
computational science major who has been tour guiding
since the end of his freshman year, for showing off a lit
tle. As official employees of the University, the tour

guides are selected through a competitive application
process in the spring. Iliose who make the cut are trained
rigorously.
"We look for a number of things in our tour guides,"
said Jennifer Bland, coordinator of Visitor Information
Services, who emphasized that the tour guides func
tioned as public relations liaisons for the University.
"We want them to be articulate and well-spoken. We
want them to be sharp, quick learners. And we want
them to be poised, professional and mature."
The Visitor Information Services selects for
these traits through multiple levels of screen
ing, which include an extensive written applica
tion and group interviews.
"It's a good experience overall." said El
more, who has weathered tour guide selection
from both ends of the process. "Some of the
questions in the written application are really
insightful, and the group interview is a neat
dynamic with a lot of excited, expressive peo
ple."
Excited and expressive indeed. Armed
with a store of personal anecdotes about Stan
ford life, and statistics and historical facts
from a tour guide information binder that is
over 250 pages, the student tour guides con
duct public and private tours, oversee the
Hoover Tower Observation Platform, and
man the Visitor Information Center in Memo
rial Auditorium — all the while answering
questions and sharing personal experiences
with anyone who asks. The unenthusiastic
need not apply.
The tour guides, however, do have some
liberties in executing their duties. Instead of
assigning a scripted tour. Visitor Informa
tion Services gives students loose guidelines
and allows each personalize his or her own
tour.
"There are certain subject areas that
shouldn't be omitted from any tour, such as in
formation about Stanford's academic pro
grams." said Bland, "but we encourage our
guides to shape their tours as much as possible.
Much of that depends on the group that they're
leading, and some of that depends on the per
sonal style each tour guide brings to their tour.
No two tours are ever the same."
Somewhat predictably. Elmore — a techie,
after all — described his tour style as "fact
heavy." emphasizing statistics and'campus his
tory. Other guides, like Alexis Smith '08 and
Claire Carlson '07. noted that their tours relied
more heavily on personal anecdotes and de
tails about student life.
"When I give a tour. I think about the spe
cific details I would remember if I was a
tourist." said Smith, a history major. "For exam
ple, if 1 was a prospective student visiting cam
pus. I wouldn't necessarily remember the archi
tectural style of Memorial Auditorium, but I
would remember that every Sunday MemAud
hosts FLiC'KS. and that students fly paper air
planes during the movie."
Carlson, who is a political science and com
munications double-major with a voice hoarse
from broomballing, said that she uses a wide
array of personal anecdotes, from her fresh
man ski trip to fountain-hopping, to illustrate
her particular Stanford experience.
"Stanford is so known for its students that visi
tors arc most interested in hearing from the ac
tual students." said Carlson. "As a Stanford stu
dent, you already know most of the basic infor
mation. It's just about presenting it in a coher
ent fashion."
The information that coheres into a tour dif

fers from tour group to tour group, noted
Smith. A tour given for a group of senior citi
zens, for example, would focus more heavily on
the architectural elements and history of the
campus, while a prospective undergraduate
tour would feature discussions about housing,
dining, academic requirements and campus
culture.
But interest in some topics spans all ace
ranges.
"Both the senior citizens and the prospec
tive undergraduates ask all about my life at
Stanford," said Smith. "They're both really ex
cited to hear about Stanford from a student
perspective."
Being a tour guide is not all glamorous,
many of the guides agreed. Manning Hoover
Tower on rainy days, for example, was de

scribed as "down time," by Carlson, who does
her homework and befriends fellow guides
during the long stretches when visitors do not
come by. Smith noted that she and her fellow
guides had a 20-minute shift system for the Ob
servation Platform, so that no guide gets "Ra
punzeled" at the top of the tower.
Hoover Tower in general seemed to be a
generative topic for the guides.
"Every single person asks when the bells
ring," said Elmore. "It's kind of an inside joke
with the guides. We get the question all the
time." (They ring most Wednesdays between 5
and 6 p.m., and on special occasions, like Com
mencement. Convocation, and Baccalaure
ate.)
" ITie tour guides had a costume party
once," said Smith, "and my best friend went as

Hoover Tower and attached a bunch of tiny
bells to herself. Everybody who saw her asked
her when the bells rang."
The ambassadors of the Stanford spirit
bond over Hoover Tower?
"Well." said Carlson. "We're a very social
group. We joke that we're a 'fratority' of tour
guides. People are always planning out-of
work activities. It's a good group"
"Tour guiding is by far one of my favorite
things at Stanford," said Smith, adding that she
met her core group of friends through the tour
guiding program. "I look forward to guiding.
Even on days when I think don't want to tour,
as soon as I say my name and welcome my
group, it perks up my day."

A tour guide leads a tour of mostly prospective undergaduates. While tour guides tailor their tours to address the specific audience at hand,
they say that a universally addressed theme is their own experience at Stanford - and what time the bells in Hoover Tower ring.
