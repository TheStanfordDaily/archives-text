Love is in the air. and graduate and under
graduate students alike are tapping into the
Valentine's Day spirit to help tundraise for
charitable causes and boost turnout for such
annual events as the Graduate Student Coun
cil's (CISC) Valentine's party and Mixed Com
pany's "Love Sucks" a cappella show.
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and Sigma Chi
fraternity teamed up to sell Crush Grams
available from 11 a.m. - 1 p.m. in White Plaza
from l eb.S to today. Ihe grams sell for $ 1 each.
$2 to remain anonymous and if the recipients
shell out an extra dollar they can find out who
sent the gram. All proceeds from the fundraiser
will go to the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto, a so
cial service agency that provides homeless and
at-risk individuals with access to various re
sources.
Side by Side, a student group that sings a
cappella for elderly people in the Bay Area, is
also cashing in on the Valentine's spirit. For $20.
the group will perform a romantic song routine
and deliver a personalized message to a person
of the donor's choice. For an additional $5. the
troupe will offer the person a flower.
"Our vision is to bring smiles to an audience
that is often overlooked," the group's Web site
explains. "We're holding a Valentine's Day
fundraiser so that you can help us serve the eld
erly community while furthering your own ro
mantic interests."
Members of the 2007 Relay for Life Commit
tee decided to spread awareness about the annu
al event, which raises money to support cancer
research, by organizing a fundraiser of its own.
"We are in the early stages of this year's Relay
and don't have many teams started yet," said the
group's publicity representative Jacobi Grillo'o9.
"We are hoping that this [fundraiser] will get the
word out."
Relay for Life members sold Charity Bear
stuffed animal puppies and teddy bears for five to
seven dollars each. The proceeds will go toward
the group's goal of fighting cancer.
Last year's event raked in $80,000. and mem
bers hope that this year's — which is scheduled
for May 19 and 20 — will raise a similar amount.
The American Cancer Society, the official bene
ficiary of the Relay's funds, will be using the funds
to further research; set up Cancer Information
Services, Community Programs and Services;
and maintain Advocacy and Public Policy cam
paigns.
Andy Sadhwani, an Escondido Village com
munity associate and graduate student in aero
nautics and astronautics, received $6,700 of re
serve funding from the GSC to coordinate the
Heart's Desire Graduate Valentine's Party,
which was held last Friday night.
Organizers focused their efforts on boost
ing female attendance by advertising a no-line
policy for women and offering gift certificates
to La Belle Spa, Sephora and Bath & Body
Works.

ITiough this year's total turnout was not sig

niticantly better than last year's, Sadhwani re
mained optimistic about the event's seemingly
growing popularity.
"[The advertising] increased the attendance
of females by about fourfold," he said. "Last year
we had 500 people. This year we had about 500
people. If it hadn't rained, [attendance] may have
pushed 700 people."
Mixed Company had a packed house for its
annual Love Sucks Valentine's Day show, also
held last Friday, in Toyon Lounge.
"This year's turnout was probably a bit more
than last year's," said Mixed Company president
Daniel Herriges '07. "We filled all the seats in
Toyon Lounge, plus a good number of people
were sitting on the floor and in the balcony."
The satiric anti-Valentine's Day show began
in 1988, when Mark Van Haren "91 noted that
much of Mixed Company's repertoire consisted
of bitter breakup songs. Over the years, the show
has become a Stanford tradition and has retained
its popularity with students, drawing big crowds
year after year.
The show featured colorful skits, including
one in which female Mixed Company members
evaluated an auditionee on the basis of his sexu
al prowess; another demonstrated how to put on
a condom using bananas.
I lerrigessaid that he just wanted the audience
to "discover some cool new music" and to host a
good show that satirized "love,relationships, ran
dom hookups and of course things about Stan
ford culture that are fun to skewer."
"It's all meant to be in good fun." Herriges
added. "If you've seen our poster for the show,
which features a graphic of Cupid lying dead on
the ground with an arrow in his back,you get the
idea."
