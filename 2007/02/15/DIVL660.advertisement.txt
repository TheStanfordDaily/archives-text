As you read this— even if you're reading it online— your computer is yawning.
Most PCs today are capable of trillions of operations per second So from the computer's point of view, when you are
reading — or even when you are typing as fast as you possibly can — there is really not much going on; the computer is loafing. Even more so when
you do mundane things like think, eat, sleep, talk to your friends.
Volunteer Distributed Computing enables PC users to donate such unused computing capacity to
scientific research or other projects. Typically, this works something like a screensaver. Only rather than running an animation of
a fishbowl when your machine is idle, you instead run computations on behalf of a project you choose to support. The project aggregates the idle
resources from you and from other participants to form a single "virtual" computer.
Gridßepublic is a nonprofit organization created to facilitate public interest research via Volunteer
Distributed Computing. While Gridßepublic is not the first distributed computing project, it is unique in that it enables users to discov
er, join, and manage participation in a wide range of scientific endeavors, from a single and simple interface. By lowering technical barriers to partic
ipation (ie a simple "click and run" interface) and by creating a central web portal and brand for publicity and advertising in mass media, the organi
zation aspires to enroll tens of millions of users within three years. This will make available perhaps tens of PetaFlops of computing capacity for
research in biology, medicine, environmental study, physics, and other areas — a factor of magnitude increase over what is available via today's largest
supercomputers.
Historically, significant increases in available computing power have always enabled new insights
and discoveries. Gridßepublic participants are helping others to make these leaps; you can join them at www.gridrepublic.org.
Gridßepublic, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, has a mostly volunteer staff and is offering internships in programming, graphic design, and grass
roots marketing/PR. The staff is small so the work is always challenging. Nobody at Gridßepublic stuffs envelopes or gets coffee. But because it is
primarily a volunteer outfit, internships are unpaid.
