Through its expert staff and programs, and through partnerships with outside
organizations, the Foundation is a source of free research, facts, analysis and
information on national health policy issues that are widely used by policymakers,
the media, the health care community, and the general public. Over the years the
Foundation has achieved a singular standing as a trusted, "go to" resource for
information on national health policy issues. It also has a major presence on the
Web, through its website, kff.org, and through its health information service,
kaisernetwork.org, along with four other websites.
The Foundation also operates some of the largest public health information and HIV
awareness campaigns in this country and around the world in partnership with
media organizations. These campaigns have won many awards such as the
distinguished Emmy and Peabody awards. The Foundation also runs programs in the
U.S. and abroad to strengthen health journalism in order to better inform the public
about health issues. And it has a special longstanding interest in South Africa. The
Foundation is headquartered in Menlo Park, California and operates substantial
facilities in Washington, DC where about half its staff are based, including a
state-of-the art conference center and broadcast studio. The Kaiser Family
Foundation is not a grant-making foundation and is not associated with Kaiser
Permanente or Kaiser Industries.
Serious applicants are encouraged to review the Foundation's main website at
www.kff.org and the Message from the President, which can be found in the
"About Us" section on that site.
