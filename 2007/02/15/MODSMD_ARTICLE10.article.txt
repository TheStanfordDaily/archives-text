## Bacteria: our faithful companions 
### 
I haven't felt lonely at all this week.
Ihat's because I recently found out
that I have lots of company. 'ITie
bacteria in and on my body outnum
ber my own cells by a factor of 10 to
one.
From birth on. human beings are
crawling with bacteria. Bacteria swim
in our mouths, carpet our intestines
and set up shop between our toes.
Some are good, some are bad and
most seem not to trouble us either
way.
Our bacterial passengers have
made news this week as a result of a
new study. Scientists were interested
in the kind of bacteria that colonize
human skin. While other bacteria, like
the bacteria of our mouths and intes
tines.have been well studied.skin bac
teria have long been overlooked. So.
NYIJ researchers set out to remedy
that. Iliey swabbed the forearms of six
healthy volunteers, and used genetic
analysis to tell what kinds of bacteria
were clinging to their skin.
Hie results were surprising. ITie
scientists found IK2 species of bacte
ria. including a dozen that had never
been seen before! Each subject had
about 50 species. And 75 percent of
those were shared with nobody else.
What's more, when the subjects were
re-examined several months later,
many of the original bacteria had
been replaced by new ones.
We are walking ecosystems! Iliis is
so weird, and so awesome. I can't
focus in lecture anymore, because I'm
marveling at the microbial zoos all

around me. What yet-to-be-discov
ered microbe is he hosting on his
kneecap? Are two species locked in a
battle for control of her earlobe? Was
his shower that morning a microbial
holocaust?
More than just inspiring curiosity,
our unique bacterial bouquet can af
fect us in surprising ways. Yours could
be making you fat.
Gut bacteria are the unsung he
roes of digestion. They break down
knotty carbohydrates, crunch sugars
into manageable bits and even pro
duce vitamin K for their human hosts.
Different people have different as
sortments of these tiny helpers. In the
name of science, researchers at Wash
ington University School of Medicine
in St. Louis recently did something
very disgusting. Iliey dug through
feces from heavy and thin volunteers
and analyzed its bacterial content. In
terestingly, they found that feces from
obese individuals held different bac
teria than feces from their lean coun
terparts. The fat volunteers had 20
percent more bacteria from a class
called Firmicutes and 90 percent
fewer bacteria from a class called Bac
teroidetes. Next, the same obese vol
unteers lost weight on a yearlong diet.
Their gut flora was then analyzed
again (more picking through feces!).
The now-leaner volunteers had
gained Bacteroidetes and lost Firmi
cutes.
So. losing weight can change the
microbial community in our guts. But
the reverse is also true. In another ex
periment. biologists raised mice in a
sterile environment, so they would
have no gut flora at all. 1 lalf of these
microbe-free mice got injections of
gut bacteria from fat mice, and the
other half were injected with bacteria
from skinny mice. The mice with the
"fat" microbes gained twice as much
weight as the mice with the "skinny"
microbes.
How can bacteria he affecting
weight gain? It turns out some bacte
ria do their job better than others. An
individual with more efficient bacte
ria gains more calories from the same
cheeseburger than someone with less
efficient bacteria. Over time, those
extra calories can add up.
Beyond making us fat or thin, bac
teria can teach us about our history.
Scientists generally agree that mod
ern humans had their genesis in Africa
and gradually fanned out to all the
places we find them today. But it's
hard to know when this all happened.
(I guess no one thought to leave a
note.)
Enter bacteria to the rescue! Heli
cobacter pylori <\vc stomach microbes
that look like hot dogs with hair.They
gained infamy as the bugs that cause
ulcers, but they are actually present in
most people without making them
sick. I lumans likely caught them from
big cats (like cheetahs or lions) before
our species left Africa approximately
40.000 years ago. Because they have
been our passengers for so long, they
can tell us about our history. Bacterial
genes, like other genes, tend to accu
mulate mutations at a steady rate,
which makes them a kind of microbial
clock. If we test the Helicobacter py
lori from a Maasai warrior against the
Helicobacter pylori from a Wall Street
day trader, we can compare their
unique mutations. For example, if we
