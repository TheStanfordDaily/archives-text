### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Who better to spend Valentine's Day with
than Ralph Nader?
Ihe consumer advocate, former presidential
candidate and author of "Unsafe at Any Speed"
spoke last night to students and community
members in Kresge Auditorium as part of the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
"You've got about 15.000 days before you turn
65." Nader began." l ime will go faster and faster."
Nader's speech focused on how he believes
Stanford students who he said are "uniquely
entitled and equipped to fill the democracy gap"
— can make the best use of that time.
"You will climb escalators while others will
climb ladders or cliffs," he said.
But he argued that it is more important to ad

dress America's pressing societal challenges
problems that he contends very few people are
doing anything about.
"The misallocation o! human resources is in
sane," Nader said. "Slap yourself around. Shake
yourself up. It's easy to do difficult things if you're
prepared to expect difficult things."
In an interview before his speech, Nader told
The Daily that his goal at Stanford was to "give
students a new view of the utility of a higher edu
cation that they might not be aware of and what
kind of content should be in higher education il
they're going to prepare themselves for making
the most out of a functioning democrat*) and de
fending it against its erosions."
Students expressed mixed reactions to
Nader's goal.
"Honestly, I felt like he was lecturing us." said
Carlee Brown W. who was one of the first atten

dees to leave Kresge."lt was the same 'you-have
the-powet speech most of us have been hearim;
since childhood."
Ling Shao W said Nader's talk was stimulat
ing.
"1 think we need a refresher once in a while."
he said,"from someone who's really idealistic."
Alan Morrison, a senior lecturer at the Law
School, introduced Nader before the speech, de
scribing him as "a man of tireless energy, great vi
sion and refusal to accept injustice."
Morrison called Nader "a civic person," a label
Nader says he is proud to hold.
"By building more civic institutions, such as
the Center for Civic Leadership at Princeton,
we're starting a pattern that can be emulated by
alumni groups all over the country." Nader told
ITie Daily. "The Haas Center at Stanford is
trying to do the same thing."
Justin Liu '07. director of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, said he believes Nader's
speech and ideals can give new life, not just
to public service at Stanford, but also to the
campus as a whole.
" Ihough Ralph Nader is a name that
elicits mixed feelings, his history in politics
and his outspoken advocacy of environmen
tal issues and consumer rights is profoundly
relevant to much of the Stanford communi
ty." Liu said.
Continuing the civic tradition. Nader be
lieves. is one of the most important goals for
America today. But he said there is one
major obstacle.
"We're not prepared to do that because
we don't learn civic skills in school," Nader
said. "We spend too much time looking at
screens and not enough looking at each
other."
"If I asked you to write a 1.000-word
essay on your civic skills." Nader continued,
"you're entitled to ask. What are they?'"
Nader said he hopes the students he ad
dressed in Kresge last night will lead the
world in solving its most serious problems,
and he issued a call to action at the end of his
speech.
"Do you have any idea of the talent in
this room?" he asked a hushed audience.
"Can you even imagine (he open doors, the
closed doors you'll open?"
