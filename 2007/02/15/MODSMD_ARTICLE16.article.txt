## IT launches new spam filter Spam routed to separate mailbox, effective today 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
|SPAM:####| I.ast week, a number of students
fell victim to an email scam perpetrated In spam
mers masquerading as Bank of America officials.
Today, IT Services will institute a new filtering tech
nique in an attempt to lower the amount ol spam
students receive.
According to an informational email sent to stu
dents yesterday, IT Services will stop delivering
email it marks as [Sl*/\M:####| directly to inboxes. It
will instead route these messages to a foldei desig
nated for spam. Emails in this folder which will
remain accessible to users will be automatically
deleted after 30days. I Iserscan choose to deactivate
this default setting or institute even stricter blocking
controls at http://tools.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/filter
spam.

The changes will affect only users with an (P'stan
ford.edu address, and will not affect individuals who
forward their Stanford email to another account or
email server, such as Gmail.
Last October. IT Services ended the delivery of
emails marked as [SPAM:#####] to mailboxes I lie
number of pound siting reflects the degree of confi
dence that the message is spam.
"In the fall. I I Services noticed that basically be
tween (•>() percent and 70 percent of the mail coming
to Stanford was spam." said Lxecutivc Director of
IT Services Mill ('lebsch."We instituted a big change
at Stanford, and it was part of why things got better
we took all of the mail that was getting tagged at
five pound signs, and we blocked it at the perime
ter."
Clebseh said this action significantly reduced the
strain on both email users and 11 Services, and he
expects the new update to have the same effect
"We |blocked spam] for two reasons: Number
one. people were dying of spam; but numbei two, we
were spending most of the day backing up spam." he
said. "By making thai chance, we really went from
18-hour days to run our back-ups to
four or five hours a day. That pro
duced a huge gain for the University
and for our clients."
Clebsch said he was surprised
that people had virtually no com
plaints about the change in the fall.
"None of that spam was retriev
able because we never let it come
in." he said. "I had worried we would
get a lot of phone calls, and we basi
cally had no complaints at all. It
shocked me."
IT Services Info Systems Project
Manager Nancy Ware said in an
email to The Daily that she believed
the current changes would be effec
tive based on previous successes.
"We believe these changes will be
effective in reducing spam delivery
to mailboxes," she said."We base our
confidence on our experiences since

October 2006...We expect the addi
tional changes will further reduce
the amount of spam delivered to fac
ulty, staff and student email mailbox
and improve general email perform
ance."
However. Clebsch noted that the
new filtering techniques will not
eliminate more deceptive spam like
the Bank of America phishing
emails sent last week.
"We continue to encourage that
everyone should be wary of re
sponding to requests for personal
information from unsolicited
sources," Ware said. "Remember,
people and organizations who send
spam and/or phish-type messages
use whatever means they can to by
pass commercially available filters
in order to have their messages hit
your mailbox. They continually
make changes to how they send
their messages to avoid capture by
these services."
