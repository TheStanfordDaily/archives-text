## Editorial Board Three cheers for Sixth Man 
### 
Few groups on campus arc as large, well
organized, or recognizable as the Sixth
Man Club, the student cheering sec
tion for men's basketball. It certainly does
not hurt that the club is funded and over
seen by the Athletic Department, or that
men's basketball is one of Stanford Athlet
ics' highest revenue generators, or even that
the main focus of the Sixth Man Club is
watching basketball, a generally enjoyable
activity
Yet even with all of these advantages, the
Sixth Man Club was not always huge — it
had 30 members in its first season — and
the managers over the years deserve credit
for building a strong program. Us current
prominence is definitely a welcome sign for
the team, but also holds a value that goes be
yond the outcome of any particular game or
even season.
To be sure, the Sixth Man Club is de
signed first and foremost to help the basket
ball team win games, and there is little ques
tion that it has an impact. Starting forward
Lawrence 1 (ill was aware of the fan group's
vitality even before he arrived at Stanford.
"I heard other teams don't like playing here
because they know [the Sixth Man Club]
will be loud, rooting for the good guys." he
said. When asked how he feels about the
club, he replied instantly. " Ilie Sixth Man
Club is vital to our team's success."
If that sounds like a rehearsed line, it's
because it probably is. A similarly worded
message was emailed to Sixth Man Club
members on behalf of 11 ill altera recent vic
tory. and it echoes the appreciation players
and coaches have voiced since the club's in
ception.
"The Sixth Man Club here is more im
portant than the coaches." head coach
Trent Johnson said in a 2005 interview with
the Daily. "It's more important than me.
|The basketball programj's not about our
coaches, and Cod bless our donors, but it's

about our students."
llic Sixth Man Club has been criticized
periodically for distasteful cheers about the
personal lives of players on the opposing
team and other rowdy behavior. But even
with the occasional incident, the group pro
vides a way for students in different dorms,
majors and classes to come together with
out question. For this short period, nothing
matters except the game, and the enthusi
asm of these moments allows fans to endure
hours in line, and even nights camping out.
It might be too much to say that the Sixth
Man ('lub is an accurate cross-section ol the
school, but the number of students trying to
do homework in line or at halftiinc, as well
as the increasing presence of graduate stu
dents, suggests a good start.
Finally, beyond just giving support to the
team and a fun environment for students,
the Sixth Man C 'lub has also channel enthu
siasm and popularity to community sup
port. Commemorative gray Sixth Man shirts
liave been sold to the general public, and all
of the proceeds go to support the Lucillc
Packard Children's Hospital.
In many ways it is unfair that othersports
do not have the same following the Sixth
Man Club gives to men's basketball. It is
hard to place exact blame for this disparity,
but the fact that other sports are attempting
to follow suit with similarly designed fan
sections could help.
We know that not everyone is in the
Sixth Man Club, or even a basketball fan.
but the men's team is at a crucial point in the
season. Last week's painful road trip in
Washington sunk them out of national rank
ings, and it poured water on some of the
hype surrounding the season's early success.
In tonight's game against Oregon State,and
Saturday's against Oregon, a strong Sixth
Man Club presence could go a long way to
help restore confidence. We hope to see you
there.
