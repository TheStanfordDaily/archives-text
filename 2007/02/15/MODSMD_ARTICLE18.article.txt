So I got hired to he a featured writer at a
dating Website called DateSmartPeo
ple. com. I was pretty sure the gig would
n't last, because the entire enterprise banked
on the idea that smart people arc sexy.
Hie people hired me based on a column 1
wrote last Valentine's Day which I'm pretty
sure I wrote after a particularly bad breakup
and wanted to make everyone feel as miser
able as I was. I was broken, bitter man with a
large vocabulary and a predilection for
bingeingon fun-dip. Ihey said I captured the
exact sentiment they wanted.
In addition to writing for the place. I also
was asked to put up a profile so I could join
the dating community. Maybe I can find the
female version of me! Perhaps she too enjoys
punk and breaks out into hives upon eating
Doritos. Oh. 1 can hope.
For a Website about smart people, it's re
markably stripped down. None of this "per
sonality" test stuff that other sites rely on. No.
if you're smart, you should be intelligent
enough to make things work out Well-adjust
ed equals intelligent. Ilnis. the only way to get
onto Date Smart People is to be well-adjust
ed; the only people who apply to be on the
Website aren't well-adjusted. If you were
well-adjusted, you wouldn't need Date -
mart People.com. Joseph I Icller's new book:
"('atch 20- Some thing."
They ask me about how I describe myself,
whether or not 1 'm "outgoing" or "skeptical"
or a "casual drinker." Well. I may be an outgo
ing skeptical casual drinker,but what I'm re
ally looking for is that reclusive, paranoid,
heavy drinker. She would be fun to date. 1 bet.
We can talk about how much we hate every
thing from the romantic confines of her
mountain cave. Our relationship ends vio
lently when she breaks a bottle over my head
for suspecting that I'm cheating on her with
the rock in the corner.
I crafted my own profile perfectly. 1 made
sure that people who I can connect with will Ix;
easily able to find my page. So I used some
"hot words" to get my name out there. When
they search for these words, my profile will
come to the top. It's like Google bombing, ex
cept hopefully I won't be outdone by that
hockey player who shares my name. I le gets
all the dates. So I chose the search terms:
"books." "kind hearted sea-lion" and "Jim
Henson." On my profile. I explained of my
miraculous escape from New Jersey with the
help ofa caring marine mammal (not Sting).as
well as my amazing ability to remember the
entire song "'lhe Rainbow Connect ion "ofthe
"Muppct Movic"famc.( )K.so I embellished a
little. But you have to put your Ivst foot for

ward on these Websites or else you're not
going to get any hits, banning my proverbial
feathers. I waited for the ladies to contact me.
l our months later, my anti-social profile
got a hit. It seemed love had knocked on my
digital door.and I had turned out all the lights
and pretended I wasn't home. A person had
contacted me a month ago, and I hadn't even
returned her message! What a terrible first
impression I was making. And look at this
digital lawn, it's just dead.
I ler name was Julie, and she liked to use
commas to differentiate her thoughts, rather
than proper punctuation. I was immediately
intrigued. 1 thought, man. someone who spits
in the face of the grammatical authorities
must be great in the sack.
Hut she was really pushy. In the same
email as her introduction and her insistence
on wanting to get to know me (she didn't
comment on my ability to recite " Ihe Rain
bow C 'onnection"),she told me she wanted to
send me a picture really soon. Also, she in
cluded a link to her site. Where she was wait
ing for me. Huh?
I suppose it's a bit disheartening to have
your first contact over a dating service to be a
spammer. She didn't even fill out her profile.
I began to realize that we would never work
out. For someone who has a live Webcam,
that's a hard statement for me to make. She
lists no passions. I don't like dispassionate
people. She says her religion is "N/A." mak
ing me wonder if she's already taken, or
rather, forsaken. I mean. I'm a good listener.
But I don't like it when they speak in tongues.
It also didn't help that she listed herself as
"homosexual." Man. I'm tired of it when les
bians invite me to come watch their live We
bcams. It's always kind of a one-sided conver
sation â€” whatever I talk about, they always
find it way too exciting.
Well. I guess I should look on the bright
side. If the spammers and phishers are using
the Website to peddle their crap, it must still
exist. Perhaps my romantic advice columns
can be read by the various serial spammers in
their huge warehouses of cubicles. In the hun-

No! Not in that way. Dammit, this
didn't come across right at all. Screw
it. I lappy Valentine's Day.
