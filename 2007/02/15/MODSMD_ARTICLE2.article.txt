# Theorizing Stanford's problems
## 
### 
What the hell? Sorry. That's
not appropriate. Hell does
n't go ice-cold for a week
end. Scoring 45 points against Wash
ington State is as excusable as 45
points in a game gets. Washington
State is packed with upperclassmen.
and has played lockdown defense in
each of its 20 wins this season.
Washington, however, plays de
fense like Britney Spears wears
panties â€” with embarrassing irregu
larity. At over 75 points allowed per
game, the team is last in the confer
ence in scoring defense, and that's
even after Sunday's debacle. If Stan
ford had played that game against
Washington State. I don't think they
would have scored 30.
So then, why did Stanford make
the Huskies look like Ben Wallace's
Detroit Pistons, and what does it
mean for this team going forward?
Theory I: No offensive ammo. Robin
is in a slump ("He's hit the wall."

Mitch and Fred can't shoot. Landry
has a beautiful stroke but an ugly
percentage and the rest of the roster
is offensively limited, save for Brook

Analysis
I ope/ and I.awrence Hill. Ami when
those guys have quiet days, like I lill
did at Washington State (zero
points), or Brook did at Washington
(six points), it ean get ugly.
Plus, of course. Anthony (loods is
likely out four to six weeks with a
high ankle sprain. (' I Tie Pae-10 Tour
nament is in three weeks and the
NCAA Tournament starts in four.)
I lis MRI was not scheduled until
next week, so he's definitely not
playing this weekend.
C ioods was in a serious slump be
fore his injury, though, and one play
er does not make a team. Still, things
have gotten so desperate that walk
on Kenny Brown could he seeing
more and more minutes. Right now.
he's the only guard that can hit a
three.
"I've said since day one that
Kenny Brown was the best shooter
on this team," Fred Washington said.
Iheory 2:'lliis team is young, and lets
up its focus, especially on the road.
Stanford turned it over 19 times
against Washington and must have

been out-hustled to as many loose
balls.
"I think we lost that competitive
edge a little bit," Taj linger said. "I
think we had some success and then
we got loose with our approach. We
know we're a good team, but we also
know if we don't prepare and get fo
cused. we can be a really bad team."
Theory 3:' l lie team is scared. We all
saw a lot of tentative play in Seattle,
and a lot of passed-up open looks.
'Ilie reluctance to pull the trigger, in
turn, causes teams to sag oil guards,
which leads to forced passes into
double teams and turnover after
turnover.
Right now. Stanford, and espe
cially Mitch Johnson, just needs to
shoot the rock.
Washington made this point
Monday, while jokingly referring to
Mitch's shooting woes with the fun
niest line of the season:
"1 tell him |to] shoot the ball
every time." he said. "Take 15 shots a
game. 1 don't care. I just want him to
shoot the ball. Pad my rebound stats
or something."
Theory 4: Ilie Pac-10's pretty darn
good. I ley. 7-5 in conference is 7-5.
and if the team can grab three or four
more wins, it's in the Tournament.
Washington State could win the

league and Washington's probably
as talented as anyone in the league,
save for UCLA. It's better to play
poorly in games you're probably
going to lose anyway than blow
winnable games with poor perlorm
ances.
'Iliat's all true, but it goes out the
window tonight. II some Ireak acci
dent were to send I aw rence 11 ill and
the Lope/ twins alongside Anthony
(ioods on the stationary bikes, you
could still make a compelling argu
ment that Stanford should beat Ore
gon State at home.
Hold homecourt tonight, and
hold it against fellow bottom-leeder
Arizona State. Ilien win one or two
of the remainder (vs. Oregon and
Arizona, at UCLA and Southern
California) and NCAAs, here we
come.
(iiven this team's youth,and seri
ous lack ol shooting, I think that is
about as much as fans can hope for.
Besides, with only Weatherby and
liobel leaving this offseason, this
should be a preseason top-25 team
eiaht months from now.
