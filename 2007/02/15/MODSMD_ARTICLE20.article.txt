# How do we go from college drinking to wine sipping?
## 
### 
I am here to be honest: I have been injudi
ciously drunk before. (Mom. I know you
are reading this, and I'm sorry.) I've had
hangovers from hell — headaches that won't
stop and eyes so sensitive that turning on my
desk lamp seems like a white dwarf superno
va-ed right it) my room. 1. like so many col
lege drinkers, have been stupid.
I'd like to think as a senior I have learned
my lessons — 1 don't drink as much or as fre
quently. What hasn't changed, however, is
that 1 still knock'em hack in a completely col
lege way — quickly and cheaply. Why con
tinue to force your poor tongue to suffer the
hitter aftertaste of malt liquor when you
could get it over with all at once? Who needs
bottled wine when four times as much comes
in a bag for half the price?
While these questions seem rhetorical to
me. to many, they are not. I can only imagine
the beer-lover cringing over his dark lager
and the wine connoisseur wincing at the
thought of I'ranzia. I will soon be out of this
college cocoon, however, left to flutter in the
real world, where Margeurites don't pick me
up and drop me off at fun bars, drinks don't
come in red Solo cups and boat races are ac
tual races between boats. When does our al
cohol paradigm shift? When do we stop say
ing" I got drunk and made out with Alai."and
start saying "Alai. I brought you a versatile
full-bodied Pinot Noir that will perfectly
complement your mother's I ritrean braised
chicken"?
During this epoch of our lives, young and
spry as we are.thinking is allowed — expect
ed. if anything. Whether you sip a margarita
occasionally or play Beirut every night, col
lege and drinking go to together like the
l acebook and stalking — once you are there,
it just sort of happens. But I've gone to Vegas

and seen the balding 40 year old who at noon
is already sporting a foot-long margarita and
a confused look, and I pity the poor soul for
leading such a sad life. And then I go buy a
foot-long margarita myself.
So. when is it ok for us to drink, and when
are we too old?
Maybe the change happens organically
and smoothly — our work schedules force
us to go to bed early and wake up early. On
Saturdays we have to go into the office to
finish important and very pressing projects,
and on Sunday mornings we play basketball
in the local grown-up league. Our drinking
naturally wanes until one day a co-worker
chuckles and remembers playing Beirut,
and suddenly you remember how back in
the wild days of your youth, you used to
drink alcohol.
Or perhaps the transition is jarring? Per
haps we cling to our old habits, the only way
we know how to party. I envision myself, un
comfortable and self-conscious at an office
party, sipping Martinelli's and awkwardly
laughing at stories my boss tells about his
kids — they sure do say the darndest things.
Afterwards, all the recent post-grads who arc
also trying to get their bearings in the social
world of adults go to one guy's apartment,
drink beer and watch "'Hie Daily Show."
making fun of the grown-ups and their quaint

sobriety.
I think about this post-college drinking
world and all those expensive cocktails at
bars, and 1 wonder it it will still be OK to pre
party before going 0ut...0r does that make
you cheap and so 22? I especially wonder
about l'rat boys — yes, I just made a sweeping
generalization — and all the rest of Stan
lord's heavy drinkers. 11' you are 'never an al
coholic as long as you are in college' then
what happens when one day in June you sud
denly find yourself just an alcoholic? Do you
just drop the habit? Or do you become the
sad. too-drunk 40 year old ?
1 think it comes down to — and gel ready
for this never before heard til pearl of alcohol
wisdom — understanding why we drink. We
all know it skews our judgment, makes us ir
responsible. But it also makes us relax, laugh
more, socialize easier. Really, it is an accept
ed social crutch: something to do, a way to let
loose, a get-out-of-jail free card we use to ex
plain far too many things.
Maybe we undergo a drinking evolution
because our lives undergo a revolution, and
we really just end up not needing booze that
much any more. Our grown-up lives don't
have as much room for drinking, and eventu
ally we go to bars less, party less, drink less.
Willi our nice jobs, we treat ourselves to nicer
things—fancy clothes, better cars, less-dis
gusting alcohol. And bwammo, in the same
way you realized you were drunk for the first
time Ireshman year.you'll hear a voice doling
out wine and meal suggestions... and recog
nize it as your own.
