## Stanford Guest House Article Omits Grievances 
### ZEB FELDMAN 
On behalf of the employees who resigned
from the Stanford Guest House and many
who continue to work there I would like to
comment on the February 12. 2007 article
"(iuest House workers walk out" and the
subsequent letter to the editor of February 1.1.
2(X)7 by Michael F. Van Fosse n. Both articles
omit many grievances and realities that have
shaped the worsening conditions at the (iuest

I louse and do not clearly articulate the aston
ishing level of mismanagement that led to live
resignations in late January.
Against the backdrop of four general
managers in two years, the retirement of the
hotel computer system in April 2(X)ft without
replacement, open positions being posted for
a year without hiring, an increase in work
load, the use of "temps" for 15 months, a 25%
pay cut and the proposed removal of chairs
and water from the front desk, one can see

why resignation en masse was not as surpris
ing as Vanhossen suggested, "Wc were ab
solutely dumbfounded that some of these em
ployees would ask for reassignment." If the
I Jniversity was dumbfounded it was not for
lack of signs or information since senior Stan
ford management. VanFossen and Faulkner
included, have been aware of all these con
cerns lor at least three months and have done
precious little to address them.
In fact, the Stanford (iuest I louse
has used temporary workers to cover
vacant full-time positions for longer
than a year and a half. Iliesc "long
term temps" (a category for temps
Residential & Dining Enterprises re
cently coined) in no way lit into the
model VanFossen described for
them."They are assigned temporari
ly to fill in during periods when jobs
are vacant, staff are sick or on vaca
tion, or during peak periods when ad
ditional staff arc needed on a short
term or interim basis." Former front
desk agents Al Atienza and Kerr>
Stroud, who both resigned, arc per
fect examples having been long-term
temps for 15 months and 11 months,
respectively. If the University takes a
year or longer to repost and hire for
vacant positions, as it has at the (iuest
House, it deserves a reputation for
misusing temporary employees.
Another contributing factor on
the road to resignation was the retire
ment of the hotel computer system in
April 2006 that left the Stanford
(iuest House without an automated
way of booking rooms, selling gilt
shop items.generating housekeeping
reports and other basic daily tasks ol
runninc a hotel. Workers were told a

new software system would be in
stalled within the week and yet today.
10 months later, it has yet to happen
- leading to a substantial increase in
workload. The manual system that
has been cobbled together uses ar
chaic carbon copies of credit cards,
manual blockingof guests into rooms
using spreadsheets and paper copies
of all guest bills to be stored and rec
onciled daily by front desk staff. Now
add on additional housekeeping as
signment responsibility, new cash
drawer counting, credit card recon
ciliation and monthly sales tax com
putations that were all handled by
the prior software and one begins to
get a picture of the increased work
load the skilled long-term temps
have been undertaking. Skills not
represented in the new I A 2 job de
scriptions that pa\ 25% less than the
old. more accurate lA4 postings. An
other deficit of the manual system is
a much higher error rate, leading to
guests being assigned occupied
rooms, an embarrassing situation in
deed demanding deft customer serv
ice skills to avoid an incident. Stan
lord's inability to purchase an off
-1 he-she 11 hotel program in 10 months
points to another management fail
ure. further frustrating front desk
staff.
Stanford University, and Resi
dent ia l & Dining Enterprises in par
ticular. seems to have two sets of
rules, one for management and one
for everyone else. I should like to see

those who have defended (his pay
cut live localh on a a year
salary. Two of the defenders of this
pay cut won't have to as both enjoy
subsidized living on-eampus that is
unavailable to normal workers, and
have even received a special excep
tion to have dogs, again unavailable
to normal residents of campus. It is
very easy to speak in broad terms
about the outside market forces and
what a competitive wage is when
one is not personally subject to such
forces or rules. I once believed that
Stanford treated its employees dif
ferently. that it would not stoop to
the minimum the law allows, or the
minimum the market will bare. If
Stanford wishes to maintain its rep
utation as a preferred employer and
desirable place to work it will have
to change many of its management
and personnel policies â€” and
c) uickly.
(liven these previously imprinted
factors about conditions at the Guest
I louse, the resignations of late Janu
ary may seem less sudden and more
foreseeable. It is my hope Stanford
will take this as an opportunity, not to
stay the course and pretend all is
weil. but to meaningfully investigate
its own policies and managers to im
prove working conditions and wages
for those that still work at the Guest
I louse and the I Jniversity as a whole.
