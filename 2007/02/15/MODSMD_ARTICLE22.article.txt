## A 						Seat in the Lecture Hall: Increasing Socioeconomic Diversity in Higher Education from the Ground 
### DANNY BLISS TRACY STEELE 
Iliis past ()etober, hundreds of students, ed
ucators and university administrators eon
verged at Yale for a series of lectures and dis
cussions addressing one of the most flagrant
manifestations of inequity in America today:
the lack of socioeconomic diversity on our
nation's university and college campuses.
lhe numbers speak for themselves. Ac
cording to former Princeton President
William Bowen. if American families are di
vided into quartiles hy income, 75% of stu
dents at the nation's 146 most selective insti
tutions of higher education hail from the top
quarlile; while a mere 3% are from the bot
tom.
Put quite simply, the average American
college student is 25 times more likely to be
"rich" than "poor."
lhe causes of this staggering statistic are
complex. We do know, however, that low in
come students have the least qualified teach
ers throughout their educational careers. For
example, in California alone, more than a
quarter of teachers at schools that have the

highest population of low income students
— those in which more than 75% of their
students qualify for free or reduced lunch —
lack full teaching credentials, 'lhe conse
quences of this situation are clear: According
to recent research by nationally renowned
Stanford Education Prof. Linda Darling-
I lammond, "Among the strongest predictors
of student failure on the state tests were the
proportion of uncertified teachers and a
measure of teacher shortage."
Admissions and financial aid policies
such as need-blind admissions,graduated tu
ition adjustments based on family income
and affirmative action — some of which
have become standard at our nation's most
selective universities — serve only as Band-
Aids to this problem.The overwhelming con
clusion of the attendees to the Yale confer
ence was that these measures are all in vain
unless we can make significant progress in
improving the first 13 years of education ex
perienced by their intended beneficiaries.
More concisely, as Century Foundation Fel
low Richard Kahlenberg stated."We cannot
increase socioeconomic diversity in higher

education in this country without increasing
the quality of K-12 education in our most so
eioeeonomieally impoverished neighbor
hoods and cities."
Placing our focus and collective efforts to
ward the preparation and retention of highly
qualified teachers to work in our neediest
schools ensures a more sustainable solution.
We must focus on better preparing a great
many students for college, rather than on cre
ating incentives for a select few.
Unfortunately, the unequal distribution
of well-qualified teachers has worsened since
the 19905. Improvements in K-12 public edu
cation through recent legislation such as No
Child Left Behind take important steps in
the right direction by holding all students, re
gardless of socioeconomic status, account
able for high levels of academic achievement
and requiring that all students have access to
fully certified teachers. However, these new
laws have been established without proper
support, and have not yet achieved signifi
cant results. Case in point: By the end of the
last school year, all 50 states were required to
have highly qualified teachers in core aca

demic subject areas. Not a single state man
aged to fulfill this requirement.
In order to bring our most troubled
schools up to speed, we must provide incen
tives for the most qualified, energetic, and
passionate teachers to work in them. Iliis, of
course, is a daunting task because the schools
most in need of qualified teachers usually
lack the administrative and financial re
sources to compete for and retain these
teachers. One possible incentive that could
be offered to attract top teachers to strug
gling schools is that of educational loan for
giveness. through federal programs like Pell
(irants. Federal Pell (Jrants not only provide
funding to undergraduates with financial
need, but can also be put toward easing the fi
nancial burden imposed upon graduates of
top teacher certification programs who want
to work in schools that are struggling
Pell Cirant increases are already being dis
cussed at the federal level. In October 2006.
then-House Minority I eader Nancy Pelosi
spoke at Georgetown, pledging to restore
Pell Grant funding— which the current ad
ministration cut In $12.5 billion this fiscal

year — to previous levels should the Democ
rats retake the House of Representatives.
Last week. President Bush and the Depart
ment of Education proposed an increase in
Pell Grant funding for the 200 X fiscal year.
'Ilie joint effort of top universities and the
federal government is required to assure an
increase of socioeconomic diversity at col
leges nationwide. Some top universities have
also created internal initiatives to address
this issue through support of K-12 education.
A perfect example of such an effort is the re
cently announced Stanford Challenge, in
which Stanford President John Henness\
pledged $125 million to improving K-12 edu
cation. We must apply continued pressure on
our University officials, the president's ad
ministration, and Congress to increase Pell
Grant funding and other initiatives. Ihe fu
ture equity of society depends on it.
