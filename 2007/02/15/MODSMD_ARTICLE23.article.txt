### KELLY GLEISCHMAN 
Stanford Mock Trial competed in
the Pacific Northwest Regional
Tournament last weekend, coming
home with three individual awards
and one second place trophy.
The group sent three teams to the
tournament — which was held at the
University of Oregon in Eugene —
and the squad that placed second fin
ished high enough to earn a bid to the
national championships, to be held in
Florida this April.

Twenty-two teams, including
squads from UC-Berkeley and Gon
zaga University, participated in hist
weekend's contest. A team from Cal
won the tournament and will accom
pany the runner-up Stanford team to
this spring's nationals.
The team's leaders were pleased
with the squad's performance.
"We have a great program this
year, and I was really pleased overall
with how everyone did at the tourna
ment." said Betsy Walls '08. a team
captain.
The group is young this year; in
fact, one of the three Stanford teams
at the regional tournament consisted
entirely of freshmen and sopho
mores. and the other two squads had
only two upperclassmen each.

Mock 11 ial president John Fowler
'07 cited the team's youth as a mark
of future success for the team.
"We have a young team which is
great for the future," he said.
Walls said she was thrilled to be
sending a team to Florida, but also
said she was happy to see all the
teams remain competitive.
"We were really excited to take
second because that means we get a
bid to the national championships,"
she said. "We always prefer to have
all of our teams place in the top but I
think all of the teams felt that they
had performed well."
In addition to the team awards,
three team members earned individ
ual accolades in Fugcne. Fowler
walked awav with an All-Region At

torney nod. while Vicky Degtyareva
'08 (a columnist for 'ITie Daily) and
Chibuzo Eke '09 were awarded All-
Region Witness honors.
Mock Trial participants cited the
importance of flexibility in determin
ing a team's success.
"I'd say my goal was to learn to do
something new and learn how to
manage something that 1 wasn't used
to."said Monica Mueller *09. Mueller
switched from being a lawyer to play
ing a witness.
The National Championships will
be held at Stetson University Law
School in St. Petersberg. Fla. on Apr.
13-15.
