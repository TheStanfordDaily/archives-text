W. Bush.
While he still must be confirmed by the U.S.
Senate, the adviser to the Stanford College Repub

cation.
Colleagues were quick to praise the education
policy wonk. who has served as a member of the
KoretTask Force on K-12 education and worked at
The Daily as an undergraduate.
Hoover Director John Raisian called Evers a
"walking encyclopedia of knowledge associated
with the K-12 education system in the United
States."
"Because of Bill's expanse of knowledge and
keen interest and analytical skills" Raisian wrote
in an email to Hie Daily, "the De
partment of Education has recruited
a terrific resource for articulating
and designing education policy for
the remainder of the [Bush] Admin
istration."
Hie announcement was made on
Feb. 8/llie timetable for moving into
the new job is unclear. I-'vers de
clined to comment for this story, cit
ing ci White I louse policy that forbids
unconfirmed nominees from speak
ing with the news media.
"It is gratifying to see that the U.S.
Department of Education is reach
ing out to such highly qualified peo
ple to serve in the policy process."
said Hoover Fellow I ric Hanushek,
who has served with livers on the
Koret Task Force since 1999. "Im
proving our schools is critical to the
nation,and it cannot happen without

strong and enlightened leadership."
If, as expected. I•'.vers is eon
firmed, he will become the Depart
ment of 1 '.ducat ion's Assistant Secre
tary for the ()lTiee ol Planning, I val
uation and Policy Development
(Ol'l PD). According to the depart
ment's job description, this ap
pointee "serves as the principal ad
viser to the Secretary [of Education J
on all matters relating to policy de
velopment and review; performance
measurement and evaluation: budg
et processes and proposals."
Ilanushck said that I vers' nomi
nation is particularly tiinel\ because
Congress is currently debating the
re-authorization of the No ('hild
Left Behind Act (NCI II).
"Bill I 7 .vers has especially deep
knowledge about educational stan
dards and testing and has been in
volved in the development of these
in a variety of states across the na
tion, including California."
Ilanushck said. " Ibis first-hand ex
perience with the programs of dif
ferent states is critical because

NCI II relies upon the standards
and accountability systems of each
state."
When he starts his new job.he will
take a leave ol absence from
I loover.
Members ol the Santa Clara
County Hoard ol Iducation praised
I vers lor his passion for — and ded
ication to — public education.
"Hill has a great passion for cur
riculum and for ensuring that stu
dents meet standards," said Palo
Alto Superintendent Mary I ranees
( allan. "Whether as a parent or as a
member on the county board, he has
always ensured that we received in
formation regarding curriculum and
educational trends."
Mandy I owcll. a member of the
Santa Clara Count) Hoard, noted
that I • vers has worked hard at local
and state levels to set curriculum
content standards that help children
learn and to provide parents with in
formation about the quality of edu
cation.
"Hill works to make sure that all

kids, whether they are from an afflu
ent family or an impoverished one
or whether they are Inglish lan
guage learners |or fluent 1 -nglisl:
speakers], can learn to read, write
and solve problems in elementary
school and [thus] have the opportu
nity to go on to college." she said.
The U.S. Department of I 'ducatioi
deputy press secretary said liver
will likely assume his duties shortly
after confirmation.
Ilanushek said he hopes I ver?
will encourage the Department o
I ducation to rely more heavily 01
evidence when developing policy.
"I Jntil recently, policy discussion"
have involved surprisingly little re
search evidence." Ilanushek said
"|Hill l ivers] has a real appreciatioi
for the importance of research aiu
evaluation in designing programs
and I expect him to be a forceful ad
vocate for greater reliance on higl
quality evidence."
