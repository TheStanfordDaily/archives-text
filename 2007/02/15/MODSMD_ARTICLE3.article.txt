# Women eye Oregon sweeps
## Wiggins likely to sit out tonight, questionable on Saturday 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 9 Stanford women's basketball team
liiis its eves set on another sweep of the Oregon
schools this weekend for its final road trip of the
regular season. However, more eyes may be on
the return of junior guard Candice Wiggins.
Wiggins had just crossed the 1.700-point mark
in her23-point performance against Washington
Iliis past Saturday when she came down into traf
fic after a layup. A sprained right ankle was the
diagnosis, later confirmed by X-ray with no sign
of a fracture.
"We were pleasantly surprised [on Monday]

that it wasn't as swollen as on Saturday," associ
ate head coach Amy Tucker said. "The X-ray was
negative, which was great news, but at this point,
our sense is that she'll be doubtful for Thursday,
and we'll go on a day-bv-day [check on the
swelling]."
Wiggins' appearance against Oregon State (X
--15,3-11 Pacific-10 Conference) tonight may be
doubtful, but Tucker noted the team will "wait
and see" about an appearance on Saturday
against Oregon (14-10, 6-8). Wiggins was de
scribed as "questionable."
"It's not painful, and she thinks she's ready to

The Cardinal responded strongly
in the second half, retaking the lead
with a frenetic 20-6 run in the first six
minutes. Stanford also overcame the
Beavers' 22-21 rebounding lead, and
kept them to just six boards com
