## Men emerge to claim paternity of Smith baby 
### LINDA DEUTSCH ASSOCIATED PRESS 
I.OSANGI I I S Men are lin
ing up to claim they are the father of
\nna Nicole Smith's baby. But they
could be mistaken if they think pa
ternity will automatically mean a pot
ot gold.
Instead, they could be stepping
into a monumentally complex, multi
national legal fight over the child.
Moreover, it is not at all clear
whether the little girl is a million-dol
lat baby, as some seem to think.
l or all anyone knows, the volup
tuous former centerfold, who died at
age 39 last week under mysterious
circumstances, may have set up a
11 nst or employed some other means
ol keeping the father of her baby
from getting his hands on her for
tune.
Wayne Munroe,an attorney rep
t senting Smith's estate in the Ba
hamas. hinted at just that, suggest
ing there may be provisions in her
\ ill that could undermine any great
expectations among potential fa
thers.
" Ihe\ may think that you get a
l Hiding and a court order and you get
to live on the child's money," said
Munroe, who has access to Smith's
will. "But they are in for a rude awak
ening."
'They're going to find out this
woman was much smarter than they
thought," he said. "'l"hey will only
have the responsibility for maintain
ing this child."
Hie question of how much money
the child might stand to inherit re
mains murky. Smith was involved in a
decade-long legal battle over the es
tate of her late husband, oil tycoon J.
I loward Marshall 11.
Smith initially won a $474 million
judgment, but it was thrown out on
appeal. However, the U.S. Supreme
Court said the former Playboy cen
terfold deserves another day in
court. I lie case is still pending.

Smith also made money from a
TV reality show and as a spokes
woman for the diet supplement
Irimspa. She borrowed money to
buy a $ l )(M).0(H) mansion in the Ba
hamas and she was left with large
legal debts involving the drug-relat
ed death of her son. Daniel.
"It's a very, very confused case,"
said Beverly Hills family law attor
ney Alexandra Leichter. "Whoever
is going to claim to be the father had
better get a good lawyer in the Ba
hamas."
Iliat's where little Dannielynn.
Smith's 5-month-old daughter, is liv
ing with Howard K. Stern, who is list
ed as her father on her birth certifi
cate and is the executor of Smith's
will
Stern, Smith's boyfriend, is among
at least three men who are claiming
to be the father.The others are pho
tojournalist Larry Birkhead. who has
filed a paternity claim in I.os Ange
les. and Prince Frederic von Anhalt,
the husband of Zsa Zsa Gabor. He
claims he carried on a decade-long
affair with Smith. (A former Smith
bodyguard has also said he, too. had
an affair with Smith, and may be the
baby's father.)
Birkhead is pressing for DNA
testing of the baby and Smith's body
to establish who is Dannielynn's fa
ther, and the results would almost
certainly settle the question. But the
matter is tied up in court.
Normally, there is no need for
DNA testing on the mother in a pa
ternity case. But tensions and suspi
cions are running so high that Birk
head asked for genetic material from
Smith to guard against a baby switeh.
A Bahamian judge has issued an
injunction preventing the baby from
being taken out of the country until
the custody case is resolved. Smith's
mother. Vergie Arthur, is also vying
to be appointed guardian of the girl.
With two states — California and
Florida — and two countries in
volved in the legal fray.
