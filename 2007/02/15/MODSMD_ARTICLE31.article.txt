## Americans embrace specialty chocolates On Valentine's Day, pricey candy popular 
### LISA LEFF ASSOCIATED PRESS 
HI RKELEY, Calit Ameri
cans' love of chocolate has become
a dark and bittersweet affair, and it
took a former vintner to make it so.
John Scharffenberger and
Robert Steinberg launched the first
U.S. chocolate manufacturing com
pany in half a century, drawing
heavily on Scharffenberger's re
fined palate and his past as a maker
of sparkling wines.
Together, they set out to do for
dark chocolate what fellow Cali
fornia n Robert Mondavi had done
for wine — demystify, democratize
and domesticate it.
Call it kismet, uncanny timing or
creative chemistry, but in the 11
years since co-founding Scharffen
Berger ( hocolate Maker they have
watched the public's appetite for
gourmet chocolate expand from a
Valentine's Day extravagance to an
everyday indulgence.

"We've gone through a food
revolution in this country." said
Scharffenberger. Just as Americans
have become more sophisticated
about wine, whole-bean coffee, ar
tisan cheeses and other products
that once were the luxury of certi
fied foodies have been main
streamed to the masses.
"The one thing that remained to
be done was chocolate, and that's
what we hit on," Scharffenberger
said.
1 .ike the label of a fine wine, the
wrapper on a Scharffen Berger
chocolate tells you exactly what's
inside. It was the first U.S. choco
latier to feature the cacao count
prominently on its wrappers — the
higher the number, the darker and
more bitter the chocolate. And the
source of the beans is also noted,
for those who like knowing
whether their chocolate got its start
in Madagascar. Ecuador, Ghana or
Peru.
Scharffen Berger bars now are
prominently displayed in the
checkout lines of grocers like Trad
er Joe's, Andronico's and Whole
Foods.

Yet venerable players like
Reading, Pa.-based Godiva Choco
latier Inc., part of The Campbell
Soup Co., and Ghirardelli Choco
late Co., now headquartered in San
Leandro, jump-started the trend,
said Marcia Mogelonsky.an analyst
with the market research firm
Mintel International. They popu
larized fancy chocolates with up
scale, single-serving packaging,
wider distribution and savvy mar
keting. she said.
Even The Hershey Co.. the
name synonymous with American
chocolate, has invested heavily in
premium chocolate, showing it is
more than a fad, she said. Besides
buying Scharffen Berger 1 1/2 years
ago. the company has introduced its
own line of premium chocolate
bars and late last year purchased
Ashland, Ore.-based Dagoba Or
ganic Chocolate.
Between 2003 and 2005, U.S.
sales of premium chocolates went
from $ 1.4 billion to $1,7 l > billion,ac
cording to Mogelonsky. While it
still represents only a fraction of
the overall $15.7 billion chocolate
market, the growth rate for the

good stuff has been much faster —
28 percent over the three-year peri
od compared to annual rates of 2 to
3 percent for the industry as a
whole.
"People were ready for a
change," said Mogelonsky. She re
lates the trend to Americans' grow
ing self-indulgence.
"1 can't afford a mink and a dia
mond, but I can afford a piece of re
ally good chocolate," she said.
As with wine and coffee, the ori
gin of premium chocolate has in
creasingly become a selling point.
And consumers have also respond
ed to manufacturers' efforts to tout
their relationships with growers in
the developing countries where
cacao typically comes from.she said.
The quality and quantity of
cacao in a bar or bonbon is what
distinguishes fine chocolate from
the coating on a Snicker's, accord
ing to Scharffenberger, who per
sonally oversees the blending of 30
varieties of beans that go into the
company's products and visits the
ranches in Guatemala, Madagascar
and other countries where it se
cures supplies.
