# What is a nonprofit organization?
## "Legally, a nonprofit organization is one that does not declare a profit and instead utilizes all revenue after normal operating expenses in service to the public interest." 
### 
So you have heard the term
before, but do you really know
what a nonprofit organization
is? There are legal definitions,
including more than 25 types of non
profits recognized by the IRS, and
there are common perceptions of
what people mean when they refer
to an organization as nonprofit.
Let's start with perceptions.
Charities and other tax-exempt
organizations are what most people
think of when referring to a non
profit. These nonprofit organiza
tions must serve the public interest.
The purpose of this type of organi
zation must be charitable, educa
tional. scientific, religious or liter
ary. The public expects to be able to
make donations to these organiza
tions and deduct those donations
from their federal taxes.
Legally, a nonprofit organization
is one that does not declare a profit
and instead utilizes all revenue
available after normal operating
expenses in service to the public
interest. These organizations can be
unincorporated or incorporated. An
unincorporated nonprofit cannot be
given federal tax-exempt status or
the designation of being a 501(c)(3)
organization as defined by the
Internal Revenue Service. Churches
meeting IRS standards are automat
ically designated as 501 (c)(3) orga
nizations. When a nonprofit organi
zation is incorporated, it shares
many traits with for-profit corpora

tions except that there are no share
holders.
When starting a nonprofit corpo
ration, the organization must file
articles of incorporation with the
state in which it resides or decides
will be its jurisdiction for legal pur
poses. This is the same process a for
profit corporation must follow. Each
state has various rules and regula
tions, but most require officers of
the corporation, a board of direc
tors, by-laws and annual meetings.
Most states also require nonprofit
organizations to register with state
charity bureaus or other agencies
and adhere to reporting require
ments particularly involving
fundraising operations.
When a nonprofit corporation
applies to the IRS and is given tax
exempt status, it is exempt from pay
ing federal corporate income tax.
The only exception is that it may be
subject to unrelated business income
tax from activities that are unrelated
to its mission. While these types of
organizations also are often exempt

from paying state and local sales tax,
property tax and taxes on other
assets, this is not always the case as
states have different rules. Tax
exempt nonprofits also can benefit
from lower postal rates and can qual
ify for grants.
Nonprofit organizations have
paid and volunteer staff, but
employment taxes and federal and
state workplace rules are generally
no different than those imposed on
for-profit organizations. A percep
tion is that salaries in the nonprofit
world are low and while this is gen
erally true, the type of nonprofit
organization can make a huge differ
ence in how closely it compares to a
for-profit business.
Universities, hospitals and large
national charities are examples of
organizations that can be "nonprof
it" but have salary scales on par with
almost any for-profit corporation.
CEOs of major hospitals commonly
can earn salaries and bonuses of
$5()0,()()() to over SI. ()()(),()()().
University presidents enjoy similar

pay scales. However, local literacy
training centers or food banks gen
erally will be places where lower
salaries are supplemented by pay
ment in a smile from an adult who
reads a first book or a family with
enough food for everyone to eat a
meal.
A nonprofit organization can
have clients, can offer products and
services, will need revenue, should
market itself, and must be con
cerned about customer satisfaction
whether in those they assist or those
who contribute donations in sup
port of operations, programs or ser
vices. It is a business that must serve
the public interest and it will suc
ceed or fail as any business will,
depending on how well it is operat
ed.
