# TOP FIVE TO WATCH
## 
### 
1. Where's Wiggins?
Junior guard Candice Wiggins suffered a right
ankle sprain against Washington last Saturday. In
32 minutes of play, Wiggins scored 23 points, so
her presence will be especially missed in light of
freshman guard JJ Hones being sidelined for the
season. Wiggins is doubtful for play tonight, but she
will be on standby for Saturday's game.
2. More Murphy
With Wiggins out, freshman point guard Melanie
Murphy took charge of the Cardinal. In eight minutes
of play against the Huskies, she had 1 1 points and
eight assists, showing that she is ready to step up for
an injury-plagued Stanford.
3. Crafty Beavers
Oregon State fought hard in its first half against the
Cardinal on Jan. 20, garnering an 1 1 -point lead

into halftime. Although Stanford went on a 20-6 run
at the start of the second half, and finished with a 69-
55 win, the game showed the Cardinal's lack of ag
gression in what would have been an otherwise easy
win.
4. Drowning the Ducks
In the first half of its 70-48 routing of Oregon, Stan
ford held the Ducks to just 1 9.4 percent field-goal
shooting. The Cardinal capitalized to build a 31 -12
lead by halftime. Oregon averages 42.9 percent
field-goal shooting for the season.
5. Boarding School
In their last meeting, Stanford had a season-high 55
rebounds to Oregon's 37; the Cardinal also went
47-27 total and 26-6 in the second half against the
Beavers last time out. The performances are typical
of Stanford (the team averages 44.3 boards per
game for a +7 .6 margin), so another clinic could be
seen at the Oregon schools this weekend.
