# Exploring a Career in the nonprofit sector
## 
### Sam Rodriguez, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT CENTER 
So why choose a career in the nonprofit sector? It could be
a career path to actualize your values of addressing social
issues and causes, or following your passion to make a dif
lerence in the world. It also provides opportunities to learn,
acquire substantive responsibility quickly, assume leadership
roles, and make an immediate impact on the community with
which you work. Working in the nonprofit sector is also a way
to obtain work experience for a year or two prior to enrolling
in graduate school. Consider doing a year of service with
Teach for America or Americorps.
What you need to know about exploring a career in the
nonprofit sector. Nonprofit organizations are mission driven.
They are organized around a cause or issue, and employees
are very committed to their mission. Nonprofits have limited
resources and depend on annual fundraising to meet their
goals. Salaries are low initially, but as you grow in your posi
tion, such as leadership and management roles, the salary
increases over time. After acquiring experience, many find
opportunities with larger nonprofits where the pay scale may
be higher. There is less competition among organizations,
even though they may compete for similar funding sources. It
is common for nonprofits to partner with other organizations
to address a particular need or issue. Multiple stakeholders
are committed to making a nonprofit accountable to their mis
sion. Constituents typically include a specific community,
clients, board members, staff members, and in some cases gov
ernmental agencies.

There are two career tracks one can pursue. The direct ser
vice track offers opportunities to work directly with clients in
areas such as counseling, education, and training. The admin
istrative/management track provides opportunities to manage
nonprofit operations such as fundraising, strategic planning,
grant-making, and managing staff. In some organizations,
there is an additional track that involves policy analysis,
researching and lobbying.
Dispelling Myths:
Some myths associated with nonprofit work include that it's
work only for liberals. Although many liberals may find their
passion in the nonprofit sector, other organizations such as
professional associations, foundations, and service organiza
tions attract people from a wide-range of political, religious,
and social beliefs.
Another myth is that if you love volunteering; why not pur
sue a career in nonprofit work. Earning a reasonable income
doing the work you love or feel passionate about is essential.
You do not have to make a vow of poverty, although some may
choose to do so, to house the homeless, feed the hungry, heal
the sick, or bridge the digital divide in low-income communities.
In 2001, the nonprofit sector reported over $822 billion in
expenditures and over $1.5 trillion in assets. The largest sub
sectors are human services and education. So the nonprofit sec
tor is a very robust field. Compared to other sectors, the U. S.
Department of Labor reports that the nonprofit sector repre
sents 9% or 12 million out of 130 million total employees in the
U. S. workforce.
When the economy does well money trickles down to non
profit and charitable organizations, and graduating students

have many employment options to consider. When the econo
my is weak, it gives rise to other economic, political and social
issues that need to be addressed by caring individuals and
groups. Some nonprofits close their doors for lack of diversi
fied funding sources. It's an ongoing struggle to find funding
sources to sustain their organization, but that does not stop
them from finding alternatives sources.
Another myth is that nonprofit work involves providing
direct services to clients. However, not all nonprofit organiza
tions offer direct services. Foundations, think tanks and pro
fessional associations are good examples of organizations
offering services in research, policy analysis and lobbying.
Next steps:
Meet with a career counselor at the CDC to take some assess
ments for interests, personality, values, skills, and goals.
Conduct informational interviews with alumni and others to
learn more about the work that interests you. The Stanford
Career Network database has a subsection called Stanford
Exchange in Public Service consisting of over 50 alumni work
ing in the public sector. The Shadow Program at the CDC con
nects you with a professional that allows you to spend either a
half-day or full day "shadowing" their work.
Intern, volunteer, or do a year of community service. This
is a great way to learn about jobs and organizations that are
aligned with your values. The Haas Center for Public Service
is an excellent resource to identify community based organiza
tions. If you have college work-study, you can use your finan
cial aid over the summer to work for a nonprofit organization.
Learn about nonprofit work through reading books and
articles in the Career Resource Center in the CDC.
