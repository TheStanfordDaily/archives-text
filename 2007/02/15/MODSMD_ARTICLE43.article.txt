# Myths and Realities of Nonprofit Work
## 
### 
Numerous myths relate to the nonprofit
sector. Unfortunately, many of these
myths dissuade job seekers from
exploring opportunities with nonprofit organi
zations. Ten myths in particular discourage
individuals from seeking job and career
opportunities with nonprofits:
Myth 1: Nonprofits offer few job opportu
nities
Reality: Employing nearly 10 million peo
ple, nonprofits serve as employers for nearly
8% of the American workforce. While many
nonprofits are very small and only employ one
or two full-time people, many other nonprofits
employ over 100 individuals. Many job seek
ers overlook nonprofits as sources for employ
ment not because they offer few job opportu
nities but simply because they know little
about these organizations and thus do not
automatically come up on their radar screens.
One of the major reasons they don't know
much about nonprofits is because they don't
fit neatly into standard thinking about a job
market being divided into business (private)
or government (public) organizations.
Nonprofits arc neither but sometimes they
may be both.
Myth 2: It's difficult to find information on
opportunities with nonprofit organizations.
Reality: In addition to this book, you will
find many useful printed resources on oppor
tunities with nonprofit organizations pub
lished by Barricade Books, Gale Research,
Macmillan. Planning/Communications and the
Taft Group. You'll also find a wealth of infor
mation on the Internet about individual non
profit organizations as well as job vacancies
with nonprofits. Within the past three years,
most nonprofits, including small ones in rural
areas, have created their own Web sites that
include information on their operations as
well as job listings. With the help of a few key
books and Web sites, the whole nonprofit
world will unfold before you in a matter of
hours. The biggest problem you will probably
face is the fact that you have too much infor
mation on nonprofits!
Myth 3: Nonprofits are primarily volunteer
organizations involved in charitable activities.

Reality: Many nonprofit organizations
depend on volunteers, hut many of these same
organizations have large full-time paid staffs.
It is inappropriate to stereotype nonprofit
organizations as charitable organizations
made up of volunteers. Nonprofits consist of a
wide range of different types of organizations,
from educational groups to foundations.
Volunteers play important roles in only some
types of nonprofit organizations.
Myth 4: Nonprofits lack good entrepre
neurial skills and a sense of productivity and
accountability. Like government employees,
they are used to drawing salaries unrelated to
performance.
Reality: By definition, nonprofits must be
entrepreneurial, productive and accountable.
Their funding operations require recruiting
members, acquiring donations, receiving
grants and operating profitable commercial
enterprises. Indeed, they must be entrepre
neurial in order to raise sufficient funds to sur
vive and grow. Like most government and
business operations, they work within annual
budgets. Similar to thriving businesses, non
profits must increasingly advertise their activi
ties and vigorously market their products and
services. However, nonprofit cntrepreneurism
differs from private sector cntrepreneurism.
Nonprofit cntrepreneurism disproportionate
ly centers on raising funds and recruiting
members. Nonprofits also must be productive
and accountable in relation to board members
who set policies, approve budgets and oversee
operations. Nonprofit productivity is mea
sured differently from business productivity.
Similar to government productivity, nonprofit
productivity is measured in reference to orga
nizational goals. Nonprofits are increasingly
under pressure to clearly state their missions
in terms of measurable goals as well as be
more and more accountable to their boards.
Myth 5: Nonprofit organizations are pri
marily located in the metropolitan areas of
Washington, DC, New York, Chicago and
Atlanta.
Reality: Many of the large nonprofits, which
are national and international in scope, are
headquartered in these major metropolitan
areas. The organizations have large full-time

staffs that offer excellent job opportunities
leading to career advancement within the non
profit sector. However, more than 90% of all
nonprofits operate at the local level as commu
nity-based organizations. While these groups
have smaller staffs and fewer positions than the
large nonprofits headquartered in major met
ropolitan areas, nonetheless, the local nonprof
its generate millions of job opportunities.
Myth 6: It's difficult to break into the non
profit world.
Reality: It is usually easier to enter this
employment arena than to find jobs in govern
ment or business. Many nonprofits offer entry
level volunteer and internship positions
through which individuals can acquire experi
ence and skills with nonprofit organizations.
Myth 7: Most nonprofits are liberal groups
that hire do-gooder, social-action types.
Reality: While many nonprofits attract
individuals with such political and social orien
tations — especially liberal social advocacy
groups — many other nonprofit organizations
attract conservatives and those who do not
have social action agendas. Nonprofits fall all
along the ideological spectrum, from liberal
environmental and abortion rights groups to
conservative religious right and pro-life
groups. Both types of groups attract individu
als who have a passion for taking action relat
ed to a particular social issue. Other groups,
such as professional associations, are relative
ly apolitical as they seek to promote the collec
tive interests of their members. Nonprofits
need public relations specialists, marketing
managers, accountants, fundraisers,
researchers, writers, communication special
ists, administrators and managers who have
the necessary skills to develop organizations
and maintain day-to-day operations.
Myth 8: Nonprofit jobs tend to be dead-end
jobs.
Reality: This is a huge employment arena
where many individuals develop long-term
careers and report high levels of satisfaction.
Career advancement often takes the track of
moving from small to larger nonprofit organi
zations that offer increasing responsibilities,
larger operating budgets and better salaries
and benefits.

Myth 9: Nonprofit organizations offer low
salaries and few benefits.
Reality: The level of pay and benefits can
vary widely, depending on the nature of the
nonprofit organization. It's true that many
nonprofit organizations, especially charitable
and social service organizations, offer low
paying jobs because of the volunteer nature of
the work and their shoestring budgets. But
many nonprofits, especially health groups,
research organizations, foundations, and busi
ness and professional associations, offer excel
lent salaries and benefits.
Myth 10: The best way to find a job with a
nonprofit organization is to respond to vacan
cy announcements in local newspapers and to
jobs listed on various Internet employment
sites and on the home pages.
Reality: Many positions are advertised in
local newspapers and professional journals, such
as Access's Community Jobs and the Journal of
Philanthropy, as well as on the Internet. Since
more and more nonprofits advertise jobs on the
Internet, you are well advised to visit their home
pages or regularly check several key employ
ment Web sites. Better still, visit several Web
sites that specialize in nonprofit job listings.
Many of these sites have search engines
that enable you to select your specialty field
and desired work location. However, not all
jobs appear through these print or electronic
sources. Many jobs also are found through
direct application or bv networking through
friends and acquaintances. For a comprehen
sive review of hundreds of international,
national, state and local job vacancy resources,
see the latest edition of Dan Lauber's The
Nonprofits and Education Job Finder
(Planning/Communications).

hours. The biggest problem you will probably
face is the fact that you have too much infor
mation on nonprofits!
Myth 3: Nonprofits are primarily volunteer
organizations involved in charitable activities.

Reality: Many nonprofit organizations
depend on volunteers, hut many of these same
organizations have large full-time paid staffs.
It is inappropriate to stereotype nonprofit
organizations as charitable organizations
made up of volunteers. Nonprofits consist of a
wide range of different types of organizations,
from educational groups to foundations.
Volunteers play important roles in only some
types of nonprofit organizations.
Myth 4: Nonprofits lack good entrepre
neurial skills and a sense of productivity and
accountability. Like government employees,
they are used to drawing salaries unrelated to
performance.
Reality: By definition, nonprofits must be
entrepreneurial, productive and accountable.
Their funding operations require recruiting
members, acquiring donations, receiving
grants and operating profitable commercial
enterprises. Indeed, they must be entrepre
neurial in order to raise sufficient funds to sur
vive and grow. Like most government and
business operations, they work within annual
budgets. Similar to thriving businesses, non
profits must increasingly advertise their activi
ties and vigorously market their products and
services. However, nonprofit cntrepreneurism
differs from private sector cntrepreneurism.
Nonprofit cntrepreneurism disproportionate
ly centers on raising funds and recruiting
members. Nonprofits also must be productive
and accountable in relation to board members
who set policies, approve budgets and oversee
operations. Nonprofit productivity is mea
sured differently from business productivity.
Similar to government productivity, nonprofit
productivity is measured in reference to orga
nizational goals. Nonprofits are increasingly
under pressure to clearly state their missions
in terms of measurable goals as well as be
more and more accountable to their boards.
Myth 5: Nonprofit organizations are pri
marily located in the metropolitan areas of
Washington, DC, New York, Chicago and
Atlanta.
Reality: Many of the large nonprofits, which
are national and international in scope, are
headquartered in these major metropolitan
areas. The organizations have large full-time

staffs that offer excellent job opportunities
leading to career advancement within the non
profit sector. However, more than 90% of all
nonprofits operate at the local level as commu
nity-based organizations. While these groups
have smaller staffs and fewer positions than the
large nonprofits headquartered in major met
ropolitan areas, nonetheless, the local nonprof
its generate millions of job opportunities.
Myth 6: It's difficult to break into the non
profit world.
Reality: It is usually easier to enter this
employment arena than to find jobs in govern
ment or business. Many nonprofits offer entry
level volunteer and internship positions
through which individuals can acquire experi
ence and skills with nonprofit organizations.
Myth 7: Most nonprofits are liberal groups
that hire do-gooder, social-action types.
Reality: While many nonprofits attract
individuals with such political and social orien
tations — especially liberal social advocacy
groups — many other nonprofit organizations
attract conservatives and those who do not
have social action agendas. Nonprofits fall all
along the ideological spectrum, from liberal
environmental and abortion rights groups to
conservative religious right and pro-life
groups. Both types of groups attract individu
als who have a passion for taking action relat
ed to a particular social issue. Other groups,
such as professional associations, are relative
ly apolitical as they seek to promote the collec
tive interests of their members. Nonprofits
need public relations specialists, marketing
managers, accountants, fundraisers,
researchers, writers, communication special
ists, administrators and managers who have
the necessary skills to develop organizations
and maintain day-to-day operations.
Myth 8: Nonprofit jobs tend to be dead-end
jobs.
Reality: This is a huge employment arena
where many individuals develop long-term
careers and report high levels of satisfaction.
Career advancement often takes the track of
moving from small to larger nonprofit organi
zations that offer increasing responsibilities,
larger operating budgets and better salaries
and benefits.

Myth 9: Nonprofit organizations offer low
salaries and few benefits.
Reality: The level of pay and benefits can
vary widely, depending on the nature of the
nonprofit organization. It's true that many
nonprofit organizations, especially charitable
and social service organizations, offer low
paying jobs because of the volunteer nature of
the work and their shoestring budgets. But
many nonprofits, especially health groups,
research organizations, foundations, and busi
ness and professional associations, offer excel
lent salaries and benefits.
Myth 10: The best way to find a job with a
nonprofit organization is to respond to vacan
cy announcements in local newspapers and to
jobs listed on various Internet employment
sites and on the home pages.
Reality: Many positions are advertised in
local newspapers and professional journals, such
as Access's Community Jobs and the Journal of
Philanthropy, as well as on the Internet. Since
more and more nonprofits advertise jobs on the
Internet, you are well advised to visit their home
pages or regularly check several key employ
ment Web sites. Better still, visit several Web
sites that specialize in nonprofit job listings.
Many of these sites have search engines
that enable you to select your specialty field
and desired work location. However, not all
jobs appear through these print or electronic
sources. Many jobs also are found through
direct application or bv networking through
friends and acquaintances. For a comprehen
sive review of hundreds of international,
national, state and local job vacancy resources,
see the latest edition of Dan Lauber's The
Nonprofits and Education Job Finder
(Planning/Communications).

Numerous myths relate to the nonprofit
sector. Unfortunately, many of these
myths dissuade job seekers from
exploring opportunities with nonprofit organi
zations. Ten myths in particular discourage
individuals from seeking job and career
opportunities with nonprofits:
Myth 1: Nonprofits offer few job opportu
nities
Reality: Employing nearly 10 million peo
ple, nonprofits serve as employers for nearly
8% of the American workforce. While many
nonprofits are very small and only employ one
or two full-time people, many other nonprofits
employ over 100 individuals. Many job seek
ers overlook nonprofits as sources for employ
ment not because they offer few job opportu
nities but simply because they know little
about these organizations and thus do not
automatically come up on their radar screens.
One of the major reasons they don't know
much about nonprofits is because they don't
fit neatly into standard thinking about a job
market being divided into business (private)
or government (public) organizations.
Nonprofits arc neither but sometimes they
may be both.
Myth 2: It's difficult to find information on
opportunities with nonprofit organizations.
Reality: In addition to this book, you will
find many useful printed resources on oppor
tunities with nonprofit organizations pub
lished by Barricade Books, Gale Research,
Macmillan. Planning/Communications and the
Taft Group. You'll also find a wealth of infor
mation on the Internet about individual non
profit organizations as well as job vacancies
with nonprofits. Within the past three years,
most nonprofits, including small ones in rural
areas, have created their own Web sites that
include information on their operations as
well as job listings. With the help of a few key
books and Web sites, the whole nonprofit
world will unfold before you in a matter of
hours. The biggest problem you will probably
face is the fact that you have too much infor
