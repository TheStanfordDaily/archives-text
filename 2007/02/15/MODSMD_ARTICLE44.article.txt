# Mapping out your future
## 
### Chaz Kyser 
As a beginning freshman you may have worked with a counselor on
what is commonly called a degree plan. This plan stated the degree
you are trying to achieve, outlined the classes needed to receive that
degree, and then gave you a time line indicating how long it will take before
you can don a cap and gown.
Before you graduate, you will need to create a new plan. This plan will
map out what will hopefully be an exciting and rewarding career, thus we'll
call it your Career Plan.
Besides mapping out your future, your Career Plan will also help keep
you focused. Sometimes we forget exactly what our goals are and the rea
sons why we chose these goals. Having something written down can reas
sure us that we're heading in the right direction, and remind us why we're
working so hard.
1 he C areer Plan you make lor yourself should answer four basic questions:
1. What are my career goals?
2. Why have I set these goals?
3. How will I achieve these goals?
4. When should I reasonably be able to achieve these goals?
What are my career goals?
I his part of your plan will state the goal(s) you want to reach in your
career. This can be as simple as stating what title you want to hold, such as
an African-American history professor, or an accountant for one of the
nation's leading accounting firms.
It you have two very different career goals, like you want to be a public
relations director and a clothing designer, then you would need to make a
C areer Plan for both goals. It's okay if you're unsure about exactly what
position you hope to hold, but know what field you want to work in. For
example, instead of writing that you want to be a dentist, you could put that
you want to work in dentistry. 1 lowever, the more specific vou are the more
helpful your Career Plan will be.
Why have I set these goals?
I'his part of your plan will explain why you've set your stated career goals.
The explanation should be straightforward. For example:
I am going to be an African-American history professor because
(1)1 love sharing knowledge about African-American history,
(2) professors get paid well, are respected, have a high level of autono
my, and a flexible work schedule,
(3) I want to work in academia,
(4) I know I'll be a great professor.
How will I achieve these goals?
I his part ol the plan explains what you have to accomplish to achieve
your goal(s) step-by-step. Research on your desired profession may be
needed to fill this section out. II you wanted to be a college professor, for
example, then talking to your former professors and researching various
graduate programs would be desirable.
Once you've done your research you should be able to write out a gen
eral path you have to follow. For example, you might write:
In order to be an African-American history professor I have to:
1. Attend school full-time to receive my Master's in History.
2. Attend school full-time to receive my Ph.D. in African-American
Studies.
—Become noted for my own research and work in the field.
—Network with other professors, especially at schools with
an African-American Studies department.
3. Work on my dissertation.
4. Receive my Ph.D. and then apply for a full-time teaching position
within a university that has a respected African-American Studies
department.
When should I reasonably be able to achieve these goals?
The biggest question is almost always "when?" Answering the when
question will help keep you on track once you decide what you're focused
on becoming. Ihe word "reasonably' is inserted into that question so that
you II set a realistic time line. Setting deadlines in your time line that arc
close to impossible to meet will discourage you when they aren't met. On
the other hand, setting deadlines that arc too easy to meet will keep vou
