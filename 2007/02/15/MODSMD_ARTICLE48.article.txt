Know yourself.
The first step in any job search is to know what you are
looking for. The clearer you are about your interests and
job criteria, the more easily you will find appropriate
options; a job search in the nonprofit sector is no exception to
this rule. Spend some time reflecting on your skills and brain
storming your interests and goals.
Hot tip: Be honest with yourself about your strengths and
what matters to you and your search will yield better and more
satisfying results.
Make your hit list.
Now that you know what motivates you, spend some time
identifying organizations with similar ambitions and
strengths. Arc you passionate about a specific issue and will
ing to contribute to that cause in any way necessary? Do you
want to do a particular type of work and willing to work on

a variety of issues in that capacity? Or are you looking for a
little bit of both? Identify your criteria and search accord
ingly.
Hot tip: Check an organization's mission statement to gauge
whether it is a good fit for your interests and skills.
Score some substantive face time.
"Getting your foot in the door" is perhaps the single best
way to get a job and completing an internship is perhaps the
single best strategy for accomplishing that goal. If the organi
zation of your dreams is unable to offer paid internships, get
creative! Arrange a directed reading with a faculty mentor to
combine your internship experience with academic content to
create a credit-bearing experience. Or, if you can swing a week
of unpaid work, offer to complete a project for the organiza
tion over Spring Break.
Hot tip: Work hard, demonstrate your value and the orga
nization will likely try its darndest to keep you around.
Network, network, network!
As in every sector, the connections you have are among

your biggest assets in the nonprofit job search. Don't feel espe
cially well-connected? Start by sharing your ambitions with
friends and family members and ask if they have any advice or
referrals. Follow up with every lead and ask those people for
additional referrals. Write a thank you note after every con
versation and informational interview and watch your network
grow!
Hot tip: Utilize one of the most connected and helpful net
works in the world: Stanford alumni! Visit http://cardinalca
reers.stanford.edu for more information on the multiple ways
to connect with alumni.
Mold your application materials.
When it comes time to apply for a specific opportunity,
make your resume and cover letter work for you. Read the job
application closely, think broadly about your skills and educa
tion and draw direct connections between what the organiza
tion is seeking and what you can offer. Refer back to the orga
nization's mission statement to guide the language you use and
the experiences you highlight.
Hot tip: Your application speaks volumes; make an
appointment for a resume or cover letter review at the Career
Development Center before sending it out.
