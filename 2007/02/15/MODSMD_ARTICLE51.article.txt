# Volunteering for Development Work
## 
### 
Volunteering is often the first step for many people to
get involved in development work, though volunteer
ing can be an attractive option even if you don't envi
sion a long-term career in development. Volunteering, either
on a long-term (up to two years) or short-term (a few
months) basis is a great way to experience another culture
while making a difference.
There are thousands of volunteer opportunities out there,
offering you the chance to get involved in whatever your par
ticular passion or geographic preference is. The most famous
organization for Americans is the Peace Corps, hut there are
numerous other organizations and agencies that offer opportu
nities for committed volunteers.
Most volunteer assignments are just that: volunteer, mean
ing you won't be drawing a salary. In some cases, though, you
may draw a stipend. A stipend is a living allowance to cover
basic necessities, so that while you might not be saving any
money, you won't be out of pocket either. Some programs will
cover airfare and housing. When evaluating whether or not
volunteering is feasible for you, consider loan-forgiveness -
many universities have loan-forgiveness programs for gradu
ates who choose to work in the nonprofit sector.
Many volunteer opportunities require you to pay the orga

nization for the opportunity to volunteer. Think seriously
about these types of opportunities, especially for "volunteer"
programs that are for teaching English. While it is great to have
the support these programs offer, you could easily be paid for
doing the same work.
Qualifications for Development Careers
Development careers can be extremely competitive, espe
cially for entry-level graduates. Many professionals in the field,
especially senior-level ones, are hired laterally from private
enterprises and bring strong technical and financial skills to
their positions. The more prestigious organizations, such as the
IPC (International Finance Corporation), the ADB (Asian
Development Bank) or the World Bank, are almost impossible
to break into except in very low level, clerical positions. For
example, the IPC regularly receives more than 1 ().()()() appli
cants every year for its two-year Young Professionals program
(about 20 are eventually accepted). Being hired bv the World
Bank out of college requires a degree from a top university as
well as excellent connections.
A notch down from the large international development
and aid banks are a large number of NGOs and smaller gov
ernment affiliates. The emphasis for these organizations, which

generally keep very lean administrative costs, is to get as much
bang for the buck as possible. They are looking for superior
technical skills and individuals who can bring as much as possi
ble to the organization. A commitment to. and passion for.
human development is also crucial.
If you are looking to enter development, the easiest entree
is via volunteering. While some programs may be competitive,
the selection process for voluntary assignments, not surprising
ly. is nowhere near as competitive as for paid positions. The
Peace Corps has one of the most rigorous selection processes.
It can take up to 12 months after the initial application to be
accepted into the program.
What do volunteer agencies look for when they place volun
teers? Above all, commitment and stamina. For many volun
teer positions, job experience and academic accomplishments
are less important than a dedication and a passion for what you
are about to do. Remember that even though you may be foot
ing the bill for some of your travel and living expenses with var
ious programs, you still represent an investment for a nonprof
it organization. They will want to make sure you don't leave
before the end of the agreed upon term.
