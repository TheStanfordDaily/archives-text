# Major Nonprofit Volunteer Organizations
## 
### 
Peace Corps:
Places over 7.000 volunteers a year. Commitments are for two years, though
it is possible to extend them. Check out their comprehensive web site for
more details: ww w.peacecorps.gov
IMB A Enterprise:
The Peace Corps for the MBA crowd. Places recent MBA grads in positions
to act as management and business consultants. Currently heavily focused in
central Asia and Eastern Europe. Check out the site for more information
on postings, qualifications, and how to apply: www.mbaec-cdc.org
Cross Cultural Solutions:
The "mini peace corps," operating in 10 different countries. Volunteer oppor
tunities are short term only (usually 3 weeks) and can be a good way to get
your feet wet and see if development work is really for you. Visit the well
organized web site: www.crossculturalsolutions.org
American Friends Service Committee:
The Quakers. Has a handful of domestic as well as global (mostly Latin
America) opportunities, www.afsc.org
Earth Watch:
Organizes "expeditions" where participants get involved in local develop
ment and environment issues. Not exactly volunteering, but a fascinating
way to see development and conservation in action up close. Warning —
expensive! www.earthwatch.org
Volunteer Travel:
Small outfit offering "vacation" type volunteer programs in 11 countries.
www.voluntecrtravel.com.
Global Services Corps:
Operates in Thailand and Tanzania. Volunteers generally stay with a local
family. Short-term volunteer programs run year round in health, environ
ment and education, www.globalservicecorps.org.

Global Volunteers:
Offers short-term (up to three weeks) placements in 19 different countries.
www.globalvolunteers.com.
Use these web sites and directories devoted to
volunteering and finding work in the non-profit sector:
www.ciee.org — CIEE (Center for International Education Exchange):
Offers numerous volunteer opportunities (over 800 at last check) along with
study and travel programs. Their web site is one of the most comprehensive,
and has a "program finder" to help you narrow down the choices.
Application information and fee information are also included. Use their
web site, even if you aren't planning on volunteering with them (some of
their programs can be pricey), to get a sense of the range of opportunities
and organizations out there.
www.idealist.org — One of the premier resources for people interested in
development. Idealist is an excellent job board and resource center. Focuses
on both domestic and international development.
www.oneworld.net — Another great resource, with jobs, information, coun
try-specific sites, news updates and more. Focus on news and happenings
globally. Essential reading (sign up for their newsletter) for anyone interest
ed in development and emerging economies.
www.volunteerahroad.com — One of the largest directories on the web
devoted to volunteer opportunities. Doesn't charge organizations to list, so
manages to gather smaller organizations and co-ops that wouldn't be able to
afford a paid directory. If you can't find it here, it probably doesn't exist. Also
traveler information and travel resources.
www.cwis.org — Center for World Indigenous Studies. Focuses on the
"Fourth World" (i.e. more desperate than the Third World). A good sourcc
of papers and facts.
Also consider the excellent book: Alternatives to the Peace Corps, edited by
Joan Powell, for more ideas.
