# Internships with Advocacy Organizations
## Examples of advocacy organizations 
### 
For students more interested in a cause than
a specific political agenda, or for those stu
dents who want to broaden their
Washington, D.C experience beyond Capitol
Hill, nearly every organization and every cause is
represented in some form or another within the
nation's capital. Many of these are large organi
zations that provide internships for students.
However, please be aware that internships will
vary from organization to organization: some will
be well structured, others less so; many will offer
pay or stipends, but many more will not; some
will be smaller organizations while others will be
larger and more bureaucratic. It is imperative for
students to do their research.
While the list of advocates within Washington
is too numerous to cover in great detail, there are
many organizations on the right, left, and even in
the center that students may wish to explore.
For example, students interested in the issue
of gun control could apply for internships on
either side of the debate, depending on their phi
losophy, and still work with some of the most
influential organizations in Washington. The
National Rifle Association and the Brady
Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence both offer
legislative internships in their Washington area
headquarters.
Students interested in environmental issues
should consider the liberal-leaning World
Wildlife Federation or Sierra Club, while those
who favor a conservative philosophy on the
environment could look into opportunities with
a think tank or the Council of Environmental
Republican Advocacy or a business organiza
tion.
There are many organizations that are also
non-partisan, and that represent a professional
group or other point of view. For example, the
American Medical Association represents the
interests of doctors before Congress and works
closely with members of both parties.
Please note that it is very common for organi
zations with distinct agendas on both the left and
the right to describe themselves as "non-parti
san." While this is true in a legal sense, the fact is
that many of these organizations do favor the left
or the right in their activities. Students who
aren't sure about an organization's true nature
should cast a critical eye on its issue advocacy
efforts, board of directors, and web site to deter
mine its true leanings.
For a comprehensive list of advocacy organi
zations in Washington, as well as White House
and Congressional staff, corporate offices and
trade associations, check out the Capitol Source,
