## TIME TO STEP UP Mitch Johnson to start in the absence of Anthony Goods 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After being swept in last week
end's road trip through the Wash
ington schools and dropping three
of its last four games, it would be
easy for the Stanford men's basket
ball team to play the blame game.
But head coach Trent Johnson is
not one to scramble for answers.
"As a coach, you can look for a
million reasons." Johnson said."But
the bottom line is we didn't get il
done."
Johnson and the Cardinal (15-N.
7-5 Pacific-10 Conference) will
have the opportunity to right the
ship tonight against Oregon State
(10-16.2-11), but they will have to
do so without guard Anthom
Cioods. The sharpshooting sopho
more is out at least a week, if not
more, with a high left ankle sprain,
and Stanford will shuffle its lineup

to compensate.
Sophomore point guard Mitch
Johnson will get the starting nod.

"We've been though this be

injuries. "Am time you lose a guy of
Anthony's status, you're losing
your best perimeter shooter and
probabh one of your best players.

The Beavers are coming off a
rare win. a 59-55 victory against
Arizona State on Feb. 10 that
snapped a seven-game losing skid.

Sun Devils.
Goods wiU be sorely missed against the
Beavers, who allowed the Cardinal to shoot
52.9 percent from beyond the arc when the
teams last met. That means more pressure on
the perimeter play of sophomore forward
Lawrence Hill (who had a career-high 24
points and five three-pointers at Oregon
State) and a defensive focus on stopping Stan
ford in the paint.
"I have to think that they'll zone or really
just sag into the big guys,especially off me and
Fred [Washington, a senior forward]," Mitch
Johnson said. "Which means we need to cre
ate or step up and hit some shots."

The Cardinal
must also be
careful not to
shoot itself in the

the ball. Stan

37 turnovers
while forcing
only 16 from its
opponents in the
two losses last
weekend.

came back to bite us."

The prognosis from Washington?
"When everybody's doing a lot of dumb lit
tle things, it just adds up."
Having a true point guard — Mitch John
son — bringing the ball up will help. And the
sophomore has the potential to give Stanford
a different look at the guard position.
"Mitch is not our savior." Trent Johnson
said."Mitch is never going to come out and be
the shooter Anthony is in one night. But he
can defend better. He can rebound better."
The head coach dismissed criticism of
Johnson's team-high five turnovers at Wash
ington. arguing that the team as a whole has
problems taking care of the ball. The point
guard. Trent Johnson said, receives more
scrutiny because he handles the ball the ma
jority of the time.
"You've got to make better decisions," he
said. "But if you start looking at our team,
looking at statistics, our bigs are throwing the
ball away more than they are passing."
The Cardinal currently sits last in the con
ference in turnover margin, committing near
ly five more turnovers than its opponents on
average per game.The biggest offenders in as
sist-to-turnover ratio in conference games are
freshman centers Robin and Brook Lopez
(.583 and .409, respectively).
"Our turnovers as a team, and our ability to
concentrate, focus and take care of the ball is
a team situation; so we can work on it," John
son said, adding, "It's'we,' not just anyone in
dividual."
Tipoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. tonight in
Maples Pavilion. The game will be televised
on Fox Sports Net.
