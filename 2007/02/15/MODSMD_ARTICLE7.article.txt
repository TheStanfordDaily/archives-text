# Prowitt, Finger make room for
## for Lopez breakthrough 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Just a couple seasons back, it didn't look like it would be
like this for Peter Prowitt and Taj I inger. Who would have
thought the two big men would be finding themselves less a
part of the action in their junior years?
Consider the fall of 2(K)4. The duo traveled across the
country and made an immediate impact as freshmen.
Prowitt. a center, and Finger, a forward, played in the ma
jority of games for a team just a season removed from a 2(v
0 start and national No. 1 ranking.The pair of freshmen gave
fans a reason to think they eould follow in the footsteps of
the great posts to play at Stanford over the past decade.
Consider their sophomore year. Finger started all but two
games, and both he and Prowitt cracked the 10()-point
plateau, combining for 248 points on the season.

Hut then came the
Lopez twins. As the
brothers started to
shake up West Coast
basketball from Pull
man. Wash, to Tucson.
Ariz., they didn't
spare Stanford's depth
chart.
Robin scored 14.12
and 10 points in the
first three games of his
career, and experts
agree his defense is
better than his of
fense. I ie proved them
right — shutting down
fellow McDonald's
All -American
Spencer Hawes of
Washington — and
hasn't looked back
since.

...You make that
adjustment. Its
one we both
happily make.

By December. Brook was ready for action. In his second
collegiate game, he scored 18 points despite the injured back
that kept him off the court for six months. In January, his 12
blocks against Southern California doubled the old school
record as he recorded Stanford's first triple-double in at
least 20 years. It could be Stanford's first ever as the record
books only go back to the mid-1980s.
While the rest of the West Coast is in awe. Prowitt and
Finger have known it all along: The Lopez twins are that
good.
"The way you get more playing time is to work harder
and be more productive," Prowitt said. "And they have
been."
So while the starters were notching last-second win after
last-second win over Virginia. Washington and Washington
State.stunning UCL.A and demolishing California, the lime
light intensified.
An AP ranking. Sports Center highlights. Players of the
Week and spots in the mock brackets. Speculation on going
