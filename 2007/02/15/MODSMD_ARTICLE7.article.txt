# Prowitt, Finger make room for
## for Lopez breakthrough 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Just a couple seasons back, it didn't look like it would be
like this for Peter Prowitt and Taj I inger. Who would have
thought the two big men would be finding themselves less a
part of the action in their junior years?
Consider the fall of 2(K)4. The duo traveled across the
country and made an immediate impact as freshmen.
Prowitt. a center, and Finger, a forward, played in the ma
jority of games for a team just a season removed from a 2(v
0 start and national No. 1 ranking.The pair of freshmen gave
fans a reason to think they eould follow in the footsteps of
the great posts to play at Stanford over the past decade.
Consider their sophomore year. Finger started all but two
games, and both he and Prowitt cracked the 10()-point
plateau, combining for 248 points on the season.

Hut then came the
Lopez twins. As the
brothers started to
shake up West Coast
basketball from Pull
man. Wash, to Tucson.
Ariz., they didn't
spare Stanford's depth
chart.
Robin scored 14.12
and 10 points in the
first three games of his
career, and experts
agree his defense is
better than his of
fense. I ie proved them
right — shutting down
fellow McDonald's
All -American
Spencer Hawes of
Washington — and
hasn't looked back
since.

...You make that
adjustment. Its
one we both
happily make.

By December. Brook was ready for action. In his second
collegiate game, he scored 18 points despite the injured back
that kept him off the court for six months. In January, his 12
blocks against Southern California doubled the old school
record as he recorded Stanford's first triple-double in at
least 20 years. It could be Stanford's first ever as the record
books only go back to the mid-1980s.
While the rest of the West Coast is in awe. Prowitt and
Finger have known it all along: The Lopez twins are that
good.
"The way you get more playing time is to work harder
and be more productive," Prowitt said. "And they have
been."
So while the starters were notching last-second win after
last-second win over Virginia. Washington and Washington
State.stunning UCL.A and demolishing California, the lime
light intensified.

early to the NBA. (Brook told The
Argus: "It's really not up to me. I
guess it [depends on] scouts' interest
in us. We're just going to enjoy our
time here and get the most out of
it.") Yet another feature on Brook,
Robin and their single mother, this
time picked up by The New York
limes.
Meanwhile, l inger and Prowitt
found themselves on the sidelines. It
wasn't just because of the Lope/
twins, though. Finger is known bet
ter for his defense than his scoring,
and Prowitt got a late start to his
season after breaking a bone in his
knee in October. Still, the statistics
aren't what they had hoped for.
They're combining for just 5.4
points and 18.6 minutes per game
this season, mostly substituting in
for the twins.
"You know that you sort of don't
have as much leeway, a little bit of a
shorter rope," Prowitt said.

That pressure is there. On the
road, with the game on the line and
thousands of fans watching and scru
tinizing, any mistake can be a ticket
off the court when the Lope/ twins
are waiting on the bench.
"There's definitely times where
it's really frustrating,especially after
losses or where you're going through
a game and you're going in for two
seconds getting pulled," I inger said.
"You're sitting on the bench, maybe
you want to get really angry, but
again there's nothing you can do
about it."
Prowitt agreed.
"It's always frustrating because
we are competitive," lie said. "We do
want to play. We're not guys who are
content just sitting on the bench. But
at the same time, we're also guys that
want to win."
Sure enough, the Lope/ twins
have helped lead Stanford to what
could be its most successful season
since Prowitt and Lingo arrived.
This team should match 'last year's
16-win total tonight, with a month
left on its season.The NCAA Tour
nament is within sight. Winning,
Prowitt said, changes everything.

"We're on a much better team
than we were last year," he said.
"Being on a winning team is much
more fun than getting our butts
kicked, which sometimes happened
last year. But when you're having
success as a team, what can you say?"
Come March. Brook, Robin and
sophomore forward Lawrence Hill
will have plenty to say, to be sure.
But. inevitably, their bodies will tire
after the grind of a long season and
opponents will key on them defen
sively.
l iie door could then swing open
for Prowitt and Finger to make their
mark, something they've already
proved they are capable of.
According to Prowitt. they'll be
ready.
"[On| the majority of Division I
teams, 'laj could be a starter, Taj
could be a star player," he said. "I
could be a starter. I could be a good
player. At the same time, it's a better
time here, and you make that adjust
ment. It's one we both happily
make."
