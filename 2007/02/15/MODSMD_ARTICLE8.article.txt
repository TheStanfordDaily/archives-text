# Making the Change
## Muphy adjusts to life shifts and turns them in her favor 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All around Melanie Murphy, things
have been changing. As a freshman from
Brooklyn. New York, the cross-country
move was merely the beginning. And Mur
phy's season began as it does for most
freshmen: tough

"I didn't really have that many surpris
es," Murphy said."l just figured everything
would be hard, and it was. So. it just lived
up to my expectations."
Luckily for her, Murphy found the
leadership of teammates like junior guard
Candice Wiggins to be a steadying force,
helping her find her place on Stanford's
squad.

"I feel like Candice has really taken me
under her wing," Murphy said. "She has
told me different things I have to look for
when I play in the games."
As a member of the experienced Cardi
nal backcourt. Murphy is averaging 5.7
minutes in 21 game appearances and is
constantly absorbing advice and strategy
from the coaches and upperclassmen.

Things changed for Murphy when
freshman point guard JJ Hones tore her
\CL during the first minute of Stanford's
Feb. A loss to No. 22 California. Murphy
soon predicted her own fate.
"| What happened to Hones] is very un
fortunate." Murphy said."The whole team
is upset about it. but at the same time,
more people are going to get the opportu
nity ... to show what they can do."
Murphy got that opportunity and
seized it. registering a season-high 11
points and eight assists in the Cardinal's
Feb. 10 match-up with Washington. In that
performance. Murphy said that her bas
ketball instincts simply took over.
The team is hopeful that these instincts
will remain in the forefront of Murphy's
game for the rest of the season. While head
coachTara VanDerveer expects the team's

Freshman forward/guard Melanie Murphy faces the challenge of filling an injured starter's shoes. So far, she has succeeded in showing off her talents.
success to be rooted in the contri
butions from many players. Mur
phy noted that VanDerveer has
been specific about personal goals
and each individual's involvement.
For Murphy, ball security is a big
part of that. Stanford averages only
15 turnovers per game as a team,
leading the Pacific-10 Conference.
Against Washington. Murphy had
a lone turnover â€”an indication
that she'll continue the Cardinal's
protective trend during each pos
session. However, VanDerveer
wants Murphy to establish herself
on the offensive end as well.
"I'm just looking for my jump
shot a lot more," Murphy said.
"The coaches are looking for me to
take that. I've always been a driv
er, so I'm [also] looking to get to
the basket."
Ibr Murphy, "always" began at
age seven, when she picked up bas
ketball for the first time in St.
Columba's local church league,
under the guidance of her parents,
Joseph and Rochelle. She contin

ued to play throughout childhood
and adolescence,finally captaining
her Midwood High School team
for two years. At the end of her ca
reer, she was the school's all-time
leading scorer( 1,855 points) and
averaged 15.5 points, 5.4 rebounds
and 4.4 assists each game. Amid
the slew of honors she received,
one particularly sticks out in Mur
phy's mind.
"In high school, I had my jersey
retired my senior year," she said.
"It was the only one to be retired in
the history of the school, so I'm
pretty proud of that."
With Stanford's final regular
season road trip this weekend and
a postseason beyond that. Murphy
believes that her future holds
changes that extend beyond bas
ketball. such as a career in entre
preneurial business.
"But, right now. I'm just going
to get through college and see
what happens," Murphy said.
With a start like this, perhaps
Murphy will find a national cham
pionship, or maybe another retired
jersey. Sometimes, things change
onlv for the better.
