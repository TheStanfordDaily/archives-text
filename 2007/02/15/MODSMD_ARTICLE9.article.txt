# TOP FIVE TO WATCH
## 
### 
1. Damaged Goods
Sophomore guard Anthony Goods will miss at
least this weekend, and possibly more, with a
high left ankle sprain. Perimeter shooting was
key to Stanford's 67-56 victory at Oregon State
last month, so shooters like sophomore forward
Lawrence Hill, sophomore guard Kenny Brown
and freshman guard Landry Fields will have the
opportunity, and the necessity, to step up.
2. Mitch's Moment
Sophomore point guard Mitch Johnson will now
start in Goods' absence. While he won't replace
Goods' shooting from outside, Johnson will
bring a greater focus on defense and rebounding
from the guard position — something that the
team has lacked in recent games.
3. Guard the Ball
Stanford, currently last in the Pac-10 in turnover
margin, committed 37 turnovers and forced only
16 in last weekend's losses at Washington State
and Washington. The Card must value the ball
tonight against the Beavers, who turned the ball
over only five times compared to Stanford's 18
when the two teams last met.
4. Pound the Glass
Despite its perch atop the conference rankings in
rebounding margin (+5.8 per game average),
the Cardinal was outrebounded and outhustled
while being swept on the road last weekend.
Stanford's 30-23 advantage on the glass was key
in its win at Oregon State (ranked last in the con
ference in rebounding margin), so increased
focus on the boards is a must.
5. Keeping up with the
Jones
Oregon State junior forward Marcel Jones
dropped 20 points and eight rebounds on the
Cardinal last time around, then added seven
steals for good measure. Expect turnover-weary
Stanford to be ready.
