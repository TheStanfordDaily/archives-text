Russian President Vladimir Putin risked
a confrontation with the United States in
Munich over the weekend with his remarks
at the annual Conference on Security Poli
cy. which is sometimes called the "Davos for
global security" after the Swiss host to the
yearly meeting of the World Economic
Forum. Mr. Putin slammed the United
States for its unilateral foreign policy, as
serting that "one country — the United
States — oversteps its national borders in
every respect. This is very dangerous. More
and more no one feels safe, because people

can no longer take refuge
behind international law.
This encourages an arms
race and a desire to develop

Putin denounces U.S.

nuclear weapons."
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates,
who attended the conference, downplayed
this firebrand rhetoric and declared that "one
Cold War was enough," indicating his unwill
ingness to engage in debate with Mr. Putin.
Putin, whose replacement will be elect
ed next March, also made news this week
by promoting Defense Minister Sergei
Ivanov to the post of first deputy Prime
Minister. This promotion established
Ivanov, who has presided over an
increase in Russia's nuclear arsenal
and in growing weapons sales to
countries like Iran, as a frontrunner
in the upcoming campaign for the
Russian presidency.

Shi'ite leader rumored to be in Iran
In Iraq, rumor has surfaced that the radical Shi'ite
cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who stands at the head of
Baghdad's most powerful Shi'ite militia, has crossed
the border into Iran.
While sources close to the cleric insist that his
visit to Iran is not an act of flight from the growing
crackdown on partisan militias led by U.S. military
forces in Iraq, there is some speculation that even
the elusive al-Sadr might be detained during the
Bush administration's latest push to secure Bagh
dad. By some accounts, al-Sadr has been in Iran for
three weeks already.
The news came just after President Bush hosted
a press conference in which he declared that the
Quds Force, an elite branch of the Iranian military,
has supplied Iraqi Sh'ite militias with deadly
weaponry responsible for the deaths of American
soldiers.The president's allegation is the latest in a
series ol hard line speeches challenging the Islamic
regime in Tehran and accusing it of destabilizing the
region, themes he has been promoting since this
year's State of the Union.

Nuclear reactor to be dismantled
After more than three years of disagreement
and deadlock, the six-party nuclear disarma
ment talks between the United States, China,
North Korea, South Korea, Japan and Russia
took a major step forward on Tuesday. Fol
lowing a grueling session that began on Mon
day morning and lasted well into the next day,
envoys to the Beijing-based talks announced
that a deal had been reached that
would bring about the closure
of North Korea's princi
pal nuclear reactor at
Yongbyon.
In exchange for
dismantling its op
erations at Yongby
on. the regime of dic
tator Kim Jong II will re
ceive international aid in
the form of 50,000 met
ric tons of fuel, with an
additional million tons
promised in the near fu
ture. Stressing that the agree
ment is only the first phase of a
long process, the United States and
Japan (the conference members most antag
onistic to the government in Pyongyang)
have agreed to discuss the normalization of
relations with the North.
Critics of the plan contend that this deal
does no better than the 1994 Agreed Frame
work in holding Mr. Kim to his word. To this
suggestion. U.S. Secretary of State Con
doleezza Rice responded that the deal is a
preliminary one, but that it is already superi
or to the Agreed Framework because it is
multilateral and because it provides less aid
to the rogue state.
Critics in a number of editorials published
in the Russian Federation alleged that the
I Inited States is delivering too many conces
sions in the interest of stabilizing the region
while distracted by nuclear proliferation in
Iran's Islamic Republic.
