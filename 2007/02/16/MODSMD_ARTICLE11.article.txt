"| We were looking for a| leading

a distinguished publication record
and also strong interests and experi

an email to The Daily.
Hecker, who is an expert in the
nuclear field, is also a director emer
itus of the Los Alamos National Lab
oratory (LANL). where he worked
to develop relations with Russian nu
clear laboratories in order to obtain
the former Soviet Union's nuclear
weapons.
"My own research is very focused
on nuclear challenges — from nu
clear weapons, to policy, to preven

the safe and secure expansion of nu
clear energy," I lecker said.
I le has also worked closely on nu
