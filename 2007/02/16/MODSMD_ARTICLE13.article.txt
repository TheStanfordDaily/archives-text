## Editorial Board Congratulations to the new Harvard president 
### 
The Daily would like to congratulate
1 larvard's choice for its new presi
dent. Radcliffe Institute head Drew
Gilpin Faust. She is a line choice to replace
interim president Derek Bok at the head of
one of America's finest universities. Stan
ford is blessed to have a faculty and admin
istration that, for the most part, get along
well, and we wish Harvard better relations
than those which marked Lawrence Sum
mers's shortened tenure as president. We
particularly hope that Harvard under Faust
continues the expansion in its science offer
ings and research that Summers began sev
eral years ago.
We are also glad to know that Stanford
will be able to keep Provost John
Ftchemendy, who was widely rumored to be
one of the top four contenders for the Har
vard job. Throughout the selection process,
Ftchemendy denied interest in the Harvard
presidency, saying that he already has the
best job in higher education. The Daily is
glad the Provost feels that way, as he has
proven himself to be both popular with fac
ulty and accessible to students.

The national media has made much of
the gender of Harvard's 28th president,
something that Faust has downplayed in her
recent public comments. It is clear that, at
least in terms of Ivy League presidents,
women have achieved parity with their
male colleagues — a statistic that would
have been unprecedented just a decade ago.
Fully half of Ivy League presidents are
women, and they have proven themselves
effective leaders both off- and on-campus.
The gender imbalance at both Stanford
and its Ivy League counterparts in faculty
remains significant, but it is refreshing to
know that universities have at least made
great strides in selecting their presidents.
With gender parity in top administrative po
sitions established, greater attention should
now be paid to inequalities lower down in
universities, especially in the sciences —
something that Faust has noted.
Deciding whom to hire as president of a
major research university is never easy, but
it appears that Harvard has made an excel
lent choice in Faust. We look forward to
hearing from her in the future.
