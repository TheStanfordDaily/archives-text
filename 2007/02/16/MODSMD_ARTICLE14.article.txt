I've been downsized. Well, not so much
downsized as refitted to a more appro
priate dimension. My weekly words of
wisdom will now only be coming to you fort
nightly. Please, try to stay calm. You'll sur
vive.
Actually, you really shouldn't fret. I'll be
alternating with Vishnu, The Daily's other
brown graduate student columnist (let's
hear it for diversity). As a result, it's unlike
ly that you'll ever notice the switching to
and fro: after all. the faceless mass that is
graduate students of sub-continental her
itage is nothing if not homogenous.
Now. let 's move on to more pleasant sub
jects.
Smoking is really fucking good. Not just
sort of marginally entertaining, but mind
blowingly pleasurable. In fact, it's so good
that even addicts are rarely capable of truly
appreciating its splendor.
Sadly, however, banning the demon
weed from public places has become one of
the popular crusades of our time, and this
pleasure is becoming harder to experience.
Worse, the ban phenomenon will soon hit
my home town.
Of course, Californians have being
stamping on the rights of individuals for
longer than most of the rest of the world, so
perhaps you cannot fully appreciate the
magnitude of this revolution.
The great cities of the world are changing
New York and San Francisco are already
lost and, this summer. London too will join
the ranks of the nicotine-controlled.
As a result of this approaching reforma
tion. 1 was forced to have a cigarette (well,
several cigarettes) earlier this year, during
my most recent visit home.
Like many smokers, I'm addicted to giv
ing up the cancer sticks: no matter how
many times I tell myself that I'm smoking
my "last cigarette." it always comes round
again.
Up until a few weeks ago, I was a shade
over six months clean, yet the puffing
recommenced the moment someone point
ed out to me that it was the last time I would
be able to inhale in a capital of the civilized
world.
Savoring the last cigarette I was ever
going to smoke (again), I quickly settled

into a blissful state of tar immersion and im
mediately started wondering why I had left.
The answer is obvious; smoking may be
amazing, but it's also highly addictive and
bad for you.This is a universal 112 act, acknowl
edged not only by joyless, miserable and evil
anti-smoking crusaders, but also by indul
gers, be they regular or occasional.
What is troubling, though, is that those
who don't smoke fail to recognize the other
great truth lurking within the wisps of blue
grey smoke — smoking is good. Not good
for you. just good.
Every time anyone tries to explain this
simple fact, he is met with incredulous
stares, slight sneers and a patronizing look
that makes it very clear that the opinion of a
debauched addict who's lost his grip on re
ality is worthless.
When you think about it. this is some
what odd. People seem perfectly capable of
recognizing that many things with potential
ly adverse consequences can be quite fun.
Alcohol has its risks (many of them), but at
least people seem to appreciate that drink
ing is enjoyable.
While they may not mention it them
selves. abstinence campaigners will surely
not roll their eyes at the proposition that sex
is pleasurable.
And. although it destroys my social life. I
still love physics more than existence itself.
Everything has social costs — driving
leads to accidents and dead people, drinking
gets some folks into fights and physics de
stroys hope. Yet secondhand smoke seems
elevated to a special level of reprehensibili
ty for reasons that escape me.
In a way. this is a reflection of the growth
of fundamentalism — a distinct failure to
grasp the notion that different people can

This, however, is a subtle point, and,
in world where nuance, understanding
and empathy have been replaced by
Michael Moore and Ann Coulter, it's
probably a lost point as well.

Now, I don't want you to think
this is a pro-smoking column. Be
cause it isn't. OK, that's not true — it
is. But I'm not suggesting you go out
and smoke (though, again, it's great
and you really should experience
everything life has to offer); I just
want you to show a little understand
ing and appreciate that some people
do.
Who am 1 kidding? Screw under

standing. I want you to smoke. Go
on. stroll over to theTresidder Store,
get a pack of Marlboros and experi
ence the pinnacle of human ingenu
ity: life,death and cool all wrapped in
a stick.

I'm dreaming of cigarettes again.
