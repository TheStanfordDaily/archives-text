Editorial mixes metaphors
In your article ("Editorial Board:
Metapfu>rs ;ind guns don't mix." February 14.
2007). while railing against Sandra Froman's
use of metaphors in her recent speech, the
editorial hoard displayed its own ignorance
regarding proper usage of the form.The arti
cle stated, "One wonders where Froman
stands on requiring drivers to understand
traffic laws and know how to operate their
vehicles â€” a more appropriate metaphor by
any means" in attacking Froman's position
against required training for gun owners,
where she compared that to Jim Crow voting
requirements. What you have overlooked in
mixing your metaphors is that gun ownership
and voting are both Constitutionally guaran
teed rights while driving a motor vehicle is a
government-granted privilege, and govern
ments may indeed impose qualifying re
quirements in order to gain access to a privi
lege. Obviously, yours was not "a more ap

propriate metaphor by any means." Such a
demonstrated lack of understanding of such
a fundamental concept of law is truly ap
palling. It makes one wonder how the edito
rial board gained entrance to Stanford.
Does it make sense to obtain training if
one decides to own a firearm? Absolutely.
May training be imposed as a requirement
for ownership? Absolutely not.The training
requirements could be set sufficiently and
arbitrarily high as to ensure failure and
thereby impose a de facto denial, circum
venting established law. (This is, in fact, the
situation in lowa, where the range test re
quired by many sheriffs for qualifying for a
concealed carry permit is so difficult that
most cops can't pass it.)
I would encourage you not to criticize
others' use of metaphors until you master
their use yourselves.
