something, power-hitting Grif
fey Jr.. stared at my mother, as in the hum
bling 40-year-old woman gushing and blush
ing in front of him. While mommy dearest
dug through her purse, looking for some
thing. anything, that he might sign, my ado
lescent self attempted to fade into the hotel
wall behind me. Which is not to say that I was
n't as starry-eyed as she was — 1 was just far
too embarrassed to breathe, let alone speak.
In the years that followed, my mother's ef
fusive phrase and the lost autograph oppor
tunity entered family folklore, along with a
number of other, remarkably similar brushes
with fame. Four consecutive April vacations
in Peoria, Arizona, home of the Mariners'
spring training camp, led to a handful of su
perstar encounters (producing, to my moth
er's great relief and my father's great pride,
signatures belonging to Ken. his father, and
his brother; we stopped short of asking his
mother).
Over the years, my mother's tastes have
changed, shifting from young, male athletes
(as we moved from Seattle to a Philadelphia
suburb to Palo Alto, Ken was replaced by

Kobe was replaced by Tiger), to young, male
artists. She's flown to Phoenix to see 25-year
old jazz vocalist Peter Cincotti, purchased
books she will never read to get them signed
by Daniel Mason and Michael Cunningham
(OK. so he's gay and nearly 55) and spent
countless hours perusing the blogs of Tony
award-winning Broadway stars John
Tartaglia and John Lloyd Young.
Although my brother and I joke about my
mother's ever-growing list of celebrity crush
es and the mortifying encounters that often
accompany them. I know the phenomenon is
only human.Take Anna Nicole Smith, for ex
ample. Her entire career (if 20 years of
provocative posing can be called that) was
based on our fascination with stardom and
the large breasts that often accompany its fe

male form.
As is the case with many human phenom
ena. however, Stanford students approach
celebrity differently. While the rest of the
world relies on "The Surreal Life" and "In
Touch" to satisfy its need for pop idol
voyeurism on a weekly basis, we get our daily
up-close-and-personal glimpses into the
lifestyles of the rich and somewhat/someday
famous courtesy of our ever-impressive cur
rent and former student body.
Three weeks into my freshman year. I had
joined 30 clubs and enrolled in five classes
when the Farm offered up yet another
unique opportunity. Sitting in Annenberg
Auditorium one morning, waiting eagerly for

when a bleach-blond version of the Jolly
Green Giant took the seat next to me.
"Hey." He leaned over, and a powerful
whiff of chlorine/cologne came my way.
"What'd I miss?"
"Class hasn't started yet." I was a bright,
little 18-year-old.
"No, 1 mean, like, what'd 1 miss?" He
paused and registered the blank look on my
