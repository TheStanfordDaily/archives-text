£ £ Ken. we think you're sooooo
I 1 great." Ken. as in the svelte. 20-
something, power-hitting Grif
fey Jr.. stared at my mother, as in the hum
bling 40-year-old woman gushing and blush
ing in front of him. While mommy dearest
dug through her purse, looking for some
thing. anything, that he might sign, my ado
lescent self attempted to fade into the hotel
wall behind me. Which is not to say that I was
n't as starry-eyed as she was — 1 was just far
too embarrassed to breathe, let alone speak.
In the years that followed, my mother's ef
fusive phrase and the lost autograph oppor
tunity entered family folklore, along with a
number of other, remarkably similar brushes
with fame. Four consecutive April vacations
in Peoria, Arizona, home of the Mariners'
spring training camp, led to a handful of su
perstar encounters (producing, to my moth
er's great relief and my father's great pride,
signatures belonging to Ken. his father, and
his brother; we stopped short of asking his
mother).
Over the years, my mother's tastes have
changed, shifting from young, male athletes
(as we moved from Seattle to a Philadelphia
suburb to Palo Alto, Ken was replaced by

Kobe was replaced by Tiger), to young, male
artists. She's flown to Phoenix to see 25-year
old jazz vocalist Peter Cincotti, purchased
books she will never read to get them signed
by Daniel Mason and Michael Cunningham
(OK. so he's gay and nearly 55) and spent
countless hours perusing the blogs of Tony
award-winning Broadway stars John
Tartaglia and John Lloyd Young.
Although my brother and I joke about my
mother's ever-growing list of celebrity crush
es and the mortifying encounters that often
accompany them. I know the phenomenon is
only human.Take Anna Nicole Smith, for ex
ample. Her entire career (if 20 years of
provocative posing can be called that) was
based on our fascination with stardom and
the large breasts that often accompany its fe

male form.
As is the case with many human phenom
ena. however, Stanford students approach
celebrity differently. While the rest of the
world relies on "The Surreal Life" and "In
Touch" to satisfy its need for pop idol
voyeurism on a weekly basis, we get our daily
up-close-and-personal glimpses into the
lifestyles of the rich and somewhat/someday
famous courtesy of our ever-impressive cur
rent and former student body.
Three weeks into my freshman year. I had
joined 30 clubs and enrolled in five classes
when the Farm offered up yet another
unique opportunity. Sitting in Annenberg
Auditorium one morning, waiting eagerly for
IHUM lecture to begin. 1 barely looked up
when a bleach-blond version of the Jolly
Green Giant took the seat next to me.
"Hey." He leaned over, and a powerful
whiff of chlorine/cologne came my way.
"What'd I miss?"
"Class hasn't started yet." I was a bright,
little 18-year-old.
"No, 1 mean, like, what'd 1 miss?" He
paused and registered the blank look on my



Lisa

Pearls of wisdom
face. "1 just got here. 1 mean, 1
haven't been here. Like.on campus."
•What?"
"I was in Sydney." (FYI: In the
year 2000. the summer Olympics
were held in Sydney, Australia.)
"Oh! Were you watching the
Olympics?"
"No. I was playing in them."
1 played it cool at the time, giving
him a knowing smile and a quick
nod, but the second lecture ended, 1
bolted back to my dorm. One trip to
the Stanford men's water polo web
site and 30 seconds of Google
searching later. I had 800,000 hits
identifying Tony Azevedo, the 18-
year-old water polo phenom mod
estly nicknamed "The Savior."
For Tony (whose moniker went
unused during his four years on the
Farm) and for most Stanford pseu
do-celebrities.the rest of the world is
much more impressed than the peo
ple on this campus. Just ask a tour
guide: even the most SAT-GPA-ob
sessed parent can be successfully di
verted by a lengthy list of past and
present students. Back in my tour
guiding heyday (that would be AD
2002-2004), the toughest audience,
middle school girls, could be silenced
with the drop of a single, precious

name.
"You know." I'd shout over the
din of chatting pre-teens and their
anxious chaperones, "Corey
Matthews goes to school here. If
you're quiet for the rest of the tour,
ill show you where he lives." Just
like that,you could hear a bike crash
on the opposite side of the Quad.
For those of you not in
touch with the pubescent tendencies
of the past 10 years, Corey Matthews
is Ben Savage's character from "Boy
Meets World." I've never actually
seen the show, but I'm fairly sure that
the girls would have been in for a
shock if I'd ever let them go up and
knock on his door, a request 1 fielded
virtually every tour. Even from 300
yards away, the shirtless boys and
empty kegs of Sigma Chi are not ex
actly Nickelodeon material.
As "The Newlyweds" duly
proved, celebrity tends to lose its
glamour under scrutiny; the person
alities we see drunk at frat parties
can't hold a candle to the ones who
visit. And visit they do. Indeed, the
fliers covering every blank, non
sandstone inch of this campus sug
gest that, if you're willing to expand
your definition of "fame" to include
academics, you could dedicate four
solid years to star-stalking.

Times columnist/TV personality
Joel Stein returned to his old stomp
ing grounds at The Daily. Ill be hon
est: prior to Joel's 45-minute inspira

tional speech about getting lucky (in
a professional sense, that is), I was
only vaguely aware of his impressive
resume. And before to seeing him
walk through the door. I had no in
terest in his, um, other attributes.
For most of my 24 years of life,
I've followed my scientist-mother's
example, separating my celebrity
crushes from my intellectual ones
(although I maintain that Jake Gvl
lenhaal is brilliant). With Joel Stein,
however, I'm not sure whether I
want to marry him or be him.
I'd like to think this change indi
cates some sort of progress in terms
of my emotional development, but
there is only one advance of which
I'm now certain. On that distant
evening in Ken Griffey Jr.'s hotel. I
swore 1 would never make a com
ment as mortifying as my mother's
zealous declaration. But if I'd gotten
close enough last Thursday night. I
would have said something to the ef
fect of "Joel. 1 think you're soooo
great." If he'd been willing to hook
me up with a wedding ring and/or a
writing gig, I'd have been willing to
upgrade the self-effacement (though
to what I'm not sure).The only thing
worse than our interest in fame is
what we'll do to get it.

Lisa Mendelman respects the bound
aries of Joel Stem's marriage but chose
to disregard them for artistic purposes.

Over the years, my mother's tastes have
changed, shifting from young, male athletes
(as we moved from Seattle to a Philadelphia
suburb to Palo Alto, Ken was replaced by

Kobe was replaced by Tiger), to young, male
artists. She's flown to Phoenix to see 25-year
old jazz vocalist Peter Cincotti, purchased
books she will never read to get them signed
by Daniel Mason and Michael Cunningham
(OK. so he's gay and nearly 55) and spent
countless hours perusing the blogs of Tony
award-winning Broadway stars John
Tartaglia and John Lloyd Young.
Although my brother and I joke about my
mother's ever-growing list of celebrity crush
es and the mortifying encounters that often
accompany them. I know the phenomenon is
only human.Take Anna Nicole Smith, for ex
ample. Her entire career (if 20 years of
provocative posing can be called that) was
based on our fascination with stardom and
the large breasts that often accompany its fe

male form.
As is the case with many human phenom
ena. however, Stanford students approach
celebrity differently. While the rest of the
world relies on "The Surreal Life" and "In
Touch" to satisfy its need for pop idol
voyeurism on a weekly basis, we get our daily
up-close-and-personal glimpses into the
lifestyles of the rich and somewhat/someday
famous courtesy of our ever-impressive cur
rent and former student body.
Three weeks into my freshman year. I had
joined 30 clubs and enrolled in five classes
when the Farm offered up yet another
unique opportunity. Sitting in Annenberg
Auditorium one morning, waiting eagerly for
IHUM lecture to begin. 1 barely looked up
when a bleach-blond version of the Jolly
Green Giant took the seat next to me.
"Hey." He leaned over, and a powerful
whiff of chlorine/cologne came my way.
"What'd I miss?"
"Class hasn't started yet." I was a bright,
little 18-year-old.
"No, 1 mean, like, what'd 1 miss?" He
paused and registered the blank look on my

face. "1 just got here. 1 mean, 1
haven't been here. Like.on campus."
•What?"
"I was in Sydney." (FYI: In the
year 2000. the summer Olympics
were held in Sydney, Australia.)
"Oh! Were you watching the
Olympics?"
"No. I was playing in them."
1 played it cool at the time, giving
him a knowing smile and a quick
nod, but the second lecture ended, 1
bolted back to my dorm. One trip to
the Stanford men's water polo web
site and 30 seconds of Google
searching later. I had 800,000 hits
identifying Tony Azevedo, the 18-
year-old water polo phenom mod
estly nicknamed "The Savior."
For Tony (whose moniker went
unused during his four years on the
Farm) and for most Stanford pseu
do-celebrities.the rest of the world is
much more impressed than the peo
ple on this campus. Just ask a tour
guide: even the most SAT-GPA-ob
sessed parent can be successfully di
verted by a lengthy list of past and
present students. Back in my tour
guiding heyday (that would be AD
2002-2004), the toughest audience,
middle school girls, could be silenced
with the drop of a single, precious

name.
"You know." I'd shout over the
din of chatting pre-teens and their
anxious chaperones, "Corey
Matthews goes to school here. If
you're quiet for the rest of the tour,
ill show you where he lives." Just
like that,you could hear a bike crash
on the opposite side of the Quad.
For those of you not in
touch with the pubescent tendencies
of the past 10 years, Corey Matthews
is Ben Savage's character from "Boy
Meets World." I've never actually
seen the show, but I'm fairly sure that
the girls would have been in for a
shock if I'd ever let them go up and
knock on his door, a request 1 fielded
virtually every tour. Even from 300
yards away, the shirtless boys and
empty kegs of Sigma Chi are not ex
actly Nickelodeon material.
As "The Newlyweds" duly
proved, celebrity tends to lose its
glamour under scrutiny; the person
alities we see drunk at frat parties
can't hold a candle to the ones who
visit. And visit they do. Indeed, the
fliers covering every blank, non
sandstone inch of this campus sug
gest that, if you're willing to expand
your definition of "fame" to include
academics, you could dedicate four
solid years to star-stalking.

Times columnist/TV personality
Joel Stein returned to his old stomp
ing grounds at The Daily. Ill be hon
est: prior to Joel's 45-minute inspira

tional speech about getting lucky (in
a professional sense, that is), I was
only vaguely aware of his impressive
resume. And before to seeing him
walk through the door. I had no in
terest in his, um, other attributes.
For most of my 24 years of life,
I've followed my scientist-mother's
example, separating my celebrity
crushes from my intellectual ones
(although I maintain that Jake Gvl
lenhaal is brilliant). With Joel Stein,
however, I'm not sure whether I
want to marry him or be him.
I'd like to think this change indi
cates some sort of progress in terms
of my emotional development, but
there is only one advance of which
I'm now certain. On that distant
evening in Ken Griffey Jr.'s hotel. I
swore 1 would never make a com
ment as mortifying as my mother's
zealous declaration. But if I'd gotten
close enough last Thursday night. I
would have said something to the ef
fect of "Joel. 1 think you're soooo
great." If he'd been willing to hook
me up with a wedding ring and/or a
writing gig, I'd have been willing to
upgrade the self-effacement (though
to what I'm not sure).The only thing
worse than our interest in fame is
what we'll do to get it.

Lisa Mendelman respects the bound
aries of Joel Stem's marriage but chose
to disregard them for artistic purposes.

something, power-hitting Grif
fey Jr.. stared at my mother, as in the hum
bling 40-year-old woman gushing and blush
ing in front of him. While mommy dearest
dug through her purse, looking for some
thing. anything, that he might sign, my ado
lescent self attempted to fade into the hotel
wall behind me. Which is not to say that I was
n't as starry-eyed as she was — 1 was just far
too embarrassed to breathe, let alone speak.
In the years that followed, my mother's ef
fusive phrase and the lost autograph oppor
tunity entered family folklore, along with a
number of other, remarkably similar brushes
with fame. Four consecutive April vacations
in Peoria, Arizona, home of the Mariners'
spring training camp, led to a handful of su
perstar encounters (producing, to my moth
er's great relief and my father's great pride,
signatures belonging to Ken. his father, and
his brother; we stopped short of asking his
mother).
