# Hello male-controlled vibrator, good-bye feminism
## 
### 
Not so long ago, scores of females
trudged off to college with one great
and shining goal: to get their MRS de
gree. No one wanted to end up a brittle,child
less spinster, and four years of higher educa
tion were a fertile mecca for husband-hunt
ing. However, societal pressure aside, what
really kept this system going was that hoards
of frustrated young women knew of no other
acceptable way to relieve their sexual ten
sion.
Fast-forward to sex-positive feminism and
the majestic rise of the vibrator. Starting in
the late l l )7()s. technology began to deliver a
new reality of satisfying sex for one. Women
were freed from the sex-partner paradigm.
Stay in, switch on, get off. A new wave of in
dependent women was unleashed.
The Toy appears to have set out to put
women back in their place. Conceived by the
Cool and Groovy Toy Company Ltd,The Toy
works like a very personal pager. Marketed
online exclusively to hetero couples, the girl
friend is expected to. erm. "load" The Toy at
the start of the day and wear it throughout.
This is no small feat, given that The Toy is the
width of a quarter and the length of an index
finger. Ouch.

As the girlfriend stiffly waddles about the
cubicle matrix that is her workplace, her
boyfriend presumably loafs around his cor
ner office and at some point sends a text mes
sage to her cell phone. As she reads the mes
sage,The Toy interprets the text as a series of
vibrations. Whereas the original vibrator was
conceived as a way for women to independ
ently explore their sexuality. The Toy clearly
aims to let Mr. Boyfriend reclaim control.
I really am not a rabid, militant, man-hat
ing fembot who is imagining things for the
sake of being political and/or provocative.
One has to look no further than
www.thetoy.co.uk to find evidence support
ing The Toy's true objective. The site is divid
ed into two sides. One side is labeled

"Ladies" and markets ITie Toy as a way for
girlfriends to have "a sexy physical connec
tion that stretches across the planet" — a
clear ploy that plays to the "female need" for
emotional intimacy.The other side of the site
is labeled "Gentlemen."The marketing is so
absurd that I think it's necessary to repro
duce the sales pitch in its entirety below:
Imagine a connection with your lover...
You command her arousal from afar
Imagine The Toy...
Monday morning — she leaves with The
Toy inside...
She's given you the power — You alone
control The Toy
Teasing her with single word messages
Frustrating her with smouldering long
fantasies
No matter how many text messages she
gets today.
Yours are the ones she really, really
WANTS!
Imagine the thrill of sending a sexy fanta
sy knowing she's in a meeting
Setting the scene for tonight throughout
the day

Imagine the desire in her eyes
when you meet again
Imagine the power, the control
Imagine her tire and the devastat
ing passion...
Roll on Monday morning!
You command her arousal from
afar? Imagine the power, the con
trol? Hot damn! While we're at it.
sign me up for a chastity belt and
some lotus feet! At a time when
many American women believe that
gender roles no longer stifle their ca
reers and general being. Hie Toy
seems like a callback to a more re
pressive past.
I am convinced that The Toy was
spawned by a posse of male scientists
who were pissed that their girl
friends owned vibrators and would
not let them join in 011 their private
time. I can just see some Professor
Frink-like dweeb,festering in a dank

laboratory, strumming his fingers to
gether and muttering, "With tech
nology as my weapon. I shall control
both my girlfriend and her vibra
tor.MWAH-HA-HA! HA-HA!
HA! Glaven "
1 would not be so riled up if this
gimmicky product had been a com
mercial Hop. Unfortunately,The Toy
has taken the United Kingdom by
storm, appearing 011 morning talk
shows ;ind ranking as a favorite item
in various adult shops. I fear that as
we are subject to the aftershocks of
the Valentine's Day-induced "ro
mantic" gift-giving. ITie Toy could be
viewet'i as the perfect present by
hoards of clueless American males.
I le;u me clearly, men of Stanford,
men of America: Your girlfriend
does not want to use this contraption
any more than you want to see the
movie "Because 1 Said So." She
might agree to try it out because she
sort-of likes you or because you have
pressured her through persistent
nagging. But it is highly unlikely that
she will enjoy having something the
si/e of a kosher dill pickle in her pei -
son throimhout the day.

Women like Susie Bright. Betty
Dodson and Gayle Rubin fought for
decades to make sexual parky just as
important as any other feminist
issue. A woman's sexual freedom is a
basic right, just like receiving equal
pay for equal work and letting her
body be her choice.
Men. it you really want to show
how much you like your lady friend,
you will let her use her Rabbit in
peace, unless otherwise invited. You
will instead give her a long back-rub
and tell her how much you value her
as an equal. Possibly, you will make
her dinner and do her laundry as she
studies for her midterms.
Women, il you really think that
gender parity is no longer an issue,
ask voui my friends about The Toy
and see what they have to say. 1 think
that their responses might surprise
you or it least make for an inter
esting chat.

conceived as a way for women to independ
ently explore their sexuality. The Toy clearly
aims to let Mr. Boyfriend reclaim control.
I really am not a rabid, militant, man-hat
ing fembot who is imagining things for the
sake of being political and/or provocative.
One has to look no further than
www.thetoy.co.uk to find evidence support
ing The Toy's true objective. The site is divid
ed into two sides. One side is labeled

"Ladies" and markets ITie Toy as a way for
girlfriends to have "a sexy physical connec
tion that stretches across the planet" — a
clear ploy that plays to the "female need" for
emotional intimacy.The other side of the site
is labeled "Gentlemen."The marketing is so
absurd that I think it's necessary to repro
duce the sales pitch in its entirety below:
Imagine a connection with your lover...
You command her arousal from afar
Imagine The Toy...
Monday morning — she leaves with The
Toy inside...
She's given you the power — You alone
control The Toy
Teasing her with single word messages
Frustrating her with smouldering long
fantasies
No matter how many text messages she
gets today.
Yours are the ones she really, really
WANTS!
Imagine the thrill of sending a sexy fanta
sy knowing she's in a meeting
Setting the scene for tonight throughout
the day

Foreplay for later...
Imagine the desire in her eyes
when you meet again
Imagine the power, the control
Imagine her tire and the devastat
ing passion...
Roll on Monday morning!
You command her arousal from
afar? Imagine the power, the con
trol? Hot damn! While we're at it.
sign me up for a chastity belt and
some lotus feet! At a time when
many American women believe that
gender roles no longer stifle their ca
reers and general being. Hie Toy
seems like a callback to a more re
pressive past.
I am convinced that The Toy was
spawned by a posse of male scientists
who were pissed that their girl
friends owned vibrators and would
not let them join in 011 their private
time. I can just see some Professor
Frink-like dweeb,festering in a dank

laboratory, strumming his fingers to
gether and muttering, "With tech
nology as my weapon. I shall control
both my girlfriend and her vibra
tor.MWAH-HA-HA! HA-HA!
HA! Glaven "
1 would not be so riled up if this
gimmicky product had been a com
mercial Hop. Unfortunately,The Toy
has taken the United Kingdom by
storm, appearing 011 morning talk
shows ;ind ranking as a favorite item
in various adult shops. I fear that as
we are subject to the aftershocks of
the Valentine's Day-induced "ro
mantic" gift-giving. ITie Toy could be
viewet'i as the perfect present by
hoards of clueless American males.
I le;u me clearly, men of Stanford,
men of America: Your girlfriend
does not want to use this contraption
any more than you want to see the
movie "Because 1 Said So." She
might agree to try it out because she
sort-of likes you or because you have
pressured her through persistent
nagging. But it is highly unlikely that
she will enjoy having something the
si/e of a kosher dill pickle in her pei -
son throimhout the day.

Women like Susie Bright. Betty
Dodson and Gayle Rubin fought for
decades to make sexual parky just as
important as any other feminist
issue. A woman's sexual freedom is a
basic right, just like receiving equal
pay for equal work and letting her
body be her choice.
Men. it you really want to show
how much you like your lady friend,
you will let her use her Rabbit in
peace, unless otherwise invited. You
will instead give her a long back-rub
and tell her how much you value her
as an equal. Possibly, you will make
her dinner and do her laundry as she
studies for her midterms.
Women, il you really think that
gender parity is no longer an issue,
ask voui my friends about The Toy
and see what they have to say. 1 think
that their responses might surprise
you or it least make for an inter
esting chat.
