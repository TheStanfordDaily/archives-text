After averaging 18.0 minutes per game
this season, freshman center Jayne Appel got
a starter's playing time on Thursday night and
showed what she could do with it.
Appel turned in a monstrous performance
in Corvallis, Ore. as the No. 9 Stanford
women's basketball team defeated Oregon
State. 70-55. She scored 28 points and pulled
down 17 rebounds in 33 minutes oft the bench
to set career-highs in all three of those cate
gories. Her fellow center, senior Brooke
Smith, chipped in with 22 points, six rebounds
and seven assists as the Cardinal completely
outmatched the Beavers in the post.
The last time Appel played 30 minutes in a
game she set her previous career-high for
points (23) against then-No. 4 Tennessee on
Nov. 24.
Stanford (22-4. 14-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) desperately needed a strong perform
ance from its frontcourt following another in
jury to its guard corps last Saturday. A week
after losing freshman point guard JJ Hones to
a season-ending right ACL tear, junior guard
Candice Wiggins re-aggravated a previous
ankle sprain while coming down after a shot
against Washington.
Freshman point guard Melanie Murphy
got the first start of her college career due to
the injuries, and put in another solid perform
ance in Hones' stead. Murphy had four points,
five assists and five steals while running the
offense for all but four minutes of the game.
In Stanford's previous 10 games, its oppo
nents came out of the gate cold, but both the
Cardinal and Oregon State (8-16, 3-12 Pac-

pointers at the first extended stoppage in play,
6:17 into the game.
1 lowever, OSU outstripped Stanford over
the next six minutes, building up a nine-point
lead before the Cardinal experienced its third
injury scare in three week s. A scrum under the
basket left sophomore forward Jillian Har
mon clutching her right knee in agony. She
had to be helped off the court by a trainer, al
though she would check back in later.
Stanford's players were visibly upset and
looked to be in danger of succumbing to the
same lack of focus that hurt them after Hones'
injury against California on Feb. 4. Instead,
they shut down Oregon State's offensive
game with a zone defense, which helped hold
