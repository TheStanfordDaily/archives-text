At tables in While Plaza, as well as in
Stern. Wilbur and I agunita dining halls

resentatives. I lie campus-wide event
will last from noon until <S p.m. and will
begin with a performance by liilisman in
White Plaza.
Students who sign three letters at
Moonbeans will get a free cup of eol'fee.
Ihe letters call on the U.S. govern
ment to impose sanctions on Sudan and
to put diplomatic pressure on the IJ.N.
to deploy the authorized peacekeeping
force without the consent of the Su
danese government; the letters also ask
the I ! .S. to commit to funding the effort
and for the North Atlantic Treaty ()rga
ni/ation (NAT()) member states to tle
ploy additional forces.
'Ilie purpose of the event is to re-en
ergize student activity on the Darfur
issue. STAND co-coordinator Nikki
Serapio'o7 warned against ennui on the
part of students, pointing to progress
over the years.
"It might seem that change is not
happening, but over the last two and a

hall years the liusli administration has
changed its position on I )arfur." he said.
" Iwo-and-half years ago they were sa\-
ing that this is an Alrican Union prob
lem. And now it has completed flip
flopped because (if constituent pressure
and the realization that we really need
multinational peace keepers in order to
stop genocide."
According to STAND co-coordina
tor l\lissa lest '07. peacekeepers are the
only way to end the genocide.
" ihe peacekeepers are entirely an
attempt to provide a real cease-fire."she
said. "There has been cease-fire after
cease-fire declared and broken. It's
been demonstrated time and again that
the only thing that will i\ ally end the vi
olence and make wa\ for a sustainable
peace agreement lo be reached is the
presence of a multi-national peace
keeping effort."
The Darlur conflict began in 2003
after a rebel uprising in the region b\
members of the I nr. Masalit and /a

ghawa tribes 'Hie conflict was declared a
genocide by then-l '.S. Secretary ol State
Colin Powell in 2004 after reports that
government-backed militias were tar
geting civilians belonging to the re
belling tribes.
Serapio said the humanitarian net
work. which provides four million
refugees with food and medicine, is
about to collapse due to securih prob
lems that contributed to the deaths of 13
aid workers last month.
"In the last lew weeks there were 14
humanitarian organizations that sent
out a letter," Serapio said."lt was a pret
ty unprecedented move, making it pub
lie that they're holding the line on Dar
lur. Ihey re saying that if that humani
tarian system [does] not receive ade
quate protection, it will collapse entire
ly II that happens, it's simple; it's mil
lions of people dead."
