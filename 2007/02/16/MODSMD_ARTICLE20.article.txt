# Not Goods enough?

### 
What a difference a week
makes. Seriously. A little
over a week ago, Stanford
looked as if it were a cinch for the
NCAA Tournament. Coming off a
dominating 19-point victory at Cal,
just a week after the stunning UCLA
upset, things couldn't have been bet
ter for Stanford basketball.
Even ESPN's so called "bracketol
ogist,"Joe Lunardi. whose predictions
tend to be quite accurate, had Stan
ford listed as a solid six seed.
The last three weeks have been a
microcosm of the whole season for
Stanford basketball. First, two huge
wins against a pair of top-25 teams,
USC and UCLA. When fans stormed
the court for the first time this season,
things couldn't have been better for
the Cardinal.
Then came the loss to Gonzaga. It
wasn't a horrible loss at the time, but,
still, a loss is never a good thing. Then
the shellacking of Cal. Things looked
like they had really come together for
the Card after its minor, hiccup-ish
loss against the Zags.
Oops.
For whatever reason, Stanford did
n't come out to play this past week
end, as the Cougars and Huskies
handed out beatings to coach Trent
Johnson's squad. The injury to guard
Anthony Goods — quite possibly the
most integral part of the Cardinal's
successes this season — in the Wash
ington game only made things worse.
But even the absence of Goods
can't explain this cataclysmic drop-off
in performance.The Cardinal was out
of sync and out of place in its Wash
ington contests, averaging an anemic
48.5 points per game. And that kind of
offensive production won't ever get
the job done in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence.
After a weekend wasted in Wash
ington and the devestating injury to
Goods, the Cardinal is clearly no
longer a lock for the Big Dance. The
team's current record stands at 16-8,
and more than two losses in the re
maining five games could possibly
jeopardize Stanford's chances of mak
ing the tournament as an at-large seed

Above the Rim
It's been the story of Stanford's
season. ITiis team may be the most in
consistent in college basketball.
Is it possible to reconcile the deba
cle of a 34-point loss against Air Force
and a beat down at the hands of the
mighty Broncos of Santa Clara with
remarkable wins against USC. Wash
ington State and UCLA? In some
games. Stanford has looked as though
it can compete with the best teams in
all of college basketball. 'Ihe shots
dropped, the passes were crisp and
the defense was tough. But in others,
the Cardinal looked like it would
have had trouble against a Canadian
team.
And. indeed, the exhibition con
test against the formidable Universi
ty of British Columbia basketball
team was fairly close for awhile.
I guess it's just how this Cardinal
team functions. Hie only consistent
thing about Stanford this year is its in
consistency.
ITie Cardinal now finds itself in a
tough situation. At one point, Stan
lord had pretty much played its way
out of the tournament. Then, the
squad played its way back in. Now?

Who knows. With a record of 16-B,the
Cardinal could very well be on the
"bubble" when Selection Sunday
comes around.
Worse. Goods has been huge for
the team all year, making the kind of
shots that you just aren't supposed to
make. I le may be streaky, but. more
than anyone else on the team, he's
been the sparkplug. From a basket
ball perspective, lie's really the only
legitimate threat that the Cardinal
has from beyond the arc right now;
without his presence, it's going to be a
lot easier lor teams to key in on the
I opez twins if another three-point
threat fails to emerge.
In the face of all of this, the Cardi
nal has a chance to make a statement
this weekend against the Oregon
schools. Nothing would be better for
the state of this team and its tourna
ment hopes than to sweep the
Beavers and the Ducks. So after last
night's 70-55 win over Oregon State,
tomorrow's match-up against No. 15
()regon will be a real gut check.
But 1 guess, no matter what hap
pens. I can't complain. You never re
ally know what you're going to get
from Stanford basketball.
