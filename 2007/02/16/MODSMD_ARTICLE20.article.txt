# Not Goods enough?

What a difference a week
makes. Seriously. A little
over a week ago, Stanford
looked as if it were a cinch for the
NCAA Tournament. Coming off a
dominating 19-point victory at Cal,
just a week after the stunning UCLA
upset, things couldn't have been bet
ter for Stanford basketball.
Even ESPN's so called "bracketol
ogist,"Joe Lunardi. whose predictions
tend to be quite accurate, had Stan
ford listed as a solid six seed.
The last three weeks have been a
microcosm of the whole season for
Stanford basketball. First, two huge
wins against a pair of top-25 teams,
USC and UCLA. When fans stormed
the court for the first time this season,
things couldn't have been better for
the Cardinal.
Then came the loss to Gonzaga. It
wasn't a horrible loss at the time, but,
still, a loss is never a good thing. Then
the shellacking of Cal. Things looked
like they had really come together for
the Card after its minor, hiccup-ish
loss against the Zags.
Oops.
For whatever reason, Stanford did
n't come out to play this past week
end, as the Cougars and Huskies
handed out beatings to coach Trent
Johnson's squad. The injury to guard
Anthony Goods — quite possibly the
most integral part of the Cardinal's
successes this season — in the Wash
ington game only made things worse.
But even the absence of Goods
can't explain this cataclysmic drop-off
in performance.The Cardinal was out
of sync and out of place in its Wash
ington contests, averaging an anemic
48.5 points per game. And that kind of
offensive production won't ever get
the job done in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence.
After a weekend wasted in Wash
ington and the devestating injury to
Goods, the Cardinal is clearly no
longer a lock for the Big Dance. The
team's current record stands at 16-8,
and more than two losses in the re
maining five games could possibly
jeopardize Stanford's chances of mak
ing the tournament as an at-large seed
