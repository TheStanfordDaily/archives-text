## TEXAS-SIZE SERIES Cardinal gear up to face No. 14 Longhorns in Austin 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
For Stanford baseball, this weekend's
series at Texas will be a critical barometer
for measuring where the Cardinal stands
talent-wise early in the season.
For freshman righthander Brandt
Walker, it will mean fulfilling a life-long
dream.
Walker grew up in Austin, a stone's
throw away from the University of Texas
campus. But while his friends dreamed of
one day playing for the Longhc >rns, Walk
er aspired to someday wear cardinal and
white instead of burnt orange.
"Playing against Texas is something
I've been looking forward to for a long
time now," Walker said. "Texas is always a
big series for us, and this weekend is going

to be a great atmosphere, filled with ram
bunctious fans."
Stanford (2-3) was swept in its opening
series at C'al State-Fullerton but answered
back against Fresno State, as the team
swept a two-game set this past weekend.
Last Tuesday, the Cardinal defeated
Tokyo's Rikkio University.s-1, in an exhi
bition at Sunken Diamond.
"These past three games gave us a lot
of confidence heading to Texas," Walker
said. "We played some solid games and
have a ton of momentum."
Junior catcher Brian Juhl's bat contin
ues to fuel the Cardinal's offense with a
.389 batting average. Sophomore infielder
Austin Yount is batting .350 with a team
leading four RBI. but pre-season All-
American slugger Michael Taylor has
been limited to .250 with four RBI.
"We're going to see some great compe
tition in Texas," sophomore infielder
Jason Castro said. "We're going to try to
do our best pitching-wise, and hopefully
our hitting will be able to take care of it
self."
Castro himself had a coming-out party

Wednesday,going 3-4 with one RBI in his
first game back from injury this season. As
a team, the Cardinal is hitting .344 with 32
RBI.
Stanford pitching has also gotten the
job done recently, recording a staff E-RA
of 7.07 â€” a number inflated by Fuller
ton's offensive explosion two weeks ago.
"We're fortunate our pitchers haven't
walked too many, but Ve haven't done a
great job locating our pitches, so we've al
lowed a lot of hits," head coach Mark Mar
quess said. "We're going to need to pitch
better against Texas and play good, solid
baseball. You need to play quality games
on the road because, otherwise, such great
teams are going to burn you. It'll be a good
test for us and let us know where we need
to be."
No. 14Texas (4-4) enters the weekend
hitting .314 with a 4.23 staff HRA.Today's
first pitch is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. PT in
Austin.Texas, with an 11 a.m. PT start time
for both Saturday and Sunday.

GAME. NOTES: The Cardinal have bounced back
since being swept by Cal State Fullerton to start
the season, notching a pair of victories over Fres
no State and an exhibition win against Japan's
Rikkio University. Although Preseason Ail-Ameri
can Michael Taylor has gotten off to a slow start,
batting .250, lie leads the team with six runs
scored and is tied for the team lead in RBI with
four. Catcher Brian Juhl has picked up the slack
offensively, and his .476 OBP leads the Cardinal.
Starting pitching has been a major difficulty for
Stanford early in the season, as no starter has an
ERA under 5.50.
