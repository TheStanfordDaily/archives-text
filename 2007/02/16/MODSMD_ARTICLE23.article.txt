" Iliey're deep — they're two of the three [other]
teams that make the Pac-10 so tough. Each team has
really highly ranked No. 1 and 2 players — they're
dangerous for sure."
"They're both really great teams," Forood added."l

rankings], even if they're not currently ranked there."

talent among the Cardinal's Pac-10 rivals.
"They have a lot of tricky players," Logar said.

us, whether it's going to be hard hitting or a lot of spin.
They're not going to be easy matches."
