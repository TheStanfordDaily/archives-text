GAME NOTES: The Cardinal's streak of
89 consecutive match victories came
to an end on Feb. 3, but Stanford will
have the chance to start a new streak
today against conference rival USC.
After the Yellow Jackets lost to No. 25
William & Mary, the Cardinal regained
their No. 1 spot in the national rank
ings. Stanford is led by No. 8 Jessica
Nguyen, who boasts a 13-4 record,
and No. 89 Theresa Logar, who has
earned a 10-4 record to start the year
and is likely to see her national rank
improve in the near future.

fired up. and really positive. We're ready to go after
these guys."
Stanford (3-1) has not competed in match play in
nearly two weeks, hut. according to Coach Lele
Forood, that could he to the Cardinal's advantage.
"We're really anxious to get going again," Forood
said/'That's what the mood is. We really look forward
to being finally able to play."
ITie matches against the team's Southern Califor
nia conference rivals could mean a lot for Stanford.
Both USC (5-0) and UCLA (5-2) are nationally
ranked, and. moreover, the matches will mark the
opening of the Pac-10 season for the Cardinal.
Burdette spoke about the challenge that Stanford
expects to face against the two Los Angeles schools.
"They're really tough teams," Burdette said.
" Iliey're deep — they're two of the three [other]
teams that make the Pac-10 so tough. Each team has
really highly ranked No. 1 and 2 players — they're
dangerous for sure."
"They're both really great teams," Forood added."l
fully expect them to be in the top 10 [of the national
rankings], even if they're not currently ranked there."
Senior llieresa Logar elaborated on the depth of
talent among the Cardinal's Pac-10 rivals.
"They have a lot of tricky players," Logar said.
"Fverv girl 's going to pose some sort of challenge for
us, whether it's going to be hard hitting or a lot of spin.
They're not going to be easy matches."
In particular, both the Bruins and
the Lady Trojans could give Stanford
trouble with its Nos. I and 2 players.
Lindsey Nelson. USC's top player,
was ranked No. 8 in the ITA presea
son singles rankings;she is known for
her offensive power.
"She hits really big off the ground
— she's definitely beatable, though,"
Burdette said.
"Lindsey is arguably the best
player in the country right now."
Forood added. "She's going to be
tough to handle. Their lineup is very
solid all the way down, too — it's not
like it's just her. She just happens to
be the name on the top, but they have
quality players all the way down."
Logar. currently playing in the
No. I slot for the Cardinal, comment
ed on the challenge that she expects
to see from the highly-touted Nel
son.
"I have a solid game, as does
she." Logar said. "We both match
up well against each other, and it'll
be a battle. It's going to be tough,
and I think that both of us will try to
really tug each other around on the
court."
UCLA also features talent at the

top of its lineup in freshman Yasmin
Shnack and junior Riza Zalameda.
Both players are nationally ranked
and should provide the Cardinal
with a formidable challenge.
"On any given day, [Zalameda is |
as good as anybody," Forood said.
"She presents a good obstacle to us."
Aside from its opponents, Stan
ford will also be battling injuries and
illness. According to Burdette's, the
team's lineup of six players is cui
rently "tight." I brood, however, was
confident in her team's ability to
compete.even given the current state
of her roster.
"We're going to be ready to play
tomorrow," she said.
In any case, the upcoming match
es should be a good test for the ('at
dinal, giving Stanford a chance to re
establish its dominance both on re
gional and national levels.
Stanford is slated to face I ISC
today at 1:30 p.m., followed by
UCLA tomorrow at noon. Both
matches will take place at theTaube
Family Tennis Center.
