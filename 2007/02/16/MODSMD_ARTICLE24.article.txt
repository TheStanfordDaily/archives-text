# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Elements set No. 5 Stanford back 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It had been nearly four months since the No. 5 Stan
ford women's golf team last played in a tournament. In
2006,Golfweek magazine ranked the squad fifth in the
nation after strong performances at the Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invitational and the Stanford Intercollegiate.
It is safe to say that expectations for the Cardinal were
high.
In a rough start to the year, however, the team en
tered its spring season with a sub-par eighth-place fin
ish at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge
held at the Palos Verdes Golf Club (par 71, 5,912
yards).
Head coach Caroline O'Connor dismissed the no
tion that Stanford's troubles stemmed from the long
time off.
"We were definitely rusty around the greens and
with our short game, which typically is the strongest
part of all of our games." O'Connor said. "There was
some rust from not competing, but I wouldn't say that's
why we didn't play well."
The weather, according to O'Connor, played a big
ger role in the Cardinal's setback.
"The wind was gusting up to 40 mph on both Mon
day and Tuesday when we were going through some
tough stretches of golf for us, and we didn't really adjust
to it." she said. "That really made putting very difficult,
especially on the small elevated greens. It was very
cold, too."
The Palos Verdes Golf Club also features a rare
playing surface, Kakuya grass, that may have affected
Stanford's play.
"The Kakuya grass, which they have down and
around the greens, was something we're not accus
tomed to playing on," O'Connor said. "It can definite

ly be tricky and really affect your shot,and we didn't re
ally adjust. It's a much different grass from what we see
up here and what most of our players will ever see.
You've got to spend a lot of time practicing on it to get
a feel for it."
The Cardinal competed Monday through Wednes
day against a field of 15 schools. 14 of them ranked in
the top 50 and five in the top 10 nationally. Pacific-10
Conference opponents included No. 2 Arizona State,
No. 10 UCLA and No. 14 Southern California. Among
the highly ranked non-conference opponents were No.
8 Pepperdine and No. 9 Oklahoma State.
O'Connor stressed the importance of competing
against the elite teams in the nation.
"1 believe in always playing against the best teams in
the country," she said. "Our strength of schedule is
fourth-toughest in the country. If you want to be the
best.you have to play against the best and beat the best,
week in, week out. Our tournaments in the fall were
against the best fields, and our tournaments in the
spring will be against the best fields."
After three rounds of competition, Pepperdine
(297-297-288 â€”882) took home the team title with a
commanding wire-to-wire victory.The Waves were led
by freshman Misun Cho, whose two-under-par 69 cata
pulted her from 10th to first place overall. It was a one
stroke victory for Cho over five different players tied
for second.
Despite ending the first and second rounds in sev
enth. Stanford finished eighth with a three-round total
of 915 (305-307-303).
"It's just one of those weeks where things don't
come together," said O'Connor."We had an opportu
nity going into the final day where we legitimately
could have finished top three or four had we played our

Jennifer Tangtiphailboontana tied for 14th overall, with a three round score of 223. Stanford next heads to the Arizona Wild
cat Invitational on Feb. 26 in Tucson, Ariz., after finishing eigth at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge.
