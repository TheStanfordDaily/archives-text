## Card seek revenge in MPSF 
### ROXIE DICKINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off a disappointing pair of
losses in Southern California, the
Stanford men's volleyball squad
looks to start the second half of its
conference season strong with a
come-back in its home rematches
against No. 4 UC-Irvine and No. 6

UCLA this weekend. The Anteaters
and Bruins each swept the Cardinal
last weekend.
"Basically, we are really looking
forward to this weekend," coach John
Kosty said. "We knew that we had the
opportunities to win last week â€”
with a couple changes, we feel confi
dent that we can get a win going into
the matches this weekend."

UC-Irvine (12-3,7-3 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) features a
lineup dominated by seniors and has
many players holding some of the top
spots in the MPSF statistics. Senior
David Smith holds the No. 1 rank in
hitting percentage (.551) and the
fourth spot in blocks. Senior Brian
Thornton is ranked sixth in assists
with a 12.84 per-game average.To top
it off,seniors Matt Webber and Jayson
Jalonsky hold the third and sixth
spots, respectively, in aces.
Although Irvine holds an impres
sive 7-3 record, the Cardinal (1-13.1-8
MPSF) made the Anteaters work for
their win last week, holding them to
the three game scores of 30-28.30-22
and 30-22.
"Against Irvine, we had our
chances to win, especially in the first
game." Kosty said. "We have already
played them twice, so we know them
pretty well and feel prepared going
into the match."
IJCLA (7-6,5-5 MPSF) will be an
other tough matchup for Stanford this
weekend. Steve Klosterman leads the
Bruins and is ranked ninth in the con
ference in aces. Last week's match
