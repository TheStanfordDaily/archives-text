start to down Oregon State 70-55 hist night in Maples Pavilion in a
game that could only he described .is a tale of two halves.
"It's very obvious that we were strugglingearly." head coach'l rent
Johnson said. "I think the kills were a little tight But they relaxed,
came out in the second half, and played better basketball."
Sophomore forward I awrenee 11 ill regained his offensive stroke,
leading the ( ardinal (16-8.8-5 Pacific-10 Conference) with 23 points.
I reshman forward Brook I .ope/ added 20,and the pair combined to
score 30 of Stanford's 44 second-half points.
"We just have to find ;i happy medium," I lill said."between play
ing within ourselves and making plays."
While Stanford's offense w;is dormant early, its defense was dom
inant throughout. Junior forward Marcel Jones led Oregon State (10-
17.2-12) with 13 points, but his team shot a mere 32.3 percent from
the field and was 3-for-20 from beyond the three-point arc (15 per
cent). Junior forward Sas;i ( uic. averaging 12.3 points per game, was
shut out on 0-for-10shooting.
"I thought,defensively, we were pretty good today." Johnson said.
Offensively, it was a different story. Stanford committed eight
turnovers in the first six minutes of the game, and finished the half
with Ift. Ilie team scraped out a 2ft-22 lead at intermission.shooting
34.N percent anil missing all five ol its three-point attempts in the
opening stanza.
"I think for the most part that's what happens when you have a
group of guys that have a tendency to over-try and want to win so
bad." Johnson said."But it'seasier s;iid than done."
Iliat changed in the second half. Ilie Cardinal broke awa\ for
good with a 21-ft run midway through the period, powered by II
points from Brook I opt/ during the span.
"I think we just picked up our intensity," I ope/ said." Ihe bench
picked it up, and the crowd was into it."
