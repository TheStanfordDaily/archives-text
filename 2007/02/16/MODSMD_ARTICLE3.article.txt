Stepping in for the injured Goods, Mitch
Johnson scored two points on a pair of free
throws. But the sophomore guard led the team
with eight rebounds and four assists on the night.
Redshirt sophomore Kenny Brown made the
most of his 17 minutes, taking five shots but hit

"It's very obvious that we were strugglingearly." head coach'l rent
Johnson said. "I think the kills were a little tight But they relaxed,
came out in the second half, and played better basketball."

leading the ( ardinal (16-8.8-5 Pacific-10 Conference) with 23 points.
I reshman forward Brook I .ope/ added 20,and the pair combined to
score 30 of Stanford's 44 second-half points.
"We just have to find ;i happy medium," I lill said."between play
ing within ourselves and making plays."
While Stanford's offense w;is dormant early, its defense was dom
inant throughout. Junior forward Marcel Jones led Oregon State (10-
17.2-12) with 13 points, but his team shot a mere 32.3 percent from
the field and was 3-for-20 from beyond the three-point arc (15 per
cent). Junior forward Sas;i ( uic. averaging 12.3 points per game, was
shut out on 0-for-10shooting.
"I thought,defensively, we were pretty good today." Johnson said.
Offensively, it was a different story. Stanford committed eight
turnovers in the first six minutes of the game, and finished the half
with Ift. Ilie team scraped out a 2ft-22 lead at intermission.shooting
34.N percent anil missing all five ol its three-point attempts in the
opening stanza.
"I think for the most part that's what happens when you have a
group of guys that have a tendency to over-try and want to win so
bad." Johnson said."But it'seasier s;iid than done."
Iliat changed in the second half. Ilie Cardinal broke awa\ for
good with a 21-ft run midway through the period, powered by II
points from Brook I opt/ during the span.
"I think we just picked up our intensity," I ope/ said." Ihe bench
picked it up, and the crowd was into it."

while netting 16 assists.
"It's been a long season so far," I lill said."lt's
not like we don't know what we have to do."
Stepping in for the injured Goods, Mitch
Johnson scored two points on a pair of free
throws. But the sophomore guard led the team
with eight rebounds and four assists on the night.
Redshirt sophomore Kenny Brown made the
most of his 17 minutes, taking five shots but hit
ting a three-pointer that kicked off the Cardi

"I le wasn't afraid to shoot it.That's not some
thing Kenny is,"Trent Johnson said."He's taking
advantage of his opportunity. We'll see what
happens Saturday."

But the coach, as always, is taking the season
one game at a time.
"A win is a win," Johnson said. "A win is a
