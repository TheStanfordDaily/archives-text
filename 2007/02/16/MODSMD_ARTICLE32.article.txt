# V-Day: Funding terror?
## 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION LOVE HATER 
I believe that somewhere buried beneath the surface of
the earth in a heavily fortified underground lair, the terror
ists are cashing in on Valentine's Day. There can be no
other explanation for why every year, millions of Ameri
cans (specifically male) crack open their wallets and shell

out huge wads of cash on inane
and meaningless gifts, flowers
and ritzy dinners. Valentine's
Day is no longer the whole
some, love-filled lovable
holiday of yesteryear — it
is the battleground upon
which mankind (and specifi
cally man kind) wages a never
ending fight against an unbeat
able foe.
Why are the terrorists behind
this plot? By process of
elimination, the answer
is simple. Certainly it
could not be the female
segment of the popula
tion. Although they ben
efit the most from a mate
rial standpoint, they have to
reciprocate in direct correla
tion to the size and cost of the
gift — at least that's the theory men
subscribe to and one that is quite dis
tasteful if the "Vagina Monologues" is to
be believed.

While many have theorized to the contrary, the
mega-corporate monster known as 1 lallmark is also not
behind Valentine's Day. Sure they make millions of dollars
selling blood-tinged paraphernalia printed with the most
saccharine messages imaginable ("I wuv you," indeed) but
in actuality, it doesn't add up. Every year, men have to pur
chase increasingly more ornate and expensive gilts in order
to keep their partners happy. Eventually, this ever expand
ing bubble will burst and Hallmark will be left without a
junkie to whom they can peddle their poisons. It's simple
economics... or so I'm told since I'm an English major.
So again, why terrorists? Because they have the most to
gain. Have you ever heard of Valentine's Day in Soviet

Russia? No. Granted, this may be because terrorism as we
know it today did not exist in its current form during the j
Cold War. Nevertheless, there is no Valentine's Day in So- ,
viel Russia. Air-tight argument, if I do say so myself.
Cupid is not a baby with bow that makes you fall in love. !
Cupid is a terrorist with an explosive-tipped arrow waiting
to pierce the heart and soul of America.
The terrorists don't care about love. They only

want to create chaos. What better way to cre
ate chaos amongst an organized society
(the U.S.A. . . . that's "us" with an
extra A) than to sneakily con
vince half of the country's pop
ulation that if they don't pur
chase something, their
partner will break up
them and leave them de
jected and in the rain?
The threat of a scold
ing from a girlfriend
whose boyfriend
just forgot to get
flowers plants the
very seed from which
full-blown pandemo
nium erupts. While
the hapless boyfriend
concentrates on sooth- I
ing the girlfriend's hurl I
emotions (i.e.. hatred,) he !
is clearly not going to be doing !
his work, right? What if he !
works in say, the Pentagon? His dis
traction while trying to abate his girl jj

friend's anger sets up all kinds of mental
and emotional roadblocks, weighing down our country's
terror fighting ability. That's a massive breach in national
security that the terrorists are just waiting to exploit.
So, America — listen up. This Valentine's Day, do your
God-given duty to your country and refuse to buy into the
terrorist plot. Ignore the fact that 1 will be cold, alone and
without the possibility for companionship and realize that
1 am telling you the unadulterated truth. And to the girl
friends out (here — don't let your boyfriends buy you any
thing. If you let them buy you a Valentine's
gift/card/chocolate/bundle of flowers/diamond necklace,
the terrorists win.
