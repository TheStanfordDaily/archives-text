## So you're alone on V-Day: time for a chick flick 
### ELIZABETH FOX INTERMISSION CHICK 
I In the grand scheme of Valentine's Day traditions, which rank chocolate and flowers so high,
we must not forget that other great ritual: the male sacrifice of entertainment preferences for
the sake of that most powerful of beings, the girlfriend.
While Britney Spears concerts may no longer be de rigueur, an equally chivalrous act of af
fection is always a good idea. Likewise, for those women
who happen to be single on Valentine's Day, the great
tradition of wallowing and/or celebrating indepen-
I dence should culminate in something extraordinarily
1 embarrassing, sweet or girly — the equivalent of
chocolate in action. It is for these purposes, I am con
vinced, that chick flicks were invented.
Really, what an excellent way to please girls and to
make their boyfriends suffer beyond belief! (I have to
acknowledge, though, that certain male friends, when
drunk, have admitted a soft spot for a particularly
amazing chick flick.) All follow the same standard boy
meets-girl formula, with a few twists thrown in as to
exactly how soon boy gets girl and which partic
ular obstacles appear in their way. In the end,
' though, most achieve the same cotton-candy fluff
conclusion, which is precisely what makes them so
i perfect for a sugarcoated Valentine's Day.
In light of the holiday, then, I consider it no
more than my duty to highlight a few classics. Girls,
i rejoice: guys, take notes.
"Bridget Jones's Diary" (2001) —It should be first
and foremost on any chick Hick list. The combined
megawatt power of Colin Firth and Hugh Grant in
the cast should make this clear, even to anyone who
misses the romantic plot and the "I'm every
woman" idealism. An extra attraction for those
single on Valentine's Day is the opening, in which
Renee Zellweger sings "All By Myself." Bui don't
1 wallow — just consider that there's no significant
pother there to make you sutler through "Ameri
can Psycho" later on.

"Chocolat" (2005)
— Brilliant in
its Valentinc
y combina
tion of
chick flick
prowess
and the

holiday theme of chocolate everything. Additional bonus it it is watched while actually con
suming chocolate, since that qualifies as "getting into the spirit of things."
"She's the Man" (2006) — Apparently, I am one of only three people in existence who actually
likes this movie. Still, if you arc one of the other two, enjoy. Plus, there's no better way to tell if
your boyfriend really loves you than to ask him to sit through the entire thing without wincing.
"Shakespeare in Love" (1998) — This movie has the distinction of being one that guys arc gen
erally willing to admit that they like. It probably has something to do with sword fighting being
at least marginally involved, although that's always appeared to me to be more an excuse than
an explanation. Still, the awe-inspiring combination of Romeo and Juliet, Joseph Feinnes and
a teary ending are enough to make chick Hick history.
"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" (2003) — Old school chick flick, 1 know, and to connoisseurs,
generally assumed to have gone the way of "Bring It On" and the cuckoo bird, but still a clas
sic. While the pretext of a plot fulfills girlish fantasies about working at a fashion magazine, the
real point of the movie is Matthew McConaughey. Not good for jealous boyfriends.
"Moulin Rouge" (2001) — The chick flick to end all chick flicks. Perfect as reverse psycholo
gy for the lonely Valentine-less since it proves that love always ends badly, albeit after some

cool costumes and great singing. Those who are naturally
weepy and watching with a significant other should
tread carefully here. Crying often makes the nose
turn red and swell, which is never attractive.
"Sleepless in Seattle" (1993) — Another
chick tlick clever and sweet enough so that
both guys and girls can admit to liking it
with very little shame. Meg Ryan and
Tom Hanks are adorable. The Valen
tine's Day tie-in at the end is an added
bonus — make the most of it.
In the end of course, Valentine's Day is
what you make of it. Whether that in
eludes a chick flick or not is entirely up
to you. with reference to time, inclina
tion and how much one is in the doghouse
as a post-gift. But if there were ever a time
to break away from "Braveheart" in favor
of candy, sugar and
fluff, it's now. Em
brace the cinna
mon heart spirit.
and enjoy!
