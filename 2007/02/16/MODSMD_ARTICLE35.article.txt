# Hayes: He's no 'fraud' in the art of love
## 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION HAYES HISTORIAN 
As every intelligent, mature woman knows, many qualities
go into making the ideal mate: brains, charm, genetic predispo
sition against male pattern baldness

and, of course, money. Not how
much he has — this is Stanford, not
USC — but how he looks on it. This
Valentine's Day I'm not looking to
snare myself a frat boy or hunkv
Computer Science major. I want a
president and will settle for nothing
less than the best.
When choosing an Oval Office
amour, a few obvious options ran
through my head. Bill Clinton is a
hottie, but could I really deal with a
romantic V-Day dinner at a West
Harlem McDonald's? Hillary
might steal my fries. Or the 2008
election. Warren G. Harding, ar
guably the most ineffective US
president on record, posed another
intriguing option: Perhaps less ac
tion in the presidency means more
action for "His Presidency." And
who could forget Zachary "Old
Rough and Ready" Taylor? Cer
tainly not Millard "Ouch" Fillmore,
if the rumors arc true.
Hut after careful consideration, I
candidates: President Rutherford

Seven, they used to call him — great irrigator of the savage
Western lands and, perhaps, uncivilized East Coast ladies?
I've already started composing the note: "Dear Prospective
Valentine, You probably don't know who 1 am. but, the thing is.
I love you. You have already been inaugurated in my heart. Stay

another term, Valentine?"
Just to be clear, that is the letter he
would send to me, not the other way
around. Frankly. I'd estimate that
about 10 living people in the world
know or care about our exonerated
19th president. But there are several
reasons why he's a whole baker's dozen
of stud muffin.
For starters, ladies, although he
looks like an ascot-wearing, ZZ-Top
bcarded, portly old dead guy, Ruther
ford was something of a feminist in his
day. In 1879. he signed a bill allowing fe
male attorneys to argue cases before
the Supreme Court, granting unprece
dented political power to the fair sex —
something that modern-day Republi
cans have probably regretted over the
years.
Unfortunately, one of the reasons
he was so pro-women was his own wife:
"Lemonade" Lucy Hayes, a deeply reli
gious teetotaler who started the old tra
dition of giving the peasants an Easier

treat by letting them roll eggs around her neatly manicured
found the true candidate of lawn once a year. How anyone conceived of this while sober is
B. Haves. Old Eight to bcvondme. While I'm usually a little hesitant about homing in

as The Other Woman, I'm hoping her death a little over 100
years ago has cooled his ardor. Plus, never underestimate the
importance of a man who has already been well-trained.
The hottest thing about Rutherford B. Hayes, though, is his
fortitude under times of great duress. If this whole inter-centu
ry romance works out, he's going to need that to deal with meet
ing my parents. Rutherford won the presidency (and my heart)
in the hotly contested election of 1877 when he ran against
Sammy "Sassypants" Tilden in one of the most flagrantly un
scrupulous political misadventures of all time. Apparently
Sammy the Scoundrel won the popular election by a margin of
250,000 votes but was one electoral vote shy, so the government
jumped into action and formed an electoral committee that —
after the coincidental misplacement of a few thousand dollars of
federal money — just happened to elect Hayes as the victor.
Thank God we've improved the electoral system since then.
The public gave him the razzing of a lifetime, calling him
mean names like "Rutherfraud" and "President De Facto." 1 le
was also, inexplicably, referred to as "Queen Victoria in Riding
Breeches" in some prominent journals of the time. A Google
image search neither confirms nor denies the resemblance.
Not only does he come with a built-in bonanza of cutesy
nicknames ("Do you want some more lemonade, your fraudu
lency?"), but I'm guessing over a century after the limelight of
his administration faded, he's getting pretty anxious for some
one to start talking about him again, period. With all the scan
dal and yellow journalism surrounding our (occasionally illegit
imately) elected leaders, we sometimes forget to see them as
real men with real fears and dreams — but the whole point of
Valentine's Day is to love people for what they truly are. In this
case, socially irrelevant old Republicans with absurdly long
beards. Now if only 1 can find a linen store to buy a set of "Hayes
and Hers" towels.
