### CHRISTINA McCLENDON INTERMISSION PUNCHER 
Sondre Lerche's "Phantom Punch"
For the song "A Hard Day's Night,"
The Beatles set to music a scene of them
selves running from screaming fans. In
the video for "Phantom Punch,'' Sondre
Lerche (pronounced son-druh lair-key)
and his band also run in a pack away
from strangers — however, they are run
ning in a bizarre dream world, not Lon
don; and their pursuers are not teen fans,
but people wearing horse heads.
It would be unwise to consider this a
coincidence. Lerche's influences range
from Cole Porter, a devastatingly witty
and urbane songwriter from the 1920s to
the 19505, to Burt Bachrach, whom you
probably know from his cameo in
"Austin Powers," to Elvis Costello, with
whom Lerche recently toured. All of
these influences might bog a lesser musi
cian down in slavish recreation, but

Lcrchc assimilates them all in his own
offbeat style and humor — like mixing
The Beatles with horse heads.
Most importantly, he writes fun music.
He overlays catchy hooks with charming,
offbeat lyrics (sometimes it's hard to tell
if he's being goofy or if it's a crack in his
English) and delivered with guileless,
heart-on-his-sleeve phrasing. All of this
makes you want to dance around in your
underwear playing air'guitar and singing
into your hairbrush. "Phantom Punch"
(2007), his fourth and newest full-length
album (after "Faces Down" (2002),
"Two Way Monologue" (2004) and
"Duper Sessions" (2006), for the last of
which he slicked his hair back and played
crooner) brings the sweet guitar licks
and lilting vocals that have endeared
Lerche to his fans. But on the title track,
he incorporates prickly electric guitar
riffs and a dance-club beat — innova
tions for his style that don't sound as if
they should work with his previously
symphonic, lay-

ered melodies but
nevertheless do.
The layers have
become crunchier
and rougher, but
they haven't gope
anywhere.
Lerche's music
offers the sheer
sonic pleasure of
discovery — dis
covering a new
quirk, a new
clever touch with
every listening.
"Phantom
Punch" brings ag
gressive, hard
driving rock to his
previous layered
melodies but re
tains their com
plexity. Just as
every song offers
unexpected
touches and
twists, Lerche's
music grows and
changes with
every new album, .
making him a fas
cinating and ad
dictive songwriter
to listen to within
each song and to
watch throughout
his career.
