# New mix on the Bloc
## 
### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION PARTY GEN 
Bloc Party is one of the few bands that has
released a strong debut CD. albeit a little
bland and uniform, that was topped by a
subsequent remix album. That's right.
"Silent Alarm" has been a frequent choice
on my iTunes collection, but "Silent Alarm
Remixed" has been even more so. The first
album was sonically sparse and beat-heavy,
putting Bloc Parly squarely in the vague cat
egory of "indie dance pop," populated by
other bands like Fran/ Ferdinand (who was
actually responsible for Bloc Party's initial
rise from garage-band status).
The music was catchy, and the band was
on the cusp of transcending indie obscurity
— NME named "Silent Alarm" the 2005
Album of the Year, for example — but that
transcendence has only taken place in
Britain so far. They are still relatively un
known in the States. The band's accessibili
ty on its prior effort was a key selling point,
as the simplistic and clean guitars were a
marked difference from bands like Interpol
and Maximo Park. The fact that "Silent
Alarm Remixed" is better than the original
suggests the band's original creative effort
might work better in the electronic realm.
MB3, Mogwai, Four Tet and others all con
tributed remixes.
"A Weekend in the City" is the band's at
tempt to move their music away from fast
paced repetitive guitar-and-drum-work in
order to create a more expansive sound.
The band is trying hard to achieve some
thing significant and serious — as they do
so. they actually head back in the direction
of Interpol (and maybe Radiohead) and
away from Fran/. Ferdinand. Tackling more
serious material, both musically and lyrical

ly. should enhance and expand their staying
power outside of the British rock and Amer
ican indie music scenes.
The first song, "Song For Clay (Disappear
Here)" makes it clear this remix album will
offer a complexity lacking from the first.
This is not a repetition of "Banquet" — the
band's most well-known single from "Silent
Alarm" — but instead a melodic introduc
tion leading into a much softer and muted
main section, the drumbeat far off in the
background rather than at the forefront (as
it was for much of "Silent Alarm"). While
the influence of their previous CP is clear,
especially in the newest single, "The
Prayer" — which might be the weakest song
on the album — as well as "Hunting for
Witches," most tunes move past the prior
simplicity into a fuller complexity, especial
ly the tracks "On" and "Uniform." The
album starts to lose its momentum, though,
as it progresses - the second half doesn't
quite have the creative vitality of the first.
Bloc Party visits San Francisco on March
17 (thankfully without Panic! At the Disco,
who they were previously slated to open
for), and it will be interesting to see how
these songs work at a live performance. It's
unlikely many of them will come off we 11...
the tools available in the studio certainly
add a lot to each track, which these days is a
necessary evil.
T hat being said, the album is a worthwhile
improvement on "Silent Alarm." The earli
er release, while a good listen, had only lim
ited mileage in terms of repeat listens,
whereas the remix album had slightly more.
But "A Weekend in the City." for all its
flaws, is something that could, and should,
be listened to several (or many) times over
in order for the listener to fully appreciate
its complexity.
