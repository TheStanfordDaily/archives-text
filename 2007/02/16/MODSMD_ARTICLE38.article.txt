## Pauly Shore is no wore 
### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION PAULY 
The weasel is no more. Pauly Shore has
died. Let us take a moment to remember the
southern-California-bred slacker that you saw
on MTV's Spring Break.
In the '90s, Pauly Shore seemed to be every
where — he was constantly on MTV. he ap
peared in several movies ("Bio-Dome," "Enci
no Man") and he dated basically the most pop
ular women of the era. He has been romanti
cally linked to model Jillian Grace, actress
Tiffani Amber Thiessen and pop star Kylie
Minogue ("That's the one thing about doing
movies — you get to hook up with your co
stars." he admits).
Due to this constant exposure, and perhaps
jealousy at his seemingly undeserved fame, au
diences were turned off and later turned on the
casual comedian. Despite his background in
comedy, his name became the punch-line in
many jokes. Later. Shore received several
Razzies, a distinction for the worst perfor
mances every year in film. Most notably, lie
won for "Worst New Star of the Decade" in
2000.
Shore still talks in his lackadaisical SoCal
drawl, peppering his language with "bro" and
"you know." But. the words come with a sense
of maturity and acceptance about his career's
arc: "You put yourself out there and you get
battered. It's good to have thick skin. Thick
foreskin."
So how do you have a second act when the
audience has already left?
The answer, it seems, is to fake your own
death. "You gotta die to come back," he
claims. His 2003 mockumentary "Pauly Shore
is Dead" has received positive reviews and
even won him an audience choice award at the
Slamdunk Film Festival. A parade of celebri
ties collaborated to help Shore in his self-dep
recating project, and a mock funeral helped
cap a nation-wide publicity campaign. He be
lieves the appeal of the film is due to "Making
fun of myself but yet appealing to people who
never liked me."
Afterwards, a new Pauly Shore emerged,
and. while the weasel is no more, he has been
reborn. Shore has been focusing on his jokes,
on getting back into stand-up comedy: "My
style used to be the persona and now it's more
about my material." The weasel persona is
dead. "Its something 1 did a while ago... we're
all different than we were 15 years ago." His
new material draws on contemporary issues as
diverse as 1 iillary Clinton's presidential bid to
his rollercoaster career. His routine, in his
words, "is like a surfer jumping into a wave...
You don't know what's going to happen."
For those who fear that he may be taking

himself too seriously now. he still states that his
style is simply "Keeping it real, bro." He as
pires to "Keep a connection with the audi
ence" and "just hang out."
Many consider his resurgence in the come
dy world surprising because his fame was not
derived from his joke-telling, but rather his
iconic persona. But comedy is the family trade.
His mother opened up the famous Comedy
Store in Los Angeles in 1972. a comedy club
where countless legendary comedians per
formed, oftentimes before they made it big.
John Belushi, Jim Carrey, Bill Hicks and Jerry
Seinfeld are among its alumni. Shore grew up
with some of the finest acts in the world, and
they made a deep impression on him. With the
parade of comedians around him, he quickly
developed favorites and mentors: "The guys
that moved mc were [Richard] Pryor, Eddie
Murphy, Sam [Kinison]... and Robin
Williams... These are the guys I would get
stoked by."
Since his mother owned the club, he met a
lot of the greats — as babysitters. "My mom
would give me physically to comics. I got taken
to little league and all of these comics would be
in the audience." Sam Kinison drove him
around. Stand up legends would cheer for him
in the field.
In 2(K)5. he had a reality show on TBS called
"Minding the Store" which was about his cam
paign to revitalize the Comedy Store. Despite
the program's cancellation, he calls the project
successful: "The show helped get the name
back out there." He still watches over the
Comedy Store on occasion. and, akin to the
Store's famous alums, he performs new stand
up there. Shore believes that the common trait
they all posses is their need to be comedians: "1
think the t rue comedians are the ones that have
to go on stage: they don't want to go on stage.
There is stuff that J have to talk about."
Despite the ridicule he endured for his
years of surprising stardom, he has a positive
attitude about it:"It was just my time. 1 was
outrageous and wild and I didn't give a fuck-
It was about the people and connecting. There
was that connection between mc and the peo
ple. If I go to an airport... everybody will give
me high fives. It's a cool thing to be known
for."
Now on tour. Pauly Shore is coming to the
Bay Area. He's performing Friday through
Sunday at the lmprov in San Jose. If you can't
make those, part of his resurgence includes a
soon-to-be-released sketch comedy special
called "Natural Born Komics" and a guest
starring role on "Entourage" due out in two
months.
Love him or hate him, Pauly Shore is still
very much alive, bro.

Comedy Store on occasion. and, akin to the
Store's famous alums, he performs new stand
up there. Shore believes that the common trait
they all posses is their need to be comedians: "1
think the t rue comedians are the ones that have
to go on stage: they don't want to go on stage.
There is stuff that J have to talk about."
Despite the ridicule he endured for his
years of surprising stardom, he has a positive
attitude about it:"It was just my time. 1 was
outrageous and wild and I didn't give a fuck-
It was about the people and connecting. There
was that connection between mc and the peo
ple. If I go to an airport... everybody will give
me high fives. It's a cool thing to be known
for."
Now on tour. Pauly Shore is coming to the
Bay Area. He's performing Friday through
Sunday at the lmprov in San Jose. If you can't
make those, part of his resurgence includes a
soon-to-be-released sketch comedy special
called "Natural Born Komics" and a guest
starring role on "Entourage" due out in two
months.
Love him or hate him, Pauly Shore is still
very much alive, bro.
