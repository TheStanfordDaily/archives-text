### JACKIE BERNSTEIN INTERMISSION TROTTER 
It took Daytrotter to make mc a
music person. I interviewed musicians
like Jay-Z. Weezer and Green Day for
my local newspaper back home. 1 spent
a whole summer living with a music
snob who would proudly blare her new
finds over our slick German sound sys
tem for three hours every night. I faced
public shame just last week when my
iTunes library was deemed unworthy
for background music at a party. None
of these incidents inspired me to really
care about contemporary music. But,
after a 45-minute interview with Sean
Moeller, founder of the music site
Daytrotter.com, I have a newfound,
savage obsession.
Whether you identify with my prior
music apathy or are grossly appalled
that I would even list Jay-Z in an at
tempt to sound hip, you have to admit
that Moeller, who would much rather
go by his first name, Sean, has a pretty
sweet set-up: His company runs a small
studio in downtown Rock Island, Illi
nois, where, according to Moeller,
indie musicians such as Of Montreal
and Sunset Rubdown stop "as they
drive from one isolated part of the
country to the other. Bandmates use
borrowed instruments, play with their
touring mates, utilize an often un
kempt toilet, eat some food and then
cram back into their vans for the last
half of the drive."
At the end of the session, about four
songs are usually posted onto Daytrot
ter. These songs — exclusive, re
worked, alternate versions of old songs
and unreleased tracks — are entirely
free to listen to and download. The site
typically features two bands a week;
this week's groups are Koufax and
Paleo. Koufax's "Colour Us Candadi
an" will make sense to anyone who has
studied abroad and felt coerced into
hiding his American identity, and
Paleo's' slightly mellower version of
"November 30, 2006" is the perfect
song to play for the significant other
that you wish you had. Download both
tracks now and finish reading this arti
cle later.
Moeller's team is meticulous in
making sure that each band passing

through gets its own thoughtful review
and accompanying original artwork
posted online. As Moeller explains in
the middle of an exuberant, 10-minute
riff, "If you take most of the writing
done about music, it's all. i think these
guys are great, they're amazing.'
There's a place for that, but I really
like being absurd and experimental,
really focusing on the band, and what
the music conjures in you and really
brings." Daytrotter "really encour
ages [these sessions] to be different...
and for the musicians to be creative,"
and the staff fiercely follows the same
guiding principles in their work, as
well.
After establishing himself on the
music-reviewer circuit and discovering
that it was soulless, mind-numbing
work, Moeller has successfully made
Daytrotter into a refuge where other
weary reviewers can get back in touch
with their majored-in-English-with-an
emphasis-in-Creative-Writing alter
egos. DaytToTTSt's reviews, which
Moeller often writes himself, aren't the
same formulaic piles of fifth-grade
reading-level tripe that has infested the
genre. And the graphic work, done by
Moeller's illustration team of Shannon
Palmer, Josh Frankel, Ryan Flynn, Joe
Sayers and Johnnie Clooney, is a thou
sand times superior to the publicity
stills and slick photo-shoot pieces that
pepper most MP3 blogs and music
magazines. Clicking through the exu
berant reviews and arwork gave me the
same feeling that I used to get when 1
crawled through couch-cushion
fortresses as a little kid.
According to Moeller, who has re
cently been compared to a web'-based
John Peel, "Anybody who really loves
music can really swim in our session
archives." I would say that Daytrotter
goes beyond this. Anybody who really
loves creative expression will fall for
this site.
Think that a job at Daytrotter would
be cool? If you're looking for a summer
internship, Daytrotter is hiring.
They're looking for really "ad sales
people, good graphic artists, and really
great writers who want to make good
literature." If interested, contact
