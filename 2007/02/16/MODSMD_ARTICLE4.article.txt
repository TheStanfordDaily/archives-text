## Residents, police argue ticket spike Department of Public Safety says bike light, parking tickets are routine 
### RAHUL KANAKIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While some students say they have noticed increased
numbers of police officers looking to ticket bicycle-related
violations at busy intersections, the Department of Public
Safety (DPS) claims that variations in its enforcement are
somewhat random and are not due to any new departmen
tal policy.
"I see more officers patrolling."said Bradley I leinz 'OS.
"More people assigned to do bike things."
Kilty McOowan'OSsaid that he recently received a tick
et for biking without a bike light.
"I've seen them out twice now since about two weeks
ago at the corner of Santa 'leresa," he said. "Iliey were giv
ing out fix-it ticketsâ€” they're only $10. You basically just
have to buy a bike light ami prove that you bought the bike
light. I know they've done this in previous years, so it's not
entirely new. but I think they just tend to do a bunch at a
time. It's not something they're doing constantly. Iliey just
do it every once in a while."
Deputy Christopher Cohendet said that enforcement
has not increased. I le added, however, that the police pres
ence at intersections varies "depending on how many pa
trol officers we have on a shift and on how many calls there
are. II calls come up for service, they have to go."

A Pedestrian Zone warden carries a sign that warns against
biking in the Quad while a student bikes in a different part of
the Quad, violating the law. Police deny an increase in tick
eting, despite rumors of heightened bike law enforcement.
