## ‘Yellow Face' explores Asian identify 
### PHIL SHIU INTERMISSION COOL GUY 
1 used to think that weak writers used race as a crutch. They
couldn't write about something interesting or worthwhile, so
they chose a gimmick — race. After all, no one could criticize
the work without themselves being attacked as racist. But the
more 1 read these "weak" works, I began to realize that these

writers used race not as a crutch, but as a
starting point to create poignant commen
tary on humanity in general.
Playwright David Henry Hwang '79. has
created another such work in his play. "Yel
low Face," which is playing at Roble Studio
Theater (the final performance at Stanford
is tonight at 8). Before the staged reading, 1
was a little apprehensive: I was afraid the
play would be another shallow social cri
tique that criticized stereotypes with
humor. Much to my surprise, the play stood
on its own artistically and was far more
complex than I had anticipated.
"Yellow Face," directed by Leigh Silver
mail, is unabashedly autobiographical, por
traying Hwang's life after his highly suc
cessful "M. Butterfly." Hwang, played by
Tony Lee, narrates his own life, prompted

by an email from one of Hwang's former actors, Marcus Gee,
who has disappeared from the acting scene. The story begins
with Hwang's acceptance of the Tony Award for "M. Butterfly,"

and his jubilation that Asian Americans have finally won "the
right to tell our own stories." But much to his surprise, Hwang
later learns that a Caucasian actor has been chosen to play the
leading biracial Asian male role in "Miss Saigon."
Hwang leads the charge against "Miss Saigon" arguing that
Asian roles should be given to Asian actors. Hwang's efforts
eventually result in "Miss Saigon's" cancellation, but later, the
show is revived, again with a Caucasian playing the role of En-

gineer. In response, Hwang writes "Face Value" —
but mistakenly casts a non-Asian, Marcus Gee, for
the leading role.
The play, still a work-in-progress, is being per
formed as a staged reading. The actors weren't in
costume, there was no props or intermission, and
the blocking was minimal. Nonetheless, "Yellow
Face" demonstrated an impressively high degree
of polish. The actors had essentially memorized
their lines, and very rarely seemed to need their
scripts.
Furthermore, the actors have done an excellent
job of creating their characters with just their voice
and small actions. This, far more than a costume,
defined their characters. One particularly well
crafted character is Henry Hwang. David's father,
played by Francis Jue. Jue brilliantly plays Henry,
an Chinese-American immigrant who rose to cre
ate the first federally chartered bank in America.

combining the stereotypical fob accent with a charming inno
cence.
Despite Jue's spot-on stereotype of Hwang, most ot the

humor conies not from jokes playing off stereotypes, but from
the delicious irony that comes from Hwang's casting of a "Siber
ian Jew" for the leading Asian role of "Face Value." This splen
did irony continues throughout the play, as Marcus Gee goes on
to become a leading advocate in the Asian community — de
spite not being Asian at all, which results in uproariously funny
scenes, especially since Hwang the playwright isn't afraid to
make fun of himself.
For all its humor, "Yellow Face" is a serious play, raising ques
tions like what it means to be Asian, and whether or not race still
matters. Furthermore, the play demonstrates that racism still
very much exists in America, as the play covers the Chinese
campaign finance scandal of 1996 and the persecution of Wen
Ho Lee.
But despite all of "Yellow Face's" questions about racism and
race, the central focus of the play is about authenticity. Hwang
seems to suggest that labels, like 'Asian American' or 'racist',
mean very little. It is the content, and the meaning, that matters,
not the label.
As a work-in-progress, "Yellow Face" has its flaws — the
ending feels a little artificial and contrived, and some of the ac
tors still seem like they are experimenting to find the right char
acterization of their part. But as a whole, "Yellow Face" is a
show that you definitely should see. There is certainly no reason
not to go, since the play is hilarious for everyone — Asian or
not. Furthermore, the play really isn't about race — its about
being real, regardless of your race.
Clearly, then, Hwang doesn't use race as crutch for a weak
play, for "Yellow Face" is an hilarious and compelling play. On ,
its own merit,"Yellow Face" is a play that runs — and flies.
