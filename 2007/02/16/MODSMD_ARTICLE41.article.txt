### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION WESTERNER 
Stanford is the final venue for the 20th-anniversary tour of
this exhibition of Avedon's oversized images of working
class Westerners.
It's almost as if you become the viewed and they become
the viewers.
If you go to the Cantor Arts Center just once a year, it
should be to sec this show. If you go to Cantor once in your
entire Stanford career, it should be to see Richard Avedon's
breath-taking photo portraits.
The moment that you round the corner and step into the
exhibit, you are confronted by the intense stare of an ex
tremely freckly, overall-wearing 12-year-old girl. Like all ol
the work in the show, the photograph is huge, stark, black
and white and utterly unforgettable. She gazes directly at
you, and you can't help but construct a past for her. piece to
gether her family and her friends — each picture builds a
narrative and gives a life-time of delails.
Richard Avedon. originally famous for helping to raise
fashion photography to a fine art, was commissioned in 19 7 9
to take portraits of those living in the American West. Thir
teen states, 189 towns, 17.000 sheets of 8" by 10" film and
five-and-a-half years later, Avedon exhibited the original
"In the American West" exhibit in 1985 at the Anion Carter
Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. Now two decades later, and
two years after Avedon's death. Stanford is showing 63 of
the original 124 pieces, including all of the most famous and

notable portraits.
For the subject of his portraits, Avcdon focused on the
working class, both those living close to the land and on the
margins of society. He photographed farmers, coal miners,
rodeo contestants, housewives, construction workers,
ranchers, truckers, waitresses, carneys and oil field workers
To find (he subjects for his pieces, he visited local bars,
diners and fairs across the West; he would meet them.
talk to them a bit and then ask to take their portrait.
Avcdon photographed outside in the shade with an 8'
by 10" Dcardorff view camera and a simple blank
sheet of paper as his backdrop. The space is shallow
the lighting simple — Avedon wanted these por
traits to look as though they "merely happened."
And lie has more than succeeded. From a boy proud
ly holding up a gutted rattlesnake and its intestine:
to sisters posing next to one another, these people
feel alive, standing still behind the pictures' bor
ders. The exhibit features a fascinating sequence
of drifters who gupe back from the walls, their
expressions full of mystery, tragedy and knowl
edge. The miners in the farthest room look from
blackened faces — mud. coal and other earthly
substances splattered all over their bodies.
There is a nine-year-old who holds a rifle, a bee
keeper covered in bees and. perhaps my fa
vorite. three sisters with teased hair whose cap
tion reads "Loretta, Loudilla, Kay Johnson, co
presidents. Loretta Lynn Fan Club."

All of the photographed Westerners stare from the walls
with complex expressions of alienation, despair and re
silience. Upon initial exhibition of the show 20 years ago,
many criticized Avedon's portraits as "cruel." "cynical" and
even "vicious." One critic even wrote, "This is not
our West." Although Avedon's subjects are ex
clusively from rural backgrounds, and some
portraits evoke sympathy and sometimes
oven pity, his portraits have more generally
been viewed as breathtaking and poignant
rather than disparaging and ridiculing.
The pieces have since toured the country
during multiple exhibitions and have be
come a hallmark of American photogra
phy.
From pregnant housewives to bar
lenders and waitresses, this exhibit
gives us an authentic look at the
West. Without make-up, outfits or
props, the photos often seem bleak
and harsh — the realism is star
tling. But it is through their honesty
and our reaction to it that we can
;ilso see ourselves in a fuller and
more unambiguous way.
