## Music to keep yourself company 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION MASTER-BATOR 
Although Roxy Sass may claim that Valentine's Day is all
about luring some tipsy frat boy into your room to temporarily
lill your heart (and bed), the truth of the matter is that this hol
iday is about love. No. not Facebook "In a Relationship"-style
| ove — | c t's face it, at any given time that's one wall post away
from complete annihilation — or the love that feminists appar
ently have for going off on diatribes about their vaginas. I'm
talking about the one eternal love on this earth, the only one
made to last: the love between man and himself - or woman and
herself, for that matter.
And none of this late-'9os-style
"know thyself from within"
schlock. You can do that on
your own time. I'm talking
about masturbation —
the national pastime of
guilty Catholic school
boys and electrical engi
neering grad students.
Although it's gotten some flak over
the years, masturbation is both lun
and healthy. It clears your pores, is
one of the all-time great stress reliev
ers and. depending on how into your
self you are. is an enjoyable alternative
to going to the gym.
You may not be in a rela
tionship or snare a fortuitous
one-night stand, but we all
have a chance of getting some
on Valentine's Day. So here are
the top five songs to get yourself
in the mood:
Honorable mention: "I Touch Myself"
— The Divinvls. You and I both know

this is the best song about
masturbation recorded in all
of human history. But putting
it on the list would be like if
the National Enquirer fea
tured Tori Spelling in their
"Knifestyles of the Rich and
Famous" issue: too obvious.
5. "Dancing With Myself" —
Billy Idol. Although Billy has
alternately denied and con
firmed rumors that this song is
about masturbation, the lyrics
speak for themselves: "Well 1
wait so long for my love vibra
tion / And I'm dancing with
mvself." Don't worry, Billy. If

I were you, I'd be dancing with myself, too.
4. "li'sOnlv Me (Wizard of Magicland)" — Barenaked Ladies.
This feel-good pup number talks about masturbation not just as
the last refuge of the solitary loser, but a legitimate relationship
with yourself: "They say you'll never love another 'til you love
yourself / Well, brother I'm in love with everyone 1 see.'" Plus, it
you're running low in the fantasy department, you can use the
band's name as a springboard. It's a two-for-one bonus lor one-

on-one
fun!

(and Wikipcdia)
has it that the title
of this song refers
to the face many
men make during cli
max: eyes squinted
and lip curled up to
reveal incisors. Lyrics like
"I've got your picture, I've
got your picture / I'd like a
million of them all 'round my cell" corrob
orate this suspicion.

2. "Blister in the Sun" — Violent Fenimes. This masturbation
classic is, above all else, just a wonderful song to crank up and
sing along to. But there's no mistaking its subject when the big
handed singer screams: "Body and beats, I stain my sheets /1
don't even know why." Urn, 1 think we know why.
1. "L.ongview" — Green Day. Arguably the single greatest self
love anthem of all time, Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong
summed it up in an interview: "It's about boredom, masturba
tion and smoking dope" - a typical talc ot suburban life. Amidst |
the pumping bass line and catchy chorus, Billie Joe belts out an
aphorism that not even Oscar Wilde could top: "When mastur
bation's lost its fun you're fucking lazy." Truer words were 112
ne'er spoken.

So whether you're spending your
V-Day with friends, a lover or
studying in Meyer, steal a few min
utes to make a new i Pod playlist and
take some well-deserved "you
time." You don't even have to buy
yourself flowers and a card first.
