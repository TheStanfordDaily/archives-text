## Putting sexy back in the White House 
### ROXYSASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Let's take this moment to honor the pres
idents of the United States. Done yet?
Good, because Roxy and (she thinks) any
red-blooded, firm-buttocked woman or
man would absolutely hate to be presi- 1
dent, at least as the job is currently under-"
stood. Talk about a libido-killing profes
sion. Look at what happened to Bill!
What a waste of all those secret
passages and hidden rooms in the
White House.
So Roxy gives you permission i
to forget about Presidents' Day.
Really, it's fine! Ignore the nag- [
ging voice of your fifth grade
teacher that forever echoes in
your head, and just enjoy that 1
blessed day off for what it real
ly is — a day off.
And if you get a moment,,
pray —or whatever it is that
you do when you want some
thing— that, someday, we'll
get someone sexy in the Oval
Office. Barack Obama would be
a good start, but definitely not up
to Roxy's standards (which, con- <
trary to popular belief, are actual
ly quite lofty).
Roxy's not going to lie. She
would prefer a sexy woman to hold

this prestigious office as soon as possible. But,
in today's political climate, it's unlikely that, if
a woman did make it to the highest office in
the land, she would be — or at least al
lowed to be — very sexy at all. Politics
seem to require women to renounce
their sexuality: Look at Condi or Hil. So
J Roxy will settle for a sexy man, at least
for now.
Roxy firmly believes if our president
were jaw- and-pants-droppingsexy,
many improvements would
sweep our society.
First of all, that ridiculous
abstinence-only sex edu
cation would be already
abolished. Roxy does not
I even want to know what
i president came up with
It's statistically
proven that those areas
fin which abstinence
, only sex education flour
ishes have higher teen
F pregnancy rates. Eek. A
president comfortable with
his (or her!) own sexuality
and sex appeal would recognize
sex as a universal drive once
those tweenies hit puberty, and
stop trying to pretend they'll
never learn about it if it's not
taught in the classroom.
Second, Roxy assumes that

a sexy president would take a good look at Eu
rope, which is way sexier than most things
we've got in America. Aside from the whole
lack of deodorant and showers, Europeans
achieve, on the whole, a degree of sexiness un
rivaled in most of America. Among the ideas
that a sexy American president (unfortunate
ly, that's still only a movie) could adopt from
Europe are:
1. Comfort with images of nudity and sexual
ity in the media. Grow up already! What is the
big deal about Janet Jackson's nipple? And
don't even try to tell Roxy that nudity hurts
family values — where do you think families
come from? Instead of distracting Americans
with talk about deteriorating family values, a
sexy president would tackle real issues, such as
Social Security and the war in Iraq.
2. The revolutionary concept that men can
dress nicely and touch each other without nec
essarily being "gay." The metrosexual move
ment is getting there, but imagine if we had a

president who adhered to those laws of fash
ion, instead of one who gave unsolicited neck
massages at international conferences. Roxy
would swoon right into his well-manicured,
smoothly-lotioned hands. And then he'd (or
she'd!) probably legalize gay marriage — fi
nally!
3. Openness in the porn and prostitution in
dustries. It's kind of like: You're not going to
eliminate the world's oldest recreational activ
ity by refusing to talk about it, and you're not
going to bring the world's oldest industry to a
screeching halt by forcing it underground. By
recognizing the existence of sex for sale, a sexy
president could regulate and sanitize a promi
nent sector of our society. Then maybe the
United States would stop being one of the
largest importers of Eastern European sex
slaves worldwide, and actually start to make
money off of a veritable government-regulat
ed industry.
Adopting these sexy ideas from Europe and
elsewhere would gain the States wider global
popularity and improve our foreign relations,
solve a variety of domestic issues and in gen
eral make America a sexier place to be. Do
you need a higher calling? Activism is part of
the college experience for many people. If you
haven't been drawn to any causes yet, Roxy
hopes she's inspired you to make a change in
our society. Do you believe? Roxy believes.
