# Bistro Vida: Tasty good, tasty atmosphere

### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION BISTO EXPERT 
This cute French bistro located in downtown
Menlo Park is a charming blast from the past.
Quaint, warbling French tunes play on Bistro
Vida's outside speaker system, luring all of us
"1-wish-I-had visited Pear-ee" types/wannabe
Frogs. The French ambience continues with a
delightfully decorated interior — floral-pat
terned velvet curtains frame the front door and
the two-story-tall front windows provide nat
ural lighting to the entire eatery. The dark
wood of the tables, chairs and sidings are com
plemented by the deep burgundy-red of the
walls and a muddy green colored ceiling.
Toulouse-Lautrec-esque vintage posters and
ornately framed mirrors decorate the interior,
and large bowlfuls of bright red apples garnish
the bar area and a few larger tables in the back.
The menu, written in French with English
translations underneath, offers moderately
priced brunch options, including the house's

special fruit and vanilla ice cream crepes.
Entree are priced between $8 to $11, and
hot drinks are $3 each. Coffee refills are
free, though, and an order of hot tea is
served in a cute personal tea pol, which
holds enough hot water for multiple fill
ups. Lunch and especially dinner are
pricier, however, with the average dinner
entree running at $18.
As with so many things French, the
food is carefully prepared —my veg
etable omelet was served with well-sea
soned potatoes and ripe fruit. (No
soggy pre-made fruit salad, here. It
was squishy-grapeless and sour
pineapple free.) The Vida hamburg
er came with skinny fries and a leafy
green side salad that was not over
ly dressed (a whopping pet
peeve of mine. Really, it isn't
even a pet peeve at all. It is
more of a wild peeve, a very
feral, very un-domesticat
irararararararararararararararnrnrar

ed peeve. And, Bistro Vida, you passed this lit
mus test of mine with flying colors.)
The crepes, which the Bistro lauds as it spe
cialty and recommends at the top of its menu in
a fun little decorated box, were particularly di
vine. Although they are really just a wonderful
dessert rather than any sort of start-your-day
off-right breakfast, they didn't just beat a bowl
of Wheaties — they left it injured and pathetic
in the dust. The crepe was thin and just slightly
i sweet, allowing the strawberry and raspberry
jam sauce to provide the flavor and sugari
ness. Vanilla ice cream was folded inside,
I melting, seeping out the edges and mixing
with the sauce. Our amphibian-loving
friends sure know how to do love, phallic
buildings and orgasmic desserts.
On this lazy Sunday afternoon, the
bistro was filled with mostly an older,
well-dressed, well-off clientele, the
type that is Menlo Park, I suppose.
An especially cute older couple
came in for a cup of coffee and a

crepe, holding hands on top of the table. Real
ly, the Vida Bistro it is the perfect date place:
casual but nice, cute without being overly
trendy, just out-of-the way enough to be spe
cial. It is ripe for becoming an "our place," the
restaurant where you have a first date and then
return to on your anniversary. It is where you
would go to have a night out for just the two of
you, where you write letters to him when you
are dating long-distance and where, ultimate
ly, he pops the question, getting down on one
knee and offering you one rose, a simple band
and a central place in his heart for the rest of his
life.
Or at least you can think about these things
while sipping coffee and eating fabulous
French desserts at one of the cutest bistros in
the area. Man, those frogs... they always get
you in a romantic state of mind.
