## Placement in draw frustrates Surprised students return to winter shortages, spring improvements expected 
### JENNIFER LIU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students returning to Stanford after a quarter away
from campus are aware that the odds of getting into a Row
I louse or other popular residence are slim.
Most resign themselves loan unenviable dorm and hope
for the best. Hi is year, however, a number of students who
returned to Ihe Farm at the beginning of winter quarter
found themselves unexpectedly placed in graduate housing
m ( rothers 1 1, ill and ('rothers Memorial as a result of a par
ticularly large housing crunch.
According to Sue Nunan. director of housing assign
ments. undergraduate housing shortages are almost always
more acute in winter quarter because of the large number
of students who study abroad during the fall.
Undergraduates placed in ("rothers and ("rothers
Memorial at the beginning of the quarter could submit re
assignment requests if other rooms became available, but
none have done so. Nunan said.
('art Moore 'OS — who studied abroad at ()xford in the
fall — said he had no plans to move out of his single in
( rothers. I Jnassigned after a computer glitch downgraded
his application priority to that of a student studying abroad
at a non-Stanford-affiliated program, lie said he was satis-
fied with his assignment.
"I knew someone who came back
last winter, lived in Crothers, and
then moved into an undergraduate
space, Moore said. "But the people
in my situation were emailed about
open spaces and told that we had
first pick of what was available be
fore the walk-in meeting."
Vilas Rao '07, who also studied at
Oxford last fall, suffered the same
glitch and admitted that he was less
sanguine about the situation at first.
He was eventually assigned to
Xanadu.
"I drew preferred, and 1 had a
draw number in the 800s," he said. "1
was frustrated in the beginning while
Housing was trying to figure out
what had happened, especially since
1 d been expecting a good place
ment. The people who 1 talked to
handled everything really well,
though, and were very professional
about the entire situation."
In addition to assigning returning
students to Crothers and Crothers
Memorial, Nunan said that Housing
placed a number of students in "up
rated" rooms — residences that
have been converted to accommo
date more students than were origi
nally intended — or non-traditional
rooms, such as guest cottages.
"Guest rooms in four undergrad
uate residences were used as student
rooms during winter quarter," she
said. "Small common rooms in three
residences were converted tem
porarily to student rooms. A few stu
dent rooms in two residences were
uprated for winter quarter."
Students living in these rooms
will remain there during the spring
unless they ask to be reassigned.
Nunan added.
Sagari Bette '08, who lives in a
Murray House guest cottage, said
that she had originally been assigned
to Robinson House.
"After my drawmate and 1 re
ceived our assignment, we emailed

Housing asking if we could room to
gether," she said. "Over winter
break, we received emails that told
us that there had basically been a
mistake and we had been assigned to
a Murray guest cottage instead, with
a detailed description of what the
rooms were like. As long as we were
able to room together, though, I was
n't too concerned."
Bette said she has access to every
thing a standard dorm would offer.
"We eat at Murray, and we have
access to Murray staff," she said.
"But we also have our own bath
room and a couch. All things consid
ered, it's working out quite nicely.
I'm definitely not thinking of moving
any more this year."
Students returning to campus for
spring quarter, however, can rest as
sured of a more orthodox appoint
ment.

In the past, all spring quarter
waiting list applicants have been ac
commodated in undergraduate resi
dences, Nunan wrote in an email to
The Daily.
"Last year, we had over 200 un
dergraduate vacancies remaining
after waiting list and walk-in assign
ments were made," she said.
Nunan said the large number of
vacancies for spring quarter is a re
sult of a number of factors. Fewer
students are abroad during the win
ter — only 127 undergraduates have
submitted housing applications for
next quarter, she said. Adding to the
surplus of available rooms is the rel
atively large number of seniors who
graduate at the end of winter quar
ter.
