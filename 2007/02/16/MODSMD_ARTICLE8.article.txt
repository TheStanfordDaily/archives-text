Feb 16,1950:
"More than KM) screeching soph
omore girls were thwarted in an at
tempt to raid Roble I (all last night at
9:30.
"Stopped by locked doors and
windows, the sophs surrounded the
dormitory and scrambled up from the
sundeck wall. Bombarded from sec
ond* and third-story windows by
water-filled wastebaskets, the sophs
hurled taunts of 'Squash the frosh'
over the din of exploding firecrackers.
"It all started when spirited fresh
men short-sheeting their sophomore
sisters in Branner I fall. In retaliation,
sophomores planned a mass meeting
in Lagunita courtyard.Their purpose
was allegedly 'to annoy, not to de
stroy." and sophomore girls from all
over campus set out with co'd cream,
lipstick, and live frogs.
"The levi-clad crowd waylaid re
turning Roble-ites, painting "The
hell with '53" in lipstick on cheeks
and foreheads. Inside, the freshman
tilled paper bags and wastebaskets
and showered every attacker who
came within range.

"Several sophomores forced their
way into a front window at 10 p.m.
and let live frogs loose in Roble
lobby. The sophs were held as
hostages in Miss Keane's office until
the fight was ended.
"The attack was a step in the
mounting spirit of the Frosh-Soph
Jamboree planned for this weekend.
Sophs stated it was an attempt that
they are 'really out for blood and in
tend to win the forthcoming contests."'

Four years before Face book, a
study co-authored by Norman Nie,
professor of political science,showed
that high Internet usage reduced so
cial interactions.
"The results, which have already
been publicized ad nauseum, largely
boil down to a single discovery: the
more time Stanford students spend
online, the less time they spend doing
other things.' wrote Daily columnist
Paul Kerschen a week later. 'To
which the appropriate response is.
well, dull.'"

"Washington, however, plays defense like Britney Spears
wears panties — with embarrassing irregularity."
