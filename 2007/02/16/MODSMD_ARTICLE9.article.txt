### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
The Energizer Bunny has nothing
on Jessica Richman "07. according to
Sam Moltzman, a consulting associ
ate professor in management science
and engineering.
"She keeps at it."he said. "1 have
never seen anybody more energetic
than this woman... She will go places."
Ilie San Diego native with a 3.85
grade point average, didn't take a
traditional path to Stanford. She
owned her own business before com
ing here and co-founded a program
providing financial education for
women.
Richman. who is double majoring
in economics and science, technology
and society, is one of 20 college jun
iors and seniors named to USA
Today's 2007 All-USA College Aca
demic First Team. She will receive a
trophy and a $2,500 cash prize.
The team members, featured in
yesterday's edition of USA Today,
were selected for their academics, ac
tivities and leadership from a pool of

almost 600 students nominated by
their schools.
The most important considera
tion for the award was how candi
dates "extended their academic skills
beyond the classroom." according to
USA Today.
Richman worked with the
Women's Institute for Financial Edu
cation, based in San Diego, to co-found
the organization's Money Clubs.
Money Clubs provide financial
education for women in the form of
downloadable information about a
variety of topics, such as stocks,
bonds and whether to buy or rent a
house. The Web site can match

women up with others in their area
and provide a curriculum and agen
da for their meeting.
The group has thousands of mem
bers in the United States and around
the world, including women in every
state.
"The subject is a touchy one — it's
difficult to talk about with friends and
hard to talk about with total
strangers." she said. "We want some
thing in the middle. We were thinking
about something like Weight Watch
ers. where women could meet to talk
about certain issues that they share in
common and maybe become friends."
Richman wrote most of the con
tent for the program's curriculum,
citing a big gap in financial knowl
edge for women.
"For some people it's sort of this
stigma, being a woman who knows
about money," she said. "And for
some it's just boring, it's not fun.
We're trying to make it fun. You
meet up with some women for cof
fee. you set goals, you talk about
things that are difficult to talk about
but still important."
Richman still serves as director of
public outreach for the Women's In
stitute and answers questions sub
mitted via email as best she can, of
fering women legal and tax advice.

She said that, through these
emails, she saw the terrible positions
women would get themselves into
out of ignorance.
"They're not dumb, they just did
n't know," she said. "They would do
things out of their interests because
they just didn't understand, which
was so shocking to me."
Richman said she has always been
interested in finance and that her in
terest in business was sparked by her
entrepreneurial family.
"Many members of my family
owned their own businesses, and 1
think 1 just really understood how
important finance is to getting things
done," she said. "Nothing really hap
pens unless there's money to make it
happen. It's really exciting to stand at
the leverage point seeing whether
things happen or not."
After dropping out of high school,
Richman owned an independent
bookstore near San Diego while she
attended community college.
"I'd done a lot of entrepreneurial
things in high school,and,when an op
portunity came up, I took it." she said.
"It's really fun having your own busi
ness. You don't have to ask anyone —
you can just make things happen."

She spent a year at UC-Berkeley
before coming to Stanford.
" I was at the point where the busi
ness had become successful, and I re
ally craved the school experience,"
she said. "Now I'm living in a co-op.
getting involved in clubs, living the
dream that 1 didn't have a chance to
after high school."
Richman is planning to pursue a
co-terminal degree and hopes to
work as a social entrepreneur after
she graduates.
"I'm really passionate about the
power of technology and entrepre
neurship to make a huge change in
the world," she said. "I want to use
the power of business techniques to
really make a difference in a way
that's measurable."

Richman has an internship with
Voyager Capital (a venture capital
firm),a research position at the Grad
uate School of Business, a fellowship
with the Stanford Humanities Center
and a radio show on KZSU.
In addition, she is the chair of aca
demic improvement for the ASSU
Executive Cabinet, a member of Stan
ford Finance, a Haas Center Public
Leadership Fellow and a member of
Cap and Gown. Richman added that
she is very interested in entrepreneur
ial opportunities on campus.
Alex Gould, Richman's adviser in
the economics department, said he
connected immediately with his ad
visee.
Both Gould and Holtzman em
phasized Richman's persistence and
positive attitude.
"She's very easy to get along
with, and for her perseverance and
energy, she gets an A plus," said
Holtzman.
Gould eehoed these sentiments,

adding that Richman is unique for
her doggedness and "can-do spirit."
"Nothing seems to get her down."
he said.
According to Gould. Richman is
exceptional as a student and as a per
son.
"She's extremely proactive, asks a
ton of good questions — hones right
in on the really important issues," he
said.
Because of her nontraditional ex
perience, Gould said he found Rich
man more mature than the average
Stanford undergraduate.
"1 find a lot of econ majors are
convinced that everything can be
solved by a spreadsheet," he said. "At
the end of the day, there are human
beings behind all the spreadsheets,
and Jessica is very tuned in to the
personal dynamics, which is some
thing I don't see very often."
