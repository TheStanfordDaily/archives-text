"Nearly two months of col
laborative investigation between
Stanford and NASA came to a
close [two days ago| when
NASA scientists confirmed that
the signals received by the Stan
ford Dish were not from the lost
spacecraft Mars Polar Lander
but from Earth itself. The Dish
had picked up faint signals that
were hypothesized to be from
the $165 million spacecraft that
disappeared from radio contact
just a few minutes before it was
scheduled to touch down on Dec.
3. The signal was thought to be
received on two instances, Dec.
18 and Jan. 4."
February 20,1985:
"The increase in next year's
Stanford undergraduate tuition
marks the first time tuition here
has exceeded $10,000. but the rise
appears consistent with increases
at other major universities.
Stanford's tuition increase, from
$9,705 to $10,476. coupled with a
6.5 percent increase in room and
board, will bring the total cost of at
tending Stanford to $14,885,
Stanford tuition will still be less
than that of Harvard, Yale, and
Brown, but not by a great margin.
Out-of-state students attending
schools in the University of Cali
fornia system will face a great tu
ition increase. Tuition will rise to
$3,800 from the current $3,400, a
rise of 11.8 percent, if the increase
is approved by the board of re
gents. according to Jorge Garza, as
sistant director of registration at
UC-Berkeley.
The cost for California residents
to attend University of California
schools will remain constant at ap
proximately $673 a semester"
