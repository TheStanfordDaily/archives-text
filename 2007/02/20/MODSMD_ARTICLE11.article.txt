# PEER COUNSELING
## Bridge counselors say atmosphere relaxed, informal 'First line of defense' for students who need to talk 
### MARISSA MILLER 
Kyle Evaldez and Marcella Chibharo are in
the midst of a serious workplace debate. A
grave accusation-issued moments before-still
hangs in the air. awaiting a reply.
"1 can't watch 'My Super Sweet Sixteen' be
cause you taped over it," Marcella insists. She
fixes Kyle with an unforgiving stare.
"I TiVo-ed 'Heroes,'" he cries over her
laughter. "I'm sorry!"
The two sophomores have draped them
selves over a couch in the front hall of Rogers
House. A bag of Sour Patch Kids lies between
them. There is no receptionist here, no waiting
room or glossy self-help pamphlets. There are
only squishy chairs and piles of junk food, and
a small group of friendly, laid-back Stanford
students.
After all. this isn't Vaden-this is the Bridge.
The Bridge Peer Counseling Center is an
antidote to the Vaden blues, a place for stu
dents to call or drop-bv when they're stressed
or upset,or just need to talk.Staffed entirely by
students - both graduate and undergrad - it
provides a 24-hour support system for the
Stanford community.
"We're the first line of defense," Marcella
says. Reaching for another Sour Patch Kid.
Kyle nods in agreement.

Initially formed as a student-run drug reha
bilitation center, the Bridge's function has
evolved considerably since its inception in
1971. Three live-in staffers- Evaldez, Laurence
Moore '08. and Marisa Schottelkorb 06-pro
vide drop-in counseling from 9 am to midnight.
Here, students are encouraged to discuss any
thing on their mind-from stress over an im
pending I HUM paper to their struggles with an
eating disorder or depression. The center's 24-
hour phone lines,managed by twenty-five part
time volunteers, also offer assistance to the
community.
In order to become a counselor for the
Bridge, students must complete Education
193 A: Core Listening Skills, as well as Educa
tion IC)3P:1 C )3P: Peer Counseling at the Bridge. Both
courses, a combined workload of only three
units, are offered each quarter.
Professor Mary Mendoza-Newman, a li
censed psychologist at Vaden's analogous
Counseling And Psychological Services pro
gram. teaches the course, and sections are led
by current Bridge counselors. To hone their
communication skills, students discuss text
book scenarios and perform role-playing exer
cises. At times, they even share their own prob
lems and seek advice from each other.
Evaldez stumbled across the class at the be
ginning of his freshman year. Entering Stan
ford as a prospective Computer Science major,
he took the class on a whim.
"My HPAC said he'd heard good things
about it."he said.
Like so many Stanford students, he found
his interests shitting with the discovery of a
new passion.
"That quarter, CS didn't really work out for
me,but I fell in love with the Bridge class," he said.
Inspired by his experience with the Bridge,
he now plans to pursue a major in psychology.
"Not only is it rewarding helping the com
munity." Evaldez explains, "but I really think I

could be doing this long-term."
Not only aspiring psychologists opt to he
come Bridge counselors: Chibbaro is an Inter
national Relations major. Like Evaldez, she
took the course on the recommendation of a
friend and found herself enjoying it more than
she anticipated. However, she has come to
view her work as more than a hobby-she sees
it as an important part of the effort to address
mental health issues on campus.
"There are a lot of people who need help
and aren't reaching out for it, so I like being
part of this community that's trying to be there
for them." she says.
Some people, on the other hand, simply take the
course to acquire better communication skills.
"They're good life skills, just listening skills." F.valdez
insists. "I mean, if you actually want to learn some
thing useful," he adds with a grin.
Life at the Bridge
As if in respect to its past, the atmosphere at
the center still retains traces of a more laid
back era. The staff room is pleasantly disorgan
ized: a desk stands in one corner, papers scat
tered all across its surface. Nearby, two beat-up
couches face a large-screen TV— the one over
which debate had ensued earlier.
ITie staffers are not solemn-faced, anti-sep
tic professionals, either. All come across as
warm,caring people, but no two counselors are
truly the same.Together, they illustrate a cross
section of Stanford personalities, with each
counselor bringing different skills and experi
ences to the table.
"We have super-loud, energetic people like
Whitney [Martin '09] and then we have like the
really, really quiet, shy staffers, but there's no
one common personality." says Evaldez. "The

one common trait is that we all want to help
people, as cheesy as that sounds."
"It's a commitment to listening to and car
ing about people, and also to Stanford, and
giving back to the community," adds Chib
baro.
1 n the hierarchy of Stanford's mental health
community, the Bridge lies somewhere be
tween talking to your RA and seeking help
from CAPS. The Bridge offers anonymity, in
contrast to talks with dormmates, but also pres
ents itself as a lighter, more immediate alterna
tive to CAPS.
"It's a different structure than going to your
RA.just in terms of our methods and the way
that we talk to people," Chibbaro said.
Moore sees being a stranger as an advan
tage.
"We're the people who don't have prior as
sumptions about you, so, in that sense, it might
be easier to talk to us, because you don't have a
relationship with us," he said.
Chibbaro says that the peer-oriented nature
of the Bridge makes it more accessible than
CAPS. She describes the centers' relationship
as a "partnership."
"For a lot of people, [we're] the ones they
feel comfortable calling, like their peers, for
free services they don't have to deal with any
logistical type-planning things for." she said.
"But there are cases where we can't help them
and we recognize that."
Heightened Stress,
Awareness Increase Visits
On average, the center conducts one coun
sel-either a phone call or a drop-in-each day.
Recently, though, the center has had closer to
two or three.The staff attributes this to the win

ter quarter weather, as well as midterm-in
duced stress.
"Our counsels definitely go up during peak
emotional periods," explains Evaldez.
The rise in counsels could also be due to in
creasing awareness about mental health on
campus. According to Bridge counselors, after
the apparent suicide of Mengyao "May"
Zhou, students have begun to pay closer at
tention to the effects of the Stanford Duck
Syndrome.
Nikki Freeman, a freshman staffer at the
Bridge, is already familiar with it: she says that
she encounters it every day in her dorm.Naran
ja.
With a Bridge counselor sign on her door,
her peers know they can approach her for help
Behind closed doors, they are open about their
struggles, but outside, she says, they appear
cheerful and carefree.
"People try and act like everything's com
pletely fine and under control, but you know,
you know that they're going through stuff."
Freeman says.
She wants Stanford students to know that
the Bridge is there to listen.
"People think that you can only come to
the Bridge if you have something really seri
ous to talk about-anything else you should he
able to deal with on your own. But you don't
have to deal with that on your own. That's
what we're here for-really, you can talk about
anything."

Initially formed as a student-run drug reha
bilitation center, the Bridge's function has
evolved considerably since its inception in
1971. Three live-in staffers- Evaldez, Laurence
Moore '08. and Marisa Schottelkorb 06-pro
vide drop-in counseling from 9 am to midnight.
Here, students are encouraged to discuss any
thing on their mind-from stress over an im
pending I HUM paper to their struggles with an
eating disorder or depression. The center's 24-
hour phone lines,managed by twenty-five part
time volunteers, also offer assistance to the
community.
In order to become a counselor for the
Bridge, students must complete Education
193 A: Core Listening Skills, as well as Educa
tion IC)3P:1 C )3P: Peer Counseling at the Bridge. Both
courses, a combined workload of only three
units, are offered each quarter.
Professor Mary Mendoza-Newman, a li
censed psychologist at Vaden's analogous
Counseling And Psychological Services pro
gram. teaches the course, and sections are led
by current Bridge counselors. To hone their
communication skills, students discuss text
book scenarios and perform role-playing exer
cises. At times, they even share their own prob
lems and seek advice from each other.
Evaldez stumbled across the class at the be
ginning of his freshman year. Entering Stan
ford as a prospective Computer Science major,
he took the class on a whim.
"My HPAC said he'd heard good things
about it."he said.
Like so many Stanford students, he found
his interests shitting with the discovery of a
new passion.
"That quarter, CS didn't really work out for
me,but I fell in love with the Bridge class," he said.
Inspired by his experience with the Bridge,
he now plans to pursue a major in psychology.
"Not only is it rewarding helping the com
munity." Evaldez explains, "but I really think I

could be doing this long-term."
Not only aspiring psychologists opt to he
come Bridge counselors: Chibbaro is an Inter
national Relations major. Like Evaldez, she
took the course on the recommendation of a
friend and found herself enjoying it more than
she anticipated. However, she has come to
view her work as more than a hobby-she sees
it as an important part of the effort to address
mental health issues on campus.
"There are a lot of people who need help
and aren't reaching out for it, so I like being
part of this community that's trying to be there
for them." she says.
Some people, on the other hand, simply take the
course to acquire better communication skills.
"They're good life skills, just listening skills." F.valdez
insists. "I mean, if you actually want to learn some
thing useful," he adds with a grin.
Life at the Bridge
As if in respect to its past, the atmosphere at
the center still retains traces of a more laid
back era. The staff room is pleasantly disorgan
ized: a desk stands in one corner, papers scat
tered all across its surface. Nearby, two beat-up
couches face a large-screen TV— the one over
which debate had ensued earlier.
ITie staffers are not solemn-faced, anti-sep
tic professionals, either. All come across as
warm,caring people, but no two counselors are
truly the same.Together, they illustrate a cross
section of Stanford personalities, with each
counselor bringing different skills and experi
ences to the table.
"We have super-loud, energetic people like
Whitney [Martin '09] and then we have like the
really, really quiet, shy staffers, but there's no
one common personality." says Evaldez. "The

one common trait is that we all want to help
people, as cheesy as that sounds."
"It's a commitment to listening to and car
ing about people, and also to Stanford, and
giving back to the community," adds Chib
baro.
1 n the hierarchy of Stanford's mental health
community, the Bridge lies somewhere be
tween talking to your RA and seeking help
from CAPS. The Bridge offers anonymity, in
contrast to talks with dormmates, but also pres
ents itself as a lighter, more immediate alterna
tive to CAPS.
"It's a different structure than going to your
RA.just in terms of our methods and the way
that we talk to people," Chibbaro said.
Moore sees being a stranger as an advan
tage.
"We're the people who don't have prior as
sumptions about you, so, in that sense, it might
be easier to talk to us, because you don't have a
relationship with us," he said.
Chibbaro says that the peer-oriented nature
of the Bridge makes it more accessible than
CAPS. She describes the centers' relationship
as a "partnership."
"For a lot of people, [we're] the ones they
feel comfortable calling, like their peers, for
free services they don't have to deal with any
logistical type-planning things for." she said.
"But there are cases where we can't help them
and we recognize that."
Heightened Stress,
Awareness Increase Visits
On average, the center conducts one coun
sel-either a phone call or a drop-in-each day.
Recently, though, the center has had closer to
two or three.The staff attributes this to the win

ter quarter weather, as well as midterm-in
duced stress.
"Our counsels definitely go up during peak
emotional periods," explains Evaldez.
The rise in counsels could also be due to in
creasing awareness about mental health on
campus. According to Bridge counselors, after
the apparent suicide of Mengyao "May"
Zhou, students have begun to pay closer at
tention to the effects of the Stanford Duck
Syndrome.
