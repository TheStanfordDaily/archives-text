Why did you come to
Stanford?That?s a long story. Most
people from the Czech Republic
don?t attend school abroad. English
is taught as a second language, but
most people don'.'t function that well
in it.They also don'.'t have the system
of testing and recommendations
there that we have here — I was the
first person to ever ask my high
school teachers for a recommenda
tion. for example.
I was accepted to a "gymnasium."
an exclusive (though public) college
preparatory school. From there I got
the opportunity to travel to the IJK
for a month. The education was phe
nomenal. The Czech educational sys
tem is very different — for example
people don't ask questions, or teach
ers lecture about facts, so there are no
conceptual or critical thinking. On
the other hand, the UK has a system
more similar to the U.S.. and 1 loved
it. Instead of going to what would
have been l()th grade in Prague, I
went to the U.S. on exchange in South

Dakota for a year. I had heard that I
might be able to graduate and get a
high school diploma as a junior, so I
started talking to everyone there. I
wanted to show people back home
that I had a diploma — but the prin
cipal said that they couldn?t give me

a diploma as a junior, only having
been there for a few months. So I
signed up with an international com
pany that evaluated my Czech tran
script— and I had about 1.5 times
the credits I needed. So I graduated
and they said that they would send
me the diploma in the mail.
When I got back to Prague, I did
n't want to finish Czech high school,
since I already had a U.S. diploma.
So. I left the school and applied to the
University of New York in Prague.
They weren't supposed to accept me
without a diploma, but they told me

they could wait until it came. And,
four months later, it did. If it didn't!
university would kick me out, and I
would essentially he a high school
drop-out with no chance of further
education.
How did I choose Stanford? Be
cause of Stanford culture, which is
creative, entrepreneurial and inno
vative. Stanford was nothing 50 years
ago, and now it's one of the best in
the world. It has an amazing momen
tum and it develops so quickly. I want
to develop together with it, also as
quickly.
Of the honors you have earned,
which ones mean the most to you?
As they say, "the chase is better than
the catch." I don't care about the ti
tles of the awards. I care about what I
have achieved. Winning isn?t that
important.

It the devil offered me the same deal [as Faust],l
would take it. I am one of those people who wants
to know and discover and change the world. 11
DAN IFT k'RT/Pk' oniA,

What was your darkest moment?
People tend to forget had things. Ob
viously. there's nothing huge.
What do you love (or hate) about
Stanford? Hate: Stanford bureaucra
cy. I try not to let school get in the way
of my education, as they say. Stanford
food. Love: Everything else. I love
Stanford culture. 1 love the concentra
tion of talent — the brilliant people.
Everyone is brilliant here.
What is your favorite novel? I
don't read novels that often. What
book changed my life? Faust, proba
bly. He was curious about every
thing. If the devil offered me the
same deal, I would sign it. I am one of
those people who wants to know and
discover and change the world.
