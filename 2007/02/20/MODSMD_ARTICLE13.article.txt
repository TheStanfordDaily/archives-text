## Gates Foundation funds the fight against TB Bill and Melinda Gates donate $7.5 million for gene database 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
A team of Stanford scientists, along with re
searchers at MIT and Harvard, are currently work
ing on a $7.5 million, four-year project funded by
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that they
hope will advance the fight against tuberculosis
(TB).
The project aims to create a bioinformatics plat
lorm that will store data from large-scale TB exper
iments and make them accessible to the public.The
scientists working on the database hope that the in
formation will improve and accelerate drug and
vaccine development, especially in the latent form
of the disease. Current drug regimens — which can
last for up to nine months — are complex,and some
strains of TB are developing drug resistance.
"The goal is to create a database that will allow
users to seamlessly move between experimental
data generated in the lab and gene annotation

data "said Gavin Sherlock.an assistant professor of
genetics and co-principal investigator of the proj
ect.
"['lTie database will] help facilitate new drug dis
covery by having all the information they need in
one place." said Catherine Ball, another co-princi
pal investigator and senior research scientist. "The
emphasis can be made on innovation and discover*
rather than hours and weeks and months accumu
lating information."
The idea for the database stemmed from the ex
istence of three other TB programs that currently
receive funding from the Gates Foundation. Ilie
center of these programs is located at Stanford and
is run by Gary Schoolnik, professor of medicine and
the principal investigator of the newest project.
"We saw that there was a need." Schoolnik said.
"The basic programs having to do with TB weren't
going to be successful without the database."
Schoolnik said the first version of the database
— called "Fast Track Database" — will be released
by next October. It will be a stripped down version
of what the research team hopes will be the end re
sult.
"It's not going to have all the bells and whistles."
he said.

In addition to creating the database, scientists
are also using the Gates Foundation grant money to
conduct research on the latent I B genes that are ex
pressed in human tissue, a previously unexplored
field.
"We are quite clearly trying to achieve major
technological breakthroughs that have never been
achieved before," Schoolnik said.
Schoolnik acknowledged that one major logis
tical problem in studying latent TB in humans is
the acquisition of infected tissue. Because the
messenger RNA used to study the disease has a
half-life of only two to three minutes, tissues must
be taken directly from patients during surgery
and proper!) stored, rather than collected post
mortem.
Tuberculosis is responsible for two to three mil
lion deaths worldwide per year. 1 lowever, a signifi
cant portion of the population — approximately
one in three people — is infected with TB, with the
majority carrying the latent form, which is often
found in the lungs. Active infection usually occurs in
people whose immune systems are compromised,
such as those infected with lUV.
