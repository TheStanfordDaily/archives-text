## Editorial Board Where have all the campus activists gone?

I n perhaps the strongest rebuke of Presi
dent Bush's Iraq policy to date, the
1 louse of Representatives voted 246-182
last Friday against the administration's plan
to send 21,5(X) additional troops to the front
lines. Although the anti-surge resolution is
non-binding, it sends a clear message to the
Hush administration that lawmakers are in
creasingly weary of our open-ended com
mitment to the war-ravaged nation.
I he House vote reflected Americans'
growing outrage over the war's disastrous
planning and execution. With war approval
ratings near all-time lows, Americans have
never before been so united against the
Bush administration's Iraq policy'lhe De
mocrats' sweeping gains in the midterm
elections are evidence that public opposi
tion to the war has reached a lever pitch.
Not so here on campus. As we approach
the fourth anniversary of the ill-fated cam
paign's launch — longer than American in
volvement in World War II —student dis
satisfaction with the war does not appear to
have kept pace with that of most Americans.
When it has occurred, student reaction to
the war has been muted.
During the height of the Vietnam con
llict in the late '60s and early '70s. hardly a
day went by without an anti-war demon
stration at the University. Students and fac
ulty members alike colluded to oppose an
unpopular war. In collaboration with
protests throughout the nation, mobiliza
tion on a massive scale forced national poli
cy makers to listen to student concerns.
Protests against the Iraq war. in contrast,
have fallen lar short those of Vietnam in
both frequency and in size.'lb be fair, some
smaller events have been staged on campus.
Student and faculty activists organized a se
ries of "Books not Bombs" rallies in White
Plaza during the first year of the war. but
these protests have not been replicated
since. President Bush's visit to the Hoover
institution of April 2006 drew an impressive
crowd of activists and onlookers, although il
is unclear how many were explicitly protest
ing the war. In November, an anonymous
student group called "project Alive To"
sketched 900 chalk outlines of fallen sol
diers and civilians to raise awareness of the
loss of life resulting from the war. Yet be

yond these notable instances of student ac
tivism, discussion of the war has been large
ly limited to lecture halls and email chat
lists.
Of course, Iraq differs from Vietnam in
one critical aspect: 'lliere has been no civil
ian draft, and nor is a draft likely to occur.
Vietnam-era protests often focused as much
on the draft as on the conduct of the war it
self. Further, the 58.000 American fatalities
suffered during Vietnam is a 112 igure which
dwarfs the 3,100-plus American soldiers
who have lost their lives in Iraq. Absent the
credible possibility of a draft, it can be easy
to lose sight of the grave peril faced by thou
sands of our brave troops in Iraq.
Yet even il direct comparisons with Viet
nam are imperfect, they help to illuminate
the relative lack of concern with which stu
dents have met the war on this campus. Al
though the possibility of being drafted is
minimal, our generation surely must be
alarmed by the administration's refusal to
construct a timeline for a troop drawdown
or to provide adequate incentives for Iraqis
to assume responsibility for their own secu
rity. If nothing else, students should be con
cerned with the deficit spending necessitat
ed In the war's outsized costs, the interest
on which will be funded by taxes on our fu
ture earnings.
If some students are truly apathetic
about the Iraq debacle, perhaps il is time to
fight the temptation to succumb to the om
nipresent Stanford bubble. Ihe substantial
number who harbor unspoken misgivings
about the war should bear in mind that si
lence iseasih mistaken for complacence, or
even tacit support.
Public demonstrations are not necessari
ly the best course of action for students to
take, as protests can be divisive, ineffective
or even counterproductive. Alternative
forms of expression can be more fruitful,
ranging from writing senators and represen
tatives to taking part in discussion forums.
But let us strive to engage in constructive di
alogue about an ill-fated war that seems to
have reached a breaking point in the nation
al psyche, but about which many students
appear to remain dispassionate. If circum
stances allow, perhaps the Iruits of that dis
cussion can effect change at a broader level.
