My personal introduction to the stark
reality of global warming came in
the form of Tim Hanncry's hand
some hardcover volume entitled, " The
Weather Makers." the cover of which fea
tures a menacing graphic of a helpless ice
cube a-flambe. Now a bestseller in paper
back. this harrowing little text told me all
about global warming, a topic about which I
had absolutely no prior knowledge. Of
course. I had heard the term bounced
around on NPR. but why would the globe
warm? I had no idea.
hi my high school courses, there was near
ly no mention of global warming, although
there was a brief hint in our biology textbook
about the dire consequences of overpopula
tion and energy consumption. 'I here were,
also, the cryptic allusions made by my high
school physics teacher, who intimated to me
that the world was going to hell in a hand-bas
ket. I lowcvcr. sonic members of the school's
administration were loud opponents of glob
al warming, so I suspect that the physics
teacher was being intentionally vague.
My hot little hands grasped "'lhe Weath
er Makers" shortly after 1 heard all the fuss
about (tore's conveniently-summarized
I ruth. F mbarrassed at my lack of knowl
edge. and not wanting to get my knowledge
from a layman ((lore), I plowed through
Ihe Weather Makers." a volume that occa
sionally made me rejoice in my own scholar
ly instincts and occasionally made me want
to throw myself out the dingy window of my
morning train. All this happened last sum
mer I was IS years old. and an incoming
sophomore at Stanford.
Global warming is perhaps the most
pressing issue currently facing our interna
tional community.so why the hell did I learn
about it so preposterously late in my intel
lectual development? Was it my fault? Was
it my high school's fault? Or was
it...gasp...Stanford's fault? I say all of tile
above. I should have been more on the cur
rent events ball, my high school curricula
should have been more comprehensive,and
Stanford's General Education Require
ments should mandate that students leave
the I Jniversity with at least a cursory under
standing of the most pressing matters at
hand.
Gentle reader, I don't intend to malicn

our gracious University's commitment to
our intellectual growth,but merely to prod it
in a better direction. And that direction is to
ward comprehensive education on global
climate change. We students come to Stan
ford from varying personal and educational
backgrounds, and so the I Jniversity smartly
puts us through a program of (ilißs, pre
sumably designed us to put us all on the
same intellectual playing field. Regardless
of our prior experience, we all come out of
llll'M and PWR (or glorious Sl.las the
case may be) with a roughly equitable
knowledge of formal paper-writing, group
presenting, etc. Hie University lias thus
done its noble duty of putting our young
minds on the same page, at least in terms of
basic literacy.
We must also work our way through the
rest ol the (iIRs, which, in addition to
111 l 'M. I'WR. etc. include (what are now
called) I)isciplinary Breadth and Education
for Citizenship requirements. Completion
of the Disciplinary Breadth involves, among
other things, taking one course each in the
areas ol Natural Sciences and I ; ngineering
and Applied Sciences. Ihe environmentally
concerned student has a bevy of courses
Irom which to choose when it comes to ful
filling these requirements. One could, for
example.take "( ontrollingClimate ( hange
in the 21st Century" and "Hnvironmcntal
Planning Methods," which fall into the
NatSci and IngrAppSci categories, respec
tively I low ever, one could also draw one's
scientific education from a variety of fuzzy
friendly courses, including the disco-ready
"I asers.tlie l ight fantastic," the cryptically
titled "(Jood Products. Bad Products" and
the eminently pertinent "Renaissance Ma
chine Design" (NatSci. I ngrAppSci and
IngrAppSci. respectively).

It seems.based on the offerings in
the NatSci and EngrAppSci areas
that this part of the Disciplinary
Breadth seeks to inform students
about the process and form of scien
tific discovery and inquiry, rather
than the specifics of modern science.
Indeed, what do "Environmental
Planning" and "Lasers, the Light
Fantastic" have in common, apart
from their presumably shared com
mitment to the scientific method?
And certainly the humanities re
quirements seek to do the same sort
of thing — to educate to the general
rather than the specific. Students
aren't asked to read iind write about
the same books, but rather to come
away with a basic ability to read,
write and analyze.

While I don't question the
Broad-Rather-Than-Specific ap
proach in the humanities. I do ques
tion it in the sciences. Much as it
hurts me. as an English major, to say
this, the fiction we read is not imme
diately relevant to our world. How
ever. global warming certainly is.
and it's criminal to send a student
away from a top-notch university
without introducing her to such es
sential problems of the modern
world. Had I not picked up "The
Weather Makers" last summer, and
had I immersed myself in "Lasers,
the Light Fantastic" instead of
"Controlling Climate Change in the
21st Century," I could presumably
have left Stanford as an environ
mental ignoramus.
The GERs clearly aim to give us
both a Disciplinary Breadth of
knowledge as well as an Education
for Citizenship. Does this mean sim
ply giving us the methodology with
which to examine our world? Or

does it mean introducing us to the
most pressing matters of that
world? I believe that the OMRs
could and should be used to accom
plish both,and for this reason. I pro
pose that environmental literacy
become a mandatory part of the
GERs. This could be accomplished
either by making the Disciplinary
Breadth science requirements more
pertinent to our modern climate, or
by making part of the I ducat ion for
Citizenship requirements more sci
ence-oriented. While we are intelli
gent young things, with lithe brains
equipped to tackle the problems of
our age, the risk of sending some
poor girl out Stanford's gates with
out a knowledge of, say, global
warming, is too large a gamble to
take.

If you think Ruth is really stupid for
not having figured out about global
wanning sooner, tell her by emailing
