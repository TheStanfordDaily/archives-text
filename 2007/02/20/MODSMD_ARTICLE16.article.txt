My personal introduction to the stark
reality of global warming came in
the form of Tim Hanncry's hand
some hardcover volume entitled, " The
Weather Makers." the cover of which fea
tures a menacing graphic of a helpless ice
cube a-flambe. Now a bestseller in paper
back. this harrowing little text told me all
about global warming, a topic about which I
had absolutely no prior knowledge. Of
course. I had heard the term bounced
around on NPR. but why would the globe
warm? I had no idea.
hi my high school courses, there was near
ly no mention of global warming, although
there was a brief hint in our biology textbook
about the dire consequences of overpopula
tion and energy consumption. 'I here were,
also, the cryptic allusions made by my high
school physics teacher, who intimated to me
that the world was going to hell in a hand-bas
ket. I lowcvcr. sonic members of the school's
administration were loud opponents of glob
al warming, so I suspect that the physics
teacher was being intentionally vague.
My hot little hands grasped "'lhe Weath
er Makers" shortly after 1 heard all the fuss
about (tore's conveniently-summarized
I ruth. F mbarrassed at my lack of knowl
edge. and not wanting to get my knowledge
from a layman ((lore), I plowed through
Ihe Weather Makers." a volume that occa
sionally made me rejoice in my own scholar
ly instincts and occasionally made me want
to throw myself out the dingy window of my
morning train. All this happened last sum
mer I was IS years old. and an incoming
sophomore at Stanford.
Global warming is perhaps the most
pressing issue currently facing our interna
tional community.so why the hell did I learn
about it so preposterously late in my intel
lectual development? Was it my fault? Was
it my high school's fault? Or was
it...gasp...Stanford's fault? I say all of tile
above. I should have been more on the cur
rent events ball, my high school curricula
should have been more comprehensive,and
Stanford's General Education Require
ments should mandate that students leave
the I Jniversity with at least a cursory under
standing of the most pressing matters at
hand.
Gentle reader, I don't intend to malicn

our gracious University's commitment to
our intellectual growth,but merely to prod it
in a better direction. And that direction is to
ward comprehensive education on global
climate change. We students come to Stan
ford from varying personal and educational
backgrounds, and so the I Jniversity smartly
puts us through a program of (ili√üs, pre
sumably designed us to put us all on the
same intellectual playing field. Regardless
of our prior experience, we all come out of
llll'M and PWR (or glorious Sl.las the
case may be) with a roughly equitable
knowledge of formal paper-writing, group
presenting, etc. Hie University lias thus
done its noble duty of putting our young
minds on the same page, at least in terms of
basic literacy.
We must also work our way through the
rest ol the (iIRs, which, in addition to
111 l 'M. I'WR. etc. include (what are now
called) I)isciplinary Breadth and Education
for Citizenship requirements. Completion
of the Disciplinary Breadth involves, among
other things, taking one course each in the
areas ol Natural Sciences and I ; ngineering
and Applied Sciences. Ihe environmentally
concerned student has a bevy of courses
Irom which to choose when it comes to ful
filling these requirements. One could, for
example.take "( ontrollingClimate ( hange
in the 21st Century" and "Hnvironmcntal
Planning Methods," which fall into the
NatSci and IngrAppSci categories, respec
tively I low ever, one could also draw one's
scientific education from a variety of fuzzy
friendly courses, including the disco-ready
"I asers.tlie l ight fantastic," the cryptically
titled "(Jood Products. Bad Products" and
the eminently pertinent "Renaissance Ma
chine Design" (NatSci. I ngrAppSci and
IngrAppSci. respectively).
