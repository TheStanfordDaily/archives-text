# Live the dream

### 
There's a right way and a wrong way to
play intramural basketball. The right
way involves megaphones, costumes,
trick plays and rocket sauce, llie wrong way
involves rules, regulations, athleticism and
any urge whatsoever to win. People who
take IM seriously should be chemically cas
trated and forced into indentured labor in
the salt mines. Fortunately, the seniors of
Kappa Sigma do not suffer from a strong
sense of competition, not when losing spec
tacularly is so much more fun.
'I lie origins of Senior Dream Team —
when the seniors get together.get drunk and
play in Harlem Globetrotter style with the
skill level of drunk midget quadriplegics —
is shrouded in mystery. It is whispered
among the elders of our Fraternity that the
tradition dates back to the Dawn of'lime,
when (iod created basketball. Naturally
athletic animals like bears and cheetahs
rocked the house with NBA Street moves.
Some of the less gifted creatures, like the
three-toed sloth and the lazy-assed croco
dile, wanted to play, but they knew there was
110 way they could compete with the big
boys. Ilie penguin, being a quick-thinking
fellow with ;i predilection for cheap vodka,
suggested that, rather than even try to win.
they should kick back a few brews and just
have fun losing.' I lie suggestion was accept
ed by all, cheap liquor was mixed with vari
ous juices, and Senior Dream 'leam was
born.
Senior Dream leam exemplifies every
thing Stanford claims to be. and shits in the
face of everything Stanford really is. At a
school fearlessly devoted to conquering
midterms and student groups in trench-war
lare style attrition, we happy few bravely
race to the bottom of the intramural stand
ings. While lesser men spend off-days prac
ticing and researching their opponents, we
spend the rest of the week thinking up po
tential costume themes. So far. we've done
WASPs, non-basketball sports and execu
tives. We still have yet to wear our official
Dream leam t-shirts. which feature two ma
jestic unicorns silhouetted against a rain
bow, one mounting the other in what looks
like painful procreation. Justin, one of the
shirts' designers, explains. "Some say the
rainbow above the unicorns implies that
they arc gay, but 1 say it's because unicorn
sex is so magical." It's a hell of a shirt.
The bliss of Senior Dream leam is that,
for once, we don't even have to try. 1 lie
worst player on the team starts the game on
all-time offense, cherry-picking at our bas
ket while everyone cise bothers with de
fense. When I was all-time offense. I scored
my first basket in competitive play since Bth
grade (when, by some horrific twist of fate
and poor drafting. I was the tallest kid on my
team, which meant that I had to play for
ward, which meant I had the rare honor of
having more fouls than points scored.) I Jsu
ally. by the second half, there are two or
three cherry-pickers. You get dehydrated
quickly when your water is spiked. We are

the third-string All Star team, heroes for the
losers. We do our best to dishonor the Intra
mural League. Stanford. John Arrillaga and
the very sport of basketball.
Like all important movements through
out human history. Senior Dream'leam has
come under lire from the authorities for
trespassing against the repressive bonds of
the state, breaking the bars of our beautiful
cage. It's a little-known and somewhat un
necessary fact that alcohol, like showers and
proper air conditioning, is not allowed in
side the Arrillaga Family Center. (But is it
the Arrillaga Center for Families, or the
Center for the Arrillaga Family and its mul
tifarious operations? And if it's the latter,
where's the secret elevator to the nuclear
sub-basement where 'Hie Man himself plots
global domination?) Disallowing alcohol
from a gym is kind of like banning sex from
libraries — sure, it's unsanitary, but who's
gonna know, and who wouldn't want to try
it? And what kind of silly goose actually
takes the totalitarian measure of banning it?
()h, that's right, his name is on the gym.
Anyhow, a few of our noble number ar
rived two 'lliursdays previous wearing lull
suits — Justin even had an earpiece like the
bad guy on "24." though if you looked closely
you'd notice an "Xbox" symbol engraved in
the side. Unaware of the ban on fun drinks,
they had with them a container of the Blessed
Rocket Sauce. I he ID checkers at the front
desk, fearless defenders of meaningless
regulations, demanded that they throw away
the container. Although they couldn't tell it
was alcoholic, apparently anything but water
is disallowed from the gym (you wouldn't
want to get anyspotson the equipment, or the
walls or the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
floors.)
Our teammates, thinking nothing of it.
tossed out the container and ran onto the
court. "Ilie game that night was unusual in
that we were actually in the lead for nearly
three minutes.' I lie notion of victory, more
foreign to us than post-modern Mongolian
epic poetry, tantalized from its forbidden
mountain.
"Slow down boys." the coach said. "Run
some plays."
Our strategy includes a number of plays
derived from motion pictures, other sports
and the sexual behavior of amphibious sea
creatures. Iliere's the OB sneak, where
everyone lines up at half court in a football
style formation: three guys on the ()-line.one
guy hiking, one guy in back. After the hike,
the front four scatter in a disruptive pattern
as if waiting for a pass, confusing the other

team. Hie quarterback counts to lour and
then takes a half court shot. Works every
time, and sometimes we even score.
I here's also the I'lying V. taken from
"Hie Mighty Ducks," and Quad Cover,
where we choose the douchiest player on the
other time and quadruple-team him.'lhere's
always at least one guy who takes everything
super-seriously, usually because he played
back in high school, wasn't good enough to
walk on here, knows he's gaining beer weight
and kids himself into thinking that an intra
mural championship will quiet his silent
screams. One such fellow, a tall blond fresh
man clearly unprepared for our antics, actu
ally walked out alter we Quad Covered him.
What an uncouth douehebag. And after we
basically gave his team a free game.
Our best play, though, is Team All-Star.
Ihat s when every player on the team whose
ancestors did not come from Nigeria clears
oil the court, leaving Ayo. the only guy on the
team with any actual skill in basketball,
alone against iive defenders. It may sound
controversial, but it's actually our most suc
cessful play.
Ihis particular night, though, the game
was interrupted by the buzz. It seems that
the (iym People went all detective, fished
the container out ol the trash can. smelled
the gallon ol vodka we'd emptied into a half
pint ol juice, and phoned the policemen.
I Ipon being inlormed that we had 110 more
alcohol, that all our players were over 2l.and
that our goal was to lose as badly as possible,
the policeman admitted that he could give
hall a rat s ass. Ilie (iym People, however,
would have none ol that, and threatened to
kick out our offending teammates. Appar
ently, the charge was Throwing Away Alco
hol. or perhaps Not Breaking' Hie Rules or
even Doing Kxaetly What You Told Us To
Do, You 1 lorrible Fascist Pigs.
lliey threatened to eject one of our team
mates, a former baseball player, who'd earli
er leapt to keep the ball inbounds and ended
up running right through an emergency exit.
Ihat. my friends, is l ucking Dedication.
Ibat s why its all lor one and one for all 011
Senior Dream leam. You throw one of us
out. you throw us all out. And you can't
throw us out, because we forfeit. We sped
back to the house (don't worry mom, we
have sober drivers, and they're not even
drunk) and prepared for Pub Night.
Iherc aren t enough traditions like Se
nior Dream leam left on this campus —
loose. easygoing, anti-competition, liven the
rrisbcc golfers keep score. Don't fall into the
type-A trap, my friends. lake a few shots of
cheap liquor, put on a soccer jersey or an all
loo-revealing Speedo and play some basket-
Mil the way God intended you to: poorly,
ridiculously,gloriously. Don't try to win .lust
try to Dream.
