## CARD HOLD STRONG Stanford cuts down on turnovers, upsets No. 15 Ducks to stay in Pac-10 race 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
After Thursday's sloppy game against
Oregon State — in which the Cardinal
matched its season high in turnovers with
22 — the team knew that it wouldn't be
able to get away with a similar perform
ance against No. 15 Oregon on Saturday.
Hie Ducks (20-7. 8-7 Pacific-10 Con
ference). after all. are known to be one of
the fastest teams in the country, earning
their ranking by turning opponents' mis
takes into fast-break layups. And when it
comes to ball handling, Stanford (17-8,9-
5) makes more mistakes than any other
team in the conference, turning the ball
over 15.1 times per game on average.
On Saturday, however, the Cardinal
held onto the ball, kept the game in the
half-court and trounced the Ducks, 88-69.
Stanford has not lost to Oregon at home
since 1986 — before all but four of the
Card's players were born.
"We had 16 assists and six turnovers
against a team that's explosive and very
quick," head coach Trent Johnson said.
"That's pretty impressive. This was as
close to a complete game as we could have
played at this time of the year."
The Cardinal stitled Oregon's offense,
as well. Guards Aaron Brooks and Tajuan
Porter poured in 25 and 20 points, respec
tively, but the I )ucks shot only 41.3 percent
as Stanford held their bench scoreless.
"1 thought we did a decent job at the
point of attack," Johnson said. "Brooks
and Porter settled for a lot of long threes."
The Cardinal's execution extended to
the free throw line, where the team made
29 of 32 shots. Stanford didn't miss a shot
at the line until Oregon started to foul in
tentionally with 3:22 to play in the game.
Freshman forward Brook Lopez set a
new career high in points with a game-high
26. to go with nine rebounds. Lopez keyed
a 20-2 Cardinal run in the second half that
began with a jumper by sophomore guard
Mitch Johnson with 10:51 to play.
Moments later. Lopez blocked Oregon
center Maarty Leunen and scored at the
other end to make it 63-56. After a
Lawrence Hill lay-up, Lopez scored seven
consecutive points: a jumper, three-point
play and dunk.
"In the first half. I was settling for a lot
of fade-away jumpers, so at halftime 1 de
cided to be strong, take it to the basket
and try to get fouled." Lopez said. "They

were trying to overplay the post and deny
the entry pass, so we tried to go backdoor
and attack them."
Four of senior guard Fred Washing
ton's career-high-tying eight assists came
on passes to Lopez. Washington also
scored 12 points.
But Lopez and Washington weren't
the only players to set career highs. Mitch
Johnson and redshirt sophomore Kenny
Brown, who has been seeing a spike in
minutes with sophomore guard Anthony
Goods nursing a sprained ankle, both
bested their previous highs in points.
Johnson had 12, including two first-half
threes, and didn't hesitate to shoot when
the defense sagged off him to double the
post.
