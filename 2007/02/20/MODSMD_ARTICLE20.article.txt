## Stanford rakes in state stem cell grants 
### PAUL ELIAS ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BURLINGAME, Calif. — Cal
ifornia's stem cell agency on Friday
doled out nearly $45 million in re
search grants to about 20 state uni
versities and nonprofit research
laboratories, far exceeding the fed
eral government's spending on the
controversial work.
In issuing the first significant re
search grants in its two-year histo
ry, the California Institute for Re
generative Medicine became the
nation's biggest financial backer of
human embryonic stem cell re
search.
"Today, we are making history,"
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
made a brief appearance at the
agency's oversight board meeting.
Stanford University researchers
were the biggest winners when they
landed 12 grants worth a combined
$8 million, including the first pub
licly financed human embryo
cloning project.
The Republican governor's sup
port of the research puts him at
odds with the Bush administration,
which has limited federal funding
to about $25 million annually.
California voters in 2004 passed

Proposition 71 to create the insti
tute and give it authority to borrow
and spend $3 billion for the re
search.
Two lawsuits challenging the
state agency's constitutionality
have prevented it from borrowing
the funds from Wall Street bond
markets. The first research grants
came from a $ 150 million loan from
the state and another $31 million in
loans from philanthropic organiza
tions.
Schwarzenegger authorized the
state loan last year, and said he
would approve more state loans if
the agency runs out of money be
fore the lawsuits are resolved.
The research aims to use stem
cells — created in the first days
after conception and giving rise to
all the organs and tissues — to re
place diseased tissue.
But many social conservatives,
including President Bush, oppose
the work because embryos are de
stroyed in the process. The micro
scopic embryos are usually donat
ed by fertility clinics.
llie agency last year awarded
$14 million in training grants for
novice researchers, but the grants
Friday were intended to fund more
ambitious projects that aim to push

the research out of the lab and into
patients.
Iliirty scientists who are new to
the field and 27 more with stem cell
research experience all received
grants.
"Our intent was to bring new
ideas and new talent to human em
bryonic stem cell research," said
agency president and chief scientist
Zach Hall.
Next month, another round of

25 grants worth about $80 million
will go to established stem cell sci
entists.
Four other states have also skirt
ed federal restrictions with stem
cell research funding schemes of
their own: Connecticut has a 10-
year. $100 million initiative; Illinois
spent $10 million last year; Mary
land has approved a $15 million
budget; and New Jersey has spent
about $25 million in two years.
