## Sin City no place for sports 
### 
There weren't any surprises on
Sunday night. The Western
Conference mollywhopped
the Eastern Conference in the NBA
All-Star Game, 153-132, in Las Vegas
â€” the first non-NBA city to ever
host basketball's mid-season spec
tacular. MVP Kobe Bryant led the
charge for the West with 31 points
and six assists, followed by Carmelo
Anthony with 20.
Overall, the entire All-Star week
end can be seen as a huge success,
bringing in significant revenue for
Sin City and fulfilling mayor Oscar
Goodman's goal of exposing a major
North American sporting league to
his town. But after the glitz and glam
our evaporated, Goodman's ulti
mate aim of finally bringing a team to
Las Vegas remains a dream, as it
doesn't look like any team is going to
call Vegas home any time soon.
Las Vegas has long been notori
ous for one thing: gambling. And that
just happens to be the one thing pre
venting a major team from landing in
the town. NBA commissioner David
Stern has built a nice reputation on
making the game as family-friendly
as possible, levying suspensions on
players involved in recent brawls and
requiring players to wear suits while
sitting a game out on the bench.
Stern has said quite frequently that
Vegas casinos must remove NBA
games from their betting lines before
the citv can be considered to host a
franchise.The NFL, MLB and NHL
similarly hold strong anti-gambling
policies that keep Vegas out of con
sideration.
Nevertheless, Goodman remains
adamant in his yearning for a major
squad in Sin City. Though he may
have changed his tune, Goodman
vowed two years ago that he would
throw an opening pitch in a Vegas
baseball game by 2008. Sure enough,
Vegas was a serious contender to
take the Montreal Expos before
Washington finally won the fran
chise. Vegas officials have spoken
with the Florida Marlins, though the
MLB hopes to keep the team in
Florida.
Now. there are just about a million
reasons a team shouldn't move to
Vegas.
First, the market size isn't all that
attractive. While Vegas is the nation's
fastest-growing city, it is still the
