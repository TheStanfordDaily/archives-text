## Sin City no place for sports 
### 
There weren't any surprises on
Sunday night. The Western
Conference mollywhopped
the Eastern Conference in the NBA
All-Star Game, 153-132, in Las Vegas
— the first non-NBA city to ever
host basketball's mid-season spec
tacular. MVP Kobe Bryant led the
charge for the West with 31 points
and six assists, followed by Carmelo
Anthony with 20.
Overall, the entire All-Star week
end can be seen as a huge success,
bringing in significant revenue for
Sin City and fulfilling mayor Oscar
Goodman's goal of exposing a major
North American sporting league to
his town. But after the glitz and glam
our evaporated, Goodman's ulti
mate aim of finally bringing a team to
Las Vegas remains a dream, as it
doesn't look like any team is going to
call Vegas home any time soon.
Las Vegas has long been notori
ous for one thing: gambling. And that
just happens to be the one thing pre
venting a major team from landing in
the town. NBA commissioner David
Stern has built a nice reputation on
making the game as family-friendly
as possible, levying suspensions on
players involved in recent brawls and
requiring players to wear suits while
sitting a game out on the bench.
Stern has said quite frequently that
Vegas casinos must remove NBA
games from their betting lines before
the citv can be considered to host a
franchise.The NFL, MLB and NHL
similarly hold strong anti-gambling
policies that keep Vegas out of con
sideration.
Nevertheless, Goodman remains
adamant in his yearning for a major
squad in Sin City. Though he may
have changed his tune, Goodman
vowed two years ago that he would
throw an opening pitch in a Vegas
baseball game by 2008. Sure enough,
Vegas was a serious contender to
take the Montreal Expos before
Washington finally won the fran
chise. Vegas officials have spoken
with the Florida Marlins, though the
MLB hopes to keep the team in
Florida.
Now. there are just about a million
reasons a team shouldn't move to
Vegas.
First, the market size isn't all that
attractive. While Vegas is the nation's
fastest-growing city, it is still the


Andrew
Lomeli
The SoCal Bias
country's 48th largest television
market. The problem stems from a
lack of other cities in the surround
ing area. Other small cities through
out the U.S. have the luxury of the
proximity of smaller towns in the re
gion — Vegas is pretty much sur
rounded by desert.
Furthermore, there's too much
competition, entertainment-wise.
Unlike other cities. Las Vegas does
not operate on a typical nine-to-five
schedule; many would-be fans could
very likely find themselves at work
when a game would be going on.
Also, Las Vegas is a very transient

city, meaning a strong fan base would
be difficult to develop. Most Vegas
residents will already have their fa
vorite squads and not identify with a
new team in town. I wouldn't be sur
prised if a team could produce a
good draw in the short term, but
sooner or later the novelty of visitors
seeing their home teams compete in
Vegas will wear off.
One could argue for the success
of current minor-league teams in the
town, though gambling has consis
tently been more of a draw than the
Dodgers' AAA-affiliate 51 's or
arena football's Gladiators. With its
current teams and other sources of
entertainment, it's not as if fans des
perately need something else to con
sume their time. Besides, Vegas resi
dents could easily align themselves
with the Los Angeles or Pheonix

market until an actual team finally
arrives.
Ideas are currently being thrown
around for the construction of a new
Las Vegas stadium near the Strip in
an effort to lure an NBA or NHL
team, and that's just fine. I'm certain
Las Vegas will host a pro team some
day, just not anytime soon.
But if Vegas really wants a team, I
suggest they start by working on the
betting lines. If the city isn 't willing to
sacrifice the revenues from the
sporting book, then they don't de
serve a team in the first place — es
pecially when cities throughout the
nation have sacrificed so much more
to call a team their own.
