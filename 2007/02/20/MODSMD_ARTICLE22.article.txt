# A 						force to be reckoned with
## Appel named Pac-10 Player of the Week for second straight double-double 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
The freshman center followed her 28-
point. 17-rebound performance against
Oregon State on Thursday with a near
triple-double—lß points, 11 rebounds
and seven assists — on Saturday. On
Monday. Jayne Appel's career weekend
was capped by Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Week honors.
"Jayne's a big force inside," head coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "We go inside to
her and she can score against anybody."
The good news didn't stop there for an
injury-plagued Cardinal. Junior guard
Candice Wiggins made a full-force return
with 17 points against the Ducks, starting
after a brief cameo appearance against
the Beavers. Wiggins also had eight re
bounds and four assists on Saturday,
showing the vitality which will be crucial
to Stanford as it nears the postseason.
"You can see this as soon as she comes
out of the game — the presence that she
has is phenomenal," VanDerveer said.
"When she's out there, she brings such a
calming effect to the team and just a con
fidence. 1 think the great ones are the ones
that make the other ones around them
better, and Candice certainly does that."
The beginning of the Oregon game was
uncomfortably different from the Ducks'
slow start on Jan. 18. when Oregon shot
just 19 percent in the first half at Maples
Pavilion.This time, the Ducks (who shot a
better, but still weak. 31.0 percent from
the field in the first period) were in the
lead until 12:35, when Appel had the third
of many layups for the night to pull the
