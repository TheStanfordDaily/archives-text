injury-plagued Cardinal. Junior guard
Candice Wiggins made a full-force return

after a brief cameo appearance against
the Beavers. Wiggins also had eight re

out of the game — the presence that she

that make the other ones around them
better, and Candice certainly does that."

better, but still weak. 31.0 percent from
the field in the first period) were in the
lead until 12:35, when Appel had the third
