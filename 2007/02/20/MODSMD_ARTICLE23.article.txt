## Card go long at Stanford Invite Stanford wins five to take tournament championship 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
In a collision of playing styles, the long ball
triumphed over the small ball on Sunday. ITie
No. 12 Cardinal softball squad won the cham
pionship game of the Stanford Invitational, 4-
1 over Missouri, on the strength of a pair of
home runs.

The weekend began with less drama, as
Stanford swept its three tournament oppo
nents to start the weekend, beating Pacific (8-
2), Santa Clara (0-10) and Mizzou (6-6) by an
average of six runs in their first three games,
notching two shutouts over that span. The
Cardinal had more trouble with Santa Clara
on Saturday, however, as they eked out a 4-3
win over the Broncos to advance to Sunday's
championship game, a rematch with Missouri.
Both squads made it through the first with
out allowing a run. but the Tigers got on the
scoreboard in the second inning, when right
fielder Julie Silver singled with two outs and
centerfielder Leanne Bowers drove her in
with a double to right centerfield. Sophomore

pitcher Missy Penna struck out the next batter
to end the inning, but for a time it looked as if
the one run might be enough for Mizzou to
earn a victory.
Tiger pitcher Jana Hainey didn't allow a hit
through the first four innings of play, and
Stanford was left wondering when their of
fense would strike back.
"Missouri played a very good game today,"
Stanford head coach John Rittman said.
"They really kept us off balance and they
made the most of their opportunities. It was
one of those games where for the first three
innings we hit a line drive right at somebody.
