## Card go long at Stanford Invite Stanford wins five to take tournament championship 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
In a collision of playing styles, the long ball
triumphed over the small ball on Sunday. ITie
No. 12 Cardinal softball squad won the cham
pionship game of the Stanford Invitational, 4-
1 over Missouri, on the strength of a pair of
home runs.

The weekend began with less drama, as
Stanford swept its three tournament oppo
nents to start the weekend, beating Pacific (8-
2), Santa Clara (0-10) and Mizzou (6-6) by an
average of six runs in their first three games,
notching two shutouts over that span. The
Cardinal had more trouble with Santa Clara
on Saturday, however, as they eked out a 4-3
win over the Broncos to advance to Sunday's
championship game, a rematch with Missouri.
Both squads made it through the first with
out allowing a run. but the Tigers got on the
scoreboard in the second inning, when right
fielder Julie Silver singled with two outs and
centerfielder Leanne Bowers drove her in
with a double to right centerfield. Sophomore

pitcher Missy Penna struck out the next batter
to end the inning, but for a time it looked as if
the one run might be enough for Mizzou to
earn a victory.
Tiger pitcher Jana Hainey didn't allow a hit
through the first four innings of play, and
Stanford was left wondering when their of
fense would strike back.
"Missouri played a very good game today,"
Stanford head coach John Rittman said.
"They really kept us off balance and they
made the most of their opportunities. It was
one of those games where for the first three
innings we hit a line drive right at somebody.
we hit a hard ground hall right to
them and they get the out and you're
like. Was this meant to be?'"
ITie Cardinal would finally tie the
score in the fifth, though, as freshman
catcher Rosey Neill belted a tower
ing home run to leftfield to tie the
game at 1-1 on Stanford's first hit of
the day.
"We needed the big hit. and it's

nice to have a lineup where one
through nine can hit it out of the park
essentially," Rittman said. "Our kids
kept battling and the long ball defi
nitely helped us out today."
The long ball would help Stanford
again in the sixth inning. Freshman
centerfielder Alissa Haber and sen
ior leftfielder Jackie Rinehart both
singled to get on base with one out in

the inning and sophomore shortstop
slugger Maddy Coon did the rest,
sending a three-run blast to center
field.
Coon has gotten off to a tremen
dous start for the Cardinal, leading
the team in RBI (13). slugging per
centage (.806) and on-base percent
age (.550); she is also tied for the
team lead in home runs (two) and
runs scored (11). Rittman said that,
while Coon's progress was stalled
early by an illness,she has rebounded
nicely to lead the team offensively.
"Maddy came back this year in
tremendous shape," Rittman said.
"She's battled through some things
and she's playing herself into shape
right now and we're really happy
with her progress and what she's
doing this year."
Penna, too, was integral to the
Cardinal's win. as she allowed Mis
souri no chance to get back in the
game after Neill's game-tying home
run in the bottom of the fifth. The
Tigers went hitless over their final
two frames. Penna struck out six on
the day, settling in after early control
problems put two Missouri runners
on base in the first inning on a walk
and hit batsman.
"I thought Missy did well,"
Rittman said. "She didn't have com
mand of everything today, but she
was a pitcher today. She kept battling
and made pitches when she needed
to make them, and that's her matur
ing. She's really becoming a com
plete pitcher."
Stanford will not play again at
home before the Stanford Classic,
which begins March 9. Next up for
the Cardinal is the Florida Interna
tional University Adidas Invitational
in Miami, Fla. The tournament be
gins Thursday and runs through Sun
day.
