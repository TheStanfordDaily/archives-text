### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Andy Murray surely felt a bit of deja vu
during the final rounds of 2(H)7's SAP Open
when he defended his first Association of
Tennis Professionals (ATP) title. As in 2006,
the 19-year-old from Scotland defeated
American Andy Roddick in straight sets in
the semifinals before claiming the champi
onship match in a third set tiebreaker.
In 2()0(i. Murray beat Roddick, 7-5,7-5, to
advance to the finals, where he defeated Lley

ATP title.
Murray returned to San Jose last week to
defend his championship and win a second

tiebreaker.
Upon entering the finals, Karlovic had
only lost serve once in 57 service games, and
he ultimately cranked out 26 aces in the
championship match.
"He has the best serve in tennis," Murray
said. "There's no question. Guys can serve
harder or more accurately, but you just don't
see a serve coming from that angle. I le can hit
spots in the court that guys can't even see. It's
physically impossible for other guys to hit
those spots."
As the match wore on. Murray adjusted to
Karlovic's serve; the Scotsman even earned a
service break in the second set. despite hav
