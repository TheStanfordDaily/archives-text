### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Andy Murray surely felt a bit of deja vu
during the final rounds of 2(H)7's SAP Open
when he defended his first Association of
Tennis Professionals (ATP) title. As in 2006,
the 19-year-old from Scotland defeated
American Andy Roddick in straight sets in
the semifinals before claiming the champi
onship match in a third set tiebreaker.
In 2()0(i. Murray beat Roddick, 7-5,7-5, to
advance to the finals, where he defeated Lley
ton I lewitt. 2-6.6-1.7-6 (3), for his first-ever
ATP title.
Murray returned to San Jose last week to
defend his championship and win a second
ATP title. Following a decisive win in the first
round, Murray notched two more close victo
ries to secure ;i spot in the semifinals against
Roddick. Murray then narrowly defeated
Roddick, 7-6 (8). 6-4, to earn a berth in the fi
nals, where he faced Croatia's Ivo Karlovic.
Although Murray stands at 6-foot-3. the
Scotsman pales in comparison to Karlovic's
6-foot 10 frame. Karlovic's ranking of 103 rd
in the world does not do justice to his serving
prowess. Because of his height. Karlovic is
able to create speed and angles that other
players can only dream of. Especially with the
significantly quicker surface at this year's
SAP Open, the Croat's serve proved to be an
advantage in the first set. as he nabbed it in a
tiebreaker.
Upon entering the finals, Karlovic had
only lost serve once in 57 service games, and
he ultimately cranked out 26 aces in the
championship match.
"He has the best serve in tennis," Murray
said. "There's no question. Guys can serve
harder or more accurately, but you just don't
see a serve coming from that angle. I le can hit
spots in the court that guys can't even see. It's
physically impossible for other guys to hit
those spots."
As the match wore on. Murray adjusted to
Karlovic's serve; the Scotsman even earned a
service break in the second set. despite hav
ing only won one point on Karlovic's first
serve in the previous set. Alter claim
ing the second, ft-4. Murray barely
edged out the Croat in a tiebreaker
in the third.
()nly three other players have de
fended their first ATP titles; Murray
joins Mario Ancic, Richard (iasquct
and Paradorn Srichaphan.
Because of his serving capabili
ties. Karlovic was able to hold serve
easily and stretched several sets to
tiebreakers prior to Sunday's match.
Following a straight-set win in the
first round against Spain's Guiller
mo Garcia-Lopez, the 27-year-old
( 'roat defeated seeded players in the
next three rounds.
In the second round, Karlovic
ousted second-seeded American
James Blake. Alter winning the first
set. Blake led 5-3, 30-love but was
not able to close out the match, de
spite multiple match points. Blake

lost the second in a lengthy tiebreak
er. 7-ft (11 ),and then could not recov
er in the third. Ihe third set remained
on serve until the final game: Blake
was ultimately broken and lost the
match when he opened the final
game ol the set with two doubles
faults.
Karlovic then defeated fifth
seeded Mardy lish in the quarters. 7-
ft (2). ft-4. be lore outlasting the tour
nament s sixth seed, Benjamin Beck
er. 7-ft (5). 7-5.
Stanlord alum Sam Warburg '05
made a notable run in this year's

lirst set.6-2. before dropping the sec
ond set by just one break. 6-4. ()nce
l lsh settled into the match, he ulti
mately claimed the third. 6-2. to earn

Jamie Murray, claimed the doubles
title with his partner, American
I 'ric Butorac.'llie elder Murray and
Butorac defeated Chris Haggard
and Kainer Sehuettler 7-5. 7-6 (S).
