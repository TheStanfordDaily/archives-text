## Stanford be-Deviled on the mat 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling closed out its
season on Friday with a 23-20 home
loss to Arizona State. Only seven
matches were wrestled in the dual,
with the Sun Devils forfeiting at 125
and 149 pounds and the Cardinal at
197 pounds. Of the seven matches,
Stanford was able to win just two and
Arizona State improved its all-time
record against the Cardinal to 7-0.
The dual started at 174 pounds
where the Cardinal (8-8,5-4 Pacific
-10 Conference) got its first of those
two victories. Sophomore Luke Feist
came out strong, jumping out to a 12-
2 lead in the first period after allow
ing his opponent. Rick Renzi, to
score a takedown to start the match.
Feist would go on to earn the win by
technical fall. 18-2, after coming close
to a pin several times.
Stanford head coach Kerry
McCoy was still trying to determine
what spurred the sophomore's
strong start following the dual.
"First of all, [assistant] coach
Klemm and I, we're trying to figure
out if Luke wrestles better when he's
confident or when he's scared,"
McCoy said. "He was definitely a lit
tle nervous before his match today
So, we're still trying to see what the
best preparation is for him. But the
best thing was that he went out there
today and just fought — [Renzi]
beat him the last time they wrestled,
and he ended up getting a tech fall."
Arizona State (8-11, 5-2) would
answer, however, as talented true-

freshman Zack Giesen lost at 184
pounds for the first time in 14 match
es, falling to Greg Gifford, 10-2.
"It was frustrating — that was an
important match for me," Giesen
said. "That guy was top-seeded in the
Pac-10 and I didn't wrestle like 1
wanted to. But I saw what he did, and
I've just got to learn from that."
After the forfeit at 197 pounds,
the match moved on to the heavy
weights, where junior Phil Doerner
pulled out a tough 5-2 win over Thor
Moen of the Sun Devils. McCoy was
glad to see the Cardinal heavyweight
channel his emotion into a big victo
ry for the team.
"Phil's been a work in progress
throughout the whole year," McCoy
said."He drills and he works hard, but
sometimes we just can't get him to pull
that trigger. And then finally in this
match, he comes in. he claps his hands
and gets all fired up, then throws a
takedown. And that's big because now

he's building that confidence."
That takedown would be Stan
ford's last win over the Sun Devils on
the night, however. Other than the
two forfeits at 125 and 149 pounds.
Arizona State ran the table against
the remaining Cardinal wrestlers.
One particularly difficult defeat came
at 157 pounds, as No. 15 junior Josh
Zupancic lost 3-1 to No. 4 Brian Stith.
Nevertheless, Doerner was con
vinced that Stanford would be able
to overcome the loss and be ready for
the all-important Pac-10 Tourna
ment this weekend.
"1 don't want to say we don't
match up well with [Arizona State],
but our best guys wrestled their best
guys,and sometimes it just doesn't go
how you want," he said. "But we'll be
better next weekend, and that's all
that counts."
