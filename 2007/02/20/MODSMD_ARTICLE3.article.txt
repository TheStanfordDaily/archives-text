The top-ranked women's swimming and diving team had a
24-point lead going into the last session of the four-day Pacific

team, which edged out the favored Card 1.481.5 to 1,410 in the
Long Beach. Calif, meet.
ITie disqualification of the 400-yard medley relay "A" squad
literally by 1/100 of a second — cost Stanford crucial points

showings by swimmers down the depth charts, with several
Pac-10 and Stanford records broken after more than two

by-side in our record books with
American swimming icons, is a huge
accomplishment," Maurer said. "Not

they are also looking forward to
doing even more at the NCAA
Championships. They know what
they've done to this point is huge, but

they also know there are a lot of peo
ple in the country swimming similar
ly fast times, and they are just trying
to get better for the NCAAs."
