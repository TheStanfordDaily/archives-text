## Stanford splashes to second 
### SARA NORMINGTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The top-ranked women's swimming and diving team had a
24-point lead going into the last session of the four-day Pacific
-10 Conference Championships on Saturday.
But it wasn't enough to stave off a surging No. 4 Arizona
team, which edged out the favored Card 1.481.5 to 1,410 in the
Long Beach. Calif, meet.
ITie disqualification of the 400-yard medley relay "A" squad
literally by 1/100 of a second — cost Stanford crucial points
and could have made the difference.
A disapointing defeat capped off a weekend of strong
showings by swimmers down the depth charts, with several
Pac-10 and Stanford records broken after more than two
weeks of tapering.
