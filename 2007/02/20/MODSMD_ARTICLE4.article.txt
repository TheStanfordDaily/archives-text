## Over-the-counter drugs present in student 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Mengyao "May" /hou. the 23-year-old elec
trical engineering graduate student who was
found dead in the trunk of her car in the parking
lot of Santa Rosa Junior College on Jan. 25. had
toxic levels of an over-the-counter drug in her
body at the time of her death, investigators said
late last week.
The drug, diphenhydramine, is most common
ly found in sleep aids and in Benadryl,an anti-his
tamine medication used to alleviate allergic reac
tions. According to the Sonoma County coroner,
whose office conducted Zhou's autopsy, "poten
tially toxic" levels of diphenhydramine can he

anywhere from 1 -5 mg/L.
Tests showed that Zhou had 6.15 mg/L in her
body when she died.
"No other common acidic, neutral or basic
drugs (were] detected," a press release from the
Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said. "No blood
or urine ethyl alcohol [was] detected."
Sergeant Mitch Mana of the Sonoma County
Coroner's Office said that he could not elaborate
further on the information provided in the press
release.
According to Stanford Hospital & Clinics
Drug Information Service,moderate poisoning of
diphenhydramine results in agitation, confusion
and hallucinations. Severe poisoning
ingesting a gram or more of the
drug â€” can cause delirium, psy
chosis. seizure, coma and abnormal
heart rhythms.
A few deaths have also been
linked to diphenhydramine over
doses. a spokesman for the drug in
formation service said.
Though authorities have called
Zhou's death an "apparent suicide."
an official cause of death has yet to
be determined.The case is still under
investigation. Messages left with the
Santa Rosa Police Department were
not returned over the long weekend.

Meanwhile. Zhou's family and
some of her close friends are disput
ing the notion that the second year
doctoral candidate in electrical engi
neering took her own life. Zhou's fa
ther, Yitong Zhou, is reportedly con
templating hiring a lawyer and ioren
sics expert to look into Ins daughter's
death, even if that means exhuming
her buried body.
"Where did it come from?" he
asked of the high levels of diphenhy
dramine in his daughter's body dur
ing an interview with the San Jose
Mercury News. "From herself, or
someone who forced her to swal
low?"
Zhou was buried in San Diego on
Feb. 10.
