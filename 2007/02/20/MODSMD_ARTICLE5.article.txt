## Fleet Street singers reunite After 25 years, old and new members sang together Sunday 
### DAISY CHEN 
Current and former members of Fleet Street
overran Dinkelspiel Auditorium Sunday night for
the a cappella group's 25-year reunion concert.
Over 700 audience members crowded into the
sold-out event and spectators were still trickling
in 15 minutes after the show began.
"Preparing for the show was a lot of fun," said
an onstage alum."lt's been a great opportunity to

catch up with old friends and reminisce about the
good old times."
The group performed a number of skits and
traditional favorites, and alums played lead roles
in a number of classic crowd pleasers including
"Masochism Tango," "Prayer to the Cod of Par
tial Credit" and "Everyone Pees in the Shower."
The cast of singers featured Fleet Street alums
who flew in from all corners of the country — and
the globe — to take part in the reunion event.
Fleet Street has been a part of the Stanford en
tertainment scene since 1981 — its distinctive red
bowties a staple since the beginning. According to


MAE RYAN/ Stanford Daily
Current and former members of Fleet Street come together Sunday evening in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
for a commemorative show to honor 25 years of entertaining the Stanford community.
alumni, however, there have been
some slight changes over the years.
"Our vests didn't have backs be
fore," Ben I vans "92 said. "That was
the style back then for waiters. Now
there are backs. So now we look
classier.
"1 feel like we had drier humor
back in the day."he added. "The
wackiness has gotten wackier over
the years; there's more clowny
humor, but we still know how to em
brace the cool side of everything."

"They've got black and white
shoes now." said Nate Whitman 'MS.
"And the vests are different: the
bowties are a little brighter."
Fleet Street has been arranging
and writing its own song repertoire
since IMSS. Previously, the group had
borrowed tunes from east coast a
cappella groups, including a Yale
group called Duke's Men.
"There are more originals now,"
Youngmoo Kim'% said."The reper
toire does change from year to year,
but the best part is having this con
necting thread with other Fleet
Street members. We all share the
same bond — that means something
special to us."
Before the show concluded with

"Hail. Stanford, Hail." Meet Street
alum Hill Moore ' I >l dedicated the
hymn to Steve Miller "85. a founding
member of the group who died in 2(X)5.
"Steve was a great musician."
Moore said. "He came to many
shows and made it a point to intro
duce himself personally to all the
new Fleet Street members who
joined every year."
"I le contributed a lot to the foun
dation of this group." Moore added.
"Being here means a lot to me. and
I've attended every spring show and
have been to the reunion shows since
mv years at Stanford."
