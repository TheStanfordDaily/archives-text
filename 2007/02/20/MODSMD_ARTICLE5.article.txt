# STUDENT GROUPS
## Fleet Street singers reunite After 25 years, old and new members sang together Sunday 
### DAISY CHEN 
Current and former members of Fleet Street
overran Dinkelspiel Auditorium Sunday night for
the a cappella group's 25-year reunion concert.
Over 700 audience members crowded into the
sold-out event and spectators were still trickling
in 15 minutes after the show began.
"Preparing for the show was a lot of fun," said
an onstage alum."lt's been a great opportunity to

catch up with old friends and reminisce about the
good old times."
The group performed a number of skits and
traditional favorites, and alums played lead roles
in a number of classic crowd pleasers including
"Masochism Tango," "Prayer to the Cod of Par
tial Credit" and "Everyone Pees in the Shower."
The cast of singers featured Fleet Street alums
who flew in from all corners of the country — and
the globe — to take part in the reunion event.
Fleet Street has been a part of the Stanford en
tertainment scene since 1981 — its distinctive red
bowties a staple since the beginning. According to


MAE RYAN/ Stanford Daily
Current and former members of Fleet Street come together Sunday evening in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
for a commemorative show to honor 25 years of entertaining the Stanford community.
