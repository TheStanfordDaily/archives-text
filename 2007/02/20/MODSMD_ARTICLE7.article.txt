# SLAC
## Breakthrough could bring change 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
lii a space of less than a meter, a team of physicists at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) man
aged to accomplish something that normally requires the
accelerator's entire three-kilometer length: They in
creased the energy of an electron by 40 billion volts.
Iliis technological development might signal the be
ginning of the end for massive multi-billion-dollar "con
ventional" accelerator technology. Or it might not.
Using a new technology called plasma wakefield ac
celeration, scientists from SI.AC", USC and UCLA man
aged to double the energy of an electron that emerged
from the linear accelerator to a level
that was close to the facility's maxi
mum. Their findings were published
in "Nature" on Feb. 15.
"We're trying to invent technolo
gy to build another [type of] particle
accelerator," said SLAC physicist
Mark Hogan, one of the "Nature"
paper's co-authors.
Innovation in particle physics is
necessary because the experimental
needs of high-energy physics studies
are beginning to outstrip the energy
capabilities of "conventional" accel
erator facilities like SLAC.
"(Particle physics] has sort of out
grown Stanford now," said Robert
Siemann, a professor at SLAC and
one of the project's lead scientists.
Particle accelerator facilities like
SLAC increase the energy-level of
electrons by hurtling beams of elec
trons at high speeds down solid-cop
per tracks that are powered by volt
age differentials. Once the particles
reach maximum speeds, physicists
can crash them into a target and use

complex detectors to search tor
smaller, more elementary particles
in the wreckage.
Due to advances in theoretical
physics, modern physics experiments
often require energy levels that out
strip the maximum "energy gradi
ents" that conventional accelerators
— even huge international projects
like the recently-proposed $6.7 bil
lion International Linear Collider —
can provide.This is the "energy fron
tier" dilemma of modern cutting
edge physics.
The new plasma wakeficid tech
nology is a development that scien
tists say could help particle physics
break through this frontier.
"This is a qualitatively different
type of physics," Siemann said. "We
think we can extend these ideas.
We're trying to look at some of the
issues."
The new technology uses a tran
sient structure constructed in a plas
ma field of charged lithium ions to
accelerate electrons after they
emerge from SLAC. Similar to the
waves generated when a speedboat
crosses the surface of a lake, the
"wake" generated by the electrons'
passage through the plasma propels
the electrons forward at increasingly

high speeds. And unlike accelera
tion in solid materials like copper,
which can buckle and break when
stressed, the plasma provides a mal
leable medium for the speeding
electrons.
The punch line of the recent
work. Siemann said, is that the tran
sition from solid copper to fluid plas
ma can drastically downsize the ma
chinery required to accelerate elec
trons.
"If you drive over Highway 280,
you can look to the west and look to
the east and see what an enormous
facility SLAC is," he said."lnstead of
using something the size of SLAC [to
accelerate particles], we were able to
do this in less than a meter."
But the technology remains new
and untested.
"This is not a mature technology,"
Siemann added. "In other words, we
could not turn around tomorrow and
build an accelerator out of it. One of
the questions about these kinds of
accelerators is,'can one sustain these
plasmas over large enough distances
to sustain interesting energy
changes?' Can you accelerate
enough particles? There are all kinds
of questions and that is where our
program is turning now."

'I he researchers also noted that
the SLAC team has yet to demon
strate that the plasma technology can
accelerate positrons, which is a must
it it is to supplant current technology.
"It's one of those things where
you have to see both sides of the
coin," I logan said."What we've done
is remarkable, it's exciting and it
could potentially have ;i large payoff,
but it's not there yet."
"There have always been new
phenomena that we couldn't have
predicted," he added."lt's very satis
fying. It's like the quote from Forrest
Gump: 'Life is like a box of choco
lates.' Well, particle physics is like a
box of chocolates. The reality is that
you're in a concrete tunnel and
sometimes you're there at three in
the morning trying to align equip
ment.Things break at all hours of the
night. It's cool."
Despite the relative uncertainty
surrounding the future of plasma
wakefield acceleration technology,
I logan remained optimistic.
"1 can't say that what we've done
is the future of high energy physics,"
he said. "But that's the hope."
