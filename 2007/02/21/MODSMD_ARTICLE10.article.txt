## ROMESH RATNESAR TIME editor discusses journalism, Iraq and Condi 
### SAM BHAGWAT PAGE TWO EDITOR 
Romesh Ratnesar '96 was a re
porter, news editor and columnist at
Hie Daily during liis years on the
/■arm. A fter graduation, lie joined The
New Republic, anil then was lured at
TIME, where he worked as a foreign
correspondent in London and Iraq
before returning to New York to be
come TIME's World Editor.
The Stanford Daily: I was interest
ed in how you got toTIME.
Komesii Ratnesar: I left here the
summer alter I graduated. I did a co
term. and finished it that summer.
And then moved to Washington in
September of "96. and I started at The
New Republic. It has this essentially
nine-month position, a reporter-re
searcher position that at that time
paid $200 a week and involves lots of
gut work — that, you know, is basi
cally. stock-and-trade for any maga
zine. that involves lots of answering
phones, we had to read and respond
to hundreds of manuscripts that
come from people unsolicited. We
had to do a lot of basic research for
the editors... I was there until the end
of that year. June of '97, then was
hired by TIME and started there in
New York.
TSI): I low did you get from a new
hire at TIME to being the World Ed
itor?
RR: When I started at TIME, the
magazine was also in a sort of transi
tion period, and Walter Isaacson
wanted to hire some younger writers,
which TIME did not really do.TIME
had this really unique structure
where you had lots of old, nearly de
ceased writers sitting in an office in
New York. For years and years and
years, it was the model that they
would sit there and correspondents
would send them files about what was
going on in Beijing or Moscow or Jo
hannesburg, and we would have a
team of writers in New York who
would take the tiles and then re
process them into TIME stories. And
their names would be at the top, and
the people who did all the work
would be at the bottom. Walter want
ed to shake that up. he wanted writers
who could do both, so he hired me. he
hired Joel [Stein "93], he hired anoth
er couple of younger people, and he
threw us into it.
My first week there. I was handed
what seemed like a gargantuan task
it was a two-page story, and I had
to turn it around in two to three days.
I just kind of took off from there — I
think TIME is the kind of place, as is
the case in most news organizations
if you show you're capable of writ
ing. writing quickly, writing cleanly,
writing clearly, you'll succeed. I
worked in New York for two, three
years, then I went to London for a
year. I came back after Sept. 11. and
wrote exclusively on terrorism and
the Middle East until the invasion of
Iraq.and then I went to Iraq.
TSI): What was the newsroom

like on Sept. 11?
RR: Well. 1 was in London...basi
cally, I think people got into the office
it they could and Jim Kelly, the editor,
said, this is the biggest of our lifetime,
so get to work and most of the staff
headed out to report what was going
on downtown. But that was in New
York, and I was stuck in London,
which was frustrating. But it def-

initely convinced me that it was
time to get back to [New
York]...there wasn't a lot to

do in London at that stage.
TSI): When were you in
Iraq as a correspondent?

RR: 1 haven't been
back there in a couple years. 1 was
there for six months in 2003 and a
couple weeks in 2004. and then I be
came the foreign editor after that.
But Iraq at that stage was a lot of fun
as a journalist. It was an amazing
story — there was so much happen
ing, so much uncertainty about where
things were going to go. A lot of peo
ple look back and say that all the
seeds of failure were planted in those
early days. And it's true, if you go
back and think about it. 1 think about
some of the conversations I h;id with
people that had much more experi-

ence than I did—there was great
skepticism among professional diplo
mats who were there. 'ITiey were
skeptical about the American bu
reaucracy, the American govern
ment's ability to pull this off. They
weren't necessarily skeptical about
whether it was a good thing to get rid
of Saddam and they weren't skeptical
about whether the Iraqi people
weren't better off on balance. But
they were skeptical that the Ameri
cans could make it work. And that
was something. I guess, that I didn't
really grasp fully at that time.
Hut the story was great — there
were a lot of young people. You can't
go to Iraq if you've got a family, so
there were lots of young writers,
young photographers, activists,
NCiOs. lTiere was instant community
it was a little bit like being in col
lege.
TSI): [laughter] Do you miss
being in the field?
RR: Yeah, yeah I do, and I will
probably go back to being in the field
at some stage...! would hate to wake
up in twenty years and still be
chained to a desk. But I really like
what I do now — to shape coverage.
When you're an editor you're in
volved in a lot of different decisions...
|and] that's fine. The other problem

with being out in the field, to some ex
tent. is that you're filing stories and
they're not running... With the Inter
net. things are a bit different — sto
ries that don't run on the print maga
zine you write for online.
TSI): Did you feel like you were
doingsignificantly different work than
colleagues at the New York l imes and
Washington Post because you weren't
on pressure to file even,' day?
KK: Yeah. I spent the last month
working on one story — 1 didn't do
anything else, just reporting one
story. That's not a luxury available to
most other journalists there. But the

IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING [IN IRAQ] IS BASICALLY PREVENTING
THINGS FROM GETTING WORSE, BUT WE HAVE NO ABILITY AT THIS STAGE TO
MAKE THINGS BETTER. AND THAT'S DISHEARTENING."
- ROMESH RATMESAR W

New York Times correspondents
have to churn out not only stories
every day, but some of them have to
write three or four versions of the
same story a day. But these people,
who have been there reporting from
the beginning, have done incredible
work...they're real heroes.
TSI): Would you want their job?
RR: Nah... I think one thing you
realize in life is you have to be honest
with yourself with what you think you
want to do and what you're actually
good at. 1 know I'm never going to be
a good war correspondent; I'm not
constitutionally up for it. I have that
desire, but it's not what I see in my
mind my life being about.
TSI): And being on the front line,
being in the war zone, beinu under

some point in life. The thing about
journalism is that it isn't a linear path,
the way other professions are — and
if you think it is. you're in the wrong
job. Journalism is something you do
your whole life.'l lie re's a reason jour
nalists become journalists and not ac
ademics. and that's because journal
ists like me like to cover a wide vari
ety of things. I imagine at some stage
Ill leave journalism, and try my hand
at another line of work. But I think
I ll always come back to writing.
TSI): What was driving you to go
into writing in the first place? Did
you want to learn, did you find some
thing out. persuade people of some
thing...
RR: Writing just kind of came to
me. I iiuess. I don't think 1 went into

fire — you weren't really into that?
KR: Yeah, you don't have to do
that sort of thing, you know. You'd
only do it if you really felt you'd enjoy
it, and 1 mean. 1 can see the appeal, i
hut there are other things I want to do
with my life. i
TS1): Like what? You were in Iraq i
for a bit. now you're editing in New j
York, hut you don't want to be doing
that forever. What are you aiming for ;
— what would you like to do. ideally? I
KK: I will hopefully write for
books. I'm writing one now, at least i
starting one. I think most people in
journalism long to run something, at <

this with a larger mission, but I under
stand and I appreciate and I'm grate
ful for the impact you can have. Even
now when people read your stories, 1
don't know if they make a difference
in terms of grand social change, but
they make a difference in that they
make people's lives a little more en
joyable. and that's a good feeling.
Hven if they hate the stuff I write. I'm
glad I get people thinking, get them
talking, and maybe get them angry.
TSI): So what's the most interest
ing story you've reported on?
RRtThe story 1 feel the most own
ership in. pride in was the Person of
the Year story for 2003.The person of
the year was The American Soldier,
and the story was a profile of a pla
toon of soldiers who we lived with,
myself and Michael Weisskopf. We
lived with these guys and went on pa
trol with them every day.and spent
the better part of ;i month with them,
and we wrote a story.
It was punctuated by the very last
night we were reporting — Michael
was riding around in the back in the
truck, I was writing the story back in
our house, a grenade was thrown into
the truck, Michael picked the
grenade up to throw it out. it blew up
in his hand, he lost his right hand. Our
photographer, Jim Nachtwey, was in
jured in that incident as well. They
both would have died if Michael had
not picked up the grenade.The next
48 hours were basically trying to get
this guy to emergency treatment. Hie
military was a bit hesitant about it.
And the story came out — after
Michael was airlifted I finished the
story. Aside from that incident, I'm
proud of that story as a narrative
piece of reporting; partly because I
spent a lot of time on it and felt close
to the subjects.

TSI): You were saying that you
didn't have the constitution to be a
war reporter? Was it the uncertainty?
Was it the chaos? What gets to you?
RK: It was the uncertainty, it was
the stress... it was the boredom. You
have to suppress the boredom if
you're spending time with American
troops. Today, the vast amount of re
porting is done by Iraqis who go out
and bring the content back to Amer
ican journalists. And if you're with
them.you'll hangout,spend an hour
or two going out on patrol. You go
out and see what's happening maybe
four hours a day, and the rest of the
time you're just sitting around.
The military guys, the officers, are
doing stuff during that time — there
is a lot of shit that the military has to
deal with that we don't even... It's a
huge bureaucratic machine there.
What was amazing about being in
Iraq is how quickly that machine is
recreated at a very local level
throughout. As soon as they get
there, they get there, instantly set up
these vast bases, .lust maintaining the
bases is, I don't know, half the time
and energy the troops spend there is
supporting the infrastructure, force
protection. But for journalists, that's
not very interesting. The bottom line
is that I'm not driven to be at the
front line and dodge bullets. And I 've
never had to do it.That night was the
one exception, but it was an excep
tion.
TSI): What are your thoughts
about what's going to happen there?
Do you think being in your current
posit ion gives you any additional wis
dom?
UK: No. 1 don't think it does. 1
have the luxury of being paid to read
a lot of stuff that everyone else reads.
I get the reports from people in the

field, and 1 get to see it. but 1 don't
think I have any special insight. I feel
like a lot of people feel like Iraq is de
teriorating. and our ability to reverse
that is dwindling. It seems to me like
what we're doing is basically prevent
ing things from getting worse, but we
have no ability at this stage to make
things better. And that's dishearten
ing. To most Americans, that's not
something we're used to confronting.
I think there will be a lot of lessons
learned from this — I guess we're
stuck there, because we're the only
honest broker to some extent now.
And of course, the longer we stay, the
less leverage we have over Iran, and
to send troops to Afghanistan if we
want to.
I hope we'll see basically disen
gagement. not a withdrawal, a reduc
tion of our presence there to some
sort of minimally acceptable level,
and then you know, you just have to
wait. I think you have to wait it out. If
they're going to fight it out between
themselves, then there's nothing we
can do about it.
TSI): What was your worldview
coming into this,and how has report
ing changed it. if it has changed it?
RK: I think where I was a few
years ago I had this idea that there
are certain ideas and certain values
that are applicable across cultures
and across... As Condi Rice often
says, it is the height of condescension
to say that the Arab world should not
have democracy the way the rest of
the world does. Well. I'm less sure of
that today. We're not good at under
standing and appreciation the cultur
al limitations or the cultural, I don't
know, peculiarities that stand in the
way of our importing our version and
the way we want things done and the
way we think things should be done
into other areas of the world. I think
we have to figure out a way in which
we stand for our ideals, and we are
true to those values but we're not
naive to think we can easily impose
them. And that's the ultimate tragedy

dI Iraq, the naivete, and the belief...
1 had dinner with Karl Vick the
other day.and he said the fundamen
tal problem is not that Arabs are
averse to Westerners, it's that they're
averse to Western soldiers — they
don't want American tanks in their
streets.
I'SI): Just because this is The
Stanford Daily, what was your expe
rience with Condoleezza Rice here?
Did you have any?
KR: Yeah, 1 knew her. I still see
her from time to time. I covered her
for Hie Daily, and 1 also took her
class, an undergraduate seminar on
the end of the Cold War. So 1 knew
her pretty well, and I've seen her a
half-dozen times or so since she
joined the administration.
My experience has been a positive
one — she's a great teacher, she w as
great for Stanford. She was a contro
versial figure in terms of the policies
which she pursued when she was a
provost — [she] ruffled a lot of feath
ers... If she had stayed, and wanted
the job [as President of Stanford] she
certainly would have been on the
short list. She was a good person to
know as a reporter— I had a good
relationship with her, so I got stories
out of her. She was the number two
official at Stanford, so as a reporter,
she was a big deal.
I knew she was going to end up in
Washington...you know, looking
back, 1 remember writing a long pro
file of her. and somebody said — I
think 1 asked a question whether
she'll be considered a future presi
dent of Stanford, and someone said.
"I think she'll be someday consid
ered as a future president of the Unit
ed States." And I said. "Well, that's a
stretch" — it struck me as somewhat
ambitious hut look where we are
now. I don't think it's going to hap
pen.but I think it's part of the conver
sation.
