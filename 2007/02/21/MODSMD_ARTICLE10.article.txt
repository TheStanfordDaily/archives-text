## ROMESH RATNESAR TIME editor discusses journalism, Iraq and Condi 
### SAM BHAGWAT PAGE TWO EDITOR 
Romesh Ratnesar '96 was a re
porter, news editor and columnist at
Hie Daily during liis years on the
/■arm. A fter graduation, lie joined The
New Republic, anil then was lured at
TIME, where he worked as a foreign
correspondent in London and Iraq
before returning to New York to be
come TIME's World Editor.
The Stanford Daily: I was interest
ed in how you got toTIME.
Komesii Ratnesar: I left here the
summer alter I graduated. I did a co
term. and finished it that summer.
And then moved to Washington in
September of "96. and I started at The
New Republic. It has this essentially
nine-month position, a reporter-re
searcher position that at that time
paid $200 a week and involves lots of
gut work — that, you know, is basi
cally. stock-and-trade for any maga
zine. that involves lots of answering
phones, we had to read and respond
to hundreds of manuscripts that
come from people unsolicited. We
had to do a lot of basic research for
the editors... I was there until the end
of that year. June of '97, then was
hired by TIME and started there in
New York.
TSI): I low did you get from a new
hire at TIME to being the World Ed
itor?
RR: When I started at TIME, the
magazine was also in a sort of transi
tion period, and Walter Isaacson
wanted to hire some younger writers,
which TIME did not really do.TIME
had this really unique structure
where you had lots of old, nearly de
ceased writers sitting in an office in
New York. For years and years and
years, it was the model that they
would sit there and correspondents
would send them files about what was
going on in Beijing or Moscow or Jo
hannesburg, and we would have a
team of writers in New York who
would take the tiles and then re
process them into TIME stories. And
their names would be at the top, and
the people who did all the work
would be at the bottom. Walter want
ed to shake that up. he wanted writers
who could do both, so he hired me. he
hired Joel [Stein "93], he hired anoth
er couple of younger people, and he
threw us into it.
My first week there. I was handed
what seemed like a gargantuan task
it was a two-page story, and I had
to turn it around in two to three days.
I just kind of took off from there — I
think TIME is the kind of place, as is
the case in most news organizations
if you show you're capable of writ
ing. writing quickly, writing cleanly,
writing clearly, you'll succeed. I
worked in New York for two, three
years, then I went to London for a
year. I came back after Sept. 11. and
wrote exclusively on terrorism and
the Middle East until the invasion of
Iraq.and then I went to Iraq.
TSI): What was the newsroom

like on Sept. 11?
RR: Well. 1 was in London...basi
cally, I think people got into the office
it they could and Jim Kelly, the editor,
said, this is the biggest of our lifetime,
so get to work and most of the staff
headed out to report what was going
on downtown. But that was in New
York, and I was stuck in London,
which was frustrating. But it def-

initely convinced me that it was
time to get back to [New
York]...there wasn't a lot to

do in London at that stage.
TSI): When were you in
Iraq as a correspondent?

RR: 1 haven't been
back there in a couple years. 1 was
there for six months in 2003 and a
couple weeks in 2004. and then I be
came the foreign editor after that.
But Iraq at that stage was a lot of fun
as a journalist. It was an amazing
story — there was so much happen
ing, so much uncertainty about where
things were going to go. A lot of peo
ple look back and say that all the
seeds of failure were planted in those
early days. And it's true, if you go
back and think about it. 1 think about
some of the conversations I h;id with
people that had much more experi-

ence than I did—there was great
skepticism among professional diplo
mats who were there. 'ITiey were
skeptical about the American bu
reaucracy, the American govern
ment's ability to pull this off. They
weren't necessarily skeptical about
whether it was a good thing to get rid
of Saddam and they weren't skeptical
about whether the Iraqi people
weren't better off on balance. But
they were skeptical that the Ameri
cans could make it work. And that
was something. I guess, that I didn't
really grasp fully at that time.
Hut the story was great — there
were a lot of young people. You can't
go to Iraq if you've got a family, so
there were lots of young writers,
young photographers, activists,
NCiOs. lTiere was instant community
it was a little bit like being in col
lege.
TSI): [laughter] Do you miss
being in the field?
RR: Yeah, yeah I do, and I will
probably go back to being in the field
at some stage...! would hate to wake
up in twenty years and still be
chained to a desk. But I really like
what I do now — to shape coverage.
When you're an editor you're in
volved in a lot of different decisions...
|and] that's fine. The other problem

with being out in the field, to some ex
tent. is that you're filing stories and
they're not running... With the Inter
net. things are a bit different — sto
ries that don't run on the print maga
zine you write for online.
TSI): Did you feel like you were
doingsignificantly different work than
colleagues at the New York l imes and
Washington Post because you weren't
on pressure to file even,' day?
KK: Yeah. I spent the last month
working on one story — 1 didn't do
anything else, just reporting one
story. That's not a luxury available to
most other journalists there. But the

IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING [IN IRAQ] IS BASICALLY PREVENTING
THINGS FROM GETTING WORSE, BUT WE HAVE NO ABILITY AT THIS STAGE TO
MAKE THINGS BETTER. AND THAT'S DISHEARTENING."

New York Times correspondents
have to churn out not only stories
every day, but some of them have to
write three or four versions of the
same story a day. But these people,
who have been there reporting from
the beginning, have done incredible
work...they're real heroes.
TSI): Would you want their job?
RR: Nah... I think one thing you
realize in life is you have to be honest
with yourself with what you think you
want to do and what you're actually
good at. 1 know I'm never going to be
a good war correspondent; I'm not
constitutionally up for it. I have that
desire, but it's not what I see in my
mind my life being about.
TSI): And being on the front line,
being in the war zone, beinu under

some point in life. The thing about
journalism is that it isn't a linear path,
the way other professions are — and
if you think it is. you're in the wrong
job. Journalism is something you do
your whole life.'l lie re's a reason jour
nalists become journalists and not ac
ademics. and that's because journal
ists like me like to cover a wide vari
ety of things. I imagine at some stage
Ill leave journalism, and try my hand
at another line of work. But I think
I ll always come back to writing.
TSI): What was driving you to go
into writing in the first place? Did
you want to learn, did you find some
thing out. persuade people of some
thing...
RR: Writing just kind of came to
me. I iiuess. I don't think 1 went into

fire — you weren't really into that?
KR: Yeah, you don't have to do
that sort of thing, you know. You'd
only do it if you really felt you'd enjoy
it, and 1 mean. 1 can see the appeal, i
hut there are other things I want to do
with my life. i
TS1): Like what? You were in Iraq i
for a bit. now you're editing in New j
York, hut you don't want to be doing
that forever. What are you aiming for ;
— what would you like to do. ideally? I
KK: I will hopefully write for
books. I'm writing one now, at least i
starting one. I think most people in
journalism long to run something, at <

this with a larger mission, but I under
stand and I appreciate and I'm grate
ful for the impact you can have. Even
now when people read your stories, 1
don't know if they make a difference
in terms of grand social change, but
they make a difference in that they
make people's lives a little more en
joyable. and that's a good feeling.
Hven if they hate the stuff I write. I'm
glad I get people thinking, get them
talking, and maybe get them angry.
TSI): So what's the most interest
ing story you've reported on?
RRtThe story 1 feel the most own
ership in. pride in was the Person of
the Year story for 2003.The person of
the year was The American Soldier,
and the story was a profile of a pla
toon of soldiers who we lived with,
myself and Michael Weisskopf. We
lived with these guys and went on pa
trol with them every day.and spent
the better part of ;i month with them,
and we wrote a story.
It was punctuated by the very last
night we were reporting — Michael
was riding around in the back in the
truck, I was writing the story back in
our house, a grenade was thrown into
the truck, Michael picked the
grenade up to throw it out. it blew up
in his hand, he lost his right hand. Our
photographer, Jim Nachtwey, was in
jured in that incident as well. They
both would have died if Michael had
not picked up the grenade.The next
48 hours were basically trying to get
this guy to emergency treatment. Hie
military was a bit hesitant about it.
And the story came out — after
Michael was airlifted I finished the
story. Aside from that incident, I'm
proud of that story as a narrative
piece of reporting; partly because I
spent a lot of time on it and felt close
to the subjects.
