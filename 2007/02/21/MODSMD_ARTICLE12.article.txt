## ASSU urges Univ to rethink living wage Senators say current policy is too restrictive 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate passed an advocacy bill last
night recommending that the Uni
versity remove six of seven restric
tions to its living wage policy for
subcontracted workers.
"The University says that they
have a living wage for subcontract
ed workers, but it contains restric
tions which have the effect of ex
cluding people from the living
wage." said senator Lisa Llanos '09,
who co-authored the bill.
To be eligible for the current liv
ing wage policy, subcontracted
workers must meet several qualifi
cations. They must provide services
to Stanford's core campus (exclud
ing the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center) that might otherwise
have been provided by Stanford
employees. They must also be em
ployed for at least 30 hours per
week for a period of six months, or
whatever period the contractor
specifies for its employers to be
considered "regular employees."
Their contracts must also exceed
$100,000 in aggregate value and
must have a duration of greater
than one year. Their work must be
performed for the University di
rectly — excluding tenants or other
entities conducting business on
Stanford-owned land, including
Stanford Hospital. The policy also
excludes subcontracted workers
who belong to any kind of collec
tive bargaining relationship.
'ITie ASSU recommended the
removal of all of these restrictions,
"maintaining only the qualification
that the employer of affected work
ers have an agreement with Stan
ford University," according to the
bill.
The advocacy bill represents the

latest development in a campaign
that began in May 2003. when a
five-day hunger strike held by the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition
resulted in the formation of a Pres
idential Advisory Committee
(PAC) to advise President John
Hennessy on workplace policies, in
cluding the living wage.
The PAC submitted a report to
Hennessy in June 2004 criticizing
the University's living wage policy.
"If Stanford University operates
a living wage' policy, it should not
attach so many conditions to its ap
plicability that it has the effect of
excusing many contracted workers
from that policy," the report reads.
"A "living wage' policy that appends
a string of conditions creates in
equities among similar workers and
risks giving the unfortunate im
pression that Stanford's employ
ment policies do not really mean
what they are proclaimed to be."
The PAC recommended that the
University remove three restric
tions to its living wage policy and
investigate and possibly remove
two others.
Hennessy responded to the
PAC's recommendations in the
winter of 2005 by referring them to
the Human Resources Depart
ment, which subsequently rejected
the suggestions and retained all
seven restrictions on the living
wage policy.
The bill passed by the ASSU last
night advocated the removal of six
of these seven restrictions.
Hie bill also recommended that
"the implementation of the broad
ened policy be decided and execut
ed in a transparent and democratic
process involving workers and stu
dents."
The Senate also passed over 30
special fees bills at its meeting last
night. Several senators noted that
the process went more smoothly
than it had in recent years, and that
there were no dissenting groups.
