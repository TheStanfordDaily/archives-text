## Bridge team headed to Nationals 
### LAURA RUMPF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Bridge Team is head
ed this summer to Nashville. Term.,
where it will compete at the 2(H)7 Na
tional Collegiate Bridge Champi
onships.
The team earned an invitation to
the tournament after winning all five
of its qualifying matches in the region
al competition, including two particu
larly fierce matches against teams
from I larvard and Yale. At nationals,
Stanford will face teams from Prince
ton and UCLA, among other top
competitors.
Stanford's bridge team has histori
cally enjoyed great success at the na
tional championships. In three of the
last four years, it has placed among
the nation's top three bridge teams.
Team captain Eric Mayefsky, a
graduate student in economics, attrib
uted Stanford's stellar record over the
last few years to the team's depth of
talented players.
"Stanford has maintained a critical
mass of high quality bridge players for
a long time," he said.

Mayefsky,however,expressed sur
prise at the team's outstanding quali
fying round performance.
"This was by all indications a much
weaker team than we have fielded in
the last five years," he said. "'Plat's
part of why our success in the qualifi
er was wonderful and unexpected."
Competing along with Mayefsky
on the four-member team are Belinda
Gu '07. Jonathan Pines '07 and Elena
Grewal. a research assistant in the
School of Education. I or most of the
team members, bridge was purely
recreational before they were intro
duced to the collegiate competition.
"Most of us were relatively new to
competitive bridge" Gu said. "For us.
the competition was more about the
experience."
Bridge is a card-game in which
teams of two strive to win a strategic
number of tricks. The game — which
necessitates both luck and a high de
gree of skill — has attracted quite a
following in the United States, count
ing billionaires Bill Gates and Warren
Buffet among its avid enthusiasts.
Team members explained why
they enjoy the game.

"It's just fun to relax alter a long
day of classes and meet other young
people who play bridge" Gu said."l
don't know how to explain why I
like bridge. In some sense you're
just sitting in a room for eight hours
staring at a bunch of cards, [but]
each hand is like a different puzzle.
It's thrilling that only one percent of
the time I actually manage to figure
it out."
"You can always keep learning
more" Grewal said. "We are a really
supportive team and we definitely
learn from each other."
The team team practices every
Tuesday night from N p.m. to 12 a.m at
Tresidder Union. All students are wel
come to participate and there are no
tryouts to join.
The squad plans to continue prac
ticing each Tuesday in preparation for
the summer tournament.
"UCLA is probably our main
competition." Grewal said. "Our
chances [of winning] are good,seeing
as we did so well in the qualifier."
