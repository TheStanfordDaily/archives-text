## Editorial Board For Old Union, transparency a must 
### 
When the University announced
plans to transform Old Union
into a true student union, stu
dents across campus were ecstatic. Per
haps now we would have a decent place to
hang out: one central location that would
be accessible to all students no matter
where they lived: one destination that
would be open not only late at night, but
during the weekends as well; one center
that would be cozv. inviting and conducive
to the social needs of the University's stu
dent population.
l ast forward a few years later, and amidst
construction delays. University officials
have announced that Old Union is nearing
completion. Yet members of the ASSI I have
recently voiced complaints about the cur
rent lack of student input in Old Union con
struction and concerns over late, unexpect
ed changes to the plan.
Ihis grievance sounds surprising, since
students were involved in the planning
process since before construction on Old
Union even began. The Student Activity
Space Task 112 orce, comprised of students
and administrators and now known as the
Student Activities Space Advisory Group,
was formed five years ago by former Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Gene Awakuni
as a way to address the lack of space for stu
dents at the University. Students and admin
istrators alike applauded the creation of this
committee, and it was through this group
that plans for the Old Union renovation
project were seriously proposed in a 2003
report.
It was also early in this process when eth
nic community centers and religious groups
on campus — future inhabitants of the new
Old Union — were consulted about their
needs. Students were involved in the nam
ing of the new multi-faith center to be

housed in Old Union and even got to
choose furniture for the site.
Because there was a great deal of stu
dent input on Old Union construction in
the past, we have to wonder: since the be
ginning of this academic year, why has the
input stopped? Why have no meetings of
the Student Activities Space Advisory
Group been called this year? How can
changes to a student center be made with
out student input?
It is impractical to believe that plans will
not change during the building's construc
tion process. I lowever. even it decisions are
made behind closed doors, these changes
should be made known to students and the
advisory group. Members of various ethnic
community centers are also unhappy with
their role in Old Union construction, saying
they have had minimal input. Since several
of these centers are going to be major occu
pants of Old Union, it is important to reach
out and consult these organizations as much
as possible.
()1 concern to students now are changes
to the plan of Old I Jnion that fail toconform
to current and future students' needs and
priorities, such as addressing the lack of so
cial space and the need for student group
work space on campus. When changes are
made in isolation, administrators are not
fully able to understand how those changes
will affect students. This problem could be
solved by immediately resuming meetings
of the advisory group and actively seeking
other forms of student input. Improving
communication between involved adminis
trators and students would make a big dif
ference in the success of the building. More
than for any other building on campus, stu
dent input is vital for Old Union to truly
earn a place in the hearts of the University
community.
