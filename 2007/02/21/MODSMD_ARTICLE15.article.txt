Last week was horrible. First I gave new
meaning to phrase "dance fever" by
becoming deathly ill in the middle of
Dance Marathon. Then I wrote a column
that was intended to be lighthearted and
harmless but ended up sparking a firestorm
ot curse words and debate (Lesson: If you
ever write "fuck you" in a column it will in
evitably be thrown back at you). To top it
off. my computer, affectionately named
"The Beast." crashed for the umpteenth
time. In case you're wondering,yes, I did fol
low my own advice and cry for three days
straight.
With the week behind me. 1 walked into
the bookstore early Saturday afternoon
feeling lost and alone. I moped around, con
sidering the idea of purchasing away my sor
rows. I glanced at a new book about Phe
nomonology (I just really liked that word),
but overall nothing seemed worth my
money.
Then I saw her out of the corner of my
eye. She was resting quietly, glowing with a
beautiful glossy screen and illuminated key
board. I grazed my hands against the soft
keys and knew right away she was the an
swer. Within thirty minutes I had bought my
first Mac.
I am not a computer expert by any
means, but I do know that this thing is top of
the line. The numbers with confusing
acronyms next to them are all extremely
high and I'm pretty sure if I just think really
hard, it will actually type my papers for me. I
was ecstatic just to finally own a functioning
computer, let alone one that came with a re
mote control. A remote control!
I skipped the entire way back from the
bookstore. I dashed up to my room and
began to carefully open the artistic, black
box. My hands were trembling with excite
ment. I plugged in the perfectly designed
magnetic chord and watched as the silver
stallion came to life. But before I could enter
my name I froze as a new emotion con
sumed me: guilt.
What did I just do'.' Was I another mate
rialistic sucker who was duped into buying
an expensive piece of plastic? My grin
quickly disappeared as I thought of the
other things this money could be spent on:
a month's supply of meals for a poor fami
ly. antiretroviral medicine for ten people,
or over one hundred legally purchased
CDs (somebody has to support the artist).
I couldn't help but think that Steve Jobs
was laughing at me from his apple-shaped
mansion. "You silly college student.you're
paying for the design, not the functionali
ty!"
I will admit I tried to follow the advice
of my favorite pop star and shake it off.

After all, I had all the justification in the
world to buy a new computer: My old com
puter was broken, it was once-in-a-lifetime
deal, I had worked hard and saved my
money. My upcoming birthday was the
icing on the cake.
1 also don't consider myself to be a slave
of consumerism. I can see through gimmicks
and infomercials (those knives can't possi
bly cut bricks). Not to mention the majority
ot my clothes are hand-me-downs or kirk
land brand and I have only owned one cell
phone my entire life.
Hi is was a rational purchase, I told mv
self.
Still, 1 stared down at the screen and
read: "Congratulations on your new Mac.
We're just as happy as you are." I knew it was
lying to me. I hesitantly clicked "cancel."
closed the lustrous screen, and placed it
back in the box. Not today, I decided.
I was so proud of myself for not succumb
ing to our greedy consumer culture. I mean,
seriously. Macs symbolize everything corpo
rate. All they care about is bamboozling
buyers with witty commercials, promoting
catchy songs, and making a sale. I was not
going to be their next victim.
I'eeling good about my decision, I went
back to my old computer, jerked open the
screen, and began typing away at a column
dedicated to anti-materialism. I was halfway
through (I think the line was."Stop buying
stuff from Ihe Man, dude,") whenThe Beast
crashed once again and I lost my entire col
umn.
Yup. you guessed it. My fingers are cur
rently dancing across my new Mac and I've
never felt better. Am I materialistic for
buying a Mac? Perhaps I decided a little
materialism here and there can be coun
tered by generosity, compassion and other
qualities that can't download illegal music
with amazing speed. It's a balancing act be
tween moderation in what you buy. and ap
preciation for what you already own. Be
lieve me when I tell you: I am very appre
ciative.
