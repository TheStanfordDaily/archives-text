# Right of passage... after passage after passage

When I was younger, I used to dream
of one day becoming a woman. Not
in a cheesy, self-affirming budding
feminist way: I mean 1 thought commercials
for feminine hygiene products were the pin
nacle of glamour. 1 dreamed that I too would
one day run on the beach or ride horseback,
casually feigning comfort. For six months I
wandered around my house wondering
when the heck Mother Nature's bat mitzvah
would arrive. Then, two weeks shy of my
thirteenth birthday. I suffered an epidemic
series of nosebleeds.
My god.' I thought,' Something has gone
terribly, terribly wrong.'
One concerned conversation with the
middle school nurse and several ambiguous
diagrams later, it became clear that I am a
more or less normally-functioning human
being, but to this very day. whenever I'm in an
arid climate and my nose starts bleeding. I am
awash in a sea of deep, indelible shame.
The point is, the ravages of puberty leave

no one unscathed. No matter how much we.
as juveniles, fantasize about adult life (which,
if the IRS. DMV, GREs and several other
ominous acronyms are to be believed, is a
mundane blood-sucker), it cannot be denied
that sometimes the rites of passage that take
us there, prying our sweet fingers one by one
from the idyllic shores of innocent adoles
cence. are pretty abysmal.
First bicycle accident, senior prom, losing
your virginity: these are all pretty grisly
events. But in the past month I have stumbled
upon the rite of passage that tops them all —

the one that makes my days of reaching for
Kleenex while I wished for Kotex seem like a
walk in the park — the single superlative
transition to gory adulthood: I am reading
War and Peace for the first time.
As a Russian Literature major, this is the
one hurdle that I have been waiting my
whole life to fly over. Or drag my broken,
mangled self under, as the case may be. War
and Peace is the one huge, inviolable princi
ple governing any niggling interest in Russ
ian literature; it is the seminal work that
every crazy half-blind homeless guy on the
street has at least heard of and will be disap
pointed if you haven't read.
When my CS-major boyfriend used to ask
why I hadn't read War and Peace, I would al
ways counter: "Why isn't there a robot in
every American household?" And as far as I
can tell, the answers are about the same:
Dude, it's just going totake a while, okay? It's


Lewin

Atomic Nectarine
not that easy.
Then when he spent the summer
working on Stanford's Artificial In
telligence Robot project, I knew I
had to take the plunge. 1 dragged
Tolstoy into the ring and just hoped
he'd give me a fair fight.
Right off the bat. to he frank, I
wanted to hate this novel. I wanted
to hate Tolstoy. I've always felt a cer
tain antipathy toward him, not least
because he seems in some lights to
be a senile old charlatan: toward the
end of his life, he denounced all of
his literary works and went around
in a peasant's cassock promoting
pacifism, chastity and vegetarianism
— each value more profane than the
last! I cynically choose to believe he
sought to abolish these sins not be
cause he wanted people to exist in
harmony, but because he hoped that
if his successors led perfectly virtu
ous lives, they would be too boring to
write literature that might rival his.
Because of these strongly ideo
logical leanings, moreover, his work
has that distinct cardboard smack of
being low-fat and morally nourish
ing— moms love it.and kids spit it
into their napkins when she isn't
looking.
Much to my su r prise. though, the
novel's actually pretty okay. In fact,
it's good. epic, possibly on its way to
becoming a much-beloved classic?
Halfway through the first chapter. 1
came to the shocking realization
that, although it is a 1500-page brick
written by a bearded old dead guy,
the novel is still alive: The charac
ters' epiphanies are still relevant,
(interminable) descriptions of
wounded soldiers are emotionally
moving, and the diction isn't chock
full of "hence"sand "thither"s like
our good buddy Chaucer's. War and
Peace is a great novel that is actual
ly... well, great.
Don't get me wrong, the canoni
cal complaint that the book is unbe
lievably long does not fall on deaf
ears.The novel is so crammed full of
detail that it takes a little longer to
read it than it would for the events
to take place: according to the back

of the hook, the story unfolds over
the course of seven years, and I
think it's going to take me that lung
to finish it. Every time the charac
ters eat a meal, it's about time for
me to nuke up another Hot Pocket.
Frankly, 1 think the 'Iblstoy Estate
should sue the creators of "24" for
stealing the concept of real-time
programming.
But while he's doing it.he creates
a world so detailed and realistic that
it colors the non-Tolstoy parts of my
actual life luridly artificial, like those
ugly colorized episodes of "Gilli
gan's Island," where Gilligan's shirt
is a bleeding tomato and Ginger's
hair gives you a migraine. Even
though we've been living in this
world, presumably, since birth. Tol
stoy has a knack for making you re
ally feel all the way to the roots of
your teeth how an oak tree scratches
your fingertips or the way crumbling
plaster smells beneath the wallpaper
in someone's second-best parlor.
It's easy to get sucked in and hard
to see why you shouldn't. Reading
Tolstoy is kind of like agreeing to go
visit my parents for the weekend: the
furniture is comfortable, but on one
level 1 know that he wants me to
admit my life isn't going the direc
tion I want it to. A beautiful descrip
tion of a sunset, some subtle diction,
maybe I should give up meat — and
sex?
I think that's where the lite of
passage comes into play: we spend so
much time defining ourselves by
looking to our heroes, but some
times butting heads (and ideologies)
with someone we cannot stand is
even more valuable. 1 still resent Tol
stoy's grumpy-old-mannishness and
wish he could have edited out, oh. a
few hundred thousand words, but
grappling with him one-on-one has
definitely pushed me a few steps to
ward academic adulthood.
At least, that's so far. I'll let you
know for sure when I finally finish
the book, in six or seven more years.

Kat heard an urban legend that Tol
stoy went so crazy toward the end of
his life because he had syphilis;
Wikipedia neither confirms nor de
nies the rumor. If you know any old
Russian physicians who can clear that
mystery up, let Kat know at
klewin@stanford.edu.
