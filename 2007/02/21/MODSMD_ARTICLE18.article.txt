# Right of passage... after passage after passage

When I was younger, I used to dream
of one day becoming a woman. Not
in a cheesy, self-affirming budding
feminist way: I mean 1 thought commercials
for feminine hygiene products were the pin
nacle of glamour. 1 dreamed that I too would
one day run on the beach or ride horseback,
casually feigning comfort. For six months I
wandered around my house wondering
when the heck Mother Nature's bat mitzvah
would arrive. Then, two weeks shy of my
thirteenth birthday. I suffered an epidemic
series of nosebleeds.
My god.' I thought,' Something has gone
terribly, terribly wrong.'
One concerned conversation with the
middle school nurse and several ambiguous
diagrams later, it became clear that I am a
more or less normally-functioning human
being, but to this very day. whenever I'm in an
arid climate and my nose starts bleeding. I am
awash in a sea of deep, indelible shame.
The point is, the ravages of puberty leave

no one unscathed. No matter how much we.
as juveniles, fantasize about adult life (which,
if the IRS. DMV, GREs and several other
ominous acronyms are to be believed, is a
mundane blood-sucker), it cannot be denied
that sometimes the rites of passage that take
us there, prying our sweet fingers one by one
from the idyllic shores of innocent adoles
cence. are pretty abysmal.
First bicycle accident, senior prom, losing
your virginity: these are all pretty grisly
events. But in the past month I have stumbled
upon the rite of passage that tops them all —

the one that makes my days of reaching for
Kleenex while I wished for Kotex seem like a
walk in the park — the single superlative
transition to gory adulthood: I am reading
War and Peace for the first time.
As a Russian Literature major, this is the
one hurdle that I have been waiting my
whole life to fly over. Or drag my broken,
mangled self under, as the case may be. War
and Peace is the one huge, inviolable princi
ple governing any niggling interest in Russ
ian literature; it is the seminal work that
every crazy half-blind homeless guy on the
street has at least heard of and will be disap
pointed if you haven't read.
When my CS-major boyfriend used to ask
why I hadn't read War and Peace, I would al
ways counter: "Why isn't there a robot in
every American household?" And as far as I
can tell, the answers are about the same:
Dude, it's just going totake a while, okay? It's
