# Wiener Opernball brings class to Stanford
## 
### 
For one night out of the year, the word
"Wiener" ceased to he funny (at least
for everyone else in the room), as Stan
ford participated in a nearly 80 year-old tra
dition that we conveniently appropriated
from Austria, the Wiener ()pernball. or Vien
nese Ball.
I was clad in only the finest of footwear,
purple tennis shoes, that is. My tuxedo — de
spite the fact that I kind of had it shipped
from home, and that it was originally pur
chased at a thrift store, and that the pants
were roughly 5 sizes too long, and that it had
with it the wrong kind of white shirt
looked splendid indeed.
I had prepared heavily for this affair,
going to exactly one and a half of the eight
dance classes offered, and attempting to
learn how to waltz from an online diagram
with multicolored shoe outlines. Although I
was unable to find the seemingly requisite
monocle and top hat. I figured if I assumed a
haughty enough ;iir. I could pass for high so
ciety.
As we set off on our journey to our glori

ous destination, in what amounted to a splen
did carriage (read: Greyhound Bus). the air
was rife with sophistication. Hie socialites in
front of us in the carriage, discussing French
philosophers (Borat), only further assured
me of the level of elegance and refinement
which was to he expected at this affair.
As the ceremonies began, punch and
cheese were served. 1 took more than my fair
share, trying to get the most out of the rela
tively large price tag. I even tried to lick the
ice sculpture in the lobby.hearing from a kind
uppcrclassman that it would bring me luck in
the upcoming year. When 1 entered the pri-

Mary dance lloor. however, I really was taken
aback.
All the big names were there: Rich Uncle
Pennybags ( ITie Monopoly Guy), Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, and even Donald Trump.
Or at least people who looked enough like
the above-mentioned to warrant an elbow
jab at my date.
On the dance floor of this ball, even the
sketchy grad students suddenly became less
sketchy, as we got a look at their softer, more
refined, and only slightly less predatory danc
ing habits. Forced to learn some technique
(as opposed to subjecting their target to a tor
rent ot heavy gyrating), these men were cast
in a new light.
And.the crowd that I usually see every
Friday breaking windows with the intensity
of their drunken pelvic thrusting (Ahem, this
actually happened...) was, for one night, clad
in glorious sequins and tuxedos.
Instead of counting loudly as they stood
upside-down to take "hits" from a tube 4-

inches in diameter and filled with
lukewarm and often expired ale, my
fellow Stanfordites were gliding
gracefully across the floor, and the
past was at least somewhat forgot
ten.
Everyone looked splendid, and I
mean this. Except for one gentleman
who painted himself up like the guy
from Phantom of the Opera. That
was both highly unnecessary and al
most comical, in an "I'm taking my
self very seriously despite the pres
ence of the right half of a yin-yang on
my face" kind of way. 1 sincerely
hope he was part of some perform
ance that 1 happened to miss.
Being unable to dance, due to a
random dizzy spell that happened to
last the entire night, my hot date and
1 were relegated to floor-side view
ing, and we caught some pretty
snazzy moves.The Swing Room was
a nice change, offering a view of
what sexually-charged 1930s danc
ing culture might really have been
like.
TTie "concept-dances" in the mid
dle really caught me off guard, rang
ing from some pretty rootin' and/or
tootin' Charleston footwork to a
dance in which the men wore fish
like scaly blue tops and the women
wore 80s spandex and hopped over
the aforementioned fishes.
But overall, for one night. Stan
ford became civilized beyond words,

and with a history of midnight golf
cart debauchery and water balloon
drive-bys behind us. we celebrated
like it was 1939.
1 did a bit of research into the
Wiener Opernball of Austria, and
came up with a very interesting find
ing. Similar to our own ball, the orig
inal has been host to such distin
guished guests as Italian opera
singer Sophia Loren, Geri Halliwell
(That is to say."Ginger Spice"). Car
men Electra, Pamela Anderson, and.
yes,even the fashionable and sophis
ticated Paris Hilton.
Perhaps at the next Viennese
Ball, as we glide across the floor, the
train of our dresses following us and
the tail of our coats swishing in time
to the glorious music of the 19th cen
tury. we would do best to think of
these society women, the pinnacles
of grace and good sense in a world
fraught with corruption.
And we would do best to consid
er the implications of such splendid
dancing on our lives at Stanford. As 1
reflect back. I realize that we are a
very sophisticated campus. Perhaps
it wasn't as clear to me as the noble
society people behind me in the car
riage started making out on the way
back, but it is painfully obvious now:
we are very chic, urbane, and sophis
ticated. At least for one night out of
the vear.

Nat wishes to apologize to Paris
Hilton for any unintentional jabs at
her integrity. If you are one of her
many, many supporters, please drop a

ing culture might really have been
like.
TTie "concept-dances" in the mid
dle really caught me off guard, rang
ing from some pretty rootin' and/or
tootin' Charleston footwork to a
dance in which the men wore fish
like scaly blue tops and the women
wore 80s spandex and hopped over
the aforementioned fishes.
But overall, for one night. Stan
ford became civilized beyond words,

and with a history of midnight golf
cart debauchery and water balloon
drive-bys behind us. we celebrated
like it was 1939.
1 did a bit of research into the
Wiener Opernball of Austria, and
came up with a very interesting find
ing. Similar to our own ball, the orig
inal has been host to such distin
guished guests as Italian opera
singer Sophia Loren, Geri Halliwell
(That is to say."Ginger Spice"). Car
men Electra, Pamela Anderson, and.
yes,even the fashionable and sophis
ticated Paris Hilton.
Perhaps at the next Viennese
Ball, as we glide across the floor, the
train of our dresses following us and
the tail of our coats swishing in time
to the glorious music of the 19th cen
tury. we would do best to think of
these society women, the pinnacles
of grace and good sense in a world
fraught with corruption.
And we would do best to consid
er the implications of such splendid
dancing on our lives at Stanford. As 1
reflect back. I realize that we are a
very sophisticated campus. Perhaps
it wasn't as clear to me as the noble
society people behind me in the car
riage started making out on the way
back, but it is painfully obvious now:
we are very chic, urbane, and sophis
ticated. At least for one night out of
the vear.

Nat wishes to apologize to Paris
Hilton for any unintentional jabs at
her integrity. If you are one of her
many, many supporters, please drop a
line at nat.hillard@stiinford.edu to
