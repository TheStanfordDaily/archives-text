# Wiener Opernball brings class to Stanford
## 
### 
For one night out of the year, the word
"Wiener" ceased to he funny (at least
for everyone else in the room), as Stan
ford participated in a nearly 80 year-old tra
dition that we conveniently appropriated
from Austria, the Wiener ()pernball. or Vien
nese Ball.
I was clad in only the finest of footwear,
purple tennis shoes, that is. My tuxedo â€” de
spite the fact that I kind of had it shipped
from home, and that it was originally pur
chased at a thrift store, and that the pants
were roughly 5 sizes too long, and that it had
with it the wrong kind of white shirt
looked splendid indeed.
I had prepared heavily for this affair,
going to exactly one and a half of the eight
dance classes offered, and attempting to
learn how to waltz from an online diagram
with multicolored shoe outlines. Although I
was unable to find the seemingly requisite
monocle and top hat. I figured if I assumed a
haughty enough ;iir. I could pass for high so
ciety.
As we set off on our journey to our glori

ous destination, in what amounted to a splen
did carriage (read: Greyhound Bus). the air
was rife with sophistication. Hie socialites in
front of us in the carriage, discussing French
philosophers (Borat), only further assured
me of the level of elegance and refinement
which was to he expected at this affair.
As the ceremonies began, punch and
cheese were served. 1 took more than my fair
share, trying to get the most out of the rela
tively large price tag. I even tried to lick the
ice sculpture in the lobby.hearing from a kind
uppcrclassman that it would bring me luck in
the upcoming year. When 1 entered the pri-

Mary dance lloor. however, I really was taken
aback.
All the big names were there: Rich Uncle
Pennybags ( ITie Monopoly Guy), Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, and even Donald Trump.
Or at least people who looked enough like
the above-mentioned to warrant an elbow
jab at my date.
On the dance floor of this ball, even the
sketchy grad students suddenly became less
sketchy, as we got a look at their softer, more
refined, and only slightly less predatory danc
ing habits. Forced to learn some technique
(as opposed to subjecting their target to a tor
rent ot heavy gyrating), these men were cast
in a new light.
And.the crowd that I usually see every
Friday breaking windows with the intensity
of their drunken pelvic thrusting (Ahem, this
actually happened...) was, for one night, clad
in glorious sequins and tuxedos.
Instead of counting loudly as they stood
upside-down to take "hits" from a tube 4-
