## Alum donates $75 million 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Jerry Yang, University trustee
and co-founder of Yahoo!, and
Akiko Yamazaki, his wife, recently
pledged $75 million to the Stanford
Challenge fundraising effort in an
attempt to promote interdiscipli
nary programs at the University.
A large chunk of the money —
$50 million — will be used to fi
nance the construction of the new
Environment and Energy Build
ing, and $5 million is earmarked for
the Learning and Knowledge Cen

ter at the School of Medicine. The
remaining $20 million is still undes
ignated.
"This is a story of wonderful
motivations, good people and good
alums," said I ioward Pearson, a de
velopment officer at the Office of
Development. "Jerry and Akiko
see that there are areas of society
that need help, which explains why
part of their donation is designated
for the environment and medi
cine."
Yang '90 and Yamazaki '90 have
previously made several gifts to the
University, but the $75 million

pledge is the largest by far.
"One of the things that is really
wonderful about their gifts is that
they recognize the need for facili
ties." Pearson said. "Facilities are
an important need because they
aren't funded by other resources at
the university, such as government
grants for research."
Much of the money will be used
to fund the construction of the new
Environment and Energy Build
ing. which is the first of four build
ings in the new Science and Engi-
