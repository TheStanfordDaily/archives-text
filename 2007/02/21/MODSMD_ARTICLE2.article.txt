# DONATIONS & GRANTS
## Alum donates $75 million 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Jerry Yang, University trustee
and co-founder of Yahoo!, and
Akiko Yamazaki, his wife, recently
pledged $75 million to the Stanford
Challenge fundraising effort in an
attempt to promote interdiscipli
nary programs at the University.
A large chunk of the money —
$50 million — will be used to fi
nance the construction of the new
Environment and Energy Build
ing, and $5 million is earmarked for
the Learning and Knowledge Cen

ter at the School of Medicine. The
remaining $20 million is still undes
ignated.
"This is a story of wonderful
motivations, good people and good
alums," said I ioward Pearson, a de
velopment officer at the Office of
Development. "Jerry and Akiko
see that there are areas of society
that need help, which explains why
part of their donation is designated
for the environment and medi
cine."
Yang '90 and Yamazaki '90 have
previously made several gifts to the
University, but the $75 million

pledge is the largest by far.
"One of the things that is really
wonderful about their gifts is that
they recognize the need for facili
ties." Pearson said. "Facilities are
an important need because they
aren't funded by other resources at
the university, such as government
grants for research."
Much of the money will be used
to fund the construction of the new
Environment and Energy Build
ing. which is the first of four build
ings in the new Science and Engi-

Trustee Jerry Yang
'90, co-founder of
Yahoo!, has
pledged $75 mil
lion to the University
in an effort to pro
mote interdiscipli
nary programs. $50
million is earmarked
for the new Environ
ment and Energy
building.
neering Quad.The new building will
house several programs, including
the Woods Institute, the Civil and
Environmental Engineering and
Earth Systems departments as well
as the Bill Lane Center for the
Study of the North American West.
Construction began about a year
ago and is due to be completed in
December 2007.
"The building will become a
coming-together place for the en
tire environmental community at
Stanford," said Jeffrey Koseff, a pro
fessor in Civil and Environmental
Engineering and the director of the
Woods Institute. "This building is
really the core of the program: with
out it, a lot of what is important

coming together, meeting face-to
face— wouldn't be able to hap
pen."
Richard Luthy, a senior fellow
at the Woods Institute and a pro
fessor of Civil and Environmental
Engineering, said that faculty
would be grouped into the new
building in an interdisciplinary
fashion — according to the issue
that they are confronting rather
than by department.
"This is a more efficient way to
come up with solutions to problems
and we will probably be able to
come up with better solutions,"
Luthy said. "We are extremely ex
cited about the opportunities the
new building presents and are
thankful to the donors who helped
realize the vision."
Fundraising continues for the
Environment and Energy Building,
which carries an estimated price tag
of $118 million. Koseff said Yang

and Yamazaki's donation is the
largest expected and that the
donors would have the option of
naming the building.

Construction has not yet begun
on the I.earning and Knowledge
Center and is currently scheduled to

start in March 2008. According to
the School of Medicine Web site.the
building "will promote active, im
mersive and team-based learning
that leverage innovative simulation
techniques and wireless tools" and
will house "flexible and technologi
cally advanced medical education
facilities."
It has not yet been determined
how the remaining $20 million of
the donation will be spent, though
the decision will be up to Yang, Ya
mazaki and the University.
"Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamaza
ki are a fairly young couple, so lor
them to step up and make a very
significant donation makes a good
example." Pearson said. "It is won
derful to have alums like Jerry and
Akiko who do so much because
otherwise it just wouldn't happen."
