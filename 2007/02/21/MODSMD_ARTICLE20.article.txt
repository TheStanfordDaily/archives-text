### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Ihe No. 6 Stanford men's gymnas
tics team sent California for a flip this
past weekend, as the Cardinal came
out on top with a decisive 214.45-
210.55 win at the Big Flip Off. Stan
ford improved to 3-0 for the season,
and it looks to move up the ranks and
contend for a national championship.
The Cardinal came into Friday's
match at Burnham Pavilion with 11
rather than the standard 12 gymnasts.
Injuries have plagued the 16-man ros
ter. putting pressure on each remain
ing gymnast to perform.
"1 don't think we were worried, but
we were very aware of the importance
of each routine." junior co-captain
David Sender said.
With Stanford handicapped, the
N0.9 C iolden Bears (2-3) were looking
to take advantage, and Sender said the
Cardinal "didn't count Cal out."
"They're a talented team, and if
they can put it all together, they can
rival most other teams — they just
haven't yet." he said.
Hie Bears couldn't prove them
selves yet again, as Stanford won five
of the six events, with four of the top
finishes. Sender led the Cardinal with
the top team finish in four of the six
events, with two of those as the top
event scores. Senior Peter Derman
and sophomore Bryant Hadden
paced Stanford on the rings, each
recording a 9.4.
Starting the Cardinal off on Friday
was GregTer-Zakhariants on the floor

"Eric had a very good meet and he
stepped up for us with a solid vault and
a high score on the floor, which we
were struggling on." Sender said.
It was the first of Sender's two

Senior co-captain Dylan Carney and his 10 healthy teammates rallied to knock off visiting Cal this weekend, de

Ihe No. 6 Stanford men's gymnas
tics team sent California for a flip this
past weekend, as the Cardinal came
out on top with a decisive 214.45-
210.55 win at the Big Flip Off. Stan
ford improved to 3-0 for the season,
and it looks to move up the ranks and
contend for a national championship.
The Cardinal came into Friday's
match at Burnham Pavilion with 11
rather than the standard 12 gymnasts.
Injuries have plagued the 16-man ros
ter. putting pressure on each remain
ing gymnast to perform.
"1 don't think we were worried, but
we were very aware of the importance
of each routine." junior co-captain
David Sender said.
With Stanford handicapped, the
N0.9 C iolden Bears (2-3) were looking
to take advantage, and Sender said the
Cardinal "didn't count Cal out."
"They're a talented team, and if
they can put it all together, they can
rival most other teams — they just
haven't yet." he said.
Hie Bears couldn't prove them
selves yet again, as Stanford won five
of the six events, with four of the top
finishes. Sender led the Cardinal with
the top team finish in four of the six
events, with two of those as the top
event scores. Senior Peter Derman
and sophomore Bryant Hadden
paced Stanford on the rings, each
recording a 9.4.

clean double full dismount. The rou
tine was soon followed by junior Eric
Alcaraz's event-high 9.3— his first
collegiate win.
"Eric had a very good meet and he
stepped up for us with a solid vault and
a high score on the floor, which we
were struggling on." Sender said.
It was the first of Sender's two
event wins for the night that followed,
slightly extending Stanford's early
lead from the floor (36.1) over C'al's
performance on the pommel horse
(34.4). Switching over to the horse.
Sender had a team-high 9.05 for a 34.9
Cardinal total compared to the Gold

Stanford followed with its
strongest event of the night, the rings;
despite missing four contenders was
able to dominate with the bare-mini
mum four gymnasts each scoring
above a 9.0. Before Dei man and I lad

stuck the landing on a career perform
ance to earn a 9.15.

Senior co-captain Dylan Carney and his 10 healthy teammates rallied to knock off visiting Cal this weekend, de
spite competing with one less man than usual. With the victory, Stanford remained undefeated at 3-0 on the year.

tine on the rings." Sender said. "He
was first up among the four gu\s we
had.and that's a really important posi
tion because it sets the tone for the
