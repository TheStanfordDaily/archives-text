# Major League drama
## 
### 
So. it seems that Alex Rodriguez
no longer likes Derek Jeter. Oh.
and Barry Bonds reported to
training camp on time, and there's al
ready a media frenzy trying to relate
to us the staggering proportions of
the real media frenzy that will begin
now that Barry Lamar has actually
shown up. And Manny Ramirez
doesn't plan on showing up until
March 1 — not that the Red Sox
heard it from him or anything, as re
liever Julian Tavarez passed along
the news to reporters on Monday.
And this is how we can all finally
sense that spring is just around the
corner. It's that time of year again,
when even the most casual fan can
feel the tension, hear the whining
and smell the drama.
Welcome to the circus that is
Major League Baseball.
Year after year, it gets more and
more unreal. The national pastime is
on its way to devolving into a soap
opera of rumor, back-stabbing and
major-league drama kings. And
somehow, we're all still hooked.
Heck, the only thing that's miss
ing is some kind of Tom Brady-Brid
get Moynahan baby story and really,
it would be unfair for one sport to
monopolize all the tabloid-esque
sports coverage in a given year.
And make no mistake, it's MLB
that has the near monopoly on sport
ing theatrics.
Baseball has the home run record
that no one really wants to see bro
ken. but that probably will be. And


Griffin

Rants and Raves
imagine the boos that will surround
the most hallowed record in the
game if Bonds passes or ties Hank
Aaron's mark of 755 on the road.
Baseball has the most overhyped,
overanalyzed sports rivalry in all of
North America — Peyton Manning
v.Tom Brady can't hold a candle to
Yanks-Sox fever, which has the na
tional media buzzing from April
through September. And there may
be even more talk about the Boston-
New York spending rivalry that oc
curs during the offseason.
Baseball has the true underdog
stories that enchant us every year.
Who wasn't surprised to see the low
budget Detroit Tigers unexpectedly
take down the megaspending Yan
kees in last year's postseason?
And baseball is the sport that
caters to the fan more than any
other. It takes a professional coach
or scout to analyze film from a foot
ball. basketball or hockey game and
tell the masses what went right or
wrong on a given play. But anyone
can look at the stat sheet in baseball
and see who really won the games,
whether a given trade was worth it,
or honestly compare players from
different eras.
So bring on the drama, and the
hype. Let us all know that A-Rod
doesn't like Jeter anymore, as if we
didn't already know that they aren't
friends and possibly never have
been. We can debate the importance
of Bonds' record breaking round
tripper when it happens, and we can
see Commissioner Bud Selig squirm
as he tries to decide how to cover the
fact that this is really his mess. Let
the underdogs rise, and the salary
top-heavy titans fall. Let's see if
Daisuke Matsuzaka really is all he's
cracked up to be, and if the gyroball
really does exist.
And enjoy this season while you
can, because before long, half of us
will be miserably disappointed as
our teams of choice fade into obscu
rity by June. Now is the time of year
when even the Pirates and Royals
are in the hunt, and honestly, Pitts
burgh and Kansas City natives de
serve every instant of ignorant bliss

they can get their hands on.
And this is the point of the col
umn where most people would
make predictions. But seriously —
it's February.The one thing I'm defi
nitely willing to predict is that who
ever does win it all. it probably won't
be who most would guess.That's bad
news for the Yankees, Tigers. Mets,
White Sox, Red Sox, Cubs and Car
dinals — the teams with the best
odds to win the World Series on one
popular website — but good news
for all the rest of us.
After all, who would have picked
the Cardinals in '06, the White Sox in
'05, the Red Sox in 04, the Marlins in
'03, the Angels in '02 or the Dia
mondbacks in '01? Every champi
onship team this millennium has
been a surprise, and there's no rea
son why this trend should stop this
year. Blame it on the Wild Card sys
tem, parity or the modern athlete's
psyche, but the favorites just don't
play like the favorites anymore.
So who do I like in '07? In the Na
tional League, I'll take the Dia
mondbacks, whose impressive
young corps of hitters is comple
mented by an inning-eating starting
rotation led by last year's NL Cy
Young award winner, Brandon
Webb. The Diamondbacks need a
bullpen, and they need their young
offense to develop quickly, but if
they catch some breaks they could
be the juggernauts of the NL this
year, and maybe for years to come
— even if they are wearing some se
riously ugly uniforms as of now.
In the AL, I expect this to finally
be the year that the Indians put it all
together, from Travis Hafner and
Grady Sizemore to CC Sabathia and
Cliff Lee. Cleveland plays in a
crowded division, full of powerful
teams (i.e. the whole of the Central
minus the Royals), but teams from
the AL Central have gone on to
postseason success in each of the
past two years as the White Sox and
Tigers took home an AL pennant
each. I'm betting lightning will strike
three times in the Midwest.
And as for who wins it all? Come
on, that can wait until at least March.

Denis Griffin is a junior who is actual

people will finally shut up about it. Let

And make no mistake, it's MLB
that has the near monopoly on sport
ing theatrics.
Baseball has the home run record
that no one really wants to see bro
ken. but that probably will be. And

Rants and Raves
imagine the boos that will surround
the most hallowed record in the
game if Bonds passes or ties Hank
Aaron's mark of 755 on the road.
Baseball has the most overhyped,
overanalyzed sports rivalry in all of
North America — Peyton Manning
v.Tom Brady can't hold a candle to
Yanks-Sox fever, which has the na
tional media buzzing from April
through September. And there may
be even more talk about the Boston-
New York spending rivalry that oc
curs during the offseason.
Baseball has the true underdog
stories that enchant us every year.
Who wasn't surprised to see the low
budget Detroit Tigers unexpectedly
take down the megaspending Yan
kees in last year's postseason?
And baseball is the sport that
caters to the fan more than any
other. It takes a professional coach
or scout to analyze film from a foot
ball. basketball or hockey game and
tell the masses what went right or
wrong on a given play. But anyone
can look at the stat sheet in baseball
and see who really won the games,
whether a given trade was worth it,
or honestly compare players from
different eras.
So bring on the drama, and the
hype. Let us all know that A-Rod
doesn't like Jeter anymore, as if we
didn't already know that they aren't
friends and possibly never have
been. We can debate the importance
of Bonds' record breaking round
tripper when it happens, and we can
see Commissioner Bud Selig squirm
as he tries to decide how to cover the
fact that this is really his mess. Let
the underdogs rise, and the salary
top-heavy titans fall. Let's see if
Daisuke Matsuzaka really is all he's
cracked up to be, and if the gyroball
really does exist.
And enjoy this season while you
can, because before long, half of us
will be miserably disappointed as
our teams of choice fade into obscu
rity by June. Now is the time of year
when even the Pirates and Royals
are in the hunt, and honestly, Pitts
burgh and Kansas City natives de
serve every instant of ignorant bliss

they can get their hands on.
And this is the point of the col
umn where most people would
make predictions. But seriously —
it's February.The one thing I'm defi
nitely willing to predict is that who
ever does win it all. it probably won't
be who most would guess.That's bad
news for the Yankees, Tigers. Mets,
White Sox, Red Sox, Cubs and Car
dinals — the teams with the best
odds to win the World Series on one
popular website — but good news
for all the rest of us.
After all, who would have picked
the Cardinals in '06, the White Sox in
'05, the Red Sox in 04, the Marlins in
'03, the Angels in '02 or the Dia
mondbacks in '01? Every champi
onship team this millennium has
been a surprise, and there's no rea
son why this trend should stop this
year. Blame it on the Wild Card sys
tem, parity or the modern athlete's
psyche, but the favorites just don't
play like the favorites anymore.
So who do I like in '07? In the Na
tional League, I'll take the Dia
mondbacks, whose impressive
young corps of hitters is comple
mented by an inning-eating starting
rotation led by last year's NL Cy
Young award winner, Brandon
Webb. The Diamondbacks need a
bullpen, and they need their young
offense to develop quickly, but if
they catch some breaks they could
be the juggernauts of the NL this
year, and maybe for years to come
— even if they are wearing some se
riously ugly uniforms as of now.
In the AL, I expect this to finally
be the year that the Indians put it all
together, from Travis Hafner and
Grady Sizemore to CC Sabathia and
Cliff Lee. Cleveland plays in a
crowded division, full of powerful
teams (i.e. the whole of the Central
minus the Royals), but teams from
the AL Central have gone on to
postseason success in each of the
past two years as the White Sox and
Tigers took home an AL pennant
each. I'm betting lightning will strike
three times in the Midwest.
And as for who wins it all? Come
on, that can wait until at least March.

Denis Griffin is a junior who is actual
ly hoping Barry will hit No. 756 so that
people will finally shut up about it. Let
him know how wrong he is at dj
