# Major League drama
## 
### 
So. it seems that Alex Rodriguez
no longer likes Derek Jeter. Oh.
and Barry Bonds reported to
training camp on time, and there's al
ready a media frenzy trying to relate
to us the staggering proportions of
the real media frenzy that will begin
now that Barry Lamar has actually
shown up. And Manny Ramirez
doesn't plan on showing up until
March 1 â€” not that the Red Sox
heard it from him or anything, as re
liever Julian Tavarez passed along
the news to reporters on Monday.
And this is how we can all finally
sense that spring is just around the
corner. It's that time of year again,
when even the most casual fan can
feel the tension, hear the whining
and smell the drama.
Welcome to the circus that is
Major League Baseball.
Year after year, it gets more and
more unreal. The national pastime is
on its way to devolving into a soap
opera of rumor, back-stabbing and
major-league drama kings. And
somehow, we're all still hooked.
Heck, the only thing that's miss
ing is some kind of Tom Brady-Brid
get Moynahan baby story and really,
it would be unfair for one sport to
monopolize all the tabloid-esque
sports coverage in a given year.
And make no mistake, it's MLB
that has the near monopoly on sport
ing theatrics.
Baseball has the home run record
that no one really wants to see bro
ken. but that probably will be. And
