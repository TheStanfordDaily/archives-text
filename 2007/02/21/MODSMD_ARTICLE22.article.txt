# VOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Card sink USC in overtime thriller 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
As the old saying goes, "give a
good team an inch, and they'll take a
mile."
Formerly top-ranked Southern
California certainly qualities as a
"good team," and by water polo
standards, Stanford certainly gave
the visiting Women of Troy that inch
(if not more) in their Saturday after
noon showdown.
The Cardinal surrendered multi
ple-goal leads twice in the game,
while committing a plethora of per
sonal fouls that afforded USC a
seemingly endless number of six
on-five advantages. Nevertheless,
the No. 3 Stanford women still man
aged to battle its way to a 10-8 over
time upset of the No. 2 Women of
Troy. Three unanswered Stanford
goals in the final four minutes of
overtime sealed the decision and
propelled the Cardinal to its biggest
victory of the season thus far.
The Stanford squad (7-1. 4-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
followed its sparkling effort against
USC with a 9-2 win over Cal-State
Northridge on Sunday to remain un
beaten in conference play.
Having suffered a tough loss at
the hands of USC two weekends
ago at the Stanford Invitational, the
Cardinal entered its rematch
against the Women of Troy looking
to take control of the game in the
early going. Junior driver Jackie
Gauthier got things started, turning
a perfect outlet pass from senior
goalie Meridith McColl into a fast
break goal just minutes into the first
period. Superb ball movement al
lowed sophomore Lolo Silver and
senior Christina Hewko to capital
ize on two more scoring opportuni
ties, and the Cardinal quickly built a
3-0 lead.
At that point, though, it was
USC's turn to come roaring back.
After picking up one goal near the
end of the first period on a five
meter penalty shot, the Women of
Troy found the back of the net twice

in the final 1:30 of the half to knot
the score at 4-4. The momentum
swing continued on into the third
period, as USC held Stanford score
less and took its first lead of the
game when junior Patty Cardenas
notched her second goal of the
match.
But the Women of Troy were un
able to stifle a Cardinal offensive in
the final frame, as Stanford began to
generate more pressure on the tran
sition. Freshman Kelly Eaton
brought the Cardinal back to even
with a cross-cage skip shot past USC
goalie Whitney Morgan. Shortly
thereafter, llewko converted a
Stanford man-up advantage, assist
ed by senior co-captain Katie
Hansen, as the Cardinal retook the
lead. Gauthier built the lead to two,
firing an outside shot into the top
corner of the cage as her surprised
defender looked on.
USC, however, refused to quit,
and erased the deficit in the final
minutes of the game. The tying goal,
which just barely bobbed across the
line after being knocked down by
McColl. came with just eight sec
onds remaining on the clock.
Still, the Cardinal maintained an

and the Cardinal countered on their

Sophomore two-meter Jessica Stef
fens put Stanford ahead for good,
fighting away from her defender at
set long enough to flip the ball past
Morgan's outstretched hand. Eaton
provided an insurance goal after re
ceiving a pass from fellow freshman
Kelsey Holshouser to conclude the
day's scoring.

"Since the game. 1 haven't been
able to stop smiling." Eaton said.
"Beating USC was a goal that we

As the old saying goes, "give a
good team an inch, and they'll take a
mile."
Formerly top-ranked Southern
California certainly qualities as a
"good team," and by water polo
standards, Stanford certainly gave
the visiting Women of Troy that inch
(if not more) in their Saturday after
noon showdown.
The Cardinal surrendered multi
ple-goal leads twice in the game,
while committing a plethora of per
sonal fouls that afforded USC a
seemingly endless number of six
on-five advantages. Nevertheless,
the No. 3 Stanford women still man
aged to battle its way to a 10-8 over
time upset of the No. 2 Women of
Troy. Three unanswered Stanford
goals in the final four minutes of
overtime sealed the decision and
propelled the Cardinal to its biggest
victory of the season thus far.
The Stanford squad (7-1. 4-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
followed its sparkling effort against
USC with a 9-2 win over Cal-State
Northridge on Sunday to remain un
beaten in conference play.
Having suffered a tough loss at
the hands of USC two weekends
ago at the Stanford Invitational, the
Cardinal entered its rematch
against the Women of Troy looking
to take control of the game in the
early going. Junior driver Jackie
Gauthier got things started, turning
a perfect outlet pass from senior
goalie Meridith McColl into a fast
break goal just minutes into the first
period. Superb ball movement al
lowed sophomore Lolo Silver and
senior Christina Hewko to capital
ize on two more scoring opportuni
ties, and the Cardinal quickly built a
3-0 lead.
At that point, though, it was
USC's turn to come roaring back.
After picking up one goal near the
end of the first period on a five
meter penalty shot, the Women of
Troy found the back of the net twice

in the final 1:30 of the half to knot
the score at 4-4. The momentum
swing continued on into the third
period, as USC held Stanford score
less and took its first lead of the
game when junior Patty Cardenas
notched her second goal of the
match.
But the Women of Troy were un
able to stifle a Cardinal offensive in
the final frame, as Stanford began to
generate more pressure on the tran
sition. Freshman Kelly Eaton
brought the Cardinal back to even
with a cross-cage skip shot past USC
goalie Whitney Morgan. Shortly
thereafter, llewko converted a
Stanford man-up advantage, assist
ed by senior co-captain Katie
Hansen, as the Cardinal retook the
lead. Gauthier built the lead to two,
firing an outside shot into the top
corner of the cage as her surprised
defender looked on.
USC, however, refused to quit,
and erased the deficit in the final
minutes of the game. The tying goal,
which just barely bobbed across the
line after being knocked down by
McColl. came with just eight sec
onds remaining on the clock.
Still, the Cardinal maintained an

optimistic attitude as the game
headed into overtime, despite the
fact that l ive of its players — four of
them starters — had fouled out of
the game. USC went up by one in
the first overtime frame.but I lewko
and the Cardinal countered on their
next possession to tie the score.
Sophomore two-meter Jessica Stef
fens put Stanford ahead for good,
fighting away from her defender at
set long enough to flip the ball past
Morgan's outstretched hand. Eaton
provided an insurance goal after re
ceiving a pass from fellow freshman
Kelsey Holshouser to conclude the
day's scoring.

"Since the game. 1 haven't been
able to stop smiling." Eaton said.
"Beating USC was a goal that we
had made and then executed on Sat
urday. Our coaches did such an ex
tensive analysis of our previous
game [against USC| that we were
ready for anything th.it [they] had to
dish out."
Perhaps even more significant
than the actual result of the contest
was the manner in which the Cardi
nal closed out the win. With all but
two of the team's starters out of the
game due to their foul counts, Stan
ford head coach John Tanner de
ployed his corps of underclassmen
to wage the overtime battle. And by
outplaying the Women of Troy in the
last six minutes of the game, the un
derclassmen demonstrated their
ability to handle any challenge
thrown their way.
"Having so many kick-outs was
actually a blessing in disguise," Gau
thier said. "It showed that we're one
of the deepest teams in collegiate
water polo. It basically proved that
it doesn't matter (whether] we have

Senior co-captain Alison Gre
