Presidents' Day Weekend
brought little relaxation time for the
Stanford women's lacrosse team,
which played the St. Mary's Gaels
on Friday before facing off against
the Duke Blue Devils on Sunday.
Although the Cardinal was able to
trounce the Gaels 22-6, it fell to the
No. 2 Blue Devils 14-6 in the first
home game of the season.
Stanford (1-2). heading into Fri
day's game with a 12-0 all-time
record against St. Mary's, beat the
Gaels with ease. Freshman Lauren
Schmidt got the Cardinal off to a
strong start, with her first goal com
ing only 1:20 into the first half. After
St. Mary's tied the score, the Stan
ford women went on an astonishing
13-1 scoring run, thanks in part to
three goals by senior l.iz Piselli. At
the half, the score stood at 14-2.
The second half flowed just as
easily for the Cardinal, who scored
eight more goals before the game
was over. Six players scored multi
ple goals for Stanford, including
freshman Amanda Schwab with
three and Dana Lindsey, Sarah
Blahnik and Daphne Peterson each
with two a piece. Lauren Schmidt
emerged as the game's leading scor
er with five goals. Five freshmen also
scored their first goals of the season.
The Cardinal women saw a very
different game against Duke on
Sunday, falling to the Blue Devils
14-6. Just three minutes into the first
half, the Cardinal women were
down by three. But the Card re
mained focused and got itself on the
board with key goals from Schmidt
and Piselli. By the time the whistle
blew for halftime, Stanford was only
behind by one, with the score at 6-5.
The outlook seemed more prom
ising for the Cardinal when Patterson
scored two minutes into the second
half, tying the score at 6-6. But then
the Blue Devils went on a 4-0 run to
take control of the game, scoring
eight more goals before the game
was over. Patterson led the Cardinal
with three goals, while junior goal
tender Laura Shane racked up 19
saves.
