## Stanford still stumped by SoCal squads 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In a rematch of last week's action, the mem
bers of the Stanford men's volleyball team could
not beat No. 3 UC-Irvine and No. 7 UCLA —
but they did take a step in the right direction.
After being swept by both teams on the road a
week ago. the Cardinal took the first game from
the Bruins in an exciting 30-28 finish.
"1 think we played better [than last week
end)." head coach John Kosty said. "1 think we
are playing better every single weekend, but the
hard part is that our opponents are getting bet
ter as the season progresses, too."
Die Anteaters (15-2. 9-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) showed why they are ranked
third in the nation with the 30-27, 30-22.30-20
sweep. Ihe Bruins (8-7,6-6) were surprised by
the ( ardinal (1-15,1-10) early, but rebounded to
seal the four-game win. 28-30. 30-23. 30-19, 30-
72
Despite the losses, Kosty pointed to the
progress his young squad has made in the first
half of the season.
"I think we have been pretty good with our
block and our defense," he said. "That is what I
have been most pleased with, and our passing is
getting better also. We are still not siding out at a
high percentage, but we are getting good
enough."
"The biggest thing we need to work on is
serving." Kosty continued."Not actually serving,
but more the theory of serving — what is a good

miss and what is a bad miss. It's not so much the
number of serves you miss that matters, but
when you miss them "
Serving proved a problem for Stanford this
weekend, as the team missed 42 serves in the
two matches combined.
"We are continually working on consisten
cy, and that was what we lacked this weekend
— especially consistency in serving." Kosty
said. "Our serving woes started in game one,
but we picked it up and were effective late in
the game. [Freshman setter] Kawika Shoji's
serving basically won the game for us. But then
we started having trouble again in the second
game; U( 'LA moved up ;i notch and we could
n't respond."
Against the Anteaters, the ('ardinal got off to
a quick start, going up 4-1. Irvine erased that
deficit, however, taking the lead for good. After
lighting off a game point, Stanford fell 30-27 in
the frame.
Stanford again led early in the second game
and held UC-Irvine off until a four-point run
turned a 16-14 Cardinal lead into an 18-16
deficit. From there, the Anteaters rolled to the
30-22 victory.
in the third game, it was Irvine pulling ahead
early for good. Stanford could not handle the
hot-hitting Anteaters and lost the frame, 30-20.
Junior outside hitter Matt Ceran and fresh
man right side Evan Romero notched nine kills
apiece to lead Stanford, with sophomore middle
blocker Brandon Williams chipping in eight on
.583 hitting. Ceran, Romero and freshman out

side hitter Ed Howell tallied five digs each,
while freshman middle blocker Garrett Werner
was in on all five of Stanford's blocks.
On Saturday, UCLA pulled ahead to start
the first game. After trailing 14-10,the Cardinal
went on a 5-1 run to tie the game at 15 apiece on
a block by Werner and Ceran. From then on, the
teams traded points and the lead until a three
point Stanford run forced a Bruins timeout.
UCLA led at 27-26, but the Cardinal jumped
back on top and closed out the game with a kill
by Romero, 30-28.
Neither team could keep the ball in the court
early in the second game, as five consecutive
servers missed. "Ihe Bruins finally broke that
streak and built a five-point lead at 12-7, which
they would not relinquish. After trading service
errors. UCLA won the game, 30-23, to even the
match.
The Bruins again took an early advantage in
the third, but Stanford fought back to force a 10-
10 tie. A missed serve gave the lead back to
UCLA, who scored four of the next five points.
The Bruins then put together runs of five points
and four points en route to the 30-19 game vic
tor)'.
A block gave Stanford the first point of the
fourth frame, but UCLA reeled off five straight
and quickly pulled ahead, 9-3.The Cardinal held
off three match points, but dropped the final
game 30-22.
Stanford outhit the Bruins in the first game
with a team percentage of .333. but finished with
a match total of only .129. Ceran had a team-

Die Anteaters (15-2. 9-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) showed why they are ranked
third in the nation with the 30-27, 30-22.30-20
sweep. Ihe Bruins (8-7,6-6) were surprised by
the ( ardinal (1-15,1-10) early, but rebounded to

Despite the losses, Kosty pointed to the
progress his young squad has made in the first
half of the season.
"I think we have been pretty good with our
block and our defense," he said. "That is what I
have been most pleased with, and our passing is
getting better also. We are still not siding out at a
high percentage, but we are getting good
enough."
"The biggest thing we need to work on is
serving." Kosty continued."Not actually serving,
but more the theory of serving — what is a good

miss and what is a bad miss. It's not so much the
number of serves you miss that matters, but
when you miss them "
Serving proved a problem for Stanford this
weekend, as the team missed 42 serves in the
two matches combined.
"We are continually working on consisten
cy, and that was what we lacked this weekend
— especially consistency in serving." Kosty
said. "Our serving woes started in game one,
but we picked it up and were effective late in
the game. [Freshman setter] Kawika Shoji's
serving basically won the game for us. But then
we started having trouble again in the second
game; U( 'LA moved up ;i notch and we could
n't respond."
Against the Anteaters, the ('ardinal got off to
a quick start, going up 4-1. Irvine erased that
deficit, however, taking the lead for good. After
lighting off a game point, Stanford fell 30-27 in
the frame.
Stanford again led early in the second game
and held UC-Irvine off until a four-point run
turned a 16-14 Cardinal lead into an 18-16
deficit. From there, the Anteaters rolled to the
30-22 victory.
in the third game, it was Irvine pulling ahead
early for good. Stanford could not handle the
hot-hitting Anteaters and lost the frame, 30-20.
Junior outside hitter Matt Ceran and fresh
man right side Evan Romero notched nine kills
apiece to lead Stanford, with sophomore middle
blocker Brandon Williams chipping in eight on
.583 hitting. Ceran, Romero and freshman out

side hitter Ed Howell tallied five digs each,
while freshman middle blocker Garrett Werner
was in on all five of Stanford's blocks.
On Saturday, UCLA pulled ahead to start
the first game. After trailing 14-10,the Cardinal
went on a 5-1 run to tie the game at 15 apiece on
a block by Werner and Ceran. From then on, the
teams traded points and the lead until a three
point Stanford run forced a Bruins timeout.
UCLA led at 27-26, but the Cardinal jumped
back on top and closed out the game with a kill
by Romero, 30-28.
Neither team could keep the ball in the court
early in the second game, as five consecutive
servers missed. "Ihe Bruins finally broke that
streak and built a five-point lead at 12-7, which
they would not relinquish. After trading service
errors. UCLA won the game, 30-23, to even the
match.
The Bruins again took an early advantage in
the third, but Stanford fought back to force a 10-
10 tie. A missed serve gave the lead back to
UCLA, who scored four of the next five points.
The Bruins then put together runs of five points
and four points en route to the 30-19 game vic

different aspects of the game, but haven't been
able to put the whole thing together yet."
