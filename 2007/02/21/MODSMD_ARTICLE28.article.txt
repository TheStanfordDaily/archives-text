### JACK SALISBURY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Re-asserting itself both in the Pacific-10
C "onference and on the national level, the No. 1
Stanford women's tennis team capped off a suc
cessful weekend by sweeping Southern Califor
nia and UCLA in Los Angeles.
The Cardinal started off the weekend well
with a dominating 5-2 victory over USC. Al
though the Women of Troy came into the match
ranked fifth nationally Stanford had little trou
ble from the start, winning the doubles point be
hind the duos of junior Whitney Deason and
senior Theresa Logar. and junior Celia Durkin
and senior Anne Yelsey.
Stanford did see two losses at the top two
spots in the singles matches, though; top-ranked
Lindsey Nelson of USC defeated Logar in a
hard-fought match while No. 9 Sarah Fansler
disposed of Yelsey.
Cardinal head coach Lele Forood was en
couraging of Logar after her loss at the hands of
Nelson, one of the best in the country.

"Lindsey was pretty tough." Forood said.
"Theresa's learning what its going to be like to
play a top player even time out. It's something
she's still adjusting to."
In the end. Stanford's depth at the lower po
sitions of the line-up was too much for the
Women of Troy, as Stanford picked up the four
remaining singles points.
Saturday's IJCLA match presented a differ
ent task for the Cardinal. Although the Bruins
came into the match ranked lower than USC,
they ended up giving top-ranked Stanford a
much tougher fight.
Stanford won the doubles point, but had
trouble in the singles half of the match. Logar.
Durkin and Deason all suffered losses, putting
the Cardinal in danger of losing. It wasn't until
freshman Lindsay Burdette defeated UCLA's
Elizabeth Lumpkin in a three-set thriller that
the Cardinal was able to capture the victory by a
narrow 4-3 margin.
Lumpkin had Burdette at match point twice
in the second set. and a single mistake by Bur
dette at either point would have cost Stanford

the match. But Burdette was able to fight hack,
and in the end won her individual match by a
final tally of 2-6,7-6,6-1.
"It was really exciting, but scary," Burdette
said of her showdown with Lumpkin.
Forood testified to her squad's tenacity in its
match against the Bruins.
"It was very good to survive that day and
come out with a win." she said. "It was especial
ly important for Lindsay â€” she did such a great
job in pulling away from her opponent."
UCLA gave the Cardinal women a good op
portunity to grind out a victory even when they
weren't at their best, Yelsey explained.
"I wouldn't say we underperformed." the
senior said. "[The close decision] definitely had
to do with UCLA being more inspired than be
fore. Overall, we were a little bit tired, and our
legs were a little bit dead. It was draining."
"When UCLA presented themselves to us,
I'm not sure that we played as well as we had the
day before [against USC]," Forood added.
Stanford also saw strong performances over
the weekend from sophomore Jessica Nyugen.

who won both of her singles matches.
"Jessica at four is just doing the job every
time out." Forood said."She's been as rock solid
as anyone could be on our team. She's doing
such a consistently good job every time out."
On the whole, the team was pleased with its
performance.
"I was really delighted to come away with
two wins," Forood said. "To come out of the
weekend with two wins, where we're at right
now, was a great thing."
After its successful Pac-10 opener against
these two SoCal schools, Stanford travels to the
desert this weekend to face off against Arizona
State and Arizona on Friday and Saturday.
"We're looking forward to going to Ari
zona." Forood said. "We still have a few things
that we're working through as a team, so it's
going to be challenging.The conditions are a lit
tle bit different, so we're going to have to be
sharp to have a successful weekend down
there."
