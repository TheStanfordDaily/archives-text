# Family, students leery of Zhou suicide motive
## Investigation remains unresolved even after toxicology results show lethal levels of over-the-counter drug 
### ARAM HUR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When toxicology results showed
last week that Mengyao"May"Zhou
had lethal levels of the sedative
diphenhydramine in her body at the
time of her death, the Santa Rosa Po
lice Department's "apparent sui
cide" assessment appeared to be val
idated. But for Zhou's family and
some in the Stanford community, the
cause of the 23-year old electrical en
gineering doctoral candidate's death
is far from certain.
A number of concerned students
say they consider the police depart
ment's initial appraisal of Zhou's
death as an "apparent suicide" pre
mature. Because of the cultural Mig
ma that accompanies suicide, many
have expressed discontent at the way
officials have handled the case.
"Even if there was the slight pos
sibility it was not suicide, the police
should have held off until they were
positive to avoid biasing the public
and traumatizing the parents," said
Daxia Ge, an electrical engineering
graduate student.

And after the recent toxicology
report, Zhou's father. Yitong Zhou,
expressed skepticism over whether
his daughter's drug overdose was
self-induced.
On his new Web site (www.
mayzhou.com), Zhou included a link
to a study by the National Center of
Biotechnology Information that not
only claims that diphenhydramine
related deaths in adults are "ex
tremely rare." but also suggests that
"pre-existing heart disease may pro
vide the necessary substrate for
lethal cases of diphenhydramine tox
icity."
While some dispute that the drug
overdose was the sole cause of
Zhou's death. Nora Cain, director of
the Stanford health library consult
ing service, said that frequent abuse
of diphenhydramine has led to its
classification as a suicide agent in
various circles.
"The Europeans market it as a
sleep aid. whereas in the U.S. it is
marketed for its antihistamine quali
ties." she said. "In Europe, they also
track it as an agent for suicide."
According to Wylie Tene, public

relations manager for the American
Foundation for Suicide Prevention,
"using medication overdose is not an
uncommon method for suicide."
"You can overdose on anything
from aspirin to prescription drugs,"
he said.
While Tene could not comment
on the exact number of past cases in
volving diphenhydramine, he did sa\
that "it is not one that 1 have seen fre
quently."
Given the ambiguity of diphenhy
dramine as evidence either for or
against suicide. Sergeant Lisa Banay
at of the Santa Rosa Police Depart
ment said that the police will contin
ue to investigate the circumstances
surrounding Zhou's death.
"The toxicology does not change
our investigation," Banayat said.
"We are still interviewing people
who had contact with her and inves
tigating different areas involved with
the investigation that will not stop
until we reach a conclusion and get
the rest of the doctor's reports back."
