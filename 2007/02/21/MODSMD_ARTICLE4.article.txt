# Aid to increase next year
## New financial aid program to target middle-income families 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University plans to announce sig
nificant revisions to the financial aid pro
gram today that will primarily focus on in
creasing the aid packages for "middle-in
come" families — those with combined
annual incomes ranging from $60,000 to
$135,000 — The Daily has learned.
Students who receive financial aid will
now be expected to borrow $2,000 in
loans annually as part of their aid pack
age. as opposed to the $3,500 expected
previously. The University will also re

duce the amount of home equity assessed
in calculating expected parental contribu
tions.
The real effect of these changes could
potentially amount to "four to five thou
sand dollars more" in scholarship funding
per year for students from the targeted
middle-income families, according to Di
rector of Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
"Beginning in 2007-2008, the financial
aid budget will be increased by $10 mil
lion to a total of $76 million," Cooper said.
"Of the $10 million, about $5 million will
be spent to compensate the tuition in
crease so family contributions stay con
stant. The rest of the $10 million we are
using this time around to target middle
income families. We don't want to be a
university where only the very poor and
very rich can afford."
While the decrease in expected loans

may impact students most directly, the re
vised method for calculating parental
contributions will considerably change
the figures families see in a letter every
year from the Financial Aid Office
(FAO). Currently, the cap for the value of
a family's home equity considered in fi
nancial aid package calculations is twice
the annual income of the family. Begin
ning next year, the cap will be 1.5 times
the annual combined income.
Because of the changes, a California
student whose family income is $103.0()()
will see a total increase of $4,000 in schol
arship funds, according to the FAO.
"Members of the administration and
certainly we in the financial aid office saw
this real issue of middle-income families
who are asked to pay $20,000 to $30,000 in
