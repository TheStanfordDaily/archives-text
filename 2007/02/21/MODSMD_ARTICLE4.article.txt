# Aid to increase next year
## New financial aid program to target middle-income families 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University plans to announce sig
nificant revisions to the financial aid pro
gram today that will primarily focus on in
creasing the aid packages for "middle-in
come" families — those with combined
annual incomes ranging from $60,000 to
$135,000 — The Daily has learned.
Students who receive financial aid will
now be expected to borrow $2,000 in
loans annually as part of their aid pack
age. as opposed to the $3,500 expected
previously. The University will also re

duce the amount of home equity assessed
in calculating expected parental contribu
tions.
The real effect of these changes could
potentially amount to "four to five thou
sand dollars more" in scholarship funding
per year for students from the targeted
middle-income families, according to Di
rector of Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
"Beginning in 2007-2008, the financial
aid budget will be increased by $10 mil
lion to a total of $76 million," Cooper said.
"Of the $10 million, about $5 million will
be spent to compensate the tuition in
crease so family contributions stay con
stant. The rest of the $10 million we are
using this time around to target middle
income families. We don't want to be a
university where only the very poor and
very rich can afford."
While the decrease in expected loans

may impact students most directly, the re
vised method for calculating parental
contributions will considerably change
the figures families see in a letter every
year from the Financial Aid Office
(FAO). Currently, the cap for the value of
a family's home equity considered in fi
nancial aid package calculations is twice
the annual income of the family. Begin
ning next year, the cap will be 1.5 times
the annual combined income.
Because of the changes, a California
student whose family income is $103.0()()
will see a total increase of $4,000 in schol
arship funds, according to the FAO.
"Members of the administration and
certainly we in the financial aid office saw
this real issue of middle-income families
who are asked to pay $20,000 to $30,000 in
their expected parent contribution,"
Cooper said. "This $5 million cer
tainly isn't going to make it free for
everyone, and we know we ask for a
substantial commitment from fami
lies when they send their child to
Stanford."
According to Cooper, the Uni
versity has been considering ways to
revise the aid structure to address
the middle-income bracket for the
past three years.The Provost's office
conducted a random opinion survey
of the families of juniors and seniors
during the fall of 2006. which asked
parents to assess whether a Stanford
education was worth the high costs.
The feedback from middle-income
families, according to Cooper, was
"very significant."
"We had been thinking about this
for years but the survey was one of
the pieces that sort of broke the
camel's back," Cooper said. "We
heard loud and clear from certain
families in that bracket that they
were finding it difficult to finance a
Stanford education, and that is why
we decided to act now and not put it
off any longer."
The move appears to be the latest
step in a bottom-lip long-term over
haul of Stanford's financial aid pro
gram, and comes roughly two years
after President John Hennessy de
clared in the spring of 2005 that the
University would work toward elim
inating parental contribution for
low-income families.
"From its earliest days. Stanford
has had equal commitments to ex
cellence and ensuring access to stu
dents from the widest variety of
backgrounds and circumstances,"
Hennessy said at the time. "Having a
student body from diverse economic
backgrounds benefits not just the
students who receive financial aid.
but also the entire student body —
enhancing their academic experi
ence and broadening their world
view."
That goal became reality last
March, when the University an
nounced that it would completely
eliminate expected parental contri
butions for Stanford families with
combined incomes of less than
$45,000. as well as halve expected
parental contributions for families
with combined incomes between
$45.(XX) and $60,000. The program is
estimated to cost the University $3.1
million in the current academic year,
the first year of its implementation.
In evaluating the program
changes in the six months that have
passed. Cooper expressed confi
dence that a number of families are
benefiting in real economic terms.

"Before we implemented the new
policy, there were a group of families
who were expected to contribute
under our old policy," she said.
"Those students were ending up
back in our office during the year be
cause they couldn't get even that
modest amount and were taking on
loans to make up that shortfall. We
basically doubled our number of stu
dents who have zero parental contri
butions."
Cooper acknowledged that the
number of students affected by the
$45,000 threshold may be small and
its implementation meant "business
as usual" for many families.The sym
bolism of the move — and staying
on par with similar-profile institu
tions — has been perhaps the more
significant motivation.
"What we liked so much about
the message was that it's a clear mes
sage for low-income families to un
derstand," Cooper said. "One of the
things we get accused of from the
public is being complicated and
complex and that scares people
away from high-cost institutions.The
goal of financial aid is to ensure that
anyone who is admitted can handle
it financially."
Although the University has
made progress in expanding aid for
both low-and middle-income fami
lies, Cooper maintains that the work
is not yet finished.
"Stanford's financial aid program
is extremely competitive and there
are a very small number of schools
— Harvard, Yale, MIT — that you
can compare us to," she said."Unfor
tunately there are schools like
Princeton, which has a legendary aid
program that we simply can't match
yet."
The sources of the additional $10
million include specifically gifted en
dowments for financial aid, the Stan
ford Fund and the University's gen
eral operating budget. Pledges re
ceived from 200()'s $1 billion Cam
paign for Undergraduate Education
have also been allocated to financial
aid, and the recent successes of Stan
ford's institutional investments have
provided greater budgetary flexibili
ty-
Each year, the FAO receives ap
proximately 4,000 applications for
aid, and approximately 2,700 under
graduates are currently receiving fi
nancial aid. The overwhelming ma
jority of these students come from
families with a combined annual in
come below $130,000, according to
the FAO's estimations.
The Board of Trustees approved
a 5.46 percent tuition hike on Feb.
13. bringing the total expected stu
dent cost, including room and board,
for the next academic year to
$48,938.
