## Study investigates autism's onset Researchers find genetic basis in disorder's origin 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
In an article released in "Nature Ge
netics" earlier this week, several top re
searchers reported that they have located
genes partly responsible for the onset of
autism.
Led by Stanford's Joachim Hallmayer.
an associate professor for research in psy
chiatry and the behavioral sciences at the
School of Medicine, the Autism Genome
Project Consortium announced that it
had discovered some of the genetic roots
for the neurological developmental disor
der in the first part of its project to study
the condition.

"lt's one step forward," Hallmayer
said in an interview with Ilie Daily.
According to information posted by
the Autism Center at the University of
Washington — which contributed to the
study — on its Web site, autism occurs in
approximately one in Ib 7 people and is
more common than childhood cancer.
For scientists studying the basis of neu
rological disorders like autism, the nature
versus nurture debate became cloudy
years ago. Disorders like depression and
autism, which were once assumed to be
the produti ot purely environmental lac
tors, are now known to have some root in
genetics.
"Genetics was not considered at the
forefront [of autism research] until the
1c)705,"l c )70s," I lallmayersaid."Then,basically in
the late 1980s, it became possible to map
genes."
Fast forward to 2(M)7. After decades of
small-scale studies into the genetic origins

of autism, including an early Stanford ef
fort, the Autism Genome Project Consor
tium has finally made headway. After
pooling data on 1.1 f>S families, which was
collected by 120 scientists from 50 institu
tions, the research effort has found signif
icant evidence that supports a genetic
basis for the disorder.
"This [studyj' s the most ambitious ef
fort yet to find the locations of genes that
may confer vulnerability to autism." Na
tional Institute of Health (Nil I) Director
I - lias A. Zerhouni said in a press release.
Ilie scope of the effort required a great
deal of collaboration from a number of
organizations and governmental institu
tions dedicated to autism research. Hall
mayer estimated the study's price tag to
be around $2 million.
"It's a major breakthrough that we all
worked together." he said. "I think it's im-
portant that the field realizes that
we cannot go on with these little
small studies."
Hallmayer attributed the study's
initial success to its wide range of
talent.
"This is unique," he said. "(The
study's authors are] basically the en
tire field of autism genetics."
The study presented several key
genetic findings linked to the disor
der. It concluded that a gene on
Chromosome 11 may contribute to
the onset of autism, that neuronal
cell surface proteins called neurex
ins — which are linked to the prop
er development of glutamate neu
rons in the brain — may also play a
role and that abnormally high num
bers of copy variations, or changes in
the genetic material, may be partial
ly responsible.
I lallmayer said that although the
study provided researchers with
many new and important clues into
better understanding autism, new
treatments for the disorder would
likely not be immediately forthcom
ing.
"Clinically, this will take a while."
he said. "The next step will be to de
velop models. In science, you can
never predict anything."
According to I lallmayer, the sec
ond phase of the Autism Genome
Project will continue to build on the
recently published work and will ex
pand the genetic analysis in both
scope and detail.
The study will pursue five av
enues of research: small-scale ge
netic mapping efforts that target
particular regions of the genome,
whole genome association studies,
phenotypic examination of autism
families, further work on Copy
Number Variation and in-depth
analyses of candidate genes in af
fected families.
Hallmayer expressed doubts,
however, that even this additional
work will lead to new treatments
that directly benefit autism patients
in the near future.
"I have grave doubts that these
genetics can be translated into diag
nostic information," he said. "[But]
it's very difficult to study this with
out knowing the uenes."
