Feb. 21,1984:
"According to a recent survey of
Stanford students' drinking habits,
one out of every two students drinks
alcohol at least once a week, and one
out of l() students drinks even more
often.
"Despite these statistics, Robin
Hensley, assistant program director
for Residential Education, told The
Daily Thursday that 'there is a major
increase in alcohol awareness this
year.' and that Residential Educa
tion's de-emphasis on alcohol has mi
proved the student drinkingsituation."
"However, Mark Mancall, Flo
rence Moore resident fellow.docs not
think the increased alcohol aware
ness is due to Res Ed's alcohol policy.
Instead, he said it reflects a change in
the public mood, and that Res I d's
policy stems from this change.
" I think it (drinking) is out of
style.' Mancall said.'Hopefully it will
stay out of style. I think it's the func
tion of Res Ed to convey that.""
