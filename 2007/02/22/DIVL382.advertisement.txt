(23-3,12-2 Pac-10)
Los Angeles
NOTES: After sweeping the Oregon
schools last weekend at home, the
Cardinal hit the road to face the Los
Angeles schools. USC is up first and
UCLA follows on Saturday. UCLA has
won its last 18 games at home, in
cluding its last 12 Pac-10 games. Pos
sibly giving the Bruins a little bit of in
spiration, the 1967 Championship
UCLA team will be honored at half
time. Already fueling the Bruins is their
shocking 75-68 upset loss at Stanford.
The Cardinal are 5-3 vs. ranked op
ponents in 2006-07 with wins over
then-No. 24 Washington, then-No.
23 Washington State, then-No. 25
USC, then-No. 3 UCLA and then-
No. 15 Oregon.
