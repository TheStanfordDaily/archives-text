"The 22-1 men's basketball team
climbed to #1 in the country after a
101-50 rout of rival California.
The Cardinal outshot, outre
bounded, outhustled. and out
thought the overmatched Golder
Bears (14-10. 5-7) in what has be
come an increasingly lopsided se
ries. Stanford has won the last seven
against Cal.
'Well, that was pretty good.' head
coach Mike Montgomery said in his
usual understated tone. 'We can't
play a lot better than that.'
That's probably true. The Cardi
nal shot almost 65 percent from the
field and hit 50 percent of its three
point shots. Five Stanford players
scored in double figures as the team
piled up 2ti assists and outrebound
ed Cal by 15.
But senior guard David Moseley.
who blistered Cal for a career-high
28 points in a shockingly efficient
performance, refused to admit that
Stanford, now in the midst of a 10-
game winning streak, had maxed
out its potential.
'If we could do this every night,
it'd be fun,' he said. But.'we're not
even close to where we want to be.'"
The Cardinal would finish as the
Pac-10 champions with a 31-3
record.
