## Kennedy combats mental illness Representatives propound parity bill 
### KAYLIN PENNINGTON 
Congressmen Patrick Kennedy
(D-Rl) and Jim Ramstad (R-MN)
discussed mental health and the
stigma associated with mental ill
ness with a small group of students
and community members gathered
inTresidder Union's Cypress Room
South yesterday afternoon.
Kennedy spoke frankly about his
personal experience with alcohol ad
diction in order to illustrate how so
ciety might eliminate the social stig
ma attached to mental health issues.
In 2006 Kennedy was implicated
in a drunk driving accident which
prompted criticism from political
opponents and made him a punch
line on late night talk shows. But he
noted that the ensuing media storm,
which thrust his personal problems
into the limelight and sent him into
rehab, helped initiate dialogue
among his constituents about men
tal health and addiction.
"The American people are way
ahead of where we think they are,"
Kennedy said, citing the fact that he
won reelection in his congressional
district after the 2006 incident with
69 percent of the popular vote. It was
the largest margin of his 12-year ca
reer in the I louse of Representatives.
Ramstad and Kennedy, who
stopped by Stanford after a public
hearing in Redwood City as part of
a nationwide tour to gain support

for mental health legislation, say
they firmly believe that health insur
ers should cover mental illness at
the same level as they cover physical
illness.
Both congressmen spoke frankly
about their own struggles with alco
hol and drug addiction, and how they
both believe they were able to get the
necessary treatment because of the
exhaustive health insurance provid
ed to members of Congress.They are
concerned, though, that most insur
ance companies ignore issues of par
ity when it comes to mental illness.
According to Ramstad, who is
Kennedy's Alcoholics Anonymous
sponsor, 54 million Americans suffer

from mental illness and many are un
willing or unable to seek help because
insurance companies set lower reim
bursement. Co-payments and de
ductibles for mental illnesses, in addi
tion to limiting visits to physicians.
Calling mental illness "our
largest public health problem."
Ramstad said that a mental health
parity bill would "increase [insur
ance] premiums by 7<S cents per
month in the worst case scenario."
Kennedy, the son of Sen. I dvvard
Kennedy (D-MA) and the nephew
of former President John F.
Kennedy, added that the National
Institutes of Health (Nil!) "spends

Both men said they believe their bill
is the "floor, not the ceiling" of any

mental illness.

"This bill is about civil rights
more than public health." Kennedy

with Kennedy's categorization of
the parity issue as primarily a civil

reduction of the existing mental

De Los Angeles said he was sur
