## Stem cell research gets a boost Stanford is top recipient of state agency funds 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stem cell researchers at the I 'Diver
sity are talking about their plans after
Stanford received 12 grants, worth
about $K million in funding, last Friday
from a state-sponsored institute.
ITie California Institute for Regen
erative Medicine (C'IRM) announced it
will support $45 million in stem cell re
search by funding 72 grants over two
years.This comes after a voter approved
ballot proposition in 2(M)4, which sup
ported state-funded stem cell research.
Faculty receiving grants expressed
pleasure with CIRM's recognition of
their projects as important research.

"C'IRM funding is stimulating a new
set of researchers to work on human em
bryonic stem cells, in hopes of devising
therapies for numerous medical disor
ders that include Parkinson's and other
neurodegenerative diseases." said Bio
logical Sciences Prof. Susan McConnell.

Stanford labs and faculty received $8 million in grants to develop stem

scientists," said Sage, who will be in
vestigating the basic mechanisms
that govern the proliferation and the
differentiation of hESCs with a
CIRM grant.
Pediatrics Prof. Kenneth Wein
berg, who will be investigating the
development of the thymus from
ESCs with his grant, noted that since
CIRM was established by Proposi
tion 71. the California Stem Cell Re
search and Cures Initiative, he feels
"a more personal connection with
the funding and a heightened sense
of responsibility for stewardship of
the project."
"It's really wonderful to see Stan
ford and our state take the lead in an
important endeavor that I hope will
set a research agenda for the rest of
the country." Weinberg said.
kovacs echoed his sentiments.
"The great thing about the CIRM
funding process is that we — the
community — have been able to go
from vote to funds in a relatively
short period of time," he said. "This
will hopefully demonstrate a new ap
proach to state level, rapid thrusts
into timely or controversial scientific
areas of great importance."
Joseph Wu. assistant professor of
medicine and radiology, will use the
CIRM funding for his lab's inquiries
into to the fundamental biology of
hESCs, namely survival, differentia
tion and teratoma formation. Wu ap
plauded Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger, who handed out

the grants in Burlingame last week,
and the people of California for their
"courage and foresight" as leaders in
the stem cell research arena.
"This is the right way to proceed
in stem cell research — to bypass the
partisan politics and focus on the sci
ence — because 1 think it'll be a long
way before we understand enough
about ES cell biology and feel safe
and confident to translate to clinical
studies" Wu said.
Phillip Yang, assistant professor
of medicine, described California's
stem cell research efforts as "un
precedented."
"We all aspire to be responsive to
the initiatives set forth by CIRM.
which is to cure and treat the people
suffering from devastating diseases
through regenerative medicine,"
said Yang, who hopes to one day
translate his CIRM-funded research
into human clinical trials.
The CI KM monies will be used to
fund a variety of innovative projects.
"I am hoping that my research
will advance our knowledge of fun
damental mechanisms underlying
pluripotency of hESCs." said Joanna
Wysocka, assistant professor of
chemical and systems biology, who
received a CIRM gnint after having
been at Stanford for less than six
months. "I feel that basic research is
needed in order to better understand
these unique properties and to bring
ESCs into the realm of therapeutics,
particularly in the area of directed
differentiation and epigenetic repro
gramming."
With the aid of a CIRM grant,
McConnell will be exploring the
basic biological properties of
dopaminergic neurons that are de

rived from hESCs to assess how use
ful they might be in future transplan
tation therapy.
Calvin Kuo, assistant professor of
medicine, will use a newly developed
tissue culture system to influence
human embryonic stem cells to be
come intestinal cells, which would
further the development of regener
ative therapies for certain medical
conditions.
"Regeneration of the intestine,or
even construction of artificial intes
tine. would be desirable in diseases,
such as Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative
Colitis, congenital short gut syn
dromes or traumatic intestinal in
jury." he said.
Kovacs's CIRM funding will
allow him to study the viability of
stem cell repair for heart muscle
that may have been damaged by
myocardial infarction or other dis
orders.
"We will grow a population of
heart cells on a tiny array of electri
cal contacts and record their beating
patterns," Kovacs said. "After these
host cells are established, we will
allow a separate population of stem
cells to grow into them and. using the
same type of electrical contacts, de
termine if the stem cells are becom
ing functionally connected or not.
With such a tool, we will be able to
assess a variety of different stem cell
repair approaches, including drugs
that may help the process along. Our
goal is to make this technology avail
able to the growing community who
wish to explore using stem cells to
fight heart disease."
