Stem cell researchers at the I 'Diver
sity are talking about their plans after
Stanford received 12 grants, worth
about $K million in funding, last Friday
from a state-sponsored institute.
ITie California Institute for Regen
erative Medicine (C'IRM) announced it
will support $45 million in stem cell re
search by funding 72 grants over two
years.This comes after a voter approved
ballot proposition in 2(M)4, which sup
ported state-funded stem cell research.
Faculty receiving grants expressed
pleasure with CIRM's recognition of
their projects as important research.

"C'IRM funding is stimulating a new
set of researchers to work on human em
bryonic stem cells, in hopes of devising
therapies for numerous medical disor
ders that include Parkinson's and other
neurodegenerative diseases." said Bio
