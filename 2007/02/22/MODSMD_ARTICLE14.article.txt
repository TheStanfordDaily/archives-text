# Tree hopefuls paintballed
## Candidates carry out shenanigans in White Plaza 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
"I think I'm bleeding a little," said For
rest White '10, clad in a Speedo.
White and his Junipero dormmate John
Whipple '10, both Tree candidates, per
formed a stunt on the lawn between Dinkel
spiel Auditorium and Old Union yesterday.
Taking inspiration from the Nintendo
"Duck Hunt" game, the two candidates
were "scared" into play by a supporter in a
dog costume.

Tommy Lcep'o7 — the current manifes
tation of the Stanford Tree — was present
ed with a paintball gun and instructed to
shoot the students running across the lawn
flapping their arms. When Leep eliminated
each of the runners, the Tree candidates pre
sented their elder with gifts, ranging from a
Bacardi baseball cap to a handful of con
doms to a bottle of tequila.
White was hit five times during the stunt
— at least one of which, apparently, drew
blood.
The Tree is the unofficial mascot of the
University and the official mascot of the
Stanford Band. It drew national attention
last February when then-Tree F.rin 1 ash nits
'05 was discovered by UC-Berkeley
Athletic Department officials to be
intoxicated during a men's basket
ball game.
White and Whipple are cam
paigning together, explaining that
the unorthodox strategy increases
their likelihood of winning.
"We inspire each other," Whipple
said. "We're helping each other out."
"If either of us is the Tree, we've
got that for the rest of our time at
Stanford," White added. "I think it
would be a really cool way to get in
volved with the Band, especially be
cause 1 don't play an instrument."
Whipple is in the midst of plan
ning a stunt in White Plaza, sched
uled for noon on Friday.
Kvle Owen TO, another Tree can

didate, announced to his facebook
group "Kyle Owen for Tree" that he
is planning a stunt for today at noon,
also in White Plaza.
To publicize her Tree candidacy.
Meagan Moroney '10 put up a
Christmas tree with a sign reading
"Meagan 4 Tree" on the "Intersec
tion of Death" roundabout.
Tree candidates have the rest of
the week to perform stunts designed
to impress a Tree selection commit
tee consisting of the current and for
mer Trees as well as the Dollies and
other undisclosed members. The
stunts are optional.
"There's no pressure to do the
stunts" White said. "But it's highly
recommended."
Strategic bribes and an interview
with the committee are also part ot
the secretive process.The committee
will name the new Tree next week.
