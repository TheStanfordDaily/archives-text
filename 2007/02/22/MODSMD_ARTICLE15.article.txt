# STUDENT LIFE
## Flu prevention prioritized Housing and Vaden take precautionary measures 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Following last year's episode of"Toyon
ic Plague," Residential and Dining Enter
prises (R&DE), in conjunction with Vaden
I lealth Center, has launched a program (his
year in hopes that new proactive measures
will more effectively combat the potential
spread of contagious viruses.
R&DE has worked closely with Vaden
to identify and treat student illnesses. Vaden
tracks campus illnesses through the Peer
Health Educators (PHEs) who live in each

of the Stanford residences managed by the
Student I lousing division of R&DE.
Flu season in the U.S. typically ranges
from November to March,according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Preven
tion CDC), which warns on its Web site that
"flu season can begin as early as October
and last as late as May."
At the beginning of each academic year.
PHEs and housing supervisors put up flyers
in residence bathrooms and hallways. The
livers include information about symptoms
of different illnesses; it also urges students
to notify their PHEs if symptoms arise and
to visit Vaden for treatment if necessary.
"How do I keep others from getting
sick?"one such flyer reads."The close quar-
ters in residences help the bacteria
and viruses that cause the vomiting
and diarrhea to spread. Therefore it
is important that you tell your PHE
or RA right away."
This year, bathrooms were
stocked with Endbac disinfectant
spray, and clean-up kits with direc
tions and gloves were also provided
for students to use.
"I haven't noticed the flyers,"said
Rachel Ny'lo. "Even if I did. I would
most likely forget about using the
spray or the kits because it's time
consuming. I'd try to remember, but
it's immediately more convenient to
just leave [the bathroom]."
Ny. however, did heed the advice
of flyers in the dining halls remind
ing students to "clean your hands a
lot" and to use soap and water.
According to R&DE, this year
has seen a more positive response to
the hand sanitizers and wipes that
are available in the dining halls.
"I'm very pleased with the posi
tive student response to our hand
sanitizer and hand washing pro
gram." said Shirley Everett,associate
vice provost for R&DE. in an email
to The Daily. "It has become a posi
tive habit for many students in hous

ing and dining. Student Housing and
Stanford Dining have done a terrific
job partnering with Vaden and PHEs
to mitigate the spread of student ill
ness such as flu and norovirus."
R&DE, Vaden and the PHEs are
confident that their efforts will go a
long way toward stopping the spread
of a contagious disease should it sur
face on campus. Specifically, R&DE
says that a resurfacing of the
norovirus — which caused last
year's "Toyonic Plague" — would
be effectively contained.
"Vaden and R&DE have already
been acting on small clusters of this
disease to prevent its spread." said
Jamie Williams, director of market
ing and business support for R&DE
in an email to The Daily, 'it has been
an ongoing process and we believe
our protocols have helped to pre
vent larger outbreaks."
Ultimately, the program aims to
increase awareness among students
and to educate them about the pre
vention and treatment of contagious
diseases.
"Setting up the program was fo
cused on providing an essential serv
ice to Stanford students," Williams
said. "[lt is important] to educate
them about the spread of disease
and provide them with the tools to
keep healthy."
