# Opinions
## Your library personality 
### 
As much as I have repeatedly fallen
victim to the siren's call of procrasti
nation. I still try to resist the lure of
"Scrubs reruns, collage-making and vacu
uming. and go to the library. The library is
wonderful because it is noiseless, talk-less
and distraction-less— 1 am forced to focus
on the task at hand, a task whose due date is
most likely ominously near. However, de
spite the blank hard wood carrels and the
magazine-less desks, my mind inevitably
wanders oil. until I sheepishly catch it wast
ing mental energy and force it to concen
trate once again. But quite paradoxically, 1
start to wonder how it is that our brains
think about something else without us even
knowing, and how it is that we suddenly be
come aware that our thoughts are wander
ing.
Hie one other thing 1 do at the library —
besides trying to force myself to study, get
ting caught in a vicious meta-thought cycle
and maybe getting a book — is analyzing
and scrutinizing those around me. Three
years of one-room doubles and a personal
insistence on studying silence has made me
an ol' cowboy on the library round-up —
I 've seen em come and I've seen 'em go. and
more likely than not. I know your type all
too well. And whether you know it or not.
where you go and how you study says every
thing I need to know about you.
Let's start with the worst of all libraries:
the Art and Architecture Library. If you
study at the art history library it means one
ol two things: 1) you are crazy and uptight
and like studying in the worst library on
campus, or 2) you are an art history major,
which means you like memorizing endless
names, dates and titles and are probably a
little crazy because of it. Not only is the art
library completely non-circulating, but you
can only check out books for two hours at a
time, and. just I your I, someone is already
reading the one book you need. Always, no
matter what, even at S a.m. You'll contem
plate waiting out those two hours, but the art
history library is already sucking out your
spirit, minute by minute, and if you wait until
Lirsty McHaha finishes perusing and add
the two hours you will need to read the
damn book yourself, you're not sure if you
will ever get your groove back. Also there is
no food or even water allowed in the art his
tory library, and the stacks downstairs are
the crank-me-open. I could-get-squished
and-ki I led-in -here, was-the re-real ly-no
room-lor-shelves-when-they-bui I t-this
place kind.
In stark and utter contrast to the Art
Room of Doom, is the splendor that is the
Law Library of Love. Beautiful, new. er
gonomically correct chairs make Green's
aged wooden seats seem like eight-tracks.
You can get your own room which has help

ful, large white boards and the bonus of even
less noise. The Law Library is so good, in
fact, that undergrads had to be banned from
its walls during dead week and finals due to
overcrowding. The people know.
But then there are the people that don't
know.and they end up in Meyer. Since there
is no guard at Meyer's door, you can eat and
drink ad nauseum — but there are loud,
clanging doors, odd wind-tunnel sounds and
too many people in one big room to make
up for a couple of lattes. If you are in Meyer,
I hope for your sake it is because you are
quite literally addicted tocaffeinated bever
ages. just lost your ID card or are such a
super-procrastinator that there is no longer
any other study space open.
Because if none of those things are true,
you should be studying across the way at
Green, or Cecil, as I like to call her. Just past
the red. bent-toothbrushy-looking fountain
which I hated freshman year but now re
gard very affectionately — lies my home
away from home, the very mother of all
book-holding buildings. Not only is Moon
beans pleasantly located at its very gates, but
Green offers the world's greatest array of
study options. Need ultra-quiet? Go to a cu
bicle in the basement. Want to people
watch? Fry the Lane Reading Room. Itching
for a view? 'ITic Bender Room offers some
of the best vistas of Stanford's verdant cam
pus. II you are at Green,you are both serious
about studying but also hip to it — you
know what's what. It is at Green where you
run into people you know. You whisper a
quick convo, maybe even send an e-mail or
two about the unaware-of-own-humming
girl at the far table. There are comfortable
lounge chairs overlooking windows, group
tables, super-fast computers, a magical fish
clock — in sum.everything a girl could want
from a place of study.
Whether you are forced into the
Doom or waltz into Cecil, know that your
library of choice says a lot about you. It
reflects your interests and your procrasti
nation levels, your current lumbar
strength. And who knows, maybe as you
are reading about that little trav '«ng
goldfish, you might just bump into a .all.

ing the same thing, too.
