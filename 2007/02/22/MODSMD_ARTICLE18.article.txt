# How to survive a college theatrical production
## 
### 
A lot of my friends are theater people,
und thus I've been invited to go to
quite a few theatrical productions
on various college campuses. In retrospect. I
wish I had more friends who were adult film
stars. Subsequently, I vc observed some easy
ways to make the experience better for the
audience.
Immediately,college students think that
the best way to survive a production is to be
drunk. I think that's only fair at the Friday
night show, when you know the cast itself
has a higher blood alcohol level than you.
Personally, I have difficulty following the
plots of productions while sober, so Alter
ing my mind is only going to complicate
things. I have no idea why that person is
gesturing off stage, why every character is
now holding hands and bowing to us or
why people see anything written by Gilbert
and Sullivan.
People often talk of heckling, but that's
never really been my thing. I'll heckle art
that doesn't feature living people in front of
me trying their best. To tell someone who
put so many long hours into rehearsing that
he sucks is just really cruel.That's why I pre
fer the more humane tactic of beating up a
cape 11 a groups after their concerts. Come
on Testimony, quit shirking the challenge:
let's rumble.
My experience in heckling is usually lim
ited to media that demand passive interac
tion with the audience. This translates into
mocking something when I know they can't
hear me. At movies I fancy myself a bit of a
wit. I'm brutal at zoos (especially to those
no-talent penguins), and I'm terribly clever
when I watch filmed lectures alone in my
room.
Inevitably, I always know at least a few
people in the chorus. Unavoidably, in these
big ensemble musicals, there are lots of huge
stumbling numbers. When the entire chorus
comes on for one of the big opening num
bers which may have it reprise in the closing
number. I don't try to make out the words.

This will only bring you pain and misinter
pretation: Did they just say they wanted to
go back to "Smoklohatna?" Most choruses
comprise of everyone involved in the pro
duction. I lie leads, the set people and even
the janitor can usually be spotted mimicking
the motions of the chorus as they all belt out
lyrics as articulately as Joe Biden rapping.
Foreign films have subtitles, so why can't
large college musical numbers?
My best advice is to just let the sweet off
key song pass over you like a warm blanket.
Don't interpret the words; the song isn't
there to further the plot. I know I won't have
this many smiling people in front of me
somewhat rhythmically dancing until 1 form
that B-52s cover band.
I have a reputation as a harsh critic of cul
ture, which is a reputation this column
seems to reinforce. But really, my own be
havior is much more mild-mannered. I usu
ally am really personable and even overly
laudatory in real life. I 'm so willing to please
I have difficulty saying no to people; this is
why I ended up on yearbook my freshman
year or voted in any election.
It's good to be able to see the positive be
cause I'm often asked what I think of stu
dent written, directed and choreographed
pieces. You can't say "That was awesome.
Was this your first time directing?" Or "I
haven't seen an effort this adorable since
middle school." Instead you concentrate on
the positives. Ihe lighting. ITiis typo-less
program. It was shorter than you thought it


Holt
Holt's Harangue
would be.
I asked my theater friends what
else I don't notice as a member of
the audience.They explain that the
atrical productions have more
drama than a Mormon temple in
the Castro district. There is always
sexual tension within the cast of
these productions; people hook up
with one another and tempers flair.
I'm never perceptive enough to
know the gossip,so I'll accidentally
compliment someone else who has
just dumped the person I'm talking
to. "Oh Chris, v*>u'd think that was

a good performance. But you
haven't seen him say that he loves
you." I really feel like having pro
duction notes on who is hooking up
with whom would make the audi
ence's job a lot easier. That way I
can intentionally screw with my
high-strung theater friends.
Well, with winter and spring pro
ductions on the horizon. I'm looking
forward to seeing the best that moti
vated. talented Stanford students
have to offer.That's why I'm going to
the basketball games instead.

Chris respectfully thanks his friends
for the help he received on this col
umn. He is actually a patron of Stan
ford theater, so don't ask him what he
thinks of it. Send complaints to
cholt^Pstanford.edu.
