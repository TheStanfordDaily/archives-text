# ROAD TO GLORY
## Card must come out strong against Trojans 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford learned this week that "old man"
Fred Washington will return next season after
gaining an extra year of eligibility from an in
jury hardship waiver. But with its sights sot
squarely on Southern California this week, the
Cardinal will need the senior forwards aggres
siveness now more than ever.
"His intensity and desire you can see from
watching games." sophomore guard Mitch John
son said. "He's been there before."
Stanford (17-8, 9-5 Pacific-10 Conference)
heads to (JSC tonight tied with the Trojans for
third in the Pac-10 standings and looking to im
prove its play on the road. For its part, USC (19-8,
9-5) will seek to avenge last month's 65-50 defeat
at Maples Pavilion, as well as last week's 68-58
upset loss at Arizona State.
"Theoretically,teams play better at home than
they do on the road." Stanford head coach Trent
Johnson said. "This is a team that, much like us.

has a lot to play for at this time."
"They'll probably be even hungrier to get this
game against us." added Washington, a Los Ange
les native who said he enjoys playing at home.
Enjoyable or not. the Cardinal knows it must
come out strong against a Trojan team with re
venge on its mind and a 13-3 record at home.
"It's different this time around,playing there,"
sophomore forward Lawrence Hill said. "We
were able to play well at home; we can't count on
that on the road. They're going to be comfortable
and come on the attack."
Stanford has a 5-3 road record on the season
but has dropped two of its last three away from
Maples.
"Our away games are going to be important,"
Hill said. "We blew some at Washington, and we
lost one at Arizona, so we have to come and play
just like it was our home game."
11 ill. who leads Stanford with 15.4 points and
6.1 rebounds per game away from Stanford, at
tributed the recent road woes to a lack of energy
against teams that the Cardinal had previously
beaten at home.
"We were very lackadaisical," he said. "[The
Washington schools] came onto our court and we
were the aggressors. Then, we thought we could
be the aggressors without actually doing it."
But Johnson said his players were being too
hard on themselves.
"We just ran into two teams that were better
than we were." he said."lt's hard for everybody to
understand that, but they were."
"If we defend, rebound and take care of the
ball, we have a chance to beat anybody." he said.
"II we don't do all facets of those three things,
then we're going to struggle, and that has nothing


Senior forward Fred Washington knows
that (JSC will be hungry for a win
tonight on its home court. Stanford

score of 65-50. Things may get

we do.'" , ...

one-on-one. . .
Stanford's defense had a field day with USC s isolation
offense the last time the two met, blocking a school-record
19 shots. Freshman forward Brook Lopez had Stanford's
first recorded triple-double with 18 points, 11 rebounds and
a school-record 12 blocks.
But Johnson said he didn't expect USC to change its ap
proach.
"Well, 1 don't know why they would, he said. "They
won their share of games in their system. 1 expect them to
do what they've been doing all year long...They are who
they are."
Stanford will again be without sophomore guard An
thony Goods, who is nursing a high ankle sprain. Goods is
currently wearing a protective boot and will be reevaluat
ed next week after the boot is removed. Johnson said.
Likely to be without Goods for its four remaining con
ference games, Stanford's locus hasn't changed — the Pac
-10 tournament and a N( AA berth.
Asked how many more wins the team needed. Hill was
candid.
"We'd like to have four," he said.
