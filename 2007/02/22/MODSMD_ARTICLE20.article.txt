# Self-Realization by 900 numbers

### 
It looked like it would be a summer like
all the rest. Afternoons spent outside
with friends, gaily tossing Frisbees to and
fro while happily roasting decaying animal
tlesh in the cool Jersey air.
But as the summer began to approach
quickly I began to realize something: I had no
job.
And I had honestly tried. I made innumer
able trips to Kinko's to put my internship ap
plications on the just-perfect, professional
looking. 12-cent bonded paper. Hut nothing
materialized.except for this thing at Playboy,
and. well, let's just say it didn 't pay.
Hut the time school got out in June, my
odds of landing a prestigious mall job were
lower than my junior-high-school-aged sis
ter's. And even though she was at sleep-away

camp, the depression-era competition was
still way too stiff.
It looked like I would be doing what every
other rich, privileged, 1-don't-know-how
much-room-and-board-is-because-I-just-
send-the-bill-home-to-my-parents Stanford
student experiences during the summer.
It looked like I would be working for my dad.
I pictured walking into the office, with my

long hair and undeserved upper-echelon
telemarketing job and seeing all the secre
taries in their make-up splattered spandex
concoctions which they call style. And I
would know what was going on in their
minds. Its the boss' son. That's why he got the
Jon. He can get away with whatever he wants,
(â€¢yen that awful haircut. I say we hang him,
then we tar and feather him and then we make
htm our personal sexual slave...
But then just when it seemed like the fan
tasy was picking up. I noticed a sign on the
tront door of The Daily office:
Internship available in Paradise, CA.
C ontact Communication Department for de
tails.
