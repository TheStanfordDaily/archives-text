# Self-Realization by 900 numbers
## 
### 
It looked like it would be a summer like
all the rest. Afternoons spent outside
with friends, gaily tossing Frisbees to and
fro while happily roasting decaying animal
tlesh in the cool Jersey air.
But as the summer began to approach
quickly I began to realize something: I had no
job.
And I had honestly tried. I made innumer
able trips to Kinko's to put my internship ap
plications on the just-perfect, professional
looking. 12-cent bonded paper. Hut nothing
materialized.except for this thing at Playboy,
and. well, let's just say it didn 't pay.
Hut the time school got out in June, my
odds of landing a prestigious mall job were
lower than my junior-high-school-aged sis
ter's. And even though she was at sleep-away

camp, the depression-era competition was
still way too stiff.
It looked like I would be doing what every
other rich, privileged, 1-don't-know-how
much-room-and-board-is-because-I-just-
send-the-bill-home-to-my-parents Stanford
student experiences during the summer.
It looked like I would be working for my dad.
I pictured walking into the office, with my

long hair and undeserved upper-echelon
telemarketing job and seeing all the secre
taries in their make-up splattered spandex
concoctions which they call style. And I
would know what was going on in their
minds. Its the boss' son. That's why he got the
Jon. He can get away with whatever he wants,
(•yen that awful haircut. I say we hang him,
then we tar and feather him and then we make
htm our personal sexual slave...
But then just when it seemed like the fan
tasy was picking up. I noticed a sign on the
tront door of The Daily office:
Internship available in Paradise, CA.
C ontact Communication Department for de
tails.

Paradise. It sounded so beautiful.
So angelic. So far away from my new
spandex dominatrices in Jersey City.
This would mean not seeing all
my high school friends. TTiis would
mean not seeing my family. This
would mean not seeing that guy on
the corner of 38th and Lex. who does
that cool thing with the roach clips
and the pigeons.
But 1 was growing up and I had to
put all of that behind me. Or at least
in Paradise.
So with two weeks left before fi
nals. 1 packed up my pillow, blanket.
Interplak toothbrush, mint-flavored,
unwaxed dental floss and my Act
Dental Rinse and headed out to be a
new reporter for Paradise.
Driving towards my new Chico
home that 1 had located through a
want-ad in a local newspaper. 1 epi
phonized that as nervous as 1 was. 1
was finally free. / made out the check
for my new apartment. I would pay
for everything with the money 1 was
making. And / would be the one re
sponsible for remembering to put
the Snack Pack in my lunch box.
And the freedom was going to
take place in Chico — a town ruled
and controlled by the top-rated
party school in the nation, according
to Playboy magazine. The revenge
on my bunny-clad friends seemed
too perfect.

But as 1 pulled over to ask three
large, hare-chested, drunken males
where my apartment was. and they
informed me that 1 lived in a com
plex widely-known as 'The Zoo." 1
found myself forced to question my
freedom.
Laying myself down on my
lumpy. Budweiser-sheeted mattres
(They left off the extra "s" for sav
ings), cuddled up with my Interplak
and copy of "Being and Nothing
ness." 1 discovered that I was very
lonely.
There were no dormmates, no
one to tuck me in at night, no one to
play knick-knack on my knees with.
Eventually 1 made friends, and 1
cooked tofu and zucchini ad infini
tum. and by the second week 1 had
built my own little post-5 p.m. niche
in life.
But no matter how much fun I
was having in my self-imposed pseu
do-adult asylum. 1 couldn't avoid the
nagging realization that life outside
this hollow shell of love that we call
college is a bit lonely. Every so often,
late at night, 1 would find myself
furtively glancing at the phone
whenever the 900 number flashed on
my screen and thai seemingly omnis
cient blonde woman with the half
unbuttoned blouse would say, "Go
ahead. 1 think you'll be glad you
did."
But, luckily, I'm more scared of
not graduation.
