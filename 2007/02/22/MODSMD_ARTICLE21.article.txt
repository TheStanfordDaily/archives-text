## GSC rejects special fees offerings Controversy over News Readership Program 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Elections season was already in
full swing at the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) meeting last night.
Much of the two-hour meeting fo
cused on the upcoming spring elec
tions. including issues such as special
fees, voter turnout and the Go-Pass.
The GSC failed to approve two
special fees proposals involving
newspapers, one of which was the
News Readership Program.
Several members appeared
swayed by the objections raised by
GSB student Rebecca Kaplan, who
said she had organized something
similar to the News Readership Pro
gram at Yale.
"I'm totally against it." Kaplan
said. "This is not how it should work.
The New York Times is using the stu
dent government to increase its na
tionwide circulation."
No representative from the pro
gram was present to respond, but
other GSC members said that Stan
ford works differently than its peer in
stitutions and that some special fees
take the place of University initiatives.
"Stanford doesn't make line

items out of a lot of things that other
Universities do." said Cullen Buie, a
GSC member and mechanical engi
neering graduate student.
Ultimately, the vote to put the
News Readership Program on the
spring ballot for special fees fell one
short of the two-thirds needed. The
program must now petition to be put
on the ballot.
The GSC also rejected a special
fees proposal from The Daily. ITie
Undergraduate Senate previously
denied The Daily's request on Tues
day. The Daily — which must have
the approval of both bodies to be put
on the ballot — also has the option
to petition with student signatures.
Members also expressed concern
that the ASSU Elections Commis
sion was not doing enough to pro
mote potential candidates and voter
turnout in the graduate community.
"What is the elections commis
sion doing to make sure we get
enough candidates?" GSC co-Chair
Jenny Allen JD '07 asked Assistant
Elections Commissioner Kaeche
Liburd '07.
There appeared to be some dis
agreement over how much attention
the Elections Commission is re
quired to give the graduate commu
nity. According to GSC Funding
Committee Chair Adam Beberg. the
amount the GSC gives the commis
sion was increased this year "specifi

cally for efforts to increase graduate
voter turnout."
It was not clear if Liburd was
aware of the stipulation the C»SC put
on the additional funding.
The GSC also received an update
about the Go-Pass program, which
organizers say is not doing as well as
expected. Only 415 of the subsidized
CalTrain passes have been sold so
far. out of an available 3,500.
"That number is OK. but not
great," said physics graduate student
Martin Mueller, who is on the Grad
uate Student Transportation Board
— which is managing the Go-Pass
program.
At this point last year. 1.000 pass
es had been sold, according to Be
berg.
In other news, the GSC also
tabled a Sweat Free Stanford bill for
another week to allow the proposal's
backers to change some of the word
ing to make it more accurate.
However, council members did
unanimously pass a bill that will
allow students to use the ASSU's
Legal Counseling Office (LCO) in
cases where they may have a legal
dispute with the University. Current
ly. ASSU by-laws do not allow the
LCO to give advice to students in
cases that involve the University.
