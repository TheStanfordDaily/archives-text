# Men's volleyball to face No. 1 Pepperdine
## 
### ROXIE DICKINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alter experiencing two close
matches against UCLA and UC-
Irvine at home last weekend, the
Stanford men's volleyball team is
now down in Southern California to
face No. I Pepperdine today and No.
14 Southern California tomorrow.
Last week, the Cardinal lost to
Irvine in three games (30-27. 30-22,
30-20) and lost to UCLA in four
games (30-28,23-30,19-30,22-30). In
week seven of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPS! ) Confer
ence, Stanford looks to gain at least
another win to improve its record of
1-15,1-10 MPSF.
The Cardinal again played with
visible energy last week, making
each team work for its victory.
Against Irvine, both teams accrued
many serving errors. But Stanford
was simply outhit by the Anteaters.
as the Cardinal hit .151 and the
Anteaters .378.
Stanford junior outside hitter
Matt Ceran and freshman opposite
Evan Romero led the team with nine
kills and five blocks each for the
night. Their efforts were not enough,
though, when Irvine's seniors Jayson
Jablonsky and Matt Webber gained
21 kills between them.
The match against UCLA was al
most even statistically. Ceran led the
team with 17 kills followed by fresh
man middle blocker Garrett Werner
who had 11 kills. Freshman setter
Kawika Shoji added 42 assists.

Though the Cardinal had a great
overall team performance, the squad
could not match UCLA's hitting and
service game. Bruin senior Steve
Klosterman had 19 kills and two of
UCLA's nine service aces for the
night.
"UCLA played well last week
end." head coach John Kosty said.
"The biggest factor in that game was
our serving. Our service errors cost
us the match. You can practice serv
ing all you want, but it is a complete
ly different situation in a game."
Pepperdine (11-1,9-1 MPSF) has
currently won its last eight matches
against top schools in the nation.The
Waves went up against Brigham
Young twice last week and beat
them in five and three games, respec
tively. BYU was only able to muster
a hitting percentage of .216— 100
percentage points less than its con
ference average of .326.
ITie Pepperdine men's volleyball
team is led by sophomore Paul Car
roll who is one of the top players in
the conference. He is ranked second
individually in the MPSF for his kills
per game average of 6.02, and also
ranked second in service aces.
Today's match will be a battle be
tween Stanford's own Shoji and Pep
perdine's senior setter Jonathan
Winder, who ranks third in the
league for assists.
"Pepperdine has a top setter,
John Winder, and one of the best op
posites." Kosty said. "Paul Carroll is
a left-handed opposite and has real
ly improved since last year.They will

be a tough team, especially because
they are a very tall team."
After battling Pepperdine in
Malibu. Calif., the Cardinal will
travel to Los Angeles to play USC
(4-9, 3-7. MPSF). USC split a close
series last week in Hawaii, winning
in five games and then losing in four
games.
A key attacker for the Trojans,
junior Juan Figueroa, displayed a
great performance in the first match
against Hawaii last week, collecting
a career high of 35 kills (.410).
Figueroa is ranked No. 3 with a 4.97
kills per game average in the MPSF.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, mid
way through the second match with
1 lawaii. Figueroa was dealt a hitting
error and came down on the floor
wrongly, spraining his ankle.
"It is questionable if Figueroa will
play this weekend." Kosty said. "We
are ready for him and the Trojans ei
ther way. [USC junior setter] Jimmy
Killian distributes the ball really
well, and I know that the Trojans
have other guys that can do the job."
Shoji will have a tough match
ahead of him, facing off against Kil
lian. the second-ranked setter for as
sists in the MPSF,but Shoji's coach is
confident in his setter's game.
"kawika Shoji runs a great of
fense." Kosty said. "We are starting
to put things together, and this is an
other opportunity to prove ourselves
against some tough opponents."
