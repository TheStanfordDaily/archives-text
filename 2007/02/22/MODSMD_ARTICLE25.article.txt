Although the Card trailed 1-3 against
Miami, its three freshmen hung around and
ultimately closed out Stanford's first win of
the season.
Freshman Paul Morrissey celebrated his
first dual match win of his Stanford career.
"It was a relief, first of all." Morrissey
said. "And it was nice to compete with 16 of
the best teams in the country. Even in the
matches that we lost, we felt like we were
competing with the other teams and playing
at (the same] level."
Stanford set the tone on Sunday when it
got off to a dominant start in doubles. Se
nior Eric McKean paired up with sopho
more Jeff Zeller to win the first doubles
set, 8-4, at the third spot. At the top posi
tion. sophomores Matt Bruch and Blake
Muller won the second doubles set of the
day, 8-5. to secure the doubles point for the
Card. Morrissey and freshman Richard
Wire led their opponents, 7-4. when dou

nabbed three singles matches in straight sets
to take a commanding 3-1 lead. Muller.
Bruch and McKean dropped their matches
at the third, first and fourth singles posi
tions, respectively, to put the Hurricanes
within one point of victory.
The Card looked to its freshmen to keep
the team in the match. Stanford clung onto
a bit of hope when Wire and fellow fresh
man Kevin Kaiser both picked up their first
sets, 7-5. and Morrissey eked out the first set
in a tiebreaker. Kaiser then closed out his
match in straight sets to trim Miami's lead to
3-2.
The anticipation grew when Morrissey
and Wire dropped close second sets.s-7 and
4-6. respectively. At the second singles spot.
Wire was able to pick up the third set, 7-5. to
even the overall score to three apiece. At
No. 6 singles, Morrissey finally clinched his
match and the Cardinal's first win of the
season when he won the third set, 6-3.
Wire commented on how the freshmen
have been adjusting.
"1 feel like, with each match, we've been
improving," Wire said. "And in the last
match, we fed off each other. We all worked
together to win."
On Friday and Saturday, Stanford
dropped its fifth and sixth consecutive
matches, with all of its 2007 losses coming to
top-ranked teams. The Card fell to No. 2
Ohio State,4-0. in the opening round of play
on Friday and then dropped a 4-2 decision

the season.

first dual match win of his Stanford career.

the best teams in the country. Even in the
matches that we lost, we felt like we were
competing with the other teams and playing
at (the same] level."

improving," Wire said. "And in the last
match, we fed off each other. We all worked
together to win."
