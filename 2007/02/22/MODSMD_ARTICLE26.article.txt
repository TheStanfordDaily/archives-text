What could have been a per
fect 11-0 start to the season for
Stanford softhall is gone, but in its
place stands a still-admirable 9-2
record. With a five-team tourna
ment on schedule for this week
end. the No. 8 Cardinal has five
opportunities to be near-perfect
again.
Stanford can improve its over
all record at the FIU/Adidas Invi
tational in Miami, Fla.. held
Thursday through Sunday. Hie
Card is set to face Florida Interna
tional tonight at 7 p.m. and Texas
State tomorrow at 3 p.m. Next is a
Saturday doublehcader with Pur
due in the morning and Syracuse
in the afternoon. Finally. Stanford
finishes the tourney on Sunday
with a rematch against an earlier
weekend opponent.
The Cardinal women are in a
current seven-game win streak,
with six victories coming from the
last homestand. On the season,
they boast a perfect 6-0 mark at
home, with a 3-2 record on the
road.
Could the squad have begun
its season with an 11-0 record
though? Close losses to No. 4

Northwestern and No. 17 Texas at
the Kajikawa Classic in Phoenix
blemished the near-perfect
record, but head coach John
Rittman does not believe perfec
tion was possible in hindsight.
"Certainly we could have easi
ly won the two games that we lost,
but at the same time we won a
couple that we very easily could
have lost," Rittman said. "Our
team is playing pretty well right
now. We're improving, and this
weekend will give us an opportu
nity to see a little different type of
competition as far as our reach."
TTie Card rebounded from its
3-2 start with a homestand sweep
in which the team also emerged as
tourney champions of the Stan
ford Invitational. Recent team
success can be attributed to a bal
ance of consistent hitting and
pitching.The pitching squad is led
by sophomore Missy Penna. who
is 6-1 with a 1.25 ERA and 61
strikeouts. Penna is joined by jun
ior Becky McCullough. who is 3-1
with a 2.21 ERA.
On the last homestand, the
pitching tandem dominated op
ponents from inside the circle.
Penna picked up four wins, in
cluding two shutouts, and allowed
only three runs in 24.2 innings for

a 0.33 ERA. McCullough collect
ed two wins and two complete
games giving up just one run.
"Penna and McCullough are
both coming along really nicely,"
Rittman said. "We are just look
ing for them to continue to work
hard and improve, and they're
both getting stronger as the sea
son progresses."
The Stanford offense is doing
its part as well, outscoring oppo
nents 72-21 on the year. The
charge is led by sophomore
Maddy Coon and senior Jackie
Rinehart, who are both on the
Top-50 Watch List for Softball
Collegiate Player of the Year hon
ors.
Coon leads the team with 13
RBI. including a game-winning
three-run bomb against Missouri
on Sunday. Rinehart leads all
Stanford starters with a .471 aver
age and is second on the team
with 14 hits, eight of them staying
in the infield.
The youth element on the
squad is also making its presence
felt. Freshman Rosey Neill drove
in eight runs last weekend. Joining
Neill is freshman Alissa Haber.

on the season.
Despite all the team's success.
Rittman anticipates this tournament
as "a good weekend to try to im
prove on some things."
"The first thing we have to do is
eliminate our mistakes," Rittman
said. "We've made some base-run
ning mistakes and some defensive
errors. So we need to clean up our
defense and just try to continue to
pitch well and gel timely hitting. If
we do those things, we'll be success
ful.
"This is the third weekend of play
for everyone," Rittman added.
"We're playing a team out of the Big

10 in Purdue that has already played
in a couple tournaments; Florida In
ternational is always competitive;
Texas State swings the bat well, and
has a pretty good team; and Syracuse
has already faced us in Phoenix."
The Card's first opponent will be
Florida International, who finished
200b with a 30-28 record. The Pan
thers return 10 letter-winners, in
cluding their top hitter, senior catch
er Tabitha Embry. They are, howev

pitcher Sarah Lancour collected 137
strikeouts with a 2.24 ERA in 2006.

The Card battle Purdue (2-8) on

season, their offense is led by junior
Ashley I lall with a .353 average and
12 hits. Sophomore Kelly Miller
trails Hall with a .333 average and
freshman Jenna Alexander boasts
seven RBI.

"The first thing we have to do is
eliminate our mistakes," Rittman

"This is the third weekend of play

"We're playing a team out of the Big

What could have been a per
fect 11-0 start to the season for
Stanford softhall is gone, but in its
place stands a still-admirable 9-2
record. With a five-team tourna
ment on schedule for this week
end. the No. 8 Cardinal has five
opportunities to be near-perfect
again.
Stanford can improve its over
all record at the FIU/Adidas Invi
tational in Miami, Fla.. held
Thursday through Sunday. Hie
Card is set to face Florida Interna
tional tonight at 7 p.m. and Texas
State tomorrow at 3 p.m. Next is a
Saturday doublehcader with Pur
due in the morning and Syracuse
in the afternoon. Finally. Stanford
finishes the tourney on Sunday
with a rematch against an earlier
weekend opponent.
The Cardinal women are in a
current seven-game win streak,
with six victories coming from the
last homestand. On the season,
they boast a perfect 6-0 mark at
home, with a 3-2 record on the
road.
Could the squad have begun
its season with an 11-0 record
though? Close losses to No. 4

Northwestern and No. 17 Texas at
the Kajikawa Classic in Phoenix
blemished the near-perfect
record, but head coach John
Rittman does not believe perfec
tion was possible in hindsight.
"Certainly we could have easi
ly won the two games that we lost,
but at the same time we won a
couple that we very easily could
have lost," Rittman said. "Our
team is playing pretty well right
now. We're improving, and this
weekend will give us an opportu
nity to see a little different type of
competition as far as our reach."
TTie Card rebounded from its
3-2 start with a homestand sweep
in which the team also emerged as
tourney champions of the Stan
ford Invitational. Recent team
success can be attributed to a bal
ance of consistent hitting and
pitching.The pitching squad is led
by sophomore Missy Penna. who
is 6-1 with a 1.25 ERA and 61
strikeouts. Penna is joined by jun
ior Becky McCullough. who is 3-1
with a 2.21 ERA.
On the last homestand, the
pitching tandem dominated op
ponents from inside the circle.
Penna picked up four wins, in
cluding two shutouts, and allowed
only three runs in 24.2 innings for

a 0.33 ERA. McCullough collect
ed two wins and two complete
games giving up just one run.
"Penna and McCullough are
both coming along really nicely,"
Rittman said. "We are just look
ing for them to continue to work
hard and improve, and they're
both getting stronger as the sea
son progresses."
The Stanford offense is doing

nents 72-21 on the year. The
