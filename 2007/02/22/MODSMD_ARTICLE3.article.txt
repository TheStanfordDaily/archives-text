## Four women's basketball seniors enter final regular-season homestand 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There was a lull in the gym after
the girls' basketball team practice
yesterday. With the last weekend of
the regular season upon them, play
ers finished their drills and listened
as head coach Tara VanDerveer
spoke a few words.
Then it was just quiet. The calm
before the storm. A silent swirl of
nervousness, confidence, anxiety
and excitement.
Senior center Brooke Smith
called it "mixed emotions." Most
notably felt by the seniors (Smith,
guards Markisha Coleman and
Clare Bodensteiner and
forward/center Kristen Newlin),
the sentiments of the Cardinal's
final homestand indicate more
than the wrapping up of conference
play.
"On one hand. I 'm really excited
for postseason play and tourna
ment time to start, but it's going to
be sad to play our last regular sea
son games here," Smith said. "[lt's
hard | to realize that the season's
winding down, that my career at
Stanford is winding down, and that
my time playing with all these
teammates and being coached by
these great coaches is coming to an
end."

No. 8 Stanford (23-4,15-1 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) will kick off the
weekend with tonight's game
against UCLA at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion. While the Cardinal is com
ing off a four-game winning streak,
the Bruins (13-15, 7-9) have had a
more sporadic season, never win
ning more than three consecutive
games. However, this does not
mean they can he easily written off,
as only eight of their match ups
have been decided by more than 10
points.
UCLA's fluctuations in play are
recorded not only in tallies of victo
ries and defeats. In the Dec. 22
meeting with Stanford, the Bruins
surged with a 19-2 run after trailing
by 26 points. The Cardinal held on
to secure the victory, but UCLA
proved to be valiant competition.
Smith said that Stanford has not
forgotten the late-game run, nor
does it take the contest lightly.
"When [the Bruins] put their
minds to something, they can play
very well." Smith said "So you can't
overlook them at all. and we defi
nitely know that they're a very ca
pable, talented team."
The key to Stanford's success
will be shutting down senior guard

Senior center Brooke Smith said the moments leading to this week
end are full of "mixed emotions." Her regular-season career at
Maples could end on a good note. She is shooting 57.8 percent
in six career games against UCLA, tonight's opponent.
