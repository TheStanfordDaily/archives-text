# A 						farewell to Maples
## Four women's basketball seniors enter final regular-season homestand 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There was a lull in the gym after
the girls' basketball team practice
yesterday. With the last weekend of
the regular season upon them, play
ers finished their drills and listened
as head coach Tara VanDerveer
spoke a few words.
Then it was just quiet. The calm
before the storm. A silent swirl of
nervousness, confidence, anxiety
and excitement.
Senior center Brooke Smith
called it "mixed emotions." Most
notably felt by the seniors (Smith,
guards Markisha Coleman and
Clare Bodensteiner and
forward/center Kristen Newlin),
the sentiments of the Cardinal's
final homestand indicate more
than the wrapping up of conference
play.
"On one hand. I 'm really excited
for postseason play and tourna
ment time to start, but it's going to
be sad to play our last regular sea
son games here," Smith said. "[lt's
hard | to realize that the season's
winding down, that my career at
Stanford is winding down, and that
my time playing with all these
teammates and being coached by
these great coaches is coming to an
end."

No. 8 Stanford (23-4,15-1 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) will kick off the
weekend with tonight's game
against UCLA at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion. While the Cardinal is com
ing off a four-game winning streak,
the Bruins (13-15, 7-9) have had a
more sporadic season, never win
ning more than three consecutive
games. However, this does not
mean they can he easily written off,
as only eight of their match ups
have been decided by more than 10
points.
UCLA's fluctuations in play are
recorded not only in tallies of victo
ries and defeats. In the Dec. 22
meeting with Stanford, the Bruins
surged with a 19-2 run after trailing
by 26 points. The Cardinal held on
to secure the victory, but UCLA
proved to be valiant competition.
Smith said that Stanford has not
forgotten the late-game run, nor
does it take the contest lightly.
"When [the Bruins] put their
minds to something, they can play
very well." Smith said "So you can't
overlook them at all. and we defi
nitely know that they're a very ca
pable, talented team."
The key to Stanford's success
will be shutting down senior guard
Noellc Quinn and junior forward

Senior center Brooke Smith said the moments leading to this week
end are full of "mixed emotions." Her regular-season career at
Maples could end on a good note. She is shooting 57.8 percent

l.indsey Pluimer. Quinn leads the
Bruins in scoring, rebounding and
assists, averaging 16.9, 6.8 and 5.75
in each respective category.
Pluimer follows Quinn closely, av
eraging 15.5 points per game,
adding extra support by contribut
ing to the frontcourt's ability to
out-rebound opponents by an aver
age margin of six boards. Smith
noted that all of the Cardinal play
ers will have a role in stopping the
Bruins' offense.
"[UCLA is | a great offensive re
bounding team, so we really need to
box out," she said. "That's one of the
biggest things for us. They also have
Noelle Quinn. and she's a verv good

basketball player, so we need to
focus on her as well. It'll be a good
challenge for lis."
'ITie challenges will continue on
Sunday, when Southern California
arrives at Maples for a noon tip-off.
Tied for fourth in the Pac-10, the
Women of Troy are coming off a 66-
42 victory against Arizona. Senior

ures iti 50 of the Women of Troy's last
51 games and registered 10 double
doubles in the season. Senior for
ward Chloe Kerr averages 17.(i
points and 8.3 rebounds, giving I ISC
a powerful inside presence. Al
though Smith admitted that Stan
ford is taking the weekend "one
game at a time," she said that the
Cardinal looks forward
to playing USC.
"[USC is] a good team as well."
Smith said. "They're doing very well.

and they've gotten a lot better over
the course of the Pac-10."
Most importantly, however. Stan
lord looks for victories this weekend
to assure its seventh consecutive
Pac-10 title.
"We would love to win the Pac-10
Championship outright, so we need
to win these games," Smith said. "I
just think it's a really important
weekend for us to do well and come
out ready to play."
Though her focus is on the imme
diate future. Smith talked about
more extended team goals.
"We obviously need to improve
still going into the tournament," she
said."But, we've got a great opportu
nity. and hopefully, we'll go to the
Final Four because that's really our
goal."
