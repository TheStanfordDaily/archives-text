# TOP FIVE TO WATCH
## 
### 
1 • Senior Moment
In their final regular season appearances, all four
seniors are expected to make good game contribu
tions. Among them, center/forwards Brooke Smith
and Kristen Newlin will play vital roles in victories for
the Cardinal. Smith averages 13.9 points per game,
and Newlin adds another 7.4. Both also average
more than 7.5 boards per game, and their inside
presence will be necessary against both UCLA and
use.
2. Another Murphy
After a number of great performances by freshman
guard Melanie Murphy, Maples will see a new Murphy
this weekend, this one from USC. Shay Murphy leads
the conference in rebounding, steals and free throw per
centage, and is second in scoring and made three
pointers. The Stanford backcourt must stop her to down
the Trojans.
3. The First Noelle
UCLA will look to Noelle Quinn to power nearly every
area of play, as she ranks in the conference's top 10 in
scoring, rebounding, assists, and free throws. Versatile
and quick, Quinn is certainly the best of the Bruins and
will test the Cardinal's guards, as she averaged 18.5
points in the teams' last four encounters.
4. Battle of the Boards
In UCLA and USC, the Cardinal meets the conference's
second- and third-ranked rebounding offenses, respec
tively. Stanford must prevent second shots by both
squads through control of the defensive glass.
5. Appel's Appearance
After back-to-back double-doubles, freshman Jayne
Appel was named Pac-10 Player of the Week. She av
eraged 23 points, 14 rebounds and four assists on the
week. Her play off the bench will lend depth to Stan
ford's inside game, giving the Card the edge over the
L.A.'s teams.
