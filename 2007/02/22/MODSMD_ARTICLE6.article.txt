# Behind the Scenes
## At 6-foot-1, Johnson may not stand out on the sideline, but his leadership does 
### ALEX GYR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At last Tuesday's press conference,
sophomore point guard Mitch Johnson
was asked about the leadership that
senior forward Fred Washington
brought to the team.
"He's so much more developed and
mature," Johnson said. "He brings a lot
of experience and maturity that we
don't have. We're little kids compared
to how much experience he has. He's
got the most energy. He's always out
there leading the drills."
"Mitch was just giving me some
props." Washington responded."l can't
name a time I've ever led a drill. I'm al
ways right behind him."
"I'm trying to give you some credit.
Fred." Johnson said. "Take it and run
with it."
The interaction sums up the leader
ship roles of both Washington and
Johnson perfectly. Washington may be
the public veteran face, and the most
vocal on the court, but it is Johnson, the
team captain, who is the go-to guy be
hind the scenes.
In his second year with the Cardinal.
Johnson has stepped into the role occu
pied by Chris I ternandez '05 last year.
A big difference, however, is that while
Hernandez was Stanford's top scoring
option, Johnson has done much of his
leading from the bench.
When freshman forward Brook
Lopez returned from a back injury that
sidelined him for the season's opening
weeks, a struggling Johnson found him
self on the bench at the start. It was a
new experience for the sophomore,
who started 20 games in his freshman
season.
"I think it was a way that the team
had to go." Johnson said. "What was
more frustrating than not starting were
some of the struggles that I was going
through personally.The frustration was
coming from myself. I believed that I
had more to contribute than what I was
showing early in the season. When the
team made the lineup change, it was
probably the best thing for the team at
the time."
But while Johnson was forced to sit
on the bench, it gave him a new per
spective on the game. He was able to
watch from the sideline and notice
what his teammates on the court could
do to step up their game.
"I respect Mitch a lot." sophomore
forward Lawrence I lill said."When we
went to the bigger lineup. Mitch took it
and kept leading us. He kept us in
games and spiritually talked to us.
keeping us hyped up."
During his time on the bench, the
challenge became not just leading the

team emotionally, but also running the
offense when he did get his time on the
floor. Johnson struggled early in the
year to hang on to the ball in Stanford's
half-court offense. His shots weren't
falling, and his time on the bench in
creased. But Washington said that there
is no one on the Stanford roster who
could do what Johnson does.
"Mitch has always been our starting
point guard — we've never thought of
it any other way." Washington said.

"Anthony was starting at point, but we
all know that me. Anthony and
Lawrence don't add up to the point
guard that Mitch is. He runs the team
and he calms us down. When I'm in one
of my moods, or I'm pissed off about
something, he calms me down. He runs
the team and knows what to do."
When sophomore guard Anthony
Goods went down with a sprained
ankle two weeks ago against Washing
ton. Johnson got another shot to be the

actual starting point guard. In his first
games back, the Seattle native did not
disappoint. In just his second game
back in the starting five, Johnson had 12
points, two assists and. most important
ly. no turnovers in an 88-h9 upset over
Oregon.
"I think the biggest thing for me,
people probably won't believe it. but it
is all about confidence." Johnson said.
"There is so much in your mind that
needs to happen to get ready to shoot,
especially if you don't do it that often.
[Against the Oregon schools] I took
the mentality that 1 was going to have
my feet set and my hands ready. If it
was open. I was going to let it go."
He has done it all with the funkiest
jump shot this side of Josh Childress.
Johnson said that advisors have tried
to convince him to ditch the current
shot, even shoot from the right side
rather than from his natural side, as a
lefty. But Johnson says that his shot is
here to stay.
"My shot is something that I've al
ways had. It has the basics — keep the
ball up. follow through and all that,"
Johnson said. "If 1 had come in and
made 50 percent from the three-point
line starting last year, people wouldn't
have talked about how it looked. Guys
like Reggie Miller, even Lawrence,
have different shots. Plenty of guys in
the NBA have different shots,but when
it goes in, people don't question it."
Johnson's scoring numbers have
been on the rise as the season pro
gressed, while his turnovers have
dropped. In 23.5 minutes per game this
season. Johnson has averaged 4.4
points and notched 87 assists to 51
turnovers.
But despite the increased scoring in
recent games, Stanford head coach
Trent Johnson maintains that his point
guard's status is still the same.
"He's knocked down a couple of
shots, but Mitch is still Mitch." Trent
Johnson said. "I lis role is not going to
change. He is going to be in charge of
taking care of the ball. As long as he
doesn't try to do too much, he's going to
be fine."
Now that Mitch Johnson is back in
the starting lineup and playing the best
basketball of his Stanford career, does
he think the Cardinal have a chance to
make a run? Like a true leader, he
keeps everything in perspective.
"We were supposed to be seventh in
the Pac-10." Johnson said. "No one on
this team was supposed to be very good
individually. But we have believed in
ourselves. If we just keep doing what
we've been doing, we have a chance to
win every week."
