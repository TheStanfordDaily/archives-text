## TOP FIVE TO WATCH 
### 
1 • On the Road Again
Stanford is 5-4 in away games this season as it heads to
SoCal, but the squad is 2-3 in its last five. After being swept
at the Washington schools, sophomore forward Lawrence
Hill said the Card needs to "come and play like it was a
home game."
2. Block Party
With a tally of 155 blocks on the season, Stanford needs only
13 to set a school single-season record. Freshman forward
Brook Lopez, who had a school-record 12 blocks against the
Trojans on Jan. 25, will help his team meet that mark soon.
3. Home Cooking
There may be some friendly faces in the crowd for the Cardi
nal, as freshman guard Landry Fields, senior forward Fred
Washington and sophomore guard Anthony Goods all hail
from the Los Angeles area.
4. More Mitch
Mitch Johnson stepped up against Oregon last week, scoring
12 points on 3-of-4 shooting from the field. Aftera well-round
ed seven points, eight assists and five rebounds against USC
last month, look for the sophomore point guard to make an
impact, starting in place of the injured Goods.
5. Starting Strong
Expect USC to come out hard from the starting gate, looking
to avenge last month's loss at Maples Pavilion, as well as last
week's 68-58 upset loss at Arizona State.
