## Appel tastes triumph on the court with breakthrough performances, but still has room to grow 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
.lust three months ago.Jayne Appel was having the breakthrough per
formance of her Stanford career. Now the freshman center is breaking
records.
Over the weekend, she had two straight double doubles (her second
and third overall). Against Oregon State. Appel had ;i career-high 2<S
points and 17 rebounds (a season high for the Cardinal),only to follow
it up with a near triple-double —18 points. 11 rebounds and seven as
sists — against Oregon.
Having averaged 23.0 points. 14.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists for the
Oregon sweep, Appel was named Pacific-10 Conference Player of the
Week for Feb. 12-IS.
"Jayne has been delivering, and I think she'll finish stronger." head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She's playing with more and more confi
dence; being named Player of the Week has been great for her. and I
think she's just scratching the surface of how good she's going to be. Our
team has a lot of confidence in her."
Back in November. Appel's confidence was only beginning to devel
op. She made her debut in the Nov. 13 Brigham Young game, coming off
of an injured left shoulder, which had kept heron the bench for a month.
Appel came on the court with 17: l l ) left in the first half: in just 14 min
utes. she garnered five rebounds, four points and two blocks. It was not
enough, though, to stop the then-No. 24 Cougars en route to a 55-52
upset over then-No. 4 Stanford.
After the disappointment, Appel followed up with a true break
through performance. In the third game of her career, going up against
Candace Parker and then-No. 4 Tennessee, Appel managed 23 points,
five rebounds and five blocks in just 30 minutes of play.lbe next game,
against then-No. K Georgia, she added another 16 points and nine re
bounds.
Back then. Appel said she was nervous being on the court with top
ranked teams. ITiree months later, a lot has changed.
After having felt "thrown into the mix" in Tennessee and Georgia.
