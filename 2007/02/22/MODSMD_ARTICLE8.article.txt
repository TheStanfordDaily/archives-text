# A 						Big Bite of Success
## Appel tastes triumph on the court with breakthrough performances, but still has room to grow 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
.lust three months ago.Jayne Appel was having the breakthrough per
formance of her Stanford career. Now the freshman center is breaking
records.
Over the weekend, she had two straight double doubles (her second
and third overall). Against Oregon State. Appel had ;i career-high 2<S
points and 17 rebounds (a season high for the Cardinal),only to follow
it up with a near triple-double —18 points. 11 rebounds and seven as
sists — against Oregon.
Having averaged 23.0 points. 14.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists for the
Oregon sweep, Appel was named Pacific-10 Conference Player of the
Week for Feb. 12-IS.
"Jayne has been delivering, and I think she'll finish stronger." head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She's playing with more and more confi
dence; being named Player of the Week has been great for her. and I
think she's just scratching the surface of how good she's going to be. Our
team has a lot of confidence in her."
Back in November. Appel's confidence was only beginning to devel
op. She made her debut in the Nov. 13 Brigham Young game, coming off
of an injured left shoulder, which had kept heron the bench for a month.
Appel came on the court with 17: l l ) left in the first half: in just 14 min
utes. she garnered five rebounds, four points and two blocks. It was not
enough, though, to stop the then-No. 24 Cougars en route to a 55-52
upset over then-No. 4 Stanford.
After the disappointment, Appel followed up with a true break
through performance. In the third game of her career, going up against
Candace Parker and then-No. 4 Tennessee, Appel managed 23 points,
five rebounds and five blocks in just 30 minutes of play.lbe next game,
against then-No. K Georgia, she added another 16 points and nine re
bounds.
Back then. Appel said she was nervous being on the court with top
ranked teams. ITiree months later, a lot has changed.
After having felt "thrown into the mix" in Tennessee and Georgia.

Appel said she now knows what Van-
Derveer expects of her — and it's
only to work harder.
"I feel like C oach has given me
something pretty much every day to
work on." Appel said."The first week
after Tennessee and Georgia was
that 1 can't dribble, the next week
was to use my left instead of going to
the right, [etc.| I-very week has accu
mulated with me trying to get better.
"So now. I feel like I've been able
to piece it all together." she contin
ued. "Hopefully, for the rest of the
year, it'll be like that."
Yet. even after piecing it together
this weekend against the Oregon
schools. Appel had another assign
ment: shooting a better percentage.
She shot 55.2 percent from the
field over the weekend on 21-of-38
shooting, and is also shooting 55.2
percent on the season.
"The shots I'm taking are easy
shots that 1 should be making
that's definitely a key thing for this
week," Appel said.
For the season, the Pleasant 1 lill.
Calif, native has had 17 double-digit
scoring games, leading the Cardinal
in scoring nine times (including ties).
She ranks third on the team with a
13.1-point average. And as Appel
continues to works on her shot, the
Cardinal will respond.

"She really works on getting a
great position. VanDerveer said. "I
think, as a team, we're working hard
to get her the ball more . .. She's get
ting great shots, and 1 think she'll
shoot better and better as the season
ends up."
However, more pressing for the
young freshman is long-running
trouble with fouls. Appel fouled out
two straight times at Arizona State
on Jan. 2" and at Santa Barbara on
Feb. I.and she has other close calls
on record.
So when Appel had her fourth
foul against Washington on Feb. 10
with 12:2(> left in the game, Van-
Derveer reminded her. "If you want
to stay in the game and play, you
need to stay in the game."
Appel responded and played an
other 10 minutes before subbing out;
this weekend she had three fouls
each at Oregon State and Oregon.
"She figured that out this week
end. and we'll see it (avoiding those
fouls] carries over," VanDerveer
said."Jayne knows you can only have
five fouls.and she doesn't get a whole
lot of love from the officials... I
think she's understanding that she
needs to play a little better defense,
move her feet and trade space [to
avoid fouling]."
For this 2006 (iatorade State

Player of the Year, keeping herself in
the game and the free-throw points
low is just another part of her role on
the Stanford team, as much as mak
ing her inside shots and getting up on
the boards.
And for all of the Cardinal, it's
these kinds of roles that matter as the
team enters the postseason, looking
to reclaim its Pac-10 tournament title
and advance past the Elite flight in
the NC'AAs. According to Appel. as
much as she has been piecing togeth
er her own role, it is now about
"everyone coming together, getting
the chemistry that we've been build
ing all season."
"lor everyone on our team it's
getting to the point where [we real
i/e] "This is your role,' This is what
you need to do,' which is good."
Appel said. "It'll keep us focused to
where we want to go."
Where Appel wants to head next
is toward victories over UCLA and
Southern California to cap her fresh
man year. Hut VanDerveer knows
there's much more in store for Appel
after that.
"Jayne is having a fabulous fresh
man year." VanDerveer said, "and
the best is still in front of us."
