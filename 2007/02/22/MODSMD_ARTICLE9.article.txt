## Evolution: tinkerers not architects

Cancer is the ultimate betrayal.
A body's own cells become
enemy combatants, smother
ing their brethren as they multiply
out of control. It's a utilitarian out
rage — but cancer is also amazingly
prevalent. In the U.S., men have a 45
percent chance of being diagnosed
with cancer in their lifetimes, while
women have a 39 percent chance.
So why haven't we evolved resist
ance to the disease? Surely some
thing that wipes out so many mem
bers of our species would get fast
tracked out of the gene pool!
Turns out it's not that simple. A
story in the January issue of "Scien
tific American" reports on how natu
ral selection is losing the battle with
cancer.
It's not for lack of effort. Tumor
suppressor proteins are natural se
lection's most powerful weapons
against cancer, keeping it in check by
looking for abnormally dividing cells
and stamping them out. Certainly,
this should be unequivocally good.
Or maybe not. Recent studies in
mice make the picture a little murki
er. Scientists at UNC Chapel Hill en
gineered mice that were missing p 16,
an important tumor suppressor gene.
The researchers expected the mice to
quickly drop dead, their bodies
wracked with tumors. Some mice did
just that. But the survivors showed
something rather strange. As they
grew chronologically older, their cells
still acted biologically young. In one
experiment, the scientists destroyed

insulin-producing cells in the animals.
The mice with pl 6 were unable to re
cover. developing fatal diabetes and
quickly expiring. The mice without

were able to multiply fast enough to
restore normal pancreatic function.
So even tumor suppressor genes are
an evolutionary trade-off. Natural se
lection can't aggressively ward off tu
mors without hurting healthy tissue.
Another way cancer can thwart
natural selection is by co-opting es
sential bits of human biology. Fatty
acid synthase, or FAS, is a protein
that scientists believe was critical to
the supersizing of human brains. But
cancer cells use the enzyme, too —
FAS is so important to the malignan
cy that inhibiting it can kill a tumor.
That puts natural selection between
a rock and a hard place. It is helpless
to defend against FAS-exploiting tu
mors without stunting human brain
development.
Reproduction is another essen
tial biological function that is hi
jacked by cancer cells. For example, a
fetus forms a placenta to draw vital
nutrients out of its mother's blood
stream.This process is not unlike the
way a tumor forms a network of
blood vessels to siphon away the nu
trients that it needs. Genes that code
for aggressive placenta building
would be favored by natural selec
tion if they grew a healthier baby.
But these same genes could be co
opted by tumor cells when that baby
grew up. And natural selection might
increase the prevalence of these can
cer genes over time, since they also
make more viable babies.
Another example in the repro
duction department comes from
sperm cells. Human men spend
decades as sperm factories. If these
little soldiers are dividing furiously, a
man's sperm count goes up, and so
do his chances for offspring. Genes
for faster-dividing sperm will be
prized by natural selection. But the
warp-speed cell division so prized in
sperm production would make a
tumor extra-deadly. Natural selec
tion again has its hands tied. When
choosing between more babies or
less cancer, natural selection will go
for the babies.
The whole thing is sort of de
pressing — humans have essentially
evolved to get cancer. In my opinion,
this should give pause to any Intelli
gent Design yahoos. But even
diehard Darwinians can learn a les
son from the cancer story.
Darwin dealt a tremendous blow
to the human ego. Not only was our
planet not the center of the universe,
but our species was not even special
ly created.
But even those who know better
cling to the idea that humans are spe
cial. Evolution is seen as a directed
process, beginning with lowly amoe
bae and culminating in humans, "the
