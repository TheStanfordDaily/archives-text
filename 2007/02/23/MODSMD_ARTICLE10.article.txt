## Q&A: Stan Lai Director, playwright discusses work to open this weekend 
### CHRISTIAN TOM 
Two weeks before the opening of "Secret Love in Peach
Blossom Land," I sat down with famed playwright and
director Stan Lai to discuss his classic of modern Chi
nese theater. "Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land"
which Lai will direct for the first time in North America,
opens at Stanford's Memorial Auditorium this weekend.
Lai is a visiting professor in the drama department and
Asia's Top Theater Director," according to Asiaweek.
"Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land," the most famous
of his 27 original plays, has toured worldwide since its
opening in IVHf). Our discussion, the full transcript of
which is available at www.stanforddaily.com, ranged
from the different atmospheres at Berkeley and Stan
ford; Asians in the performing arts; the nature of creativ
ity and the role of wisdom in society; the uniqueness of
the playwright/director; the importance of improvisation
in Lai's method;and bootlegging DVDs in China.
The Stanford Daily: First thing, you got your Ph.D.
in Dramatic Art from Cal. Why teach at Stanford?
Stan Lai: [laughs] Yeah, it's a radical change. 1 was
laughing pretty hard at the difference when 1 was
teaching here last year because I had only been to Stan
ford to borrow books when I was a student at Cal. 1 was
n't too into the culture at Stanford, so it was like,"Why
are these students so nice?" When I was teaching at
Berkeley in 20(H) — 1 was doing a play there — the stu
dents were very combative, confrontational.
TSI): Let's talk a little about "Secret Love in Peach
Blossom Land." It is. as I understand, two plays in one.
One is a hard-hitting drama, and the other is your take
on a classic folksy Chinese tale — much lighter. It
seems like you are avoiding classification: is it a come
dy: is it a drama?
SL: [laughs] That's a perfect question. When I went

back to Taiwan in l l >B3 to teach and to make theater, we
did not have a modern Chinese theater. It just didn't
exist. It wasn't like I went somewhere to create a revo
lution; I went to a desert to build something because
there was nothing there. The name of my group is Per
formance Workshop; in ( hinese its something even
more neneric. ITie government wouldn t even let me
register it as a theater group because it was too generic
a name. You can't name a restaurant "Restaurant";you
can't name a theater group "Theater Group." but that's
basically what it means. I named it that so it could en
compass any possibility. I didn't want to copy Western
form, and 1 didn't know what experiments with tradi
tional Chinese forms it would bring this to. "Secret
Love in Peach Blossom Land" was my fifth play and a
lot of my work does defy categorization. A dear friend
of mine, the late Singaporean playwright kuo Pao kun.
said my work was neither Chinese nor Western,neither
mainstream nor avant-garde, and neither comedy nor
tragedy. And if you change the "neither...nor" to
"both...and," it works too. So that was his take on my
work, which came from a really organic process to de
fine what is modern Chinese theater, and that s why it
defies categorization.
TSI): In trying to define what is modern Chinese
theater, this play has been performed thousands of
times across Taiwan and mainland China, with different
casts and crews. What are the commonalities upon
which all of those built and what is new in this Stanford,
and American, premiere?
SI.: [pauses] It's a play about a special time. You
have to know what happened in 1949 to understand
that, which is when almost two million people from
China went across the Taiwan Straits to Taiwan — po
litical upheaval, civil war. People thought they were
