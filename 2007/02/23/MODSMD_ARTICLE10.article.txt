## Q&A: Stan Lai Director, playwright discusses work to open this weekend 
### CHRISTIAN TOM 
Two weeks before the opening of "Secret Love in Peach
Blossom Land," I sat down with famed playwright and
director Stan Lai to discuss his classic of modern Chi
nese theater. "Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land"
which Lai will direct for the first time in North America,
opens at Stanford's Memorial Auditorium this weekend.
Lai is a visiting professor in the drama department and
Asia's Top Theater Director," according to Asiaweek.
"Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land," the most famous
of his 27 original plays, has toured worldwide since its
opening in IVHf). Our discussion, the full transcript of
which is available at www.stanforddaily.com, ranged
from the different atmospheres at Berkeley and Stan
ford; Asians in the performing arts; the nature of creativ
ity and the role of wisdom in society; the uniqueness of
the playwright/director; the importance of improvisation
in Lai's method;and bootlegging DVDs in China.
The Stanford Daily: First thing, you got your Ph.D.
in Dramatic Art from Cal. Why teach at Stanford?
Stan Lai: [laughs] Yeah, it's a radical change. 1 was
laughing pretty hard at the difference when 1 was
teaching here last year because I had only been to Stan
ford to borrow books when I was a student at Cal. 1 was
n't too into the culture at Stanford, so it was like,"Why
are these students so nice?" When I was teaching at
Berkeley in 20(H) — 1 was doing a play there — the stu
dents were very combative, confrontational.
TSI): Let's talk a little about "Secret Love in Peach
Blossom Land." It is. as I understand, two plays in one.
One is a hard-hitting drama, and the other is your take
on a classic folksy Chinese tale — much lighter. It
seems like you are avoiding classification: is it a come
dy: is it a drama?
SL: [laughs] That's a perfect question. When I went

back to Taiwan in l l >B3 to teach and to make theater, we
did not have a modern Chinese theater. It just didn't
exist. It wasn't like I went somewhere to create a revo
lution; I went to a desert to build something because
there was nothing there. The name of my group is Per
formance Workshop; in ( hinese its something even
more neneric. ITie government wouldn t even let me
register it as a theater group because it was too generic
a name. You can't name a restaurant "Restaurant";you
can't name a theater group "Theater Group." but that's
basically what it means. I named it that so it could en
compass any possibility. I didn't want to copy Western
form, and 1 didn't know what experiments with tradi
tional Chinese forms it would bring this to. "Secret
Love in Peach Blossom Land" was my fifth play and a
lot of my work does defy categorization. A dear friend
of mine, the late Singaporean playwright kuo Pao kun.
said my work was neither Chinese nor Western,neither
mainstream nor avant-garde, and neither comedy nor
tragedy. And if you change the "neither...nor" to
"both...and," it works too. So that was his take on my
work, which came from a really organic process to de
fine what is modern Chinese theater, and that s why it
defies categorization.
TSI): In trying to define what is modern Chinese
theater, this play has been performed thousands of
times across Taiwan and mainland China, with different
casts and crews. What are the commonalities upon
which all of those built and what is new in this Stanford,
and American, premiere?
SI.: [pauses] It's a play about a special time. You
have to know what happened in 1949 to understand
that, which is when almost two million people from
China went across the Taiwan Straits to Taiwan — po
litical upheaval, civil war. People thought they were

moving to this island temporarily,
but they wound up living their whole
lives there with no contact with their
relatives and loved ones. So it's a
story about that. People empathize
with that. People in China or Taiwan,
they get that. Now. younger genera
tions that are watching this play, they
don't quite get it. But it doesn't mat
ter. The play, now 20 years after its
inception, is really showing its uni
versal colors, particularly in this
American production. And so far
we haven't seen the audience yet
but from the response I've seen from
the cast and people who sit in on re
hearsals, there is no real cultural
problem in presenting this. I labored
quite long with the translation and in
rehearsal dealing with the most
minute words and lines.
TSI): You've directed this show be
fore. but this is your first time in Eng
lish. What have you retained from pre
vious productions and what can we ex
pect to be brand new about it?
SL: I am a great advocate of not
fixing anything that is not broken, lliis
play has been considered structurally,
well, some people have called it per
fect. So 1 don't fool with that. But, the
big thing I've done is change the lo
cale of the play from ( liina or Taiwan
to Stanford, California. Because it is a
play about two theater groups fight
ing for a rehearsal space, this space is
not the National Theater in Taipei.
Taiwan, or the Capital Theater in Be
jing but Memorial Auditorium at
Stanford. And.the people lighting are
students. So it brings an immediacy to
the audience. They are watching the
process of a theater being fought over.
And then, a comedy, a tragedy conse
quently being performed.
TSI): Any time a writer is able to
direct his or her own work, some
people say they have a certain in
sight— that they can understand
the text better, that they can explain
things to the actors more fully. Do
you agree that playwrights and di
rectors who wear multiple hats give
a special angle come curtain?
SL: 1 am a playwright and a direc
tor. But the word playwright/direc
tor doesn't fit what I do because, to
me. normally that playwright/direc
tor is a subsequent thing: you do the
writing first, the directing later. To

me it's one job. So that's why 1 have
my special process for working with
actors through the extensive use of
improvisation in a rehearsal process
that can take months to get to the
final piece. So while I'm writing it.
I 'm directing it at the same time.This
is different because this text is 20
years old so I've become just a pure
director. But of course I have the in
sight. But I don't think it always
works that a playwright is a good di
rector of his own work.
TSD: There is some obvious the
matic symbolism at work in the play:
a Taiwanese man separated from his
true love by the Communist
takeover, to start. What are some of
the subtler messages you arc trying
to put forth with this play?
SI.: Unfortunately, a Western au
dience wouldn't know a chronicle of
the Peach Blossom Spring by Tao
Yun Ling, which 1 will print in the
program. Peach Blossom Land is
based on it. It is a fourth century text.
In China, Peach Blossom Land is
synonymous with Utopia. It is the
ideal land, republic. It is the story of
this fisherman who finds this
Shangri-la place and afterwards can
never find it again. It is a touching
story. And everyone in China or Tai
wan can memorize it by heart be
cause it is beautiful prose and it is
taught in schools. A lot of your ques
tions are my questions too. We'll
have to see how the audience reacts.
TSD: What's your favorite thing
about Stanford? The academics?
The food?
SL: [chuckles] Certainh not the
food! I"m still struggling to find st>me
thing to eat on campus. I or me, this
may sound crazy to you, even now
I'm teaching two classes, directing a
play and I have student individual
study, but 1 find it very quiet and re
laxing. My life in Asia is so hectic: it's
nonstop, particularly this recent tour
of "Peach Blossom Land." I'm in re
hearsals afternoon to midnight,
media from morning until rehearsal
and then I have all my stuff in Taipei.
It'sa very tiring life which I alsoenjoy.
But I think here 1 think it's California,
my roots from my graduate school
days in the Bay Area. But just looking
at the sunshine, at the trees — it's to
tally worth it. I feel a sense of peace.
For me as an artist that's very impor
tant. I have a place to regenerate my
self, and I can do that here.
