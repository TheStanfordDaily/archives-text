## Peace process amid talk of war in Mid East 
### PETER DURNING 
In the Middle Hast,U.S. Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice attempt
ed this week to revitalize the peace
process in Israel-Palestine, but. thus
far, her efforts have shown no con
crete progress. While some have crit
icized Rice for what they view as a
futile endeavor.others praise her ini
tiative for bringing the government
of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert to the same table as the
Hamas-Fatah coalition that now
leads the Palestinian Authority. The
meeting was made possible by a deal
brokered in Mecca by the rulers of
Saudi Arabia, bringing to an end a
bitter rift between Mahmoud
Abbas's Fatah Party, which seeks en
gagement with Israel, and Hamas,
the hard-line anti-Israel winner of
last year's legislative elections.
The talks are taking place in the
context of the strengthening of an al
liance between Israel and the United
States, and the Sunni Arab states of
Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The
cause for this partnership is mutual
concern over the expansion of Iran,
which the Vienna-based International
Atomic Energy Agency (lAEA) in
culpated on Thursday for continuing
to enrich uranium, possibly for use in
nuclear weapons. Iran responded
promptly to the lAEA's report by an
nouncing its intention to build an ad
ditional 3.(HK) centrifuges — the key
component in uranium enrichment —
by May of this year. Iran.a Shi'ite state
established by the Islamic cleric, the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has
been accused recently by President
(ieorgc W. Bush of providing materiel
to Iraqi militias responsible for the
deaths of ll.S.servicemen and women.
The U.S.. which has no official
diplomatic relations with Iran, has
hardened its opposition to the Islam
ic Republic since last summer's con
flict between the Israeli Defense
Force and the Lebanese Shi'ite militia
Mizbullah. Mizbullah, which has a
strong base of support in southern

Lebanon and other pockets of the
country, was created by the Iranian
regime in the 1980s as an agent for the
exportation of the Islamic revolution.
Links between Tehran and Hizbul
lah's leader. Hassan Nasrullah. re
main strong, although many now see
Syria as an increasingly important
force in controlling the organization.
The hard line that the Bush admin
istration holds against Iran and Syria
came across during Secretary Rice's
trip to the region this week. While
meeting with members of the Olmert
cabinet. Dr. Rice asked the Israeli gov
ernment to desist from participating
in "exploratory talks" with the regime
of Bashar al-Assad in the neighboring
state of Syria. 'ITie predominantly
Sunni Arab state, which has been
under the control of the dictatorship
of the Shi'ite Assad family for
decades, has hinted it may be willing to
hold peace talks with the state of Is
rael. Due to a controversy regarding
the ownership of the region known as
the Golan I leights. which Syria lost to
Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
the two states have not shared a peace
agreement in more than 30 years. Crit
ics of the current U.S. policy believe
that it will be easier to contain Iran
once Syria is separated from it and
that Syria naturally belongs in a block
with the Sunni Arab states.
While the United States is having
success in finding common ground
with the Sunni governments, an im
passe is beginning to develop be
tween the U.S. and Europe on the
question of aid for Palestine. ITie
question is whether or not the Pales
tinian unity government should be el
igible for foreign aid. Last year. West
ern powers withdrew funds from the
Hamas-led government until its lead
ers publicly renounced violence and
acknowledged the state of Israel's
right to exist. While the United States
still upholds these demands. Euro
pean officials are discussing the pos
sibility of sending humanitarian aid
to Palestine irrespective of whether
the Authority meets these conditions
or not. The Russian foreign minister.
Sergei Lavrov. explicitly stated that it
was not necessary for the Palestinian
government to meet these conditions
in order for aid to be sent. As with the

dispute over Iranian nuclear devel
opment, Russian noncompliance
with U.S. policy goals represents a
major obstacle. In addition to serving
as a member of the Middle Eastern
"quartet" — the historic team of
peacemakers that has the UN. the
U.S. and the European Union as its
other members — there are consid
erable cultural ties between Russia
and Israel,which has a large Russian
born population.
In Iraq this week, plans were an
nounced to begin drawdowns of Dan
ish and British troops starting in the
spring. The British military, a 7.000-
strong force, has had its command in
the southern part of the country, in
cluding the strategic port city of
Basra, since 2003. In the intervening
years. Operation Sinbad — the
British military's code name for the
campaign — has claimed the lives of
more than 130 British soldiers. The
announcement, made by Prime Min
ister Tony Blair on Wednesday,comes
as President Bush defends his deci

sion to send an additional 2().(XM) U.S.
troops into Iraq. Although Mr. Blair
indicated that British troops would
remain in some capacity in Iraq be
yond 2008. observers in Washington
say that supporters of the war in the
Republican Party and the Bush ad
ministration are taking the news
grimly. In an interview with the BBC's
John Humphrys. Mr. Blair rejected
blame for the violence plaguing Iraq,
saying, "the responsibility exists with
the people doing the violence." In a
related story. Prince Harry, the third
in the line to the British throne and a
graduate of the prestigious Sandhurst
Military Academy, is scheduled to
serve in Iraq for a period of six
months,beginning with the next troop
rotation.
