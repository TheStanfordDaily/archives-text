### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
The Medical School and the Na
tional Center for New Plays at Stan
ford presented a play that focused on
genetic manipulation in humans and
discusses its ethical significance yes
terday. Seth Rozin's "Reinventing
Eden" — performed in the Clark
Center Auditorium — is the first
ever collaboration of the two groups.
The Med School and the new
plays group will collaborate again on
March 15 to put on a second per
formance — Mia McCullough's
"Echoes of Another Man" — which
revolves around brain transplants.
The production highlights moral
concerns about maintaining identity
and the implications of such brain
surgeries.
"[These] issues [are] at the fore
front of scientific, political and reli
gious debate and [are] very impor
tant to dramatize — particularly for

a medical,ethics and human biology
student," said David Goldman, ex
ecutive director of the National
Center for New Plays at Stanford, in
an email. "Since [genetic manipula
tion and brain transplants haven't]
happened yet. dramatizing the sub
ject allows for discussion and debate
on those issues."
Medical School Dean Philip
Pizzo commended the interdiscipli
nary nature of the plays.
"It is not surprising that there is a
strong association between medicine
and the humanities that is often de
picted in literature, art and theater,"
he told the Stanford Report. "The
boundaries of medicine rise from its
fundamental underpinnings in basic
science and extend to the ethereal
limits of humanity and spirituality."
Goldman said he hopes that these
plays will become a yearly occur
rence.
"1 hope the audience finds the ex
perience to be both theatrically and
intellectually rewarding via experi
encing what a play can do to enhance
learning as well as being entertaining
emotionally." he said.
"Echoes of Another Man" is free
and open to the public,and audience
members will be seated on a first
come, first serve basis.
