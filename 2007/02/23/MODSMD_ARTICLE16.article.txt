## Editorial Board Expanded engineering GER offerings needed 
### 
For undergraduates across most aca
demic disciplines, fulfilling Stanford's
Ccner.il Education Requirements
(CI Rs) can be a cumbersome task. In pro
moting a balanced liberal arts education,
students .ire required to take courses which
may fall outside of their window of knowl
edge or interest: 111 I'M in freshman year,
then a combination of courses which satisfy
I Education for ('iti/enship and demonstrate
a five-tiered Disciplinary Breadth (l)B).
Of the five Dli requirements — engi
neering and applied sciences, humanities,
mathematics, natural sciences and the social
sciences— the hardest to fulfill is engineer
ing and applied sciences (1 • ngrAppSci). Ac
cording to Axess, this quarter there are 63
courses which fulfill the I ngr AppSci (11 • R.
a sizable number of offerings at first glance.
However, after excluding Introductory
Seminars (eight) and courses with stated
prerequisites, that number falls to four. In
troductory Seminars (IntroSems) are de
signed for freshmen and sophomores and
are hosted by Freshman and Sophomore
Programs, liie prerequisites for many
courses were often other engineering cours
es. 'Ilius. unlike many humanities courses,
most classes which fulfill the I ngr AppSci
CI R are either designed for small groups
of freshmen or sophomores or demand pre
requisite courses.
To be clear, we do not advocate removing
the I ngr AppSci (ilß.and we do not believe
that it does not have a clear place in the wide
ranging academic focus of the I Jniversity. We
do feel,however, that one's options lor fulfill
ing th.it CI R are substantially lower for stu
dents who do not plan to academically focus
in that area compared to other CI Rs. We
recommend that more classes which fulfill
the I {ngr AppSci CI R be available to stu
dents who have admittedly little engineering
background or knowledge.
The hypothetical "techie" upperclass

student looking to fulfill her humanities
(ilk this quarter had far more options
available because so many of the applicable
courses, such as Introduction to African and
African-American Studies or Topics in
American Music, were not IntroSems and
had no prerequisites at all.
li\ contrast, for the same "fuzzy" upper
class student who has little or no experience
in engineering or the applied sciences, the
options for fulfilling the aforementioned
(1 I K are limited. As previously mentioned.
IntroSems are open by application mainly
to freshmen and sophomores, and the ma
jority of the other classes have prerequi
sites .Thus,that hypothetical"fuzzy"student
this quarter had only four options: CS 106 A.
l-arth Systems 101. I I 101 A and MM 101.
It is also worth noting that none of the
four courses —CS 106 A. I • arth Systems
101. I I 101 A and Ml 101 —is necessarily
very receptive to non-engineering majors.
CS 106 A. while not technically requiring
"prior programming experience" is more
complex than ('S 105 which is "lor non-tech
nical majors"; I• arth Systems 101 •"recom
mends" Math 21 or 42 and I NCR 30; IT
101A is the first of a two-part scries on cir
cuits; and Mb 101 is designed for juniors
and seniors who are presumably majoring
in mechanical engineering, though the lUil
letin does not state this explicitly. In other
words, these aren't large, friendly, introduc
tory level lectures like Psych I or Master
pieces of 1 Miglish I it. which welcome non
majors.
There are, however, a handful of man
agement, science and engineering (MS&li)
courses which have little or nothing to do
with engineering in a traditional sense that
satisfy the I ngrAppSci requirement and
which might appeal to"lu//ics." Some basic
MS&I ; courses require Math 51, but. practi-

cally speaking, we do not consider a
Math 51 prerequisite as prohibitive
for most students.
Despite the availability of a few
courses in MS&E and other scat
tered departments, much work
needs to be done. In order for the
Cjl R system to gain more traction
with students, more EngrAppSci
classes which can be taken at any
time in an undergraduate career
must be added. The current system
— with its dismal number of GER
courses in engineering and applied
science — fails students in its goal of
broadening academic horizons.
