# I run out of jokes about half-way through

### 
Don't worry if I haven't responded to
your e-mail yet. lete-a-tetes will be
scheduled as time permits, and your
time will come!
I just wanted to respond to the most com
mon inquiry I received, which went some
thing like this:
"Vishnu! You complete me. I'm going to
write you e-mails everyday like in that movie
based 011 the novel *Tlie Notebook." and ii
doesn't matter when you don't reply because
111 just assume that your mother is intercept
ing them and that you'll read them someday
and come find me and love me forever.
"I cut out your picture from the paper,
blew it up to life-size and put it on Roger
I ederer's body because, from what I hear,
you two have the same body type. I then
pasted it to my ceiling and the inside of my
eyelids.
"I just have one question for you: Should
I go to law school? On the one hand, it'll
make me more like you. which is AYVI -
S( )MI .At the same time. I hear it's kind of a
horrible experience and that being a lawyer
is mostly unsatisfying. Please help me!"
First off. you're right. Roger and I do
look a lot alike. A lot.
As to your law school anxieties, help you
I will. Based on my time here at the Law
School, I'd say that the spectrum of ratio
nales that brought people here has two
ends: on the one side you have dreamers
who've always wanted to be lawyers, and on
the other you have roamers who really did
n't have anywhere else to go. Some people
who end up in law school are neither or both
of these — many seem to just have $180.(MM)

burning a hole in their garter — but I think
that addressing the promise and potential
pit I al Is of each individually is worthwhile.
1. Ilie dreamer: So, you brought assault
charges against the OIUiYN who spanked
you after delivery, eh? 1 irst words out of
your mouth were 'MI'C 5211..V? Kudos.
Nothing wrong with personal motivation
ITie potential downfall of being a dream
er is that, unlike doctors and computer pro
grammers. kids dreaming of becoming
lawyers have very little idea what it is that
most lawyers actually do. As some of you
may already know, very lew lawyers spend
any significant time arguing in front of a
jury; the majority of their efforts .ire devot
ed to the infinitely more humble tasks of re
searching case law and writing briefs. Some
of you might enjoy finding yourself in bed
with Westlaw (or its arch-nemesis and
scorned lover I exisNexis). but the connec
tion to whatever the dreamer imagined a
lawyer's life to be is minimal.
2. 'I he roamer: So. you took the I SAT.
you did pretty well, and you have a pretty
stellar (il'A To top it off. vou trinle-maiored

Pleading Inanity
in philosophy, classics and women's
studies, and there's really nothing
else that you can occupy yourself
with (other than becoming an 1-
banker or consultant, which the very
thought of doing abhors your liberal
sensibilities).
Well, the downside of being a
roamer in law school is that, if vou're

not really sure why you're here, it's
all the more difficult to motivate
yourself through the tough times.
Granted, after law school you'll he
able to find yourself a lucrative ca
reer that is at least sometimes intel
lectually challenging, but is money
alone enough for you to work 20-
hour days? Might you be misdirect
ing the amazing talents that you've
been given and cheating yourself in
the process by spending the majority
of your energy on M& As?
Look, whether you're a dreamer
or a roamer, law school is hard:

you're probably going to get worse
grades than ever before, the students
can be really competitive, tuition is
ridiculous and it is really easy to be
come yet another cog in the legal-in
dustrial complex. There really is no
right decision to make. Unless, that is,
you come to law school to meet peo
ple like me, in which case. 1 should
warn you. I'm kind of a rare find
(which is probably a good thing).
