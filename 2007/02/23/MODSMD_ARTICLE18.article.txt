Criticism of Art & Architecture
Library Unfair
I was disappointed to sec the Art Si Ar
chitecture I ibrary criticized in Katie Tay
lor's 2/22/07 column ("Your I ibrary Per
sonality") m Ihe Daily for lack of access to
the art books.since we have loosened up the
circulation rules significantly in the past
couple of years. All Stanford students can
now take most books out of the Art I ibrary.
Yes. there is two-hour limit on course re
serve material, bill that's to make certain
that no one monopolizes it and everyone
gets a chance to use it.
Kcslricling food and beverage use in a
reading room in which valuable paper ma
terials are being read makes eood sense. I

believe, and is standard library practice
everywhere in the world.
As sucking the spirit out of readers. I
would have to agree that the poured-con
crete ambience of the Cummings Building
isn't very cheery, but it w;is in vogue when
the building w;is designed in the late 19605,
and I'm afraid we have to live with it for the
time being. We've tried to soften it up a bit
with large paintings graciously lent by the
('alitor ( enter.
'Hie Art I ibrary staff works hard to keep
the library open and functioning for almost
SO hours per week, and we are very unhap
py to think that anyone really feels op
pressed here.
