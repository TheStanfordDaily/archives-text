# IHUM changes coming
## New report prompts Faculty Senate vote on shorter sections, fewer units 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Introduction to the 1 lumanities(lHUM)
classes will have shorter sections and be
worth fewer units next year, if the Faculty
Senate approves recommended changes.
The IlilJM Governing Board made its
decision last week after reviewing 1,283 un
dergraduate questionnaire responses and
professor reports in a comprehensive self
study.
Students rank overall satisfaction with
the 1H UM program at 2.88 on a scale of one
to five.
"We learned a lot about student respons
es to IHUM courses,"said Russell Berman,
director of lIIUM and head of the Gover
nance Board. "It came as no surprise that

some students are highly critical of the pro
gram. It was, however, encouraging to learn
that just as many endorsed the program,
with the majority of students in between."
Student comments focused on overly
long sections and frustration with some ex
cessively talkative students, commonly
branded as "IHUM Kids." Respondents
also expressed problems arising from vary
ing levels of high school preparation, as well
as complaints about discrepancies between
sections taught by different teaching fellows
( I Is)
The Governance Board hopes to ap
pease student complaints about section
length.
"It is my belief that we should move to a
model of two 50-minute discussion sec
tions" Berman said. "Discussions would be

come more targeted and efficient, and the
program would be less disruptive of student
schedules."
Classics Professor lan Morris, who
teaches Ancient Empires during winter
quarter, said that he thinks the current sec
tion length works well. He worried that a
shorter period would allow less time for dis
cussions to develop. But he acknowledged
that the 50-minute block could help main
tain engagement throughout the entire sec
tion.
The current section length stipulation is
a mandate of the Faculty Senate, but a pro
posal brought to the Senate by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Standards and Policy
(C-USP) this week seeks to put the section
length determination under the
IHIJM Governance Board s juris
diction. If approved, the Governance
Board would then vote on the sug
gested change.
The report also cited student dis
content over the lack of an equiva
lent general breadth requirement in
math and science.
"I really believe that if we need'
to know about the classics, then we
also need to know about the earth
around us," said one student quoted
in the self study report. "Why a re
quired 'general education about hu
manities' course but not a required
'general education about your plan
et' course?"
Morris agreed that the program
would be more effective if it was ac
companied by a broader natural sci
ence and social science core.
"A lot of students think that there
must be something wrong with the
humanities if they have to be forced
to take this class when there is no
comparable sequence in natural or
social science," he said in the self
study report.
In light of the comments by stu
dents and faculty, the self-study re
port suggests recruiting faculty from
departments outside of the humani
ties, reducing the course units from 5

to 4 for each quarter and changing
section lengths from 90 to 51) min
utes. In addition, the report recom
mends modifying the grading policy
so that the grade for the first paper
each quarter will not count toward
the final grade. This change will en
able incoming students to learn what
is expected before instructors hold
them accountable.
1 HUM is not the only undergrad
uate program reviewing itself this
year. Last Friday was also the dead
line for a Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) 12-question survey,
to which more than 1.700 students
replied.
"It is important for every pro
gram to take a look at itself every
few years" said PWR Assistant Di
rector Alyssa O'Brien.
Hearing and addressing student
concerns is vital to PWR's success,
she said, and she expressed gratitude
to those students who shared their
opinions.
"We had a very good response to
the survey." said Marvin Diogenes,
associate director of PWR."It seems
like students are very interested in
giving feedback."
PWR directors hope the self
study will highlight areas that can be
improved in order to help students
meet their own goals as writers and
presenters. Members of the Under
graduate Advisory Board (UAB)
collaborated to recommend changes
to the PWR course description guide
with hopes of making it more read

able and adding reading lists. Mem
bers of the Board also helped phrase
the questions asked on the question
naire.
While PWR does not anticipate
that the self-study will result in rec
ommendations for a complete re
structuring of the program, as was
the case seven years ago, the results
and recommendations released in
May are likely to propose "refine
ment" to the current system, accord
ing to Diogenes.
The program is currently seeking
student volunteers in order to form
10 "focus groups" — eight to 10 stu
dents each — who will sit with the
group for an hour and express indi
vidual PWR experiences and voice
concerns. They will also respond to
more detailed questions that were
absent from the online question
naire. Interested students should
apply at www.stanford.edu/group/
pwrselfst udy/focusgroups. fft.
'ITiough PW R remains in the early
stages of its review, the completion of
the IHUM self-study does not mean
the end of the IHUM evaluation
process. ITiough the results for the
IIIIJM study are in. Corina lacopetti
4 09, a member of the IHUM UAG,
said that the group will continue to
meet and provide student feedback.
"Just because the study's done,"
she said, "doesn't mean that there is
nothing left to work on."

also need to know about the earth
around us," said one student quoted
in the self study report. "Why a re
quired 'general education about hu
manities' course but not a required
'general education about your plan
et' course?"
Morris agreed that the program
would be more effective if it was ac
companied by a broader natural sci
ence and social science core.
"A lot of students think that there
must be something wrong with the
humanities if they have to be forced
to take this class when there is no
comparable sequence in natural or
social science," he said in the self
study report.
In light of the comments by stu
dents and faculty, the self-study re
port suggests recruiting faculty from
departments outside of the humani
ties, reducing the course units from 5

to 4 for each quarter and changing
section lengths from 90 to 51) min
utes. In addition, the report recom
mends modifying the grading policy
so that the grade for the first paper
each quarter will not count toward
the final grade. This change will en
able incoming students to learn what
is expected before instructors hold
them accountable.
1 HUM is not the only undergrad
uate program reviewing itself this
year. Last Friday was also the dead
line for a Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) 12-question survey,
to which more than 1.700 students
replied.
"It is important for every pro
gram to take a look at itself every
few years" said PWR Assistant Di
rector Alyssa O'Brien.
Hearing and addressing student
concerns is vital to PWR's success,
she said, and she expressed gratitude
to those students who shared their
opinions.
"We had a very good response to
the survey." said Marvin Diogenes,
associate director of PWR."It seems
like students are very interested in
giving feedback."
PWR directors hope the self
study will highlight areas that can be
improved in order to help students
meet their own goals as writers and
presenters. Members of the Under
graduate Advisory Board (UAB)
collaborated to recommend changes
to the PWR course description guide
with hopes of making it more read

able and adding reading lists. Mem
bers of the Board also helped phrase
the questions asked on the question
naire.
While PWR does not anticipate
that the self-study will result in rec
ommendations for a complete re
structuring of the program, as was
the case seven years ago, the results
and recommendations released in
May are likely to propose "refine
ment" to the current system, accord
ing to Diogenes.
The program is currently seeking
student volunteers in order to form
10 "focus groups" — eight to 10 stu
dents each — who will sit with the
group for an hour and express indi
vidual PWR experiences and voice
concerns. They will also respond to
more detailed questions that were
absent from the online question
naire. Interested students should
apply at www.stanford.edu/group/
pwrselfst udy/focusgroups. fft.
'ITiough PW R remains in the early
stages of its review, the completion of
the IHUM self-study does not mean
the end of the IHUM evaluation
process. ITiough the results for the
IIIIJM study are in. Corina lacopetti
4 09, a member of the IHUM UAG,
said that the group will continue to
meet and provide student feedback.
"Just because the study's done,"
she said, "doesn't mean that there is
nothing left to work on."
