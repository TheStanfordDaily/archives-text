# IHUM changes coming
## New report prompts Faculty Senate vote on shorter sections, fewer units

Introduction to the 1 lumanities(lHUM)
classes will have shorter sections and be
worth fewer units next year, if the Faculty
Senate approves recommended changes.
The IlilJM Governing Board made its
decision last week after reviewing 1,283 un
dergraduate questionnaire responses and
professor reports in a comprehensive self

branded as "IHUM Kids." Respondents
also expressed problems arising from vary

model of two 50-minute discussion sec
tions" Berman said. "Discussions would be

come more targeted and efficient, and the
program would be less disruptive of student
schedules."
Classics Professor lan Morris, who
teaches Ancient Empires during winter
quarter, said that he thinks the current sec
tion length works well. He worried that a
shorter period would allow less time for dis
cussions to develop. But he acknowledged
that the 50-minute block could help main
tain engagement throughout the entire sec
tion.
The current section length stipulation is
a mandate of the Faculty Senate, but a pro
posal brought to the Senate by the Commit

(C-USP) this week seeks to put the section
