Britney Spears' ongoing tragic media
hi it/ confirmed what I began to sus
pect several years ago: after nearly a
quarter of a century of leading virtually iden
tical lives, my former twin and 1 have gone
our separate ways. Yet. despite the incidents
and accidents leading up to this week's re
volving rehab door, the definitive reality
comes as quite a shock to both of us. and
we're still trying to make sense of just how we
ended up here. Perhaps a timeline will help.
December 2,1981: Britney Jean Spears is
born in MeComb. Mississippi. Exactly six
months and twenty-eight days later. Lisa
Anne Mcndclman is born in Seattle. Wash
ington. ()ur parallel paths begin.
1986-1990: In addition to performing in
her local Baptist church choir. Britney excels
in gymnastics and enters numerous state
level competitions. In addition to performing
in Seattle's Northwest (iirlchoir (whose
Christmas concerts include a token
I lanukkah song), I excel on the mats at (iym
boree and spend many hours doing cart

wheels and somersaults.
1992: Britney makes her"Star Search"tel
evision debut and loses in the second round.
I audition for the role of the Doormouse in
the fifth grade play. "Alice in Wonderland."
and make it to callbacks. Britney picks her
self up and auditions for the I )isney < 'lianncl.
I pick myself up and accept the role of the
Four of I learts.
1993-1994: Britney joins thc"Nc\\ Mickc\
Mouse Club." where she performs alongside
future pop stars .lustin Timbcrlake and
Christina Aguilcra and actor Ryan Costing,
who is definitely much cuter now.

Born and raised without a'l'V. I turn to live
theater instead, performing in the Bala Cyn
wyd Middle School productions ot'"'llie I'aja

a Mattress." and"I low to Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying." My costars include
future hankers, lawyers and "Real World:
("liicago" drama queen Aneesa lerriera. who
was even more unpleasant in seventh grade.
1996-1998: Autumn goodbyes. Britney
abandons the all-girl teeny-hopper group In
nosense. makes a demo tape, and somehow,
someway, ends up touring with *NSync (as
they say in the business, it's all about who you
know — and who you're sleeping with). 1

2000: 00p5!... Britney does it
again (even our grammatical ten

tional tour (where, at Shoreline Am
phitheater, our paths come within a
hundred feet of intersection), her
mother generously co-authors her
best-selling book, "Britney Spears'
I leart-to-Heart." while my mother
dutifully proofreads even essay I
write for my English classes.
During a performance at the 2000
MTV Video Music Awards. Britney
rips off a black suit to reveal a
provocative nude-colored and crys
tal-adorned outfit. During my senior
prom, my mother receives a phone
call from my English teacher who in
forms her that I am literally falling
out of my black strapless prom dress.
Is it my fault that Britney got all of
the cleavage?
2002: Our sophomore slump.
"Crossroads." Britney's film debut,
fails at the box office (despite the
opening day attendance of myself,
my four friends, and three sketchy
middle-aged men). "The Real
World: Stanford," my Stanford stage
debut, fails to prevent hundreds of
freshmen from consuming alcohol.

Britney and Justin break up and
she declines to answer questions
about her virginity (though she says
she thought he was the one). My first
Stanford relationship ends after three
weeks and I happily discuss the inti
mate details with all of my girl friends
(and most anyone who will listen).
2003: Not a girl, not yet a woman.
Britney admits she slept with Justin
two years into their relationship. I
admit 1 still sleep with my Teddy
bear. Minty (who. for the record, still
shares my bed).
2004: A banner year for both of
us. I.as Vegas hosts Britney's alco
hol-infused 55-hour marriage and
my alcohol-infused 48-hour Memor
ial Day weekend. I earn my BA; Brit
ney earns her (second) MRS. Within
weeks of marriage to Kl'ed. Britney
announces her desire to start a fami
ly. Within weeks of graduation from
Stanford. 1 announce my desire to
move out of my parents' house.
2005: Our paths diverge. Britney
takes a career break and has her first
child. I enter the working world and
decide not to have children for at
least 10 years.
2006: Footloose and panty-free.
The paparazzi snap with glee as Brit
ney drives with her son on her lap,
nearly drops him, and, following her
second pregnancy and divorce an
nouncement. heads out on the town
with new friend Paris Hilton. The
tabloids buzz with tit illation.
My ninth grade students gossip
with glee as I bring a male date to
winter formal, dance with him from a
safe distance of five feet, and borrow
his jacket when we walk outside. The
faculty room on Monday morning
hums with excitement.
2007: After weeks of publicity sur
rounding late-night partying, alcohol,
and possible drug use. Britney shaves
her head (the remnants of which are

currently for sale online). gets several
new tattoos, and checks herself in and
out of her second rehab facility in
under a week. After weeks of
going to bed before 11, sipping the oc
casional white wine spritzer, and tak
ing Vitamin C to stave off a cold, I get
a half-inch trim (the remnants of
which were thrown out within min
utes) and finish my column within
hours of my deadline. Fortunately, if
Brit has taught me anything over the
past 25 years, it's that, sometimes,
we're stronger on our own.

Britney Spears' ongoing tragic media
hi it/ confirmed what I began to sus
pect several years ago: after nearly a
quarter of a century of leading virtually iden
tical lives, my former twin and 1 have gone
our separate ways. Yet. despite the incidents
and accidents leading up to this week's re
volving rehab door, the definitive reality
comes as quite a shock to both of us. and
we're still trying to make sense of just how we
ended up here. Perhaps a timeline will help.
December 2,1981: Britney Jean Spears is
born in MeComb. Mississippi. Exactly six
months and twenty-eight days later. Lisa
Anne Mcndclman is born in Seattle. Wash
ington. ()ur parallel paths begin.
1986-1990: In addition to performing in
her local Baptist church choir. Britney excels
in gymnastics and enters numerous state
level competitions. In addition to performing
in Seattle's Northwest (iirlchoir (whose
Christmas concerts include a token
I lanukkah song), I excel on the mats at (iym
boree and spend many hours doing cart

wheels and somersaults.
1992: Britney makes her"Star Search"tel
evision debut and loses in the second round.
I audition for the role of the Doormouse in
the fifth grade play. "Alice in Wonderland."
and make it to callbacks. Britney picks her
self up and auditions for the I )isney < 'lianncl.
I pick myself up and accept the role of the
Four of I learts.
1993-1994: Britney joins thc"Nc\\ Mickc\
Mouse Club." where she performs alongside
future pop stars .lustin Timbcrlake and
Christina Aguilcra and actor Ryan Costing,
who is definitely much cuter now.

Born and raised without a'l'V. I turn to live
theater instead, performing in the Bala Cyn
wyd Middle School productions ot'"'llie I'aja
ma (iame,""Romeoand Juliet.""( )nee I Jpon
a Mattress." and"I low to Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying." My costars include
future hankers, lawyers and "Real World:
("liicago" drama queen Aneesa lerriera. who
was even more unpleasant in seventh grade.
1996-1998: Autumn goodbyes. Britney
abandons the all-girl teeny-hopper group In
nosense. makes a demo tape, and somehow,
someway, ends up touring with *NSync (as
they say in the business, it's all about who you
know — and who you're sleeping with). 1
