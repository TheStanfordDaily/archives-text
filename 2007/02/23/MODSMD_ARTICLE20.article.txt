Britney Spears' ongoing tragic media
hi it/ confirmed what I began to sus
pect several years ago: after nearly a
quarter of a century of leading virtually iden
tical lives, my former twin and 1 have gone
our separate ways. Yet. despite the incidents
and accidents leading up to this week's re
volving rehab door, the definitive reality
comes as quite a shock to both of us. and
we're still trying to make sense of just how we
ended up here. Perhaps a timeline will help.
December 2,1981: Britney Jean Spears is
born in MeComb. Mississippi. Exactly six
months and twenty-eight days later. Lisa
Anne Mcndclman is born in Seattle. Wash
ington. ()ur parallel paths begin.
1986-1990: In addition to performing in
her local Baptist church choir. Britney excels
in gymnastics and enters numerous state
level competitions. In addition to performing
in Seattle's Northwest (iirlchoir (whose
Christmas concerts include a token
I lanukkah song), I excel on the mats at (iym
boree and spend many hours doing cart

wheels and somersaults.
1992: Britney makes her"Star Search"tel
evision debut and loses in the second round.
I audition for the role of the Doormouse in
the fifth grade play. "Alice in Wonderland."
and make it to callbacks. Britney picks her
self up and auditions for the I )isney < 'lianncl.
I pick myself up and accept the role of the
Four of I learts.
1993-1994: Britney joins thc"Nc\\ Mickc\
Mouse Club." where she performs alongside
future pop stars .lustin Timbcrlake and
Christina Aguilcra and actor Ryan Costing,
who is definitely much cuter now.

Born and raised without a'l'V. I turn to live
theater instead, performing in the Bala Cyn
wyd Middle School productions ot'"'llie I'aja
ma (iame,""Romeoand Juliet.""( )nee I Jpon
a Mattress." and"I low to Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying." My costars include
future hankers, lawyers and "Real World:
("liicago" drama queen Aneesa lerriera. who
was even more unpleasant in seventh grade.
1996-1998: Autumn goodbyes. Britney
abandons the all-girl teeny-hopper group In
nosense. makes a demo tape, and somehow,
someway, ends up touring with *NSync (as
they say in the business, it's all about who you
know — and who you're sleeping with). 1
abandon the l ast Coast, make tracks to Cal
ilornia. and somehow, someway, end up at
I'alo Alto I ligh School (as they say in public
school, it's all about who your parents are —
and where you live).
1998-1999; Britney's single."... Baby One
More lime." debuts on the pop charts, hits
