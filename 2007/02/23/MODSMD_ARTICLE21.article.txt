# Forget designer dogs— who wants a griffin?
## 
### 
Thc panda-dog is a reality. Colombo,
named after the ('olombo, belongs to a
male beautician who lives in Tokyo.
Colombo enjoys long city walks, sniffing
through the bamboo garden around the cor
ner from his home. and. if the videos on
Google offer a clue, giving excessive snout
to-mouth. panda-doggie kisses to his owner.
Colombo is not actually a panda-dog hy
brid. but he does represent a bizarre trend.
More and more pet owners arc interested in
owning unique animals. Sometimes this
uniqueness is achieved via a creative dye-job, as
is the case for Colombo. Sometimes this
uniqueness is achieved via creative breeding, as
is the case for another dog by the name of kiko.
Kiko is a Japanese-bred blue Chihuahua
who is the product of his dad mating with his
dad's sister, then his daughter, then his grand
daughter. and then his great granddaughter.
Alter four generations of unrelenting incest.
Kiko is the equivalent of a l.ouis Vuitton
epileathcr camera bag to the pet-obsessed
Japanese populace.
Smaller than the already quite small stan
dard Chihuahua. Kiko's blue coat fetches
him <i price of roughly $2.()(H). Not a small fee
considered that one-year-old Kiko is already
partially blind and showing signs of mental
degradation — she has a tendency to walk
into walls repeatedly.
Kiko's lack of mental faculty is quite com

mon with the new generation of designer
dogs that Japan is pumping out with the kind
of joyless abandon that can only be found in
a culture that developed square watermelons
and robotic cats.
However, when dogs are quickly bred
with close relatives for many generations in
hopes of bringing out recessive qualities, side
effects arc quite common. Irresponsible
breeders have produced litters with pups that
have missing noses, malformed legs or ex
posed spines.'lhcsc puppies arc killed or die
before the weaning period.
Specialized dogs are only the beginning.
Japan has already experimented with cross
ing various species naturally, producing one
of the first ligons(a lion-tiger hybrid) in mod
ern history Hie next logical step is chimeras.
Chimeras arc artificially produced by
mixing cells from two different organisms.
Ihis process can result in the eventual devel

opment ol an adult animal composed ofcclls
from both donors, which may be of different
species. Boring example animals from the
past include geeps (goat-sheep) and rouses
(rat-mice).
In August 2003. researchers at the Shang
hai Second Medical University in China re
ported that they had successfully fused
human skin cells and rabbit eggs to create the
lirst human chimeric embryos. Unfortunate
ly lor the rare-breed seeker,ethical codes of
conduct forbid the development of the
"ruban past early embryonic stages.
Japanese media has glommed onto the
possibility of chimeras and has speculated
about the prospect of creating mythical ani
mals. Unicorns, griffins, jack-a-lopes and the
like seem in reach to the loaded buyer. For
now. animals can only be genetically fused
with similar species, but it may not be long
be I ore the development of a real panda-dog.
'liere is something perverse about the
synthetic production of new animals. At a
time when delorestation and habitat destruc
tion are annihilating the world's biodiversity,
a fascination with producing new animals is
disturbing. A grillin. no matter how great a
sn mbol ol technological know-how, is no sub
stitute for a tiger.

cination with real unique animals.
Growing up watching safari trips on
the Discovery Channel and visiting
the zoo has left us inured to fish that
breath air. octopuses that kill you
with a single tentacle and whales
with doodles the size of a basketball
player.
What a bummer. Hopefully,
when these animals go extinct, we
will be able to rekindle the rever
ence for them that currently is re
served only for genetically engi
neered jack-a-lopes, dinosaurs and
panda-dogs.
