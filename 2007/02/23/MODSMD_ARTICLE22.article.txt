## All-Stars all-out bore 
### 
How did you spend your Sun
day evening? I'll tell you how
I spent mine: not watching
the NBA "All-Star" Game.
Really, 1 just don't get these
things. The West's 153-132 victory
over the East only heightened the
way that 1 generally feel about these
games.
The run n gun-type score is rather
deceiving, too. You would think that
the game was filled with excitement,
intensity and passion, hut it wasn't.
l"hen again, who am I to talk? I didn't
watch the game.
Although the three-point compe
tition and Slam Dunk Contest can
provide a quick fix of entertainment
at times, there is no other function
that could possibly make some of the
greatest athletes in the world play in
such an inconsequential and unin
spired game.
I love basketball. It's the one
sport that 1 probably couldn't do
without. But I could definitely do
without the current state of the
NBA's All-Star game.
The game means nothing. It
means so little that they had to play
in Las Vegas to add that extra bit of
glitz.
And it isn't just the NBA that's
stinking up the All-Star scene. You
don't have to look any further than
just a week ago, after the Super


Jack
Salisbury
Above the Rim
Bowl. Apparently, the Pro Bowl was
actually played, with the AFC win
ning 31-28. I just read this in Sports
Illustrated, though: I wasn't actually
aware of the game.
Hie original intention of All-Star
games isn't beyond me. I understand
that they're a great way to bring a
sport's best athletes together. They
also generate a whole lot of revenue.
After all. a league is nothing more
than a business when it comes right
down to it.
All-Star moments are often em
bedded in sports history: Will anyone
ever forget Michael Jordan's dunk
from the free-throw line during the
1998 All-Star Weekend?
But the current execution of the
All-Star games, in pretty much every
sport besides baseball, just isn't
working.
No one is allowed to blitz in the
Pro Bowl. No one plays defense in the
NBA All-Star game. Barely anyone
checks in for the NHL All-Star game.

Of course, there are reasons be
hind this. It would be silly for super
star players to get injured in games
that technically don't mean any
thing. What would Jerry Buss have to
say if Kobe Bryant tore his Achilles
while making a cut in a game that
had no bearing on the Lakers' sea
son?
But this reasoning doesn't change
the fact that the games just aren't
worth watching.
All-Star games simply lack ener
gy and excitement, so they just aren't
that entertaining. Sure. All-Star
games will always retain their novel
ty in some way — I do admit that it's
kind of cool to see Yao and Kobe on
the same squad and whatnot, but
they don't deserve the kind of atten
tion that they get.
If you ask me. the NBA. NHL and
NI L could all take a cue from MLB.
Baseball is the only sport with its All-
Star game still intact, liven though
the match-up has always meant
more because of the historical rival
ry between the National and Ameri
can Leagues, baseball's All-Star
game has always been, and remains,
the best.
In recent years, the "Midsummer

Classic" was spiced up with the stip
ulation that the winning side would
win home-field advantage for their
League in the World Series. I do
admit that's a bit tacky, but it did
rekindle the rivalry between the two
sides: The disgruntled National
League fan still finds the time to tune
in each July, despite the fact that the
NL has been winless for the last 10
years. The prize of World Series
home-field advantage has made for a
much more important and exciting
game.
1 think that the other sports could
immensely improve their All-Star
game by doing something similar.
And make no mistake about it:
Something has to be done to shake
up the current state of the other All-
Star games.
1 would try and come up with con
crete suggestions to improve the
NBA. NHL and NFL All-Star games.
But then again, that isn't my job.
I happen to find my position of
armchair quarterback rather com
fortable.
