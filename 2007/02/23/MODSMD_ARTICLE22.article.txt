## All-Stars all-out bore 
### 
How did you spend your Sun
day evening? I'll tell you how
I spent mine: not watching
the NBA "All-Star" Game.
Really, 1 just don't get these
things. The West's 153-132 victory
over the East only heightened the
way that 1 generally feel about these
games.
The run n gun-type score is rather
deceiving, too. You would think that
the game was filled with excitement,
intensity and passion, hut it wasn't.
l"hen again, who am I to talk? I didn't
watch the game.
Although the three-point compe
tition and Slam Dunk Contest can
provide a quick fix of entertainment
at times, there is no other function
that could possibly make some of the
greatest athletes in the world play in
such an inconsequential and unin
spired game.
I love basketball. It's the one
sport that 1 probably couldn't do
without. But I could definitely do
without the current state of the
NBA's All-Star game.
The game means nothing. It
means so little that they had to play
in Las Vegas to add that extra bit of
glitz.
And it isn't just the NBA that's
stinking up the All-Star scene. You
don't have to look any further than
just a week ago, after the Super
