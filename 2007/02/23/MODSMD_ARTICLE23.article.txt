the regular season came down to the last
few minutes. With 5:45 remaining, the No.
8 Stanford women's basketball team fi
nally pulled away from UCLA to win 65-
54 last night.
"We had to work especially hard,"
head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"[UCLA] has a big, athletic team. I'm
proud of how hard our team played."
Freshman center Jayne Appel led all
scorers with 24 points: she also pulled
down nine rebounds and notched four
blocks on the night. Senior forward
Brooke Smith added 14 points and seven

cific- 10 Conference) claimed a share of
the conference title and clinched a No. I
playoff seed.
Smith saw Appel as Stanford's key
player in the second half.

wanted to get the ball to her and let her go
to work."
