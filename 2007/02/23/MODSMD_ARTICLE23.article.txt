The Cardinal's second-to-last game of
the regular season came down to the last
few minutes. With 5:45 remaining, the No.
8 Stanford women's basketball team fi
nally pulled away from UCLA to win 65-
54 last night.
"We had to work especially hard,"
head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"[UCLA] has a big, athletic team. I'm
proud of how hard our team played."
Freshman center Jayne Appel led all
scorers with 24 points: she also pulled
down nine rebounds and notched four
blocks on the night. Senior forward
Brooke Smith added 14 points and seven
rebounds as the Cardinal (24-4. 16-1 Pa
cific- 10 Conference) claimed a share of
the conference title and clinched a No. I
playoff seed.
Smith saw Appel as Stanford's key
player in the second half.
"We just wanted to go inside to Jayne,"
Smith said. "She had an advantage, so we
wanted to get the ball to her and let her go
to work."
