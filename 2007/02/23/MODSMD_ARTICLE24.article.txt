# Stanford eyes Jayhawks series win
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After winning the final game of
its Texas series in wild fashion. 10-
8. and capitalizing on strong pitch
ing in Tuesday's victory over USF.
Stanford baseball enters this week

end's home series against Kansas
with a measure of momentum on
its side.
Given some of their struggles to
start the season, junior catcher
Brian Juhl and the Cardinal (4-5)
will take any psychological edge
they can get.

"l think we have a lot of mo
mentum coming off of Sunday's
big win against Texas, and Tuesday
was a good win too." Juhl said. "I
think we're feeling a lot more con
fident after those two wins — it al
ways helps if you can get wins
under your belt. We've had success

against Kansas in the past, so I
think that helps, too."
Stanford's successful streak
against Kansas (7-1) was tem
pered.somewhat, when the visiting
Jayhawks took two of three from
the Cardinal after having been
swept the previous two years. As
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
explained. Kansas has been a team
on the rise in recent seasons.
"They played very well last
year." Marquess said. "They beat
us two out of three here, when we
had just swept Fullerton. and peo
ple were like.'Jeez, how did Kansas
beat you?' Well, they ended up
winning the Big 12 Championship
and went on to Regionals. They've
done a really good job of turning
that program around — they're
very good, they're very talented."
One key issue for this week
end's series and the rest of the year
is Stanford's starting pitching,
which started the season inconsis
tently. Despite knocking in 54 runs
in just 10 games, the Cardinal re
mains below the .500 mark enter
ing its series with the Jayhawks. As
Marquess stresses, because so
many teams in the Pacific-10 Con
ference lost some of their best
pitchers after last season, "every
one's in the same boat." Juhl,
though, believes the Cardinal has
the talent to be as successful on the
mound as it has been at the plate
this season.

GAME NOTES Stanford has won two in a
row, after defeating the Dons 4-1 and
Texas in a wild, 10-8 game in Austin. The
Cardinal is 7-2 all time against the Jay
hawks, after first facing them in 2004.
Kansas won last year's series, though, 2
games to 1. The Cardinal have been led
so far this season by their offense, which
boasts five regular starters hitting over
.300. Kansas is coming off of a series

from the Jackrabbits in the Metrodome.

only had two or three series, so it's
still early.and guys are still working
on things. I think we need a little
more concentration,and they need
to trust their stuff basically. All our
pitchers have good stuff,so that's a
big thing — if they trust their stuff
they'll get guys out."
