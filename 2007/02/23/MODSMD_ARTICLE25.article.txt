## Wrestling hunts for first Pac-10 title "Nothing else really matters going into the tournament." 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling didn't have much
time for reflection after a tough. 23-20 loss
to Arizona State last Friday ended its dual
meet regular season.This weekend s Pacific
-10 Conference Championships have been
on the minds of every starter on the team
since the season began in November, and
head coach Kerry McCoy wants it that way.
"We're still working, and. ultimately, its
all about our guys being ready next week.
McCoy said after the dual against the Sun
Devils. "And they will be. They've got the
right attitude, and it's disappointing right

this match."

NCAA wrestling team since at least 1933
and has never won a conference champi
onship. the second-year Cardinal coach is
probably right. And he's focused his team's
entire training schedule around making sure
it wrestles its best this weekend. After an en
tire year of training, tournaments and duals,
the tournament will be the ultimate test for
Stanford and every other team in the Pac-10.
"We've been working on keeping them
sharp â€” crisp drilling, getting technique

down, a little bit of conditioning and a little
bit of strength training," McCoy said. "But
really, it's just been about letting their bodies
recover to be fresh when they get out there.
We're not going to do a whole lot of activity
because we want them to be hungry."
Among the Cardinal wrestlers who war

junior Josh Zupancic, who lost a close
match, 3-1, to Arizona State's No. 4 Brian
Stith at 157 pounds. Zupancic believes he
