# WRESTLING
## Wrestling hunts for first Pac-10 title "Nothing else really matters going into the tournament." 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling didn't have much
time for reflection after a tough. 23-20 loss
to Arizona State last Friday ended its dual
meet regular season.This weekend s Pacific
-10 Conference Championships have been
on the minds of every starter on the team
since the season began in November, and
head coach Kerry McCoy wants it that way.
"We're still working, and. ultimately, its
all about our guys being ready next week.
McCoy said after the dual against the Sun
Devils. "And they will be. They've got the
right attitude, and it's disappointing right
now. but if we go to the Pac-lOs and we do
real well there, no one is going to remember

this match."
Given that Stanford has fielded an
NCAA wrestling team since at least 1933
and has never won a conference champi
onship. the second-year Cardinal coach is
probably right. And he's focused his team's
entire training schedule around making sure
it wrestles its best this weekend. After an en
tire year of training, tournaments and duals,
the tournament will be the ultimate test for
Stanford and every other team in the Pac-10.
"We've been working on keeping them
sharp — crisp drilling, getting technique

down, a little bit of conditioning and a little
bit of strength training," McCoy said. "But
really, it's just been about letting their bodies
recover to be fresh when they get out there.
We're not going to do a whole lot of activity
because we want them to be hungry."
Among the Cardinal wrestlers who war
rant closer scrutiny this weekend is No. 15
junior Josh Zupancic, who lost a close
match, 3-1, to Arizona State's No. 4 Brian
Stith at 157 pounds. Zupancic believes he

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal will travel
to Cal State Bakersfield for the critical
Pac-10 Championships this weekend, which will deter
mine the final standings for Stanford in the Pac-10,
while individuals can qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships by placing in the top three. Five Stanford
wrestlers enter the tournament ranked in the Poc-10
with No. 3 Tanner Gardner and No. 15 Josh Zupancic
ranked nationally. Gardner will be the Cardinal's lone
top seed at the Roc-10 Championships.
and the rest of the team are ready for
the challenges of the Pac-10 Cham
pionships.
"I just need to improve on a cou
ple of the losses I've had and get a
good game plan for the guys I'm
going to be wrestling," Zupancic
said. "I think if all our weights wres
tle well.especially our strong weights
like 165, 174. 125 and 184. we're
going to be in a good position in the
conference."
No. 3 junior Tanner Gardner at
125 pounds enters the tournament as
the lone Stanford wrestler ranked
atop his weight class in the Pac-10
and is in a unique position among
Cardinal wrestlers, looking beyond
the upcoming tournament to the na
tional championships.
"Tanner just hastogoout and put
himself in a good situation to win na
tionals." McCoy said. "Not that he's
overlooking anybody, because he
can't take anyone lightly, but it's re
ally about getting out there and im
proving himself. Unless something
crazy happens, we expect he'll be the
Pac-10 Champion this year and be
challenging for the national title."
For the rest of the Stanford squad,
though, this weekend means every
thing to their season, individually and
as a team. Freshman Zack Giesen
racked up an impressive 27 wins on
the season at 1 «S4 pounds, the third
best mark all-time for a Stanford
freshman. According to Giesen. how

ever, his focus has been preparing for
the Pac-10 tournament all season.
"The record and everything,
nothing else really matters going
into the tournament." the true-fresh
man said. "It just helps having guys
like Kerry and [volunteer assistant
Matt Gentry]. I've never been in this
situation before, so I'll just be walk
ing through things, and try and work
hard this week and be ready to go."
Sophomore Luke Feist at 174
pounds was one of the Cardinal's
few bright spots against the Sun
Devils last weekend and will look to
build on the momentum of a solid
24-14 season in the conference tour
nament.
"I just need to stay confident and
know that I can wrestle with some of
these guys who have beaten me in
the past and not beat myself," Feist
said at practice on Monday. "1 think
I've gotten better in pretty much all
areas this year. I think I've improved
a lot — but just in the mental part. I

McCoy said on Monday that, with
the exception of injuries, his team is
where he wanted it to be at this point
in the season. Senior Brian Perry at
165 pounds and sophomore Jared
Boyer at l l )7 pounds, both of whom
are team captains, have missed sig
nificant time lately.
Boyer, recovering from a shoul
der injury, is probably the more like
ly Stanford wrestler to miss the Pac
-10 tournament. McCoy said on Mon
day, however, that he expects both to
be ready to go on Saturday at Cal
State-Bakersfield. The tournament
will begin at 11 a.m. tomorrow and
wrap up with championship bouts
scheduled for 6 p.m. on Sunday. All

Stanford wrestling didn't have much
time for reflection after a tough. 23-20 loss
to Arizona State last Friday ended its dual
meet regular season.This weekend s Pacific
-10 Conference Championships have been
on the minds of every starter on the team
since the season began in November, and
head coach Kerry McCoy wants it that way.
"We're still working, and. ultimately, its
all about our guys being ready next week.
McCoy said after the dual against the Sun
Devils. "And they will be. They've got the
right attitude, and it's disappointing right
now. but if we go to the Pac-lOs and we do
real well there, no one is going to remember

this match."
Given that Stanford has fielded an
NCAA wrestling team since at least 1933
and has never won a conference champi
onship. the second-year Cardinal coach is
probably right. And he's focused his team's
entire training schedule around making sure
it wrestles its best this weekend. After an en
tire year of training, tournaments and duals,
the tournament will be the ultimate test for
Stanford and every other team in the Pac-10.
"We've been working on keeping them
sharp — crisp drilling, getting technique

down, a little bit of conditioning and a little
bit of strength training," McCoy said. "But
really, it's just been about letting their bodies
recover to be fresh when they get out there.
We're not going to do a whole lot of activity
because we want them to be hungry."
Among the Cardinal wrestlers who war
rant closer scrutiny this weekend is No. 15
junior Josh Zupancic, who lost a close
match, 3-1, to Arizona State's No. 4 Brian
Stith at 157 pounds. Zupancic believes he

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal will travel
to Cal State Bakersfield for the critical
Pac-10 Championships this weekend, which will deter
mine the final standings for Stanford in the Pac-10,
while individuals can qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships by placing in the top three. Five Stanford
wrestlers enter the tournament ranked in the Poc-10
with No. 3 Tanner Gardner and No. 15 Josh Zupancic
ranked nationally. Gardner will be the Cardinal's lone
top seed at the Roc-10 Championships.
and the rest of the team are ready for
the challenges of the Pac-10 Cham
pionships.
"I just need to improve on a cou
ple of the losses I've had and get a
good game plan for the guys I'm
going to be wrestling," Zupancic
said. "I think if all our weights wres
tle well.especially our strong weights
like 165, 174. 125 and 184. we're
going to be in a good position in the
conference."
No. 3 junior Tanner Gardner at
125 pounds enters the tournament as
the lone Stanford wrestler ranked
atop his weight class in the Pac-10
and is in a unique position among
Cardinal wrestlers, looking beyond
the upcoming tournament to the na
tional championships.
"Tanner just hastogoout and put
himself in a good situation to win na
tionals." McCoy said. "Not that he's
overlooking anybody, because he
can't take anyone lightly, but it's re
ally about getting out there and im
proving himself. Unless something
crazy happens, we expect he'll be the
Pac-10 Champion this year and be
challenging for the national title."
For the rest of the Stanford squad,
though, this weekend means every
thing to their season, individually and
as a team. Freshman Zack Giesen
racked up an impressive 27 wins on
the season at 1 «S4 pounds, the third
best mark all-time for a Stanford
freshman. According to Giesen. how

ever, his focus has been preparing for
the Pac-10 tournament all season.
"The record and everything,
nothing else really matters going
into the tournament." the true-fresh
man said. "It just helps having guys
like Kerry and [volunteer assistant
Matt Gentry]. I've never been in this
situation before, so I'll just be walk
ing through things, and try and work
hard this week and be ready to go."
Sophomore Luke Feist at 174
pounds was one of the Cardinal's
few bright spots against the Sun
Devils last weekend and will look to
build on the momentum of a solid
24-14 season in the conference tour
nament.
"I just need to stay confident and
know that I can wrestle with some of
these guys who have beaten me in
the past and not beat myself," Feist
said at practice on Monday. "1 think
I've gotten better in pretty much all
areas this year. I think I've improved
a lot — but just in the mental part. I

ner will] be the Pac-10 Champion this year and be

need to wrestle like I do in here out
there."
McCoy said on Monday that, with
the exception of injuries, his team is
where he wanted it to be at this point
in the season. Senior Brian Perry at
165 pounds and sophomore Jared
Boyer at l l )7 pounds, both of whom
are team captains, have missed sig
nificant time lately.
Boyer, recovering from a shoul
der injury, is probably the more like
ly Stanford wrestler to miss the Pac
-10 tournament. McCoy said on Mon
day, however, that he expects both to
be ready to go on Saturday at Cal
State-Bakersfield. The tournament
will begin at 11 a.m. tomorrow and
wrap up with championship bouts
scheduled for 6 p.m. on Sunday. All
