Long road stretch for No. 2 women's water
polo begins in Irvine
After knocking off powerful Southern
California and Cal State-Northridce last
weekend in the comfort of their
own pool, the members of the
women's water polo team are ready
to hit the road — for a long time.
The No. 2 Cardinal (7-1, 4-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) will not compete at the Avery
Aquatic Center for more than a
month (it next plays at home on
March 24 against Princeton). The
Stanford squad's first destination
on the road is Irvine, Calif., where it
will participate in this weekend's
Irvine Invitational.
Having swapped rankings with
the Women of Troy after last week
end's competition, the Cardinal is
looking forward to the chance to
show once again that it is one of the
toughest teams in the nation. But
despite the outcome of their dra
matic overtime victory against
USC, the Stanford women were
quick to acknowledge that much
work still remains to be done in re
fining their game.
"[We] felt incredibly prepared to
be playing [USC because] our
coaches did such an extensive
analysis that we were ready for any
thing," freshman Kelly Eaton said.
"But because we still have several
things we want to improve on from
our last game, we will all be ex
tremely excited if and when we play
them again."
Stanford also got an added boost
of confidence from the fact that it
managed to defeat USC in an early
season meeting — something the
Cardinal has not been able to do in
recent years.
"We haven't beaten them this
early in the season in the last couple
of years, so it was great to be able to
play with them for a whole game,"
junior driver Jackie Gauthier said.
Gauthier and the rest of her
teammates hope to keep the mo
mentum rolling when they open the
Irvine Invitational tomorrow
against Michigan at 11:30 a.m. Fol
lowing the game, the Cardinal will
play either San Jose State or Ari
zona State, both of which it has al
ready beaten by convincing margins
this season, and will potentially play
for a spot in the tournament's semi
final game.The invitational will con
clude on Sunday with another dou

bleheader for the Cardinal.

Men's golf cruises into Puerto Rico
Classic Tournament
Following its phenomenal start to
the spring season with a big win at
the 17th annual University of
Hawaii-Hilo Invitational, the Stan
ford men's golf team will travel to
Rio Grande, Puerto Rico to partici
pate in the three-day Puerto Rico
Classic Tournament hosted by Pur
due University, beginning this Sun
day.
"We were really excited to bring
home the first place win from
Hawaii," head coach Conrad Ray
said. "The fact that we were able to
catch Oklahoma State and beat
some premier teams is great. The
guys really focused, especially [jun
ior] Rob Grube who had a great last
day. Coming off of our success in
Hawaii, the Waikoloa golf course in
Hawaii is fairly similar to the golf
course in Puerto Rico. There are
many birdies on these types of
courses. Whoever wins will have to
play well next week."
The Cardinal faces stiff competi
tion on the par-72 course. Fifteen of
the 18 participating teams are
ranked in the top 50 nationally by
Golfweek magazine. No. 2 Stanford
will most notably challenge top
ranked Florida. No. 4 Oklahoma
State. No. 5 Georgia and No. 6 Al
abama. Last year. Georgia took the
Puerto Rico Classic title with a team
score of 843. Though the Cardinal
will compete against quality oppo
nents, Ray is confident going into
the tournament.
"We are treating it like any other
event," Ray said. "It is a bonus that
some of the top teams will be there
because the guys work all year for
events like this."
Stanford will need to field strong
individual performances next week
to keep with some of the top golfers
in the country. Seven of the top 15
individual players in the country
(according to Golfweek magazine)
will participate in the Puerto Rico
Classic, including No. 3 Billy
Horschel and No. 8 Manuel Villegas
of Florida: No. 4 Chris Kirk and No.
5 Brian Harman of Georgia; No. 13
Pablo Martin of Oklahoma State;
and Stanford's own No. 9 senior
Zack Miller.
"They guys have as good of a
chance as anyone in the individual

competition." Ray said "The focus is
really on the team aspect of the com
petition. If the Stanford team plays
well, then individual success will be
soon to follow."
Because many of the leading
teams in the nation will participate
at the Puerto Rico Classic. Ray says
this is will serve as a good preview
for the NCAA tournament.
"We are going to try to do the
same things that we did in Hawaii,"
he said. "We are trying to gain some
momentum going to Puerto Rico.
The team will have to perform well
on such a big stage. This will be a
good preparation for the NCAA
tournament and an indicator of
what we will have to work on to
achieve our goal of taking the
NCAA championship."

Long road stretch for No. 2 women's water
polo begins in Irvine
After knocking off powerful Southern
California and Cal State-Northridce last
weekend in the comfort of their
own pool, the members of the
women's water polo team are ready
to hit the road — for a long time.
The No. 2 Cardinal (7-1, 4-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) will not compete at the Avery
Aquatic Center for more than a
month (it next plays at home on
March 24 against Princeton). The
Stanford squad's first destination
on the road is Irvine, Calif., where it
will participate in this weekend's
Irvine Invitational.
Having swapped rankings with
the Women of Troy after last week
end's competition, the Cardinal is
looking forward to the chance to
show once again that it is one of the
toughest teams in the nation. But
despite the outcome of their dra
matic overtime victory against
USC, the Stanford women were
quick to acknowledge that much
work still remains to be done in re
fining their game.
"[We] felt incredibly prepared to
be playing [USC because] our
coaches did such an extensive
analysis that we were ready for any
thing," freshman Kelly Eaton said.
"But because we still have several
things we want to improve on from
our last game, we will all be ex
tremely excited if and when we play
them again."
Stanford also got an added boost
of confidence from the fact that it
managed to defeat USC in an early
season meeting — something the
Cardinal has not been able to do in
recent years.
"We haven't beaten them this
early in the season in the last couple
of years, so it was great to be able to
play with them for a whole game,"
junior driver Jackie Gauthier said.
Gauthier and the rest of her
teammates hope to keep the mo
mentum rolling when they open the
Irvine Invitational tomorrow
against Michigan at 11:30 a.m. Fol
lowing the game, the Cardinal will
play either San Jose State or Ari
zona State, both of which it has al
ready beaten by convincing margins
this season, and will potentially play
for a spot in the tournament's semi
final game.The invitational will con

Classic Tournament
Following its phenomenal start to
the spring season with a big win at
the 17th annual University of
Hawaii-Hilo Invitational, the Stan
ford men's golf team will travel to
Rio Grande, Puerto Rico to partici
pate in the three-day Puerto Rico
Classic Tournament hosted by Pur
due University, beginning this Sun
day.
"We were really excited to bring
home the first place win from
Hawaii," head coach Conrad Ray
said. "The fact that we were able to
catch Oklahoma State and beat
some premier teams is great. The
guys really focused, especially [jun
ior] Rob Grube who had a great last
day. Coming off of our success in
Hawaii, the Waikoloa golf course in
Hawaii is fairly similar to the golf
course in Puerto Rico. There are
many birdies on these types of
courses. Whoever wins will have to
play well next week."
The Cardinal faces stiff competi
tion on the par-72 course. Fifteen of
the 18 participating teams are
ranked in the top 50 nationally by
Golfweek magazine. No. 2 Stanford
will most notably challenge top
ranked Florida. No. 4 Oklahoma
State. No. 5 Georgia and No. 6 Al
abama. Last year. Georgia took the
Puerto Rico Classic title with a team
score of 843. Though the Cardinal
will compete against quality oppo
nents, Ray is confident going into
the tournament.
"We are treating it like any other
event," Ray said. "It is a bonus that
some of the top teams will be there
because the guys work all year for
events like this."
Stanford will need to field strong
individual performances next week
to keep with some of the top golfers
in the country. Seven of the top 15
individual players in the country
(according to Golfweek magazine)
will participate in the Puerto Rico
Classic, including No. 3 Billy
Horschel and No. 8 Manuel Villegas
of Florida: No. 4 Chris Kirk and No.
5 Brian Harman of Georgia; No. 13
Pablo Martin of Oklahoma State;
and Stanford's own No. 9 senior
Zack Miller.
"They guys have as good of a
chance as anyone in the individual

competition." Ray said "The focus is
really on the team aspect of the com
petition. If the Stanford team plays
well, then individual success will be
soon to follow."
Because many of the leading
teams in the nation will participate
at the Puerto Rico Classic. Ray says
this is will serve as a good preview
for the NCAA tournament.
"We are going to try to do the
same things that we did in Hawaii,"
he said. "We are trying to gain some
momentum going to Puerto Rico.
The team will have to perform well
on such a big stage. This will be a
good preparation for the NCAA
tournament and an indicator of
what we will have to work on to
achieve our goal of taking the
NCAA championship."

losing streak. The Wildcats boast
one player ranked in singles — No.
89 junior Claudio Christen.
The Cardinal altered its doubles
lineup for the Indoors and saw
marked improvement. Prior to the
tournament, Stanford went a com
bined 2-7 in doubles against No. 5
Baylor, No. 6 UCLA and No. 13
Southern California. Trying out a
new doubles roster at the Indoors,
the team went 6-3 against No. 2
Ohio State, No. 14 Duke and
Miami.
Sophomores Matt Bruch and

Blake Muller teamed up to form the
top doubles pairing and picked up
an impressive 8-5 upset of Duke's
No. 4 Joey Atas and David Goulet.
Freshmen Paul Morrissey and
Richard Wire comprise the second
doubles pair. The freshmen went 2-1
on the weekend with their lone loss
coming in a tiebreaker to Ohio
State's No. 22 Chris Klingemann and
Devin Mullings.
While senior Eric McKean and
sophomore Jeff Zeller went 1-2 at
the third doubles spot, the pair
notched an 8-3 win over UCLA's
No. 18Mathieu Dehaine and Jeremy
Drean.
"The doubles point is really im
portant in any match because then
you only need three of the six singles
to win," Wire said. "It sets the tone
for the match. Each [pair] forms a
good combination so I feel our [dou
bles lineup) ' s looking good."
The Cardinal hosts the Sun Dev
ils today at 1:30 p.m. and the Wild
cats on Saturday at 1 p.m.
