## Four profs. named to Engineer Academy 87 Stanford researchers in exclusive peer group 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE 
The National Academy of Engineering
(NAH) recently elected four University pro
fessors based on their innovative research

and groundbreaking
work in engineering
and technology edu
cation. Robert Gray,
Mark I lorowitz,Tere
sa Meng and Sebast
ian Thrun are among
the group's 64 newest
members, increasing
the number of acade
my members and for
eign associates from
Stanford to 87.

The NAE is a private organization con
sisting of more than 2,000 peer-elected mem
bers and foreign associates. As professionals
in the business, academic and governmental
sectors, those elected are among the world's
most distinguished engineers. Members are
dedicated to furthering the human condition
through exceptional engineering achieve
ment. focusing specifically on the relation
ships between engineering, technology and
quality of life.

Gray, a professor
of engineering and
vice chair of the elec-

trical engineering department, was applaud
ed for his contributions in the field of infor
mation theory and data compression.
"My work has dealt both with the under
lying theory and with coding algorithms
which try to achieve nearly optimal perform
ance," ho said. "The award is unique because
there is only one NAE,and it feels great to be
elected to it."
Information theory seeks to develop rele
vant mathematical models for communica
tions systems and measure their optimal per-

formance levels.
"For example,"
Gray explained,
"how fast and reli
ably can information
be communicated
through communica
tions channels like
the Internet, radio,
deep space and tele
phone lines?"
He has also com
pleted research on
data compression.

which reduces the amount of information
needed to communicate signals.

neering and computer science, was
also praised for his research on com
puter chip design and high-hand
width memory interface.
"It is quite an honor and a privilege
to be elected to the NAE," he said."lt
is so selective in its membership."
His work has mollified two prob
lems associated with an increased re
liance on computational scaling. The
first is caused by data's inability to fit
onto a processor chip because of its

growth in size over time.
"This means that the rate you can
transfer data from the memory' to
the computing unit is a problem."
Horowitz explained.
To minimize the memory band
width necessary, most computers use
a "cache" to recall data values that
have recently been used. Since each
processor can potentially have a lo
calized copy of a variable, a second
dilemma arises when many proces
sors are connected together.
"We worked on how to build ma
chines that could keep the caches
consistent even with large — 64 or
higher — processors," Horowitz
said. "We also build some working

versions of these systems."
Hie NAE also commended Elec
trical Engineering Professor Teresa
Meng. as well as Electrical Engineer
ing and Computer Science Associate
Professor Sebastian Thrun. Meng
was praised for her efforts on the de
velopment of wireless network tech
nology. Her work has enabled wire
less computer networks to become
more inexpensive, reliable and effi
cient. 11l run was recognized for his
work with mobile robot localization;
he designed robots to nurse the eld
erly and map toxic mining.
