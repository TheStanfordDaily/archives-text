## Four profs. named to Engineer Academy 87 Stanford researchers in exclusive peer group 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE 
The National Academy of Engineering
(NAH) recently elected four University pro
fessors based on their innovative research

and groundbreaking
work in engineering
and technology edu
cation. Robert Gray,
Mark I lorowitz,Tere
sa Meng and Sebast
ian Thrun are among
the group's 64 newest
members, increasing
the number of acade
my members and for
eign associates from
Stanford to 87.

The NAE is a private organization con
sisting of more than 2,000 peer-elected mem
bers and foreign associates. As professionals
in the business, academic and governmental
sectors, those elected are among the world's
most distinguished engineers. Members are
dedicated to furthering the human condition
through exceptional engineering achieve
ment. focusing specifically on the relation
ships between engineering, technology and
quality of life.

Gray, a professor
of engineering and
vice chair of the elec-

trical engineering department, was applaud
ed for his contributions in the field of infor
mation theory and data compression.
"My work has dealt both with the under
lying theory and with coding algorithms
which try to achieve nearly optimal perform
ance," ho said. "The award is unique because
there is only one NAE,and it feels great to be
elected to it."
Information theory seeks to develop rele
vant mathematical models for communica
tions systems and measure their optimal per-

formance levels.
"For example,"
Gray explained,
"how fast and reli
ably can information
be communicated
through communica
tions channels like
the Internet, radio,
deep space and tele
phone lines?"
He has also com
pleted research on
data compression.

which reduces the amount of information
needed to communicate signals.
