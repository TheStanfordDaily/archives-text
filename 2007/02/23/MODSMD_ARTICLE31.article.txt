### CALEY ANDERSON BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION GEEZERS 
Caley and Betsy got the pleasure this evening of reliv ing
Intermission. We know that many of you might not remem
ber when we started working here, but Caley and Betsy
started out together. Intermission was a 40-hour job last
year when we had no clue what we were doing. No one even
knew the password to the email (have you ever sat in front
of a computer and tried to guess every possible word?).
Caley and Betsy began working at The Daily as layout
editors on Tuesday and Thursday — this was WITI IOUT
Duran. Will Oremus, the Editor-in-Chief that volume, had
put the trust of the whole paper in the hands of

freshmen. The News Desk Editor,
Brendan Sclby, would always talk
about Caley to Betsy, and vice

versa; however, our paths hadn't
crossed yet. The next vol-

ume, under Cynthia
Cho, C&B worked on
Intermission as layout

editors with Brendan
Marten (Yes! The
same one!), Tam Vo
(Intermission
Guru) and Sam •
Tanzer (Who?) as*

our bosses. It was
through osmosis that
we learned the Inter
mission trade, and the
next fall we found our

selves in charge of the whole thing.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
If you think that it wasn't a good idea to let two fresh
sophomores be responsible for a semi-independent publi
cation, you have to consider they trusted us to send and lay
out The Daily as new-to-the Farm freshmen. The first vol
ume wasn't without its tests'. No one had checked the email
in two years, and most of the snail mail remained un
opened. We had to hold a garage sale just to be able to walk
into our office.
Vegoose was our first true test — and we couldn't even
check in at our hotel (KY.I, you have to be 21 in order to
check into a hotel in Vegas). Despite the pitfalls — bugs in
the bed, a locked trailer and two Howard Johnsons (check

out all the coverage in the November 4,2005 issue of Inter
mission), Caley and Betsy had the time of their lives, to use
a cliche. Caley was a professional photographer standing
mere feet away from the big-name artists, and Betsy was
third row for Dave Matthews Band and Blue Man Group
Like every epic story, there was a period where the pro
tagonists split up. Caley defected to Sports — a dark time
that she still doesn't like to talk about. And Betsy took a
chance on the man voted most likely to quit during the vol
ume — Victor Fuste. C&B didn't get to see each other much
since we didn't even work on the same nights. There was a
mini-reunion at the end of spring quarter when Intermission
traveled to Seattle. Caley and Victor's homeland weekend

was lull of Tiger Wood, 1

2006, baseball
games and
the Pike
Place Mar
ket Fesival.

well, freshmen (I love you guys,
really!). This week, Caley and Betsy finally worked togeth
er— like The Police playing at The Grammys. Natalie Jus
ticz — one of our regular Thursday night layout editors —
is out of town surprising her family.
I guess all this reminiscing has made both Betsy and
Caley realize how old they are (bear with us if you are over
the age of 21... we know we aren't actually old, but we're 126
in Daily years — that's your age multiplied by the number
of volumes you've worked here). Many of our best mo
ments of the Inst three years have been spent together work
ing long hours lor The Stanford Daily. Some of those best
moments are to come — next year, when we're 21, we're
going to Vegoose, baby!
