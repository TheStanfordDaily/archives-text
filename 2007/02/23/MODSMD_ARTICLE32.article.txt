## Reno 911!: Miami': Stupid title, brilliant film 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION RENO COP 
In a heartfelt letter found in the press materials for the film
"Reno 911!: Miami." Reno Sheriffs De-

partment Lieutenant Jim Dangle (a fiction
al character in the film played by Thomas
Lennon) has the following to say:
"THIS FILM IS NOT ENDORSED IN
ANY WAY BY THE RENO SHERIFF'S
DEPARTMENT... YES, there were some
unfortunate events that took place during
out time in Miami. Yes, people got hurt.
Yes, property got destroyed. And yes, one

nude person and some passers-by got parts
of an exploded narwhale on them. But... the truth is: we also
did a lot of good."
Thanks to what Dangle calls the "classic Hollywood
bull****" of the "good people (pronounced: dirty liars)" at
Twentieth Century Fox, you won't see much of that "good" in
the film. You will see the exploding narwhale. And. fortu
nately, you will sec a hilarious television show adapted into an
even more hilarious film. "Reno 911!: Miami" is far and away
the funniest film released in 2007.
Now in its fourth season on Comedy Central, "Reno 911!"
follows the bumbling exploits of the Reno Sheriff's Depart
ment in a parody of "COPS'" documentary style. Using quick
jump-cuts to move at a rapid pace, the show delivers a unique
ly varied blend of improv-style banter, smart wordplay and
low-brow slapstick comedy — one episode, for instance, finds

the officers holding a scavenger hunt (for such items as the
best-looking hooker and a suspect with a wig) to figure out
who gets tickets to see a live execution. The show rarely dwells
on any one joke before skipping to the next and throws too

many gags at the audience — most of
them successful — to ever become bor
ing. Luckily, the movie retains everything
that makes the series great and then
some. Fans of "Reno 911!" will love the
movie, and non-fans, well, will probably
love the movie, too.
The story of the film follows the
woefully incapable Sheriff's Depart
ment as they head for Miami for a na-

tional police convention. The story itself
is primarily a reason to get the officers into a new locale, so
they can share some very non-Reno experiences such as at
tending a Suge Knight party, finding an alligator in a swim
ming pool, and, yes, blowing up a whale on a beach. The film
is structured very much like an episode of the show: one
overarching story littered with sketch-like scenes (that may
or may not have anything to do with anything) loaded with
jokes. Where many TV shows fail in the conversion to film
by trying to do too much with the story, "Reno 911!" sticks
to its roots and focuses on being funny first.
What makes the premise work so well is the cast. Lennon,
Ben Garant. Kerri Kenney, Carlos Alazraqui and the rest of
the actors have played these roles for years, and it shows.
Every line of dialogue feels fluid and natural and every char
acter responds to their surroundings consistently and unique

ly, made all the more impressive given that the film has a
semi-improvised feel. Every player brings something differ
ent and often hilarious to the table, so no one character is
over-used or over-ignored. They're a team that's truly found
its groove. "Reno 911!" is a show loaded with both personal
ity and personalities, and it achieves a rare brilliance as far as
comedic ensembles go. Cameos by Danny DeVito, The
Rock, Paul Rudd and more also help.
Reno 911!" often pushes the boundaries of what's allowed
on basic cable, so rest assured that the movie uses its R rating
to its fullest potential. Profanity, nudity, drug use and more all
abound, but, to the benefit of the audience, it never becomes
gimmicky —jokes are funny because of the characters' reac
tions, not just because they're offensive. But occasionally
they're pretty offensive, too.
Reno 911!" isn't Comedy Central's most popular show.
But what "Reno 911!: Miami" proves is that it probably

should be. It's an hour and a half of

great comedv, the kind audiences

don't get to see enough
