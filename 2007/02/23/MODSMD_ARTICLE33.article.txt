### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION 911 OPERATOR 
The three are seated on a couch, adorned in the royal blue
and white of the Miami Sheriffs Department. On the left is
Lieutenant Jim Dangle, with large aviator glasses, a thin
light-brown mustache and tight short shorts clinging to his
upper thighs. In the middle is Deputy Travis Junior, leaned
forward and adorned with a thick bulletproof vest. On the
right is Trudy Weigel, who doesn't seem to be paying much
attention. They are the Reno Sheriffs Department, and
their recent temporary service in the city of Miami is docu
mented in "Reno 911!: Miami," released in theatres today.
Intermission got a chance to sit down with the group to dis
cuss the film.
Intermission: So you just finished the movie, and we've
heard there were some discrepancies over the title. Do you
feel you were portrayed positively, and did you get to ap
prove the final cut?
Dangle: Absolutely not. We were lucky we even got to see
the final cut. I thought very much that in the final cut of the
film, I would come off very much like Daniel Craig in the film
called "Casino Royale," and it turns out I come off much
more like some sort of horrible Paul Giamatti in a g-string.
Only, without the upside.
Junior We signed away the rights to film us so basically, we
got, uh, Michael Moore'd. We thought that we would be por

trayed as heroes on patrol, we thought the name of the film
was gonna be "Heroes on Patrol," but instead what they did
is they kinda re-edited and they take out the stuff where we
do our job and they put in the stuff where we, uh-
D: Try to pork each other.
J: ...try to pork each other.
D: Or get our watch caught in our associate's pubic hair.
J: Or wreck a car, or try to pick up a 13-year-old. I mean, it
really makes us look like half-wits.
Weigcl: How many times have you had you watch caught in
an associate's pubes and you just thank God that there
wasn't a camera there?
J: Every day.
D: And if you went every day to your job and every single
person there was armed, people would get shot. All the time.
J: People get shot. Last piece of pizza? The guns come out. It
happens.
W: Especially the pizza from Eleventh Street.
J: Yeah, it's amazing. They're real good.

YV: They put the cheese on top and the meat underneath.
J: And then the glocks come out.
I): Then the glocks come out.
INT: Miami's obviously a very different city from Reno.
What was it like to be in such a different place, and what ad
justments did you have to make?
J: In Reno, we're like, uh. Pierce Brosnan and Owen Wilson
and well, like Trudy Weigel. We're the crack team. We're the
beautiful dream set. Miami, not so much. You know, we're
definitely lower, on the lower income strata in Miami, defi
nitely the lower educational strata...
D: Looks.
J: Height.
I): Sex appeal.
J: Ability.
I): Ability. Language skills...
J: Fashion sense.
