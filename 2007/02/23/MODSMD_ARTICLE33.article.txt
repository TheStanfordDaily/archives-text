# Reno 911! Interview. Hott. Like your Mom.
## 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION 911 OPERATOR 
The three are seated on a couch, adorned in the royal blue
and white of the Miami Sheriffs Department. On the left is
Lieutenant Jim Dangle, with large aviator glasses, a thin
light-brown mustache and tight short shorts clinging to his
upper thighs. In the middle is Deputy Travis Junior, leaned
forward and adorned with a thick bulletproof vest. On the
right is Trudy Weigel, who doesn't seem to be paying much
attention. They are the Reno Sheriffs Department, and
their recent temporary service in the city of Miami is docu
mented in "Reno 911!: Miami," released in theatres today.
Intermission got a chance to sit down with the group to dis
cuss the film.
Intermission: So you just finished the movie, and we've
heard there were some discrepancies over the title. Do you
feel you were portrayed positively, and did you get to ap
prove the final cut?
Dangle: Absolutely not. We were lucky we even got to see
the final cut. I thought very much that in the final cut of the
film, I would come off very much like Daniel Craig in the film
called "Casino Royale," and it turns out I come off much
more like some sort of horrible Paul Giamatti in a g-string.
Only, without the upside.
Junior We signed away the rights to film us so basically, we
got, uh, Michael Moore'd. We thought that we would be por

trayed as heroes on patrol, we thought the name of the film
was gonna be "Heroes on Patrol," but instead what they did
is they kinda re-edited and they take out the stuff where we
do our job and they put in the stuff where we, uh-
D: Try to pork each other.
J: ...try to pork each other.
D: Or get our watch caught in our associate's pubic hair.
J: Or wreck a car, or try to pick up a 13-year-old. I mean, it
really makes us look like half-wits.
Weigcl: How many times have you had you watch caught in
an associate's pubes and you just thank God that there
wasn't a camera there?
J: Every day.
D: And if you went every day to your job and every single
person there was armed, people would get shot. All the time.
J: People get shot. Last piece of pizza? The guns come out. It
happens.
W: Especially the pizza from Eleventh Street.
J: Yeah, it's amazing. They're real good.

YV: They put the cheese on top and the meat underneath.
J: And then the glocks come out.
I): Then the glocks come out.
INT: Miami's obviously a very different city from Reno.
What was it like to be in such a different place, and what ad
justments did you have to make?
J: In Reno, we're like, uh. Pierce Brosnan and Owen Wilson
and well, like Trudy Weigel. We're the crack team. We're the
beautiful dream set. Miami, not so much. You know, we're
definitely lower, on the lower income strata in Miami, defi
nitely the lower educational strata...
D: Looks.
J: Height.
I): Sex appeal.
J: Ability.
I): Ability. Language skills...
J: Fashion sense.
W: C omplcx
ion.

J: You know

we're the man in Reno. We are literally the
man. And in Miami, we're like, like a short bus
full of gollums. It's a different game. It's a game
we were thrust into over our heads, and we did
as good as we could.
I): Travis was literally thrust over his head into
a whale.
J: Yeah.
I): That was incredibly tragic to have to watch.
W: And we didn't do as good as we could, as
good as we felt like at the time.
I): No. because every day —
W: We are not responsible for the safety of oth
ers.
J: (to Weigel) Technically, that's not entirely
true.
I): Trudy's mother, we recently found out, is
also her first cousin.
W: Isn't that convenient?
I): What we arc arc completely blank slates. To

be in a pcrfect zen state of readiness, to serve
the community as best we can. That's why we
have nothing going on up here, in our heads.
Nothing at all. Because anything up there
would be a weapon in the arsenal of our ene
mies.
J: Like Bruce Lee, you have to be like water,
and you have to fight the community like
water.
I): Sometimes you're just laying out in a kiddie
pool in the front yard. Prepared.
J: Prepared.
INT: Deputy Weigel. how many cats do you
have now?
W: 1 don't know, 1 haven't been home in a
while. They wander in and out.
J: You kept the door open?
W: I cut the door out. Instead of a cat door. I
put a people door in, and cut it out. so really,
what I did now is taken the door out.
J: I would argue that there's really no reason to
specify that it's a people door. I think when you
say "door," you assume that people go through
it.
W: Well, when you live with a ratio of 32 cats to
one human, and there's a door, whose door is
it?

J: Touche.
I): Touche. For a woman whose mother is also
her cousin, she's pretty smart. And, four limbs.
W: We 11...
J: And a tail.
I): And a tail. In fairness, four limbs and a very
stubby tail. But you can strike that from the
record. No one needs to know that. It's a slight
detail.
W: And thank you, by the way, to Doctor
Gorso, if he's reading this, because my family
couldn't afford the removal of that at the time.
I think he did it for the press, and then it never
even made the news because it got knocked off
by when the space shuttle exploded or whatev
er.
I): That's right, the shuttle.
J: Bad timing.
I): Bad timing. You get your tail removed, the
same day the shuttle exploded.
W: What are the odds?
J: Bad timing.
I): Oh. dear Lord.

INT: This question's for Deputy Junior. How
did you first get involved in law enforcement?
J: I'm from a law enforcement family, all the
way back to just before Nevada became a state.
My family took the law into their own hands —
posses and vigilantes, and lynch mobs, really. It
was what I was born to do. I had a gun before 1
learned to read and write. And then I kinda for
got the read and write part.
W: [to Junior] You don't need to know that. It's
overrated.
J: Yeah, if a book's good they're gonna make a
movie out of it anyway.
I): Of course. Look at "Memoirs of a Geisha.'
.1: Oh I have, oh I have... that was a book?
I): Yeah. Way back in the day, some hundred
years old. A hundred, two hundred years old.
W: You can get a copy on eßay.
I): A geisha wrote it. Written by a geisha. Writ
ten by an old geisha.
W: They don't write —she didn't write. She
danced it.
I): No, she wrote it. She wrote it on rice paper.
INT: I lieutenant Dangle,
in the film we see you

making your (unique
ly short) shorts.

I): Yes, 1 craft them. I seamster them.
INT: Have you always made your own shorts?
I): You gots to. You can't walk into anywhere and

J: Liberal Hollywood agenda right there.
W: Before it leaves, I'm gonna see it. We don't get
first-run movies in Reno...
I): No. we get second- and third-run.
W: ...so in about six months I'm hoping to see "Night
at the Museum."
J: We just got "Memoirs of a Geisha."

make these. I have to be creative. All I'm doing when
I make these shorts is they're just another weapon. 1

I): Just came out. But 1

got the stick. I got the glock. and 1 got the shorts. And
they give me massive range. 1 can do a grapevine kick.
I can scissor kick you. 1 can Indian leg-wrestle. Al
though. they leave me open to certain injuries, like,
say. waffle butt. When I sit down on any rattan furni-

ture. I'm keepin' the shorts. You can have these

shorts when you pry 'em from my cold

don't know, they'll
probably make more
I documentations of us.
They own us apparent
ly in perpetuity
throughout the uni
verse in any form of
media. Even ones that

dead buns.

INT: So. what's next
for the Reno Sher
iff's Department?
Do you see any more
movies in your fu
ture?
W: Well. 1 wanna
sec. what's that one?
"Night at the Muse
um." 1 wanna see that.

haven t been invented

yet. Meaning, like, if they
d 0...

W: Like a microwave of the brain.

I): Yeah, like holograms where they send you
thoughts.
.1: Or like "Matrix," where you can plug into a movie
in the back of the head. When they do documentaries
in that style, thev can do those about us.

I): Yeah, that's a liberal Hollywood agenda. Liberal I): They'll keep doin'documentaries'til we get smart.
1 iollywood agenda. 'Til we smarten up. Which probably won't happen.

an associate's pubes and you just thank God that there
wasn't a camera there?
J: Every day.
D: And if you went every day to your job and every single
person there was armed, people would get shot. All the time.
J: People get shot. Last piece of pizza? The guns come out. It
happens.
W: Especially the pizza from Eleventh Street.
J: Yeah, it's amazing. They're real good.

YV: They put the cheese on top and the meat underneath.
J: And then the glocks come out.
I): Then the glocks come out.
INT: Miami's obviously a very different city from Reno.
What was it like to be in such a different place, and what ad
justments did you have to make?
J: In Reno, we're like, uh. Pierce Brosnan and Owen Wilson
and well, like Trudy Weigel. We're the crack team. We're the
beautiful dream set. Miami, not so much. You know, we're
definitely lower, on the lower income strata in Miami, defi
nitely the lower educational strata...
D: Looks.
J: Height.
I): Sex appeal.
J: Ability.
I): Ability. Language skills...
J: Fashion sense.
W: C omplcx
ion.

J: You know

we're the man in Reno. We are literally the
man. And in Miami, we're like, like a short bus
full of gollums. It's a different game. It's a game
we were thrust into over our heads, and we did
as good as we could.
I): Travis was literally thrust over his head into
a whale.
J: Yeah.
I): That was incredibly tragic to have to watch.
W: And we didn't do as good as we could, as
good as we felt like at the time.
I): No. because every day —
W: We are not responsible for the safety of oth
ers.
J: (to Weigel) Technically, that's not entirely
true.
I): Trudy's mother, we recently found out, is
also her first cousin.
W: Isn't that convenient?
I): What we arc arc completely blank slates. To

be in a pcrfect zen state of readiness, to serve
the community as best we can. That's why we
have nothing going on up here, in our heads.
Nothing at all. Because anything up there
would be a weapon in the arsenal of our ene
mies.
J: Like Bruce Lee, you have to be like water,
and you have to fight the community like
water.
I): Sometimes you're just laying out in a kiddie
pool in the front yard. Prepared.
J: Prepared.
INT: Deputy Weigel. how many cats do you
have now?
W: 1 don't know, 1 haven't been home in a
while. They wander in and out.
J: You kept the door open?
W: I cut the door out. Instead of a cat door. I
put a people door in, and cut it out. so really,
what I did now is taken the door out.
J: I would argue that there's really no reason to
specify that it's a people door. I think when you
say "door," you assume that people go through
it.
W: Well, when you live with a ratio of 32 cats to
one human, and there's a door, whose door is
it?

J: Touche.
I): Touche. For a woman whose mother is also
her cousin, she's pretty smart. And, four limbs.
W: We 11...
J: And a tail.
I): And a tail. In fairness, four limbs and a very
stubby tail. But you can strike that from the
record. No one needs to know that. It's a slight
detail.
W: And thank you, by the way, to Doctor
Gorso, if he's reading this, because my family
couldn't afford the removal of that at the time.
I think he did it for the press, and then it never
even made the news because it got knocked off
by when the space shuttle exploded or whatev
er.
I): That's right, the shuttle.
J: Bad timing.
I): Bad timing. You get your tail removed, the
same day the shuttle exploded.
W: What are the odds?
J: Bad timing.
I): Oh. dear Lord.

INT: This question's for Deputy Junior. How
did you first get involved in law enforcement?
J: I'm from a law enforcement family, all the
way back to just before Nevada became a state.
My family took the law into their own hands —
posses and vigilantes, and lynch mobs, really. It
was what I was born to do. I had a gun before 1
learned to read and write. And then I kinda for
got the read and write part.
W: [to Junior] You don't need to know that. It's
overrated.
J: Yeah, if a book's good they're gonna make a
movie out of it anyway.
I): Of course. Look at "Memoirs of a Geisha.'
.1: Oh I have, oh I have... that was a book?
I): Yeah. Way back in the day, some hundred
years old. A hundred, two hundred years old.
W: You can get a copy on eßay.
I): A geisha wrote it. Written by a geisha. Writ
ten by an old geisha.
W: They don't write —she didn't write. She
danced it.
I): No, she wrote it. She wrote it on rice paper.
INT: I lieutenant Dangle,
in the film we see you

making your (unique
ly short) shorts.

I): Yes, 1 craft them. I seamster them.
INT: Have you always made your own shorts?
I): You gots to. You can't walk into anywhere and

J: Liberal Hollywood agenda right there.
W: Before it leaves, I'm gonna see it. We don't get
first-run movies in Reno...
I): No. we get second- and third-run.
W: ...so in about six months I'm hoping to see "Night
at the Museum."
J: We just got "Memoirs of a Geisha."

make these. I have to be creative. All I'm doing when
I make these shorts is they're just another weapon. 1

I): Just came out. But 1

got the stick. I got the glock. and 1 got the shorts. And
they give me massive range. 1 can do a grapevine kick.
I can scissor kick you. 1 can Indian leg-wrestle. Al
though. they leave me open to certain injuries, like,
say. waffle butt. When I sit down on any rattan furni-

ture. I'm keepin' the shorts. You can have these

shorts when you pry 'em from my cold

don't know, they'll
probably make more
I documentations of us.
They own us apparent
ly in perpetuity
throughout the uni
verse in any form of
media. Even ones that

dead buns.

INT: So. what's next
for the Reno Sher
iff's Department?
Do you see any more
movies in your fu
ture?
W: Well. 1 wanna
sec. what's that one?
"Night at the Muse
um." 1 wanna see that.

haven t been invented

yet. Meaning, like, if they
d 0...

W: Like a microwave of the brain.

I): Yeah, like holograms where they send you
thoughts.
.1: Or like "Matrix," where you can plug into a movie
in the back of the head. When they do documentaries
in that style, thev can do those about us.

I): Yeah, that's a liberal Hollywood agenda. Liberal I): They'll keep doin'documentaries'til we get smart.
1 iollywood agenda. 'Til we smarten up. Which probably won't happen.

The three are seated on a couch, adorned in the royal blue
and white of the Miami Sheriffs Department. On the left is
Lieutenant Jim Dangle, with large aviator glasses, a thin
light-brown mustache and tight short shorts clinging to his
upper thighs. In the middle is Deputy Travis Junior, leaned
forward and adorned with a thick bulletproof vest. On the
right is Trudy Weigel, who doesn't seem to be paying much
attention. They are the Reno Sheriffs Department, and
their recent temporary service in the city of Miami is docu
mented in "Reno 911!: Miami," released in theatres today.
Intermission got a chance to sit down with the group to dis
cuss the film.
Intermission: So you just finished the movie, and we've
heard there were some discrepancies over the title. Do you
feel you were portrayed positively, and did you get to ap
prove the final cut?
Dangle: Absolutely not. We were lucky we even got to see
the final cut. I thought very much that in the final cut of the
film, I would come off very much like Daniel Craig in the film
called "Casino Royale," and it turns out I come off much
more like some sort of horrible Paul Giamatti in a g-string.
Only, without the upside.
Junior We signed away the rights to film us so basically, we
got, uh, Michael Moore'd. We thought that we would be por

trayed as heroes on patrol, we thought the name of the film
was gonna be "Heroes on Patrol," but instead what they did
is they kinda re-edited and they take out the stuff where we
do our job and they put in the stuff where we, uh-
D: Try to pork each other.
J: ...try to pork each other.
D: Or get our watch caught in our associate's pubic hair.
J: Or wreck a car, or try to pick up a 13-year-old. I mean, it
really makes us look like half-wits.
Weigcl: How many times have you had you watch caught in
