## Why Martin Scorsese is going to get an Oscar 
### VICTOR FUSTÉ INTERMISSION ACADEMY MEMBER 
"Raging Bull." "The Last Temptation of Christ." "Good
fellas." "Gangs of New York." "The Aviator." "The Depart
ed."
What do these films have in common? All have been nom
inated for an Academy Award for directing and none of them
have won.
Let me repeat that.
Martin Scorsese, the six-time nominee for Best Director
has won absolutely ZERO Oscars for directing. None. Zilch.

Ninguno.
Scorsese joins the ranks of such auteurs
as Alfred Hitchcock, Robert Altman. Stan
ley Kubrick and Fcderico Fellini as a direc
tor nominated multiple times without get
ting the foot-tall golden statue. "The De
parted," adapted from the Hong Kong po
lice drama "Infernal Affairs" (2002) is
Scorsese's latest directorial masterpiece
nominated for the Best Director category,
and if he doesn't drive home with Oscar in
the passenger seat, Hollywood cinema
might as well shrivel up and die.
The Academy has snubbed him 011 so
many occasions that he's well past due. At
last year's ceremony, host Jon Stewart as
tutelv commented on the unbelievable tally

after the Best Song category was announced — "For those of
you keeping score at home, Martin Scorsese, zero Oscars. 3-6-
Mafia, one!"

While the more cynically minded segment of the popula
tion might argue that the Oscars are simply a self-congratula
tory ceremony put on by the film industry to scrounge up a few
more dollars from films well out of theaters, it, nonetheless, is
cinema's most-recognized award. For over 30 years, the direc
tor with eyebrows that just won't quit has cemented his status
as one of America's premier filmmakers with films like "Taxi
Driver" and "Casino." After years of shutouts at the Oscars.
Scorsese has reached a point where the Academy must recog-

nize the director —if not for his
fantastic job with "The Departed"
then for an oeuvre that has defined
modern American cinema.
Being nominated is a huge honor.
Actually getting up on stage and
thanking everyone with whom
you've worked before getting
rushed off stage by a rude orches
tra is priceless. The Academy has a
long track record of awarding Os
cars to people who deserve it, but
not necessarily for the film they're
nominated for — Denzel Wash
ington for "Training Day." for ex
ample. It is certainly not a huge
leap to conclude that Scorsese is

going to be going home with the gold — a lifetime of work in
the film industry practically guarantees him the win in the cat
egory.
The real question, however, is whether the director will re
ceive both the Best Director nod as well as the award for Best
Picture for "The Departed." Traditionally, if a filmmaker is
nominated in both of these categories in the same year, he or
she will not receive both awards. At last year's Oscars. George
Clooney knew right off the bat that he wasn't getting the Best
Director Award when he was handed a Best Supporting Actor
award.
Scorsese's competition in the Best Picture category is
fiercely competitive. Actor and director Clint Eastwood has
already stolen his thunder by winning both Best Picture and
Besi Director in 1992 for "Unforgiven," a western which
was nominated alongside Scorsese's "Goodfellas." East
wood is nominated once again this year for "Letters from
lwo Jima" and has the potential for upsetting Scorsese yet
again.
In his favor, Scorsese recently won the Director's Guild of
America (DGA) award for his work on "The Departed." In
the organization's 58-year history, only six recipients of the
award have not gone on to receive the Oscar for Best Director.
1 for one don't see Scorsese losing the Best Director cate
gory. A few years from now. 1 expect to see the words "Acad
emy Award Winner" next to his name on the marquees. I'm
rooting for you. Marty, and if you don't end up winning, your
films have repeatedly shown that your competition should still
be afraid of you.
