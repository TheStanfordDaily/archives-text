## CONFESSIONS FROM AN AWARD SHOW GROUPIE 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION OSCAR 
I'm pretty sure that I already watch too much television
as a college student.
Before I came to Stanford, my parents told me, "If you
have time to watch TV, you certainly have time to be doing
other things." By "other things,'' they meant any number of
productive options that most definitely don't include watch
ing the TV (and this is why I pay my own cable bill). There
fore, it's unfortunate that in addition to whatever regular

lineup of shows are on my
weekly "can't miss" list, 1
can't resist a good awards
show. That's a whole lot of
extra TV I find myself watch
ing— the Golden Globes,
the Grammys and obviously
the upcoming Oscars (I may
have even found myself
watching the SAGs a few
weekends ago, and it goes
without saying that I watched
the Emmys in the Fall). At
three to four hours a pop,
these damn awards shows are
making me miss out on a
whole lot of "other things" in
life! But here's why I can't re
sist them:
I. They tell you what the
good stuff is — Don't have
time to watch all of the
movies or TV 7 shows or listen
to all of the CDs that come
out in a year? You may not

always agree
with the ul
timate se-

lections.
(I know
every-

body
loves the
Dixie

Chicks, hut did they seriously deserve to
win practically every single Grammy? 1
also thought that every Golden Globe
TV comedy nominee was more impres
sive than the cute but overrated "Ugly
Betty.") but at least all of these awards

shows narrow down the options to a
pool of the best stuff, from which we
can choose what we do want to see.

2. Everything is so pretty...or ugly
— I can't quite articulate why we
— or at least I — derive so much

pleasure out of looking at the pretty people at the pretty
venues with their pretty dresses (and tuxes?) and pretty jew
elry, but for some reason, it's supremely enjoyable. It's also
equally as fun to laugh at the celebs who. despite having a
personal stylist and a whole lot of money, still manage to
wear something heinous.
3. They have educational and practical value — You may
be one of those weirdos that fancies yourself above watching
movies or television, but even if you refuse to watch or listen
to whatever the nominees are, it still is important to know
what won. We don't want to be too socially awkward, now

do we? They even ask questions about entertainment-relat
ed subjects on "Jeopardy!" every so often. If it's important
enough to be on "Jeopardy!," there can't be any shame in
having the knowledge, or spending three or four hours per
awards show to gain that knowledge...
4. There's usually some good controversy involved —
Can you say Isaiah Washington backstage at the Golden
Globes (and his little snafu where he repeated a certain
word yet again in an attempt to convince people that he had
never used that word originally)? 0r...1 don't even like
country music, but Faith Hill frowning and mouthing
"What!" when Carrie Underwood won Vocalist of the

Year at the CMAs was a laugh riot. And what about the
controversy surrounding the Oscar presenter gift baskets
this year? 1 think somebody suggested that $100,000 gift
baskets for already rich celebrities arc ludicrous when
there's starving children in the world, but we all know that
the real reason why they've been nixed is that the IRS de
cided that from now on they'd be taxed like hell. You seri
ously can't make this stuff up. (And if you don't follow the
awards season and watch the shows...you very well may
miss out!)
5. They're a spectacular method of procrastination — I

could think of a worse way to spend four hours. Seriously.
There's also over 1,41)0 students in the "Stanford Students
for Procrastination" Facebook group that 1 feel like I have a
case for.
Now, there may be some of you out there with "other
things" to do that will pose the question, "But can't you get
all of this information and save some time by watching a
summary on an entertainment news program the following
day, or watching notable clips on You Tube or just reading a
list of the winners?" You may not believe me. but somehow
it just isn't the same...
