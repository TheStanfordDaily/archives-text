### WEENA RAMA PUN INTERMISSION PSYCHIC 
Best Actor in a Leading Role
Leonardo DiCaprio ("Wood Diamond"), Ryan
Gosling ("Half Nelson"), Peter O'Toole
("Venus"). Will Smith ("The Pursuit Of Happy
ness") and Forest Whitaker ("The Last King Of
Scotland")
I have not watched any of these actors in their
nominated roles besides DiCaprio. As Danny
Archer, a diamond smuggler, Leo has all that he
needs to win the Oscar: a marvelous transfor
mation from a baby-faced " Titanic" boy to a
muscled gangster with an impeccable South
African English accent. The only obstacle to the
Oscar is Forest Whitaker. who won the Golden
Globe last month. But looking at the differences
between the winners at these two award cere
monies in the past, Leo has a firm chance. Good
Luck Leo!

Best Actor in a Supporting Role
Alan Arkin ("Little Miss Sunshine"), Jackie Earle
Haley ("Little Children"). Djimon Hounsou
("Blood Diamond"), Eddie Murphy ("Dream
girb") and Mark Wahlberg ("The Departed")
I have not watched the critic's favorite, Eddie
Murphy, but he is going to win. Arkin, as a heroin
addicted grandfather who teaches his grand
daughter to dance as a stripper, was great in his
role — you hated him and you loved him, he irri
tated you but you understood him. However, it
would lie unfair to other cast members of the
movie — who were not even nominated but were
on par with him in their hilarious roles — if he won
the award. Similarly, Wahlberg. as the foul
mouthed police sergeant, deserved to be nominat
ed, but like Arkin, it is not "his" movie. Hounsou
could win the Oscar, but I doubt it because when
ever I think of his character in "Blood Diamond,"
I see him as a mute man with not enough lines to
speak. I have no say on Jackie Earle Haley. But I
have seen Eddie Murphy as an annovingly trying
to-be funny guy in "The Nutty Professor"(s) and
heard him as a donkey in "Shrek"(s) and so. if he
now managed to get a nomination (after winning a
Golden Globe), there must be some serious acting
there.

Best Actress in a l eading Role
Penelope Cruz ("Volver"), Judi Dench ("Notes
On A Scandal"), Helen Mirren ("The Queen "),
Meryl Streep ("The Devil Wears Prada") and
Kate Winslet ("Little Children")
I would like Kate Winslet to win (simply be
cause she has been nominated too many times
to be ignored anymore) but 1 think Helen Mir
ren as Queen Elizabeth will ultimately prevail.
I don't know why Streep got nominated — it
was fun to watch her play a devilish fashion ed
itor but I doubt the acting was serious enough
to get nominated, let alone win an Oscar. Cruz,
as a sexy mother confronting absurd twists in
her life, was rightly praised for her acting by
being nominated, but the other candidates
were in far more challenging roles than she
was. So. unless the Oscar committee is against
monarchs, critics predict that Mirren will take
the Oscar.

Best Actress in a Supporting Role
Adriana Barraza ("Babel Cate Blanchett
("Notes On A Scandal"), Abigail Breslin ("Lit
tle Miss Sunshine"), Jennifer Hudson ("Dream
girls") and Rinko Kikuchi ("Babel")
I will hop on my couch like Tom Cruise if lit
tle Abigail Breslin wins the award (she was a
genuine model against those irritating Barbie
dolls in the beauty contest), but I am afraid
Oscar will flinch in creating history so soon and
will instead favor an American Idol top-10 fi
nalist. 1 have not seen Jennifer Hudson in
"Dreamgirls" (Hollywood musicals don't inter
est me). Blanchett must not win: It did not re
quire much of her talent (for a talented actress
like her) to play an art teacher who falls in love
with her student. I will give you my verdict on
the two actors in "Babel" once I see the movie
on Sunday FLiCKS (too bad . . . by then, the
Oscar will already be handed out. Seriously
FLiCKS must be a little far sighted. Gin we
watch "Babel" instead of "Casino Royale" this
Sunday?)

Best Director
Alejandro Gonzalez Indrritu ("Mabel ), Martin
Scorsese ("The Departed"), Clint Eastwood
("Letters From Iwo Jima"), Stephen Frears
("The Queen") and Paul Cireengrass ("United
93")
Martin Scorsese will be the winner this time
— the Oscar has ignored him for too long. And
of course, his movie is breathtaking. < )nly the
finest director can handle an issue as deep as
mafia, undercover agents, etc., along with the
finest actors in Hollywood. But honestly. I don t
care who takes home the Oscar. 1 loved In<u
ritu's "Ameros Perros' and know the winning
records of Clint Eastwood as a directoi. but I
must admit don't know much about the works of
the other two directors.

Best Picture
'Babel," "The Departed." "Letters From Iwo
Jim a," "Little Miss Sunshine" and"The
Queen "
I have two favorites here. "The Departed"
and "Little Miss Sunshine" — one had me
swearing the entire time and the other laugh
ing to the point of tears. I'm indifferent be
tween the two. because it's hard to judge
when Jill the movies have very different plots.
But since the Oscar has gone global this year.
"Babel" (which won a Golden Globe for the
same category) might be the chief obstacle
for my favorites.

Best Picture in a Foreign Language Film
"After the Wedding," "Days of Glory (In
digenes)," "The Lives O) Others, "Pans
Labyrinth " and "Water"
1 love this category, but 1 have only watched
"Pan's Labyrinth" and "Water." So, 1 am not the
best judge here again but my favorite is "Pan's
Labyrinth" and given the entire buz/ about Di
rector Guillermo del Toro's genius in successful
ly interweaving the horrors of civil war with a
child's gory fantasies (which is very true), this
movie is sure to be the winner. "Water" reduced
me to tears with all the plights of Hindu widows
in India while Gandhi was still alive, but it lacked
the creativity of "Pan's Labyrinth" (the pale man,
for example) and was a little too slow at times.
