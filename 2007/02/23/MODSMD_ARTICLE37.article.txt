## Juicy Sushi 
### MARY LIZ MCCURDY INTERMISSION GREEN TEA CRITIC 
Locatcd just three miles north of campus on El Camino, Naomi
Sushi offers a warm, welcoming atmosphere for Stanford students
and local families. The ambience is relaxed, casual, and laid back -r
but not at the expense of great food and service. Though the restau
rant is usually bustling with people, there's no need to make a reser
vation. The venue boasts two dining rooms as well as a sushi bar,
making Naomi desirable for families with small children, large
groups, dates, and even those who want to eat solo at the sushi bar
with the chef.
The chefs at the sushi bar are friendly and make an effort to please
their customers personally. Aside from their exceptional sushi

preparation, their desire to develop relationships with regular cus
tomers is apparent through their large base of frequent diners — in
cluding myself. '
I recommend sitting at the bar. To drink, the green tea is free, but
a little weak. There is also wide variety of sake, slightly more costly
than tea, but guaranteed to be stronger! Start your meal with the
miso soup or seaweed salad. Though the miso is not strikingly
unique, it is a tasty starter — the mixed seaweed salad is also very fla
vorful.
Be sure to ask and your server or chef will be happy to tell you
about the fresh fish of the day. I recommend sampling some of the
fresh rolls, as well as some of Naomi's "Special Rolls," including the
popular EEWA roll, 49'ers Roll, Stanford Roll and Volcano Roll.
These special rolls are priced slightly higher (around $10) but are def
initely worth the splurge.
If you don't like sushi, or sushi simply doesn't fill you, there are
many other delectable options available. The portions are on the
smaller side and could easily be a complimentary supplement to your
meal. Enjoy chicken teriyaki, prepared tender and sweet, or the
"Noodle of the Day — linguinc with chicken, shrimp and mush
room.
Price-wise, Naomi is slightly cheaper than most of the other com
parable Japanese restaurants in the area. Still, a full meal will cost no
less than $15 or $20, a little pricey for the regular college student. Re
gardless, Naomi is fresh, friendly and a good time: the sushi is just
simply juicy.
