## What to do with the winter quarter blues 
### NATALIE JABBAR INTERMISSION PHOTOSYNTHESIZER 
Ah. the winter quarter blues. II you aren't singing this tune

:hances are somebody around you is. For some reason, this time
«' \ ear always lends itself to a strange brand of misery. It'd be easy
lo blame it on Seasonal Affective Disorder (that's what

I did last year when it rained for almost six
weeks straight), but the sun has been pret
ty kind to us this time around. Still, it's not
hard to figure out why so many of us have
lost the spring in our flip-flopped step —
more work, less sleep, more colds, less
sleep, more pressure, less sleep. And the
application avalanche doesn't help.
But enough of that. You don't need or

want to read about hypothetical reasons for your
winter slump, and I don't want to trivialize anybody's unhappi
ness. I just want to focus on simple ways to snap out of a low-grade
11 bruary funk. When the charm of festering in lethargy and
scowling at the happily skateboarding pre-pubescent youth (I'd
be happy too if 1 only had one hour of homework a week) wears
off, try some of the following:
i'ake a shower. No joke. While it may mean sacrificing a few
minutes of sleep, it's completely worth it. There's something
cathartic about standing under warm water until your fingers
swirl into prunes. And if you don't feel happier afterwards, rest
assured that those around you will at least appreciate that you
smell better. If you don't put on the same clothes you were wear
ing pre-shower, that is. Sigh.
Send somebody a care package. It seems counterintuitive, 1
know. You should be receiving homemade cookies and fun. shiny

things, right? But somehow, surpris
ing people you care about can actu
ally bring your spirits up. Your best
friend who goes to school in New

England and actually hasn't seen
the sun since Labor Day will be
tickled. You'll be tickled. The

A V'U* 11 1./V UIIVIIV.I. I lIC
USPS will be ticked. And

you might even get
some mail back in re
turn. It's a karma

thang.
Go on a walk
I Frantically
speed
marching

to class when
you're late doesn't
count. Shin splints
will not make vou

happier. Meandering
around campus or hiking the
i- —:_Li i- • . .i

Dish, though, might be just the
healthy distraction you need.

Actually, word on the street is any
physical activity will probably raise

your endorphins and offer a little pick
me-up. But as somebody who avoids
gyms at all costs, 1 think a hearty walk will
suffice.

Photosynthesize your room. Get a plant or fresh dow
ers. A little xylem and phloem always brightens up a space, and

the extra oxygen certainly doesn't hurt. Just re
member that a plant is a commitment. Even the
hardy ones. My roommate and I somehow
managed to kill an entire family of cacti this
quarter. Yep.

Open your curtains. Not
only for the sake of your new
photosynthetic friends, but
also for your own well
being. It'll be easier to
wake up for class if your
body doesn't think it's resid-

ing in a perpetually dark cave.
Extra points for opening your
windows, too. Fresh air=good.
Find an activity that re
quires all of your concentration.
Practice vour instrument. Medi-

tate. Read some Virginia Woolf.
Do whatever forces you to tem
porarily abandon the little
stress ogres gnawing at your
psyche. I'm not advocating
denial —just a short
respite. If not for you. do it
for the ogres. Snacking on
unhappy psyches is ex-

haustine

Embrace the rain. Griping about your soaking wet pant legs isn't
going to make you feel better. Jumping in puddles ala your six
year-old sell will. Getting a little muddy is good for the soul. And
when you're done, you can try out suggestion one: the shower.
