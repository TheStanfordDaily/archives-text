That's more money than has ever

than the year before. And it is more
than 50 percent greater than 1 larvard's
second place take of $595 million.
The record level of giving from a
record number of givers 10 percent
of alumni — was part of an across-the
board strong year for university
fundraising. All schools together raised
$28 billion, a 9.4% increase from last
year.
"Stanford and Harvard are typically
one and two," said Howard Pearson
'76, a senior official at the Universi
ty's Office of Development. "Har
vard is generally more number one.
but Stanford has got very attractive
gift objectives where donors can
make an impact in some cutting edge
areas, and that's what it takes for
donors to make significant gifts. So
we've got some exciting opportuni
ties. we have very generous alumni
and friends, and putting all of that to
gether with the campaign means we
are able to attract some very large
gifts."
2(M)6 marked the end of the five
year Campaign for Undergraduate
Education and the beginning of the
Stanford Challenge, which Martin
Shell, vice president for develop
ment, said had a positive impact on
this year's unusually high level of
contributions.
"Typically there are spikes in giv
ing at the beginning and end of cam
paigns." he said in a statement re

leased Wednesday.
Ihe Stanford Challenge includes
initiatives in sustainability, K-12 edu
cation. health, international peace
and security, graduate and under
graduate education and arts and cre
ativity curriculum.
Stanford received several high
profile donations, including over
$100 million from John Arrillaga *60
to assist with the building of the
Stanford Stadium. The University
received $K0 million from the
William and Flora Hewlett Founda
tion. a part of the $4(H) million gift
announced in 2(W)1 for the School of

Tony Rem he Rock also donated $10
million for the development of a cen
ter for corporate governance at
Stanford.
"Humanity is facing challenges
of enormous complexity, and our
university is uniquely positioned to
address them." said President John
Hennessy in a statement. "We ap
preciate our supporters' confidence
in Stanford's ability to leverage our
research and expertise to respond
to these critical issues as well as the

role we intend to play in educating
the next generation of global lead
ers."
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'82 said that these gifts are important
because of the current strain on the
federal budget.
"As one of the leading research
universities in the world." he said in
Wednesday's statement. "Stanford is
seeking to expand its research ef
forts, leveraging federal research
dollars in a way that creates benefits
for the public and serves as an engine
for the economy."
Etchemendy also noted that
Stanford's increase in private contri
butions will assist the expansion of
financial aid. The University an
nounced a $10 million increase in the
financial aid budget this week.
Will the boom times for fundrais
ing continue?
"Our expectations for this year
are, we'll say, optimistic," said Pear
son. "Whether we would repeat last
year is certainly hard to duplicate,
hut we are at the beginning of a cam
paign. which is a good time to be."
