## Roxy takes sex to the Oscars 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Roxy congratulates you if (most) of the sex you had in 2006 was neither as dis- frJ
gusting as "Borat," nor as disturbing as "Little Miss Sunshine." There were probably A
some "You, Me and Dupree" moments for all of us (who hasn't been walked in on fl
by some pesky cheapskate like...a roommate?), and maybe a few times when we fl
should or shouldn't have " Trust(ed) the Man." But was there truly any Oscar-wor- |
thy sex last year, either in the movies or on our campus?
The answer to the first question is painfully obvious, Roxy hates to admit. Of course
there weren't any particularly stunning sex scenes in mainstream movies headed to the
Oscars. In America, we can't see that sort of thing in conventional theaters, or re- _
ally even without the aid of the Internet. Romance and foreplay. Though Roxy
knows there's something to be said for the soup and salad, pardon her if she A
just wants to sink her teeth into the steak once in a while.
On our campus, there may have been some award-winning sex going on. I
but it seems like no one enjoys talking about it except Roxy and the SHPRC. V
If we all would just share our stories, techniques and blunders, we'd all be bet- I
ter prepared when the time comes again. And again and again and again.
The movie industry could also help make sex a less taboo subject, but if the I
2006 movies nominated for Oscars are any indication, films are in general I
doing no such thing. In short, Roxy won't be watching the Oscars this year,
because none of the following films will be represented. A
"Employee of the Mouth" — Her coworkers loooove her
"V for Vagina" — Shaved onscrecn!
"Fireballs" — Any volunteers to put out? A
