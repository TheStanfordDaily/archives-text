## Zoot Suit Week brings acclaimed poet, play 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Casa Zapata brought two-time HBO
Def Poetry Jam performer Joe Hernandez-
Kolski to Stanford last night for a spoken
word event in Stern Dining. The event was
part of Casa Zapata's Zoot Suit Week, a
week-long series of events that will also
showcase the play "Zoot Suit" in Kresge
Auditorium tonight.
Casa Zapata's ethnic theme associate
Andrew Lomeli '09, who is also a sports ed
itor at The Daily, said that the program aims
to illuminate Mexican-American history.
"It's basically commemorating a specific
era in the United States' history, specifical
ly Mexican-American history right before
World War 11 and during the war as well," he
said. "It was a period during which a lot of
Mexican-American youth tried to create
their own culture, and part of it was wearing
Zoot Suits."
Lomeli noted that this era was one of
racial bigotry.
"The Zoot Suit Riots happened during
the war. which is when a lot of sailors would
take taxis and they'd go and pull Mexican-
American youth out of random places and
beat them up." he said. "It was a very con-
troversial time, and there were a lot
of racial injustices at the time."
Last night, Hernandez-Kolski
performed a piece called "Retried
Latino Pride." Lomeli said that
bringing Hernandez-Kolski was
part of Casa Zapata's effort to dis
tinguish this year's Zoot Suit Week
from those of the past.
"We wanted to do something
different compared to previous
years," he said. "We wanted to
bring somebody fresh and enter
taining. He's a spoken word piece
performer and comedian, and
that's something we've really
never done before."
Zoot Suit Week began last Sat
urday with the production of a play
called "Zoot Suit," based on the
Sleepy Lagoon Murders in which
several Mexican-American youth
were charged with murder based on
little evidence. At 8:00 p.m. tonight,
Kresge Auditorium will host a dif
ferent rendition of "Zoot Suit."
with this version performed and di
rected entirely by students.
The week will conclude with "La
Fiesta," also known as "La
Pachanga," a celebration starting at

10 p.m. in Stern Dining.
