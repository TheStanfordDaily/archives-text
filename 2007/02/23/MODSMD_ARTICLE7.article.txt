with key breakdowns handing USC the 69-65 victory last
night.
"It sucks," senior forward Fred Washington said. "It al
ways sucks to lose."
Down 62-52 with 4:30 to play, scores from Washington,

Robin Lopez and the Cardinal fell short at USC's new
Galen Center, as USC took advantage of strong
guard play to come out on top.
But then, at the most critical of
moments. Stanford choked.
First, the Cardinal drained the
Trojans'shot clock to one with 1:11 to
go. only for Nick Young to draw a
last-second foul on Washington off an
in-bounds pass. Washington, who
went down holding his knee but re
turned to the game moments later,
thought Young pulled an acting job
worthy of Den/el Washington, who
watched the game from the front row.
"It was a veteran move on his
part." Washington said. *'llc

Young missed the front end of his
one-and-one, but I JSC controlled
the offensive rebound and drew a
second foul, l.odriek Stewart then

third straight rebound and have

Robin Lopez and the Cardinal fell short at USC's new
Galen Center, as USC took advantage of strong
guard play to come out on top.
But then, at the most critical of
moments. Stanford choked.
First, the Cardinal drained the
Trojans'shot clock to one with 1:11 to
go. only for Nick Young to draw a
last-second foul on Washington off an
in-bounds pass. Washington, who
went down holding his knee but re
turned to the game moments later,

worthy of Den/el Washington, who
watched the game from the front row.
