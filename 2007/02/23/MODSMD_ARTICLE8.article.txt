In preparation for this weekend, lawns have been
mowed, floors have been vacuumed and rooms have been
tidied: parents are coming to campus.
Over 2.400 parents have already registered for Parents'
Weekend, which runs today and tomorrow, and 100 to 200
more are expected to register as the events progress.
"We are so excited to welcome Stanford families to
campus," said Parents' Weekend Registration Coordinator
Jessica Lu '09. "lor many families, this is their only oppor
tunity to see how their students live, and they come from
thousands of miles away for a few short days."
Over Thanksgiving break, the Stanford I vents Office
sent out a booklet to parents, which included an event
schedule and a registration form. As one of the "Big I ive"
events on campus — along with Reunion Homecoming.
Commencement. Admit Weekend and New Student Ori
entation — the weekend involves extensive planning.
While somewhat more popular among the parents of
freshman, upperclassmen parents still make up roughly one
half of the visitors. Aside from fresh
man dorm programming, all events
are suitable for all parents. Lu said.
Changes made to Parents' Week
end this year include new registra
tion materials, new lectures, more
performances and an opening re
ception. Events taking place over
the weekend include a Q&A ses
sion with President Hennessv, cam

pus tours and a research sympo
sium.'lTiere will also be lectures for
parents on both Friday and Satur
day on subjects ranging from
biotechnology to Mark Twain.
In addition to events planned
through the Events Office. Parents'
Weekend is also promoting events
held by various organizations on
campus. Parents will be supplied
with a detailed list of campus events
throughout the weekend, including
sporting events, religious and cul
tural events, music and drama per
formances and art exhibits.
This year, registration will be

held at the Arrillaga Alumni Cen

Union.
"We try to provide a snapshot of
the lively community that Stanford
fosters so that parents travel home
with a comforting sense that Stan
ford cares for its students and helps
them grow into intellectual, respon
sible adults," Lu said. "Students
look forward to this valuable time
to see their families: it's a very im
portant weekend from both ends."
