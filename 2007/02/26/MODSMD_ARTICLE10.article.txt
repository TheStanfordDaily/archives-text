### THERIN JONES INTERMISSION PEACH BLOSSOM 
Sometimes, I forget I'm at Stan
ford. I am college co-ed X at Amer
ican university Y. 1 risk health and
self-respect at my campus dining
hall, routinely access a large library
and fret about a blitzkrieg of up
coming deadlines.
Then. 1 see a play like "Secret
Love in Peach Blossom Land."and I
realize I could only be at Stanford.
"Secret Love" is written, translated
and directed by Stan Lai. a current
Visiting Professor in the Humani
ties at Stanford who has been called
"one of the most influential play
wrights and directors in Asia."
"Secret Love" was conceived in
"Secret Love in Peach Blossom
Land" will continue running
March 1 -3 at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. Tickets are $5 for
students and can be purchased
online at http://www.drania.
stanford.edu. Additionally, a
talk on the evolution of Chinese
theater. "Mainland Meets
Peach Blossom Land: Chinese
Theater in Transition," will be
held today at Memorial Audito
rium at 5 p.m.The talk will focus
on Stan Lai's work, specifically
"Secret Love in Peach Blossom
Land," and will be followed by a
reception.

-1986 in Lai's theater group Perfor
mance Workshop.The cast, which in
cluded his wife,spun the unusual tale
through a series of improvisational
workshops. Since then, "Secret
Love" has been reproduced hun
dreds of times, and Lai's production
is currently touring China following
a November 2006 opening in Beijing.
In 1992, there was even a film version
"The Peach Blossom Land" —
that won numerous awards in Asian
and international film festivals. 'ITie
version of "Secret Love in Peach
Blossom Land" which graces the
Stanford stage is Lai's first produc
tion of the play in English, and it has
been adapted specifically to the Bay
A rea/St an ford audienee.
Memorial Auditorium is the
venue for "Secret Love" — but not
the traditional, stadium-velveteen
seating component. Instead, the au
dience angles in the opposite direc
tion. facing the stage from backstage
in a smaller, more intimate space.The
actors and actresses are close enough
to touch and — for one unlucky stu
dent in the front row — close
enough to cringe when boulders
(prop or not) are kicked off-stage.
Whatever you're expecting when
you sit down for "Secret Love,"
you're going to be surprised. Even
the plot contour is unusual: two sep
arate casts vie for use of the same
stage. One play is dramatic and
doleful, while the other is whimsical
and irreverent. This juxtaposition
makes for a surprisingly complex
theatrical experience: at times, 1 felt

like I was watching an SNI. skit
within the frame of Wuthering
11 eights.
It's hard to pick out specific tal
ent in the cast, because each individ
ual actor and actress brings a unique
flavor. George Wyhinny's perform
ance as Jiang pins, and Richard Liu's
Master Yuan is marcato and vigor
ous. I even appreciated Rico Roque,
who sustains Ins character even
when off-stage, playing the
hunched, gum-chewing Flow while
overlooking his boss from the wings.
The scenes involving the mysteri
ous woman are particularly com
pelling, even if her mystery remains
unsolved. In one, she stands solitary
against a foreground of active, jubi

lant figures, lonely and out of place.
1 am reminded of the pivotal scene
in Michael Mann's "Collateral"
when two coyotes lope across the
Los Angeles street in front of Jamie
Fox's frazzled cab driver.The myste
rious woman is equally incongruous
with her surroundings, and the con
trast strangely gives her further di
mension.
For those uninterested in deeper
meanings or extended metaphors,
Lai peppers the plot with curse
words, pseudo-break dancing and a
hearty helping of phallic humor
(there's no coincidence that Tao t he
fisherman's net is smaller than
