## The 						'Repetitious Antics' we repeat every day 
### BY CHRISTINA McCLENDON INTERMISSION EVALUATOR 
Which are you: a feminine hetero
sexual. a masculine heterosexual, a
feminine homosexual or a masculine
homosexual? Is there more to you
than a single one of these four per
mutations includes?
Iliese are among the questions
that artists Jessica Walker and Cyane
Tornatzky ask in the exhibit "Repeti
tious Antics." currently on display at
Serra House as part of the Michelle
R. Clayman Institute for Gender Re
search's Art at the Institute initiative.
The exhibit includes six collec
tions. "Holes" is a series of photo
graphs in which a female hand reach
es into an opening — of a mailbox, a
drainage pipe and a hole in the
ground, among others. This female
penetration, says curator Karen
Rapp's write-up of the piece, is "as
absurd as it is temporarily empower
ing."
I lumor is a key element in Walker
and Tornatzky's work: their "Aero
bics for Assimilation" series is cut
tingly hilarious, recommending to
women in business such exercises as
"Bending under the glass ceiling ...
Flat back and arm extension":
"This position may cause some
strain, but if you practice throughout
the work day you will quickly become
more and more accustomed to bend
ing under your invisible barrier. This
exercise aids in curving ambition in
women and allows corporate Ameri
ca to function as it always has."
Part of their satire's impact hinges
on the suggestion of what we all.
male and female, lose when gender
becomes an all-or-nothing proposi
tion. "Gender Stereoptics," which in
vites, "Please select a stereotype
from the options above," uses an out
dated medium to show up rigid
stereotypes and how they restrict

both women and men.
"eScapes: Technology Land
scapes" addresses the blurring
boundary between technology and
the natural world: CD-Rs poke out
of sand dunes and electrical cords
slither through plants in Walker's
disconcertingly dreamy, saturated
photographs.
Finally, "Quilt for Grandmother's
Journey" and "Picket" deal with
Walker's Appalachian origins, which
she shares withTornatzky. In "Quilt."
she digitally stitches together images
of coal mines and jewelry in a self
aware use of the pattern her fore
bears brought into their own. fabric
quilts. "Picket" depicts a line of white
crayons as a picket fence, but each of
these crayons is labeled with a differ
ent racial epithet often applied to
Appalachians, such as "yokel."
"hick" and "redneck," showing that
whiteness is a racial category we cre
ate and use like any other.
Walker and Tornatzky's work
uses humor and intelligence to ad
dress gender, technology and race,
making for a highly enjoyable as well
as thought-provoking time seeing
their work first-hand.
If you have your own artistic work
on gender issues, would like to win
$300 and have your work exhibited
at the Institute in the Spring 2007
Student Art Show, contact curator
Karen Rapp
(kmrapp@stanford.edu) for more in
formation. Submissions are due on
