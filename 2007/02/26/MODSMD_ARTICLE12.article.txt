## Peanut butter moo'd 
### NATE SOLON INTERMISSION NUT 
I probably liked this drink
more than you will.
See. I like peanut butter. A

lot. Recently, in a game of'lll is or
That, I preferred a world without
artificial vision correction, flowers

and the entire Mediterranean to a
world without chunky peanut butter

(smooth peanut butter was already out). I've
been told that you can use peanut butter to fix
scratched DVDs. I don't know if it makes them
play any better, but it definitely improves the
taste.

The Peanut Butter Moo'd does an admirable
job of translating peanut butter to smoothy form.
It tastes more or less like a Reese's Cup smooth
ified. Healthwise, the original size has 25 grams of
protein.That's a lot. more than most protein bars. It
also has 32 percent of the recommended daily value
of fat. and 46 percent of carbohydrates. It should
definitely be considered more meal than snack.and
a pretty hearty meal at that. Still, if you don't mind
a few calorics, the Moo'd is worth a shot â€” even if
you've never considered getting naked and
slathering your entire body in peanut butter, if only
