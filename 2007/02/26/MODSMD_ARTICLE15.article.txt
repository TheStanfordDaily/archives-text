On Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1 only
have 10 minutes for lunch. Which
means 1 don't have lunch. I get out of
my swing dancing class at 2:05, just
late enough to miss the actual food at
Union Square, leaving me stuck with
the questionable pizza from il Piatto
twice a week. So when I got an email
from Intermission saying they wanted
someone to review a campus eater). I
remembered Ciao!. that place in the
basement of theTerman Engineering
Center. I pass it on my way to grab the
aforementioned pizza.
1 was so excited about the possi
bility of an actual lunch that I even
went on Stanford's online list of cam
pus eateries the night before to check
out the menu. 1 spotted a couple of
tasty dishes that looked promising,
and 1 invited my friend to come along
to help me sample the menu, livery
thing was golden.
But then 1 got there. To my sur
prise, the menu at the restaurant had
absolutely nothing (1 repeat, noth
ing) in common with the menu on
line. And for someone like me —
and many of my fellow students, 1
imagine — who plan ahead, this
huge discrepancy was troubling. I
fumbled with my glasses to read my
new options and choose my meal
(again). My friend was less shaken.
He decided on Momma's meat
ball panino. I chose one of the daily
specials,chicken parmigiana.but ran

into trouble yet again when the
friendly cashier told me they were all
out. Flustered, I went with the stuffed
pasta shells, another daily special. To
round out our meal, I got chicken
spring rolls, orange juice and root
beer. Our food was ready before I
was done paying for it: convenience
can occasionally be troubling, espe
cially when it comes to dining.
As a New York native, my com
panion said his sandwich was hot and
tasty but a bit small for something
that cost $5.50 in real-world dollars
(they don't take Cardinal Dollars).
The last sandwich 1 got from a
New York deli was bigger than my
head (by a lot). This one looked
good, though.
At $6.50. my dish came with two
big shells. Again, hot and tasty. The
cheese inside and the pinkish tomato
sauce complemented the shells nice
ly. But 1 voiced a similar complaint
— not enough food. And I'm not
even from New York.
After quickly finishing our main
courses, we moved on to our appetiz
er: the chicken spring rolls, yet anoth
er daily special. (Anyone who's eaten
with me in the dining hall knows 1 al
ways eat my appetizers last.) The
order comes with two giant spring
rolls; I can't decide if that's a good
deal for $4.95.They weir pretty big.
When 1 first went to order them, 1
noticed they were in the "cold food"
section. I've always liked hot spring
rolls, but I ignored my instincts and
bought it anyway: all for the sake of
Intermission. But I should have
trusted myself. Each spring roll had
chicken, lettuce and bean sprouts but
not much else, and they weren't real
ly mixed together. You had to eat
through one ingredient to get to the

others. And 1 didn't want to do that.
The roll itself looked suspiciously
like a clear Trojan Magnum with two
closed ends, and the rest didn't taste
much better (except for the chicken,
which wasn't bad).
As I sat there, torn between fin
ishing my spring roll (for Intermis
sion!) and stopping right there (for
me!). I observed the restaurant one
more time. Say what you will about
Gaol's spring rolls, but they've got
an absolutely huge selection of
drinks and snacks.
I finally decided to abandon the
effort. The spring roll just wasn't
working out for me. My friend
agreed. As we threw away our trash,
a sii>n reminded me that Ciao! offers

biodegradable containers for just a
little bit extra (15 cents. I think). 1 felt
a little bad for forgetting about that.
1 would have done it had I remem
bered.
Notebook in hand. I took one last
look at the menu before heading out.
Most of the paninisare about $5.50. In
addition to my friend's meatball pani
no.they also have chicken, turkey, and
veggie options, or you can design your
own. The rest of the menu includes
salads (from $3.50 to $6.50) and a few
more daily specials (such as chicken
piccata and prosciutto). all under $7.
You can also stop in for muffins,
bagels or coffee for breakfast.
It was good, but not great. Damn
Web site.


Fhis may or may not be what your meal will look like at Ciao!
