## 'Hello' good tunes at the 750 
### MATT RUBIN KZSU-PER REVIEWER 
Because "Stanford" and "Experi
mental Noise Rock" go together like
wine and wafers, legendary avant rock
auteurs Hella will be playing the 750
Pub this Thursday, March 1. atp.m.

'Ilie Sacramento group, originally
incarnated as a take-no-prisoners
drums and guitar duo, has recently ex
panded to a five-piece lineup in order
to perform the more elaborate
arrangements of its newest release,
"There's No 666 in Outerspace"
(Ipecac 2007).The record — which, ac
cording to Tinymixtapes.com "will
challenge you as much as anything
you've heard in the last year"— is a
blistering ode to 70s prog rock with the
requisite contemporary dose of irony.
I lella is perhaps better known for
being the band that spawned the
side-project The Advantage, the
most technically complex of all 8-bit
Nintendo cover bands. It's appropri
ate, then, that the opening band.
Who's Your Favorite Son God. is es
sentially made up of those members
of The Advantage who are not in

Holla. Holla are also affectionately
known as some of the most academ
ic purveyors of "Math Rock," a genre
dedicated to angular, arrhythmic
starts and stops. So buck up for a
challenge all you calculus majors and
math PhD students. As Pitchforkme
dia.com notes, I lella "jampacks each
song with riffs and hooks" that your
formal math training may not he able
to process.
