## 'Ines of My Soul' falls short 
### LIA HARDIN INTERMISSION SOUL CRUSHER 
Ilic best novels tell stories that
matter with perfect credibility. Is
abel Allende's latest effort."lnes of
My Soul," is compelling and ambi
tious in scope. But it was not believ
able enough for me.
It is very seldom that the story of
the brutal era of colonial 15th cen
tury South America and its con
quistadors is told without guilt. It is
very seldom that the story of con
quest is anything but a cautionary
tale of blood and calamity. But in
this novel, the narrator Ines Suarez
describes the conquest of Chile as a
success.
1 was not convinced.
Personally. 1 find this sort of bor
derland-epic concept compelling
enough to justify reading 300-page
novels written by authors much less
talented than Allende. It is the
frontier story; the tale of the Old
West. The story is supposed to cre
ate a world in which human nature
can be explored outside of the rules
constructed by civilization as we
know it.
But despite the novel's thematic
landscape, I found myself ap
proaching the book skeptically, sus
piciously analyzing the account of
an inconsistent protagonist who
seemed tot) willing to invoke spiri
tuality whenever it suited her. She
obtained power through her lover
but refused to act as though she had
any influence over him. She
seemed duplicitous.
Like the vast majority of Al
lende's protagonists, Ines was a
spirited woman who was steeped in
heritage and folklore. She had to
act like the community magician.
She saved men from dying of thirst
in the Atacama Desert. But unlike
some of Allende's prior heroines,
Ines is not a mystic. When she sees
ghosts, when she claims that skele
tons walk in the darkness, she does
not seem credible. She is far too
pragmatic a person.
'Ilie novel is written as the fic
tional memoir of the 70-year-old
Ines. She is a conquistador's concu
bine and governor's wife who de
scribes her life to an adopted
daughter, Isabel. Her narrative is
fast-paced but punctuated with
sentences that remind the audience
that the events being told have al
ready happened. The story has a
palpable sense of history and her
itage. Ines' story is important be
cause she was the governor's wife,
and a member of the expedition
that first journeyed from Cuzco to
Santiago.
F mm the very beginning, the au
dience is aware that Ines' most im
portant relationship is destined to
fail. I or a reason that is at first kept
secret, Ines does not stay with the
conquistador Pedro deValdivia. In
stead. she marries his subordinate,
the captain Rodrigo de Quiroga,
who later becomes the governor of
C hile.
Ines' life is narrated as if it is al
ways in motion. She first travels
from Spain to the New World,
where she eventually winds up in
Peru under Francisco Pizarro.

There, she meets Valdivia. and joins
his expedition to settle the land of
Chile. She narrates the expedition's
journey from Cuzco to Santiago.
I lor life's story is about both war
and civilization. The foundation of
Chile was at the expense of the Ma
puche, just as the foundation of
Peru was at the expense of the
Incas. But to Ines. the war and the
sacrifice are worthwhile. Chile, to
her. is paradise.
But Allende points out that a
place like Chile can be heaven and
hell simultaneously.
"[The New World] is paradise
only in appearance," Ines is cau
tioned. "In a hot. swampy, vora
cious world infested with reptiles
and poisonous insects, things decay
very quickly, especially the soul.
The jungle transforms men into
rogues and murderers."
ITiematically. the novel is well
realized. Allende forces the reader
to think about the unanticipated
consequences of war. Blood and
guts are present and accounted for
in Ines' world.
But Ines is not herself a conquis
tador; she was simply in love with
one. The novel is therefore unusual
in its tendency to stray from the
conquest narrative. Ines describes
herself as a civilizer. She speaks of
"founding"Chile as something sep
arate from conquering or claiming.
She speaks of building hospitals
and churches, of coordinating the
planting of Santiago's first harvest.
But although Allende doubtless
intended Ines to seem noble, the
great Founding Mother of Chile,
her character is too inconsistent to
be so worthy of respect and trust.
She does not transport the reader
to another time and place. I ler su
perstitions seem silly and ill-con
sidered, as do some of her ethical
decisions.
Allende's earlier effort "The
House of the Spirit" has been one
of my favorites since I read it in
high school, but its triumph was the
simple truth of the most outlandish
of its claims. "Ines of My Soul" lost
my interest halfway through. I
could not tell whether Allende had
meant Ines to seem duplicitous, or
if that trait was my own paranoid
invention.
The reader's lack of faith in
Ines' intentions is why I think this
novel fails.
