## Singin' the Bruin blues 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELES —For UCLA, it was
a home finale worthy of their I lollywood
locale.
Stanford peskily hung with the quicker
Bruins through the first 20-plus minutes,
hut UCLA used a 10-0 run in the early sec
ond to pull away for a 75-61 victory.
"[UCLA| got a little momentum after
getting those fast-break points," sopho
more forward Lawrence Hill said. "Other
than that. I'd say we were pretty even up to
the second half."
Aaron Afflalo scored 20 points as
UCLA (25-3, 14-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
clinched a share of the Pac-10 title with
their 20th straight victory at Pauley Pavil
ion. Despite freshman Brook Lopez's
third-straight game with over 20 points (23
points, 11 -of-16 shooting, nine rebounds),
Stanford's (17-10, 9-7) margin for error
greatly shrunk in its quest for the NCAA
Tournament.
"Every loss makes our future harder,"
Hill said.
A jumper from Darren Collison. who
coach Trent Johnson called one of the best
point guards in the country, kick-started
UCLA's run.Then came a three and a fast
break dunk from Luc Richard Mbah a
Moute (11 points), who ate up Stanford's
post defense alongside teammate Lorenzo
Mata (eight points).
"I let Luc get a couple of easy shots,"
Brook Lopez said."! le attacked the basket
and just finished around me."
A three from a wide-open Russell West
brook capped the 4:27 spurt. UCLA led 53-
40 with under 13 minutes to go and Stan
ford would pull no closer than nine for the
rest of the way.
"The turnovers were where they scored
baskets," said Trent Johnson, whose team
turned it over 16 times on the afternoon.

they got their momentum is what they've
been doing all year, going the other way
and creating steals."
The Cardinal never led the contest, hut
trailed by no more than six for the first 25
minutes. Hill's three pulled Stanford with
in three (36-33) at halftime, and another
1 lill three and a jumper from redshirt jun

score to 43-40 with 16:54 to go.
UCLA used its speed advantage to re

looks off fast breaks and screens. Still.

basket after key basket, and the Cardinal
looked able to become the first visiting
team to win at Pauley since West Virginia
did in January 2006.

riiursday s 69-65 loss at Southern
( alifornia, he was decidedly upbeat
post-game Saturday. He mentioned
several times the impact of injured
sophomore guard Anthony Goods'
absence, and implied that with a
healthy Goods, the Cardinal might
just have won.
The biggest factor was not having
an additional scoring option," said
Johnson, noting UCLA's 70-65 loss at
West Virginia with an injured Colli
son out two weeks ago. "A guy like
Anthony's hard to replace. He real
izes what he could do and what he
could mean (or his team in games like
this."
Brook Lopez agreed that Goods is
crucial to the team.
" rhere's obviously a big emotion
al shot: having Anthony Goods, that
starts our rush all the way around, and
we're missing that." he said.
Atter suffering a high ankle sprain
two weeks ago at Washington, Goods
was again evaluated yesterday. Coach
Johnson refused to lay down a
timetable for Stanford's No. 2 scorer,
but expressed guarded optimism.
"Regardless of what any doctor
says, or how he feels, I'm not going to
put any kid out there at this time of
year and let him reinjure himself,"
Johnson said. "So we've got to take a
look; but for the most part, he looks

good, and I was encouraged by what
he looked like the other day."
Meanwhile, for UCLA's star-scor
er Afflalo, the game likely marked his
last at Pauley. Fans chanted "One
more year!" postgame, imploring the
junior to bypass the NBA and return
to Westwood, but one does not need a
Ph.D. in psychology to read through
his noncommittal answer: He's all but
gone.
"I haven't put too much thought
into it," Afflalo said about declaring
for the NBA. "That's just a question
you have to answer in due time.
Again. I'm just enjoying the now."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. and 96-
year-old John Wooden, respectively
among the best players and coaches
in basketball history, were honored at
halftime alongside the rest of
UCLA's 1%7 national title team.
After the weekend sweep, Stan
ford's RPI (computer ranking)
stands at 41. and Web sites project the
Cardinal anywhere from a seven to a
10 seed in the NCAA Tournament.
With a sweep of the Arizona schools
this weekend, Stanford looks safe,
and even just with a win against bot
tom-feeder Arizona State this Thurs
day, the Cardinal look to be in decent
shape.
Meanwhile, with the nation's top
RPI. UCLA looks a safe bet for a No.
1 seed, provided they handle a visit to
Washington State this week and the
Pac-10Tournament the week after.

Taj Finger gets tangled up with UC.lA's Alfred Aboya in the first half of Saturday's game. The Cardinal
held its own until the defending Pac-10 champions proved it deserves its top-1 0 ranking.
riiursday s 69-65 loss at Southern
( alifornia, he was decidedly upbeat
post-game Saturday. He mentioned
several times the impact of injured
sophomore guard Anthony Goods'
absence, and implied that with a
healthy Goods, the Cardinal might
just have won.
The biggest factor was not having
an additional scoring option," said
Johnson, noting UCLA's 70-65 loss at
West Virginia with an injured Colli
son out two weeks ago. "A guy like
Anthony's hard to replace. He real
izes what he could do and what he
could mean (or his team in games like
this."
Brook Lopez agreed that Goods is
crucial to the team.
" rhere's obviously a big emotion
al shot: having Anthony Goods, that
starts our rush all the way around, and
we're missing that." he said.
Atter suffering a high ankle sprain
two weeks ago at Washington, Goods
was again evaluated yesterday. Coach
Johnson refused to lay down a
timetable for Stanford's No. 2 scorer,
but expressed guarded optimism.
"Regardless of what any doctor
says, or how he feels, I'm not going to
put any kid out there at this time of
year and let him reinjure himself,"
Johnson said. "So we've got to take a
look; but for the most part, he looks

good, and I was encouraged by what
he looked like the other day."
Meanwhile, for UCLA's star-scor
er Afflalo, the game likely marked his
last at Pauley. Fans chanted "One
more year!" postgame, imploring the
junior to bypass the NBA and return
to Westwood, but one does not need a
Ph.D. in psychology to read through
his noncommittal answer: He's all but
gone.
"I haven't put too much thought
into it," Afflalo said about declaring
for the NBA. "That's just a question
you have to answer in due time.
Again. I'm just enjoying the now."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. and 96-
year-old John Wooden, respectively
among the best players and coaches
in basketball history, were honored at
halftime alongside the rest of
UCLA's 1%7 national title team.
After the weekend sweep, Stan
ford's RPI (computer ranking)
stands at 41. and Web sites project the
Cardinal anywhere from a seven to a
10 seed in the NCAA Tournament.
With a sweep of the Arizona schools
this weekend, Stanford looks safe,
and even just with a win against bot
tom-feeder Arizona State this Thurs
day, the Cardinal look to be in decent
shape.
Meanwhile, with the nation's top
RPI. UCLA looks a safe bet for a No.
1 seed, provided they handle a visit to
Washington State this week and the
Pac-10Tournament the week after.

LOS ANGELES —For UCLA, it was
a home finale worthy of their I lollywood
locale.
Stanford peskily hung with the quicker
Bruins through the first 20-plus minutes,
hut UCLA used a 10-0 run in the early sec
ond to pull away for a 75-61 victory.
"[UCLA| got a little momentum after
getting those fast-break points," sopho
more forward Lawrence Hill said. "Other
than that. I'd say we were pretty even up to
the second half."
Aaron Afflalo scored 20 points as
UCLA (25-3, 14-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
clinched a share of the Pac-10 title with
their 20th straight victory at Pauley Pavil
ion. Despite freshman Brook Lopez's
third-straight game with over 20 points (23
points, 11 -of-16 shooting, nine rebounds),
Stanford's (17-10, 9-7) margin for error
greatly shrunk in its quest for the NCAA
Tournament.
"Every loss makes our future harder,"
Hill said.
A jumper from Darren Collison. who
coach Trent Johnson called one of the best
point guards in the country, kick-started
UCLA's run.Then came a three and a fast
break dunk from Luc Richard Mbah a
Moute (11 points), who ate up Stanford's
post defense alongside teammate Lorenzo
Mata (eight points).
"I let Luc get a couple of easy shots,"
Brook Lopez said."! le attacked the basket
and just finished around me."
A three from a wide-open Russell West
brook capped the 4:27 spurt. UCLA led 53-
40 with under 13 minutes to go and Stan
ford would pull no closer than nine for the
rest of the way.
"The turnovers were where they scored
baskets," said Trent Johnson, whose team
turned it over 16 times on the afternoon.
