## Singin' the Bruin blues 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELES —For UCLA, it was
a home finale worthy of their I lollywood
locale.
Stanford peskily hung with the quicker
Bruins through the first 20-plus minutes,
hut UCLA used a 10-0 run in the early sec
ond to pull away for a 75-61 victory.
"[UCLA| got a little momentum after
getting those fast-break points," sopho
more forward Lawrence Hill said. "Other
than that. I'd say we were pretty even up to
the second half."
Aaron Afflalo scored 20 points as
UCLA (25-3, 14-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
clinched a share of the Pac-10 title with
their 20th straight victory at Pauley Pavil
ion. Despite freshman Brook Lopez's
third-straight game with over 20 points (23
points, 11 -of-16 shooting, nine rebounds),
Stanford's (17-10, 9-7) margin for error
greatly shrunk in its quest for the NCAA
Tournament.
"Every loss makes our future harder,"
Hill said.
A jumper from Darren Collison. who
coach Trent Johnson called one of the best
point guards in the country, kick-started
UCLA's run.Then came a three and a fast
break dunk from Luc Richard Mbah a
Moute (11 points), who ate up Stanford's
post defense alongside teammate Lorenzo
Mata (eight points).
"I let Luc get a couple of easy shots,"
Brook Lopez said."! le attacked the basket
and just finished around me."
A three from a wide-open Russell West
brook capped the 4:27 spurt. UCLA led 53-
40 with under 13 minutes to go and Stan
ford would pull no closer than nine for the
rest of the way.
"The turnovers were where they scored
baskets," said Trent Johnson, whose team
turned it over 16 times on the afternoon.

three times during UCLA's run. "Where
they got their momentum is what they've
been doing all year, going the other way
and creating steals."
The Cardinal never led the contest, hut
trailed by no more than six for the first 25
minutes. Hill's three pulled Stanford with
in three (36-33) at halftime, and another
1 lill three and a jumper from redshirt jun
ior forward Fred Washington tightened the
score to 43-40 with 16:54 to go.
UCLA used its speed advantage to re
peatedly force turnovers and find open
looks off fast breaks and screens. Still.
Brook Lopez matched the Bruins with key
basket after key basket, and the Cardinal
looked able to become the first visiting
team to win at Pauley since West Virginia
did in January 2006.
"This Brook Lopez is something spe
cial." UCLA coach Ben I lowland said."l le
will be in the NBA at some point."
