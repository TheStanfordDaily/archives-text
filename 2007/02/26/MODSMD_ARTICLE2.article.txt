# Tree hopefuls exhibit 'strength'
## Antics and stunts attract crowds in White Plaza, slow renovation of Old Union 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Imagine a freshman taped to a
tree next to the Claw and covered in
smaller strips of tape lined along his
inner thighs, eyebrows, nipples and
chest.
It might sound like torture or a
prank gone wrong, but Tree candi
date Forrest White '10 voluntarily put
himself in this position as part of his
campaign to become the next mascot
of the Stanford Band at noon last Fri
day.
In front of a sizeable crowd. White
announced that he would attempt to
drink an entire gallon of milk while
having the tape ripped off of his body.
Midway through the gallon of milk
— which was administered at one
minute intervals by supporters —
White vomited, covering one of his
friends, both of his legs and the sur
rounding area with undigested milk.
Construction workers involved
with the renovations of Old Union
watched in amazement from their
scaffolding.
"At this rate, they'll never finish
Old Union." quipped a spectator.
After vomiting several more
times. White finished the gallon of
milk and was let down by his support
ers. A masked man then rushed out of
the crowd, grabbed some of White's
money and ran off toward the Post
Office with White following in hot
pursuit.

Later in the lunch hour, Noah
Syme '08 arrived in White Plaza on a
surfboard towed behind a golf cart.
A crowd of his supporters, armed
with eggs and water balloons,
formed a firing squad in front of the
Birdcage.
As Syme was towed by, the armed
students pelted him with their fodder.
"What time is it?" the candidate's
supporters chanted. "Syme Time!"
they answered.
A paintball gun-wielding student
pumped several rounds into Syme,
before the Tree candidate was doused
with flour and given a shot of Tapatio,
a hot sauce, after which he promptly
vomited.
The Stanford Sweat-Free Coali
tion, which had simultaneously
staged a demonstration on the other
side of the plaza, appeared irritated
by the waste and mess generated by
the campaigns.
"Do we really have to destroy so
much in order to create?" asked an
organizer on a bullhorn. "Who is
going to clean this up?"
A number of parents on campus
for the annual Parents' Weekend also
witnessed the event, which will help
to determine the successor to Tommy
Leep '07 as the Stanford Tree.
Tree stunts will continue through
Wednesday and a new tree will be an
nounced on Thursday morning.
