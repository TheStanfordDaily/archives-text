## Women's hoops narrowly edges USC 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
It was a drawn-out farewell to the regular
season yesterday for the four senior members
of the No. S Stanford women's basketball
team. Down for most of the game against
Southern ( alifornia.the Cardinal relied on its
youth to finally take the lead from the Women
of Troy and just barely hold on for the 56-53
win.
"We gutted it out," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "It was a big win for our team,
and I think USC has been playing extremely
well. It wasn't necessarily pretty; we did what
we needed to do."
In its second straight game without junior
guard Candice Wiggins, Stanford (25-4, 17-1
Pacific-10 Conference) got down and dirty
against USC (16-12.10-8). relying on its zone
defense rather than its trademark offensive
triple threat: Wiggins (average 16.3 points per
game), senior center Brooke Smith (13.9
points) and freshman center Jayne Appel
(13.5 points). The Cardinal shot just 35.6 per
cent from the field for the day and held the
Women of Troy to 28.6 percent shooting.
"This isn't pretty: this isn't us knocking
down threes and having instant offense," Van-
Derveer said. "This was gutty and gritty. We
had to play defense, we had to rebound, we
had to get some big shots. We had to battle a
little bit and get on the floor and play against
different things. I'm really proud of how peo
ple responded to challenge. I really felt that
the seniors (responded]."
In their final appearances on the Maples
Pavilion court (other than the expected
NCAA first and second rounds hosted by
Stanford). Smith and senior center Kristen
Newlin had 13 and 10 points, respectively.

"(USC) really challenged us to knock
down some shots, which I think Brooke did
and New did," VanDerveer said.
The Women of Troy challenged the Cardi
nal on all fronts. lied 4-4 at 17:14 in the half,
USC pulled away on a 7-0 run. Stanford was
able to tie it three more times before another
7-0 run gave the Women of Troy what looked
like it would soon become a large halftime
lead. 29-22. with a little over two minutes re
maining.
The Cardinal looked determined to
change that in the last 1:53, going on a 6-0 run
powered by layups from freshman point

guard Melanie Murphy, sophomore forward
Jillian I larmon and junior guard Cissy Pierce.

29.
The Women of Troy tried to rebuild their
lead.starting with a layup by Jamie Funn (four
points). B()th teams remained scoreless for the
next two minutes, but Stanford finally coun

Appel under the basket for a long pass from
near midcourt. With a swift layup, Appel gave
the Cardinal its first lead of the game since
