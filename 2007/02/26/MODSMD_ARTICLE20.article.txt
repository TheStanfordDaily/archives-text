# CARD ESCAPES TROY
## Women's hoops narrowly edges USC 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
It was a drawn-out farewell to the regular
season yesterday for the four senior members
of the No. S Stanford women's basketball
team. Down for most of the game against
Southern ( alifornia.the Cardinal relied on its
youth to finally take the lead from the Women
of Troy and just barely hold on for the 56-53
win.
"We gutted it out," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "It was a big win for our team,
and I think USC has been playing extremely
well. It wasn't necessarily pretty; we did what
we needed to do."
In its second straight game without junior
guard Candice Wiggins, Stanford (25-4, 17-1
Pacific-10 Conference) got down and dirty
against USC (16-12.10-8). relying on its zone
defense rather than its trademark offensive
triple threat: Wiggins (average 16.3 points per
game), senior center Brooke Smith (13.9
points) and freshman center Jayne Appel
(13.5 points). The Cardinal shot just 35.6 per
cent from the field for the day and held the
Women of Troy to 28.6 percent shooting.
"This isn't pretty: this isn't us knocking
down threes and having instant offense," Van-
Derveer said. "This was gutty and gritty. We
had to play defense, we had to rebound, we
had to get some big shots. We had to battle a
little bit and get on the floor and play against
different things. I'm really proud of how peo
ple responded to challenge. I really felt that
the seniors (responded]."
In their final appearances on the Maples
Pavilion court (other than the expected
NCAA first and second rounds hosted by
Stanford). Smith and senior center Kristen
Newlin had 13 and 10 points, respectively.

Newlin also had a near double-double, grab

"(USC) really challenged us to knock
down some shots, which I think Brooke did
and New did," VanDerveer said.
The Women of Troy challenged the Cardi
nal on all fronts. lied 4-4 at 17:14 in the half,
USC pulled away on a 7-0 run. Stanford was
able to tie it three more times before another
7-0 run gave the Women of Troy what looked
like it would soon become a large halftime
lead. 29-22. with a little over two minutes re
maining.
The Cardinal looked determined to
change that in the last 1:53, going on a 6-0 run
powered by layups from freshman point

guard Melanie Murphy, sophomore forward
Jillian I larmon and junior guard Cissy Pierce.
Stanford ended the half down by just one, 28-
29.
The Women of Troy tried to rebuild their
lead.starting with a layup by Jamie Funn (four
points). B()th teams remained scoreless for the
next two minutes, but Stanford finally coun
tered with a Newlin layup to bring it back
within one.
One minute later, though. Murphy found
Appel under the basket for a long pass from
near midcourt. With a swift layup, Appel gave
the Cardinal its first lead of the game since

dinal in the final minutes.
The five-point lead Appel gar
nered earlier in the half was contested
for the next 11 minutes of play, and fi
nally, at 3:34. the Women of Troy were
able to mount a comeback, tying it at
48-48. Appel responded with a mo
mentum-gaining layup to retake the
Stanford lead, only to have it rescind
ed on a three by IJSC's Morghan
Medlock (eight points).
It went back and forth from there,
with a jumper by Newlin followed by a
layup from USC's Eshaya Murphy (13
points, seven rebounds). Another
layup by Appel finally brought it back
to the Cardinal.and in the final I*l sec

56-53.
The Cardinal claimed its seventh
straight regular-season Pac-10 title,
heading into this weekend's tourna
ment as the No. 1 seed. Although yes
terday's senior day may have been a
fond farewell for Smith. Newlin,
guard Markisha Coleman and guard
Clare Bodensteiner, featuring roses
and the customary cutting of the net.
VanDerveer hopes the end is far from
over — lying somewhere after a Pac
-10 tournament title and as far as Stan
ford can go in the NCAA tourna
ment.
"We want to have a lot of games
left, and we want to send the seniors
out on the right note," she said.

18:45 in the first half.only to do it twice
more — both on assists by Murphy as
well — putting the game at 36-31. with
14:50 left in the half. Murphy ended
with a career-high 10 assists, as well as
eight points of her own.
"Mel really concentrated a lot, and
1 thought she showed great poise and
handled the ball really well." Van-
Derveer said.
Appel also showed her prowess.
Although it wasn't another dominant
double-double after last weekend's
two straight, she had a team-high 14
points in addition to nine rebounds.
Appel's play was especially important
in light of Smith's foul trouble early in
the second half, for which she subbed
out at 18:03.
"When Brooke went out, I think it
was really big for our team," Appel
said."Candice is originally our big gun,
and Brooke's our next-big gun. and
having them out puts a lot of pressure
on everyone else to perform well."
"Yo Jane, you're a big gun," Van-
Derveer retorted, commending the
freshman on yet again stepping up for
Stanford.
Despite her own major contribu
tions in Smith's absence, Appel ac
knowledged that she has learned
"everything" from the redshirt senior,
as well as fellow post Newlin. And in a
twist of fate, it was their work together

It was a drawn-out farewell to the regular
season yesterday for the four senior members
of the No. S Stanford women's basketball
team. Down for most of the game against
Southern ( alifornia.the Cardinal relied on its
youth to finally take the lead from the Women
of Troy and just barely hold on for the 56-53
win.
"We gutted it out," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "It was a big win for our team,
and I think USC has been playing extremely
well. It wasn't necessarily pretty; we did what
we needed to do."
In its second straight game without junior
guard Candice Wiggins, Stanford (25-4, 17-1
Pacific-10 Conference) got down and dirty
against USC (16-12.10-8). relying on its zone
defense rather than its trademark offensive
triple threat: Wiggins (average 16.3 points per
game), senior center Brooke Smith (13.9
points) and freshman center Jayne Appel
(13.5 points). The Cardinal shot just 35.6 per
cent from the field for the day and held the
Women of Troy to 28.6 percent shooting.
"This isn't pretty: this isn't us knocking
down threes and having instant offense," Van-
Derveer said. "This was gutty and gritty. We
had to play defense, we had to rebound, we
had to get some big shots. We had to battle a
little bit and get on the floor and play against
different things. I'm really proud of how peo
ple responded to challenge. I really felt that
the seniors (responded]."
In their final appearances on the Maples
Pavilion court (other than the expected
NCAA first and second rounds hosted by
Stanford). Smith and senior center Kristen
Newlin had 13 and 10 points, respectively.
