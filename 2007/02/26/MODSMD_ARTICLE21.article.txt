# Some mixed blessing

LOS ANGELES — Watching Stan
ford basketball is very much like dat
ing the girl next door. Most of the
time,she's great (one or two wins from
the NCAA Tournament on a team
with one starting upperclassman), but
she's not going to compare, well, to a
supermodel (say. UCLA), and you
can nitpick her flaws.
Sure, Fred can drive and defend,
hut he can't shoot. Mitch is a step slow
defensively, has been forcing passes
and can't shoot (though, don't look
now, hut he's starting to hit that three
from the right side of the arc with reg
ularity). Robin's defense is rock-solid
(and so underrated), but he's in a
monthlong slump on the other end.
Brook's normally a defensive pres
ence, but his inexperience gets ex
posed by bigs like Jon Brockman or,
just two days ago, Lorenzo Mata.
Law's a great shooter, but he can't cre
ate well off the dribble and seems to
lose his defensive focus at times.
And Cindy Crawford has a mole.
All these things are true, but
they've been analyzed to death in the
media and among fans these past few
months. If Mitch or Fred were a 40-
percent three-point shooter, or Brook
an all-conference defender, this team
would be in the top 25; however, I
don't think that's the major difference
between Stanford and a top-notch
team.

Plain and simple, the biggest difference
between Stanford and a team like
UCLA is speed.
Want proof?
Look at turnovers. Sure, sloppy
handling and youth plays a role, but at
the end of the day, fast players are able
to poke away balls better than slower
ones. Exhibit A: Darren C'ollison. And
at a minus-3 turnovers margin per
game, Stanford ranks dead-last in the
conference. Sure enough, on Saturday
the decisive factor was points off
turnovers. UCLA scored 14, Stanford
just two.
"We didn't take care of it well, and
there went the basketball game," head
coach Trent Johnson said.
While turnovers come close, ulti
mately, there's no definitive statistic
that you can point to that measures
speed, it's more like pornography
you know it when you see it. Thursday
at USC. and Saturday at Pauley, Stan
ford was slower across the board.
You could argue that most games
are won and lost in the halfcourt of
fense, not on the turnover-induced
fastbreak, but even there, speed's a
killer. On offense, Stanford's guys
often aren't quick enough to get open.
I low many possessions have you sat
through this season with Stanford try
ing to start the offense, except no one
is able to get open,and so it's Goods to
Washington to Goods to Washington

on the perimeter. If the Lopez twins
didn't attract so much attention
Brook scores through his double
teams, while Robin, despite his low
output of late, is still consistently dou
bled — this would be an even bigger
problem.
It's the real killer on defense.To be
fair, on the strength of great post de
fense, Stanford is allowing few points
overall.
But when opponents do score, it's
often by exploiting their speed. Isolate
a guard and let him break down his do
fender. (Or Stanford's defender, aware
of the speed discrepancy, lags oil and
the opponent has an open jumper or
floater in the lane.)
Set a pick, run a player around it
and Stanford struggles to keep up.
Indeed, Aaron Afflalo took
Lawrence 11 ill to school on Saturday,
running off screens. Many of his 20
points came with him running left to
right across the baseline (the post sets
the pick in the paint) and popping out
in the corner for a shot, with the long
arms of the Law a few steps behind.
Often off this play, Afflalo made
four of seven threes on the game,
many of them open. On one particu
larly bad sequence in the late first, he
not only drained a three, but also
picked up a foul on I {ill, trying to con
test the shot a split-second too late. In
the second. Hill again arrived late,
fouling him and sending him to the
line for three free throws.
So what can Stanford do to re
spond?
They can try to switch more fre
quently to zone, but that can allow op

ponents open looks and also makes
boxing out more difficult on rebounds
— Stanford's chronic problem against
use.
They can put Fred Washington on
the opponent's best scorer. Washing
ton is the one guy who pretty consis
tently keeps up on defense. The only
problem is Washington can't guard
every body, and lots of Pac-10 teams are
stacked with multiple outside scoring
threats, such as UCLA (Afflalo. Colli
son and Josh Shipp), Oregon (Aaron
Brooks, Malik 1 lairston.Tajuan Porter,
Bryce Taylor) or USC (Nick Young,
Gabe Pruitt. Lodrick Stewart).
Anthony Goods' return will help.
Casual fans celebrate his shooting
(slightly overrated if you look at the
numbers — he takes an awful lot of
shots), but hisspeed.whilebynomeans
elite, is definitely an upgrade over his
replacement Mitch Johnson's. With
Washington and Goods as a one-two
defending combo, Stanford might just
be able to squeak out a tight tourna
ment game down the road.
Ultimately though, it's a zero-sum
game — whatever Stanford does to
compensate for its speed deficit creates
another opening for an opponent to at
tack. Speed then, is Stanford's Achilles
heel, and come NCAA Tournament
timc.some faster team will knock Stan
lord out in the first few rounds.
Ihen again, every team has its
Achilles heel. Stanford just needs to ex
ploit its opponents' — and not get burnt
tcx> badly off the screens.
