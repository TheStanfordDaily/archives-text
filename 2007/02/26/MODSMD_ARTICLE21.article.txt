# Some mixed blessing

LOS ANGELES â€” Watching Stan
ford basketball is very much like dat
ing the girl next door. Most of the
time,she's great (one or two wins from
the NCAA Tournament on a team
with one starting upperclassman), but
she's not going to compare, well, to a
supermodel (say. UCLA), and you
can nitpick her flaws.
Sure, Fred can drive and defend,
hut he can't shoot. Mitch is a step slow
defensively, has been forcing passes
and can't shoot (though, don't look
now, hut he's starting to hit that three
from the right side of the arc with reg
ularity). Robin's defense is rock-solid
(and so underrated), but he's in a
monthlong slump on the other end.
Brook's normally a defensive pres
ence, but his inexperience gets ex
posed by bigs like Jon Brockman or,
just two days ago, Lorenzo Mata.
Law's a great shooter, but he can't cre
ate well off the dribble and seems to
lose his defensive focus at times.
And Cindy Crawford has a mole.
All these things are true, but
they've been analyzed to death in the
media and among fans these past few
months. If Mitch or Fred were a 40-
percent three-point shooter, or Brook
an all-conference defender, this team
would be in the top 25; however, I
don't think that's the major difference
between Stanford and a top-notch
team.
