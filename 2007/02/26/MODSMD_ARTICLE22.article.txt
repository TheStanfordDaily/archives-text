## Wrestling to send three to NCAA Championships 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling got off to a hot start
at the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships in Bakersfield, Calif, this weekend.
Through the first three sessions of the tour
nament. the Cardinal had racked up 69.5
team points, ranking fifth to eclipse last
year's final mark of 54.5.
More importantly, though. Stanford will
be sending at least three wrestlers to
March's NCAA Championships in Detroit,
Mich. No. 3 junior Tanner Gardner at 125
pounds, No. 15 junior Josh Zupancic at 157
pounds and true freshman Zack Giesen at
184 pounds all qualified for the national
tournament.
Additionally, senior Brian Perry at 165
pounds and sophomore Luke Feist at 174
pounds were each still in contention for spots
in the NCAA Championships as of press time.
The Pac-10 sends 39 wrestlers to the na-

tional tournament each year, and the top
three wrestlers in each weight class at the
Pac-l() Championships are guaranteed
spots in the NCAA Championships. Gard
ner, Zupancic and Giesen were each guar
anteed at least second-place finishes as of
Sunday night, as they were each slated to
wrestle for Pac-10 titles. Meanwhile, Feist
and Perry were awaiting their third place
matches as of press time.
Stanford's wrestling team has never won
a conference championship, even though it
competed at the NCAA level since at least
1933. At press time, Oregon State led the
overall tournament standings with 102 team
points,followed closely by Cal State-Bakers
field's 93 and UC-Davis' 89.

Women's Water Polo earn likely No.
1 ranking

It's been a long time since the Stanford
women's water polo team last held the top
spot in the national rankings — such a long
time, in fact, that none of the members of
this year's squad had even arrived on
the Farm when it last happened in
2003.
But after knocking off No. 3
Southern California, 10-8. and top
ranked UCLA, 8-4, yesterday after
noon to win the Irvine Invitational,
the Cardinal stands poised to claim
the No. 1 ranking when the results of
this week's National Top 20 poll
come out on Wednesday.
The Cardinal entered the invita
tional as the second seed in the tour
nament and posted commanding vic
tories over No. 16 Michigan and No. 6
San Jose State on Saturday to ad
vance to the semifinal round.
Playing for a spot in the tourna
ment title game, the Stanford women
powered their way past the Women
of Troy for the second time in two
weeks.The two teams battled to a 5-5
tie in the first half of play, but the Car
dinal managed to build a one-goal
lead in the third period and hung on
to win 10-8. Sophomore two-meter

defender Jessica Steffens dominated
at set. tallying four goals to pace the
Stanford attack, while senior goalie
Meridith McColl produced her best
performance of the season with 14
saves.
■ Jessica has a strong offensive
game and she took advantage
today," sophomore driver Lolo Sil
ver said. "And Meridith really
stepped up and knocked down any
thing they shot."
It was Silver's turn to shine in the
Cardinal's weekend finale against
the defending national champion
Bruins. The flame-throwing driver
from Long Beach, Calif, lit up the
back of the cage three times to near
ly single-handedly match UCLA's of
fensive output. Silver, who leads the
Cardinal with 27 goals, finished the
weekend with nine goals in four
games.
But the true highlight of Stan
ford's upset of UCLA was the Car
dinal's second-half defensive stand.
The Bruins drew within a goal when
Brittany Rowe scored early in the
third period, and the Stanford de
fense rallied to hold UCLA score
less for the remaining 14 minutes
and 25 seconds of the match. Tlie

Cardinal scored three more times
during that period of time to put the
game out of reach by a comfortable
four-goal margin. By the time the
final horn sounded. McColl had
recorded 12 saves against the Bruins
to conclude the day with a phenom
enal total of 26 saves.

The short answer to how we
kept UCLA scoreless for the last 14
minutes," said senior co-captain
Katie Hansen, "was Meridith Mc-
Coll."
