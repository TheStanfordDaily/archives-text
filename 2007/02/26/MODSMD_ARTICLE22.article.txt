## Wrestling to send three to NCAA Championships 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling got off to a hot start
at the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships in Bakersfield, Calif, this weekend.
Through the first three sessions of the tour
nament. the Cardinal had racked up 69.5
team points, ranking fifth to eclipse last
year's final mark of 54.5.
More importantly, though. Stanford will
be sending at least three wrestlers to
March's NCAA Championships in Detroit,
Mich. No. 3 junior Tanner Gardner at 125
pounds, No. 15 junior Josh Zupancic at 157
pounds and true freshman Zack Giesen at
184 pounds all qualified for the national
tournament.
Additionally, senior Brian Perry at 165
pounds and sophomore Luke Feist at 174
pounds were each still in contention for spots
in the NCAA Championships as of press time.
The Pac-10 sends 39 wrestlers to the na-

tional tournament each year, and the top
three wrestlers in each weight class at the
Pac-l() Championships are guaranteed
spots in the NCAA Championships. Gard
ner, Zupancic and Giesen were each guar
anteed at least second-place finishes as of
Sunday night, as they were each slated to
wrestle for Pac-10 titles. Meanwhile, Feist
and Perry were awaiting their third place
matches as of press time.
Stanford's wrestling team has never won
a conference championship, even though it
competed at the NCAA level since at least
1933. At press time, Oregon State led the
overall tournament standings with 102 team
points,followed closely by Cal State-Bakers
field's 93 and UC-Davis' 89.
