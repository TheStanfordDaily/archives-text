## Little breathing room Cardinal heads on crucial Arizona trip 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With only three more tournaments left
until postseason play, there is little room
for errors or excuses for the No. 7 Stanford
women's golf team.
The Cardinal women head to Ilicson,
Ariz, today for the Arizona Wildcat Invita
tional held at the 6,238-yard, par-71 Ari
zona National Golf Course. The two-day
long invitational features 36 holes today
and 18 holes tomorrow. Today Stanford is
set to tee off at 7 a.m. PST.
The squad is coming off of a below-ex
pectation eighth place finish at the
Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge,
where it failed to adjust to the inclement
weather and rare playing surface.The high
winds and cold weather inflated all individ
ual rounds for the first two days of play, and
Palos Verdes Golf Course's Kakuya grass
threw the players off of their regular game.
It was also their first tournament of 2(X)7
after nearly four months of downtime.
Head coach Caroline O'Connor said
she and her squad are ready to put the past
behind them.
"This is a golf course where we have
played well in the past, and everyone's con

lidence levels are high." O'Connor said.
"So. we re going to go out and stick to our
game plan. Last week was last week. Sure,
we didn t linish as highly as we would have
liked to, but we learned some things from
it; we worked on it in practice and we're
moving forward."
Starting today, the squad will try to
bounce back lroni last week's sub-par per
formance and gain momentum heading
into the Pacific-10 Conference Women's
Golf ( hampionship in April and eventual
ly the NC AA Women's Golf Champi
onship in May.
However, the playing field won't help
the ( ardinal cause for a second straight
week. Last week, the team competed
amongst 14 teams in the top 50 and five in
the top 10 nationally.Today, the Card find
themselves in a pool of 13 teams in the top
50 and seven teams in the top 10.
The upper-echelon competition con
sists of No. 2 Arizona State; the two-time
defending national champion. No. 3 Duke;
the team champion of last week's Chal
lenge; No. 4 Pepperdine; No. 5 Vanderbilt;
No. 8 Virginia; and the host. No. 10 Ari
zona. Other Pac-10 conference opponents
include No. 11 Southern California. No. 14
UCLA and California.
"A majority of the teams in this country
aren't even playing golf yet," O'Connor
said. "We're seeing teams from the East
Coast, the Northeast and the Midwest that
haven t been on the golf course since last
fall. Sd this is still early in the spring season."
Stanford won't enter the Invitational without its
own arsenal of players as well. ITie lineup for today's
event includes three players ranked among the top 30
by Golfweek Magazine. The Cardinal is led by senior
captains No. 21 JenniferTangtiphaiboontana, who tied
for 14th overall at last week's Challenge, and No. 27
Lauren Todd, who finished 26th.
"Our seniors, Lauren lodd and Jennifer
Tangtiphaiboontana, lead our team on and off the golf
course," O'Connor said. "They've been such tremen
dous captains; strong, solid and stable for us. I expect
that they are the ones that are leading us through
everything."
Following Tangtiphaiboontana and Todd is sopho
more No. 2 l ) Mari Chun, who finished 37th at last
week's Challenge. Chun, who was named Golfweek's
Player of the Week after Stanford's win at the Edean
Ihlanfeldt tournament in 2006. had dropped 15 places
during the final day with a nine-over-par. However,
O'Connor expects different results this week.
"Mari hit a stretch of three or four holes where she
didn't hit it great in the final round at Palos Verdes,"
O'Connor said. "On that golf course there is so little
room for error that a couple small mistakes can turn
into big numbers. But Maris fine, she's hitting it well
and this is a golf course that sets up very well for her.
She has such tremendous touch around the green and
such great short game that I anticipate her coming out
and playing well in Arizona." Rounding off the lineup,
in which no spots are secure, are sophomore ki-Shui
Liao and freshman Catherina Wang.
"We're still having people fighting to get into the
lineup." O'Connor said, "it's not like a sport where
you can substitute people in between plays. It's been a
few months since we've last competed, so every day is
an opportunity to get better and understand better
our strengths and weakness and improve on those."
After the poor showing at the Northrop Grumman
Challenge, the Cardinal dropped only two places in
the national rankings to No. 7. Another sub-par per
formance this week cannot guarantee a similar favor
able shift in positioning, especially with so many
teams ranked in the top 15.
Still. O'Connor expressed the utmost faith and
confidence in her squad.
"In competitive golf, two months is a long way
away," she said. "There is so much golf yet to be
played. Golf is a journey; it's a marathon, not a hun
dred yard dash. We just need to pace ourselves, and
prepare ourselves physically and mentally for each
tournament. I feel confident about where we are right
now."
