## Little breathing room Cardinal heads on crucial Arizona trip 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With only three more tournaments left
until postseason play, there is little room
for errors or excuses for the No. 7 Stanford
women's golf team.
The Cardinal women head to Ilicson,
Ariz, today for the Arizona Wildcat Invita
tional held at the 6,238-yard, par-71 Ari
zona National Golf Course. The two-day
long invitational features 36 holes today
and 18 holes tomorrow. Today Stanford is
set to tee off at 7 a.m. PST.
The squad is coming off of a below-ex
pectation eighth place finish at the
Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge,
where it failed to adjust to the inclement
weather and rare playing surface.The high
winds and cold weather inflated all individ
ual rounds for the first two days of play, and
Palos Verdes Golf Course's Kakuya grass
threw the players off of their regular game.
It was also their first tournament of 2(X)7
after nearly four months of downtime.
Head coach Caroline O'Connor said
she and her squad are ready to put the past
behind them.
"This is a golf course where we have
played well in the past, and everyone's con

lidence levels are high." O'Connor said.
"So. we re going to go out and stick to our
game plan. Last week was last week. Sure,
we didn t linish as highly as we would have
liked to, but we learned some things from
it; we worked on it in practice and we're
moving forward."
Starting today, the squad will try to
bounce back lroni last week's sub-par per
formance and gain momentum heading
into the Pacific-10 Conference Women's
Golf ( hampionship in April and eventual
ly the NC AA Women's Golf Champi
onship in May.
However, the playing field won't help
the ( ardinal cause for a second straight
week. Last week, the team competed
amongst 14 teams in the top 50 and five in
the top 10 nationally.Today, the Card find
themselves in a pool of 13 teams in the top
50 and seven teams in the top 10.
The upper-echelon competition con
sists of No. 2 Arizona State; the two-time
defending national champion. No. 3 Duke;
the team champion of last week's Chal
lenge; No. 4 Pepperdine; No. 5 Vanderbilt;
No. 8 Virginia; and the host. No. 10 Ari
zona. Other Pac-10 conference opponents
include No. 11 Southern California. No. 14
UCLA and California.
"A majority of the teams in this country
aren't even playing golf yet," O'Connor
said. "We're seeing teams from the East
Coast, the Northeast and the Midwest that
haven t been on the golf course since last
