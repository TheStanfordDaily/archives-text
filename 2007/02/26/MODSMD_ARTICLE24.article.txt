## Stanford sweeps Kansas at Sunken 
### ANDREW LOMELI DESK EDITOR 
All of a sudden, the Stanford baseball
team has a little bit of a winning streak.
After a less-than-flattering start to the
2007 campaign, the Cardinal (7-5) is now
the winner of five straight after having
swept Kansas (7-4) at Sunken Diamond
this past weekend. With the three victories,
Stanford remains undefeated at home, 6-0.
Sophomore southpaw Jeremy Bleich
(1-1) captured his first win, fanning a ca
reer-high seven and allowing two runs on
seven hits over six innings, while junior
right-handed reliever David Stringer
evaded a ninth-inning Jayhawk comeback
to pick up his fourth save in yesterday's 7-
6 win. Junior catcher Brian Juhl knocked
his first career grand slam in a five-run
third inning that put the Cardinal ahead
for good.
Bleich hit three Kansas batters in the
first, though the Jayhawks would only cash
in one run on one hit while stranding three.
Stanford right fielder Michael Tay
lor set the tone for the Cardinal's offensive
afternoon effort, knocking a two-out solo
homer in the bottom half of the first.
Stanford's bats exploded in the third,
collecting five runs on three hits in an ef
fort capped by Juhl's two-out grand slam.
Kansas' leftfielder John Allman singled-in
third baseman Robbie Price in the fifth,
but the Cardinal responded in the bottom
of the frame when sophomore left fielder
Jeff Whitlow drove in sophomore first
baseman Brent Milleville.
The Jayhawks would nab two more
runs in the eighth before setting up a
stressful ninth. Pinch-hitter Casey Larson
flied out to left, scoring Price. Kansas got a
runner on third with two outs, but Stringer
struck out right fielder Brock Simpson to
end the game.

Kansas' inability to cash in their run
ners inevitably made the difference: Tlie
Jayhawks left 13 runners on base, com
pared to the Cardinal's four.
A three-run seventh inning propelled
Stanford to a 4-1 win on Saturday. Fresh
man right-hander Andrew Clauson picked
up his first career win in 2 1/10 innings of
relief, and Stringer notched the final two
outs of the ninth to tally the save.
Kansas struck first when shortstop Erik
Morrison flied out to right field, scoring
Price in the third. Senior third baseman
Ryan Seawall evened the games on Tay
lor's single in the fourth.
The game's only other offense would
come in the seventh, which was jumpstart
ed with a Juhl double down the rightfield
line. A sacrifice bunt would move pinch
runner sophomore J.J. Jelmini to third, and
he reached home on a double off the bat of
sophomore second baseman Cord Phelps.
Phelps and junior pinch-hitter Brendan
Domaracki were later driven in to cement
the 4-1 score.

Freshman Stanford starter Jeffrey
Inman was pulled in the fifth after having
allowed five hits and four walks with five
strikeouts.The Jayhawks Nick Czyz took
the loss on eight runs and three earned
runs with five strikeouts.
The Cardinal just squeaked by Kansas
yesterday with a 6-5 victory. Stanford
broke the match open with a five-run first
inning, led off by a Seawall round-tripper.
Sophomore centerfielder Sean Ratliff and

Taylor hit back-to-back singles before a
throwing error and a walk to Milleville led
the bases. Juhl Hied out to right field, scor
ing Ratliff. Still with just one out in the in
ning, Kansas' Zach Ashwood surrendered
a three-run shot to left fielder Jeff Whitlow
before striking out the next two batters.
Kansas' rally came incrementally. The
Jayhawks managed a lone run in the top of

the second as catcher Buck Afenir
drove in first baseman Preston Land
in a frame that would see two left on
base.
Morrison singled in Allman in the
third, before being hit by a pitch to
open the sixth. I lis free pass was later
cashed in by a fielding error. But
Stanford added some insurance in
the bottom of the same inning, as a
dropped foul ball led to Phelps
grounding out to second to collect an
unearned run on Milleville.
