## Editorial Board IHUM board gets it right 
### 
The Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) governance board's sugges
tion last week to shorten section times
and make the program worth fewer units is
a welcome and admirable plan. By making
sections more compact and weighing the
classes less, the changes would show a laud
able dedication to student concerns, im
prove flexibility for freshmen and still main
tain the integrity of IHUM.
For many freshmen, scheduling 15 units
of IHUM over the course of the year can re
strict other courses considerably, especially
if they stick to the recommended 15 units a
quarter. As they enter their first year at the
University, they should have as many op
portunities as possible to sample the diverse
offerings while getting a solid foundation in
basic education. Reducing the number of
units for IHUM (even by one unit) would
give a good balance —students have more
freedom to choose courses of general inter
est but still getting a broad-based education
in the humanities.
Additionally, shortening the 90-minute

section times to 50 minutes should make
discussion more focused and more produc
tive. Since discussion sections for many or
dinary lecture classes are 50-minutes a
week, two 50-minute sections for IHUM
more closely mimics what freshmen will ex
perience in other classes though still pro
viding twice as much discussion time. By
curbing discussion section times, the frus
tration some students feel while trying to
schedule other classes should be ameliorat
ed.
Finally, the I HUM governance board
should he praised for its efforts to gather
student opinions and take measures to ad
dress the problems raised. Their investiga
tion and suggested revision of program
structure demonstrated a real dedication to
students that extends beyond a superficial
acknowledgment of complaints.
We would like to applaud the IHUM
governance board's plan, and we urge the
Faculty Senate to approve the measure and
place the matter under the governance
board's jurisdiction.
