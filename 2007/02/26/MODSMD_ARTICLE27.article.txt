# Killing brain cells, anecdotally speaking
## 
### 
I think I'm losing my mind, or at least that
part of my mind concerned with memory.
I'm scared, because as your memory
starts to fade, not only are you moving closer
to death, but. worse, toward utter stupidity.
Growing up. I used to say I had the best
memory in town. Even my dad. who brags
at family gatherings about the exact
weight, length and species of every fish he,
his brother, all his cousins and your mom
caught at such and such river some three
decades ago. could not match me in sheer
ability to recall useless information, like
what we ordered at Applebee's in that god
forsaken New Hampshire strip mall back
in '95. for example.
So when the Trivia Man (don't ask for his
real name — 1 forget it) used to come to our
school or the occasional Bar/Bat Mitzvah
and patently wow the audience with his
inane, bordering-on-sketchy acquaintance
with the ins and outs of popular culture
(largely limited to boy bands, sitcoms and
maybe something to do with the Red Sox), I
was never really impressed. I knew that my
memory was equally sharp, though less in
undated with vile, useless crap like Hilary
Duff's entire discography, and I thought it
would stay that way forever.
The Trivia Man used to preach at the end
of his shows, a sort of moralizing, self-ag
grandizing speech about the evils of drugs
and alcohol.and why/'lf you touch the stuff,
you can never be as smart as me. because
drugs kill brain cells, and that kills yer mem
ory."
During my early days at Stanford, I never
really bought into the Trivia Man's whole
"drug and alcohol makes you dumb" shtick.
Not that I partake in such debauchery, espe
cially now that my parents supposedly read
this column. But the point is. I was largely
agnostic about the whole "losing brain cells"
thing.
Yet right now. a year and a half later. I'm
convinced that information is leaking out
of my porous. Mad Cow-style brain like a
sieve. Why?
I often attribute (read: blame) my new
found idiocy and inability to recall any in
formation to a freak bike accident I. er. was
"involved in" last spring (read: total dingus
move on my part).
It was one of those picturesque, sunny
Stanford afternoons. I was cycling along the
breezy arcades of the Quad by the Math
Corner, taking my sweet time getting to
class. Oh, how I pine for those days, before
our sacred freedom to bike in the arcades of
the Quad was wrenched away from us by
that unholy administration....But, 1 digress. I
spotted a good-looking staircase off to the
side. and. as I often like to do. I decided to
take the plunge.
Believe me. I fly down staircases all the
time. It comes with the territory — I'm an
extremely extreme kind of guy (or not). But
that day. something went horribly wrong. It
was probably a lack of horizontal velocity,
come to think of it. My front wheel got stuck

somewhere halfway down the stairs, and. as
it happens, the rest of me and my bike con
tinued forward.The next thing 1 knew 1 was
flying over the handlebars, on a crash course
to the ground, like a bird stuffed with shot. It
happened in slow-motion, as in the movies,
and 1 recall that my life flashed before my
eyes. I thought, lucidly as ever: "Uh oh. I'm
freefalling. This could be bad. I'm going to
hit my head. Should I put my hands out? Too
late. Here we go."
And then... Splat. I managed to land on
my cheekbone, instead of my forehead or
temple, and that probably saved me a lot of
trouble. But it was still a face-first, head-on
collision with a slab of asphalt. Not good.
My RA wanted to take me to the emer
gency room. My roommate told me a story
about a kid from middle school who, after
slipping on spilt milk and hitting his head on
the cafeteria floor, went to bed that night
and didn't wake up. Of course, it wasn't until
after the horror stories and panicked RAs
that 1 started feeling (read: imagining) the
concussion symptoms.
Well. I'm here today, alive and kicking.
But I swear. I woke up the next morning,
after my "accident." a new man. A new, stu
pider man. who couldn't concentrate, keep
tacts straight, and who spent the rest of
spring quarter and all of summer worrying
about the state of his mental capacity.
That man was delusional. Sure, the crash
might not have been exceedingly beneficial
to the well-being of my little family of neu
rons upstairs. And all that drunken de
bauchery you people (not me) like to re
gale in certainly wouldn't help either. But
sooner or later, many of us have got to real
ize: We're getting older. Not old—older.
My transition into the third decade of life
will be a lot smoother if I just come to grips
with a simple fact: Losing one's memory is
a part of growing up. I'm not growing any
more brain cells here — that I've got to ac
cept.
My only hope is that with every adoles
cent mistake I make, falling down staircases
and so forth. I'll come out with an ounce
more wisdom to take forward. Because I'm
going to need it. What else could possibly re
place my trusty old memory?
Freaking brain cells. Can't a guy get a
photographic memory around here?

You can admonish Alex for his had decision
making at acoleyo9@stanford.edu, hut he al
ready knows that wearing a helmet is really, re
ally important, so if that's what you want to
say, don't waste your time.
