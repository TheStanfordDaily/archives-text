To protest the University's ab
sence from the Worker Rights
Consortium (WRC) and the Desig
nated Suppliers Program (DSP),
the Stanford Sweat-Free Coalition
sewed dozens of T-shirts into a
large quilt last Friday during a
noontime demonstration in White
Plaza.
After several students worked
for about an hour making the quilt,

Coalition coordinator Daniel Shih
'09 changed into a suit and, assum
ing the role of a business executive,
presented the workers with a check
for 37 cents — an act that Coalition
members hope will draw attention
to the sub-standard wages that
sweatshop workers receive.
"The concept is to show stu
dents and visiting parents what
sweatshop conditions are like,"
said Theresa Zhen '09. "Thirty
seven cents for an hour of labor is
hardly living wage. Since meeting

with President [John] Hennessy,
we are dedicating more time to
ward spreading the word about
our campaign, gaining more sup
port and expanding our influ
ence."

Students from the Stanford Sweat-Free Coalition rallied in White Plaza on Friday to sew a quilt with Stanford T-shirts to
highlight the University's unwillingness to accept the Worker Rights Consortium and Designated Suppliers Program.
Coalition (SI. AC) and ASSII have
supported the Coalition's move
ment to lobby the University to en
sure that its apparel is not produced
in sweatshops.
On Feb. 13, the ASSI I Under
graduate Senate approved a resolu
tion that called tor Stanford's entr\
into the WRC' and I )Sl' organiza
tions that both monitor and ensure
that conditions in factories produc
ing collegiate apparel are sweat
shop-free.
Despite the outpouring of student
support for the Coalition, the Uni
versity has not publicly revealed
what course of action it plans to take
with regard to the group's demands.
()n Feb. 16.1 lenn ess\ and Director
of Uusiness I )evclopinent Susan We
instcin held a meeting with about 70
Coalition members to discuss their
concerns and some of the group's
proposals.
"It was a positive action.and I be

lieve tlicit progress was made." Shih
said. "We established a eommon
ground in the belief that Stanford
should play a more active role to
help make the labor environment
sweat-free."
"We're one step closer to insuring
that the indirect employees of Stan
ford I Jniversity have their rights up
held by two commendable organiza
tions." Coalition co-organizer Mark
Liu '07 said. "Hopefully, they will
soon get long-term contracts, com
pensation. living wages and clean
working environments."
Coalition members have sched
uled another meeting with Wcin
stein for Mar. l ). but until then, they
expressed hope that more students
would learn about sweatshops and
that the I Jniversity would follow the
166 institutions that have become
members of the WRC and the 33
that have endorsed the DSl'
"Stanford is already a leader in
sports and aeademia." Shili said."We
hope it will become a champion for
human riuhts as well."
