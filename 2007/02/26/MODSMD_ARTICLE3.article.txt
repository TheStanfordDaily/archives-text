To protest the University's ab
sence from the Worker Rights
Consortium (WRC) and the Desig
nated Suppliers Program (DSP),
the Stanford Sweat-Free Coalition
sewed dozens of T-shirts into a
large quilt last Friday during a
noontime demonstration in White
Plaza.
After several students worked
for about an hour making the quilt,

Coalition coordinator Daniel Shih
'09 changed into a suit and, assum
ing the role of a business executive,
presented the workers with a check
for 37 cents â€” an act that Coalition
members hope will draw attention
to the sub-standard wages that
sweatshop workers receive.
"The concept is to show stu
dents and visiting parents what
sweatshop conditions are like,"
said Theresa Zhen '09. "Thirty
seven cents for an hour of labor is
hardly living wage. Since meeting

with President [John] Hennessy,
we are dedicating more time to
ward spreading the word about
our campaign, gaining more sup
port and expanding our influ
ence."
