# Social filters of sophistication

I take my coffee black. No exceptions. Even
though, to be perfectly honest. I find black
coffee pretty disgusting. There's nothing
more delectable than a good latte or mocha
with some flavorful syrup and whipped cream
on top. but the idea of any kind of dairy or
sugary substance entering my cup makes me
a little sick. Coffee isn't about drinking some
thing tasty. It's not even about filling one's
body with absurd levels of caffeine. No. coffee
is a way of life.
My relationship with coffee is an intense
and complex one that I take very seriously.
And I'm a firm proponent of the theory that
one's coffee drinking preferences define one's
very essence. After all. who among us has not
bonded over discussions of the ideal tempera
ture and pressure for brewing espresso or bro
ken a relationship because he refused to give
up his caramel hazelnut swirl creamer?
As I see it. there are four distinct types of
coffee drinkers in the world. And most of the
time, they don't mix.
ITie Alternative Abstainer snubs all coffee
substances, choosing instead alternative hot
beverages (i.e., tea, hot chocolate and/or
apple cider). The Abstainer is most likely a
vegetarian environmentalist who goes to the
gym on a daily basis. Ibis is a foreign and truly
frightening concept and merits no further dis
cussion here.
The second,The Starbucks Socialite, is one
with which I identified during my many years
of drinking mochas and lattes. In fact, until
this summer. I drank only such milky concoc
tions. At Moonbean's,the baristas would start
preparing my double raspberry mocha as
soon as I got in line, so regular was my order.
For this crowd, coffee is a shared ex
perience. Socialites gather at Starbucks in
groups of three or four, gossiping over coffee
esque beverages and scones. For these social
butterflies, coffee is not an end in and of itself,
but merely a means to mingle. The other so
cial lubricant, if you will.
But as popular as Starbucks is. I'd say a lit
tle more than half of the socialites eventually
see the error of their ways and cross over into
the third category: The Timid Tainter. The
Tainter is almost always a reformed socialite.
He has realized that a frappuccino doesn't ac
tually count as coffee and tries to correct his
blunder by switching to "regular" coffee, but
can't quite manage to escape the temptation
of milk and suuar. I le wants to like coffee, tries

to like coffee and thinks he has succeeded. He
takes pride in his one to three cups a day —
disregarding the shame of the creamy taint.
Sometimes, The Tainter manages to break
the barrier, give up the milk and join the
fourth group: The Snobby Sophisticate. I
broke that barrier during a three-month stint
as a hard-hitting reporter in Los Angeles
when I tried to impress my black-coffee
drinking bosses. By the end of the summer. I
was averaging five to six cups of disgustingly
bitter, untainted coffee a day. I was a bona
fide Sophisticate.
Now. to be fair, like the majority of Sophisti
cates, I doubt I actually have any kind of physi
cal or emotional dependency on this dark.caf
feinated elixir. I could easily go back to my de
licious raspberry mocha without suffering any
serious withdrawals. But, fact of the matter is, I
don't. 1 willingly and happily choose to drink
the disgusting brew (which is especially dis
gusting considering the sub par coffee-brewing
techniques available at campus cafes) because,
for The Sophisticate, coffee is an intense emo
tional experience. The Sophisticate drinks her
coffee black, frequently and in solitude.
It's a bizarre phenomenon of the coffee
world that once an individual is initiated into
this cult-like final group, there's no turning
back.The creamer may be delicious, but its al
lure is no more. The cafe rendezvous, the se
ductive swirl of white into the black, the
come-hither call of the sugar — that coy
minx! — have all lost their sex appeal.
It could be an addiction,it could be the be
lief that drinking black coffee is the pinnacle
of cool (after all, black coffee and intelli
gentsia go together like Marx and Engels) or
it could be something else — something in
tangible, a vague sense of fidelity toward the
drink, honoring your promise to keep it pure.

I take my coffee black. No exceptions. Even
though, to be perfectly honest. I find black
coffee pretty disgusting. There's nothing
more delectable than a good latte or mocha
with some flavorful syrup and whipped cream
on top. but the idea of any kind of dairy or
sugary substance entering my cup makes me
a little sick. Coffee isn't about drinking some
thing tasty. It's not even about filling one's
body with absurd levels of caffeine. No. coffee
is a way of life.
My relationship with coffee is an intense
and complex one that I take very seriously.
And I'm a firm proponent of the theory that
one's coffee drinking preferences define one's
very essence. After all. who among us has not
bonded over discussions of the ideal tempera
ture and pressure for brewing espresso or bro
ken a relationship because he refused to give
up his caramel hazelnut swirl creamer?
As I see it. there are four distinct types of
coffee drinkers in the world. And most of the
time, they don't mix.
ITie Alternative Abstainer snubs all coffee
substances, choosing instead alternative hot
beverages (i.e., tea, hot chocolate and/or
apple cider). The Abstainer is most likely a
vegetarian environmentalist who goes to the
gym on a daily basis. Ibis is a foreign and truly
frightening concept and merits no further dis
cussion here.
The second,The Starbucks Socialite, is one
with which I identified during my many years
of drinking mochas and lattes. In fact, until
this summer. I drank only such milky concoc
tions. At Moonbean's,the baristas would start
preparing my double raspberry mocha as
soon as I got in line, so regular was my order.
For this crowd, coffee is a shared ex
perience. Socialites gather at Starbucks in
groups of three or four, gossiping over coffee
esque beverages and scones. For these social
butterflies, coffee is not an end in and of itself,
but merely a means to mingle. The other so
cial lubricant, if you will.
But as popular as Starbucks is. I'd say a lit
tle more than half of the socialites eventually
see the error of their ways and cross over into
the third category: The Timid Tainter. The
Tainter is almost always a reformed socialite.
He has realized that a frappuccino doesn't ac
tually count as coffee and tries to correct his
blunder by switching to "regular" coffee, but
can't quite manage to escape the temptation
of milk and suuar. I le wants to like coffee, tries

to like coffee and thinks he has succeeded. He
takes pride in his one to three cups a day —
disregarding the shame of the creamy taint.
Sometimes, The Tainter manages to break
the barrier, give up the milk and join the
fourth group: The Snobby Sophisticate. I
broke that barrier during a three-month stint
as a hard-hitting reporter in Los Angeles
when I tried to impress my black-coffee
drinking bosses. By the end of the summer. I
was averaging five to six cups of disgustingly
bitter, untainted coffee a day. I was a bona
fide Sophisticate.
Now. to be fair, like the majority of Sophisti
cates, I doubt I actually have any kind of physi
cal or emotional dependency on this dark.caf
feinated elixir. I could easily go back to my de
licious raspberry mocha without suffering any
serious withdrawals. But, fact of the matter is, I
don't. 1 willingly and happily choose to drink
the disgusting brew (which is especially dis
gusting considering the sub par coffee-brewing
techniques available at campus cafes) because,
for The Sophisticate, coffee is an intense emo
tional experience. The Sophisticate drinks her
coffee black, frequently and in solitude.
It's a bizarre phenomenon of the coffee
world that once an individual is initiated into
this cult-like final group, there's no turning
back.The creamer may be delicious, but its al
lure is no more. The cafe rendezvous, the se
ductive swirl of white into the black, the
come-hither call of the sugar — that coy
minx! — have all lost their sex appeal.
It could be an addiction,it could be the be
lief that drinking black coffee is the pinnacle
of cool (after all, black coffee and intelli
gentsia go together like Marx and Engels) or
it could be something else — something in
tangible, a vague sense of fidelity toward the
drink, honoring your promise to keep it pure.
