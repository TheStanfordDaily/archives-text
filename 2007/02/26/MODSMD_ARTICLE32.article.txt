Parents headed to White Plaza after a question and answer session with President John Hennessy Friday afternoon. At the event, members of the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) protested the University's living wage policy by passing out informational materials to parents and unveiling
a 30-foot long poster that read, "Henny Henny, Saves a Penny / Results Few, Promises Many / Real Living Wage Now!"
