### AMIT ARORA DESK EDITOR 
A smiling President John Hen
nessy juggling a roll of money, a
diploma and a computer chip glazed
the cover of The Wall Street Journal

(WSJ) yesterday-
Accompanying the
photo was a 3.287-
word-long article
documenting the
president's private
investments in a
number of techno
logical corpora
tions and his eight
figure profits over
the last five years.

The WSJ calculated that, as a re
sult of his investments in several ven
ture-capital funds and his roles on
the boards of several Silicon Valley
firms, Hennessy made $43 million
over the last live years â€” a number
far greater than the president's annu
al University salary of $hl6.()()().
The WSJ found some similarities
between the University's invest
ments and Hennessy's own. and sug
gested that in some instances compa


Hennessy
nies endorsed by I lenncssy received
funding from venture-capital funds
in which the president had also in
vested. Iwo companies the WSJ
claims Hennessy unofficially sup
ported Pelibit Networks and
Atheros ("ommunications. for exam

pie received financial backing
Irom Foundation Capital, a firm in
which Hennessy and the Stanford
Endowment are both investors.
While some administrators at
other universities questioned
whether it was possible for I lenncssy
to keep his private investments from
affecting his role as Stanford's presi
dent, Hurton McMurty, the chair of
the Hoard of Irustees. and Debra
Zumwalt. general counsel for the
I Iniversitv,both suimested that I Jen

nessy's private dealings in no way af
fected the Stanford's investment de
cisions and that protections had
been made to protect against any po
tential conflicts of interests.
Moth McMurty and Zumwalt also
told the WSJ that Hennessy has re
vealed details about his private in
vestments to both of them, but they
declined to provide that information.
While it is not uncommon for
presidents of universities to have po
sitions on corporate boards, the WSJ

focused heavily on the similarities in
I lennessy's and the I Jniversitv's in
vestments, which it suggested were
unique.
I Jltimately. though, high-ranking
I Jniversity officials ;is well ;is corpo
rate executives touted llennessy's
commitment to ethics and claimed
that all efforts have been taken to
avoid creating ethical conflicts.
