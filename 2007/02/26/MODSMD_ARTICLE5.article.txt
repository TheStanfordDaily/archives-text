## Milky water frightens Clear water to return Tuesday after weeks 
### ARAM HUR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Marian Lee '07 woke up
earlier this month and turned on the
water in her bathroom, she was sur
prised to see the faucet spew out
milky white water as opposed to the
usual clear stream.
She is not alone. Complaints
about the water have risen in dorms
across campus from Wilbur toToyon
to Roble, and while housing authori
ties stressed the water's safety, many
students have expressed disgruntle
ment at the way the administration
has handled the problem.
In mid-February, two weeks after
the water began to appear milky. Stu
dent Housing emailed notifications
to resident email lists, but students
said they found the explanations too
vague.
"They should've let the students
know before the water turned
milky," Lee said. "They sent an email
weeks after it happened, basically
saying'don't worry, it's not toxic."'
The notification's ambiguity
spurred more student questions and
doubts.
"It just doesn't look like air to
me," said one Tovon resident."Logi
cally. air is clear too. right? It must be
some kind of buildup."
"I thought about my skin." Lee
added. "What if the water has all
these poisonous substances thai
could ruin my health? I don't turn on
hot water anymore — it just looks
unhealthy."
Iraey Ingebrigstcn. the environ
mental quality engineer lor the I 'ni
vcrsity's Facilities Operations said
the University purchases its water
from the San Francisco Public I 'tili
ties Commission (SFPI'C), which
primarily draws upon Yosemile Na
tional Park's I letch Uetchv reser
voir.
•" I his water is so pristine that it
does not require filtration at a water
treatment plant," Ingebrigsten said.
Once a year. SFPIJC conducts
maintenance operations on the
I letch I letch\ reservoir and. during
I his period, supplies its customers
with drinking water from local
reservoirs. ITiis local water. Inge
brigsten said, must undergo treat
ment at the Sunol Valley Water
Treatment Plant, where the process

traps air in the water, which ac
counts lor the liquid's milky ap
pearance-.
"II you let the water sil for 30 to
60 seconds, the bubbles will dissipate
and the water will clear." said Ingc
brigsten. assuring that the water is
clean.
Ingebngsten explained that the
lag in notification about the change
can be attributed to the complex
communication structure between
SFIHJC and the University, lb en
sure student safety, the University
uses a three-tiered examination
process in which water samples are
submitted weekly to a certified lab
orators Ihere. Sl I'UC takes daily
and weekly samples to check for op
timal quality, and water system op
erators collect and analy/e daily
samples.
SI l'l J(' plans to complete its an
nual maintenance and switch back to
the 1 letch Hetchy reservoir water
tomorrow.
"After [today], we should no
longer see milky water," Ingebrig
sten said.
