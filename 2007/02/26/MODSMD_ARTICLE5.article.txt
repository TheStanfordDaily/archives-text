## Milky water frightens Clear water to return Tuesday after weeks

When Marian Lee '07 woke up
earlier this month and turned on the
water in her bathroom, she was sur
prised to see the faucet spew out
milky white water as opposed to the
usual clear stream.
She is not alone. Complaints
about the water have risen in dorms
across campus from Wilbur toToyon
to Roble, and while housing authori
ties stressed the water's safety, many
students have expressed disgruntle
ment at the way the administration
has handled the problem.
In mid-February, two weeks after
the water began to appear milky. Stu
dent Housing emailed notifications
to resident email lists, but students
said they found the explanations too
vague.
"They should've let the students
know before the water turned
milky," Lee said. "They sent an email
weeks after it happened, basically
saying'don't worry, it's not toxic."'
The notification's ambiguity
spurred more student questions and
doubts.
"It just doesn't look like air to
me," said one Tovon resident."Logi
cally. air is clear too. right? It must be
some kind of buildup."
"I thought about my skin." Lee
