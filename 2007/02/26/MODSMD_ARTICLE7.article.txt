### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Paul Teicholz, professor emeritus of civil and environ
mental engineering, became the first academic to receive the
Henry C. Turner Prize for Innovation in Construction Tech
nology in a ceremony held on campus earlier this month.

"1 had no knowledge of this prize and
was absolutely delighted to have my work
at Stanford recognized," said Teicholz,
who works at the Center for Integrated
Facility Engineering (CIFE). "It was a
great validation of the CIFE research pro
gram and the impact that it has had on in
dustry."
The Center was founded in 1988.
"1 was working in private industry for a
large contractor and had realized that new
approaches were needed for developing.

using and sharing information in the Architectural. Engi
neering and Construction industry "Teicholz said in an email
to The Daily. "I wrote to Stanford describing my ideas and
asking if it would be possible to set up a research program for
this purpose."
Nearly twenty years later, CIFE is still going strong and,
according to Teicholz, staying true to his original intentions.
"The goal is to find new ways to use computers to im
prove the quality of buildings and the methods used for their
design, construction and use," he said.
Teicholz, who many in the field consider the father of
building information modeling (B1M) technology.described
the construction industry as on the edge of extraordinary
change.
Throughout his 40-year career, he has pursued solutions
to key issues in the construction industry, concentrating
much of his attention on integrating architecture and con
struction.
The Turner Prize — which was first presented in 2002 —
has become one of the most prestigious awards in the con
struction industry. The prize, which also carries a $25.(XX)
cash reward,celebrates invention,ground-breaking method
ology or outstanding leadership by a person or team in con
struction technology.
Teicholz expressed hope that he would continue to be on
the edge of innovation in the construction industry.
"1 am working on a book," he said,"about BIM with three
other authors that we hope will be published this year."
