Every Monday we will feature a slightly obscure photograph taken on campus. Your job? Try to discern the subject of the photo. The first person to email
the correct answer to mondaypicture@gmail.com will receive a$ 10 Jamba Juice gift card. Also, if you are interested in taking the mystery picture, send
us an email too.
