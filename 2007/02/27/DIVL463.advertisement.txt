The Archaeology
of Cultural Evolution
This will be a general lecture. It will explain what I mean by cultural evolution, essentially that
it is a process best seen as a version of what Darwin called descent with modification, that can be
approached by using versions of the principles and methods used to understand biological evolution. It
will provide arguments for why this is a productive approach and go on to look at what archaeology can
contribute to it as well as to what the approach itself can offer to archaeology. These last points will be
illustrated with archaeological examples.
