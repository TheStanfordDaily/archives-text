## Coins in the legislative machine Casino contributions to State Senator raise questions 
### BELINDA YU 
In what could be seen as a nod to
the American Indian tribes that
helped fund Democratic state Sen
ate leader Don Perata's (D-Oak
land) re-election campaign, the Cal
ifornia legislature's second-most
powerful official submitted on Sat
urday an amendment to a state gam
ing bill that may pave the way for
one of the largest casino expansions
in recent years.
Last September, Perata blocked
several tribal-state contracts from
ratification by the Senate. The eon
tracts. negotiated in 2004 by Gover
nor Arnold Schwarzenegger, would
have allowed five of California's
wealthiest tribes — the Sycuan,
Pechanga, Agua Caliente, San
Manuel and Morongo — to expand
their casino operations by adding
some 22.000 slots in a 30-year deal
worth an estimated $22 billion.
But that was before Perata re
ceived hundreds of thousands in po
litical contributions from native
tribes and rode the wave to victory in
his November re-election.
On Friday, Perata-submitted Sen
ate Bill 957, which chances only two

words in Section 12712 of (he Gov
ernment Code relating to Indian
gaming. lTie definition of "County
Tribal Casino Account" was
changed to mean "an account con
sisting of all moneys paid by tribes of
that county into the Indian Gaming
Special Distribution Fund after de
ducting— replacing the words "de
duction of'— the amounts appro
priated."
Hie bill, which seem to make only
grammatical changes to the Govern
ment Code.are linked toon Perata's
website, and will undergo an up-or
down vote by the State Senate. Calls
to Perata's office over the weekend
were not returned.
American Indians donated
$30,400 to the "Taxpayers for Pera
ta" election committee and a stag
gering $784,400 to the "Rebuilding
California" committee, a Perata
backed political action committee
that supports the state's multimil
lion-dollar infrastructure bonds.
Three of the five tribes that could
stand to gain the most from the deals
donated hundreds of thousands to
the Perata campaign.
Hie Agua Caliente tribe of Palm
Springs, which owns two casinos in
Rancho Mirage and Palm Springs
and has an ongoing deal for building
a third, donated $l 1,200 to Perata's
re-election campaign and made a
$100,000 contribution to "Rebuild
ing California" last September.
The Pechanga tribe, which owns
one of California's largest casinos on

the Indian reservation in Temecula
and has also inked a deal to expand
their gaming operations, gave
$16,000 to Perata's campaign and
$100,000 to Perata?s committee.
The Morongo tribe of Riverside
County owns a hotel and casino
complex in C'abazon. near Palm
Springs. The Morongo made a i
$5600 donation to Perata's cam- J
paign and contributed $200,000 J|
to Perata's infrastructure com- ml
mittee. II
In California, gambling is a If
$y billion industry and Indian I
casinos command a $7 billion U*
share, according to the Califor- II
nia Office of Problem Gam- H
bling. w
The Legislative Analysts Of- «
fice reported this month that 53 1
tribes currently operate 54 "Neva-
da-style" casinos in California.
State legislation forbids t|uid pro
quo or political contributions to be
made in exchange for legislative fa
vors. But when lines are drawn in the
desert sands, things can get dicey.
According to a Perata aide, the
current Senate president co-au
thored gaming compacts for the
Agua Caliente and Pechanga tribes.
Station Casinos of Las Vegas was
also a major contributor to Perata's
re-election campaign, shelling out
$8,600 to "Taxpayers for Perata."
Station Casinos manages the
United Auburn Indian's Thunder
Valley Casino, near Sacramento, and
is — according to the Legislative

Analysts Office— one of Califor
nia's largest gambling complexes
and "one of the highest revenue
generating casinos in the country."

One of the gaming contracts that
stalled on the floor of the Senate last
year is now being backed by the Sen

ate president himself — a gaming
contract with the Agua Caliente that
would allow the tribe to add up to
2,500 slot machines.
