# Turning off the habit
## Recent study finds that specific brain damage prevents nicotine craving, helps smokers stop 
### RACHEL WHELAN 
Brain damage can. in one very specific in
stance, be good for you.
Cigarette smoking is the most common pre
ventable cause of death in the developed
world. And now. for the first time, scientists
have located the central command center in
the brain for addictive behavior. When this re
gion — called the insula — is damaged, it can
bring nicotine addiction to an end.
Located just behind each ear. the insula is
no larger than a squash ball — but the size of
its task is monumental. It acts as the brain's in
terpreter of the body's entire physiological
state, integrating the many different languages
ol the body's specialized nerve cells into a sin
gle coherent message, which gets sent to the
decision-making prefrontal cortex. There, this
message induces behavior designed to restore
the body to a more stable state — like grab
bing a glass of water when you're thirsty.
Iliough the insula is common to ali mam
mals. humans and apes have a unique type of
cell present in the insula, as well as different
nerve cell signaling pathways traveling to it.
These differences form the basis for social emo
tions. For example, humans and apes do not just
react aversely to unpleasant stimuli, but active
ly convey this reaction by expressing disgust

A recent study conducted hv researchers at
(JSC and the University of lowa found that the
insula is crucial for sustaining addiction: smok
ers who suffered lesions that included the insu
la region were much more likely to quit than
smokers who suffered lesions but whose insu
la regions were intact. When smoking habits,
history, and the causes of brain damage were
controlled for. researchers observed that 12
out of 19 insula-damaged patients were able to
quit for good, whereas only 4 out of 50 in the
comparison group of non-insula-damaged pa
tients were able to do so.
Researchers found that damage to the insu
la alone could terminate the urge to smoke,but
damage to any other singular region of the
brain, including those surrounding the insula,
could not do so.That only four out of fifty peo
ple in the comparison group were able to quit
smoking completely is evidence that brain
damage to the insula is vastly more influential
in addictive behavior than brain damage else
where, though nonspecific brain damage can
still play a role.
Usually.smokers who try to quit experience
the urge to smoke for years afterwards, which
often results in multiple relapses. What makes
a smoking addiction so physically powerful
and persistent is the insula's activation before
a smoker takes a cigarette from a pack and
clamps it between their lips. 'ITie insula gener

ally helps your body form expectations- when
you think about biking to class in the rain, your
insula prepares you for the cold water. Similar
ly. any sights, smells, or rituals associated with
smoking activate the insula and set the stage
for smoking -for example, a smoker will expe
rience an elevated heart rate and a sensation in
his lungs before he even thinks about wanting
a cigarette.
The role of the insula in maintaining addic
tive behaviors has implications for new kinds
of therapies for not only smoking, but also al
coholism. drug addiction, anxiety and eating
disorders. Specifically, to treat a smoking ad
diction. inhalers or denieotinized cigarettes
that recreate the sensory experience of smok

ing could replace actual cigarettes and reduce
smoking urges. New treatments could also tar
get neurotransmitter receptors within the in
sula region. Another intriguing treatment op
tion derives from a recent study in which
healthy participants were able to reduce the
amount ot activity in a region of the brain and
simultaneously alter their perceptions simply
by watching real-time images of neuronal ac
tivity in that region. Perhaps if smokers watch
real-time images of the activity in their insula
region, they can learn to reduce their cravings,
too.
