# Western governors take action together to curb global warming
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fed up with federal
inaction and convinced of the dangers from
global warming, five governors from Western
states agreed Monday to work together to re
duce greenhouse gases.
'ITieir promise to target global warming
was the latest of a rush of new ideas shared
this week as states push ahead on climate
change and clean or alternative energy.
Global warming and energy were some of
the dominant points of discussion over four
days at the annual winter meeting of the Na
tional Governors Association.
But out West, increasingly common
droughts and bad fire seasons added urgency.
The governors of Arizona. California, New
Mexico. Oregon and Washington state

agreed to develop a regional target to lower
greenhouse gases and create a market-based
program aimed at helping businesses reach
the still-undecided goals.
We must encourage all the governors to
sign onto these partnerships," said California
OOP Oov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has
pursued some ot the country's most aggressive
efforts."l just want to make sure that everyone
works together and tights global warming."
Schwarzenegger said a so-called cap-and
trade program, which lets companies that can't
meet their emission reduction targets buy
credits from those that reduce carbon dioxide,
would provide "a powerful framework for de
veloping a national cap-and-trade program....
Ibis agreement shows the power of states to
lead our nation addressing climate change."
Last year. Schwarzenegger signed Cali
fornia legislation imposing a first-in-the-na
tiÂ°n emissions cap on utilities, refineries and
manufacturing plants, with a goal of cutting
greenhouse gases to 1990 levels bv 2020.
