Hagc 2s "The World this Week"
s tor\ last Friday contained two fac
tual inaccuracies. While Hizbullah
has ideological links with the late
Ayatollah Khomeini, architect of
the Iranian revolution, the author
inaccurate in writing that
Hizbullah... was created by the
Iranian regime in the 1980s as an
agent tor the exportation of the Is
lamic revolution." In addition, the
author wrote that Syria lost the
Golan Heights to Israel during their
1973 war: in fact. Israel gained the
Golan Heights from Syria during
their 1967 war.
