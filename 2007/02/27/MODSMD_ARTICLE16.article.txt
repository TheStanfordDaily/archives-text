## Editorial Board Flawed divestment plan raises important issues 
### 
This academic year has witnessed the
formation of a new student organiza
tion. Students Confronting Apartheid
in Israel (SCAI ).The group joins the Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East (CJME)
and the Stanford Israel Alliance (SIA) as a
prominent voice in the campus discussion of
the Israel-Palestine conflict.
That debate has been reinvigorated since
the launch of SCAI's campaign in January to
encourage the University to divest from
companies doing business with the Israeli
military or operating in occupied portions of
the West Bank.The Daily has received more
op-eds and letters to the editor regarding
this topic than any other this year. Heated
conversations about divestment occur in
dorm lounges, in dining halls and on The
Daily's own comments pages. SCAI is to be
commended for helping to foster this dia
logue. At a campus known more for its exis
tence inside a "bubble" than for its political
awareness, we are happy to see students en
gage in passionate debate on an issue of
global importance.
It is unfortunate, however, that it has
taken the use of an inflammatory label like
"apartheid" to spark interest in this topic.
SCAI's Web site clarifies that it uses the
word to describe Israeli actions in the Occu
pied Territories rather than the situation
within the State of Israel proper but, even
with that caveat, the group's use of such a
loaded term marginalizes legitimate Israeli
grievancesâ€”not least of which is a Palestin
ian Authority (PA) government that refuses
to recognize its right to exist. The use of the
word "apartheid" suggests clear delin
eations of moral clarity which simply do not
exist in the muddle of the Israel-Palestine
conflict.
Organizations like SCAI and CJME are
right in pointing out that the ongoing Israeli
occupation of the West Bank raises grave,
unresolved strategic and human rights prob
lems. Israel's settlement in the areas of the
proposed Palestinian state and expropria
tion of Palestinian property, coupled with
the Israeli military's killings of Palestinian
civilians, have rightly earned it global cen
sure. Like world leaders ranging from Kofi
Annan to George W. Bush. The Daily sup
ports eventual Israeli withdrawal and the
implementation of a two-state solution in
the region. However, we cannot ignore a
long history of ignoble actions by Palestini
ans. Human Rights Watch, an independent
human rights monitor, has "deplored" at

tacks on Israeli civilians and called on the
PA to rein in terrorism. As Bush and others
have noted, any progress peaceful solution
must ultimately incorporate Palestinian
recognition of the Israeli state and renunci
ation terror tactics.
Divestment enables religious and educa
tional institutions to express disapproval of
regimes that they feel are morally repre
hensible in a manner that has real conse
quences for the target of their censure.
Stanford divested from South Africa in the
1980s and from Sudan in 2(X)5. It is no coin
cidence, though, that Stanford's only two in
cidences of divestment have sought to cen
sure an apartheid state and a genocidal
regime. Divestment is warranted only when
criminal-victim relationships are clear, be
cause it punishes a single actor in the
drama.
One side should not shoulder all of the
blame for the 60-year-old mess in the former
British mandate. In 2006, Congress voted to
suspend its $150 million in annual aid to the
PA following the victory of radical Hamas
candidates in Palestinian elections. I lamas, a
group classified by the State Department as
a terrorist organization, has carried out at
tacks on Israeli civilians and continues to
deny interest in a two-state solution. Con
gress's financial punishment was imple
mented after the newly-elected radical dele
gates refused to moderate their stances. Per
haps it is now time to ask our government to
consider scaling back its more than $2 bil
lion in annual military grants to Israel if that
nation does not show itself willing to aban
don settlements in the territory of the future
Palestinian state and work toward a mutual
ly amicable peace.
Whatever we do, we should work toward
a solution that acknowledges that both sides
have committed breaches of fundamental
human rights. Only after both parties accept
that they have made serious missteps can
work begin on a compromise in which each
player sacrifices something to achieve
peace. The use of a word like "apartheid"
does not promote this ethos of compromise.
One does not make peace with an apartheid
regime: one cuts it off and destroys it. A so
lution to the Israel-Palestine conflict will
not be achieved by a policy of divestment
which serves to punish the State of Israel
alone. It will take mutual sacrifice to resolve
the issues that SCAI has helped bring to the
foreground of campus debate in recent
months.
