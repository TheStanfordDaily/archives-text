I bought the ugliest mug in the world from
Starbucks. It's a 12-ounce traveling cup
the color of a shimmery pumpkin with
ridges down the sides, as though it were de
signed tor the hand of some skinny, seven
lingered person. I 've had people stop me to
tell me how ugly it is. I bought it because it
was cheap, and for the final weeks of fall
quarter. I carried it around dutifully to
Moonßean's. the ( olio, and the sketchy
med school cafe.quite smug about my use of
the travel mug (versus those eeo-hostile dis
posable paper cups).
C arrying my own cup had its pros and
cons. Pros: I got discounts, the large mug
usually got tilled to the brim no matter what
size I ordered. I had a sparkling ecological
conscience and I didn't have to drink out of
those awkwardly slurpy plastic lids. Cons: it
needed constant washing. I constantly for
go! to wash it and I got ugly-mug comments.
And what s more, when purchasing coffee. I
had to request that my coffee be put in the
mug, which at times involved as much as a
three-sentence exchange between myself
and the cashier, followed by hand-to-hand
contact as I handed her the mug.Too much.
At the start of winter quarter. I began
forgetting about Mr. Ugly Mug and started
leaving him at home. In his absence. I start
ed purchasing my coffee in well-formed
paper cups with attractive little jackets.
( ountless lattes were bought, consumed
and trashed in what I can only think of as a
flippant wave of ecological rebellion. I had
been good for so long by carrying around
Mr. Ugly Mug — why not splash out a bit?
But what was the appeal of the paper cups?
Why was I fooling around with these trashy
cups when I had a devoted travel mug at
home?
Its humiliating to say so. but paper cups
are cute. And one can't ignore that our cof
fee cups say some rather personal things
about us. Are you. for example, a small,

medium or large kind of person? In short,
what is your cup size? And where did you
buy that cup? There is. for example, a great
deal of charm in a cup with a little Moon-
Bean's sleeve slipped around its middle.
What a statement about oneself! "This cof
fee comes from Moonßean's!" heralds the
sleeve, which as we all know means some
thing like.' Not only do I study ravenously at
Green, but I take my coffee breaks with im
possibly chic French lit grad students who
pace around moodily.chain smoking in their
leather jackets and aviators." Or something.
And what does a Starbucks paper cup
say? Well, if your barista has scrawled some
thing on it in wax pencil, then it tells us not
only who purchased the coffee, but what ex
actly is in the cup. Are you the sort of person
whose boyfriend buys coffee for her? And
are you the insipidly virtuous nonfat decaf
latte type? Fhe cup tells us all. and I suspect
that some of us want our cups to tell all,
which is why I was reluctant to dig out Mr.
Ugly Mug. who shouts to the world. "I am
stodgy, ugly and an eco-freak."
112 eeling a bit guilty about leaving Mr.
Ugly alone on top of the refrigerator, I did
some investigation into the precise evils of
the paper cup.The depressing news: By con
suming just one cup of coffee per day (in one
cardboard cup. with a jacket), I was on my
way to generating 22.75 lbs of waste annual
ly. That's like birthing two hefty synthetic-
