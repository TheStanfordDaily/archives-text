# Howe could it come to this?

The Office of Student Activities (OSA).
according to its official Web site, is
"dedicated to helping students make
things happen." I"he italics mark the lie. The
OSA does not make things happen; it does
everything within its power to stop things
from happening. Too many social events
have been cancelled because the OSA has
stopped them. Some people think the OSA is
evil â€” that its chief, Nanci 1 lowe. has a mas
ter plan for destroying all fun on campus. Un
fortunately. most of the time, the OSA is just
utterly fucking useless.
"A successful event," reads the introduc
tion to its Party Planning Guide, "means
more than providing a fun atmosphere. It
means providing a safe one too. As social
hosts, you are responsible for implementing a
party plan designed to promote the health
and safety of your guests and to minimize
risk and potential liability to you and your or
ganization." Shows what 1 know. 1 thought
the reason 1 was throwing a party was to hang
out with old friends, meet new ones, play
drinking games, flirt poorly with cute girls
and tall asleep around 3 or 4 a.m. watching
"Return of the King" for the 50th time. The
OSA. being a faceless monolith, cannot un
derstand such simple pleasures. One social
manager was chastised by Howe because his
house's parties have been getting too big. Yes,
you read that right: I lowe has a problem with
too many people having too much fun.
Lately, the OSA has been cracking down
on parties all across the Stanford social strat
osphere. Fraternities have felt it the most.
Darius Ameri, a social chair at Sigma Alpha
Epsilon (SAE), explained, "In the past, they
were more tolerant of late registrations, but
nowadays they will sooner prohibit an event
from taking place than give social chairs the
leeway of a few days in registering an event."
For years SAE called its weekday parties
"Bar Nights," but this year, Ameri said, "the
OSA decided that we couldn't register them
under that name because it was too alcohol
focused." The OSA is supposed to promote
the personal evolution of the student body,
but mostly they just micromanage to an ab
surd degree: "It's funny when they write you

an email specifically to make sure you clean
the chips,celery and carrot sticks off the floor
after you register a party to watch the Super
Bowl."
The crackdown extends to non-fraternity
parties. Any senior will tell you that the Row
House scene is not what it used to be, and
Howe is bravely beating against the current
of public opinion and making it even more
difficult for non-Greeks to throw a party.The
OSA's Web site functions with all the effi
ciency of a blind and deaf two-legged dog.
The OSA has been notified of its Web site is
sues on several occasions, and has responded
with a collective shrug. (The Web site, for ex
ample. lists Joey Greenwell as a contact for
the Interfraternity Council: Mr. Greenwell
left for S.F. State almost two years ago.)
Nevertheless, its Web site promotes a fas
cinating hyperparanoia (they suggest using
metal detectors at parties). The OSA views
us as ticking time bombs, ready to shrug off
academia and devolve caveman warfare at
the first drop of rum. Most of us have never
gotten into a fight and enjoy drinking social
ly on the rare night that we aren't in our little
corner of the library. The OSA's job would be
so much easier if we all just stayed in that cor
ner. They are forcing us in there. They are
turning us into a Swarthmore.
EBF Happy Hour on Wednesdays has
been a constant shelter from the midweek
study shitstorm. It's looser than any other
party on campus, so naturally, the OSA regu
larly assaults EBF's social manager. Roddy
Lindsay, with pointless correspondence. "I
registered all the Happy Hours of the quarter
on January Ist. nine days before the first
Happy Hour," Lindsay said,"l got a response
saying that 1 lappy Hour cannot occur on the

10th since it was not registered 14 days be
fore. 1 pointed out that the OSA was closed
over winter break and it would not have ap
peared on anyone's desk until the 2nd of Jan
uary anyway. Sheepishly they granted an ex
ception." Lindsay is being too kind. The
OS A s response was: "I will grant a one-time
exception to allow the first scheduled EBF
party provided that you ensure party notifi
cations will be submitted in accordance with
all deadlines and educate the other party
planners in your group about these deadlines
so that your group and the University are
both taken care 0f..." Look at that retreat into
corporatese. The OSA could not simply say,
"My God, you're right, we'll smooth you in."
They could not admit a mistake without turn
ing it into a sermon.
The OSA also said. "There is some con
cern about your event name as alcohol can
not be the focus of these parties and your
event name suggests that it is. Please get back
to me with another name." The notion that
Happy Hour encourages drinking is frankly
ludicrous, since everyone knows there are
much better things to do at EBF than drink.
Lindsay renamed it "EBF Wednesday Night
Gathering of the Vibes," which is a good
name, and far more suggestive than "Happy
Hour" could ever be. The handwringing over
party names is so profound that the OSA ini
tially demanded that we change the name of
our yearly kickoff party,"Blow Out," because
of the vague linkage to drug use. We pointed
out that we had called the party "Blow Out"
for years, and they let it go. Plans for piling
white powder on the dance floor were
scrapped.
The Pub Night fiasco most exemplifies
everything wrong with OSA. For the first few
weeks of fall quarter, Pub Night was on the
chopping block. The senior class presidents
could do nothing but beg for more time. I told
one member of their cabinet that 1 was con
sidering writing a column about Pub Night
and rumors that Howe was going to cancel
the event outright. The cabinet member's re
sponse: "If you do that, then Pub Night will

not happen."
People are terrified of Howe.
Most of my sources begged to re
main anonymous. "I can't afford for
Nanci Howe to hate on us right
now," said one social manager. "I am
afraid to say anything that would
piss off the University and get us in
trouble or make it harder for us to
deal with the University in the fu
ture," said a member of a Greek or
ganization. "If you do wind up using
any of this information, please
please please don't mention the
house," said a Row house student.
ITie stifling culture of fear the OSA
has created is completely at odds
with the Stanford that you and I
know and love.
The "Party Name" issue seems to
me where OSA crosses the line from
micromanaged idiocy to Orwellian
evil. Soon, you will not even be able
to throw a "party," because of the un
healthy implications of that sort of
vocabulary. Instead, there will be a
whole series of Absolute Fun events,
with all the virgin margaritas you can
stand. Are we paying these people
salaries to change the names of par
ties? Does changing the name of an
event make it more focused on com
munity service, personal improve
ment. human rights? Can it be that
the administrators of the greatest
university in the world actually ex
pect their students to judge a book
by its cover?
The OSA's great (and only) coun
terargument to its critics is the secu
rity issue. It protects us from danger;
it protects us from alcohol; it pro
tects us, really, from ourselves. How
much you agree with that logic de
pends, I suppose, on if you are still
scared of the dark. Frankly, I am
tired of University administrators
protecting me from the Evil within
my heart. I miss the days when fra
ternity guys greeted you at the door,
instead of bulked-up security mus
cle. I miss the sense that parties were
Potential Fun Zones, not Potential
Danger Zones. The OSA's goal is to
keep us "safe," but what does that
mean exactly? Good God. what are

these people so frightened of? Isn't it
enough that Campus Safety is on
round-the-cloek detail, protecting us
from cars without parking permits?
They are not keeping us safe; they
are keeping us in line.
Nanci Howe treats students like
children and critics like enemies. 1
dislike her policies and find her man
ners tremendously distasteful.
Under her purview, this school has
cracked down on every non-
EANAB-related social event: fresh
man dorms, fraternity parties, row
houses, concerts. According to a
Daily article from 2(X)3, she even
proposed eliminating Full Moon.
Cynics believe she represents a com
mon problem at our school: a useless
administrator in an unnecessary job
desperately proving her worth by
creating horrific regulations that
look great on an annual report. 1
think that is rather harsh. I think she
believes that what she is doing is
right, which makes her all the more
dangerous. In response to my Senior
Dream Team column, Ms. Howe
phoned my fraternity president and
demanded that I apologize to the
Athletic Director (even though he
still hasn't apologized to me for the
dull preponderance of commercials
at basketball games and the sad.
sorry state of our Yell Leaders). She
said, with an amusing lack of self
consciousness, that I was not repre
senting our fraternity well, because I
apparently implied we enjoy having
fun. She hates that sort of thing.
The OSA actually wrote the fol
lowing in an email to Lindsay: "Be
fore approval can be granted, please
address the following: What is the
physical address for EBF?"
These people are useless.
The OSA is not good for student
activities. It is not good for what little
is left of the campus social scene. It is
not good for the evolution of Stan
ford students into adults. It is not
good for Stanford. It is a pointless
bureaucratic pit of quicksand. It
does not need reform. It needs to dis
appear. Now.

Nana Howe once said, "We judge our
success in student affairs by how much
we can stay out of the press." F-plus,
Ms. Howe. Email more OS A horror
stories to Darren Franich at
