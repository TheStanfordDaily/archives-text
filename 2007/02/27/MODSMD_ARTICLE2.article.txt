# Tree Week continues
## Tree candidate burned by dry ice in "stupid and funny " attempt to gain edge 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
John Whipple '10 appeared in
White Plaza yesterday dressed in
slacks and a tie despite frigid temper
atures and the horizontal rain. Whip
ple was not on his way to just any in
terview. He was stumping to be the
Band's next tree.
The freshman began to give a
speech detailing the history of the fir
tree to a small group of onlookers.
But after a few sentences, three
unidentified students — one in a go
rilla suit and two wearing turbans
and wielding baseball bats — leapt
from a clump of bushes and attacked
Whipple.
The gorilla-costumed student
held the squirming Tree candidate
down while the turban-wearing men
lilted his shirt and pressed a piece of
dry ice against his back, leaving an
ice burn.
Whipple later explained that he
would have preferred a metal brand.

hut said he opted for the dry ice after
learning the metal would have taken
his skin off.
Dak Steiert '07, who witnessed
the branding, compared the stunt to
others he had seen in the past.
"This stunt was more stupid [and]
funny," he said. "I would prefer cre
ativity to that kind of thing, but at
least he's got dedication. I think [the
burn is] going to hurt in about two to
live minutes when it warms up a little
bit."
Meagan Moroney '10 was sched
uled to perform a stunt in Kresge Au
ditorium during yesterday's Sleep
and Dreams lecture, but backed out
at the last minute. She is still a Tree
candidate, however.
Tree Week stunts will conclude to
morrow with two events at noon and
one at 2 p.m. in White Plaza.The new
Tree will be rolled out of bed by the
Band early Thursday morning.
