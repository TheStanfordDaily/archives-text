# Op-Ed
## A 						call for engagement and dialogue on divestment 
### STUDENTS CONFRONTING APARTHEID IN ISRAEL 
We. the people, are Generation Y. While
busying ourselves with nihilistic thoughts
and a cynical worldview. we let the PR guys
get the best of us. Admittedly, the hippies and
flower children of the '60s and '70s may dis
gust us with their overly optimistic outlook
on the future and their idealistic mantra of
"make love, not war." But at least they had a
soul. We sold ours to big corporations, lobby
ing interests and apathy. They fought "the
Man." We serve him hand and foot.
We are a generation swayed by superficial
PR slogans and media sound bites. Instead of
tackling issues head-on, we simply avoid
them by letting special interests create an ar
tificial culture of "controversy." Staying neu
tral becomes the cool thing to do because
taking a stand means you're a radical. In
Gore's documentary "An Inconvenient
Truth,"the former vice president laments the
way that big industries have stymied progress
on the issue of global warming. Despite over
whelming scientific evidence and unanimous
agreement among the world's climate ex
perts. we somehow get the impression from
the media that global warming is controver
sial. Go figure.
It is our responsibility as Stanford stu
dents to stop letting others tell us how to
think and where to stand on the issues. As au
tonomous individuals, it's our own responsi
bility to examine the facts and figure out the
truth for ourselves. In the last few weeks,
there has been considerable controversy on
campus regarding the launch of the cam

paign to encourage the University to divest
from companies profiting from human rights
violations in Israel and Palestine. This con
troversy has caused many on campus to shy
away from engaging with and taking a stand
on this important issue.
At a place like Stanford, dialogue and
open discussion are of utmost importance to
learning. With all the emotion and talk that's
been swirling about campus, many have for
gotten to actually examine the issues at stake,
research the nature of the divestment re
quest, or form their own independent assess
ments of the situation. We cannot let contro
versy blind us from the obligation to examine
the issue at hand.
Throughout history, it's been the icono
clasts and prophets who've always been
ridiculed and stoned for insisting on change
in their societies. Yet are Students Con
fronting Apartheid in Israel's statements so
heretical as to warrant our flyers being torn
down in dorms? Why is it that a recent event
hosted by Hillel on becoming "a better advo
cate for Israel" instructed students to foment
controversy on the topic rather than to en
gage in open discussion? It's because as long
as this issue remains shrouded under a man
ufactured controversy, the 90% of people sit
ting on the fence will continue to be perched
there quite comfortably. Though, if you ob
jectively look at relevant international law
and examine the ongoing human rights viola
tions, you will come to a necessary conclusion
that differs markedly from the cloud of con
troversy that you've become accustomed to
hearing. There is something poignantly pow
erful about the truth and. though it may lack

the razzle-dazzle of a finely-tuned PR cam
paign, it has the gnawing tendency to tug on
our soul and wake our conscience from its
confused slumber.
SCAI has gone to great lengths to take a
purely humanitarian view of the crisis that
does not invoke divisive political arguments.
We also have constantly emphasized that se
lective divestment is in the mutual interest of
both Israelis and Palestinians, as eliminating
apartheid from the Occupied Territories
would engender a lasting peace and sense of
security for both peoples.
At the same time, though. SCAI is con
cerned about the polarized campus environ
ment and sense of hurt that some on campus
have felt. To that end, we would like to ex
tend a formal invitation to the Stanford Is
rael Alliance. Hillel and the greater Stanford
community to an open town hall meeting,
where all these burning issues can be dis
cussed in an open, supportive environment.
We hope that such a meeting could clear up
misunderstandings, create a dialogue built
on trust and friendship and serve as a venue
for the Stanford community to learn about
and hear multiple perspectives on the issue
ol divestment. Until then, we encourage all
of you to go to our Web site,
scai.stanford.edu, and those of the afore
mentioned organizations against divestment
to learn more and to help you reach your
own conclusion about the situation.
