## Reject this non-solution 
### THE STANFORD ISRAEL ALLIANCE 
It can be difficult to identify vi
able solutions to the Israel-Pales
tine conflict.The issues are complex,
and it is nearly impossible to say
what will work. Truly absurd ideas,
on the other hand, are rather easy to
identify. ITie recent campaign by
Students Confronting Apartheid in
Israel (SCAI), which asks Stanford
to divest from companies that do
specifically identified types of busi
ness in Israel, falls into the latter cat
egory. The Israel-Palestine con
flict is a highly-nuanced and chal
lenging situation.The call for divest
ment ignores these nuances and
places the blame for tension in the
Middle East solely on Israel. Not
only is this unfair, but it is unreason
able and it will do nothing but im
pede the peace process.
As with any political situation
that has issues of contention, a true
and honest dialogue is one of the
most effective ways of working
through the issues that divide a
community. Such a dialogue re
quires a willingness, on all sides in
volved, to compromise and concede,
rather than to maintain a polarizing
position simply because it is atten
tion-grabbing. When a student
group such as SCAI attempts to
frame the discussion only in terms
of Israel's flaws, without conceding
that the discussion has more than
one side to it.the conversation be
comes stifled.
The Stanford Israel Alliance is
pro-peace as much as it is pro-Israel.
The two ideas go hand in hand.
Since SCAI's inception, we have
regularly had to combat, and over
come, a desire to turn away from the
discussion in frustration due to
SCAI's repeated unwillingness to
engage in genuine dialogue and
reach out with the hand of fairness
in the name of a search for peace
and a pursuit of honesty. Yet we

have come back, and continued to
discuss, and continued to concede
that the problem is nuanced and
complex, with faults on both sides,
even with the knowledge that SC'AI
likely will not respond in kind. Once
again, with this petition, we have
been proven correct.
SCAI's extreme calls for action
have been matched by its divisive
rhetoric. Their use of provocative,
inflammatory language has gone on
for far too long without a critical re
buke. How can we as informed stu
dents accept their associations with
Israel and the term "apartheid"
without feeling as if our own intelli
gence has been insulted in some
way? Is the comparison between Is
rael, the only democratic state in the
Middle East, and South African
apartheid, a institutionalized racist
regime, not shockingly offensive to
the Stanford community?
Let us examine this comparison.
Apartheid is a government-institut
ed practice that systematically sepa
rates groups of people by race in
order for one race to dominate the
other.This practice was official gov
ernment policy in South Africa from
1948 through 1994. The use of the
word 'apartheid' to describe the cur
rent socio-political situation in Is
rael is not accurate. Israel has no
policy or plan to segregate or mis
treat the Arab population. To de
scribe the existence of some in
equality within Israel as apartheid is
a gross misrepresentation of the
current situation and is degrading to
the millions of Black South Africans
who suffered under a true apartheid
regime.
In the face of this deceitful com
parison. we must reevaluate what
SCAI's recent campaign is truly
about. It is not about apartheid, as
none exists in Israel, and all sides in
volved know this; it is not about di
vestment; it is not about human
rights; and it is not about improving
the situation. It is about demonizing

Israel as a Jewish state. SCAI has
brought speakers completely disre
spected by the academic communi
ty. promoted hate propaganda and
used inflammatory rhetoric that re
moves the possibility for construc
tive dialogue.
We students are so privileged to
attend Stanford University. The op
portunities to encounter diversity of
thought here are nearly unparal
leled anywhere else in the world. We
also have an incredible chance here
to maintain a sense of idealism
about the world â€” the ability to be
lieve that we can do our part in cre
ating a better place for future gener
ations.
Let us strive to maintain that
sense of idealism. Let's begin the
Middle East discussion anew with
out falling into the traps that power
and politics have set before us. We
call upon anyone who wants to help
better the situation in the Middle
East to step forward, and anyone
who wants to polarize to step back.
Let us no longer frame the discus
sion unfairly by placing labels and
calling for unreasonable action. Let
us begin this discussion again with
the intention of extending our
hands toward our fellow Stanford
students, rather than pulling away.
I"he Stanford Israel Alliance reaf
firms its commitment to doing so.
because this is how we choose to
contribute toward a brighter future.
We call upon the student body to
unequivocally reject this ridiculous
petition. Let us ensure that all Stan
ford students, from the past, present
and future, can proudly say. "The
Stanford community has never al
lowed itself to be misled by sensa
tionalist propaganda at the expense
of truth, and we never will."
