## WATER POLO Polo beats Bruins for top spot Stanford women place first at Irvine over UCLA 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Senior goalie Meridith McColl has turned in a
number of sterling performances during her four
years in goal tor the ( ardinal. but Sunday might just
have been the finest day yet of her illustrious Stan
ford career.
Ihe San Diego native propelled the Cardinal to
huge back-to-back victories over rivals Southern
California and UCLA, posting a combined 26 saves
on the day to help Stanford to a first-place finish at
the Irvine Invitational.
McColl recorded a season-high 14 saves in the
Cardinal's 10-N semifinal win over the No. 3 Women
ofTroy.She then tallied 12 more in the evening finale
against UCLA, including six in the second half, as
Stanford dealt the top-ranked and defending nation
al champion Bruins their first loss of the season, 8-4.
In addition to bringing home the tournament
title, the Cardinal's resounding upset of UCLA fig
ures to boost Stanford to the top of the national
rankings for the first time in nearly four years. Not a
single member of this year's squad had arrived on
the Farm the last time the Cardinal held the No. 1
ranking in March 2(K)3.
After defeating No. 16 Michigan and No. 6 San
Jose State on Saturday by final mar
gins of 16-4 and 11-6, respectively, the
Cardinal (11-1,4-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) prepared for its
semifinal showdown with USC. The
two teams entered the match with an
even 1-1 record against each other
this year, as the Cardinal rallied to
pull off a dramatic 10-K overtime vic
tor\ two weeks ago to even the sea
son series.
I his time around, the Stanford
women managed to finish off the
Women of Troy in regulation, break
ing a 5-5 tie at the half to claim the
decisive 10-8 victory. Sophomore
two-meter defender Jessica Steffens
keyed the Cardinal offensive with
four goals in the game, while sopho
more Lolo Silver and senior Alison
Gregorka each notched a pair.
Sophomore kira 1 lillman and senior
Katie Hansen rounded out the scor
ing for Stanford.
Silver was quick to note, however,
that despite the identical final scores,
her team's two recent wins against
USC have come in markedly differ
ent fashion.
"[ln our last game against them]
we were running on emotion, but
today we were a lot more com
posed." Silver said on Sunday. "We
knew that we would be prepared for
anything they ran, so we were a lot
more calm today."
McColl cited the improvement of
her squad's results against the
Women of Troy as an indication of
the direction of the Cardinal's
progress.
"The first time [we played USC]
this season, we lost after outplaying
them and giving up some painful
goals." she said. "The second time we
beat them in overtime, after being
ahead by two goals with two minutes
left. The third game [this weekend],
we beat them in regulation.That tells

a story about our team — one of cor
recting errors, growing and improv
ing with each game."
In the tournament title game
against UCLA, Stanford jumped out
to an early 2-0 first-period lead on
the strength of goals from Silver and
freshman Kelly Eaton. The Bruins
responded with three goals of their
own to briefly take the lead, but the
Cardinal roared back with three
unanswered goals to build a 5-3 lead
heading into the half.
"UCLA has one of the best
goalies in collegiate water polo," Sil
ver said of Bruins goalie Lmily
Feher. who has been named a First
Team All-American the last two sea

sons. "But we didn't go in scared to
shoot or attack her. and 1 think that
they were surprised by that."
But Stanford saved its best for
last,stepping up to play lights-out de
fense for the final half of the game.
UCLA managed a single goal just
over a minute into the third period,
but from that point on McColl and
the Cardinal defense silenced the
Bruins offense for the remaining 14
minutes and 25 seconds of the game.
Silver paced the Stanford attack
with a hat-trick that pushed her
team-leading goal total to 27, and
junior driver Jackie Gauthier added
two more.
But despite the overall effective

ness of the Cardinal s play against
the Bruins, McC oil ironically identi
fied her team's mistakes as the great
est reason for optimism.
"We didn't win because of outra
geous or perfectly executed plays."
she said. "We won because our girls
were willing to go hard for a whole
game. We made plenty of mistakes
during the course of the weekend,
but that's what's so exciting to me
that [our team] still has tons of room
for improvement. And that is what I
take as the most encouraging thing
moving forward from this weekend."
