# Five-star finish at Pac-10
## Five wrestlers to compete at NCAA Championships 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling may not have bro
ken its 74-year conference title drought
this past weekend at the Pacific-10 Con
ference Championships in Bakersfield,
Calif., but Kerry McCoy's team never
theless made significant progress in his
second year as the Cardinal's head
coach. Stanford placed live wrestlers at
the conference tournament, all of whom
will move on to wrestle in the NCAA
Championships in Detroit. Mich, in mid-
March. and also improved its overall
team mark from seventh in 2006 to sixth
this season.
"Throughout the year, we've had five
guys who have been pretty consistent
performers, and those are the five guys

that got seeded in the tournament, and
those are the five guys that are going to
nationals," McCoy said. "Overall we fin
ished higher than we did last year, and
we're going to have more guys going fto
the NCAA ('hampionships] than we did
last year. And we put three guys in the fi
nals, so that's a pretty big step up for us."
Junior Tanner Gardner, the Cardi
nal's lone top-seeded wrestler entering
the l'ac-10 tournament at 125 pounds,
lived up to his billing and won his first
conference title — the first for a Stan
ford wrestler since 2004. Gardner, a re
turning Ail-American, has stated his
goal this year to be nothing less than a
national championship, and as the No. 3
ranked wrestler in the nation, he is cer-

tainly among the favorites to capture
the top spot in the nation.
As McCoy explained, Gardner's
greatest challenge in Detroit is likely
to be staying patient and staying
within himself.
" ITie big thing with Tanner is he
needs to focus on himself and getting
better." McCoy said. "And a lot of
times he'll get stubborn and he'll get
in his mind that he needs to do cer
tain things. But you don't have to go
out there and pin or tech fall every
body you just have to go out there
and score more points than he
scores. And I think he's putting the
experience of the past few weeks in
his head, and now he knows that."
Junior Josh Zupancic at 157
pounds and true-freshman Zack
Giesen at 184 pounds each finished
second to guarantee their spots in
the NCAA tournament as well. Zu
pancic's finish especially was partic
ularh meaningful for the junior, who
was unable to compete in last sea
son's Pac-10 Championships after
failing to make weight.
"I think the pressure of every
thing from last year, the little, small
ups and downs he had this year, he
had to overcome a lot to be able to

go out there and perform." McCoy
said. "He kept fighting hard, and just
did what he needed to do, and now
it's a totally wide open game for him
at the national tournament."
Giesen's second-place finish, on
the other hand, validated the deci
sion he and Stanford coaches made
at the start of the season to not red
shirt the true-freshman, who McCoy
believed had a chance to challenge
for significant honors this year. The
second-year Stanford coach praised
Giesen's hard work and the adjust
ments he made late in the season on
Monday.
"He did a great job." McCoy said.
"Like I told him,' This is why we had
you wrestle this year.' lie's had a
great season — yeah, he's had some
bumps along the line, but he's still
only a freshman. A year ago he was
wrestling in the state tournament in
high school. And he's just going to
get better."
For the other two Cardinal
wrestlers to make the NCAA Cham
pionships, the outcome of the tour
nament was less certain. Sophomore
Luke Feist at 174 pounds and senior
Brian Perry at 165 pounds each had
to wait for the Pac-10 coaches to dole
out the wildcard bids following their
respective fourth- and fifth-place
finishes.
ITie Pac-10 sends 39 wrestlers to
the NCAA Championships each
year, so the top three finishers in

each weight class are guaranteed
spots in the national tournament.
I"he winners of the remaining nine
spots, however, are determined by a
vote of Pac-10 coaches following the
conference tournament.
"It's kind of funny when you get
into the wild card thing." McCoy said.
"There's a lot of criteria that go into it.
They want to see how they performed
at the tournament, how they per
formed all year, what they're going to
do at the national tournament. Some
times people want to send the young
guys so they can get experience. Up
perclassmen, they kind of have that
do-or-die mentality."
As a fifth-year senior, this was
Perry's final chance to make his
mark on the national scene.
"Brian started the year with a
bang," McCoy said. "He's had some
great matches, so we just knew that
every weekend he was getting better.
We always knew he had potential,
and it was just a matter of it coming
out. So it was kind of scary when he
had to wrestle that consolation
match because it was like,'Oh man.
he might not get a chance to go,' but
the coaches voted him in and so they
thought that he was worthy."

experience of the past few weeks in
his head, and now he knows that."
Junior Josh Zupancic at 157
pounds and true-freshman Zack
Giesen at 184 pounds each finished
second to guarantee their spots in
the NCAA tournament as well. Zu
pancic's finish especially was partic
ularh meaningful for the junior, who
was unable to compete in last sea
son's Pac-10 Championships after
failing to make weight.
"I think the pressure of every
thing from last year, the little, small
ups and downs he had this year, he
had to overcome a lot to be able to

go out there and perform." McCoy
said. "He kept fighting hard, and just
did what he needed to do, and now
it's a totally wide open game for him
at the national tournament."
Giesen's second-place finish, on
the other hand, validated the deci
sion he and Stanford coaches made
at the start of the season to not red
shirt the true-freshman, who McCoy
believed had a chance to challenge
for significant honors this year. The
second-year Stanford coach praised
Giesen's hard work and the adjust
ments he made late in the season on
Monday.
"He did a great job." McCoy said.
"Like I told him,' This is why we had
you wrestle this year.' lie's had a
great season — yeah, he's had some
bumps along the line, but he's still
only a freshman. A year ago he was
wrestling in the state tournament in
high school. And he's just going to
get better."
For the other two Cardinal
wrestlers to make the NCAA Cham
pionships, the outcome of the tour
nament was less certain. Sophomore
Luke Feist at 174 pounds and senior
Brian Perry at 165 pounds each had
to wait for the Pac-10 coaches to dole
out the wildcard bids following their
respective fourth- and fifth-place
finishes.
ITie Pac-10 sends 39 wrestlers to
the NCAA Championships each
year, so the top three finishers in

each weight class are guaranteed
spots in the national tournament.
I"he winners of the remaining nine
spots, however, are determined by a
vote of Pac-10 coaches following the
conference tournament.
"It's kind of funny when you get
into the wild card thing." McCoy said.
"There's a lot of criteria that go into it.
They want to see how they performed
at the tournament, how they per
formed all year, what they're going to
do at the national tournament. Some
times people want to send the young
guys so they can get experience. Up
perclassmen, they kind of have that
do-or-die mentality."
As a fifth-year senior, this was
Perry's final chance to make his
mark on the national scene.
"Brian started the year with a
bang," McCoy said. "He's had some
great matches, so we just knew that
every weekend he was getting better.
We always knew he had potential,
and it was just a matter of it coming
out. So it was kind of scary when he
had to wrestle that consolation
match because it was like,'Oh man.
he might not get a chance to go,' but
the coaches voted him in and so they
thought that he was worthy."
The NCAA Championships open
Mar. 15 at the Palace of Auburn Hills
in Auburn Hills, Mich.
