# Musings on a new season
## 
### 
With Manny Ramirez report
ing to Boston Rod Sox
camp yesterday, we can of
ficially begin to speculate what will
go down this season in the wonderful
world that is Major League Baseball.
Tons of teams chose to undergo
serious facelifts this past offseason,
including the Chicago Cubs, who
added manager Lou Piniella and the
power-hitting Alfonso Soriano.
Some players earned major pay days
— I'm lookin' your way, Mr. Barry
"$126 Million" Zito.
The Yankees were able to lure in a
dependable arm in Andy Pettite;the
Tigers added some offensive pop in
Gary Sheffield; and Roger Clemens
once again drove people in Houston.
New York and Boston insane.
1 am proud to say that I nailed all
of my pre-season predictions last
season, having correctly named each
of the eight eventual postseason
teams. Let's see if 1 have the same
luck again this year:
American League West — The most
wide-open division in baseball. The
Angels overspent to obtain Gary
Matthews, Jr., the As re-signed some
key role-players in addition to ac
quiring veteran Mike Piazza to be
their designated hitter. The loss of
Barry Zito will hurt, though. Almost
in desperation, the Rangers signed
Kenny Lofton and Sammy Sosa.plus
Eric Gagne, who hasn't played more
than a handful of innings over the
past two seasons. The Mariners
added an unreliable Jeff Weaver. It'll
once again come down to the A's and
Angels, but in the end, the Halos' po
tent outfield should bring the Rally
Monkey back to October.
American League Central — I 'm not
a huge fan of the White Sox's moves,
and Cleveland hasn't given me any
reason to believe they won't repeat
as a giant disappointment. The Twins
come into 2007 with the same threats


Andrew
Lomeli
The SoCal Bias
as usual, plus the reigning AL MVP.
Ihe Tigers, however, add Gary
Sheffield to a lineup that got them to
the World Series with the help of a
young, ambitious pitching staff. De
troit can look forward to another ex
citing postseason.
American League East — I've said it
once, and I'll say it again: The Dice-
Man will be a bust. The guy is un
proven in the States, and thegyroball
is about as real as James 1 iohmann's
street credibility. New York cut some
fat from its roster, added Pettite and
will have Bobby Abreu for a full year
after acquiring him midway through
last season. This could finally be the
year the Yanks get back into the Oc
tober Classic. but they're gonna have

It) cut A-Rod first.
National League West — Yes. Barry
Zito will absolutely annihilate the
Dodgers' lineup. Oh yeah. I said it.
But remember that Zito can be on
the mound only once in every five
games, meaning the Giants are going
to have to figure out a way to win
against one of the sport's most up
start divisions. Both the Padres and
the Dodgers did every thing right
this season in addressing their key
needs (minus I.As failure to trade
for a power bat — so far at least);
look for these two Southern Califor
nia teams to win the division and the
wildcard.
National League Central —'ITie St.
Louis Cardinals' monopoly over this
abused division has seen its final
days. The Cubs have finally figured
out what it takes to succeed in base
ball: Spend as much money as possi
ble. Plus, thev may have finally real

ized they can't hank on the health of
one-time fireballers Mark Prior and
Kerry Wood.
National League East — Ummmm .
.. what's the point? Mets will own
this division long before Barry
Bonds breaks Hank Aaron's home
run record. Look for a young Mar
lins squad to put up a fight for the
wildcard, though.
So what's next? I really, really want
to say the Yankees will win it all. but
the Bombers have really done a su
perb job of becoming choke-artists
over the past few seasons. I'm look
ing at New York's other squad to
learn from last year's success to put
together what should be a nice post
season run.

It took uuts for Andy Lomeli to ques
tion EIC James Hohmann's street
cred. Let him know if you think he's
crnzy at alomeli@stanford.edu.
