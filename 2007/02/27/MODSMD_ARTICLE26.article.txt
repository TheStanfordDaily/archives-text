# Musings on a new season
## 
### 
With Manny Ramirez report
ing to Boston Rod Sox
camp yesterday, we can of
ficially begin to speculate what will
go down this season in the wonderful
world that is Major League Baseball.
Tons of teams chose to undergo
serious facelifts this past offseason,
including the Chicago Cubs, who
added manager Lou Piniella and the
power-hitting Alfonso Soriano.
Some players earned major pay days
— I'm lookin' your way, Mr. Barry
"$126 Million" Zito.
The Yankees were able to lure in a
dependable arm in Andy Pettite;the
Tigers added some offensive pop in
Gary Sheffield; and Roger Clemens
once again drove people in Houston.
New York and Boston insane.
1 am proud to say that I nailed all
of my pre-season predictions last
season, having correctly named each
of the eight eventual postseason
teams. Let's see if 1 have the same
luck again this year:
American League West — The most
wide-open division in baseball. The
Angels overspent to obtain Gary
Matthews, Jr., the As re-signed some
key role-players in addition to ac
quiring veteran Mike Piazza to be
their designated hitter. The loss of
Barry Zito will hurt, though. Almost
in desperation, the Rangers signed
Kenny Lofton and Sammy Sosa.plus
Eric Gagne, who hasn't played more
than a handful of innings over the
past two seasons. The Mariners
added an unreliable Jeff Weaver. It'll
once again come down to the A's and
Angels, but in the end, the Halos' po
tent outfield should bring the Rally
Monkey back to October.
American League Central — I 'm not
a huge fan of the White Sox's moves,
and Cleveland hasn't given me any
reason to believe they won't repeat
as a giant disappointment. The Twins
come into 2007 with the same threats
