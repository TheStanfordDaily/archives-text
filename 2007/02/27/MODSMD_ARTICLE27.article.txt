### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With a backhand in the net from Ari
zona's Bruno Alcala. sophomore Blake
Muller picked up a three-set win. and the
Stanford men's tennis team earned its third
victory of the season on Saturday.
Muller's win gave the No. 25 Cardinal
(3-6) a 4-1 win in a match that did not seem
close at the time. However, following the
sophomore's victory, the No. 64 Wildcats
(2-b) notched the last two three-setters,
sealing the final score at 4-3 and resulting
in a much tighter contest than the earlier
score indicated.
"At the time.it looked like | Blake] was
n't necessarily going to have to win his
match, because [freshman| Paul [Morris
sey] was up 4-0 (in the third set]." head
coach John Whitlinger said. "But Paul
[eventually! lost his match, so Blake had to
come through, and he did. After losing the
second in a tiebreaker, he could have put
his head down, but he came out really fired
up in the thud set and had a positive atti
tude. I 'm really proud of him."
On Saturday, the Card got off to a dom
inant start when it swept all the doubles
matches for a third consecutive time. At the
No. 3 doubles spot, senior liric McKean
and sophomore Jeff Zeller posted a quick
K-4 win. At the top doubles spot. Muller
and freshman Kevin Kaiser followed suit
with a close 9-7 win after a big forehand re
turn from Muller. Finally.the freshman duo
of Morrisscy and Richard Wire won a deci
sive 8-4 victory after breaking their oppo
nents at 3-3, and again at 5-3.
"I think it's a way to work into the
match," Zeller said. "If jiuys start off with a

win in doubles, then not only are you up 1-
0. but you also have more confidence in
your own game. You just went out there
and got a win. so now you can turn around
and do the same thing in singles."
In the absence of sophomore Matt
Bruch, Stanford's top player, the remain
der of the team had to compete one spot
higher than each player normally would,
and Zeller was added to the lineup to fill
the sixth singles position.

"We always talk about get
ting off to a good start. And I
think if guys can see their
other teammates getting off
to that good start, then it
motivates them to play well.
So that was really my focus."

stepped up to the task and quickly posted

ed on match point.
"We always talk about getting off to a
good start," Zeller said. "And I think if guys
can see their other teammates getting off to
that good start, then it motivates them to
plav well. So that was really my focus."
