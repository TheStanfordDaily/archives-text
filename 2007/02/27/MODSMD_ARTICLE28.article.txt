## Card storms Sunshine State No. 8 Card goes undefeated at FIU/Adidas Invitational 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a must-win tourney in Miami, Fla. for the No. 8
Stanford Softball team, and the Cardinal delivered with a
perfect 5-0 record, capturing the FIU/Adidas Invitational
title. Pitching made the difference for Stanford, as the team
extended its season-high win streak to 11 games.
The Cardinal entered the tournament with a vaunted
offense, hut still. Stanford (14-2) struggled to score runs at
times in Florida. But sophomore Missy Penna and junior
Becky MeCullough answered in appropriate fashion, al
lowing only two runs over five games. Penna was named
the tournament MVP after recording 38 strikeouts and
four wins — three of which were shutouts —in four
games. The tournament was quite a homecoming for
Penna, who is a Miami native. MeCullough. meanwhile,
picked up her fourth win of the year with a complete-game
effort against Syracuse.
I lead Coach John Rittman recognizes Penna's excel
lence in the circle this season.
"Missy is definitely off to a creat start this year."
