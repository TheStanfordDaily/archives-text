## Card storms Sunshine State No. 8 Card goes undefeated at FIU/Adidas Invitational 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a must-win tourney in Miami, Fla. for the No. 8
Stanford Softball team, and the Cardinal delivered with a
perfect 5-0 record, capturing the FIU/Adidas Invitational
title. Pitching made the difference for Stanford, as the team
extended its season-high win streak to 11 games.
The Cardinal entered the tournament with a vaunted
offense, hut still. Stanford (14-2) struggled to score runs at
times in Florida. But sophomore Missy Penna and junior
Becky MeCullough answered in appropriate fashion, al
lowing only two runs over five games. Penna was named
the tournament MVP after recording 38 strikeouts and
four wins — three of which were shutouts —in four
games. The tournament was quite a homecoming for
Penna, who is a Miami native. MeCullough. meanwhile,
picked up her fourth win of the year with a complete-game
effort against Syracuse.
I lead Coach John Rittman recognizes Penna's excel
lence in the circle this season.
"Missy is definitely off to a creat start this year."


MASARU OKA/The Stonford Daily
Sophomore Missy Penna has racked up an impressive 10-1 record to go along with
her 0.82 ERA and 99 strikeouts this season. Penna put forth a fantastic performance
in Miami, earning four wins on three shutouts over four games.
Rittman said. "She's always had the
ability to be a dominating pitcher at
this level. Certainly she's pitched very
well this year, and the coaching staff
feels that she has made a lot of im
provements from last year. If Missy
continues to work hard and continues
to make adjustments, then she's got
the ability to do a lot of things."
The Cardinal is fortunate to have
two strong pitchers in Penna and Mc-
Cullough: Rittman described each as
"very capable" of helping the team
make it to the next level.
On the season, Stanford has
outscored its opponents 101-23 and
has out-hit them 135-51 as well. One
of the major reasons for its offensive
success is the performance of the
freshman class, which is responsible
lor half of the Stanford homerun tally
on the season. Even so, a deep and
timely hitting lineup has been a com
mon theme in the Cardinal's success
throughout the season.
"Honestly, we have a great lineup
from top to bottom," Rittman said.
"We have a very good freshman class
that is playing very well right now. Hut
we have a lot of contributions from a
lot of different players in the lineup,
and that's enabling us to win these
games. We're not relying on just one
or two players — it's a lot of people in
the lineup coming through at differ
ent times."
When the runs weren't coming in.
Stanford turned to Penna. Two of the
Cardinal's five wins last weekend
were 1-0 decisions reminiscent of
close losses to Northwestern and
Texas earlier in the season. In those
close decisions, Penna's complete
game shutouts and a bit of luck al
lowed Stanford to emerge victorious.
"Good teams find ways to win
close games," Rittman said. "Certain
ly when you win a 1 -0 game, you feel a
bit lucky because things can go
against you in a close game. 1 think our
team is finding ways to win those close
games and that's a sign of a good
team."
The Cardinal opened the tourna
ment on Thursday with a narrow, 1-0
win over Florida International, which
entered the tournament with an 0-10
record. Freshman Alissa Haber ex
tended her hit streak to 10 games and
Penna struck out 14, allowing two hits.
Stanford's next match was on Friday

was a 10-0 rout over Texas State(B-7),
as junior Michelle Smith went 3-3 and
drove in five runs. The Cardinal
earned another 1-0 shutout victory,
this time over Purdue to start Satur
day's competition.
It was the fourth game of the tour
nament before an opponent was able
to score against Stanford, as senior
Jackie Rinehart notched five hits to
lead the Cardinal to a l )-2 victory over
Syracuse. Stanford then closed out the
tournament with an 8-0 trouncing of
Marist in the title game.
Now. with its 11-game win streak
and a great deal of momentum, the
Cardinal is set to travel to Fullerton,
Calif, for the Worth Classic. Stanford
will have a rematch against North
western after a 3-1 loss at the Ka
jikawa Classic. But Rittman doesn't
want to look that far ahead yet.
"YVe play so many games that we
can't afford to look ahead at North
western." Rittman said. "We're going
into this weekend first and foremost
thinking about the first day with Cal
Poly and Cal State-Fullerton.whoare
both very good teams. Our main
focus is to keep it one game at a time
and take each opponent separately.
We can't afford to overlook any
body."
Rittman is, however, optimistic
about his team and its play right now.
"Our biggest concern right now is
staying healthy with our roster size
and getting contributions from every
body," Rittman said. "Certainly,
pitching plays a major role in our suc
cess, and so far this season, they've
proved that they are doing the job.
Our number one goal is to improve
each weekend, and if we stay healthy
and continue to work hard, then we
should stay the course."

tended her hit streak to 10 games and
Penna struck out 14, allowing two hits.
Stanford's next match was on Friday

was a 10-0 rout over Texas State(B-7),
as junior Michelle Smith went 3-3 and
drove in five runs. The Cardinal
earned another 1-0 shutout victory,
this time over Purdue to start Satur
day's competition.
It was the fourth game of the tour
nament before an opponent was able
to score against Stanford, as senior
Jackie Rinehart notched five hits to
lead the Cardinal to a l )-2 victory over
Syracuse. Stanford then closed out the
tournament with an 8-0 trouncing of
Marist in the title game.
Now. with its 11-game win streak
and a great deal of momentum, the
Cardinal is set to travel to Fullerton,
Calif, for the Worth Classic. Stanford
will have a rematch against North
western after a 3-1 loss at the Ka
jikawa Classic. But Rittman doesn't
want to look that far ahead yet.
"YVe play so many games that we
can't afford to look ahead at North
western." Rittman said. "We're going
into this weekend first and foremost
thinking about the first day with Cal
Poly and Cal State-Fullerton.whoare
both very good teams. Our main
focus is to keep it one game at a time
and take each opponent separately.
We can't afford to overlook any
body."
Rittman is, however, optimistic
about his team and its play right now.
"Our biggest concern right now is
staying healthy with our roster size
and getting contributions from every
body," Rittman said. "Certainly,
pitching plays a major role in our suc
cess, and so far this season, they've
proved that they are doing the job.
Our number one goal is to improve
each weekend, and if we stay healthy
and continue to work hard, then we
should stay the course."
