# COMMUNITY SERVICE
## Haas Center provides aid Students can choose public service projects to help with financial aid 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hie Haas Center for Public Service is committed to
helping students who would otherwise be limited by fi
nancial aid constraints get involved with community
service projects.
According to Suzanne Abel, associate director for ex
ternal relations at the Haas Center, students can use
public service through the Community Service Work-
Study (CSWS) and fellowship programs to contribute
toward their financial aid.
More than 250 students received money through
CSWS — which is administered jointly by the Haas
Center and the Financial Aid Office — during the 2005-
2006 academic year, according to Mary Morrison, direc
tor of funds management at the Financial Aid Office.
In an email to The Daily, Abel explained that CSWS
receives its primary support from federal work-study
dollars and allows students on financial aid to earn their
work-study dollars by performing public service at com
munity-based nonprofit agencies or nonpartisan gov
ernment offices.
Students can work part-time during the academic
year at local agencies and offices in places such as East
Palo Alto, or full-time during the summer at locations
nationwide, including the American Red Cross the Bor
der Rights Coalition.
The University is obligated to allocate seven percent
of its federal work-study dollars toward public service,
but Stanford "consistently chooses to use a far higher
percentage in this fashion," Abel said.
"[CSWS] has been tremendously valuable both to
the students who can do meaningful community-based
work or government service instead of more traditional
campus-based student jobs and to the agencies that have
hosted them," she said.
Jerry Lee 'OS. who has worked with CSWS for the
past two years,
believes that the program provides a "crucial incentive"
for students on
financial aid to engage in community service.
"Although CSWS provides a monetary reimburse-
ment for community related work.it
is important to recognize that the ul
timate motivation for entering the
CSWS program should not be eco
nomic, but rather a desire to explore
and pursue further the field of public
service." lie said in an email to The
Daily.
Lee serves as the CSWS coordi
nator for Students for Clinical Op
portunities and Premedical Experi
ence, a program dedicated to provid
ing pre-medical students with clini
cal experience and other health-re
lated opportunities.
l"he Haas Center also offers a
summer fellowship program with a
$4,000 base stipend. After 100 or
more fellows are selected annually
using a need-blind process, the Fi
nancial Aid Office determines how
much the students are expected to
earn toward their financial aid pack
age and that amount is added to the
base stipend.

"The result is to remove, or miti
gate dramatically, the financial disin
centive to do service-related work in
the summer," Abel said.
"Typically, about 50 percent of
our fellows need and receive such fi
nancial aid. which currently tops out
at $2,100."
Using a Haas Fellowship, Ria
Collingwood '07 conducted an aca
demic enrichment camp in Ghana
during the summer of 2006.
"The 1 laas Summer Fellowship is
exceptional in that it encourages
students to develop original projects
that address specific communitx
needs and combine personal and ac
ademic interests." Collingwood said
in an email toThe Daily."(The pro
gram] provides financial and techni
cal resources that enhance students'
education through practical applica
tion and enable students to creative
ly address global challenges."
More information on these pro
grams is available at the Haas Cen
ter's Web site. http://haas.stanford.
