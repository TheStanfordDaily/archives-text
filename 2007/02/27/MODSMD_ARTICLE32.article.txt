### SARA LANNIN 
Women's lacrosse faced No. 5 Notre
Dame last weekend in an intense game that
ended in a 12-11 loss for the Cardinal in dou
ble overtime. Despite admirable defense and
a two-goal lead late in the second quarter,
Stanford was unable to stop the Irish from a
last-minute scoring run. I he Irish beat Stan
ford in double overtime last season as well, by
the same 12-11 score just over one year ago.
The beginning of the first half looked grim
for the ('ardinal (1-3) as goals came from two
Notre Dame (2-0) midfielders just 46 seconds
apart. Not to be deterred, the Stanford
women fought back and traded goals back
and forth with the Irish for an exciting first
half. By the time the whistle blew for half
time. the ('ardinal had evened the score at 8-
8. Key players in the first half included junior
Daphne Patterson, who scored three goals
for the Cardinal, and sophomore Bess
Siegfried, who posted three assists.
Back on the field after halltime, Stanford
got off to a great start with an unassisted goal
by junior Megan McClain to temporarily top
the Irish. 9-8. Ihe lead didn't last for long,
however, and soon enough Notre Dame had
tied the game again. Ihe Cardinal stayed

strong and pulled ahead with back-to-back
goals, making the score 11-9 with only 7:38
left in the game.
Any thoughts of an easy victory disap
peared 28 seconds later, when Notre Dames
Caitlin McKinncy managed to lire one past
the Stanford defense. Another goal by the
Irish late in the second half meant the game
had to be pushed into overtime. A heated
three-minute battle between the Cardinal
and the Irish ensued, but no goals on either
side meant a second overtime. With only
seven seconds left. McKinncy again managed
to find the back ol the net,sending Stanford
back home empty handed. McKinncy had a
career-best six goals and one assist against
the ('ardinal.a feat which helped her earn the
Big l ast Conference's Offensive Player of
the Week award.
