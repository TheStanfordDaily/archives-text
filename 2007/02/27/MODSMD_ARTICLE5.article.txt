# GRADUATE LIFE
## NSO not just for freshmen Orientation will include grad students this fall 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
Everybody remembers New Student
Orientation (NSO) from freshman year. It
is hard to forget the Krispy Kremes hang
ing on trees, the Band Run or the awkward
rounds of Two Truths and a Lie in dorm
common rooms. Some students love it.
others hate it — either way. it has tradi
tionally been an experience reserved sole
ly tin freshmen and transfer students. Next
September, however, graduate students
will have a chance to join in on the fun.
"The purpose of New Graduate Stu
dent Orientation (N(iSO) is to welcome
new graduate students to Stanford," said
Graduate Student Council (GSC) co-
Chair Jenny Allen .11) *07. also a senior
staff writer for The I )aily.
Allen has been working with Under
graduate NSO Director Jared Sch-.'rer,
(iraduate Life Office deans and a commit
tee of (iS(' members from various depart
ments to adapt the new program to meet
the needs of incoming graduate students.
"We want new students to connect," she
said, "with a diverse array of people, or
ganizations and resources available on
campus."
I ike undergrad NSO. GNSO will take
place Sept. 17-23. 2007. While specific
plans have not yet been hammered out,
both grads and undergrads may have the
option of attending Sept. IS open houses
held by the Career Development Center,
athletics department, music department.
Vaden Health Center and various
community and cultural centers.
Grad students will also have their
own Grad Comedy Night that
evening.
Starting Sept. 19, however, the
grads will part ways from their
younger counterparts, according to
Allen. While undergrads continue
with their traditional agenda, grad
students will be able to attend Grad
School 101 — a series of hour-long
sessions that will allow groups of
approximately 40 incoming grad
students to meet with current stu
dents who can answer their ques
tions about graduate life at Stan
lord.
"We are in the process of finding
a graduate student to coordinate
these sessions this fall and help de
velop a curriculum that's entertain
ing and informative," Allen said.
She added that the GSC hopes
"to have some graduate student

groups plan small group events to
show off their student organization."
citing hip hop lessons with grad
group Soul'd Out as an example of
such an event.
Grad School 101 sessions and
student club activities will be volun
tary, since students will also need to
attend events specific to their de
partments of study. Special Grad
School 101 events will also be held
for students living off-campus.
Students will attend a welcome
dinner with the vice provost for
graduate education, vice provost for
student affairs, deans of various aca
demic departments, the Graduate
Life Office and the GSC on the
evening of Sept. l l ).
The week's events will also in
clude a special convocation and a re
ception at Hoover House exclusive
ly for graduate students.
According to Allen. NGSO has
been intermittently discussed for
the past two years as part of an over
all "push towards interdepartmental
interaction."
The schedule for this fall's inau
gural NGSO was designed based
on feedback from the GSC. com

munity associates in Rains Mouse
and Escondido Village and infor
mation gathered online. Allen and
Chris Griffith, associate dean of
graduate student life, presented
the tentative NGSO schedule at a
meeting of the Graduate Deans
and Administrators Working
Group on Feb. 20.
"Many students identify them
selves based on their school or de
partment — as GSB MBAs or Law
Students or Engineering Students
— but may not identify themselves
as Stanford students," Allen said.
"Right now the focus of NGSO is on
interaction between graduate stu
dent departments and schools. After
NGSO has a history, the organizers
may decide to also promote gradu
ate/undergraduate interaction."
The GSC is also "aiming to create
a Wiki before school starts this fall to
combine all the decentralized grad
student resources," Allen added. "It
will be like the Unofficial Guide [to
Stanford] with a graduate student
focus."
