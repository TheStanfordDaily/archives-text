When Jennifer Bilfield took over as exec
utive director of Stanford Lively Arts last
June,she vowed to revamp the program to in
clude more student-oriented marketing and
events.
Bilfield — the former president of
Boosey & llawkes music publishers — suc

after running the program for more than 20
years.
Hie new director said it is typical for a pro
gram to step back and reflect on its progress
when an important figure leaves.
"Lively Arts took this opportunity to
reevaluate its place on the campus and as an
arts provider." Bilfield said. "The new mis

with the campus. Lively Arts had been a
stand-alone thing — it was more of a tradi

Bilfield and her team are working on pro
gramming for the 2007-2(K)S season that they

active. Part ol that effort includes hiring a
staff member solely dedicated to student en

never had before.

classes, course connections or collaborative
artist residencies, the campus engagement
program aims to give students the opportuni

the world's most compelling established and
emerging artists." said Michelle Lee, the di
rector of campus engagement in an email to
The Daily.

month has been marked by an unprecedent
ed level of campus immersion activities." she
said, "including the Public ITieater at Stan
ford. Jerry Quickley. American Piano resi
dencies, the Pan Asian Music Festival and the
ongoing World Beat dorm series."
Bilfield explained that the student out
reach would expand Lively Arts' reach and
improve its programming.

"it's building content that's meaningful tothe
campus."
