## Lively Arts' new agenda geared toward students Director stresses community involvement and interaction 
### KELSEY MESHER STAFF WRITER 
When Jennifer Bilfield took over as exec
utive director of Stanford Lively Arts last
June,she vowed to revamp the program to in
clude more student-oriented marketing and
events.
Bilfield — the former president of
Boosey & llawkes music publishers — suc
ceeded Lois Wagner, who retired in 2(K)5
after running the program for more than 20
years.
Hie new director said it is typical for a pro
gram to step back and reflect on its progress
when an important figure leaves.
"Lively Arts took this opportunity to
reevaluate its place on the campus and as an
arts provider." Bilfield said. "The new mis
sion was to engage at a much deeper level
with the campus. Lively Arts had been a
stand-alone thing — it was more of a tradi
tional presenter."
Bilfield and her team are working on pro
gramming for the 2007-2(K)S season that they
hope will be more student-focused and inter
active. Part ol that effort includes hiring a
staff member solely dedicated to student en
gagement a position the program has

never had before.
"Whether through dorm salons, master
classes, course connections or collaborative
artist residencies, the campus engagement
program aims to give students the opportuni
ty to explore and create alongside some of
the world's most compelling established and
emerging artists." said Michelle Lee, the di
rector of campus engagement in an email to
The Daily.
"We are particularly proud that this
month has been marked by an unprecedent
ed level of campus immersion activities." she
said, "including the Public ITieater at Stan
ford. Jerry Quickley. American Piano resi
dencies, the Pan Asian Music Festival and the
ongoing World Beat dorm series."
Bilfield explained that the student out
reach would expand Lively Arts' reach and
improve its programming.
"Instead of putting on a show," she said,
"it's building content that's meaningful tothe
campus."
Along with new supplementary program
ming for live performances. I ively Arts is at
tempting to cater to students with reduced
ticket prices and enticing pre-show events.
All students can purchase performance tick

or more.

begun to see a spike in student at
tendance with the creation of the
Supper Club program — nights in
which students get pizza and admis
sion to a show for $10. The Supper
Club nights are organized and mar
keted by the Lively Arts Street
Team, a small group of undergradu
ates committed to getting the word
out about Lively Arts.
"Up until last year most under
graduates were lucky if they even
knew about [Lively Arts]," said Jil
lian Barber "09, a Street Team mem
ber. Student ticket sales have risen
by 70 percent since the creation of
the Street Team.
While the Supper Club has tenta
tive plans for an event early in spring
quarter, its next confirmed function is
scheduled for April 25 to coincide
with a performance by Irvin Mayfield
and the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra.
Other upcoming Lively Arts
events include performances by the

Company Vinccnt Mantsoe (a his
torical approach to dance), the
Jupiter String Quartet (young and
vibrant chamber music) and Emio
Greco (an edgy dance company).
In addition to her work on Live
ly Arts programming. Bilfield also
serves as a representative of the
program to a concert hall building
committee. Peter Bing '55 and his
wife Helen have pledged to donate
$50 million for a new hall, which will
benefit the Lively Arts program and
other art events on campus.
"The conversations with Peter
Bing are always about what [it will]
be like for the students" Bilfield said.
"Not what will get the most press."
I.ike Bing, Bilfield'smain focus is
to explore student interests. Right
now, she said, her primary goal is to
learn what motivates students, with
hopes of further increasing partici
pation in Lively Arts.
