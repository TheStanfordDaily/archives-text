"The Politics Of Climate Change In I he Ancient World :
The Case Against Nee-Determinism"
I he impact of climate change on past human societies is commonly sensationalized in current •Nci
entific and popular literature. I he underlying intention is to draw public attention to the urgency of
the possible consequences of global w arming in our own present and future \ prime example of
this is the literature on the 'collapse' and abandonment of Akkadian cities in northern Mesopotamia
aftet 22(H) IH Ho\\e\er. in the scramble to link climatic deterioration and instances of social col
| lapse in the past, many archaeologists and paleoclimatologists have taken an overly simplistic
'Climatic Deternunist perspective which in the long run does a disservice to the effort of highlight
ing the importance of climate change in our own time We can learn more about the consequences
of own responses to global wanning by taking more nuanced \ iew s of social responses to climate
change in the past. Informative examples of past societies and how they dealt wit h climate change
comes from contrasting the social, political and economic responses that led to the collapse of Ak
kadian cities, the successful adaptation of By/aniine cities in the arid Negc\ Desert, and the
counter-intuitive case of the rise of the first ( hincsc state society in a time of rapidly deteriorating
climate.
