Feb. 28,1977: Graduate
orientation needed
"Many graduate students have as
serted that their entry into this com
munity was an upsetting and chaotic
experience. Often arriving with no
friends or contacts in the area — and
perhaps fresh from a rather sheltered
undergraduate existence — the stu
dent has no one to turn to for advice
or suggestions. The difficulties of set
tling into an apartment in a new envi
ronment. finding places to eat and
have tun. and learning where to
make contact with other students or
campus organizations, are magnified
by the inadequacy of the University's
welcoming effort. A well-structured
graduate orientation would help new
students quickly find a comfortable
niche which fits their needs. Gradu
ate life need not be just an endless
daily trek between apartment, de
partment and library compartment!"
Iliirty years later, the vision of
these Daily opinions writers is finally
becoming a reality [see "NSO not
just for freshmen," Monday's Daily.
