There were two errors in yes
terday's Page Two story. "Coins
in the Legislative Machine."
Contrary to the story. State Sena
tor Don Perata was not up for re
election last November. The Tax
payers for Perata committee did
not fund a re-election campaign
for Perata last November, but
rather Perata's 2010 run for Cali
fornia's Hoard of Equalization.
As the San Francisco Chroni
cle has reported. Perata has in the
past opposed the opening of Indi
an "Nevada-style" casinos in San
Pablo and Richmond. However,
our statement that "last Septem
ber. Perata blocked several trib
al state contracts from ratifica

tion by the Senate" failed to men
tion a public statement hy the
state senator announcing the
delay and explaining it as a result
of the bill being submitted too
late.
The bill, authorizing five of
California's wealthiest tribes to
expand their casino operations by
adding a total of 22.(MM) slots, was
not taken up by either house of
the legislature last year and is now
supported by Perata.
The Daily regrets the factual
inaccuracies but stands by its re
porting of Perata's campaign con
tributions from gambling inter
ests, which can be found in readily
available public records.
