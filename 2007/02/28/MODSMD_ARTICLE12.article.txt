## FOR CLASSICIST MARTIN, LANGUAGE KEY TO CULTURE 
### VAUGHAN MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Classics Professor and Department
Chair Richard Martin has thick curly
hair, a graying beard and a calm presence
— you get the sense that he has some per
spective on the world around him. per
haps from his deep study of Homer,
Aristophanes and the rest of Greek liter
ature.
In a way. Martin's first introduction to
the Classics came when he learned Latin
to serve Mass as an altar boy. But it was
listening to his grandparents mix Irish
and English in a thick brogue that truly
kindled his interest in the puzzles of lan
guage and technology. Their speech gave
him a glimpse of the mystery of a "slight
ly exotic culture" and presented language
as culture's gatekeeper.
Stories and language permeated Mar
tin's youth in other ways as well. Among
Irish-American families, he said,"there is
a great emphasis on oral tradition and
tradition generally." Additionally, in
Martin's hometown of Boston, people
passed the muggy summer evenings talk
ing on their porches. As he grew up. Mar
tin continued to study Latin, but also
spent much of his free time exploring the

worlds painted in fantasy novels and
folk-tales.
Ibis interest in story and culture lead
Martin to study Classics and Celtic lan
guages in college. From there he worked
as a police reporter for the Boston Globe,
exploring murder, assault and fire scenes,
until he made his way to graduate school.
When I asked Martin about why lan
guage interests him so much, he said,
"language is so completely personal —
everyone with his or her own idiolect."
1 le went on to explain how we remember
the tones, voices and phrases of friends,
enemies and loved ones. I le told me that
he is interested in "the personal use of
language" rather than its abstract study.
"It's hard for humanities professors to
say 1 [study one thing specifically]." he
said, "there is a great holism in the hu
manities — you get a piece of the human
experience and the rest comes with it".
Martin's research focuses primarily on
I lomeric poetry and how it existed as a
performance art in Ancient Greece,as op
posed to the way that we conceptualize it
— as written text. He does fieldwork in
modern Crete, talking to people who still
memorize the traditional oral epics and
recording them singing these poems.
Martin's research led him to find a

number of similarities between ancient
Greek epic poetry and modern rap. He
told me how both genres center on he
roes who display their strength, courage
and skill through their masterful articula
tion of language. The heroes of rap and
epic poetry are "not brutes." but "but
wonderfully articulate," Martin said.
But in Martin's eyes.research does not
stand alone: it is complementary to teach
ing. Each time he presents ancient Greek
culture to those who don't know it.he is
"forced to reintroduce himself to it." 1 le
gave the wonderful example of how his
researching the original semantics of the
word "myth" for his Greek myth class led
him to an extended research project that
culminated in a book.
Teaching is especially important for
the Classics. Martin explained, because
"if you don't teach the new generation.
[Classics as a discipline] will die."
I asked Martin what advice he would
offer the student body. He suggested first
and foremost that we "explore [our] own
passions and not worry if [we'rej going to
get a job." He also offered a "secret of the
ancients" — find "time to do nothing."
