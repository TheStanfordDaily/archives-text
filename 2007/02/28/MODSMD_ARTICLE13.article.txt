## Wall Street suffers biggest drop in decade 
### MADLEN READ ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NIW YORK (AP) —Stocks
plummeted Tuesday, hurtling the
Dow Jones industrials down more
than S(H) points as Wall Street joined
a global market plunge sparked by
growing concerns that the U.S. and
Chinese economies are cooling and
that equities prices have become
overinflated.
A nine percent slide in Chinese
stocks, which came a day after in
vestors sent Shanghai's benchmark
index to a record high close, set the
tone for I J.S. trading. Itie Dow began

the day falling sharply, and the de
cline accelerated throughout the
course of the session before stocks
took a precipitous plunge in late af
ternoon as computer-driven sell pro
grams kicked in.
Investors' dwindling confidence
was knocked down further by data
showing that the economy may be
decelerating more than anticipated.
A Commerce Department report
that orders for durable goods in Jan
uary dropped by the largest amount
in three months exacerbated jitters
about the direction of the U.S. econ
omy, just a day after former Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan

said the United States may be head
ed for a recession.
"It looks more and more like the
economy is a slow growth economy,"
said Michael Strauss, chief economist
at Commonfund. "Moderate eco
nomic growth is good _ an abrupt stop
in economic growth scares people."
The market had been expecting
the government on Wednesday to re
vise its estimate of fourth-quarter
GDP growth down to an annual rate
of about 2.3 percent from an initial
forecast of 3.5 percent, and grew in
creasingly nervous on Tuesday that
the figure could come in even lower.
The housing market, which the

Street had been hoping had bot
tomed out. also looked far from re
covery after a Standard & Poor's
index indicated that single-family
home prices across the nation were
Hat in December. A later report from
the National Association of Realtors
said existing home sales climbed in
January by the largest amount in two
years, but the data didn't erase hous
ing-related concerns, as median home
prices 101 l for a sixth straight month.
rhe Dow fell 546.02. or 4.3 per
cent, to 12,086.06 before recovering
some ground. It was down 407.29. or
3.22 percent, at 12.224.97 in the last
hour of traditm.
