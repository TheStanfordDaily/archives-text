## Nonsmokers at risk Environmental, genetics cause high cancer rates 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
Environmental factors like second
hand smoke, air pollution and toxic
gases may be increasing the incidence
of lung cancer in nonsmokers, scientists
said following the publication of a
study that showed a surprisingly high
rate of the disease in nonsmokers.
In the study, which was published on
Feb. 10 in the Journal of Clinical Oncol
ogy, scientists at the Stanford Compre
hensive Care Center and the Northern
California Cancer Center found that
the incidence of lung cancer in female
"never smokers" is between 14.4 and
20.8 cases per 100,000 people annually.
Cancer specialists say that number
is higher than was previously thought,
but hastened to add that smoking is still
the single most important cause of lung
cancer.
"By far, the greatest incidence of
lung cancer is in smokers," said Beverly
Mitchell, deputy director of the Stan
ford Comprehensive Care Center.
"[Cancer epidemiology] is very impor
tant because only by studying large
populations can you determine what
factors in the environment or what
genes underlie disease. Only then can
you deal with causality."
According to Heather Wakelee. an
assistant professor of medicine at Stan
ford and one of the study's lead re
searchers, smoking causes the vast ma
jority of lung cancer cases — 80 per
cent in women and 90 percent in men.
A variety of factors are considered
possible causes of the remaining cases,
including a gene mutation in a growth
factor called EGFR as well as inhaled
substances like secondhand smoke, air
pollutants and radon gas.
According to Wakelee, the problem
is that researchers cannot use the data
currently available to discern which
causes are most important and how
they interact.

"It's known that lung cancer in non
smokers behaves a little bit differently
than cancer in smokers," she said. "The
problem is that most of our statistics
come from databases that don't include
smoking information."
Mitchell added that the nature ver
sus nurture interaction complicates
things further.
"There is a strong interaction be
tween genetic factors and the environ
ment," she said. "We need to find out
which group of factors predisposes
people to cancer."
Wakelee said that cancer epidemi
ologists have suspected that certain en
vironmental factors like secondhand
smoke are responsible for lung cancer
development for years, but that in
order to study those factors properly,
scientific groundwork is required.
"There has been work in China
looking at secondhand smoke but it's
been easier because [in China] women
don't smoke but men do," she said. "If
we are seeing an increase [in the U.S.],
this study doesn't answer that question.
It provides the framework for answer
ing that question using further studies."
Future studies will most likely be
longitudinal, she said, meaning that
they will follow groups of people over
time and will watch for the onset of
lung cancer.
Studies that examine the nonsmok
ing causes of lung cancer are important
to the clinicians responsible for treating
the disease because there is a worri
some lack of treatment currently avail
able. Wakelee said.
"The hardest thing is that with lung
cancer today, there is nothing we know
how to do to stop it from taking some
one's life," she said. "Societallv, we are
moving forward but lung cancer [re
search] is not very well funded and part
of that has to do with the stigma of
smoking."
" Lung cancer is not only a disease of
smokers," she added." I have a lot of pa
tients who come to me and I have to
say,' Nice to meet you. And by the way.
you're going to die of this disease.'"
