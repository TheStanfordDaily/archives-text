## Editorial Board Stop the tuition squeeze 
### 
We are deeply troubled by skyrock
eting tuition costs, and there seems
to be no end in sight. Tuition for
undergraduates will increase by about
$1.N()0 next year, a 5.46 percent increase.
This accompanies a 4.25 percent hike in
room and board along with four-percent-or
greater increases in tuition at the Med. Busi
ness and Law Schools.
After an almost 6 percent tuition in
crease last year and a 4.5 percent increase
the year before, tuition has doubled since
I WO. Hie annual cost to attend school here
is more than 12 times what it was in 1970.
This is especially ironic when we remember
that I.eland and Jane wanted the University
to be free for all who were admitted.
With the consumer price index up just
over 2 percent in the previous 12 months, we
wonder why there needs to be such an in
crease. John Scully, the vice chair of the
Board of Trustees, estimates that operations
costs account for about four points of the
growth and guessed that 1.5 points of the tu
ition increase were the result of a $5 million
increase in financial aid. No self-respecting
business could increase its price by these
levels year after year without offering a
commensurate increase in the quality of the
good or service being sold. We don't think
Stanford will be more than five percent bet
ter next year.
With record fundraising. a booming en
dowment. a massive capital campaign just
beginning and inflation in check, we wonder
why administrators need to keep turning to
ward hard working students and their par
ents to pay for unchecked growth.
For the super rich. $1.800 is a drop in the
bucket — a tip to a decent caddy at a chari
ty golf tournament. For the poor and the
middle class, recently announced financial
aid expansion should offset rate hikes. But
these year-after-year increases are squeez
ing families who just miss the financial aid
cutoff in the worst way. They are forced to
pay whatever the University asks.

Even for a family with a combined in
come ot SI50.0(H) a year — putting it among
the wealthiest 6% of American households
— shelling out next year's total expenses of
$45,608 per student will be a significant fi
nancial strain. For families with more than
one student at a private college, it is a crip
pling burden. The students who do not qual
ify for financial aid will bear the brunt of this
tuition increase, which represents an addi
tional $2,000 that they may have to take out
in loans.
After completing a comprehensive
study, the University acknowledged last
week that "middle class families are strug
gling to pay the cost of a Stanford educa
tion." Karen Cooper, the director of finan
cial aid. told The Stanford Report that na
tional data show rising tuition is stopping
middle-class families from applying to
schools like ours. "It's been a real challenge
for a lot of these families." Cooper said.
About $76 million will be spent by Stan
ford for financial aid next year: this should
be commended. We're worried, though, that
the struggling heart of the middle class is
being lett behind. Scully's justification for
the tuition hike makes it sound as if some
middle class families are subsidizing more
aid for other middle class families.
A few respectable institutions freeze tu
ition for incoming students. At George
Washington University, tuition stays the
same all four years once a student is admit
ted. This provides assurances to wavering
families who have to budget all their money
and need to think carefully as multiple chil
dren make college plans. Hie University
should lead the elite schools in guaranteeing
students tuition increases at no more than
the rate of inflation once they get here.
We also think the administration should
do a better job explaining to parents and
students why they need to keep charging
more and more every year. The University
should look carefully at its costs and assess
areas where efficiency can be improved.
