# Returning to the nest
## 
### 
College is the first time that many of
us live on our own — meaning when
our parents drop their little treas
ures off at college, eighteen years of sup
pressed liberty suddenly turns into crazy
experimentation and recklessness. "I'm
going do my laundry at 4 a.m., man. and
there's nothing you can do about it!" Dis
covering the pleasures of independent liv
ing often leads to questionable hygiene
and a poor diet, but more importantly, it
makes you realize that living at home was a
sugarcoated version of life. As graduation
approaches most seniors will continue their
independent quest far from home as they
find jobs or go to graduate school. As for
myself, four years of crappy haircuts and
the rash that won't go away have me believ
ing that moving back home might not be
such a bad idea.
1 looked into it a little further and dis
covered I'm not the only one. Once con
sidered a sign of failure, returning to the
nest is becoming increasingly popular with
college grads. So many are moving back that
witty reporters have a named them
boomerangers. Well, 1 have my own name
for them: geniuses. Yes. returning to your old
stomping grounds does have its drawbacks,
but when you add up all the advantages
there is no reason not to jump on the band
wagon.
Ilie most obvious benefit about return
ing home is that it can save you heaps of
money. Despite any high-paying job you
hope your Stanford degree will land you. I
guarantee that the majority of your salary
will go straight into the pockets of a greedy
landlord. Not only will you avoid paying
rent by moving home (unless your parents
are evil), but utilities and basic food expens
es will likely be covered as well.
Speaking of food, home cooked meals
won t just be during the holidays any
more. ou know the kind of food you get
every break .' Imagine that every day. I un
derstand that some of you actually enjoy
cooking, and others of you have parents who
would not be able to distinguish between a
colander and a crock-pot. However, there
are benefits beyond prepared meals. You
will also never have to purchase a Juiceman
Juicer or those Ziploc bags that are too small
to hold anything.
I realize right now many of you are con
cerned about the location of your parent's
house. While your friends whisk away to
urban hot spots like New York City. DC. and
San Francisco, in order to live with your par
ents you could be confined to residential
wastelands known as "suburbia." Jobs will
be hard to find and the typical twenty-some
thing nightlife will likely be nonexistent.
However, there are ways to adapt. You can
probably get your old job back at the local
ice cream parlor and work your way to the
top. Do you like going to concerts and sport

ing events? Two words: elementary schools.
For those readers who happen to be
from trendy urban centers, you have no
excuse. Unless, of course, you come home
to tind your old sanctuary has been trans
formed into the new exercise room or home
office. The dreaded room remodel can be a
setback, but a house is called a home for a
reason.Tiny luxuries of home life other than
your room are not to be ignored, including
the morning newspaper, carpeted floors, a
clean shower and, if you are lucky, the fami
ly pet. Throw in a few siblings and a TiVo
(not necessarily in that order) and suddenly
sleeping next to the new Bowflex doesn't
look so bad.
If you are worried about your social life
taking a hit. have no fear. You can always
befriend some local deadbeats you meet
at the state lair and look up that girl you
haven't talked to since high school. Look on
the bright side: with all the money you saved
on rent you can now take your new"townie"
date to extravagant restaurants, expensive
bars or maybe a weekend get-away. Just, for
God s sake, don't take her back to your par
ent's house.
Finally, the independence issue is a
predicament. After all, you are still your
parents' child and if you are going to live
under their roof you might encounter some
words you haven't seen in a while, such as
"curfew" and "chore." To offset this you
must think of the other responsibilities you
are relinquishing. You arc not technically
the "home owner" or "lease signer." and
therefore you can postpone that liability —
at least for a few more years. Plus when else
in your life will you be able to give your
landlord an lOU in the form a "free-take
out-the-trash" coupon?
If I haven't persuaded you by now then
you are hopeless. Go ahead, throw away
your money. When you're eating Ramen
noodles in a table-less kitchen/bathroom/
bedroom that's costing you $1500 a month,
don't come crying to me. For the others, I
hope you now understand that moving back
in with your parents could be a good thing.
Once we get over the blatant stigma, and go
beyond our conceptual ideas of "fun."
everything else is sunshine and dandelions.
And 2 a.m. curfews.
