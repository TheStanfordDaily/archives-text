# To everyone I've kissed in the past month: You might want to read this

You mighty plague on the college-aged
Casanova, you snake in the grass of
promiscuity, you giant wooden horse
to my Trojan stronghold...How darest thou
rear thine ugly head against me. at this most
crucial hour, the week before my Math 42
midterm?
Oh. you are clever, beast. You are too
clever. As I sadly lap my pudding and drink
my copious fluids at the dining hall, you sit
laughing, mocking my weakness. But there
will be a time when I rise again, to vanquish
you with much rapidity. Until that fateful
hour, I will...refrain from saliva-sharing activ
ities and probably spend a lot of time sleep
ing.
Yes. readers, my licentious cavorting has
finally resulted in infectious mononucleosis,
the great "Kissing Disease." My good looks
and charm, and my veritable aphrodisiac of a
personality, have attracted their last lucky
woman. For the next month and a half, I am
out of commission, to give the more comely
gentlemen among us a better chance with the
females.
Of course, I am boldly exaggerating. More
likely than not, I acquired this horrible plight
from sharing cups or something. But that is
irrelevant here. I am in a great deal of throat
pain,my head hurts, and my muscles ache. On
top of that. I want to sleep all the time.and my
spleen is in danger of rupturing.
My voice, nasally and yet oddly polished,
sounds as if it belongs to an 80-year old art
historian. "And as you can see here, the mus
culature of the statue speaks volumes of the

intricate handiwork of its craftsman".
On the bright side, the Wikipedia article
on mono states that "fatalities from mononu
cleosis are very rare in developed nations."
Words cannot express the load this took off
my shoulders.
The glorious pamphlet that Vaden gave
me. "So. You I lave mono." did little more
to ease my sadness. Featuring a multicul
tural cast of mysteriously smiling (but dis
eased) youngsters with hairdos from roughly
1992, it attempted to put a hip spin on the
problem of rampant over-kissing. While sure
ly not as well-written as other such pam
phlets 1 may or may not have received ("So,
You have Syphilis" and "So. You're Getting
an Ominous Pamphlet"), the booklet con
tained such gems as, "If persistent fever, an
intense sore throat and enlarged lymph
glands have got you down, there's a good
chance you might have infectious mononu
cleosis".
Really though, mono has helped me to
get quite a bit of studying done. By "study
ing." here. 1 of course mean "spending

about four days trying to beat the Japanese
version of Super Mario Brothers 3." but
that's just arguing semantics. Mono has also
helped me to live up to my commitment of
reading four Wikipedia articles a day.
So far. I have learned about Ivan Bogdan
of the Soviet Union, the gold medalist in
the 1960 Olympics in the category of
Greco-Roman wrestling. And how can I for
get to mention my newfound knowledge of
William Deidrick, who received U.S. Patent
number 275,893 for his horse-drawn scraper,
the machine that later became the basis of
most modern earth-moving equipment. I
have learned of Hipermercado Geant. "ar
guably Uruguay's most well known super
market." and Estonia's 1996 bid for the Euro
vision song contest."kaelakec haal,"or"The
voice of a necklace".
In the next few months, as my body and
mind rot away into the abyss. I will surely
heed the voice of the great sage of the "O
Brother. Where Art Thou?" soundtrack, and
"keep on the sunny side of life." If this fails,
however, at least I can be "comfortably
numb." to quote another sage of mine. Pink
Floyd. Either way. the beast will be con
quered. by a drugged up and tired freshman
with an F on his midterm and a strange
knowledge of obscure and useless facts.
