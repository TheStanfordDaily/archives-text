# A 						triumph of the human spirit

### 
In the midst of our collective internship
fueled job stress and Stanford's generally
competitive atmosphere, this weekend I
set out to do the unthinkable and all too
probable: I decided to intentionally blow an
interview.
Not a job interview, of course— I'm un
orthodox. not suicidal. I decided to intention
ally throw the fight for my interview to be
part of the writing team for Gaieties, our es
teemed student-written fall pep rally.
It's not that I didn't want to be involved
with the show. I wrote for Gaieties last year
and loved the experience, as well as sincerely
believing in the importance of this wacky tra
dition. But writing in a team makes me nerv
ous. ITiere's something about sitting around
in a group of a dozen or so extremely funny
people, vying to be the alpha comic: It seems
somehow immature, territorial, an undigni
fied clash between ego and the makeshift
community. In short. I was afraid that I would
not be the funniest.
But I didn 't want to go out in quiet embers
— I wanted to fail so spectacularly, nay, tran
scendently that I would not only not get the
job. but the producers would actually burn
my application and cleanse themselves in a
ritualistic manner. To be unamusing is a sim
ple task (ask any dentist you've ever met —
they're all failed comedy magicians), but un
funniness to this unparalleled magnitude was
going to require some work. I called in rein
forcements.
Enter Vicky, my best friend, former edi
tor. and all-around partner in crime. We
gathered forces in my (unfunny, nonde
script) living room, brewed up a pot of
strong (yet non-ironic) black coffee, and
drew up the (boring, humorless) terms of
engagement. First, we compiled a list of
every person I'd ever met who I wanted to
elbow repeatedly in the gut: the girl in
lIHJM section who tied everything back to
the economic sustainability of China, that
coffee-breathed manager at Wells Fargo
who always makes lame puns on "interest"
and untimely "withdrawal" — we even
looked to history for inspiration, invoking
the spirit of decidedly mirthless monosyl
labic president Calvin Coolidge. I*hen we
conducted extensive research on dead seri

ous issues in current events, like the Israel-
Palestine conflict and monopoly charges
against Microsoft. Fifteen grueling minutes
of Wikipedia later, we were finally ready.
We were going to suck the funny out.
First, we tried the most obvious tack:
avoiding humor by being as serious as
humanly possible. Fortifying myself with the
spirits of Susan B. Anthony. Betty Freidan
and Topanga from Boy Meets World, 1 decid
ed to alienate my interviewers by putting a
virulent woe-is-the-matriarchy slant on any
thing they asked me. Finally my uterus comes
in handy for something. Mentally ordering
my armpit hair to grow faster. I prepared to
answer the first practice question; Vicky
nervously looked on and asked if I could be
any kitchen implement, which would I be?
Immediately I shouted: "The apron. Be
cause the apron has strings, stings like those
the patriarchy has used to bind and subjugate
women ever since they sequestered them to
the kitchen as their lowly retreat. But I would
be a different kind of apron — the kind
whose strings tie up any man who dares lay
foot on my reclaimed kitchen semiosphere of
GENDER EQUALITY! And castration and
stuff."
Vicky flinched. l"he strategy was too risky.
Ihey might think I was being ironic, satirical,
god forbid ... amusing? Back to the drawing
board.
We decided that I was answering too
quickly. It might become apparent that my
responses were all a clever ruse. In order to
slow down my speed and diminish lurking
traces of humor. I cultivated a rankling
death-stutter, sure to have the interviewers
clenching their fists under the table. Besides,
if they felt bad for me. they couldn't think I
was funny. Or at least they couldn't laugh at
me. My tongue skipped across the roof of
my mouth like a barefoot child hopping

across a hot asphalt driveway as Vicky asked
my favorite book.
"Uhhhhm, I-I-I-I'd have t-t-tuh say. um. I
li-like Sophie's Choice, buh-buh-because it's
... like, you know, books like th-th-that are
just so v-v-v-v... we can just nev-never forget
th-that t-t-t-time in our hi-hi-history, be-bc
cause ... you see what I'm saying?"
By this point we had been practicing for
over two hours and I sat in the war room
being cheered on by Vicky, my two room
mates, and my boyfriend (via speakerphone).
But the charade just wasn't coming off. I kept
laughing mid-stutter. I was about to throw in
the towel when Vicky jumped in:
What if,perchance, we just go back to the
basics?"
I racked my brain, but it turned out that
that wasn't a fake interview question. A last
jolt of energy surged through me. One more
question. I told them, and make it a good one.
Who was your favorite president," Vicky
asked, looking defeated in advance. Hvery
one held their breath as 1 crafted my reply.
Id have to say my favorite president was
George Washington. I find him inspiring be
cause he was a great leader and helped found
our great nation."
K very one waited for me to continue, but I
was done. Truly, I had found the unfunny
within. I lelt for the Gaieties interview know
ing that I would not only not get the job. but
would earn the derision of Stanford's
comedic writing community. I was psyched.
ITien I entered the Col lo and greeted my
interviewers. It started innocuously, until one
of them asked me about Russia — my Kryp
tonitc! I caved. I made one communism joke,
then another, and by the time my interview
was oyer, delt one-liners about Britney
Spears anti-psychotic meds were tumbling
out of my mouth like ice cubes out of a
drained glass of scotch. I blew the blowing of
the interview.
I guess, in summary, I am just so truly
funny th.it no force of either man or god can
contain me.

In the midst of our collective internship
fueled job stress and Stanford's generally
competitive atmosphere, this weekend I
set out to do the unthinkable and all too
probable: I decided to intentionally blow an
interview.
Not a job interview, of course— I'm un
orthodox. not suicidal. I decided to intention
ally throw the fight for my interview to be
part of the writing team for Gaieties, our es
teemed student-written fall pep rally.
It's not that I didn't want to be involved
with the show. I wrote for Gaieties last year
and loved the experience, as well as sincerely
believing in the importance of this wacky tra
dition. But writing in a team makes me nerv
ous. ITiere's something about sitting around
in a group of a dozen or so extremely funny
people, vying to be the alpha comic: It seems
somehow immature, territorial, an undigni
fied clash between ego and the makeshift
community. In short. I was afraid that I would
not be the funniest.
But I didn 't want to go out in quiet embers
— I wanted to fail so spectacularly, nay, tran
scendently that I would not only not get the
job. but the producers would actually burn
my application and cleanse themselves in a
ritualistic manner. To be unamusing is a sim
ple task (ask any dentist you've ever met —
they're all failed comedy magicians), but un
funniness to this unparalleled magnitude was
going to require some work. I called in rein
forcements.
Enter Vicky, my best friend, former edi
tor. and all-around partner in crime. We
gathered forces in my (unfunny, nonde
script) living room, brewed up a pot of
strong (yet non-ironic) black coffee, and
drew up the (boring, humorless) terms of
engagement. First, we compiled a list of
every person I'd ever met who I wanted to
elbow repeatedly in the gut: the girl in
lIHJM section who tied everything back to
the economic sustainability of China, that
coffee-breathed manager at Wells Fargo
who always makes lame puns on "interest"
and untimely "withdrawal" — we even
looked to history for inspiration, invoking
the spirit of decidedly mirthless monosyl
labic president Calvin Coolidge. I*hen we
conducted extensive research on dead seri

ous issues in current events, like the Israel-
Palestine conflict and monopoly charges
against Microsoft. Fifteen grueling minutes
of Wikipedia later, we were finally ready.
We were going to suck the funny out.
First, we tried the most obvious tack:
avoiding humor by being as serious as
humanly possible. Fortifying myself with the
spirits of Susan B. Anthony. Betty Freidan
and Topanga from Boy Meets World, 1 decid
ed to alienate my interviewers by putting a
virulent woe-is-the-matriarchy slant on any
thing they asked me. Finally my uterus comes
in handy for something. Mentally ordering
my armpit hair to grow faster. I prepared to
answer the first practice question; Vicky
nervously looked on and asked if I could be
any kitchen implement, which would I be?
Immediately I shouted: "The apron. Be
cause the apron has strings, stings like those
the patriarchy has used to bind and subjugate
women ever since they sequestered them to
the kitchen as their lowly retreat. But I would
be a different kind of apron — the kind
whose strings tie up any man who dares lay
foot on my reclaimed kitchen semiosphere of
GENDER EQUALITY! And castration and
stuff."
Vicky flinched. l"he strategy was too risky.
Ihey might think I was being ironic, satirical,
god forbid ... amusing? Back to the drawing
board.
We decided that I was answering too
quickly. It might become apparent that my
responses were all a clever ruse. In order to
slow down my speed and diminish lurking
traces of humor. I cultivated a rankling
death-stutter, sure to have the interviewers
clenching their fists under the table. Besides,
if they felt bad for me. they couldn't think I
was funny. Or at least they couldn't laugh at
me. My tongue skipped across the roof of
my mouth like a barefoot child hopping

across a hot asphalt driveway as Vicky asked
my favorite book.
"Uhhhhm, I-I-I-I'd have t-t-tuh say. um. I
li-like Sophie's Choice, buh-buh-because it's
... like, you know, books like th-th-that are
just so v-v-v-v... we can just nev-never forget
th-that t-t-t-time in our hi-hi-history, be-bc
cause ... you see what I'm saying?"
By this point we had been practicing for
over two hours and I sat in the war room
being cheered on by Vicky, my two room
mates, and my boyfriend (via speakerphone).
But the charade just wasn't coming off. I kept
laughing mid-stutter. I was about to throw in
the towel when Vicky jumped in:
What if,perchance, we just go back to the
basics?"
I racked my brain, but it turned out that
that wasn't a fake interview question. A last
jolt of energy surged through me. One more
question. I told them, and make it a good one.
Who was your favorite president," Vicky
asked, looking defeated in advance. Hvery
one held their breath as 1 crafted my reply.
Id have to say my favorite president was
George Washington. I find him inspiring be
cause he was a great leader and helped found
our great nation."
K very one waited for me to continue, but I
was done. Truly, I had found the unfunny
within. I lelt for the Gaieties interview know
ing that I would not only not get the job. but
would earn the derision of Stanford's
comedic writing community. I was psyched.
ITien I entered the Col lo and greeted my
interviewers. It started innocuously, until one
of them asked me about Russia — my Kryp
tonitc! I caved. I made one communism joke,
then another, and by the time my interview

Spears anti-psychotic meds were tumbling
out of my mouth like ice cubes out of a
drained glass of scotch. I blew the blowing of
the interview.
