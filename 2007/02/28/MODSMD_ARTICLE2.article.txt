# Grad student dating blues
## 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
line night before Valentine's Day, exactly 40
graduate students filed into an Escondido Village
room with exactly 40seats. But they weren't there
to play musical chairs — they were there to go
speed dating.
Over the next two hours, as the air buzzed with
voices each louder than the next, intrepid singles
sold themselves — 20 times over. While some
talked about their career interests, others stressed
their people skills. One or two might have men
tioned their skills in bed. After all. thev onlv had

five minutes to get themselves across.
Some participants may have been lucky
enough to find someone they wanted to mark
down as a potential interest. But others, like Kyle
Kelley, were not so fortunate.
" lliis is how we get through these events." the
second-year electrical engineering student said as
he reached for a bottle of wine in between rounds.
Kelley is not alone among single graduate stu
dents looking for a date. Many complain about how
hard it is to meet other single students — especial
ly those outside of their departments or programs
— and how lonely the single graduate life can be.
Whv are so many single graduate students un

lucky in love? In interviews conducted by Flu
Daily,students blamed a number of factors — in
eluding insular graduate programs that make it
hard to meet others, a large chunk of already
married students who shrink the dating pool and
unbalanced male-female ratios in several depart
ments that make finding someone to go out with
on a Friday night that much more difficult.

dent Polinu Segalova said, echoing the senti
ments of others throughout the University's
graduate community.
Difficulties begin at the core of most grad
uate students' lives: their department. Be
cause graduate students spend so much time
within their departments or lab groups, many
complain that it can be effectively impossible
to meet people outside their small group of
colleagues.
"1 haven't felt like I've had that many op
portunities to meet people." said first-year
mechanical engineering student Debbie
Booze."There are not that many interdepart
mental events for graduate students."
To make matters worse, the people gradu
ate students do see regularly are often off
limits.
"Just avoid the intra-departmental in
cest." said fifth-year economics student Ryan
Maddux.
Maddux is not alone in his anathema tor
intra-departmental relationships. On the
other side of campus, Booze agreed, saying
there is an "unwritten rule" among her engi
neering colleagues that precludes any physi
cal or romantic interactions amongst each
other.
For the few students determined enough to
make efforts to get outside their departmen
tal bubbles, another problem awaits: a signiti
cant number of graduate students are already
involved.
"All my friends are married or in relation
ships," said Nancy Adleman, a fifth-year stu
dent in neuroscience.
A large number of committed students
exist in almost every graduate program. Ac
cording to the Graduate Life Office there are
500 married couples on-campus, while many
more live off-campus where the University
does not keep statistics.

"Only a small percentage of girls here are
single, an even smaller percentage of them are
cool and an even smaller percentage of them
are good-looking," said Hunter Shain. a first
year student in the 50 student interdiscipli
nary Cancer Biology program.
Shain's comments were quickly seconded by
a female friend who piped up to say the same
is true about Stanford men.
Hut some are happy
While many graduate students say they
feel stuck in their departments and have trou
ble meeting other single students, some say
the experience depends on the program and
its male-female ratio.
While those in the engineering disciplines
often lament gender imbalances, students at
the Law School — where the population
younger and the gender balance more equal
— said dating there is just fine.
"The Law School has a healthy dating
population," said Jeff Laretto JD 'OS. There
are lots of people here who want to date."
He said that despite the school's relatively
small population, students are involved in a
variety of social activities, including some reg
ulars at the local bars.
While the Law School has one of the most
equal gender balances of any program at the
University, students in other departments are
flummoxed by the gross disparities between
men and women in their fields.
Women make up only 22 percent of stu
dents in the engineering disciplines which
comprise more than 3,1 00 of Stanfoi d's 8,000
graduate students. Meanwhile, at the School
of Education, men are the ones in short sup
ply. making up only 30 percent of graduate
students there.
Some students, however, believe the expe
rience is equally dismal foi all graduate stu
dents, regardless of program. Instead, they
say. the real difference lies in the difference
between undergraduate and graduate life.
"There is not a vast difference between dif
ferent schools and departments," Segavola
said. "There is a bigeei difference between

undergraduates and graduates."
Graduate students who also did their under
graduate work at Stanford say the undergrad ro
mance seene at the I Jniversity consists of two dis
tinct phenomena random hook-ups and very
close relationships. In the graduate world, they
say. the random hook-ups disappear, leaving
long-term relationships as the norm.
"Graduate students are looking for longer
term relationships," said fifth-year electrical
engineering student Tom Lee. "They're look
ing for people they might want to marry."
But those still not ready for marriage are
stuck in the middle. The solution, some say, is
to take matters into your own hands.
"As an undergrad, there's almost always a
party. You don't have to he your own social di
rector." said fifth-year economics student
Jonathan Meer. "At the graduate level, you
kind of have to."
Some students said they have made use of
online dating services, such as Match.com.
while others make an effort to spend time off
campus to make up for the lack of an on-cam
pus dating scene.
But while students have tried a diverse
array of alternatives, many agreed on one
point: undergrads are off-limits.
"They don't call this place the Farm for
nothing." Meer said, referring to what he be
lieves is the horse-like appearance of many
undergraduate girls.
()thers were more muted in their advice,say
ing that trying todate undergraduates can often
seem "sketchy" and is usually unsuccessful.
Ultimately, most graduate students said
that the only real advice worth giving is to
make an effort.
"Quantity begets quality," said Lee, who
completed his undergrad degree in IWB and
has spent nine years at the University. "The
more people you go out and meet, the more
likely you are to find someone you are com
patible with. If you lock yourselfin your labor
chain yourself to your computer, you're not
going to meet people."

year student in the 50 student interdiscipli
nary Cancer Biology program.
Shain's comments were quickly seconded by
a female friend who piped up to say the same
is true about Stanford men.
Hut some are happy
While many graduate students say they
feel stuck in their departments and have trou
ble meeting other single students, some say
the experience depends on the program and
its male-female ratio.
While those in the engineering disciplines
often lament gender imbalances, students at
the Law School — where the population
younger and the gender balance more equal
— said dating there is just fine.
"The Law School has a healthy dating
population," said Jeff Laretto JD 'OS. There
are lots of people here who want to date."
He said that despite the school's relatively
small population, students are involved in a
variety of social activities, including some reg
ulars at the local bars.
While the Law School has one of the most
equal gender balances of any program at the
University, students in other departments are
flummoxed by the gross disparities between
men and women in their fields.
Women make up only 22 percent of stu
dents in the engineering disciplines which
comprise more than 3,1 00 of Stanfoi d's 8,000
graduate students. Meanwhile, at the School
of Education, men are the ones in short sup
ply. making up only 30 percent of graduate
students there.
Some students, however, believe the expe
rience is equally dismal foi all graduate stu
dents, regardless of program. Instead, they
say. the real difference lies in the difference
between undergraduate and graduate life.
"There is not a vast difference between dif
ferent schools and departments," Segavola
said. "There is a bigeei difference between

undergraduates and graduates."
Graduate students who also did their under
graduate work at Stanford say the undergrad ro
mance seene at the I Jniversity consists of two dis
tinct phenomena random hook-ups and very
close relationships. In the graduate world, they
say. the random hook-ups disappear, leaving
long-term relationships as the norm.
"Graduate students are looking for longer
term relationships," said fifth-year electrical
engineering student Tom Lee. "They're look
ing for people they might want to marry."
But those still not ready for marriage are
stuck in the middle. The solution, some say, is
to take matters into your own hands.
"As an undergrad, there's almost always a
party. You don't have to he your own social di
rector." said fifth-year economics student
Jonathan Meer. "At the graduate level, you
kind of have to."
Some students said they have made use of
online dating services, such as Match.com.
while others make an effort to spend time off
campus to make up for the lack of an on-cam
pus dating scene.
But while students have tried a diverse
array of alternatives, many agreed on one
point: undergrads are off-limits.
"They don't call this place the Farm for
nothing." Meer said, referring to what he be
lieves is the horse-like appearance of many
undergraduate girls.
()thers were more muted in their advice,say
ing that trying todate undergraduates can often
seem "sketchy" and is usually unsuccessful.
Ultimately, most graduate students said
that the only real advice worth giving is to
make an effort.
"Quantity begets quality," said Lee, who
completed his undergrad degree in IWB and
has spent nine years at the University. "The
more people you go out and meet, the more
likely you are to find someone you are com
patible with. If you lock yourselfin your labor
chain yourself to your computer, you're not
going to meet people."

line night before Valentine's Day, exactly 40
graduate students filed into an Escondido Village
room with exactly 40seats. But they weren't there
to play musical chairs — they were there to go
speed dating.
Over the next two hours, as the air buzzed with
voices each louder than the next, intrepid singles
sold themselves — 20 times over. While some
talked about their career interests, others stressed
their people skills. One or two might have men
tioned their skills in bed. After all. thev onlv had

five minutes to get themselves across.
Some participants may have been lucky
enough to find someone they wanted to mark
down as a potential interest. But others, like Kyle
Kelley, were not so fortunate.
" lliis is how we get through these events." the
second-year electrical engineering student said as
he reached for a bottle of wine in between rounds.
Kelley is not alone among single graduate stu
dents looking for a date. Many complain about how
hard it is to meet other single students — especial
ly those outside of their departments or programs
— and how lonely the single graduate life can be.
Whv are so many single graduate students un

lucky in love? In interviews conducted by Flu
Daily,students blamed a number of factors — in
eluding insular graduate programs that make it
hard to meet others, a large chunk of already
married students who shrink the dating pool and
unbalanced male-female ratios in several depart
ments that make finding someone to go out with
on a Friday night that much more difficult.
Problems across the hoard
"There is not a very active dating scene
here," first-year mechanical engineering stu-


NARUHIKO CHEE
The Stanford Daily
dent Polinu Segalova said, echoing the senti
ments of others throughout the University's
graduate community.
Difficulties begin at the core of most grad
uate students' lives: their department. Be
cause graduate students spend so much time
within their departments or lab groups, many
complain that it can be effectively impossible
to meet people outside their small group of
colleagues.
"1 haven't felt like I've had that many op
portunities to meet people." said first-year
mechanical engineering student Debbie
Booze."There are not that many interdepart
mental events for graduate students."
To make matters worse, the people gradu
ate students do see regularly are often off
limits.
"Just avoid the intra-departmental in
cest." said fifth-year economics student Ryan
Maddux.
Maddux is not alone in his anathema tor
intra-departmental relationships. On the
other side of campus, Booze agreed, saying
there is an "unwritten rule" among her engi
neering colleagues that precludes any physi
cal or romantic interactions amongst each
other.
For the few students determined enough to
make efforts to get outside their departmen
tal bubbles, another problem awaits: a signiti
cant number of graduate students are already
involved.
"All my friends are married or in relation
ships," said Nancy Adleman, a fifth-year stu
dent in neuroscience.
A large number of committed students
exist in almost every graduate program. Ac
cording to the Graduate Life Office there are
500 married couples on-campus, while many
more live off-campus where the University
does not keep statistics.

"Only a small percentage of girls here are
single, an even smaller percentage of them are
cool and an even smaller percentage of them
are good-looking," said Hunter Shain. a first
year student in the 50 student interdiscipli
nary Cancer Biology program.
Shain's comments were quickly seconded by
a female friend who piped up to say the same
