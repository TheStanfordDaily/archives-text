# Grad student dating blues
## 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
line night before Valentine's Day, exactly 40
graduate students filed into an Escondido Village
room with exactly 40seats. But they weren't there
to play musical chairs — they were there to go
speed dating.
Over the next two hours, as the air buzzed with
voices each louder than the next, intrepid singles

Some participants may have been lucky
enough to find someone they wanted to mark
down as a potential interest. But others, like Kyle
Kelley, were not so fortunate.
" lliis is how we get through these events." the
second-year electrical engineering student said as
he reached for a bottle of wine in between rounds.
Kelley is not alone among single graduate stu
dents looking for a date. Many complain about how
hard it is to meet other single students — especial
ly those outside of their departments or programs
— and how lonely the single graduate life can be.
Whv are so many single graduate students un

lucky in love? In interviews conducted by Flu
Daily,students blamed a number of factors — in
eluding insular graduate programs that make it
hard to meet others, a large chunk of already
married students who shrink the dating pool and
unbalanced male-female ratios in several depart
ments that make finding someone to go out with
on a Friday night that much more difficult.
Problems across the hoard
