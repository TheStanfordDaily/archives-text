placed fifth in the parallel bars as well
as fifth in the high bar. with both
scores (9.2500 and 9.3500, respective
ly) shattering his previous collegiate
personal bests.
It was more than healthy scores
that contributed to the team's success
this weekend — it was also the Cardi
nal's return to a healthy lineup.
"In the past we've been compet
ing with four-man lineups on several
events," senior captain Dylan Carney
said. "This was the first time that we
were healthy enough to field full
squads in almost every event."
Stanford looked solid across the
board, with four gymnasts earning
top five finishes. Carney, the defend
ing national champion in the high
bar. nabbed a first-place finish with a
near-flawless 9.90. Also of note, sen
ior Alex Schorsch returned from a
shoulder injury to finish second in the
still rings with a score of 9.75.
Schorsch, Sender, Hadden and
senior Peter Derman all placed in the
top 12 of the still rings competition,
despite the Cardinal's not having a
full squad for the event. Carney
called it "no surprise" that, despite

freshman season and sitting out most
of this season, Ter-Zakhariants re
turned to the lineup after only a few
weeks of training and had a nice per
formance to help the overall team
score.
Junior Eli Alcaraz was especially
impressed by Ter-Zakhariants and
fellow sophomore Hadden.
"I think special recognition
should go to the sophomores for their
efforts this weekend," Alcaraz said.
Those efforts were nearly stilted
by a rough warm-up session for the
squad. Madden hyperextended his
knee on a ring dismount and junior
Chris Harper twisted his knee on a
vault landing — Harper sprained it
enough to be taken out of the vault

and parallel bar routines. But the
shaky start had little effect on the
team's start.
"Everyone pulled through and
when it was time to compete," Car
ney said. "Nobody looked phased."
A high note for the Cardinal came
on the pommel horse exercise. A re
cent struggle for the team, the event
featured a few encouraging perform
ances. Sender placed fourth with an
8.8500. while Hadden and Harper
had identical 8.6500 scores,good for a
tie for eighth place individually.
"The guys fought through this
event," junior Jason Shen said. "We
still had to count one fall, but it is an
improvement over the past few
meets. Many guys can [still] score

much higher [on the pommel]."
Overall, Carney believes that de
spite a strong performance this past
weekend. Stanford is capable of even
greater achievements.
"We competed well, but we were
still far from maxing out our possi
ble team score," Carney said. "Get
ting this close to Oklahoma [the de
fending national champions] after a
performance that we know we can
improve on gives us a lot of confi
dence."
With the team back to looking
healthy again, the squad looks to pol
ish its routines as it heads toward the
NCAA Championship.The Cardinal
has no doubts that it will face Okla
homa in the postseason, as the peren

nial men's gymnastics powerhouse is
out to repeat its NCAA Champi
onship from last season.
"Everyone is really motivated to
get hack into the gym and work on
[scoring] a few more tenths here and
there so that we will ho ready to beat
them at the end of the season when il
matters most," Carney said.
