### ROXANNE DICKINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After enduring a three-day battle against many of the na
tion's top schools in the Puerto Rico Classic, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's golf team finished just one stroke behind No. 5
Georgia (850), landing in a tie for second place. No. 11 Clem
son University tied Stanford on the team leader hoard when
the Cardinal and the Tigers each ended their last round with
a three-round total of 851 (281-279-291,13 under par).
"It was tough to lose by just one shot to Georgia." head
coach Conrad Ray said. "We were so close to first place.The
tournament in Puerto Rico was a great experience. It really
shows the guys and everyone that watches us that we can
compete with the best teams in the country and do well."
Freshman Joseph Bramlett won his first collegiate tourna
ment yesterday, tying with Georgia Tech's Robert Castro for
first place in the individual competition. Bramlett opened the
tournament with scores of 69 and 67, and posted a final round
score of 73 to finish seven under par for the tournament
(209). Of the seven tournaments that the Cardinal has partic
ipated in. Bramlett has placed in the top 25 in all seven.
"Bramlett had a solid golf game," Ray said. "Conditions
were pretty tough and he made up two shots on the leader
during the last three holes he played. 1 le is a strong golfer and
this being his first tournament win is pretty special because of
the overall strength of the other teams participating in this
tournament. 1 hope that this win will soon be one of many for
him."
Joining Bramlett in the top 25 of the tournament was sen
ior Matt Savage. He earned a tie for 12th place in the tourna
ment with an overall score of 214 (two under par. 68-70-76).
