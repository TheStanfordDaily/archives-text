# Fight, fight, fight!

### 
I like so many of my fellow
"Sports Center" addicts na
tionwide. had something quite
unexpected happen to me over the
weekend: I suddenly found hockey
interesting. Now, that could be the
football and baseball deprivation
talking — February will do that to us
all sometimes — but 1 honestly
think it was genuine.
And I'm not referring to the
blockbuster Keith Pkachuk deal,
even though at one time 1 consid
ered myself an avid fan of the St.
Louis Blues. I still am a fan. but 1
can't convince even myself that I'm
an avid one. Hie distance of half a
continent and the sting of an idiotic
lockout made me lose interest. And
as it that weren't enough, my
beloved Blues began to stink.
In short, I and the rest of the U.S.,
outside of maybe Boston and Min
nesota. haven't been paying much
attention to the NIII, as of late —
which is why this weekend's devel
opments were so shocking. It wasn't
just me — the whole country was
suddenly talking about the game
we'd forgotten.
And all it took was an all-out
brawl.
The Buffalo Sabres and Ottawa
Senators, you see, were unaware that
so many of us didn't care about their
sport anymore. So when one guy in
skates allegedly took a cheap shot at
another guy wearing skates — the
details aren't really important, be
lieve me — the war on ice was on.
Everyone got involved, even, hu
morously enough, the goalies, who


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
were so encumbered by their pads
that they never really stood a chance
of inflicting any serious harm on
anyone or anything.
So it was an outrage, right?
Where were all the talking heads
screaming about the degradation of
morals in modern society? Those
who insist we're teaching the ways
of violence to impressionable
youths? 'ITie guys on sports talk
radio who have nothing better to
yell about?
Apparently they didn't get the
memo. No one seemed to find any
thing wrong with maybe the best
sports fight since boxing went out of
style. The media showed us the clips,
told us the motivations and let the
scenes of violence speak for them
selves. Which leaves me in a position
I'd rather not be in: I have to be the
voice of reason. I have to be the one to
ask the question on all of our minds.
Just how did hockey go so right?
We need fights like this. Not just
in hockey, but in every major sport.
And frankly I'm amazed that it's the
least successful of the four major
sports in the U.S. that had to get that
point across.
Let's start with just the entertain
ment value. What better way to spice
up a game than with the threat of a
light or maybe even the occasional
Buffalo-Ottawa-style brawl.The old
joke."l went to a fight and a hockey
game broke out" isn't completely in
accurate. The excitement of hockey
fights like the one we all saw this
past weekend might draw more fans
to the sport itself, intrigued by the
NHL's attitude towards fisticuffs.
Better still, it has been well-docu
mented that fights are more likely to
break out in lopsided, otherwise
boring games. If those games are
now less boring, clearly fighting im
proves the NHL product.
Ironically, despite all the rule
changes following the NHL's lock
out. perhaps the sport's one con

stunt will he what saves it — the
good, old-fashioned threat of occa
sional violence.
But on a moral level, how can the
NHL endorse this barbarism on ice?
It all comes down to the fantastical
ly simplistic notion of allowing play
ers to police themselves.
Imagine that. Instead of old. cor
porate businessmen doling out fines
to athletes who they feel have
crossed some line, players them
selves decide what infractions of the
unwritten code of hockey merit
dropping the gloves, Ilie beauty of
that? It's hard for there to be grey
areas or hung juries when it comes
to unwritten codes. And justice is
swift.
Hockey alone embraces this
ideal of player self-governance fully.
To a lesser extent, baseball tolerates
the idea of players policing them
selves; but given that a well-placed
fastball from one hot-headed hurler
could very well kill a batter, MLB
has wisely asserted its own authority
in many matters that would have
otherwise gone to the court of play
er opinions. More often than not.
suspensions are issued to both sides
in bean-ball wars, and modern ros
ter limitations mean that this gener
ally puts an end to any long-lasting
feuds.
Still, the beauty of the self-po
liced sport cannot be ignored. It is
much rarer for a player to be injured
in a fight than by cheap shot, which
fights in hockey are largely there to
prevent. Moreover, when is the last
time you can remember a hockey
brawl spilling into the crowd? More
or less legalized fighting in a sport
can act as a kind of pressure valve,
allowing tensions to dissipate before
things get really ugly.
These are all reasons why fight
ing needs to be a part of sports. Be
cause ultimately, it's better than the
alternative.
And honestly, who wouldn't
want to see Shaq finally get his shot
at Kobe?

dropping the gloves, Ilie beauty of
that? It's hard for there to be grey
areas or hung juries when it comes
to unwritten codes. And justice is
swift.
Hockey alone embraces this
ideal of player self-governance fully.
To a lesser extent, baseball tolerates
the idea of players policing them
selves; but given that a well-placed
fastball from one hot-headed hurler
could very well kill a batter, MLB
has wisely asserted its own authority
in many matters that would have
otherwise gone to the court of play
er opinions. More often than not.
suspensions are issued to both sides
in bean-ball wars, and modern ros
ter limitations mean that this gener
ally puts an end to any long-lasting
feuds.
Still, the beauty of the self-po
liced sport cannot be ignored. It is
much rarer for a player to be injured
in a fight than by cheap shot, which
fights in hockey are largely there to
prevent. Moreover, when is the last
time you can remember a hockey
brawl spilling into the crowd? More
or less legalized fighting in a sport
can act as a kind of pressure valve,
allowing tensions to dissipate before
things get really ugly.
These are all reasons why fight
ing needs to be a part of sports. Be
cause ultimately, it's better than the
alternative.
And honestly, who wouldn't
want to see Shaq finally get his shot
at Kobe?
