MEET NOTES Troubles on beam put the Cardinal
behind the Huskers last weekend and the team
could not make up the ground it lost. Stanford
will have a week off before hosting the Sooner?
in a final home meet before a break for final
exams. Last week, Oklahoma notched a pair of
victories over lowa and No. 10 lowa State. Kiara
Redmond won the All Around title for the second
time this season with a 39.250, a quarter-point
ahead of teammate Brittney Koncak-Schumann
Ashley Jackson won Big 12 Specialist of the
Week honors for her performance in the pair of
meets.
Sophomores Kelly l ee and Nicole Oura
da had their own large errors — Ourada had
a near fall on her front aerial — adding a 9.55
and 9.275, respectively, to the Cardinal's
record. Junior Aimee Precourt was able to
score a 9.7. hut it wasn't enough keep Stan
ford from landing in third after the rotation
with a 48.275.
After the balance beam, the team needed
to regroup. The Cardinal responded, putting
together a much better performance overall.
"We really rose up to the occasion after a
rough start as a team, instead of falling apart,"
Elmore said. "Our mental toughness really
shined through. It really showed a lot about
our character and determination. The team
did a great job coming back."
Fee returned to get the team going on the
floor exercise with a career-best 9.875 to tie
for second behind Nebraska's Emily Parsons
(9.95). Elmore, making a comeback from var
ious injuries, competed on floor for the first
time since her freshman year, scoring a 9.825
on a difficult set. including a double pike,
whip I 1/2 front 1/1 frontand2 1/2 twist punch
front.
"It was so much fun to be out there again."
Elmore said. "Floor is probably one of my fa
vorite events to compete."
The Cardinal was a little worried about the
vault since one of its key competitors, sopho
more I leather Purnell.was out of the compe
tition with a knee injury. But sophomore
Nicole Ourada kept the Stanford's momen
tum going with a 9.9, right behind Parsons's
9.925. Ihe finish was a career best for Ourada.
who stuck her landing after a Yurchenko full.
Janiga and freshman Stephanie Carter fol

lowed with strong performances of 9.85 and
9.8, respectively.
In the next rotation, Janiga swung her way
to the first place position with a 9.925 on the
parallel bars.The event was particularly excit
ing foi junior Tabitha Yim, who returned from
injury. A wrist injury had put Yim on the side
lines for four weeks, but she was able to come
back and take second on the bars with a 9.9.
"I had been working on my conditioning
the past few weeks and it was really great to
get back out there with the team." said Yim.
Smyth was excited for Yim's return. Hie
Ail-American proved a force for Stanford
earlier in the season, and was named Pacific
-10 Conference Gymnast of the Week.
"It was very exciting to have her back."
Smyth said. "I lei performance sparked an in
credibly strong team bar rotation."
Janiga finished the competition with an
impressive 39.15. placing her second behind
Parsons, who won the Ail-Around with a
39.25. Pintchouk placed fourth with a 39.0.
Though the Cardinal battled through the
three events following its trouble on the bal
ance beam, Smyth emphasized the impor
tance of consistency as the team continues its
season and faces other highly ranked oppo
nents.
"If we want to have a chance to compete
