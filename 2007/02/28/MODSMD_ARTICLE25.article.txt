# David Stringer Baseball
## Man with the rubber arm Versatile junior closer holds perfect record in save opportunities this season 
### BY ANDREW LOMELI 
David Stringer doesn't take
much for granted. ITie junior
right-hander grew up in Palo
Alto and played prep ball just a
stone's throw away from
Sunken Diamond at Palo Alto High
School. So naturally. Stringer grew up on
Stanford baseball.
"As a kid. I came to all the games and
begged for balls from players up in the
bullpen." Stringer said. "It has always been a
dream to put on the Stanford uniform, so
now every day is amazing."
Stringer's performance has finally caught
up to his hopes this year. After not getting to
play Ins freshman season and posting a de
cent performance last year, he has excelled in
his new role as the Cardinal's closer. So far
this season, he has converted four saves in
four attempts while collecting a 2.25 112 RA in
12 total innings of hurling.
"His arm is like rubber," head coach
Mark Marquess said. "Not many pitchers
can come in and throw on so many consecu
tive days, but Stringer has proven he can
throw three days in a row. Hopefully he
won't have to do that every weekend,but Ins
abilities definitely pi ovide us with a huge ad
vantage that will come in handy as the sea
son continues."
Stringer said he lucked into the closer po
sition after being tabbed to pitch three in
nings of shut-out ball against Iresno State
lor his first save on Feb. 11. Marquess attrib
uted more than luck to much of Stringer's

success immediately thereafter.
"Stringer is not your typical power clos
er," Marquess said. "Unlike other guys who
rely on a good fastball, he's got good control
and three or four pitches. It's not easy adjust
ing to a new role, but so far,success has given
him confidence."
After his freshman year. Stringer worked
on developing his changeup — a toss that
came in handy during his sophomore cam
paign, when he picked up a few starts with a
4.34 ERA. The following offseason, he
worked with teammates on his slider and
creating a better stream-line down the plate.
Stringer did admit to being over-anxious
early in his Stanford career.
"As soon as 1 heard my name called for
my first appearance last year, I started shak
ing," Stringer said. "But I settled down, and
since then I've been overcoming my nerves.
There was a streak last season when I could
n't seem to throw a strike or get anybody
out. but the constant support of my teams
and coaches is what kept me going."
While much of his success can be attrib
uted to hard work.Stringer is not without his
superstitions. I le said he wore three differ
ent pairs of socks in addition to sporting his
pants in a different manner for each game of
the Fullerton series.
After Stanford opened the season by
getting swept in fullerton and dropping
two to Texas. Stringer knew his team was in
a hole it needed to get out of quickly.
Rather than buckle under the frustration,
however, the Cardinal came together
knowing what was required of them in the
final game at Texas.
" Taking that final game from Texas this

season was probably my favorite moment at
Stanford," Stringer said. "It was a hard
fought match, and our guys came in at cru
cial spots. I gave up the lead at one point, hut
our offense exploded in the ninth. When
[sophomore Brent] Milleville made a huge
defensive play in the ninth to prevent the
Texas rally,our bullpen just went crazy."
After such a tough start to the season.
Stringer said he and the staff have been
working on keeping the ball down — some
thing that's made a major contribution to
the Cardinal's current five-game win streak.
"More than anything. I just want my
teammates to be confident when 1 go up to
the mound," Stringer said. "It all comes
down to me being able to preserve our lead."
Stringer has already had many enjoy
able experiences while on the Farm, and if
he keeps up his current stride as the Cardi
nal's lights-out closer,he will be able to add
at least one more exciting season to his re
sume — a season he'll be sure to make the
most out of.
"Last year I did take everything a bit for
granted," Stringer said. "I got so busy and
worried with my troubles that I fell out of
love with Stanford. But my teammates saw
what 1 was going through and helped me
learn from my struggles.
"Now, 1 look down at my chest and see
the 'Stanford' written across my jersey and
realize how awesome it is to go to one of the
best universities in the world," he added.
"And that's something I don't take for
granted."
