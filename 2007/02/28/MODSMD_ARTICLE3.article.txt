## Spar over divestment at ASSU No resolution passes at SCAI-inspired meeting 
### MEGAN MAASS STAFF WRITER 
ITie ASSU Undergraduate Senate
heard from the Jewish Student Asso
ciation (JSA) and Students Con
fronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAI)
last night for and against a hill au
thored by Senator Nabill ldrisi '() l )
calling for the University to selective
ly divest from "companies that violate
international law and abuse human
rights in Israel and Palestine."
Senators did not vote on divestment
last night;instead thcv agreed to discuss
the matter further at a later date.
Tension in the room was high dur
ing speeches by both JSA President
Andrew Ehrich '() l ) and SCAI Presi
dent Omar Shakir '07. Their presen
tations were followed by a question
and answer session during which
both speakers addressed the specific
concerns of senators and refuted
each other's arguments.
Noting that his group does not sup
port full divestment, Shakir called on
the I Jniversity to divest from compa
nies that "violate international law
and abuse human rights" in five spe
cific ways.
He argued that the University
should discontinue its support of
companies that provide "military
support or weaponry to facilitate Is
rael's operations in the Occupied Ter
ritories in violation of UN Resolution
242."
SCAI's proposal also listed as tar
gets for divestment companies that
operate on illegally occupied land,
(...) facilitate home demolition, land
confiscation or other acts of collective
punishment as documented by
Amnesty International," and "engage
in practices that institutionally dis
criminate against people of a specific
race, religion or ethnicity."
Ehrich argued that the divestment
bill "misrepresented and unfairly por
trayed the current conflict." calling it
"intellectually dishonest and offen
sive." 1 le said that divestment is "not
a path to peace, and that it is one
sided and counterproductive to think
so."
"ASSU support of the bill would
alienate a large percentage of Stan
ford students by unfairly placing all
the blame for the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict on Israel," he added.
Ehrich emphasized alternatives to

divestment that he felt would repre
sent a better use of the University's
endowment and would better reflect
the broad spectrum of campus opin
ion on divestment. He suggested that
the University support groups like
Seeds of Peace, which "seek an equi
table two-state solution" to the cur
rent conflict.
Ehrich also cited the rejection of
similar divestment proposals at Har
vard, Yale, UC-Berkeley, Princeton
and MIT.
"The Senate isn't the place to dis
cuss Israeli policy," Ehrich said. "We
should be talking about how this issue
is represented on campus."
Shakir's presentation emphasized
SCAI's belief that the campaign for
divestment at Stanford differs from
the plans recently rejected by other
universities because it focuses on "se
lective divestment from particular
multi-national corporations, none of
which are Israeli," and does not ques
tion Israel's right to exist.
In his speech, Shakir made refer
ences to the Jim Crow South and
genocide in Darfur. Specifically, he
drew comparisons between the Unit
ed States' "separate but equal" doc
trine enforced in Southern schools
and the current school system in Is
rael. He also compared discriminato
ry legal systems in apartheid South
Africa with some of the current laws
in Israel.
1 le invoked Sudan as a precedent
for University divestment.
SCAI also called for divestment
from companies that "support the
building or maintenance of the 'sepa
ration barrier' that Israel has built in

the West Bank ," which he said was
"deemed illegal in July 2(X)4 by the In
ternational Court of Justice."
Due to disagreement among sena
tors about the bill's wording and effec
tiveness, the Senate did not vote on
the bill, nor did it make definitive
plans to do so in the future.The nature
and purpose of the separation barrier
was at the heart of many of the ques
tions senators posed to both Shakir
and Ehrich after the conclusion of
their speeches.
While Shakir said the separation
barrier was built to strategically annex
land and water resources. Ehrich
countered that the barrier was "built
with topography and land use con
cerns in mind," and only after other al
ternatives had been tried. He added
that Israel has "affirmed that it will re
move the wall when it is no longer nec
essary." Shakir emphasized the impor
tance of objectivity.
"Just because campus opinion is
split doesn't mean that the middle
ground is the right ground." he said.
Last night's meeting was unusually
crowded. In addition to the Senate,
members of both JSA and SCAI were
present to support their presidents.
JSA members in T-shirts reading "We
love Israel, we want peace"occupied a
third of the room.
Though the debate was intense,
the atmosphere remained cordial.
Both Ehrich and Shakir remained to
answer questions after the meeting
and politely acknowledged one an
other as they left.
