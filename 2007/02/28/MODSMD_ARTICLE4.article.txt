# Car of Future developing
## Self-automated Passat aims to drive in city, around obstacles in the 2007 Urban Challenge 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Ever wished your car could drive itself? Meet "Ju
nior." the Stanford Racing Team's entry for the 2007
Urban Challenge race sponsored by the Defense Ad
vanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
"Junior" is a 200h Volkswagen Passat equipped with
sensors, such as a range-finding laser array and video
cameras that enable it to extract data from the environ
ment.
"The car has a lot of sensors on it that will give it in
formation about its surroundings," said David Oren
stein. communications and public relations manager
for the School of Engineering. "It can get information
such as the speed of the things around it."
Interpreting the information picked up by the sen
sors can be difficult, however.
"Fundamentally, we view this as ;i software chal
lenge. developing Artificial Intelligence software,"
Orenstein said.
"Junior" is also furnished with hardware that can do
computations with and store the data it collects.
DARPA first sponsored a race in 2004. but the Uni
versity did not send a team to the competition until the

next year. The Stanford team won the 2005
Grand Challenge in Nevada with "Stanley"
"With 'Stanley,' we started the car at around
7 a.m. and it came back about seven hours
later," Orenstein said.
One team member likened the experience
of creating and submitting the car to sending a
child off to college.
"Junior" will face more challenges than

"Stanley," which only had to deal with station
ary obstacles.
ITie team behind "Junior" consists mostly
of graduate students, research staff and faculty;
the squad works in the Stanford Artificial In
telligence Lab (SAIL), which is operated by
the Computer Science department.
Team members began work on "Junior" last
year and hope to finish the basic development
of the robotic car — which consists of writing
the software and putting the sensors on the car
in March or April. F hey will then begin test
ing the car in preparation for several qualifying
rounds before the race on Nov. 3.
Orenstein said the technology behind "Ju

nior" could one day have practical applications
in the real world. 1 le mentioned the possibility
of a "chauffeur button" that would let drivers
put their cars on auto-pilot. He also said the
technology could theoretically make driving
safer and cut down on automobile accidents.
"| A self-driving car| may seem like a luxu
ry, Hut if robots could drive safer than people,
it could save tens of thousands of lives a year."
he said. "Most accidents happen because of
human error. Robots don't get sleepy. Robots
don't have too much to drink."
