## What's on your iPod? 
### LAURA CHANG 
The Daily asked eight administrators,
faculty members and students what they
have on their playlists. Read on for four
responses, and look for the continuation
of this series.

John L. Hennessy,
President of Stanford University
Most of what's on my iPod are books! Cur
rently, Ulysses S. Grant's Memoirs is what I am
working on. After that, Walter Isaacson's "Ben
jamin Franklin: An American Life "
I do have some music, but it's very eclectic:
folk (Joni Mitchell and James Taylor), some
older rock (Neil Young and Beatles), Sinatra and
swing era jazz, and some classical music from
Beethoven to Chopin.

My weapon of choice right now is
Rappin' 4-Tay's Don't Fight the Feel
in' album. It's local and classic, like
me. I've got Super Dave's debut
Rain Like Thunder on party shuffle
for the ladies. It goes down especial
ly smoothly when chased with a
bucket of Patron, no lime. Sublime's
"40oz" has been stuck in my head
for the past week, thanks to that ad
venturous night with Miss Lupe. My
favorite tracks right now are Ratatat's
"Seventeen Years," "The Message"
[by] Grandmaster Flash and the Furi
ous Five, John Mayer's new ballad
"Mrazmerized" and everything by the
lovely and talented Brodie Jenkins.
But like the caning of Michael R Fay,
nothing explains my angst better
than AC/DC's "Thunderstruck."

Julie Lythcott-Haims,
Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students
I like a song that tells a great
story and uses tight harmony
to underscore and heighten
the tension or pleasure or
grief or joy told by the lyrics.
My favorite group is the Indi
go Girls, who are true masters
at both the storytelling and the
harmony. Further in both gen
res would be Crosby Stills &
Nash (e.g., "Southern
Cross"). On the pure story
telling side alone I go for
artists like Roberta Flack (e.g.,
"The First Time Ever I Saw
Your Face") and John Mayer
(e.g., "Daughters"). On the
pure harmony side, I like the
Eagles and Simon & Gar
funkel.

Lately I ve been listening to a lot of Fischerspooner
they've got a crazy electronic vibe going on, and
the music is great for relaxing or studying. Ratatat is
another band I listen to on repeat. The Lily Allen CD
has been in pretty heavy rotation as well, especially
the track "Littlest Things." And "Not About Love" by
Fiona Apple is still one of my favorite songs, even
though her album came out last year. She's such a
strong vocalist and it's refreshing to hear a female
kicking buttocks all over the place.
