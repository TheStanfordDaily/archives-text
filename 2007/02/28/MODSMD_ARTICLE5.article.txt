## What's on your iPod? 
### LAURA CHANG 
The Daily asked eight administrators,
faculty members and students what they
have on their playlists. Read on for four
responses, and look for the continuation
of this series.

John L. Hennessy,
President of Stanford University
Most of what's on my iPod are books! Cur
rently, Ulysses S. Grant's Memoirs is what I am
working on. After that, Walter Isaacson's "Ben
jamin Franklin: An American Life "
I do have some music, but it's very eclectic:
folk (Joni Mitchell and James Taylor), some
older rock (Neil Young and Beatles), Sinatra and
swing era jazz, and some classical music from
Beethoven to Chopin.
