## STAFF SET FOR 2007 Harbaugh hires 10, including four from San Diego and a pair of Stanford standouts 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After Athlctic Director Bob
Howlsby hired him in December
as the new head football coach.
Jim Harbaugh went on a hiring
spree.
Ten hires later. Harbaugh ad
mits it was a monumental task.
"You want to check out all
possibilities, and see if they're
going to fit right with the program
and me," Harbaugh said. "Ciuys
with great character,guys that are
technically sound, guys that can
teach.guys that love Stanford and
guys that really wanted to em-

brace what Stanford's all about."
For the most part. Harbaugh's
hires appear to be a reflection of
the head coach himself. Most of
the new Stanford assistants are
young former players who should
bring a renewed energy to the
Cardinal program. And Har
baugh knows how crucial they
will be in determining his own
success.
"To me. the second-most im
portant thing in having a winning
football program is quality of the
coaching staff." Harbaugh said.
"You just can't win without it. not
one had gu\ They 've all got to be excellent because they've got to fit together — they've got to mesh. Besides the support of the Athletic Department,
number two is you've got to have a great coaching staff."
11 trbaugh named five new assistants on Jan. 10. less than a month after he was hired himself. The process finally ended last week, when Defensive

Valley States on their schedule," Harbaugh said. "Any time they play out of conference it is against an SEC team, an ACC team or a
Big 1 0 team. So, I definitely wanted to talk to him. And once I did, [I went] from not knowing him to knowing this is the guy we've got
to get."

turning around the front five for the Cardinal in 2007. Harbaugh told the Daily he looks for Dalman to bring a new attitude to Stan
ford's offensive line. "The agenda of the offensive and defensive line is purest in football," he said. "Because there's no stats for them
they're not scoring touchdowns — those are the guys you build a team around. So it's a big job for [Dalman], and definitely we
wanted to get the right guy in place there: A guy who knows the running game, can teach pass protections and get our lines playing
with mental and physical toughness."
