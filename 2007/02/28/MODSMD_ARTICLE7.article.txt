## Tree hopefuls vie to avoid first cuts Moloney has crowd throw darts at balloons, her 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Who will be the next Tree? That's the
question on the minds of people across cam
pus as Tree Week stunts came to a conclusion
yesterday with a flurry of activity during
which candidates vied to become the next
mascot of the Stanford Band.
As the mornings blue skies morphed into a
driving afternoon rainstorm, candidates per
formed stunts in various campus locations.
Noah Syme '08 opened the day's festivities
with an unorthodox skit in White Plaza. A
large column of people wearing white shirts
and jeans marched into White Plaza and
came to an abrupt halt in front of a confused
crowd. Suddenly, all of them fell to the
ground, leaving Syme standing alone in the
middle.
"When common men fall, the Tree stands
tall." Syme yelled over a bullhorn as he
ripped off his white t-shirt to reveal a green
one underneath before marching out of
White Plaza toward the Row. I lis supporters,
who were lying on the ground, then scattered
in different directions.
"Is that it?" asked a disappointed specta
tor.
ITie next stunt occurred at Lakeside Din
ing. Kyle Owen '10 entered the dining hall
around noon, trumpeting "Fight On." the
USC fight song, and dressed like a Trojan.
After a brief scuffle with a supporter, Owen
was thrown into a black coffin with tree dec
orations and the lid was nailed down.
After a few minutes inside the casket,
Owen rose from the dead and started bang
ing on the lid; he eventually broke through
and emerged covered in strands of green and
red tape. Me then began to dance to the
Band's rendition of "All Right Now."
( liris Stiedemann 10 was eating lunch in
Lap when the stunt occurred.
"It was interesting." he said. "I wouldn't
describe it as fantastic or especially Tree
worthy."

Apparently the Tree selection commit
tee agreed with Stiedemann. Later in the
day, Owen revealed to his Facebook.com
support group "Kyle Owen for Stanford
Tree" that he had been eliminated from
contention.
"Though I feel it was a poor decision. I
must respect the time and patience the for
mer Trees put into making this week awe
some," Owen said after he was cut. "I hope
to return next year with a bigger and more
bad-ass campaign."
John Whipple 10 arranged an alterna
tive sort of stunt by having an event featur
ing the new Dollies, who are purportedly
part of the Tree selection process.
Three Dollies wearing Power Rangers
masks were promised a gift if they could
navigate three obstacles. The dancers were
attacked by a gorilla suit-wearing student
before being chased by a student donning a
banana costume. As they approached their
gift — a drink mixer floating in the Claw
the Dollies had to fend off one final attack
by Whipple, who sprang from the water to
ambush the girls.
ITiroughout the skit, baffled spectators
kept their eyes on the Claw as they walked
past.
Meagan Moroney '10, who wore a
skeleton suit with a sign reading "(Jet
Boney for Moronev" all day, later arrived
in White Plaza dressed in swim fins, polka

clot tights, an Uncle Sam hat and a shirt
with several red. white and blue balloons
attached.
As she was tied to the Birdcage. Mo
loney asked spectators to throw darts at the
balloons. For every white balloon that was
popped. Moroney said, she would eat a r;iw
egg. She offered to eat sardines for blue bal
loons. and said she would drink hot sauce
for popped red balloons. She put on a snor
keling mask for protection before onlook
ers let loose with their darts.
Moroney taunted the crowd throughout
the stunt.
"What are you scared of?" she yelled as
the darts hurtled toward her. "I'm the one
tied up — take your best shot. Ill bet any
one 20 bucks I don't vomit."
A dozen raw eggs, three quarters of a
bottle of hot sauce and two canisters of sar
dines later, all the balloons lay popped on
the ground and Moroney was untied. She
did not vomit.
"Meagan for Tree." she yelled.
Tree Week coordinator and current Tree
Tommy Leep'o7. would not disclose candi
dates who had already been cut, but he con
firmed that final interviews would take
place today and that the new Tree would be
announced early tomorrow morning.
