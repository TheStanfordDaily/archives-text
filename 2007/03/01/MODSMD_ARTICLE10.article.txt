## GRANUATE LIFE GSC struggles with candidate recruitment 
### NIRAJ SHETH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As deadlines near, the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) continued
to deliberate election issues at its
meeting last night, in addition to
passing several bills and clearing up
a mistake made last week.
During the Feb. 21 meeting, the
GSC voted 7-4 to add the Stanford
News Readership Program to this
spring's special fees ballot.The GSC
thought last week that the 64 per
cent vote in favor did not meet the
two-thirds approval needed to pass.
After the meeting, however,elec
trical engineering graduate student
and GSC co-Chair Paul Gurney
consulted the ASSU Constitution
and found a a technical discrepancy.
" The necessary approval for spe

cial fees to go on the ballot is three
fifths (not two-thirds as [we]
thought last night)." he wrote in an
email to GSC members the next day.
At the beginning of last night's
meeting, the GSC corrected its mis
take. retroactively approving the
program — which distributes The
New York Times and The San Jose
Mercury News across campus for
free — for the spring ballot.
"There was a mistake in our
records." GSC co-Chair Jenny Allen
J.D. '07 said. "The group does not
need to petition."
There were no comments or
questions on the matter from the
eight GSC members present.
The GSC discussed another press
ing elections issue closer to home: fill
ing its own seats. According to ASSU
Elections Commissioner Bernard

Fraga '08, only four graduate students
have declared their intentions to run
for seats in the 15-member body. By
comparison, there are already 50 can
didates for the Undergraduate Sen
ate.
"I'm personally discouraged, but
I'm not going to give up." Allen said.
GSC members said they have
been talking to other students in
their departments and lab groups
and are also sending emails out to
lists to encourage students to run .
But only a small number of cur
rent members indicated last night
that they were planning on running
for reelection this spring.

The deadline for students to de
clare their candidacy is Mar. 5,
though that deadline has been ex
tended in the past for the GSC.
On a separate matter, the GSC
also unanimously passed a bill mod
ifying the permanent elections poli
cy they had originally approved on
Jan. 25. According to Fraga. the new
bill aims to fix sections in the origi
nal resolution that "can be inter
preted to limit free speech." A case
regarding the matter is currently
being heard by the Constitutional
Council.
After weeks of deliberation, the
Council also unanimously passed the
Sweatshop-Free Stanford Bill. The
resolution encourages the University
to adopt measures to ensure that
University apparel is not manufac
tured in sweatshop conditions.
While the hill that was approved
last night was modified slightly from
an earlier draft, it did not incorporate

the suggestion made in previous
CISC meetings that apparel sold at
ASSU-run stores, such as ITie Stan
ford Store in Tresidder I Jnion.should
also he required to satisfy the same
standards the resolution asks of the
University.
The CiSC also met with officers
from the Stanford Police Depart
ment, spending much of this time dis
cussing ways to increase bicycle safe
ty and educate bikers about appro
priate traffic laws.
In light of recent events, the offi
cers also touched on the topic of
mental health, answering concerns

about the availability of information
on student suicides and speaking
about some patterns in mental health
they see in their roles as law enforce
ment officers.
"There are certain patterns
among students who commit sui
cide," said deputy Stephanie Taylor,
who was a psychology professor be
fore joining the Stanford Police De
partment. "And we sec some of the
highest numbers among Asian
women."
