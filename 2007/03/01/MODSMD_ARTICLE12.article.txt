# On The Road
## Junior physics/film studies major plans to direct trucker docufilm over spring break 
### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
Dennis Lo '08 will be going on a road trip this
spring break, but it won't be the typical college
vacation. Instead, he will be filming an original
production with a crew of students and Bay Area
professionals.
Lo. wa double major in physics and film stud
ies, is directing "Overloaded," a 35-minute film
that will follow a real truck driver on his road trip
around the West.
On a trip last year to the Grand Canyon. Lo
began thinking about makinga film about a jour
ney "from being secluded in this isolated, city
mindset to one where you become more mature,
learn to connect to other people and stop seeing
things in a self-centered kind of way."
"Overloaded" portrays a trucker on the road,
who receives word that aspects of his life, such as
his marriage and career, are beginning to fall
apart.
"He starts to realize that he really has no con
trol over these things, and that his control is kind
of like an illusion," Lo explained.
Initially, the trucker is very motivated and
goal-oriented. When he becomes disillusioned,
said Lo,"he starts to fantasize about things — he
starts to see natural surroundings in very para
noid ways. 1 le plays music that fits the mood of

the desert environment, and he kind of gets lost
in it."
After soul-searching and talking to people
and.the trucker begins to change and grow from
the experience.
"The motivation from this change comes
from the fact that I kind of know both worlds."
said Lo.'i know what it's like to be kind of lost in
a state where you're just totally immersed in the
mood, and seeing all the big towers in cities does
n't help either. You just feel very lonely."
The film will be a combination of documen
tary, fictitious and experimental elements.
One of the film's real components is the film's
main character, Martin I lurley. Hurley is not an
actor, but a truck driver from San Francisco who
responded to Lo's Craigslist announcement.
The crew will film from San Francisco to Utah
and back, passing through a number of locations
on the way, including the Mojave Desert, Las
Vegas, I loover Dam, and Nevada ghost towns.
"We're not just showing these things docu
mentary-TV style, you know, we're shooting
these locations in a way that matches his emo
tions and how he changes," Lo said. "The style of
the film really takes from the landscape."
Lo is working with a team of seven Bay Area
professionals and seven students, including
scriptwriter Emmanuel Osei-kuffour 'OS and
producer John I lo of San Francisco State.

"We've managed in about two months to put
together a crew that's pretty decently si/ed for .1
film that's this size," 1.0 said. "This is really a very
eclectic mix of people."
Daisy Morin *09, the film's art director, said
she was inspired by Lai's leadership with "(h er
loaded."
"I le always seems to have things really well
thought-out and organized." she added. "Its nice

to be working with someone who's so enthusias
tic and passionate about what lie's doing."
'ITiis will be l.o's third film, following his
shorter pieces "Shades of Revolution" and "Sili
con Ranch."
Lo declared physics as a freshman before dis
covering film in an introductory class his sopho-

more year.
"1 never really studied film before,
but I realized that's the way I think. It
just really latched on to me," he said.
"It was really moving because I do
physics and you practice and practice
and practice and you get good at it by
practicing. Some people have really
good intuition, but I think I lack that
kind of very basic intuition [in
physics], whereas I do have that intu
ition in film."
Lo must now decide whether his
future lies in film school or graduate
school in physics. He admits that he
cannot pursue both of his passions.
"One of the best things I could do
is I could end up in film academia," he
said, adding that he has a very strong
sense of film theory. "And if that does
n't work out, I can always fall back on
the physics."
Lo says that he uses his back
ground in science in the filmmaking
process.
"I see science and art as being very,
very connected." he said. "My philos
ophy behind taking different shots is
that I plan everything out to the most
minute details, so it's almost like an
engineer making a film. Every film
maker does this to some extent, but I
try to blend in problem-solving tech
niques. philosophies that I have in
physics, and I take it to art."
As an art, Lo is attracted to film's
method for showing human percep
tion. its openmindedness, and its con
nective abilities.
"Film is a big production — it's
not necessarily like a painting where
you're the painter and you just do
everything on your own, "he said. "It's
almost like a little industry — there
are just so many people putting to
gether their ideas and in the end you
have a work that's a shared vision,
and I think that's really beautiful."
Lo hopes to debut "Overloaded"
at the Stanford Rim Festival in May.
before submitting it to bigger festivals
such as Sundance, the Los Angeles In
ternational Shorts Film Festival and
Aspen Shorts Fest.
Even though "Overloaded" is
preparing for production, Lo and his
crew are still working to secure grants
for the project, and said they would
appreciate any donations. More in
