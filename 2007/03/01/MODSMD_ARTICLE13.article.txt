# Chimps: culture and spear-slaughter
## 
### 
It seems that apes in Senegal have
learned how to fashion sharp
tools out of sticks. ITie chimps
break off a tree branch, rip off its
leaves, and then use their teeth to
sharpen the end. They then use the
spears to jab into hollow branches or
tree trunks, hoping to skewer sleep
ing prey. The prey of choice is the
bush baby, a tiny primate with huge
eyes and bat-like ears. If the hunting
chimps manage to stab one, the re
searchers say the resulting carnage
"looks like the shower scene from
Psycho."
The attackers are mostly adoles
cent females. They are much smaller
than adult males, and spend most of
their energy caring for their off
spring. Lacking the strength and
time for conventional hunting, these
females are forced to innovate.
This is exciting from a girl power
perspective. It's also a reminder of
how much we share with our primate
cousins.
While chimps fashioning spears
is a recent discovery, chimps making
tools is old news — but news that
dealt a huge blow to ideas about
human uniqueness. "Man the Tool
Maker" was how we defined our
species. Surely, no other animal was
so clever, so innovative as we.

This idea held up until scientists
actually started studying it. Jane
Goodall was the first to observe
chimps using tools in the wild. A
chimp she called David Greybeard
was the first to let her get near him.
One day, while she watched, he took
a long piece of grass, poked it into
the ground, and raised it to his
mouth. When Goodall got close
enough, she could tell that David
was at a termite mound. As he
dipped the long blade into the
mound, the swarming insects at
tacked it. holding on tight with their
jaws. David pulled out the grass, and
bingo! Termite popsicle! David was
using the grass as an insect fishing
pole - the first documented nonhu
man tool usage. Goodall sent an ex
cited telegram to her mentor, the an
thropologist Louis Leakey.
Leakey's response was epic:
"Now we must redefine tool, rede
fine Man. or accept chimpanzees as

humans."
Ever since Leakey's pronounce
ment. humans have been scrambling
to find something unique about our
species. Stephen Jay Gould de
scribed this as a search for the "gold
en barrier" — some characteristic
that would unequivocally separate
man from the beasts.
Culture was one candidate for
this barrier. Certainly, only humans
had the sophistication to pass on
learned behaviors from one genera
tion to another.
TTiis idea, like the toolmaking hy
pothesis, also collapsed in the face of
real data. Chimps spend a good
chunk of their days grooming each
other. The activity clears fur of pesky
parasites and cements social bonds.
But there's more than one way to
groom your buddy, and the way dif
ferent groups of chimps groom
varies widely. 1 land-clasp grooming
is when two chimps hold hands in an
A-frame over their heads, leaving
their free hands to reciprocally comb
the other's exposed armpit. The be
havior is widespread in a preserve
called Mahale on Lake Tanganyika.
But in Gombe, only 170 km away,
Jane Goodall's chimps have never
heard of it.
Or take nut-cracking. Chimps in

West Africa use stones to crack open
nutritious nuts. In hast Africa,
chimps haven't learned this behav
ior, so they ignore the potential food
source.
Nutcracking and grooming

show us that culture can't be
Man's defining characteristic.

But what does that leave?
Oddly, some people seem to

need to believe that humans
are uniquely worse than our
relatives. "Man is the only an
imal to kill for sport," they say

or "Man is the only animal to
kill his own kind." Such state

nients,often accompanied by a sad
shake of the head, remind us of the
depravity of our species.
Hut there's a minor problem with
these pronouncements: they're not
true. Hnter Jane Goodall again. ITie
chimps in her preserve were split
into two groups - the large Kasakela
group lived in the north, while the
slightly smaller Kahama group held

down the south. The Kasakela males
would lie in wait in Kahama territo
ry. where groups of up to five would
attack solitary enemy passers-by.
Over the course of six years, the

Kasakela males systematically
killed every last Kahama male.
Not even violence, then, is
unique to humans. So what does
separate Man from the beasts? It's
not tool-making.it isn't culture,and
it isn't even depravity. Other sug
gestions, like language, capacity for
abstraction, or a moral sense, have
also bitten the dust. Maybe some
day, we will find the golden barrier.
Hut I doubt it. Any differences be
tween humans and chimps are like
ly to be differences in degree rather
than in kind. Evolution means that
species lie on a continuum, not in a
carefully ordered chain of being.
And now that I know about my ass
kicking, spear-wielding chim
panzee sisters. I think that's pretty
cool.
