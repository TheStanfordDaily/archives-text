## 'Goliath' dramatizes Iraq Student-written play tells of soldiers, rape 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As soon as a disillusioned soldier
uttered the last words of a stark mono
logue to 150 students and community
members gathered in Kresge Audito
rium on Tuesday night, a rendition of
the "Star Spangled Banner" —
hummed to the rhythms of steps and
beat-boxing — unfolded.
"I adies and gentlemen, this is the
story of a h* >y. a man and a war. too big.
too real, too normal," the chorus an
nounced. And so began the first inde
pendent public performance of "Go
liath." the ambitious "choreopoem"
creation ofTakeo Rivera "08.
For the next 40 minutes, audience
members watched a sequence of spo
ken word poetry that confronted a
swath of hot button issues including
racism, gender, sexuality and growing
up, all framed within the context of the
Iraq war. Playwright Rivera explained
his choreopoem as a poetry-drama hy
brid. a product of the inspiration he
drew from"The Rainbow is Not
Enuf," Ntozake Shange's Tony
Award-nominated work from 1975.
Rivera's 35-page "Goliath," written
over one frantic weekend, featured a
compact cast of eight actors delivering
a prologue, seven monologues and an
epilogue.
The piece — which was directed
by Alex Mallory '08 — was received
warmly during January's Winter One
Acts. While it is entirely fictional, the
play is inspired by the alleged gang
rape and murder of 14-year old Abeer

Qassim al-Janabi by live American
soldiers in a village near Baghdad on
March 12,2006, according to Rivera.
"Goliath" follows the life of a
young soldier. David, played by Scott
Frank '10. whose slowly crumbling re
sistance to the overwhelming influ
ences of an ultra-masculine father, a
racist friend and a "hyperbolically in
human "sergeant lead to his participa
tion in the rape-murder while on duty
in Iraq.
David eventually comes home a
changed man and writes a letter to his
family — the play's opening mono
logue— to inform them that he will
be leaving them.
"I don't necessarily believe whoev
er did this atrocious and dehumaniz
ing act is evil," said Rivera. "There are
always social factors that inform and
motivate this kind of behavior. 'Go
liath' is an examination of what socie
tal context makes this sort of thing ac
ceptable."
The play is very much about mas
culinity, a concept that Rivera said "in
herently ties into homophobia, racism
and sexism."
Ask Rivera about the war message
in the play, however, and he down
plays any political motivations.
Mallory said she wanted audience
members to interpret for themselves
an ambiguous presentation of theme.
"My goal as a director — and this
was shared by the cast — was to pro
mote discussion," Mallory said. "We
didn't try to infuse the play with a dis
tinct message because we want people
to come out arguing over whether it
was presenting a reality or a criticism."
In the process of attempting to con
vey strong messages to their audience,
Rivera. Mallory and the cast had to
first confront the material of the play

and come to terms with a significant
amount of apprehension.
ITie crew's primary concern was
guaranteeing a fair portrayal of the
American soldiers despite the unvar
nished accounts of the crimes — an
issue the entire production team
found very delicate.
"Scott [Frank] thought about thisa
lot. I le was not comfortable saying the
part unless he felt that he could put it
on in front of his friends who were sol
diers who had gone off to war," Mallo
ry recalled. "He spent a lot of time
coming to terms with that."
InthecndJVlallorysaid.thegroupset

to navigate its intense subject matters
without guilty consciences and without
pointingfingersatthesoldiers.
" Ihe goal of the play is tosay that it's
the social pressures of America that
makesthissortoftragedyhappen "Mal
lory said." If the crime presented in the
show is less great, then it wouldn't be
makingastatementatall."
Rivera spoke of the burden of
shouldering a "huge responsibility"
when writing David's character, since
he also used personal friends who are
soldiers as models for the character.
"What right do I have to write about
a soldier's experience?" Rivera asked.
I haven't gone out to Iraq."
Jessica Cornwell '09, who played
David's mother and the Iraqi victim,
was nervous because of her relation
ship with friends in ROTC. but sup
ported Rivera in his treatment of a
sympathetic character in a "compas
sionate piece." She said that some
parts were altered due to the cast's un
ease with the intense material.
"Thehardestthingformewastheini
tialblockingoftherapescene,whichwas
veryviolent, Cornwellsaid."! feltcom

pletely uncomfortable and it brought
out a lot of really interesting emotions
beeausethat'ssomewherewedon'tusu
allyfindourselves."
Rivera was particularly anxious
about his portrayal of the troops due
to the fact that Sean O'Neill, a 24-year
old Iraq veteran with two tours of
duty, was in the audience Tuesday. Im
mediately following the performance,
O'Neill, now a junior studying politi
cal science at UC-Berkeley, participat
ed in a panel on the soldier's experi
ence in the Iraq war with Rivera and
Jess Ghannam, a professor of psychia
try and psychology at UC-San Fran
cisco.
O'Neill, now an anti-war activist,
expressed his discontent with the mili
tary's treatment of veterans, which he
described as "worse than Vietnam."
Ghannam, who has experience treat
ing Iraq and Vietnam veterans, joined
O'Neill in discussing the thoroughly
debilitating effects of post-traumatic
stress syndrome as portrayed in "Go
liath." '

Rivera and Mallory said the re
sponse around Stanford has been
overwhelmingly positive. Mallory said
she has not received any complaints
that the presentation of the material
was too intense.
"1 have received multiple com
ments from people who say.'l do have
a friend who talks just like this,' or "this
does resonate with me," and 'there are
people who talk like David, who talk
like [David's sister] Maria,' and that is
a biggest compliment," he said.
Looking forward, Mallory said she
has ideas of taking the show on the
road to other schools.
While Mallory dreams of taking
the show on the road, Rivera is still
putting weight on impacting one audi
ence member at a time.
"Someone told me they talked
about 'Goliath' in their IHUM sec
tion," Rivera said with a smile, "and
I'm humbled."
