# Prof, defends long-held theory
## 
### LIA HARDIN STAFF WRITER 
In a coup that went largely unnoticed outside of the sci
entific community, the leading theory about the genesis of
the solar system was turned 011 its head last December
when scientists unexpectedly discovered heavy organic
molecules in the space dust collected by NASA's Stardust
Mission. But according to Chemistry Department Chair
Richard N /are, one of the many scientists in charge of an
alyzing the extraterrestrial particles, the old theory should
not be discarded just yet.
In tact, new unpublished data obtained by Maegan
Spencer, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in chemistry, now
show that the December findings were the result of con
tamination. /.are reported last night in a lecture entitled
"From Dust to Dust: Catching a Comet by the Tail" that
was sponsored by Stanford Continuing Studies and the
Stanford Office of Science Outreach.
/are said the contamination was introduced when or
ganic compounds trapped in aerogel — the cottony sili
con-based material NASA specially developed to capture
the particles — were heated.
"NASA needs to make a better particle capture system
containing less carbon." Zare said in the presentation.
"'lliis is new." he added in response to a question. "Truly
[this is| news in that sense."
/are's criticism comes only two months after the publi
cation of a Dec. 2(H)h special edition of Science that com
piled the conclusions of the more than 150 scientists who
studied the material obtained by the Stardust capsule.
Stardust returned from a seven-year voyage to capture
dust from the tail ot comet Wild 2 (pronounced"vild 2") in
early 2(M)b.
In a press release published in ScienceNOW. the daily
companion to Science, Phil Berardelli reported that there
suits challenged the hypothesis that the solar system
formed in an orderly manner, and instead suggested that
the sun sent hot particles spinning to the outer reaches of
the solar system.
"The results have thrown the conventional solar system
hypothesis on its head," Berardelli wrote.
/are confirmed the impression of theoretical change in
luh presentation, showing slides that depicted the orderly
praation hypothesis. Ibe presence of certain classes of
' l®t heavy organic molecules in the eometary matter
thought to have formed in the frozen outer edges of the
system's Kuiper belt of asteroids would have challenged
the established theory, he said.
/are elected to overturn the conclusions published in
Science dramatically, using an audio clip of music from
Gershwin's"Porgy and Bess "and animated type that read

Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare spoke last night in a Hewlett
Teaching Center classroom about a dispute in the scien
tific community over eometary dust captured by NASA.
"It ain't necessarily so" and "there is another interpreta
tion."
In another slide, lie pointed out that the entire budget
for the Stardust project was equivalent to a single day's
worth of funding for the Iraq war.
"One of the points I want to make to you is that what
[the I inited States is) doing in our science budget overall is
in the noise of what we're doing in Iraq." he said to the au
dience.
Some found /are's decision to release his data publicly
before they had been published an unusual step.
"It's unusual that in a talk like this one gets [to hear]
new data," Senior Associate Dean forthe Natural Sciences
Martin Fejer told The Daily after the talk."lt awaits publi
cation in a refereed journal before it is widely accepted."
/are acknowledged that there will probably be difficul
ty getting the data published.
The chemistry professor said he originally became in
trigued in the project when Spencer, who is his student, be
came interested in the aerogel material that NASA devel
oped to collect particles in the Wild 2 eometary trail.
It was Spencer who stumbled upon the contamination
in the work, which occurs when aerogel is superheated, as
it was during the mission when space particles struck it at
speeds of about 6 km/sec.
Spencer began to use higher-powered lasers to examine
an aerogel sample that was too big for the focal range of
standard lasers. Hie higher-powered beams heated up the
gel,creating large organic molecules in a process Zare pos
tulated was similar to that involved in the formation of
soot.
" Phe piece was much larger than what we're used to
dealing with — |it was| almost out of focus," Spencer told
ITie Daily. "Otherwise I wouldn't have done it."
Ihat accidental discovery led Spencer and Zare to chal
lenge the findings published in December.
It is difficult." Zare said in reference to the challenge
he expects to face in publishing. "The difficulty is how do
you make your voice heard among others."
