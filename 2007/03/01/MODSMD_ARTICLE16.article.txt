### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
A standing-room only crowd
packed Campbell Recital Hall last
night for a poetry reading by the
Mohr Visiting Poet and former Unit
ed States Poet Laureate Robert I'in
sky '65.
Pinsky — who delivered Stan
ford's Commencement address in
1999 — is a professor at Boston Uni
versity but is a visiting professor at the
University this quarter, and he gave
his reading as part of his role as the
Mohr Visiting Poet.
Sara Michas-Martin, a poetry lec
turer.said Pinsky's position is a presti
gious one.
"It's a very special honor to have
the position," Michas-Martin said.
"Only one writer has the position per
year."
Ned I lenningsen '09, who is in Pin
sky's "The Occasions of Poetry"
course,said he admires Pinsky both as
a teacher and as a poet.
"We write poems and he leads a
workshop of them in class," Hen
ningsen said. "He is hilarious, and a
good teacher. [...) But what's funny is
how he'll tell us that the only way to
really get better isn't to hear him or
anyone speak, but to write our own
poetry and study that of great mas
ters."
Pinsky's "The Figured Wheel: New
and Collected Poems 1966-1996" was
awarded the Lenore Marshall Poetry
Prize and was nominated for the
Pulitzer Prize.
English Prof. Ken Fields, who in
troduced Pinsky, said last night's
speaker is the only three-term Poet
Laureate (he served from 1997-2000).
Pinsky and Fields were Stegner Fel
lows at Stanford together.
"Robert and I shared a Wallace
Stegner Fellowship when we were
graduate students just a few years
ago," Fields joked. "What an extraor
dinary time that was becomes clearer
to me every year."
Pinsky commented on his own ex
perience at the University, discussing
his gratitude but also his feelings of
alienation.
"It is truly wonderful to be back
here amongst old friends and new
friends." he said. "[But] when I came
to Stanford, I did not feel at home. I
was from the Fast Coast. I was Jew
ish. Ihe place was nicknamed 'the
Farm.'"
He added that art can draw upon
such experiences of alienation.
"Writing about hometowns is based
on the idea that you don't belong
there," he said. "That human phe
nomenon of feeling quiet different
from someone and quite like some
one [at the same time) is what life is

made 0f... it's what art is made of."
Pinsky began his reading with
poems from"The Figured Wheel," in
cluding one called "ABC" that con
tained only 26 words in alphabetical
order. He also read more recent
poems, including "Poem of Discon
nected Parts" from his book "Gulf
Music," which will be released in Sep
tember.
"I've gotten interested in the idea
of disconnection." he said. "1 would
like to be able to write poems that in
volve politics that are not sermons."
Pinsky spoke about how his own
life figures in his poetry.
"I really was in the eighth grade in the
dumb class, also known as the bad
class," he said. "That's a back
ground of this poem. [I'm] trying to
use the feelings of those days to focus
my political feelings now."
In one of the event's more touch
ing moments, Pinksy read an elegy
for a late friend who he said loved
jokes.
"1 really like jokes," Pinsky
laughed. "And by jokes I don't mean
witty remarks. I mean the Pope and
an optometrist and a zebra go into a
bar. And there's a punch line."
Adhaar Desai '09 commented af
terwards on Pinsky's engagement
with the audience.
"It was almost chilling to feel the
entire audience hanging on his
words," he said, "waiting for him to
turn the page so we could exhale."
