## Editorial Board Hennessy's All Right Now 
### 
As evidenced by a major story in the
Wall Street Journal (WSJ), finding dirt
on John Hennessy is no easy task. The
article, which ran on the front page of the Feb.
24 weekend edition of the WSJ. was over 3000
words long and extensively focused on Hen
nessy's business interests in Silicon Valley.
What appears to have been an in-depth inves
tigation by the WSJ results in no scandalous
revelations or even accusations but amounts to
a detailing of 1 lennessy's holdings and history.
It is comforting to know that our president is
on the level, even if it is a very wealthy one.
According to the article, Hennessy has
earned over $43 million in addition to his offi
cial University salary in the past five years,
and much of it has come from participation
and investments in companies closely tied to
Stanford.
Hennessy sits on the boards of Google,
Cisco and Atheros, and the WSJ reports that
he has invested in "elite venture-capital
funds" like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers,
Sequoia Capital and Foundation Capital.
Many of these firms have also funded start
ups originating at Stanford and I lennessy ap
pears to have been involved in helping estab
lish some of these business relationships.
Yet is there a conflict of interest worthy of
concern?
Part of the WSJ headline reads: "How
John Hennessy's Silicon Valley connections
reap millions for the universityâ€”and him
self." Combined with a graphic showing Hen
nessy in front of 1 loover tower with a wad of
money, a diploma and a computer chip, the
piece seems to insinuate that something im
proper has happened.
The most pressing worries are that Hen
nessy's business might be more important to
him than the University's, and the fact that his
holdings overlap with investments by the
Stanford endowment. The WSJ cites William
Chace, the former president of Emory and
Wesleyan, and former Stanford president
Donald Kennedy as expressing concern on
these issues, but it goes on to quote the chair
man of Stanford's Board of Trustees, and the
General Counsel, both of whom express con
fidence and trust that I lennessy is committed
to being president first. While holding a seat

on the hoard of the endowment, Hennessy
must recuse himself from any business involv
ing companies he is attached to, and may
spend no more than one day a week working
on non-University responsibilities.
ITie tone set by the headline and graphic
could be misleading, but the WSJ does not
make any concrete connections suggesting
wrongdoing, and the whole of the article indi
cates that I lennessy is in the clear.
The most accusatory statement in the
piece says only that 1 lennessy's earnings from
participation and investment in tech compa
nies are."an income stream that many in aca
demia consider without precedent for a uni
versity president."
As a scientist who has held patents, started
companies and written textbooks, Hennessy
is a university president without precedent,
and this is not a bad thing. Yes, he is rich, but
president of a major university is hardly a low
income position in the first place. What's
more, much of his original wealth came from
his work on central processing units. Hen
nessy helped design the Reduced Instruction
Set Computer (RISC) processor, versions of
which were used in enormously popular
products like the Playstation and Nintendo
64, and he has contributed to several text
books on computer architecture. A leader
who is so involved with academia and new
technology is a lucky find.
If Hennessy were really out for his own for
tunes, it is unlikely that remaining an adminis
trator would be the most lucrative position, in
fluence notwithstanding. Hennessy was in
volved with startups before he gained influ
ence as Stanford's president, not because of it.
It is understandable that having a president
who does nothing outside of his official duties
might be desirable on the surface, but Hen
nessy's breadth has proved as beneficial for us
as for him. We remain concerned about tuition
increases, but the University has seen un
precedented fundraising during Hennessy's
tenure, and the close relationships with Silicon
Valley companies are extremely positive. We
are grateful to the Wall Street Journal for its
thorough profiting of our president, and even
more grateful that the results give us more rea
son to support him.
