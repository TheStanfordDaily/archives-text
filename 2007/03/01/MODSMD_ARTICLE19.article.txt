# A 						few college pet peeves
## 
### 
Just last week, a girl answered her cell
phone in a 20-person lecture. And I
began to think about all the other little
things that make me cringe inside. So here is
an incomplete list of things that rub me the
wrong way. get my panties in a twist and
leave me wondering if other people dislike
them too:
1) When a Chapstick is running out. but it's
the only one you have, and you keep digging
the plastic edges into your lips in hopes of
getting any little bit ot lip balm.
2) Powerpoint slides that have size 10-point
font and contain the information of a novella.
3) Laptop use at inappropriate times, like
during presentations.slide shows in art class,
or movie clips.
4) Irrelevant, off-topic, or anecdotal ques
tions in class.
5) The last inch of lead in a mechanical pencil
— it seems too long to throw away, yet just
short enough to not click out any farther.
6) E-mails to dorm lists about needing a
black pen, a cowboy hat or an econ book.
7) The garbage truck at Bam on Saturday
mornings, whose reversing beeps are just
similar enough to your alarm clock that you
get very confused.
<S) Getting a fresh pair of socks wet from the
mysterious and constant Hood in the dorm
bathroom.
9) Gross hair in the dorm sink.
10) Gross hair in the dorm shower drain.
11) Any hair I find that is not attached to my
head and is not attached to somebody else s.
12) Speed biking to your first class of the day
and seeing cheery freshmen already biking
back from their 9 a.m.
13) When I am trying to avoid a biker com
ing head-on from the opposite direction, but
both of us swerve to the same side to avoid
each other, only to swerve again to the op
posite side together, to swerve in unison to
the original side once again, to finally come
to a complete stop, wheel-to-wheel, three
inches away from each other.
14) When Moonbean's closes earlier than
usual.
15) Late-to-class-comers-inners — at least
have a little shame and shut the door slowly
and quietlv.
16) When someone says a class is easy...and
then you get a "B."
17) Three unit classes that are more work
than an Oxford tutorial.
18) Bikini clad girls laying out by the Claw.
19) Scrunchies — if it's cloth and substan
tial. it shouldn't be in your hair.

20) A seemingly flirtatious and interested
dude that then doesn't return your Face
book message.
21) Kids who put their feet up in lecture —
dawgs, this isn't the movies. And take some
notes.
22) Facebook pictures that are too glamorous.
23) Facebook pictures that say,"Look at me,
I'm crazy and fun" and inevitably include a
goofy expression, puckered lips, a fake look
of surprise, neon spandex.an inflatable man
or Aviator sunglasses.
24) Ice cream cones that are broken.
25) When professors give optional reading...l
am struggling to get all the un-optional stuff
done, in your class and in my other three.
26)The kid who does the optional reading.
27) 1 low no matter how often you reposition
your mattress pad. it always sags oft the edge
of your bed. pulling your fitted sheet with it.
28) Those that snub Justin. Nelly or Gwen.
Don't pretend your foot doesn't start to tap
when you hear their dance-ready pop.
29) Classes that end at 12:30.
30) Finally breaking down to buy a new II)
card, only to have it show up in the laundry,
the strangest drawer or a friend's pocket the
next day.
31) When your bike seat gets a hole in it.and
then the incredibly efficient sponge of a
sponge seat expels a liter of water into your
inseam each time it rains.
32) Having to shimmy under the depths of
your desk to unhook the power cord for
your laptop in order to go to the library...and
then doing that all again when you get back
to your room
33) I low my parents have Netflix and watch
way more cool TV than I do.
34) When someone spoils a TV show you
were saving to watch as a treat for yourself.
35) Watching anything in a dorm lounge,
and trying to not listen to all the yelling,
overly laughy, conversations that immedi
ately seem to occur just as you sit down.
36) Forced endings.
