# WANTING MUCH MORE
## Win over ASU might also bring NCAA bid 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
You might think Trent Johnson would be pretty
happy right about now. A win tonight against heavy
underdog Arizona State, and the Cardinal are all
but in the NCAA Tournament, restarting their 11-
year streak after last year's drop-off. Plus, sopho
more guard Anthony Goods is probable for the Pa
cific- 10 Tournament, though he will rest this week
end.
Maybe, then. Johnson should pamper himself
with a trip to the spa because if he's happy under
neath. he's certainly not showing it to the world.
"Finishing fifth, fourth, sixth in the Pac-10 is not
good enough: it's not acceptable," he said. "We
need to get back that tradition we've established
here."
Expectations were never low for Stanford, but
on a team with four starting underclassmen, one of
them injured.Stanford's (17-10,9-7 Pac-10) current
tie for fifth in the conference sounds pretty good.
The league is as tough as it has been in years,and six
Pac-10 teams figure to make the Big Dance.
A victim of the league's resurgence has been
conference cupcake Arizona State. The Sun Devils'
(7-20.1-15) lone conference win came against USC
two weeks ago, but they have been playing the
whole conference tough, including a 61-58 loss to
Arizona in their last game. Freshmen guard Christ
ian Polk and sophomore forward Jeff Pendergraph
lead the squad with 12 points per game apiece.
"I remember Chris |Hernandez] and Matt

[Haryasz] saying
that of all the
teams they hated
to play against,
ASU was the
worst," sopho
more forward
Lawrence Hill
said. "They play
hard, they have a
tough style of play,
and they come in
with an underdog
mentality."

Still. Hill knows the Sun Devils are winless away
from Tuscon, Ariz., and accordingly, he called
tonight's 7:30 p.m. tip a "must-win" for the comput
er rankings and national perception. A loss would
severely cripple the Cardinal, especially right after
being swept by Southern California and UCLA.
"We'll leave it to [California] to give it to them,"
said Hill of an Arizona State road win. "We're not
going to let it happen here. Despite how well we'd
been playing before, the selection committee might
look at us after that and say we're not a tournament
team anymore."
After tonight's undercard, the Cardinal will do
battle with perennial Pac-1() archrival Arizona on
Saturday. Like Stanford, the Wildcats have fallen to
relative mediocrity in recent years, but Arizona (18-
9, 9-7) has the talent of a top-10 team and will be

dangerous come NCA As.
Forwards Marcus Williams, a
sophomore, and Chase Budinger, a
freshman, lead the Wildcats with 16
points per game apiece. Both have
NBA talent. Coach Lute Olson ex
pects Williams to bolt and Budinger
to stay after this season.
Arizona rounds out with seniors
Ivan Radenovic. a forward, and
Mustafa Shakur, a guard. Though
they both average in double figures,
as seniors, they have received much
of the criticism for Arizona failing to
play to its potential.
For Stanford, the 12:30 p.m. start
will mark Senior Day for Carlton
Weatherby and Chris Bobel. And
though the defense-first Weatherby
or the walk-on Bobel's minutes pale
in comparison to the freshmen and
sophomores'. Johnson made no mis
take about their contribution to the
team's mentality.
"1 feel differently about this team
because they care." he said. "They
genuinely care. It's hard for me not
to play everybody."
One guy he will soon get to play
will be Goods, his second-leading
scorer. Goods ran on an underwater
treadmill earlier this week and may
well return to practice and the
pregame shoot-around today.
Nonetheless, Johnson bristled at
the idea of Goods contributing
tonight.
"The game isn't played underwa
ter." Johnson said, 'if we were play
ing ASU underwater, it might be a
different story."
But the coach shouldn't be
speaking so soon. Goods might just
go and invent underwater basket
ball â€” that's how badly he wants to
be back on the court.
"It's frustrating having to watch
from the bench." Goods said. "1
can't remember the last time I got
hurt. It makes you hungrier, and it
makes you realize what a blessing it
is to be here. I'm trying to turn it into
a positive and come out stronger."
