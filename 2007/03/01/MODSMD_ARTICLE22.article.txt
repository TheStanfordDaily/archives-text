# Your high school friends aren't dead
## 
### 
I got this email from an old friend the other
day. I le was moving out to the West Coast
and wanted to meet for coffee, catch up
and maybe go see a ska show together. I was
disturbed. 1 thought he, like the rest of my
high school friends, had died. I hi s
isn't because New Jersey is a hotbed of cars
exploding due to mob hits, people jumping
out of buildings to avoid mob hits and cars
exploding out of buildings into crowded
mobs. Instead, my high school friends have
occupied a secondary space in my life for the
last four years.
I'm here to tell you: Your high school
friends aren't dead.They're more like undead.
Zombies, really. Iliey've existed as half-lives,
being relegated to interactions on vacations
and scattered disturbing phone calls. Ihey'll
call you. moaning and incoherent, and you
could swear they resembled their former living
selves, but it's a party and it's loud so you have
no idea what they are saying. Something about
"dude" and "remember" and "totally." You tell
them that you'll keep in touch, while quietly
loading your anti-zombie crossbow.
But now that you're going to leave the
sanctuary of college, things have changed.
Your high school friends are beating down
the doors and they want their copy of "Boon
dock Saints" back. Also, braaaaains.
After college, your social calendar is
about as dead as Woodrow Wilson (too
soon?). So,you decide to reconnect with your
old friends. You first make contact in any
number of ways. You Facebook them. AIM
them. Run into them at the local Starbucks.
You ask:"l haven't seen you in ages.What are
you up to?" They reply: "Working at Star
bucks." The situation becomes awkward.

"Oh. Yes." "Yourself?" they ask. "Robbing a
Starbucks."
I guess what I'm trying to say is, you are
all going to be in a similar boat next year.
Not much sense differentiating where you
went to college, because you're going to
need an entirely new social network. No,
don't worry,you can still have the Facebook.
(Let's not go crazy here.) Yet. if picking up
romantic engagements is hard, how the hell
are you going to find a new crew of people
to get drunk and play Halo with? That's
where the high school friends come in
handy. And. likely, an Xbox.
You have some things in common right
away. You all need food. You all reference TV
shows with the same annoying regularity as
in high school. You all graduated thinking
that you would be "consultants" but then re
alized that no one actually does that.
Of course, there will be some tensions be
tween your college friends and your high
school friends.They're like oil and water. Jets
and Sharks. Stormtroopers and Calvinism.
Ihey don't really mix. Your high school
friends root for some other college sports
team, which is wrong. It's like hearing that at
their college they were taught 2 + 2 - fish. It
doesn't sound right. You can't wrap your

mind around it. So you wear your college T
shirt more than you did while attending the
school and rub in victories of your team like
it actually mattered. Iliis cycle actually will
hold steady for the rest of your life, particu
larly if you're from the South.
Your high school friends and your college
friends will compete for your attention. It's
an uglier, unshaven novel of manners and
they are suitors for your love, l ike annoying
hipsters, they'll try to one-up the other in
terms of obscure knowledge. In this case, it is
shared experiences of profoundly notewor
thy moments of your lite: "Dude, I was there
when Chris laughed so hard in the cafeteria
he peed his pants." "Yeah, well, dude, I was
there when Chris got sexiled by his room
mate who was hooking up with his crush."
You think about making some new friends.
With graduation on the horizon. I've been
giving this a lot of thought. My high school
friends will be re-animated.and likely part of
my life once again. Likewise, the people
around me that I've seen in the Quad, slept
on their couches and cheered with during
basketball games â€” some of them might be
relegated to the half-life status of their high
school peers. As we scatter in this dark land
scape. it's nice to have someone who knows
the endings to your jokes, who's been with
you in those concert pits, who is going
through the exact same stuff you are. You
don't have to contact these people though.
You lost their copy of "Boondock Saints" a
while ago.

Oh! Look at me! I'm using zombies in a hu
morons manner! I'm so not cliche! Semi com
plaints to ch< >lt(Q\\tanford. edu.
