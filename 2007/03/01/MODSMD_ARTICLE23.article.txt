## Criticism of Howe uncalled for 
### GREG BOARDMAN 
In Tuesday's issue of the Daily, you pub
lished an editorial entitled "Howe could it
come to this?" At the outset, the article seemed
to he a critique of the Office of Student Activi
ties (OSA). its services and policies. Instead,
the writer veered into a misplaced attack on

the staff member who is most clearly identified
with OSA and its procedures.
In the spirit of serious examination and the
open exchange of ideas, we should all feel free
to debate policies, but there is no room in our
community for mean-spirited criticism which
is leveled at specific individuals or groups.
It is regrettable that the Daily editorial

staff saw lit to print this article with its rude
language and personally hurtful commen
tary. Such a diatribe demeans the Daily,
which I know aspires to a much higher de
gree of professionalism.
