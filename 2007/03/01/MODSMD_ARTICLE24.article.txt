## Zeller adapts to better his game 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It there's one thing that's guaran
teed. it's that Jeff Zeller strives to
apply what he knows in various con
texts. Whether it be while injured, in
doubles or in singles matches, the
sophomore will take his wisdom and
work to develop his game.
Although Zeller redshirted in
2(H)(-> because of injury, he was still
able to observe his teammates in ac
tion and apply this knowledge to his
own game when he returned to the
court.
ITiis year, Zeller has used this ex
perience. ;ind along with senior Eric
McKean. has formed a successful
doubles pair that draws inspiration
from the Bryan brothers (Bob and
Mike Bryan — both former Stan
ford players).
ITiroughout this season. Zeller
has learned to apply doubles tactics
in order to improve his singles game,
too. 'ITiese circumstances demon
strate why head coach John
Whitlinger will attest to the fact that
the Centennial, Colo, native is such a
"good student of the game."
Zeller injured his hand in January
of 2(X)6 and took three months off
from tennis. Even when Zeller start
ed hitting agiiin in the spring, he was
not at KM) percent and, therefore,
could not practice with the team. In
his first year on The Farm, Zeller was
forced into the role of an onlooker
and was not able to contribute to the
team on the court.
"When I got injured, 1 took on
more of the observer role, but 1 got
to watch my teammates succeed,"
Zeller said. "I got to watch (sopho
more] Matt [Bruch] get ranked top
5 in the country: I got to watch K.C
[CorkeryJ get to the semifinals of
NCAAs; 1 got to watch KC and
| then-senior| James Pade play some
amazing doubles. I think I really
learned a lot from just sitting back
and seeing what my teammates did
well th;it allowed them to he sue-

cessful.
"So this year, when it was my turn
to he out there, I was able to imple
ment some of those things that I
learned." Zeller continued, it was
n't a complete transition from high
school to college, because I had ex
perienced college tennis by watching
it. Hut now, 1 was more a part of it and
actually helping the team with my
tennis rather than my cheering."
Zeller has succeeded in applying
what he has learned through obser
vation. The sophomore claims that
he emulates the energy and positive
attitude of the Bryan brothers on the
doubles court, and anyone who has
watched Zeller pair up with McKean
will attest to that fact
"Both of these guys will do what
ever it takes to be successful,"
Whitlinger said. "They're both ener
getic. and they'll do anything to win.
They came out during the last three
matches and set the tone in doubles.
They don't get down on themselves,
and it's a combination that 1 envi
sioned when 1 put them together.
They're a very tough, figure-out
wavs-to-win. do-what-it-takes type
of team. It's what you need at [No.]
3."
Following a small slump in the
fall. Zeller worked to bring his sin
gles game up to speed. I le did so by
applying doubles tactics to his singles
game.

"I was struggling in the fall with
my game because 1 missed a lot of
time last year with my injury." Zeller
said. "I kind of lost some of my tacti
cal ability to go out and win matches:
I was having a hard time stringing
points together to win an entire
match."
Zeller then focused with assistant
coach Dave I lodge on a particular
aspect of the game that helped the
sophomore regain confidence in his
singles. Instead of passively allowing
the ball to come to him. Zeller start
ed to take balls earlier and adopted a
more offensive approach. Instead of
waiting for his opponents to make
errors, Zeller began to take high,
short forehands as approaches and
follow them into the net.

"I've been confident with my
doubles this whole time, but my sin
gles was struggling." Zeller said. "By
trying to get into the net off of [short]
balls, |1] took some of the doubles
principles and put them into my sin
gles game. For me, that was what
made it click, and 1 started winning
points on my terms rather than on
my opponents making unforced er
rors."
Although Zeller was handed con
vincing losses when No. 27 Stanford
(3-6) traveled to Los Angeles to face
No. 11 USC and No. 5 UCLA, the
new singles strategies began to take
form last weekend against the Ari
zona schools. On Friday, Zeller post-

Sophomore Jeff Zeller puts his principles into practice — whether it is when
he is on the bench, alone on the court or sharing the court with a partner.
After three months away from actively playing, Zeller is back and applying
what he learned from the sidelines to better his game.
Ed the Cardinal's first singles win
vs ith a 6-2. 6-2 defeat of No. 45 Ari
zona State's Murilo Souza. Zeller
pieked up the first singles win for
Stanford on Saturday as well with a
6-0. 6-3 win over his Wildeat oppo
nent. rounding out a perfect 4-0
record in singles and doubles for the
weekend.
"He's just handling the pressure
very well," Whitlinger said. "There
are pressures [in the second half of
the lineup], and Jeff is handling it
great. I le is prepared.The guy is pre
pared all the time, no matter if he's
going to play singles or not. And
that's all you can ask. When he was
called upon, he performed, and I'm
really proud of him for that."
/eller will be called upon this
weekend in doubles when the team
travels to La Jolla, Calif, to compete
in the 118 th Pacific Coast Men's
Doubles Championships. The tour
nament is open to non-collegiate
players, and Stanford will be sending
four pairs.
"The names on the trophy are in
credible," Whitlinger said. "It's a
"Who's Who* of tennis that have
won this doubles title. It's an honor
to play there, that's for sure.
"I like this tournament when it's
going into Dead Week at the end of
the quarter, but. unfortunately, it's
not this year." Whitlinger continued.
"We come back to play a very good
Florida State team and then a good
[California] team. So even though
we're going to go down and enjoy
ourselves and play a little doubles,
guys know we have some business to
take care of when we get back."
