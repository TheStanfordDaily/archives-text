After playing one of its closest
matches of the season last Friday
night at Southern California, the
Stanford men's volleyball team will
look for fan support this weekend at
home and away against foes old and
new.
The Cardinal go up against No. 9
Pacific (8-9. 6-7 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) in Stockton,
Calif, tomorrow. And on Monday,
Ouincy (3-10,2-3 Midwestern Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association)
visits the Farm for the first time ever.
Enough fan support in either loca
tion could finally give the Cardinal
its second win of the season, as the
team's record stands at 1-17 overall
and 1-12 in the MPSF.
Though Stanford was swept last
week by No. 1 Pepperdine (30-14,
30-22, 30-23), the Cardinal almost
beat No. 14 USC. forcing play to go
to five games with the Trojans.
Freshman opposite Evan Romero
led the Cardinal with 22 kills and
also had six blocks on the night.
Senior outside hitter Matt Ceran
had 16 kills, six digs and five
blocks. Helping out the team ef
fort was sophomore Brandon
Williams who had 11 kills and
seven blocks, finishing with a .333
hitting average.
Trojan junior Juan Figueroa re
sponded with 23 kills, 13 digs and
five blocks, along with C.J. Schellen
berg. who contributed 21 kills.
Though the Cardinal out-blocked
the Trojans 16-11.5, it was not
enough to clinch the win with scores
of 28-30.30-27,25-30,30-27.5-15.
"We had our opportunities in
game one to take control of the
match." head coach John Kosty said.
"When you look at stats, we didn't
lose the match in game five, we lost
the match early on. We're taking
what we learned in that match and
we are going to incorporate it into
our performance this weekend. We
keep moving forward and growing
with each game. We are still a young
team, and we look forward to hope
fully taking one or two wins this
weekend."
Similar to the Cardinal, the Tigers
lost both of their Southern Califor
nia matches (against USC and Pep
perdine) last weekend. Still.eyes will
be on Pacific's key player, Pekka
Seppanen. who is sixth in the MPSF
in aces; he also had 20 kills against
the Trojans last weekend with a .420
hitting average. Matt Cornell is also
a leading attack for the Tigers, hav
ing scored 20 kills and six blocks
against Pepperdine.
In their last meeting, the Cardinal
won game one, but ended the match
with a four-game loss to the Tigers.
In game one, Stanford had a few
major kills and a solid offense. As
the match progressed, though, the
Cardinal accrued many hitting er

rors. leading to its eventual defeat.
"UOP has really good ball con
trol." Kosty said. "The reason they
have the big wins they have is that
many of their players can play many
positions well, giving them a good
substitution system with good play
ers."
Following the match with Pacific,
the Cardinal faces Quincy back at
Burnham Pavilion.The Hawks come
into the match with two consecutive
wins against Mercyhurst.
Offensively, Quincy is led by
Peter Coley, who averages 3.16 kills
per game. Following Coley n kills is
Patrick Reidy with a per-game aver
age of 2.66 kills and a team high of 10
aces on the season. Defensively, the
Hawks are led by Ed Ryan (31
blocks) and Mike Contee and Collin
Cooper, who have 65 and 75 digs
apiece on the season.
"We expect that the match on
Monday with Quincy will have a
good student turnout." Kosty said.
"We need fans to support us this
weekend. Like with any match, we
need to play at a consistently high
level for the whole night so that we
can come away with a win. We have
no video of Ouincy, and we have
never played them before. ITiis al
lows us to concentrate on ourselves,
and what we need to do going into
Monday's match."
The first serve is set for 7 p.m.,
Monday in Burnham Pavilion.
