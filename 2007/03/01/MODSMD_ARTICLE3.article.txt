three-meter event, followed by the one-meter on Fri

Junior Katie Lampe is one of four divers hoping to make
the NCAA Championships next week. Lampe reached
the finals in all three diving events at Pac-10s.
10.
"The team dove well at Pac-lOs,"
said Stanford head diving coach
Rick Schavone. "but that's not nec
essarily an indication of what's com
ing up next.They have to go into this
meet and dive just as well."
Five-time AU-American Krug is
the top contender for the Cardinal.
Earlier this month, Krug was named
Women's Diver of the Meet in the
Pac-1() diving championships after
she took first place in both the three
meter and one-meter events. Krug is
hoping to improve on her Pac-10
performance at this weekend's
meet.
"My dives were pretty good at
Pac-lOs," she said. "It was a good
step to prepare me and help me

focus on my competition, but it was
n't the performance that's going to
win NCAAs."
Deservedly, Krug has garnered a
lot of attention recently in the Stan
ford sports scene. Along with men's
diver sophomore Dwight Dumais,
she was featured as a guest on the
Inside Stanford Sports Radio show
on Monday night.
"I'm really glad that smaller
sports like diving are getting a
chance to get out there and get in
front." Krug said.
Alongside Krug. Lampe is the
other frontrunner for the Cardinal.
At the Pac-10 Championships, she
reached the finals in all three diving
events: the three-meter, one-meter
and platform. She finished fifth in
the three-meter with 292.60 points,
sixth in the one-meter with 258.80
points and fourth in the platform
with 242.85 points.
"Katie has never made the
NCAA championships,so 1 have my

fingers crossed for her," Schavone
said. "She had a great Pac-10 meet,
and she is good enough to go to the
national championship."
Expectations are a little bit dif
ferent for the younger divers. Ohr
did not make the finals at the Pac
-10 meet, but had her best perform
ance in the three-meter event when
she finished ninth in the preliminar
ies. Karp's top dive was her third
place showing in the platform
event.
"I'm not putting a lot of pressure
on Shana [Karp]." Schavone said.
"She's just a freshman, and this is
her first NCAA regional competi
tion,so I really just want her to en joy
the meet."
Even though Krug is Stanford's
top-ranked diver, she is confident in
her teammates' abilities.
"There's a good chance that
some of the other divers will do well
in this meet and make it to the
NCAA Championships in Min

neapolis," she said. "All year we've
been practicing dives and correcting
things, and now we are ready for the
national level."
After a tough season of physical
training. Krug admits that most of
the divers' remaining preparation
will take place at the mental level.
"Rich [Schavone] always says
that at meets we just have to dance
with the boy that we took to the
dance —in competition there is
very little we can change,and we just
have to go out there and dive," she
said.
Schavone agrees that his divers
are ready to perform on the nation
al scene.
" Hie divers have been resting a
little more and putting more quality
in their training," he said. "They are
feeling strong, feeling rested, and
now it's game time."
