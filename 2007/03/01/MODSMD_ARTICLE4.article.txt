# Cardinal back on top
## ASU, SDSU, UCSD try to douse No. 1 Stanford water polo 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Weather forecasts call for relatively chilly tempera
tures in Arizona and Southern California this weekend,
hut it will take a lot more than that to cool off the red
hot Stanford women's water polo team on its upcoming
three-day swing through the Southwest.
The Cardinal (11-1. 4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) hits the road this weekend, slated to play a
Friday evening contest at Arizona State, followed by a
pair of games on

Saturday and
Sunday against
UC-San Diego
and San Diego
State. And after
posting an im
pressive 8-4
upset of defend
ing national
champ i on
UCLA last Sun
day in the Irvine
Invitational title

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
3 i @ No. 11 Arizona
State W/L (3-6, 0-1 MPSF)
UP NEXT
NO. 9 SAN DIEGO STATE
(7-3.0-1 MPSF)

game, the Cardi
nal also has a No. 1 ranking to defend for the first time
in nearly four years.
The Stanford women refused to he satisfied with the
result of their work last weekend, noting that the next
stretch of their schedule will afford them the opportu
nity to refine critical aspects of their game.
"We know that there's stuff from the IJCLA game
we need to improve on." sophomore driver 1.010 Silver
said."[Winning| g;ive us a new confidence, hut three of
their four goals came out of two-meters, so we definite
ly have to work on that."
Silver recorded nine goals in Stanford's four games
at the Irvine Invitational. A hat-trick against the Bruins
pushed her team-leading goal total to 27. Senior goalie
Meridith McColl praised the sophomore driver as a key
reason for the Cardinal's early suc
cess this season.
"Offensively, we're playing with
panache, which is so fun to see from
our girls." McColl said. "They've al
ways been capable of putting some
serious dents in the scoreboard, but
this year we're acting like it. I credit
I ,010 in part — she's matured in shot
selection and improved her accuracy
-and form, and these things have
made her a more potent threat."
McColl. the anchor of the Cardi
nal defense, also noted another ele
ment of Silver's play that has been
lust as valuable as her powerful right
arm.
"But her contribution runs deep
er (than just her offensive threat),"
McColl said. "She is a hustler, not
afraid to shoot by any means, and al
ways steps up to take on a challenge.
And if she misses, she hauls [tail]
back down the pool, meaning she
gives up nothing the other way.
Granted, she's just a part of our
multi-faceted offense, but the atti
tude she brings is priceless — and it
rubs off on others in practice and in
games"
The Cardinal face off on Friday
against a No. 11 Arizona State squad
that has endured a tough beginning
to its 2007 campaign. Ihe Sun Devils
(3-6,0-1 MPSr) have yet t<> play a
home game this season and will
make their first appearance in front
of their home crowd against the Car

dinal. Led by senior attackers Katie
1 iedley and Ashley Bower. ASU en
ters the weekend with the momen
tum from a 13-11 overtime victory
against UC-Santa Barbara. Stanford
has faced the Sun Devils once this
season, winning l(i-7 in the second
round of competition at the Stanford
Invitational.
After their stop in Tempe. Ariz.,
the Stanford women travel back to
San Diego for two more conference
games. The Cardinal first takes on
No. San Diego State (7-3, 0-1
MPSF) at the Aztec Aquaplex on
Saturday afternoon. The Aztecs'
lone conference loss came in heart
breaking fashion versus No. 7
Hawaii when SDSU nearly pulled
off a major upset in I lonolulu. After
forcing the game into overtime, the
Aztecs came up just short, asa Rain
bow Wahine goal in the second extra
period proved to be the difference.
SDSU earned a pair of victories last
Sunday to take ninth at the Irvine In
vitational. and sophomore Anna
Gonzalez paces the Aztec offensive
with an average of two goals per
game.
Stanford wraps up its weekend
on the other side of town against No.
17 UC-San Diego (4-6,0-0 MPSF).
The Tritons were sent reeling by two
upset losses on the final day of com
petition at the Anteater Invitational.
The winless weekend was particular
ly frustrating for the San Diego
squad, which had taken seventh
place as the host of the Triton Invita
tional two weeks earlier.
