# Lots of Lopez
## Brook Lopez's offensive peak points Card in right direction 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman forward Brook Lopez's recent play has
excited the kind of speculation that ends in wild pro
jections about guaranteed NBA millions and future
celebrity. In Lopez's case, those predictions might not
be too far off. Conventional wisdom holds that he will
end up as a lottery pick in the draft, whenever he de
cides to enter it.
But Lopez — who has scored over 20 points in each
of the Cardinal's last four games, revealing aglimpseo!
his tantalizing potential — had other things on his
mind when he strolled into Monday's press confer
ence, wearing a Spider Man T-shirt, and slumped his 7-

Those are the important things."
But Johnson and the rest of the team have also
come to rely heavily on Lopez's presence in the start
ing lineup. Abstract expectations are one thing, but he
has increasingly been asked to shoulder more of the
burden on both the offensive and defensive ends of the
floor.
In his last 10 games, beginning with the block party
against USC, I ,opez has averaged 17.5 points and 7.3
rebounds. At the beginning of the season. Johnson said
that it would be unreasonable to expect I .opez to aver
age 15 points and 10 rebounds, but the coach's star
freshman has come pretty close of late.
"I le's taking better shots each game," Johnson said.
