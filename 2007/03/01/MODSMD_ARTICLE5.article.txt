# Lots of Lopez
## Brook Lopez's offensive peak points Card in right direction 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman forward Brook Lopez's recent play has
excited the kind of speculation that ends in wild pro
jections about guaranteed NBA millions and future
celebrity. In Lopez's case, those predictions might not
be too far off. Conventional wisdom holds that he will
end up as a lottery pick in the draft, whenever he de
cides to enter it.
But Lopez — who has scored over 20 points in each
of the Cardinal's last four games, revealing aglimpseo!
his tantalizing potential — had other things on his
mind when he strolled into Monday's press confer
ence, wearing a Spider Man T-shirt, and slumped his 7-
foot frame into a foldingchair.
"I'm a little tired," he said. "I've been up all night
writing a paper."
First-round bonus baby or no, Lopez is still a fresh
man, a fact that his coach has stressed all season. And
though he often shows off his jumping ability on the
court (just ask Southern California, against whom he
recorded 1 2 blocks in one game earlier this season). he
is doing all he can to keep his feet on the ground oth
erwise.
"What I really like about Brook is that he trusts in
his teammates, in the school, in the people around
him," head coach Trent Johnson said. "He scores 20
points a few games in a row and suddenly everyone
and their mother is coming to the games. What you
lose sight of is that he's only 18. The real questions to
me are — Is he having fun? I low's he doing socially?
Those are the important things."
But Johnson and the rest of the team have also
come to rely heavily on Lopez's presence in the start
ing lineup. Abstract expectations are one thing, but he
has increasingly been asked to shoulder more of the
burden on both the offensive and defensive ends of the
floor.
In his last 10 games, beginning with the block party
against USC, I ,opez has averaged 17.5 points and 7.3
rebounds. At the beginning of the season. Johnson said
that it would be unreasonable to expect I .opez to aver
age 15 points and 10 rebounds, but the coach's star
freshman has come pretty close of late.
"I le's taking better shots each game," Johnson said.
"1 lis talent leads him to take a few bad ones everv so
often. Sometimes he shoots a fade
away or a three-pointer, as opposed to
playing big."
Lopez's offensive surge has been,
in large part, a product of necessity.
I le has averaged 23 points in the four
games since sophomore Anthony
(ioods, the Cardinal's second-leading
scorer, went down with an ankle
sprain at Washington. And while
Lopez has failed to compensate for
Goods' three-point shooting — he's
made one of eight over that span —
he has kept Stanford's offense afloat.
"That's probably it: I've gotten
more shots with Anthony out," said
Lopez, trying to explain his recent
scoring."But I 've also been more con
fident in practice and in full-court
training with the team. It's repetitive,
but it really helps me just to go
through the post moves in practice."
Lopez is peaking at the right time
on offense. 1 le credits an early-season
back injury, which caused him to miss
the season's first five games, for keep
ing him fresh down the stretch run.
Ilis brother, Robin, meanwhile, has
faded on offense since Brook's surge
and has not scored in double-digits in
any of the last 10 games.
ITiough his offensive game has
blossomed. Brook has expressed a
good deal of self-criticism over his
performance on the defensive end
over the last three weeks, with Stan
lord losses to Washington and the Los
Angeles schools. I le senses, like many
NBA scouts must, that he still has
plenty of room for improvement.
"I think our defensive intensity has
been lacking," Lopez said. "1 didn't feel
like we wanted to go after guys; some
thing was missing. That carried into re
bounding, especially mine. We weren't
looking to get on the floor, get to the
lost ball. We were just watching it and
expecting someone else to get it."
1 .opez attributed it to mental focus
rather than physical shape: but his
coach said that, if anything, Brook was
trying too hard.
"It's funny that he said he felt like
he wasn't playing hard enough (on de
fense against UCLA] because he's
usually very smooth," Johnson said.
"The game comes naturally to him.
And after watching the tape, 1

thought he was exerting a lot of ener
gy"
Despite Lopez's self-criticism,
Johnson said that he has been im
pressed by his freshman forward's
ability to keep his head up during
games. That is a challenge for any
young player, especially on a team
that relies as heavily as Stanford does
on freshmen and sophomores.
"I think he's doing a lot better with
the double-team." said Johnson.
"I le's keeping his composure."
"Earlier in the year, he would get
down on himself and tell me.'l look
like you,"' Johnson continued, paus
ing to demonstrate a hang-dog ex
pression. curling his mouth into an
angry frown. "That's an ugly sight. It
means that there's a lot of anger and
frustration there. 1 told him 1 don't
want him to look like me."
Johnson hopes he doesn't see that
expression this weekend in games
against Arizona State and Arizona —
games which could determine
whether the Cardinal receives a bid to
the NCAA tournament. He does,
however, hope to see Lopez in a Stan
ford jersey for at least another year or
two, before the pull of the NBA drags

Lopez into its current. Johnson said
that players leaving the Farm early
has contributed to a decline in the
Stanford basketball tradition over the
past few years.
Lopez is playing the cards close to
his vest when it comes to the draft,
maintaining that hew ill make that de
cision with input from his family and
coach when the time comes. For now,
though, he's enjoying his freshman
year. And. of course, preparing for
tonight's game against Arizona State.
"1 was watching their game against
Arizona with one of my friends on the
hall, who's a big Arizona fan." Lopez
said, referring to ASU's (i 1 -5cS loss last
weekend. "I told him.'Watch out for
ASU, they're dangerous.' Sure
enough, they made a big comeback in
the second half."
"1 wouldn't say that I'm worried,"
Lopez said,"but I'm cautious."
Which is probably the way John
son feels about the chances that his
talented freshman will stick around
long enough to rebuild the Stanford
tradition.

coach said that, if anything, Brook was
trying too hard.
"It's funny that he said he felt like

usually very smooth," Johnson said.

Despite Lopez's self-criticism,
Johnson said that he has been im

on freshmen and sophomores.
"I think he's doing a lot better with
the double-team." said Johnson.
"I le's keeping his composure."
"Earlier in the year, he would get
down on himself and tell me.'l look

Johnson hopes he doesn't see that
expression this weekend in games
against Arizona State and Arizona —
games which could determine
whether the Cardinal receives a bid to
the NCAA tournament. He does,
however, hope to see Lopez in a Stan
ford jersey for at least another year or
two, before the pull of the NBA drags

Lopez into its current. Johnson said
that players leaving the Farm early
has contributed to a decline in the
Stanford basketball tradition over the
past few years.
Lopez is playing the cards close to
his vest when it comes to the draft,
maintaining that hew ill make that de
cision with input from his family and
coach when the time comes. For now,
though, he's enjoying his freshman
year. And. of course, preparing for
tonight's game against Arizona State.
"1 was watching their game against
Arizona with one of my friends on the
hall, who's a big Arizona fan." Lopez
said, referring to ASU's (i 1 -5cS loss last
weekend. "I told him.'Watch out for
ASU, they're dangerous.' Sure
enough, they made a big comeback in
the second half."
"1 wouldn't say that I'm worried,"
Lopez said,"but I'm cautious."
Which is probably the way John

talented freshman will stick around
long enough to rebuild the Stanford
tradition.

Freshman forward Brook Lopez's recent play has
excited the kind of speculation that ends in wild pro
jections about guaranteed NBA millions and future
celebrity. In Lopez's case, those predictions might not
be too far off. Conventional wisdom holds that he will
end up as a lottery pick in the draft, whenever he de
cides to enter it.
But Lopez — who has scored over 20 points in each
of the Cardinal's last four games, revealing aglimpseo!
his tantalizing potential — had other things on his
mind when he strolled into Monday's press confer
ence, wearing a Spider Man T-shirt, and slumped his 7-
foot frame into a foldingchair.
"I'm a little tired," he said. "I've been up all night
writing a paper."
First-round bonus baby or no, Lopez is still a fresh
man, a fact that his coach has stressed all season. And
though he often shows off his jumping ability on the
court (just ask Southern California, against whom he
recorded 1 2 blocks in one game earlier this season). he
is doing all he can to keep his feet on the ground oth
erwise.
"What I really like about Brook is that he trusts in
his teammates, in the school, in the people around
him," head coach Trent Johnson said. "He scores 20
points a few games in a row and suddenly everyone
and their mother is coming to the games. What you
lose sight of is that he's only 18. The real questions to
me are — Is he having fun? I low's he doing socially?
Those are the important things."
But Johnson and the rest of the team have also
come to rely heavily on Lopez's presence in the start
ing lineup. Abstract expectations are one thing, but he
has increasingly been asked to shoulder more of the
burden on both the offensive and defensive ends of the
floor.
In his last 10 games, beginning with the block party
against USC, I ,opez has averaged 17.5 points and 7.3
rebounds. At the beginning of the season. Johnson said
that it would be unreasonable to expect I .opez to aver
age 15 points and 10 rebounds, but the coach's star
freshman has come pretty close of late.
"I le's taking better shots each game," Johnson said.
"1 lis talent leads him to take a few bad ones everv so
often. Sometimes he shoots a fade
away or a three-pointer, as opposed to
playing big."
Lopez's offensive surge has been,
in large part, a product of necessity.
I le has averaged 23 points in the four
games since sophomore Anthony
(ioods, the Cardinal's second-leading
scorer, went down with an ankle
sprain at Washington. And while
Lopez has failed to compensate for
Goods' three-point shooting — he's
made one of eight over that span —
he has kept Stanford's offense afloat.
"That's probably it: I've gotten
more shots with Anthony out," said
Lopez, trying to explain his recent
scoring."But I 've also been more con
fident in practice and in full-court
training with the team. It's repetitive,
but it really helps me just to go
through the post moves in practice."
Lopez is peaking at the right time
on offense. 1 le credits an early-season
back injury, which caused him to miss
the season's first five games, for keep
ing him fresh down the stretch run.
Ilis brother, Robin, meanwhile, has
faded on offense since Brook's surge
and has not scored in double-digits in
any of the last 10 games.
ITiough his offensive game has
blossomed. Brook has expressed a
good deal of self-criticism over his
performance on the defensive end
over the last three weeks, with Stan
lord losses to Washington and the Los
Angeles schools. I le senses, like many
NBA scouts must, that he still has
plenty of room for improvement.
"I think our defensive intensity has
been lacking," Lopez said. "1 didn't feel
like we wanted to go after guys; some
thing was missing. That carried into re
bounding, especially mine. We weren't
looking to get on the floor, get to the
lost ball. We were just watching it and
expecting someone else to get it."
