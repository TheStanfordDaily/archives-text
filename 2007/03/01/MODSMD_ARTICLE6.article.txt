# TOP FIVE TO WATCH
## 
### 
1. Red Robin
Officials have freshman center Robin Lopez seeing red,
whistling him for two early technicals in recent games.
He needs to keep his cool his team needs him out
there in the defensive paint.
2. Loco Lopez
Freshman forward Brook Lopez has scored over 20
points in three straight games. If he makes it four straight,
Stanford's a lock tonight for a win.
3. Speed II
UCLA used its quickness to beat Stanford up the court,
around screens and on the scoreboard. Arizona State is
much slower, so Stanford needs to make sure there's no
sequel.
4. It's One, Two Strikes,
You're Out
Head coach Trent Johnson guarantees the reduced
playing time he's trying to avoid when he sits a player in
the first half with two fouls. Cardinal players need to stay
out of foul trouble early to avoid riding pine.
5. Homeward Bound
The Cardinal is 6-0 in the Pac-10 in front of its fellow stu
dents. Arizona State hasn't won on the road all year. Do
the math.
