For the second straight tourna
ment of the winter season, the No. 7
Stanford women's goll team deliv
ered an uncharacteristic sub-par per
formance. llus time, the Cardinal
women tied for 10th place at the Ari
zona Wildcat Invitational in Lucson,
Ariz, on Monday and Tuesday.
At the Invite. Stanford's final
three-round tally was a 62-over-par
914 with rounds of 299,309 and 306. In
comparison. No. 2 Arizona State took
home top team honors with a two-day
total of 868 (16 over par; 3(K)-277-
291). It was an eight-stroke victory
over the two-time defending national
champion. No. 4 Duke, which totaled
an 876 (24 over par: 296-292-288).
Rounding oil the top five were No. 11
Southern California (881). No. 22
Brigham Young(B9s)and No. lh New
Mexico and No. 3 Pepperdine (897).
Notably. No. b Vanderbilt shot a
30-over-par 314 on the final day. tying
for 10th with the Card. No. 10 Virginia
finished 14th overall out of 15 teams
with a 935.
Lor the second straight week, sen
iors Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana and
Lauren Todd led the way for Stan
ford. langtiphaiboontana finished the
Invite tied for fourth place overall
with a total of 216 (three over par)
with rounds of 74,70 and 72.The tour
ney was the second straight in which
Tangtiphaiboontana's strong play
paced the squad.
"Our seniors are definitely playing
well and leading the team in many re
spects." coach Caroline O'Connor
said. "The biggest difference for Jen
nifer this week, compared to last
week, was the improvement of her
short game and course management.
When she did miss the greens, she
missed them in the right spots and got
the ball up and down a great majority
of the time."
Following Tangtiphaiboontana,

Todd dropped 12 places to 23rd on the
final day. Her seven-over-par 78 on
the final round brought her total to
225 (12 over par). She tied with five
other golfers.
"Lauren's hall striking was excep
tional. particularly during the first 36
holes, but she struggled a bit with ball
control yesterday," O'Connor said.
"Additionally, her short putting — in
side 6 feet or so — was very solid."
Next highest among the Cardinal
contenders was freshman Catherina
Wang, coming in at 54th with rounds
of 75.84 and 77 for a 23-over-par 236.
One stroke behind Wang was sopho
more Mari Chun at 237 (24 over par)
with rounds of 76. 82 and 79. Finally,
sophomore Ki-Shui Liao finished
78th with rounds of 86,86 and 87 for a
total 0f259 (46 over par).
Taking into consideration the last
two weeks, some changes may be
made to the Stanford lineup.
"I think the core of the team is in
tact. but we clearly need support
throughout the lineup." O'Connor
said. "The line-up changes often, so
you might see a change in this next
event."
After beginning its spring season
below par. the team will not see tourna
ment play again for nearly a month.
Stanford's next scheduled match will
be the PING ASLJ Invitational in
Tenipe.Ariz.on Mar.3o.The break pro
vides the team with time to regroup.
"We need to be playing as much as
we can during the next month, com
peting amongst ourselves," O'Connor
said. "Generally speaking, our funda
mentals are solid, but we need to do a
much better job adapting to the dif
ferent courses, environments and
consequently, scoring. Our short
game must continue to get better. Our
overall up-and-down average needs
to be at least 65 percent.and we're not
close to that."
