A suicide bomber detonated an explosive device at
the gate to the main U.S. military base in Afghanistan on
Tuesday. Military officials said that the bomber did not
breach the secure perimeter of Bagram Air Base, which
is situated 30 miles north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul.
The blast killed at least 23 people, among them two
American servicemen,one soldier from South Korea and
a 12-year-old Afghan boy, but the attack drew special at
tention because U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney was vis
iting Bagram at the time. The Taliban, which is rumored
to be gaining strength in the mountainous region of
North Waziristan in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for
the bombing, but this announcement was rejected by a
spokesman for the U.S. military. Major William Mitchell
told BBC News that Mr. Cheney's arrival was scheduled
to take place "within a two week window," and that "it
was simply a coincidence" that the attack occurred dur
ing his visit. The Vice President was in Afghanistan to
meet with President I lamid Karzai and to discuss theTal
iban's anticipated "spring offensive." an upcoming push
by the Islamist group to break the will of the NATO coali
tion currently deployed throughout the country.
Vice President Cheney's trip to Afghanistan followed a
visit to Pakistan's capital. Islamabad, where he met with
head of state General Pervez Musharraf on Monday. In a
meeting of the Vice President. General Musharraf and
Deputy C.I.A. Director Stephen Kappes, Mr. Cheney

urged the Pakistani government to step up its efforts to root
out al Qaeda outposts in North Waziristan while General
Musharraf insisted that Pakistan is fully cooperating with
the United States and doing everything in its power to de
feat militant Islamists. 1 lowever, the new national director
of intelligence. Mike McConnell,stressed his concern to the
Senate Armed Services Committee this week that Pakistan
is not pursuing al Qaeda operatives with enough aggres
sion. Within Pakistan, Mr. Cheney's comments delivered a
new fodder for the criticism of the Musharraf government
by its political opponents, many of whom come from a
coalition of Muslim parties. Ahsan Iqbal of the Pakistan
Muslim League (PML-N) said that Mr. Cheney's admon
ishments provided further evidence that "foreign policy
works with dignity only under a democratic government."
On Tuesday, rebel fighters from the Tamil Tigers ter
rorist group launched a mortar attack against military
helicopters that were transporting foreign diplomats in
the South Asian island republic of Sri Lanka.The U.S. and
Italian ambassadors were wounded in the incident, but
their injuries were not severe.
