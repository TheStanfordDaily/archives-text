# Seeing double
## Twins discuss life with lookalike 
### JENNIFER CHIN 
Admit it. If you've seen "The Parent Trap" or
"It Takes Two," you've had this dreanv. You go
away for the summer, where you encounter some
one who looks and talks like you do. Before long,
you realize you have a twin you never knew about.
For Deborah and Denise Sohn '09, waking up
and looking across the room at their mirror image
isn't a dream. They've lived together their whole
lives and now share not only DNA but also a room
in Freshman-Sophomore College (FroSoCo).
According to the National Center for Health
Statistics. 3.1 percent of births in the U.S. are twin
births. The Stanford Undergraduate Admissions
Office does not collect specific data on twin admis
sion or enrollment, but a small population of Stan
ford students are also one of two. including the
Lopez twins — Brook and Robin '10 — who have
made headlines this year as starters on the men's
basketball team.
Twins at Stanford say they have to balance their
separate identities with the close bond they have
formed with their twin.
Owen and Margo Watson '09 initially wanted to
go to different colleges.
"We wanted to go to different schools so we'd
have a chance to develop as two separate people,"
said Margo. "We never want to become Gwen
and-Margo."
Gwen and Margo said they grew up as a unit,
the Watson girls, and both wanted to escape this
mentality at college.
Gwen even wrote her application essay about
finding herself separate from her sister. Originally,
each twin had different preferences for schools —
except for Stanford, a top choice for both. Neither
anticipated both of them getting accepted. Even
when they did. they still deliberated before they each
made the independent decision to come to Stanford.
For the Sohn sisters, going to Stanford together
just fell into place. But Denise and Deborah had
n't necessarily planned on going to college togeth
er. much less rooming together.
"We knew we wanted to be on the same coast.
We wanted to live within hours of each other,"
Denise said. Stanford happened to be both of their
first choices, and they both got in.
While they lived in different houses of FroSo-
Co as freshmen, they turned to each other as
roommates this year because, as Deborah ex
plained. "We're just really compatible."
ITie twins,for example, share a passion for clas-

sics, which both plan as a first major
They plan on having separate dou
hie majors.

"The best part about being a twin
is always having a friend around." said

Denise."lt's good to have someone in col
lege that knows your background."

Some, however, come to Stanford and find
themselves apart from their twins for the first
time in their life.
Andee Nos'o9is across the country from her
fraternal twin Laura, who attends Mt. Holyoke
College in Massachusetts. Partly due to different
personalities — Andee was the outgoing athlete.
Laura the more reserved dancer — the twins
knew from the get-go that they wanted to look at
different colleges.
"We didn't really mean to separate this far."
Andee admitted. "But we talk on the phone at
least ever>' other day. so it doesn't always feel like
we're so far away. I don't think we'd see each other
much more if I was on the East Coast."
Laura visited Andee once last year, and Andee
went out to Mt. I lolyoke last spring break. Andee
considered the trips beneficial.
"It's harder in some ways [to attend different
schools] because I don't always know what or who
Laura is talking about." Andee said."But w<. got to
meet each other's close group of friends, an J we've
had a chance to not necessarily'gain approval,' but
to know what's going on."
Separation can also happen to twins after col
lege, as it did for alumni Peter and Allen Yu '05.
founders of a Stanford Twins Facebook group.
Peter now works in San Francisco while Allen is in
New York. However,the brothers remain close and
have collaborative projects together on the side.
After graduation, Claire and Julia Calzonetti
"05 decided to live and work in New York togeth
er. At Stanford, they were both recruited for the
Cardinal lacrosse team, an advantage on the field
in that opposing teams often got them confused.
But it got tricky in other situations.
"One time a girl said Mi' to me that Claire
knew through her thesis seminar," recalled Julia. "I
figured that would be that and we'd go on our own
ways. But then she started to talk in depth about
Claire's thesis and it caught me off guard. At that
point we were too far into the conversation for me
tosay.'l'm not Claire, but I've been pretending for
the past 10 minutes.'" Julia ended up faking knowl
edge about Claire's thesis for 20 minutes.
The Sohn sisters also described how twin mix-

ups could load to awkward *
"If people don't know [Deborah and 1] are twins.'"
explained Denise Sohn, "they'll wave to Deborah.
She won't know them and won't always wave back,
making some people think I'm not very' friendly. In
reality, it's just a case of mistaken identity.
Peter Yu also remembers how people always
confused him and his twin Allen. The brothers
eventually drew the line when it came to romance
and prospective girlfriends mixing them up.
"The way we solved this was to give each other
space," said Peter. "If we told each other \ye were
interested in some girl, under all circumstances
when we saw them we would have to run the other
way and avoid being seen. We were never to start
up any real conversation." j
The Watson sisters capitalize on thr fact that
their voices sound so similar.
During boring conversations. Gwen explained,
"we'll just switch the phone back and forth. At the
end. we'd tell our friends,'By the way. you talked
to both of us!"'
Sometimes the similarity backfired. "In my
freshman dorm." Gwen said."Margo would come
over and people would think I was talking to my
self because we have the same voice."
Ultimately, being a twin has a lot to do with how
you approach it.
"Being a twin is kind of like a marriage that
you're born into," theorized Gwen Watson. "You
have the choice to divorce each other and never talk,
or embrace the connection and find strength in it."
It seems that twins overwhelmingly choose the
latter.
"I'm not always sure about things in my life."
said Margo Watson."But something I'm sure about
is that [Gwen | will always be a part of my life."
The same goes for the Yu brothers, who keep in
touch across the country. Joked Peter. "Like they
say in the old Chinese idiom, two chopsticks togeth
er are harder to break than one ehopstick alone."

"One time a girl said Mi' to me that Claire
knew through her thesis seminar," recalled Julia. "I
figured that would be that and we'd go on our own
ways. But then she started to talk in depth about
Claire's thesis and it caught me off guard. At that
point we were too far into the conversation for me
tosay.'l'm not Claire, but I've been pretending for
the past 10 minutes.'" Julia ended up faking knowl
edge about Claire's thesis for 20 minutes.
The Sohn sisters also described how twin mix-

"If people don't know [Deborah and 1] are twins.'"
explained Denise Sohn, "they'll wave to Deborah.
She won't know them and won't always wave back,
making some people think I'm not very' friendly. In
reality, it's just a case of mistaken identity.
Peter Yu also remembers how people always
confused him and his twin Allen. The brothers
eventually drew the line when it came to romance
and prospective girlfriends mixing them up.
"The way we solved this was to give each other
space," said Peter. "If we told each other \ye were
interested in some girl, under all circumstances
when we saw them we would have to run the other
way and avoid being seen. We were never to start
up any real conversation." j
The Watson sisters capitalize on thr fact that
their voices sound so similar.
During boring conversations. Gwen explained,
"we'll just switch the phone back and forth. At the
end. we'd tell our friends,'By the way. you talked
to both of us!"'
Sometimes the similarity backfired. "In my
freshman dorm." Gwen said."Margo would come
over and people would think I was talking to my
self because we have the same voice."
Ultimately, being a twin has a lot to do with how
you approach it.
"Being a twin is kind of like a marriage that
you're born into," theorized Gwen Watson. "You
have the choice to divorce each other and never talk,
or embrace the connection and find strength in it."
It seems that twins overwhelmingly choose the
latter.
"I'm not always sure about things in my life."
said Margo Watson."But something I'm sure about
is that [Gwen | will always be a part of my life."
The same goes for the Yu brothers, who keep in
touch across the country. Joked Peter. "Like they
say in the old Chinese idiom, two chopsticks togeth
er are harder to break than one ehopstick alone."

Admit it. If you've seen "The Parent Trap" or
"It Takes Two," you've had this dreanv. You go
away for the summer, where you encounter some
one who looks and talks like you do. Before long,
you realize you have a twin you never knew about.
For Deborah and Denise Sohn '09, waking up
and looking across the room at their mirror image
isn't a dream. They've lived together their whole
lives and now share not only DNA but also a room
in Freshman-Sophomore College (FroSoCo).
According to the National Center for Health
Statistics. 3.1 percent of births in the U.S. are twin
births. The Stanford Undergraduate Admissions
Office does not collect specific data on twin admis
sion or enrollment, but a small population of Stan
ford students are also one of two. including the
Lopez twins — Brook and Robin '10 — who have
made headlines this year as starters on the men's
basketball team.
Twins at Stanford say they have to balance their
separate identities with the close bond they have
formed with their twin.
Owen and Margo Watson '09 initially wanted to
go to different colleges.
"We wanted to go to different schools so we'd
have a chance to develop as two separate people,"
said Margo. "We never want to become Gwen
and-Margo."
Gwen and Margo said they grew up as a unit,
the Watson girls, and both wanted to escape this
mentality at college.
Gwen even wrote her application essay about
finding herself separate from her sister. Originally,
each twin had different preferences for schools —
except for Stanford, a top choice for both. Neither
anticipated both of them getting accepted. Even
when they did. they still deliberated before they each
made the independent decision to come to Stanford.
For the Sohn sisters, going to Stanford together
just fell into place. But Denise and Deborah had
n't necessarily planned on going to college togeth
er. much less rooming together.
"We knew we wanted to be on the same coast.
We wanted to live within hours of each other,"
Denise said. Stanford happened to be both of their
first choices, and they both got in.
While they lived in different houses of FroSo-
Co as freshmen, they turned to each other as
roommates this year because, as Deborah ex
plained. "We're just really compatible."
ITie twins,for example, share a passion for clas-

sics, which both plan as a first major
They plan on having separate dou
hie majors.

"The best part about being a twin
is always having a friend around." said

Denise."lt's good to have someone in col
lege that knows your background."

Some, however, come to Stanford and find
themselves apart from their twins for the first
time in their life.
Andee Nos'o9is across the country from her
fraternal twin Laura, who attends Mt. Holyoke
College in Massachusetts. Partly due to different
personalities — Andee was the outgoing athlete.
Laura the more reserved dancer — the twins
knew from the get-go that they wanted to look at
different colleges.
"We didn't really mean to separate this far."
Andee admitted. "But we talk on the phone at
least ever>' other day. so it doesn't always feel like
we're so far away. I don't think we'd see each other
much more if I was on the East Coast."
Laura visited Andee once last year, and Andee
went out to Mt. I lolyoke last spring break. Andee
considered the trips beneficial.
"It's harder in some ways [to attend different
schools] because I don't always know what or who
Laura is talking about." Andee said."But w<. got to
meet each other's close group of friends, an J we've
had a chance to not necessarily'gain approval,' but
to know what's going on."
Separation can also happen to twins after col
lege, as it did for alumni Peter and Allen Yu '05.
founders of a Stanford Twins Facebook group.
Peter now works in San Francisco while Allen is in
New York. However,the brothers remain close and
have collaborative projects together on the side.
After graduation, Claire and Julia Calzonetti
"05 decided to live and work in New York togeth
er. At Stanford, they were both recruited for the
Cardinal lacrosse team, an advantage on the field
in that opposing teams often got them confused.
But it got tricky in other situations.
"One time a girl said Mi' to me that Claire
knew through her thesis seminar," recalled Julia. "I
figured that would be that and we'd go on our own
