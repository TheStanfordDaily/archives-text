## Editorial Board Expand news readership program 
### 
Ot all the services available to students
at the University, few compare in
value to the Stanford News Reader
ship Program (SNRP), the organization re
sponsible for facilitating the delivery of 375
copies of The New York Times and 600
copies of ITie San Jose Mercury News to
campus every weekday.
For only four dollars per person in annu
al special fees, Stanford students get access
to two high-quality newspapers for which
many would not pay standard newsstand
prices. Since its inception in 2002.SNRP has
proven overwhelmingly popular. The com
bined offering of the country's newspaper of
record along with a well-respected regional
publication seems to have struck a chord
among students. Of the nearly 1.000 news
papers distributed to over 20 locations
throughout campus.only a scant few remain
untouched each day. Further,SNßP is reim
bursed for unused papers, thus allowing the
program to curb frivolous spending.
Complaints about SNRP have been few
and far between, and many students derive
far more satisfaction from the papers than
the four dollars in special fees they pay. If
bursting the Stanford bubble is a worthy
goal, we can think of few means more con
ducive to that end than providing two out
standing newspapers at bargain cost. As
SNRP nears its fifth anniversary, we ap
plaud this valuable program for delivering
an exceptional product that is enjoyed by a
wide segment of the student population.
But good is the enemy of great, and. as
with any organization, it might behoove
SNRP to review its practices from time to
time. Special fees for SNRP were approved

by the Graduate Student Council (GSC)
last week by only a razor-thin margin, as
GSC members cited concerns that TTie
limes and Mercury News were using the
program to increase their own readership
bases.
We find this argument unconvincing.
Surely, the enjoyment of students who read
The Times and Mercury News outweighs
any qualms about the publications' motives.
Further, these newspapers were originally
selected for the program in large part be
cause of the low prices at which they are of
fered — currently. 40 and 36 cents per copy
ofTheTimesand Mercury News, respective
ly. We have little reason to think that SNRP
would not consider a lower offer from a
publication of similar quality it such an offer
were advanced.
A more worthwhile undertaking might
be for SNRP to review its distribution loca
tions. According to its president,The Times
and Mercury News are distributed at 21 lo
cations on campus, evenly divided between
areas commonly frequented by graduate
and undergraduates. Some students have
lamented the absence of a distribution site
on the Row (the closest distribution site is at
Braun Music Building), and these claims
merit consideration. If nothing else, frustrat
ed residents of Row houses deserve to know
why the hub of residential campus activity
has no distribution site.
Beyond the relatively minor concern of
distribution sites, the valuable product pro
vided by SNRP leaves little to be desired.
We hope that Stanford students will contin
ue to enjoy its far-reaching benefits well into
the future.
