I hate Magic Realism. Now, while I'm
usually loathe to dismiss entire literary
movements (not least because I'm not
really qualified to have an opinion), I find
that sweeping generalizations are more en
tertaining than tempered arguments.
Still, despite my preference for total con
demnation. I suppose it's only fair to be a lit
tle more specific. For the uninitiated. Magic
Realism is a broad literary movement (with
ill-defined boundaries) focused on winning
as many book prizes as necessary.
Of course, for the initiated it's a little dif
ferent: they think the movement is all
about incorporating magical elements into
otherwise "realistic" settings. Now, once
you get past the absurdity of pretending
that the events in novels even remotely re
semble reality, this isn't so bad. The effect
can be sort of soothing, like a fairytale for
grownups.
In fact, if the genre had no consequences
beyond its existence as a mode of expres
sion. my ire would be. well. gone. The prob
lem. however, is not the content: it's the in
vidious spread.
Like many initially successful ideas, it's
the numerous iterations that irritate. Every
time I step into Kepler's. I find a new seri

ous-looking tome revolving around "love"
and/or "mysticism" which takes place in a
far-off land where they speak a different
language.
Hie plots of these masterpieces are curi
ously interchangeable. Invariably, there's
the protagonist who is either half of a pair of
star-crossed lovers or trapped in a strange
environment.
After setting the scene, the story pro
ceeds through a series of evocative descrip
tions comparing the metaphorical equiva
lents of apples and oranges, each designed
to keep the boundary between fictional re
ality and fictional fiction blurred.
Eventually, after nothing has happened
for several hundred pages, the reader is left
