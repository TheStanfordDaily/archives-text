I hate Magic Realism. Now, while I'm
usually loathe to dismiss entire literary
movements (not least because I'm not
really qualified to have an opinion), I find
that sweeping generalizations are more en
tertaining than tempered arguments.
Still, despite my preference for total con
demnation. I suppose it's only fair to be a lit
tle more specific. For the uninitiated. Magic
Realism is a broad literary movement (with
ill-defined boundaries) focused on winning
as many book prizes as necessary.
Of course, for the initiated it's a little dif
ferent: they think the movement is all
about incorporating magical elements into
otherwise "realistic" settings. Now, once
you get past the absurdity of pretending
that the events in novels even remotely re
semble reality, this isn't so bad. The effect
can be sort of soothing, like a fairytale for
grownups.
In fact, if the genre had no consequences
beyond its existence as a mode of expres
sion. my ire would be. well. gone. The prob
lem. however, is not the content: it's the in
vidious spread.
Like many initially successful ideas, it's
the numerous iterations that irritate. Every
time I step into Kepler's. I find a new seri

ous-looking tome revolving around "love"
and/or "mysticism" which takes place in a
far-off land where they speak a different
language.
Hie plots of these masterpieces are curi
ously interchangeable. Invariably, there's
the protagonist who is either half of a pair of
star-crossed lovers or trapped in a strange
environment.
After setting the scene, the story pro
ceeds through a series of evocative descrip
tions comparing the metaphorical equiva
lents of apples and oranges, each designed
to keep the boundary between fictional re
ality and fictional fiction blurred.
Eventually, after nothing has happened
for several hundred pages, the reader is left

with a deliberately ambiguous, inde
cipherable ending. And, voila! Next
stop —feting by the literary press
and college students everywhere,
moving swiftly onto the inevitable
prize ceremony.
Actually, it's not just the incredi
ble intellectual laziness of the read
ership that gets to me. Or the tedious,
formulaic plot devices. Or even the
fact that genuine talent can devote
itself to following the herd. No.
there's more.
Personally, what I find especially
troublesome is the romantic vision
of foreign lands peddled by the
magic realist — romantic visions
which many of you take a little too
seriously.
The world isn't described by ro
mance and magic. This is not to say
that romance and magic don't exist
(they don't, but your delusions are
your own business), but, rather, that
life is a little more complex.
It's tempting to assume that a hil
lion-plus subcontinentals can be

summed up by "Midnight's Chil
dren'' or "The God of Small ITiings"
or "The Namesake." but, with just
the slightest application of thought,
it should be obvious that this isn't the
case.
Garcia Marquez is inordinately
talented. "One Hundred Years of
Solitude" is very good. "Love in the
lime of Cholera" is brilliant. "Of
Love and Other Demons" is one of
the most beautiful things I've read.
I lowever, this is just not the real-life
version of South America.
Beautiful fiction that plays out
the same ideas over and over again is
damaged by an effective lack of con
text. Without exposure to the other
aspects of a culture, we are seduced
by the romance and facility of a sim
ple and unadorned worldview.
Many have a tendency to deny
other societies the complexity and
the variety we acknowledge in our
own. People don't do it just to deni
grate, but also to praise: "Aren't
those Indians just wonderful? So
spiritual and in touch with karma.
Such noble faith, and what a mystical
country. If only we could be like
that."
To be completely fair. I should
point out that said tendency is a uni

versal human trait, not just one that
arises when dealing with different
folk. Everyone is convinced that the
briefest familiarity with a subject is
enough to make them an expert. A
well-placed article in The New York
l imes is enough to fill the chattering
classes with specialists in whatever
obscure subject got an airing.
Still, this blase confidence is
somehow more annoying when it's
applied to culture or ethnicity. Some
one laboring under the misconcep
tion that they understand String The
ory after reading The Science Times
is less bothersome than the hoards
who believe that a few dozen Magic
Realist novels sum up the culture of
billions.
Literature and its ilk (art, music,
film) should be at the vanguard of
the fight against the march to a
world of stereotypes. Not only is this
not the case, but what should be the
solution is, instead, part of the prob
lem.

Incidentally, particular examples of
lazy, weak and unimaginative prize
winning, well-written Magic Realism
include the "Life of Pi" and the "In
heritance of Loss." Email
