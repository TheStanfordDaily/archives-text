# Wading through a winter weatherland
## 
### 
// April show ers bring May flowers, what
do February downpours bring?
As I slogged across campus this week,
rivers streaming down my Goretex
raincoat, the bottom six inches of my
favorite jeans converted to five-pound
ankle braces, feet soaked through my an
cient Jack Purcells (I live off-campus and
was born in don't ask why I didn't
think to wear boots or trendier footwear), I
was reminded of the famous adage: when
the going gets wet, the wet get going.
And by going. I mean fantasizing about
spring break, of course.
Yes. its a hard knock life we live here in
Palo Alto. Two thirds of the academic year,
we ;ire forced to coast downhill to class, both
ways, through the sunshine and dazzling
blue sky. Ilien. just as we load up on course
work and our post-June options narrow, the
weather gods decide to wreak havoc on our
physical and mental health.
Forget Petri dishes and test tubes; col
lege campuses and the students crammed in
to their tight living quarters offer phenom
enal research opportunities for exploring
the transmittance of viral illness. Factor in
the combination of near-constant moisture
and sub-ft() temperatures (bike, board, or
segue, you're going to be soaked and cold

by the time you make it to the Quad's cov
ered walkways), and you end up with an
epidemic that upstages the mono-sated
weeks following Full Moon on the Quad.
It's a wonder the CDC hasn't shut us down
yet.
Even if you are well enough to leave your
dorm room, the physical consequences of
the inclement weather are impossible to ig
nore. Unlike our East Coast brethren,
whose frosty weather comes with the excit
ing benefits of winter sports and unplanned
vacation days, we get one memorable (or
not-so-memorable, as the case may be)
weekend in the overstuffed chalet of an un
suspecting Tahoe homeowner. For the rest
of the season, Stanford sports enthusiasts
must choose between hiking up and down
the Ming Wing stairwells, lugging the afore-


Mendelman
Pearls of wisdom
mentioned ankle-weights across
campus, and sprinting to the Moon-
Bean's overhang to purchase the
next hot beverage.
Speaking of athletic activity and
our blizzard-blessed friends east of
the Rockies, there is yet another
arena in which we are decidedly
worse off than they: biking through
snow would be much easier. Snow
doesn't spray (although I bet the
Texan from my freshman dorm
thought it would; as the first of our
two 40-person buses pulled in to the
driveway of our 12-person ski cabin,
Ms. Simpson was shocked to learn
that snow does not fall in pre-formed
balls).
As any Psych I student will con
firm. however, the endorphin-crip
pling impact of shorter, darker days
and inclement winter weather ex
tends beyond physical health. Even

the happiest of un-seasonally-affect
ed Stanford ducklings face a host of
emotional challenges over the
course of these trying 10 weeks.
Freshmen are no longer new (upset
ting both themselves and their
sketchy upper-class predators);
sophomores have hit their infamous
slump (and those that haven't feel
guilty for their inexplicable content
ment): at least a third of the junior
class is off gallivanting at the Bings'
expense, leaving abandoned friends
and spurned non-foreign lovers be
hind: and seniors are perpetually be
hind in their theses (1 feel you on
that one).
To make matters worse, you've
drained your residence of every last
ounce of sexual tension and those
once-intriguing/exciting/resume
building new extracurriculars you
joined back in September have lost
their shine (although the five active
members continue to spam the list
on a regular basis).
Of course, as with all mental
health issues, some people deal
with the depressing reality by refus

ing to acknowledge that it is. in fact,
the dead of winter. Sporting flip
flops and oversize Chanel sunglass
es, these students beg the professor
to hold class outdoors even as the
dark grey sky threatens to split
open and drop buckets. Denial is
not just a river in Egypt; in certain
cases.it may also result in hypother
mia.
All joking aside, though, there is
at least one healthy response to the
woebegone winter weather: em
brace it. Perhaps with enough rain
and a nice pair of rose-colored glass
es, Lake Lag will appear half full in
stead of all mud. If not. try to content
yourself with a swim in the only real
body of water on campus, Avery
Aquatic Center, and the knowledge
that the warm weather will return in
all its sun-drenched glory just in time
for dead week.

Assuming she hasn 7 caught a cold yet,
Lisa Mendelnian is out running in the
rain. Entail her at lisame
@stanford.edu and she'll respond as
soon as her frostbitten fingers thaw.
