# Personality not required to take personality tests
## 
### 
Personality tests are the bane of human
existence. 1 can think of no greater evil
than assuring boring people that they
have a personality. (Correction: Genocide
and rape are greater evils. But this is outside
the scope of today's discussion.) Millions of
people take personality tests online or in
class or wherever. At the end. every single
test-taker is given a short description of her
"personality type" to reward her efforts.
This system validates tedious existences
the world over. and. in essence, spreads a
bland mush of self-validation across our soci
ety. Dull people everywhere can cling to a sci
entific-sounding blurb about who they are
and use it as proof that they are fascinating
pools of complexity and nuance.
Is it too much to say that some people do
not deserve results from such a test? I think
not. Think about that girl from your IHUM
section.The one whom, when you close your
eyes and think about her. you can't remember
anything that would distinguish her from a
bag of sand. Although she contributes noth

ing to this world, she has a personality accord
ing to Meyers-Briggs. She is an INFJ person
ality type.
Think about that guy in your house. The
worthless, boring one. If you had to choose to
spend the rest of your life with either him or
a packet of ketchup, you would choose the
ketchup. Because you could at least read the
label on the packet and be entertained for
the 15 seconds it took to do so. According to
the Enneagram Duniho test, he too has a per
sonality. He is a type 5.
Big-name companies, particularly invest
ment banking firms, often make their em

ployees take personality tests as a part of the
managerial process.This is especially danger
ous considering that the types of people who
work at these firms are often the most skull
achingly insipid individuals 1 have ever met.
(Carly Posner and Andrew Haller are no
table exceptions to this observation.)
A valid personality test should inform the
test-taker if she simply does not have a per
sonality. Think about the immediate and vast
benefit to society that would directly result.
What if someone thought that she was
pretty cool, and then she took an official
sounding test, backed by years of develop
ment and research, only to discover that her
results were muddled .' Instead of being a 5 or
a Synthesist or an ENTP, she was just Boring
or Inconclusive.
What a wonderful world that would be!
The test-taker would immediately feel pres
sure to take a stand on something, develop a
spine, perhaps pursue a hobby or cultivate an

interest. Instead of swaddling herself
in meaningless descriptions of how
sensitive or caring she is, she would
finally have to face the fact that her
existence is a waste of time and re
sources. Or perhaps she would come
to terms with her lack of personality
and acknowledge that her only vi
able option in society is to follow and
support those who have character
and vision.
As things stand, especially with
our generation, everyone thinks that
she is unique and special. Personali
ty tests, working in devilish tandem
with the Internet, conflate this false
belief to inexcusable levels.This situ
ation is most achingly dire with the
socio-economically elite.Think of all
the people you know who fill their

lives with objects and possessions as
a way to avoid actually achieving
personal expertise or depth. Case in
point: 1 once heard of a Stanford stu
dent who flew to Paris for lunch be
cause, "DUH! Oh-my-God-who
wouldn't-want-to-fly-to-Paris-for-
lunch?!"
Ibis isdisgusting.lliink about how
much money and time that man
wench's parents had to put in at the of
fice so their son could squander their
money on a senseless, cross-Atlantic
joyride. Here is someone who has had
every opportunity and advantage to
be interesting and nuanced. I le could
have spent that money to pay for
music lessons or art supplies or books.
Perhaps his actions even could have
been excusable if there were one par
ticular restaurant in Paris that was so
legendary among the culinary elite
that he simply had to go there to expe
rience it for himself.
But to be in a position of extreme
advantage, as many boring students

at Stanford find themselves, and to
fritter away such an opportunity on
senseless acts of hedonism is per
verse. There should he a special re
sult on personality tests that shames
fetid lumps of human uselessness
into using their resources to some
how better themselves or the world
around them.
In addition to the previously sug
gested personality result of Boring,
there should also he a result of Not
Only Boring But Vapid and Wasteful.
Imagine if someone received that
outcome in Professor Clough's fa
mous CEE 147 class. 1 really think
that it would genuinely help her to
understand who she is and how she
could better herself through interac
tions with other people. Which, ulti
mately. is the point of a personality
test, no?
