# Personality not required to take personality tests
## 
### 
Personality tests are the bane of human
existence. 1 can think of no greater evil
than assuring boring people that they
have a personality. (Correction: Genocide
and rape are greater evils. But this is outside
the scope of today's discussion.) Millions of
people take personality tests online or in
class or wherever. At the end. every single
test-taker is given a short description of her
"personality type" to reward her efforts.
This system validates tedious existences
the world over. and. in essence, spreads a
bland mush of self-validation across our soci
ety. Dull people everywhere can cling to a sci
entific-sounding blurb about who they are
and use it as proof that they are fascinating
pools of complexity and nuance.
Is it too much to say that some people do
not deserve results from such a test? I think
not. Think about that girl from your IHUM
section.The one whom, when you close your
eyes and think about her. you can't remember
anything that would distinguish her from a
bag of sand. Although she contributes noth

ing to this world, she has a personality accord
ing to Meyers-Briggs. She is an INFJ person
ality type.
Think about that guy in your house. The
worthless, boring one. If you had to choose to
spend the rest of your life with either him or
a packet of ketchup, you would choose the
ketchup. Because you could at least read the
label on the packet and be entertained for
the 15 seconds it took to do so. According to
the Enneagram Duniho test, he too has a per
sonality. He is a type 5.
Big-name companies, particularly invest
ment banking firms, often make their em

ployees take personality tests as a part of the
managerial process.This is especially danger
ous considering that the types of people who
work at these firms are often the most skull
achingly insipid individuals 1 have ever met.
(Carly Posner and Andrew Haller are no
table exceptions to this observation.)
A valid personality test should inform the
test-taker if she simply does not have a per
sonality. Think about the immediate and vast
benefit to society that would directly result.
What if someone thought that she was
pretty cool, and then she took an official
sounding test, backed by years of develop
ment and research, only to discover that her
results were muddled .' Instead of being a 5 or
a Synthesist or an ENTP, she was just Boring
or Inconclusive.
What a wonderful world that would be!
The test-taker would immediately feel pres
sure to take a stand on something, develop a
spine, perhaps pursue a hobby or cultivate an
