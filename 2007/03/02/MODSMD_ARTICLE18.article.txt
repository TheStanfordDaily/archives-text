## Green schools for better education 
### JONAS KETTERLE 
All parents want their children to be
healthy and do well in school. Elementary
schools are places of learning where impres
sions and ideas that last a lifetime are
formed. But existing schools are often built
on tight budgets and to the bare-minimum
standard necessary to meet building codes.
Building codes, however, are rarely designed
to enhance the learning environment for
children. A new approach toward building
schools is needed.
A recent study by Greg Rats of Capital E
definitively shows that schools could be
"healthier, more comfortable, and more pro
ductive" by using well-known green building
techniques for an initial cost premium of
under 2%, but with cost savings of twenty
times the cost of going green over the life
time of the school. Building green means de
signing a building so that it is constructed in
an environmentally sensible way, with envi
ronmental criteria as one of the foremost, if
not the top. priority when making design de
cisions. Green buildings considerably reduce
water and energy consumption, and are
healthier for their occupants.
With such exciting numbers and benefits,
why aren't all elementary schools built to
green standards? A 2005 survey by Turner
Construction Company shows that the three

strongest reasons discouraging executives
from building green are 1) higher construc
tion costs, 2) lack of awareness of benefits,
and 3) difficulty of quantifying benefits. So
what exactly are the costs and benefits of
going green, and why are the benefits diffi
cult to quantify?
Examining 30 green schools built in the
last five years provides answers to all three of
our questions. Average national school con
struction cost is $150/ft2, and the typical cost
of greening was an additional $3/ft2,or an ad
ditional 2%. Over time, green schools use
30% less energy and water than convention
al schools. These changes save water and re
duce carbon emissions, and result in direct
savings of $11/ft2 during the life of the
school, which is almost four times the cost of
greening. Despite these direct long-term sav
ings. schools on tight budgets perceive green
as more expensive because of the 2% higher
upfront cost. However, the evidence shows
that greening our elementary schools makes
long-term financial sense.
Green schools also offer numerous com
pelling health benefits for our children. Many
existing schools have poor air quality and
poor environmental quality that detract from
learning. According to the U.S. General Ac
counting Office, over one quarter, or 15 mil
lion.of all students attend schools with below
standard or dangerous air quality. Poor air

quality leads to health ailments that include
elevated cases of asthma, colds, and the flu.
Poor environmental quality leads to slower
learning, lower test scores, and a lack of mo
tivation for both students and teachers. Both
factors combine to retard children's learning
and academic progress, negatively affecting
their future productivity and earning poten
tial. Green schools address these hidden so
cial costs through design targeted to help
children learn.
Clearly, the adverse costs of the existing
building standard for schools are difficult to
quantify because they are social costs. How
ever, a recent compilation of studies on many
of these social costs roughly quantifies the
benefit that green schools have. Ihe social
cost savings of greening schools break down
as follows: increased earnings ($49/ft2), asth
ma reduction ($3/ft2).cold and flu reduction
($5/ft2), teacher retention ($4/ft2), and em
ployment impact ($2/ft2). Additional bene
fits such as reduced climate change impact,
reduced construction and demolition waste,
reduced insurance and risk management, re
duced teacher sick days, and reduced opera
tion and maintenance costs are not even in
cluded in this financial analysis. Addressing
social cost by greening schools offers a large
indirect financial benefit, in addition to ad-
