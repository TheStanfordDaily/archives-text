## Occupation defies social justice 
### AMANDA GELENDER 
I attribute my deep sense of social justice
to my Jewish upbringing. Active in my con
gregation as a child, I have fond memories of
attending Jewish summer camp, Shabbat
services and Purim carnivals. And, of course. I
have perhaps not-so fond memories of study
ing relentlessly for my Haftorah portion and
bat mitzvah ceremony. As a young person. 1
eagerly absorbed Jewish culture and values,
harnessing the lessons of likkun olum, the Ju
daic principle which translates to "repair the
world." As I came of age, I became increasing
ly committed to this principle in my daily life
as an activist for social change.
As a trusting and uninformed child. I
never questioned my exuberant, unequivocal
support for Israel. Looking back on this peri
od of my life, 1 marvel at my own naivete.
After more than a decade of pro-Israeli in
doctrination. it took a long time for me to un
ravel and ultimately rebuild my belief system
in accordance with Jewish values of social jus
tice. Today. I stand in full opposition to the Is

raeli occupation and the plethora of atrocious
human rights violations committed by Israel
and supported by the United States. I believe
that it is my right and responsibility to speak
out against the actions of the Israeli govern
ment — not in spite of being Jewish but be
cause 1 am Jewish.
Jews are uniquely positioned in this con
flict. Chiefly, we as a people have experi
enced an exorbitant amount of oppression
and have always had to fight for recognition,
equality and freedom. Undeniably. Jews
throughout the world still face extreme dis
crimination and struggle for these basic liber
ties. We. of all people, know injustice and the
many ways that it can devastate and even de
stroy the lives of innocent people.
I lowever, our actions — as represented by
the Israeli government — distort the essence
of our core values of peace and social justice.
Israel's despotism has turned Jews into the
very oppressors we have struggled against for
thousands of years. We are killing. We are de
molishing homes. We are denying basic human
rights. I refuse to tolerate the unequivocal en

dorsement of these brutalities to compose the
predominant voice of the Jewish community at
Stanford. A Jewish upbringing informs my sys
tem of values, and I will not betray my notions
of social justice merely because those commit
ting the atrocities are fellow Jews.
Jewish culture embodies the struggle for
peace and equality,selflessness in serving oth
ers ;ind liberation from oppression. The treat
ment of Palestinian people by the Israeli gov
ernment is ethically depraved. It is in direct vi
olation of both internationally recognized
human rights standards and our stated ideals.
No. I do not support acts of Palestinian terror,
and I condemn all forms of violence against
civilians. I lowevcr, these fringe acts of terror
ism in no way justify the horrific actions of
collective punishment and severe repression
perpetrated by the powerful Israeli military
and government. We as Jews are not "repair
ing the world" in Israel and the Occupied Ter
ritories — we are destroying it along with the
integrity of our faith and culture.
