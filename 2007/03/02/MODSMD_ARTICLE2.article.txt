# Dining halls go green
## Dining Director champions energy efficient model 
### JENNIFER LIU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In January, Stanford was one of four universities
nationwide to receive an A- in the first ever college
sustainability report card released by the Sustain
able Endowments Institute. Much of the report fo
cused on the weaker areas of the University's sus
tainability efforts, but the A given to Stanford's ini
tiatives in food and recycling was no great surprise
— especially since sustainability has long been a
core concern for the University's dining services.

During a pre-dinner tour of Wilbur Dining
Hall. Stanford Dining Executive Director Rati
Taherian said the commitment to sustainable din
ing came into clearer focus when the University
began renovating its dining halls nearly a decade
ago — before being "green" became popular, de
spite the economic incentives.
"There's a myth out there that sustainable din
ing increases costs,"Taherian said. "It doesn't. Sus
tainable measures are not cost-inhibitive, and
they're not difficult to implement. Eight or nine
years ago, we looked at the design of our kitchens
and concluded that they weren't efficient, so we
began to consider how to systematically change
them to reflect a new way of thinking about dining."
In the last 10 years, every on-campus dining
hall save one has undergone major renovations.

and the exception, Florence Moore Dining, is due
for its own overhaul in the next couple of years.
A quick look around Wilbur Dining Hall,
which was renovated six years ago, uncovers en
ergy-reducing modifications and improvements
at nearly every turn. 1 ligh-efficiency infrared fry
ers have replaced conventional gas fryers, and
huge kettles run on steam, eliminating both the
cost of gas as well as its by-products.
Wilbur's servery uses evaporative air-cooling
instead of conventional air conditioning, and the
extensive refrigeration mandated by county
health standards has been centralized and com
puterized to cut down on the cost of electricity
and refrigerants.
