# Dining halls go green
## Dining Director champions energy efficient model 
### JENNIFER LIU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In January, Stanford was one of four universities
nationwide to receive an A- in the first ever college
sustainability report card released by the Sustain
able Endowments Institute. Much of the report fo
cused on the weaker areas of the University's sus
tainability efforts, but the A given to Stanford's ini
tiatives in food and recycling was no great surprise
— especially since sustainability has long been a
core concern for the University's dining services.

During a pre-dinner tour of Wilbur Dining
Hall. Stanford Dining Executive Director Rati
Taherian said the commitment to sustainable din
ing came into clearer focus when the University
began renovating its dining halls nearly a decade
ago — before being "green" became popular, de
spite the economic incentives.
"There's a myth out there that sustainable din
ing increases costs,"Taherian said. "It doesn't. Sus
tainable measures are not cost-inhibitive, and
they're not difficult to implement. Eight or nine
years ago, we looked at the design of our kitchens
and concluded that they weren't efficient, so we
began to consider how to systematically change
them to reflect a new way of thinking about dining."
In the last 10 years, every on-campus dining
hall save one has undergone major renovations.

and the exception, Florence Moore Dining, is due
for its own overhaul in the next couple of years.
A quick look around Wilbur Dining Hall,
which was renovated six years ago, uncovers en
ergy-reducing modifications and improvements
at nearly every turn. 1 ligh-efficiency infrared fry
ers have replaced conventional gas fryers, and
huge kettles run on steam, eliminating both the
cost of gas as well as its by-products.
Wilbur's servery uses evaporative air-cooling
instead of conventional air conditioning, and the
extensive refrigeration mandated by county
health standards has been centralized and com
puterized to cut down on the cost of electricity
and refrigerants.

"People thought we were crazy
when we redesigned these kitchens,"
laherian said. "Now it's popular to
be sustainable. But it's also a good
business model — sustainable din
ing ultimately reduces the costs of
operation."
Stanford was certified as a Santa
Clara County Green Business in
2004 in recognition of its voluntary
environmental responsibility. Ac
cording to the Green Business Web
site, participants in the program
must comply with all applicable en
vironmental regulations and "meet
program standards for preserving re
sources, preventing pollution and
minimizing waste." In its efforts to
do so, Stanford Dining also follows
the "SR" recycling program of the
on-campus Peninsula Sanitary Ser
vice, Inc. (PSSI): reduce, reuse, recy
cled, buy recycled and rot.
"Being sustainable isn't just about
renewable resources," Taherian said.
"It requites the consideration of an
efficient design and culture."
These designs include labor-sav
ing and trash-reducing initiatives as
well — projects Taherian demon
strated by planting himself at one of

the Wilbur kitchen's hulking dish
washing stations.The towering metal
structures allow dining employees to
receive trays from the conveyer and
sort the tableware without moving
from their positions.
Since all dishes are ultimately san
itized, Taherian said, they are first
processed in a system that uses recy
cled and recirculated water to rinse off
the leftovers destined for the compost
pile. None of the food served in Stan
ford dining halls is non-compostable.
and the company that Stanford Din
ing has contracted to sell its compost
to local farmers accepts all biodegrad
able waste, including table napkins.
Other biodegradables have
proven trickier to integrate. Less
than five years ago, green service
ware was a risky proposition: not
only was it more expensive, but the
bottoms of plates and containers
were prone to melting or falling out
at the required high temperatures.
Although Stanford Catering cur
rently offers biodegradable service
ware as a no-additional-charge op
tion and biodegradable containers
for cold food are available at various
dining halls. Lakeside's Late Nite
and Stern's Cyber Cafe have yet to
adopt biodegradable takeout con
tainers. Current takeout containers
are recyclable, however, and are
made with recycled materials.
"In general,we follow the PSSI rec

ommendation," said Kate Roessler,
project coordinator for Stanford Din
ing. "The immediate objective is to
avoid contributing to landfills."
Sustainability is a continuing
process, Taherian said, and one con
tinually being tweaked. Napkin hold
ers. for example, must be placed
strategically. According to Taherian,
students used to grab handfuls of nap
kins on their way out of the servery,
but napkin use has been "dramatical
ly" reduced since the holders were re
located to the dining tables.
Although the College Sustainabil
ity Report Card claimed that 2 to 4
percent of Stanford Dining's menu is
from "local, organic sources," officials
said that percentage has increased
since the report was published.
Next week, Stanford Dining will
hold the "Eat Local Celebration," a
week-long event that will feature
local farmers and student gardeners
who will discuss how local food is yet
another aspect of sustainability.
On the way out of the Wilbur
Marketplace, Roessler pointed out
that the table tents used to be refilled
with new announcement tliers every
few days. They are now replaced bi
weekly with a single sheet announc
ing several events — "To save
paper," Roessler said, "of course."

Sustainability is a continuing
process, Taherian said, and one con
tinually being tweaked. Napkin hold
ers. for example, must be placed
strategically. According to Taherian,
students used to grab handfuls of nap

located to the dining tables.
Although the College Sustainabil
ity Report Card claimed that 2 to 4
percent of Stanford Dining's menu is
from "local, organic sources," officials
said that percentage has increased
since the report was published.
Next week, Stanford Dining will
hold the "Eat Local Celebration," a
week-long event that will feature
local farmers and student gardeners
who will discuss how local food is yet
another aspect of sustainability.
On the way out of the Wilbur
Marketplace, Roessler pointed out
that the table tents used to be refilled
with new announcement tliers every
few days. They are now replaced bi
weekly with a single sheet announc
ing several events — "To save
paper," Roessler said, "of course."
