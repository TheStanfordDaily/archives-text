## CARD READY TO ROLL Women's hoops aims to claim Pac-10 title 
### HALEY MURPHY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Looking back, the women's bas
ketball team's march to yet another
top Pacific-10 Conference record and
first seed in the conference's postsea
son tournament was nothing short of
impressive. The No. 7 Cardinal (25-4.
17-1 Pac-10) dominated its conference
opponents, survived games without
key players and rebounded from early
losses with apparent ease.
Junior guard Cissy Pierce remem
bered matchups with Arizona State
and Oregon State as significant victo
ries for Stanford.
"Beating Arizona State [away] was
definitely a highlight." she said. "I
think we had two posts foul out and
tied it and went into overtime. It was a
great win in a hostile environment.
Then coming from behind against
Oregon State and beating them twice
were big highlights."
But the members of the Cardinal
squad do not plan to begin reminiscing
any time soon. ITiis weekend brings
the start of the Pac-10 Tournament, an
event that the team has been looking
forward to for some time. Pierce em
phasized the excitement and the
change of pace that the postseason
brings.
"The tournament time is just fun."
Pierce said. "It's a whole different at
mosphere. You can just feel it. It's win
or go home, [so] every team you play
wants to win. and every game is just
that much better."
The desire to win will be especially
great among Pac-10 rivals this year.
Only No. 25 California stole a win
from Stanford during the regular sea

son. allowing the Cardinal to remain a
target for everyone in the conference.
Pierce said that it was for this rea
son that head coach Tara VanDerveer
has been finding different ways to mo
tivate her players.
"[She] passed an article around the
team about how Arizona State has
been picked to win the Pac-lOTourna
ment because they're mad that we
beat them twice," Pierce said. "So,
there's definitely a pride issue with the
other teams. They want to come in.
and they want to beat us. Tara [Van-
Derveer] told us that the other teams
want to think that they're hungrier
than us, but we just have to go in and
want it more than them."
In Saturday's. 4 ) p.m.game at the HP
Pavilion in San Jose, Stanford will play
the winner of Oregon State and Ari
zona, both of whom the Cardinal de
feated by 10 points or more in every
one of their regular season meetings.
Oregon State is led by guard Casey
Nash (20.3 points per game) and for
ward Judie Lomax (11.0 points. 7.7 re
bounds per game) while Arizona is led
by guards Joy Hollingsworth (16.4
points) and Ashley Whisonant (11.3
points, 108 assists on the season).
Though Stanford's front court should
easily control things, the strongguards
at the helm for the opposition could
prove to be an added challenge for the
Cardinal with the shaky status of jun
ior Candice Wiggins' injured ham
string.
Pierce was hopeful that Wiggins
would return in time for the tourna
ment. but she could offer little certain
ty regarding her teammate's medical
situation.
"Obviouslv, we're a different team

without [Wiggins] on the floor," Pierce
said. "We're not as good of a shooting
team, and 1 think that the whole team
is more comfortable when she's out
there. She gives everyone else more
confidence and just inspires hard play
among the team, so it'll be a good
thing to have her back."
But regardless of whether or not
Wiggins appears in the opening
round. Stanford's other All-Pac-10 se
lection. senior Brooke Smith,and Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year Jayne Appel
will have the support of Pierce and the
rest of the Cardinal's deep lineup.
Pierce said that the team will main
tain its focus on distribution and
shared responsibility in anticipation of
the competitive nature of the postsea
son.
"Since we beat every other team, they
come fired up to beat us." Pierce said.
"The competition is better during the
Pac-lOTournament â€” the postseason
is just fun."
And so, with hardly a glance at the
season that's now behind it. Stanford
continues its march into March.

pensate in the absence of guard Candice Wiggins. After being honored
