# TOP FIVE THINGS TO WATCH
## 
### 
1. Balancing Act
Over the course of the season, seven different
Cardinal players have led the team in scoring for
an individual game. Three of those players, Can
dice Wiggins, Brooke Smith and Jayne Appel,
average more than 13 points per game on the
season. It is this versatile scoring ability that will
allow Stanford to continue to be difficult for op
ponents to defend in the postseason.

2. Frontcourt Forerunners
Stanford's greatest depth comes in the form of its
deep rotation of forwards. Smith and Appel com
bine with Kristen Newlin, Jillian Harmon, Michelle
Harrison and others to provide power in the paint.
The Card must maintain its offensive dominance
and overwhelming rebounding to stay alive in
tournament play.

3, Wondering About
Wiggins
Although it is currently unclear when Wiggins will be
healthy enough to play, her return will "give everyone
more confidence," according to junior guard Cissy
Pierce. Wiggins provides offensive stability, particu
larly as the team's leading three-point shooter (42.7
percent), as well as a strong defensive presence.

4. Putting Up Their Guards
Regardless of Stanford's first-round opponent this
weekend, it will meet a team whose primary
strength lies in its backcourt. Whether Casey Nash
(20.3 points per game) or Joy Hollingsworth (16.8
points) lines up against the Cardinal guards, ball se
curity and solid defense will be of utmost impor
tance.

5. Fantastic Freshmen
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year Jayne Appel and fel
low freshmen Michelle Harrison and Melanie Mur
phy have made outstanding contributions
throughout the regular season. However, the fresh
men must not be intimidated by tournament play
and continue to produce if Stanford is to succeed.
