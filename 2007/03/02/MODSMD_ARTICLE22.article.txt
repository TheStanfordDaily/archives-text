Sadly, tomorrow's slew of games
concludes the regular season of
Pacific-10 Conference basket
hall. I don't hesitate to use the word
"sadly," because, well, I am sad. This
was one of the best years in recent
memory for a much maligned confer
ence.
With all this said. I decided to
write my own little capsule of the
Pac-10 season.just in case you missed
it the first time around. A little "Year
in Review, with all the stories.shock
ers and developments that the best
(or at least my favorite) conference
in college basketball experienced.
Wazzu? What?
There wasn't any more of a com
pelling story in the Pac-10 than the
emergence of the Washington State
Cougars as a legitimate Pacific
power. Wazzu, a team that was picked
to finish seventh in the conference,
has done nothing but make believers
out of people this whole season.
You don't have to look any farther
than the polls, where the Cougars cur
rently reside in the top 15. First-year
coach Tony Bennett will undoubtedly
capture the honor of Pac-10 Coach of


Salisbury
Above the Rim
the Year, and quite possibly National
Coach of the Year.
Ilie Cougars' rise has been re
markable, especially in a year when
the Pac-10 is as strong as it is.
Whether it is guards Derrick Low or
Kyle Weaver getting the job done is
rather irrelevant. Wazzu plays stifling
defense for 40 minutes, they're ex
tremely disciplined on the offensive
side of the ball and they simply know
how to win. Props to Bennett for
doing such a great job: he clearly has
n't left his heart anywhere (I know. 1
know. I just couldn't resist).
Brewin' something special in West
wood
Despite the remarkable emer
gence of the Cougars both on a re
gional and national level, there isn't a
question about the best team in the
conference. With this season's re
sults. UCLA made the statement
that its run to last year's NCAA
Championships was not a fluke.The
Bruins clinched a share of the regu
lar-season title last weekend when
they defeated Stanford.pushing their
conference record to 14-2.
Although the Bruins have had
their share of close games, and even
losses (will anyone ever forget the
loss they suffered on Jan. 28?) they
were able to reassert themselves as
the West Coast's premier power.
The offense has been solid, and
the defense is 1 lowlandesque: Aaron
Afflalo and Darren Collison are the
best defensive players in the country
at their respective positions. That's
right. 1 didn't even throw in "ar
guably.' They are just that good.
The Bruins are currently ranked
second in the nation and don't seem
to be going anywhere; there isn't a
single senior on the team as Ben
Rowland's squad awaits the arrival

of super-recruit Kevin Love.
The Brothers Lopez: Two really big
guys
I've got to admit that 1 was a little
bit skeptical of the Lopez twins be
fore the season started. I mean, two
7-foot twins, on the same team?
Things worked well with the Collins
brothers, of course, but all of this
seemed too good to be true.
Suffice it to say that I was thor
oughly convinced after Brook's dom
inating performance against South
ern California, in which he garnered
the first triple-double in the history of
Stanford basketball. 18 points, 12 re
bounds and 11 blocks? Are you kid
ding me? I'm pretty sure that USC's
Taj Gibson ended up in a mental
ward somewhere with recurring
nightmares of block after block at the
enormous hands of Brook Lopez.
Aside from Brook's career per
formance against the Trojans, the
twins have played a huge role in the
Cardinal's success this year.
'Ilie sky is the limit for these guys.
1 just hope that they both stay four
years. Brook's silky smooth shooting
touch will have pro scouts knocking
on his door in no time.
The Deep Pacific
Last, but not least, my final story
for the Pac-10 is the conference itself.
More than anything else, the stand
out feature of the conference is its
depth. There really aren't any
pushovers. Just ask then-third-place
USC, who lost to a winless Arizona
State team two weekends ago.
A testament to its depth, the con
ference will most likely send six
teams to the tournament; it's been
years since this happened.
It's been a great year for basket
ball in the Pac-10. These four points
don't do justice to the conference,but
I did my best.

Jock Salisbury doesn V know what's so
"Big" about the Big East, Big 10 or
Big 12. Let him know at jack24@stan
ford.edu.
