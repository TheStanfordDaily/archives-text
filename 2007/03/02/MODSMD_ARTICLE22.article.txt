Sadly, tomorrow's slew of games
concludes the regular season of
Pacific-10 Conference basket
hall. I don't hesitate to use the word
"sadly," because, well, I am sad. This
was one of the best years in recent
memory for a much maligned confer
ence.
With all this said. I decided to
write my own little capsule of the
Pac-10 season.just in case you missed
it the first time around. A little "Year
in Review, with all the stories.shock
ers and developments that the best
(or at least my favorite) conference
in college basketball experienced.
Wazzu? What?
There wasn't any more of a com
pelling story in the Pac-10 than the
emergence of the Washington State
Cougars as a legitimate Pacific
power. Wazzu, a team that was picked
to finish seventh in the conference,
has done nothing but make believers
out of people this whole season.
You don't have to look any farther
than the polls, where the Cougars cur
rently reside in the top 15. First-year
coach Tony Bennett will undoubtedly
capture the honor of Pac-10 Coach of


Salisbury
