Every red-blooded Stanford fan
grows to hate Cal after he gets to the
Farm. Some have years of experience
cheering against the Bears even he

New Student Orientation.
But Menlo Park native Ryan Sea
wall is one of the rare few who were

the career wins list.
"Really?" Marquess asked base
ball Sports Information Director
Kyle Mcßae when told of the news.

"What does that mean?"
"Kyle, tells me if it's important or
not," Marquess added jokingly.
After stumbling to a 2-5 start.
Stanford has rebounded with five
straight wins, four of them coming at
Sunken Diamond. But this streak
