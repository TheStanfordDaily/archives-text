### BLAIR CRITCHLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Every red-blooded Stanford fan
grows to hate Cal after he gets to the
Farm. Some have years of experience
cheering against the Bears even he
fore they arrive for their first day of
New Student Orientation.
But Menlo Park native Ryan Sea
wall is one of the rare few who were
literally born to take an active part in
the rivalry.
"Both my parents went to Stan
ford. so I've always hated Cal," Sea
well said. "To me. [the rivalry] might
be a little bit more significant than to
others."
Stanford (7-5) enters this year's
series against California (7-5) with
the potential to make history. The
Cardinal is three wins away from
reaching the 2500 all-time win mark
as a program. Stanford would be the
fifth team in Division-1 history to
reach the milestone, joining South
ern California. Fordham, Michigan
and Texas.

weekend." Seawell said. "Getting
those wins for [head] coach [Mark
Marquess would mean a lot] because
he has done a lot of hard work here."
Marquess is also nearing a per
sonal milestone in the all-time coach
ing ranks. With a series sweep. Mar
quess (1264-622-5) would tie former
Miami coach Ron Fraser for 11th on
the career wins list.
"Really?" Marquess asked base
ball Sports Information Director
Kyle Mcßae when told of the news.

"What does that mean?"
"Kyle, tells me if it's important or
not," Marquess added jokingly.
After stumbling to a 2-5 start.
Stanford has rebounded with five
straight wins, four of them coming at
Sunken Diamond. But this streak
may have more to do with scheduling
than a home-crowd advantage. The
teams Stanford hit the road to play
were No. 11 C'al State-Fullerton and

Born and bred to wear Cardinal red, senior third baseman Ryan Seawell will
take his hacks this weekend against perennial rival California. Seawell had
a huge weekend versus Kansas, going 6 for 1 1 with a homer and three RBI.
No. 22 Texas.
"I don't think it lias to do with
home and away," Seawell said. "I
think it's just that the away teams
we've played away were just better
than the team's we've played here."
In the last two weeks, Stanford has
found two stabilizing forces in the
bullpen with junior David Stringer
and sophomore Max Fearnow.
Stringer (()-(). 2.25) was named to the
College Baseball Foundation's Na
tional Honor Roll this week after
posting saves in four straight games.
Cal (7-7) comes to the Farm after
posting two wins over UC-Santa Bar
bara to rebound from a five game
skid Most impressive is the Bears'
.316 batting average — 30 points bet
ter than Stanford's .280 mark. Lead
ing the California squad are freshman

designated hitter Jeff Kobernus and
transfer David Cooper. Kobernus is
hitting a team-high .471 with a .500 on
base percentage.
A sophomore transfer from Cal
State-Fullerton, Cooper was rated the
ninth-best transfer of the season. I le
has delivered, hitting .444 with four
homeruns and 17 RBI thus far.
"He's one of the best hitters on the
West Coast.," Marquess said of Coop
er. "He doesn't strikeout very much,
hits for power and hits for average."
The Bears' rotation is anchored by
righty Tyson Ross (1-2, 2.60), widely
considered one of the best hurlers in
the conference. Ross will pitch Satur
day against Stanford lefty Jeremy Ble
ich (1-1,5.82).
The Cardinal will change things up
by putting freshman Jeff Inman (1-1.
4.87) on the mound in a series opener
for the first time tonight. First pitch is
slated for 5 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
