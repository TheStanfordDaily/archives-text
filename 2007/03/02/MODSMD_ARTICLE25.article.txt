## Card hope to tumble top-ranked Michigan 
### DANNY BELCH 
After a strong performance last
weekend at the Pacific Coast Clas
sic, the No. 5 men's gymnastics team
(8-1) looks to keep rolling when it
faces Michigan tonight at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion. The Wolverines
(11-3) are currently the top-ranked
team in the nation, but they looked
shaky in what some might consider
a surprising upset last weekend.
Michigan placed fourth in a
meet that featured six teams ranked
in the top 10 nationally while the
Cardinal took second place in an
impressive performance. But Stan
ford knows that beating the
Wolverines twice in one week will
not be an easy task.
Michigan currently holds the
best team-total average score in the
country (218.717) and is ranked
first nationally in the floor exercise
(37.85) and the parallel bars
(37.017). They are also ranked sec
ond nationally in the pommel
horse, still rings and high bar. Like
the Cardinal (2-0), the Wolverines
have a perfect record in dual meets
this season (4-0). Stanford will
counter the Wolverines with top
rankings of its own — the squad is

ranked fourth in the country in the

bar.
The Cardinal's return last week
to a healthy lineup will be short
lived. as two freshmen suffered in
juries early this week during prac
tice routines. Freshman Eric Her
genrader broke his hand and fellow
freshman Lucas Hughes dislocated
his finger. Hughes may still com
pete in three events, but. unfortu
nately. Hergenrader will have to un
dergo season-ending surgery.
"We are disappointed by the in
juries and surrounding circum
stances." senior captain David
Sender said. "But I hope we'll take it
as a challenge to really step up."
Another blow to the Cardinal
came when Sender told the team he
would have to miss the meet due to
an undisclosed circumstance.
I hope the team will rally around
m\ absence and put all they have out
on the floor [tonight]." Sender said.
An interesting factor to consider
is how the meet 's judging may make
the Wolverines more vulnerable.
"The West Coast has been known
for more realistic judging," senior
captain Peter Derman said. "Scores
in the East (Coast] tend to be a bit
more inflated, so when teams from

the Last [Coast] come out here and
see that their scores aren't as high,
they get disappointed."
Stanford trails Michigan in al
most every statistical category per
the rankings, but the Cardinal be
lieves that part of the difference has
to do with the unbalanced judging.
"We are better than our rankings
may indicate," Derman added.
"With more legitimate scoring on
the West Coast and also at the
NCAAs. we are not a team to be
overlooked."
Junior Eli Alcaraz believes that
Stanford can handle the highly tout
ed Wolverines.
"One of our team ideals is that we
go out and do our own gymnastics,"
Alcaraz said. "We may be the under
dogs [versus Michigan], but we are
just off a win against them last week,
and no one on the team expects any
thing less than a repeat."
