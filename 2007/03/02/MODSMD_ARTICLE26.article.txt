## Rivals getting ready to rumble 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
After an exhausting weekend in the desert that result
ed in victories against Arizona and Arizona State, the
members of the Cardinal women's tennis team has an
other challenging lineup of teams to face today and Sat
urday when it faces No. IS Pepperdine and N0.7 Cal.re
spectively. Today's match begins at 1:30 p.m. while Satur
day's match against Cal begins at 2 p.m.
Head coach l.ele lorood reflected on her team's
tough weekend in Arizona.
"In general. Arizona is always a difficult place to
play." she said. " Ibe conditions are always different down

there. It's not an easy place to play. I think we always have
a little bit of struggle [there], no matter what. We're ex
tremely happy to come back with two wins."
Freshman Lindsay Burdette attributed some of the Car
dinal's troubles to the target the team has on its back —
after all. the Cardinal is No.l in the nation.
"We know that when people play us. they're going to
swing from the hip and go all out because they have noth
ing to lose." Burdette said."We were a little bit surprised
at first, but knowing that, we held it together [against the
Arizona schools]."
This past weekend's matches were the second leg of a

GAM! 11 Iff > The Cardinal looks to keep rolling
this afternoon against Pepperdine after returning
home from a succesful swing through Arizona.
Stanford knocked off Arizona State, 4 -3, and Ari

The Stanford women are now primed and ready
to take on the No. 18 Waves today.
grueling three-weekend stretch that
the team has had to endure. Stanford
was first tested by the l.os Angeles
schools (I ( LA and Southern Cali
fornia) two weekends ago. and this
weekend's matches against Pepper

stretch.

and we certainly can't look ahead to

on the first match and not getting
ahead of ourselves."
Hie competition only gets tougher
on Saturday versus archrival C'al.
Although the Cardinal disposed
of the Golden Bears rather easily at
the Team Indoors (Stanford won the
February match. 6-1). things may be
different this time around.
For one. that first match was
played on an indoor surface, whereas
Saturday's match will be played out
doors. The dual match also has a dif
ferent format from February's. Both
of these could easily factor in. Forood
noted.

"1 think that we both have a good
sense of what to expect (from each
other), whereas we had no complete
feeling of what to expect the first time
around." Forood said. ''There are
more known factors for both sides,
which helps both of us, quite frankly."
The Cardinal will also have to con
tend with Cal's No. 1 player, Suzie
Babos, who is the defending NCAA
singles champion.
"On any given day, she's arguably
the best player in the country — she's
dangerous," Forood said.

The Cardinal's match against C'al
also stands out for its rivalry element.
Interestingly enough. C'al features
several foreign players on their team
while Stanford's is completely Amer
ican. a fact that further adds to the ri
valry, according to Burdette.
It's been a tough stretch as of late
for the Card, but they can finish it un
defeated with victories over Pepper
dine and C'al.
'It's the culmination of all of the
matches that we've played so far,"
Burdette said.

Senior Theresa Logar and her teammates know that they will have their hands
full this weekend hosting Pepperdine and California. The Waves nearly upset
the Cardinal in their last meeting a year ago, and Cal's lineup features last
season's top singles player, Suzie Babos.
