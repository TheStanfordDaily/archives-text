the Pacific-10 Conference
lournament set to tip off tonight,
litre is a look at the teams of the Pac
-10, from worst to first.
THE CANNON FODDER
lenth-seeded Washington State (1-
1 7 Pac-10) probably cannot wait for
iliis season to end.The Cougars have
yet to win a contest in 2007 and are
on a 17-game losing streak. The lone
ray of hope: WSU lost to UCLA (its
first-round opponent) by only three
points in their two meetings this year.
THE YEAR TOO SOON
Next year could be when No. 9 tour
nament seed Arizona (4-14) takes
the next step, but this postseason is
too early for the team. Hie Wildcats
improved in the second half of the
year, notching three of their wins, but
they are still a step below the rest of
the conference.
THE PESTS
Eighth-seeded Oregon State (4-14)
might have an ugly record, but the
Beavers lost by double-digits only
five times in the Pac-10 — and four
of those defeats were to Stanford and
Arizona State. Conference scoring
leader and All-Pac-10 team member
Casey Nash (20.1 points per game)
makes them competitive, as they
showed by taking Cal into double
overtime two weeks ago and by
building up two 11-point leads over
Stanford before capitulating in both
games.
THE UNPREDICATBLES
You can never know what you're get
ting with seventh-seeded UCLA (7-
11). The Bruins did give Stanford
and Arizona State tough games re
cently, but those came on the heels of
a loss to Arizona. Senior guard and
All-Pac-10 winner Noelle Quinn (17
points per game, 7.4 rebounds per
game) provides the Bruins' firepow
er, but the teams drops off after her.
To grab their second victory of the
season against Cal in the quarterfi
nals, the Ducks will need to rely on
their conference-best three-point
shooting (36.9 percent).
THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK
Fifth-seededWashington (10-8) and
fourth-seeded USC (11-7) will meet
in a tossup of a quarterfinal, as the

pair split its regular season match-up.
Washington has won four games in a
row while USC lost their last two.
The semifinal spot may come down
to whether USC's scoring trio of
Shay Murphy (17.6 ppg). Jamie
Hagiya (10.8 ppg) and Chloe Kerr
(10.2 ppg) can do more than Wash
ington's deep, third-ranked offense.
THE DARK HORSE
The lowest-seeded of three teams
with a serious shot at the title, third
seeded California (12-6) still de
serves special notice, as they were re
sponsible for top-seeded Stanford's
lone conference loss. The Bears are
all about post play: Pac-10 Player of
the Year Devanei Hampton and fel
low All-Pac-10 forward Ashley
Walker are first and second in the
conference in rebounding, as well as
in the top eight in scoring, too. But if
Hampton. Walker or stand-in point
guard Natasha Vital gets in foul trou
ble, Cal will be in serious trouble.
THE CONTENDER
Second-seeded Arizona State (16-2)
topped last year's 14-4 record but
still found themselves behind Stan
ford in the Pac-10. Ihe Sun Devils
have a potent, balanced offense in
which six players average over nine
points per game (although one of
them, Dymond Simon, is out on in
jury). In a tournament where the
champion must win three games in
three days, ASU's depth makes them
incredibly dangerous. Do not be sur
prised if the Sun Devils are fresher
than their opponents in their match
ups after day one.
THE FAVORITE
First-seeded Stanford (17-1) was
upset by UCLA in last year's final,
and they will be eager to avoid a sim
ilar fate this year. Coach Tara Van-
Derveer is not eager enough, though,
to commit to playing the injury
plagued junior Candice Wiggins in
this tournament. Stanford has sever
al other potent weapons—Pac-10
Freshman of the Year Jayne Appel
(14.9 ppg. 7.5 rebounds per game)
and senior forward Brooke Smith
(13.4 points, 7.9 rebounds) are two of
the best posts in the country. But if
Wiggins is out, the Cardinal will need
its conference-best defense (56.2
points allowed per game) to step up.
