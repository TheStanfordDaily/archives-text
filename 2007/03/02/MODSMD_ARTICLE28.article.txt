## Senior duo dominates down low to lift Card 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
For seniors Brooke Smith and
Kristen Newlin. four seasons with
Stanford women's basketball came
down to the final seconds against
Southern California this past Sun
day. With the Cardinal down 51-50
against the Women of Troy, and 2:28
to go, it was time for the two centers
to step up yet again for the Cardinal.
Newlin responded to Sun Devil
Morghan Medlock's game-retaking
three pointer with a jumper at 2:14 to
go. USC's Eshaya Murphy coun
tered with a layup.but freshman cen
ter Jayne Appel gave Stanford its
own one-point lead.
With just 11 seconds left on the
clock, and the Sun Devils still fight
ing for an upset. Smith's two free
throws sealed the deal for the Cardi
nal. 56-53 — at the same time cap
ping her and Newlin's Stanford ca
reers.
Except for the postseason, that is.
"[That was the end of] our regular
season, but we really we see what's
coming up as a new beginning,"
Newlin said."We really want to keep
the season going as long as possible."
So. with the Cardinal's first game
of th e Pacific-10 C on fe rence Tou rn a
ment tomorrow afternoon, and the
NCAA tournament just two weeks
away. Smith and Newlin are hoping
for many more tight finishes — and
victories.
"We're both feeling a little sense
or urgency, knowing that it's now or
never for us," Newlin said. "Whatev
er we want to get done, we have to do
it this year."
Promising to "bring a little extra
something" to postseason play, the
power duo on the paint is looking to
put the past behind them. Last Sun
day's senior day. featuring roses,
hugs from head coach Tara Van-
Derveer and the customary snipping
of the net was swept away with tip
off.
"It was little bit emotional.but we
put that all behind us, and once we
started playing, we knew we still had
to win that game to become Pac-10
champs," Newlin said.
The drive to clinch a seventh

straight Pac-10 regular-season title
for Stanford pushed Smith and
Newlin through the final minutes
and moments. Now. though, the sen
iors are fueled by the drive to reclaim
the Pac-10 Tournament title after
last year's upset at the hands of
UCLA.
And. ignoring the elephant in the
room — at long last (after three
straight trips to the Elite Eight), a
trip to the Final Four, or daresay it, a
national championship — Smith
and Newlin agree that taking it one
game at a time is paramount.
"Coming into the postseason sen
ior year, we know we're only guaran
teed one more game, so we're focus
ing on each one as it comes," Smith
said. "We know what we want, but
we also know it's a long way to get
there."
TTiis weekend's tournament will
provide a barometer for Stanford,
especially considering the possible
three-game absence of junior guard
Candice Wiggins. Smith and Newlin
are ready to step up — as they al
ready have.
In the two games thus far without
the Cardinal's leading scorer. Smith
had 14 points (and 7 rebounds)
against UCLA and 13 points against
the Women of Troy. Newlin had 10
rebounds against the Bruins, and fol
lowed up with nine more against
USC, along with 10 points. The per
formances finished off Stanford's 17-
1 Pac-10 record — and put targets
on the backs of the two dominant
seniors.
"We have to come out and play
with energy and with desire," Smith
said. "The teams in the Pac-10 are
going to come out wanting to beat us.
We have to bring something to each
game; we have to play with a little bit
of attitude and really be aggressive."
I lelping the two will be the Cardi
nal's recent leading scorer in Wig
gins' absence: the newly named Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year, Appel. She
had 24 points and nine rebounds
against UCLA and a further 14
points and nine rebounds versus the
Women of Troy.
Developing into yet another
force under the basket for the Cardi
nal. Appel was quick to give credit on

Sunday.
"[Brooke and Kristen] have
taught me everything ... through
out the whole year, on and off the
court," she said.
Along with sophomore center
Morgan Clyburn, Appel has taken
on Newlin and Smith in two-on-two
games during practice all season.The
older posts avoid saying that the ex
perience has taught Appel "every
thing," though.
"Jayne's obviously a talented bas
ketball player," Smith said. "She
picks up and learns really quickly
and has a great attitude and outlook
on the team aspects of the game."
Smith and Newlin. themselves,
have proved largely beneficial to the
team, whether contributing to the
scoreboard or to the development of
the team. Reminiscing about their
own growth since their freshman
seasons, the duo is happy "showing
[the younger players] the ropes,
helping them figure things out and
giving back," Smith said.

"Hopefully we're setting a stan
dard for what they might he able to
pass on to younger kids coming in."
Newlin added. "I know 1 came in
looking at the seniors, expecting to
play as hard as they played, so hope
fully we're leaving that work ethic in
them."
That ethic will have to come
through in the coming weeks for the
Pac-10 and NCAA tourneys. With
blue-shaded images of Newlin and
Smith — as often seen, guarding the
basket from a shot attempt, in a dis
play of their height and strength —
gracing the posters for the NCAA
first and second rounds hosted at
Maples, the duo hopes, and believes,
it can make the effort to pull Stan
ford through the postseason as far as
possible.
"We definitely want to help the
team and make the experience last
as long as possible," Smith said.

team and make the experience last
as long as possible," Smith said.

Seniors Brooke Smith and Kristen Newlin provide a powerful presence down low.
For seniors Brooke Smith and
Kristen Newlin. four seasons with
Stanford women's basketball came
down to the final seconds against
Southern California this past Sun
day. With the Cardinal down 51-50
against the Women of Troy, and 2:28
to go, it was time for the two centers
to step up yet again for the Cardinal.
Newlin responded to Sun Devil
Morghan Medlock's game-retaking
three pointer with a jumper at 2:14 to
go. USC's Eshaya Murphy coun
tered with a layup.but freshman cen
ter Jayne Appel gave Stanford its
own one-point lead.
With just 11 seconds left on the
clock, and the Sun Devils still fight
ing for an upset. Smith's two free
throws sealed the deal for the Cardi
nal. 56-53 — at the same time cap
ping her and Newlin's Stanford ca
reers.
Except for the postseason, that is.
"[That was the end of] our regular
season, but we really we see what's
coming up as a new beginning,"
Newlin said."We really want to keep
the season going as long as possible."
So. with the Cardinal's first game
of th e Pacific-10 C on fe rence Tou rn a
ment tomorrow afternoon, and the
NCAA tournament just two weeks
away. Smith and Newlin are hoping
for many more tight finishes — and
victories.
"We're both feeling a little sense
or urgency, knowing that it's now or
never for us," Newlin said. "Whatev
er we want to get done, we have to do
it this year."
Promising to "bring a little extra
something" to postseason play, the
power duo on the paint is looking to
put the past behind them. Last Sun
day's senior day. featuring roses,
hugs from head coach Tara Van-
Derveer and the customary snipping
of the net was swept away with tip
off.
"It was little bit emotional.but we
put that all behind us, and once we
started playing, we knew we still had
to win that game to become Pac-10
champs," Newlin said.
The drive to clinch a seventh

straight Pac-10 regular-season title
for Stanford pushed Smith and
Newlin through the final minutes
and moments. Now. though, the sen
iors are fueled by the drive to reclaim
the Pac-10 Tournament title after
last year's upset at the hands of
UCLA.
And. ignoring the elephant in the
room — at long last (after three
straight trips to the Elite Eight), a
trip to the Final Four, or daresay it, a
national championship — Smith
and Newlin agree that taking it one
game at a time is paramount.
"Coming into the postseason sen
ior year, we know we're only guaran
teed one more game, so we're focus
ing on each one as it comes," Smith
said. "We know what we want, but
we also know it's a long way to get
there."
TTiis weekend's tournament will
provide a barometer for Stanford,
especially considering the possible
three-game absence of junior guard
Candice Wiggins. Smith and Newlin
are ready to step up — as they al
ready have.
In the two games thus far without
the Cardinal's leading scorer. Smith
had 14 points (and 7 rebounds)
against UCLA and 13 points against
the Women of Troy. Newlin had 10
rebounds against the Bruins, and fol
lowed up with nine more against
USC, along with 10 points. The per
formances finished off Stanford's 17-
1 Pac-10 record — and put targets
on the backs of the two dominant
seniors.
"We have to come out and play
with energy and with desire," Smith
said. "The teams in the Pac-10 are
going to come out wanting to beat us.
We have to bring something to each
game; we have to play with a little bit
of attitude and really be aggressive."
I lelping the two will be the Cardi
nal's recent leading scorer in Wig
gins' absence: the newly named Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year, Appel. She
had 24 points and nine rebounds
against UCLA and a further 14
points and nine rebounds versus the
Women of Troy.
Developing into yet another
force under the basket for the Cardi
nal. Appel was quick to give credit on

Sunday.
"[Brooke and Kristen] have
taught me everything ... through
out the whole year, on and off the
court," she said.
Along with sophomore center
Morgan Clyburn, Appel has taken
on Newlin and Smith in two-on-two
games during practice all season.The
older posts avoid saying that the ex
perience has taught Appel "every
thing," though.
"Jayne's obviously a talented bas
ketball player," Smith said. "She
picks up and learns really quickly
and has a great attitude and outlook
on the team aspects of the game."
Smith and Newlin. themselves,
have proved largely beneficial to the
team, whether contributing to the
scoreboard or to the development of
the team. Reminiscing about their
own growth since their freshman
seasons, the duo is happy "showing
[the younger players] the ropes,
helping them figure things out and
giving back," Smith said.

"Hopefully we're setting a stan
dard for what they might he able to
pass on to younger kids coming in."
Newlin added. "I know 1 came in
looking at the seniors, expecting to
play as hard as they played, so hope
fully we're leaving that work ethic in
them."
That ethic will have to come
through in the coming weeks for the
Pac-10 and NCAA tourneys. With
blue-shaded images of Newlin and
Smith — as often seen, guarding the
basket from a shot attempt, in a dis
play of their height and strength —
gracing the posters for the NCAA
first and second rounds hosted at
Maples, the duo hopes, and believes,
it can make the effort to pull Stan
ford through the postseason as far as
possible.
"We definitely want to help the
team and make the experience last
as long as possible," Smith said.
