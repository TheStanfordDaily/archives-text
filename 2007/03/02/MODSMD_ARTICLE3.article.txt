## Energy talk warms up Student-organized conference draws acclaimed speakers 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Energy Crossroads 2007 kicked off last night
with opening remarks by former CIA Director R.
James Woolsey.The message? Get excited about
alternative energy.
A student-organized symposium that will run
through tomorrow. Energy Crossroads' opening
day also included a career fair and a clean tech
nology expo.
In his speech, Woolsey outlined energy-relat
ed problems and discussed how solutions should
be approached. I Ic argued that the U.S. needs to
make substantial, cost-effective changes to the
energy system, and that it has to recognize two
central problems: the danger posed to national se
curity by dependence on foreign oil and a vulner
able electricity grid. I le also cited climate change
due to global warming as a pressing threat.
"Our consumption of oil is like a six-pack-a
day cigarette habit," Woolsey said. "We are ad
dicted. and we are endangering everything."
Woolsey lamented the $300 billion the U.S.

spends annually on foreign oil, but stressed the
importance of searching for multiple solutions.
He called hydrogen fuel cell-powered passenger
vehicles "one of the worst" transportation solu
tions due to the vast amount of infrastructure
necessary and the questionable energy savings.
"We have to assume that we need a portfolio
of solutions and need to utilize technical break
throughs we already have." he said. "We can't ig
nore costs and just throw money at the problem.
That strategy didn't work very well in the 19705."

Woolsey suggested three areas that he said de
serve our focus â€” electricity, biofuels and carbon
composites.
After Woolsey conclude his remarks, Ralph
Cavanagh, co-director of the National Resources
Defense Council's Energy Program, spoke about
California's role in combating the energy crisis.
I le stressed the importance of recognizing energy
efficiency, citing refrigerators as examples of ap-

pliances that have become increas
ingly efficient despite increasing
size and stable costs.
Cavanagh said the U.S. can
achieve greater efficiency through a
combined effort of government pol
icy and incentives for businesses to
innovate.
He challenged the audience to be
proactive and said the onus is on cit
izens to make a difference.
"For you. California energy and
climate policy must no longer be a
spectator event," Cavanagh said.
"The opportunities are there for
you, and we need you to seize
them."
Steven Chu, director of the
Lawrence Berkeley National I.abo
ratory, highlighted some of the tech
nologies that will aid the search for
new sources of energy. I le discussed
the promise of wind and solar power
as well as ethanol produced from
switchgrass instead of corn. Chu
pointed to distributing energy as a
critical challenge and said the U.S.
has a "primitive energy transmission
system "
Energy Crossroads will continue
today, with three panels and the
keynote address by three-time
Pulitzer Prize winning New York
Times columnist Thomas Friedman
at 1 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
