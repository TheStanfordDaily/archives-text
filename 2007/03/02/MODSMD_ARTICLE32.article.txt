## Editors' Note 
### BETSY CONGDON BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION RESIDENT ALIENS 
We know how you feel. It's that time of the quarter — the time when you pick
up your class syllabus and realize that the number of pages you still need to read
before finals is at least a four digit number. The time when you note all of your
papers that are due and realize that you've definitely got six of them to turn in
within a three-day period — and the shortest one is 15 pages (or, il you re
Betsy, a hella-lotta problem sets with a midterm or two right in between).
Ouch.
So needless to say, this is the point in the quarter when many of you become,
well, a bit nervous. A bit on edge. A bit... insane, if you will. We know the feel
ing. We're both taking lull course loads. And stubbornly insisting on those
weekly Intermission golf rounds didn't exactly help us "get ahead" in our class
es or anything like that.
Agh. What is a poor Stanford student to do? Take a break, we say!
"Take a break?" you ask while casting an incredulous glance in our direction.
"Isn't that just going to make things worse?"
Oh, quite the contrary.
You sec. there's a scholastic phenomenon known as "brain meltdown." It's
hard to technically define, but it essentially entails that if you work hours upon
hours upon hours on end, your efficiency will decrease. You will gradually lose
control of your bodily functions. You will enter a permanent dream world,
where you are continually half asleep and half awake. You will drool on your
desk in class and embarrass yourself. (That is. if you're actually taking time
from your library cramming to. uh. go to class!)
There's no cure for brain meltdown. But there is a highly effective preventa
tive treatment. It's called "taking a break." Hence our recommendation lor you
to, err. chill out for a bit. Go buy an ice cream cone on University Ave. Get your
shoes muddy at the Dish while you wonder why the hell someone thought to
put a hiking trail leading to a satellite array. This stuff might seem inane, but it
works. It clears your head. Gives you some perspective. Reminds you that
there's more to life than your classes or transcript.
And don't worry. The break won't last forever (unless you're a no-good pro
fessional procrastinator like one of us). It'll be over, and then you'll be back to
your precious work soon enough. But the difference is that you'll actually be
able to think, actually be able to work, actually be able to get through the quar
ter without, well, not getting through it (nabbing a bag of incompletes most cer
tainly does NOT count as completing it, as one unlucky former Intermission ed
itor learned the hard way).
So seriously. Take a break. You'll be glad you did. And if you're not — well,
then you're probably so screwed to begin with that it won't really matter either
way.
1 lappv finals!
