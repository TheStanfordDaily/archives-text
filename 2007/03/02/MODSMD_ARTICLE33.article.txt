## How to pull an all-nighter without doing work... TV DVDs 
### RACHEL LEVY INTERMISSION BLOCKBUSTER QUEEN 
Whoever thought of packaging entire seasons of television shows in DVD box sets was a ge
nius. Since apparently my brain is not big enough to retain the small details of all of the TV shows
that I watch, this means that I can break out the DVDs of a show that 1 haven't seen in awhile,
and appreciate it all over again. Here are a few box sets that I feel are worth owning:
1. "Arrested Development," Season 2 — I think I'm pretty much preaching to the choir here
when I lament the early cancellation of this extremely brilliant show. That being said, it goes
without saying that "Arrested Development" belongs in anyone's collection of TV DVDs.
Choosing a specific season was difficult, but as funny as Season 1 was, I think that Season 2 was
the show's strongest. It was this set of episodes that contained the running gag with Tobias and
the Blue Man Group ("I think I just blue myself'), George Michael's ugly girlfriend Ann,
Buster's hand getting eaten by a seal and the list goes 0n...

12. "Battlestar lea," Season 1 — People laugh at me whenever I try to tell them that this
show is superb, but believe me when 1 say that this is the best sci-fi that I have seen since "Star
Trek: Voyager" ended. The box set of the first season includes the mini-series which introduces
*i_ 4.: : ~

us to trie entire premise ot tne snow: Man-
I made machines called Cylons evolved and re-
I belled, killing many humans and expelling

the rest into space, where they continue to be

pursued by the Cylons. Although this
show is most definitely science fic-

tion, the reason why it succeeds
is that it contains plenty of
drama and touches on impor-

tant and relevant philosophical is-

sues.
3. "Curb Your Enthusiasm," Season 2 —
If anybody hasn't seen "Curb Your En
thusiasm," you're missing out on one of
the funniest comedies on TV. Granted,
this style of comedy isn't for everyone

(and if you didn't like "Seinfeld," then
there's no way that you'll like this), but
i if you give it some time, I think that

you'll grow to love it. In this show,
which is partially improvised, Larry
David (the creator of "Seinfeld") stars
i as himself in a loosely based version

of his own life. Basically, in every
episode Larry offends some-

body, and hilarity always ensues.
This season contains my personal
favorite episode, " The Doll"

(which concludes with a lit
tle girl hugging Larry and
crying to her mother that

there's something hard in his pants... which turns out to be a water bottle... you'll have to watch
to find out why).
4. "24," Season 1 — 1 cannot think of a better show to watch on DVD than "24." It is so sus
penseful that 1 actually can't imagine watching it from week to week when it airs on TV — I think
that the wait would take something away from it (which is why 1 have always watched it from the
DVDs... so don't ever bring up the current season when you're around me or I'll plug my ears).
Again, this is one of those shows where every season has been consistently good, but 1 decided
to go with the first one here because it was that much more exciting since the concept was new
at the time.
5. "Firefly," The Complete Series — I didn't discover this prematurely canceled series until this
summer when 1 marathoned the entire thing one weekend with my roommate. What a gem of a
show (and it is only $19.99 on Amazon.com)! You might be skeptical about a show classified as
a "sci-fi western," but the strange way in which this show combined space and the west was quite
enjoyable. Lastly, this set is a must because it contains the three episodes of "Firefly" that never
aired on TV.
6. "Project Runway, " Season 2 — 1 never thought that I would be recommending the pur
chasing of reality television on DVD. I used to think that watching reality TV was dumb, let
alone buying it to view repeatedly. However, "Project Runway" is different than the others be
cause the people on this show actually have talent. Who could believe that you could make wear
able clothing out of plants? While all of the seasons of this show are good, Season 3 (the most re
cent) isn't even on DVD yet. and Season 2 in my opinion worked out a few of the kinks of Sea
son 1. For example, somebody made Heidi Klum fix her grammatically incorrect line

of, "Models, this is also a competition for you as well," which both-

ered me every time!

7. "Sex and the City," The Complete Series — For
give me men. but "Sex and the City" is the last entry
on this list. Talk about consistent comedy! There real
ly wasn't a bad episode of this show, which is why 1
cheated a little bit and put the whole series on this list

instead of choosing a single season (though I
would be remiss if 1 didn't mention that the first

season was definitely the weakest). I also like
this show because the episodes can stand on
their own and still be enjoyed (unlike "Ar
rested Development," for example, which
really needs to be watched in proper order or
you'll miss a lot of details and jokes). The "Sex

and the City" DVDs are also worth owning be- j
cause, as you know, this show originally aired
on HBO. even though edited reruns now air on
TBS. the originals are way funnier.

Honorable Mentions (or if I had space to make
a bigger list): "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The 1
Chosen Collection." "Nip/Tuck" Season 1. any
season of "Scrubs" or "Friends," "Six Feet
Under" Season 2, "Alias" Season 1.

DVDs... so don't ever bring up the current season when you're around me or I'll plug my ears).
Again, this is one of those shows where every season has been consistently good, but 1 decided
to go with the first one here because it was that much more exciting since the concept was new
at the time.
5. "Firefly," The Complete Series — I didn't discover this prematurely canceled series until this
summer when 1 marathoned the entire thing one weekend with my roommate. What a gem of a
show (and it is only $19.99 on Amazon.com)! You might be skeptical about a show classified as
a "sci-fi western," but the strange way in which this show combined space and the west was quite
enjoyable. Lastly, this set is a must because it contains the three episodes of "Firefly" that never
aired on TV.
6. "Project Runway, " Season 2 — 1 never thought that I would be recommending the pur
chasing of reality television on DVD. I used to think that watching reality TV was dumb, let
alone buying it to view repeatedly. However, "Project Runway" is different than the others be
cause the people on this show actually have talent. Who could believe that you could make wear
able clothing out of plants? While all of the seasons of this show are good, Season 3 (the most re
cent) isn't even on DVD yet. and Season 2 in my opinion worked out a few of the kinks of Sea
son 1. For example, somebody made Heidi Klum fix her grammatically incorrect line

of, "Models, this is also a competition for you as well," which both-

ered me every time!

7. "Sex and the City," The Complete Series — For
give me men. but "Sex and the City" is the last entry
on this list. Talk about consistent comedy! There real
ly wasn't a bad episode of this show, which is why 1
cheated a little bit and put the whole series on this list

instead of choosing a single season (though I
would be remiss if 1 didn't mention that the first

season was definitely the weakest). I also like
this show because the episodes can stand on
their own and still be enjoyed (unlike "Ar
rested Development," for example, which
really needs to be watched in proper order or
you'll miss a lot of details and jokes). The "Sex

and the City" DVDs are also worth owning be- j
cause, as you know, this show originally aired
on HBO. even though edited reruns now air on
TBS. the originals are way funnier.

Honorable Mentions (or if I had space to make
a bigger list): "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The 1
Chosen Collection." "Nip/Tuck" Season 1. any
season of "Scrubs" or "Friends," "Six Feet
Under" Season 2, "Alias" Season 1.
