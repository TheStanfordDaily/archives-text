## It's 'Too Soon' to dismiss Norah Jones 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION JONES JONEZER 
Norah Jones' New CD "Not Too Late"
Norah Jones has always had a lot to live up to. Not only is she
the daughter of Ravi Shankar, famous sitar-player and mentor
to George Harrison, but the incredible success of her debut
album looms threateningly over the shoulder of each successive
release. After her first record, "Come Away With Me" in 2002,
she became the second person ever to win the "Big Four" at the
Grammys, taking home Record of the Year, Album of the Year.
Song of the Year and Best New Artist. Her second album, "Feels
Like Home" (2004) also took Record of the Year, and Jones
rounded out her Grammy wins to a grand total of eight in 2005.
So can she do it again?
Norah Jones" music has been classified as pop, folk, soul, coun
try and jazz, and "Not Too Late" is a bona fide mix of each of
these genres. "Broken" is particularly country, with story-telling
lyrics and a twangy background, while "Be My Somebody"
boasts a perceptibly more pop sound due to its upbeat tempo
and catchy chorus. "Rosie s Lullaby" stands as a much quieter,
folksier number, and it is followed by the slow and endlessly
soulful "Not Too Late." In general, her thirtj record is not the
jazz album of "Come Away With Me" and does not continue
the strong country influences from "Feels Like Home." In
stead. "Not Too Late" lands somewhere in between these two,
standing as an cxample of how genre blending can lead to inno
vative sounds.
This album is also different from her previous two in its bold-

er and experimental tracks. "Sinkin' Soon" is particularly no
table with its distinct cabaret sound and unique percussion,
which ranges from a slit drum to pots and pans. It's lyrics are ec
centric, and the song ends with "We're the golden crust on an
apple pie/ That shines in the sun at noon/ like the wheel of

cheese high in the sky/ We 11... we're going to be sinkin'
soon," just as the trombone fades out and the cymbals rattle
to an end. Much later on the album, we encounter Jones as
a political satirist in "My Dear Country," which she wrote
before the 2004 election. After heavily critiquing the pres
ident and sharing her deep disappointment in the outcome

of the election, Jones simply and poetically ends

the song with, "I love the things o*#
you've given me/ And most of all that ;
am free/ To have a song that I can sing/«

- e

perceptive. In "Rosie's Lullaby," Jones,
uses her powerhouse vocals to transform s

about lost love or loneliness. However, this theme doesn't

come off as repetitive or overly bitter
