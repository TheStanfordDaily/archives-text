Waaaay back in the day, in 2003, Montreal-based Arcade Fire de
buted with a solid self-titled EP followed shortly thereafter by their j
first full-length album, "Funeral." It was immediately apparent that j
their sound was something unfamiliar. With eight regular band mem
bers, each proficient in a number of instruments and many lending

their voices to boot, their album sounded more like an orchestral
arrangements than your typical rock group."Funeral" earned a Pitch-

fork rating of 9.7 and immediately got with the"in crowd"of music snobs
everywhere. It didn't take long for people to notice. And with no less than 266

anlord hacehook profiles attesting to their popular-sub-mainstream-but-not-quite— un

hearing a lot more from them.
Let me cut to the chase. Arcade Fire's much awaited new album, titled "Neon Bible,"not
only lives up to the highest of expectations, but expands on new territory with a distinctly
Arcade Fire sound. If you're reading this anytime after March 6. stop right now and go out
