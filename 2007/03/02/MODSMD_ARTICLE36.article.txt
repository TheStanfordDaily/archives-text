### STUART BAIMEL INTERMISSION SHOEGAZER 
Deerhunting for shoegaze
I'll admit it. I'm not usually a fan of the
I branch of rock callcd "shoegaze," which
is often characterized by walls of sound,
washy guitars and distortion. I once lis
, tened to Lush, but not anymore, and I
' never really got into My Bloody Valen
tine. It seems inhabit an unhappy medi
um between straightforward rock in its var
| ious forms and more spectral, atmospheric
music like Air and Sigur Ros.
Shoegaze seems to have had its heyday in
the early 1990s (the hallmark album of the
I genre. My Bloody Valentine's "Loveless,"
came out in 1991) but the genre has proven
to have a strong influence on artists that fol
i lowed, including MB3 and Six Organs of
Admittance. I heard about Dcerhunter
from a friend, but was skeptical — a band
that revives and innovates the shoegaze
) sound? My initial doubts quickly wore off
during the first listen, both due to the
album's initial

accessibility
' and the coher
ence of its
sound.
| First off, the
album's name
— "Cryp
tograms" — is
| a fitting one. It
is indeed a
cryptic work.
, It's not an
' album that im
mediately be
comes com
| prehensible on
the first listen,
the second or
even the third.
I The first track
is titled
"Intro," and it
k is just that.
' Slow-building
guitars and

postmodern
| beepings permeate a lyric-less haze, and it is
clear that this is an album one listens to on
a high-quality sound system; otherwise, it is
difficult to discern the layered complexity
I of the first track — and indeed, of the

"My greatest
fear,
I fantasized,
The days were
long.
The weeks flew
by,
Before I knew,
I was awake,
My days were
through"

album.
The second track,
the title track, be
gins with singer
Bradford Cox
mouthing, "My
greatest fear/ I
fantasized/ The
days were long/ The weeks flew by/ Before
I knew/ I was awake/ My days were
through," and the disillusionment — and
vague sense of the apocalypse — permeate
the rest of the album.
The album was recorded in two separate
sessions, roughly splitting the album in half.
The first half is bleak, brooding and heavy.
Faint lyrics can be heard just above the gui
tars' wash. "Lake Somerset" is the first
half s strongest track, with nifty guitar work
and soaring, building vocals. The second
half, which begins at "Red Ink," has a no
ticeably different sound. The guitars are

much cleaner, and the songs are
more accessible, less intimidating
and easier to penetrate. "Cryp
tograms" still proceeds slowly, and
the pace does not really pick up in
the second half. It appears that
band's innovation occurs in the
first half, and the second is far
more straightforward and compa
rable to previous work by other
bands.
The two halves of the album are
different enough to merit individ
ual albums, and one wonders what
might have been. On the other
hand, 12 tracks' worth of the first
half's artistry, rather than six,
might have been too much, render
ing the album much like a too-rich
piece of cake. The sudden shift,
however, from the first half to the
second is unsettling. Although it
may be the band's intention, it
hampers attaining a comprehen
sive sense of the album's direction.
"Cryptograms," despite its bifur-

cation, is a superb work of artistry,
both in its first and second halves. Its com
plexities and mumbled lyrics maybe can
never be deciphered entirely, but the album
is good enough that it is worth trying —
over and over again.
