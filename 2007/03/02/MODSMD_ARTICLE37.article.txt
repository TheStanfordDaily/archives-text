# CHILLAX PLAYLIST
## 
### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION CHILLER 
"Orange Sky" — Alexi Murdoch
Alexi Murdoch's voice is beautiful and haunting; it has
the odd effect §

of being simultaneously uplifting and melancholy. It
j sticks with you, I

| though — emotional without being sappy.
"Promising Light" — Iron and Wine
i Iron and Wine can, on occasion, suffer from

j the boring gene. "Promising
" Light" successfully walks the tightrope be-

Itween soft and soporific,
creating a quiet gem.

1 "The Shining" — Badly Drawn Boy /
! Before "About a Boy" made Badly
; Drawn Boy famous, he was generating

r wonderfully relaxed and gorgeous melodies. The
strings and horns

skillfully weave in and out of each other during the intro, and their
j periodic occurrcnces throughout the song are enough to put anyone at
I ease.
B
I"Push (acoustic)" — matchbox twenty
While artists re-doing their own songs can end in disaster, the
facelift matchbox twenty gave their most famous song transcends the
song past its rougher pop origins into something new and pretty, almost
belying the depressing message behind the lyrics. Plus, Rob
I Thomas's voice is car sex.
"Aqueous Transmission" — Incubus
"I'm floating down a river," is the opening lyric, and the song
I delivers on the promise. If you need a seven-and-a-half minute break
from your life, just put on this song, lay down, close your eyes and
6 you can almost feel the beach below you.
I
i "Fair"—The Annuals
| This song begins quietly and builds upon itself masterfully. It's worth
multiple listenings just to understand and then admire its composition.
The vocals become part of the wall of sound, and it's inspiring.
I "Two Coins"—Dispatch
What good is a chill playlist without a jam band? Dispatch's harmonies
* are brilliant, and this song is no exception.
! "Hello Sunshine" — Super Furry Animals
You can't beat a song that invites sunshine into your life. Take a
i moment and bask.
I
ji "Shelter" — Ray LaMontagne
Ray's voice is rich and inviting, and "Shelter" is his most warm-fuzzy
I song. Curl up, turn up the volume and relax in the glory that is Ray
LaMontagne.
"Stepping Out Queen Part 2" — Van Morrison
ii Picking just one Van Morrison song is almost impossible — there arc so
many that could be on a relaxing playlist. "Stepping Out Queen Part 2"
wins because Van manages to invite you into his garden lyrically and
melodically. And how do you beat a line like, "I like your face from
| the left side?" Van is a genius.
