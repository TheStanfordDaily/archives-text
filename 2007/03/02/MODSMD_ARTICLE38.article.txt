The Dish Although it doesn't provide satellite TV, the Dish ant
its surrounding area is a great place to take a hike on a pleasan
I afternoon. For a second, you might even forget you're still in tin
Stanford Bubble.
Moon Bean's Disregarding the fact that it's sandwiched be
tween Green and Meyer Libraries, frequenting Moonßean's i.<
a fun way to pretend you're at an actual, cute n' trendv cafe
(They take real money and everything!)
I'omituin in front of the Stanford Hospital Hanging out around
a hospital may not be your idea of tun. Understandable. Bui
weird location aside, this sizable fountain deserves a visit if only
to catch the humorous mating antics of its resident mallard
ducks. Fun. indeed.
The planters around the Quad ()ne of the most accessible and
stunningly beautiful places to sit on campus. Recline and stare
off into some foliage until a tourist interrupts to ask you if he can
take a picture with a real, live Stanford student.
The benches around the Claw It is almost impossible to sit with
in these four concrete parentheses and get work done. Between
the baby-Gap model inches away from falling into the fountain
and the unleashed doggy parading about, you will be distracted.
And that's a good thing.
I he Arizona Cactus Garden. No need to get on a plane for this.
II you re willing to trek out to the Mausoleum and navigate
from there, you will stumble across an unexpected garden of
500 cacti and succulents. Just remember to keep vour hands to
[JJ yourselves, kids.
ll
n Ann Blue Garden. In between the two Serra Complex build
ings hides a little slice ol paradise. The garden, which is report
\ edly Monet-inspired, leatures a lootbridge, pond and charming
foliage. It may not live up to the French countryside, but there
are some rocking benches. Literally rocking. As in. they rock,
back and forth.
Stanford Bookstore. If you can't get off campus and really want
to catch up on the latest issue of The Economist or Vogue, the
Bookstore is the way to go. It you feel ridiculous sitting in the lit
tle kiddy seats by the magazine section, check out the ample
seating in the back. I he spots by the walls of windows are per
fect for people watching. I Intil you realize how creepy it is that
someone could potentially be viewing as you scamper from
Meyer to White Plaza.
;Storke Publication Building. Come keep the Daily staffers
company. We have cable. Be sure to visit the Intermission of
fice. Its the most fun you II ever have in a windowless room.

I ut down that problem set. Snap out ot that literary haze. Its time to take a break. Not the "I'm going to take a nap lor 15 minutes at 2 a.m. to recharge" sort, but rather a physical and hopefully men-l
kil distancing from everything that's stressing you out. Whether you are familiar with these suggested break sites or not, they're all worth a visit.

J Within walking or biking distance oi campus:
The Stanford Shopping Center. Simply because it's fun to make fun of ridiculously overpriced everything — and have
staring contests with the bouncers in front of Tiffany's and Cartier. But also because its pretty and there are some really
nice places to eat. If you feel the urge to overindulge, try La Baguette. Their desserts taste as good as they look from the
glass window.
Keplers bookstore. Support this sizable yet cozy independent bookstore, located at 1010 ('amino Real. Be sure to check
out Kepler's Web site (www.keplers.com) for a calendar of their many events, especially visits by prominent authors.
Then walk next door to Cafe Barone (http://www.cafeborrone.com/) for some of the most delectable fare around.
California Avenue. Basically the less-manicured, usually overlooked avatar of University Avenue. When you get tired of
consuming Darbar and gelato every weekend, check out this avenue. There are some really good restaurants within a
wide range of prices. Then, after chowing down, check out some of the interesting shops and used bookstores.
Coupa Cafe. The gems of "downtown" Palo Alto are not on University Ave. but rather on the side streets. With its warm
lighting, cozy fireplace and eclectic seating options, Coupa (Coupacafe.com. 538 Ramona St.) sort of feels like the
kitchen/living room of your favorite aunt. You know. The cool one. And like any hip aunt's kitchen. Coupa features a
wealth of yummy goodies and beverages, from special Venezuelan coffee and chocolates to crepes and fancy salads. At
any given time, a handful of Stanford students will probably be sprinkled throughout the Palo Alto yuppies. Some of them
will even be studying. But remember: You're there to take a break!
Johnson Park. This place, located on 2(X) Kipling St. (on Everett Ave. between Kipling and Waverly Streets) is not a
grassy field masquerading as a park — it is the park in which you and your friends frolicked, circa first grade. There are
swings, sandboxes and whatever else your six-year-old heart desires. And w hen you're sick of getting nasty looks from
the little imps who want their swings back, check out the gigantic concrete slide. Bring a piece of cardboard (from a box
or something) for the optimal experience. Amusement parks, shmamusement parks. This is the way to go.
