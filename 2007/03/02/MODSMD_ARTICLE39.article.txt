## Be a hero: Go Greek at Gyros Gyros 
### BAILEY RICHARDSON MARY LIZ MCCURDY INTERMISSION HEROES 
Ok, so the name is lame. Along with the repetitive unorigi
nality of "Gyros Gyros," I'm not confident I can say the word

"gyros" correctly once, let
alone twice (for the record,
it's pronounced "yecros").
Nevertheless, Mary Liz and 1
decided to take refuge from
the torrential downpour in
side this quaint Mediter
ranean cafe located between
Pluto's and California Pizza
Kitchen on University Av
enue.
Upon opening the door,
the bright yellow walls and
olive green pillars greeted us
loudly. Was this Greece or
did we stumble into Chicken
Ranch down the street? A

giant glass showed us vats of hummus, dolmas,and eggplant
salad, while plates of bakla va drenched the surrounding counter
space. A few feet behind the glass display, the cafe's eponymous
chicken and lamb rotated and glistened on a vertical rotisserie.
Our stomachs roared like ancient Greek warriors. (Editor's
note: Wow, that's almost as lame as the name of the restaurant!)
After a painfully thorough examination of the menu. Mary
Liz and I decided on the Appetizer Combo Plate ($9.95), the
Vegetarian Lentil Soup of the Day ($3.50) and the restaurant's
most popular dish, the Chicken Gyros ($6.45). Our cashier rang
up the dinner for two to the grand total of $23.17.
1 barely had the time to utter "Oovjh, comfy seats!" before
the soup, appetizer combo and plentiful side of warm pitas
crowdcd our table. Mary Liz, a veteran waitress, presented her
first critique of the night: "Soup at the same time as the combo?

Big no-no." Gyros Gyros had blown the timing of the dishes,
and our Lentil Soup bore the consequences as we focused all
our attention on the combo plate.
This color wheel of hummus, eggplant salad, tabouleh, two
dolmas, two falafel balls, cacik and one other unidentifiable

very good
thing. The low
light of the dish
was the cacik —

another unpro
nounceable word
that, if you are lucky,
you will never have to
use. Think Greek
potato salad, with
cubed carrots and
green peas floating in-

olive flavored hummus-like mixture
was definitely the big hit of the night.
The highlight of the smorgasbord was
the tabouleh, a finely diced mixture of
cracked wheat, tomatoes, bell pep
pers. parsley and olive oil that Gyros
Gyros ingeniously topped off with lit
tle cubes of feta. The addition of
feta was, as

side. Woof. All in all, the Combo Plate delighted us most as an
ensemble dish. Slopping and slapping the two hummuses, the
eggplant salad and the falafel balls altogether inside a warm pita
and topping it off with some tzatziki sauce (strained yoghurt, cu
cumbers, and garlic) set a high standard for the rest of the meal.
Unfortunately, the Mediterranean cuisine nose-dived from
there. The Lentil Soup was similar to every other such soup we
had ever had — you become bored of the flavor after the first
three sips. And, most disappointingly, the Chicken Gyros that
we split (warning: they are huge!) also left our taste-buds very
uninterested. The tomatoes, iceberg lettuce and squirt of tahini
sauce were overpowered by the chalky Lavash bread. This
dominating bread left us wondering what even the chicken tast-

Ed like. To compensate for this blandness, Mary Liz poured the

lentil soup onto the wrap to liven it up. However, as we all

know from the dining halls, two wrongs don't make a
right.

Although we had already paid our tab, we
decided we couldn't leave without trying the
' bountiful baklavah. One more trip up to the

counter, and a little bit of bargaining on my part.

, wonders of baklava before from my Greek friends,
/ but neither Mary Liz nor I had tasted it. My recent
dismissal of desserts for Lent went right out the win-

dow, and, God, it was worth it. Flakey, paper-thin phyl
lo dough sits at the top of the little rectangular pastry.
These crisp carbs perfectly complement the walnut fla
vored, honey-oozing mush of pastry dough that sits at the
baklava's base. Simply put, this dessert is a "WOW"-er and

is in the running for best dessert I have ever eaten in my life.
Overall, the little Mediterranean cafe starts and ends
favorably, but the food lags in its middle courses. Our sug

Greek basics and you don't have the parental funds to sup
port the good cause of fine dining in Palo Alto. GO
GREEK!
