### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A walk-on spot on the hit TV series "24;" two tickets to
"The Price is Right" during host Boh Barker's final week;
an "American I listorv X" poster signed by Edward Nor
ton. No, these are not items in a Christie's showroom, they
are some of the prizes included in this week's 15th annual
Bid For Justice auction, which supports the Stanford Pub
lic Interest Law Foundation (SPILF). The auction fea
tures 250 items — valued at over $53,000 — which were
donated by local and national businesses as well as by
Stanford Law School (SLS) faculty, staff and students.
"The event is a great opportunity both to raise money
directly for public interest projects and to bring more at
tention to the valuable,but often overlooked.public inter
est work that so many law students and lawyers are
doing," said SPILF auction Co-Chair Melissa Magner JD
'08.
SPII I is a non-profit organization that uses proceeds
from its fundraisers — of which the auction is the largest
— to provide financial support to
SLS students working at public in
terest groups during the summer and
to award outside project grants to or
ganizations doing public interest
legal work.
"My favorite part of SPILF is that
it's not just made of students who are
planning public interest careers, but
students going into all types of legal
careers working to support their
classmates and others pursuing pub
lic interest work," said Adair Ford
J D 07, president of the SPILF board
of directors.
On Tuesday, SPILF launched the
online component of the auction —
a forum that allows people who are
away from campus to bid on many of
the items, excepting a select few that
are specifically geared toward SLS
students, such as dinners at faculty

members' homes.The online auction
closes today.
An Auction Gala will take place
at a semi-formal in Kresge Auditori
um tomorrow. From ft-8 p.m., a silent
auction will allow attendees to place
bids on items from the online auc
tion. At 8 p.m., there will be a live
auction featuring twenty of the most
high-priced items. A casino night will
follow the auction,and all auction at
tendees will receive 100 "Raise the
Stakes" dollars for use at the casino.
SPILF has also organized a "Bat
tle of the Beverages," an event that
pits second-year law students against
their third-year classmates in a com
petition to donate the most wine and
non-alcoholic beverages for con
sumption at the auction.The winning
class will receive extra "Raise the
Stakes" dollars for the casino.
"SPILF makes every attempt to
have catering and beverages donat
ed so that more of the auction pro
ceeds go directly to legal work." said
Samantha Brown JD '08, secretary
of the SPILF board of directors

According to the SPILF Web site,
the Bid for Justice Auction — which
is organized entirely by SLS students
— has been "an important part of
[SPILF's] fundraising activities and
a valued event for the Law School
community" since its inception in
1993. Two years ago, the auction
raised over $50,000 for SPILF.
Organizers are hopeful that this
year's event will break that record.
"This year, the SPILF auction
team has raised more value than
ever before," Ford said. "The range
of valuable items will appeal to a
large audience, so we're hoping for
even greater participation from Law
School alumni and the greater Stan
ford community so that we can raise
as much money for our beneficiaries
as possible."
