### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Intermission is taking a break this week, and what do you
think Roxy is doing in all her spare time? She'll give you one
guess. But before she got started, Roxy hit the SHPRC for her
free merchandise this quarter! Even if you've never been be
fore, Roxy encourages you to go check out the SHPRC's ex
tensive supply of condoms, lube and other goodies. You liter
ally walk in. recite your ID number and select $2 worth of your
favorite commodities from little jars lining the walls like in a
candy shop.
Once Roxy had carefully selected her stock for this quarter,
she got down to some heavy duty product testing. Here are her
evaluations of what's available this winter, so you know what
to choose when you make the trip. While supplies last!
1. Durex Performax
Perhaps the funniest condom Roxy encountered this season,
the Performax actually contains a numbing agent proven to
slow down male orgasm. Roxy can't speak for her partner, but
she enjoyed this condom very much. Perhaps it was in her
mind, but sex did seem to last longer, which is always a good
thing for the ladies. And her partner voiced no obvious objec
tion or frustration. In fact, he was eager to try it if it could
please Roxy a little bit more.Definitely check this one out.
2. Durex Maximum Love

It sounds the same as the last one, but this is actually the
I equivalent of a"plus size" condom. All Roxy will

say here is he careful if you or your partner
is not actually that well-endowed.

more likely to slip right

cute though, so at
I least it's worth taking
a look at.

Roxy, but not dangerously or uncomfort

rub the lube off her fingers after she put it on her partner,
which was a nice bonus. There's nothing too special about this
condom, but next time she goes Roxy's gonna take two.
4. Durex Extra Sensitive
T »
Voted most reliable by Consumer Reports, Durex calls this
the"original" super thin condom. To be honest, Roxy didn't
notice much of a difference. Her partner also confided that it
I

felt pretty much like a "regu
lar"condom. For sensitive,
read the next description.
5. Lifestyles Ultra Sensitive
Lifestyles also claims this is
the"original" thin condom. It
felt a little thinner than the
Durex version to Roxy, actual
ly. Personally, she always feels
a little less protected with
these ultra thin condoms, and
she knows her girlfriends
agree. Still, it's worth it once in
a while for that look on his
face, right? Guys, if you can
feel a difference in your plea
sure when you use thin con
doms. then Lifestyles* Extra
Sensitive is your best bet.
6. Lifestyles Dual Pleasure
Apparently the secret to more
pleasure"for him and her!"is

the light-bulb shape this sim
ple condom provides. Roxy was supremely unimpressed. By
trying to satisfy Roxy and her partner, the condom provided a

I lIIV vV'l l UVIII piUYIUV-U C 4
ho-hum experience

for both. Still,

it was
nice-

i y
lubri
cated and

didn't pose
any problems.

and Roxy pronounces it

good for those days when

you're not really trying tb blow-either

partner's head off.
7. Lifestyles Ribbed Pleasure
v Roxy was* er, pleasantly surprised that she really could feel
these ribs right where she likes them. Need she say more? Pick
up some extra of these for the dwindling number of cold win
ter nights left in the quarter. 112

8. Rough Rider Studded and Lubricated
These condoms cracked Roxy up. Not only is the packaging
oddly shaped (a rectangle instead of a square), but what com
pany actually names its condom Rough Rider? There was
nothing as special as Lifestyles' ribbing about these studs, al
though Roxy enjoyed the stud wearing the condom... You can
skip these, except for the laugh.
9. Beyond Seven Aloe
These are really as smooth as they promised! Lack of lubri
cation is a crucial cause of condom breakage, and that can
be easily averted with the silky feel of these off-brand con
doms. Roxy recommends leaving with at least three of
these.
10. Trustex Flavored Condoms
Offered in Banana, Strawberry, Wine Grape. Chocolate.
Vanilla, Mint and Cola. Roxy found these condoms pretty
nauseating, actually. Although the smells and tastes resemble
the listed flavors, they taste and smell more like poorly-dis
guised lube than anything else. Definitely skip.
11. Trustex and/or Durex Assorted Colors
These, too, were not as exciting as Roxy hoped. Once the con
dom is on the penis, the color pretty much disappears against
the normal color of his skin. Unless he's white as a ghost, or
something. More fun for flashlight tag.
Roxy encourages you to take a break this weekend and pick
up your freebies from the SHPRC. college, your par
ents are never going to pay for condoms again.

felt pretty much like a "regu
lar"condom. For sensitive,
read the next description.
5. Lifestyles Ultra Sensitive
Lifestyles also claims this is
the"original" thin condom. It
felt a little thinner than the
Durex version to Roxy, actual
ly. Personally, she always feels
a little less protected with
these ultra thin condoms, and
she knows her girlfriends
agree. Still, it's worth it once in
a while for that look on his
face, right? Guys, if you can
feel a difference in your plea
sure when you use thin con
doms. then Lifestyles* Extra
Sensitive is your best bet.
6. Lifestyles Dual Pleasure
Apparently the secret to more
pleasure"for him and her!"is

the light-bulb shape this sim
ple condom provides. Roxy was supremely unimpressed. By
trying to satisfy Roxy and her partner, the condom provided a

ho-hum experience

for both. Still,

it was
nice-

lubri
cated and

didn't pose
any problems.

and Roxy pronounces it

good for those days when

you're not really trying tb blow-either

partner's head off.
7. Lifestyles Ribbed Pleasure
v Roxy was* er, pleasantly surprised that she really could feel
these ribs right where she likes them. Need she say more? Pick
up some extra of these for the dwindling number of cold win
ter nights left in the quarter. 112

8. Rough Rider Studded and Lubricated
These condoms cracked Roxy up. Not only is the packaging
oddly shaped (a rectangle instead of a square), but what com
pany actually names its condom Rough Rider? There was
nothing as special as Lifestyles' ribbing about these studs, al
though Roxy enjoyed the stud wearing the condom... You can
skip these, except for the laugh.
9. Beyond Seven Aloe
These are really as smooth as they promised! Lack of lubri
cation is a crucial cause of condom breakage, and that can
be easily averted with the silky feel of these off-brand con
doms. Roxy recommends leaving with at least three of
these.
10. Trustex Flavored Condoms
Offered in Banana, Strawberry, Wine Grape. Chocolate.
Vanilla, Mint and Cola. Roxy found these condoms pretty
nauseating, actually. Although the smells and tastes resemble
the listed flavors, they taste and smell more like poorly-dis
guised lube than anything else. Definitely skip.
11. Trustex and/or Durex Assorted Colors
These, too, were not as exciting as Roxy hoped. Once the con
dom is on the penis, the color pretty much disappears against
the normal color of his skin. Unless he's white as a ghost, or
something. More fun for flashlight tag.
Roxy encourages you to take a break this weekend and pick
up your freebies from the SHPRC. college, your par
ents are never going to pay for condoms again.
