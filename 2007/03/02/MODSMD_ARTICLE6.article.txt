## CARD DESERTS ARIZONA STATE Sloppiness is Devils' advocate in crucial win 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
West Coast basketball fans often complain about
their teams' lack of exposure to East Coast media, but
maybe it's a good thing that Stanford's game against
Arizona State last night wasn't televised.
Members of the NCAA Tournament selection com
mittee will only see the 63-53 score of the Cardinal's
win over the Sun Devils, not the sloppy game that actu
ally took place.
"We knew it'd be a fight coming in," said head coach
Trent Johnson,"and that's exactly what it was."
Senior Fred Washington, who tends to thrive in fast
paced. wide-open games like this one, played his best
offensive game of the season, taking the ball to the bas
ket on fast-breaks and cutting through the seams of the
defense on his way to 18 points.
