## CARD DESERTS ARIZONA STATE Sloppiness is Devils' advocate in crucial win 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
West Coast basketball fans often complain about
their teams' lack of exposure to East Coast media, but
maybe it's a good thing that Stanford's game against
Arizona State last night wasn't televised.
Members of the NCAA Tournament selection com
mittee will only see the 63-53 score of the Cardinal's
win over the Sun Devils, not the sloppy game that actu
ally took place.
"We knew it'd be a fight coming in," said head coach
Trent Johnson,"and that's exactly what it was."
Senior Fred Washington, who tends to thrive in fast
paced. wide-open games like this one, played his best
offensive game of the season, taking the ball to the bas
ket on fast-breaks and cutting through the seams of the
defense on his way to 18 points.

Fred Washington goes for a layup in the second half of last night's game
against Arizona State. The senior forward had 18 points on the night, as the
Cardinal struggled with sloppy play for a 63-53 win
His performance helped to make up for an unusually
quiet night from freshmen big men Brook and Robin
Lopez, who combined for only nine points and six re
bounds.
"Let's not be blinded because Brook had four good
games," Johnson said of Lopez, who had scored 20 points
in four straight before last night. "This is a team."
Stanford (IS-10. 10-7 Pacific-10Conference) played a
fast-paced game against a slower Sun Devil team (7-21.1-
16). sometimes getting away from the half-court setup
that bigger players like the Lopez twins thrive in.
Sophomore forward Lawrence Hill scored 18 points
on 7-of-13 shooting and pulled down seven rebounds,
while sophomore guard Mitch Johnson continued his
sharp shooting, making 3-of-6 from beyond the arc to fin
ish with 11 points.
"I've definitely been shooting more confidently,"
Mitch Johnson said. "That comes from Fred getting into
the seams of the defense, and from the big guys swinging
the ball."
ITie Cardinal seemed poised to put the game away
after taking a 30-16 lead at halftime, but the Sun Devils
hung close by making seven of their first eight shots to
start the second period.
But Arizona State only got as close as seven before
Stanford ripped off a 17-5 run to put the game away.
1 lill made a layup to begin the run.and finished it off
with a 15-foot jumper and a three-pointer that gave Stan
ford a 61-42 lead and sealed the victory with 3:49 left.
Hie Sun Devils made enough miscues for both teams
in the first half, turning the ball over 10 times and shooting
only 25 percent as Stanford took a 30-16 lead.
Pendergraph hit a layup to give ASU its only lead on
the first possession of the game, but after that the Cardi
nal held the Sun Devils scoreless for nearly nine minutes.
The Cardinal pulled away on an 11-3 run in the final four
minutes of the half, keyed by six points from Washington.
A turnover by ASU forward Serge Angounou near the
end of the half typified the sloppy play by both teams. An
gounou missed a trey, but got his own rebound when the
Cardinal failed to block out. He then lost the ball near the
sideline, where ASU guard Jarren Shipp tried to save it

from going out of bounds by throwing it backwards over
his head. Sun Devil guard Derek Glasser pushed Wash
ington out of the way to catch the ball and got whistled for
a foul, while Washington somehow lost his shoe.
The Cardinal men could breathe a collective sigh of re
lief after escaping from a game in which players some
times seemed to spend more time chasing after loose balls
than dribbling.
"We're not happy, we're not satisfied yet.' Trent John
son said. "But what this team has done is pretty impres
sive, considering the caliber of the league."
The win brought the Cardinal into a three-way tie with
Arizona and Oregon for fourth place in the Pac-1().
As for the NCAA Tournament, they'll leave that up to
the selection committee.
"We're not thinking about that," Hill said."That's up to
them. It's up to us to go out and win."
