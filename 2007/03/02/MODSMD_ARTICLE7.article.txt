## Tree makes final cut Frosh lucked out of pack by secret committee 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
John Whipple '10 was selected
early Thursday as the Band's new
Tree after more than a week of
pranks, shenanigans and general ir
reverence.
Six candidates — five freshmen
and a junior — performed stunts to
impress the secretive selection com
mittee, which allegedly has an eclec
tic mix of characters ranging from
former Trees to Dollies. This year's
Tree Week skits included candidates
being shot by paintball guns, ripping
tape off their bodies, eating raw eggs
and staging fights.
Whipple's stunts included a
bizarre skateboard jump and veg
etable oil wrestling, lie was also
branded with dry ice, and he sent the
new Dollies on a secret mission in
volving a tight in the Claw.
Whipple will ease into his new role
and will replace current Tree Tommy

Leep*o7 over the next few weeks, mak
ing appearances as early as tomorrow.
Leep confirmed that Whipple is
the new Tree but declined to com
ment on the announcement or what
motivated the selection committee
to choose the freshman.
"I feel like all the candidates
wanted it. hut some people tried to
go at it by spending a lot of money,"
Whipple told The Daily. "Tree Week
is really about getting to know what
kind of person you are. I tried to ap
proach the week by doing things I
thought were funny and [doing] what
people wanted to see."
Whipple will be the Tree — the
unofficial mascot of the University
and the official mascot of the Band
for approximately one year.
As the new Tree. Whipple said he
plans on bringing unparalleled ener
gy to sporting events.
"1 want to see a lot of excitement,
a lot of creativity and a lot of you," he
said. "I hope everyone is super
charged about the upcoming year.
It's going to be a great time."
