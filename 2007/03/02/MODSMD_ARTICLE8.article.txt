# ASSU
## Slates race for first ASSU Exec candidates search for signatures 
### EMMA TROTTER STAFF WRITER 
Four ASSU Executive slates have
filed to vie for the titles of ASSU
President and Vice President in this
April's annual election. Two of the
slates comprise student government
veterans, while the other two are
made up of relative political novices.
Junior Class Executive Cabinet
member Lakshmi Karra.who is run
ning on a slate with Junior Class
President Brett Mammon, said she
thinks their separation from the
ASSU is advantageous and impor
tant.
"We feel that we have maintained
a healthy perspective on the ASSU
as informed outsiders," she said in an
email to Hie Daily. "There is often
the criticism that no one knows what
the heck the ASSU is actually doing.

We want to write a weekly ASSU up
date in The Daily to inform students
as to what the ASSU is doing and
keep us accountable."
By contrast, two undergraduate
senators — Senate chair Hershey
Avula '08 and Campus Advocacy
Committee chair Mondaire Jones'o9
spun a positive light on their insid
er status in the ASSU.
"Hershey and I believe that the
breadth and depth of our ASSU in
volvement separates Avula/Jones
from any other slate running in this
year's executive race." Jones said in
an email to The Daily. "We have
demonstrated an unparalleled com
mitment to student programming
and advocacy.
"We have developed an outstand
ing rapport with administrators and
members of the Faculty Senate that
will make it easier to negotiate with
and navigate through the administra
tion's bureaucracy." he added. "[This
will allow us to] effectively advocate
on behalf of student interests and to
put on quality programming that
promotes school spirit at the world
class university we call home."
The less experienced slates, how
ever, said that their lack of ASSU in
volvement makes them more attrac
tive candidates.
Brian Truebe "08 is running with
Folahan Olowoyeye 08. Truebe
vowed to rev up student interest in
the ASSIJ if elected.
"We will stop the nepotism in the
ASSU, an organization which has
aided in the marginalizing of student
rights and the breeding and engen
dering of apathy in the student
body," he said in an email to The
Daily. "You shouldn't have to have
past experience in the ASSU to lead
the student body. The majority of
students have probably never even
interacted with the ASSU."
Truebe, a Band member, has also
made the Band's full reinstatement a
part of his campaign platform.
"The Stanford Band, a group
which exemplified freedom, has
been forced into a submissive role to
the Athletics Department, the OSA
and the administration because the

destruction of school spirit is more
important than daring to trust their
own students,"he said. "Stanford tra
ditions have become homogenized
and the ASSU thinks it's progress."
Anthony Scodary '08 and Annie
Wyman 'OS represent The Chaparral,
which sponsors an ASSU Executive
slate in the election every year.
In the mold of prior Chappie slates,
Scodary and Wyman are taking a non
traditional approach to the election.
"Stanford is full of students —
students with needs and desires,"
Scodary said in an email to The
Daily. "Our goal is to discover those
needs and desires and match them to
our promises. Like gears in a cog. we
encircle them with hopes that rotate
about their desires."
Scodary explained that he and
Wyman are running not for personal
gain, but for the good of the University.
"Annie Wyman and I are running
for ASSU Executive not because we
need to, but because Stanford needs
us." he said. "Every election season,
you see a lot of candidates making
promises, but I assure you Annie and
I will make more."
While candidates cannot officially
begin campaigning until next quar
ter, three of the Executive slates have
already created Facebook groups
urging students to sign petitions to
get them on the ballot — each slate
must secure 200 electronic petition
