# Smoothie review
## Melon-ade wave 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN INTERMISSION WAVE RIDER 
I was never a real big fan of
Jamba Juice. I felt their smooth
ies only had a life of fifteen min
utes or so. after which they start
ed deteriorating into something
like melted fruity ice cream:
melty. fruity, ice-creamy.
And then, suddenly, there
were all-fruit smoothies. These
smoothies had infinite life be
cause after fifteen minutes,
frozen fruit goodness didn't dis
appear— it just started con
verting into fruit juice. And I
love fruit juice.
I decided on the cheery
sounding Melon-ade Wave. The
description read: "A sunny sup
ply of vitamins A and C mixed
with energizing honeydew
melon, tangy lemonade, white
grape juice and ice. Just what
you need to squeeze the most
out of each summer day."
I was thoroughly confused
when they handed me my
smoothie. I didn't quite under
stand how a blend of honeydew
(green). lemonade (yellow),and
white grape (white) juice could
come out light pink, lint I sipped
anyway.
It was interesting. Sweet.
Tangy. The honeydew, the
lemonade, the grape, they were
all there—just, sadly, in the
wrong amounts. A little too
much the lemonade and not
quite enough fruit. It had the po
tential. 1 think, to be the smooth
ie to end all smoothies. But alas,
the search continues.
