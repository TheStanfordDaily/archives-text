# Concert review
## Ted Leo and the Pharmacists offer students a cure 
### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION PHARMACIST 
A welcome bout of warm weather
gave the evening the appearance of
summer, and the crowd likewise re
flected this seasonal change with a mix
ture of shorts and skirts amongst the
Stanford sweatshirts and collared
shirts.
Kresge auditorium in its bland
stuffiness and fixed seating was a poor
choice for the energetic rockers that
were to play here last night. Even the
opening bands, Occam's Razor and the
Bee's Knees, made it apparent that a
xylophone recital would find this place
too formal. C'BGBs, Kresge is not.
Ted Leo dressed in experience and
the look of someone who had been on
the road a long time, ambled up the mi
crophone in a self-deprecating smirk.
The three other gentlemen set up be
hind him, each one looking like they
were magically transported from not
only different bands, but different time
periods- the bassist could have been in
any early 90's grunge band and the
drummer, with his bushy beard, made
him a dead ringer for Burt from Burt's
Bees.
The audience had been waiting in
anticipation, and despite the limita
tions in the venue, all got up and ready
to dance. Mr. Leo was all too eager to
oblige. I le played a few bars, cursed and
stopped. 1 guessed that he was still suf
fering from a stomach virus, but as an
other band member explained, it was
not only Leo's body but an amp cord
that was malfunctioning. Experience
aside. Leo admitted "We're learning a
lot tonight."
Leo and company draw comparisons
to the rough voice of Billy Bragg and
the stylistic crunchiness of The Clash
circa "London C alling."and yet whatev
er political fervor the Pharmacists lack
they make up for in pure ability to

please. As his face contorted to sing the
chorus of "Where I lave All the Rude
Boys (ione" everyone was on their feet.
Kresge transformed from a lecture hall
to a concert venue with Leo's falsetto.
Everything this man sings goes down
like honey, from old favorites like
"Counting Down the I lours," and"The
Angel's Share" to the smattering of new
songs that wetted appetites for his
forthcoming album. "I iving with the
Living," due out March 20th.
Leo is an English major's punk band or
a brainy indie rock band with reggae,
depending on who you ask. Part Ezra
Pound and part Joe Strummer, Leo
smoothes his eclectic influences with
his lullaby-like choruses. I le's got more
hooks than a meat packing plant but
convictions and profundity to warrant
the comparisons to early punk.
'Hie set closed with two covers. Eirst,
the Pharmacists covered "Rappaport's
Testament: I Never Gave lip" by
Chumbawamba (who, yes, wrote songs
beyond "Tubthumping"). The set with
the full band concluded with the clap

ping chorus "I crawled in the mud but 1
never gave up." It was a reminder that
despite the sugary dancing music, Leo
is still taking cues from punk and reg
gae. even if he is singing to an audience
that sports collared shirts and varsity
jackets rather than mo-hawks.
Einally, sweat-dripping off his bald
ing head and exhausted. Leo came back
on to offer a cover of" Dirty Old Town."
It's the kind of song that you can only
do late in your set to even touch the
worn emotion of Ewan Mac Coll. The
song somehow fits alongside his trib
utes to punk, reggae and traditional
rock.
As the crowd emptied out to go back
to problem sets and papers, members of
Stanford Concert Network matched
the earlier grin of Leo. SCN members
had brought to campus one of the most
exciting acts of our age. an energetic
and fun band that wove many different
segments of the community together
under the banner of punk rock. For a
night, Kresge might as well have been
CBGB's.
