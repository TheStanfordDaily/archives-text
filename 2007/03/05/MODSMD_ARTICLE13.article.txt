## Equally Attractive Non-Alcoholic Event (EANAE) 'Rocky Horror Picture' — GO! 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION CROSS DRESSER 
"Rocky Horror Picture Show"
is the exact opposite of doing a P
chem problem set: according to
dominant RHPS mathematical
models, one plus anything equals
69; the only natural laws are
"Don't throw shit at the screen"
and "Be as loud as you can" (al
though judging by the saggy 60-
year-old woman in lingerie, the
law of gravity might still apply):
and forget that pesky right-hand
vector rule — the only hands in
the show are of the "jive" and
"job" varieties. Everything about
the "Rocky Horror Picture
Show" is crass, raunchy and bur
lesque in the tawdriest of senses. It
is. in a word, awesome.
For those of you who are unini
tiated. "Rocky Horror Picture
Show" is the longest-running au
dience participation show in the
world. The first and third Satur
day of every month at the Guild
Theatre, a cast of dedicated Rock
yphiles assembles for a midnight
showing of the 1975 cult-classic
trashsterpiece. It's no mere movie
screening, though: the cast dresses
up as the characters and reenacts
the entire movie as it plays, while
audience members scream bawdy
shout-outs. A live Rocky Horror
screening is also the ultimate alco
hol-free event: the audience is not
just requested but practically
mandated to be as obnoxious as
they can. and if you have a little
trouble getting started, the cross
dressing. boa-waving cast will
loosen your inhibitions faster
than a handle of Malibu.
It's difficult to convey a sense
of the full RHPS midnight-show
ing experience to someone who
has never been. The full effect of
the film is horrifying, hilarious and
perhaps... strangely arousing? Or
at least rousingly strange. Fortu
nately. the cast knows how to milk
the initial shock of a first-time
Rocky-goer: at the showing I went
to. about half of the hundred-per
son audience were virgins. As part
of the ritualistic virgin-hazing, all
of the newbies painted "V"s on
their forehead with red lipstick
and some were forced to play a
game involving a pair of panty
hose, a hot dog, a two-liter soda
bottle and lots of pelvic thrusting.
Use your imagination here.
But this raunchiness aside, the
real core of the Rocky Horror ex
perience is the cast, and The Guild
Theatre has the best cast I have
ever seen in my long, perhaps too
involved history with RHPS.
Within the first five minutes, there
were two stripteases, a man pranc
ing down the aisles wearing noth

ing but a flesh-colored thong, and
a stirring game of toss-the-ring
around-the-( fake?! )-erection.
Throughout the show they kept
up the energy by leading dance
numbers, fake-bickering and
great shout-outs.
The shout-outs, incidentally,
merit their own description.
Every cast cultivates their own
approximate shout-out script as
they progress, ranging from the
simple (every time a certain char
acter introduces himself, every
one shouts "Asshole!," and when
he introduces his fiancee, we
scream "Slut!"), to complex dia
logues preempting the actors'
lines, to the grotesque and topical
(when a character raised his glass,
one cast member shouted, "I'd
like to make a toast to Steve
Irwin, who died as he lived: with
animals in his heart. ...Too soon?"
It was not too soon.) Audience
participation also includes throw
ing things like rice (during a wed
ding scene) and toilet paper (inex
plicable)— although, as the cast
reminded us beforehand, proper
Rocky etiquette is to throw up
and back "because the screen is
expensive and the cast is cheap."
The audience ranged from nor
mal-looking Stanford students
wearing hoodies and flipflops to
elderly cross-dressed Rocky ad
dicts with wrinkly tattoos, but it
looked like everyone had a good
time. And why not? I"he bottom
line is that a live performance of
Rocky Horror Picture Show is
crude, lewd and a great relief from
normal life: where else do you get
to sing lyrics like "See androids
fighting and fucking and sucking
off Brad and Janet?" It is the most
non-Stanford, completely normal
college experience I have ever
had. Until they introduce shout
outs to the Lane Lecture Series,
trust me. I'll be back.
The performances take place
at midnight on the first and third
Saturday of every month at the
Guild Theatre in Menlo Park (949
El Camino Real). Tickets cost
$7.50. and after the show the cast
(who works for free) solicits well
deserved donations. Also worth
noting: they have a few events
coming up, including Rocky I lor
ror Patrick's Day on March 17th
(I think this means everyone will
be drunk) and Tacky Horror Pic
ture Show on April 3rd (all the
cast members cross-dress and
there is a transvestite lingerie con
test for the audience).
So throw some fishnets on
under your flipflops and come.
As the cast says. "Rule number
69: II you don't participate, you
can't come. It's like sex." Except
funnier.
