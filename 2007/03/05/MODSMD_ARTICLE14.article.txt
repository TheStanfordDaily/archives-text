## "Fusion 19" exhibit more cold than nuclear 
### SETH SHAMBAN INTERMISSION GALLERY-GOER 
Art 44. a course offered through Stanford
Continuing Studies, provides a rigorous edu
cation in the art world for those lucky enough
to participate. Prospective students must
have their work juried in order to get in. and
once accepted they must put together a show
at Modernbook Gallery in Palo Alto.
The program is wildly successful. Now in
its third year, the opening of the show, enti
tled "Fusion 19," on Friday night had people
lined up outside the door of Modernbook
waiting to see the best that Art 44 has to offer.
A look inside reveals the work of experi
enced photographers who produce beauti
ful prints. Most notable among the nineteen
are Mahyar Rahmatian. Richard Stultz anil
Jean Timsit. 7'imsit focuses on the people of
Bhutan and takes line portraits, closely
cropped compositions with a focus on the
face and sometimes the torso. But this seems
contradictory to the title of her series. " I lap

pincss Country."
Armed only with photos of people, and
no landscapes, Timsit looks at a country
through its people, but never the land itself.
Never seeing the earth on its own terms
leaves a vital part of country out of focus.
While it is standard to do either landscape
or portraiture, offering a look at a nation
without its terrain seems unsatisfying and
overly general.
Rahmatian. whose print "California
Street" is the show's standout,focuses on ar
chitectural landmarks, epitomized in his
ultra-wide angle shot of the Riffcl Tower en
titled "La Tour Eiffel Antique." But his vi
sion of the Parisian icon lacks depth and
feeling. The only thing that is on display is
the iconography of the tower itself, which
may be fine for some people, whereas his
"California Street" possesses a depth, both
literal and figurative, which speaks to all
things pretentious and meaningful: the land
scape of the modern city, the desire to trav
el, the surreal amidst the mundane, the inhu

man scale of the human landscape.
"California Street" makes a statement
about a place and a time in a way that the
generic "La Tour Hiffel Antique" fails to be
cause it takes more risks in allowing itself to
capture an entire landscape instead of an
icon alone. "California Street" shows what
Rahmatian can do when he explores the
places he photographs more fully.
The same can be said of Stultz. 1 le photo
graphs architecture and tends to compose
Ins shots in the same way: a slither of edifice
along the left or right side.sky in the top por
tion of the picture and building beneath.
Iliis compositional sameness keeps the pic
tures from making statements about place
or time. Rather, they read like stock photo
graphs made to the same specifications be
cause that's what the client wants.
In many respects. Fusion 19 feels like a
stock exhibition. Any of the artists could be ro
tated out without any loss of meaning or cohe
sion to the show because it possesses neither.
While the work of the artists may individ

ually have a coherent focus and make a
meaningful comment — this is true for all
the artists in the show —they fail to come
together to create something more than
what they already are. A course which
makes the production of a gallery show its
end result should spend more time throwing
the artists together creatively so that their
show has an idea, theme or style which runs
throughout all nineteen artists. Anything
less is unsatisfying.
More time spent looking beyond what
the artists did as individuals and forcing
them to look beyond their comfortable
repertoires would have created more out
standing work and given the show a sense of
purpose and meaning.This lack of coherent
vision is a fatal flaw which renders the show
neither good nor bad. but an inhabitant of
that awful realm of "fine."
Fusion 19 is open daily from 11 a.m. to 9
p.m. at Modernbook Gallery. 494 University
Avenue, Palo Alto. For more information,
