# Freaks and geeks, indeed

### VICTOR FUSTE IN TERMISSION DORK 
[Writer's note: I'm a dork. 1 tried
to keep it quiet during high school
but that sort of repression always
seemed to fail when it came to ro
mantically engaging the opposite
sex. Now that those traumatizing
years are well in the past, geeks like
me are comfortable in exposing
themselves as such; and although
we're still exposing ourselves to
ridicule and scorn, by this point we're
hardened by years of wedgies and
cold, lonely nights. So, laugh away, 1
can take it. 1 promise.This is the lens
through which 1 recommend you
keep reading.]
Every year around this time, there
is mass congregation of a strange seg
ment of the San Francisco populace
— it convenes at the Moscone Cen
ter and it's appropriately called Won
der Con.
Now. if you think that San Fran
cisco is full of weirdos, you haven't
been to a comic convention like
WonderCon—Storm troopers do
crowd control and full grown men
have no problem wearing spandex
and capes.
Wonder Con attendance reaches
into the thousands. Last year, rough
ly 18,000 people in all sorts of cos
tumes from an anime elf to Captain
Jack Sparrow stepped into the con
vention center. For people who know
the difference between adamantium
and adilithium, this event is the
Mecca of all things nerd. For people
who don't live in their mother's base
ment. it's a chance to remember why
you gave all those wedgies in high
school.
The three day press orgy never
fails to deliver on the goods. Mixed in
with the dozens of comic book writ
ers and artists are a smattering of
porn-stars and legitimate actors from

TV and movie classics such as Lassie
star Jon Provost (I foundTimmy. He
wasn't in the well.) and Ernie Hud
son (Winston Zeddemore from
"Ghostbusters"). Needless to say. 1
was more than giddy when I saw
Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) and
Ray Park (Darth Maul).
Presentations from the big movie
studios ran through the afternoon
and featured all the upcoming films
that every fanboy is bound not to
miss. I should note here that though 1
firmly believe that Stan "the Man"
Lee is a god amongst mortals for his
work at Marvel comics, my tastes
have shifted (1 didn't say matured, if
you'll notice) to the non-comic fare
at Wonder Con.
Admittedly, the studios cater to
the chief demographic of a comic
book convention (males aged 18-45
...unmarried) by showing comic-in
spired movies. However, considering
the increase in popularity of the
genre through such mainstream
blockbusters like "Spider-Man."
"Batman Begins," and "Superman
Returns," America's thirst for comic
book movies has grown to the point
where obscure characters like Ghost
Rider can be translated to the silver
screen and bank $94.8 million do
mestically. (By the way, what the
f*ck? Ghost Rider? Really?)
Here's a quick rundown of what
the studios brought to the Con. what
you should go see and what you can
miss:
I)isney\Pixar: Director Brad Bird
("The Incredibles," "Iron Giant")
was joined by actor Patton Oswalt
("Reno 911: Miami") to plug the
newest Pixar animated vehicle.Titled
"Ratatouille" but pronounced "Rat
a-too-ee," the film is the story of a
skinny, opinionated rat in a Paris
kitchen who tries to eke out a living
while somehow becoming a chef in
the process. Like all of Pixar's ven

tures, this is one that is guaranteed to
please audiences of all ages.
Warner Bros.: Even though two-time
Academy Award winner Hilary
Swank swung by to promote her new
film.entitled " Ilie Reaping"wherein
an attractive miracle debunker
(Swank) goes down to New Orleans
to discover the ten biblical plagues
(Ridiculous? Why,yes it is.).the high
light of the Warner Bros, presenta
tion came after she left the stage.The
computer animated "TMNT," fea
turing everyone's favorite teenage
mutant ninja turtles blew everyone's
mind. Not much was said about the
plot, but it doesn't matter — it's the
Turtles and as far as I'm concerned
that's good enough for me. With slick
visuals, a keen sense of fun and a fan
base swimming in nostalgia for the
property, "TMNT" will be released
on March 23.
Last on the WB docket was Frank
Miller's "300." The film was pegged
as a "blood soaked, testosterone
filled date movie" by actor Gerard
Butler (King Leonidas) and it looks
to be both brutally gory and a cine
matic trip. Shot almost exclusively in
front of a green-screen, "300" tells
the tale of the Spartans who fought
against an enormous army of Per
sians at the Battle of Thermopylae.
Men: if you take your significant
other to this film, don't be surprised
if she leaves you for not having per
fectly chiseled abs. Every man in this
film could crush kittens with their bi
ceps and none were as intense as
King Leonidas himself, Gerard But
ler— a man with a freakishly devot
ed following of middle-aged women
(check out www.gerardbutler.net if
you don't believe me.) Coming out
on March 9, "300" takes its beautiful
and bloody imagery straight from
Frank Miller's graphic novel —
much like "Sin City" did — and is ab
solutely stunning to behold.

Sony Pictures: Even though director
Sam Raimi couldn't be at Wonder-
Con to talk about his upcoming "Spi
der-Man 3," tans of the franchise
were treated to an exclusive treat
an extended glimpse of the film fea
turing Venom, Peter Parker's (Tobey
Maguire) arch-nemesis played by
the inexplicably named Topher
Grace. Of all the huge Hollywood
films coming out this summer, "Spi
der-Man 3" looks to be the one that is

going to trounce the competition on
sheer scope. From swinging from the
buildings to fighting with a black
alien symbiote, there's nothing more
satisfying than seeing a pitch perfect
translation of your childhood hero
hy a director who is so emotionally
invested in the property.
A day at Wonder Con is a sensory
overload. Between the flashy sights
and nauseating smells (oh God, the
smells), the convention is one of

those bizarre cultural phenomena
that's impossible to explain unless
you've actually been to one. It cer
tainly is not for everyone, but for
those valiant enough to brave the
throngs of strange, strange people,
chances are fairly high that you'll
spot a famous person or two — or at
the very least someone dressed up to
look like ;i famous character from a
movie you may have watched when
you were eight years old.

skinny, opinionated rat in a Paris
kitchen who tries to eke out a living
while somehow becoming a chef in
the process. Like all of Pixar's ven

tures, this is one that is guaranteed to
please audiences of all ages.
Warner Bros.: Even though two-time
Academy Award winner Hilary

film.entitled " Ilie Reaping"wherein

(Swank) goes down to New Orleans
to discover the ten biblical plagues
(Ridiculous? Why,yes it is.).the high
light of the Warner Bros, presenta
tion came after she left the stage.The
computer animated "TMNT," fea
turing everyone's favorite teenage
mutant ninja turtles blew everyone's
mind. Not much was said about the
plot, but it doesn't matter — it's the
Turtles and as far as I'm concerned
that's good enough for me. With slick
visuals, a keen sense of fun and a fan
base swimming in nostalgia for the
property, "TMNT" will be released
on March 23.
Last on the WB docket was Frank
Miller's "300." The film was pegged
as a "blood soaked, testosterone
filled date movie" by actor Gerard
Butler (King Leonidas) and it looks
to be both brutally gory and a cine
matic trip. Shot almost exclusively in
front of a green-screen, "300" tells
the tale of the Spartans who fought
against an enormous army of Per
sians at the Battle of Thermopylae.
Men: if you take your significant
other to this film, don't be surprised
if she leaves you for not having per
fectly chiseled abs. Every man in this
film could crush kittens with their bi
ceps and none were as intense as
King Leonidas himself, Gerard But
ler— a man with a freakishly devot
ed following of middle-aged women
(check out www.gerardbutler.net if
you don't believe me.) Coming out
on March 9, "300" takes its beautiful
and bloody imagery straight from
Frank Miller's graphic novel —
much like "Sin City" did — and is ab
solutely stunning to behold.

Sony Pictures: Even though director
Sam Raimi couldn't be at Wonder-
Con to talk about his upcoming "Spi
der-Man 3," tans of the franchise
were treated to an exclusive treat
an extended glimpse of the film fea
turing Venom, Peter Parker's (Tobey
Maguire) arch-nemesis played by
the inexplicably named Topher
Grace. Of all the huge Hollywood
films coming out this summer, "Spi
der-Man 3" looks to be the one that is

going to trounce the competition on
sheer scope. From swinging from the
buildings to fighting with a black
alien symbiote, there's nothing more
satisfying than seeing a pitch perfect
translation of your childhood hero
hy a director who is so emotionally
invested in the property.
A day at Wonder Con is a sensory
overload. Between the flashy sights
and nauseating smells (oh God, the
smells), the convention is one of

those bizarre cultural phenomena
that's impossible to explain unless
you've actually been to one. It cer
tainly is not for everyone, but for
those valiant enough to brave the
throngs of strange, strange people,
chances are fairly high that you'll
spot a famous person or two — or at
the very least someone dressed up to
look like ;i famous character from a
movie you may have watched when
you were eight years old.

[Writer's note: I'm a dork. 1 tried
to keep it quiet during high school
but that sort of repression always
seemed to fail when it came to ro
mantically engaging the opposite
sex. Now that those traumatizing
years are well in the past, geeks like
me are comfortable in exposing
themselves as such; and although
we're still exposing ourselves to
ridicule and scorn, by this point we're
hardened by years of wedgies and
cold, lonely nights. So, laugh away, 1
can take it. 1 promise.This is the lens
through which 1 recommend you
keep reading.]
Every year around this time, there
is mass congregation of a strange seg
ment of the San Francisco populace
— it convenes at the Moscone Cen
ter and it's appropriately called Won
der Con.
Now. if you think that San Fran
cisco is full of weirdos, you haven't
been to a comic convention like
WonderCon—Storm troopers do
crowd control and full grown men
have no problem wearing spandex
and capes.
Wonder Con attendance reaches
into the thousands. Last year, rough
ly 18,000 people in all sorts of cos
tumes from an anime elf to Captain
Jack Sparrow stepped into the con
vention center. For people who know
the difference between adamantium
and adilithium, this event is the
Mecca of all things nerd. For people
who don't live in their mother's base
ment. it's a chance to remember why
you gave all those wedgies in high
school.
The three day press orgy never
fails to deliver on the goods. Mixed in
with the dozens of comic book writ
ers and artists are a smattering of
porn-stars and legitimate actors from

TV and movie classics such as Lassie
star Jon Provost (I foundTimmy. He
wasn't in the well.) and Ernie Hud
son (Winston Zeddemore from
"Ghostbusters"). Needless to say. 1
was more than giddy when I saw
Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) and
Ray Park (Darth Maul).
Presentations from the big movie
studios ran through the afternoon
and featured all the upcoming films
that every fanboy is bound not to
miss. I should note here that though 1
firmly believe that Stan "the Man"
Lee is a god amongst mortals for his
work at Marvel comics, my tastes
have shifted (1 didn't say matured, if
you'll notice) to the non-comic fare
at Wonder Con.
Admittedly, the studios cater to
the chief demographic of a comic
book convention (males aged 18-45
...unmarried) by showing comic-in
spired movies. However, considering
the increase in popularity of the
genre through such mainstream
blockbusters like "Spider-Man."
"Batman Begins," and "Superman
Returns," America's thirst for comic
book movies has grown to the point
where obscure characters like Ghost
Rider can be translated to the silver
screen and bank $94.8 million do
mestically. (By the way, what the
f*ck? Ghost Rider? Really?)
Here's a quick rundown of what
the studios brought to the Con. what
you should go see and what you can
miss:
I)isney\Pixar: Director Brad Bird
("The Incredibles," "Iron Giant")
was joined by actor Patton Oswalt
("Reno 911: Miami") to plug the
newest Pixar animated vehicle.Titled
"Ratatouille" but pronounced "Rat
a-too-ee," the film is the story of a
skinny, opinionated rat in a Paris
kitchen who tries to eke out a living
while somehow becoming a chef in
the process. Like all of Pixar's ven
